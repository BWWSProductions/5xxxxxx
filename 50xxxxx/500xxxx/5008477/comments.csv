,GoWithTheFlowYo,2009-07-17T21:32Z,"I dont know where your country .pt is located but it looks like you have a dial up connection.... 

In 16 hours I will let you know if there are any problems :)"
[V],Murlok,2009-07-17T21:47Z,Only thanks for help me seeding Yes got me a dial up but a very fast :)
,cranswick,2009-07-17T21:56Z,"Hi Murlok
I was posting a comment to you on a previous Nero 9 torrent just a moment ago where you suggested coming here as an alternative.
It seems to have disappeared - no wonder my DL wasnt going too well.
My question was that I have a previous version of 9 from you that I uninstalled a while back. Do you think your pated silent activation patch for the 50MB version might ignite the old bugger??
Best Wishes. "
[V],Murlok,2009-07-17T22:08Z,cranswick for sure not know! But after that lot of torrents I think they work if not I always delete them and its only 50 mb so try mine I have now 24 seeders so it will be fast m8 :)
,cranswick,2009-07-17T22:09Z,"Will do - Thank you very much once again.
Regards. Mark."
,JOKAZ,2009-07-17T22:57Z,"thanks Murlok. Seed on , +1

When I started the instalation I was scared with the language but then I saw that's in English.

Thanks"
[V],Murlok,2009-07-17T23:04Z,I only added Russians but all can be in English Peers I never let you down :)
,jersson,2009-07-18T05:53Z,"Yeep this guy's uploads is the best on PB, thank's man"
,fenrisilver,2009-07-19T01:45Z,"It downloaded quickly enough but I couldn't get this to work. I got past the part with the Russian, and then it finished installing, and when I tried to run the program it says ""Application is not runnable because it is not licensed. Buy now"" I even tried to click on ""Enter Serial Key"" and it says I can't, and to reinstall Nero. Whatever's special about this installer, it didn't work. "
,Matsjiht,2009-07-19T19:59Z,"While installing, I only see strange characters and stuff (Russian?)

I think this ain't gonna work for me.... :'("
,gabriel2007,2009-07-19T23:31Z,it didnt work for me!
,ekarth,2009-07-21T11:21Z,"
Murlok you rock! as usual.
+1 added to reps.
i've a request

I need this software called Aston2.
here is the product and website 
http://www.astonshell.com/aston2/
(its just like Windowsblinds but improves system performance by closing the explorer.exe) 

there is no serial or crack on anywhere.
please help.
(on internet there are serial and crack for only Aston2 menus but not the complete aston2 pack) "
,ekarth,2009-07-21T11:23Z,"for those people who can't get this working.

1. disconnect internet when installing.
2. If you've Kaspersky then after reboot > launch Kaspersky > settings > application filtering > right click on Nero folder's Network panel and select 'deny'
that'll prevent Nero's components  from connecting to home site and make it run."
,Finlay,2009-07-21T19:49Z,"I cannot get this to work...
Iv followed the advice and dsconnected from the internet when its installing and im not useing kapersky.  I get the intaller with the Russian ok but once it comes up with the screen with the dodgy thumbs up picture (im guessing the finished intalling window) nothing at all happens
please help, im running on XP "
,danjmarsden,2009-07-21T22:24Z,Does'nt work when installed also in some strange lingo don't bother
[V],Murlok,2009-07-23T16:50Z,danjmarsden we all was noobs once.But not added comments like you my friend :(
,ruchirrathore,2009-07-23T21:35Z,"Just downloaded this & installed fine, without any major issue.. yep, between Russian installer window, and English installer window, there is a unusually long wait, but same thing happens if you install from trial version from nero website too. So far so good, haven't actually burned a DVD yet, but program is running fine without any major issues. great upload Murlok.. keep up the good work.. :-)"
,roller_reactor,2009-07-24T11:34Z,"I also didn't get far with this one. The installer is apparently in Russian. It runs OK as far as the thumbs-up picture. At that point, the uninstaller can be found in c:\program file\nero, but no sign of the actual program itself. No application blocking, and I did disconnect from internet before trying. Thanks anyway, Murlok, sounds like it runs okay for some."
[V],Murlok,2009-07-24T16:58Z,roller_reactor you can choose install in English or in russians no problem Not like the Russian language leave it alone and just install :-)
,pugalc,2009-07-27T04:56Z,"does it includes ""RECODE"""
,ryantheremi,2009-07-29T03:34Z,thx man perfect for ISO ill seed this for months
,Dubhridir,2009-07-29T18:04Z,"Russian install boxes, I didn't see an option for English.. and like other people... once installed only installed an uninstall and sys file in the nero folder... And like the others, I was disconnected from the net when I tried it...... If you can't give clear answers to these problems then I suggest you take it down"
,blicious,2009-07-30T20:52Z,seed please
,Xroznic,2009-07-31T13:00Z,"Took no more then 2 minutes to download.
However the installation process didnt go as flawless. It couldnt install the whole thing and therefor asked if I wanted to keep the installed parts or uninstall them.
Cba to try again and again. I installed it with internet plugged out etc etc :) 
LATERS

,mrwrang,2009-07-31T15:29Z,"cant get this to work... at 80% install it says somthing like ""RollbackCleanup error"""
[V],Murlok,2009-08-01T10:30Z,I can see that some people do understand how to install this and others not so I cannot see any reason to take it down since it looks as lack of knowledge  from some peers.I tested myself and got English installer and all should know to let a cracked program calling home will make a instant fail of the program!Rule always nearly is to block the prg to go online! :)
,RogueTrader,2009-08-02T03:24Z,"It installed ok for me.  The install prompt is in Russian apparently, but click on the usual button & you won't have any problems, just be patient.  It didn't put an icon on my desktop though, so I went to the Start --> All Programs & found the entry, dragged the 'nero burning rom' to my desktop to create the shortcut, no worries."
,RogueTrader,2009-08-02T03:25Z,.... and Thanks Murlok !!  :-)
[V],Murlok,2009-08-02T19:30Z,Thank you all peers for comments :)
,nikrusty,2009-08-06T10:26Z,"It installed just fine, but how do I launch it? there is no .exe except the one of the Nero Control center??
I'm using win7 btw."
,lektran,2009-08-10T07:56Z,"Dont Work . 
someone ruined it"
,sparkie420,2009-08-12T01:21Z,Excellent torrent Murlok. I only cared for the burning ROM anyway so all A's on that aspect. No problems on install and starting the progrm was a breeze. Just typed Nero in my search bar. :) Will seed!
,2kuul4skool,2009-08-17T04:39Z,"If you get the rollback error try going to nero's site and using the nero 9 clean tool, then try installing nero burning rom again. I had the rollback error too until after I ran the clean tool now it works great. Thanks Murlok!"
,willynillyking,2009-09-06T23:21Z,Perfect.  Thank you very much.
,dave359,2009-10-07T16:02Z,"Hi ppl - quick thing regarding Rollback error - I seem to recall a previous time i encountered this, I did a windows update and then it worked ok.  It may be to do with the Microsoft .NET Framework components.  Make sure the latest version of this is installed before installing Nero."
,Oo0oO,2009-10-13T18:00Z,"Can plz, someone tell what i need to do exactly to get this  done and working plz"
,Oo0oO,2009-10-13T18:05Z,and is this only the trial or full
,Leduruk,2009-10-20T09:09Z,"For the first time, I finally find a program I can't follow directions for installing.

I've read and re-read people's comments here.

I'm usually pretty savvy at stuff like this and never had to ask for help.

Well this one's got me stumped.

Like others here, all I get is the Russian installation setup.

I've tried waiting 30mins for the 'English version' to popup after running the executable.

Nada.

Nothing installs except for uninstall.exe. No 'rollback' errors.

I'm on a very clean WinXP SP3.

And I'd normally chuck this into the junk downloads list but I get the vibe that Murlok's a legit guy who shares good torrents.

Hrmm, should I go for the 'Ultimate (bloatware) version' or wait to see if somebody comes up with something to make this leaner version work?"
,qwertybo,2009-12-07T14:51Z,"downloaded, installed, had russian language, went to folder installed in

the only file there was an uninstall app, uninstalled

did virus scan with trendmicro housecall THIS FILE CONTAINS ROOTKIT AND TROJAN"
,Pho2,2009-12-19T23:05Z,This was pretty suspicious. Didn`t work and I wouldn`t be suprised if I got trojans now.
,christiangreer,2010-07-28T09:29Z,"WORKS PERFECT, REMEMBER TO DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET.  IT APPEARS IN RUSSIAN BUT JUST CLICK ON THE HIGHLIGHTED BOX.  THANK YOU FOR THE FAST UPLOAD !!"
