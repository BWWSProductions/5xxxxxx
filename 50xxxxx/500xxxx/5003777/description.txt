X-COM - UFO DEFENSE:

X-COM: UFO Defense takes the normal PC-style approach to strategy games and converts it to the PlayStation. The story begins with aliens invading Earth. You must find a way to fight back through outright assault, as well as through the use of some subterfuge. First you must make sure to gather enough money and budget it wisely, since you will need it to purchase new buildings and equipment. Each upgrade increases your chances of destroying the enemy and getting on to the next mission. To keep the gameplay fresh and interesting, every level follows a different structure and planning your attack is essential. You also have the ability to research confiscated alien artifacts and use them to your advantage later. The fate of the world is in your hands, as you are the only one with the intelligence, resourcefulness, and courage to save humanity.
