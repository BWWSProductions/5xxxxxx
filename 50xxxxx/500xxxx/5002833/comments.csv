,turcott,2009-07-20T19:50Z,"dude your torrent doesn't work.  i borrowed a friends macbook, 2.2ghz intel core 2 duo.  only OS on it was win xp.  burned your uploaded .CDR file using IMGBURN as a .cdr file, at the lowest speed, then renamed your file as .ISO and burned a copy as an ISO in Nero burning software at low speed.  Both copies a .CDR and .ISO version don't work.

All you get after holding down control or C, is the icon for ""EFI Boot"", once you click you get a white screen, grey apple in the middle with a small circular hour glass, this goes on for a min or 2, then the grey apple changes to a circle with a diagonal like in in it with the hour glass continuing to move in a circle....and does nothing after that, I even waited 20 min.

No OS that I know of would take that long to start the install process....maybe theres glitches in the file you uploaded, cause I wasted 5 DVD's trying different ways to burn it.  Also my buddy has his drives partitioned with XP on one, and nothing on the other....which is where OS 10.5 would've gone if this copy worked."
,Sodacycle,2009-07-21T13:52Z,"Ok i downloaded the torrent, and burnt the image with ImgBurn, poped it in the mac and it mounts to the desktop.. i clicked install and restarted then when it tries to read from the dvd it flashes the folder that means it cant find the startup disk.. im thinking you screwed something up when you were removing things... perhaps the file that makes it bootable?"
,turcott,2009-07-22T00:36Z,"i burnt a copy as .CDR which is what ""vickmaker"" provided, burned image as is using IMGBURN.  Also made a copy of the .CDR as an .ISO and burned that using Nero. 

Both .CDR and .ISO copies do the same thing.  The icon appears for ""Boot EFI', screen goes white with grey apple, 2 min later the apple turns into ay no entry symbol.  

Its like files are missing for the the initial set up to begin, even burning at 1, 2, 3, or 4x didn't make a difference.  

Vickmaker, you should check it again....this took forever to download and wasted a lot of time cause it doesn't work.  "
,turcott,2009-07-22T00:39Z,"***For anyone else, don't bother downloading this torrent, it doesn't work.  You'll end up wasting time and just over 4gb of space.  Until the torrent is fixed DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
,kolothos,2009-07-25T05:28Z,Can confirm turcott's story! Disc is recognised but it won't finish booting.
,HellCrap,2009-07-30T22:50Z,is it possible to use this in virtualbox ?
,slbm70,2009-08-27T02:53Z,"unfortunately i couldn't get it to work either (white intel C2D iMac). wouldn't allow to deselect all languages, then came up with error that files were missing and to either retry or restart (as told in instructions)... 

any solutions anyone?"
