Apparently Microsoft has compiled and signed off the RTM (Released to Manufacturing) build of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 much earlier than everybody expected, and with the build version tag number thatâ€™s come as a surprise too. Just as most people awaits Windows 7 RTM with build version of 7300 (as Windows 7 Beta is 7000 and Windows 7 RC is 7100), or 7272, as the natural increment to July 13th, the much rumored official RTM date, the word is leaked that Windows 7 RTM will be build 7600, with version number of 6.1.7600.16384 and full build string of 6.1.7600.16384.win7_rtm.090710-1945, if itâ€™s indeed the final gold RTM code for Windows 7.

Windows 7 RTM Build 7600 no longer able to use Windows 7 Beta product keys or Windows 7 RC product keys to activate. However, itâ€™s possible to rearm Windows 7 for 120 days activation free usage, in which during these period, some kind of properly working and non-franken build activation crack may appear.
