,scog,2009-07-18T03:22Z,"Thanks so much for these Bricktop, you give me a great chance to try out these movies before I choose which to buy on Blu Ray."
,silgt,2009-07-18T03:53Z,"Thank you...again!!! :-)

Can any good soul send me an invite to Demonoid? Been waiting for over a year now for the registration to open...shauntstan@gmail.com"
,enritnt,2009-07-18T06:36Z,"Hey man, i know you should be sick with technical questions, im usin ripbot264 as you suggested on the comments on other movies and is AWESOME but how exactly do you set it to get a M2TS file with AC3 audio, i can get MP4s whit AAC and MKVs whit AC3, or the AVCHD folder wich i dont like, (altough they do run on everithing i put them so far, BDplayers, X360 and PS3) besides that the program is unbelibable good i can get a full 2 pass encode in under 4 hours whit a CORE i7 and 6gigs of DDR3 RAM on one of those ""extreme"" series intel motherboards
ive done a lot of anime movies and the subtitles do get embeded in the movie as long as they are set as default track you can check that whit MKVMERGE GUI and take out any other subs or audios you dont need, ive done almost a docen subtitled anime movies that way, you most likely know this already but it can help you get the Godfather movies done whit subs in the italian parts, also if the subs are in SRT format you can choose font, size, color, position etc... in the vobsub menu."
,bWg4lifeHD,2009-07-18T16:38Z,BRICKTOP just wondering if you are gonna do pirates of the caribbean 2? or if you have already or know if someone else has? can't see it on here or demonoid. cheers
[T],brickop,2009-07-18T17:10Z,i did all 3 pirate movies a while ago
,bWg4lifeHD,2009-07-18T17:47Z,"yep found it,must be going blind. 

@ enritnt just select AVCHD go to audio and select whichever one you want AC3 5.1 ch. or 2ch."
,enritnt,2009-07-19T22:40Z,"i know that already, but i dont want the whole AVCHD folder, i was wondering if the program could do mp4 or mpeg whit AC3 audio, i went to some of the ripbot 264 especific forums and  found out is not posible unles you do AVCHD and take the stream out of the folder or do MKV and run it trough MKV2VOB to get the MPEG, thanks anyway for now ill do the AVCHDs and take out the streams cause im putting my movies on a 1TB external HDD hooked to the ps3 so i didnt need the whole AVCD structure i was a silly question but im kind of a noob at this and i live in venezuela so my english is not all that good so is a little harder for me to go in the net and gather deep core tech info like these"
,NightRyder,2009-07-28T16:20Z,how can you change the audio of these hd movies? cause some audio formats don't work for my speakers like the high end quality i need to get it into dolby digital stuff is there a program in which i can convert just the audio of the mkv files?
,lakeside00,2009-07-30T13:15Z,anyone got a demonoid invite..i have an iptorrents invite to trade..my email is hawkai89@yahoo.com
