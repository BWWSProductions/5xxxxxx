This is an audiobook version of Sam Konkin's short book New Libertarian Manifesto read by Mike Gogulski of nostate.com.


Reader's Introduction:

Good morning, New Libertarian. Good morning, agorist.

The voice you will hear for the next 85 minutes or so belongs to me, Mike Gogulski.

I am a stateless ex-American. I renounced my American citizenship in 2008 and I have been a voluntary exile since 2004, presently living in Bratislava, Slovakia. As of this recording in May 2009, I maintain a website at www.nostate.com, which you are invited to visit.

The words you will hear belong to all of humanity, but they were written by Samuel Edward Konkin III, arguably the initiator of the agorist theory. The book, New Libertarian Manifesto, was first published in 1980, and then updated in 1983.

After two, brief prefaces, the book consists of five chapters:

Statism: Our Condition
Agorism: Our Goal
Counter-Economics: Our Means
Revolution: Our Strategy
Action! Our Tactics

I have attempted to read the text of New Libertarian Manifesto as I have it in hand. Any deviations from the written text â€“ which you can find online at the website agorism.info â€“ are my own.

After listening, please take action.

Agora! Anarchy! Action!
