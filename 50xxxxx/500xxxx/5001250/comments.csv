,BobSacamano,2009-07-15T04:13Z,Apparently you have to wait till after the credits roll to find out something crucial to the movie. Anyone know if this one has it? 
,vincevegapirate,2009-07-15T08:17Z,perfect download. audio is fine. video aint dvd rip quality but its better than a screener.
,Flipmode,2009-07-15T08:28Z,Any subs for this movie?
,bignickdawg,2009-07-15T08:30Z,"It's good quality 

Small aspect ratio though"
,gemineye674,2009-07-15T10:46Z,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen!  Can't say enough about how this movie is great from beginning to end!  A MUST SEE!!!  This torrent is a 10 all the way around.
,kurtizz,2009-07-15T11:59Z,"V 10 A 10!

,encoded evil,2009-07-15T15:56Z,"SU D35

,Phatfish,2009-07-15T18:56Z,"Can someone please tell me what an MKV file is?
And what is the quality like A -? V -?

,Vin-Man,2009-07-15T19:35Z,"I have Nero 7, it won't let Me burn this movie because it's in ""mkv"" format. Does anybody know what to do or do I have to change format & how? Thank-You."
,BigDude12,2009-07-15T19:46Z,Worth pointing out that this is 4:3 letterbox. I should be able to get my player to get it to fill the screen though. Good quality though.
,Cuda168,2009-07-15T21:27Z,Use bs player. it takes mkv. files
,tuxfx,2009-07-15T22:53Z,"DDC = Digital Distribution Copy

well worth the download"
,abbadonsminion,2009-07-16T00:41Z,"Sorry for double post, but 
DDC =Digital Distribution Copy "
,DoomTra1n,2009-07-16T01:17Z,"Soooooo. is this DDC worth it? Or should I just wait for an R5? I already have a pretty damn good cam rip, but I have VERY limited bandwidth so I don't wanna waste a d/l and an u/l for something I already have. It's worth it if it's an R5 or DVD quality. So... this is a 1st I've seen a DDC should I get it ? "
,gorrillaford,2009-07-16T05:21Z,"Not dvd, but still a great copy. As long as I can see the movie clearly and there's no background noise, I'm happy. MANY THANKS TO THE UPLADER!!!

Also, for those who care - The video is a bit off in regards to the aspect ratio, just use VLC to play the file, click on video at the top and choose an aspect ratio of 16:9. Worked great for me."
,lilestrada4u,2009-07-16T06:25Z,what program do i need to have to watch this
,Jincheonkid,2009-07-16T09:49Z,Cheers for this.
,3_3_3,2009-07-16T09:56Z,it won't stream to Xbox 360 because it is a MKV file (not supported).
,OrpheusDude,2009-07-16T23:35Z,Brilliant!  Thanks so much for the torrent!
,ismology,2009-07-17T00:06Z,In soviet union MKV files you
,misterbrick,2009-07-17T01:34Z,"ahhh .mkv

worst. wrapper. ever."
,hjsimp5,2009-07-17T03:55Z,"Thanks, but did you have to make it mkv.  Thats the shittiest file format possible."
,qumahlin,2009-07-17T05:24Z,"""Apparently you have to wait till after the credits roll to find out something crucial to the movie. Anyone know if this one has it?""

That is incorrect.  Nothing happens after the credits, you get shown stuff DURING the credits."
,signalcorps,2009-07-17T14:14Z,"MKV is an open standard and open source container format.  Container shouldn't make any difference to anybody, and if you wanna know, the codec in this container is H.264.  Get a clue if you don't know, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_container_formats , just look at all the green yes' before you post dumby's."
,sleven07,2009-07-17T19:37Z,First off .mkv file is scrap second this quality is scrap and this up loader blows all his shit is nasty download maxspeeds version if u want to enjoy the movie thanks but no thanks .BONE ANYBODY CAN THROW SHIT UP ON THIS SITE PLEASE DONT FEED SHIT ON THE BAY ITS A GREAT TORRENT SITE NOT MEANT FOR GARBAGE UPLOADS 
,jackscolonot,2009-07-17T21:13Z,Quality's not that good and there's a lot of wasted space with it's 4:3 ratio. You may want to skip this torrent and look for something better.
,bbutton1,2009-07-17T21:16Z,"first of all, .mkv is one of the best video formats currently...

for you dumbass freaking children CHANGE the ratio in your player on 16:9...

i haven't downloaded the movie but i'll see... still it shouldn't be a big problem."
,ismology,2009-07-17T22:31Z,"People that are complaining are talking about how it isn't as easy to burn as opposed to an AVI or something similar which is easy to burn.

Not everyone watches movies on their PC's. 

So, button1, are you saying this file is easy to burn by turning your Nero settings to 16:9?"
,jackscolonot,2009-07-17T22:54Z,"bbutton1, download the sample. Changing the ratio just stretches the sides out."
,bbutton1,2009-07-18T00:10Z,"nah... ratio works fine for me...
the thing is the ""black"" stripes are included which is bad, and original size of the video is too small :)
.mkv is easy to burn, I don't know if you use converters to add subtitles... but I never had a problem with it...

It's an okay quality for a movie that's new..."
,bbutton1,2009-07-18T00:13Z,"and by player I meant DVD player...
If that doesn't work then use a converter and put a proper ratio.

But I think it's not worth watching this.
Way too low quality. Watching it on IPod is another thing :D It would give you excellent quality but it sucks watching it on a small screen :D"
,amiable_kinkajou,2009-07-18T00:38Z,This is crap
,jackscolonot,2009-07-18T03:13Z,"Yeah, this could be the right size/quality for an Ipod, but for watching on a computer or a television it just doesn't cut it. There's another torrent that claims to be a screener."
,kbowk2,2009-07-18T11:23Z,"Just watched Sample.  Perfect quality, worth downloading.  Cheers.  This is still in Cinemas in Aus ATM."
,Sativa85,2009-07-18T17:05Z,"Download better version

Good Qualty
And AWSOME MOVIE"
,olmenvk,2009-07-18T17:49Z,"love this movie, its not in the WOW -katagori but its nice."
,xmassacre,2009-07-18T20:23Z,"Great Quality
A-9
V-8
Thanks

Oh and if anyones a bit pissed about it being an mkv file, just use format factory to convert to avi:   http://www.formatoz.com/
Worked great for me, audio and video stayed n sync and works perfect on xbox 360. 
Thanks again"
,Bigzook,2009-07-19T05:22Z,"Great movie and good copy. Not quite DVD quality but very close. 
Say 
V-8
A-8
Wife and I laughed our asses off."
,Bigzook,2009-07-19T05:24Z,Oh and VLC player had no problem with the MKV format. I just had to resize the aspect ratio to meet the 16X10 of my TV.
,hibbert92,2009-07-19T22:55Z,thanks to the uploader will seed
,Carl52,2009-07-20T03:00Z,"very good movie and nice rip 
a-9
v-8"
,adelarge655321,2009-07-20T12:01Z,"I don't understand these people whining about the ratio (which is fine, it's just got a black box around it - not even that distracting) and it being a .mkv file (which works great with VLC - well, no probs here anyway).

A: 9,5
V: 9

M: I really thought it wasn't that funny - throughout the whole movie, I didn't laugh out loud once. Well-made and good acting, though. Could be it's just me.

Anyways, .BONE., thanks for a great-quality torrent!"
,tsArchitin,2009-07-23T00:13Z,"Sorry 4 perhaps a stupid q, but why is there a ""ARS logo"" sometimes in the lower right corner?"
,vilza86,2009-07-28T20:47Z,"A-8 V-7 not so good q but still the best one yet..
thanks though.."
,smnigel,2009-08-21T08:07Z,"Haven't watched the movie yet but as for quality
A=8.5(Not loud enough)
V=9(Seems kinda blurred)

Regardless, Thank you BONE"
