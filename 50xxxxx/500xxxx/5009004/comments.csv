[T],MajorTJKong,2009-07-21T20:09Z,"Can't anyone do a BRRip of LOTR trilogy yet, since it's never been released on blu-ray. 

Trust me, whenever it becomes available, there will be a TON of blu-ray rips of it."
,markinthecity,2009-07-22T11:14Z,I don't understand one. This is a BRRip and takes only 2.12 GB ?.....

""This is a BRRip and takes only 2.12 GB""
Sounds like you understand just fine. 

Just download the sample if you have any doubts. click on my name and look at some of my previous uploads & the comments on them. "
,utptube,2009-07-25T12:17Z,Thanks for this upload major....but what I don't understand is secretmyth is now uploading with correct aspect ratio(2.35) and you still seem to be working on 2.42!!(referring to your latest LA confidential and Swordfish) You guys are using 1080p sources now and I believe you can add a bitmore height(544) to the resolution.
[T],MajorTJKong,2009-07-27T07:52Z,"utptube,

It all depends on the actual res of the source. Some 2.35 films may allow a full crop (1280x544 = 2.353 AR) or if it is actually just a row of pixels shorter than that (many 2.35 films are) it will force a crop to the next nearest mod-16 resolution (both horiz & vert pixel counts divisible by 16 for playback compatibility) which is 1280x528 (2.424 AR). That's why some 2.35 films are cropped like that and others aren't, because many films labeled as 2.35 are actually just shy of a true 2.35. The only way to get a 2.35 out of it would be to include some black bar in the picture or stretch it to fit. It's even worse on a DVD, where many so-called 2.35 AR are actually as far off as a 2.5 AR (720x288). I must have more than a dozen DVDs like that. The Benjamin Button DVD is one that comes to mind. 

Anywho, I don't do any cropping at all on a BRRip. That cropping to the nearest mod-16 res is done by whoever encoded the BDRip source in the first place. I only downsize the res to a 720p one. "

Anyway one request and one question.
Can any of you 3 good guys please rip: Defiance (2008) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034303/
It would be greatly appreciated and well seeded of course by yours truly.
My question was what is the exact difference between a 480p and a 720p BrRip?
Anyway thx in advance and thx for all the great work you guys have done so far!

,baybeh,2011-11-21T08:07Z,i'm a bit confused here. Is this the original aspect ratio?
,baybeh,2011-11-22T10:29Z,Shitty rip. Grainy and pixillated. Why can't someone do a 6 to 8GB 720p rip?
