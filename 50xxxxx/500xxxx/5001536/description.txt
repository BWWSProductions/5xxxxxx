This is an audiobook version of Wally Conger's short book Agorist Class Theory read by Mike Gogulski of nostate.com. The book is based off of the work of Samuel Edward Konkin III.


Reader's Introduction:

Good morning, New Libertarian. Good morning, agorist.

The voice you will hear for the next 47 minutes or so belongs to me, Mike Gogulski.

I am a stateless ex-American. I renounced my American citizenship in 2008 and I have been a voluntary exile since 2004, presently living in Bratislava, Slovakia. As of this recording in May 2009, I maintain a website at www.nostate.com, which you are invited to visit.

The words you will hear belong to all of humanity, but they were written by Wally Conger, drawing on the unfinished work of Samuel Edward Konkin III, arguably the initiator of the agorist theory. The book, Agorist Class Theory: A Left-Libertarian Approach to Class Conflict Analysis, was published in 2006, both as a free online PDF and in print combination with Konkinâ€™s seminal New Libertarian Manifesto.

After a foreword by veteran analyst and agitator Brad Spangler and an introduction by Wally Conger, the book consists of nine brief chapters:

    * The Failure of Marxism
    * The Marxist Appeal
    * Precursors to Marxist Class Theory
    * Marxist Classes
    * The Agorist Critique of Marxist Class Theory
    * Libertarian Class Analysis
    * Radical Libertarian Class Analysis
    * Agorist Class Theory (and finally)
    * Agorist Solutions for Marxist Problems

I have attempted to read the text of Agorist Class Theory as I have it in hand. Any deviations from the written text â€“ which you can find online at the website agorism.info â€“ are my own. In the interest of brevity and due to its referential density, the Appendix â€“ entitled, â€œCui Bono? Introduction to Libertarian Class Theoryâ€, written by Konkin in 1973 â€“ has been omitted from this recording. The Appendix is available in the PDF and print versions of the book, and is well worth reading.

It is my hope that listening to Agorist Class Theory serves to raise your class consciousness, and that you not only adopt the class theory in looking at the world around you, but apply it to yourself as well.

After listening, take action.

Agora! Anarchy! Action!
