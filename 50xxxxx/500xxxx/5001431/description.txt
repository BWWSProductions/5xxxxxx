Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986) is a Canadian actor and recording artist. He originally became known for playing Jimmy Brooks, the basketball star that became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate on Degrassi: The Next Generation. As a rapper, he performs under the mononym Drake. Drake continued to recognize a close affiliation with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, before officially signing with the record label in June, 2009. His first studio album, Thank Me Later, is expected to be released on the label in late 2009.


Tracklist:
1) Drake Ft. Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy & Truth - I'm Going In (Dirty) (4:39)
2) DRAKE FT YOUNG JEEZY & LIL WAYNE - IM GOING IN (DIRTY) (3:46)
3) Lil Wayne feat. Drake & Truth - Im Goin In (3:32)


The first track is my mix which include Drake, Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy and Truth. Truth verse is perfectly blended in after Young Jeezy verse.


All three tracks are high quality and are uncensored (Dirty).

ENJOY and LEAVE a FEEDBACK! :-D
