Last Call with Carson Daly - June 4, 2009

Carson hosts from Bob's Big Boy restaurant in Burbank CA, where burgers are plentiful and there's space to hang out.

Guests: the TV personality and adrenaline junkie Jesse James who welcomes Carson to his West Coast Choppers warehouse in Long Beach, CA (see last night's Last Call), and talks about his new hit show Jesse James Is A Dead Man (on Spike TV), the clever young standup comic Dwayne Perkins, and the legendary and influential rock band The Cure.

Note
