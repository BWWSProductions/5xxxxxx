VA-The Motown Story-25 Years Of Great Original Hits-cd 1-6

Eric-Jan Overbeek (1967) had his first piano lessons at the age of eight and began his musical career playing classical piano in church. At fourteen, he heard Fats Domino play the Swanee River Hop and it became clear that he wanted to be a boogie-woogie man. Soon he discovered Dutch boogie players like AndrÃ© Valkering and the legendary Rob Hoeke, who became a good friend until he passed away in 1999. Of course he listened to Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis and Pete Johnson (the three â€œkings of boogie- woogieâ€) but being invited on stage by Hoeke and Valkering influenced his playing even more. Other influences include Dr.John, Ray Charles and unexpectedly guitarists B.B.King and the Master of the Telecaster Albert Collins. Eric-Jan has always been stunned by so much power in blues. 
Since 1990 he fronts his own band Mr.Boogie Woogie & the Firesweep Bluesband, a rhythm and blues band with as â€œspecialitÃ© de la maisonâ€ : boogie-woogie!

A show by Mr.Boogie Woogie is a sensational event. His remarkable sound, his energy and enthusiasm, it sets the place on fire.

An active man like Mr. Boogie Woogie should not be confined to one country. So he expands his horizons and besides the Netherlands he now plays all over Europe and made his debut in the United States in September 2001. Just a year later Mr.Boogie Woogie played in Chicago, New York, Memphis, Clarksdale, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Phoenix, Flagstaff and his favourite US city: Tucson. Thatâ€™s where he and a brand new band called â€œMr.Boogie Woogie & the Hot Wingsâ€ recorded his best selling CD â€œTheyâ€™re wings...theyâ€™re hot!â€ featuring the amazing Grams & Krieger. In 2006 and in the company of the many of the world's best blues artists, Mr.Boogie Woogie has won the prestigious title of Best European Blues Pianist
