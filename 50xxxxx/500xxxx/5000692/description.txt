Josep Maria Carreras i Coll (born 5 December 1946, Barcelona), better known as JosÃ© Carreras, is a Spanish Catalan tenor particularly known for his performances in the operas of Verdi and Puccini. He made his debut on the opera stage at the age of 11 as TrujamÃ¡n in Manuel de Falla's El retablo de Maese Pedro and went on to a career that encompassed over 60 roles on the stages of the world's leading opera houses and in the recording studio. He gained fame with a wider audience as one of The Three Tenors along with PlÃ¡cido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti in a series of mass concerts that began in 1990 and continued until 2003. Carreras is also known for his humanitarian work as the president of the JosÃ© Carreras International Leukemia Foundation (La FundaciÃ³ Internacional Josep Carreras per a la Lluita contra la LeucÃ¨mia), which he established following his own recovery from the disease in 1988.
