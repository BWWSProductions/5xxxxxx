Martial arts legend Jackie Chan stars in this mystical, fantasy adventure as an intrepid archaeologist, Jack, who sets out on an adventure that would lead to the greatest discovery in Chinese history. In BC221 Qin Shihuang the first emperor of China started to build a royal tomb for himself despite his infatuation with immortality. Through the prodigious endeavors of more than 700,000 forced labourers, the mausoleum was completed 37 years later. Legend has it that to ensure utmost secrecy, all those who worked on the project were buried alive with the dead emperor. Over the next 2,000 years historians, tomb-raiders and happy-go-lucky adventurers alike had been honing in on the royal treasure, however, no one had ever succeeded in location the entrance to the mausoleumuntil now.
