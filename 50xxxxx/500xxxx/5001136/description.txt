The world will never know what really happened at Mayerling, the Imperial Hunting Lodge of Crown Prince Rudolf. We were told it was a romantic tragedy but this movie portrays it quite different.

When the movie begins the tragedy has already happened. We witness the burial of Mary Vetsera and see the funeral procession held for the Crown Prince. Soon we go back in time and we witness the depressed Crown Prince falling in love with the young Mary Vetsera. As the end comes near we are told that the tragedy was no suicide-pact but a political assassination.

The movie is in French, without subtitles.
