,evilkuja,2009-07-13T21:30Z,"Thanks! Been loving your uploads from the start, but just a few notes on the problems i've had on this episode. 

The sound gets really screwy in this episode, mainly at 04:49, this was on Windows Media Player, VLC Media Player couldn't play the sound at all.

Episode 132 played perfect with no problems, though."
,Neo-Dark,2009-07-15T03:59Z,"There appear to be some audio problems for me too... I myself use Gold Media Player, and if I use the time skip stuff to skip forwards 10 seconds or whatever (it doesn't have fast forward) then the audio restarts from the beginning of the intro.

Side note; It says in Windows Explorer its time is 157:44:44... As in it believes it lasts over 157 hours."
,jubs19,2009-07-21T00:11Z,"You have amazing torrents Soagg and I look forward to all your updates. I have had the same issue as well. Says its 157 hours and really doesn't play audio or video in most players(wmp, vlc or zoom)"
,exeon_Zechs,2009-08-05T10:14Z,"I have the sound issues too, with VLC. I'm a mac user and havn't had any luck with quicktime playing it at all. I'm going to try to rencode it and see if it'll work after that, of course it doesn't help anyone else."
,nvmiele,2009-08-09T20:07Z,131 gave me trouble as well using VLC. The sound is completely messed up and even the playback is sketchy. No matter Soagg still is the champ when it comes to quality and I suspect he'll have this taken care of.
,MaXiMiUS,2009-08-10T03:52Z,"Audio is fucked up, download a different torrent, seriously."
,ZanpakutoUnleased,2011-01-22T00:39Z,"You people are retarted, Run the audio with WMP and the video with VLC..... no problems.  I wouldnt suggest getting caught up on on this episode, since there are roughly 100 more.  Try the method I explained first and move on to a better episode.
Amazing uploads keep it up, You have my thanks soagg."
