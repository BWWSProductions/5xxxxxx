,AngryAmoeba,2009-07-15T03:51Z,the sound in the sample seems out of sync. hope it's not the same with the whole movie.
,AngryAmoeba,2009-07-15T05:55Z,^ it is. just use a player that can offset audio i guess.
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-01-06T23:12Z,"BRRip XviD ?
lol, this sounds like driving a Porche on a muddy field and a Range Rover on a highway.
 H-264 is the king!!!
 Xvid ruins the blue ray quality.
 what a waste!
video bitrae : 2700 ? is this a  joke?
 I bet a 2.2 GB H.264 rip (2800kB/s) of an ordinary (720/576 ar) DVD has a clearer picture then a 4.2 GB  ""BRRip xvid"".
Pls BOZX, don't take it too personal, I said it in general that people learn. 
thx for your effort but I'll search for a H.264 rip."
