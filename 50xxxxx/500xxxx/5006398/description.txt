Steve Matthews rejoins "Dicks Diamonds'" Dick Strawbridge and Jim Milner for this second Water Power challenge.

Their three challengers : "Beasts Of Bodmin", "The Masters" and "New Forest Hillbillies".

Today's challenge - once again build water powered machines and re-challenge "The Diamonds".

Help me seed & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

I'm adding one episode a day Mon - Fri as they air on ABC2 digital TV here in Australia. (We're getting them before the UK).
