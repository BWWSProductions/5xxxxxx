Lyrics:

I work down at the Pizza Pit
And I drive an old Hyundai
I still live with my mom and dad
I'm 5 foot 3 and overweight
I'm a scifi fanatic
A mild asthmatic
And I've never been to second base
But there's whole â€˜nother me
That you need to see
Go checkout MySpace

'Cause online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm 6 foot 5 and I look damn good
I drive a Maserati
I'm a black-belt in karate
And I love a good glass of wine
It turns girls on that Iâ€™m mysterious
I tell them I don't want nothing serious
'Cause even on a slow day
I could have a three way
Chat with two women at one time
Iâ€™m so much cooler online
So much cooler online

When I get home I kiss my mom
And she fixes me a snack
And I head down to my basement bedroom
And fire up my mac
In real life the only time Iâ€™ve ever even been to L.A
Is when I got the chance with the marching band
To play tuba in the Rose Parade

Online I live in Malibu
I pose for Calvin Klein, I've been in GQ
I'm single and I'm rich
And I've got a set of six pack abs that would blow your mind
It turns girls on that Iâ€™m mysterious
I tell them I don't want nothing serious
'Cause even on a slow day
I could have a three way
Chat with two women at one time
Iâ€™m so much cooler online
Yeah, I'm cooler online

When you got my kind of stats
Itâ€™s hard to get a date
Let alone a real girlfriend
But I grow another foot and I lose a bunch of weight
Every time I login

Online
Iâ€™m out in Hollywood
Iâ€™m 6 foot 5 and I look damn good
Even on a slow day
I could have a three way
Chat with two women at one time
Iâ€™m so much cooler online
Yeah, Iâ€™m cooler online
Iâ€™m so much cooler online
Yeah, Iâ€™m cooler online

Yeah, Iâ€™m cooler online

Yeah, Iâ€™ll see ya online
