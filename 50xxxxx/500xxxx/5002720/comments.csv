,lydonit13,2009-07-15T17:47Z,"FYI: there are two tracks 11
/Horehound [FLAC]/11 - Will There Be Enough Water .flac
/Horehound [FLAC]/11 - Will There Be Enough Water.flac
One has a {space} before the file extension.  Not a big deal, they appear identical otherwise.  Just remember to delete one before burning to a CD."

,CrefIo,2009-07-31T01:18Z,"Thanks a lot for adding the videos.  This shows a real dedication as a fan.

Just so you know, however, there's no audio for the second 'Treat Me Like Your Mother' video...the one with the bomb at the beginning with Jack holding the machine gun.  

Simple enough to add this in when making my DVD.

Thanks again!"
