The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien - June 3, 2009

Basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar tests out the studio's tunnel entrance.
Conan and Andy look into the future... in the year 2000, no, 3000 (when GM will announce a new car model, the Scrotum).

Guests: 2-time Emmy Award winning comedic actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, aka Dreyf, (she apparently is an Oscar winner wannabe - Jack McBrayer, who plays the good-hearted dorky page on 30 Rock, makes a cameo appearance), the star of the comedy feature film "Hangover" Bradley Cooper, aka Coop, and Sheryl Crow doing a reprise of the single "Run, Baby, Run" from Conan's premiere on TV back in 1993.
