Finger on the trigger
Let it bang bang, baby let it bang
I donâ€™t give a damn Cause Iâ€™m a rebel kind 
Watch me do my thang

Let me introduce you to my Lucy 
I donâ€™t care if you like me
(Iâ€™ll walk it out on â€˜em)
Running from the law
Iâ€™ll hit the borderline 
They trying to trap me
So letâ€™s get down baby

Iâ€™ll be locking and loading
Iâ€™ll be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And Iâ€™ll maybe let you
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And Iâ€™ll maybe let you 

Bang, Bang (Iâ€™ll maybe let you)
Bang, Bang (Iâ€™ll maybe let you)

Ainâ€™t nothing like the feeling of that cold cold metal in my hand
Know I sound psycho, Daddy-o, youâ€™ll never understand
Let me introduce you my chrome-plated bullet
She shining
(Iâ€™ll whip it out on â€˜em)
Understand my â€™45 chevy ride scraping the highway
Top down, pick it up

Iâ€™ll be locking and loading
Iâ€™ll be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And Iâ€™ll maybe let you
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And Iâ€™ll maybe let you 

Bang, Bang (Iâ€™ll maybe let you)
Bang, Bang (Iâ€™ll maybe let you)
