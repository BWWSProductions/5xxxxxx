[V],martin_edguy,2009-07-18T14:55Z,"Lion0711 .. go to the shop and buy Motion plus..

,fewegs,2009-07-18T17:54Z,"I have to say, and I'm sorry to say it... 
But this game was boring.
You'll probably think this is wierd, but I liked the first wii sports better. Even I think thats wierd.

anyways the boling was kinda fun, felt almost the same as the first one and shooting arrows was kinda fun for a moment :D"
,Gothlike,2009-07-18T20:21Z,Thanks for this :)
,DanLawn,2009-07-18T21:39Z,is this game in English?
,obliq,2009-07-19T13:25Z,"@fewegs

How did you make it work on your Wiikey?

I used wiiUR to remove the system update, but when I start the game it's just black screen.

Did you use the system update included in the disk?

My firmware is 3.3E"
,NICKE7,2009-07-19T14:40Z,cant get it to work. Burned it 3 times. I have wiikey i think.
,ActionWaction,2009-07-19T15:05Z,Works on my Wiikey 2
,DanLawn,2009-07-19T18:01Z,"Is there any way to play without Wii Motion Plus
I got the game to load but it says connect Motion Plus! Is there a way around this?"
,NICKE7,2009-07-19T19:31Z,"I have wiikey 1 and updated to http://www.wiikey.cn/static/downloads/legacy/wiikey.1.9s.PAL.rar, but the shit doesnt start."
,weisguy,2009-07-19T20:14Z,Thanks a bunch!  No problems w/Wii Key 2 and Gecko OS.  
,NightZhai,2009-07-19T21:04Z,Anyone got this working on a US Wii (NTSC system wii)? Or does it work with US Wii at all?
,Hanks49,2009-07-19T22:06Z,"confirmed 100% working on a softmii'd (softmii 2.1 package) PAL Wii running 3.2E firmware.

slapped on the IOS 38 rev13a beforehand (as commented on) to make sure all wii functionality is up to date.

obviously the game requires a motion-plus add-on too :)"
,NightZhai,2009-07-20T15:06Z,"Thx for answer, by the way, what's the difference between this one, 1,09 GB, and the one that is 4,5 GB?"
,pxf31,2009-07-20T15:28Z,I can't get this to work on D2Sun v1.3a chip. Any one managed to get this game working on that chip?
,blckshdw,2009-07-20T15:45Z,"I get Error #002, what can i do?"
,mrinsane117,2009-07-20T22:11Z,Im VERY new to this. How do I get this onto my Wii after I download it? What is Wiikey?
,Jouco,2009-07-20T22:28Z,"Thanks a million!! Burned with imgburn at 1x, played it on wii modded with drivekey, worked 100%!! Fantastic game, this will bring new life to my wii. 

Difference between this and the 4,4 gig is that this one is scrubbed, when you unpack it, winrar will automatically fill in the blanks and create a 4 point something gig file. "
,dakhguy,2009-07-21T14:24Z,"now im am running on D2sun i believe 1.6 or 1.8, now even though i have this may i still install the softmii, because this doesn't seem to work and judging by a few comments softmii. 

Much appreciated."
[V],martin_edguy,2009-07-22T13:24Z,"blckshdw.. you nedd to install the undercover files, so you can play every game with the #002 problem..google for the file,use twiligt hack,or wad manager if you have hombrew channel.. or download gecko os 002 fix channel.. or gecko Gecko 1.9.1 "
,FCE,2009-07-23T22:09Z,"I got Black Screen after clicking on Start.
I'm using Wii NTSC USA - with WiiKey 2.
Good media, and burnt with low speedy.
The first DVD I used the wiibrickblocker, and the second I just burnt the iso, both the same result.

Any ideas?"
,halmo20,2009-07-24T01:55Z,"For those that have black screen after 'start' button.

Here is what I did.  I have early version of wii key. USA Wii

-Install Homebrew Channel
-Install Homebrew browser
-Use Homebrew browser to download latest Gecko OS
-Install Gecko OS
-Run Gecko OS.  Go to config.  Force NTSC
-Pop burnt DVD
-USE Gecko OS to launch game.

Bam! Worked just like that.

I was a complete noob to homebrew and all other games worked prior to this one.  About 15 min. of googling and all done.  Good luck."

,Lolmen,2009-09-28T20:17Z,"For the ones who say it doesn't work: Check if you actually do have a WII with Pal, and not with NTSF. Because if you do, the game won't work anyway."
