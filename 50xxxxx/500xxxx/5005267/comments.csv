,ursak,2009-07-15T21:46Z,This is something I beg for all of you to buy. Make em do a remake of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. Please buy this!
,buzz_uk,2009-07-15T22:19Z,First played this back on the amiga. Classic game. Should be fun. Thanks for uploading.
,CavemanLawyer,2009-07-15T23:13Z,"While I agree with Ursak, I'm not going beg people to buy this game, as I've downloaded way too much to tell people to buy stuff, ha.

  Just this friendly reminder - LucasArts decided to see if adventure games are economically viable again with this venture here.  They even stated they will remake their older catalog and bring out more sequels (Grim Fandango, Full Throttle, Day of the Tentacle etc.) if these ventures pay off. 

 There have been maybe 1 adventure game released every year or so.  If you do like these games, then think about buying SMI:SE and TMI.  This game here is only 10 dollars.  Just think about it is all I'm saying.  I'm downloading it now to see if its worth that 10 dollars.

And good speeds seeders.  Thanks a bunch!"
,scewy,2009-07-15T23:28Z,"Fuck you ursak, get off piratebay if you don't like sharing."
,darlakk,2009-07-16T02:40Z,"Support support support, adventure games need to generate revenue so we get more of them that we can download for free!"
,Afiniasmenos,2009-07-16T03:21Z,"ursak speaks wise.  Support adventures if you like them. I downloading it, just because i want it now. It's not in the stores in my country yet. When it came i'll buy it. My best is Monkey Island 2 and Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (3). If the sales goes well, they will make others also. Support them. Those oldies are not very expensive."
,Daworox,2009-07-16T03:43Z,"We really should buy this great classic adventure game for only 8,99? and hope they will make more remakes ;)"
,manuelcalavera,2009-07-16T05:58Z,"Just bought this on xbox live about 5 min ago, it would be nice to have a PC copy too. But please do buy this and the Tales of Monkey Island. Adventure games are dying if not dead, show Lucasarts there is still a market, I want Grim Fandango 2!!!"
,Mancomb,2009-07-16T07:44Z,It says to copy over the cracked content; where or what exactly is this content? I can't seem to find it. :/
,Mancomb,2009-07-16T07:51Z,"Nevermind, I'm dumb; I found the little bugger. :D I loved the original, so it's time to see if this is worth buying; if it is, I'll gladly give LucasArts the money for it. $10 is a GREAT deal."

,darknight670,2009-07-16T10:36Z,"People who do not like this game do not deserve to live.

Support is important...especially

,meatbag666,2009-07-16T14:02Z,"So how do i isntall it. Ive ""installed"" the game but it wont start."
,cookie-tm,2009-07-16T15:55Z,"I'm not about to make anyone purchase this release. But keep in mind that sales numbers might have some influence on the propability of future releases. What you get here is a deep story with hilarious jokes for a budget price. Lucas has many more classical point and click adventures that could be brought back to life if this one sells well.

otoh you might consider this special edition another attempt to make money with old ideas given a new look."
,Eulo,2009-07-16T16:43Z,"I REALLY don't like the voice acting, it all sounds really bad.  Guybrush also looks a bit silly... but hit f10 for some badass transitions between the old style / new style, that was the best part.

Only reason I'm not buying this is because I've bought 2 copies of it, one on floppy and one on CD, way back in the day.  I think I deserve it.  Haha."
,e4e4c4,2009-07-16T19:09Z,This is one of those few games you really should buy. 
,Chiknweave,2009-07-16T20:50Z,"Can all the people saying buy this game shut the fuck up?You're a goddamn moron if you think you'll get even 10 people from here to buy the game AFTER they've owned it for free.

So just stop 'cause if people actually wanted to  buy this game they wouldn't be on TPB leeching the torrent."
,roymunson,2009-07-16T22:45Z,i promise i will buy this game too when i get money (I'm a student with no money in the summer) and i hope ppl sponsor the makers of MI games.. Thanx LucasArts!!
,Pietrzej,2009-07-17T00:06Z,"Buy this, really, if you like the game, buy this :)"
,Torrentzzze1,2009-07-17T14:17Z,Is this a game to waste time on downloading? ;D
,DigChrono,2009-07-17T20:25Z,"I LOVED this game way back on my 98
definitely should buy this, if you can, just to support the series, Lucas Arts needs to remake/make more of these (that don't suck)"
,snazy23,2009-07-17T21:03Z,ok i'm kinda a nub at this stuff so how do i copy over the cracked content...anybody? help would be appreciated...love this series
,snazy23,2009-07-17T21:20Z,everytime i try to run game it says application load errer 5:00000065434
,xiIix,2009-07-17T23:57Z,If someone doesn't like this game then they don't like the game. It doesn't make them any less a person. Some of you need to grow the fuck up and pull your head out of your ass. Not everyone is going to be into the games you are. There's no need to flame someone just because they think this game sucks balls.
,Daworox,2009-07-18T01:06Z,"Monkey Island series is a LEGEND! All people age 29 and up know what I'm talking about. In my days this games were the reason to buy Amiga ;)

So yes - I think the remake is definitely worth 10$ (or 9EUR). Please Lucas Arts make remake of all others great adventures as well.."
,Cellsplitter,2009-07-18T02:23Z,"Thx for this release, but I'll buy he game anyway. MONKEY ISLAND FTW ^_^!! "

,d4maniac,2009-07-19T19:54Z,"####BUY THIS GAME####

造SUPPORT THE REVIVAL OF THE GENRE THAT MADE OUR CHILDHOOD WHAT IT WAS造

momcilo92 You need to download the driver and put in your system folder.

Also you will most probably need the directx update.

I believe people that had problems were forced to download two files and put them in the sys folder.

SUPPORT LUCASARTS!!!!

BUY MONKEY ISLAND TSE!!!

This game was believe or not, quite costly still, and they are selling it for a mere 10 dollars...

Perhaps we will see the return of Indiana Jones, Guybrush Threepwood and who knows; perhaps a certain hooded character might find his mother. ;)"
,earwax5,2009-07-20T04:04Z,"I downloaded directx and fixed the audio error. But now I get application 5.0000000whatever. I keep reading people saying copy the the content in the cracked folder.

,Evool,2009-07-21T10:21Z,"It actually DOES work. Downloaded it in one day and started playing.
Only thing I can complain about is that I wasn't born early enough to truly appreciate the games original version. I have to say that 'switching' from the original version to the current version (F10) is pretty neat. 
I'd have to say this kind of game doesn't really peak my interest very much. Not really the type of game I expected."
,NeverSwank,2009-07-21T11:58Z,"Please go and buy this game from Steam or Direct Download instead of torrenting it. Its really very cheap and if you want to play it then chances are you were a fan of the original. They're only a small team and if there are enough purchases then they'll likely make a remake of Monkey Island 2. 

This isn't some big time developer selling overpriced games with millions of sales, its a small development team working on something mainly for the fans of the series, charging relatively little and the 1000 odd downloads from torrent sites will definitely be noticed by them."

Actually, it's LucasArts remilking one of their old series they killed when they kicked out the original team and thought Point & Clicks weren't hip anymore.

If you're gonna buy a monkey island game this summer, it better be ToMI by Telltale."

I'm a bit of a newb to downloading games on her so I'm not up to speed on cracks and what not.  Basically, I've downloaded the game, installed it and everytime I click on""MIS.exe"" it gives me an application error.  

That said, I don't know whether or not I've used the crack...

,JDFan,2009-07-23T00:57Z,@educator3 - Mount the iso image in daemon tools like you were unstalling but go to explore the file on the disk - from explorer find the crack folder and inside it you will find a copy of the MISE.exe file copy\paste that file to the folder thaat you installed the game to replace the original that as placed there by installing the game ( This is the cracked file that allows this non legit version of the game to bypass the copy protection inside the original MISE file if you do not replace the original file with the cracked one it will give you the error you mention since you do not have the protection disabled !!)

,azzatribe,2009-07-24T11:35Z,"if your getting crashing problems try this it worked for me


Here's the fix:

Find the settings.ini file. It's located:

Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\LucasArts\The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition\

Vista: (And maybe 7, not sure, don't have 7)
C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\LucasArts\The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition\
For Vista, you'll need to make sure hidden folders are shown. Google it.

Edit that with notepad. You should see the following:


Code:
[localization]
language=0
[display]
windowed=0
shaders=1
resolution=1440x900
[audio]
music=100
voice=100
sfx=100
subtitles=1
Change the resolution= to read whatever you need it to. If you're unsure of your max resolution, just change it to:

resolution=640x480

Then launch the game and change the resolution in the options to whatever you want.


Enjoy!"
,azzatribe,2009-07-25T07:55Z,i have brought the game though steam payed my $9.99 i just like to try before i buy
,sblonci65,2009-07-25T19:06Z,language?
,Sweeper0,2009-07-26T06:01Z,"NeverSwank is correct in that you should support the developers by buying this game, but only if you actually like it. The actual development team are big fans of the original and the possibility of remaking the 2nd one directly depends on the sales of this. See below.

""""I think LeChuck's Revenge would be awesome to revisit, but at this time we have no plans for future updates,"" LucasArts producer Craig Derrick told Destructoid. ""It all comes down to whether people like what we've done with the Special Edition and see the potential for future projects. Sales are definitely an important measurement of this, but so is fan and critical reaction to the game.""

Derrick wants the Monkey Island revival to not only bring back old fans but get new people interested in the series and point-and-click adventure games as well. If things work out this way, he'll see about doing more. ""If both parties show up, enjoy the game and want to see more then I think we'll be on the right path to not only do more updates, but all new adventures,"" he said."""
,jo2thenah,2009-07-26T16:30Z,"i can't find the crack folder for the life of me. ok this is what happens: i mount it on daemon-->go to the folder-->all that's there is the rld-mise IMAGE-->when i click that the game just installs.
i can't find the crack!"
,ck1337,2009-07-26T17:32Z,"If you are having the problem where it keeps automatically going to the menu (as if you have pressed ""escape"") then I have found the solution! It took me a while but it finally occurred to me to try setting the process's affinity to only one processor. I have a dual core AMD. Anyway, to fix it, just run the game and then open up your task manager (CTRL ALT DEL) and find MISE.exe on the process list. Right click it and then click 'Set Affinity...'
Then just uncheck one of the checkboxes next to either CPU 0 or CPU 1 (it doesn't matter which) so that MISE.exe is only using one core. BAM! Problem solved.

Holy shit, I rock.

Also, if you are having that .dll problem, of course just install the latest version of direct X - that fixes it (it did for me). I just finished beating the game. It's super awesome. I hope they do LeChuck's Revenge! Enjoy!"

--Dude, wtf is up with stupid people who can't do something SO simple? Listen up, retards: The crack is in a fucking folder called (yeap, you guessed it) ""Crack"" on the .iso. After you mount the FUCKING ISO or burn it to a disc, you view the files on the disc and there's a god damn folder right there called ""crack"" (just like on like every other god damn release from Reloaded). Inside the folder is MISE.exe. You just copy that and paste it into the fucking folder where the game is installed (usually ""program files"" you piece of shit) You over-write the old MISE.exe with the one from the crack folder. There, are you happy now that I held your hand and walked you through something that's as simple as taking a shit? God damn you fucking retards piss me off.

Well the purpose of fair torrenting is to give the consumer a taste of what the software real feels like and if you dont like it, you dont buy it, but if you did like it you will support the person or company that made the software by purchasing the product.

I did the directx 10 and 9 redistributable and directx in folder thing... none of them worked (maybe because I'm past the dll prob). what i need is to get past the window that displays giberish as i load the game. it looks like the start menu of the game but it's all giberish and b&W. pls help.

[T],Quazza,2009-10-09T23:55Z,I would totally buy this game if it wasn't for the use of Steam...I hate that I have to have a secondary program to play games. Thanks for this up!
,SUNBO,2009-11-27T18:31Z,"Getting problem like a few of you upon starting the game. The credit just keeps on rolling after clicking ""play new game"", there's nothing you can do to skip it. The keys don't work, the mouse button don't work. The only keys that work are space bar and Esc, which pauses the game for menu.

Heard good things about this promising game. I may buy it, but I have to see if it actually works on my shitty comp."

,ArturotheRed,2009-12-26T09:46Z,downloaded - un-rar'd burnt iso with magic iso. installed. copied crack from burnt cd and pasted into monkey island directory in program files on C:. overwrite mise file. run game with new mise file. get blotched screen. and thats it. installed direct x from so named folder on C: no diff. have looked in documents settings application data lucas arts with show hidden files clicked - nothing there folder empyy. am running windows xp. any ideas? ps even ran microsofy.net files made no diff.

,Ascobol,2010-01-05T02:11Z,"Please guys, buy this game. It's only 10 euros on Steam, and it would support the people who bothered to remake this classic. If you buy it, then they may remake the other remaining Monkey Island story."
,latimer,2010-01-19T12:18Z,"to works fine, get direct x latest version."
,Shadiac,2010-01-24T00:31Z,"Don't listen to those fucktards telling you to buy it to support this that nya nya nya
It's all lies. Lucasarts actually pays people to sit on these websites and write this stuff because they see they can't do shit to prevent piracy.
Just FYI, Armato, who voices Guybrush in Tales, had a two-million dollars contract for the two games. So don't tell me to support quests by paying for them, they earn billions of their stupid Star Wars for kids franchise already, they're just not interested to make quests, that's all."
,wufta,2010-01-25T07:02Z,"i actually think 10.00 is totally worth it; and i would buy it except i don't think it runs on my system -- i've updated to dx9.0c and .net 3.5, and when i run the mise.exe  file, a blank window comes up and freezes.  maybe if i buy it will somehow work but i dont' want to risk it."
,Shadiac,2010-01-25T08:20Z,"@wufta - you need dx 10, and read some pages here you have useful info on how to run. btw, if it's not a steam error you won't fix it even if you buy the game - you'll just lose your money.

I played it for like 2-3 hours and I gotta say it's a pretty crappy remake. First of all, the drawings are nice but their animation is terrible - Guybrush's feet don't touch the ground of several occasions, there are numerous music problems, and some shitass animators decided to add a dock with some ships as well as a fucking huge moon to the dock's background. Come on, this is simply amateur, you're ruining the ambiance.
Second, I have to say it plays just like the original. So if you were raging at those really long subtitle delays, hard to reach shortcuts and a multiverse of verbs - it's all the same here. PLUS, you now have to look for ""i"" and ""v"" letters on your keyb to bring down the verbs and the inventory menu every fucking time instead of clicking, like before. This is so frustrating, at least to me, cause I'm not used to go with both mouse and keyb, unless it's action (which it is not here, you're just wasting the usage of one of yours hands instead).

In all I have to say this and here was the point of my little review: it ain't worth shit. You shouldn't even download this game for free. Just forget it. Play Tales of Monkey Island instead, it's easier, but it's a more lot fun and the interface is better. Plus, it doesn't waste resources (like this game does, just for the fucking F10 switch to the original, which is better btw lol). You'll waste your time, and if you're stupid enough to buy it, your cash too.

Nufsed."

You could also just update/reinstall your direct x. Y`know, with direct x web install.

Because that specific DLL is part of Direct X."

 Just wish lucas arts would sort shit out and make the next one Telle tale is ok as a filler but we all want a full featured MI5.

When I go and play it, the speech volume is very irregular. I can barely hear any of the characters speak! I mean, it works totally fine for all other stuff on my PC and the music and sound effects come out at the right volume too, so its like the problem is only with the speech....
Anyone else facing this issue?"

I have them all on CD already that I purchased years ago.. but they won't play on Vista from CD which is why I am here now trying to download it. I remember playing this game when I was 4/5 years old when it first came out in 90. So to the person saying those over 29 now are the ones that truly appreciate the game.. I am 25 and truly appreciate it. I had it on floppy when it first came out.. with the pirate wheel to enter the code to prove it was a legit copy.

Whats the go with this torrent tho? First off its split into 29 damn rar files (seriously, why rar a torrent).. then once unzipped all I have is an ISO wanting me to burn it to cd?"
,Online.Pirate,2011-07-08T16:20Z,"Ended up installing PowerISO and getting the game installed, had to do the DirectX update in the folder like previously commented by somebody but then it works fine after that.

LucasArts... don't go remaking your old classics... you just ruin them.. F10 this game all the way for the old school original. As for the credits being at the start of the game instead of at the end.. FU LA"
