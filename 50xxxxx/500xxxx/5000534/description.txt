Sourced from the original JSP vinyl release.
Never re-released on CD, because of legal issues.
Transferred to CD with Technics turntable, NAD preamp,
and HHB CD-Recorder.
Ripped with Fraunhofer pro mp3 codec at 128 kbps.
Don't believe Cub Koda's review of this album. He said it was
recorded in mono with one microphone.
I have run the music through an oscilloscope and it is NOT mono.
