INFORMATION :

This will be my final release now for about 1 to 2 months now... This image was built on a fresh MSDN image of XP SP3 as stated above, in this version of XP we have lots of addons but not too many to make it bloated, the main addon is the RyanVM Update Pack v1.0.3 which will update this OS install up too 24th June 2009 anything beyond this date I am not sure of. Also integrated is IE8 and WMP 11, IE8 not being my best choice of browsers, i'd easily of prefered IE7 or Firefox but I wanted to put out a totally updated OS, however Firefox v3.5 is included after OS install. WMP 11 ah I wanted to add WMP 12 but I couldn't find a suitable addon and I heard MS is having trouble with WMP 12 so that made me think...
