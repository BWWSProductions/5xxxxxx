,hackerreg,2009-07-25T20:20Z,"Mate! You put in too many SCSI/RAID drivers. It's like a whole coctail there. You gave me a huge problemo man!
I have RAID on NVidia chipset. I used a floppy to upload my drivers into the setup, but your CD has such a shitload of those other RAID drivers, that they take over and the setuo sees my RAID array as two separate HD's.
I spent 5 hours, busted 6 DVD's and 3 floppy's, but I can't do anything about it. So, all the downloading of 2.09 Gigs came out to be in vain.
Man... Next time don't fuck around with RAID drivers."
,blitzmichael2,2009-07-26T00:21Z,what the!!! I dont wanna say bad words.. so I am gona ask nicely.. HOW DO YOU INSTALL THIS THING? There is a PASSWORD NEEDED when extracting a RAR.. and do I have to burn it as a SOLID rar file? give me specific instructions on how to BURN this Baby!!
,smyr,2009-07-29T06:55Z,"u dont burn it as a ""rar file"", u extract the rar file and u get a .iso file that u burn with imgburn or similar....   the password for the rar is http://www.nextgen-os.org/
capice?"
,tfr777,2009-10-13T11:56Z,"Thanks A LOT to Potent. Very useful and lovely made release! 
Only 2 things I did not like so much: 
1.Some DriverPack crap files left on the C drive 
2.Installation of Office 2007 should not be on the iso, as it takes almost half of it. Better idea could be include Portable versions of MS Word and Excel into the system. 
Good luck and waiting for the new Version!"
