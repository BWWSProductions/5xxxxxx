You Can't Do That on Television

NOTE: THIS IS INCOMPLETE. Most of season 1 can not be found anywhere and there is 1 episode missing in season 9.

Firstly, I downloaded all seasons and unrared them. I saw the first episode and the quality isn't amazing or anything but it is watchable. 

I had problems unraring Seasons 5 and 9. In each Season, there was a corrupted episode. I managed to save the episode in season 5 and did a quick check of it in VLC and it seemed fine. However, the episode in season 9 could not be saved. In the archive it showed being 90+,000 KB....when unrared, it showed 2,000+ KB so I had to dump it.

Season 1 only has 3 episodes. But besides the 10 episodes in season 1 and the episode in season 9, the rest seem like they are all there.

And I will say again.....don't expect great quality....the quality is only watchable. Certainly better than a Cam of movies, but not better than VHS. But I think the quality is just fine to watch.
