First off, thanks to Prince213 for uploading this over a year ago here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4025784/Paul_McKenna_-_Positivity

I've been enjoying listening to this collection since downloading it a while ago, but I suspected that there was at least one file missing from the collection, so I purchased an original copy and found that the one above was indeed incomplete.

So, I've ripped the missing file and added it to the rest and created a new torrent here of the complete collection.

If you've already downloaded the incomplete version and just need the missing file, the file you are looking for is Paul McKenna - Positivity - 02 - 03 - Self Image.mp3

here's the product info from the original torrent:
