The Best Of Decadent Dangerous Delicious - Hanoi Rocks [2000]
	


Amazon.co.uk Review
Feted by many glam-trash fans as being second only to the New York Dolls, Hanoi Rocks featuring Michael Monroe, Nasty Suicide & Sam Yaffa who later reunited as Demolition 23. Hanoi Rock's career was cut tragically short after the death of their drummer Razzle from a car accident involving Vince Neil (Motley Crue). 

Hanoi Rocks were a telling influence on the glitzy US metal of Guns 'N' Roses and Motley Crue, as well as later glam prime movers Rachel Stamp and Backyard Babies. Certainly, these London-based Finns put raw power and exuberant excess back on the agenda after the dowdy days of post-punk. 

Decadent, Dangerous, Delicious, a 2-CD, 31-track anthology, is a collection of the best from their first five albums, plus a scattering of oddities. Among the rarities are two tracks from their very first studio session, and a calypso version of live favourite "Malibu Beach" sung by their drummer Razzle, whose untimely death in a car crash caused the band's eventual split. Despite lacking anything from their final album Two Steps From The Move (recorded for CBS and unavailable for inclusion), this is still a fine showcase for their moving mix of sleazy blues, sweet pop and caustic, anthemic rock & roll. A genuine celebration of Hanoi Rocks has been a long time coming; it's more than well-deserved.
