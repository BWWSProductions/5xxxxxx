-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The beginning of 1985 looked like that the band's promising future was already 
behind but instead of drawbacks their record company believed ? officially at 
least ? that their band would still be a huge success. Dave Novak of CBS: ""Hanoi 
Rocks is in the same category as Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, 
Men At Work and Billy Joel. Naturally we have huge plans for them and we are 
going to invest a lot. During the next six months we will release perhaps two 
singles and in June an LP. This is a big time marketing with videos and 
newspaper ads. It is time to give them what they have rightfully earned. They 
have succeeded in creating their own fan base. This is the time when a big

2 Jan: Sam Yaffa announces his departure from the band. Sami (in 2004): ""I just 
turned 21 then, full of drugs and I had been on the road for five years. I don't 
know what I was planning then. We had good times and we had bad times, we went 
up and down, fought and loved each others. We were a bunch of five nutters who 
flew all around the globe doing things that would eventually destroy us. When 
Razzle died I thought this was it.""

3 Jan: Helsinki (Kulttuuritalo, Europe A Go-Go). Terry Chimes' first gig with 
Hanoi Rocks. Andy: ""I knew Terry before he joined Hanoi and he was fast in 
learning those songs. We just practised basic stuff, nothin' fancy. Main thing 
was that the songs sounded good."" Thursday's concert was recorded for Europe A 
Go-Go TV programme. Their bad luck continued. Nasty: ""I stepped on the monitor 
and here we go again. First I didn't feel anything but then it started to 
swell...""

4 Jan: Helsinki (Kulttuuritalo, Europe A Go-Go). Sami's last concert with Hanoi 
Rocks. Michael: ""We perform here in Finland just for our fans. These are the 
memorial gigs for Razzle... We've been depressed 'cause of his death. I've been 
really down. Fortunately I'm the kinda gu"
