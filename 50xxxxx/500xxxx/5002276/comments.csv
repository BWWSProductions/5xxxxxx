,Bujaaa,2010-07-24T12:11Z,I don't know Wtf is this. when you dowload it you must make an update that lasts forever and then you must wait some more. when it's finished you will get a gigantic program that is in FRENCH and i don't have any idea what it does and what to do with it except send it to recycle bin.

Just let the program update and then choose.
Mes jeux where you will see a folder with a green cross,doubleclick..a new window will appear..be sure to choose the type of console game you wish to play, defaul is x32 i think....click parourir. add game you wish to play...close window...go back to main screen and click mes jour, the game you have mounted will appear and Voila you are playing! Dont speak french but my spanish helped me a little. Hope it helps, thanx again to the uploader!"
