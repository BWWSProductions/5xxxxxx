,blackfly_uk,2009-08-17T17:23Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!!!!!!!! The bonus track folder trys to install Malware. lphhbt.exe & qvnnhb.exe They are hidden as a .scr file and activate when you click the folder. AVG 8.5 gets rid of the Malware.....but not before TPB is blocked in your host file and needs to be removed manually  before you can access The Pirate Bay again. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!!!!!!!!
