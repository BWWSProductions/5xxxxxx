Maurice AndrÃ©
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Maurice AndrÃ© (born May 21, 1933) is a French trumpeter, active in the classical music field. He was born in AlÃ¨s, France in the CÃ©vennes into a mining family. His father was an amateur musician. He studied trumpet with a friend of his father's, who suggested that he be sent to the conservatory. In order to gain free admission to the conservatory, he joined a military band. After only six months at the conservatory, he won his first prize. At the conservatory, his professor, out of frustration beat him, and told him to return when he could excel in his playing. A few weeks later, and without a mistake, he played all fourteen etudes found in the back of the Arban's book.
AndrÃ© won the Geneva International Competition in 1955 and the Internationalen Wettbewerb in Munich in 1963.
He rose to international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s with a long series of recordings of Baroque works on piccolo trumpet for Erato and other labels. Not content to limit himself to the standard Baroque trumpet repertoire, he also performed many transcriptions of works for oboe, flute, and even voice and string instruments.
These recordings were (and remain) very popular, and were a strong component of the rebirth of interest in Baroque music in the 1960s. Fellow trumpeters and music lovers the world over have praised AndrÃ© for his clear, bright,
ringing tone on the piccolo trumpet.
His flawless and graceful performances have inspired many brass instrument musicians, young and old. (Wynto Marsalis, for example, was strongly influenced by AndrÃ©'s style and tone in his own recordings of Baroque trumpet pieces).
He has over 300 audio recordings to his name, from the mid 1950s to the present.
He has two children: Nicolas, who plays trumpet; and BÃ©atrice, who plays oboe. Both perform with their father in concert.
