One of the main things is the occasional skipping of a few frames, but that looks like a transmission issue and so out of your control.

But there's a fair bit of combing throughout. To avoid this, tick ""Deinterlace"" in whatever encoder you're using. There's also a bit of excessive pixelation in places; if you haven't already, I'd suggest running a two-pass VBR encode at minimum. File size is good, but you can eke out a fair bit more quality by resizing the frame to a height of 640 pixels (instead of the full 720 used in transmission and your encode).

On the whole, though, quite a good first attempt, and very watchable."

I'll have a look into using your advise to improve the video encoding tonight, 8 out of 10 cats doesn't appear to be tracked on any public trackers so I'll probably record and encode that. :)

Thanks for the advise :)"

I imagine it's because there isn't a commercial break right before them.

Best of luck with your next cap. For a first attempt this one was quite good, so I expect you'll get great results on the second go."
