,bizzyb0t,2009-07-15T17:55Z,"Thanks Torrent Chris!  It should also be noted that this will probably work on the PS3, though I haven't tested it yet.  When I get the entire file, I'll report back as to the PS3 compatibility.   I'll keep seeding once I get it as well.

What software did you encode this with? "
