Ice-Cold in Alex (1958) is a British film based on the novel of the same
name by British author Christopher Landon. Directed by J. Lee
Thompson and starring John Mills, the film was a prizewinner at the
Berlin International Film Festival. It is frequently shown on television, and
is also available on video and DVD.

A recut version of the film â€” 48 minutes shorter than the original â€” was
released as "Desert Attack" in 1961 in the US.

Tobruk, a British base, is attacked by the German Afrika Korps in the
Western Desert Campaign of World War II. During the resulting
evacuation, MSM Tom Pugh (Harry Andrews) and nurses Diana Murdoch
(Sylvia Syms) and Denise Norton (Diane Clare) â€” the crew of an Austin
K2 ambulance, which was named 'Katy' by its original driver â€” become
separated from their unit and are forced to flee cross-country. With them
are Captain Anson (John Mills), suffering from battle fatigue and almost
an alcoholic, and an Afrikaans-speaking South African officer Captain van
der Poel (Anthony Quayle), who carries a large pack he seems very
attached to.
