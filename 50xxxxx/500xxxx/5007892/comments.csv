[T],Jonzee,2012-04-13T00:06Z,"It can be a real bummer when I download a poor copy of a film, but this one plays just fine on my KMPlayer with no special adjustments to the aspect ratio? AR is 1:66, just as the IMDB description indicates! .......""clane 76"", check the settings on your media player to see if it has skewed the aspect ratio, 'cause I downloaded and played this movie, & it's an above average quality upload of a really great suspense drama."
