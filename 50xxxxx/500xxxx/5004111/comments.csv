,ImpiousAngell,2009-07-30T04:46Z,"3 things:

1. Toonitw either you are a lying sack of $hit or you are a dumb $hit with a crappy anti-virus software giving you false positives. EVERY ONE of Wendy's games that I have dl'd have been clean as a whistle thank you very much.

2. When I go to install it asks for a 2nd disk, I didn't see any rar's to mount or anything, only the one install icon @ 148 mb, an i-net shortcut, and a text doc. Am I missing something? :(

3. Wendy you rock! I love your games - I only dl from you!! THANK YOU FOR COUNTLESS HOURS OF GAMING!!! 

Sincerely,
