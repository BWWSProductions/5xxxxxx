,krazy77,2009-07-21T04:43Z,where in the hell do i get english subs not for hearing impaired and dont say subscene cause i downloaded every eng sub for every duplicity they have and all are hearing impaired  even the ones that say there not  and i run into this all the time theres nothing worse than downloading and hardcoding the subs then goto watch it and every word said is on the screen     I MEAN COME ON  the amount of people that can hear and dont speak spanish (or whatever the language might be )  compared to the amount of deaf people wathing these has to be overwhelming ...  its like gran torino i had to hardcode subs on both avi files then copy them to my external hd then copy orginal files ext hd and keep switching back in forth when the spoke non eng talk about a pain
