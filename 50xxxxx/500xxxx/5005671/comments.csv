I had downloaded this whole torrent once before -- it took about 3mo(!) on a 768k/128k DSL hookup, but unfortunately the drive I had it on died, and I wasn't able to burn a backup copy. :(

Do you still have the disc images? If so, can you (or someone who does) maybe upload the seasons one at a time, so the 170GB in full is more easily downloaded in sections rather than a whole entire chunk?

Besides the (huge) size, this torrent is awesome otherwise. :)"
