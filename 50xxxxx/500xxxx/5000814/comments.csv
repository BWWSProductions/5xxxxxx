,nakk,2009-07-20T14:41Z,"First key didn't work, but second one worked fine. Avira finds trojan (TR/Agent.542720.C) in keyfinder.exe but it's propably a false alarm if anyone else didn't find anything suspicious. I run cleaner-programs just to be sure..."
,ganthraj,2009-07-20T22:08Z,"awesome and super, hat's off puscrew very big heart to share."
,truspirit,2009-07-21T02:09Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP ITS LITTERED WITH TROJANS AND HACK PROGRAMS.  DETECTED WITH BOTH AVG AND NOD 32
,matchstalkman,2009-07-21T02:51Z,"Sorry, I could not get this to generate a valid key.

50 attempts in, I gave up."
,xxx-yyy-zzz,2009-07-22T13:39Z,Maybe is is false positve but there is hacktool in keyfinder.exe
,puscrew,2009-07-23T23:08Z,"guys anti - virus may find some viruses because this software patch - crack windows ,so ofc it will say it is a trojan.sorry for your problems with the keygen,:S i've used it like 5 times and no problem at all ,anyway thanks all!!!"
,Diego.r007,2009-07-24T23:11Z,"sweet Upload tanx

it work at the firts time if u follow instrucctions but.....

the anti-virus said that was harmful but it wasnt every thing worked perfctly



tanxz"
,Flazhp0intX,2009-07-26T20:35Z,"Thx buddy! Works very nice!

@matchstalkman

You probably first copied the key that you got from the keymaker. Then u closed it. You opened up 'keyfinder', and then u noticed that u can't copy the key entirely. Then you opened up keymaker again, but you probably didn't noticed that ""Windows XP PRO VLK"" has changed to ""Windows XP PRO""......

Happened to me too.. I was like WTF? why it doesn't work, but then I noticed it was changed back ;)

cheers."
,jazerix,2009-07-28T18:45Z,"F***ing good work mate, actually i didn't believe in it, but when it tried it ...magics happend! :P THANKS A LOT! Cheers mate "
,jazerix,2009-07-28T19:04Z,"Btw there's a virus in the ""keyfinder"" TR/Agent.542720.c:

Side effects:
   ? Disable security applications
   ? Registry modification

Im using Avira AntiVir Personal "
,puscrew,2009-08-04T19:05Z,"guys it might say there is a virus in the keygen ,though there is not . you should know that anti-viruses always report viruses on keygens.
thanks for the thanks you gave me :P
cheers"
,naja852,2009-08-05T00:37Z,"Does this work for Windows XP Home Edition? Because its not letting me change my key, and im certain im getting the key from Windows XP Pro VLK."
,beautifuldisaster,2009-08-05T16:15Z,"I just want to thank you for this fix cause that HUGE WGA tray notification was so ANNOYING!!!!!!

,a105108,2010-07-04T11:16Z,"Thank you so much, its a small torrent, and easy to operate, and it WORKS!!!"
,a105108,2010-07-04T11:23Z,"BTW, this has no viruses in it. Norton Internet Security 2010 scored a perfect threat detection rate in several tests. I have Norton 360 v.4, which includes all the features of Norton Internet Security 2010 plus SONAR advanced detection. Basically, it scans for threats AND monitors ALL .exe files for suspicious activity. Key word: THREATS. A perfect THREAT detection = detecting THREATS, not suspicious but legit keygens. Horrorhouse, STFU, you're probably a Microsoft employee. If you knew a shit about computers, you would understand. If you knew a shit about viruses, you would see in your stupid scan that ALL THE DAMN VIRUSES HAVE HACKTOOL OR KEYGEN OR KE IN THEM. HEY STUPID, ISN'T THIS WHAT A KEYGEN DOES AND DOESNT IT FIT A KEYGEN DESCRIPTION?

My Norton scanner would have detected it, and there's no way it would have slipped past my Norton scanner AND Norton SONAR. Doubting my antivirus? FYI, THIS WAS UPLOADED IN 2009 SO NO DAMN VIRUS WOULD BE TOO NEW AND NOT BE IN THE NORTON DATABASE.
