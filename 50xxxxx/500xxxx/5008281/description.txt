Release Title: Race To Witch Mountain 2009 BRRip H264 5.1 ch-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)
Release Date: 16 July 2009
Release Length: 01:38:18
Storyline: Former professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson (aka "The Rock") makes family-friendly 
fare with director Andy Fickmanâ€™s (THE GAME PLAN) sci-fi adventure, RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN. Johnson plays Jack Bruno, a surly 
former felon who is trying to stay out of trouble by driving a cab in Las Vegas and who embarks upon the adventure of a 
lifetime when two teens appear in his taxi and need a ride to (seemingly) the middle of nowhere. He quickly realizes that 
the mysterious siblings, Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig), are far from average--especially when they are 
pursued by a villain wearing a high-tech suit of armor. With the help of Dr. Alex Friedman (Carla Gugino), the trio travels 
to Witch Mountain, a secret government outpost in the Nevada desert, with the hopes of evading their pursuers and sending 
Sara and Seth home--and saving Earth in the process. This latest installment in the Witch Mountain series comes more than 30 
years after the release of the first two films, ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN and RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN. Kim Richards and 
Ike Eisenmann, who played siblings Tia and Tony in the original films, appear in small but pivotal roles as a waitress and 
a sheriff. Johnson makes Bruno likable, even though the character barely likes himself. Robb and Ludwig are well cast as 
the earnest siblings who hold the fate of the world in their hands. Chase scenes abound and special effects that highlight 
the teensâ€™ special powers are prevalent, but the film remains kid-friendly. Cheech Marin and Garry Marshall make brief 
cameo appearances.
