but yes it is a great movie, classic!

Ever wanted to just get out of your car when stuck in traffic and just kick everyone's stupid ass all the way home?
 Then this is your movie!

Thanks!"
[T],Gorra09,2009-07-20T15:57Z,Thanks for the upload. This is the best role Michael Douglas has played in my opinion.
,piratexue,2009-07-21T21:43Z,Link to subtitles? I can't find them anywhere (well not ones specifically for this KLAXXON DVDRIP)

,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-05T10:52Z,"hey, i have never put subs on anything before, apparantly you guys think this needs it (havent watched it yet) 

How to put subs?"
,ravi000,2009-10-07T18:02Z,"c0mmun15tm4n, you have to download subtitles from sites such as www.opensubtitles.org or www.subscene.com. Once downloaded, copy them in the folder containing the movie avi file and rename the '.srt' file to the name of the avi. Done."
