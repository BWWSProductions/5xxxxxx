,capent_ind,2009-07-31T01:39Z,"arata75 - Because this is the uncompressed original sound files. The Synapse's pack compressed all of then using ogg (who are decompressed by the custom install script back to wav files, which is the procedure who break the speech recognition routines that makes the lip sync work, who is not really a great loss of functionality, since Synapse managed to reduce a 3.2gb game to 844mb). Just to give you a example of how much oggenc can shrink a wav file, if you encode the br_collaboration01.wav, it will go from 1.4mb to 140kb at 128kbps VBR. The ideal solution to make just the lip sync work would be selecting the files used by dialogs (the sound\vo folder), but this folder alone is the largest of them, thus i choose simple to pack everything. Uncompressed, this 7z pack will have 950mb."

,scrappler832,2011-07-30T02:44Z,"god damnit ppl either someone seed this crap or delete this stuff because without seeds it's not really useful 


you can make the lips work when loading these maps onto gmod but it breaks a lot of spawn points in map transitions and cut scenes so that's not recommended. I'd really much love to see someone seed this! thanks"
,chabosun4,2011-12-22T19:11Z,"Thanks, will seed as long as possible."
,Slayer__4,2012-02-05T21:34Z,"Thank you so much for this man, Half-Life 2 just wasn't the same without moving lips. Will seed for a very long time, I know the pain of not having these files."

,Deadekko,2012-05-11T07:42Z,"Everyone, whatever your doing, dont....stop....seeding, i have 1 seeder and im remarkably downloading pretty quick."
,Deadekko,2012-05-11T07:45Z,"On a side note, im at 0.5kb/s. I believe that is the slowest i've ever had and i started like 5 minutes ago and i'm already at 30+%."
