Wrought Ironwork: A manual of instruction for craftsmen

Rural Development Commission - Great Britain

1953

The techniques in this book are shown by sequences of photographs with concise explanations which are intended to supplement instruction on the anvil. 
It is hoped this clear and practical method will help the smith to achieve the highest standard of work.

The first part of the book decribes the making of the most common decorative features such as scolls, water leaves, wavy bars and twists.
Part 2 describes step-by-step the making and assembly of a gate, which includes the same techniques as are used in all traditional decorative ironwork such as grilles, brackets and gearth furniture. 
The final chapter discusses the problems of painting and rust proofing. 

A knowledge of basic smithing techniques has been assumed thoughout this book, and only those tools peculiar to decorative ironwork are mentioned.
