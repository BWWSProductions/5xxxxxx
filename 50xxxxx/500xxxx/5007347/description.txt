"Review 
People who still believe that electronic pop music is no more than a relic from the 80s have obviously missed a lot. Numerous acts from around the world, newcomers as well as established artists, use "sounds from the plug" again and again and reach the hearts of their listeners with this reputedly cold style. Some bands even succeed in becoming more than just a big name within the electronic scene. The Hamburg-based label Major Records has been concentrating on innovative electro pop from the start, and has already presented an astonishing spectrum of this musical style with the three volumes of the successful "Elektrisch!" compilation series. Now, they begin a new era of samplers with the title "Orbit Electro".  The first volume is a double album with an exciting mixture of popular bands and new discoveries. With this new compilation, Major Records prove again their grasp for interesting electronic pop music, regardless of any clichÃ©s of the genre. Rare tracks and remixes come from established contributors such as MESH, LADYTRON, IAMX, ONETWO, CELLULOIDE,MECHANICAL CABARET and BOYTRONIC,. New in the electronic orbit are promising acts such as DRAGONS, AEROPHONICS, ANTILLES and THE ATTERY SQUASH. "Orbit Electro" will surely surprise its listeners with this unique lineup."
