"No Future" continues, tracking the inner workings of the DMZ's notorious death cult from its more mindless and random street actions to the more sophisticated operations that betray its thug exterior. After witnessing the crash-landing that placed Matty in the city in the first place, our anonymous street killer starts questioning the ultimate point of the organization.
