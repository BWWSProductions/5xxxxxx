Tower of Shadows, which was retitled Creatures on the Loose with #10, was a horror/fantasy anthology comic book published by Marvel Comics from 1969-1975.  It featured work by such notable creators as writer-artists Neal Adams, Jim Steranko, Johnny Craig, and Wally Wood, writer-editor Stan Lee, and artists including John Buscema, Gene Colan, Tom Sutton, Barry Windsor-Smith (as Barry Smith), and Bernie Wrightson.

The stories were generally hosted by either of the fictional characters Digger, a gravedigger; Headstone P. Gravely, in undertaker garb; or one of the artists or writers.

Designed to compete with DC Comics' successful launches House of Mystery and House of Secrets, Tower of Shadows sold poorly despite such notable talent. After its first few issues, the title began including reprints of "pre-superhero Marvel" monster stories and other SF/fantasy tales from Marvel's 1950s and early ' 60s predecessor, Atlas Comics. After the title changed to Creatures on the Loose the comic became a mix of reprints and occasional sword and sorcery/SF series.
