it worked for the install but after a restart of the app its no longer. ""activation key has been invalidated"""
,winobie,2009-08-12T06:34Z,"I also got the Activation key invalidated after a restart. I removed Eyetv with Cleanapp then reinstalled and used little snitch to block it from phoning home. Its ok at the mo, thanks for this, I would never pay for this software since I can only pick up about 5 channels and I payed out big on my Eyetv 410 device a few years ago. Fuck Elgato!"
,chooski,2009-08-15T14:28Z,So how can I stop this from phoning home?
,ngamokai,2009-10-03T21:17Z,thank you.
