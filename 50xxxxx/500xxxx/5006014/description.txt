This album was released in 1992 exclusively in Spain.  In other countries, it 
was released in 1989 as "Themes" on a single CD, though the tracklist was 
slightly different, and "Eric's theme" and "Mouettes" were added in Spain.  
It's funny, as both CDs from this spanish CD could fit on a single CD.

Following you'll find the Allmusic review for Themes, which is the closest I've
found to a review for this one (in english).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Review	by Mike DeGagne

Themes is one of the most entertaining and thorough of any of Vangelis' 
collections, with excerpts spanning such albums as Opera Sauvage, China, and the 
ever-popular Chariots of Fire release from 1981. Most of the selections from 
Themes speak for Vangelis' movie contributions, including the infamous "Chariots 
of Fire" track as well as the lonesome-sounding theme from Missing and the 
powerful openings from Mutiny on the Bounty. With this music, Vangelis has 
implemented some variations in rhythm and some noticeable fluctuation in his 
synthesizer work, making these tracks much more colorful and animated than his 
new age meanderings of the '70s. Also, his ability to cast visual imagery 
through his keyboard playing is represented by many of these excerpts, but 
proven best on tracks like "Antarctica," in which the white, barren wasteland is 
conjured up perfectly through his wispy synthesized textures, and then again on 
"End Titles From Bladerunner," which was previously unreleased, simulating the 
impersonal, android-like world in which the movie was based. Both of his cuts 
from China include oriental-flavored backdrops, while Bladerunner's love theme 
remains one of Vangelis' most beautiful pieces. Themes is a definitive purchase 
as far as compilations are concerned, since a majority of his best material lies 
in the 14 tracks.

                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
