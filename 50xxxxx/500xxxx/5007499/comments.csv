the problem is uploading dupes is pointless. in fact, it's counterproductive. you fracture the torrent swarm, causing torrents to have less seeds and thus die sooner.

unless this is of superior quality to the rest, it's better to just help seed the existing torrents if you're truly interested in sharing with others.

Excellent post lysergic.acid. I couldn't put it in a better. Torrent users learn the very basic of true torrnting "
