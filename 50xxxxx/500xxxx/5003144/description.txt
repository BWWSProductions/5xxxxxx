Code Rush - Documentation of Netscape to Mozilla open source code release

This is a movie, originally aired on PBS in 2000, about the 1998/9 release of the Netscape browser source code into the open-source Mozilla project. It's a documentation by independent reporters who followed some key figures doing some of the historic events of the projects.

This was the start of the Mozilla project, which resulted in Firefox and Thunderbird by the help of hundreds and thousands engineers and enthusiasts, all working on the goal to free the user and the Internet and give him/her a good experience online.
