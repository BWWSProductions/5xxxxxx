,Charon1968,2009-07-17T12:49Z,Ok I will ask the obvious question...how do I get this thing to work once I have downloaded it?
,tnvideo,2009-07-17T17:39Z,"You see the file listed as ""/prophet.nfo""? Read it, it'll tell you exactly what to do. You'll find .nfo files (use word pad or something to open it) in alot of torrents."

,djbaaz,2009-07-17T19:55Z,I love popcap game
,jimerton,2009-07-18T01:10Z,"me likee game, me likee game!!!!!"
,a0t,2009-07-19T09:21Z,"That is amazing, thank you very much!"
,doughboyjm,2009-07-20T11:12Z,"this is AWESOME. thanx very much. for those having problems installing:

1. double click on ppt-pcgc.001 file
2. if your computer doesnt recognize the file it will ask you to select the program to open it with. choose WinRAR.
3. the extracting will begin and you will end up with a .bin & .cue file.
4. mount with daemon tools pro or alcohol 120%
5. enjoy.

if for some reason you dont like .bin files you can always convert it to .iso format using the latest version of poweriso. the iso file is roughly 100MB smaller too :)

good luck and once again, thankyou uploader!!"
,fleetkid,2009-07-21T05:04Z,works perfectly. thanks a lot :)
,Wolf97979,2009-07-24T10:45Z,"Great games. Great speed. No viruses.
But how do you uninstall games?"
,SmashAdam,2009-07-29T20:11Z,I played bookworm adventures for a few levels before it stopped me and said I had to buy the full game. Is there supposed to be a crack for this?
,Dansk101,2009-07-30T18:23Z,SmashAdam... the same thing happened to me when I played Peggle?! Is there a crack or something?
,nasapunk88,2009-08-01T04:20Z,Download was quick and install was easy. So far everything has workd perfectly fine. only thing is my virus scanner shows some of the exe's are suspicious 
,Mudget,2009-08-06T00:47Z,"Works great, no viruses.  Same problem as mentioned above.  Get through about 1/4 (?) of most games and they say trial is over.  Fun games, though, while they last."
,echoey,2009-12-26T04:25Z,"TY PROPHET its a great release.
I quote PROPHET-""This time we have something diffrent from our
other releases ? collection of all games from PopCap.
Some of you may think that these games are childish?
Play them, then judge? All games are properly
precracked (unlike some released as 0day).
So sit down and enjoy? ""

@doughboyjm-->Thanks for the install instructions it is really helpful.

Merry Christmas & New year Boys & Gals!!!"
,underoath281,2010-01-13T00:26Z,"I thought this was a good upload..
Up until I actually PLAYED the games for longer than 20 minutes.
They're just trials.

You're full of fail."
,doughboyjm,2010-01-24T10:36Z,"this is just an update. these games work and are the bomb!! THANKYOU UPLOADER!!!
PLEASE REMEMBER that if you have not blocked all game .exe's via your FIREWALL all of these games will come up as just a trial (due to 'phoning home')...yes its a bit of a pain blocking all of them but definitely worth it. so block all those 'internet rights' and you'll be sweet as."
,shaneH10,2010-02-25T19:48Z,i have been downloading this for 2 days and its only at 24.1%...please seed
,chumbz,2011-02-16T18:27Z,"Guys kindly seed this please .. will be downloading will seed after. My young cousins love this.. :)

thanks in advance uploader"
,The_Welder,2011-09-15T15:23Z,"Hi people...  I did a crackfix for both Peggle and Bookworm Adventure.  So if you want to play past level 4 of those games, you'll need to find that torrent.

http://www.nfohump.com/nfos/shownfoblack.php?nfoid=141239

None of the games are trials!  They are all full version games, but as I said above, 2 of them require my crackfix.

If you want to uninstall a game, or just install a few games, you can do that fully from within the installer.  Just run the setup.exe file again and choose Custom."
,The_Welder,2011-09-15T15:27Z,"For those of you who have noticed that 2 of the games stop at level 4, namely Peggle and Bookworm Adventures, you need my crackfix for these games.

http://www.nfohump.com/nfos/shownfoblack.php?nfoid=141239

The rest of the games are fully working.  If you want to install just a few games or uninstall a game, just run the installer again."
,Kalabrate,2012-04-18T20:56Z,"@ doughboyjm Thanks so fucking much yo. I was bustin by brain tryin to figure out which program to run those files through. Bless. Oh shit I almost forgot, thanks a whole lot AiTB for the upload."
