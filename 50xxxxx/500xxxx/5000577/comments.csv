I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

hey joe - back on a part time basis - I'm sure I'll be able to get 3-4 torrents up'd per week - enjoy

hey how did you get VIP ???? 

--------------------------------------------------------

I guess they felt sorry for me

It can only be awarded by the piratebay moderators, You cant go looking for it, and people cant request it for you either.

Probably because i was uploading a good few torrents every week.

Anyway good to see you back uploading Good Quality Music Again.

Cheers
