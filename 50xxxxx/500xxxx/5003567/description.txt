The film differs from the F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story. The short story is set in Baltimore, not New Orleans; the baby is born speaking like an adult; has a long white beard; is born in a hospital, not at home; and is 70 years old, not 80; is not deserted by his father at a home for the elderly, but is cared for by Mr. Button and encouraged to go to college.
