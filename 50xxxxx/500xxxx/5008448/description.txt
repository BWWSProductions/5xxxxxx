Two Nights In Paris - Whores Of The Grapevine EP (2008)
It all started somewhere when Tomme(ex-Pink Jelly And The Butterflies), Nekke(ex-Pink Jelly And The Butterflies), Twonne(ex-Pink Jelly And The Butterflies) and Geert(ex-Ogress, ex-Sagaris, Varangian) started a band. The meaning was to put "Vlaamse Slagers" and other popular hitmusic in a punky/hardcore jacket.

After doing one cover, things started to itch to make an own song. Since then, covers were left behind and they started playing a mix of punk with metal/hardcoreriffs. Two shows were done with this lineup.

Not long after this, the band decided they need a second guitar player to enforce the songs. Bjorn (ex-Sagaris, ex-Requiem, ex-Immanent Distance) was found to do this job. He learned the songs in no time and new material was written. A first demo was recorded at the "Bonnets studio".

The style evolved and the direction became heavier. An EP - "Whores Of The Grapevine" was recorded. Unfortunately, at the end of 2008, the band broke ways with Tomme and soon thereafter, also Nekke left the band.

Luckily, shortly thereafter, a new drummer was found in Dries (Immanent Distance, Loss Of Sanity). For the vocals we found our hope in Thomas(Varangian, Loss Of Sanity) and Laban(ex-Hit By A Truck).

With this current line-up, we keep evolving in our style and music.
