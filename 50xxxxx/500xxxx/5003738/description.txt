"Holy Diver" is the first single released by heavy metal band Dio, appearing on the the band's 1983 LP, Holy Diver. Although it only reached #40 on the charts, it is one of Dio's most popular songs.

When played on the radio, many stations cut the extended instrumental intro sequence.

The song is prominently featured on the soundtrack to the radio station V-Rock in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories and is also one of the tracks on the game Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s. It was also played in the South Park episode Hooked on Monkey Phonics, and Tampa Bay Rays slugger Pat Burrell used the song in 2005 and 2006 as his at-bat music. The song was also the lead off song in the Matchstick Films Ski Movie trilogy.

In 2009 it was named the 43rd "best hard rock song of all time" by VH1.

Metalcore band Killswitch Engage covers the song on a compilation album entitled High Voltage!: A Brief History of Rock for Kerrang! magazine. They also perform this song in their live shows. The song is also in the re-release of the band's As Daylight Dies album. It is KSE's first top 20 single on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Charts and also includes a music video which is a slightly comical take on the original Dio version. A live version of the song is also featured on the Special Edition of their 2009 album Killswitch Engage
