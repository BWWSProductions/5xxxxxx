,LoudAndClear92,2009-09-13T09:39Z,Just to let you know I've downloaded 'Close To You And More' and 'Sinatra's Swingin Sessions' elsewhere ('Sinatra's Swingin Sessions' had to be converted from FLAC). I don't really want to upload a torrent tbh but if you give me your email I'd be happy to send them.

,Cranman11,2009-11-27T19:37Z,"Excellent Torrent. and very well organized. 

The only thing questionable is ""Sinatra-Basie"" from December 1962. Why do these recordings sound exactly like the Capitol Records recordings of the songs? Capitol Records would not let Sinatra uses his Capitol Recordings, that's why he re-did his best Capitol hits for ""Sinatra's Sinatra"" in 1963. Sinatra wanted to make more money off of those songs and have more control over the use of his material commercially. 

Also, there is an obvious difference between a Capitol recording of a song and the Reprise version. The Capitol recordings are more contained sonically and are very panoramic in the use of the full orchestra (which is consistent with 1950's theory on how to engineering a studio mixed album in the era before 4-track). The Reprise versions are a little looser and have a more dynamic punch with it's orchestra use (newer stereo technologies became available during that time).

Like I said at the beginning, this is an excellent torrent. I have 1 album to gripe about out of 42. Everything else can be resolved. These aren't the most current remasters, so the volume out put is not consistent album to album, most music players have an option to adjust output volume of song.  I did it in iTunes and it improved things a great deal.

If you have a FLAC problem there are plenty of free FLAC converts online. 
Here's a link for PC users: http://www.magicvideo.net/flac-to-mp3/ 
Here's one for Mac users: www.all2mp3.com. 
Linux users can just add the needed codexes/software from their repositories.  I personally love FLAC and will keep a FLAC version as a back up source recording on my external drive. 

So there you go, No one should hold back from downloading this torrent. "
