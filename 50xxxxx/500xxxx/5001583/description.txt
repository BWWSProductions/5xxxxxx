This is my first upload. This project started out as a gift. It also turned into a nightmare, as a poster promised it would on the other Sinatra torrent. Most of Sinatra's torrents are not broken up into albums and are poorly (if at all) tagged. I started the project using the flac torrent someone uploaded of Reprise Complete Recordings. I had to convert it into a wave and then break it up into songs using the program Audacity and tag the songs. That proved to be too time consuming. So I downloaded the other torrent of his songs and had to tag them. I used the program MP3 Tag v2.43. 

These files are at 192 kps. Those are the ones I converted from the flac files. the others are 320 kps. Why someone would make 320 kps from recordings from the 1960's is beyond me and a waste of space.

The other problem I ran into is multiple versions of the same song recorded at different stages of his career. I tried my best to do that right but I am sure a few wrong ones slipped through. Please post any errors.

I did my best. There are 44 albums here. These are from his Capitol and Reprise years. I also included his last proper album L.A. is My Lady. I am missing "Close To You and More," "Sinatra's Swingin Sessions" & More."his soundtracks and maybe one or two others. You can check against All Music Guides page:

I listened to most of the Capitol recordings but not much else. I will do this in the next few weeks. If anyone can fill in missing songs (there are a few here and there) and add missing albums it would be appreciated. I couldn't find any complete Columbia torrents. 

My goal is to eventually have his entire catalog in this torrent. If anyone can add to this and upload it, I will gladly delete this. Any comments are welcome.
