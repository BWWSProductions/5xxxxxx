[T],fachman,2009-07-17T17:37Z,"There must be something wrong with your system or you have downloaded corrupted file. I have tested it on VLCPLAYER, MPC, ffdshow, coreavc with and without GPU and i have none problemms. It should also work flawleslly on PS3, XBOX, and h264 capable standalone devices. You should also remember it has 5.1 sound so in case of only stereo speakers you should set downmix to stereo as well."

,av-0-0,2009-08-12T18:01Z,"well, a/v is really good, but is should be clearly stated that image is cropped on both left and right sides - compare to esir release..."
,safetorrent,2009-08-26T11:35Z,"Thank you fatchman! 

The sync is alright as long as you use VLC, at least with the 1st and the 3rd (didn't need to DL the 2nd). Works fine with VLC but for some odd reason Media Classic f*** it up..."
,darkblademk,2009-10-25T09:00Z,Seed please :(
,mattwilson,2009-12-02T12:37Z,"Seed this please..... I'm a firm believer that if a torrent is not being seeded well, it should be removed."
,mattwilson,2009-12-06T03:02Z,"COME ON!!!! PLEASE SEED, don't take and run! I'm DL @ 3.2K/s :o( :o("
,mattwilson,2009-12-06T15:56Z,"OK, I've got the whole torrent now, currently UL @ 90K/s I've already shared to a ratio of 2.3 but will continue to seed until it reaches 13.

Great quality picture and sound, thanks fachman."

[T],fachman,2010-02-08T06:51Z,"sound is off if you use External filter for MP4 files. 
Use internal filters of MPC and all your problemms will be gone."
,Bapman,2011-03-22T19:44Z,"uhm... the original aspect ratio and this 1 is wrong.
I just compared the scenes side by side ... and the sides in these videos are ... well... cropped."
