,tecneeq,2009-07-22T20:00Z,I personally believe that the interpretation of Anne Sophie Mutter and Herbert von Karajon is far superior to anything i have ever listened to. There is no flac on TPB and i gave my CD to a friend wich never gave it back. So if you or someone else can come up with that version ... :)
