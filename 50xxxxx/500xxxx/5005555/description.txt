So, why a torrent with almost the same work in two versions? Well, musiclovers, when it comes to classical music you can find 100s of recordings of the same work.
I find it interesting to hear how different ensembles and soloists interpretate the same music. You will have the same possibility now. 
If you follow this link:  http://www.svalander.se/vivaldip.htm
youÂ´ll get an idea of the nuber of recordings there are on this work.

A comment isnÂ´t necessary but always nice!
