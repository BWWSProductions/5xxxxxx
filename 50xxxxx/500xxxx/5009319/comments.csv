Please keep seedong guys as I need to free up some hard disc space for this one.

Thanks for all the time and effort in doing this, My teerak will love it, I'm sure.

Nice one. :-)"
,BandS,2009-07-19T02:47Z,Seeding even - LOL.
,Lonepup,2009-07-19T03:58Z,"sawat dee khrup! I thought you guys were going to yell at me for uploading such a large movie! 

But last night I checked on what people were putting in the TPB movie category, and found some really huge torrents there.

Here was a thought: When you d/l the torrent, you can expand the little box and select which files you want first. One thought would be to d/l the first DVD then burn it on a DL DVD. Then you could delete that one to free up room for the next one.

But if you guys do that, I just thought, it will be harder to keep this seeded. I have a 1 TB HD so I don't have to worry.

I love this movie very much, even though I understand thai nit noi. I understand a lot just by watching. I love the music especially. There are some many things I love about this movie, I thought thai people around the world would love it too.

The start of this movie is a guy screaming, and find that Lom is biting the arm of hospital worker. I laughed so hard almost cried when he runs and then bumps into that nurse with the horrible stare. I made a clip of that scene on one of the menus.

There are many funny things in this movie, but some sad things too. Another of my fav part is when towards later on, the scene shifts to rural
(country) thai and they wear these beautiful clothes.

I have a surprise for everyone... if this torrent gets seeded OK and everyone is sa bai dee with it, I have another of my favorite parsart thai movie to share: Nang Bap!

Chok dee! sawatdee khrup.  :-D"
,SDguy,2009-07-19T18:14Z,"So.

Here I stand,
mouse in hand,
staring at the wall....
'Cuz there's no seeders at all.

Not even the uploader, Lonepup.

You gotta seed a torrent of this magnitude for just a tad more than a day, I'd have thought.

Nevermind, I guess it's the thought that counts.

:-("
,Lonepup,2009-08-03T07:40Z,"Tonight this was finally seeded... 13 seeders now and they were the original people to start downloading. Good job to everyone! 

There are ~ 15 -18 stragglers left. If everyone could help out seeding for a few more days that would be great. My computer has been on 24/7 for 2 1/2 weeks but will keep on for a few more days to help seeding.

The seeders should double click on the torrent and make sure ""Initial Seeding"" is checked. This will reduce the load on your computer and force the remaining leechers to share files between themselves before getting files from the seeders.

Enjoy!  "
,SDguy,2009-08-08T15:34Z,"Hey guys,

I'm at nearly 70%.

Happy to seed if only someone will help me out here, please - please - please..............

........................please."
,SDguy,2009-08-14T12:34Z,"Can't believe pom chok mai dee.

Over 80% now and 8 peers but not a single seeder.

Is this the future way of the world?

All take and no give at all?

So sad.

So very, very sad and shame on those of who who have leeched and legged it immediately afterwards."

,Lonepup,2010-01-29T11:02Z,"OK guys, there have been over 2 dozen downloaders of this movie....  I'm going to seed again, but this movie is huge and need people to help seed after d/l.  Thx."
