Lom Huan - à¸¥à¸¡à¸«à¸§à¸™ - 2006

This was a major project, to compile a famous
thai TV series that took around 2-3 weeks to air in 2006.

The total play time is around 16+ hours.

Video quality is less than DVD but better than VCD.

Now you can watch the complete series without having to watch
the crappy clips on utube.

Movie is in thai only - parsart thai.  No angrit
(English) subtitles.

This will take time to upload all. I checked & found
torrents as large as 203 GB on TPB. 

Please be patient while seeding.

Included are CD covers which I found on the web. Obviously
this large torrent does not consist of small VCD files.

After compiling, I watched the entire series on my home
DVD player. DVDs need to be burned on Double Layer (DL 8 GB) DVDs.

Great movie to watch, even for farang, just ask your tee rak
for some help!

Enjoy & please be patient & help seed.
