Awesome quality, and an awesome movie. In my personal top 5, if not number 1."

,xCaptainAmazing,2010-02-23T03:25Z,"doesn't work on ps3 :(

to be fair it isn't specified that it is made for that, but all the other SecretMyth releases are so I was surprised it didn't work, especially since all the specs are the same! great quality though."
