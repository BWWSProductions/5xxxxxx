,o4a0e1,2009-07-18T09:10Z,"ncsweetguy_21... leechers can't comment, they don't have it all... It's the seeders that can comment and as for your disk problem... The entire download is allocated to the hard disk, even if it has only downloaded 1%... So make sure you have the disk space before you dl... Cheers"

[S],B.S.O.D,2009-07-18T09:30Z,"its a little too black in the dark scenes, kinna blurry colors are sharp, crop is ok, aspect ratio is good, xvid in mkv container caused some problems for me but it would play on a computer fine .id say good for a cam, suprisingly for a p2p cam, bad for anything else. to nuke this bring up the both brightness and contrast, drop the framerate to 24 dont touch the color or crop, put it in an avi container and you're good to go"
,Dratanium,2009-07-18T09:44Z,Is this vers any better than the previous eng release?

but little bit crop from top and bottom.

And I also think that the above link is worth than this upload."

,midnightzak,2009-07-19T17:32Z,"*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Very good copy!

A6/V6.5

There is a spot early in the film where there is a clicking/buzzing noise which is pretty annoying, but it goes away pretty quickly.

Video is soft (but not blurry), and there isn't really any noticeable crop.  Ratio is a little bit off (stretched vertically) but it isn't very bad at all.

I'd recommend this copy to those that want a freebie version asap as this one is easily watchable.

,tomoxicillin,2009-07-19T21:54Z,How lame the new pirate bay owners just announced they are gonna make it a pay site with in the month!!! and to all those who say go use mininova hell that is no good they will go down too 90% of mininovas torrent files are piratebay hosted. so i am sure they will go dark too. this sucks where else can you get movies and such. guess im going back to irc or to the news groups.

 hey darkko, you fucking duche bag. no one asked your opinion. what the fuck is your fucking problem? if you want good quality, why dont you get the fuck off your fat worthless ass and go to the theater instead of sitting infront of your computer bitching about shitty CAM's cuz your to cheep to spend 5$. so why dont you shut the fuck up, no one wants to hear your bull shit. the guy who made this was obviously just trying to give us all a quick veiw. the title didnt say ""WHOLY FUCK AMAZING QUALITY, YOU'LL FIND NO BETTER!!!"". 

ever heard the term beggars can be choosers, or are you just to unintellegent to understand it?"
,topher74637,2009-07-20T00:53Z,Quick hint when making a CAM.  Turn your cell phone off!  That what the random buzzing in the audio is from.

,almostaquad,2009-07-21T06:07Z,Kjasd090923 Hold it. Now I haven't even started downloading this yet but your saying the copy at Mininova is far better than an aXXo DVDRip. I don't think that is possible. I looked at the last page of these comments. 3 people said go to a better copy here at TPB and 1 said go to Mininova. Cgaurav007 you must have knocked the hell out of somebody's mother. Either way Thanx for the upload
