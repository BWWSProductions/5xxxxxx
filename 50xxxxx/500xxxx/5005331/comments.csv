,pbransford,2009-07-15T22:56Z,I am able to seed at 1024 kb/s for up to 16 people. Please help me seed!
,pbransford,2009-09-07T08:39Z,"I have moved this to a tracker less vulnerable to .torrent tracker 'witch hunts' - please get the torrent from the following URL, instead. I will no longer be seeding this one.

Fellow seeds (and current downloaders) - keep the existing data and use the new torrent - hashes are the same, only the announce URL is different. You should be able to pick up where you left off.

I apologize for the trouble. Blame the RIAA/MPAA's of the world."
,parje2025,2009-11-07T05:42Z,downloading.... great upload... thanks
,kludge420,2009-12-25T20:05Z,"Thanks for the upload. I greatly appreciate your effort.

It must be noted though that while some might need it in DVDR format that is a HUGE waste of bandwidth. The video files are only about 150MB a piece and there are only 6 of them so that's 900MB. I opted to download them as separate files and save 5.43GB of transfer.

Thank you again for your efforts I just feel people should know they can get them in a much smaller format from the source.

Go to BlenderUnderground dot com for the files."
,slopbox,2010-07-31T01:57Z,"Hi, kludge420.

Anyone worrying about why this is so (freaking) huge, I agree: I originally uploaded the original video files: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4521776/blenderunderground.com_-_Blender_Video_Tutorials_1-5

which *are* the original files, and come in under 800MB.

I can only assume this DVD-DL torrent is an MPEG2 transcode (ew!) of these. For the love of mumble, why?!

Please ... download the original files!

(ps. I have nothing to gain from this either way -- it's just the unmitigated waste annoys me)."
,pbransford,2011-03-22T01:39Z,"slopbox,

because DVDs are MPEG-2, that's why. If you use some other codec (and I agree, MPEG-2 is eew) then it's not a standards compliant DVD-Video disk.

This torrent is for the DVD. If you have a problem with the size, burn to disk and delete... or go download the actual videos. I mirror and host a torrent for those as well."
