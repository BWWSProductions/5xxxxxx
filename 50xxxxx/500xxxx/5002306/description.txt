Bellydance Live!

DVD Rip.

Collection of varied performances. Really liked most of them and some like David's Bollywood performance was amazing. The Line-dancing fusion piece was...unique.

Although the original description says there is an audio commentary, its not on this rip, if you want that you will have to wait for me to seed the full dvd.
