This is O.C.Lambert's shocking booklet Roman Catholicism Un-American - Shocking Expose from Official Catholic Documents (1956) which is a systematic review of anti-democratic, anti-republican, anti-individual rights, anti-free enterprise and other totalitarian principles of the Roman Catholic Church. In the time of writing, Americans were conditioned that the greatest threat to their freedoms came from communism and alike. But the frightening fact was that the Catholic Church has silently infiltrated virtually every department of government, executive, legislative, and judicial. There is in every department a person at the right place at the right time to do the right thing for the Catholic Church. Read from the horse's mouth what they are up to. 30 pages. A must read for everyone.
