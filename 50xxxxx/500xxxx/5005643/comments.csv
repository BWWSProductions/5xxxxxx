,Dr_Science,2009-07-17T06:19Z,"So I downloaded this movie and really enjoyed it. good kids movie that adults can enjoy too.  The quality is great too

But....then I came to write a comment about it and I noticed that the poster was not in English.  I was so upset that I threw up.  Then I realized I hated the movie. I mean god, if the poster on the torrent web page is not in english then I couldn't possibly have still enjoyed this movie.

that's how ignorant you sound torrento_don.
If its that big of a deal to you dude (or dudette) then do a google image search.  Problem Solved.

P.S.  You also make all of us Americans (or other English Speaking Countries) look ignorant too. there are more languages that watch movies besides English."

,oakmario,2009-07-20T01:24Z,"No audio when played back on PS3. Seems related to the fact the audio was ripped in Variable Bit Rate (VBR) format instead of CBR (Continuous Bit Rate). 

I rebuilt the AVI using VideoDub and changed the audio to CBR and now it plays back on the PS3 however, the audio is quite out of synch (I'd estimate about 1 second ahead of the video). Very distracting to watch it that way when you hear the voice and then a second later the lips move :-) ... funny.

Anyone find a good torrent of this properly built to play back on PS3? 

Thanks."
,oakmario,2009-07-20T02:31Z,"Sorry guys, program is called VirtualDub. I reprocessed the file and added a 1500ms delay to the audio and it runs very nicely on the PS3 now. Give that a try if you are having problems with audio synch."
,lovespups,2009-07-20T05:33Z,Badly out of sync - waste of time.

For Kids only!"
,oddmanoutgt,2009-08-02T06:37Z,"Just because a movie is for kids doesn't make it a bad movie. It just makes people who don't like it old.  Letters to Iwo Jima is great for adults for shitty for kids.  I prefer to keep being a kid, so this movie ROCKS!!!"
,tmemnorinve,2009-08-05T18:14Z,why rar? don't understand...
,elax666,2009-08-06T14:39Z,"I donÂ´t get it!?! Use Winrar to open!?! Do I really have to download Winrar if I want to see this movie? And if thatÂ´s the case, which Winrar am I supposed to get? I read the comment about opening it in Winrar and create a AVI-file,(or somethinglike that), is that what all this people has done to see it? Whatever the answer, THANKS .BONE. 4 sharing!!!!"
