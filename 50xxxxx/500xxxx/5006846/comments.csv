Hi, bro.   Sorry to jack your thread.   I second the comment...thanks for all your great uploads.

Reason I am here:

Any chance you can get hold of Julie London's album ""In Person At The Americana"".   I've been all over the place and can't find it anywhere.   Big big thanks to you if you can

Regards"
