These are the Audio books to the Queen Betsy/Undead Series by Mary Janice Davidson.

I've made each book into an .m4b (audio book format) file. These are actually smaller in size, and they work perfectly on your iPod.

I've also included the pdf versions of the books because there are a few half books.

I have NO IDEA why, but in the last torrent, it would not go past 65.3% on both of my computers, and they wouldn't communicate, and other things, so I'm going to try a reupload.

If you have any requests or the files need a correct, please email me at ipendragon99@yahoo.com and I'll take it into consideration.

Hope you enjoy.
