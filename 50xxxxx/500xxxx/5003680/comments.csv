The beginning is fine, but around in the middle of the book the audio begins to go silent for moments and the audio volume begins to change randomly."

Yes, I noticed the same thing, and also some areas of high-pitched squeaky noises.

I'd like to thank the uploader, though, for trying again! :)

Maybe someone else who has the audiobooks could do an upload that doesn't have the silence and squeaks, and ""half books."" 

I actually didn't notice the note about ""half books"" until I had already downloaded it - too eager to get my ears on them, I guess. I'm not sure ""half books"" would be a good fit with my reading style, so I'll hope for the ""full version!"""
,kkitten,2011-01-16T21:51Z,I just wanted to let any possible downloaders know that there are for sure issues with the first 2 books. I downloaded 1-3 from itunes but couldn't find the 4th so I decided to give the one I got from this bunch a shot and it worked fine. The 4th-7th books all work perfectly. The 8th book that's uploaded separately by this user is fine also. Saved me a bunch of money. Thanks!!!
