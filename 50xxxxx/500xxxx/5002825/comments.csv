,MichaelCr,2009-07-22T14:19Z,Im just at 30% and the peers are at 41(103) and no seeds. If everyone can let it Leech High over nite it would help Impulse also seems to seed overnight as well. Thanks everyone
,impulse255,2009-07-24T22:28Z,44.4% .. 1 more week and you're done :-)
,impulse255,2009-07-26T21:49Z,"Or, at this rate it might take a century or so"
,r4m88,2009-07-26T23:52Z,"""...it might take a century or so.""  No kidding. I'm at 52.5% after a week, but my dl speed has shrunk to almost zero for the past couple of days. On the bright side, I have 100% of 36 files. Too bad there are 269 files total. "
,MichaelCr,2009-07-28T07:50Z,Im up to 55% lol says one week more. But I will keep with it I want this set lol
,jon_071,2009-08-01T21:14Z,Could someone tell me which movies has japanese audio? I prefer watching them in their original language with subs. Thanks!
,impulse255,2009-08-02T01:46Z,they are mostly japanese or dual audio jap/eng
,r4m88,2009-08-02T03:11Z,"I spoke to soon about the 'almost zero' DL rate.  I am up to 85% (around 55GB) now after about two weeks. The DL rate has decreased a lot in the last few hours, but I have faith that the entire torrent will be available since noticing the originator (impulse255) is still commenting here. I will continue to seed after I am done DL."
,impulse255,2009-08-02T11:27Z,have faith my friend :D
,impulse255,2009-08-02T21:15Z,Uploaded near 70 gig and still no seeds :(

,vbee,2009-08-27T05:54Z,"Guys, please please seed. I've been trying to download this one for a week now. "
,GorgorothX,2009-09-23T14:07Z,"Impulse, thanks so much for sharing.  I will start DLing and then seed this awesome collection for all eternity!"
,warheart4,2009-09-23T17:19Z,Beautifull! As soon as I get this one on 100% I will seed with full speed(Have around 13Mbit Upload so I should be able to upload quite a few gigs)
