Btw, your stated url to the other movie pack has been deleted. Should be http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4994037"

[V],Kuthumi,2009-07-15T08:56Z,"I want to thank you again for ""Heaven Help Us"", which I have never found before on any torrent site. It was on my most-wanted list, because it was one of the first films for both Andrew McCarthy, Kevin Dillon, Mary Stuart Masterson and Patrick Dempsey."
