I'm uploading this for a friend as a preview/submission copy. He wasn't having luck getting it published so he said we might as well have it for free.
Here's his description:
Lance is an average high school student in a small, Midwestern city; Rain is the new girl in school with a mysterious agenda and an equally mysterious past. As his senior year winds to a close, Lance watches his hometown slowly rot from the inside out. Wanting to help, but not knowing how, he continues to live out his life in mediocrity, until fate decides to step in and shake things up. After a failed mugging, Lance discovers that he has super powers. Finally armed with the tools he needs to clean up the city, he sets out to do just that, starting with the two men that attacked him. The mystery deepens as the broader conspiracy concerning Lanceâ€™s newfound abilities is revealed. The lessons that Lance learns about how his actions have consequences form the core of this character-driven series.

The book is intended for Young Adult readers but can be enjoyed by readers of all ages.
