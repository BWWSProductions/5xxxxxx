This Disney Western has roving bachelor Bill Bixby getting saddled with three children and a wealth of trouble when the youngsters stumble upon a huge gold nugget. They join forces with two bumbling outlaws--Don Knotts and Tim Conway, of course--to fend off the greedy townspeople and are soon facing a surly gang of sharpshooters.
