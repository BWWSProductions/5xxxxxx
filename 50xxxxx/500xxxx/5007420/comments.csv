""""I think LeChuck's Revenge would be awesome to revisit, but at this time we have no plans for future updates,"" LucasArts producer Craig Derrick told Destructoid. ""It all comes down to whether people like what we've done with the Special Edition and see the potential for future projects. Sales are definitely an important measurement of this, but so is fan and critical reaction to the game.""

Derrick wants the Monkey Island revival to not only bring back old fans but get new people interested in the series and point-and-click adventure games as well. If things work out this way, he'll see about doing more. ""If both parties show up, enjoy the game and want to see more then I think we'll be on the right path to not only do more updates, but all new adventures,"" he said."""
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-22T20:29Z,"as an old fan i say 'yaey' to all things monkey island
but if lucasarts is only going to remake the originals with the same puzzles but better graphics there really isn't much to be thrilled about
i still play the originals from time to time and they are fun even though the graphics are outdated
i've been waiting for new monkey island games to come out for a looong long time so i hope lucasarts will finally get around to do some :D
haven't tried the telltale games MI so far, anyone know if those are any good? anyone got a torrent on those?"
,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-27T15:54Z,"i can't seem to get this to work properly on windows 7 64-bit. i got all the missing dll's but it still doesn't run. anyone got any good tips? (besides installing a different os :P)
played the Tales of Monkey Island games by the way and they're cool though not nearly as complicated as the first MI games."
,lukas205,2011-07-09T10:36Z,i have a problem where it now says application load error: 5:0000065434     anyone have any ideas on what i should do?
