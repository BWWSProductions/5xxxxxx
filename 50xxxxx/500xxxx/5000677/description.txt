I just realized that only 4 parts of the documentary have been posted so here's the last one.

It's the same resolution as the others.

Size: 62Mb
Time: 06:14
Video: MPEG1 Video 352x240 (107:80) 29.97fps 1048Kbps [Video]
Audio: MPEG Audio 44100Hz stereo 224Kbps [Audio]

If anyone has the set at a better res I'd appreciate it.
