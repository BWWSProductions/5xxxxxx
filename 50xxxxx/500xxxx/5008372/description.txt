This is version 3.6.10 of the FSOpen source.

Well I was installing FS2 with the Source code project addon which enhances the engine to run on current machines (E.g. you can now run the game at 1920x1200) but the installer takes some time to download everything!

Also, not everyone will want to configure the damn thing to run, right?

So what I've done is put my whole directory into these .rar files. Just decompress and run LAUNCHER.exe!

This set includes the MediaVPs!! These modules give new lighting effects to explosions, lasers and pretty much everything! It breathes new life into the game.

Here's a video of how it looks like now:

Also included are several mods with new campaigns in them. These are:

-Awakenings
-Blue Planet
-Cardinal Spear
-Derelict
-Destiny of Peace
-Deus Ex Machina
-Freespace port to Freespace 2
-Just another day Special Edition
-The Procyon Insurgency
-Shrouding the Light/Shrouding the Light Origins Repack 
-Trascend
-Twilight
-Warzone

To run one of the mods, choose a mod from the launcher. That's it!


- FULL GAME - Nothing was ripped! All music + videos from the original are there.

Installation:
-Decompress and run LAUNCHER.EXE!
