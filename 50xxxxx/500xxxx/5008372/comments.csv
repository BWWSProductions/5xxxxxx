,JoshWinks,2009-10-03T23:42Z,I have x64 Vista and it works but when I run Launcher.exe it first says doesnt know command line paramater -normal and then -3dshockwave. Is this normal or is there something I need to do?

,HippieMan,2010-08-09T19:23Z,"Doesn't work any longer, the updates are outdated and the autoupdate is as well, you're better off going to the official FS2Open page and getting them yourself."
,HippieMan,2010-08-09T19:44Z,"Doesn't work anymore, everything is outdated or broken, I strongly recommend just download FS2 and upgrading yourself via the FSopen website."
