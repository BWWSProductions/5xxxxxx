This CD is made up of tracks from five albums, the packageing leads you to believe that that there is more than a guest apppearance on just two tracks.  It's a pity as the CD is a really good, swinging set produced by the legendry John Hammond and using some of the finest musicians around at the time, with mainly from the Basie band it was recorded between 1954 and 1957.  Despite the marketing it is a fine record to have in your collection.  ~ M.  J.  Powell
