It's going to be slow generally, but at the moment I have to get my ratio up on Sixcrates' (http://thepiratebay.org/user/sixcrates/) FLAC Be Good Tanyas albums, which are well worth checking out if you like this compilation.

As soon as this torrent has stabilised, I'll be uploading Another Country volume two. :) Take it easy all."
