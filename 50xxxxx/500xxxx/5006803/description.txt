It's the start of a pivotal new arc! In part 1 of "The Gnawing," the already strung-out and paranoid Dash Bad Horse feels the noose tighten around his neck even more as Chief Red Crow begins to search for the undercover FBI agent in his midst. Meanwhile, the death of another character sets the reservation on the road to all-out war.
