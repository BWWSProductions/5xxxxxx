Cardio Bellydance Workout with Dolphina

DVD Rip

Don't much like the instructor...or the "goddess" stuff she bleats on about. I have previously seeded her other 4 beginner instructionals and will reseed them when I have time. I have not yet bought her "for weightloss" dvd yet...not very compelled to if this one is the same standard.

Don't find the "workout" or the instruction appealing, or the fact one move is referred to as a "milkshake", I would think someone who teaches bellydance would try to steer clear of using such sexual inuendo...
