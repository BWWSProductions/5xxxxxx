MONTEZUMAS - MONTEZUMAS
Physical album released 2006, can - and should - be bought at www.hotstuff.se. If you enjoy this album then do buy it. You might not have heard of Montezumas before, but you have probaly heard of The Tallest Man on Earth who is actually the singer in Montezumas. While the band Montezumas doesn't play folk with an acoustic guitar, singing about women and misery like The Tallest Man on Earth, they still deliver a great deal of rock just the way it's suppose to be.
