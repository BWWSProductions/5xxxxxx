,Tuzanor,2009-07-18T10:57Z,Thanks ever so much. On Holiday with 4 women all who watch the soaps (why do C5 clash with these - do they want to provoke domestic discord?). So I've missed the highlights on Days 1 and 2. These are most welcome. I have been promised that I can watch Sat and Sun's hughlights live - no soaps
