The rate of "The Internet Movie Database" (IMDb) for this movie is 7.1 of 10 (40,819 votes). As you already seen on the torrent's name, the star of the movie is Jim Carrey (Carl Allen). When you see Jim Carrey all you can think off is comedy. Well, you're right, it is a comedy... 

Perhaps you wonder what is in this movie...Honestly, i didn't watch the movie (yet), but i'll give you a part of the summary from IMDb :

"Carl Allen is at a standstill. No future... Until the day he enrolls into a personal development program based on a very simple idea: say yes to everything! Carl discovers with amazement the magical power of "Yes", and sees his professional and romantic life turned upside down overnight: an unexpected promotion and a new girlfriend. But he'll soon discover that better can be good's enemy, and that all opportunities shouldn't be taken..."

The size of this file might seem a bit large, but if you want a good quality, a good DvDRip, the file must be this way. I can make it even at 700 MB, but the quality is not the same.

P.S. I'm not trying to be like aXXo, i do not try to compete with him etc. (anyway aXXo makes his Rips at 700MB), i just want to give you some good movies with nice quality.
