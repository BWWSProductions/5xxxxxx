1991 album from the First Lady of Soul including her cover of Sly & The Family Stone's "Everyday People" (also featured as an extended dance remix by Shep Pettibone), the duet "Ever Changing Times" with Michael McDonald (just like "Someone Else's Eyes" written and produced by Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager, Bill Conti and Bruce Roberts), "What Did You Give" (written by Aretha herself and produced by Michael Legrand) and "Doctor's Orders" (a duet with the late Luther Vandross). Included on this album is also the song Aretha sang at Bill Clinton's Inaugural Concert in 1993, "I Dreamed A Dream", originally from the musical Les MisÃ©rables. Aretha's version of the song opens with the spoken line "I had a dream..." and the lyrics consequently take on an entirely different meaning - and sixteen years later she sang at another president's inauguration; Barack Obama's.
