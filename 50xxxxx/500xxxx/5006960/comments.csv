,blueflame2888,2009-07-20T06:52Z,I do not recieve any sound when playing this.  The video looks excellent though.. maybe I need a audio codec or something? Anyone know by any chance?
,xcel423,2009-07-21T05:36Z,"You can get both- VLC & K-lite at filehippo dot com

Among other things, LoL, you can gettem here too, but why hassle with seeding progggies that are free?"

Thank you very much for the english subtitle.

,GGAllinlives,2009-07-26T20:27Z,"thanks for the up, but please don't rar media torrents, it's counter productive :(

people don't want to keep both the rars to seed and the actual file around, not to mention it makes preview impossible. Thank you though."
,eww-poo,2009-07-28T13:34Z,actually not a bad movie.. beyonce and ali larter catfight is a winner.
,HillBillyBob,2009-07-29T22:14Z,"Many thanks for the upload - excellent quality.

I would call this film a turkey but that would be an insult to poultry everywhere. Ali Larter is about as threatening a psycho as kermit the frog. Miss Knowles should stick to shaking her ass and Idris Elba should go back to being British. IMO. If you've got time to spare and fancy a ""stay away from my family bitch"" flick, get the original and best bunny boiling Fatal Attraction."
