,notherdaysgoneby,2009-07-19T00:17Z,"Alright guys. I downloaded this DVD. Burned it to a DVD and watched it in my living room. Big TV with kick ass surround sound system. 

The quality is amazing for such a small filed DVD. Never in my life have I seen or heard something look and sound so good and be such a small DVD. djDEVASTATE has something going here. Hi quality flicks that are currently in theater. And they download quick cuz they are so small!! These shits are not cams but rips of the real deal. Anyone who would complain if it wasn't ""perfect"" would be a true idiot.

Thanks for the service you are providing djDEVASTATE! 

For perfect high quality exact copies of DVD's that are available in store see what djfred has to offer. His DVD-Rs are always great.

Keep on bringing us the good shits! You kick ass!"
,rallarblod,2009-07-21T13:25Z,Thanks djDEVASTATE2009 you are the best!!!
