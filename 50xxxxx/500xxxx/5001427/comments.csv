Unfortunately, I can no longer seed my files properly so I would like to host my Best of Alex Jones Vol. 1 (580 MB) as a RAR/ZIP somewhere for direct download. Does anybody know a place? Thanks!!

,addeps2,2009-07-14T14:27Z,"I KNOW Cohen was acting like a queer,chattora, I was just ASKING if the elite could SPIN THAT to Ron Pauls disadvantage in his campaign, chakah!

So once again; Ron Paul calling a halfnaked, dancing Sacha Cohen, whos making Ron visibly uncomfortable =P, making Ron RUSH out and telling his assistant or whoever: 

""that man is acting queer as a crazy!""  two or three times.... 

I dont mind Paul the elast, and he probably agreed to the interview because of the LIMITED exposure he is given.

BUT COULD THE MEDIA/ELITE SPIN THAT STATEMENT TO HIS DISADVANTEAGE?
