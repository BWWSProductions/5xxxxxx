,mdeonte,2009-12-30T03:55Z,Very quick and high-quality torrent. It is missing track 10 though which I have never heard of.
,songs_of_wind,2010-01-21T14:19Z,"Track 10 is called ""Bounce"". It's pretty good too. LimeWire should still be good for something.."
,TheQw,2010-01-24T12:01Z,"Even if track 10 is missing, I'm still gonna DL this torrent because its @320 KbPS. I suggest getting the missing track from another torrent thats popular - quality may not be as high, but you'll get a fast DL. Just de-select the other album tracks you already have.

LimeWire is a fairly shitty program that gives tons of viruses. Its initial DL speed will be faster than a torrent DL, but torrents take time to power up and reach much faster DL speeds after a while!
