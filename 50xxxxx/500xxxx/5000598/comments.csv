Thank you Thank you Thank you !"
,AxBattler,2009-07-14T23:35Z,The sound in the sample is completely out of sync.. Can anyone tell how is the whole movie?
,AxBattler,2009-07-15T18:24Z,"My bad.. the sound is perfectly in sync. MPC is lagging the sound for some reason.. On VLC the sound is good but the movie sometimes just freezes..
What's your recommendation for the  best player to play 1080p movies?"
,Jdog9000,2009-07-18T06:22Z,Axbattler - I would think VLC and WMPC are about the same. Most PC's should play 1080p movies without a problem. Here is some more info http://www.digital-digest.com/articles/highdefdvd_test_page1.html
,steadygettingblown,2009-07-20T23:30Z,try downloading windows media player classic the exe. file and get haail media splitter and it should work perfectly 
,kinvore,2009-07-22T22:09Z,I never have problems with BS Player.  Yeah that name sucks but it plays everything for me w/o problems.
,shatroghistro,2009-07-26T21:30Z,"I need help: What are sys requirements for flawless 1080p play? I have an amd x2 5200+, ddr2 800mhz 4gb ocz high performance memory, chieftec 550w, ASUS EAH 4830 on XP sp3 x86 and a full hd lcd and when I play this, it stutters a bit! Will it work better on x64? Please reply..."
,vetlelg,2009-07-28T18:58Z,"You won't need very high requirements to support 1080p. I believe any computer existing today are able to.
I have no knowledge in what computers are better, but as long as it supports full hd and have the right media player you'll be fine. I think vlc is pretty good actually."
,vetlelg,2009-07-28T19:06Z,"Pls keep seeding. I went up to 400kb/s for a while, but now I'm stuck at 50-100kb/s."
,twiffy,2009-08-03T03:56Z,"TO PLAY THIS WITHOUT STUTTERING you can't just use any computer.  Computers that have a separate video card are really what you need to play this without risk of stuttering.  Computers that have the cheaper video port built into the motherboard will often not be able to render 1080p fast enough.

If you aren't sure which you have, check to see where on your computer your monitor is plugged in.  If it's plugged into a port with a lot of other ports right around it, like your USB ports and stuff, you probably have the cheaper kind.  If your monitor is plugged in to a port that's by itself or only near one other port, you probably can play this just fine.

If you can't play it without stuttering and you want an upgrade, take your computer to Best Buy and get ready to shell out $100 - $150.  Or find a friend who knows how to work with computers and give him $50.  Even the cheapest ""dedicated video card"" should work fine."
