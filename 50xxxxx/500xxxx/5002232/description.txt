"Dicks Diamonds'" Dick Strawbridge and Jim Milner bring Nikki Woolmore back to their team for this second Chariot challenge.

Their three challengers : "The Tree Musketeers", "The Cowshed Cobblers" and "The Muddy Boys".

Today's challenge - build motorized chariots to re-take on "The Diamonds"

Help me seed & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

I'm adding one episode a day Mon - Fri as they air on ABC2 digital TV here in Australia. (We're getting them before the UK).
