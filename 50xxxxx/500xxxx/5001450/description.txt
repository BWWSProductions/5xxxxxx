In this volume, Khaled Anatolios presents a comprehensive study of St Athanasius, one of the most influential figures in the development of Christian doctrine, through a comprehensive interpretation of his theological vision. He analyses the coherence of Athanasius' theology by relating the various aspects of his doctrine - God, creation, theological anthropology, Christology and redemption and the life of grace - to a pervasive emphasis on the radical distinction, and simultaneous relation, between God and world. Athanasius provides a systematic account of the overall inner logic of the Athanasian vision that shows how the various aspects of his doctrine are mutually related and in so doing elucidates the complexities both of Athanasian thought and of Christian doctrine in general.
