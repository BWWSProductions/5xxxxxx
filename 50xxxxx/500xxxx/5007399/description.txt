Daughtry's newest album "Leave This Town" plus his acoustic cover of Lady GaGa's "Poker Face" as well as all the bonus tracks I could hunt down.

I take no credit for these MP3s, I just found and assembled them so everyone wouldnt have to work as hard as I did to find em all. No passwords. No signups. No gimmicks. No viruses lol

Enjoy and happy downloading! 

Please seed for me !!!!! I am not able to seed this 24/7 with full bandwidth! So everyone please dont be greedy and share with your fellow pirates ;)
