The Best Of - Johnny Cash [1998]



Amazon.co.uk Review

Every home should have a Johnny Cash compilation. Cash is a genuine titan of popular music, whose finest work should be as venerated as anything by Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, David Bowie or Brian Wilson, and this collection does as good a job of beginning to explain why as any. The virtue of Cash's music is its simplicity. His brutally reductive take on country, set to his distinctive boom-chicka-boom backbeat, directs all of the listener's attention to his supernaturally world-weary voice (even as a teenager, Cash sounded about a thousand years old). This collection is a judicious mix of covers (Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry", Bob Dylan's "It Ain't Me Babe" among them) and original Cash standards. That the producers of this record have a genuine empathy with their subject is confirmed by their inclusion of a live version of the triumphantly nihilist "Folsom Prison Blues" (once identified by Ice-T, no less, as a progenitor of gangsta rap) taped at one of Cash's famous prison concerts . The cheers that greet the line "I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die" are the eeriest confirmation of credibility by an audience upon a performer ever recorded.
