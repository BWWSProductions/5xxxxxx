This is a vinyl rip of late '60s Boston band "Listening". This is their first and only album released and is so hard to come by that i had to rip it myself from a vinyl copy i have. For fans of psychedellic and classic rock. Also this whole album was recorded in one take with no splicing. Great Album!

SEED AND ENJOY!
