,Sarkasmi,2009-08-17T04:28Z,AzuraBlade's download sure is taking a looooong time.
,Sarkasmi,2009-08-17T22:16Z,"Yeah the audio was top notch and the picture quality was very good. Not DVD quality, but still very very good. Didn't actually notice any difference to a DVD rip while watching it, so the SLIGHTLY worse video quality didn't bother at all. 

And the movie was hilarious :D 

The pictures of the camera at the end were funny as hell. Too bad the ending credits were cut and all the pictures weren't shown. :< 

Thanks a bunch chapmeister!"
