,Ezel,2009-08-15T15:24Z,"This release starts to get 'jerky movements' in the picture around about 02h21m when played on my PS3. Might be something with my PS3 that's acting up, but I just thought I'd give a minor warning."
,japaxs,2009-09-01T05:46Z,"yeah. starts getting choppy at 2:21

,tidusauron,2010-03-20T11:54Z,"Why can't I make this play smoothly on my pc? I have the latest k-lite codecs. What else do I need? My problem is most of the time, the video gets delayed. Help please."
,LV-426,2010-08-15T23:05Z,THANX MAX!!!!!!
,gabriel1475,2010-08-27T10:53Z,"WTF??? Like everyone else, it's all screwed up after 2:21. SecretMyth isnt exactly what you'd call a ""noob"" ripper, so why was it released this way? Seems like an odd oversight for a team who prides themselves on excellent rips. I am ashamed for them. A failure for SecretMyth, and a very noobish error."
