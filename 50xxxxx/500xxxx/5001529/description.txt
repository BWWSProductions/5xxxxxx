Ulla PirttijÃ¤rvi is a Sami artist from Finland. Together with Frode Fjellheim she creates a magical world where the traditional joik is lifted up to new levels, and also mixed with other musical styles. The album takes the listener to all kinds of moods from joy to sadness, from relaxation to chaos, from the tranquil nature to the hectic city life.

She is considered to be one of the best Sami artists.
