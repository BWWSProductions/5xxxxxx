,Twizter1,2009-07-22T15:48Z,This is the s01e3 and not e1 and 2
,WillKatt,2009-07-28T01:14Z,"Twizter1 stop confusing people about episodes numbering, this is labeled correctly. Check
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132290/episodes"
,WillKatt,2009-07-28T02:02Z,"Oups, it is labeled correctly 1.02 here but the file is named wrong 1.03... This was probably the source of Twizter1's confusion. Resonance is 1.02 (see the above link)"
[T],despo1ler,2009-07-29T17:49Z,"Yeah, the confusion over episodes is because most ppl have labelled the pilot double episode as E01-02 when in fact it is only E01, this is the only copy  of this episode which is in fact labelled correctly, don't worry, I think every1 is a bit confused over this 1 but it's a great series, lol, maybe it's the warehouse 13 influence causeing the confusion over episodes to help hide it's true existence and whereabouts :D"
,henry76,2009-08-06T14:39Z,Thanks dude ;)
,Bombardem,2009-08-07T17:25Z,"Here's a link to the pilot or episode 1 and 2 or whatever people want to call it
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4990928/Warehouse.13.S01E01-E02.Pilot.HDTV.XviD-FQM.%5BVTV%5D.avi
I'm not sure why they arent in the list here yet but a normal text search of warehouse 13 shows several versions of the pilot."
,koka3,2009-08-18T23:18Z,"Thanks, finally the right episode, confusion sorted"
,Crack_Pot,2009-09-20T06:41Z,It would be nice if the pilot was listed here with the rest...
