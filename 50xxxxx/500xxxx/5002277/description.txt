Review	by William Ruhlmann

Jim Steinman (the melodramatic writer behind Meat Loaf's Bat out of Hell) is the 
author of many of the tracks here, and they have his typical rock & roll Sturm 
und Drang, especially when the backup group consists of members of Bruce 
Springsteen's E Street Band. Also on hand are The Blasters, Maria McKee, and Ry 
Cooder. The album's hit single turned out to be Dan Hartman's "I Can Dream about 
You."

                              SOME WIKIPEDIA INFO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jimmy Iovine produced five of the songs for the film and the soundtrack album.
[2] For Ellen Aim's singing voice, he combined the voices of Laurie Sargent and 
Holly Sherwood. The Attackers were the real-life (Face to Face) bandmates of 
Sargent, who provided the lead vocals on Ellen Aim's songs "Never Be You" and 
"Sorcerer" and supporting vocals on "Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young."[2] 
The version of 'Sorcerer' on the actual soundtrack album was performed by 
Marilyn Martin (written by Stevie Nicks).

Two Wagnerian rock songs written by Jim Steinman were part of the soundtrack: 
"Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young" and "Nowhere Fast," both performed by 
Fire Inc. with Holly Sherwood as lead vocal. The title of the former was used as 
the tagline on some promotional materials for the film.[2] Dan Hartman's "I Can 
Dream About You" is the most successful song from this movie and became a 
Billboard top 10 hit in 1984. In the movie, the song is performed by "the 
Sorels," a fictional doo-wop style group consisting of actors Stoney Jackson, 
Grand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson, and Robert Townsend.[2] However, the song was 
actually sung by Winston Ford, whose vocals were convincingly lip-synced by 
Stoney Jackson in the movie. There are thus two versions of the song, but the 
most popular was sung by Dan Hartman for commercial release.

                                  THE LYRICS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the first pressings (on vinyl), the album contained a leaf with the lyrics 
for all songs.  Call me old-fashioned vinylmaniac, but I want to add them here.


FIRE INC. - NOWHERE FAST

Lying in your bed and on a Saturday night
You're sweatin' buckets and it's not even hot
But your brain has got the message
And it's sending it out
To every nerve and every muscle you've got

You've got so many dreams
That you don't know where to put 'em
So you'd better turn a few of 'em loose
Your body's got a feeling that it's starting to rust
You'd better rev it up and put it to use

And I don't know how I ever thought that I could make it all alone
When you only make it better
And it better be tonight
And we'll fly away on those angel wings of chrome in your daddy's car
Waiting there for you tonight
I'll be there for you tonight

Even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And your speed
Is all you'll ever need
All you'll ever need to know
Darlin', Darlin'-

You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly
And we've gotta get away from the past
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast

Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly
They're only fighting for the chance to be last
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast
It's so much better goin' nowhere fast

Ah...

Stalkin' in the shadows by the light of the moon
It's like a prison and the night is a cell
Goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven tonight
'Cause stayin' here has gotta be hell
Dyin' in the city like a fire on the water
Let's go runnin' on the back of the wind
There's gotta be some action on the face of the earth
And I've gotta see your face once again

And I don't know where I ever got the bright idea that I was cool
So alone and independent
But I'm depending on you now
And you'll always be the only thing that I just can't be without
And I'm out for you tonight
I'm comin' out for you tonight

Even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll (ready to roll)
Even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And your speed
Is all you'll ever need
All you'll ever need to know
Darlin', Darlin'-

You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly
And we've gotta get away from the past
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast

Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly
They're only fighting for the chance to be last
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere, baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast
It's so much better goin' nowhere fast

Godspeed
Godspeed
Godspeed
Speed us away!

Godspeed
Godspeed
Godspeed
Speed us away!

Godspeed
Godspeed
Godspeed
Speed us away!

(We're goin' nowhere fast!)

(Ah...)



MARILYN MARTIN - SORCERER

I'm tired
I'm thirsty
I'm wild eyed
In my misery
Timeless
In your finery
A high price
For your luxury

(Chorus)
Sorcerer
Who is the master
Man and woman on a star stream
In the middle of a snow dream
Sorcerer
Show me the high life
Come over
Let me put you on ice

I'm tired
When I need you badly
Wild eyed
In the middle of your dream
Timeless
It's a mystery
All they way
Now it's never what you are

All around
Black ink darkness
Who found
The lady from the mountain

I'm tired
I'm thirsty
I'm wild eyed
In my mystery
Timeless
In your finery
A high price
For your luxury

(Repeat chorus) 



THE FIXX - DEEPER AND DEEPER

Talking about stealing the show no one would know
Talking about stealing the show when they're all letting go
Take a look at the witch see the twitch in her eye tell me what did she feel
Is this the way of the world take a boy and a girl show them lying is real

(Chorus)
Then I see the edge I look I fall
And I get deeper and deeper
The more I see the more I fall no place to hide
You better take the call
I get deeper and deeper

Was it the smell of the oil the sweat and the toil that made living unreal
Was it the man in the suit or the boy with the flute tell me what did he steal
Is it beginning to break can you see the mistake there'll be nowhere to go
Once in a fool's blood in the wrong neighborhood what price did he pay

(Chorus)

So make you see what I mean tell me what do I say
Hire your voice freedom of choice what do you say
So I'm talking about stealin' the show no one would know
Oh I'm talking about stealing the show when they're all letting go

(Chorus)

I see the edge I look I fall
No place to hide I better take the call
(repeat)

THE BLASTERS - ONE BAD STUD

Oh well one bad stud moved in my neighborhood
Oh well one bad stud moved in my neighborhood
He's big and man I know he ain't no good

He don't wear no hat and Lord he don't wear no shoes
He don't wear no hat and Lord he don't wear no shoes
He just hangs on the corner singin' those country blues

(Chorus)
Well one bad stud, one bad stud
One bad stud, one bad stud
I said one, one, one, one, one bad stud

If he likes your baby you can kiss your baby goodbye
If he likes your baby you can kiss your baby goodbye
Cause girls all love him like a schoolboy loves his pie

He loves his whiskey loves his rockin' rye
Yes he loves his whiskey loves his rockin' rye
You know it takes ten bottles to make that fool get high

(Chorus)

Well he stole ten dollars and they locked that cat in jail
He stole ten dollars and they locked that cat in jail
He got my baby to come and make his bail

He got great big muscles lord he lookS like a bear
Yes he got great big muscles lord he lookS like a bear
When that cat gets loose you know I won't be there

(Chorus)



FIRE INC. - TONIGHT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE YOUNG

I've got a dream 'bout an angel on the beach
And the perfect waves are starting to come
His hair is flying out in ribbons of gold
And his touch has got the power to stun

I've got a dream 'bout an angel in the forest
Enchanted by the edge of a lake
His body's flowing in the jewels of light
And the earth below him's starting to shake

But I don't see any angels in the city
I don't hear any holy choirs sing
And if I can't get an angel
I can still get a boy
And a boy would be the next best thing
The next best thing to an angel
A boy would be the next best thing

I've got a dream 'bout a boy in a castle
And he's dancing like a cat on the stairs
He's got the fire of a prince in his eyes
And the thunder of a drum in his ears

I've got a dream 'bout a boy on a star
Lookin' down upon the rim of the world
He's there all alone and dreamin' of someone like me
I'm not an angel but at least I'm a girl

I've got a dream when the darkness is over
We'll be lyin' in the rims of the sun
But it's only a dream and tonight is for real
You'll never know what it means
But you'll know how it feels
It's gonna be over (over)
Before you know it's begun
(Before you know it's begun)

It's all we really got tonight
Stop your cryin' hold on (tonight)
Before you know it it's gone (tonight)
Tonight is what it means to be young
Tonight is what it means to be young

Let the revels begin
Let the fire be started
We're dancing for the restless and the broken-hearted
Let the revels begin
Let the fire be started
We're dancing for the desperate and the broken-hearted
Let the revels begin ...(Tonight is what it means to be young...)
Let the fire be started ...(Before you know it it's gone...)
We're dancing for the restless and the broken-hearted
Let the revels begin
Let the fire be started
We're dancing for the desperate and the broken-hearted

Say a prayer in the darkness for the magic to come
No matter what it seems
Tonight is what it means to be young
Before you know it it's gone
Tonight is what it means to be young
Before you know it it's gone

Ah...

I've got a dream when the darkness is over
We'll be lyin' in the rims of the sun
But it's only a dream and tonight is for real
You'll never know what it means
But you'll know how it feels
It's gonna be over (over)
Before you know it's begun

It's all we really got tonight
Stop your cryin' hold on (tonight)
Before you know it it's gone (tonight)
Tonight is what it means to be young
Tonight is what it means to be young...

The things they're saying
And then the things they do
Nothin's gonna stop us if our aim is true...

The things they're saying
And then the things they do
Nothin's gonna stop us if our aim is true...

The things they're saying
And then the things they do
Nothin's gonna stop us if our aim is true...

(Tonight is what it means to be young...)



MARIA MCKEE - NEVER BE YOU

Take a look in my eyes
It's been a long, long time
I used to feel so strong
When I knew you were mine
Since you let me down
I'm hard to be around
I don't know what I'm gonna do
He could never be you
He could never be you
He could never be you

I guess it all comes around
Baby please don't cry
Love is gonna be a little reckless
Oh Love is all I have to stand trial
But since you let me go
There's nothing going on
I don't know what I'm gonna do
He could never be you
He could never be you
He could never be you

He knows the moves
He play's the part
But he only has me
He don't have my heart
He could never be you
He could never be you

So take a look in my eyes
No you can't hide the truth
No, you don't get by on pride
Cause it'll run over you
But since you let me down
I'm hard to be around
I don't know what I'm gonna do
He could never be you
He could never be you
He could never be you

SOLO
He could never be you?



DAN HARTMAN - I CAN DREAM ABOUT YOU

No more timing each tear that falls from my eyes
I'm not hiding the remedy to cure this old heart of mine

CHORUS:

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

REPEAT CHORUS

Moving sidewalks, I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from down here below where the streets see
me lonely for you.

CHORUS

I can dream about you
I'm gonna press my lips against you and hold you tight to me
I can dream about you
You know you got me spellbound what else can it be

Moving sidewalks, I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from the pain in my heart 'cause it's you that I need.

I don't understand it
I can't keep my mind off loving you
Ooo, now baby, I'm caught up in the magic I see in you
There's one thing to do

CHORUS TWICE TO FADE



RY COODER - HOLD THAT SNAKE

I love my baby
Like a bull dog loves his bone
Last night she got crazy
Called me up on the phone
Said come on over daddy
'Cause I hates drinkin' alone

Said I had me a little
And I had to have a little more
Try to get up, could not get out the door
And there's a big ole snake
That's crawlin' right across the floor

My baby's not afraid to take a chance
Drinkin' whiskey starts her thinkin' about romance
That's when she wants
What I keep in my pants

I know she's got a few tricks up her sleeve
When she gets hot it's not hard to believe
So I told my baby
Just what Adam said to Eve

Chorus
Hold that snake 'till I make it
Hold on 'till your daddy gets there
Just grab his head and shake it
Tell him be ain't goin' nowhere
Take it easy but take it
But don't let go of that snake
Till I make it


THE BLASTERS - BLUE SHADOWS


I've been around the world
And every man bleeds the same
But when the lights are dim
You never know who's to blame
I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows
No other place for me to go
No other place for dying slow
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

I've been around the world
I take credit for the things I've done
But when the lights are dim
I'm not the only guilty one
I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

I've been around the world
And every story ends the same
But when the lights are dim
You won't remember my name
I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows
No other place for me to go
No other place for dying slow
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

No other place for me to go
No other place for dying slow
So I'll be killing, just killing time
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
