I'd always thought this EP was also called Future Perfect, but according to wikipedia it's called 'Demonstration'. 
It features demo versions of 4 tracks that ended up on the 'Future Perfect' album, as well as the track 'Future Perfect' which, ironically, didn't make the cut.

Tracklisting:
1. Turnstile Blues
2. Angry Candy
3. Future Perfect
4. Sugarless
5. Underorbit
