Maybe from the album Revelations ?
And Tyketto: Wings
More Southern Rock is also always right.
Ted Nugent No No No or any video with him that you not already have uploaded here.
Motley Crue - Sick Love Song (the video)
Badlands, H.S.A.S or any good classic hardrock.

Thanks. you know you are the best."
