The End of Heartache is the 2004 album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. The album is the first to feature vocalist Howard Jones, of the band Blood Has Been Shed, who joined in 2002, replacing Jesse Leach. Drummer Justin Foley, who was in Blood Has Been Shed with Jones, also joined the band, replacing former drummer Tom Gomes, who left the band for personal reasons.

The new lineup played on the 2003 Ozzfest and the MTV2 Headbangers Ball tour. The first recording was the song "When Darkness Falls" appearing on the soundtrack to the 2003 horror film Freddy vs. Jason. The End of Heartache was released on May 11, 2004. The album debuted in the top 40 of the Australian album charts on May 17, 2004 following a successful tour of that country with Anthrax.

The album was nominated for Best Metal Performance for the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.

Two music videos for "Rose of Sharyn" and "The End of Heartache" were filmed in promotion of the album. "Rose of Sharyn" had the group performing in a sunny desert with blood dripping from dead branches to form words. "The End of Heartache" featured a darkly lit performance with various computer animated imagery with scenes from Resident Evil: Apocalypse dotted throughout. Both videos saw notable airplay on Headbanger's Ball.

In 2005, a special edition of the album was released which contained 6 additional tracks.

The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on December 7, 2007.
