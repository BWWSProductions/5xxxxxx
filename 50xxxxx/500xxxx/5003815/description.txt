Bonus: The Loss Of Liberty (52 minutes)

Special guest Sarah Brightman takes the stage with Bocelli for "Time to 

Say Goodbye."

Andrea always wanted to do this: the theme is Bocelli's fulfillment of 

a personal dream honouring America's Italian heritage and musical 

tradition.

Filmed July 6, 2000 "under the stars" at New Jersey's Liberty State 

Park in front of an audience of 12,000, Thirteen/WNET's sumptuous 

production, directed by David Horn, captures a sense of spectacle and 

adds footage of Bocelli visiting the statue for the first time.

The musical firepower is supplied by Bocelli and guests Ana Maria 

Martinez and Sarah Brightman, who sing nearly two hours of operatic 

arias and popular Italian songs (plus Brightman's hypnotic performance 

of "The Music of the Night" from "The Phantom of the Opera"), solo and 

together with the evening's charismatic star.

The orchestral firepower is supplied by the New Jersey Symphony, 

conducted by Zdenek Macal with music by Smetana and Leonard Bernstein. 

The hosting is done with elegant, smarmy enthusiasm by Midge Woolsey 

and Valerie Smaldone.

 Enjoy!
