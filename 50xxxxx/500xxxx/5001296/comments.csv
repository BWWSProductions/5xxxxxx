I don't remember communists ever advocating the abolition of taxation."
[V],rambam1776,2009-07-16T23:55Z,Quite correct - nothing is farther from the total state control of communism than the libertarian advocacy of individual responsibility.
,Dr_Q,2009-07-19T16:20Z,"The 2nd item listed on the platform in the Communist Manifesto is ""A heavy progressive or graduated income tax."""
,sharpsuit,2009-07-22T22:40Z,"And to correct rambam1776: Communism = STATELESS (and classless) society. The lack of state is the single most defining feature of a communist society.

A stateless society can obviously never have ""total state control"". That's absurd.

What you're probably talking about is ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" which in _leninistic_ theory is ment to be a temporary state socialism."
