Dummy is the 1994 debut album of the Bristol-based group Portishead. It reached #2 on the UK Album Chart and #79 on the Billboard 200 chart, going gold in 1997.  
Building on the promise of their earlier EPâ€”"Numb"â€”it helped to cement the reputation of Bristol as the capital of Trip hop, a nascent genre which was then often referred to simply as "the Bristol sound".The cover is a still of Gibbons from the short film that the band createdâ€”To Kill a Dead Manâ€”which originally got them signed due to their self composed soundtrack
