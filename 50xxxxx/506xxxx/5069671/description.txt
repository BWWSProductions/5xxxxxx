This is a 2 disk DVD that I made a couple years ago, all menus and set up are put together by me but all videos and pictures are files I have previously downloaded over the years so some videos might not be the best quality. Some videos are ripped from a DVD but most are just downloaded from the net.

The DVDs are in PAL format.

The videos are most of their videos from their first album up to Take a Look in the Mirror album as well as bonus videos.

These DVDs were made from the same videos as my other Torrent, so if you just want the video files individually then check out my other Torrent at:
 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5054105/Korn_-_25_Music_Videos 

That Torrent has more of their newer videos but doesnt have the extra videos that this one has.
