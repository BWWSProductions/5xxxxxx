still trying to find the Easter eggs, help??
the only one i think was an EE was the Follow the leader add with MM, right???"

yes that was one of the easter eggs, going by memory one is on the main menu, just push up from the first option and it should go to a little icon on munkys eye...another one is on the credits page, just push right and it should highlight the word korn....one is on the parental advisary in one of the albums....im having trouble remembering the last one but if u just push right on every page, and then left on every page, and then down on every page and then up on every page u should find them all :P
Thanks for the comment :)"
