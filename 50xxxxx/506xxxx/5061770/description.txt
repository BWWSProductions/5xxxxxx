NOTES:
Right here's a ppv of the world's greatest dad.....
Original source was a trs file or something like....can't say i ever came across before.
Anyway the source itself was pretty good,specially for a ppv rip.....needed a few tweaks here
and there but not too much....
Thaks fatal for the rs links cheers m8ty ;-)


WORK DONE:
Firstly i needed to crop both sides due to lines down either one ....
Once done i then decided to increase the gamma and lum slightly and contrast alot....lower the rgb
black base and also change the rgb colours slightly...thought there was too much red and yellow.
Also used a contour and sharpen filter to give it that bit more life.
Oh also fix the interlace issues and the bad ivtc.
Audio just gave it a little boost

Overall based on a PPV V9 A9 M6......For a ppv rip this is one of the best i've seen....shame about the 4:3 screen but
otherwise this is a really nice release with nice audio
