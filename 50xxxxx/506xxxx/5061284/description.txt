Pattern Magic book - in Japanese but clear diagrams mean that non-Japanese speakers can figure it out. Very unusual patternmaking book - probably more about learning how to make 3D textures with fabric and patterns than actually making to wear most of these experimental outfits! RAR file of JPEGS - but I get it to display with a sequential image viewer (like CDisplay on Windows) as an e-book. Enjoy - I picked this up via eMule some time ago. Now if only I can track down PM Vol. 2... any ideas?

Oh yeah... seeeeeed mateys.... I, like most, am not always online :)
