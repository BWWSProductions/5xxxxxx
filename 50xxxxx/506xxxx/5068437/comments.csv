I cannot escape the great lies told and passed down by dessert rats,they have destroyed whole nations of peoples and are well on their way in destroying the whole of earth.My fellow man has it in his heart to deceive me on the bases of thought that he is better and i am not ."

There are no interviews or opposing perspectives and he seems to think that freedom to worship in the USSR is worse than the collapse of communism. He's obviously a religious nut himself as he constantly refers to the book of revelations as though it's fact without bearing in mind that it was the Romans that compiled the Bible with just 4 Gospels, while banning over 20 as heresy including the Gospel of St Peter who they claim as the rock their church is built on. Whereas it was more likely Mary Magdalene who the Romans turned into a slut because they never treated women  with equal respect and were riddled with class discrimination for centuries before Constantine made Christianity his political pet. There is also no real evidence that Revelations was written by John, more likely his name was added to give that rubbish some Christian credibility and it was used to pad out the New Testament. The bible is predominantly the Old Testament which contradicts the teachings of Jesus but was stuck there for political reasons and to give it weight. Made in the 1990's this conspiracy theory is out of date, exposes little that isn't already known and is not amazing. But hey don't take my word for it, see if you can put up with his waffle.

@Monteromailnet Don't blame religion for everything. Greed, corruption and powerlust are the major players of conspiracy, it just happens that religion is not exempt from these human weaknesses."
