best greetings"
,captainretep,2009-12-15T19:25Z,"Like all the other torrents. Episodes 2,3, and 6 do NOT work."
,Fox_Almighty,2010-01-05T07:48Z,"Captain loser above me doesn't update his codecs once in a while... all episodes work perfectly fine. Thank you for this great upload, the season is awesome."
,hotwire01,2010-01-06T06:00Z,dont work for me also..... after 15mins into each ep its cut off.
,captainretep,2010-01-21T19:21Z,"Fox_Ignorant didn't realize that I have update all my my codecs and they still didn't work. Every torrent for Season 13 doesn't work. They get to about 8 mins in, then close."
,Denver542,2010-02-08T07:29Z,"It shuts down after a few minutes for me to. What is the problem? How do I solve it?
(I do have the latest codec.)"
,gboys,2010-03-10T11:22Z,"Here http://www.katzforums.com/showpost.php?p=1526916&postcount=1 is a post for season 13,use JD to download."
,simkusdavid,2010-03-11T19:24Z,"Use Windows Home Cinema Player. It's clean, simple and very stable. I got mine after installing K-lite codec pack, it gives you an option to install it and I've never used any other WMP since. "
,fosilia,2010-05-24T12:33Z,"This is SHIT! I've downloaded it twice, because i thought i made an error. But no, i still cant find the episodes anywhere on my computer? Where are they!?!?"
,Psycho817,2010-08-18T06:02Z,"the reason this wont work for anyone is because you dumbfucks are using codec packs, which are utter shit.

learn something about video decoding."
,hammerheadieaglethrust,2011-03-10T18:51Z,thanks a lot!
,mrmojorisin91,2011-05-19T05:00Z,Horrible quality and slow download.
,Bigk4484,2011-08-04T10:32Z,"For those of you who just want to watch the episodes and they keep stopping at like 15 minutes, just download this.
