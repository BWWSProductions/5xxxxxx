Dia Zerva was last years runner up to the Championship. This year she is ranked 1st and is undefeated. Few wrestlers train off the mat as hard as Dia and it shows. 

Wenona is a seasoned veteran, the most ripped warrior we have. A former All-American Gymnast, this girl brings the muscle and the flexibility. Wenona is in the best shape of her wrestling career and has been one of the most active wrestlers this year if you add in the Tag Team league 

Amazing competition in this match up.
