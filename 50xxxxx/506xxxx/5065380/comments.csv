People who are starting to play BMX games, pick up Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX because that is more convenient and it has better graphics too."
[T],n2kmaster,2011-12-11T04:31Z,"Really, i found this gameplay much nicer than Dave Mirra and found the soundtrack was better, but to be fair i played a lot of tony hawk and i found the earlier tony hawks transition to this was identical, so if you liked tony hawk games on psx, and got a controller on your pc this is not that bad of a game."
