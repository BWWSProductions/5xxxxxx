Hey everyone! I saw that the second CD of the classic PC game Backpacker 2 was mysteriously missing from the site, and because I love it and recently refound it at home I decided to share it with the world.

Both CDs are included.

Tips on running under XP/Vista are here: (Swedish only)

You can also try running a Windows 95 Virtual PC; it worked for me...

I hope you enjoy it; I'll seed as much as I can because I love it!

Also, I consider this game "abandonware", but if anyone disagrees and wishes for me to remove it, I'll do so at once. I just want to play an old game for nostalgic reasons and I know there are others out there who want the same - besides, you can't find it in stores and it's at least a decade since it was released, so I decided to post this. Hope you're all travelling the world and enjoying this game as much as me!

Travel greetings,
Lovykar
