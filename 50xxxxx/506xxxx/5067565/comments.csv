But about 58 of those torrents are not been seeded and there is many leeches on some of them. 
If you could reseed some of those torrents i am sure you would not be far away grom gaining a TRUSTED STATUS SKULL on the piratebay. 

Or maybe that might not interest you.

Anyway thanks again and keep up the good work.

Everyone Please Seed Back Your Downloads.

I was using bitcomet and have been for years and have now changed to utorrent which allows me to see things much better - seeders, leechers and how many have downloaded.  Since I have been using the new client there have been no problems I will get back to re upping those that have failed.
Thanks again"
