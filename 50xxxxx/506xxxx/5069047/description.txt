1. Unpack the .iso from the .rar file with WinRAR or similar free program such as IZArc.

2. Burn .iso image file on a DVD-R at the slowest speed possible using Nero Burning ROM or similar free program such as ImgBurn.

3. If you can't yet play backup copies on your Wii, visit WiikendHacks.com which has the most useful, informative and straight-forward guides I've found thus far.
