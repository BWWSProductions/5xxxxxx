FERN HILL is a coming of age story about four 13 year old boys on a weekend in 1987 into the mountains of Colorado in search of a father and a lost plane. The unexplained mystery of Colin's father and his small Cesna that disappeared seven years ago compels a boy to find an answer, or at least try. And true friends understand ... so together, they leave. Adventure, struggle, fear, and hope binds a story of real lives and leaves a healing memory of youth and redemption.
