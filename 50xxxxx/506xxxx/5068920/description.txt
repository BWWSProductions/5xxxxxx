The Haskell School of Expression 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the use of
functions (in contrast to object-oriented programming, which emphasizes the
use of objects). It has become popular in recent years because of its
simplicity, conciseness, and clarity. This book teaches functional
programming as a way of thinking and problem solving, using Haskell, the
most popular purely functional language. Rather than using the conventional
(boring) mathematical examples commonly found in other programming language
textbooks, the author uses examples drawn from multimedia applications,
including graphics, animation, and computer music, thus rewarding the reader
with working programs for inherently more interesting applications. Aimed at
both beginning and advanced programmers, this tutorial begins with a gentle
introduction to functional programming and moves rapidly on to more advanced
topics. Details about progamming in Haskell are presented in boxes
throughout the text so they can be easily found and referred to.
