,baggies91mkp,2009-08-31T20:11Z,i keep getting a red cross no file path. pretty sick joke
,MeCervantes,2009-09-03T23:00Z,"Not a joke.

The torrent is working fine for me. Dunno what is wrong from your end. Sorry for the inconvenience.

You can find the same files at demonoid w/ a different torrent file and tracker. Perhaps that will help."
,Mourek001,2009-11-05T05:50Z,"Very good?
Why not lossless??? (flac, ape...)"
,beelze8361,2009-11-11T03:07Z,Disc 24-20 & Disc 24-21 names are too long to function with any program. I would be forever in your debt if you could shorten them. Sorry 'bout that. Thanks
,MeCervantes,2009-12-04T08:34Z,"Mourke asks:

Why not lossless? As stated in the torrent description, all these files are (or at least were) already available in lossless format here on this website. If you want lossless, compile them yourself... and add your own tags. I don't understand the need for lossless recordings of a very lossy (pre digital) concert anyway. This compilation is over 24 hours long. In this case the complete and intact metadata seemed more important than the perfect quality of the recordings. 

For more info, read the data listed in the TORRENT DESCRIPTION... which you probably should have done before complaining.

Beelze:

As for the lengthy track names, use the text file in the torrent description to shorten them yourself. It won't take you long. You may also wish to consider updating your computer's audio program. If it can't list long track names, it is probably pretty old.

Besides, there is only one CD you are having trouble with, and the songs on that CD, for the most part, are alternate recordings of tracks already listed in the above CD's. The Bonus CD isn't THAT special... really.

Also, the names work on iTunes as written. See if that helps.

Good luck, and thanks for the feedback. I am slowly working on version 3.2... I wonder if the official version 4 will be released first.

We'll see."
,secher,2010-06-28T06:46Z,"Well, I would certainly love to see 4.0 come out.  I was just on the phone with my parents with whom I used to sing many of these songs growing up.  I was there, sort of... not yet out in this wide world, still curled up en utero, but I was there.  :)  
Anyway, from my parents old 8-track there was a few minutes of talking preceding the song ""Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man"", ending with Ronald Ray Gun Zap... I remember this very clearly because I thought for a while that Ronald Reagan's name was Raygunzap.  In any case, I have not been able to find that 'speech' ever since, and the 8-tracks are long gone.
Do you have that commentary, and could you include it on 4.0?  It is not on any of the others I've heard, either the bootleg nor the complete set.
Thanks much.
By the way, bleeding fantastic work man, outstanding.  We are all in your debt.  Do you have a charity you favor?

Peace."

I was just 2 1/2 weeks away from my 7th birthday when my Biological Father and my Step-Cousin ""Kidnapped"" me from my tyrannical Right Wing Conservative Adopted Father and whisked me away to Bethel New York and the Magical Max Yasgur's Farm where I grooved on peace and good vibes and learned about ""The Music....Man!!"" and had three days of fun and music and nothing but three days of fun and music!! This is beautiful man...It really is...I had the old 12 disc version some rip off artist sold me from E-Bay 7 years ago and they have long since gotten scratchy due to the shoddiness of the CD that was used...But I know have this FOREVER!! and I'm converting this to my MP4 player as well as putting it on whatever you call those little stick thingys!! Thank you so much...you made this old man happy!! Peace, Love and don't take the brown acid man!! "
,Duane420,2011-01-26T03:22Z,I also wish to add that the download speed of this was the fastest I have ever experienced for a file of this size on my slow ass linux computer!!
