Well folks, here is the latest update of the, 'Woodstock Complete' Project.

The, 'Woodstock Complete' Project is an attempt to put the longest and best quality tracks together chronologically, so the listener can enjoy the experience, from beginning to end, as if they were there.

Every version of Woodstock Complete is a little different. This is mine.

This is not an official update. I simply (to the best of my ability) chronologically inserted all the newest releases since version 3.0 (Including 'Woodstock Forty Years On/Back to Max Yasgur's/Limited Edition Box Set', as well as Johnny Winter, Jefferson Airplane and Santana's Woodstock Experience CDs). 

Like all the other versions of Woodstock Complete, there are most certainly errors. Hell, mistakes are part of the fun. I wasn't there. I wish I was, but I wasn't... and chances are, neither were you. 

I did my best to insert all the newest tracks where I thought they belonged. I also edited some older tracks to remove redundancies.

I have no doubt the official version 4.0 will be out soon (with clips from the extended movie and more), but until then, enjoy this!

There are 316 files in this compilation and it lasts over 24 hours if you play it straight through from beginning to end.

It took me 3 days to compile all the info and metadata for the tracks.

I converted the original songs from .FLAC to 160kb MP3 for one simple reason, to keep the metadata intact. 

If you want .FLAC quality recordings, you can find almost everything you need here on The Pirate Bay, but it will take you a long time to assemble and update everything from version 3.0 to present... and you will need to tag every single song. 

It takes a long... Long... LONG time.



Disc 24 is a bonus disc with extra sound clips not used in the rest of the compilation. It is a great disc. Disc 24 alone is worthy of any collection.



My thanks to everyone who has had a hand in this project.

Recreating The Complete Woodstock, one song at a time, is an amazing hobby! 
 
Seed this piece of history for as long as possible.

If you notice any errors, please post them in the comments section.

I will do what I can (within reason) to keep this upload as accurate as possible.
