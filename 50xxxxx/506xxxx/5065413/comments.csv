,bspeedo2,2009-08-23T18:03Z,"I am not so handy with computers.

1. If you ever used any crack hit Original Files and replace yours with those.

Could You explain what to do,step by step? and where I can find the Files?
Thanks."
,dmanthing,2009-08-23T18:54Z,run the crack and hit ORIGINAL FILES... then see readme to find locations of files that need to be replaced
,bspeedo2,2009-08-23T20:24Z,"Thanks for the info,I will try this.Regards."
,bspeedo2,2009-08-25T17:05Z,"I am not getting acces to the maps,it was denied."
,dmanthing,2009-08-26T02:02Z,you have to unlock them first... navigate to folder BEFORE: AppData and hit continue... then you may proceed

,kukaster,2009-10-08T19:25Z,Thanx *dmanthing*  Works great and its simple as hell:D 
,ramroop,2009-12-01T17:32Z,"Great job with this, works like a charm.  The only hitch I ran into was when trying to copy over the tokens file.  But an easy workaround was to disable the Software Protection service, copy the file over, then restart the service.

Thanks for this upload.. it's the only thing that's worked after trying a dozen other cracks/activators.  Cheers :D"
,dmanthing,2009-12-08T13:02Z,"you probbably did ran some other cracks before, do a fresh install"
,garyoo,2009-12-16T08:35Z,"I could not seem to copy the pkeyconfig files to replace the old ones. It says it require permission to modify the content. But Iam the administrator of the pc and the only user of this pc. 
Thanks for any help reply."

,r00kie87,2010-03-05T08:33Z,"Not working for me. 

Using Win7 Ultimate 7600 x64

Disabled Software Protection via services.msc and restored original files before proceeding. No effect at all. Ran as administrator, and no issues with accessing files.

Still have watermark and nag screens."
,Koldfyre666,2010-03-08T11:07Z,"for anyone still having difficulties with activation, it's probably due to the March 2010 update (KB971033) which removes all Windows 7 Activation cracks... i recommend this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5396034/Windows_7_crack_RemoveWAT_2.2.5.Hazar_carter67

it's a tool called RemoveWAT (Windows Activation Tecchnologies)  As the name suggests, it completely removes all of the Windows Activation Technologies, but still enable the user to get updates... it did the trick for me..."
,Jman747,2010-04-09T06:00Z,"Worked perfectly; no problems whatsoever. Thanks a bunch. Seeding it now.

I used this when I had about 4 days left on the activation grace period- now it says genuine. (No watermark, black screen, etc.. all good)"

After I used this to activate, I removed WAT so I can download updates and they will never break activation.

These two programs together are the ultimate in 7 activation."
