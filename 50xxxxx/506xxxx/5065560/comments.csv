,Syddistic,2009-08-23T21:38Z,"Your welcome Rob, I'm glad you appreciate it. I'm glad the torrent has been such a success. Again, please rate up or comment, i'm pretty sure you don't need to be registered to rate the quality. If anyone has a request for a piece of software, a keygen, a game, (or pretty much any other computer related accessory) that they just cant find elsewhere, comment or email me and I will do the best I can. my email is Syddistic@live.com"

,BCBuddy,2012-03-13T03:33Z,"Important Note: To install a VST effect, simply put it in your VST folder. If you don't know where your VST folder is, then simply create a new folder and then go into the Preferences of Mixcraft, Spin It Again, or Beatcraft and on the Miscellaneous tab click ""Edit VST Effect Folders..."" Then add the new VST folder that you created and restart the software. (VST effects are .DLLs and they should be put in your VST folder.)

The following software programs support VST & DirectX Effect plugins:
Mixcraft
Beatcraft
Spin It Again
DJ Twist & Burn
