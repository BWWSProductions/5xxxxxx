This is Extra Boy vocal remover(version 1.1.4), this software can be used to create acapellas or instrumentals, but i'm sure the resourceful can come up with several more purposes.


"Extra Boy is designed primarily for removing vocals from stereo audio files. However, the versatility available may lend itself to other uses as this is no ordinary vocal remover. Extra Boy incorporates two completely different algorithms for vocal removal - choose whichever suits your material best or combine both.

Key features:

â˜ High quality vocal removal or isolation with maximum stereo field preservation.

â˜ Mode 1 - Spectral based vocal removal algorithm utilizing the "Stereolize" correction process (Elevayta proprietary).

â˜ Mode 2 - Spatial based vocal removal utilizing the "Spreadilate" algorithm (Elevayta proprietary).

â˜ Hi-Res Mode.

â˜ All parameters can be fully automated.

â˜ Choose between either mode or combine."


It uses frequencies to operate in general so its purposes are endless, enjoy.

(PS. You may be thinking "why are you posting this? this isnt even the Pro Version" well, my answer is that A. Its not posted on Pirate Bay as far as I know,
and B. It used to be free, but the creators put a 90 cent bandwidth fee paid through Paypal, so I payed the 90 cents and decided to make a torrent just incase somebody who is in dire need, doesn't have paypal.)
