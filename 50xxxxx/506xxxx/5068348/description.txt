Another killer session from Cal Tjader.  There are two stand-out classics on this album.  The first is the live recording of "Los Bandidos" which is awesome and a reworking of "Samba Do SueÃ±ho" from the classic "Bamboleate" album with Eddie Palmieri.  This version of "Samba Do SueÃ±ho" is more uptempo with an incredibly tight and slamming rhythm section.  It also has a fantastic piano solo by Al Zulacia.  This version just keeps getting better and better so grab it because it's hot!

Due to the popularity of 'Samba do Suenho', this was a very sought after album by 'rare groove' DJs in the 1990s.  But all tracks are great here.  It's surely one of the most consistent sessions Tjader did for Verve and it's one of his purest latin jazz sessions of the '60s, too.
