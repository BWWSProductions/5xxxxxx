There are other ways you can perform the upgrade. Use Disk Utility to do a restore from the DMG to an external HDD, or another partition on the local computer."

I will post below how to install Snow Leopard via an external HDD which is the method I used."
,ThunderDragonX,2009-09-15T23:14Z,"Instructions to install Snow Leopard DMG via External HDD

Tested and Works

* On your external USB or Firewire HDD, create a 10GB Mac OS X Extended partition, format this partition and leave it blank. You will need this later on.
* Mount the .DMG file
* Using Disk Utility, Select the RESTORE Tab
* Right Click on the ""Mac OS X Install DVD"" and select it as the SOURCE
* Right Click on your USB/Firewire 10GB Partition and select it as DESTINAION
* Check off ""Erase Destination""
* Click Restore
* Wait for Restore to complete
* Once restore is complete, you will notice that your 10GB Partition name is called ""Mac OS X Install DVD""
* Unmount the Disk Image
* LEAVE THE USB/FIREWIRE DRIVE CONNECTED
* Restart your Mac and hold the Option Key to get the startup disk menu
* Select the External HDD, Labelled ""Mac OS X Install DVD""
* Booting from the External HDD works and it's fast!! Anytime you want to install Snow Leopard on any Intel Mac Computer, all you need to do is bring your External Drive, connect it, reboot and install. "

,jfcarbel,2009-11-19T07:05Z,"-mafia128
You can burn it to a DVD on a PC only for the purpose of backing up the dmg file.  It will however not work as the install disk, for that you need to borrow a Mac and use the Disk Utility, read more of the comments here and someone mentions how to use OSX Disk Utility.  To just backup the file on the PC using Nero, just burn the disc as a data disc using UDF format."
,jfcarbel,2009-11-19T07:08Z,"-toco004
Yes, you can if you install it using the newly recommended install from retail disc method that is documented on many new guides for Snow Leopard.  But you also must follow some precautions noted in netkas.org Nov 9th post."

how did you convert it from dmg to iso??"
,Delmar78,2009-12-14T22:30Z,"Works perfectly!!

Installed in on my Imac and Mac mini, straight over an existing Leopard and all my settings and stuff were still there after the installation.

Installed it via an external drive, just make a partition on the drive and load the dmg up to that partition in disk utilities , restart, as soon as you hear the Apple sound press the option key(alt) and choose the external partition with snow leopard and start the installation.

Simple as hell!!

My mac mini became much quicker with SL!"
,andy72184,2009-12-16T09:38Z,The real thing at the store works better then this one it's faster I can tell the difference on startup.  Enough of this bullshit
,ODBC,2009-12-16T17:40Z,"I tried this at work today, and I'm happy to say that it worked like a charm.

Procedure to make it work properly for those having trouble:

First, get a DOUBLE LAYER DVD-R to burn it on (DVD-R (DL)).

Second, lock the .dmg file to avoid altering it accidentally.

Third, use Apple's own DISK TOOL to burn it. You do not need to mount it to burn, just drag it to the disk list, select it, and click BURN. Remember to let the burn verify to avoid bad DVD media.

Four, mount it on the desktop, quit all open apps, use Disk Tool to run a verify AND a permission check on your boot disk, and when those are done, install Snow Leopard from the DVD - no need to reboot from the disk.

Tadaa! Happy Christmas! "

This is also the first Mac OS release dating back to System 7.1.2 that does not support the PowerPC architecture, as Apple now intends to focus on its current line of Intel-based products.

General requirements
* Mac computer with an Intel processor
* 1GB of memory
* 5GB of available disk space
* DVD drive for installation
* Some features require a compatible Internet service provider; fees may apply.

Yes, it is possible to use this on a PC, however the experience will vary depending on your hardware. A good majority of machines will experience severe problems or no functionality whatsoever, however again, depending on your hardware, it may work flawlessly.

Second one, no error, but install wouldn't even start up, and yes, I did hold down c to get it to read from disc. For some reason, toast writes the .dmg itself onto the disc, unlike disk utility which imprinted to .dmg onto the dvd and allowed me to actually select ""install Mac OS X"" from the DVD instead of opening the .dmg from the DVD and selecting it from the separate mounted image that popped up. Then, tried disk utility one more time, and it hit an error five minutes in. So far, four DVDs gone. One left before I have to buy some more. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Mac OS X Will not run on a windows pc with out a lot of hard work and some hacking of your bios. (or a slave hd)
Further more. you allso need to have the right specs to run it (eg prossesser has to be less then 3 years old and in 98% of the things i have read) must be duel core for it to run on windows computers.

Windows will not boot as there is no boot.ini

further more you can burn this using any iso burning software i like using power iso my self. i find it very simple and easy. you can get it off this site.

Any way.. please stop asking if you can run mac os x on a windows pc.. its possable.. just check around on google.. but most likely unless you have a good pc it wont work."

Click on the Options... button and select GUID as your Partition Type. Lastly, click on the Partition button to format/partition your external drive as GUID.

,hadley8899,2010-03-25T18:00Z,"I am downloading this currently ....

I have a couple of questions 

I want to do a clean install of this on my PC,

Ive read about alot about installing this image onto a USB drive or external drive

What i want to know is could i write this image to a DVD-DL and boot of it and install this succsessfully onto a blank HDD ??

The reason i ask this is because I do not have a MAC pc i could use to set up the boot for the USB Drive...... 

Which leads to my next question .... Could this somehow be done under windows or ubuntu 9.10 ??(the making of the boot USB drive) 

my specs are 

Q6600 @ 3.4
4GB corsair RAM
HD4870 

Cheers for any help it is much appreciated "

idk if you are still looking for an answer, but if so i do have a suggestion. not 100% certain this will solve the issue for you, but when i was having trouble booting off the install disk for Leopard on my computer a while back, i learned (after much searching and eventually a 30 minute ride to an apple store for a simple ass solution) that holding down [and my memory may be fuzzing up on me, next time i restart my computer and try it out and let you know for certain what key it is] the option key brings you to the Boot From... menu on a Mac. sorry to not have answered you sooner, just now saw your question. if you haven't already found a way to make it work, i hope that this helps you."

From my personal experience it is kind of slow and if you get one scratch on that dvd it wont work. Also you need an SSE2 or SSE3 processor download a program called \""CPUZ\"" (google it) it will tell you everything you need to know about your motherboard and anything connected to it. If you have the basics there still is a small chance it wont work because of certain other hardware issues for more info there is a wiki on it look it up i think you can download the .iso from there or a .torrent for the .ios (google it).nna: Have windows installednb: Download and install \""CPUZ\""nc: Check to see if your processor is compatible (use cpuz program find processor info must say             sse2 or sse3)nnd: If compatible download the .iso burn it to a dvd.ne: Backup any data you need if formatting your Hard Drivenf: Boot computer from dvdng: Install normallynh: DO NOT INSTALL ANY OS UPDATES!!!!!

To my knowledge there are a handfull of Windows computers out there with it. What Psystar did was made an EFI boot iso called \""Rebel EFI\"" wich let OS X read your Bios and install normally i am in the process of trying it right now.nna: download and install cpuz check to see if processor is sse2 or sse3nnb: Either vist Psystar.com donate $20.00 or more and get a copy of \""Rebel EFI\"" (when th law suit is over) or google (Rebel EFI Torrent) nnc: Dowload itnd: Burn it to a cdne: Download Mac OS X Leopard iso (Dont know if it works with snow leopard im gonna try it anyway)nnf: Burn it to a dvd dl (DVD Dual Layer)ng: Backup any data you need if formatting your Hard Drivenh: Boot computer from Rebel EFI cdni: select install OS Xnj: Eject the rebel EFI cd and put in the regular osx dvd (you need a dvd drive that can read dvd dual layers)nnk: wait for it to load and install normallynl: violanm: i belive you can install any updates you want just not big ones like 10.7"

1. I converted the .dmg file to .iso by using this converter that someone else linked in this very long thread http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5346322/UltraISO.Premium.Edition.v9.3.6.2760.Incl.Keygen-ZWT.5346322.TPB.torrent

2. Using VMWare Workstation, I used this program to allow VMWare to see OSX installations: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=220750

3. Started a new virtual machine and pointed VMWare to the iso file.

Note, MAC OSX will only install if your processor supports Intel Virtualisation Technology (VT). 

I hope this helps someone else, because I've been wanting to do this for months! The end result is working albeit running a bit slow. "

Can anyone PLEASE tell me how to fix this issue?

,lewframex,2010-12-08T06:57Z,"Okay if you are using a USB drive and it says:
'The Application ""Install Mac OS X"" cannot be used from this volume'
You have to restart your computer. Whilst it is starting up, hold down the 'Option' key. It will come up with a 'Macintosh HD' icon and a '(yourUSBname)'. Click your USB, it will boot up, then follow the prompts! This will not do anything to the files on your computer.
Enjoy!

,matt56037,2011-01-02T20:16Z,"Ugh. I swear everyone is retarded. Here we go:

This is an unmodified Mac OS X Snow Leopard retail install DVD. By default, PCs cannot run Mac OS X. If you want to install Mac OS X on your non-Macintosh computer, look elsewhere.

This is the retail copy of Snow Leopard. You may use it to install Snow Leopard on any Intel Macintosh computer regardless of any software you already have installed (that means even if you're running Tiger or no operating system at all, you can still install it).

There are several ways to install this operating system:

If you are already running Mac OS X (even builds before Leopard, i.e. Tiger) you can simply mount this Snow Leopard DMG in Finder and do an upgrade install and keep all your data, settings, and applications.

Alternatively, if your computer does not already have an earlier version of Mac OS X (i.e. you don't have an operating system) or if you want to do a clean install (lose your data, settings, and applications and start fresh), you will need to boot from this DMG. Because it is larger than a standard DVD and will not fit, you will need to mount it to a DL DVD (double-layer DVD). If you are running Mac OS X already, mounting this DMG file to a DL DVD is easy to do from Disc Utility. If you are running a Windows PC, you can mount this DMG file to a DL DVD by using one of several programs (thanks spoken428 and MorpheusNS): TransMac, MagicISO, or dmg2iso. Note your Mac or PC must have a DL DVD burner.

Another way to boot from this DMG would be to mount it to a hard drive (likely external) and boot from that. If you are already running Mac OS X, you can do so by following this guide (thanks MickeyDS):
http://mashable.com/2010/12/14/new-facebook-profile-hacks/
If you are on a PC, it's a little more complicated. Google it.

Hope that cleared some stuff up. Making the world less stupid one comment at a time."

But I need to work a dual Win7 + Mac OS X installation out anyway. So this will be good practice for me.

As for the fuckwit who is telling everyone that they cant install this onto a PC he can go fuck himself. Hackintosh.com and Lifehacker and Tonymac86x all require you to use a LEGITIMATE Leopard Install DVD (Which this is) to make your Hackintosh. Only a wanker would use an iATKOS install... The best Hackintosh Distro is NO Distro.. use the legit CD and get all the benefits, then just work yourself out with Kexts.

Go to Hackintosh.com to start and then follow the guide on the top front page by Tonymac. Install OS X first and then Windows 7. You'll have to start from a blank drive though so don't be a pussy. Back your shit up and then try this.

If you can't work it out even after that then you don't deserve to run Mac OS. This isn't a game noobs, be happy with your nooby little PC's. Leave this to the big boys."

1. Extract with 7zip (The second to the last option in settings)

2. Click the winSetup.exe with Admin privledges (If you can't find it did you properly extract? See above)

3. Choose C:/ for Installation Folder 

4. On Step 5 of installation, uncheck ""Apple performance optimization"" This actually collects data of your computer including CPU efficiency for ""statistical optimization"". If you have a non-""Apple"" approved Intel or AMD processor, they blacklist the machine. 

5. Finally watch it turn your XP/Vista/Windows 7 computer into Snow Leopard! It also safely sandboxes and fully emulates your old Windows programs to use in OSX. Your files and folders remain intact.

5. Have fun!

,dva999999,2011-07-31T08:31Z,"After much problems after deleting OS Leopard, I found a way of downloading this without buying double disks. I connected two laptops together and used the empty one as an external hard drive using the Firewire cable to connect the two. (Press T when booting up the empty one and the firewire logo appears. The second laptop sees it as an external drive. I partitioned the drives so that one partition was 20gb (or thereabouts) and the other was free. I then used the ""restore"" function in disk utilities putting the dmg file into the source and the smaller partitioned drive into the destination. Clicked on erase destination and pressed restore. This created a bootable version of the dmg image onto the empty laptop. Once this was done, I closed both down and was able to boot up and install Snow Leopard onto the empty laptop. Of course this means that the bootable copy of the dmg file remains on the laptop, but if you have an external drive or intend on getting an external drive at some point this is ok. Bottom line, thank you Apokarteron, mine and my lady friends laptop have you to thank for having Snow Leopard.  "

Installing on a Windows box is extensive. It can be easy or extremely difficult. To find out if you can install OS X safely on your computer, go to http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page and read the components lists."
,Kaqanikudc,2011-10-11T17:31Z,"If you canÃ¢â¬â¢t install Mac OS X on a hard drive

If the Installer wonÃ¢â¬â¢t let you install Mac OS X on a hard drive and gives as the reason Ã¢â¬ÅMac OS X cannot start up from this volume,Ã¢â¬Â the drive may not have the partition scheme that the Installer requires. The needed partition scheme depends on the type of processor in your Mac. The installer installs Mac OS X for Intel-based Macintosh computers only on drives with the GUID partition scheme. It installs Mac OS X for PowerPC-based Macintosh computers only on drives with the Apple partition scheme.

To check the external driveÃ¢â¬â¢s partition scheme, open Disk Utility, select the drive in the list, choose File > Get Info, and look for the Ã¢â¬ÅPartition Map Scheme.Ã¢â¬Â If you canÃ¢â¬â¢t see the Ã¢â¬ÅPartition Map Scheme,Ã¢â¬Â you may have selected the volume instead of the disk. (Drives are flush left, with their volumes indented to the right below them.)

You can change the partition scheme for the disk drive by repartitioning it. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s OK to create only one partition.
To repartition an external drive so you can install Mac OS X:
Step 1

Back up any important data on the drive. Repartitioning it erases all its data.
Step 2

Open Disk Utility. If youÃ¢â¬â¢re in the Mac OS X Installer, choose Utilities > Disk Utility. Otherwise, double-click Disk Utility, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.
Step 3

Choose the disk in the list, and click the Partition tab. If you canÃ¢â¬â¢t see the Partition tab, you may have selected the volume instead of the disk. (Disks are flush left, with their volumes indented to the right under them.)
Step 4

Click Options and choose the appropriate partition scheme. Choose the GUID partition scheme for Intel-based Macintosh computers. Choose the Apple partition scheme for PowerPC-based Macintosh computers.
Step 5

Click OK.
Step 6

Set your other options, such as the number of partitions and their names. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s OK to create only one partition.
Step 7

Click Partition."

,BMeyers94,2012-02-07T12:58Z,"Okay, someone PLEASE help. I've been trying to get this to work for about 3 days now . . . 

I have a MacBook with . . .

Model Name - MacBook
Model Identifier - MacBook5,2
Processor Name - Intel Core 2 Duo
Processor Speed - 2.13 GHz
Number Of Processors - 1
Total Number Of Cores - 2
L2 Cache - 3 MB
Memory - 2 GB
Bus Speed - 1.07 GHz

Okay, now that that is out of the way, I'm not a noob to these kinda of things in anyway. I mess around with cracked versions of Windows and torrents and everything else all the time, but this is my first time with a Mac. 

Anyways, I got this MacBook after my big brother unfortunately passed away in a car accident . . . He knew how much I loved computers and electronics, so he left it to me. He has two accounts on it though. He has his ""Macintosh"" account, which is the administrative account and then he has an account for my nephew on it. He had the settings set to where it automatically signs in his son's account when turned on, which is not password protected, obviously. But his is. So, I need to do a clean install and wipe the HDD clean so I'm set as the administrator and can start fresh with it. Don't give up on me yet, keep reading . . .

I downloaded this torrent and burned it to a Memorex DVD+R DL 8.5 GB disc on my PC using Nero 11. When I put the disc into the Mac it loads everything fine and it allows me to run the .dmg file and the program pops up. At the top of the window it says ""Mac OS X Install DVD"" so I figured everything was good. But when I click ""Install Mac OS X"" it says ""To install Mac OS X, use Disk Utility to burn this disk image to a DVD and run this application again."" 

So, I did a little more reading and saw svak89's comment on page 18 about using Disk Utility on a Mac to reburn this .dmg file with a few ""tweeks"". I went ahead and tried that.

I set everything to the exact settings that he had in his comment on page 18 and when the disc finished burning I was positive it'd work this time. I went ahead and put the disc in the drive and ran it, but I kept getting the same message saying ""To install Mac OS X, use Disk Utility to burn this disk image to a DVD and run this application again."" Mother damn . . .

Again, I read a little more on the internet and tried putting the disc in and rebooting the computer while holding down the ""c"" key directly after you hear the bootup sound and I kept holding it until the gray Apple symbol appeared like a forum told me. It took a lot longer for the computer to get to the screen with the gray Apple symbol on it, so I was for sure it was going to work that time, but it just went ahead and logged me in as my nephew.

So, again, I went ahead and did some further research to figure out what the fuck I was doing wrong and I saw SiGoTuri's comment on page 18, too. So I asked myself, ""Is this version just not compatible with my MacBook ?"" Any help there ?

So, I guess if it isn't compatible with my MacBook, can I do a clean install with Lion instead ? If so, please point me to a good torrent with instructions. And lastly, If I finally get a working version of Mac OS X, am I going to get screwed over when I go to do the install and wipe the HDD clean because it'll ask me for the Administrator name and password ?

This MacBook means a lot to me and I want to be able to get it working without replacing the HDD or buying a copy of Mac OS X from Apple. It's really the only thing I have to remember my big brother by. He was the only one who knew the password to it, though, and he didn't tell me it because he didn't exactly plan on leaving me this early . . . 

I can't take it into Apple either because he bought it from a friend for $600, and they had a fall out and his friend decided to be a douchebag and report it stolen so if it ever had problems my brother couldn't take it. The cops weren't called or anything, but that douchebag made it to where if it needed to be taken in, Apple would see that the serial number was reported stolen and obviously get my big bro in trouble.

If you read all of this, thank you"

@tinkerbellmatada12 
@Gorgiev 

1) Installing this will NOT erase the files on your system. 

2) In order to understand how to boot up this Snow Leopard 10.6.0 from an external hard drive, follow @THUNDERDRAGONX instructions on page 2 of these comments. 

3) In order to install Mac OS X Lion, you need Snow Leopard 10.6.6 at least. You must run a software update after having installed this version of Snow Leopard. This will bring Snow Leopard to version 10.6.8. After that is complete, you should be able to install Mac OS X Lion (from the system, without using an external hard drive or dvd disc)."

,Faeora,2012-02-21T23:31Z,"I just wanted to say to all the haters and people saying its fake or doesn't work, y'all are all jacked up. I downloaded this in about a couple hours because I have a shit connection, and was able to install perfectly. From my iPod Classic no less.

Here is how:

1.) Plug in your iPod and open iTunes if its not set to on its own.

2.) Select your iPod from the list on the left then click restore to remove anything that may be on it.

3.) Close iTunes and open Disk Utilities it will be in the utilities folder within the applications folder

4.) From the window that opens up click on your iPod in the list to the left.

5.) Click on erase in the top bar of options in the right side of the window.

6.) Name it what u want to and make sure that the box that says install Mac OS 9 components or something to that effect is checked then click the the erase button at the bottom right of the window.

7.) Wait for it to complete then in the same bar that brought u to the erase screen click the word partition.

8.) Enter in the text box 8.00 then click the partition button at the bottom right of the window.

9.) Wait for that to complete then in the same bar that brought up partition and erase finally, click restore.

10.) Drag this .dmg from where ever u put it to the box that says source and from the list on the side drag your iPod's newly created partition to the destination box then click the restore button in the lower right of the window.

11.) Wait for it to finish then close it and open system preferences from the menu that comes down when u click on the Apple logo in the very top left of the monitor.

12.) From there double click on startup disk.

13.) The next window that opens will have a list of all drive/discs that are mounted that have a copy of OS X on them select your newly created iPod/startup disk then click restart.

14.) When the computer finally boots back up just go through the normal install process of clicking next and I agree and such until you are met with a little blue bar that say wait (insert number here) minutes. At this point go out drinking with your buddies or something because it might take a while when u get back your Mac will have restarted after the install and u will have successfully upgraded to OS X Snow Leopard"

I made a partition on my external hard drive of 10 GB, Mac OS Extended (Journalism), and the other partition was the rest of the space. Just loaded the DMG onto there as the source (go into Restore), then dragged the 10 GB partition as the destination. Clicked restore, the Install DVD popped up. Just opened that up and there we go, Snow Leopard installed and upgraded from Leopard on my white Macbook!

Any suggestions??? "
,OfANewAge,2012-07-11T05:58Z,"@Klatu666
If you are on an actual Mac and not a hackintosh, you need to burn the image to a disc.  Just use the Disc Utility to complete this.  Load the disc into the computer and restart.  As soon as the machine powers back up, hold the C key and the machine will boot from the disc.  Click the Utilities bar at the top after the installation screen comes up.  Select Disk Utility.  Erase the hard drive your current operating system is on.  Reformat it as Mac OSX (Journaled) and whatever you wanna call it. Exit disk utility. You then should be able to proceed with installation without any issues.  "
,rende99,2012-07-23T22:37Z,"i know this may sound n00bish, but I read somewhere that if you downgrade from lion to snow leopard, it deletes all your software.

I really hope i can get SL back."
