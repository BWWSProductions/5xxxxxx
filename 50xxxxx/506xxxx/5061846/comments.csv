Dude...it is you. lol

You obviously are not an original Wolfenstein 3D player from the days of x286 and 5 1/4 floppy drives. 

The original character was called BJ Blazkowicz. Activision had nothing to do with that. It was only id and Apogee back then.

Know how you had to buy it? Mail order! It arrived on my doorstep in a thick padded envelope and it was your choice of 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 floppy. There were no stores to go to back in 1992 except select, oddball boutiques in bigger cities.

So, BJ was the idea of id and published by Apogee. It is not new."

I forgot but just remembered that right now."
