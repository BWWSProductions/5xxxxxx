Dengue Fever join Society of Sound (6 July 2009)

Dengue Fever have never been shy about occupying a niche, Mojo described them as "the world's premier Cambodian psychedelic rock band" although the LA Times preferred to see them as - "Sexy and eclectic, it's world music for the cool kids".

"In The Ley Lines" is the new monthly album available exclusively from Society of Sound. It's a superb set of unreleased tracks that were recorded at Real World  - some live and some in the studio - and mixed at Real World and the band's studio in LA.

The tracks, which amount to an album's worth of material at more than 40+ minutes of music include: "The Province" (new song), "Tiger Phone Card" (new arrangement), "Mr. Orange" (new arrangement), "Hold My Hips" (new arrangement), "Doo Wop" (never-before-recorded studio version), "Pow Pow" (live), "Sober Driver" (live), "New Years Eve" (live), "Seeing Hands" (live) and "One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula" (live).

They really do sound like no-one else.
