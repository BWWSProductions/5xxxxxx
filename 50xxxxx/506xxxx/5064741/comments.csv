Bit rate 320kbs (not checked still downloading)
Upload it in a day or two.

,donaldinoduck,2009-08-22T17:48Z,"I am pretty sure, and if I remember correctly,  Wynonna Judd - Her Story - Scenes from a lifetime was uploaded @320 Kbps by an uploader named  "" CanadaJoe "" ...he is a member here and is also active at dem0n01d...
the torrents are still tracked by some indexing sites but not here ..there may be one seeder and that too is not regular..

However when you have onlyone(of a kind )Joe..you don't need to go to Canada :)

[V],only1joe,2009-08-22T18:27Z,"donaldinoduck - Nothing on this account or at demonoid. Maybe the torrent died and he deleted it.
