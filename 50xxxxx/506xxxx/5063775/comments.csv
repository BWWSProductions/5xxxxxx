,syndre,2009-08-22T17:24Z,"The only thing is I am not sure why the uploader did not rar the iso file, it only takes up 2.1 gigs in WBFS manager..."
,MemiBH,2009-08-23T19:15Z,"Hello Syndre,
Ill give two reasons why i don't compress my uploads. First since i dump these my self its time consuming for me to compress every game i upload, plus i have had bad experiences compressing big files(my CPU crashes). Second if the averaged down-loader downloads compressed files that are 2-3 gbs  they'll delete it as soon as they extract it. I feel the way i do it will give every a equal chance to get the file.
By the way i checked out your torrents, and of course i became a quick fan. I hope this cleared up your doubt. ; )"
,syndre,2009-08-26T15:18Z,hey I wasn't putting you down in any way :) I was just sayin you could have cut the download time in half if you wanted

I have nabbed a few off here and never seen this before..."
,Guunslinger,2009-10-07T03:10Z,"This is my first iso download so forgive my stupidity, but I am having trouble getting this to work. I used Nero to burn the iso, but my WII is not reading the disk. Any help would be appreciated."

First in order to play a back up Wii game, your Wii must be modded. 

http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/16970-new-3-1-4-1-softmod-any-wii.html

This link will give you all the info you need to know and then some, personally this is what i used to mod one of my Wii's. It's probably the easiest way to mod a Wii without opening it.

Second I recommend you use imgburn, which is a Freeware, to burn your iso. Make sure you use the slowest speed possible to avoid errors. Also make sure you use a dvd-R blank and your Wii Iso i exactly 4.37GB (4,699,979,776 Bytes).

You could download Imgburn Using this link.

Hope that helped.
GOOD LUCK.
