PhotoTune 2.2incorporates ColorTune technology (formerly known as 20/20 Color MD)with its patented color correction process and SkinTune technology,developed after more than two years of in-depth skin color research.PhotoTune 2.2 makes the tedious and time-consuming task of colorcorrection simple and straightforward to improve your post-processingworkflow.

Patented Six Step Process
PhotoTune is a Photoshop plug-in that features a patented six stepprocess to correct the color in your digital photos. PhotoTune examinesyour image and then presents two color corrected options side-by-side.You then pick the one that looks best to you. This simple andstraight-forward "Color Wizard" walks you through the correctionprocess until you end up with a final, color corrected image.

Take Snapshots to Compare Corrections
During the "Color Wizard" correction process you can record a WizardSnapshot that you can save to preview in the final Fine Tune panel. Soif you see a correction that you like in the wizard process, you cansave it for later comparison.
The Fine Tune panel also allows you to take up to four snapshots toallow you to compare various fine tune adjustments if you wish.
Like everything in PhotoTune, Snapshot is designed to speed up thecorrection process. Snapshot is a safety net that lets you continue toexperiment with different combinations. Take a Snapshot whenever youwant to preserve a set of correction parameters, so you can continueexperimenting with without fear of losing a previous correction youliked.

Professional 16-bit Compatibility
PhotoTune supports 8-bit and 16-bit photos allowing you to open yourRAW camera images in Photoshop and color correct them using either theColorTune or the SkinTune modules within PhotoTune.

Fine Tune Panel
The Fine Tune panel is typically accessed as the final step in thepatented 6 step Color Wizard process - but can also be accessed at anytime you wish. The Fine Tune panel displays your original photo next tothe corrected image and affords you the opportunity to make some finaladjustments such as adjusting the dynamic range, brightness, contrast,saturation as well as shadows and highlights.

Professional Saturation Control
PhotoTune uses an exclusive algorithm that adjusts saturation based oneach individual pixel's saturation level, so it knows how muchsaturation to add, and more importantly, when to stop. PhotoTune hasachieved a digital imaging breakthrough by providing unmatchedsaturation control and precision.

Photoshop's underlying problem is that it doesn't distinguish betweenhighly saturated, moderately saturated, and under-saturated areas. Itmakes a global change that treats these areas exactly the same. So,Photoshop doesn't stop when 100% saturation has been achieved for anygiven color channel.

Easily Correct Skin Color
PhotoTune 2.0 includes SkinTune technology which is the culmination ofmore than two years of skin color research to properly correct skincolor for accurate skin tone color variations. This research includedcollecting thousands of skin tone image samples from around the world.

Precise spectrophotometer measurements were compiled and completereference databases of acceptable colors for each race were completed.During this process, it was discovered that skin color represents lessthan 1% of all available colors. Combine this with the fact that eachrace has slightly different color characteristics, it is no wonder thatacceptable skin color correction is such a difficult process especiallywhen traditional tools were never designed to handle such a small rangeof colors.
