Czech singer Marketa Irglova and Irish musician Glen Hansard won hearts with their critically acclaimed film, 'Once,' and the Oscar-winning hit, 'Falling Slowly.' As the Swell Season, the two have played sold-out shows all over the world. Despite all their successes, Hansard admits that he and Irglova are recognized on the street more but make sure to be true to themselves. "When you're shocked to your core with the success of an award like that, I think you have to really look into yourself and look into your roots and look at how grounded you are," Hansard tells Spinner. "And don't resist [success]. Just go with it."

And now the Swell Season is back with 'Strict Joy' -- a new collection of crooning ballads and heart-melting love songs. "For me, it's just an audio diary," Hansard admits. "It's just another installment of the life we lead."

Hansard reveals 'In These Arms' -- today's featured track -- stemmed from a small idea that just walked into the studio one day and grew into love song about trust and faith in another person. "Sometimes you're just meant to commit to someone's life, and you're meant to go through all these experiences," Hansard says. "But it's all good because it's all part of something that's already been written."

'Strict Joy' releases on October 27.
