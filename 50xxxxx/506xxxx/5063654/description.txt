LYRICS

Do you wanna date my avatar?
Do you wanna date my avatar?

Hang with me in my MMO
So many places we can go
You'll never see my actual face
Our love, our love will be in virtual space

I'm craving to emote with you
So many animations I can do
Be anything you want me to be
C'mon, c'mon and share a potion with me

Do you wanna date my avatar?
She's a star
And she's hotter than reality by far
Wanna date my avatar?

You can type commands
I've got slots for what I hold in my hands
Don't care what's in your character bank
How 'bout, how 'bout a little tank and spank

Grab your mouse and stroke the keys
Here in cyberspace there's no disease
Pick a time, send a tell to me
Just pay, just pay a small subscription fee

Do you wanna date my avatar?
She's a star
And she's hotter than reality by far
Wanna date my avatar

Single, White Human
Looking for group
My stats so high
You'll be out of the loop

Got an uberleet staff
That you can equip
Close your mouth up
Ladies this is pure nerdnip

I'm a fiction based fantasy
A man so stoic
I hack and slash
Who the heck's more heroic?

Check me out, cloth armor
Fits me like a glove
Just twitter a time
I'm ready for love

Hang with me in my MMO
So many places we can go
I'm better than a real world quest
You'll touch my plus five to dexterity vest

What role to you wanna play?
I'm just a click away night or day
And if you think I'm not the one
Log off, log off and we'll be done

Do you wanna date my avatar?
She's a star
And she's hotter than reality by far
Wanna date my avatar

[repeat chorus]

Do you wanna date my avatar (do you wanna date my avatar) (x4)
