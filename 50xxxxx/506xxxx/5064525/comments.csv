At any rate, I don't want to install Adobe Acrobat Reader 9 on my system. Is there any way to open this for those of us who prefer to use third party viewers?"
,arjun5577,2009-08-23T17:14Z,"Otherwise install Virtual PC 2007 XP /Wmware XP when you use arcobat on xp it'll not slowdown your pc.

Can I know why you are not interested to install adobe on your system. I came to know even mac, linux, solaris, aix, hp-ux and mobile users using adobe acrobat

please get adobe from here...

,RMatila,2009-08-24T03:26Z,Thanks for the Upload!! looking forward to it.
,tytactic,2009-09-23T00:08Z,"This is almost useful.

It truly would be nice if a third party .pdf viewer could open these files. Adobe's .pdf viewer is bloated and slow. There are a lot of people who don't like Adobe (and/or their .pdf viewer, myself included).

It would be even better if you just gave us the data in an easily editable format (i.e., .doc). That way everyone can open it _and_ edit it (if they want to).

Lastly, please don't put everything into one .zip file. Most people don't want all the tests for all the levels. How about making five .zip archives: one for each level and one for the Shoho. This saves bandwidth for some (read: most) of us.

If you are so inclined, please re-release this torrent while heeding some of the above suggestions. The torrent will prove to be more useful and will live longer / get more hits. Thanks."
,tytactic,2009-09-23T00:11Z,And it would be even awesomer to have all the different tests in different files. There should be 17 files (one for each year) per level (instead of one file for each level).
,skitmaster,2010-03-16T10:50Z,could u just provide the password. ubuntus document viewer cant keeps askin for it. no actual fast internet connection therefore installation of adobe isnt possible.
,kasutori24,2010-06-01T16:11Z,"@tytactic, shut your damn mouth, you ungrateful twat."
,galaxy21,2010-11-27T17:26Z,Very useful. Thanks for the upload. No problem in opening the files using Adobe Reader version  above 9. 
,litachan,2012-01-29T10:47Z,"Just what I was looking for! Many many thanks for this amazing file. 
I don't mind that the tests come in a single file because I am planning on printing them to make them more handy!
Again ありがとうございます！二級合格へ！"
