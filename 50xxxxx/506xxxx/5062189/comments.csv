,bkoska2005,2009-11-02T06:47Z,"if this is the one i had it created a check disk thing later and deleted every movie i extracted with it plus itself. 

i was able to recover about 2/3 of the movies by serching the hidden files. it started with windows media plAYer 10 crashing the computer, then checkdisk ran automaticly on reboot..could not disable. torrent names went by as it repaired sectors....and most of my bitlord folder was empty after....before that it worked great.....WTF was that?"
