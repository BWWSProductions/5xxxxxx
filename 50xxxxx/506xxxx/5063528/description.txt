Rip-Off is a nice little coming of age movie about 4 soon-to-graduate high school students in suburban Toronto in 1971. It has the images of the early 70's, tied-dye shirts, the "ecology trip", and the trip to the country in a beat up van. The guys want to start up a commune on some land one of them (Don Scardino) has inherited. The subsequent trip and disillusionment is the overriding theme of the movie. It is something someone growing up in that time can relate to. The world has changed a lot since then but it is a nostalgic trip back in time. This is not a big blockbuster movie, but it is a worthwhile "little" movie. The director Don Shebib is best known for the classic Canadian movie "Goin' Down the Road".
