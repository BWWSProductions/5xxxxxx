Purely functional data structures 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most books on data structures assume an imperative language such as C or 
C++. However, data structures for these languages do not always translate
well to functional languages such as Standard ML, Haskell, or Scheme. This
book describes data structures from the point of view of functional
languages, with examples, and presents design techniques that allow
programmers to develop their own functional data structures. The author
includes both classical data structures, such as red-black trees and
binomial queues, and a host of new data structures developed exclusively for
functional languages. All source code is given in Standard ML and Haskell,
and most of the programs are easily adaptable to other functional languages.
This handy reference for professional programmers working with functional
languages can also be used as a tutorial or for self-study.
