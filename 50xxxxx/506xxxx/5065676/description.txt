P.S.
If the torrent download is being a dick feel free to download it from my website URL: http://hackedfiles.sc20.info/Ninja_Showdown.zip

Just copy and past it in to your address bar. Oh' and don't worry the file is 100% clean I don't fuck people over like most always do and I have been there myself. So don't worry about it. My name by the way is not dick just so you know lol

However, I did hack the file using neo hex editor so you don't have to pay for the game but the sites URL dose come up when you close the game window. I was unable to re-move that from happening.

Thanks and enjoy!.
