,gaijin01,2009-08-20T03:07Z,"I have been enjoying your posts for some time, thx alot, keep the faith.

How about posting the 24/7 paradoies? I REALLY want to hear em, thats also why I am glad you recorded this live, the 24/7 podcasts cut out the paradoies"
,7dm,2009-08-20T03:16Z,"Thanks, I kinda missed the bumper music and parody toons that the podcast cut out."
[T],jwhitt62,2009-08-20T05:15Z,"Great question on the parodies...the only way to listen to them is through the 24/7 site. In other words, I can't download them to mp3 or any other format to upload. I wish I could...they're awesome.

...also, I agree with 7dm...and the uploads are available earlier to the Belgians."

I am not sure what programs are available for Windows, but Audio Hijack for the Mac is an outstanding product that will capture audio from any application.  I use it to record audio from Radiotimes webplayer and it works like a charm.   It is also a great way to strip DRM from audiobooks.  

Hope the info is useful."
,xMule,2009-08-20T11:24Z,"I have started up a little site to offer another way to get some of these great shows. I will be uploading the shows to r@pidsh@re and meg@uplo@d for those who either can't or don't like to use bittorrent.

I am going to start with Neal Boortz and Jerry Doyle's shows and hopefully it will hopefully make them available to more people. Credit goes to nucleartriggerpuller for the recordings.
