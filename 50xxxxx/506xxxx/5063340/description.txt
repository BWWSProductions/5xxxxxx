This is the torrent for the first album from the rap band, Really Ard Posse. Really 'Ard Posse, or R.A.P, is an experimental/ hip hop band. They were founded in March of 2006 by DJ CJ and DJ A-Bomb. They then recorded their first song, "'nst". Although the song was unsuccessful, they released their second song shortly after, entilted "Boom Boom". Then in late March of 2006, they were joined by their third band member, DJ Gwamez. With their new edition, they were able to write two new songs, featuring DJ Gwamez as the lead singer, "YO! My Homies!" and "Mediocre Rap". They then began work on "Angy Mum, on School Run". After releasing this song, they found that a tribute band, WestBromwich Crew, had begun covering and writing songs to a similar style. However, the band soon broke up due to poor sales, and it is no longer together. However, R.A.P was then joined by [[DJ Flux]], who worked with the other members to produce "Falling". After the release of "Falling", the band began to create a documentry, that would be released at the same time as "Metal Stone", and were released in late January of 2007. "Slave to Society" was released in the middle of Febuary, and is a followed up by an alternate version of the song that was released shortly after. Soon the band released several songs to allow the completion of their CD; Falling Remix, was a resung version of the previous song, and Random Mix was a new song involving DJ CJ and DJ A-Bomb. All 12 of the songs they had created were released in one album entilted Really Ard Posse, and was released in early March of 2007.
