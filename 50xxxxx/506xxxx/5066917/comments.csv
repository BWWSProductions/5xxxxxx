The image should be complete at 95.7% so it should be safe to use then. I'm going to see if I can find a way around this. I'll post a link to the new torrent if I ever find it.

Also, If you are using this printer remotely, these drivers work great with Snow Leopard 32 and 64 bit kernel, but if you are using the 64 bit kernel the printer will not work locally. Just boot into 32 bit kernel to print."
