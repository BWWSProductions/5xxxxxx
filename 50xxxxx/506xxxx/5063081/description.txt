Strength and Stiffness of Engineering Systems
Publisher: Springer | Pages: 696 | 2009-01-08 | ISBN 0387494731 | PDF

This book is a modern version of classical Strength of Materials adapted to meet the needs of developing technology with its emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches. Subjects such as plasticity, fracture, composite materials, energy approaches and mechanics of microdevices (MEMs) are integrated into a unified text. In this way, the slow build up of traditional programs is replaced by an integrated and unified approach which reflects the reality of modern technology with its demands to learn the fundamentals of new subjects quickly.

The text is suitable for an introductory Strength of Materials course and as a continuing text for both advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. It can also be used as a resource for professional engineers occupied with development of new products.
