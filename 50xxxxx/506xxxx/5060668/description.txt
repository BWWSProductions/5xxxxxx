Review by Allmusic: "When Soda Stereo's future was unknown, Gustavo Cerati released this intimate and introspective collection of songs that reflect changes in his personal life. He got married to Chilean model Cecilia AmenÃ¡bar and was expecting a child while this album was being made; on "Te Llevo Para Que Me Lleves," they even sang together. That song is enough to summarize the album's feeling: delicate, luminous, and positive. Cerati played all the instruments with few exceptions. The sound of the album was almost entirely based on guitars, although some electronic approaches could be found in songs like "Pulsar." It wasn't as experimental as Soda Stereo's Dynamo or Colores Santos, the album he made with Daniel Melero released at the beginning of 1992. "Avenida Alcorta" is as close as Cerati gets to Soda Stereo's sound. It contains a respectful version of "Bajan," a Pescado Rabioso song originally included on the influential 1972 album Artaud."

(*1) A very crude version of the song, although I processed the audio, some glitches remain, but the solo was so terrific that it was worth including it.
