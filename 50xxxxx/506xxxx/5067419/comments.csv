,asimbiju,2009-11-09T15:22Z,"Here is the easiest way to install the game..

1. open the ""add-cg10.001"" file with WinRAR
2. Click on ""EXTRACT TO"" button.
3. when finished Extracting files- delete the original ""add-cd"" files. (now you have only one ISO file.

4. Again open that ISO file with WinRAR
5. EXTRACT  to any designation folder. (and then delete the original ISO file)
6. Disconnect internet.
7. Install the game (double click ""HoyleCardGames2010.exe""
8. after installation Copy the ""hoylecards"" into the program folder where you have just installed the game (replace original)

PLAY THE GAME! "
