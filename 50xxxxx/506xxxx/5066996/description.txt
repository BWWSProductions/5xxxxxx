The Dandy Warhols are a US rock band formed in Portland, Oregon, by Courtney Taylor-Taylor (vocals, guitar), Zia McCabe (keyboard), Peter HolmstrÃ¶m (guitar), and Eric Hedford (drums), who left in 1998 to be replaced by Taylor-Taylor's coping Brent De Boer. The band's name is a pun on the name of American pop artist Andy Warhol.

The Dandy Warhols are strongly influenced by The Velvet Underground, Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles, The Shadows, and The Rolling Stones as well as including implicit musical references to My Bloody Valentine in some songs. Front man Courtney Taylor-Taylor describes the band's beginning as a group of friends who "needed music to drink to."
