philcam@live.ie..

thanks"
,Ex0duS_5150,2009-08-21T02:44Z,"if someone just gives out a demonoid account to someone they dont know, that person would be retarded.. whoever gives you the account is responsible for your activity's ie: you could get ""them"" banned.. so... good luck on that one.. your best bet is to hang around on IRC channels waiting around for someone to give you one.."
,austinsdadda,2009-08-21T03:13Z,"or just keep trying back at demonoid periodically, they do open reg every once in a while"
,timleary,2009-08-21T07:06Z,Seriously fuck your torrents. They are screwing up the search. I searched for this specific movie and I have to sift through all your other bullshit. Fuck you. 
,DDDank,2009-08-21T18:39Z,"But hes actually right, no disrespect but why do u have to post all these links is not like we dont know about them"
,Shynobi,2009-08-21T19:07Z,"Maybe it is because he puts out a ton of good quality badass fucking torrents, it's nice of him make them all so easily available. You know you can trust his ups to be both legit and good quality. 
Thanks extremezone."
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2009-08-21T20:24Z,"Thank you Extremezone!!! Always great quality !
"
,twmyers,2009-08-21T20:48Z,"""Maybe it is because he puts out a ton of good quality badass fucking torrents""  
Ive actuallycome to see that extremezones regurgitating of torrents is worth something, but lets not pretend he actually does anything beyond copypasta."
,TimoZi,2009-08-21T21:20Z,"Thanks extreme, you uploads are always fast and excellent quality.

But, I do agree with timleary... Your torrents in do often really make searching for particular movies A LOT harder.

Listing a bunch of unrelated torrents in description is not helpful for anybody. Why not just link to /extremezone if you want to plug your other uploads?"

,derrenfox,2009-08-22T10:45Z,this film is shit!!!!!!!! dont waste ya time downloading
,Kooblukhan,2009-08-22T14:01Z,"@wolfcry, timo, tim, and whoever else.  Its called Search Titles Only.  L2interweb....  Besides, anyone who cares enuf about plugging themselves that they copy paste their own copy-paste-movielist is obviously obsessed about making the top100 anyway, exxxtreme wont care what u say.

BTW even though its probably the same as every other 700mb VIP upped film, anyone care to comment on the A/V?  or anything at all useful having to to with what was upped?"
,almostaquad,2009-08-23T00:27Z,"I am with Shynobi and extremezone. leary I don't see a Pink Skull by your name let alone a Green Skull. It's extremezone's page. I believe extremezone used the word SPAMMERS!!!
