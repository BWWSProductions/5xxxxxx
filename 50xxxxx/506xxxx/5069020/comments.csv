I'm having a problem when I go to patch it. It's just saying there's an error patching file. I know the first thing you're thinking, and no I am not patching the wrong section. It's program files, sony, vegas pro 9.0

Can someone please help me!! Oh, and I am running it as Administrator. 

Thanks guys!"
