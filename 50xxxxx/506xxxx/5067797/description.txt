"WELCOME TO THE BAYOU," PART 3-The Geautreauxs are throwing themselves a BBQ and Frank Castle is the guest of honor. On the menu: some succulent college kids who stopped at the wrong convenience store for gas and beer. When the Punisher decided to make their problem his business, he stepped into redneck hell. Now his only hope boils down to the precious cargo in his trunk that just got free and wants a little payback.
