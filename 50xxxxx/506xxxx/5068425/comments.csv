,justoned420,2009-08-25T19:45Z,"Several hundred seeds despite what it says...
Some kind of tracker problem."
,Oinkness,2009-08-25T20:13Z,"After reading the comments, I thought this torrent would work, but nope. No seeds or leechers. "
,deadvirgo,2009-08-25T20:46Z,"I, on the other hand, have several thousand leechers and quite a few seeds. Good d/l."

,elax666,2009-08-26T08:32Z,"eztv rules my world, (at least the one on what I watch on Tv.) Thanks man, your the best!"
,doctorrob,2009-08-27T00:25Z,"Yeah, somethings up with this torrent. It'll say no seeds or leachers, but if you connect, give it a few seconds and it's fine.

Not complaining, just clarifying."
,cowpuncher,2009-08-27T03:12Z,"my utorrent says  tpb tracker is timed out on every torrent i have active...  might have to do with it saying no seeds?  it is downloading tho, through dht and peer exchange."
,IK720,2009-08-27T05:41Z,This torrent worked for me as well despite saying 0 seeders/leechers.  Thanks !
,sappermatt,2009-08-27T16:32Z,Why does this show no seeders or leechers? I even tried to DL it anyways based on other comments but not dice.

,rob29evansville,2009-08-30T04:13Z,"It shows no seeder or leechers, but when i try to download it, they are there. Something is screwy, but you CAN download this."
,Zeppoleon,2009-08-30T22:23Z,"Thanks a lot! Yes, even though T.P.B. says there are no seeders/leechers it appears to have some. Mine downloaded in no time. "
,norcalnative,2009-09-04T07:07Z,"I don't know why it says there are no seeders or leechers, but it has worked for me."
