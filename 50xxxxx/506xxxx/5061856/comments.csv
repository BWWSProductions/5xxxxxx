,Stevenmt57,2009-08-20T21:41Z,So nice to see that someone is picking up where Ed left off with this show. Many many DS fans out there that will love the fact that someone is back with more episodes. Thank you for the uploads and can't wait for more 
,Lechesia,2009-08-22T03:26Z,"Thank you for the nice comment Stevenmt57.  Someone needed to put more on TPB, and I have a few that are not already here.  But I still need some of them.  Hopefully someone will pick up from where I leave off..."
,MissLizaMay,2009-08-22T09:39Z,"Thanks so much for putting these up!  I'm one of the many fans who got stuck when Ed went off to never-never land.  May I ask how you're ripping from the dvd?  I have collection12, but whenever I pull the episodes it just doesn't work right.  any suggestions?"
,Lechesia,2009-08-22T16:34Z,"You are very much welcomed, MissLizaMay!  I am also stuck with DS Vol. 25 and the second half of 26, can anyone seed these?  To answer your question, insert your movie disc in the DVD drive, a window will open, with options like play movie, recode, open folder.  You want to open folder, another window will open.  This one shows files on disc, select all folders, right click, select Send TO, then click MY Documents.  The files should then be retrievable for uploading.  Anyone with another way to do this, please tell.  I would rather have avi files, but I will not be a rat and be choosey.   Hope this helps.  I really would like to have Vol. 12.  I've been trying to add more DK for the past 2 days, the capcha is down."

I am pretty sure that whoever has the movie rights to this lame, boring, repetitive, derivative soap opera is attempting to use TPB as a free viral advertising source (did they check with their lawyers?)  for their upcoming project, but in case I am wrong, and you are just noobs- my favourite ripping app is dvd::rip, the pirate bay forums which are linked from all pages at this site (http://suprbay.org) can help you through the process of ripping the rest of the files. 
And if you are advertising for a company affiliated with the MPAA, make sure to deduct the money from that suck-ass lawsuit meant to hobble a superior distribution service. Ask Johnny Depp and Tim Burton how much time they spend in dvd rental stores. Oh yeah, spammers and ad scum eat rat crotch."
,Lechesia,2009-08-24T03:48Z,Otto-Are you always this suspicious?  Makes me suspicious of you.
