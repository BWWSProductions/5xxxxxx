ZModeler is an application that allows developers to create 3D models and export them
formats supported by certain games.
ZModeler program should try all those who wanted zasze
create your own original models for computer games. Application
allows you to export files for games such as emergency 3, FlatOut,
GTA: San Andreas or Test Drive Unlimited. A multitude of tutorials to
Zmodeler available on the Internet, should help each fanowi games
