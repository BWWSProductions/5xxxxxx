Several members of a family of trapeze artists are brought into the hospital in critical condition after a devastating accident during a circus performance. Geiger tells Winslow about his wife's schizophrenia and the death of their son. One of Shutt's former patients reveals his bigotry when he refuses to allow a black doctor to remove his gall bladder and insists that he, or another Jewish surgeon, perform the procedure. Jeffrey exhibits signs of a meltdown when he vandalizes the car of a man for taking his parking space. Aaron and Camille grieve about their impending divorce. Jeffrey's outrageous conduct in a restaurant gets him arrested mistakenly for soliciting a prostitute. Phillip incorrectly attributes Aaron's angry outburst at one patient, minutes after losing another young patient, to tensions with Camille; and threatens to fire Camille if there's a recurrence.
