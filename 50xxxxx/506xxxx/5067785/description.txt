For a person who normally sees a lot of films in the theater, I actually missed this one.  And because I'm such a quality-hound, I actually waited until the 720p was released before watching it.  And of course, I kicked myself for not seeing it earlier.  This really is a great and funny film with some really great actors:  Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, Paul Giamatti, and Tom Wilkinson.


I don't know a whole lot of trivia behind this film, but I do know that writer/director Tony Gilroy based this script on a story a friend of his told him in a bar after several drinks.  The friend, was in fact, a corporate spy for a major American manufacturer.  I also know a few mistakes made in the making of the film, one of which is VERY obvious and kinda funny when you notice it ... at the end of the film when Julia Roberts is drinking champagne, the amount in her glass increases with each successive shot, instead of decreasing ...
