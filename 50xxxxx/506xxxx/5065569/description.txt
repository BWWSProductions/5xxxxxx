Review
"This book is extremely well written being both rigorous and lucid...This structure makes it accessible to a wide range of readers... By emphasising the applied perspective of international trade theory and empirical content, Charles van Marrewijk brings to life a theorectical apparatus that is frequently seen as rather dry and cumbersome."

Product Description
"International Trade and the World Economy" provides an up-to-date theoretical and empirical analysis of the structure and forces underlying all 'real' international economics, such as trade flows, investment flows, and trade policy. The book is organized into four parts: introduction and classical trade; neo-classical trade; new trade; and new interactions (in geographical economics, multinationals, growth and development, and applied trade policy). Ample empirical material is used to illustrate the relevance of the new theories discussed and case studies encourage the direct application of newly learned material in each chapter. In addition, an accompanying study guide and website provide empirical questions to test theories and simulation questions to allow the student to get the feel for the structure of economic models and for the interpretation of results.
