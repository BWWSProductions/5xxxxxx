I've got tonight's glen beck tv show to upload, or for that matter if I am infact banned I need someone else to upload it to Demonoid. Especially since it will tweak the little whiners that complained and go this ban in place."
,xMule,2009-08-20T10:22Z,"Hey netviper.  Demonoid is pretty draconian about what is allowed in it's comments so if someone complained about any sort of debate it could be the result of the ban.  I doubt the mods have much love for Glenn but considering that Rush is posted and the site allows violent unrated movies, I doubt that was their (main) reason.

I have had several of my own comments struck down by the mods on mininova, usually after I criticize their censorship.  You know how it goes, libs say they believe in freedom of speech but their statement is always followed by a great big BUT . . .   The Talkmaster did a great rant on today's show on the double standard of how libs believe in freedom of speech as long as it tows the line and how they have gone after Whole Foods for not towing the line.

The Bay may be a bit unreliable at times but they are fiercely dedicated to freedom of expression and that is why I always come back."
,xMule,2009-08-20T11:09Z,"NTP, my friend, I have started up a little site to offer another way to get some of these great shows.  I will be uploading the shows to r@pidsh@re and meg@uplo@d for those who either can't or don't like to use bittorrent.  Since the links stay active long after the seeders have moved on it is also a great way to keep older shows available, too.

I am going to start with Neal and Jerry's shows and hopefully it will help spread the messages of these fine hosts and make them available to more people.  I am using your recordings and if you have an issue with me using your posts in this way, please let me know and I will desist.
