The complete first volume of the bi-monthly CSDA Signet paper, a production of the Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church. Contains all 12 issues in pdf format, covering the period of December 2006 to late 2008.

The CSDA Signet is currently, along with the content of several websites, under legal attack by the General Conference Corporation of Seventh-day Adventists for intellectual property law violation for using the terms "Seventh day," "Adventist," "SDA," or "Seventh Day Adventist" either alone or in conjunction with other modifying terms. Similarly the group maintaining both the websites and the paper have been recently forbidden by U.S. court to hold religious observances in association with said names.

More information can be found at www.LamhamAct.us along with a petition to disallow government regulation and enforcement of religious observances through intellectual property laws.
