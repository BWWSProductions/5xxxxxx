This is the first I have heard about the problem between the GC of SDA and the CSDA's, and I am sad to hear about it.  The GC does a lot of things that I most certainly do not approve of, but this isn't one of them.

This sounds more like people having a beef with the General Conference and they won't let it go.  Do you think that the name is that important? Brothers, don't get twisted and confused, spread the gospel!  (btw, I'm speaking to both the GC and CSDA's)"

If you'd like more information, or to ask questions on the topic, I suggest you visit www.thefourthangel.net. Thepiratebay isn't really the appropriate forum for it. :)
