This is one of those movies that needs to be watched if the human race plans to evolve past a diety worshiping caveman populous that just happens to have guns."

The only downside to it is its brevity; it is just a cursory glance into the inhumanity of the Muslim world. One could make it a full-length picture, hell, even a doctumentary TV series about the threath of Islamification. All the same, thanks to Geert Wilders for making it, and thanks to poophead5 for uploading it."
