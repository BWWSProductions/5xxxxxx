ABBA was a pop music group formed in Sweden in November, 1970. The band consisted of Anni-Frid Lyngstad (Frida), BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Agnetha FÃ¤ltskog. They topped the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982. The name "ABBA" is an acronym formed from the first letters of each of the group members' given names (Agnetha, BjÃ¶rn, Benny, Anni-Frid), and the group took this name officially in late 1973.[1] The group's name is officially trademarked with the first "B" reversed.
