| NOTES: mbtree > b-pyramid |
| |
| The recent changes with x264 have made the |
| current x264 standards as obsolete as ever. |
| With "mbtree" (a new x264 feature) b-pyramid |
| is automatically disabled. This may only be |
| temporary until b-pyramid is supported again |
| in the combination with mbtree. It would be |
| ignorant to turn off mbtree just to conform |
| to the standard's suggested settings, because |
| mbtree outweights the benefits of b-pyramid by |
| far. As with the 720p, this release is over- |
| saturated and would still look decent even at |
| much lower bitrates (blame the sizing rules!). |
