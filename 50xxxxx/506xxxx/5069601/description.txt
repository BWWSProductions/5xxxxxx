Starring: Benny Hill, Henry McGee, Bob Todd, Jackie Wright
Director: Dennis Kirkland 
Rating: Unrated

Video compilation, first issued 1990 as Benny Hill's Greatest Hits, reissued 1998 as Clown King of Comedy. This compilation consists entirely of sketches from his troubled final decade, and whilst it's not the best way of sampling the work of an unfairly maligned (and, let's not forget, hugely innovative) old-school comedian, it's still a decent enough way to spend ninety minutes.
