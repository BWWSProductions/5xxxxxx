,brazcafe,2009-08-19T16:43Z,"Hey, I am interested to know too what happened to them. Been waiting for the August publication as KCN does not have 100% same serials as serial box has. Also I like the iSerial reader much more as it is easy to show only those serials that are new in month. Thanks for all those who have been supply here Serial Box and KCN releases. "
,chillin69x,2009-08-19T16:50Z,"If you read on the front page of iSerial once you install the 7-2009 Serial Box, it tells you that they will be not be making an August collection, but will return in September with one."

No isue in august.
Next isue: 09.2009
