The historical documentary series continues with this fascinating investigation into the origins of the world-famous crystal skulls. Since the 19th century, a number of lifelike quartz skulls have been discovered and displayed in museums. These relics, allegedly dating from Aztec and Mayan civilisations, are believed to have psychic powers. Now, for the first time ever, scientists are given access to the most famous skull of all, the so-called â€˜Skull of Doomâ€™.

The skulls have been attributed with mysterious powers and it has even been claimed they are artefacts from Atlantis or an extra-terrestrial civilisation. The most famous of these relics is a pure quartz skull known as the â€˜Skull of Doomâ€™. It was first brought to light over 50 years ago by a buccaneering English explorer named Frederick Mitchell-Hedges. A real-life Indiana Jones, Mitchell-Hedges claimed the skull was a sacred Mayan relic of death, made over 3,600 years ago for use by the high priests.
