Underbelly is a 13-part Australian television mini-series, retelling the real events of the 1995â€“2004 gangland war in Melbourne. The series is based on the book Leadbelly: Inside Australia's Underworld, by The Age journalists John Silvester and Andrew Rule.

This is the "descriptive audio" track from the Underbelly: Uncut DVD release. Caroline Craig, who plays detective Jacqui James, reads the stage and script directions between the original audio from the TV series.  This is as close as you'll get to an audiobook for this ground-breaking (and thoroughly awesome) Australian TV series.

DVD audio ripped with TMPGEnc, converted to MP3 with dBPoweramp at 100kbs LAME joint-stereo. Enjoy!
