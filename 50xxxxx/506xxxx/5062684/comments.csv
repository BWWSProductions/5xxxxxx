,Trendecide,2009-08-22T00:09Z,Bit rate is 320kbps
,ncbbydoll,2009-08-22T15:40Z,Comes out Aug. 31st - and HELL YEAH I am buying tha album!! Chevelle is awesome!!!  Thanks for seeding
,reality66,2009-08-22T21:52Z,Ironically DarthWatcha is telling us to buy cds on The Pirate Bay (of all places) after downloading an album. 
,capt.black_booty,2009-08-24T06:14Z,"awesome.....
Great quality.
one of the greatest bands ever"
,capt.black_booty,2009-08-24T06:18Z,"ps...
being a musician myself, having made albums and distributing them both for free and for sale on tours, if people love the art we create they will pay anything to keep it going and yes they will download for free also. just look to Trent for the same views, and he is GOD as far as i am concerned."
,DirtyBoots71,2009-08-27T03:27Z,"So what DarthWatcha is saying is that its OK to download torrents if you dont have money, but if you're ""rich"" you should buy the album. You  hypocrite douche. You know how stupid that sounds to anyone with half a fuckin brain!"
,Slice2279,2009-08-29T08:08Z,"Dude, he's saying if you like the music and you have the money to blow then you should support the artists!  A lot of people who download stuff on TPB would buy the music/games/movies but are broke college students.  :p

I usually try to buy albums I like, and I torrent some.  I do a little of both. :)

Thank's for the up btw, didn't know Chevelle had a new album coming out until I heard a song on the radio... I have their last album, so I might buy this one too."
,schmitty84,2009-08-31T22:41Z,"I agree, people have to make a living. I've downloaded metallica and staind then bought their cd's. I did have trouble buying St. Anger though. lol. But I bought it anyway, because I want to hear more of them. If they can't make money they cant make more tunes."
,mikieelmo,2009-09-01T00:40Z,thanks ..u da man !
,Codi69,2009-09-02T08:22Z,"Thanks a lot for sharing this! I'll most likely be buying this tonight, but I needed my Chevelle fix in the meantime lol :p"
,otissor,2009-09-04T23:04Z,thanks for the virus asshole
,dtwnwldcat,2009-09-06T01:36Z,Awesome album! Love Chevelle! Probably gonna buy this just to give them the cred. Thanks Ascenidicate!
,Ascendicate,2009-09-07T18:58Z,Wow Otissor wonder what dumb virus scanner you are on. this is 100% clean if you have problems with your pc they are yours don't blame others.
,dhaa01,2009-09-17T22:44Z,thanks
,pctech23,2009-09-21T14:38Z,Just because you download something from a website doesn't mean you don't need to buy it reality66. I support bands and buys music all the time doesn't mean I won't preview a cd first.
,reality66,2009-09-25T09:53Z,I'm just saying. And downloading this cd doesn't make someone NOT a true Chevelle fan but maybe a broke fan. DirtyBoots71 kinda proved my point but I do fully agree with supporting your top 3 favorite. Good album by the way. Not their greatest but good
,Shynobi,2009-10-02T18:55Z,"Well to help settle this dispute over buying or not, 99% of bands don't make shit off of their album sales, they make the bulk of their money touring and selling merch etc... SO downloading doesn't hurt the band really, it hurts the labels. That is part of pirating stuff(at least I thought so), Fuck the man!"
,finalresistance,2009-10-03T08:14Z,@ darthwatcha   buy it if you want them to be successful? if they really are musicians and care about the music more than money it wouldnt matter.. plus i doubt they are hurting for cash. choke on a dick hypocrit
,mabus6277,2009-10-13T06:56Z,"idiots who are saying Darthwatcha is an idiot, got get a fuckin' life. what hes saying is if you have the money, go out and buy the album after or before you torrent it. The reason being is to keep the band's albums coming, I myself would LOVE to buy these albums but i just aint the the money nor the time. Not to mention if your entire collection gets wiped, liek has happened to me, you can still get some of that music back without having to search for hour online"
,0v3rcL0cK,2009-11-16T19:59Z,"What a bunch of douche-bags......you really should use torrents get get the best look at something you might actually want to buy........I bought Crysis Warhead, after playing it for months from a pirated version......Cause Wars came with it....
I plan on buying all the albums I can get from Chevelle....cause they are Kick-Ass.........
Dont let torrents be the end all be all, just cause its free.....
You really will appreciate your stuff MORE, if you have to use your own money and time......dont be a douche!"
,reality66,2009-11-24T20:47Z,I've seen this band three times in the last month. Really worth seeing live
,drchatman,2010-01-07T22:31Z,"Great torrent, excellent quality.  Thank you."
[T],Emery2010,2010-01-21T22:54Z,"nice upload havent checked it out yet my self
is this anything like vena sera or their other albums?"
,Sajjid,2010-05-25T23:52Z,thnx to da uploader!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Pit-Zah,2010-10-13T23:08Z,Can anyone upload a flac version of this album?
,priyam88,2011-01-02T21:13Z,"Think it in this way , in my country you won't get an original cd .Even if you get one (I doubt it),that would cost very high .The CDs that are available in the local music stores ,are pirated - which were simply downloaded from online.So why I would pay for it when I can myself download it from my own PC.For us,dloading torrents are da only way to get wat we want."
