The bulk of the film was shot on a Canon DV camcorder. The picture is what it is and this disc represents it as well as you will ever see it. This 1080p Blu-ray is presented in its original 1.85:1 anamorphic aspect ratio. Yes, there is a lot of edge enhancement and grain, the picture appears extremely soft and blurred, and there is very little detail. Again, this is simply a result of the shortcomings of the original video and not of the disc. The film is presented as it was intended and shot. ?It?s beautiful for urban work. It has a grittiness about it that?s magnificent,? director Danny Boyle says in the featurette on the disc regarding his decision to shoot on DV over film. The film?s final moments were shot in 35mm and looks as wonderful as one would expect form a Blu-ray disc. Colors are vibrant and pop off the screen. The image is detailed and clear, rivaling that of most of the better Blu-ray discs in production. View this movie based on the merit of the strong, engaging story and not for the look of the film, which does add to the sense of dread and hopelessness of the story. this is as quoted on the blu ray review on this disc "

,Danux01,2010-01-02T07:47Z,"  Although I have not downloaded this rip, I just did a personal rip on my own disc, and I can say without a doubt that this blu ray is the single worst transfer I have ever encountered.
  As suavecito195782 points out, the problem is that the original movie was filmed with Canon XL1S cameras, they are DV using standard def resolution, so all the studios have done is upscaled the 480p image - there is no hires master.
  When I compare my TV-upscaled DVD rip against this POS blu ray transfer, the DVD wins hands down. The source is so bad, I wouldn't even know how to begin to clean it. I'd probably just upscale a DVD and try to pass that off as highdef."
,JohnFolds,2010-02-26T15:37Z,"Great quality, keep that way, Im sending invites for lockerz,just send me mail and Ill send you an invite(karlobarisic@yahoo.com) "
,osriccc,2010-11-22T16:29Z,"Danux01 stop fuckin' posting that in every single fuckin' torrent. We all know this movie was shot in SD and there's not a really HD version of it unless they are the last 3 minutes or so... Got a better rip? Please tell and upload.

JohnFolds fuckin' bot hope you die."
,osriccc,2010-11-22T16:30Z,"Dude, I only have a question, does it have the aftercredits alternative ending? Thanks."
,osriccc,2010-11-26T08:59Z,"Ok, got it at last. It's PERFECT. No framedrops, 6ch sound... IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TORRENT OF THIS MOVIE, this is the one. 3.99Gb is excellent for 1080p. The image is still a little strange cause of the camera used for shooting but looks better than DVD. The magnificent 3 last minutes looks OUTSTANDING. No aftercredits alternative ending as the Bluray doesn't have it pasted after the credits but on ""extras"". This is the perfect copy. Do not download the others, I've tried all of them before this one and now I regret not having downloaded this first. Framedrops, credits cut off and other stuff in the others so you're warned. Seed this until my balls hit the ground."
,osriccc,2010-11-26T09:29Z,"Sorry for TRIPLEPOSTING but I wanna help anyone here wanting to watch this movie (or any other M2TS) in their PCs with subtitles. M2TS doesn't allow subtitles (.srt, etc.) so do this:
- Get TSMUXER and MKVMERGE
- Open the M2TS movie with TSMUXER and demux
- Open the two tracks demuxed with MKVMERGE and set the framerate in ""specific options"" (in this case is 24 fps)
- Mux and wait
- Enjoy your MKV movie

I got 3.78 in MKV without any quality loss when merging, so don't worry if you get an smaller file.
Now downloading another of my favorite movies of all time ""Rescue Dawn"" for same uploader. Please seed this uploader's files, they are so perfect!"
,IncredibleX,2011-01-26T21:23Z,"Sorry, real bad quality, go forward to blu-ray rip."
,tkfortoowon,2011-09-09T21:12Z,"This rip conveys the movie faithfully. Nothing detracts. 

plays perfectly in VLC 1.1.4, looks great on 24"" 1900x1200 LCD

thanks! seeding...."

,80313131,2012-05-26T14:45Z,"this one has been stretched from a source with a lower resolution than the 1080,
that is so stupid, i chose this one because i wanted a good quality,
but instead of leaving it, in the highest original resolution, 
someone decided to ruin the movie up by stretching the picture, 
which only make it look worse, 
and even if it is scaled back to a lower resolution, 
the picture will still look worse compared to, if it was in the original resolution."
,Fitzy727,2012-05-27T05:45Z,"Thank you so much for the upload, been wanting to see this movie again for a while now!! +1

On a side note, there are many movies and shows out there (28 days later, grindhouse,machette, the walking dead) that are shot differently to give them that dark, grainy and gritty look. Don't believe me?  Go look it up!

I'm also appalled at how some people on here that bitch and complain about the picture for a movie that they are getting for FREE!!  This just goes to show how ignorant and selfish some people are out there.  Yeesh!"
