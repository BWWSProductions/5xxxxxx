,Jack_Raiden,2009-08-27T07:12Z,"All I have to say about The Informers is... this could've been, and was so close to being, such a great film. Great Bret Easton Ellis novel, great acting, but the director's final cut is one of the worst I've ever seen. (Bring on Ellis' Executive Producer's cut! :P )"

,the_devious,2011-02-21T09:49Z,"Guys... I don't contest your choice of compression/quality/file-size trade-off (i.e. high/average/low, in that order). You've got that market segment nailed, and all power to you.
The deal breaker here is that this movie has been so completely panned by the critics.
I love Kim Basinger, so I'll grab it and split out the bits with her in them.
Thanks."
