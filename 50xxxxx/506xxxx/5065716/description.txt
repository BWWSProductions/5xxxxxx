Wikipedia & Amazon

Just Over One Year After Their Last Studio Album, The Album Was Released Exactly 10 Years After The Release Of Their Very First Album "Forgiven, Not Forgotten" And Brings The Corrs Back To Their Roots Returning Full Circle With Their Latest Album Home. As The Title Suggests, The Corrs Are Back To Fond Beginnings, Defining A Journey That Began 15 Years Ago. It Is A Record That Is Held Close To The Bandâ€™s Hearts, Compiled Through A Songbook Of The Late Jean Corr (Their Mother), And It Includes Covers Of Old Irish Songs And Traditionals, But Also Covers Of Non-Irish Songs, Like 'Heart Like A Wheel'. It Includes 2 Tracks In Irish ("Buachaill Ã“n Ã‰irne" & "BrÃ­d Ã“g NÃ­ MhÃ¡ille") And 3 Instrumentals ("Old Hag (You Killed Me)", "Haste To The Wedding", "Return To Fingall").

Brought To Life By The Band's Urge To Bring New Interpretations To Traditional Irish Songs. Featuring The BBC Radio 2 Concert Orchestra And Working With Orchestral Arranger Fiachra Trench And Producer Mitchell Froom, Who Has Worked With The Corrs On Three Previous Albums, The Band Set Out To Create An Eclectic Mixture Of Songs And Instrumental Airs. The Mixture Of Traditional And Contemporary, Is One That Is Truly Celebrated Throughout Home.
