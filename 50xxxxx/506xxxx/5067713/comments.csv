You mount the .cue file using any program (like MagicDisc, Nero, Daemon, etc), then it mounts onto your computer as if you loaded a CD. You then have to browse to the MPEGAV folder, and open the .DAT file with any type of decent video player (VLC works for Video CDs).

What I was going to say, though, is that there really isn't any point in downloading a VCD version of movies anymore. The quality is horrible, and you can find 700 to 800 MB DVD rips that haven't been converted to VCD that look three times better."
