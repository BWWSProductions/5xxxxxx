,Argoroth,2009-09-06T06:09Z,Curse you for having Protected WMAs for the entire Hellbilly Deluxe CD... Curse you! Oh well... I suppose it could be worse... I think. It could be password protected archives!

,woodis,2011-04-11T23:15Z,"Please note that only 1 album is in WMA-format, rest is in FLAC-format. Don't know what that is? -> Don't bother with this download."

Anyone knows where to get their LIVE IN LJUBLJANA 1989 songs?"
,eyansilver,2011-12-01T21:00Z,"sowingmyseed: I love you. This is the most complete collection I can find. 
woodis: If you don't know what *.flac is, you're retarded. It's just a different compression style for a music file. Use converterlite or a similar program to change it from *.flac to *.mp3 or *.wma or whatever. 
Or use VLC to play the files as they are."
