(Amazon Review)
"What a tour this must have been! Imagine a pick-up band with Eric Clapton, Dave Mason and Jessie Ed Davis on guitars, the rest of Derek and the Dominoes behind them, Jim Price and Bobby Keys on horns and Rita Coolidge to sing back up vocals. That's the team that Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett fielded for this 1970 gem. Thank God it was recorded! You won't be able to sit still during the opening Things Get Better, which manages to showcase every musician in one killer tune. Delaney and Bonnie's voices are wonderfully soulful in their Tribute Medley to Robert Johnson, and Dave Mason's Only You Know and I know rises to a new level. Bonnie really belts it out during That's What My Man is For, and a fun Little Richard Medley is icing on the cake. E.C. always loved being part of a band, and it really shows here. Everyone playing on this CD was young, healthy, energetic and still learning how good their music could be. I bought the vinyl 30 years ago, and now with the CD, I'm still loving it. "

On Tour with Eric Clapton is the third album by Delaney & Bonnie Bramlett, and their first on the Atco/Atlantic label (catalog no. SD 33-326). Released in June 1970, this album features Delaney and Bonnie's best-known touring band, including Eric Clapton, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock, Leon Russell, Dave Mason, and George Harrison (under his pseudonym "L'Angelo Misterioso"). Many of the players on this album would later go on to work with Clapton on his solo debut and on Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, and with Harrison on his vocal debut album All Things Must Pass.

The cover photograph, taken by Barry Feinstein, was reportedly shot in 1966 while Feinstein was covering Bob Dylan's British tour. Dylan's feet are those hanging outside the car window.

The album was Delaney and Bonnie's most successful, reaching #29 on the Billboard album chart and achieving RIAA Gold Record status.
