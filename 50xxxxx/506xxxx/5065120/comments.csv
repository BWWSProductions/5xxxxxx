,cormaczoso,2012-06-12T20:47Z,"thanks for this one ... such an important group (even tho the personnel was in a constant state of flux) and they inspired, steered, led, etc., sooooo many big names in the late 60s to early 70s to do some of the best work of the bigger names careers ... i.e. eric clapton, who never did any better work than he did in the short years from Blind Faith to his first solo album and then to Layla ... strongly influenced by this forgotten duo with a lil' help from their friends ... 

thanks for upping it esp in lossless :)"
