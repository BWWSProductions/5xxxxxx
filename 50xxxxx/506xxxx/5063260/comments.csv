,mister_playboy,2009-08-30T00:55Z,"BTW... from Wikipedia:

""Last full release of the system was in 2005 with the 1.2R release but the eCS team as Mensys has been working on release 2 for a few years and announced in June 2009 that the upcoming RC7 Silver release would be the last one before the General Availability (GA) of version 2, the RC7 Silver release was then delivered on the 10th of August and the GA version is expected to follow later in the autumn."""
