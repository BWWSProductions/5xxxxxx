,UnlovedNec,2010-01-07T16:09Z,"The section describing how it works, and the answers in the FAQ, sound like pure bullshit to this physics major."
,Markstern,2010-03-27T10:27Z,"Indeed it sounds like quasi-scientific mumbo-jumbo, the majority of the steps ""required"" dont even particularly pertain to either the creation nor proliferation of a magnetic field. And how this (at BEST) curiosity would actually produce power is beyond me. Not to mention the fact that even if this machine could keep sending the electrons around and around forever it still couldnt actually power anything (at least not for long) since there is always a loss of current into heat whenever electromagnetic energy is converted into mechanical/kinetical energy. Now I only hope the fact that I'm dead tired and havent slept in 36 hours wont make my comment look stupid, not to mention incorrect. :--) Comments (wont read this thread again xD) to faulung@hotmail"
