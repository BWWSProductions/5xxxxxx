YOU HAVE TO BE MENTALLY DERANGED OR A HALFWIT TO BELIEVE SUCH A PLOT, BUT SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE IT. BAFFLES ME, IS MANKIND GOING STUPID?  "
,DL_King,2009-08-23T04:29Z,"IS MANKIND GOING STUPID? 

Judging by this phrase... Yes, yes it is.  

Your complaining about the plausibility of this show, Guess what James Gandolfini isn't actually likely to take over the New Jersey underworld but it doesn't mean the Sopranos wasn't a good show.  We live in a time where an Austrian bodybuilder can be elected as the governor of California and then go on to fight immigration, I believe anything can happen. 

PS Stop typing in Caps lock it doesn't in fact emphasize your point but rather makes you look like a retard."

,blkops,2009-09-16T10:56Z,64.1% is this going to increase? I hope the original up loader is just offline due to size...hmm
,mr_video,2009-09-16T14:27Z,Where are the Seeds.. Torrent stops at 64.4%. The other torrent w/ same file size has 72 seeds.. looks like dumping a 9 gig download and starting over.. :(
,DL_King,2009-09-16T21:31Z,There will be another seeder by the end of today and with 298 leechers and only me seeding how fast did you expect it to go.
,blkops,2009-09-19T02:28Z,"Thanks for this champion Torrent, when I get it I will seed it for a year!"
,marqi,2009-10-01T01:38Z,"only need season three, so that's all I'm dl/ing but I'll seed - and thank you DL!"
,danielle597,2009-10-19T23:59Z,"Thanks so much for the torrent,

And to viedma, have you ever even watched it..? actually very sophisticated and interesting, and yeah CAPS DOES MAKE YOU LOOK SLIGHTLY SPECIAL. its really not a big deal, calm down. : )"
,spliffed_1,2009-11-13T01:10Z,viedma for the Darwin Awards?
,illumin8ed,2010-08-02T21:20Z,"i am too patient. been dling for 2 days 14 hours. now at 53.8%. come on people. you dled it for free. seed it too. hell. limit your seed speed, but atleast seed."
,rapsn1,2010-08-13T02:17Z,"was it too hard to divide it up to s1,s2,s3 ?

 and this aint HD, its low qullity so dont place it under high res "
,MovieX101,2010-10-13T06:06Z,"Thanks For The Up!

@ rapsn1 - This torrent is divided up into 3 seasons, hence 37 files and this is not under high def!
To all complaining about slow download, if you download one season at a time you can finish this torrent awhole lot quicker! "
,olite,2011-02-26T12:42Z,"@viedma ... lol, what more can I say... but lol, dude go take a look at the shows on T.V. these days... I doubt many of them at all are really all that feasible.

@DL_King Cheers! - And yer!! You tell em. lol :-) "
