This film is yet more proof that Clint Eastwood is a better director than actor, though his acting is only a hair behind.  Personally, I liked this film better than "Million Dollar Baby", though Eastwood is the only real star in this one.  All the Hmong actors are basically unknowns who answered the casting calls put out specifically for Hmongs in major U.S. cities where they generally live in communities like the one depicted in the film.  If you haven't seen this film, and you like films about how even old dogs can learn to live again ... you'll love this one.


And since it's becoming a bit of new tradition for me, I actually know a bit of trivia about this film as well ... this is the FOURTH (or fifth, maybe) time that Clint Eastwood has played a Korean War veteran, and in real life, he is a Korean War vet, though unlike all his characters, he saw no combat.  Also ... I think the two guns that Eastwood brandishes in this film are both intended to be his service weapons -- the M1 Garand and M1911 pistol were both used in the early years of the Korean War, though I think the M1 Garand was phased out in favor of the M14 by the end.
