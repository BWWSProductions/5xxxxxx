A RAMDISK is a temporary hard drive in Windows created using your memory (RAM) that acts like a normal hard drive. RAM is many times faster, in both read/write speed, as well as access time compared to a traditional magnetic hard drive. 

RAM is volatile, meaning once you power down your computer you will lose all data stored in your ramdisk. 

You can temporarily store files, or install programs onto a ramdisk to experience lightning fast load times and file access for whatever is stored on the ramdisk. It can also be used on a server to provide temporary storage for high usage websites or databases. It can also be used for network throughput testing.

These are mostly for Windows Xp/Windows 2003 server, which are kind of hard to find these days which is why i'm uploading a torrent for them.
If you need versions for Vista or 2008, look elsewhere.
