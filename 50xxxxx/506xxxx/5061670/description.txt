Volume 5 of 8


mp3 @ 192kbs


This was the first album the Seasons did that contained all self penned songs (the original albums last track was "On Broadway Tonight" which would later turn up on the b'side of "I've Got You Under My Skin"). The Seasons originally recorded the track "An Angel Cried" in the 50's as Hal Miller & the Rays. But this new version contains Frankie's most powerful vocal to date. Every track on this CD is a gem. Featuring 3 great singles "Rag Doll" "Save It For Me" & "Ronnie" and 2 B sides "Huggin My Pillow" and "Funny Face". It was a pity Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe didn't create more albums like this for the Seasons, instead of relying on old standards and current trends like Dylan & Bacharach.
