[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-08-22T14:10Z,"If you can, please register at phrixus-sci (dot) org and PM me, Mr Sci.  Since TPB is falling, I am considering making my own tracker for nothing but informational torrents (books documentaries how-to's textbooks magazines etc), and I would definitely be interested in moving your torrents there.  Please PM me so we can talk further about this.

Thanks."
