Do you have any flash cs4 tutorials from www.learnflash.com and/or the tut's from http://www.digitalphotoshopretouching.com/?

You rock, dude!

Can you please help me i'm after a few tutorial and have been searching every where for them but cannot find them.

I'm after Dreamweaver 8 Dynamic Development, from lynda.com. also if you have any other Content Management System development tutorial I would really appreciate them such as sebastian sulinski at the following url - http://www.sebastiansulinski.co.uk/web_design_tutorials/tutorial/37/content_management_system_with_dreamweaver_cs4_php_mysql_and_fckeditor.
any help is uch appreciated. contact kaise@hotmail.co.uk "
,kaise,2009-11-13T16:38Z,"Sorry typo error in your name, gordsmash."
[T],FatFreddy756,2009-11-14T03:16Z,"@ kaise

check my Lynda.com Dreamweaver CS4 Dynamic Development torrent which is at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4980213/Lynda.com.Dreamweaver.CS4.Dynamic.Development.DVD and in there it'll teach you about databases and stuff."
,kaise,2009-11-16T17:58Z,"hey Gordsmash,

Thanks for the quick reply, i beleive that tutorial does not cover creating a CMS system that I wish to create. i believe i have that torrent downloaded already, will check it again to make sure.

Is there no chance of getting Dreamweaver 8 Dynamic Development.  The videos in there are all about creating a dynamic cms system that will help me immensly in learning dynamic development.

I have tried everything else and am having no luck at all.  your help will be much appreciated.

you can email me at kaise@hotmail.co.uk

Thanks"
