,Hypozeus,2009-08-27T07:34Z,This is very cool. Good work. Thank you.
,makave22,2009-09-05T13:36Z,Does this have the crack version of copilot without having to worrying about the serial number.
,daedelush,2009-09-07T05:28Z,This one doesn't require a serial its already cracked just follow the above instructions and your good.
,daedelush,2009-09-08T11:13Z,yeah and if you read the permissions on other apps as well you get prompted for the same sometimes.  it is also for POI dialing out so you don't have to memorize the number and dial manually.
,daedelush,2009-09-08T11:16Z,oh yeah and it could cost money if you are using the data portions (internet) and you dont have the unlimited g1/android data plan.
,HiddenShadow,2009-09-12T01:52Z,"copilot can also download canada maps seperately, awesome! Thanks, especially since we cant buy copilot in canada yet - they block us from buying paid apps in android market...."
,thasro,2009-09-22T20:04Z,Does anyone else have a problem with copilot shutting off when searching for a business? Would having CyanogenMod 4.1.11.1 have anything to do with it?
,emerheb,2009-09-24T22:29Z,does this work with windows mobile 6.1? (I have XV6800)
,Drmgiver,2009-10-07T18:35Z,"@emerheb  The apps are for Android, a Linux distro."
,droid88,2009-11-29T18:32Z,does this work on G1?
,daedelush,2009-12-01T08:28Z,yeah these work on all android devices.... g1 included.  only thing is that the copilot live is incompatible with donut (1.6) if your in North America as the NA version has not been cracked.  Alot of these are also outdated.  I have all the updated versions except for copilot live.  I switched to Mobile maps 2009/Google Nav.  I have been trying to update this torrent but i keep getting errors when i try to upload a never version.  Let me know if you require anything.

,Jblack88,2010-03-05T01:31Z,"ANSWERS ANSWERS PLEASE!! ANYONE ALIVE HERE, WHERE'S THE AUTHOR? "
,daedelush,2010-05-26T03:23Z,"yo buddy.  this is for the USA and you shouldn't need data if using the maps included off of the sd card.  i really can't help you with canada.  this works fine for my g1, hero, N1, and incredible.  not sure whats going on with your install.  to be honest i dont use this anymore as I use either the navigon or the built in google maps navi app.  there is a cracked maps app that will do the rest of the world.  i know you dont have data but i'm not sure how i can help ya buddy.  pm me and i'll shoot you the navigon app if you really require it.  and i can point you where to download the maps"
