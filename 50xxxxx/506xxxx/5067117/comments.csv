Cheers! My favourite book is now on my kindle!"
,abhipatu,2011-04-21T13:32Z,I do not know how to open it...it says file type unknown..can anybody help me...??
,Trickee,2011-05-31T12:16Z,"abhipatu: This is a .prc file for PDA devices (eBook reader etc...). You can download ""XnView"" to open it on your computer."
,Trickee,2011-05-31T12:26Z,Well I just tried it in XnView and this .prc file won't load. Maybe the file is damaged or maybe I need a different viewer...
,swumpster,2011-07-14T21:58Z,"flawless torrent, great book.
I used Mobipocket Reader Desktop to read the book, however there are a bunch of other software you could use instead."
,Trickee,2011-08-06T16:24Z,"Thanks swumpster, it works in Mobipocket. I don't know why I didn't see that in the description before."
,gonzo_don,2011-09-28T01:47Z,"Thanks, guys.  I got tired of downloading the book only to have it filled with errors so this was a true mission for me.  I really appreciate the comments."
,hayjude99,2011-10-12T03:13Z,"I love the torrent!  Thanks so much!  Just a quick correction: on page 60, it says, ""No.  It was supposed to he, but the arrangements got all screwed up.""  it should have a ""be"" instead of a ""he"".  Obviously its not a big deal, and its a great torrent otherwise.  "
,gonzo_don,2011-11-14T22:33Z,Thanks for the correction. I'm anal about this stuff.  I'll upload the corrected version with chapter bookmarks shortly.
,gonzo_don,2011-11-15T00:15Z,The final proof is up.  The Catcher In The Rye (Final Proof).  Added chapter bookmarks and corrected the one typo.
,supermarioman12,2011-12-08T21:43Z,wouldnt you just be able to open it in word?
,supermarioman12,2011-12-08T21:46Z,that would be a no :'(
,dhaze579,2012-05-25T03:01Z,"Good. If you want to read it on a Nook, though, you're going to have to convert it to something like EPUB. You can use a program called Calibre to do this, and i think it also converts it to and from any other ebook format.

Thanks!"
