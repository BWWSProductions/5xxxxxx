,neil_diamond ,2009-09-17T01:32Z,It takes a real ass to praise himself^^ and go around downing other peoples uploads while placing a link to his own in their comments. Sir...congrats I proclaim you ass of the month! long may you reign
,tribudi,2009-12-30T12:29Z,@neil_diamond: hahaa....ass of the mouth....nice call....but any way as long as you can share to others and let the download-ers judge which one is better...so keep rollin' 'guy' ..... i pick this torrent coz it provide more format than other people upload (go around downing other peoples uploads while placing a link to his own in their comments). shortly it makes me easy to compare and to choose which one is the best to download....or perhaps is it prohibited placing a link to his own in others comments??? well i don't know exactly....sorry guys...

+1 would download again."
