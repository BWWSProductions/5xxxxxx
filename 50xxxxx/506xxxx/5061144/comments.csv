,5233andy,2009-08-24T11:47Z,I got an error whilst installing on iPhone: 0xE8008001
,z9zzzzzz,2009-08-25T15:13Z,Read the instructions posted with the torrent.  0xE8008001 error happens when phone is jailbroken but appsync is not yet installed.  Appsync defeats apples drm.  Add http://cydia.hackulo.us to cydia sources then search for and install appsync.

Could I ask for the NZ version of this too? I would be very grateful if you could put it up. Thank you so much."
,jayz2005,2009-09-01T15:41Z,Is there anyone else getting the 'Poor GPS Reception' message constantly? I tested this today on my 32GB 3GS on a clear sunny day here in Sydney and it struggled to pickup a GPS signal.
,PSPnoObmOd,2009-09-01T23:44Z,"Really? Thats insane! Thats no way to get people to buy this app! God! So, New Zealand version anyone?"
,jayz2005,2009-09-02T12:17Z,I discovered the 'Poor GPS Reception' message may have something to do with a fault with my 32GB 3GS GPS chip. I installed this on a 16GB 3G and I no longer have any probs picking up a signal. Thanks very much for the app.
,PSPnoObmOd,2009-09-03T04:27Z,New Zealand version!!!!
,ODen3030,2010-01-28T05:54Z,"Works perfect, Thanks :)"
,mickstanz,2010-06-19T04:51Z,Anybody know where i can get a NZ version from?
