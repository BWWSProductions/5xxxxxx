Death On A Factory Farm [HBO] (2009)


More than ten billion animals are raised to wind up on American dinner plates each year. But because laws mandating humane treatment for these animals are weak and rarely enforced, animal-rights groups have turned to undercover investigators to help expose the abuse on these "factory farms." 

In this follow-up to the documentary Dealing Dogs [HBO] (2006), directors Tom Simon and Sarah Teale reteam with animal rights investigator "Pete" who goes undercover on an Ohio hog farm to explore allegations of animal cruelty.
