RELEASE NOTES

        
	Kerio WinRoute Firewall sets new standards in versatility, security and
 	user access control. Designed for corporate networks, it defends against
	external attacks and viruses and can restrict access to websites based on
 	their content. Kerio WinRoute Firewall, certified by ICSA Labs in the
	Corporate Firewall category, includes detailed rule definition to perform
	stateful inspection and protocol inspection of all outgoing and incoming
	Internet traffic.

	A network rules wizard assists in the rapid setup of the firewall. The
	primary function of any perimeter firewall is to control outgoing and
	incoming network traffic based on the corporate security policy. Kerio
	WinRoute Firewall offers detailed rule definition to perform stateful
	inspection of all Internet traffic and enforce the security policy. 
	A network rules wizard assists in the rapid setup of the firewall.

	Kerio WinRoute Firewall is a robust network firewall operating at the
	TDI/NDIS layers of the OS. Its deep inspection technology applied on both
	incoming and outgoing communication helps provide the highest security
	possible to the entire local area network, and as well as the computer
	it is running on. Kerio WinRoute Firewall security is based on traffic
	rules which allow configuration of packet filters, NAT (network address
	translation), port mapping and access control easily from one comprehensible
	table. 

	The built-in configuration wizard radically simplifies the process of
	creating a set of necessary traffic rules. Setting-up the firewall and
	connecting the network to the Internet takes minutes.
