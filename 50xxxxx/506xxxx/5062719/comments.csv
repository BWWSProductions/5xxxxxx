,Alaron251,2009-08-21T01:55Z,Not that good of a game tbh
,kraziaznvtboi,2009-08-21T02:13Z,"Thanks for the upload SJ, I was getting tired of bullshit Osmos copies from zengamer or whatever.

Clean and 100% Working!"
,NickDaMan0,2009-08-21T04:33Z,"@lolostag: Redownload it.

This game is awesome, I love it. I tried the demo and was left unhappy yesterday seeing as there were no torrents for it, until now. Thanks for the upload! Works perfectly fine, but rename it to something like ""cOsmos"" in Steam if you're going to launch it from Steam."
,dork1992,2009-08-21T05:36Z,"The game runs fine, however instead of controlling a circle it's like a few mesh squares that rotate, It's hard to explain. "

,leeeter,2009-08-21T18:53Z,WARNING: This caused all sorts of virus warnings on my machine!
,InsaneWombat,2009-08-22T05:48Z,WARNING: leeeter is a noob. quit using norton's please.
,kraziaznvtboi,2009-08-22T16:38Z,"False postives leeter.

From the Hemisphere FAQs:

""I?m running Kaspersky and it warned me about Osmos while I was installing the game.
Other users have reported this issue too; seems like Kaspersky Internet Security doesn?t like the Osmos installer. If you?re running a version of Osmos purchased through one of our partners (D2D, Steam), the installer is probably legit."""
