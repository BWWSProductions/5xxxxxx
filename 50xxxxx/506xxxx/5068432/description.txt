This is Pat Shannan's shocking video documentary Oklahoma City Bombing - Forerunner to 9-11 which exposes the famous bombing of Murrah Building in Oklahoma City 1995 as an inside job and a forerunner to a much bigger scale event that eventually happened on 11. september 2001 in New York. According to the federal theory, to which the news media ascribed without question, the bombing in Oklahoma City, at the Alfred P. Murrah Building on April 19, 1995, was the work of American dissidents bent on a violent overthrow of the government. Congress responded by immediately enacting legislation to give the government unprecedented latitude with the invasion of individual privacy. All evidence actually points to a well planned, sophisticated government operation put into motion months earlier, with a massive cover-up controlled by the U. S. Justice Department, and carried through and beyond the "Star Chamber" charade of trials in Denver in 1997. This amazing documentary is full of startling facts never made public by the establishment news media about the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma on April 19, 1995. Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 shocked the people of USA and provided the US government a pretext of introducing the first set of laws which restricted the freedoms of the people. This video documentary exposes the coverup behind the event where again the official explanation is a complete lie. 9-11 style scenario in 1995. 1h 50 min. long. A must see for everyone.
