Riley Martin Lifts Curse

Howard accepts a call from the previously fired Riley Martin to propose an idea that he can get his job back if he agrees to go on "Meet The Shrink".  Riley must be deemed a clean bill of health by the Dr. Keith Abalow (Dr. Drew's partner from Celebrity Rehab) in order to obtain his job back.

The "Meet The Shrink" Special airs on Friday and will be posted here after it airs.
