By Paul Andresen and Mo Stoebe
This is where conceptual cinematography meets Burning Man and highlights many of the short memorable idiosynchratic aspects of life in the desert. Paul and Mo compiled 51 short videos, each capturing an example of the random creativity and spontaneity that makes Burning Man so vibrant. The collection makes an amusing and intriguing overall picture.
