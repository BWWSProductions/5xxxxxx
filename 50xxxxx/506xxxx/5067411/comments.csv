,ErichH68,2009-08-24T04:37Z,  Actually I'm Circumcised and rather proud of it even though it wasn't my decision at the time.  Who needs that extra skin any ways.

I´M NO JEW AND UNCIRCUMCISED, BUT IT´S JUST ANOTHER NEONAZI EXCUSE TO SPREAD  HATRED AGAINST JEWS, SOME POOR SAD DARK WANKERS WHO BLAME JEWS FOR THEIR MISERABLE LIVES, THAT THE JEWS DO THIS OR DO THAT, ANYTHING IS GOOD FOR THAT SCUM TO SPREAD HATRED, FORTUNATELY THESE DAYS ONLY FEW MISERABLE BEINGS LIKE THEM BELIEVE THEM."
