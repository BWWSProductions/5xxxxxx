,slkiller,2009-08-27T00:08Z,"im downloading now... to the above commenter, usually cracks and keygens will read as virus's... usually a false positive... consider the uploader is a trusted member im going to try it. will return with results!"
,slkiller,2009-08-27T00:34Z,"yep, its fine. shows up as a virus on avast, ran it, just a simple keygen. nothing to worry yourself over"
,elies12,2009-08-27T14:01Z,"I just tried the keygen on Windows 7 & XP and I'm not able to kick it off. I keep getting: ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item""
I made sure I'm running it as an admin and Anti_virus is turned off. So I'm not sure what the problem is with this file"
,rancidguy,2009-08-30T12:04Z,"True, the keygen shows up as a virus, but i disabled avast to finish the download, then installed. Worked perfectly :) two thumbs up"
,rancidguy,2009-09-08T07:05Z,"Actually, after I installed it & registered, on reboot MalwareBytes detected a startup-process trying to start in background, which was the key-gen. LOL so the keygen will install some malware but just scan after you register & reboot & it should discover the shit & quarantine the keygen, then just delete your quarantine..."
,YIUKOROCHKO,2009-09-11T03:12Z,"Hey thanks uploader
