,Hawkmum,2009-08-31T18:09Z,  I'm sorry if this is an ungrateful question.... but why is it taking so long.... I've got 28% and ETA is more than two years... Vuze has been on almost constantly for 12 days...(all my relevant settings are in order).

I wont let it die. "
[T],ecolo,2009-09-03T01:43Z,Also Vuze maybe contributing to my problems since the last update it feel sluggish reverting to an old build don't seem to fix the problem.
