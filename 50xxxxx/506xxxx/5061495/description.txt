HAWKWIND
---------------------------------------------------------
Space Ritual 1973 rem 2007 Collector's digipack ed.
 
Live at Liverpool Stadium 22nd December 1972 & London Brixton Sundown 30th December 1972.

I used XLD for Mac (CDParanoia Mode) log included, 
Flac extracted with XLD at 0 compression, fastest, best quality.

For the DVD I made a ISO image with CloneCD on Window XP

It's not a live show movie but a DVD audio with psychedelic animation and 2 promo video clips.

Sorry no artwork.
