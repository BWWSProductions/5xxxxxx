,veovisc,2009-09-02T01:39Z,"Mrchairman, you are a fool.  There are a few reasons for this I could cite, based only on your foolish comment.  One is that just because datatheif thinks tpb has gone downhill drastically (a sentiment that is shared by MANY of us) doesn't mean he shouldn't search for torrents here.  You're like the idiots who say ""don't like this country then get out!"" without even a clue as to their flawed logic and deep ignorance.  Secondly, datatheif fortunately took the time to comment and let users here know that what they are looking for CAN be found elsewhere.  I for one am grateful for such comments, and am getting rather sick of idiots like you, mrchairman, who just want to deride them, shoot them down, and ultimately waste everyone's time and bandwidth (however small an amount) doing so.  Before you tell others to shut up, consider doing so yourself.  "

Read and you will understand :)"
,watbol,2009-09-10T20:35Z,"Dis-reguard my first comment, that was B4 I watched it.

Spoken language 'englich... NOT!
Spoken language 60% French.
with Russian subtitles... The first 6.5 min's I didn't have a clue what was being said.
with french being spoken and russian being read? go figure..

All in all, I didn't care for that experiance, but the quality was right up there:
A-9
V-9
