Description:
Masonux is derivative of Ubuntu Linux 9.04 using the LXDE desktop environment created using remastersys. It relies completely on those projects for its existence. If any of those projects cease to exist, this one will. Masonux contains the following: Ubuntu base install (from the 10 megabyte mini.iso, found here), LXDE, Firefox, Pidgin, Synaptic Package Manager, ubiquity graphical installer, remastersys, and a few other ease-of-use packages.

Minimum Requirements
256 megabytes of RAM, 2 gigabytes of hard drive space, and a home desktop or laptop computer with an Intel or AMD processor manufactured in the last decade or so. The base install will use about 1gb of hard drive space and 60mb of RAM at boot. The installer itself requires 256 mb of RAM. After it is installed, you are good to go with 128 or even less, depending on your needs.

There is one known bug in this release that takes 2 minutes to correct once it is installed. Please see the release notes page, linked above.

This is in the "UNIX Applications" category because there is no "Linux Distributions" category.
