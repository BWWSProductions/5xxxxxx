Gold Audio Suite v3.2.1.2 made Portable (Thinstalled).

No need to install it!
Or, if you want to, Serial and Setup are included. This is the GiveAwayOfTheDay.com Free program for today.

Their Setup is installing v3.2.1.1 but one of the files is detected by some AVs (like mine) as a Trojan. The Program site is actually delivering the v3.2.1.2 that doesn't have this problem. The Serial works fine with this one too.


Gold Audio Suite is a mighty and handy application to match all you requires with audio data. It can record audio from microphone, internet radio, CD and any sound you can hear from your computer, besides converting audio files between popular audio formats based on your need with best quality. This unique digital audio multitrack editing software is intuitive, full-featured and flexible.

This has been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
