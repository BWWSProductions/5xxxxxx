H.264
Is a standard for video compression 
H.264 videos including MKV, MP4 and Mov
in this case, mp4

H264 = HQ ... to HD... to files
for hindi it would be simple Hindi in the title of the movie


this file  at 799mb is in mp4... but is in HQ so it's worth a file that big  to dl .......... is maybe Remastered

to open an mp4 file, use or gom player or kmplayer..........bsplayer won't open this mp4..............only bsplayer pro
