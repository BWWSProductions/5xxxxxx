Release Notes:
Nostalgica  features an all new repertoire for The Ten Tenors,
a two-hour high-energy journey of musical nostalgia through
some of the greatest musical moments ever
writtenâ€”old-fashioned standards, movie magic and hit-parade
classicsâ€”all presented with the uncompromising vocal power for
which The Ten Tenors are notorious.

Artistic Director, Matthew Hickey describes Nostalgica as â€˜â€¦a
musical journey, which picks up where opera left off and leads
us to where we are todayâ€™.
