The movie was pretty corny - but the message is a good one. The acting was OK. I was kind of annoyed that everyone had a cell phone, but sometimes used them and didn't use them other times when they could have been useful - within minutes of each other. But it would have taken away some of the uncertainty if they used them every time it would have been reasonable to do so. Children of divorce need closure as much as the parents do. They also need to understand that the marriage did have some good times and that their parents can still respect each other. It's also good to reinforce the idea that the children are a wonderful product of the marriage. After several years of bitterness, the parents decided to hold a divorce ceremony. The idea of this seemed kind of weird and morbid to me at first, but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like a good idea. It's a way of laying the past to rest and moving forward for everyone involved. The stepmother was a very wise and compassionate person - Too bad it's not like this in every step family. The problems with the daughter were pretty easily resolved - This isn't like real life by any means. I watched it because there wasn't much else on and like I said, the message was a good one. I probably won't watch it again.
