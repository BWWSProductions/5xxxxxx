,u2hmtmkmkm,2010-05-13T10:34Z,"Love the torrent. Thanks heaps for it. Just have one question. When I try to burn the episodes to a 4.7gb DVD, the program I'm using is showing that a 110ish mb file is actually much larger, around 1600mb) and I can only fit 2 episodes per disc (3 pushes it over 4.7gb). Same with the pilot episode - 160mb comes to 2300mb. Any reason for this?"

A year late, but better late than never. The DVD creator needs to convert the videos to MPEG-2, a significantly less efficient codec than Xvid, H.264, or MPEG4. Thus, much larger file sizes. 

Hell, if H.264 was around when DVDs were invented, we would probably be using CDs for movies, because of the much smaller file size."
