,dkelley,2009-08-21T05:51Z,"Hiya, my first ever comment on this site....

and it's...

would someone Please seed this dang torrent?

LoL  :-)

cheers guys.  I always seed to a decent ratio when I'm done, I wish the OP and hopefully the first few people to have received this in full would seed it for a few days at least.  If you create a torrent, please seed it for a long time, don't expect it to magically work without your help.

cheers"
,SabinN,2009-08-21T23:44Z,"the rar file P-SPECT.R52 is corrupt.

All rar's in the archive are 47.6MB, however r52 is only 17.4MB.

I to redownload it but it still completes at 17.4MB. Does this mean this torrent is a waste of time since we can't unrar it?"
,Onireign,2009-08-22T00:59Z,yeah i got a corruption warning too
,cncfrost,2009-08-22T03:15Z,Corruption warning. Will uncompress to a no-good iso. Useless download without the rar fix. Sorry!
,edeadmotion,2009-08-22T10:53Z,was so looking forward to this :( can the uploader repair the corrupted file so we dont all have to download it all again?
,SabinN,2009-08-24T08:29Z,I have abandoned this broken torrent. This is a failed PROMiNENT release :(
,sonjoe,2009-08-24T08:50Z,"Ok I've got an idea here. I've download this torrent. And I also encounter the .r52 file with only 18mbs size. I found the same file on another torrent and aparrently this new file is the correct size. If this works...  I'll upload a new torrent with the fixed file.. Just be patient please. Or better yet, would you be happy if I just upload a torrent with the missing file?"
,Ramza85,2009-08-24T13:12Z,Don't bother d/l this one untill the fixed rar file is up... Please do so Sonjoe!!
,syndre,2009-08-24T14:01Z,"after a little searching, I managed to find a good p-spect.r52 file."
