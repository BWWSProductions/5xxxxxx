Eduardo Ramos, G. Cisneros, Rafael Fernandez-Flores, Alfredo Santillan-Gonzalez, "Computational Fluid Mechanics"
World Scientific Publishing Company | 2001-12-15 | ISBN: 9810245351 | 300 pages | PDF 

This volume presents recent advances in computational fluid dynamics. The topics range from fundamentals and computational techniques to a wide variety of applications in astronomy, applied mathematics and meteorology. They describe recent calculations in direct numerical simulation of turbulence, applications of turbulence modelling of pollution problems in mesoscale meteorology and industrial applications. The emerging topic of parallelization of CFD codes is also presented. This volume should appeal to graduate students, researchers and anyone interested in using digital computation as a powerful tool for solving fluid dynamics problems in science and technology.
