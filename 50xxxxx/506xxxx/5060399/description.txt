This is the official DSA DVD guide to the stupid moneymaking Hazard Perception test.

It contains 10 clips to practice on, plus info on what to look out for presented by Suzi Perry. Also some practice theory questions and other bits. Unrar and mount iso in daemon, or burn to DVD. This will play on your TV and DVD player, it is not an application.

I wish you good luck!

If this helps you, please seed!!!!!!!
