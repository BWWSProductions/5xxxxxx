Red Dragon is a 2002 thriller film, based on the novel of the same name written by
Thomas Harris and featuring psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The
film was directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally, who also wrote the
screenplay for The Silence of the Lambs; it stars Edward Norton as FBI agent Will
Graham and Anthony Hopkins as Lecter â€” a role he had, by then, played twice
before in The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.

Red Dragon is, in publishing chronology, the first story in the Lecter saga (Hannibal
Rising, a later-published origin story, was released in 2007). Red Dragon's story
takes place before the events in The Silence of the Lambs, and after Lecter's
original capture and incarceration. While Lecter plays a central role, Red Dragon
focuses more on the characters of Will Graham and the tortured serial killer,
Francis Dolarhyde.

In his Baltimore townhouse, famous local psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter hosts a
dinner party. The main subject of conversation over dinner is the disappearance of
a local musician who was criticized for playing several wrong notes at a concert
that Lecter attended. He then serves the guests a delicious meal.

After dinner, Lecter is visited by Will Graham, a young gifted FBI agent, with whom
he has been working on a psychological profile of a local serial killer. Edible body
parts of the victims, such as the kidneys and liver were removed from the bodies
after being killed, and Graham is convinced that the killer is actually a cannibal.
During the consultation and brainstorming session, Graham discovers evidence
implicating Dr. Lecter in the murders, shortly before Lecter returns and attacks
Graham, wounding and nearly killing him before Graham resists and subdues him.

Lecter is subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in an institution for the
criminally insane while Graham, severely traumatized by the experience, retires
from the FBI.
