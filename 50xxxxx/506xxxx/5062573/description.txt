In 1991, after decades of skepticism and disbelief, the existence of psychic powers was finally, definitively proven.  Today, an estimated 1% of the world's population possesses psychic abilities.  These people are not super-heroes.  In most ways, they're just ordinary people, living ordinary lives.  They have families, careers, and dreams; they eat, sleep, live... and die.  One such person is precognitive Detective Owen Young. When a secret he's kept for years - a secret that could send not only him, but many of his friends to prison - falls into the hands of an opportunistic criminal he faces a terrible decision.
