,woody1815,2009-08-21T13:26Z,"hi wanderer,, thx for upload,,
whats best setting 2 hav it on for speed then ?"
,Groo_The_Wanderer,2009-08-21T13:44Z,"use utorrent .get a stable version , not a beta
make sure your isp or firewall is not blocking your access to the bit torrent network,there is a tool for that in utorrent under settings, use that to check,measure your upload speed and set it accordingly in your upload settings in utorrent, if you got 512kl set it to 42 256kl to 21 128kl 11 1MB 84,.if you have more than  one torrents running then put them on hold. if you have a lot of torrents running than you will never get a lot of speed "

,Groo_The_Wanderer,2009-08-21T21:27Z,"this is the original p2p release. the upload by whoever your talking about is taken by this release and repacked by scene standards, it doesn't make any difference, you will still  get the same files.
Its how the scene works.Read the last paragraph in my description .

scene p2p, for me it doesn't make any difference , the important thing is that  this filed is shared to a lot of people and shared good.you are all welcomed to take my uploads rename them to whatever you want and share so everyone can get them."

,john5246,2009-09-30T03:32Z,"What does he mean when he says:


""THIS IS A NON-SCENE RIP""?????"
,john5246,2009-10-03T22:28Z,"@davkal2010

""finished!! 100% sorry but i wont seed. it slows my internet down! ""

It slows down everyone's internet to upload so that's why you go to:

Tools>Options>Scheduler

and adjust your upload speed to be high at night when there's plenty of bandwidth not being used!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Just remember that someone sacrificed their speed to upload to you! 

FOR GOD'S SAKE GUYS AT LEAST TURN YOUR UPLOAD SPEED UP WHEN YOUR SLEEPING AT NIGHT!"
,john5246,2009-10-03T22:34Z,"THIS GAME WORKS 100%




Thanks to the uploader you are the best!! I will seed this.

PLEASE GO TO:

 TOOLS>OPTIONS>SCHEDULER 
The scheduler allows you to have different speeds at different times of the day automatically once you set it.

Set high speed and low speed in the boxes. Then click each box to change it's color how you want it. Each box corresponds with a time of day. Please turn your set your upload to unlimited overnight! "
,staggerlee237,2009-10-07T20:53Z,hey davkal2010. at least your honest> you gotta seed dude! it's the least  you can do considering you're getting the game for free!!! with no seeds there are no torrents. you give and ya get share your bandwidth dude or use limewire like a N00B
