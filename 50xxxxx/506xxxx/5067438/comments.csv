,sonofdog,2009-08-31T13:14Z,Been stuck at 76.4% for some days now. I know it says 1 seed here but no seeds are coming through. Help :-(  I might try downloading the smaller file.
[T],verifire,2009-09-04T15:39Z,"@sonofdog: Try adding the trackers above, and by the way, amazingly enough, after trying to keep this thing seeding for ten (TEN!!!) days, and hundreds have got it down, I'M STILL THE ONLY ONE SEEDING!! Come on.. Why do you tempt me to speak my mind in words I'd rather not have in my head or heart? If you want it for yourselves, people, then SEED after you! Come on.. This is pathetic.. ""OOooh.. I might get caught..""  For exposing the truth? You should be proud of that.. V."
,bubaman,2009-11-13T09:45Z,please where are seeders?
[T],verifire,2009-11-20T00:36Z,There's seeds out there. The trackers just don't report properly all the time.. I'm seeding 24/7..
