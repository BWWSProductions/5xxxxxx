A True classic...


    Arthur Biship (Charles Bronson) is a mob hit man who operates in a world of his own...an uncompromising world where conventional rules of mortality don't apply and where one wrong move could cost him his life! He's always worked alone, but as age catches up on him,Bishop takes on a competent and ruthless apprentice (Jan-Michael Vincent) and teaches him everything he knows. Together they become an unmatchable team of globetrotting killers...until the pupil's ruthlessness puts him on a colision course with his teacher!!
