,paxju,2009-08-22T19:44Z,It freezes at 3rd tuorial for some reason on mine cfw 5.00 m33-6 with this text enabled to 5.50 i have psp 2000

,enerene,2009-08-23T05:35Z,"Ok, i just downloaded it, i used winrar to extract it and it's 1.50something gig. i copied it to my X:\iso folder, opened it and it says the game could not be started. 

HERE'S HOW TO FIX THAT:

,scotv453,2009-08-23T20:53Z,"Thx for the upload.

But I can't be the only one experiencing constant freezes with this game. I have done the cfw 5.50 trick.

I started downloading this with ubuntu linux (i prefer it over windows) with a compiled version of VUZE. I use the standard archive app for ubuntu to extract the content. I then used my vista machine to redownload, re-extract, and put it on my psp. I also tried the data install just for giggles.

No matter what I do, the game freezes while in story mode. Correction....I completed clouds story with no problem. Anyone else would freeze on the same place.

I kinda pisses me off that finally a good game for me comes out on psp and it is not even playable. Anyone else encountered this?"
,scotv453,2009-08-23T20:57Z,Sorry for double post. But to clarify every character will freeze at the same spot in the game. Meaning if i am squall he would lock up at the second chapter at the second to last encounter before end. But it would be different for say tidus. 
,PlayStationBeyond,2009-08-24T01:23Z,"your the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

dude i seriously love you right now..(btw i am not homosexual^-^) uh ye well ben waiting for the USA version for a long time.. but i must ask this has been out for over 2 weeks what took so long mate..i was about to cry..

,twistedillusion,2009-08-24T04:55Z,nice up.  works perfectly on 5.50 gen b  no tricks needed.  time for the homebrew guys to wake up and realize darkalex isn't the only firmware maker on the market.....
,azure0,2009-08-24T07:14Z,also please try to realize that GEN firmware is based from the m33 code.
,AkumaKaryuudo,2009-08-24T11:28Z,"toxic u r godlike, THANKS A LoT for the upload. and thanks to all the seeders ya are great im gettin 1.2MB/s and will be proud to seed my share"
,PlayStationBeyond,2009-08-26T02:07Z,"this game doesnt only work with 5.50 gen B, i am running 5.03 m33-6 and its running perfectly..very :P thanks toxic"
,godlikekiller,2009-08-26T15:30Z,how do you transfer it over to PsP? im noob on this way
,budaslight,2009-08-26T19:33Z,I^m new how do i make this work on my psp i`ve extract it and got a file with a winrar and extracted again and got 2 files where do i place them.
,budaslight,2009-08-26T19:40Z,i got an error of damage file 
,scotv453,2009-08-27T15:46Z,"I wonder out of all these people saying this works, how long have you been playing? I am assuming everyone is playing the well known characters like cloud, tidus, squall. Can anyone confirm they have beat fairon's story? 

I still get lock-up on this game. I could have came on here, played it for 5 mins, then said it was ok, but it is not. I am on 5.50 Gen A.

Gen is based off of m33, but it doesn't make it m33. Most things that make m33 good is not currently present in Gen.

And everyone asking about how to put iso's on a psp you need to learn to google. If you don't know how to I can't see you lasting long with a custom psp. And, if you are trying to install this on a non custom psp.....YOU ARE AN IDIOT!!!! Google is big for a reason."
,PlayStationBeyond,2009-08-30T05:58Z,"to scotv453, finished Dissidia.. took about 5 days, didn't play continously, beat every story, played it twice.. got each character to level 25. or above, got cloud tolevel 100..

i am running 5.03 m33-6 runs perfectly..and i mean perfectly..i had the same problems with my fat before ( now i have a slim) after my fat broke..for unexpected reasons.. played Naruto ultimate Ninja heroes  the phantom fortress(first release) and final Fantasy.. both kepy crashing at unexpected times had to save alot..you might getting the same problem.. 

try switching to m33, disabling all plugins, and having a UMD inserted while playing..

other then that Dissidia is a great game. Love cloud ^^ and uh i was hoping for a better graphics like seen in the end and beginning  ( more throughout the story)...but ah who cares 

""Not interested"" PEACE! and good luck scotv"
,neogaidenx,2009-08-30T12:32Z,"I have a problem, game is running fine and playable on 5.00 M33-6 but during the scene where cloud is fighting sephiroth the video stopped as if it hanged.. i had to skip the cutscene .. is there a fix to this? and is it because the game has 5.55 update in it?"
,PlayStationBeyond,2009-08-30T22:00Z,"try updating to 5.03 m33, same custom firmware i have and none of the videos hanged..

it might just be a plugin that you have installed under game, try disabling them first, if that doesnt work then try updating 

because for the that cutsene where sephiroth and cloud are fighting, was the best :P ""not interested"" Peace.. 

OHH ye..forgot you can view different cutscenes from the theatre option, try replaying it there first, and check if you have to skip it again..

""not interested"""
,scotv453,2009-09-01T13:07Z,"@PlaystationBeyond. I am gonna redo my whole psp. And get back to m33. I will also try what you suggested. Since I can recreate this issue fairly quickly, I will be back soon to update everyone. 

I am almost sure it is my psp, which is fat by the way. But, I never had this problem with any of my games. I got about 75 games right now, but only beat about 30 of them. No offense at all toxic. I am just a very big Final Fantasy person and hate to miss out on any new install. I actually like the game.....when it works. Can't wait to get this fixed so i can start whooping people online."
,PlayStationBeyond,2009-09-02T01:58Z,"good luck scot with formatting your psp, and it's system restore..if you have any luck with your problem please post back^^

i am very big Final Fantasy fan aswell, finished playing Dissidia, and well now i am playing Final Fantasy Crisis Core once again, although the game kept crashing on my fat before which ineveitably caused it to ruin however now i have a new playstation Slim :P

By the way if you and anyone else has a demoniod invite please contact me at playstation_beyond_tpb@hotmail.com"
,scotv453,2009-09-02T08:46Z,"The problem came back, but with interesting results. I use catb50 magic memory stick that loads cfw 3.80 (not sure of the patch). After update, I played dissidia for about 4-5 hours, and no problems. I know I was suppose to post back, but got excited because it worked!!!! I am a big fan of the rss the psp has, so that gave me the reason to upgrade.

I used the downloads from http://www.atmaxplorer.com/2008/10/psp-custom-firmware-500-m33-is-released/ to get the files needed to update my psp to 5.00m33-6. For further details, I used the first mirror of both the eboot.pbp and the 500.pbp. 

I am a themes geek too. So I flashed a theme by muted. (You can get it on consolespot.net)

I noticed that my original save, from 3.80, didn't work anymore. I know there is a solution out there, but wasn't in the mood to research it, so I started a new game.


Now I turned off all the plugin from the registry menu (xmb, umd, registry), and verified that all the plugins under plugins were off too. I also had Dynasty Warriors Orochi in before I started my game. 

Even these settings, I still encountered the problem. It is for certain that when i get to stage where you fight ultimecia with warrior of light, it will freeze during the fight. No specific time really. It can happen during the initial cutscene or during the fight.

Sigh......I wanna enjoy it, but I am getting fustrated. "

As for this .iso is concerned, I've put over 2 hours into the hero of light character's storyline with no problems running all plugins on 5.00 M33-6. By the way, UMD/.iso mode ""Sony NP9660"" works excellent with no disc in the tray. Also, the game converts to a .cso nicely, unlike that Rock Band: Unplugged. ;-)"
