Description:
Clayton Kirk, better known by his stage name Brotha Lynch Hung, is an American rapper from Sacramento, California.
Lynch first began rapping in 1986 under the name Ice Cold, along with his half-brother Sicx (then known as Strobe Light). Around 1989, by the suggestion of Sicx, he changed his name to fit his rapping style and ability to take out other rappers in battle, becoming Brotha Lynch Hung. He signed with Ced Singleton's Black Market Records for his 1992 debut EP, 24 Deep. His 1995 album Season of da Siccness graphically chronicled a life of drug use and sale, promiscuity, ultraviolence, rape along with heavy themes of cannibalism. It was certified Gold
