,eccentrikpancake,2009-09-11T02:16Z,why on earth would convert flac to vbr? horrible.
,marklar2u,2009-12-02T01:20Z,"eccentrikpancake - dear critical prick, the reason to convert a FLAC file is not everyone cares to devote/waste such file size, particularly for devices with limited resources/storage.

To start with FLAC should be as good, or almost as good, as starting with an original/CD ...but certainly you can post your FLAC file since your such a stickler.

Secondly, VBR in and of itself isn't bad.  Do you know what it means?  Variable Bit Rate.  And, depending on the min and maz bit rates, can be quite good.  In fact, recent studies have shown alot of people can't distinguish qualitative differences--particularly on the equipment available to them.

We're patiently awaiting your contribution though..."
,trondamon,2010-03-08T20:46Z,"good quality, thanks"

well played sir."
,anon0613,2010-11-12T17:32Z,"so um...I don't know why anybody gets all bent out of shape about the bit rate or the quality...and I also don't know why anybody downloads cd-rips that are over 128kbps being that CDS ARE ENCODED AT 128!!!  IF YOU RIP AT A HIGHER RATE, YOU'RE JUST DUPLICATING DATA!!  If you want higher quality than a cd, you need to go for a digital download of the source material or a digital download of the album from the ARTIST/STUDIO.  Bunch of tarts...""waaaa, it's not FLAC"""
,ahtnos,2011-02-24T06:42Z,"Actually, CDs are encoded at 1411.2 kbit/s, according to wikipedia. So no, encoding MP3 rips at greater than 128 is not a waste. Really, 128 kbit/s MP3s can sound pretty crappy in the right circumstances. 192 kbit is usually ok. For me, anything greater than 192 kbit/s is basically indistinguishable from FLAC. "
,MaxKohler,2012-04-10T05:20Z,"lulz, vbr0 is the best mp3 format to convert to. and it's pretty much indistinguishable from flac like someone already said. CBR 320 wastes space as well.

When downloading I always look for vbr0 or flac - which I then convert myself to vbr0.

Thanks Kilczer for awesome upload :)"
