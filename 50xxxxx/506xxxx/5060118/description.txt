PLOT: Testsuya Gojo visits his wealthy, distant aunt, Rikka Kojin; to borrow money for an operation for his dear childhood friend Utsumi Ayaka, who is like a sister to him. However, in return for lending Tetsuya money, Rikka makes a deal with him; he must take beautiful women into her house and train them as prostitutes for use by the rich and powerful in her bizarre sex cult. They are forced to participate in sexual acts so depraved that just to witness them is likely to turn a man into a monster. But there is more to this cult than simply carnal indulgence and before he knows what is really going on Tetsuya finds himself involved too deeply to ever return to his normal life again.
