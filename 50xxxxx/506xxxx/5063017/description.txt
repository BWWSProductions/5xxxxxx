All of the tracks here (actually, in this series) are presented in their full, unedited rump-shaking glory. 
Most notable here is the 12" version of Funkadelic's "One Nation Under a Groove," which, if you remember, when it first came out, was a promotional-only 12" that we were endlessly teased with by the radio stations and select DJs who were fortunate enough to have a copy. After much bitching and threats by us (the buying public), the label responded to our demands and released it, almost a year after the original mix came out! The guitar riffs of this version and clocking in at 11-minutes plus makes this CD worth the price alone! 
The other tracks on the disc do not disappoint either!
A definite must have for all the old heads!! (Customers from Amazon)
