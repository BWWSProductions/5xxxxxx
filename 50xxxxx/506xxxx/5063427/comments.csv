,matriarchies,2010-10-16T09:02Z,"Film aspect ratio is 2.35:1, but this copy is uncropped 1920x1080, so there's black bars at the top and bottom that shouldn't be there.

Had some problems seeking by small amounts of time (Alt+Left, Alt+Right) in VLC.

There's no subtitles, which would be nice for some parts during the film.

VLC doesn't show the total duration of the video, or the current playing position."
