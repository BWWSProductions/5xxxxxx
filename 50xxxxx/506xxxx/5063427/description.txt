Rounders (1998)

Set against the backdrop of New York's high-stakes underground poker world, 
Rounders is the tale of Mike McDermott, a master card player who trades the 
poker-playing rounds for law school and a shot at a new life with his 
girlfriend Jo. For Mike, the new life he's staking out seems like a legitimate 
road to success, but it's short on the thrills and excitement of back room poker 
games. But when Mike's longtime friend Worm is released from prison, Mike is 
faced with the high-stakes dilemma of his life: to keep on the straight and 
narrow, or deal himself back into the world of the Rounders. Rounders also stars 
John Malkovich as the seedy Russian card shark Teddy KGB, who runs the biggest 
and most dangerous game in town; John Turturro as Joey Knish, Mike's old-time 
poker mentor, and Martin Landau as Professor Petrovsky, Mike's law school dean. 
As the stakes rise, each one of these men also deals a hand in Mike's ultimate 
fate.
