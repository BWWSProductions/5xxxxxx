Dinosaur(2000) PG
Disney / Buena Vista | 2000 | 82 mins | Rated PG | Sep 19, 2006


Set 65 million years ago, DINOSAUR tells the compelling story of an iguanodon named Aladar, who is separated from his own kind and raised by a clan of lemurs, including the wisecracking Zini and the compassionate Plio. When a devastating meteor shower plunges their world into chaos, Aladar and his family follow a herd of dinosaurs heading for the safety of the "nesting grounds." As the trip becomes one pulse-quickening adventure after another, it also forges friendships that no hardship can destroy.
