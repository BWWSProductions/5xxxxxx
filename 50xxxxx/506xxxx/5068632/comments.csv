,Genasai,2010-01-10T09:16Z,"Ok so I downloaded this, and Ive mounted it into Daemon Tools Lite (4.12.3) but I cannot seem to get anything to run?

I can open the files and look around but there doesn't seem to be any .exe files, just  a .pdf booklet, all in Dutch, what I can't understand much of.  I can see that it has phrases in, but there is no English translation.

Am I doing something wrong, or is this not what I thought it was?"
,Genasai,2010-01-11T02:59Z,"Sorry...Just wanted to point out that maybe I didn't fully read the description, and thought this included the program... Opps!"

,Relex4,2010-05-05T16:03Z,"Thank you for your share. Do you have its audio companion. or does someone know where I can download it?

Thanks a lot in advance!"
,Caasiah,2010-08-05T20:09Z,"I went to ""add a new language"" and it asked me to update. I already have V3. This is the only one I've had a problem with."
,netrage,2010-08-14T11:55Z,"This torrent is working absolutely FINE.

If you have not mounted the ISO then  you cant do it, better use Dameon Lite to mount it,
 dont use winrar to unzip ? :( some do, 
Also Please dont accuse the uploader without trying all the options."

,kittten,2011-12-31T19:26Z,"For everyone asking, this is the language file pack only. You also need to download & install the Rosetta Stone software itself:
Rosetta Stone V3.4.7
Link http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5852393/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.7___Crack(VasiaZozulia)

If you follow the instructions, it works. I can confirm. Follow them exactly. "
,Vreds,2012-01-01T12:15Z,"For the record, if you're having problems getting the program to acknowledge these data files Dae-mon-tool-s has an option to add an s.c.s.i. virtual drive. Add one, mount the ISO to that virtual drive instead of the default DT drive. Solved my issue."
,bllorx,2012-02-21T05:45Z,"Thanks, works perfectly."
