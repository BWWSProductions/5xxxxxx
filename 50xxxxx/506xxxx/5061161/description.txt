4 VERY rare tracks from Eminem's old group Soul Intent (before Slim Shady EP, before Dr. Dre, before Infinite, etc), as well as an artwork picture.  This is NOT the '95 demo that everybody has, but from an album of which I don't know.  They are very old tracks, so quality isn't great, but just turn up those speakers.  The tracks are in MP3 format.

Please seed and keep this shit alive!
