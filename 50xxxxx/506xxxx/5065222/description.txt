It has been two years since the September 11 tragedy and the grief of the American nation is as raw today as it was in the aftermath of the disaster, but over the past 18 months there has been a promise of hope as the world's greatest architects compete to build on the site of the World Trade Centre. 

Dan Cruickshank visits New York to witness the key moments in the public debate and the personal dramas of the candidates as they try to win the commission to build on Ground Zero, but also attempt to meet the nation's high expectations and satisfy the needs of the bereaved who seek a meaningful memorial. The programme features interviews with the two finalists, Daniel Libeskind and Rafael Vignoly.
