I couldn't find Oblige on the pirate bay so I bit the bullet and bought their first (and only) cd from amazon mp3. This is exactly what you would get if you downloaded from amazon mp3

This album is called Expectants:

It has 10 songs and you can see the
 names in the files list.


It is some great deathcore/metalcore or whatever you want to call it.

Please seed, if you have too many torrents seeding cut some of the more popular torrents that can survive without you and help small ones like this to keep torrents diverse....

I am having trouble seeding even though I have uploaded at 4mb/s
