TPB does this every once in awhile, the seeder/leecher numbers are not updated or something. In reality, plenty of people are seeding and currently downloading, so go ahead and download it for yourself as you would normally."

,infocom4ever,2009-09-11T19:48Z,Who cares about collateral damage of the bad ego trip of the name of terrantino and brad on the bill but i would really want to see  the original from 1978.  
,bren72,2009-09-14T07:49Z,"  rosefisted - I agree about the soundtrack. I was surprised that Tarantino didn't use all new stuff for this one since he has called it his ""masterpiece"".   The reason that some scenes don't have subtitles is that whoever made them took the text from the original screenplay and these scenes aren't in it.

  infocom4ever - This is not a remake. The ""original"" you speak of from 1978 has a completely different story line. The name of the movie is ""Quel maledetto treno blindato"" which is Italian for ""The Inglorious Bastards"" "
,Makeswell,2009-09-15T19:19Z,"for me personally the sound quality was intolerable. video seemed okay but I didn't watch the film due to the bad sound quality.

""anything worth doing is worth doing right."" so i'll just watch this later."
,bard777,2009-10-12T16:14Z,"Now I've to download this movie from another torrent. After one whole night of d/l what I get is a movie with 65% non-English speech with just 10 minutes or so subbed. If it were plain action you'd not miss understanding what the f*** they are saying, but when it comes down to drama, that's the whole essence, you gotta understand what the characters are saying. Damn...1.6 Gb of d/l and 980 mb of upload wasted."
,jepjepjuu,2009-10-30T17:55Z,test
,zorome,2009-11-08T13:47Z,English subs only for the first 50mins and only for non english parts. You`ll need another sub if u want to see this!
,pikleking23,2009-11-09T01:59Z,"ok, I downloaded this and it is in MPEG-4 format... and When I play it all I get is a black screen with sounds... 

What's wrong?"

No, it means something along the lines of ""that damned armored train"", but was also called ""The inglorious bastards"" in english"
