Storyline: Nazi occupied France, and a young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus 
witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her 
revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller quickly takes an interest in her and arranges 
an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in 
attendance, the event catches the attention of the "Basterds", a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers 
led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's 
plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of
