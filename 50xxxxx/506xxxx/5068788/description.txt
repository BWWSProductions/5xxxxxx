Your Software Uninstaller

RollBack Rx allows users to safely test software, security updates and more.

If you are unhappy with the installation you can safely uninstall all components with a few mouse clicks. RollBack Rx guarantees 100% bit level recovery - translating to absolute uninstallation of any software quickly and easily.
