Auto-extract file for rare EA Sports game FIFA World Cup '98. Just open the winrar file once and then it will extract the setup files to selected directory and then it will begin the second extract for game files to your first selected directory. No crack or installing or something else needed, running the file is enough. PCs with 1GB RAM or more sometimes get errors for opening the game but the game is running with some more try. Have fun..
