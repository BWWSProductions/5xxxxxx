One problem - the JC Penny pack doesn't seem to wanna install. I haven't tried updating the game yet to version 1.4 (still running 1.0.631) but I will keep you posted."
,jprp83,2009-08-21T21:39Z,Thank you :)
,Kennyer,2009-08-23T14:54Z,Seed pls
,DLFB42,2009-08-24T00:41Z,UPDATE: Still no luck after trying to update. I don't think the JC Penny pack is working in this bundle. :-(
,Sparx10,2009-08-26T17:53Z,The JC Penny pack used to be a free download. But EA took it down. The problems you guys are having are probably why they took it down.

 C:\Documents and Settings\USER_NAME\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Downloads

Or somewhere there abouts. I hope this helps! I can't wait for the new Sims 3 items to make it on here!"
,theala,2009-10-17T16:41Z,Can someone please explain how I put these items into the game please? My sims game was from here so I can't allow it to get on to the internet for the launcher. Thank you if anyone answers. 
,CD07272006,2010-01-22T11:48Z,Thnx for the game
