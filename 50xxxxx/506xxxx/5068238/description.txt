Benny Hill: The Lost Years (1958-1968) [DVDRip (XviD) eng]

Starring: Benny Hill
Rating: Unrated

For fans of British comedy, the name Benny Hill needs no introduction... but what you may not know is that the late Benny Hill has been on our TV screens for a lot longer than you may think.
The Benny Hill Show began its long run on BBC television way back in January 1955, and if you're a fan of this classic entertainer, a new DVD "The Lost Years", became available in August 2005... This DVD features a medley of vintage material from Benny when his cheeky humour established him as one of the UK naughtiest comedians. Filled with a collection of musical send-ups, fractured fairy tales, wacky commercial spoofs and impressions, this collection captures the vast range of one of England's most inspired comics.
