,AAngelraf,2009-09-02T06:03Z,"and then there are the hundreds of reviews written on amazon. Many by vietnam vets. 
Here: http://www.amazon.com/Siege-Firebase-Gloria-Wings-Hauser/product-reviews/630126939X

I have several vietnam vets in my family and I am a veteran of desert storm.

I trust the opinions of those who saw the 'Nam over this goofball."
,paradime1,2009-10-10T13:43Z,I watched this years ago and have looked for it to add to my collection but it was only available on VHS for so long! Thanks AAngelraf! I like it because it totaly lacks any political correctness and i found it entertaining as well! Dont listen to all those blow hards its a good blood and guts movie who cares if its not technicaly accurate!
,iceman333,2010-03-07T03:09Z,"I have NO IDEA what these other guys are talking about when they say ""bad acting"" etc etc... this movie is an awesome Vietnam war movie, right up there with Apocalypse Now in terms of how it vividly tells the f-'d up story of Vietnam. And the quotes from R. Lee Ermey in this one are very memorable and funny :)

My favorite:

""We're gonna fortify this shithole and protect it like it was your daughter's cherry!"""
