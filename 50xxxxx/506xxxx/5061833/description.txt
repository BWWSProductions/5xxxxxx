What does it mean to be an adult? Chicago TV weatherman, Dave Spritz, is unhappy to be divorced, unhappy to be recognized on the street, distracted from the needs of his chubby preteen daughter and his naive teenage son, disconcerted when strangers throw things at him, and convinced he's a failure in the eyes of his father, a successful writer. In response, Dave constantly announces breathless plans to make things better - impractical, unrealistic, juvenile drivel. A job opening in New York, his father's illness, his ex-wife's romance, and his children's problems from growing up too quickly converge on the hapless Dave. Can he step into adulthood?
