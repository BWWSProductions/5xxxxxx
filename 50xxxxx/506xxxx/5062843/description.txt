Yet another Hawes great live date from 1976 at the renown Douglas Beach House at Half Moon Bay in San Fransisco (seen below circa 1958), home to the best jazz for the last 50 years in, well, beach house settings. Just joking here as jazz doesn't have to have the pomp and circumstance of other 'serious' music idioms and bliss can be achieved in meager surroundings like this one if audience reaction is to be taken into account.
