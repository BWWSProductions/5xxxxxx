,BramLovesYou,2010-01-19T00:48Z,It has 7 seeds 0 leech so I'll see if this thing will DL for me. 
,BramLovesYou,2010-01-19T00:48Z,Lol it took 30seconds to DL. I'll see if it actually works now. 
,BramLovesYou,2010-01-19T00:57Z,"3rd Post. Seems to work fine. Compression options suck, but everything else is really nice. But who knows, maybe the serial won't last me. "
