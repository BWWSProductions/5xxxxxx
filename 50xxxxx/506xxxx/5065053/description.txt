This is the very good Russian video with the direct english audio, synced.
I ran it through TMPEG and added subtitles (hard coded in English) In yellow so you can read them easier (subs by PLAZ). Then it was Put through VirtualDub and the saturation was enhanced to make the colors come out allot more. Sharpened a titch and re-encoded in xvid . Key frames every 300 frames (good for fast searching). Full un-corrupt index... Sample included. good watchable quality but not a telecine or telesync.........just a really good quality cam.

Re cap:
better color
more readable English subs (yellow instead of white over the Russian)
Russian video
direct English audio

if you don't think its worth it..... don't down it.
if you can do better.... do it.
just don't bitch.

like the famous line from fantastic 4
"Flame on"
