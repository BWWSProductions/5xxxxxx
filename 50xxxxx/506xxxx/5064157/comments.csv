,Lone_bassist,2009-08-21T23:27Z,no eng audio yet?
,veovisc,2009-08-22T00:54Z,"Not complaining, just curious: why -do- the Russian versions always seem to come out first?  District 9 in English didn't come out until the Russian version had been out for a week or so already.  I don't mind waiting, and I'm grateful I get to download it at all, but whats up with the cultural asymmetry of torrent releases?  "
,necrocide,2009-08-22T02:18Z,fuck off spammer
,jackel1671,2009-08-22T02:56Z,Who the fuck speaks Russian antway? Shit the Russains dont even speak it..........

,adam86-,2009-08-22T08:34Z,"@veovisc - go here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R5_%28bootleg%29 

The name R5 refers to DVD Region 5, which includes the former Soviet Union, the Indian subcontinent, and much of Africa. In an effort to compete with movie piracy in these areas."
,necrocide,2009-08-22T10:49Z,"Hey guys, Just got back from the flicks seeing this movie. Just thought I'd warn ya: It's NOT A NONSTOP ACTION PACKED GOREFEST!!!!!!! 2 thirds of it is dialogue (mostly subtitled german). That being said, it's still well made and a good movie, but it's very slow and lacks momentum. Arrrrrr just thort I'd be enlightenen ye landlubbers.
I was fucking gutted-been waiting for this for ages."
,skyeboy,2009-08-22T12:08Z,"been waiting for this movie for months. frustrated that an eng lang version isn't out yet if anyone has a link to one ,please ,please post it. ta"

,n8schicht,2009-08-22T17:09Z,"The audio should be english, german, french and italian. If you are waiting for a ""dubbed english version"", then I think you will be waiting 4ever  ^^"
,fermat.,2009-08-22T18:59Z,"great speed 1 Mb/s, it is a decent cam watchable so far i have seen 

LANGUAGE IS RUSSIAN"
,Widowlicker,2009-08-22T19:47Z,"Boring, boring, boring........................
Endless conversations and sometimes some fast action in a few seconds.
This is not a war movie, but a talkie.
Don't bother this flick unless you are interested in talk, talk, talk............
Of course according to the zionistic Hollywood principle: the Juice are the brave heroes
and the Germans are stupid and burn in hell. What a fucking waste of time."
,haladriel,2009-08-22T21:02Z,"haha nice comment jackal1671 :) 

im really exited to see the english (original) version :D prefer ofc dvdrip or divx :)"
,veovisc,2009-08-22T23:03Z,adam86- Thank you for the revealing information.  I should have assumed it had to do with the region codes.
,khronicana,2009-08-23T00:32Z,extremezone. You should find a different format for your torrents. they fuck up the search. Please find some way to fix this.
