,KrellPower,2009-08-23T18:21Z,tack tack =)
,ektakrome,2009-08-23T20:58Z,i will wait for this gladly. I know it's a good two and a half hours of video to upload.
,elobilo,2009-08-23T22:13Z,"Really good for uploading but it's useless as you have such a slow upload link and it's so big.

I've tried downloading this a couple of time before, but due to the points above I've never completed a download as in the meantime several others became available, with faster upload and *much* smaller files size.

PLEASE, please, can you at least use a little time and compress it to MP4, to make it a truely usefull and worthwhile torrent

Thanks."
,xpito,2009-08-23T22:14Z,"Please seed!
Thanks for this great upload. And it was the hundredth Brazilian victory in the formula 1."
,elobilo,2009-08-23T22:48Z,"For more people to seed, people have to have downloaded it first from the uploader... and 276 people are trying very hard. Have patience, there will be seeder in a couple of days or find an avi version."
,pvdwal1234,2009-08-23T23:37Z,"@ Horsse Yes, Azureus tells me for every race I upload several hundreds finish the download! It just takes time.

I know initial seeding is slow, I can't/won't help it. I'm donating all the bandwidht I've got. Earlier I asked if someone has an alternative to speed this up, but of course nobody answers. Also, I'm superseeding this, maybe some of you should check out what this means...

Generally after about 9 hours tho whole file is uploaded and the number of seerders increases exponentially.

@elobilo No I'm not going to compress the files, as I haven't done this for the past eleven races. If The files are too big or take too much time to download, you should just wait for a couple of hours and watch for a comressed version. I know there will be some.
And... at least I am uploading something...

All in all many thanks for the gratitude you give me for uploading these files for your convenience..."

,dumfan,2009-08-26T13:00Z,@xpito: thank you for ruining my weekend :(
,xpito,2009-08-30T06:51Z,Nobody here watch the news? Whatever...I'm sorry...
,FlyingFrisia,2009-09-03T13:03Z,"Would be nice to have the newest link (to Belgium) already active even before you're ready to upload. If possible, we'd be starting the download, even if we're not around to start when you're ready...
Makes sense?  Bedankt.
Thanks for all the work..."
