Soda Stereo - Dynamo + Rarities + Bootleg (320Kbs) [1992-93]

Soda Stereo was an Argentine rock trio formed in 1982 consisting of guitarist and vocalist Gustavo Cerati, bassist Zeta Bosio and drummer Charly Alberti. The band established what would become the template for many other popular Spanish-speaking pop and rock music groups: clever, often mysterious lyrics, pleasing musical arrangements and an elaborate and glamorous aesthetic image. The band has sold over 7 million copies across Latin America.

Review by Allmusic: "This album was Soda Stereo's most eclectic, most ignored, and most experimental work. It was also by far the least popular and the most pretentious. Just after its release the band changed labels (from Sony to BMG) and this fact conspired against the album's diffusion. Some fans didn't catch up with the band's intention, while others took it as a landmark of pop experimentation. The band used the sampler intensely and set the sound treatment carefully, but without leaving the pop structure. Daniel Melero co-wrote some of the songs and played keyboards, but the strong influence he had over the band was reaching an end. The album contains one of their most beautiful songs, En Remolinos, as well as the hits Primavera Cero and the smooth and delicate Fue."

(*2) Songs of Dynamo that were remixed.
(*3) Very rare bootleg. I reduced some noise and adjusted the volume a bit (RMS normalization) but the original recording of this bootleg was not made by me. I decided to rescue the best of that concert and upload it, because the torrent I got it from sadly has been gone for at least a year. So credit goes to whoever decided to share these particular tracks in the first place. I'm sure fans will appreciate it, for a bootleg it sounds pretty damn good. :)
