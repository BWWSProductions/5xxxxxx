   PLOT (Fin):
   Dokumentin nimi: JIM D: 9/11 - Loukussa kaksoistorneissa

   Dokumentissa kerrotaan ihmisistÃ¤ jotka olivat World Trade Centerin hisseissÃ¤
   kun lentokoneet iskeytyivÃ¤t kaksoistorneihin. Osa pÃ¤Ã¤see kertomaan oman
   tarinansa, toiset eivÃ¤t olleet yhtÃ¤ onnekkaita. Ohjelma sisÃ¤ltÃ¤Ã¤ voimakkaita
   kohtauksia, jotka saattavat olla haitallisia lapsille.

   Kun lataatte nÃ¤itÃ¤ FTVDTn dokumentteja niin muistakaa myÃ¶s jakaa. Ratio olisi
   hyvÃ¤ olla suurempi kuin 1.5. Ei saa olla liian itsekÃ¤s, muuten tÃ¤mÃ¤ homma ei
   toimi.


   PLOT (Eng):
   Document name: Trapped in the Towers: The Elevators of 9/11

   On the morning of September 11, 2001, dozens of elevators in the World Trade
   Center turned into hurtling coffins when two commercial airliners crashed
   into the towers. Most of the hundreds of people who were traveling in the
   buildings' elevators were either killed instantly or made their escape within
   a matter of seconds, but several others were caught on elevators that had
   stopped between floors--trapped, with no way out. In this 9/11 special,
   survivors tell their wrenching stories about the horrors of being trapped in
   the burning towers and their amazing fight to survive. Some of them have never
   before shared the drama of their escape with television viewers. But now,
   against actual footage from the day, re-enactments and vivid graphics, the
   passengers on World Trade Center elevators recount how they were caught in a
   cruel twist of fate and how by luck or by sheer determination they managed
   to cheat death.


   When you downloading these FTVDTs documents, remember seed also. Ratio should
   be bigger than 1.5. Don't be selfish, else this torrent system won't work.
