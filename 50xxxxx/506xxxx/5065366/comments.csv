,deadvirgo,2010-08-31T21:23Z,"To avoid all of those annoying notices from ISPs, use uTorrent, and in preferences (Ctrl+P for Windows) click on BitTorrent. Where it says ""Protocol Encryption"" set outgoing to FORCED and uncheck the box that says ""Allow Incoming Legacy Connections.""

There are other ways to protect yourself, but that's how I do it. It's simple."

,wakazaki,2011-02-24T01:25Z,"This game did not work for me,
This was my 28th game to burn, and the first one that actually failed..
Not sure why,
I burned at 4x speed on a DVD-r..
And after the 2nd player on wii start rollin the dices, an error comes that says that I gotta read the Wii Manual..

So, be careful when using this torrent people :)"
