After The War is an album by Irish blues-rock guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1989 (see 1989 in music). Like Moore's prior album Wild Frontier, this album contains elements of his celtic roots.
The track "Led Clones" with Ozzy Osbourne on lead vocals, pokes fun at bands such as Kingdom Come and Whitesnake who were quite popular at the time and were based on a Led Zeppelin type sound and image. Moore again pays tribute to the memory of his long time friend and colleague Phil Lynott with the song "Blood Of Emeralds".
"After The War" is the last conventional hard rock album by Moore until Dark Days in Paradise (1997); the next album marked a departure into blues.
