,thereaperd,2009-09-04T14:01Z,Sweet.  Thank you for the upload!
,wildwill2002,2009-12-02T23:39Z,These songs are definitely 128KbPS MP3s converted to FLAC. Go get the 320KbPS rips located elsewhere on this site since they are the best quality available for free.
,andyk192,2010-03-14T03:57Z,"@wildwill2002 I don't know if you realize what your talking about at all, but these are NOT ""128KbPS MP3s converted to FLAC"". Go figure out what your talking about first, then post something. Great upload! Thank you!"
,tacopaste,2010-07-18T13:41Z,"Wildwill2002 is right.. These are 128-192kbps .mp3's upsampled to .flac

The quality is lost by the .mp3 so there is no point in downloading this. If you don't believe andy192 and me then look at these songs and compare them with 192kbps .mp3 versions of the songs. The spectrogram analysis looks the same. (The lower cutoff frequency is the most obvious thing to tell between .flac and .mp3.)"

I just checked Starrstrukk with Audiochecker v1.2 and it came back with an analysis of 95% chance of an mpeg."
