This week's show!

Fabio hosts an MC special with Stamina, DRS and Justyce!

It's been a hot minute coming, but this week we have the first of our MC specials. Ya boy Fabio pays tribute to the men behind the mic by welcoming three of the best into the studio!

Stamina, DRS and Justyce rolled through to talk about their influences, the D&B scene and of course to spit some sick rhymes over some hot beats. It's all going off!

No doubt Fabio's also laying down some hot tunes too, with brand new bangers from Fresh, A.I, and a classic from Makoto.
