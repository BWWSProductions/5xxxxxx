Opie and Anthony Worst of XM/Sirius commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56  

Hosted by Club Soda Kenny and featuring many of his O&A antics / songs.
This show was supposed to be hosted by Louie CK who never taped the bumpers
so it also features alot of his show appearances as well.  



I have decided to take my own vacation and not up the 64k Worst of shows. 
I will still up the 128k vbr mp3's which should be up around 3pm est 
except for the odd day here and there when they may be up 6/7 ish.
