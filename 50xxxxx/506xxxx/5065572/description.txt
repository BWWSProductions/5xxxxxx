Dj Orkidea - Metaverse


Orkidea, in real life known as Tapio Hakanen, has been a familiar face to the Finnish trance scene ever since he started hosting illegal raves in Helsinki back in the early 90's. He had his first release in 1999 with the single Unity on Steel Fish Blue Recordings and grew into his innovating, refreshing trance roll ever since. After a long time and a huge amount of massive trance hits it's finally time for his second artist album, released on Andy Moor's AVA Recordingsâ€¦ hell yeah we're excited!
