,ockraz,2010-02-07T14:06Z,"Kate Hayden (Christina Raines) is a young mother who learns she has terminal cancer in her leg and must have it removed or die. She decides she cannot live without her leg and refuses to have it removed. As she is dying, she leaves words of wisdom for her young daughter on a cassette recorder so her daughter wont forget her. Her husband, Sam (Cliff De Young) is a struggling musician who reluctantly supports her decision as he watches her deteriorate day by day. "
,neknonrev2c,2010-06-26T05:15Z,"What makes this movie so extremly rare is that it has never been commerically released. It hasn't been shown on tv since the 1980's. The only way you can get it is to copy it. This is sad because it has always been a favorite of many  people.

,discovery222,2011-09-29T20:33Z,"There are places to watch this movie for ""free"" but it is not worth the trouble. This movie is very special to me and my sister (I won't get into personal deatils) and we FINALLY found a very good source for the movies on DVD, much better quality than online ""fgree options"" asnd it is complete. Anyone interested go to www.sunshinevm.com, you'll be glad that you did! :o)"

,Blueman52,2011-10-06T22:19Z,"Hey folks! Could someone please rip this movie to a *.avi file so that it is less than 1 Gigabyte, pretty please?

I am looking to download this film for an old friend of mine, but here in South Africa my internet is capped at 2GB per month.

Please PM me if you are willing to do so.
Thank you in advance!"
