,Akbar32,2009-09-09T06:07Z,Magniwork is a just a scam but feel free to download and build the thing if you want. It just won't work and can't possibly work.
,psylence101,2009-11-15T11:42Z,So you've tried it have you?
,Cabronbr,2010-01-09T10:03Z,Dont eb so narrow minded Akbar32 i dont mean to insult you but either you are a moron or you work for big oil
,Vyrsace,2011-06-08T05:03Z,"This is not a perpetual motion machine. Magnetic generators are very common practice. They do lose momentum after awhile due to friction, thus non-perpetual. Perpetual Motion machines are extremely ideal sources of energy, but is not the only viable form of energy. A non-perpetual motion magnetic generator only means that you will have to kick start it every so often, though, rarely."
