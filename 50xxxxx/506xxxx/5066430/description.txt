Review
Booze & the Blues is a thoroughly entertaining collection of 22 pre-war blues songs about wine, drinking, whiskey and blues. It's a gimmicky excuse for a collection, but it works, not only because the songs and performances are good, but because the tracks all have a similar spirit. Among the highlights are tracks by Memphis Minnie, Mississippi Sheiks, Robert Hicks, the Memphis Jug Band, Amos Easton, Lucille Bogan, Peetie Wheatstraw and Joshua White. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide
