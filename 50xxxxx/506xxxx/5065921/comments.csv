Do I have to download Win7 separately?

,seb784,2009-08-23T23:24Z,"I cannot get it to activate. 
I had problems with a previous computer, the system info being stored on one disk, caus it was a IDE drive (it's lined up first in boot), and installation on the other. Romoving IDE drive solved it. But this compaq nx8220 laptop will not activate. any Idea?
Txh for upload though. Never have trouble with trusted users :)."

,penix9000,2009-09-22T18:48Z,"Worked on Windows 7 RTM Ultimate x64!

I first used ""Windows 7 Toolkit 1.8"" which has an option to remove all cracks and rearm. (Sorry don't remember where I got it.) Then after I ran this activator and everything worked great."
,penix9000,2009-09-22T18:50Z,"Just to clarify, I used ""Windows 7 Toolkit 1.8"" to remove cracks and rearm because I did NOT use a clean install as stated in the instructions. I had tried several activators previously that all failed."
,ShadowMastr,2009-10-25T20:03Z,"eset flagged this, hopefully a false positive???"
,ShadowMastr,2009-10-26T00:12Z,"just tried it on 64 bit rtm, says it's not compatible with the version I'm running..... which is oem version, 7600.16835.amd64fre.win7.rtm.090713-1255.

I disabled uac and tried running as admin, no go."
