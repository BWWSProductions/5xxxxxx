Hi All,

   This is the firt torrent I've ever uploaded. I noticed that all the emus out there for running atari games on Dreamcast are dead links or are just not solid torrents. So I spent some time learning how to get DCStella working and I've decided to post this for all to download. There are over 700 game included with this emulator and creating the cd for it is pretty painless.

Here are some brief instructions for those of you who do not know much about running emulators on dreamcast.  

1.  I can't prove this, but I've heard that only version 1 dreamcasts will run     emulators, so be aware of that.

2.  You will need a version of Nero to burn this file.  
     
       So once you have Nero, do the following:
    
              1. Extract the contents of the zip file.
              2. Open Nero but close the wizard when it comes up.
              3. Go up to the "recorder" pull down menu and select "burn image".
              4. Find the NRG file that you extracted called "Stella"
              5. Burn it at a low burn rate setting, such as 8x.
              6. The finished CD should play in your Dreamcast provided that you
                 have the correct version of the system.


NOTE: It's not needed for all games, but the button combos are as follows:

Right Triger + Y = reset game
Right Triger + X = Change modes


Well, have fun, and, Please REMEMBER to seed.
