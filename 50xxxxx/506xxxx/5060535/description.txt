Ryan Adams - Rough & Mellow (1994-2009)
A collection of live recordings of unreleased songs by Ryan Adams, of which no demo or studio recordings are available.
I compiled and worked on it in my spare time for a couple of years. A lot of these were only played once, if not I picked the one that sounded best to me, when different recordings were available. Since there are so many great live recordings you can find nearly every song ever played. The last two discs are a collection of Jams & Improvs by The Cardinals.
