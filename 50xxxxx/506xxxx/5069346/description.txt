BatAAr - GETHSEMANE (Self-produced album)
Released: 2009-08-26 (YYYY-MM-DD)

Thank you for downloading this album!

BatAAr finally make their return with their most encompassing and crazy studio achievement yet! 
The fully self-produced work, "GETHSEMANE" contains a world of mystery and aggression. 
Featuring all new tracks such as "TERTIUS BESTIA" and "MORDCENTRAL" which have already been performed live
as well as remakes of old songs like "Lacerate the Ties That Bind" that will certainly shed
a new light on what BatAAr truly is.

It would be highly appreciated if everyone who grabs GETHSEMANE sends it on to anyone they know and help spread the word. 
This beast is massive, it wants to get out of its cage and wreak havoc until nothing can contain it.

P.S. enjoy the Lacerate the Ties That Bind official ringtone included in this package!
