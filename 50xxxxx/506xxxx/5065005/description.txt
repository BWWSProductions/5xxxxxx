This is a complete scan in of the book Thoughts on Art and Life.  It is mostly an English translation of various fragments of Leonardo da Vinci's journals.  Only 303 copies of this book were printed, so I thought it best to buy and scan in one of them.

The torrent consists of a single .zip file containing over two hundred uncompressed TIFF images.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time to convert them into text, even with OCR software.

As far as I know, this book is in the public domain.

UPDATE: You can now download the plain text version of this book from http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/29904

Share and enjoy!
