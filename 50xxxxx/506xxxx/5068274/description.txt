Release Title: Sunshine Cleaning 2009 BRRip H264 AAC-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)
Release Date: 24 August 2009
Release Length: 01:31:18
Storyline: Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) finds herself a single mother attempting to support her son Oscar 
(Jason Spevack) and her unreliable sister Norah (Emily Blunt) while working a mundane job as a maid. Once the head cheerleader in school 
with plenty of prospects, Rose now has little to show for her years, and while she still sees the former lead football player (Steve Zahn), 
it is little more than a despondent affair. When Oscar is expelled from public school, Rose takes a job as a bio-hazard crime-scene cleaner 
to help pay for a private education, and brings Norah on to help in her steadily growing business. As the sisters work to clean up the 
messes left behind by the chaotic lives of others, they must learn to reconcile their own differences and overcome a troubled past if 
they hope to prosper in their newfound venture.From the producers of Little Miss Sunshine comes the charming Sundance hit SUNSHINE CLEANING, 
a spirited comedy-drama starring Amy Adams (DOUBT, ENCHANTED) as single-mom Rose Lorkowski, a plucky ex-cheerleader now cleaning houses and 
having an affair with her high-school sweetheart, Mac (Steve Zahn). When Mac, a police detective, suggests the lucrative job opportunities 
in crime-scene cleanup, Rose enlists her sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), to join her in the gory but ultimately fulfilling business enterprise. 
The sisterly chemistry between Adams and Blunt is impressive and forms the crux of their characters' growth throughout the film: Roses 
optimism--reciting self-affirmations and positive spins on her occupation ("Its a growth industry")--complements Norahs cynical, wickedly 
humorous exterior, which hides her bruised, vulnerable heart. Rounding out this likable cast is Alan Arkin, appearing as Joe, the sisters' 
lovably grumpy father, and Jason Spevack, who plays Roses eight-year-old son, Oscar.
