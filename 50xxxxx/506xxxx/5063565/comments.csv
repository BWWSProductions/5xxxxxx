,contra1,2009-08-21T13:42Z,Unzip with Winzip121! Boring pixelated game.
,rana_g,2009-08-26T18:59Z,YES ITS WORKING FINE WITH WIN ZIP 12
,OstermanA,2009-10-24T08:59Z,"7-zip can extract everything but two .bmp files used in the save game screen. This causes unpredictable behavior when trying to save.

It otherwise works fine, even if it is pathetically linear."
,Furikuran,2010-07-12T11:25Z,"Open it with Winzip 14.5 that you can get from their official website.rnrnIt doesn\'t even require an installation, just open the .exe to run the game in English.rnrnI have only just started it up but it seems to be running perfectly fine.rnrnAlso, for those curious about why darktranslations is down, it has moved to \""sanity ends\"". rnrnThanks for uploading this to such a universal site like pirate bay, I\'m excited to play such a delicious sounding game!"
,acouvis,2010-10-30T03:25Z,"It works, but saving is f*d up.  Basically, if you try to load a save, the game crashes.  So just plan on starting over each time."
,JoshuaD,2011-04-03T01:18Z,To fix the save problem simply erase everything in the save folder.
,b1droid,2011-07-17T08:03Z,"This is my first time, so i just extracted the folder with winzip, now what do i do cuz i tried opening the exe the error pops out and i have this tiny program with like 3 buttons that i cant do anything to..."
,b1droid,2011-07-17T08:04Z,im a noob at this. i extracted the file now wtf do i do? i tried opening the exe a error comes out and i get this retarded program thats like 2 inches wide.
,SelfEx1led,2011-11-01T12:20Z,"I'm not sure if this comment will get through to B1droid or the likes of him/her, but you will NEED to change your UNICODE to Japanese in order for this game to work.

To do this, it is very simple: Go to Control Panel (make you're at Control Panel Home, and not the ""Basic View"") and click on Clocks, Regional Settings.

Then you click on Administrative tab at the top - change the Unicode to Japanese (by default, it will say English).

This will allow all Japanese games to run properly. This does not affect your operating system's languages whatsoever. Everything is run in English with the bonus that you can run most Japanese games too."
