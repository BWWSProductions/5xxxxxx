The String Quartet Tribute to Linkin Park, for the true Linkin Park Fan.

I have only seen one of these CD's in my entire life, and it was given to me by a friend. Since then, I haven't seen anything relating to it, so I thought I'd share it.

Unlike the origional torrent I uploaded, this is in MP3 format (again, I apologize for not doing that in the first place)

I didn't test the music after the conversion, so if you download, and there are problems, please post them as a comment and I will address them as soon as possible.
