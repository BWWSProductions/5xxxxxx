I was already digging the MASHed Potatoes mixtape you refer to, but I was glad to find this early stuff (I think I got it from here)

FWIW, here's the  K. Flay torrent I put up:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5446123/K._Flay_Discography
It contains a reseed of this material, with MP3 tags adjusted, as well as easy access to ""MASHed Potatoes"""
