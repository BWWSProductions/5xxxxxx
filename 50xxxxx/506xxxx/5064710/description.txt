There have been significant developments and advances in the field of power plant engineering,
computer applications on energy audit and management, environmental audit and management, human
development and environment. The authors have been encouraged to write this pioneer book for the
benefit of students of engineering and researchers due to their contribution in power generation covering
the syllabi of conventional power plants i.e., Power Plant Engineering, at the international level in
general as text cum reference book.

This book being pilot project of the authors specially in the area of conventional power plant will
satisfy the engineering scholars as well as researchers in the field of direct energy conversion devices.
In the present book the syllabi enclosed has been covered in the most lucid manner from
power plant point of view to avoid the unnecessary bulkiness and to reduce the cost of the price for
the benefit of our beloved students of engineering in particular and others in general.

We have written this pioneering book on the basis of syllabi in the most lucid and compact
manner for the benefit of the students and the readers.
The authors are greatly indebted to Ch. Sunil Singh, Chairman, SITM Lucknow, Mr. K.C. Mishra
Suptt. Engineer, Saudia Electric Co. Saudi Arabia, for their great encouragement in writing this book.
Without their support and help we would not have been able to accomplish this tough and challenging
work.
In the end the authors will feel obliged for critical and useful suggestions since this pioneer book
covers the syllabi in the most useful area of Mechanical Engineering in particular and is applicable for
all branches of technology and engg. for all major Indian Universities, as well as at international level.
