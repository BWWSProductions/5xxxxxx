It's an Ancient Chinese secret... 

You're gonna love this... I don't do anything. I cut up the podcasts. I've tried to streamline my processes - so other than waiting for the podcast, working, family, etc. this was a no brainer time saver and the QC aint bad. The 22kbps comes from Genesis when the podcast isn't pushed (on rare occassion). An added benefit is the smaller file size so fans, news hounds, alternative media seekers, federal agents and CoIntelPro black ops can download faster world wide. These babies go everywhere. 

Keep tuning in and ENJOY!
