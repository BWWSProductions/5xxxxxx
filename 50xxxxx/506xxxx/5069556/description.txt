The Piper Report, August 25, 2009 
Republic Broadcasting Network
Host: Michael Collins Piper

Topic: Michael discusses the use of Holocaust/Nazi based movies in Hollywood used to dumb down the masses. Piper talks of his experience about his trip to the movie theatre where he watched "Inglourious Basterds" (2009) a movie using handsome gentiles like Brad Pitt to portray Jews hunting Nazis and bashing their heads in with baseball bats. MÃ©lanie Laurent, a gentile, portrays a Jewish woman who is dating a black man. Michael discusses the use of drawing minorities into a sympathetic state of mind regarding Jews.
Michael discusses his perception of the reaction of the sympathetic audience and takes calls.

TT: A never ending assault and dehumanization of Germans and those opposed to Judaic Tyranny. Jewish Hollywood produces a Holocaust/Nazi-related film almost every month of the year so as to keep the Holocaust-Guilt-Complex fresh in the minds of us gullible and naive stupid non-Jews.
