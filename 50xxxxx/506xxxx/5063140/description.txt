Bioshock puts the player in the role of a plane crash survivor named Jack, who must explore the underwater objectivist-dystopian city of Rapture, and survive attacks by the mutated beings and mechanical drones that populate it. The player will have to make meaningful choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture or save them
