ezquared - i am struggling with this one. My Come Away With Me cd is scratched. I had the songs uploaded at 320kbs but when i went to give the music a quick check at least 2 of the tracks were damaged.
Anyway i am on the look out for another cd either off my mates or in charity shops, should'nt cost me more than a EURO.

Sorry Dude....

Keep up the good work  "
,ezquared,2009-08-23T05:06Z,"By the way.

Why MODS delete some of the people comments on your torrents, youre right it does make you look crazy XD"
[V],only1joe,2009-08-23T11:31Z,"ezquared - cant remember what name he had, but he wanted you to google it, which he copied and pasted about 10 times.

He was probably spamming everyone's comments, then got reported, the moderators just delete and ban his account and ip address. Hey presto the comments are gone....and i am in the phyco ward with a lovely white jacket and those eyes ready to pop.

Joe (all better now.....hahaha grrr)"
