I am pretty sure that whoever has the movie rights to this lame, boring, repetitive, derivative soap opera is attempting to use TPB as a free viral advertising source (did they check with their lawyers?) for their upcoming project
And if you are advertising for a company affiliated with the MPAA, make sure to deduct the money from that suck-ass lawsuit meant to hobble a superior distribution service. Ask Johnny Depp and Tim Burton how much time they spend in dvd rental stores. Oh yeah, spammers and ad scum eat rat crotch.
If this comment offends mods, please accept my apology, I am only guessing that this is an advertisement, delete this post, not my account.
Thanks. "

I uploaded these episodes of Dark Shadows for one reason, to share with other people who love this show.  By your choice of words, it seems you are not one of these people.  So what are you doing posting this crap, and why are you even wasting your time to comment on all these torrents? "

Just becuz otto doesn't enjoy DS, doesn't mean others won't. Some of us grew up watching DS and we'll always be fond of it, no matter how boring and cheezy it is."
,Lechesia,2009-09-11T04:50Z,"You're right, this show is cheezy.  I grew up watching it too, and I am still intrigued by it.  I don't care how squeaky their voices are, or how many microphones I see, or how many cameraman's shadows I see, I still love the story plot.  I really wish someone would put the remaining episodes on TPB so we could all have the opportunity to have the entire series.  Never having to miss an episode is the whole reason for this."
