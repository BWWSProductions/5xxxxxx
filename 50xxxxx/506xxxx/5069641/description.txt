Benny Hill had a hard time of it in the eighties and, sad to say, some of it was his own fault. Deciding he was in competition with Kenny Everett, whose Thames series featured the raunchy dance troupe Hot Gossip, Benny took advantage of the supposedly less prudish attitude to small screen smut and introduced his own dance troupe, Hill's Angels. On the face of it, this didn't amount to anything remotely resembling a scandal, but Everett's show was aimed at a teenage market who saw nothing wrong with a bit of bump and grind, whereas Hill's show was aimed at a family audience - everyone from pensioners to prepubescents watched his programmes - and the sudden overegging of the sexual content (documented admirably in Mark Lewisohn's wonderful biography Funny, Peculiar) coincided with the politically correct alternative comedy boom and - perhaps inevitably - a downturn in his own fortunes. Benny tried every trick in the book to make the public love him again - the showgirls' costumes were made more conservative, the 'jiggle count' was slashed, the (lamentable) introduction of a series of trite sketches featuring 'cute' children (Hill's Little Angels - groan), defensive monologues delivered direct to camera at the end of a couple of shows - but the tide had turned against him. By the end of the decade, Hill would be dismissed by Thames, a decision that left him bereft - and dead within three years.
