"The Two Temples" is a Christian workbook consisting of two parts. In the first, the author focuses on what is called "The Body Temple," detailing the relationship between humanity and God in areas such as spiritual growth, who God is, and having a right perception of Him.

The second half of the book deals with "The Spirit Temple" and is a group guide expounding on principles necessary to any successful relationship, such as honesty, practical communication, preference versus conviction, and more. Each chapter has a list of questions and exercises for either the individual or the group to perform, depending on in which setting the book is used.
