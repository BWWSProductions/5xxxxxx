Move with the storm, with the
wind, with the flood. Get
rise up, hold on to the
vibe.Move to the left, to the
right, attraction, rejection
The floor we dance on is the
firmament of our eyes
transcends creator. Yes is the
word to everything, to pain
torture, to war and
destruction. Yes is the word
everything, to liberty, to
sweetness, to peace and
construction. Choose, make up
your mind before after is no
more. Time stops while another
time is coming.The same leads
back to the same
Present is the time including
all times, each second is
eternity as eternity is now
and now, now is forever
