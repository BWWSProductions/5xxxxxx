[T],thegreenfrog,2009-08-26T07:17Z,"In case TPB shuts down or changes beyond recognition, I am looking at puretna dot com and empornium dot us as an alternative. Both of them private but with largish membership, almost 1 million each.

I know that the board called forumophilia dot has a nice selection of hairy. Downside You need a RS or some other similar account to make it work. Boards often have a long list of banned sites, make sure you know what you're doing!

I am called thegreenfrog in all three. How fortunate!"
,fireblade80,2009-08-31T13:50Z,"Great upload as usual, thegreenfrog! I've been waiting for an ISM update for a long time.

Empornium and PureTNA are both good trackers with a wide audience, I post all my porn torrents from TPB on these 2 trackers also.

But why would you think TPB could change dramatically or shut down? God forbid!"
[T],thegreenfrog,2009-08-31T23:09Z,"A TPB sale has been in the news for months now. No one knows what the new owner (if the deal goes through) will do. Some people are ready to clone TPB to another address, keeping most of the torrents available again. Google a search limited to the last month, you'll see. You're going to read many contradictory statements, that is where all the uncertainty comes from.
