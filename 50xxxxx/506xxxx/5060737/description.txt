Amazing piece of classical music by Mexican composer Arturo Marquez. I'm quite obsessed with the first piece, Danzon II. If you want to see it live, watch this video of Gustavo Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra. It's the second piece played, so you may have to wait a little, or forward the video: http://www.ted.com/talks/astonishing_performance_by_a_venezuelan_youth_orchestra_1.html
