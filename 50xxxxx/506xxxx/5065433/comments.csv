People that don't believe we went to the moon have a very bad mental instability. The fucking thing is only 250,000 miles away, idiots. 

No stars? Look up when you're in a store parking lot with lights at night. Now when you look up and see no stars...try not to feel SOOOO STUUUPIIIID, but do realize you were once full of shit and hated by the masses for your ignorance. Buzz did what I would do to shitwits that believe the moon landings were fake.

Mindless stupidity must sometimes be KNOCKED out of the fool in question. lol

Please no devil's advocates. There is zero point to that."

However, given the history of deceit from our government regarding all things, especially in post WWII, it does not surprise me at all that people question the moon landing..."

A better question is, was it worth it and is this where we should be spending federal tax dollars at the moment.  Defense spending has produced more useful technological advances (The internet for example via Arpanet)

Big government. Sharp as a bowling ball and as dumb as soap."

Debate OVER.
Laugh my ass off. People like this voted for Obama."
