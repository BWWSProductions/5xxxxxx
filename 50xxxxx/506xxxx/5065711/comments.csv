I am pretty sure that whoever has the movie rights to this lame, boring, repetitive, derivative soap opera is attempting to use TPB as a free viral advertising source (did they check with their lawyers?) for their upcoming project
And if you are advertising for a company affiliated with the MPAA, make sure to deduct the money from that suck-ass lawsuit meant to hobble a superior distribution service. Ask Johnny Depp and Tim Burton how much time they spend in dvd rental stores. Oh yeah, spammers and ad scum eat rat crotch."
,MissLizaMay,2009-08-23T18:48Z,"Yeah well hmmm... OttoBismark, first of all who are you, and second of all, what leads you to the very strange conclusion that we hold the movie rights and want to spread our property on Pirate Bay?  That's one of the weirdest accusations I've ever heard in my life.  More so that you appeared to have posted it on every DS torrent here.  I wish I had the movie rights, but I sure don't.  Meaning no disrespect to Lechesia, but I sincerely doubt he/she owns them either."

,rgaustin,2010-03-16T03:06Z,Thanks so much!  Been looking for this for a while.  Very much enjoyed the show despite what the reviewers (and the lead actor) have said about the series.
,bryentheartist,2012-05-24T00:12Z,brilliant remake of the classic cult 60s series compared to the crappy cartoon 2012 remake that tim burton did thats for sure
,aliasnooz,2012-07-02T14:44Z,Is this the one with Ben Cross in it? thanks
