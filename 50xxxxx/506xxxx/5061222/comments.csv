,xMule,2009-08-20T11:23Z,"I have started up a little site to offer another way to get some of these great shows. I will be uploading the shows to r@pidsh@re and meg@uplo@d for those who either can't or don't like to use bittorrent.

I am going to start with Neal Boortz and Jerry Doyle's shows and hopefully it will hopefully make them available to more people. Credit goes to nucleartriggerpuller for the recordings.
