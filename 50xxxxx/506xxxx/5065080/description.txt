A State Of Trance Classics Vol.2 - The Full Unmixed Versions.

(Not to be mixed with other Armin van Buuren ASOT series)


Follows up the first edition (ASOT Classics) which was released 2006. Another 36 classics on 4 cdâ€™s in the full unmixed original versions are brought together on this smashing cd. This cd is not only a great addition for every trance-lover but is also ideal for dj-ing. All titles are on the cd and able to be read in the most dark dj-booths. 

Who thought the first edition would have the best classics is wrong as this edition may even be better with some of the biggest tunes ever like â€œâ€Airwaveâ€ Rank 1, Cygnus X â€œOrange Themeâ€, Sascha â€œXpanderâ€ Gouryella â€œWalhalla and Armin van Buuren â€œBurned with Desire.
