Pocket Sailor from Transas Nautic allows users to view Transas charts and navigate using a Pocket PC connected to a GPS. Pocket Sailor is an add on to the Navigator system and allows charts and routes to be downloaded on to a palm top PC. This is the ideal solution for smaller boats where it is not practical to carry a laptop or as a second mobile unit on a larger yacht.

Pocket Sailor has functions that are available within NaviGator, such as Ahead, ERBL, MOB, GOTO, Dead Reckoning and Info.

Along with these, some new functions have been added: GPS Monitoring, GPS detection option, GPS On / Off and an Undo Button.

The Undo feature remembers what you have done in Pocket Sailor, from zooming in, to moving around the charts, and allows a user to go back if a mistake has been made.
