Smarty Uninstaller 2009 Pro

Smarty Uninstaller is a uninstaller with intuitive and easy to use interface that allows you to manage and completely remove WindowsÂ® applications.

At most cases Windows applications are very complicated. They put a large number of traces on your system. Especially, such things as entries in Windows Registry, Program Files and Shortcuts. In general the problem lies in the Uninstaller (simply, an uninstaller is the opposite of an installer. During the uninstall process, uninstaller removes all the components which were installed) that can't properly remove all traces in Windows. Also, some users simply don't use the Uninstaller. They just delete the application's program files from the hard drive. Other traces still stays untouched. Large amount of junk traces will make your PC much slower.
