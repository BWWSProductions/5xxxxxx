Word has been spreading about the genuine quality of NYC singer/songwriter Jessica Larrabee's She Keeps Bees project. We've been telling customers how it has the feeling of early Cat Power but with a perspective, vibe and down-to-earth twang all its own. She has followed up her excellent Minisink Hotel CD with an EP that includes two songs off the album as well as two exclusive new tracks! [SM]
