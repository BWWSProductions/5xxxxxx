Well apparantly you haven't noticed all the Heroes Season 3 requests many of us have left the Holy one on his other torrents. He responded by uploading it as we requested. And we can thank him early because his torrents are always guaranteed to be 100% legitimate. With HR's status, we all kind-of just know it's going to turn out good. As for the many idiots asking why this has only 1 seeder... well that might have something to do with it being a rather new upload. Sometimes it's hard to figure that one out ;)

Respect the Holy one."
,mayhem09,2009-08-22T22:48Z,"Exactly what ""isze"" said..."
