"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)" is a song by MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e from their 1989 album Dr. Feelgood. Released in 1990 as the album's fourth single, it peaked at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Dr. Feelgood is the fifth album by hard rock band MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e, released on September 1, 1989.

The lyrics of "Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)" feature a reference to a previous song by the band, "Too Young to Fall in Love."

Lars Ulrich and Metallica looked to Bob Rock to produce The Black Album, after being impressed with his production work on this album.

Nike SB created a shoe based on the album cover.

Dr. Feelgood topped the Billboard 200 (North America) chart, being the first album MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e had recorded after their quest for sobriety and rehabilitation in 1989. It is widely regarded by music critics and fans as being MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e's strongest and bestselling album.

Dr. Feelgood has sold more than 6 million copies in the U.S. alone, and went Gold in the U.K.. In various interviews, members of MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e stated that it was their most solid album from a musical standpoint, due in no small part to their collective push for sobriety.

The song "Dr. Feelgood" was ranked #15 on VH1 Greatest Hard Rock Songs and #41 on VH1's 100 Greatest '80s Songs.

As of October 14, 2008, the album, minus the opening track "T.N.T. (Terror 'N Tinseltown)" because of length and playability, has become downloadable content for the video game Rock Band.

"Dr. Feelgood" and "Kickstart My Heart" were both nominated for Grammy awards for Best Hard Rock Performance, but lost twice to Living Colour.

To mark the twentieth anniversary of the album MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e is performing the album in its entirety at CrÃ¼e Fest 2.
