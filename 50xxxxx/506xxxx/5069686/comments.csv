*sniff*

you have made me very happy,

Elder scrolls Morrowind is a gem of a game, but i never got to play the expansions.

now having them all on PC...

yay!"
,argonian1,2009-10-07T14:17Z,"Hi, thanks for the torrent. I seem to have difficulties loading the expansions. I followed the install-notes and everything. Morrowind starts without any problems, but I do not know how to start up a game simply playing either the expansions. Anyone know what I might have done wrong?"
[T],eyezin,2009-10-08T00:34Z,You don't play the expansions like normal games. They change the original game making it much bigger than before. You do get main sub plots with each expansion and its all played within the main game. This is because the game is supposed to be as open ended as possible.   
,argonian1,2009-10-08T03:22Z,Many thank's for your answer. I now have a secondary problem as game keeps on freezing up on me. Thinking it might 'cause of Vista.

,adaptnz,2009-12-12T01:16Z,"Thanks for this

@pimd - Try opening the morrowind.ini (configuration file) found in the main folder where u installed the game and scrolll down until u see [Fonts] and check if any of these lines are missing:

[Fonts]
Font 0=magic_cards_regular
Font 1=century_gothic_font_regular
Font 2=daedric_font

Then open data files/fonts and make sure u have all of these:

century_gothic_big.fnt
century_gothic_big_0_Lod_A.tex
century_gothic_font_regular.fnt
century_gothic_font_regular_0_Lod_A.tex
daedric_font.fnt
daedric_font_0_Lod_A.tex
Magic_Cards_Regular.fnt
Magic_Cards_Regular_0_Lod_A.tex

Also if ur getting the SNOWFLAKE error try opening the Tribunal CD in Explorer, right-click Setup.exe, and choose the Run as Administrator option. Then disconnect from the internet, disable any anti-virus, anti-spyware, or firewall software you're using and double-click the file Setup.exe on the Tribunal CD to reinstall Tribunal. Then repeat this process with the Bloodmoon CD.

,tank565,2010-01-02T21:30Z,so when i mount it to the virtual drive and click on AutoRunMorrowind.exe it says would you like to install and i click yes then it does nothing. If i click on setup it says i am missing the file specified. any help?
,sneaky_squirrel,2010-01-08T22:56Z,"Hi, I tried mounting it on 3 drives (Original and 2 expansions), and I installed them. After installing all the mods on a list (All the mods in the recommended list didn't conflict with each other so it can't be them), I run the *.exe file inside the no disk folder and it crashes sending me an error report, I naturally click don't send but, how am I supposed to play?

I deleted it completely from my computer and am downloading it...again, I also had problem with some snowflake file.

This game is so hard to install, plus the instructions don't help. They told me to put a video folder, but the torrent doesn't have it, but when the ISO of Morrowind is installed it has a video folder already.

I'll come back and see if someone answers my question, thanks in advance."
,Conor_Kebab,2010-01-26T22:21Z,@sneaky_squirrel  I have the same problem with the video folder I didnt see one but I saw there was one in the data file. I just wanna play morrowind :( I followed everythin i could in the notes but when i try i just get Font 0 not found in .\Morrowind.ini.
,10soft,2010-02-02T23:17Z,seed plz. cant wait to play... seed plz
,sophievrooij,2010-02-15T08:17Z,"Hai!

What i did to fix the problems:
(vista user)

1. Install morrowind and the expansions follow the install notes. (Not this one yet)

2. After installing go back to the download folder, you'll see 3 image folder (the one's you installed de game with) stand on each folder and press right mousebutten. I use winzip so I extracted the images files (choose option: extract to morrowind, extract to bloodmoon, extract to tribunal.

3. You'll see 3 new folders in the download folder, copy the 3 data files in each folder ( datafiles morrowind, datafiles bloodmoon, datafiles tribunal) Go to the direction where you installed the game. And put the copies there. 

4. Now you have al the datafiles put together and if you have done that right you will not get any error. 

Hope this is usefull and sorry if it's bad english.

Good luck, dutchgirl"

,FreeStuffFTW,2010-03-13T14:23Z,"The install notes say to ""Replace Morrowind.exe in the game directory with the one provided""
I can't find the exe. in the game directory or the file i'ms supposed to replace it with. Can somebody help me out?"
,FreeStuffFTW,2010-03-13T14:48Z,"Disregard my last comment, I figured it out.

Also, for those of you that can't find the video folder you have to copy, here's how you get it:
-Mount the Morrowind ISO file
-Exit the screen it brings up
-Go to ""My Computer""
-Right click and open the Morrowind ""Disc""
-There should be a file named ""Video"", that's what you're looking for
-Copy the ""Video"" file to the Morrowind directory in your program files, and you're done!"
,Blarv,2010-03-20T08:09Z,"Can anyone explain how to do the whole video folder thing to someone whom, let's just say, has no knowledge of what's being talked about whatsoever?"
,Lindane,2010-05-20T06:03Z,"@j-d-uk

,inoksvere,2010-05-25T20:36Z,"@Lindane

Some people are too retarded to try and read the description, or much less likely to actually read the entire title of the torrent. Normally they just see a key word or two then say, ""ZOMG DOWNLOADZ"" and click the torrent to download it, then log on here and whine. :P"
,SidRUS,2010-06-10T20:56Z,"Hi all! First, thanks eyezin for the torrent! =) Secondary, I want to correct install info!
1st- install MORROWIND.iso
2nd- install TRIBUNAL.iso
3rd- install BLOODMOON.iso
(I found, that problem with ""snowflake"" is started if you install bloodmoon before tribunal)
4th- run MWE3B_v1.6.1820_Update.exe from patch folder
(this patch for bloodmoon, so this would patched, if you install bloodmoon latest of other iso)
5th- copy video folder from MORROWIND.iso to folder with game
(Video folder also exist at Data Files folder, but you need copy folder from image to game folder, not to Data Files)
6th- copy Morrowind.exe from NO-CD folder into game folder!
Thats all I did, and game run with no problems or errors!
Thanks again for torrent, enjoy games and good luck to all! =)
Sorry for bad english, Im russian ^_-"
,Dimunsis,2010-06-20T18:11Z,"Okay, I've done as the install notes says (installed the Morrowind.iso, then the Tribunal, Bloodmoon, ran the patch, copied the Video folder, and copied the NO_CD .exe into the Morrowind folder). Yet whenever I go to run Morrowind (via the desktop icon or the .exe from the Program Files folder) it says it encountered a problem and closes. No message on what happened or anything.

A tip I offer, though: PowerISO allows for simultaneous mountings of multiple drives, which made this process very fast when I could have all three .iso files mounted at once. Also this program will allow you to use it for free as long as you like, it will just ask you if you want to register it when you open it.

search for morrowind visual pack in google, it contains high resolution textures for morrowind!! :D"
,anonytr0n,2012-02-09T09:20Z,"I support the claim that MORROWIND CANNOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7.

*Someone prove me wrong.
- Or send me a confirmed working link... pwease =]

I have followed SidRUS's Guide and all similar explanations, including the provided install notes.

1.) Installed 3 games in proper order (after loading their respective ISOs)
2.)Ran the update from the patch folder.
3.)Copied video folder from ISO to Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind
4.)Copied Morrowind.exe from no cd folder.


*After doing all of this I've ran as administrator as well as compatibility mode under Windows Xp SP2 & SP3. Same error message...

These files worked on my previous XP Latitude d620 flawlessly, now I'm using this Latitude d830 with Windows 7 and it installs perfectly, but absolutely will not open past the main auto-play menu. As soon as I hit ""Play"" the error appears and I have no choice but to close it or let windows look for a solution(haha)."

,piratesvsbarbarians,2012-06-14T17:04Z,"Hey guys, I seem to be having a problem with installing the game. Every time I go to install it I get an installshield ikernal error. Does anyone know how to get around this? I've searched around on the internet and I've done what most people have suggested. I run on a Windows 7 Home Premium. I would really like to play this game so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
,something5836,2012-06-22T06:22Z,"The patch is broken. Whenever I try to run it, it tells me that the files don't match. Please help."
,Manterok1,2012-06-29T01:04Z,"Thanks for the upload. I got everything working (and I'm on windows 7 for all those who are claiming it doesn't work). also when you try to drag the cracked file to the game folder and it offers to make a shorcut to the desktop, you can just right click and copy the file and paste it in the game folder. 

anyway, my only problem is getting the game window the right size. When i start the game half of the window is out of screen and half the desktop shows. i'm using a netbook with a maximum 1024x600 resolution. anyone got any ideas how i can fit it to the screen? any help would be appreciated."
