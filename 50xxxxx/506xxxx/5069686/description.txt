The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is an epic, open-ended single-player game
where you create and play any kind of character you can imagine. Be the
noble hero embarking on an epic quest, or an insidious thief rising to
leadership of his guild. Be a malevolent sorcerer developing the ultimate
spell of destruction, or a reverent healer searching for the cure to a
plague. Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes
and evolves in response to your actions. Confront the assassins' guild,
and they take out a contract on you. Impress them, and they try to recruit
you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.

The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal is the first expansion for Bethesda
Softworks' The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. It takes place in the
temple/city of Mournhold, the capital of Morrowind, located in the
larger city of Almalexia. The title refers to the three "Living Gods",
known as the Tribunal. Instead of directly modifying the original game
world, the city of Mournhold is only accessible by teleportation.
While the city of Mournhold appears to be similar to the open-air towns
of the original game.

The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon is the second expansion pack for Bethesda
Softworks' The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Unlike the first expansion
Tribunal, which added a city separate from the world map consisting of
interior cells, Bloodmoon adds a large new island to the original world
map, a cold northern territory named Solstheim. Rather than the Dunmer
(dark elves) that are the indigenous race in the nearby Vvardenfell,
Solstheim is populated largely by the Nord race. This is largely because
the island sits more or less astride the border between Morrowind and
the Nord homeland of Skyrim.
