[V],rambam1776,2010-03-25T07:29Z,"First, and seriously, Thank you very much. This is an excellent collection, and you are to be congratulated and thanked.

Secondly, however, you're killing me with that apostrophe. Include it when it possesses something (the movie's qualities), and omit it when it is simply plural (I've seen many movies). Try this for some fun: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eats,_Shoots_&_Leaves"

,NekoPirate,2010-08-10T05:34Z,"Great download.
s 9/10
v 9/10

VLC plays everything, try using that. Divx doesn't play as many file formats as smoothly."
