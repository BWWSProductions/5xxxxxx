Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas OST [GAME RIP] + Bonus Track - Loading Theme

------------[Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 192Kbps]------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The soundtrack of the computer and video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which is set in 1992 in the fictional U.S. West Coast state of San Andreas, required that the game's radio stations reflect the music tastes of the time and area, in addition to covering current events in the state of San Andreas, and even weather forecasts. Together with several pieces of early-1990s music, the soundtrack also included songs from the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Many of the songs interpolate or sample other songs which feature in this or other GTA titles, such as Ice Cube's "Check Yo Self", which samples "The Message", which was featured in Vice City or "Weekend" which appears in its original form on Paradise FM in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.

Primarily, the player can hear the radio when the protagonist acquires a vehicle. He can also listen to the radio in the audio options menu if not in a car. The station that will be playing when the player gets in is determined by several factors, and players can change it or switch it off as desired. The only vehicles in which the player cannot access the radio are the emergency and police vehicles (which use the Police scanner), tractors, bicycles, forklifts, the Bandito sandrail, and certain boats. Radio stations, or some of the songs featured on them, can also be heard in the background in certain locations, such as bars, clothing stores, clubs, casinos, and safehouse wardrobes. The Xbox and PC versions of the game allow the player to create their own custom radio stations with user imported tracks. However, unlike previous GTA titles, which also offered this feature, San Andreas can place commercials between tracks.

Summary: Radio X is an Alternative and period modern rock radio station hosted by Sage (voiced by Jodie Shawback). Sage is a very self-obsessed woman and self-confessed rebel who seems to always be worked up about something, making her a stereotypical Gen X-er. Sage has a "bleak outlook on life" and her most apparent obsessions are the sound of her own voice, along with sex as she admits to have slept with the entire Danzig line-up, along with a man she "did behind the Cluckin' Bell", and pleads "could somebody please have sex with me!" during the outro to Soundgarden's "Rusty Cage", amongst at least two other references. Sage has strong dislike towards people over the age of 29, believes in reincarnation and admits to having huffed paint and ether. Sage reacts negatively to the in-game events barring the Los Santos riots, and gets excited when the forecast predicts rain.

Radio X picks up a couple of callers, however these "two" callers are both voiced by Jeff Berlin who voices and produces the Radio X imaging. The name itself is a possible reference on Generation X, who came of age and were the main listeners of the genre in the early 90s.

Summary: San Fierro Underground Radio, abbreviated as SF-UR, is a San Fierro-based house music station hosted by Hans Oberlander (voiced by Lloyd Floyd). Oberlander is a very insecure and hyperactive man with a comical German accent. On a number of occasions he begs the public to hug him and even cries on a song intro. One of two callers is Hans' father who orders him to play some "Wagner", and Oberlander possibly does drugs as his father continues to say "your mother found these pills in your room". Oberlander also inquires if his dealer has shown up yet in another song break. This station was never released on a music album, so none of these songs, barring "Break 4 Love", were released on the soundtrack. The song Weekend of The Tod Terry Project has a remix version in Vice City Stories soundtrack.
