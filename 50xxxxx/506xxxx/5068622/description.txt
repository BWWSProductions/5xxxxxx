Imperialism 2 VERY RARE 



about the game

In 1492, an Italian sailed west under the flag of Spain in an attempt to find a new sea route to Asia. After undergoing numerous hardships and near tragedies, he returned to Europe with gold, spices and tales of a new world. In Imperialism II, that's the easy part. Imp II is a 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) that covers the Age of Exploration (1492-1600). Your job is to lead a great power of Europe through this difficult period and hopefully to dominance in the old world. Imperialism II is a well-designed, solid performer that makes a fun play and an interesting challenge, and the creators deserve kudos for a job well done.

Just unrar, mount the image and install the Imperialism 2 and start having fun, it's worth it!
