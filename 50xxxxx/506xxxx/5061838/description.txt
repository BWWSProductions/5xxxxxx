Game Notes

Wolfenstein brings the Nazi's dark obsession with the occult to life with
epic action and harrowing shooter combat. Use a powerful arsenal of both
definitive and occult-enhanced Axis & Allied weapons to beat back a
supernatural Nazi force that is full of surprises. You play as BJ Blazkowicz,
a highly decorated member of the Office of Secret Actions (OSA). You are sent
on a special mission into the heart of the Reich to investigate evidence that
the Nazis may possess a new and mysterious power. While behind enemy lines,
you discover the Nazis have done much more than develop a new toy. The Nazis
are harnessing the power of the Black Sun through a dark parallel dimension
called The Veil, in order to create a weapon of war-ending mass destruction.
You are the only one that can stop them and save the world from their
perverse domination.
