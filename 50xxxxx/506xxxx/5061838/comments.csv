,classicsatch,2009-08-23T05:43Z,"I downloaded Razor's torrent from http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/126768153/wolfenstein?tab=summary

I got all of it but it came through without RAR's(uncompressed). It is simply 74 rzr-wft, a NFO, and 1 SFV file. How the hell do I install this thing? And yes, I'm a noob at torrenting. "

,andyballs,2009-08-27T01:59Z,"this shit doesn't work!!! i'm running a dell xpsm1530 with 4 gigs of ram and all the good stuff, and it keeps going to the blue screen of death in the  middle of the instalation!!! anybody got a clue why?"
,funkyDL,2009-08-27T20:16Z,"works perfect for me.

dont know what ur problem is andy..."
,andyballs,2009-08-27T22:18Z,apologies apologies... something must've went wrong with the extraction... maybe is wuz cuz i used an old version of winrar? it would get to different points in the instalation and then blue screen... so DOWNLOADERS BEWARE: YOU SHOULD GET THE LATEST VERSION OF WINRAR BEFORE TRYING TO EXTRACT THESE FILES. and the latest is on here.  other than that i gotta say great job!
,furnaps,2009-09-02T13:23Z,"When I try to install the game I get an error:

""1628: Failed to complete installation""

Anyone have this problem?

Also I have 1 single large Winrar file that I mounted using Poweriso because If I tried to extract it first It would not extract an iso but just folders. "
,keith321,2009-09-03T17:28Z,"The download files aren't Winrar archives. They all have the same size, same name, and the file extension of 001,002,003... Ect. Help!"
,funkyDL,2009-09-04T21:46Z,"great game. kill the natzis!!

,keith321,2009-09-07T18:32Z,"@xmohjeex

I did read the instructions and the first page of commments, asshole.

I'm talking about the other ones there is about 30 more files that have a file extension of 002,003,004. 

What do I do with those? Why does it include so many if I only need that one?"
,Grans93,2009-09-19T12:15Z,"When i press ""play single player"" everything seems to be ok, but after 2-3 second it pops up a box that says ""please insert the correct disc?? w00t!? can any1 help me out 


Thanks ;)"
,RivieraDude,2009-09-29T02:13Z,"keith321 , .001,.002,.003 and so on ARE indeed usually Rar files. 
Not all Rar archives starts with .rar but .001 is also a common Rar archive ending and even if it is in another format WinRar usually works with them too.
Simply right click on the the first file (in this case .001) and choose 'open with' then you choose WinRar and tick the box so it always open the files with that ending in WinRar."
