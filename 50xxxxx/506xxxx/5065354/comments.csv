Although I do wish he had not abandoned his belief in intelligent design(Creator God basically). That was foolhardy and impulsive IMO. I find his own personal condition could be a possible motivation for that disbelief, but who can tell in a man that hasn't had movement for decades.

Still many physicists have a belief in intelligent design now. So...athiests...go fuck yourselfs.
I get so tired of hearing them. An athiest can no better prove the NON-existance of a Creator God than can they prove their own love for their families...or perhaps a better example but perhaps not as poignant athiest cannot DISprove of God's existance. 

For them to think there is abosulutely no possibility and all was a ""happy accident"" is the epitome of blind arrogance.

Hey Crawling_Chaos007: Please take your ignorance elsewhere. There is plenty of solid facts in evolution that show that if God had designed all life, then he screwed up EVERY creature in some way or another (like our eyes that are designed with their optic nerves facing the WRONG way with the optic nerves all IN FRONT of the retina, or our vagus nerve that goes several feet past its destination and loops back to within inches of its starting point).

However, everthing makes perfect sense via slow, randomly-changing evolutionary development, including ALL fossils, geological strata timelines, lava from plate tectonics capturing a record of the magnetic poles swapping ends every ~10K-1M years, and on and on and on and on and on and on until EVERY wacky Intelligent Design and Bible story dissolves in a puff of logic.

Try out (PDF or the audiobook) the book by Richard Dawkins called ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which clearly and thoroughly documents the sky-high pile of facts about evolution and debunks ALL Creationist pseudoscience. His book, The God Delusion, will put the rest of the nails in your dogma coffin...

By the way, fewer than 4% of scientists worldwide bother with any religion (and many of them are just hiding their true feelings to avoid losing funding).

There's STILL absolutely NO evidence of an interactive deity from the Big Bang forward to the present. Sorry...

P.S. Prayers DON'T work either, so get up off your knees and go play outside with the other children...

P.P.S. If you insist on telling us (atheists) to go fuck ourselves, please spell it correctly. Thanks.

P.P.P.S. YOU are an atheist too! You disbelieve in over 6,000 Gods and Godesses that were earnestly worshipped throughout recorded history. The rest of us are just smart enough to continue the trend and disbelieve in ONE MORE God than you do."
,summerHereKids,2010-05-03T18:35Z,"And thank you Peterc340 for a couple of nice arguments.

Also check out Sam Harris. This guy knows his bible but uses it to explain why its just a bunch of made-up, mind-controlling crap.
There's a few torrents here on the bay. Just do a search."
,SmegBrains,2010-05-03T22:01Z,"Peterc340, in your fine response you forgot to point out that the favorite religious zealot argument ""you can't prove there ISN'T a God"" used by Crawling_Chaos007 is absolutely pointless and childish.  The burden of proof is on those MAKING the claim to begin with (i.e. those claiming there is a ""God"" as depicted in the Bible despite the total lack of reasonable supporting evidence).  If someone makes a crazy baseless claim it must be proven.  It isn't other people's responsibility to prove it false.  Using Crawling_Chaos007 illogic we should all also start believe in Santa since there is currently no definitive way to prove once and for all that he doesn't really exist.  Yet millions of people all around the world actually do believe he exists (i.e. small children) so therefore he must be real."

"" ... [they] cannot DISprove of God's existance. 

For them to think there is abosulutely no possibility and all was a ""happy accident"" is the epitome of blind arrogance."" 

@Crawling_Chaos007:Not that I really disaggree with what you're saying, or maybe my interpretation of it rather. I feel like a very imporant aspect of the religious theory is being quickly sidestepped from every camp on that side though.

 I dont really care for labelling myself like this, but for the purpose of the discussion I'll consider myself an agnostic. As an agnostic your closing argument is both valid and cleverly put. (The more so considering the medium.) However, if you count yourself a christian f. ex., then you run into trouble trying to use any of this to your advantage. 

The ""presence"" who in many scientists publications seem almost to be given form through ever more complex mathematic formula, never lends weight to any One religion. Only the possibillity of a ""higher design"", ""creator"", ""God"" whatever you want to call it. 

As far as I can tell, without having seen any kind of real poll/survey on this, the sides are pretty much even matched btw. (Within the theoretical scienses community.  (theoretical physics in particular)) 

50% will generate work that allows for a ""higher power"" without lending ear to any actual religion, but still having chosen ""a side"". 

50% will generate work that seemingly flat-out denies the ""intelligent design"" model in any form you may put it. 

With no stated intention towards the religious  not, debate what-so-ever. Although, in all the seeming nay- saying, the simple omission of a stated belief always leaves a door open in the end. For saying, sorry, guess I was wrong."
