Theory? That's a wild conjecture without any supporting evidence. Par for the course for Mr. von Dì±„niken, a scammer and con-man with no scientific education whatsoever. "
[V],nilsm,2009-08-23T22:04Z,"I think the definition of a theory is something one can't prove, but may be possible. 

God (sorry for the blasfemy) created everything in six days, Probable? That theory is less credible..."

I tried everything, and it seems to be just this video that has no sound."

>this program just goes to show how intellectually backward America has become, and how low History Channel will sink to get good ratings.

ROFLMAO! REALLY? AM I REALLY READING THIS? 1st of all: you're saying God and angels and shit aren't ""intelligent life forms""? that's pretty cut and dry. 2nd: intellectually backward? that guy says in the video that he doesnt claim that his ideas are truth, he's just pointing out a bunch of interesting and thought provoking observations about the world around us. All the things he's pointing out are true; there is a bunch of fucked up shit that suggests we got the whole God thing ""intellectually backward."" lol...

>Leave it to the religious wingnuts to have closed minds. 

""Amen""


2012 is gonna be an alien finally actually landing on earth. He's gonna hop out his space ship and point at himself and say, ""my name is God,"" and we're all gonna be like, ""Oooooohh SHIT!!"""

,Croix1979,2010-10-31T22:30Z,I cant belive some people spend their lifes dealing with such bull crap theories. What a complete vaste of time. The fruitcake even deminish the ability and glory of human kind to statisfy his delusions
,cuntsauce,2010-11-01T20:28Z,"This is the truth, all religions are based on this but lies added to control people...."
,vernael,2010-12-10T19:39Z,"truth is obviously shining through the old mental structures of our manipulated minds...
thanks a lot"
,royston51,2011-03-21T02:49Z,"I don't think this comment section is the place to debate the validity of these theories; it is thank the uploader and address the quality,safety, and availability of the upload. There are plenty of other forums on metaphysics and philosophy for those who think they have the answer to the riddles of life. To disparage those who went to a lot of time and trouble to create this interesting program simply because you may not agree is selfish. "
,stratlpgt,2011-05-05T01:37Z,">scientific theories _can_ be proven
The very first thing you learn in ANY field of science, is that NOTHING can be proven true, only false.
Dont try to sounds smart if your not if you are ignorant on the subject.
>deminish the ability and glory of human kind to statisfy his delusions
a. Diminish*
b. WHAT GLORY?! thats freakin hilarious! we are probably the worst invasive species in the world. We're pretty disgusting creatures as far as I'm concerned.

Thanks for the upload, though I might break up the episodes into multiple files just for convenience..."
,KingKongFetus,2011-06-24T21:32Z,"I think it is safe to say that believers in God and skeptics and non believers are all human, are capable of rationality and very uneducated when it comes to alien life and most likely will be fooled as to what they are IF they exist.

My personal belief is that it is probably that they exist but what they are is obscured. Interdimensional beings and gods, aliens,  sacrifices etc. have been recorded since as far back as we have history. It is ignorant to say that we are alone in this world but we do not see these things on a day to day basis. Therefor it is ignorant to say they DO exist.

So, respect others decisions and share knowledge. Speak out of caring and understanding instead of selfishness and pridefulness. Wether you believe in God and aliens or one or the other, we are all pretty small in this world. One day, I think will will see how small."
