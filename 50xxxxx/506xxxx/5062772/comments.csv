,awibod,2009-09-14T23:54Z,Ok I feel like an idiot. Everytime I load it asks for a registration key. Can you please (and this goes for any application install) add step by step directions on what to do. Thanks.
,roby777,2009-09-29T17:27Z,"@awibod Instructions are there for every application in text files. I don't know what else do you need.

@netforced Works fine on XP. Didn't test on Vista. What seems to be the problem?"

,pei_kee,2010-01-21T10:15Z,"Installed on Windows 7. Creator doesn't seem to work. I tried opening the folder for Foxit Creator but all you see are registration and Uninstall. When you paste the link and click Register, it doesn't work."
