Date: Sunday, August 22, 2009
Start And Finish: Clonmel > Killarney
Distance: 196 km (121.78 Miles)

Stage Profile: The race should start steadily when the riders roll out of Clonmel through the west gate on Saturday morning.

The first An Post sprint of the day is at Ardfinnan after 9km.

Racing gets serious after 20km when the peloton reaches the 2nd category climb of The Vee. The ascent of The Vee has a steady gradient but there could be a few casualties on the 7.5km climb before they cross the summit. Then, the fast descent to Lismore where the peloton will have an excellent view of the historic Castle from the other side of the Blackwater River.

The race follows the valley floor to the pretty town of Castletownroche for the second An Post sprint of the day. Then, a challenging 2nd category climb at Musheramore after 133km and the race heads through Millstreet for the first time, before turning left for a loop that will probably shape the outcome of the stage. The race turns onto a quiet narrow road which rises sharply and will see riders reaching for low gears on the 1st category climb of Curragh - a good place to attack before heading back on a fast descent towards Millstreet with 35km to go.

A break could stay clear to fight it out among themselves in the wide finishing straight on Port Road, Killarney.
