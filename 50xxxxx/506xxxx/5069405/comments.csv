,JustBobbi,2009-08-26T08:08Z,"Is it simple, or even possible (for an inexperienced newbie like me lol) to simply add these Eng subs to a file that's already been downloaded?  I already have the DEViSE version w/out the much-needed Eng subs...do I need to DL the entire torrent again???"
[T],movieFOX,2009-08-26T08:57Z,You can download subs and simply add to your player i use vlc and just add subs and watch.
