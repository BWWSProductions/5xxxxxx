 This seris is written and presented by  a Kew Garden trained scientsit , a Dr. Wong, ( very cute and enthusiastic) combining botany, biochmeistry, and ethno-biology to make remedies in our own kitchen from the ""growth"" around us. I guess that is why he uses the catching title ""grow your own drug"" .

There is no legally questionable ""drug"" in this series.

 As a career scientist in that field, the materials presented in this series have a lot of creditability. It is fun and informative for me.

Do not judge a ""book' by its cover or title.

Be curous, the world will be a better place for all of us."
