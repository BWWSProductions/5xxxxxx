[T],stevekasian,2009-09-28T02:47Z,"Well shit, I finally downloaded this thing, thinking it was probably some half-assed mexican piece of crap add-on... AND IT IS!

Boy, was I ever right. Something like 12m/px resolution tiles in this mexican garbage pack. Trust me, you'd be better off downloading old black & white imagry from NASA's TerraSat and compiling it yourself.

This add-on is completely worthless. Well, no... it's not COMPLETELY worthless if all you're planning on doing is flying over Mexico at FL350 and above, and just want to look down and see something that semi-resembles Mexico. But if you're planning on doing any scenic flying below that altitude, you're gonna be far better off with the stock FS9 textures, since ground textures at this low a resolution just tend to make you disoriented and get you lost mor than anything.

Made FOR Mexicans, BY Mexicans. NAFTA - It's a beautiful thing."
