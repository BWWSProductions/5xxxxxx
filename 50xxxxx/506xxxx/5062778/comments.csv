,dio1983,2009-08-27T01:36Z,"@ codyboss1969

as you've seen, i put your videos and hokusbloke's ones together in order to have the entire saga of dune (on videos) . I hope that's ok for you. 

My purpose was to give to french people the opportunity to see this. (The french subtitles were hard to find and were not really good at the beginning : out of sync, 3 srt for 2  avi... etc.). 

Anyway, thank you for your work!"
