Xe-NONE speaks: "We make it at last!!! Our tribute to the music that drives us in 90th, that shook stadiums and clubs and which really united people and forced to believe that words "Peace! Love! Unity! Respect!"- not simply set of letters. It was the era really a dance music! And on this release we meaningly focused attention on a dancing component of our style. We make this to underline all our respect for Euro-dance Era! And now, with feeling of the executed debt, we will continue work over our second album!"
