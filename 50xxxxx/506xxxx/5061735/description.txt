This is a GUI-Browser for the TPB index found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5053827

After i downloaded the TPB index and saw that it was a SQLite database i thought that most of you had no clue how to use this database. Therefore i wrote a small windows application that offers the possibility to search and save torrents.

It should be straightforward, but here's a small guide:

1. Click 'Open Database' and choose the downloaded index (a file named tpb.db). It will be loaded (can take 5 to 10 seconds).

2. Enter your search query and click 'Search'. It can take up to 10 seconds for results to appear in the ListView.

3. Select one entry from the ListView. In the TextBox appears the description.

4. Click on the Button 'Save Torrent...' and the torrent will be saved to the same folder the application is running from.

5. Download and enjoy!

NOTE: .NET Framework is neccessary, but it probably is already installed.
NOTE2: The SQLite3.dll and the search.index have to be in the same folder as TPBBrowser.exe


Please comment on this little app so i can improve it.
