,restige,2009-08-20T03:27Z,This is genius.  But I still think that uploading the actual torrents as files would have been better than stuffing them in an SQL database.
[T],kremit69,2009-08-20T03:41Z,"i like it. stuffing all of TPB torrents in one download would have been real big lol. This way its small, and contains the essentials."
,iRish_Pirate,2009-08-20T05:03Z,"@restige

The .torrent file for that download would have been over 10MB in size, I feel sure. Plus, this allows high compatibility with other programs, and easy search/sort features.

@daniel33

Thank you SO much!"
,daniel33,2009-08-20T11:45Z,"Scrolling over the entire index is not possible at the moment but i will implement it in case i'm doing a second version.

Right now the app is scanning the search.index which only contains id and title and then gets the additional data torrent by torrent. This is not useful for > 500 torrents.
I tried to search the database directly but this takes more than 10 minutes for one search because there is no index on the title column."
[V],Mbb15,2009-08-20T12:08Z,Thanks
,isT0rrenT,2009-08-20T16:15Z,"I always get ""The File search.index was not found.

I have search.index, SQLite3.dll and TPBBrowser in the same folder, called browser in D:/U-Trrent/Finished/TPBBrowser/"
,isT0rrenT,2009-08-20T17:17Z,"Worked, thanks. I still dont know how to set up the Code, you know, like tbdev but that isn't any sql file.."
,daniel33,2009-08-20T17:31Z,"isT0rrenT: you can convert the db file to sql with SQLite Browser: http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net

however dont ask me how exactly to convert it cause i didn't try myself, besides i don't think that you can use that with tbdev.net because it probably uses other table structures"

Thank you very much! 

I am downloading the full ""Anonymous' "" 21.3 GiB torrent, but I don't think I would know how to use it... Now you gave us the light and is teaching us how to use it.

I'll start downloading your torrent now and I'll seed it forever!

Best regards

Do you have NET Framework installed?

That might be the problem"
,vlayco33,2009-11-27T01:41Z,"Thanks for this!

Hope you'll soon resolve the issue with over 500 torr results.

Also you could do something with 'sort by' option
Name, size, type. 
It's a litlle messy like this

otherwise, fine app!"
