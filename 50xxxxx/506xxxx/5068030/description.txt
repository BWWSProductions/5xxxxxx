Ferry Corsten - Twice In A Blue Moon


Ferry Corsten is a producer of trance music, in addition to being a DJ and remixer. He is currently ranked number 6 in a poll by British publication DJ Magazine. He also hosts his own weekly radio show, Corsten's Countdown. He routinely plays at events all over the world with crowds in excess of tens of thousands.

Twice In A Blue Moon is a new step in Ferry's sound and a new style transition from his last album L.E.F.. L.E.F. is more of a protest against Trance music due to its predictability, thus resulting in a more Electronic sounding Album. Regarding the design of the album, Ferry's trademark 'F' logo was used to make the album stand out and to fit the style of the music featured on the album. This also makes it easily recognizable to fans, old and new.
