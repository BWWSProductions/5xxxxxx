Does anyone know WTF's up with this app? AVRs, Operating amps and so on works great, but capacitors SUCK :@"
,Delfistyaosani,2009-12-16T18:07Z,"What the fuck? This crack simply prevents any analog components from being used, reed-solomon  demo on two ATMEGA128s  works great, but cannot simulate one simple PNP transistor! Unseen evil shit is going on!"
,Delfistyaosani,2009-12-21T20:48Z,"Dear crackers, I think u patched file creation code incorrectly, when opening files created by normally working 7.2 version and add capacitors or transistors everything works well, if create same circuit from a template SPICE will crash, fixing this BUG would be very nice :)"
