,D0gmeat,2009-08-21T22:41Z,"stfu, funky.

Peepz who crap about no seeds are probably  already throttling their ups. Learn about torrents before you diss."

,funkyDL,2009-08-22T15:55Z,"EXTREMEZONE MAYBE U SHOULD WRITE SOMETHING THAT ITS ARABIC ?

CANT UNDERSTAND A SHIT ABOUT THE SETUP PROGRAM!"
,funkyDL,2009-08-22T15:57Z,"Installation:

- Renombrar setup_1.bin y setup_2.bin a setup-1.bin y setup-2.bin
- A mitad de instalacion se quedara bloqueado durante unos 5 minutos, es algo normal, dejadle terminar.
- Al final dara 4 errores por no encontrar unos extras (dx, physx, divx...)
- Arrancar el juego desde la carpeta de instalacion o creando acceso directo.

,TrojanJoe,2009-08-22T22:12Z,"ok Sorted you have to change _ in the title of the Iso's to - 

I installed the other shit first the divx and already had physix installed. 

once you change the name run the setup and it should load further than b4. it will stick then you have to wate for 5 min then you get errors just say ok then the shortcut you have on the desktop.....presuming you ticked the second box at the start should work :)

,BloodStainD,2009-08-24T04:53Z,"- Rename to setup_1.bin and setup_2.bin to setup-1.bin setup-2.bin
- Half way though the installation it gets bogged down for about 5 minutes, it's normal, let it finish.
- At the end it gives 4 errors about not finding some extras (dx, physx, divx ...)
- Start the game from the installation folder or by creating a shortcut."
,piraya007,2009-08-24T13:09Z,This shitty game wont save my key bindings.
,BigSniff,2009-08-26T19:13Z,WTF is this shit extremezone? We have to guess our way through install now?

,ThePriestman,2009-08-28T05:55Z,I like how everyone was STILL bitching about the install translations AFTER several people gave a translation
,Lliam,2009-08-28T13:46Z,"well, the deal is, why the fuck would he give out the installation in spanish?  even the process is outlandish, or atleast I think it is, it's sure as hell is not spanish..

I did everything and more, but the game wont save my bindings, and the graphics wont show, it's black.
And i've tried different approches, still the same.
(my comp, is top notch btw)"
,MoviemMRZ,2009-08-29T20:25Z,"I really liked the pistol model. Played 20min, but it was so dark and hard to know where to go. This game feels only half finnished. Too bad. :("
,ClaudiuTTTVenom,2009-08-30T22:09Z,BaaaAAaaAAAaAaAAad game!!! :D
,Lliam,2009-09-03T14:38Z,"hmm

The game seems to work fine anyways,"
,funkyDL,2009-09-05T01:06Z,"extremezone just uploads other ppls torrents and have dont write anything how to install games, etc all h writes is ""his"" links to hes fucking torrentz which is fucking up my search, bitch."
