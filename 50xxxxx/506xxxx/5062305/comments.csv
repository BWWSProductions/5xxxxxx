,Sotaperuna,2009-09-30T13:34Z,"With a little tweaking, most of it is backwards compatible with D&D 3.5e monster manuals, so there you go, should be enough critters."

Support Paizo - They made a great game. "

I gotta get this for like 5 people, I can't afford that damn thing XD"
,Ovada,2009-10-21T19:55Z,"I mean, seriously. I'll buy the hardcover for myself at least."
,aylengyr,2009-11-12T18:31Z,hey! awesome! I've been hoping someone would upload some pathfinder.  I've been way too poor to buy the hardcopy bestiary even though I really need it so cool! Oh and yeah I know I can buy it for cheap but I hate paying for pdf's it's an insanity of mine.
,DarkSorceror,2010-10-04T02:35Z,An OCR'd copy of this would be freaking awesome!
,DarkSorceror,2010-10-06T06:07Z,"OK, I just looked into the Paizo website. For $10, you get a fully searchable, bookmarked PDF that gets updated when new errata comes in. Seriously, it's worth it! They send you an email when the PDF is updated and you don't have to pay any more at all for it!"
,DarkSorceror,2010-10-06T06:10Z,"Oh, I forgot to mention, you also get access to 1 PDF for the whole book and 1 PDF per chapter versions. Seriously, it's $10; even if you have to save up for it, it's DAMNED worth it!"
