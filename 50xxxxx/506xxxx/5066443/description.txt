JDownloader is an open source, platform independent and written completely in Java free tool that automates downloading from one click file hosters such asetc. If you have premium accounts, you can configure JDownloader to use it. If not, JDownloader can also help you to download multiplefiles automatically by reconnecting your Internet connection to change your IP address. Well this only works if you get dynamic IP address and not static ones. There are a lot more such as CAPTCHA recognition, auto extract or join files when it has finished downloading all parts, RAR password brute-force via dictionary list and etc, auto shutdown when finished downloading and etcâ€¦

I was also very excited to learn that the new FlashGot now supports JDownloader! I have FlashGot installed on my Firefox browser and every time when I wanted to download files fromI had to manually run JDownloader and let the clipboard monitor catch the links. But with FlashGot integration, I can just right click on the link and select â€œFlashGot Linkâ€ or â€œFlashGot Selectionâ€ if it is a text.

I wasnâ€™t able to get FlashGot working with JDownloader at first. No matter what I did, JDownloader is always grayed out from the list of supported download managers. Then I downloaded the full version from JDownloaderâ€™s website, extract and ran it, this time I get a confirmation window asking me to install Firefox integration. I am very sure that didnâ€™t come out when I upgraded from 0.6 to 0.7. After clicking OK, you can now select JDownloader from the Download Manager list.
