What is complicated? If you want to keep it simple you use the Setup. If you don't trust in them you download your own Setup from Rarlabs and register it with the provided Keygen. If you don't trust the KG you can use the provided key. If you don't trust this one too, then go to Rarlabs and buy your license and use their Setup. Almost all downloaders have understood it... :-)"

,PowerZer0,2009-08-23T16:30Z,"32 bit works great however, the 64 bit's shell integration is not working...."
[V],NoExcuses,2009-08-23T17:47Z,"@PowerZer0
Did you tried to install it using the Setup downloaded directly from Rarlabs, and see if in this way the shell integration is OK? You can always copy the key later in the install dir, but if it doesn't work with the original setup you should talk with the Rarlabs people."
,snuupy,2009-08-25T23:02Z,"Thanks. 
Worked perfectly.
 For keygen, just put the key into the program files/ winrar folder."
[T],xxThugxx,2009-08-29T13:03Z,shell intigration works fine on the 64 bit version .....
,ezquared,2009-09-01T21:43Z,"I already had the winrar 3.90 x64 trial version, so i just though i just downloaded the RarReg.key and pasted in the directory.

My question is. How do i know if it worked? 

"
,ezquared,2009-09-01T22:45Z,"Forget my previous comment.

This works great thanks NoExcuses, if anyone doesnt know how to verify that the key works just open WinRar and go to help, then go to about WinRar and you see that now says unlimited compnany license where before used to say 40 day trial"
,lp2k9,2009-09-03T00:39Z,THIS CONTAINS A TROJAN DO NOT DOWNLOAD!  
[V],NoExcuses,2009-09-03T15:13Z,"@lp2k9

Excerpt from the desription:

4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:

http://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.

,THEsemajNESS,2009-11-20T06:44Z,"Hm... in the install, it said 30 (or 40, or w/e) day trial, and throughout it kept bitching about me needing to buy a license when the trial period is up...

But, when I was putzing around for a place to put the keygen key, it appeared as if it were already registered to a ""Your User Name - Unlimited Company License""... Does this mean it's registered?"
,ptfobunny,2010-01-06T13:32Z,"got the keygen and key... keygen seems fine other then not liking my current version .key file slapped into the winrar folder cut it tho
