The movie starts in Belgium in the early 1900s. Jeanne (Mary Pickford) is the 10-year-old daughter of Louise (Gertrude Astor). Troubles start when Louise remarries a selfish but rich man named Elton Reeves (Wilfred Lucas). He convinces her to move to America and leave Jeanne behind in Belgium to live with the maid Marie (Helen Raymond). At first Louise refuses to, but eventually gives in and leaves Jeanne in the care of Marie.

Five years pass and Jeanne and Marie bonded. Meanwhile, Louise hated living in America and feels guilty having left her kid behind. She returns to Belgium to reunite with Jeanne, but Marie doesn't want to give her up. When Louise finally arrives, Marie lies to her Jeanne drowned in a river nearby. Louise is devastated and collapses, before returning to America. This results in estranging from Elton.

World War I broke out. Marie fears for Jeanne's safety and brings her to America to live with her mother. After an emotional goodbye, Jeanne sets out for America to find her mother. Along the way she meets two orphan boys and decides to take care of them. When she finally arrives in America, she travels to Louise's big mansion.

Too afraid to tell her she is her daughter, Jeanne applies to serve as her maid. While pretending to be someone else, she gets to learn her mother. However, she has trouble keeping up the lie and wants nothing more but have a reconciliation. Waiting for the right time to tell the truth, Jeanne hopes everything will come to a right end. When guests of the mansion plot to fleece Elton, Jeanne is forced to reveal her true identity to save the day. A happy reunion follows.

This is one of Mary Pickford's least remembered films and that's a shame because it's one of her best. She stars as Jeanne, a poor little rich girl fairly ignored by her mother who abandons her with a housekeeper while she goes off to marry her next husband. Then years later, the mother decides to reclaim her daughter but the housekeeper now of course loves the child as her own and says the girl is dead. Another five years pass and Jeanne, now a teenager, through circumstance ends up working as a maid for her real mother! There are many tender scenes in this movie but lots of comedy too and Mary's washing the floor with scrub brushes tied to her feet and skating is one of her classic screen moments. The whole cast is fine and darling little Jeanne Carpenter as the very young Jeanne will surely charm you and break your heart as the abandoned child.
