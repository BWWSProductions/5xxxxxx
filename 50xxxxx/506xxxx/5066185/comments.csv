I've heard her songs for years. That's one thing, you watch the video and a whole new dimension gets added. I've seen concerts where they just stand there and sing. Not Madonna! Her theatrics made me feel like I'm watching a movie!"

What exact software/hardware was used for this transfer? I'm presuming this transfer wasn't done with an entry level player."
