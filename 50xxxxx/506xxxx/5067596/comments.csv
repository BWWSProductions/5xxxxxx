experiencing tracker problems... am i alone on this???

Same shit here :S Usually have been working just fine, this ep doesnt..

What bitcomet gives in tracker screen:
""Tracker connection error; 10053, Program located on server cutted the connection..""

Trackers with same error:
Http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
udp://tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce
http//eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
udp://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce

Any clues anyone?"
,jparkin1959,2009-08-25T23:38Z,"I'm having tracker issues also, utorrent says offline on all trackers from this site  and eztv but can connect to other site trackers. I enabled DHT and that seems to be working "
,dex33,2009-08-26T18:18Z,Why wont this download for me??? First time I have had problems ... anyone else??
,Mejlurarduinte,2009-08-26T18:46Z,"WTF is wrong with TPB? The tracker does not work, and has not worked for several fucking days now."
,Mejlurarduinte,2009-08-26T18:50Z,"@ jparkin1959:
DHT has nothing to do with it moron..."
,JGA2k,2009-08-26T23:21Z,If you're wondering about the reason for recent problems downloading I can tell you that there were some problems with TPB:s internetsupplier. It was all over the news in Sweden yesterday. Seems to be solved now but it could happen again.
,callme112,2009-08-27T00:29Z,would some 1 like to uppload Year One. would be sooo nice ! Thnx alot ! :D!
,minisemi,2009-08-27T01:30Z,Can't download either. Bittorent finds neither clients or sources.
,frogleyyy,2009-08-27T01:44Z,"yeah same problem here! 
Is it broken for everybody or just for some unluckie people!? And have anybody found out why!!!??"
,djshaggy,2009-08-27T09:08Z,tracker showing offline 
,martinshameti96,2009-08-27T17:39Z,Read this guys: http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-taken-offline-by-swedish-authorities-090824/ . The site is up but the tracker is down. I recommend all of you to read all of the latest articles written on torrentfreak.com these days. Bit torrenting is coming to an end :P
,rebelBodhi,2009-08-28T01:44Z,"the tracker problems are b/c of a swedish raid, again:

but check the next article!

We have, ourselves, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our Internets, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.

The Pirate Bay Returns With Guns Blazing!

Keep some patience and your support and hopefully TPB survives, quit bitchin"
,infocom4ever,2009-08-28T22:06Z,"TPB going legal...I love the though in the best of worlds it willl work but in the chain massacre of revoked files? And shareholder of a trademark worth billions but every user i ready to pay zip, nill or nada? My most affection about  tpb is the lack of rules or the lack of bitching sobs thats always most show his enormous dick by his mighty rules or you cant do this! You must do this! The spirit is always this is my pissing ground and never ever forgett your my guest  in my pityfull pissingground.  Even DC++ carried just that nightmare. Have any some advice to more relaxed filesharing without those manic stuffed up motherfuckick assholes? you actually can live by? I by lord i tryied some and my first reflex whas i wanna kill them on cite."
,3doxiemom,2009-08-29T05:01Z,"okay, I read all the links for TPB being down/up/etc....what's the status? I can't get this to download....waaaahhhh; I WANT TRUE BLOOD!! Thanks to any help..."
,ZoOMBeE,2009-08-30T01:24Z,Why are the True Blood episodes 548MiB instead of the traditional 349MiB for 42min episodes?
,neil_diamond ,2009-08-30T05:20Z,it is because... they...are...indeed 548 Mib ....instead of...349

,xxxIceAgexxx,2009-08-31T01:03Z,"Hello everybody. I'm sure most of you know that this site is gunna be taken down. And we need to do something about this. I mean, i'm not the smartest out there, but isnt there ANYTHING that we can do? This site has provided me with over 100,000 songs! over $5000 dollars of software, and i've been seeding torrents for weeks, and i dont want any of this just to stop. This is the BEST site out there, come on people. lets do something about this. "

,ZoOMBeE,2009-09-01T04:28Z,"Thanks @DaymanAhhhaahh and @MovieMadness101. I've never considered the possibility of existing regular TV show episodes longer then 42', unless they took 2h on TV."
,loglog,2009-09-01T09:50Z,cant wait to see this ep this serial is so awsome
,GaMeer,2009-09-01T11:16Z,"Guys i live in Sweden and they say the site will be down but the owners arent that stupid ;) they have done something so you can download TPB to your computer and download from there like Azureus , im not sure when its out but keep your fingers crossed and the Swedish newspapper also says that somehow they have done  TPB to only 23 GIB , i know its a little confusing but when its out i will post it on the most seeded games and movies THANKS
PS:GREAAT SHOOW"
,weistmeister,2009-09-01T15:38Z,"this site has been down several times but it is always showing up again. In a coupple of months i guess there will be another site or program that are just as good as this one is. cmon sweden, release one now :)"

,VU7,2009-09-27T22:03Z,"Why is this episode only 44 minutes, 8 or so minutes shorter than a regular episode?"
,VU7,2009-09-27T22:08Z,"Most other episodes are about 52 minutes, depending on whether that particular rip contains the 'previously on' and 'credits' segments.

This episode does contain the credits, which makes it a bit longer, since most rips don't.

Why is this episode so much shorter than all the other ones?"
,VU7,2009-09-28T16:00Z,"I did some searching and apparently they just decided to cut 15 minutes from the standard show format for this episode.

Too bad.

Why is the file size almost the same as a regular episode if it's so much shorter than normal?"
