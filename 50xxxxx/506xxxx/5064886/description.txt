In Blue is the third album by Irish band The Corrs, released in 2000. With the release of this album, the Corrs became popular in the United States (see 2000 in music). As well as the UK number one single "Breathless", the album also contained new versions of "Radio" and "At Your Side", both of which had previously appeared on the 1999 MTV Unplugged album. Also included was "Rebel Heart", which was used as the theme for a BBC drama of the same name. "One Night" was used in the film Mad About Mambo. "At Your Side" was featured in the trailer for the film The Holiday. Many other songs from In Blue have been used in television programmes. The recordings were made at Westland Studios and Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin, Ireland, during which Tim Martin was the engineer. "All The Love in the World" features in the film "America's Sweethearts" (2001). Robert John "Mutt" Lange co-wrote three songs from the album.
On Disc 02 - All four acoustic tracks were recorded in the UK while tracks 5 and 6 are songs which were previously unreleased. "Love in the Milky Way" was performed on The Corrs' highly successful talk on corner World Tour. "Haste to the Wedding" & "So Young" is taken from their long-form DVD Live At Landsdowne Road.
