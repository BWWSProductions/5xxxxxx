,Cmama,2009-08-27T06:49Z,"hey drtucker, if you have any more Fred Astaire movie, I would appreciate them.

Love this actor so much."
,drtucker,2009-08-27T20:21Z,I am seeding. But my uTorrent says CONNECTION CLOSED BY PEER for most of the popular trackers including Piratebay. That's why Seeders -0 and Leechers -0. I don't know why some trackers are still working. Any ideas to resolve the issue?
,Cmama,2009-08-28T01:25Z,"NO,  but this has happened before. 
It's no you, it's pirate bay. They must have a glitch again.

I was downing this but was stuck at 52% for over a day.
I am trying this again. Hope I have more luck the second time around.
and like I said if you have anymore, don't be shy and put them here. please thanks :)"
,Cmama,2009-08-28T01:58Z,"I TRIED AGAIN, BUT GOT STUCK AT 52% AGAIN AND STOPPED WORKING.

TRY DELETING THIS ONE AND RE UPLOAD THE MOVIE TO SEE IF THAT ONE WILL WORK.
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE UP."
