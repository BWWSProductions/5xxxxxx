Shay Laren - 89 JPGs | 2000x3000 | 300 DPI | Released - 17/08/2009

These images were shot on Shay's first trip to California to shoot with us and this was also our first day shooting at the Ranch. So, as you can see, to very good things happened on the day. Shay was as green as could be, but her raw beauty insured great images for us. One of my all-time favorites, Shay was spectacular.
