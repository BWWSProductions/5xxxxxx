,LiquidInsanity,2010-04-02T02:31Z,"There is no English subtitles, unless you speak Chinese avoid this piece of shit. The sound blows too."
,sifuevs,2010-05-16T12:39Z,"Ok just to clear up ""LiquidInsanity's"" comment.
There are English subs in the form of an .srt file. If you dont know how to use them then you shouldnt be downloading movies (LiquidInsanity you fuckin noob) plus the video and audio was ripped from the original dvd using GordianKnot. The reason for the sound not being that great is that the film is fucking old (LiquidInsanity you nob). This is the best sound you will get a present from any release of this film!!"
,sifuevs,2010-05-16T12:44Z,"English subs in an .srt file. If you can use it then dont download Liquid Insanity you nob. The sound and video were ripped from the original dvd using GordianKnot. Its an old movie and this is the best sound aviailable for this realease on any dvd you get your hands on, but hey thanks for the comment LiquidInsanity. Maybe you should stick velcro trainers in future!!"
