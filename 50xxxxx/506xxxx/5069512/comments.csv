How do you enable DHT? I'm quite ignorant in these things..."

Apart this, I see on the Forum that they are aware of this and are working on it. It was already happening a few times in the past, looks only that this time it takes a little bit longer to fix it."

Hope they will fix the problem soon :P"

I'm using Azureus/Vuze and there I can see the S/L, so no problem. The problem is only on TPB, where they are always 0/0, but they 'll fix it sooner or later, or at least the new buyers will take care of it. Who knows if I 'll be still here after that..."
