Im sure your only here to download this because you've heard that this is one of the worst movies ever made, and you would be correct.

1.6 on IMDB which is saying something and the picture on the front of the dvd case is clearly ment for a different movie cause i didnt see no zombies even close to that in the film. good luck wasting hours of your life.
