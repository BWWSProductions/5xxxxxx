,gadriam,2009-08-27T08:15Z,Hmm. My tracker speaks of about 3k seeders. TPB must have a broken counter or something. 
,shaden666,2009-08-31T23:58Z,"this has the wrong episode number.it is really this--
 Season 1, Episode 8 ? Aired: 8/25/2009
Duped

Pete goes to Las Vegas with Myka to recover an artifact from a couple of gamblers... unaware that the real Myka is trapped in a mirror at the warehouse. "
,Shasato,2009-09-01T12:16Z,"shaden, you are writing this on all of these episode 9 uploads. yes, episode 8 officially is this one, duped, but everyone on ptb has episode 8 as implosion, so that is the way things will be going from now on."
