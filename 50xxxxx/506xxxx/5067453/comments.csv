Anyone?"
,JimSaint,2009-08-24T08:37Z,"Just DL'd the sample and it's in Russian still.

LAME!"
,neuroxik,2009-08-24T09:23Z,"@JimSaint: Uhm, I don't know if you can distinguish english from Russian, but the language spoken in the sample (which I just downloaded) is english. 

To all others: Audio = English
Quality: Well, it's a TS, for a TS: ~6.5/10 , and for audio, around the same rating too. Very audible atleast."

,con22,2009-09-26T15:03Z,"This movie is mostly in different languages, there are some parts of it that are in english but the rest of it is in french and german.
You just have to guess whats going on, but i think thats just the way the movie is suppost to be.  
My advice is dont bother its a rubbish movie anyway. "
,ithkos,2009-10-31T21:38Z,"bad camera quality, (see a person walking in front of camera) all subtitles missing (=50% of movie) or Russian. Avoid"
