Once converted, I had a beautiful 1280*720 (true 720p) version of this movie. I cannot give credit to the uploader for the final product. The only thing I can do is thank him or her for uploading the file that I used to convert into what I have now.

As to the movie itself...well, seeing Treach in this type of role was..........different. You be the judge."
