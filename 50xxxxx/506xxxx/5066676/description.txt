Humbug is the third album by the British band Arctic Monkeys.

The band started writing songs for the album towards the end of summer 2008, with lead singer Alex Turner suggesting that the inspiration for the first few guitar riffs came while the band were attending the Latitude Festival in Suffolk. Tracks were written through the end of 2008, with recording taking place around the band's touring schedule towards late 2008 and early 2009.

Co-produced by Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, the album was wholly recorded in the United States. Homme-produced tracks recorded in Los Angeles and the Mojave Desert alongside New York recordings produced - as per the second album - by James Ford, who also produced the album The Age of the Understatement by Turner's side-project The Last Shadow Puppets.

Early soundbites of tracks from the album appeared in the band's periodical video diary on
