Y is the is so larger then regular..?
and what's that ""EAC-FLAC-LOG-CUE""?

tahnks in advance"
,samjoew,2009-08-31T19:47Z,"@pemoma. its larger because its ripped from CD without ANY loss in quality. the vast majority of CD rips are done in .mp3 which loses quality no matter what bitrate you encode to.

EAC is the program used to rip this album from CD. 
FLAC is the filetype (instead of .mp3 or .AAC).
LOG is just a small text file to prove that this album was ripped directly from CD.
CUE is another small file which is like a playlist that you add to your media player so it plays like the original album.

hope this helped"
,pemoma,2009-09-05T21:13Z,"thank you very much samjoew.
both the files and the explanation.

just one more thing..
do you know if those file are ok for my iPod?
thanks again"
,samjoew,2009-09-08T00:12Z,"unfortunately these .flac files are not compatible with an iPod. There are media players out there that can play flac files but i presume you have both iPod and iTunes. 

To play these files in iTunes and on your iPod:

1. Download FLAC FrontEnd from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/flac/

2. Drag and drop the album files that you downloaded into white box in flac frontend.

3. Click ""decode"" on the right-hand side. (this will convert the .flac files to .wav)

4. You can then just add these new .wav files into itunes and then you can convert them to whatever you want using itunes inbuilt converting application.

If you still want to enjoy a perfect quality song that can play on your iPod too (but has smaller file size than .wav), then i would advise converting them using Apple Lossless Enconder.

If you have any more problems with what i've written then dont be afraid to ask again. cheers"
,pemoma,2009-09-08T00:18Z,"thanks very much for that again.
:D
that was very helpful..
but I think that's it.

thanks again for the great upload."
,Dan222,2009-10-17T07:01Z,To put these on your ipod download dbpoweramp converter and convert them to apple lossless(.mp4) you'll be able to use ipod/itunes and keep the full quality.
