,LooseMorals,2010-05-14T04:53Z,"What is this?

This is one 1:56 hour long avi. When the series should be 6 episodes!

,LooseMorals,2010-05-14T15:42Z,"WARNING - I've just confirmed this is NOT the whole series as it original aired in 2008.

I presume this is an edited down version for the American market or something, as there is an American TV commercial left in near the beginning; and i'm watching the original of the first episode, they do not match, this one has scenes missing.

The original series is 6x 50 mins episode whereas this is just one 1:56 min avi. Simply does not add up."
