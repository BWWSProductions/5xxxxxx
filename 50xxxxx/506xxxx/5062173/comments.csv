,TymexPyres,2009-08-20T17:42Z,"I have a request you may be able to fill. Do you have the album,or any singles, by the band ' Next Exit'? Or, the band Sweet Madness,whom they were prior. I just recently heard a couple of thier videos, and I like them alot. REminds me kinda of Devo or something. They were outta Seattle scene."
,erikphnx,2009-08-20T22:58Z,"I called work this morning
""I will get in when I get in. I have some new music to listen to and you will just have to wait"""
,JettBlack9,2009-08-21T00:50Z,"the sorros debut album! You Are the Man!
Thanks
Now only IF that 4 Out of 5 Doctors debut would appear in a new torrent."
,JettBlack9,2009-08-21T00:50Z,I meant Sorrows---dang typos
[V],80zforever,2009-08-21T04:30Z,"Tymex, the only song I have from Next Exit is Static Cling which was on a vinyl comp record called Seattle Syndrome Two. I actually bought this in Seattle back in 1984 I guess? A while back I decided to rip it but I noticed it has lots of scratches and skips in multiple places so I forgot about it.

Guys you're all welcome. To the rest, I will delete my account Aug 25. Make sure to grab the stuff or save the tracker before then."
,embarrasseddownloader,2009-08-21T06:22Z,"80zforever, just want to thank you for carrying out this amazing project."
,kastlebay,2009-08-21T12:12Z,"80z, do you think there's a way to UL all your torrents as one - to have a copy of all your stuff for bitarena or the like? that would indeed be the greatest final and seeding could go on, even without the bay."
,Estlin,2009-08-21T22:18Z,Do you have anything else by The Diodes - either their first two LPs or best-of collection?
,erikphnx,2009-08-22T06:25Z,"80zforever --- know this, you may delete your account but your legend is indeed forever -- Long Live 80z!"
,8675309,2009-08-22T12:47Z,Thank you! Do you have The Arrows - Stand Back?

,turcheck,2011-10-22T20:12Z,Any chance of re-posting this torrent?  The link appears to be broken.  I've downloaded and am seeding the rest of the collection.
