,frozenice,2009-09-03T15:59Z,"Hi, I'm  Stokeman's friend from Demonoid and because he is having trouble getting into his account here at Pirate Bay, he has asked me to tell all of you C2C junkies out there that he is moving his operations back to Demonoid. 

Which, unfortunately for you guys/gals that means he won't be posting anymore episodes here.

Frozenice Out ...

,paidfare,2009-09-30T03:42Z,"First I'm happy to hear that Stokeman and all are well and its a technical problem that has caused his absence from PB. 
Unfortunately the big""D"" is also enjoying technical problems and is unavailable. "
