Late, late, yet again! Well, here are another eleven broadcasts of Coast to Coast for you all to Download, SEED, and Enjoy! I hope you all still look forward to these torrents. I haven't seen a peep of any comments from anyone lately. I guess I am looking for a little validation. George Norry made a comment on one of the broadcasts that the numbers for streamlink sign ups for July were impressive. I really do hope that many of you will join to continue to support C2C. You never know, I won't continue to upload forever. I am sure there will be others to take my place though. C2C is worldwide I believe and people crave it like a drug. You need to get that fix. I suppose I shouldn't compare C2C to a drug, but anyway, please continue to download, upload, and seed these torrents. I greatly appreciate it. Until time, destiny, and synchronisity bring us all together again..... Stokeman Out.....
