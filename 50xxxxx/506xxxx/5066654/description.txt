Carlos Santana & Alice Coltrane - Illuminations 
Year: 1974
Label: Sony/Columbia (1998)
Total time: 35:42
Quality: flac + cue

For his third duet album, Carlos Santana performed the works of John Coltrane, paired with Coltrane's widow, harpist/keyboardist Alice Coltrane, on this instrumental album. Side One includes several contemplative, string-filled numbers, while Side Two presents Santana's re-creation of John Coltrane's late free jazz style in "Angel of Sunlight." Columbia Records could not have been pleased at Santana's determined drift into esoteric jazz: Illuminations was the first of the nine Santana-related albums so far released in the U.S. not to go gold. ~ William Ruhlmann, AMG
