I see that you are a new uploader, and that you have uploaded the same film twice. Click your own username, find the first upload and then delete it."

[V],Kuthumi,2009-08-23T18:27Z,"Beartlover, when you are logged in as yourself and open this torrent presentation, you will see a red X in the upper right corner. That is the delete button.
You will find your other torrent by clicking your blue username.
The warning ""can never be uploaded again"" is only relevant for that other torrent with that specific hash number, not this one. You can always upload the same film/rip again by making a new torrent so it gets a new hash number.
Thanks, by the way, good rip!"
