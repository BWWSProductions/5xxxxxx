,webwebster,2011-01-31T03:28Z,"I'm sorry, but who cares about the music videos?  These rips are substandard - 220 or worse.  How about a good, honest to god 320 or FLAC rip of these seminal albums?  And how about a little caveat emptor in the description of the torrent:  like, some mention of the bitrate and the fact that much of the 1.3 gigs in the DL is taken up with music videos?"

Or how about you stop complaining that someone went to the trouble of uploading this collection so you could download and enjoy it. Better yet, how about you go buy the albums so you can support the artist you feel was so wronged by these ""substandard"" rips. 

Or how about you just fuck right along. That works too.


@Tabljet

Thanks for the upload! Awesome collection!"
