,EMist,2009-11-12T17:00Z,Plz Seed!  94%!
,ChillyCrossFoot,2009-12-11T22:44Z,Speeds through the roof until 94%. Then STUCK for 24 hours. No one has it at 100%. This is the weakness of Torrents. So I won't even bother with this. Would have been a great torrent. Had my CDs destroyed under the sun in the car and never bought another set and probably not going to. I hope someone ups this again. Would be nice to hear the tunes again.
