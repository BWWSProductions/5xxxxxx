Synopsis: 
Gustave Legaspier, the greatest artist in nineteenth century Europe, has lost his inspiration and his passion. After years of being surrounded by gorgeous, half-dressed models, he finds he is bored by the sultry pouts, perfect bodies and flawless faces, which are unfortunately accompanied by lackluster, superficial personalities. It takes mysterious and haunting cello music to revive his fading art and the beautiful celist behind it to awaken his dull heart.
