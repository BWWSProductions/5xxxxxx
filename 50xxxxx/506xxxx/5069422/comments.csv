- mods not activating even after hours of gameplay
- red diamond shapes (textures/images not loading)
- cannot move upon starting broken steel
- cannot find Paladin Tristan
- lots more crashes than usual

YOU MUST upgrade to 1.5+ or 1.7. If you already have, CHECK THE VERSION NUMBER of your fallout3.exe file, it might not have upgraded properly EVEN IF YOU INSTALLED THE UPGRADE! This is especially common with 1.0.0.12. You will likely find that all these problems vanish when you finally get this file upgraded."
