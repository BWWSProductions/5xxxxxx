Ghost Ship "Full-Screen Edition"


Finders keepers. Any abandoned ship floating in international waters can be claimed and towed to port by whoever is fortunate enough to find it. Or, in the case of one team of salvage experts, unfortunate enough.

Ghost Ship is a stylish, effects-packed chiller from House on Haunted Hill and Thirteen Ghosts producers Joel Silver, Robert Zemeckis and Gilbert Adler. Salvagers trained for any situation imaginable come face to horrifying face with the unimaginable after boarding a derelict luxury liner.
