From Glasgow rises Twin Atlantic. A mix of guitar, cello, piano, drum and base create their sound and is topped off with strong Glaswegian vocals. Vivarium is a rock album with an edge.

The Opener â€“ Lightspeed â€“ is a melodic rock song; a perfect choice for the albums first single. Itâ€™s polished, incredibly catchy, and professional â€“ ideal for rounding up more fans. It sets the fast pace for the album. After supporting bands like Lostprophets, You Me at Six, Taking Back Sunday and performing at this yearâ€™s Download and Sonisphere festivals, Twin Atlantic have created themselves a large fan base. These fans are wanting to be impressed and this album does just that. Youâ€™re Turning Into John Wayne keeps up the albumâ€™s fast pace â€“ itâ€™s chorus, dominated by strong and powerful guitars, helps build momentum. If the band can keep up the momentum throughout they have real talent. Audience And Audio is a track incredibly similar to Biffy Clyroâ€™s material â€“ but thatâ€™s not a bad thing.

The album overall is a success, but itâ€™s not fantastic. Unfortunately, the momentum is lost in Better Weather, it spoils the quick and lively beat of the other songs and provides a disappointing finish. Singer Sam McTrusty has perfect vocals for the bandâ€™s sound; edgy, not perfect. The album does explain why the band have a continuously growing fan base. Twin Atlantic have produced an album to be proud of â€“ a definite fan pleaser.

However, the album is only eight tracks and itâ€™s a shame because a few more wouldnâ€™t have gone a miss. By the end of the album youâ€™re left wanting more â€“ a clever tactic.
