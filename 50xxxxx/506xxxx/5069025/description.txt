A book unlike anything ever written by a composerâ€”part memoir, part description and explication of the creative processâ€”Hallelujah Junction is an absorbing journey across the musical landscape of America and through the life and times of John Adams, one of today's most admired and performed composers.

Adams traces his musical lineage back to the era of swing bands and to his grand-father's New Hampshire dance hall, where his clarinetist father met his jazz singer mother. He evokes in vivid detail his own musical childhood in New England, with its marching bands and small-town orchestras, and describes his start as a serious composer in college, his cross-country journey to California, and his gradual rise as one of the most important figures in American music.

Hallelujah Junction is not only a deeply personal recollection but also a firsthand encounter with many of the emblematic themes and personalities of contemporary culture. Here you will find incisive and witty commentaries on people ranging from the Beatles, Leonard Bernstein, Duke Ellington, John Cage, Steve Reich, and Frank Zappa to Allen Ginsberg, Chairman Mao, and Richard Nixon. A work of national scope and intimate dÃ©tail, this is a winning, memorable bookâ€” a landmark in American arts and letters.

John Adams was born and raised in New England, and was exposed to both classical and jazz music from an early age. After graduating from Harvard, he moved to San Francisco and has lived in northern California ever since. The composer of richly scored and expressive symphonic works such as Harmonium, Harmonielehre, Shaker Loops, and Naive and Sentimental Music and some of the most controversial and successful operas in recent memory (among them Nixon in China, The Death of Klinghoffer, El Nino, and Doctor Atomic), he has one of the most compelling musical voices of our time.
