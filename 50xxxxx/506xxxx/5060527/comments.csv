,Sunseeker908,2009-08-19T15:44Z,angel40204 - STFU unless you know for sure.  You probably work for Marvel or MPAA anyway

,daMouse,2009-08-19T22:24Z,Too bad I watched the movie on 720p and saw that it wasn't very good...
,Sunseeker908,2009-08-19T22:50Z,"angel40204:  My point is...unless you are sure,  don't post misleading comments.  How could wiser be better if you are speculating in the first place. If you are suspicious, then don't DL it and move on.


"
[T],educu,2009-08-19T22:55Z,"I want to be anonymous, can I ? 	
But I understand your suspicions...
Enjoy the movie !! "
,TheRock Squirel,2009-08-20T22:47Z,Thank you
,Sunseeker908,2009-08-20T23:51Z,"angel40204: you're right, I'm not your boss.... and no matter what I say you'll just flame something back.  So just go climb back in your narrow hole and get a life.

BTW,  I watched it already and its genuine.  So  as I said before, if you don't know, then STFU"
,TheRock Squirel,2009-08-23T23:19Z,"I have downloaded this post and I must say it is top quality....a lot of seeders and leechers and very few thank you's :(
Top quality films are very rare...
Thank you educu"
,w3s_26,2009-08-24T09:34Z,PLEASE SEED PPL!
,cateyesid,2009-08-24T12:29Z,"Download speed is too slow.  Plz help. 

Thx"
,xylolz,2009-08-26T14:44Z,"i hope people stay seeding as im the only one ul.
its not just down to me"
,ElCaza,2009-08-31T02:10Z,Where can I find Spanish subs for this movie?
,Metroidn1f,2009-09-12T04:05Z,How do you burn this?
,patrioticparadox,2009-09-14T05:58Z,"First and most importantly: Thank you educu for uploading, and  WITHOUT using RARs. May your God(s) bless you.
It would be helpful if you could line up the info in your details. Example: either
                   Runtime................: 107 Mins
or
Runtime................:
107 Mins
Also angel40204 is right about samples. I personally don't use them but many people use them to evaluate the very large video before commiting the time and bandwidth
Either way thanks for the 1080p

@angel40204 Thank you for the first comment. Its people like you who care enough to leave a comment that may help steer noobies away from harmful or fake torrents. Thank you.

@Sunseeker908 Thank you for being another flamer detracting from the already low intelligence of the combined internet. angel provided several peices of evidence for why this MAY have been a fake. You just wasted everyone's time. Go fuck yourself."
,patrioticparadox,2009-09-14T06:05Z,"To clarify some above comments:
There are NO Subtitles
To anyone having speed issues, I recommend doing some research to ensure you are using the proper Bittorrent setting on your client. 90% of the time they are not fully correct by default.

also sunshithead908 and anyone new to this. Wiser is ALWAYS better."
,Metroidn1f,2009-09-14T22:22Z,How do you burn this for Blu Ray?
,patrioticparadox,2009-09-14T23:55Z,"Downloaded in less than 12 hrs
Great up 
Thanks again educu"
,p6drakonserw,2009-10-10T04:54Z,"Excellent quality,good movie"
,s2k4,2009-10-10T14:53Z,"can someone pls tell me what program i should use to see 1080p BluRay movies?
its lagging when i watch it with VLC player and the sound is out of sinc when i use Zoom Player.
720p works fine on those prog, but not 1080p.
Please help!"
,Edis0n,2009-10-17T17:51Z,"Thanks.
@s2K4 - VLC is OK for watching 1080, I use it all the time. You might try to stop your torrent client when watching 1080 movies, as both require a large bandwidth."
,Ganddi,2009-11-21T10:40Z,"@Edis0n Do you have any idea why i cannot play DTS sound, my systems reads it and what it happens is starts jumping the sound not allowing me to listen clear u use VLC player too. 
Please any help with DTS sound on VLC. I have compatible DTS system. "
,closetmonsterrr,2009-11-30T01:47Z,"for those who dont have codecs to play bluray or anything else, google something called the Combined Codec Campaign. it contains codecs for everything and works in windows media player. if ur running linux, then it should work with the wmp program such as what ubuntu has.
badass movie and thanks for the rip, now downloading onto my home computer to watch it again on my tv."
,kithylin,2009-12-19T22:16Z,"@ educu: Thanks for releasing this, but just so you know, ""1080p"" movies are supposed to be 1920x1080 to fit natively on 1080p tv's when played with an attached computer. We can still fiddle with stretch/fitting with VLC or MPC but shouldn't have to in the first place :("
,Woopais,2009-12-22T14:18Z,Can u burn this to a dvd and then watch in on a normal xbox 360?
,y0ng,2010-01-01T20:01Z,50 kbps average.
,johny2392,2010-01-01T23:20Z,"@educu, thanks a lot!!

@Sunseeker908, thank you for your clarification against assholes like angel40204.

Both u, @patrioticparadox & @angel40204, go fuck yourself assholes."
,cat0009,2010-02-25T17:41Z,Thanks for this movie educu it's so cool :)
,snairin,2010-03-09T05:28Z,"Hello All,

Please use KMP Player for watching MKV files. VLC gets strcuks in betweeen, while KMP Player dont have any such issue. Lots of features..

Regards

,Herkimer,2010-06-28T00:30Z,"This bitch took me ages to download. I'm gonna seed this muther for a few weeks. 

And why don't all you people just go out and by a Western Digital Media Player. 1080p, HDMI out, optical out, plays all the files, from a ext. HD, no muss, no fuss. Cheap, too. $120 US. I swear by it.

No more codecs and all this bullshit and blah-blah-blah...

Just a suggestion.

Herk."
,VonNegga,2010-08-14T13:53Z,Thanks for this.  The download took 90 minutes total.  I'll seed to 150% and then I'm outski.
,VonNegga,2010-08-23T12:28Z,Great quality.  The movie itself was okay. +1
,3lionsteam,2011-04-10T18:07Z,"RESOLUTiON...........: 1920 x 818 

shouldnt that be:
1920 x 1080 ?

if it was 1080hd."
,dwnldthis,2011-05-01T21:58Z,thank you
