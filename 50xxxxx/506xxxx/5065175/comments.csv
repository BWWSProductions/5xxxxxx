But, anyway, thanks for sharing!"
[T],FaeGiN,2009-09-13T03:51Z,"Thank you for this...should be good.
I would love the original too but, if I wait for 20comments, they might not come so then I will just download this one instead.
You should have just put the original one up and not this one, if you are willing to seed it anyway why wait for comments...?
It's a fact that mosty  people don't even bother to leave a comment to say thanks but that's the way it is!
So if you want to put the original up...I will seed it of course  :)
Thanks."
