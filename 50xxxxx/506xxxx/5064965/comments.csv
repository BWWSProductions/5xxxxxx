,th3bruc3,2009-08-26T19:13Z,I'm sure this works great but I can't seem to open the .nfo file. Any help?
,th3bruc3,2009-08-26T19:18Z,Maybe a CD key
[T],eyezin,2009-08-27T00:06Z,Open it using notepad.

,Pennarin,2009-10-09T08:57Z,Vista's data execution prevention (DEP) technology is preventing the execution of the tricked out final product. Anyone with this particular Homeworld 2 installed on Vista able to? Got a fix?
,xmind0987,2009-10-14T16:32Z,"tried the dep fixes around and it doesnt work:) 

However. disable compability and admin rights when starting the exe worked for me in win 7 64 and 32. I used both the german no cd and english no cd exe from game copyworld.

So basically just turn off compability mode and admin rights it should work. 

You will however get an gpu card error but i ran fine ok'ing those errors. "

,BUGBUSTERs,2011-06-02T04:27Z,"to open the .nfo file open a .txt aka notepad file first and drag the .nfo file on the .txt file window.  The content should appear in the notepad.

downloading, will seed if it works for me."
,BUGBUSTERs,2011-06-03T00:32Z,"Help me out?
i cant figure out what i did wrong

1) I mounted the image the .iso file on to my DAEMON tools
2) I installed the game in auto run
3) I patched the game using HW2_EN_10_11.exe
4)I replaced the HomeWorld2.exe in the original dir with the HomeWorld2.exe provided in the folder.
5)I ran the new HomeWorld2.exe, the screen flashed with black, and then it went back to desktop. no homeworld2 related process in the task manager.

here is the log:

--------------------------------------
i have checked online, with parameters -luatrace and -debug, it still didnt work.

i have tried compatibility mode, no use. 
also my log, comparing to other peoples log, mine is very short. missing this line:
Using ATI Technologies Inc.'s 1.3.3927 WinXP Release MOBILITY RADEON 9000 DDR x86/SSE2 renderer (Suspected driver is atioglxx.dll 6.14.10.3927) 

other are different but with the same format, such as NAVIDA etc  i guess its about graphic card driver, am i missing a driver? this game is made in 2000, i have no problem running other games made in 2000.

what did i do wrong, how can i solve this problem?"
