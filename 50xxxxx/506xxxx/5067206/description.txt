Operation: Doomsday is the debut solo album by hip hop artist Daniel Dumile under his MF DOOM alias, marking Dumile's return to the hip hop scene after KMD's demise. It was released as CD & 2/LP on Fondle 'Em Records in January of 1999, and reissued by Sub Verse Records in 2001 with a slightly altered track listing.[1]

Despite being reissued, the CD went out of print sometime between 2003 and 2004, quickly becoming an expensive collector's item, while the LP stayed in print for much longer.

The album was released on iTunes in May 2007 and widely rereleased on MF Doom's Metal Face Records on October 7, 2008.
