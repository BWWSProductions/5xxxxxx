And now I try to learn how to shrink the files a bit. Like to get them to 1.5g. If any of you know a good program for mac for this let me know."
,the-loft,2009-08-27T22:33Z,"I am no expert but this I what have read on the net: Handbrake seems to be a popular software, see http://handbrake.fr/ . KLAXXON releases rips as .avi files with a constant bitrate of 1100 kbit/s (DivX5, ffmpeg) and 128 kbps MP3. The newest format would be to encode as with x264 and AAC to .mp4 or .mkv files. The .mkv container format also allows to include subtitles/font files as well. Good Luck!"
