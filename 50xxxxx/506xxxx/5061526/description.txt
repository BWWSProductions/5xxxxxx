* The last song wouldnâ€™t rip on my primary pc CD / DVD player (Plextor 716 SA is sensitive to scuffs) so ripped it on laptop using EAC with a TEAC DV-W28E. Listened to the track and all seems fine. No EAC log could be made *



From Wiki:


Europe is a Swedish hard rock band formed in Upplands VÃ¤sby in 1979 under the name Force by vocalist Joey Tempest and guitarist John Norum. Although widely associated with glam metal, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal and hard rock elements. Since its formation, Europe has released eight studio albums, three live albums, three compilations and seven videos.

Europe rose to international fame in the 1980s with its third album The Final Countdown (1986), which became a high commercial success and sold over three million copies in the United States. Europe was one of the most successful rock acts of the 80's and sold over four million albums in the United States alone and over 12 million albums worldwide.[1] The band has achieved two top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (The Final Countdown and Out of This World)[2] and two top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ("The Final Countdown" and "Carrie").[3] From 1986 to 1992 Europe sold over 20 million records worldwide, making them the 4th most successful act from Sweden in history.

Europe went on hiatus in 1992, reunited temporarily for a one-off performance in Stockholm on New Year's Eve 1999 and announced an official reunion in 2003. Since then Europe has released two albums, Start from the Dark and Secret Society. Europe aims to release their eighth album, Last Look at Eden on September 14, 2009.
