The Temple Builder (2006)

Californian artist David Best is pioneering a new kind of art where creative and emotive interaction is integral to his work. He is a unique visionary who has profoundly affected thousands of people. The Temple Builder explores the character and motivations of Best, within the context of his work and devoted crew and family. Focusing mainly on his temples - stunningly beautiful and intricately designed buildings, which are burned in order to salute the dead, The Temple Builder asks the question - is this life or art?
