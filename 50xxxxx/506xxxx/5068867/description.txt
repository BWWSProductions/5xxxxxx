Avial is a Malayali Rock Band formed in 2003. Similar to the popular Kerala cuisine of the same name, the band is a mix of members belonging to different genres of music. The overwhelming response to the video single â€œNada, nada..â€ in the year 2003 gave them the break to step forward as a Malayali rock band. Its success inspired them to form the band and they later released their first full-length album â€œAvial â€“ The Debutâ€ in 2008. The album again was a huge success, and their music was able to reach out to all kinds of crowd. Among the numerous bands in India that follows rock, Avial stands out unique in the fact that it adopts the native language and its cultural elements.
