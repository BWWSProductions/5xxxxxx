I'm stuck near the ending of the game. The puzzle in the attic of the old geezers workshop. I know which buttons the cue to bottom is, but it doesn't work. Is there something i've done wrong, or is there a glitch?
Please answer me. I don't want the game to end this way"

It seemed to install fine but now when I open it I get ""Unable to open CAL or CIF TREE file: Unable to open CAL or CIF TREE file: Unable to open CAL or CIF TREE file: Check the path in your .ini file"" And yes it repeats 3 times like that, any ideas?"
