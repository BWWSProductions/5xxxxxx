This is one of my favorite TV-series
The surround sound is worth mentionig
The quality is nice - both audio and video - It looked nice in my 720p LCD.
I played this in a Intel Pentium pocessor powered system with 256mb ram with klitemegacodecpack and coreavc
It played smoothly with out any problems. But i had some difficulties playing with vlc {vlc sucks with h264}
This is really compressed version you can find for this series anywhere.
This is a LEGENDARY SERIES for both exceptional video and exceptional surround sounds.

[The Audio is more improved than the previous episodes]
.
This is the 9th episode and just the final episode is remaining to complete the series. This will be one of my best uploads. There are so many dvdrips floating around. Mine is definitely better than those due to source being bdrip. The audio is in 5.1 so that everyone can enjoy this show in the way it is meant to be. . And remember - "there are no bad apples here".
