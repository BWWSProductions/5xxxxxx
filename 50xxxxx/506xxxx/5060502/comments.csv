,mbehmazia,2009-08-26T22:25Z,"Had some minor issues however works like a charm. I am A+, Network+, Securty+, MCP, MCDST, MCSA, and MCSE (2003 Server) certified. Not too brag however just to tell you this is one of the best rips of XP out there, unattended, SP3, WMP11, IE8, and very little issues. For whatever my opinion is worht REDAXIUM, as of 8/25/2009, passes all WGA tests. CHEERS!"
,theslayerz,2009-08-27T05:02Z,"@1JEM1, thanks for your reply and i write some info on system.

,Gizm023,2009-08-29T10:44Z,"How i can install this STUPID copy of XP on C partition?
It cannot install because this STUPID instal. copies  files on C and when i must delete the partition and format, PC won't do it."
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-08-29T12:52Z,Lies!  The product key is NOT automatic.  The damn thing stops and prompts me for a product key!  I spent all this time getting ready for this and then I find the whole thing is a lie and it lacks a product key to pass WGA!
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-08-29T12:56Z,"I found a WINNT.SIF with a working key in it, but the installer was ignoring the key there."
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-08-29T14:06Z,"1JEM1 I mentioned the problem and the solution to the other thing.

However, the installer is even worse than I imagined.  It randomly is missing files.  First few times it was ""amoztbuc.sys"" and then it changed to other names like ""asv7ybwl.sys"".

It forces me to skip the file and then upon rebooting, it just refuses to run.

There's a connect to the internet to download new files, but that is broken because it refuses to acknowledge my internet connection."
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-08-29T16:19Z,"It's a normal PC with mid-tower.  I burned it with the program ImgBurn.

My further experience with this: It is a horrible, horrible thing.  Whoever made it, made it as a sick joke.  Just running the setup program once corrupted my copy of Windows XP.  I am glad I did a full hard drive backup before running this."
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-08-29T16:23Z,"I also checked the CD Key that came with it hidden in WINNT.SIF that the installer ignored.

B9YB-Q73J8-RKPMH-M2WFT-P4WQJ

Well I ran a test to see if Microsoft would like it and Microsoft does not like it and says it's bad and it does not pass WGA."
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-08-29T16:36Z,"Copy and paste error for this forum.

Key was
CB9YB-Q73J8-RKPMH-M2WFT-P4WQJ"
,PeedReedTeedPRST,2009-08-29T19:17Z,"Okay it appears the problem was Microsoft all along.  I got the same weird error with another installer that worked fine before for an older Windows XP.

Steps to fix:

1) You get crap like can't find a9necp6x.sys (random names) from the Windows XP setup program.  The install program is just basically making up some stupid file out of nowhere.
2) Stop it from rebooting, go to the folder off C:\ it made with setup files.  Then delete unsupdrv.inf and it'll install just ifne."

thanks PeedReedTeedPRST  for posting the cd key on the forum thats how they get blacklisted by microsoft. really smart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

im glad it works for you now!!!!!!!!!!!"
,dinmemas,2009-08-31T03:17Z,"I wanted to like this one, but...

It just adds too much fluff.  I can work around the UK defaults (keyboard and other regional settings), but I really don't like the extras added to the context menu.  I don't like the addition of TweakUI.  What's UPX doing in the windows directory anyway?  None of that stuff was mentioned in the description.

But most annoying is every time I reboot, the theme reverts back to Luna from classic which I set.  I could delete the theme files, but that's not the cause and I don't feel inclined to track it down.  Also, after installation, there were 36 updates to get and it's still Aug. 2009.

Easier to just go with a less tweaked one I already have that requires only 50 updates or so."
,dinmemas,2009-08-31T18:05Z,"The reboot causing reversion back to Luna theme is something I'm doing.  Haven't tracked it down yet, but I got the same issue with a known clean SP3 disk from 2008.  Sorry about that."

,aphroditea05,2009-11-17T23:32Z,"REDAXIUM,

What happen on your WINDOWS.XP.PRO.CORP.SP3[GENUINE EDITION V2.0]RedaXium ?  I didn't see it under your username link ""http://thepiratebay.org/user/REDAXIUM/""  But I do find the torrent somewhere: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5129369/WINDOWS.XP.PRO.CORP.SP3%5BGENUINE_EDITION_V2.0%5DRedaXium#filelistContainer

Is this the same?  Really, I prefer to get it under you torrent username since it seems to be safer that way.  Would you mind reupload the torrent?  I will help reseed it.  Also, I would like to ask.

1) what is the difference between the genuine and the genuinev2?

2) How do you integrate IE 8 and WMP 11?  Do you use nlite to do it.  I know that you said no nlite was used in the nfo file.  But when I search around, I didn't find a method to do the slipstream with add on patchs/hotfixs/wmv11 without using third party software?  So, I would like to know how do you do this: by command line."
