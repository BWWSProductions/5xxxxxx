This is a great sounding recording from what was the last show of the 1st European Leg of the spectacular 360Âº Tour.
U2 allowed some radio stations to broadcast this show online, via FM and made their own webcase.
Hallam FM is the radio station from where this recording was made.
It sounds great, with a nice balance of band and audience noise.
If only I had a nice video source from this show, than I'd mix it with this audio.
I brought this from U2Torrents (thanks to Dave), so that even more people can have access to a great show, from my favorite band.

Please don't re-encode this to lossy formats (only if needed, for personal use).
I have a dream that some day everybody will share music in lossless formats only.

Please enjoy my first torrent! ;-)
