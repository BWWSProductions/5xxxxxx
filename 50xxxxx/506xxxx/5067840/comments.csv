Since it's my first torrent here, I'd like to hear some feedback."
,miguelca,2009-08-25T21:30Z,"It's so frustrating to share a torrent downloaded by so many and the only comments are mine...
Now I understand why so many people keep things for themselves and don't share on public trackers.
If I had uploaded this on a private tracker like DaD, Mindwarppavilion, TTD or Zomb, by now I had dozens of thank you's and many (positive or negative) comments.
Registration at this site is easy like stealing a lollypop from a baby so it shouldn't be hard to take 5 minutes to appreciate uploader's work.
Sorry for a noob (at TPB) writing this kind of comment.
I just hate ungrateful people.
My parents told me to thank people when they are generous. Is this wrong? Maybe in 2009 it's oldfashioned... so this means I'm completely oldfashioned and will remain so for many years!"
,triton3001,2009-08-26T17:55Z,"You're so right! People should thank the uploaders more often!

Let me thank you then. I attended the second U2 show in Zagreb, 10 days before this one. The set list is pretty much the same and listening to this soooo brought me back there!

I wish there were such high qualiti recording of my show but this is really the next best thing.

Thanks again!"

You are doing it for your own benefit, not mine. Giving like this is selfless, and no thanks are needed to have been of service to us. But keep up the good work, my son. We need all sorts of pirates to rape and plunder and tear the means of production asunder..."
