By far the most successful and enduring progressive rock group ever, Yes
have been navigating the sonic stratosphere for over three decades.
Weathering myriad personnel changes and as many musical trends, their
popularity has stood like granite.

For fans past, present, and future, Rhino proudly presents In A Word: Yes
(1969 - ). With creative input from the band, we've assembled this Herculean
five-CD collection containing over six hours of music from throughout Yes'
career. In A Word charts Yes' musical journey with 55 timeless tracks,
including hits like "Roundabout," "I've Seen All Good People," and "Owner
Of A Lonely Heart," plus rarities and songs from Anderson Bruford
Wakeman Howe.

And since Yes' music and Roger Dean's images have been a classic
combination since the dawn of the '70s, we've commissioned brand-new
cover art from the legendary designer. A full-color, 80-page book contains
oceans of rare photos, plus essays by Yes experts Chris Welch and Bill
Martin, and tributes by noteworthy Yes fans such as Les Claypool of Primus
and Writer-Filmmaker Cameron Crowe.

A monument to rock's outer reaches, In A Word: Yes (1969- ) is the most
definitive Yes retrospective ever produced.
