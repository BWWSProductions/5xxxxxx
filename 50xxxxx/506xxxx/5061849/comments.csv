Available copies is at 1.451. Once we hit 2 it will be no time before its 4 or 6 or 8, as long as you hang on after the fact. Hit me up in-game on character Apokalips and if your still seeding (i can check based on your i.p. address)i will try to set you up a little in-game with stuff or ***** or a guild invite :) :D >-) :P :X"

,xaosaddikt,2009-11-01T02:01Z,if u backup the launcher at a diff location then use WoW fix file in the software itll update to 3.2.2a and then use the launcher to replace real WoW launcher again itll connect fine.. we just updated will be leaving a link to new torrent soon
