INSOMNIA
By Stephen King
Read by Eli Wallach

Ralph Roberts has a bad case of insomnia. But lack of sleep is the least of his worries. Each night he stays awake, Ralph witnesses more and more terrifying activity in his neighborhood. But is any of it real? Ralph isn't sure. All he knows is that the bizarre visions he's been having keep getting more intense, the strange deaths in Derry have just begun, and if he's not hallucinating, everybody in town is in serious trouble.

"So packed with suspense, romance, literary reference, fascinating miscellaneous knowledge, and heart that only Stephen Kind could have written it." --Booklist
