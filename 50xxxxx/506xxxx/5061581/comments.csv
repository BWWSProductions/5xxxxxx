,Mr.Hardstyle,2010-09-05T13:11Z,"Downloaded movie, it finished went to go play and had some problems. Tried divx, didnt play at all, windows media player played but no sound, quick time played but no visuals or audio. What happened?"
,spiegelnder,2010-12-30T09:49Z,"Mr.Hardstyle, try downloading and installing GOM player. It is the best video player around for many people. I play all videos with it.
Get it from here, http://www.gomlab.com/eng/ and enjoy!"
,Photojunkie,2011-03-27T20:09Z,"Mr Hardstyle,
The only ever player you will ever need and what 99% of members here probably use is VLC player, just google it, it comes from video lan ( so you dont get caught out) or if this link works go there;
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
I would go with this before thinking about gom ,player, vlc player is also free and is awesome!
And Im not knocking last comment but just think most of us would rec vlc top you instead. But there are alternatives, just not as good, lol.

,fillyh22,2012-01-11T06:56Z,"Really great quality video, except for me, the sound is incredibly low. Even when played on VLC player - which I've never had any audio troubles with. 
But thanks!"
