Also, how come you don't upload your torrents on the popular documentary forum, MVGroup? That place sorely needs a regular contributor of PBS documentaries. It's a very BBC centric forum. Would love to see PBS being represented. And not just PBS, I also appreciate the CNBC docus you upload. I don't think anybody besides you is uploading CNBC docus on the net. If there are, then I am not aware.

Again, appreciate all your efforts. Cheers!"
