A live in-studio performance by Dolly Parton - 9 to 5.


"9 to 5" is the title of a Grammy-winning, number-one song written and originally performed by Dolly Parton for the 1980 film comedy Nine to Five, starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Parton in her film debut.

The film's title song garnered Parton an Academy Award nomination and four Grammy Award nominations, winning her the awards for "Best Country Song" and "Best Country Vocal Performance, Female". In addition to appearing on the film soundtrack, the song was the centerpiece of Parton's 9 to 5 and Odd Jobs album, released in late 1980. The song was released as a single in November 1980 and reached number one on both the Billboard Country Chart and the Billboard Hot 100 in January and February of 1981, respectively. For a time, the song became something of an anthem for office workers in the U.S., and as recently as 2004 Parton's song ranked number seventy-eight on American Film Institute's "100 years, 100 songs".

The songâ€”and filmâ€”owe their titles to an organization founded in 1973 with the aim of bringing about better treatment for women in the workplace.

Sesame Street made an educational parody of the song performed by the Anything Muppet parody of Parton herself, Polly Darton, called "Counting 1 to 5".

The song is one of the rare Billboard hits with the endurance to hit number one, be replaced by another song at the top spot (Eddie Rabbitt's "I Love A Rainy Night"), and then return to the number one position three weeks later. It is also one of the few Billboard chart songs to feature the clacking of a typewriter. Parton has stated in a number of interviews through the years that when she wrote the song, she devised the clacking typewriter rhythm running her acrylic fingernails back and forth against one another. 

The song is featured in a musical theater adaptation of the film, featuring a book by the film's original writer, Patricia Resnick, and 20 additional songs written by Dolly Parton. 9 to 5 began previews in Los Angeles on September 9, 2008, and is slated to move to Broadway for the 2009 season, with previews scheduled to begin at New York City's Marquis Theatre on March 24, 2009.
