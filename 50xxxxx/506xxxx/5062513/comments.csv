Audio : Italian + English
Subtitles : Italian + English

As a matter of fact, there's a possiblity to delete the Italian voices & subtitles if you just want to keep the English ones : use MKVtoolnix. Install it, load the movie, uncheck what you want to delete (first sound file and first subtitles file), and start muxing. You will get the English version of Full Metal Jacket, which is a little bit lighter :)"
