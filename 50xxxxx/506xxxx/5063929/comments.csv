,Arleer157,2009-08-31T05:01Z,"Great DL rate for only 50 seeders are the time, definately going to let this seed for a week or so to keep that trend going. :]"
,Arleer157,2009-08-31T06:14Z,"Okay, so The Pitt, Point Lookout and Mothership zeta are simple copy-paste data files, but the Broken Steel file only has videos, and Anchorage is 20 .RAR files that are all the same.

And they're useless."
,dougjaxon,2009-09-04T06:30Z,"Yes maybe i should have included the instruction on how to install them, it completely slipped my mind. I am sorry about that. I wish i would have included them so people such as Clueless Arleer157 would know how to use them. The files work perfect."
,YourSevvyBear,2009-09-05T05:48Z,"This looks nice, thanks for the upload.

Course, if I download and it's full of viruses, Im'a be -pissed-

=]"
,dougjaxon,2009-09-05T06:51Z,"@YourSevvyBear

There are no viruses' bro i wouldnt do that. I wouldnt done to me so there is no way i would do it to anybody else. It all works all you have to do for Broken Steel, Mothership Zeta, and Point Lookout is copy the files to the data folder in your fallout 3 directory. The rest just run the Installers. It works on all versions."
,dougjaxon,2009-09-05T06:53Z,I did mess up on the Broken Steel Expansion I am sorry.
,YourSevvyBear,2009-09-06T05:21Z,"Heh, works like a charm.

Thanks ^^"

Move Zeta-main
        Zeta- sounds
        Zeta.esm into the data file

C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Broken Steel

move all the bik files into video folder

C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data\Video
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pitt

Run ""The Pitt.exe""
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Operation Anchorage

Mount sr-fo3oa.bin with Power Iso

Run OperationAnchorage and stop at the Directory part

Change the directory to your fallout 3 folder.

Should be like this:

C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3

and install it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Point Lookout

Drag the files into the data folder like with Zeta.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Activate from the launcher by clicking on Data Files

and Check mark which DLC you want

just download the files i've noted above and not the other ones.

place the files in date folder wich should be:

C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout 3\Data"
,redrave,2009-12-07T18:51Z,"when i click in the boxes next to the mod-name, no cross appears. somehow something went terribly wrong, i guess."
,redrave,2009-12-07T18:52Z,"now there appears a cross, but when i return to the launch menu, the cross diesappears again."
,dougjaxon,2010-01-12T11:51Z,Yeah the cross hairs do that. You have to re-click them evet you play the game. It will work though i have tested them all myself.
,067875369,2010-06-17T22:51Z,yeah Broken Steel doesn't work.
,TheLordEnki,2011-01-06T12:27Z,is there a way to get this to work on a PS3?
