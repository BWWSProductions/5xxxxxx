 VirtualDrive Pro allows users to create Virtual CDs and never have to use physical discs again - plus, run files up to 340 times faster in RAM. VirtualDrive Pro makes it a snap to create custom VCDs with favorite tracks, expansion packs, custom programs, and documentation. Pre-load your virtual drives to run several VCDs simultaneously, swapping them out via hot keys to avoid load times and spin up delays. Your virtual drives will show up as drive letters in Windows Explorer, which views them as physical drives, even though they are not! Play games and run CD/DVD applications without physical discs at 200X speed - plus, the build-in Virtual Hard Drive allows you to run games and applications up to 340 times faster in RAM.

VirtualDrive Pro copies an entire CD or DVD as a compressed disc image file, or virtual CD. The software contains a driver that fools Windows into treating VCDs as physical CDs running in CD-ROM drives. You can create an unlimited number of virtual CDs and DVDs, and configure as many virtual drives as you have available drive letters in Windows Explorer. Itâ€™s possible to run several virtual CDs simultaneously, as long as you the virtual drives to do so (one VCD per virtual drive).
