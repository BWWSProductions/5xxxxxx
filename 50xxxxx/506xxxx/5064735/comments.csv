,djdazza,2009-08-22T13:35Z,everyone has downloaded approx 13 percent to view the file and found out its the ppv rip not the dvdrip then stopped downloading!!
[T],DUQA-TEAM,2009-08-22T14:04Z,"@ djdazza

Its not possible to explain to a blind person the difference between PPV RIP and DVDRIP 
if you can not see the title posted  DVDRIP.

To refresh your mind for example [PPV RIP] it means  Pay.Per.View.
DVDRIP it is DVD source.
thank you for waisting my time. "
,stevie_z,2009-08-22T15:56Z,"It's ""wasting"", not ""waisting"".  "
[T],DUQA-TEAM,2009-08-22T20:41Z,"@ stevie_z

 wasting = wasting

waisting = shit

sometimes you have to hide the bad words and instead use the appropriate language.
this time thanks for wasting my time explaining this to you."
,Tidus11,2009-08-23T01:17Z,Hahaha stevie you just got owned!!! Awesome movie guys!

,oasismiki,2009-08-26T07:41Z,Thanks DUQA...Good quality!!
,Phatfish,2009-08-26T21:29Z,"A - 8,5
V - Well for being a DVDRip is fuckin lousy sorry.
Like a really good TS. Also the aspect ratio is wrong but that is easily fixed though.

I dont think there is any thing better out yet so its good enough for me, thanks for the upload!"
,netfoxx,2009-08-28T06:35Z,Aspect ratio is out. Sound line LH screen and audio hisses and phases like a line. In a word this is Bullshit! Save your band width.
,jlsmetalhead,2009-08-28T20:57Z,Thanks 
,ohrton,2009-09-02T08:24Z,If you play with VLC go to Video>Aspect Ratio 5:4. Though it wont go full width of your WS display because of black bars top and bottom.
,bigporch,2009-10-02T14:44Z,so from the comments i can assume this is not as good as or the same as the top seeded torrent? Because I would love to have this movie in a widescreen format as it was orginally shot. I stream my movies to my 360 set up on my flatscreen in the the living room. Maybe I'm being selfish as this is free...
[M],vicerock,2009-10-07T23:37Z,no dvdrip again 
,araysoloartist,2009-12-12T16:52Z,"the last DUQA Download ie., GI JOE...was TRACKED and received copyright letters...DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS..."
