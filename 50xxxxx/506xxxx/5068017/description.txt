At the request of Mike Dion, TAPS investigates the claims of a man's house is being haunted. He and his brother have a large collection of tapes they have tried to record EVPs on, and they're convinced it's haunted. Also, TAPS travels to Indiana to investigate the Willard Library, Indiana's oldest library, home of over 50 years of claims of seeing a grey lady.
