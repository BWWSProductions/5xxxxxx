,Rashira,2010-02-14T19:12Z,"This works!!!!

imgburn gave errors everytime i tried it.

Tried nero 8 and it worked.

i get a white screen in subspace but i think that is because the external USB burner i used refused to go lower than 3X."
,koko-goal,2010-02-18T20:20Z,"Works.

follow the guide but I think DVD-R DL better than getting DL+R

thank you memibh and thanks for the seeders."

,utery11,2011-12-05T04:51Z,"So how exactly should i go about burning this to a disc?
What type of disc?
What burning software works best?
And do i have to mod anything or do anything different to play this game?"
,utery11,2011-12-06T02:14Z,"Didn't work for me.
I used a DVD+R DL
2.4x write speed and put in that other value, what else do i have to do to make this work?"
