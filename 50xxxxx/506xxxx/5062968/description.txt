In a world where love has grown trivial and weary the Ancient Greek Gods exist to battle this tragedy. The Gods will do whatever it takes to bring soul mates together. Grace Valentine, the Goddess Aphrodite, is the sexy and seductive matron of the family; her son Danny Valentine, or the bow & arrow slinging Eros, is the thrill-seeker of the bunch; Danny's best friend Leo, the muscle man Hercules, is the strong and emotional moral compass of the group; Phoebe Valentine is the Goddess of the Oracle at Delphi, which helps the family track down and help bring soul-mates together; and Kate Providence , a romance-novelist who is recruited as the only mortal, by Grace herself, to help swing the fates in a new direction. "Valentine" looks at love, fate and the work it takes to make romance happen.
