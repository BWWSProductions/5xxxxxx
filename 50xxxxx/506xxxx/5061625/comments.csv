,FearGate,2010-01-02T09:08Z,"I get an error message when attempting to mount with Alcohol 120% ""File not accessible.""  

I do not know why, as I have not made any modifications to the file properties.

As of the moment I discovered that I could not mount the image, I am now unable to seed!!

Will re-download and try again.  probably some connection error"
,FearGate,2010-01-02T09:09Z,"Oh, and demonoid is a members only sharing site that is no longer accepting applications.  To get in, you must receive an invite from a member...  to stay in you should have a 1:1 or better seeding ratio"
,FearGate,2010-01-02T11:05Z,"excuse my earlier post about an error message, as I was extremely drunk.. 

had coffee now and mounted .bin image without .cue image in file directory. fixed the problem.

also found solution to seeding errors and am now powerseeding

works great! thanks"
