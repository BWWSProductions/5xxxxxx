Los Santos Inocentes (1984)
September 30, 1984
'THE HOLY INNOCENTS,' SPANISH PEASANT FAMILY
By JANET MASLIN
Published: September 30, 1984
On a feudal farm in northern Spain, stereotypical images of noble, earthy peasants are made unexpectedly touching in Mario Camus's ''Holy Innocents,'' which focuses on the travails of one peasant family. As gatekeepers to the large country estate of a marchioness and her family in the 1960's, these workers are privy to all the aristocracy's cruelty and callousness. 


Mr. Camus, along with recording the highhandedness with which the peasants are treated, captures both the hardship and the richness that characterize the lives of these workers. He works particularly hard at conveying their closeness to animals, with whom they live in primitive proximity, and to the land.



The film has a section named for each of its chief characters. These are Paco (Alfredo Landa), who has a preternatural talent for helping the young master Ivan (Juan Diego) with his hunting, and who can crawl like a bloodhound to sniff out a dead bird; Azarias (Francisco Rabal), who prefers live birds and trains them lovingly, although his simplemindedness and appalling hygienic habits have made him a pariah; Nieves (Belen Ballesteros), the pretty daughter who hopes to go to the city to seek her education but is recruited as a housemaid, and Quirce (Juan Sanchez), the son who's even more determined to make his escape. Their mother, Regula (Terele Pavez), tends another child, a brain-damaged girl, and holds the family together fiercely. It is she who, when approached by any of the aristocrats, can deliver the most dutiful ''We're here to serve.'' 

''The Holy Innocents'' introduces these people in a gradual and engrossing way, without overly stressing the reprehensible ways they are treated. The film builds its case slowly and carefully and, if anything, it seems less predictable in its later moments than it does at first. One scene shows the marchioness (Mary Carillo) handing out coins to the peasants to commemorate one of her rare visits. This relatively mild episode is given no more emphasis than the sequence in which Master Ivan, who is especially eager to have Paco accompany him on a hunting trip, simply refuses to take the servant's word that his broken leg, which is in a cast, has really incapacitated him. It was on one of Master Ivan's earlier hunting trips that the leg was broken. 

''The Holy Innocents'' is acted in a plain, utterly convincing style, particularly by Mr. Landa, who arouses great compassion. It culminates in a scene that, even in light of the story that has preceded it, comes as a shock.
