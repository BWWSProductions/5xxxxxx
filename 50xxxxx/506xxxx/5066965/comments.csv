1. patched it for use iextreme 1.6 >
2. burned it on a DL disk at 1x
3. then made sure my xbox wasnt connected to live (never can be to safe)
4. then play game, and then it will bring you to a screen to update. 
5. after the update is complete, you play the game expansion with the original game disk "
,sammaful,2009-08-25T15:42Z,as far as i know this is actual release so you shouldnt need to transfer it to hdd as it was mentioned a while ago that they were bringing the expansions out on disk not 100% but think there doing that with the grand theft auto expansions aswel

i put fallout 3 and these expansions on the hdd. less noise from the dvd-drive."
