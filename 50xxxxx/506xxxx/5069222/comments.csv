,GLR457mAn,2009-08-26T20:12Z,"tpb trackers dont work for right now. as of the 8-24-09 tpb got shut down. but there website is back up as you can see but doesnt show how many ppl are seeding.

this torrent is working i have 9 more trackers in the torrent file & is seeding just fine to 40 + ppl.

as far as the game go's be very sure you read the rules in the Nascar racing 2003 online connector.rar in the SMS install .txt
 you can get banned very eazy by the nice folks @ http://openspeedway.net if you brake the rules & hourse around. you can also find the rules there as well."
