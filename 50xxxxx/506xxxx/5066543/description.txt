Release Notes:

Born December 28,1990 Calgary, Alberta Canada At the age of 14, Andrew F began
playing the drums and soon after joined his first band, Thirty Years War. After
picking up the guitar and realizing that he had a natural ability for writing
songs, he began working on his own material. With a need to be centre stage he
became the front man for a few different pop punk bands and found something he
was truly passionate about. The more he played, the deeper his desire became, to
make music his career and to chase his dreams to wherever they might take him.
Continuing to write and perform his own brand of folk/acoustic/pop-punk songs he
found his own consistent sound that was not achieved in any of the bands he was
apart of. Although he wrote most of his songs in his room with an acoustic
guitar he still craved for that bigger sound and found himself picking up the
electric more and more. Once he had written a healthy collection of songs he
began working on some demos at Music Centre Canada Recording Studios with
producer Daron Schofield. Soon the demos transformed into full production
recordings and Andrew found himself in the middle of Recording his debut Album
"Reckless Abandon". From the aggressive guitar hooks and catchy pop/punk vocal
melodies on his lead out single, "The End", to the soulful musings and haunting
guitar lines on the social conscious track, "So Small", you will find "Reckless
Abandon" to be a very diverse album with something for everyone. At the age of
17 he is able to eloquently express his life experience through his
lyrics......you will find a depth beyond his years and a connection with his
honesty.
