,ChazInMT,2009-10-17T08:54Z,"For what it's worth, I got this to work by extracting the 4 files on this and placing them on a DVD.  I made 2 coasters by trying to put the .iso file on a cd and using it.  I had earlier downloaded the core Rosetta by deselecting all the languages on one of the more popular V3 Rosetta torrents and only downloaded the core, working good so far."
