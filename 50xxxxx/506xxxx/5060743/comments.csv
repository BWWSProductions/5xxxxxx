,REDAXIUM,2009-08-27T13:00Z,"Works really well for Vista Downgrade.
its a bit messy during install tho.  i use this version for the awkward laptops because of the ammount of drivers included 400mb in 7zip archives. it includes 20+ sata drivers for nearly all chipsets. the final install is clean drivers are only used during install. "
