A live performance by Motley Crue - Shout At The Devil from the Carnival of Sins Tour.


"Shout at the Devil" is a popular song by the American heavy metal band MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e. Written by bassist Nikki Sixx, the song is the title track of their 1983 album.

This song underwent some controversy because some people saw it as encouraging devil worship. However, this was dropped when Nikki Sixx denied any Diabolatry in the song while playing in Reno, Nevada. The song was rerecorded by the band in 1997 album, Generation Swine, titled "Shout at the Devil '97".

The song was featured in the teen comedy/horror movie Idle Hands, as well as the best selling video game Guitar Hero II for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, in the Opening Licks tier.

"Shout at the Devil" is also the entrance song for New York Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain and for Ultimate Fighting Championship mixed-martial artist Brock Lesnar.

The song was covered by Stuck Mojo during the sessions for their 1996 album Pigwalk, and can be found on the compilation album, Violate This. It featured producer Devin Townsend on guest vocals.

The song's lyrics also mention two songs by Aerosmith: "Round and Round" and "Seasons of Wither"
