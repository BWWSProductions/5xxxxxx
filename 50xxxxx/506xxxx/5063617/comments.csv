,CrazyHarry,2010-01-16T07:28Z,"Works great. Had to re-install XP on an old Gateway but didn't have the disk. I already had a product key so I don't know if this one works or not.

If you want to make this bootable then download, unzip and use nLite to burn it. I tried imgBurn and couldn't get it to work right but nLite worked perfect"
