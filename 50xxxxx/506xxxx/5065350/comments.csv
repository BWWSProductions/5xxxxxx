So many peers is the problem. lol"
,Mfriendly,2009-08-23T00:51Z,"well i limit mine to 500 kb from a 100 Mbit line ;-P
Got other stuff on at the same time so have to do so...already ul 755 MB"
,Mfriendly,2009-08-23T00:52Z,i`ll stop twice what i downloaded.
,Mfriendly,2009-08-23T00:53Z,none scene release yet so keep these coming ballz...good job.
,Mfriendly,2009-08-23T00:55Z,"talking about the devil just arrived:
The.X.Factor.S06E01.WS.PDTV.XviD-NOsegmenT"
,ballztv,2009-08-23T00:57Z,I try and do the x factor every year. I dont have much time to be part of the scene. But my releases match all scene rules. I think anyway. lol
,Mfriendly,2009-08-23T01:02Z,you forgot nfo and sfv file ;-PP
,Mfriendly,2009-08-23T01:02Z,and sample of course
,ballztv,2009-08-23T01:10Z,"Yeah, i suppose i did. 
Maybe i am mistaken but i dont see how the scene release managed to get the size down to < 65 mins so the size could be smaller. Checking the rules it should be 700mb.

Anyway, its good for a non scene release. :)

And thanks for seeding, its appreciated."
