When I thought of sharing this yesterday at mininova with everybody, I just couldn't stop playing that game and going through the boring torrent upload process :P. But I thought I had to share it today, so enjoy and please keep seeding for everyone else, don't be selfish!

Installation:

You'll find two folders, crack and setup. Simply install the game using the normal setup file then navigate to the installation directory and replace the main .exe with the one in the crack folder. Enjoy the release!
