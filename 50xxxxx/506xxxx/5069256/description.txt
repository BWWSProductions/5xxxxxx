I don't have the time or interest to make a huge list of
"tech info" but I've been doing this long enough to know
what's good and what's not.

So, this is about "regular" people jumping into a cab,
the drivers starts a conversation and then it's on..
People entering the cabs that the drivers talk to are
everything from couples getting married, "callgirls"
a.k.a hookers, transvestites, homosexuals, cops.. the
sky's the limit. New York, New York, how I love you.

You people f*cking DiSGUST me.
