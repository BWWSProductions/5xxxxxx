,inahd,2009-08-23T20:05Z,"i swear, this will have a seed eventually..."
,eswye,2009-08-25T16:34Z,"Can somebody plz plz seed, uploader?"
,DieSmurfDie,2009-09-05T05:40Z,"Hi.  Any chance this will ever be seeded?  And if not, could you suggest an alternative source for the content?"
,DieSmurfDie,2009-09-18T20:24Z,"Hi again,  Thanks for seeding it up to 97.3%.  It is much appreciated.  Is there any news on whether the final 2.7% will become available?"
,badger42,2009-09-21T10:22Z,it's bad enough that we have had to wait weeks for this one but to stop at 97.3% is just wrong. how about you seed or give another way to get it.
,Delok,2009-10-14T13:33Z,"FFS inahd, SEEED!!!

I have over 800 peers but no one has more than 97,3%.
Come on, 2.7% of 14GB is only 300Mb, thats almost nothing!"
,BiggDevo,2009-11-26T09:12Z,"I have seeded from my 98.8% on this damn thing for the last 4 weeks, 65 gigs worth, is there no one out there that has this whole thing? I mean really, I need 1.2%, about 300 megs. If there is to be nothing but leeches here, I'll stop seeding and stop coming. Damn, I wish they would fix Demonoid. at least there they track the seed/leech ratio and if you are just a blood sucking leech you'll be out of there! I would think that the genious that posted this would seed it again, since it seems nobody has it complete!"
,badbeaver,2009-12-07T12:26Z,"obviously anyone who has a full copy would not be looking at this torrent, so why don't we all post around on other torrents? eventually someone who has a complete version will take pity on us all and seed, maybe?"
,canadaboy123,2009-12-27T02:29Z,Can some please seed this i am stuck at 98.9%.  Thanks a lot
,treasuremon,2010-01-05T12:57Z,"Just hold on a little longer, my fellow pirates. A seed shall appear in a matter of days. 

As you are all well aware, this is a torrent worth keeping alive and well seeded well into the future. 
DO NOT HIT AND RUN! SEED!"
,Eaglette,2010-02-03T18:58Z,Stuck at 98.8%.  Others & I have been stuck at 98.8%.  How do we get the other 1.2% (when Seeders are available again)?
,spongeluke,2010-03-09T07:14Z,"if we care to do a helluva lotta googling we can slowly repair the torrent, at least partially.  ive definitely found a few of the incomplete ones, will try adding them into the folder.

im at 98% so some of these might be intact at 98.9, but ive likely found
metallurgy.pdf
wood handbook...
foxfire x y z (other torrent 'self reliance')
low cost windspeed indicator

ongoing..

besides, who really needs shit like 'appropriate tech for african women', how many of us are african women anyway, like actually in ethiopia?"
,surfeit,2010-03-16T23:53Z,"I started this torrent the last week of August (2009) and it's been stuck at 98.8% for quite a while. The original ""aggressive"" uploader is either dead or doesn't give a crap. Just want to warn others that 100% download is very unlikely. At this point, it's not clear if this is even worth it."
,BustaHymen,2010-03-25T23:56Z,"!!!!!! twenty of us online are at 99% !!!!!

Some one have 100% to fill us out please?"
