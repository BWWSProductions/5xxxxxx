[T],torrentshredder,2009-08-20T01:25Z,"also get the (removed? why?) torrent from tpb that came with the packed rar files at:

used to be here before:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5059786/Wolfenstein-Razor1911"
,AZkiller7,2009-08-20T03:59Z,""" Shroo "" are you sure it isn't?
well i say again IT IS, you may check that one more time
and by the way i recommend you use Bitcomet 'cause your uTorrent isn't even letting you know whether it is a private torrent or not"

When I read your comments I laughed alot. How can you be such an idiot... :D

Some nfo for you:
The name William ""B.J."" Blazkowicz appears in 1981 when the first wolfenstein game was released on C64 (castle wolfenstein).
The series gained popularity with Wolfenstein 3D (1992 which was developed by ID)

So the name does not come from ID nor activision (Game publishers dont give names to characters...) 

I think it has nothing to do with blowjob either. :D

So its clearly just you...


Anyway the game is really really good. I couldnt wait for the rip and I already finished the game.
Thanks for the rip anyway!

,bullseye[0],2009-08-23T23:56Z,"While I was extracting to my E: drive Microsoft Security Essentials beta picked up TPTB.exe as alert level: Severe.  It points to VirTool:Win32/Obfuscator.C
Just FYI in case anyone was interested. I'm going to check it out and see if its just a false positive which I'm sure it is because of the reworked .exe Thought I'd let you know as well Shroo

,riplikethat,2010-01-02T17:02Z,"Haha, according to reviewers the video quality of pre-rendered cutscenes was already poor in this game. So this rip downgrades them even further?

Feels like Resident Evil 4 all over again. :P"
