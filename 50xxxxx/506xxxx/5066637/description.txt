Extreme is an American rock band, headed by frontmen Gary Cherone and Nuno Bettencourt, that reached the height of their popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band have described their music as 'Funky Metal'.
They have released five studio albums, two EPs (in Japan) and two compilation albums since their formation. The band was one of the most successful rock acts of the early 1990s, selling over 10 million albums worldwide.[3] Extreme achieved their greatest success with their 1990 album Pornograffitti, which peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold in May 1991 and 2Ã—platinum in October 1992.[4] That album featured the acoustic ballad single "More Than Words", which reached #1 on Billboard's Hot 100 in the United States.

Waiting for the Punchline is Extreme's fourth album, which was released in 1995. It was labeled as a "grunge" album, but despite stripped down production and frontman Gary Cherone's gruffer, less-tuneful delivery, it otherwise lacked significant deviation from Extreme's style on prior recordings. The band subsequently disbanded in 1996 after guitarist Nuno Bettencourt informed Extreme that he was leaving the band to pursue a solo career. After the break up, Cherone would also join Van Halen in the same year as their new singer, but left three years later.
