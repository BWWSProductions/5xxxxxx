,djbiggins,2009-08-25T23:13Z,"someone going to seed then, cos whats the point in posting this if your not going to upload it first"
[T],DragonLord721,2009-08-25T23:34Z,"@ djbiggins 

I SEED all of my stuff 24/7 ..just because TPB updates are not as fast as some others, don't mean that it's not being seeded. Just look at my uploads on Mininova and Demonoid for this upload  and you'll see. You need to hang tight as I JUST uploaded this and it has (while I am typing this) 794 leechers which may slow down the speed until some complete and seed.

Thank You .. Dragon"

,hijackit,2009-08-26T10:08Z,"Just saw this at the theater and it was the most satisfying film I have ever seen. If you get a chance, go pay the eight bucks to see this in the theater ... you will not regret it."
,hijackit,2009-08-26T11:12Z,"The subs are a little off on what is actually being said. But overall, good work.

A - 6
V - 6"
,Zack_L,2009-08-26T11:26Z,Its decent for a cam. Video isnt so good but at least it has the subs.  Its probably the best version out now A 8 V 6

,train2u,2009-11-15T01:25Z,"An accurate review:  This is a decent CAM copy. Video: 7 Audio: 8.  

It isn't DVD quality, but if you just want to see the movie (get an idea), then it's worthy of a look.  The translation subtitles are a bit off, but overall a good movie copy."
