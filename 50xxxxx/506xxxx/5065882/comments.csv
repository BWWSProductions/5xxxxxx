,Arionex,2010-04-15T18:07Z,"Kyria.girl, honestly you have something to be happy for, and it's me. I don't like the Twilight Saga and I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and download it all from you, and read it before even bashing against it once more. Thanks. By the way, I did start reading The Host, now THAT story I liked."
