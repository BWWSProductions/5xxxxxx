I think that this will be a backdoor that can be abused by troyans building zombie networks."
[T],tzanev,2009-08-27T17:31Z,"I do not understand it either, but try getting it work without doing so. I did not crack this myself, rather I downloaded it from Demonoid. Frankly I was impressed that it worked without creating any problems for my internet access."
,cizkob,2009-09-15T07:09Z,"Hi! and thanks for the upload.
I just want to know why everytime I open Workbench, it tells me that there 14, 13, 13 and so on days left of the licesence... did I do something wrong?
I would be very grateful if you explain me how to fix the issue.
Thanks again."
[T],tzanev,2009-09-16T14:36Z,"There are quite a lot hoops you have to jump through to get around the license protection. I am not sure which one you went wrong with. The instructions are included so I recommend that you uninstall the program, delete all leftover files from the documents and settings/application data folder and finally do a thorough registry clean with something like CCleaner. Then try installing it again, following the instructions very carefully. I know it is complicated but it does actually work. "
,cizkob,2009-09-18T19:40Z,"I'll try, I'll let you know later, thanks."
[T],tzanev,2009-09-22T11:58Z,"I have had several people complain - one here, others elsewhere - that this only works as a trial copy. Back in March when I first downloaded and installed this, everything went smoothly. I guess it's possible that some kind of block has been put on the license file from the boys at SDL - I really cannot say.
So what I want to know is: Has anyone been able to install and register this as a fully functional copy or not? If this is no, then it might be worth taking down this torrent, since trial copies are obviously available from the official Trados site and possibly at higher download rates."
[T],tzanev,2009-09-22T12:02Z,"Lol. It is supposed to say: ""If the answer is no..."""
,krwzzikpuzzi,2009-10-04T07:30Z,"My installation did not work before I actived ""Start Server"" in Start/Stop/Reread in the Flexlm Licensing tool.
"
,krwzzikpuzzi,2009-10-04T07:34Z,"When everything is set up correctly you see this message in the About dialog:
Official SDL license file
Translator's Workbench/SDLX, Version 8.0, can be borrowed for 672 hours"
,NoellaB,2009-10-10T21:14Z,"Trados 2007 installed and working perfectly. No time limit. NOTE : it is essential to follow the instructions to the letter if you do not want problems with your Internet connection. Also note that is not possible to buy an upgrade at lowest price to version 2009 with this, because Trados keeps track of buyers. Thanks for letting us have this software, Trados is a thief."
[T],tzanev,2009-10-11T22:24Z,"I'm glad to hear that this still works. I guess the problems people are facing stem from inadequate following of the instructions.

And yes, I agree - this is probably the most extortionately overpriced software I have encountered yet. And you have to keep renewing the license! Cheeky bastards!"
,FredDjin,2009-11-06T18:53Z,"Tzanev, if possible do please provide step by step instructions for installing, or send it to fred.djin@gmail.com
New with all this and I did not find any instruction in torrent.
Thanks :)  "
[T],tzanev,2009-11-07T09:01Z,"@ FredDjin: The instructions are in the HOWTO.txt file, which is actually included in the torrent. Good luck! "
,smacks2009,2009-11-08T19:21Z,"I recently installed this together with Office 2007 on Windows 7, and it works beautifully. If used with virtualization software (like Parallels on a Mac), it's very easy to change the MAC address. Excellent torrent if you need a working Trados installation."
,animyrch,2009-11-25T10:59Z,I did exactly what it says in the howto file. And it works perfectly. Thanks for the upload. Very good torrent. I will be seeding for a long time. 
,xzaga,2009-11-25T23:40Z,"Mmm. Not working for me. I already tried to install it 3 times. IÂ´m quite sure IÂ´m following the procedure exactly as you wrote it. When I activate the product using the licesence file, a message saying that trados has been activated appears... but when I close Trados and re-open it, it asks me for the license again."
,osanon,2010-01-06T03:02Z,It works.
,a1iz,2010-01-13T13:37Z,"it works, although it says Official SDL license file
Translator's Workbench/SDLX, Version 8.0, can be borrowed for 672 hours, but it works BEAUTIFULLY THANKS!!"
,archet,2010-02-01T10:07Z,"Smac didn't work on Win7, so I used Technitium TMAC (it's freeware, no need to crack it), but otherwise everything worked perfectly. Thanks!"
,kermit123,2010-03-17T13:11Z,"It works! Thanks! 
I had to use Technitium TMAC to change MAC, as the tool in the torrent package was demo-mode only. 
It says ""can be borrowed for 672 hours"" in the licence information, and I'm hoping it won't say 671 hours in 1 hour :-)"
,Pacorko,2010-03-24T04:55Z,"Hello, all.

My version used to work without a problem, until recently. I tried to use after a 2 month vacation period where I did not work with Trados at all--even when the app was still on my office programs' bars. Now that I get more work, I can't run it becuase it's in ""trial"" mode.

I already unistalled it, rebooted, did the MAC address change agaian, rebooted and reinstalled, FIVE TIMES... but I keep getting the message mt TM is to big to run on trial mode. Now, I also get the message ""You must de-register your license before you can uninstall SDLX"".

Can anyone offer some pointers?

Thank you!"
,kermit123,2010-04-13T07:58Z,"I installed 25 days ago and had no problems until today, when launching WB it said that it is running in trial mode with 3 days left. I did some math and the 672 hrs referred to by the Lincence Manager come to 28 days (=25 + 3). Has anyone else experienced this? Will it really stop running in 3 days?"
,kermit123,2010-04-16T16:20Z,"OK, so the ""can be borrowed"" period ran out after 28 days. After that the applications started saying they are in demo mode and wanted me to enter a license key when launched. However, after pressing ""cancel"" the applications launch normally, and seem to work normally, not in demo mode. So the registration window is just a nuisance. Does anyone have a solution for that? Like how to extent the ""can be borrowed"" period?"
,mayarine,2010-10-21T11:45Z,"I did everything as the HOWTO file indicates but when I start the program it says that ""sdl synergy has stopped working and windows is looking for a solution"" . Then it stops looking and the program doesn't open. 

Thank's for the rest of the information by the way!"
,ggy417,2011-02-21T11:30Z,"This works fine for me, though I discovered that setting the MAC address on a network bridge doesn't work for this purpose. Installing the 'TAP Virtual Ethernet Adaptor' from OpenVPN and configuring its MAC address does the trick -- this is a handy workaround for machines that do not have an Ethernet port, or when one doesn't want to change the MAC address of an existing Ethernet port.

Once installed, the ""FLEXlm Licensing Tool"" has some useful diagnostic capabilities and can be used to check that whatever method of setting the MAC address has worked correctly."
,Ktap,2011-09-06T10:29Z,Did I do something wrong. I only get the demo mode when I try to do an alignement and cannot save nor export the alignments to a translation memory.
,Ktap,2011-09-06T10:46Z,"You say: ""2. Copy license.lic from WI-FI_Adaptor
folder to your HD.""
Yes but where on the HD? 
Lol I am a real beginner on this thing"
,cinto,2011-09-13T14:22Z,"Thanks for uploading this great tool. I installed it to the letter on Win7-64bit and got 'SDL Trados Syn. stopped working' Could it be a compatibility issue?

I found an excellent way to change the mac without having to install programs."
,Tribula,2012-07-25T20:44Z,To robinhocg - tell me about this way!
