Ramblings, selective comparisons and speculative assumptions of a paranoid wannabe conspiracy theorist.

Regarding the Mothman part, if you believe the phenomenon, the book was published in the 50s or 60s, and many of the 'testimonials' date back as far as the 1880s. This period in history is not largely known for it's social enlightenment and collective intelligence.

As for the Batman part, any fan of the graphic novels will tell you the the Joker is always ambiguous, as either an allegory of 'the devil', the personification of chaos (or evil), or quite simply the 'negative' of Batman (God/Satan, anyone?). Per the other villains, as also common in comicbook baddies, they are narcissistic megalomaniacs, thus believing themselves almost godlike in their defining qualities. In reference to the latter Batman movies, the Bruce Wayne character is trained to be a ninja, explaining completely his ability to 'disappear'. RE the Mothman similarity mini-part, the people on the ground were not on drugs 'to show them the real deal', but hallucinogens that amplify fears. Also, the bit about the mask, at the start of 'the dark knight', this isn't even worth commenting on. Look at the shape of the mask, when the car pulls up, the actor moves, slightly turning the mask, so what's obscuring the shadow from the car is actually the inside of the side of the mask!

As for the remarks on Spawn and Gabriel... Not even worth commenting on!

Regarding the Watchmen segment, the whole graphic novel is an analogue for society, and is based in an alternate timeline, where Nixon was elected for a third term. Ozymandias, though in name, appears similar to whatever demonic parallel name the narrator remarks upon, is actually a character from Ancient Egyptian history or mythology.

For the homosexuality parallel, the narrator really is looking where there is nothing but speculation and flippant comments. Per demons being gay, if christians think homosexuality is a sin, and the devil being basically sin incarnate, wouldn't his demons indulge in it?

Whoever wrote this show really doesn't comprehend that some writers are intelligent, thus having many points of reference with which to create characters and storylines, whether consciously or not.

Also, the symbols the 'Illuminati' use are very well known, and attention is drawn to them constantly. The very use of these symbols does not prove the existence of the group, nor their supposed/assumed power, it merely proves the symbols themselves exist. Relatively often, directors will include these symbols in their productions to get the extra attention from conspiratory nuts, who will garner the movie more publicity by spreading word to their 'peers' that a secret society had some influence in the movie, thus gettin more people to watch the damn thing!

Life is interesting enough. Yours must be pretty boring to have to postulate on ambiguities, and reading into things that just aren't there! There are no hidden meanings, only what you make there to be."

Always mind the video and audio hypnosis and lack of any valid points in the movie.
Watch out!"
