If the CSDA's feel that they are truly Adventist's, believing in Ellen White (which is not pertinent to salvation, by the way), then they would call themselves Seventh-day Adventists.  If they knew Ellen White's writings, she said long ago that people would attempt to divide, split, or leave the church.  

Out of all of this, however, I see one decent reason for the General Conference to be doing this, and that is the continual accusations by ignorant members of our society that the SDA church is a cult.  When the General Conference has control of the SDA name, they can make sure that no fringe groups, using their name, act in a non-Christ like manner (i.e. David Koresh, to name one).

Thanks for the upload!  I'm looking forward to reading this!"
