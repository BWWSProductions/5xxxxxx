Description: 

During 2007, after 10 years of their dissolution, rumours stated that Soda Stereo would tour South America before the end of the year. A reunion tour was finally announced on June 9, 2007 as the "Me VerÃ¡s Volver" tour ("You Will See Me Come Back", referring to lyrics on Doble Vida's "En la Ciudad de la Furia"). The tour started at the River Plate stadium on October 19, 2007, where they played "El Ãšltimo Concierto" in 1997.

Me VerÃ¡s Volver featured concerts in different countries of America. Initially, the band announced two concerts at River, but 90.000 tickets were sold in only 24 hours, and the band added one more show to the schedule, and after three days, the tickets for the first three shows were sold out, and the band added two more shows in Argentina to the tour. The expected amount of fans attending the five shows was more than 300,000, making Soda Stereo one of the most watched public events in the country.

22 shows were performed, all but two of them sold out. The schedule included one show in Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama; two shows in Peru's Estadio Nacional and in Chile's Estadio Nacional; three shows in the United States, one on The Home Depot Center (Los Angeles, California) and two in the AmericanAirlines Arena (Miami, Florida); four in Mexico and six in Argentina, becoming the only band to play more than five times in the Estadio Monumental in a single tour.
