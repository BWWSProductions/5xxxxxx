PLOT: Management chronicles the chance meeting of Mike Cranshaw and Sue Claussen when she checks into the roadside motel owned by Mikeâ€™s parents in Arizona. A bottle of wine â€˜compliments of managementâ€™ jump starts the cross-country journey and unique courtship between two different kinds of people who are both ultimately looking for the same thing - a sense of happiness. Mike sees something special in button downed Sue that inspires him to take a chance and hit the road to go after her. But once he reaches Maryland, he finds that Sue has no place for an aimless dreamer in her carefully ordered life. Obsessed with making a difference in the world, Sue falls back in with her punk-turned-Yogurt mogul ex-boyfriend Jango, who promises her a chance to head his charity operations. But having finally found something worth fighting for, Mike puts his hopes against her practicality and the two embark on a twisted, bumpy, ultimately freeing journey to discover that their place in the world just might be together.
