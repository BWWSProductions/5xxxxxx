,psykoterapeuten,2009-08-27T11:06Z,Is it possible to burn this on 2 dvd-5??
[T],bitpirate,2009-08-27T20:23Z,"yes thats possible, cut the movie in 2 pieces, but its not readable on a dvd/bluerayplayer"
,caliwillbemine,2009-08-30T22:37Z,"wait, i suppose the audio is in swedish if i'm not mistaken, but you didn't provide any link to get ENGLISH subs ?!?
What a no sense."
,sscorvettes,2009-09-04T15:40Z,what am I doing wrong?? I can not burn this to a dl-dvd?? Which program should I use?
,imploder,2009-09-10T17:05Z,"you can burn this to DLdish with imgburn (use udf format) and watch it on bluray player LG 370 and LG 390 which have mkv  suport.

you can also use http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/
and remux/cut the file at 4000MB 
then you have 2 files which play continious on your usb formated stick, and put it in the usb slot on LG 370/390

if you wanna use PS3 usb playback, use tsmuxer and remux file to M2TS file, and cut/split it at 4000MB  (2 minutes top)"
,tarmsaft,2009-09-10T23:28Z,"Looks like a fake. Have downloaded 50% and had a glance,  the first 10 secs was a family guy episode."
,tarmsaft,2009-09-11T07:25Z,"This is odd, never mind my last comment. When the entire file was downloaded the movie ran fine with no trace of Family Guy. Must be something fucked up with VLC."
,botaif,2009-09-14T22:17Z,Vlc and mkvfiles don`t work very vell. Mediaplayer classic works fine for me. http://www.cccp-project.net/
