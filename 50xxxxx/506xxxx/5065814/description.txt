Comprehensive details are provided on over 9,800 ports and terminals including a complete description of the port and all of the relevant facilities, plans and mooring diagrams (over 4,000 in total), contact details of port service providers and agents, maritime atlas, port photographs and a worldwide distance table.
User notes can be added to each port and can be catergorised by user, date, subject and content. The flexible report generator allows for customised reporting.
Designed for use onboard the vessel and within the vessel operations department, the Ports and Terminals Guide CD ROM is more than a simple replacement for printed guides. It provides the very best port information in a format that is both clear and easy to access.
