,Mejlurarduinte,2009-08-26T18:43Z,"WTF is wrong with TPB? The tracker does not work, and has not worked for several fucking days now."
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-08-27T06:18Z,"@Ordeal
YOU ARE WRONG THIS IS JEDI ACADEMY 2"
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-08-27T06:29Z,"@Ordeal
sorry you are right my mistake"

,NekoZabuza,2009-10-14T20:22Z,"THIS IS NOT JEDI ACADEMY 2!!!! I GOOGLED IT AND IT WAS NOT FOUND!!!! SO YOU ARE WRONG, THERE IS NO JEDI ACADEMY 2!!!!"
,super97,2009-10-15T16:24Z,"Relax, he has already admitted his error in naming the torrent. By the way, does this game really work? I was searching for this game and I found this torrent. Seeing that this torrent has 36+s and only 4-s (32+s), and seeing that the uploader is a Trusted user, I decided to download this torrent. But tell me, does this really work? I don't want to give myself the hope that this game exists in an uncorrupted torrent and have it torn away at the last moment. So please reply, does this game work?"
,super97,2009-10-15T16:31Z,"@Killawife
Vad menar du tracker data ska uppdateras? Och när du säger det inte fungerade för dig antingen vid första, menar du att spelet inte ladda ner, eller spelet inte spela?
Tyvärr, svenska är inte mitt första språk ...;)"
,slothy77,2009-10-17T01:56Z,"This ""Jedi Knight 2:  Outcast"" either, it is Jedi Academy.  

It seems to work, but is not what it says it is, nor what the 'correction' says it is. "
,super97,2009-10-17T14:02Z,Then what is it? It is a Star Wars game right? please tell me its a Star Wars game!
,super97,2009-10-21T14:54Z,"What the hell! Don't spam if you don't want to get banned. djDEVASTATE2009 is great uploader. This game DID work. Worked GREAT! And what do you think of yourself, calling us bitches and gays? Mind your language, or else don't comment on TPB."

,kevsssss,2010-03-01T08:17Z,"umm i downloaded it, followed steps but 
this error came up

""GLW_StartOpenGL() - could not load OpenGL subsystem""

what am i suppose to do now ?"
,super97,2010-04-02T21:46Z,"I don't know, but check out your graphics card. It's definitely a graphics problem. If you have a lower quality card, buy a new card for optimal performance or try this (I don't know if it works, but try): Right-click the shortcut you normally use, then Properties. In Properties, open the Compatiblity tab and check 'Run in 256 colours'. I don't know if that'll help, but try it. If it doesn't work, search Google with your problem as a search string. Try this: 
""GLW_StartOpenGL() - could not load OpenGL subsystem, Star Wars - Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy, help, opengl"""
,Surg3on,2010-05-24T23:52Z,Could you please stop mentioning that this isn't Jedi Academy 2 we got that already and does the game actually work? can someone confirm? 
,TaishiFox,2010-06-03T23:51Z,"I can confirm the game does work even though its clearly NOT JKA2, its JKA1, but it definately works."
,eddygrant,2010-06-30T23:29Z,"hi, installing this game was really frustrating :( there are two NRG files which i eventually installed through daemon tools, but each time i attempt to play the game it opens a window saying that it's the wrong disk, i've tried fiddling with it but i'm no expert and just cannot get it to go :$ please if anyone has an idea please reply., thanks.

...

also., the ""jasp"" application (which has the jedi academy logo, for it's item image) which is found in the ""crack"" file also refuses to work due to an ""openal32.dll"" system error, having reinstalled the whole program software as it requests, i still have had no progress :(
This is supposedly a great game but so far it has just been a great pain. any help would be greatly appreciated :)"
,jbscythe,2010-10-15T03:28Z,anybody out there looking for Star Wars - Force Commander pc game? here it is full and no install or crack needed. just extract and play. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5887563/Star_Wars_-_Force_Commander.rar
,Yhor123,2010-11-28T09:16Z,"The game (JKA) works on single player great, but on multiplayer it errors ""game disk not in drive"" or similar message. 

If I find a workaround, I'll post it."
