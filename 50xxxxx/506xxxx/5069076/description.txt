This Jeppesen Jeppview 3, is an old, tested, virus free program, which provides
topo-aeronautical charts for more than 8000 airports worldwide and the whole
airway structure around the earth. It includes also all available and working
radio nav aids, again, worldwide ! Finally provides for GPS navigation !

It is updated every two weeks by means of 2 CDs and is an essential tool
for an aviator, GIS or GPS enthusiast, Flight Sim enthusiast and more !

To make full use of it you must also download and install CD-1 Navdata and
CD-2 Text pages (found elsewhere in this site). 


It runs under 32-bit XP, Vista, win 7 and needs also acrobat reader installed.
you can burn the CDs or just mount on Daemon tools, Magiciso etc.
For Vista or win 7, i prefer as more stable approach to use a virtual machine
(vmware - v6 also found in this site - and run it under XP sp2 or sp3). 


To install, avoiding current security tech from Boeing - Jeppesen you must follow
to the letter these instructions:

 1.Disconnect Internet
 2.Set computer clock for Jan 10, 2009
 3.select both Jeppview and Flitedeck programs
 4.use as name : PILOTS
 5.use serial  : VNX1-IBYH-E5K1-7G8F ( this will give you Full Worldwide access )

now you need the other two CDs.
you MUST get version 01/2009

install CD1 using following 2 serials:

for VFR Europe : 217AN22318
for Full Worldwide : 217AN22319

install CD2 (no serial here...)

 6.Do not reboot
 7.Run Jeppview or Flitedeck
 8.Program prompts for 30-day free use or Activation
 9.press NEXT
10.Select "by phone" option and press NEXT
11.use the code R00D-KCAB (r-zero-zero-d) not ROOD (r-o-o-d)  !!!!

12. set now the current date on computer clock !!!

you are good to go now... however this info is good till as of Jan 2009.

to make it current you can browse this site and download the current CD1, CD2.
instructions and serial nbrs / codes usually included, but still there is a lot
of information in relevant torrents in the comments section.


with a cheap 20-bucks usb gps receiver supporting NMEA 0183 protocol,
you can explore the full potential of these programs, specially Flitedeck installed
on a laptop. Beats the Garmin and the other big tyranos. I use a Swiss made Navilock
with excellent results using local VFR or IFR charts for background, moving map and all, 
day or night !!

Happy trips to all !


UPDATE 08 Jan 2010  ---------  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


most of your questions are already answered in this or similar posts (try search with jepp*) in this site.
the new info is cause Jeppesen has upgraded security, for new installation, change first your computer clock to 31-12-2008 and use cycle 01 of 2009 so the R00D-KCAB can be validated without problems (validation code through phone) then run the program so it will alter the registry settings. Then close the program, change time and reboot. Now you can use any of the recent codes, 25 or 26 of 2009, 01 of 2010 etc. without problems !
