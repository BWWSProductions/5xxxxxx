,no_nick,2009-10-08T13:58Z,"I'w downloaded your JeppView Cycle 2009-01 but when I try to use the keys you post here:

""""install CD1 using following 2 serials:

for VFR Europe : 217AN22318
for Full Worldwide : 217AN22319""""

It doesn't work. The only keys that work are the ones that came with the JeppView Cycle 2009-01 torrent."
,fly2you,2009-10-25T18:23Z,"Hello FSallATP
I was wondering about the tip you gave me a while ago to get the additional coverage activation codes for JV from the navdata disks (either Disc 1 or 2).
I can't seem to find the respective files you told me. Where do you get the full world coverage and the VFR europe codes from nowadays?

Best regards"

But unfortunatly after the istallation at the first running, Flight deck working fine and Jepview don't start and write the following error: THE VECTOR PLUS DATA COULD NOT BE FOUND (*.VPL) IN C:\JEPPESEN\COMMON\VPL\"" OR (*.ADT. *.PDT, *.LDT) IN C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\DESKTOP\! PLEASE ENSURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS INSTALLED PROPERLY. 
This is the error and so I tryed to reinstall it 3 time and I tryed to reinstall also your past torrent with the Jepview data calc and also this torrent ""Jeppview 3 (Program disk - Terminal - Enroute charts) 0720 Cycle"" No way!! only flitedeck working with last update ""Jeppesen Airac 0925"". I apreciate your help!!      "
[T],FSallATP,2010-01-08T14:12Z,"UPDATE 08 Jan 2010  ---------  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

rename the C:\JEPPESEN  folder in XP, in Vista and Windows 7  rename the respective folder in Program files, in Program Data, in Users\your user\name\Applications\Local or Roaming etc.

Set the computer clock to 31 Dec 2008.

!!!!!

most of your questions are already answered in this or similar posts (try search with jepp*) in this site.
the new info is cause Jeppesen has upgraded security, for new installation, change first your computer clock to 31-12-2008 and use cycle 01 of 2009 so the R00D-KCAB can be validated without problems (validation code through phone) then run the program so it will alter the registry settings. Then close the program, change time and reboot. Now you can use any of the recent codes, 25 or 26 of 2009, 01 of 2010 etc. without problems !
