Downloaded ""District 9"" about 5 times now and every time I have about a 6 second delay between A/V and I know your uploads are tight. Not having this with any other dl's....... May this be a codec problem? I've tried with antivirus off, firewall down, etc,etc,etc. Only thing I can think is codec but any insight would be greatly appreciated!"
