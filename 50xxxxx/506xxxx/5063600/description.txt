I haven't seen those files myself, in fact, I'm still leeching them from where ever. As soon as I reach a ratio of 10 to 1, I'm clearing the hard-drive from those. Maybe, in a year or two, I can seed back from the DVD made from these ISO. But hey, he will be making a new stage appearance till then I'm sure, and hopefully, maybe, he won't need to;)

Peace

This is the full day talk on 3 standard PAL DVD's in ISO format.
Just burn to DVDR's using imgburn, nero or similar app.

If this doesn't play on DVD players in NTSC countries (Americas & Japan) then go into your DVD player options.
Under video options section look for TV system. Set the output to NTSC not Auto!
If that doesn't work you will need to either watch it on your PC or do an NTSC DVD conversion using software.
Since this will be my only release, I leave it up to others to release it on DiVX,and NTSC DVD's for the Americas and Japan.

Expect the initial seeding upload speed to be very slow or almost non existant between 2pm and 7pm eastern us summer time,
7pm-12am GMT british summer time, 8pm-1am european summer time or 4am-9am Eastern Australian time
