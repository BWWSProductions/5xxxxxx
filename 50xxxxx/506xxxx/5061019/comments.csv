Because i found some interesting for PC, if you put them into the folder Downloads, you can use them.

,giwdul,2010-01-12T15:12Z,"This version is only English. It works fine.
Warning you must always use LittleSnitch, because Sim3 is connecting to internet, which will destroy your copy. Always don´t allow connecting.

If you have troubles try to delete the Preference-Files. Can be found: User/Library/Preferences"
,giwdul,2010-01-12T15:19Z,"How to mange Addons, the Sims3pack files ????

This version is good for installing Sims3pack files.
Just drop all ""Sims3pack files"" in the folder Downloads, which can found in Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3. If you don´t have the folder, make yourself one. Copy all Sims3pack files in the first level of the Downloads. 
If you start The Sims, go to button downloads and you can add all.

If your Sim3 don´t show the Downloads dialog after startup, you should use this method:
Use the files from a different Sim3 app, maybe from a friend, (files from PC should work too). Copy all the following folders from the Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims-Folder into yours.
Take these folders: DCCache, DCBackup, Library, InstalledWorlds

Both methods works with different program versions."

What you'll need is a crack for it. Simply search in Google ""Sims 3 Crack 1.29.55""

Then what you need to do is:
1. Look for The Sims 3 in the Applications folder
2. Right-click, Show Package Contents
3. Contents > Resources > transgaming > c_drive > Program Files > Electronic Arts > The Sims 3 > Game > Bin
4. Once inside Bin, replace ""TS3W.exe"" and ""TSLHost.dll"" with the ones from the crack folder you just downloaded.
5. Close Sims if you have it opened and restart/reopen it. The crack should work.

Otherwise great copy and worth the download"

,oldmasta,2012-07-20T23:37Z,"i guess i was too excited. the game is running, BUT it lags like hell, my character takes 30min to go from one room to another and showers 1hr in the morning, everything takes ages, so theres inconsistency between the actions and the clock counting. above all, no fast forwarding, so you have to watch him sleep. great. ergo, useless torrent.
