,kolokythis,2009-09-21T14:58Z,"The downloanding speed is awesome and the file is clean (scanned with NOD32, Spybot, Ad-Aware, Malwarebytes and Spyware Doctor) I want to thank the uploader and ask for an advise. When I am trying to make a capture I take a message that SnagIT encountered a problem and needs to shut down. What is this? I am running XP SP3. I will appreciate any help."
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-09-22T22:16Z,"@ armageddan & @ kolokythis good that you liked the application and I took it from the review site and the serial also was there as I mentioned, so it is 100% sure it is clean, about your question @kolokythis I cannot help, I used Snagit for a while but I had to formate my pc and after that I haven't installed Snagit yet, so I haven't use the program 100 %... maybe if you googled it you may find the answer."
,tornadosturnmeon,2009-09-26T17:46Z,"Not sure if this is it, but I D/L a version of Snagit two days ago. Inside the RAR was a file in spanish (apparently for a bi-lingual use).  This unleashed a horrific a.exe worm on the computer.  Completey hijacked my browsers, and basically put me out of commission. That's what I get for being in a hurry. Not saying this version is the one, just saying be careful.   As for the person who u/l the file, his time is comming. "

Tornadosturnmeon - no this one is fine, this is not it."
,GGG12CCC,2009-10-10T17:35Z,Great! Works flawlessly! No viruses according to norton antivirus 2010.
,TheColdTruth,2009-10-13T18:58Z,"Clean according to NOD32, but I get all sorts of errors and it crashes when trying to capture a scrolling webpage in Win XP Pro 32-bit."
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-10-17T20:51Z,"@Kwanger I am glad it works well for you. Cheers Mate...
It has been some time since I came to this torrent, concerning to virus that is not it, if you have doubts look for the site version and use only the serial I provide in the torrent... as I said I downwloaded the snagit a net review and software page - CNET, so no way there is virus in this."
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-10-17T20:52Z,@GGG12CCC  Cheers!
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-10-17T20:54Z,"I must have been drunk this last part...
""as I said I downwloaded the snagit a net review and software page - CNET, so no way there is virus in this."" 
Correction: as I said I downloaded the snagit from a net review and software page - CNET, so no way there is viruses in this. "
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-10-17T20:59Z,"@ tornadosturnmeon, you said ""inside the rar"" this is not a rar file..."
