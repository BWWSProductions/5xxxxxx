This mental poison, this pretended knowledge, is the biggest plague humanity ever faced."

1st rate erudite polemic should be required watching for anyone proffessing any kind of religion, quite fun to watch as well. Does not argue against the existence of a creator rather the fantasy of 'beliefs' that surround the idea of one. Another antidote to 'fuckwit TV'."
