Do you plan on posting in some other torrent site rather than this one, after the ""big sale"" next week?  If so, where?  "
[T],thegreenfrog,2009-08-22T22:16Z,"The sale would affect current operations?

I have accounts on puretna dot com and empornium dot us Both have a large number of registered users but are private. Fortunately, for those who have an account, I have used the same username, so I'll be easy to find.

Can you suggest an open tracker, like TPB I could use? 

I also have a demonoid dot com account which will not help us  and the girls.

I have not posted much there, except the ISM collection, still being uploaded.

[V],bestec1234,2009-08-24T00:16Z,"There are some who believe that the sale will have a catastrophic effect on current operations.  I'm not really sure why.

I tried to create an account on puretna and I didn't get the confirmation email... :("
[T],thegreenfrog,2009-08-26T07:18Z,"In case TPB shuts down or changes beyond recognition, I am looking at puretna dot com and empornium dot us as an alternative. Both of them private but with largish membership, almost 1 million each.

I know that the board called forumophilia dot has a nice selection of hairy. Downside You need a RS or some other similar account to make it work. Boards often have a long list of banned sites, make sure you know what you're doing!

I am called thegreenfrog in all three. How fortunate!"
[V],bestec1234,2009-08-26T12:47Z,"(Sorry I didn't answer your questions in your previous comment)
I'm not aware of any other open trackers; I haven't researched that.

I tried creating an account at puretna but it's been disabled.  Not sure why.

TGF, do you post in any forums?  It would be somewhat better than discussing this here, IMHO.  I've probably asked you that before and forgot the answer."
[T],thegreenfrog,2009-08-26T19:59Z,"I am thegreenfrog at forumophilia dot com and pornbb dot org and  occasionally visit others.

With a little work you can find a great number of boards and trackers carrying good stuff but many are quite small. They might get a boost if TPB goes down. It is the Wal-Mart of the torrent world after all.
