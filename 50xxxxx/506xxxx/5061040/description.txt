For over a thousand years, Rome was the centre of the known world.

One of the most glorious empires in history, she brought to her subjects a common language, shared culture, and for some wealth beyond imagination.

But nothing lasts forever.

War, barbarian attacks, and moral decay eventually took their toll and the empire slowly began to crumble.

Travelling back in time to one of the most glorious empires in history, this six-part series presents the complete history of Rome, from its primitive beginnings, to the height of its glory to its eventual decline, as well as its legacies today.
