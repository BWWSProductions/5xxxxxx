,Yurn,2009-12-21T01:04Z,"So typical of P2P or random personal rips. 

I have just checked Home Alone 1. It is OUT OF SYNC by the end of the movie. IN SYNC at the START, OUT OF SYNC in the MIDDLE. OUT OF SYNC at the END.

You need to check these files before uploading, especially if it's been ripped by some random (e.g. sypher102). Scene releases are different you can expect them to be good without even checking them through first.

I enjoy wasting my bandiwdth, power and time though."
