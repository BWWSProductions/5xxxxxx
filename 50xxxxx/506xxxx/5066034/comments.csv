,erikphnx,2009-08-23T23:33Z,"Thank you for including Wild Blue. I look forwards to hearing it again even if turns out to not be as good as I remember it  :)
I can't wait to check out the rest of the albums you included and as luck would have it I have the day off from work tomorrow
I know all good things must come to an end but I am really going to miss checking piratebay and the joy of discovering a new 80zforever torrent"

I'm looking for the album by the brother of Supertramp's Bassist Dougie Thompson. I can't for the life of me remember his first name. i had heard a few songs from it a while back and really liked it. Did sound a lot like Supertramp! Help please!!"
[V],80zforever,2009-08-26T03:31Z,80scrazy I vaguely remember this guy but I don't have it for sure. sorry man.

As always - U rock!   Thanks so much."
