,ml01172,2009-10-08T21:25Z,"No seeeeders. Got 1,1 KB per second right now, which is telling me there are, like, 2 seeders, and very stingy, that is. Come on, people, turn your torrents on even when you're NOT downloading! Don't be selfish!"
,ebutaljib,2009-10-26T13:29Z,"Many thanks for this.

You seem to be missing one episode: ""Rodney come home"" (Christmas 1990)

Instead of that you have two ""The Jolly boys' outing"". Is that an error in the file name and one of them is ""Rodney come home""?"
,ebutaljib,2009-10-26T13:32Z,"Also, the episode that is here named ""Gulf War"" is officially ""The Robin flies at dawn""."

I offered these up and nobody wanted them, only one person asked me if i'd copy the whole collection onto dvd and post them out to her...I did.
Still each to their own"

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-12-16T14:08Z,"Spellweaver,most people convert dvds cos they dont behanve well on computers,plus they are vastly oversized-700 meg for a 4 -7 gig dvd is silly-so they use dvd shrink & agk to reduce & convert the file to avi which is compatible on all codex all platforms & all fones.plus a dvd file uploaded here will be in annoying chapters-each chapter requires a seperate file & that is really fuckin annoying lol.avi is the way........as some bloke once said :P"
