,zcold,2009-09-07T14:36Z,"has been some seeding issues. I know have a dedicated box seeding, so as soon as there are seeders that can take over this disc, I will add up the next discs and so on and so forth. ;)"
,zcold,2009-09-08T23:41Z,"damn, 40 gigs transfer and no seeds yet... "
,zcold,2009-09-10T17:27Z,"as soon as I fix my iptables and get rtorrent back up, ill have discs 3-4 up soon."
,noidblarg,2009-10-11T15:09Z,"almost 1:1 seeded, and working great.  thanks!  Any way to get up disk 3/4?"
,RyanCorpse,2009-11-01T23:09Z,"Any chance of knowing when Disc 3 is coming up?

I've also acquired a torrentbox and would be willing to seed for as long as it takes."
