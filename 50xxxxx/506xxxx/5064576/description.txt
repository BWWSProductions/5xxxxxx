This stripped-down blues-rock duo are an anomaly in their adopted home of Brooklyn. While most of their neighbours are painting alt-pop into kaleidoscopic new colours, this compelling debut cleaves to a version of rock that is sparse, soulful and defiantly retro. White Stripes comparisons are inevitable, not least because of the thrillingly primal way Andy LaPlant thumps the drums, but it is raw emotion akin to Cat Power that comes through most strongly on tracks such as "Release" and the startling "Bones Are Tired", on which Jessica Larrabee's unadorned voice is at its most desolate.
