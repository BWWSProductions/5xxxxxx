I wonderer the full package with on install ;)"
,JSIT99,2009-08-23T17:46Z,Bull shit?
,flakhappy,2009-08-28T00:42Z,"If you have been using one of the keys available on the web for your previous version, this update seems to render it useless and asks for a new code to be entered upon startup.  I have not found a v3.3 key available yet.  Do not upgrade unless your copy is legal."
,David1125,2009-08-29T15:58Z,"Since this is only an update as albinoz said, you can use software update, so this torrent is pretty useless, since apple will automatically update the software for you."

,Pyaralarka,2010-11-19T20:27Z,"I am new to Mac, After running both .dmg files it stopped by saying that no update found and then I was not able to select the disc. Can someone help me Please..."
,gabcooldude,2011-01-24T03:24Z,"Neither DMGs work...
The client DMG tells me a more recent instance of this program is already installed.
The admin one tells me that the Remote Desktop Admin cant be installed on any of my discs and that the update could not find the admin application, that apparently, is there... 

Is there someway to see where it is? Spotlight won't help me."
