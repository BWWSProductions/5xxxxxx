,stalker2755,2010-03-05T01:55Z,"Probably it's related to the HardlockVoliacom.exe loader... if that doesn't work than no need to download this... but heck, I might give it a try anyway, maybe I might get lucky."
,stalker2755,2010-06-10T04:21Z,It's not working... best is to leave it alone.
,T4transporter,2010-09-26T10:34Z,"Also got the error, but fixed it.
Very easy...
1) Do as described above...After installation 
2) copy all the content from the DATA folder on your DVD, to the program files/ETKA/VWAU/DATA folder...
3) Also search for 3 (almost the same) files on the dvd : upd7650.txt
4) copy paste these also in the correct folders 
- one in VW 
- one in AU
- one in VA 
- and to make sure also one in the main DATA folder

should work now..."
