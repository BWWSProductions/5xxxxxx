            How to update the program in the future:
            ________________________________________

            1. Download the update files for VW or Audi (for how to get a hold on the updates just use google..)

            2. Put the updete files here: 

            for VW    "x:ETKAVWAUDATAVWUpdate" 
            for Audi: "x:ETKAVWAUDATAAUUpdate"

            3. And then start the program and it will ask you if you want to update...

            4. After every update it will open up a webb browser and tell 
               you that, you don't have a login for ETKA. Never mind that and 
               just close that window and it will move on to the next update. 
               (if you have more than one update to apply).
