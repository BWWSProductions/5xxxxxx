people knocking your work with wild and untrue claims SUCKS

"
[V],s1r-n1mr0d,2009-08-19T13:40Z,"Thanx alot or all the SP seasons , greatly appreciated .
And as for zmacwhateverdaddy8 , why not contribute with actual upoads instead of pointless comments on other peoples torrents ??

Thanx again & keep up the good work ."
[V],McTav,2009-08-19T17:01Z,"@s1r-n1mr0d
no problem.

and i really dont think zmac has any brain cells. look at the file type you idiot, a "".avi"" file normally means its a AVI file."
[V],McTav,2009-08-19T21:21Z,"http://bayimg.com/baDhDAAcF

and considering i am the one who created the file and i have no software on my pc that would even create an .MKV file, i think its about due time you shutup and leave my torrents alone.

,johan34370,2009-08-21T20:58Z,"shut the hell up zmacdaddy8....

,Cronic2008,2009-08-23T11:04Z,"Thank You McTav for your for all your time and effort putting this together

I know its an AVI and you know its an AVI...like everyone else on planet earth can SEE it is an AVI!!!!...why would he change 1 file from the current format of AVI

,BacardiRazz7,2009-09-08T22:46Z,"Lol how blind is this guy, I see .avi Thanks again!"
,saidovich,2009-09-18T20:01Z,"Thanks man, people tend to be pretty ungrateful for all the work done by the uploaders on pirate bay. appreciate it."
,Septum_Drake,2009-10-02T00:26Z,"Ahh, the internet, one person riping on one person, then the rest ganging up on who is wrong :D, thanks for the quick fix for the missing file ^_^."
,anpe91,2009-10-07T19:06Z,"If you claim .mkv sucks, then give a fucking reason."
,kehaak,2009-10-11T14:39Z,Thanks again :)
,Sumsonfire,2009-10-14T12:20Z,"hi Mctav i greatly appreciate the work u do but i was wondering if it is possible for you to create torrents of all south parks in compressed rar format because they are alot easier to download and they are quicker and for someone like me whos internet isnt very fast it would make a real difference as it took me 5 or six days to download a single season 
 thank you for all your work "
,Esmad3,2009-12-20T17:27Z,"Thx for ul.

@ zmacdaddy8: It is .avi and .mkv doesn't suck. Mkv is an essential format now with br-rips and such, so you might as well get used to it retard."
,BigDownUnder,2009-12-23T08:23Z,"sumsonfire* I'll say again, you are a complete fu*king tool. You must be the only person in the bit torrent universe that trust compressed files. Get a life looser if your internet is slow upgrade your plan dont trouble the rest of us but bitching. "
,dolamic,2009-12-24T10:28Z,"blah blah blah, thanks McTav, I appreciate your work avi, mkv, mpg, vob whatever. get a fucking converter if you don't like the uploaders doing all the work for you. MCL!"
,dr.doak,2010-01-19T20:26Z,GOOD SHIT MAN!!!!!!!!!  KEEP IT UP! AND THIS FILE IS .AVI SO FUCK OFF!

,deancyrus,2010-06-24T15:38Z,"zmacdaddy8
you realy r a dick. How can you justify complaining about something thats free? I dont know where you live but where I am its a free country. If you dont like this file go find another or maybe PAY for it. mkv avi I dont care my pc can play everything!! Maybe you should upgrade.
