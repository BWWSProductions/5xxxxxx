It will be the oil corporations who benefit from the war in Iraq, while the American people will bear the costs for years to come. And let us not forget all the contractors who benefit from waging war as well. A quote from Dwight D. Eisenhower sums it up nicely:

""This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience . . . In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.""

and the follwing:

""The essence of war is fire, famine, and pestilence. They contribute to its outbreak; they are among its weapons; they become its consequences.

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the houses of its children.

This is not a way of life . . . Under the cloud of war, it is humanity hanging itself on a cross of iron.""

-- Dwight D. Eisenhower (April 16, 1953)

And second only to the 'war for corporate profit' racket and the military industrial complex that supports it, is this other racket which profits in human suffering:

The American health care, health insurance and pharmaceutical racket."
