"Living with Michael Jackson" is a documentary in which British journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Michael Jackson over a span of eight months, from May 2002 to January 2003. Bashir put the proposal to Jackson as a way to show the world the truth about him and "make nothing off limits." Jackson felt betrayed by Bashir and complained that the film gives a distorted picture of his behaviour and conduct as a father.
