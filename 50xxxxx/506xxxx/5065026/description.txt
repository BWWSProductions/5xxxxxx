Sorry for my former upload that had the latin1 charset and had special and foreign chars messed up. This one is UTF8, i double checked it worked.

This torrent contains every comment to all torrents in the TPB index torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5053827).

It is a MySQL SQL file, but is probably readable by other database engines as well.

Fields of the table:
id - primary key / autoincrement
torrentid - id of the torrent
user - user writing the comment
time - unix timestamp
comment - the comment itself

The script i wrote to create this sql can be found here:
