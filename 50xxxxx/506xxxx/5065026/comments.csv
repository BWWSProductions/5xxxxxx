it contains exactly the torrent ids that are included in the ""TPB index"" torrent

the source of my TPB Browser ... maybe i'll release it, because i've already got something bigger in mind.

Imagine a small windows application that is a web server and after you started it you can browse a copy of tpb local in your browser, probably with comments aswell.
However, i don't know if it would be worth the work because i'm sure some copies of tpb will appear on the internet nonetheless."
