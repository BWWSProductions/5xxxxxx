It's a 4.5 billion year epic, a story of unimaginable timescales, earth-shattering forces, incredible life forms, radical climates and mass extinctions.

**Warning**
My DVR didn't record the last 15 seconds of the program, so I added the last 15 seconds from a SD copy of the program so you will notice the video quality is very poor during the last few seconds of the credits

PS. This series is not suitable for creationists as it gives a scientific explanation for the earth's birth and evolution, ie. more Richard Dawkins/Albert Einstein than the Bible!


Enjoy and Seed!!
