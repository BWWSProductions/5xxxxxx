Wal-Town: The Film
2005

A group of six university students, calling themselves Wal-Town, take to the Canadian highway over two summers. Armed with thousands of pamphlets, flyers, and with one freelance journalist in tow, they visit 36 of Canada's more than 200 Wal-Mart stores with one formidable goal: to raise public awareness about Wal-Mart's business practices and the effects of the company's policies on cities and towns across Canada. Interspersing frank exchanges between activists and Wal-Mart shoppers with interviews with a range of characters from either side of the issue, the film raises challenging questions about the impact of big business on the culture of communities.
