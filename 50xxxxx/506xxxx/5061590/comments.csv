,the Peacemaker,2009-09-27T23:13Z,"3 Questions: 

1. Why is the torrent named Transformers 2007 720p BRRip XviD AC3-FLAWL3SS?

2. Why is the video file actually named Transformers.2007.PROPER.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264.dxva-EuReKA?

3. Does anyone else find this a little odd?"

Thanks, man"
,UvularCarp82,2012-04-03T19:20Z,@the Peacemaker   This isn't odd the movie is downgraded from 1080p to 720p!
