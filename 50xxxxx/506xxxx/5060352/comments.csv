,swamiolsson,2009-11-07T22:27Z,"Hm. It appears, that the original seeder BOZX has left the scene. All peers seem to have 98,1%. At present, I have 98,5%, but the DL has ceased.
Dear BOZX, couldn't You seed just for a day or two, so somebodey else can take over?"

Do you know what sci-fi is? have you ever seen a good one? I was actually shocked to see sunshine at the bottom of this list.
I would like you to explain to me how you can even call Constantine and Superman.Returns Science fiction??? you should not call something a sci-fi movie pack if you are only going to include only the worst years of the genre. you have a problem with Star Wars Episode IV, V & VI, and you must be the only person on the planet who thought the second two Matrix movies were better than the first one. Do all the real Sci-Fi fans a favor and rename this folder. it was a waste of my time even to open it, and there is no way I would use 43Gib for this crap!   "
