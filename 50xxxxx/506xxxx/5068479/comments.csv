Video quality is good, however, the aspect ratios of the files appear to be wrong. Show was filmed in 16:9 and the files, that I've watched so far, seem to be 2:1, which will make people shorter and fatter.  Not a huge problem if you can change the ratio with your TV or PS3/Media player but just something you need to aware of."
