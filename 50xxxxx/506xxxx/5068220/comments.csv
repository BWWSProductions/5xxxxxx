,chuckn16,2010-01-06T05:15Z,"Can't get anything to extract.. Win Rar or Win Zip, haven't tried 7zip but people say it didn't work."
,chuckn16,2010-01-06T05:19Z,"I'm sorry, this does work with WIN RAR..you just have to make it open. It wont automatically detect it as a win rar file."
,batshit,2010-02-08T08:42Z,"please, if you do not know how to extract an ISO file, then dont show your ignorance by hating on the downloader.  Try looking it up on Google.  You need a program like PowerISO to extract an ISO.  An ISO is an exact image of a CD or DVD so it can be mounted in exact proportion on another disc without loss of file integrity.  If you'd bothered to do a little research other than scream, you'd have known.   This download works, extracts and plays without a problem.
