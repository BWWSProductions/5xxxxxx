,MQFPLO,2009-08-20T03:33Z,sorry then ;)
,CBF247,2009-08-20T09:58Z,What Quadcore meant to say was that it isnt Hy Res but he greatly appreciates the effort that u put into uploading and I do too... thankyou :)
,aleela,2009-08-20T12:21Z,"And QuadCore meant also:
1) MQFPLO has rigthly put this release under MOVIES and not under HI-RES MOVIES
2) HDTVrip means that the source is HD TV and 720*384 is a perfectly good resolution for a standard rip

and thank you MQFPLO "
