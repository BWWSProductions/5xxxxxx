Another torrent that I have cleaned up and named the tracks on.


"Another underrated gem to get its first digital release courtesy of Radioactive Records. This time it's the turn of the bizarrely-named Federal Duck, which made its appearance on the Musicor label in 1968. Formed by banjo exponent George Stavis, Federal Duck (named after the Federal Duck Stamp Program which was enacted by conservationist Jay 'Ding' Darling and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934), produced this lone musical effort which, once you get past the absurd cover, contains a consistently-good album which is mildly jazzy, has some fine bass and an ever-present darkish vibe. There are a few upbeat mold-breaking songs (one even sounds like the Holy Modal Rounders) but generally a soft-psych feel pervades throughout. It is interesting to speculate as to how Federal Duck ended up on the Musicor label, whose other acts included far more illustrious artists such as Gene Pitney, The Platters and George Jones. However, the relationship was destined to last for just the one album, with Stavis departing soon after to form the Californian communal rock band Oganookie and then to record an eponymous album for Vanguard."
