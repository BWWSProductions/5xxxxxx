[T],sowingmyseed,2009-08-19T20:04Z,"Bearded, when I downloaded this from you, none of the tracks were labeled. They were only listed: track 1, track 2, etc. I went through and renamed all the files in the correct format. If you want your uploads to be clean, make sure that the root files are properly labeled. It should go Artist - Album - track number. Title. I really appreciate the cool uploads bearded. Thanks again."
,beardedhead,2009-08-19T20:18Z,well
[T],sowingmyseed,2009-08-19T20:43Z,"Track 1 should be labeled in the folder like this:
Federal Duck - Federal Duck - 01. Knowing That I Loved You So
Hope this helps."
