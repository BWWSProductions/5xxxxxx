1/3 - The Doctor
With 58 Doctor Who Confidentials already under their belt, Gillane Seaborne and her team deliver a trio of themed docs - a fast, fun celebration of all that has made Doctor Who a storming success since its rebirth in 2005. Companions and Enemies will follow, but this week it's the Doctor's turn in the limelight. What makes the Bachelor of Time tick? Why does he need reining in occasionally? And who are his own heroes? Expect frenetic clips packages (is there an octopus loose in the edit suite?) and fresh insights from nearly departed David Tennant. We also hear from Freema Agyeman, Georgia Moffett (the Doc's instant daughter) and "next Doctor" David Morrissey. Plus, John Barrowman is hilarious about the hierarchy of who has to run fastest in every chase scene.
