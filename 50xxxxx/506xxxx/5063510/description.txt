[b]Nathan Never - issues 1-38[/b]

Nathan Never is a black and white, Science fiction Italian comic book, published in Italy from 1991 by Sergio Bonelli Editore. It is written by Michele Medda, Antonio Serra and Bepi Vigna. Artists who worked to the series include Claudio Castellini, Roberto De Angelis, Dante Bastianoni, Nicola Mari, Pino Rinaldi, Giancarlo Olivares and Onofrio Catacchio. Nathan Never, the main character of the comic, is a special agent in the detective agency Alfa, in a near future where those agencies help police fighting against crime. Each issue quotes many sci-fi sources, in the gadgets, in the people names, in the story, etc. The main source of inspiration is Blade Runner.

Nathan Never, the main agent of a team of characters, has a dramatic background (unknown at first) and has to work to sustain hospital fees for his daughter, affected by autism.

His sparring partner is Legs Weaver, a character inspired by Sigourney Weaver in the film Alien, another main source of inspiration.
