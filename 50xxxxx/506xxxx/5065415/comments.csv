something beetwen reality show and action film.
fast paced stupendous spectacle without any substance."

I'm susrprised with this fact: it was the first documentary where I saw something about lucid dreaming, this one on brain power! Enjoy!"

The torrent is very well done and it is a great viewing experience. I do not fathom why it was necessary to RAR episodes 1,2 and 4 (over 700 MB each) when #3 was taken straight to AVI (only 350 MB). Seems to me to be overkill that ends up being counter-productive and not helpful to bandwidth consumption. But that's OK because I really appreciate the effort to share these. Long live BitTorrent! 
This four part series is an incredible experience. If you are a fan of the fictional TV series House M.D., these episodes make a great supplement to the medical technology shown in that series.
All in all, kudos to eddie1969 and thanks."
