There're english and portuguese (for french parts) subs for extra short documentary.

Filmed with a strong sense of compassion for the impoverished and an underlying hatred for the injustice which forces them into the lives they must live, this is one of the first works from Brazil's Cinema Novo. A poor Brazilian family struggle to earn a living when they take a job overseeing the livestock of a wealthy rancher. They move into an abandoned house, and their fortunes begin to take an upward turn. The father is duped into a card game with a crooked local policeman. The ranch hand protests, and a fight ensues that results in his beating by the cop. Despite being the victim of injustice, the man believes there should be some semblance of law and order and makes no protest about the incident. A severe drought has the man moving on from the ranch with his family to earn their living elsewhere.

ABOUT EXTRA:

The 20-minute Baleia the Dog (it's actually called How One Dies in the Movies, but let's not get lost in translation) is an oddly disarming short on the film's scene-stealing canine star, who gets what must be the most grueling on-screen animal death this side of Old Yeller. Humorously recalled by the bird who got roasted in the beginning, the film offers anecdotes on Baleia's fame at Cannes, how his fictional demise pissed off critics more than the human characters' travails, and, best of all, a reunion between director Santos and star Maria Ribeiro.
