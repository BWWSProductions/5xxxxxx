Chrisette Michele Payne (born December 8, 1982), known professionally as Chrisette Michele, is an American R&B and soul singer-songwriter on the Island Def Jam Music Group. She won a Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance in 2009 for her song "Be OK".

In 2008, Michele appeared on the track "Rising Up" from The Roots' album Rising Down. Michele guest starred as herself in The CW's Girlfriends, in the episode entitled "What's Black-a-Lackin'?", which originally aired on February 11, 2008. She also wrote a song for Tyler Perry's House of Payne entitled "I've Gotta Love Jones". The video premiered in 2008 on television, though the song is not publicly available. From May to July 2008 Michele embarked on a nationwide co-headlining tour with fellow soul singer Raheem DeVaughn called the Art of Love Tour; Solange Knowles served as the opening act. In September 2008, Michele performed twice at the Evening of Stars: A Tribute to Patti Labelle.

In mid-2008, Michele began recording for her second album, Epiphany. In January 2009, the album's title track was released as the lead single. Released on May 5, 2009, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 selling 83,000 copies in its opening week.

Epiphany is the second studio album by American R&B-soul singer-songwriter Chrisette Michele, released in the United States on May 5, 2009 by the Island Def Jam Music Group. Michele began recording the album in 2008. In January 2009, the title track "Epiphany" was released as its lead single.

Michele told Billboard's Mariel Concepcion that her new album would be "more upbeat and youthful". Her inspirations for the album are Chuck Harmony, Claude Kelly, Bei Maejor, and Ne-Yo.

Michele says one of her favorite tracks is the piano-based "Blame It on Me", in which she croons, "Blame it on me/Say it's my fault/Say I left you out in the cold with a broken heart/I really don't care/I'm not crying no more/Say I'm a liar, a cheater, say anything that you want/As long as it's over." "On My Own", Michele says, reminds her of her father. "I'm very close to my dad, but recently I've learned how to handle situations on my own, without having him step in for me, and it took a lot of me to be able to do that", she admits. Tracks confirmed to be on the album are "I'm Ok", the hip hop-tinged "Another One", the ballad "Notebook", "What You Do", "Playing Our Song", and "Fragile".
