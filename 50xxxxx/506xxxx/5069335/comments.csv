,linguano,2010-02-26T03:26Z,I think Keasbey Nights may have been made by catch 22 but i don't know for sure they may just have all of the same songs
,deegva,2010-03-03T09:42Z,"linguano--the original singer of catch-22 is the frontman for streetlight manifesto.  he wrote most of the songs on keasbey nights, and the band got big with those songs after he left, which (understandably) pissed him off, so he re-recorded the album, better quality, with his new band.  

If you listen to the lyrics on ""A Moment of Silence"" there's a direct, unsubtle shot at catch-22 for that situation."
,depento,2010-03-03T23:54Z,"Deegva- Close, but no cigar. The Frontman Tomas Kalnoky was originally in catch 22 when keasbey nights was recorded, but left to go to college. Then after he left, Victory Records was going to re-release it with a little bit of bonus material, and at this point Tomas was in streetlight manifesto and he offered to rerecord it as streetlight because he hates it when albums are rereleased with no new material. Everything is explained in streetlights version of 1234,1234. But you are right about the moment of silence line, but now they are on good terms. If you listen to him sing that song live, he never sings the line."

Streetlight manifesto is just catch22 without thomas... they literaly redid the album under the new name with out him as a tribute i believe."
