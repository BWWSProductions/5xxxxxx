,sanebutoverwhelmed,2009-08-20T19:59Z,"Thanks for this torrent. For clarification this is an English/Urdu script written dictionary and my software found no virus or spyware.

If anyone's got a dictionary or software to help an English guy learn to speak Urdu, I'd appreciate it.

Proud to be English, very proud to be working with guys from Mirpur and Kotli, Kashmir."
