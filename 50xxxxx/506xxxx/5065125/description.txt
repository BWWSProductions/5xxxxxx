From Wiki:


Helix are a Canadian hard rock/heavy metal band that formed in 1974 and are best known for their single "Rock You" from 1984. The original lineup was formed by drummer Bruce Arnold, and consisted of lead vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Ron Watson and Rick "Minstrel" Trembley, keyboardist Don Simmons, and bassist Keith "Bert" Zurbrigg. Their most well known lineup, however (and the one that recorded "Rock You") was the 80's version of the band: Vollmer on vocals, accompanied by guitarists Brent "The Doctor" Doerner and Paul Hackman, bassist Daryl Gray, and drummer Greg "Fritz" Hinz. This lineup has changed significantly since then, with Brian Vollmer being the sole constant member.

Helix have toured with KISS, Aerosmith, Rush, MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e, Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Heart, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Ian Gillan, and MotÃ¶rhead among others.







Over 60 Minutes With â€¦ 1989


Over 60 Minutes With... is the 7th album album by Canadian Glam Metal, Heavy metal band Helix. Along with past hits, the compilation album also included previously unreleased songs Everybody Pays the Price & Give It To You. Give It To You would also be re-recorded, and this new version would be released on 1990's Back For Another Taste.

Also on the album was Jaws of the Tiger, which had first been released in 1986 as the B-Side of the It's Too Late single.

Unfortunately though, the album had nothing from their previous album, Wild in the Streets.
