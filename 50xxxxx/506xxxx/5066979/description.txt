VueScan Feature Comparison

â€¢ IT8 - color calibration using IT8 calibration targets

â€¢ ICC - color profiles for scanners and printers

â€¢ Raw files can be written with VueScan and NikonScan, but can't with other programs.

â€¢ VueScan can write a TIFF and JPEG file at the same time, at different resolutions (i.e. one preview and one full scan). No other program can do this.

â€¢ VueScan can scan while the user is editing a previous scan with Photoshop. All the other programs use TWAIN or plug-ins, which don't allow this.

â€¢ VueScan is the only program that works with multiple vendor's scanners for a single purchase price.    

â€¢ VueScan can do scans that produce more than 2 GBytes of data.

VueScan and SilverFast are the two leading multi-vendor scanner programs. Some differences are:

â€¢ Supported scanners - VueScan supports 1200 scanners and SilverFast supports 289 scanners.

â€¢ Supported languages - VueScan supports 40 languages and SilverFast supports 7 languages.

â€¢ Universal Binary - VueScan runs faster on Intel Macs because it is a universal binary. Silverfast is an older PowerPC program that runs slower on Intel Macs (it has a universal binary launcher, but the SilverFast plugin is PowerPC only).

â€¢ Multi-processor - VueScan runs faster on multi-processor systems (including multi-core systems) on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Silverfast doesn't have multi-processor support and is slower.

â€¢ Number of scanners - a single copy of VueScan can work with all supported scanners, but you need to purchase and install a separate copy of SilverFast for each scanner you use.

â€¢ Cost - VueScan Standard Edition costs $39.95 and Professional Edition costs $79.95. SilverFast SE costs $39.95 and SilverFast Ai costs up to $424.

â€¢ Upgrades - VueScan Standard Edition includes one year of free upgrades and VueScan Professional Edition includes unlimited free upgrades. SilverFast upgrades can cost up to $304.

â€¢ Film scanning - VueScan is widely acknowledged to produce superior scans of color negative film

â€¢ Infrared cleaning - VueScan supports on all scanners with an infrared lamp, SilverFast doesn't support on any Canon scanners and on some Epson scanners.

â€¢ 2 GByte scans - VueScan can do high-resolution scans that produce more than 2 GBytes of scan data, SilverFast can't. This is useful when scanning 4x5 or 8x10 film.

â€¢ Ease of use - VueScan has a simpler, more consistent user interface than SilverFast, and is easier to learn, easier to use, and more productive for batch scanning.
