The year was 1957. As Rock N Roll conquered America, in Britain Skiffle was king. Originating from the folk and trad jazz clubs the exponents of skiffle used improvised instruments such as the washboard, tea chest bass, kazoo, cigar-box fiddle, musical saw, comb and paper, and so forth, as well as more conventional instruments such as acoustic guitar and banjo. This was wild music, British style, and it's greatest star Lonnie Donegan became an icon to the new post war generation. * All original recordings digitally remastered. * Definitive guide to skiffle featuring no less than 13 top ten hits.
