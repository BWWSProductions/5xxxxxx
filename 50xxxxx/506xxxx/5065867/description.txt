                           "ARTIE VS. SAL FIGHT"
                                10-31-2007

Another specially edited recall of a very classic Stern fight featuring Artie and Sal. Howard calls in Sal & Richard to discuss the statements they made on the previous days Wrap-Up Show. Sal complains that Artie seems to get special treatment on the show while he will get shunned for anything he does. Howard explains that there must be a certain pecking order on the show and that he should realize his place. Artie starts ridiculing Sal for things he's done recently and it eventually turns into an all out verbal brawl.  Sal bashes Artie's resume of comedy as well as his ability to be a decent human being.

The battle gets viscious and Artie threatens to beat up Sal and "fuck his children". This goes on through various segments and multiple days on the show. The arguing even continues onto the Wrap-Up Show and is just as bad.  Eventually after many fights there is a truce called between Artie, Sal, and Richard. They hug like homos and agree that they are all sorry for the way they acted. That is after Artie throws two objects straight at Sal's head.  Hilarious!



    ** DESCRIPTION

The show is once again edited down to only the arguments and there is a few little things I managed to create a quite funny rendition when editing the arguments together and added my own little touches to it.  I hope you enjoy them.  There is no commercials, bits, or unnecessary material whatsoever.  Just the build up,  the arguments, and the make up. All you need to relive this classic Stern moment!  Hope you enjoy.



         THANKS TO THE GUYS WHO REQUESTED THIS CLASSIC REWIND MOMENT! 
                   KEEP SUPPORTING AND REMEMBER TO SEED!
