Hey my comrades over there, here is maybe the first appearance of Dancemania S2 on the internet, as about 5-7 years ago I searched this one on several P2P like WinMX but I couldn't find it and seemingly there is still no piece of this one on the whole internet.

This one is a forgotten epic, my nostalgic one that brings me many memories of the late 1990s. Yea time flies like an arrow, like this one.


Dancemania SPEED 2 NONSTOP MEGAMIX, released on March 3, 1999, from Japan.
