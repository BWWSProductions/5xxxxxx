So, could you please give me a step-by-step, click-by-click runthrough of how exactly I get from downloading to using Sibelius fully, in simple English, please?! I really don't get any of the terms you guys use.. words like 'icon' and 'window' are about as far as I can go in terms of Computer jargon. Please help!"
,Nin2000,2009-11-11T02:26Z,"btw, I use Windows XP."
,dougaldog2002,2009-11-19T19:47Z,"Nin2000, try this: http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm

It's free and fairly easy to use.

BTW, BigDaddy, cheers for the up!"

Anyone having issues with this torrent should check the (copius) comments from the original here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4982145/Sibelius.v6.0.0.54-NoPE

Anyone new to iso's, torrents, or ""computer jargon"" in general should try the wonderfully helpful Pirate Bay forum - link at the bottom.

,MicStrong,2011-07-23T14:14Z,"Thanks for this! Yes, I first tried NoPE's version but got confused by the multiple files. 
This seems to be working flawlessly for me now after I think I followed the included instructions. I successfully composed a quick musical, saved, exited, re-opened Sibelius and opened the score for more editing, so looks good! 
The only issue worth noting here is: the serial code included was rejected, I get message ""invalid"" when I try to enter the one you provided. Now, every time I start Sibelius it says, ""Please enter your serial number"" - however, when I click CANCEL, it proceeds to launch Sibelius and seems to work perfectly without having accepted any code!  (Summary: perfect so far, just hope I'm not in trial mode. I believe I'm in full mode, because when running the program, if I click ""Help > Register Sibelius"" I get the message ""Since this copy is already registered, this option has no effect."")
SO, MASSIVE THANK YOU, LOVE THIS SOFTWARE AND THIS WORKS GREAT ON MY WINDOWS 7 PC!"
