I noticed a lot of ppl having problems with NoPE's multiple .rar version of this, so I converted it into an .iso file for easier use. It doesn't auto play so just mount in a virtual drive, open it and follow the instructions. I run EVDO internet at 400k upload so be patient and PLZ help seed when you get it. If I lose connection (and sometimes i do at full bandwith) I'll restart as soon as I can.
