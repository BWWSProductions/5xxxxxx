,iamshady55,2009-08-20T21:39Z,"Hey DACSTER, doing some google searches, it looks like that is #2, twiztid must of just forgot to put the 2 in, probably too busy uploading more awesome flicks.  "
,iamshady55,2009-08-20T21:46Z,"Actually when you start to download, it shows up with the 2 after HSM."
,DACSTER,2009-08-21T01:23Z,i know its number 2 it says it in the movie information above i missed it the first time i looked at it . my bad . and yes he does do some awesome flicks the best part of his movies is that when he does a movie like Star Wars or Harry Potter he does do them all if he can just look at his torents. keep up the good work
