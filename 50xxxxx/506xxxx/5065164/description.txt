If you've got kids, you need this DVD ISO burned and added to your "keeping the kids entertained" collection.  This is the same stuff we watched almost 40 years ago when we were little, and the magic is still just as effective on children of today!  Stripped out the menus and blabbity mouth Whoopie Goldberg monolog about political correctness and all that weak crap.  These are the cartoons you probably watched when you were little, I hope you enjoy as much as I have.

ENJOY!
