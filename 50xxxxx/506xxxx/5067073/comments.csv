,ShaqMeoff,2009-09-18T08:22Z,"doesnt work... i unrar'd it and click on 'TO350patch' to install but it keeps say it cant find the directory. it wont install in any folder

and whats more gay is AVG found a threat.....

""E:\Program Files\BitTorrent\Downloads\Tactical ops 3.4 + patch 3.50 enjoy\Tactical Ops 3.4\System\NatoWarpix13.exe"";""Runtime packed yoda"";""Potentially dangerous object""


can you clarify please? what do you mean unzip any where i want?"
,freeware-uploads,2009-10-09T01:01Z,"I tested it again and it works for me.

Try this:
1) Extract tactical ops 3.4 folder en to350patch to your hard drive.
2) Launch tactical ops 3.4 and than close it.
3) now open the patch and locate your tactical ops folder (3.40) and install it over there.

4) At this point it should be updated and you can launch TO as 3.50 version.
-------

NatoWarpix13.exe is an false positive."

,Rathyas,2009-11-15T02:28Z,"Uhm, this is a good download, so thank you.
I seeded for a bit.

But I'm having an in-game problem..
When playing, everything is moving incredibly fast, and I don't know how to fix it.
At first, everything was moving incredibly slow.
But I restarted it, and now everything's just moving overly-fast. 
Could you please help me with this?
Thanks again for the upload.."

,freeware-uploads,2010-02-12T19:57Z,"@Rathyas: Try changing the videocard inside the game (At options) and than switch to opengl.

And do you have the latest version 3.50? 
Did you use the patch?

,Hassuke,2010-02-26T14:14Z,"Help! I cant play :( when im trying to open the game ""critical error"" pops out :S It says:  Failed to enter Entry: Can't find file for package 'Announcer'"
,freeware-uploads,2010-03-12T17:52Z,"@hassuke:  I believe you need to clean out your TO cache.
Go over here Tactical Ops\Cache and delete all files inside it except cache.ini 
And than launch TO.
-------
BTW when you play tactical ops it is commen for the game to crash with some random stuff, just ignore it and launch it again. "

,Wolvie501,2011-05-05T12:57Z,"@ Freeware uploads, Thsi game is not regularry crashing, it would be just your release. Announcer crash will definiatly not be the cause of a cache file.

If that was the cause, it would go version mismatch.

I know because I havep layed tactical ops for years. There is one reason I dontl ike rips, which this one is, and that would be the reason why: Uploaders could of modified stuff.


Also, Why did you incldue natowarpix? Nobody wants that crap on a fresh install

It also needs stuff that goes beyodn TO system requirments + Its not enforced unless you play on north american ladder servers....

ESE is also nto required on most servers."
,Wolvie501,2011-05-05T12:58Z,"Do not ever rip a game, and put stuff in like NatoWarpix, or any costum content. Thats the reason of most crashes, couse a fresh install of TO unless CD is damaged doesnt cause any crashes. "
,freeware-uploads,2011-06-07T19:37Z,"hmm sorry dude didnt know.
anyways i loved tactical ops and i have played it for years and i want to share it so i found TO somewhere and than reupload it here.

but you can remove that natowarpix as it us useless :P
it also ends up with false positive (virus scanners)"
,StormtrooperZ,2011-07-14T21:58Z,Nostalgia! Thanks for uploading! Can't wait to shoot some heads off in Rapidwaters or Trooper =)
