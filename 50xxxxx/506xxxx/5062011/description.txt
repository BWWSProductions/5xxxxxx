iPulse is a system monitoring application that lets you peek at the inner workings of Mac OS X through a clever and visually compact user interface. Using iPulse's customizable gauges, users can monitor system activity such as CPU and memory usage, free disk space, network activity and more. However, unlike other OS X monitoring apps, iPulse takes up minimal screen real estate, and does so with a unique, informative and visually pleasing user interface.
