,TheLagosChap,2009-09-02T10:08Z,"Just finished downloading and checked the end of the file.

Is the end really the end?

There's no ""trailing credits"" (not sure about the translation, sorry for my English).

This movie file ends abruptly, no way to be sure it contains the end unless you've watched the movie before?

Anybody has a clue?

Thx."

,x3r0kool,2009-09-20T10:14Z,"@bytethief
ripping software is essentially all the same.  the clincher is the compression.  There's tons of free rippers out there, I personally use a beta program called rip-it-all that allows rips into several formats in selectable sizes/bitrates/pieces.
@bbloverfe87
Sounds like you got too much going on at once.  I assume you use Windows, so here's what I do (has yet to fail me):  Uninstall all extra media players except WMP (duh).  Next, clean up the registry, and install new codecs.  I find all my software I use at http://www.filehippo.com .  In the audio/video section, look for Klite codec pack.  Install, and you'll be cookin, franky"
