Release Title: X-Men Origins Wolverine 2009 BRRip H264 AAC-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)
Release Date: 20 August 2009
Release Length: 01:47:25
Storyline: When choosing which mutant hero they would use to launch the X-MEN feature-film 
prequel series ORIGINS, the creators of the hugely successful franchise had a no-brainer of a decision in going with Wolverine. 
Not only is he the most well-known and popular X-Men character, but Wolverine--as brought expertly to life in true leading-man 
fashion by Hugh Jackman--was essentially the star of the three previous X-MEN movies. As the title implies, X-MEN ORIGINS: 
WOLVERINE is the back story of the fiery and conflicted Wolverine (nÃ© James Logan), whose mutant powers include killer claws 
that shoot from his knuckles and a regenerative ability that allows him to live seemingly forever. Taking a few mild liberties 
but staying relatively faithful to the comic-book source material, ORIGINS follows Logan from his first recognition of his 
mutant powers as a young child up through his infamous adamantium rebirth and the total memory loss that would subsequently 
fuel his angry quest. Wolverineâ€™s story has enough intriguing details to allow for a grown-up psychodrama in the mold of 
THE DARK KNIGHT, and the actors on hand--including Danny Huston as Stryker and Liev Schreiber as Loganâ€™s half-brother, 
Victor (aka Sabretooth)--have the chops to deliver. Director Gavin Hood, however, opts in favor of cinematic razzle-dazzle 
heavy on John Woo-style action-ballet and CGI glitz. From Deadpoolâ€™s eye-popping swordplay (the action-adventure equivalent 
of Riverdance) to the tightrope-walk of a fight scene in the filmâ€™s finale, WOLVERINE is a blockbuster action film in the 
most fundamental sense of the word. While some might complain that the film lacks the storytelling substance of the first 
two X-MEN films, if itâ€™s bang youâ€™re after, then this certainly isnâ€™t a waste of your bucks.
