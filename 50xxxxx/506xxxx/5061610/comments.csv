1) go to http://beans.seartipy.com/2007/10/08/how-to-join-or-split-video-subtitle-files-using-subtitle-workshop/ and download the program by clicking the link.

3) Install and go to File -> Load Subtitles and select the english .srt file you downloaded from http://subscene.com/Millennium-Part-1-Men-Who-Hate-Women-Mn-som-hatar-kvinnor/subtitles-78232.aspx 

4) Tools -> Split Subtitles

5) Click Given Time and enter 01:08:37,715

6) Save the divided subtitle file.

And there you go, enjoy this great movie!"
,blunt_swe,2010-02-02T21:41Z,"great seeding. average speed 2.2 mbit/s

thx !"
,scottielass,2010-03-05T14:55Z,Just finished reading the third book of the trilogy and look forward to seeing this. The books are marvellous -- thank you so much.
,scottielass,2010-03-06T16:49Z,"Many thanks to marl1979 for the info on how to split the subs file -- the app works perfectly using your timing details. However, I didn't use the subs file from the source suggested -- found a much better one at:

http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3621216/man-som-hatar-kvinnor-en

Someone has improved the English grammar to make it much more acceptable, and it synchs perfectly with this movie download."
,scottielass,2010-03-07T06:03Z,"Well, just finished watching the movie -- it is terrific, the video quality is first rate, and the subs I found (see previous comment) are really excellent and perfectly synched. It is beautifully filmed, the cast is perfect, and no important details from the book have been omitted.

Thanks again for making this available."
,FRivera,2010-05-09T15:20Z,10x uploader! and 10x for the tip marl1979
,Nadrojz,2010-11-08T22:36Z,"Thanks a lot for help about the subs marl1979 and scottielass, subs were perfect"
,neforun,2011-04-06T13:59Z,"Hi, is this the extended version released on Swedish tv mid last year?"
,PrototypeR,2012-01-07T12:22Z,Thanks marl1979 for your explanation on how to do the subtitles. Awesome torrent. Downloaded at 5mb/s. Will seed. Cheers.
,Osceana,2012-01-15T10:38Z,"For anyone on a Mac that needs the subtitles (since the video is in 2 files), go here:

http://www.subtitlesync.com.ar/en

(I imagine PC users can do this as well). This website will allow you to upload the .srt file you download (get the one scottielass commented about above- it's good). Just click on the ""Split"" button on top right and follow the instructions on the right of the page. *NOTE*: It doesn't tell you this on the site, but after save the file it will show up on your computer without a file extension. It is actually a .zip file though, it just doesn't say it for some reason. Just double-click/open it and it will expand into the two .srt files you need. Enjoy!

PS: Audio quality: 9, Video: 9

Thanks!"
,amyrkur,2012-02-02T13:27Z,"@marl1979 would just like to say thank you for taking the time to include your links and instructions in the comments. thanks to uploader as well. been looking for reliable original man som hatar kvinnor for a while now and english subs were icing on the cake, tack! "
,matheus208,2012-02-19T21:12Z,"I usually don`t comment on videos -- my way of saying thank you is seeding so others can also enjoy.

But I must comment on this one, thanking for the tips from scottielass and marl1979 . The subtitle from scottielass syncs perfectly to this version and marl1979 tip of spliting the subtitles to adapt to the 2 files on this torrent worked like a charm!

Thank you guys!"

,ChakalOriginal,2012-05-04T03:00Z,This film is excellent. The rip can't be any better. I'd love to know how to convert a DVD into a divx or xvid. What free software should I use?
