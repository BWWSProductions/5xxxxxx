,jackfirth,2009-08-19T23:04Z,Is this a cracked IPA?
,dubster16v,2009-08-20T01:10Z,"just unpacking now, will let you know how it goes"
,segersta,2009-08-20T07:38Z,"@jackfith: Yes, this is cracked. Just have AppSync installed and sync it with iTunes."
,Clandestino24816,2009-08-20T07:52Z,"This torrent will not work!!!!
remove it now.
Same fake file as first one on site"
,Clandestino24816,2009-08-20T12:30Z,"Sorry! this app will work. but you must see there is twice as much space on you'r Iphone to install it. 
try it"
,swe-miir,2009-08-20T13:14Z,"Idiots, don't call it a fake if you haven't tried it. I'm using the first one that was uploaded but that was taken down because the initial seeding was very bad. Everyone called it a fake, so it was taken down. It took 2 full days to download but in the end it did.

This time around try it before you cry, specially if you have a skull... "
,wittdewit,2009-08-20T13:56Z,Werkt perfect. Dank voor de opload.
,shinouk,2009-08-20T19:50Z,Do you have to have your iPhone jailbreaked in order to install this app? Where do I find AppSync?
,segersta,2009-08-20T19:56Z,"@shinouk: Yes, your phone need to be jailbraked. After that you install AppSync in Cyndia."
,langsyne,2009-08-20T21:17Z,"I downloaded the first posting, works fine, NOT FAKE. Running on 3G 8GB, clear everything off jailbroken phone with cydia/hackulo.us/appsync installed, sync tomtom onto phone then resync music etc. Install Navigon Europe the same way - then desiderata which is best..."
,shinouk,2009-08-20T22:01Z,@segersta: ThanX for the info! Guess I have to Jailbreak then :-D
,DrMichi,2009-08-21T06:17Z,"hi. I synced ist with i tunes and appsync. when i started the app on my iphone, the program always quitted. can anybody help me?"

,weetux,2009-08-21T08:32Z,"Hi,

this app works fine for me, but there are only Western Europe maps and I'm from Eastern Europe. Maybe someone has TomTom version for E. Europe? "
,DrMichi,2009-08-21T14:13Z,@wetux : the solution is: move to westerneurope ;:)
,bartje100,2009-08-22T10:01Z,Works fine! Thanks
,pastortom,2009-08-23T04:48Z,"This doesnt work for me at all..

Been trying now for 14 hours..

Installed it and removed it 5 times already, even restored fw and jailbroke it all over agian..

iTunes transfers it alright, and Appsync is installed and rebooted on beforehand, but when I try to launch it I get the same error as every time:

""Error - [file /Users/srvTomTOmMobile/Workspaces/se/fsbb/iphone-rc/Munich/iPhone/Navigator/Classes/NavigatorAppDelegate.m, line 150] : unhandled gadget: T12050100(G11) T19508 (G119) T2736826(G118)

And Im really sick of this :P

Anyone got any advice as to what might help?

Navigon works 100% with GPS on this iPhone, so TomTom should work as well, appearantly theres some file error or something, who knows..

,omejeroen,2009-09-09T09:58Z,"Works fine!!
Werkt goed!!

Niks mee aan de hand, als je maar eerst AppSync download. daarna .rar bestanden uitpakken en naar iTunes slepen. Dan syncen!"
,.:rmc:.,2009-09-10T15:43Z,"thx! works great!

,broumana,2009-09-12T15:24Z,"Downloaded and verified working,

,spider2476,2010-01-29T12:55Z,"Hi There, i have just recently jailbroken my iphone 3GS, and this is the first ipa i am trying to load on the iphone and need some help.. i have downloaded the torrent and i have noticed about 32.rar files, each one of them is 1.44GB  data in it, am i suppose to load all of them on?? surely not..

i have installed appsync on the phone and im assuming i need to move the file on to the iphone using WINScp and then run appsync to install the file???

Any help would be helpfull.

thanks"
,spiritcatcher,2010-01-29T20:46Z,"Works a charm!

For all the nut-heads out there:

IT WORKS!! if it doesnt work for you then YOU are doing something wrong, not the app.

Minor skills in using the mouse is a must though"
,Zenedith,2010-03-08T20:18Z,There is no Poland!
,teusz84,2010-03-20T17:52Z,This is just Western Europe!!
