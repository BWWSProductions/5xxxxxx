,demonsxx,2010-12-12T20:18Z,"Contrary to the title, these songs ARE NOT 320 kpbs. They are, in fact, 128 kpbs. I don't really understand how someone could get that wrong, but if you're looking for this album in its best quality, this torrent is not what you want."

,CaptainXXX,2011-01-22T18:03Z,"*Rupert77

You are a fucking idiot. You have got to be the stupidest fucking Trusted members here on TPB. All you do is upload songs. WOW, thank you soooooo much to your contribution to our world and TPB, seriously!!!!! There is this thing called ""Google"", use it to learn about false positives. Please!!!!!! Do us all a favor and learn a thing or two about them, you dumbass!"

,MarcusHuddinge,2011-02-11T17:28Z,"I probably won't ever read the reply... but i'll ask anyways.
Why does it first say 320Kbps and then VBR?"
,rentatoe,2011-02-15T06:16Z,"Had a steady 1.4Mbp/s download, thanks!"
,ryan20fun,2011-04-05T18:23Z,"so far, GOOD Torrent :).
the problem is that ive downloaded 50.1MB and 63.8MB are hashfails :("
,xNinJa,2011-04-06T02:06Z,"@CaptainXXX
@demonsxx

These are all fairly close to 320kbps. While not exact, few albums are ever EXACTLY 320kbps. Do your math before you come and insult good uploaders. 

File Size in Kilobits / Length in Seconds = kbps"
,mw2nerd1998,2011-04-25T15:02Z,lol all of a sudden on 99 percent and all seeders magically drop out. then they come back! great torrent btw :)
