thanks!"
,Canadaguy1959,2009-08-21T17:51Z,"How about any of the other Philippine Survivor series ...... do you have? could you seed?

Please :)"
,quackdoctor,2009-08-21T19:11Z,"Canadaguy1959: unfortunately, i no longer have a copy of the first season aside from the fact that my upload speed is very limited."
,quackdoctor,2009-08-21T19:14Z,"tpb's upload captcha image is again not appearing, thus i can not upload the 5th epi.

epi 5 is all ready and will upload as soon as i can.

btw, survivor philippines is shown mondays to fridays, with tc on fridays as opposed to the other franchise versions which are shown weekly.

thanks!"
,Canadaguy1959,2009-08-21T19:56Z,"Thanks for your help. btw, have you any idea about the other SP torrents going about. They seem to be labeled ep 50-65 ... what's that all about ? If you need direct access to any of the American survivor series, I have them all 7 would be willing to share them directly via personal FTP :)

Let me know"
,quackdoctor,2009-08-21T20:31Z,must be from the previous season of survivor philippines.
,Canadaguy1959,2009-08-21T20:58Z,My question is ... why 65 episodes ?
,quackdoctor,2009-08-21T21:11Z,"there are 5 episodes every three days of stay in the island.

13 weeks x 5 episodes = 65.

tc is every fifth day (friday)."
,quackdoctor,2009-08-22T17:15Z,"please look for epi 5 on mininova.com.

i might upload there from hereon because i'm still having problems with upload here.

thanks!"
