Having spent the last three days watching crappy B grade horror films, to catch up on his website movie reviews, Charles (Simon Wallace) attempts to attend his first day of Summer School. All he wants to do is get his Physics class out of the way before starting senior year. Attending Summer School as well, by court order no less, are two of Charles' friends Dennis (Lance Hendrickson) and Steve (Tony Czech). Also his crush Lindsey (Amy Cocchiarella) appears to finally be noticing him. If his teacher, Mrs. Wickham (Jennifer Prettyman), doesn't drive him insane what lurks in the school just might.
