1888 Gold is a book written primarily from a Seventh-day Adventist perspective describing the message of "Righteousness by Faith" as presented to the Church in 1888 by A.T. Jones and E.J. Waggoner. The Seventh-day Adventist church rejected the message despite it's endorsement by prominent leaders such as Ellen G. White. 

1888 Gold discusses the primary thrust of this message; that through Christ, the born-again believer need never, and most forcefully will never, commit known sin. The book makes it's case through both Scripture and early Adventist writings, citing verses such as 1 John 3:9: "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for His seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
