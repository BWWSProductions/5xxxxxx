Don't you have REO Speedwagon's ""A Video Anthology 1978-1990"" by happy occasion? ))"

You requested a video anthology 1978-1990.
I do not have it, but you can find it as a part in this torrent:

,spotted_jackal,2009-08-21T06:20Z,"search the internet with this 

""a video anthology"" torrent

you'll find the same at torrentportal (there you can see the files included. I think the first one is what you need)"
,kvestantin,2009-08-21T08:38Z,"thank you for your help!

by the way, got your release and watched the structure of your DVD. 800 Mb of data in this DVD  is quite simple menu files... I would say, when the concert is 2,7 Gb, such volume for the menu is not SO reasonable ))"
,kvestantin,2009-08-21T09:13Z,"spotted_jackal, thank you for links once again, but you know, I could not reach needed torrent file at torrentportal for Videos. Could you please say, once you have seen it, what is the volume of file with videos inside it? Honeslty, I doubt a bit that 35 CDs with videos in good quality may take only 3 Gb of data like here:

Go to the site torrenportal.com/details/1760406/Discografia+Discography+Reo+SpeedWagon+71-08+%2B+Videos+%2835+cds%2C+192+Kbps%2C+covers%2C+ID3%29+by+FranLopez.rar.html"
,kvestantin,2009-08-21T14:44Z,"thank you again for help!

Think, I will check this download later, the only pity is that there are wmv files with the videos - must be not very good quality and pic's resolution in the end... (
But will check anyway."
