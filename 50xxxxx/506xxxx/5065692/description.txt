Total time: 46:00
Quality: flac + cue

This is the first Carlos Santana solo album. It features members of the Santana band as backup, however, so the difference between a group effort and a solo work seems to be primarily in the musical approach, which is more esoteric, and more varied than on a regular band album. The record is mostly instrumental and given over largely to contemplative ballads, although there is also, for example, in the song "Silver Dreams Golden Smiles," a traditional pop ballad sung by Saunders King. ~ William Ruhlmann, AMG

FreeDB notes: This is a fairly obscure Santana album but it is one of his best in many ways. It has great melodies and outstanding lead guitar. Just listen to "Cry of the Wilderness" and "Song for Devadip" and you'll agree that his lead guitar work is as good or better than "Europa" or "Samba Pa Ti". Plus both songs really rock. Other songs have a great mix of strong lead singing filled in with more great guitar. I loved listening to this album for 10+ years. ~ BH, Amazon.com
