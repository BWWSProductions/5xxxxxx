Starring: Benny Hill, Henry McGee, Bob Todd, Jackie Wright
Director: Dennis Kirkland 
Rating: Unrated

Never before seen in their entirety in the States, the eight original full-length episodes in SET 6 explode with the saucy wit and flamboyant humor that made The Benny Hill Show an international phenomenon. Armed with his naughty, nubile Hill's Angels and the adorable The Hill's Little Angels, Benny sails into new stratospheres of hilarity, whether it's with Fred Scuttle and his daily newspaper or Lana and her gaggle of Performing Men. Classic sketches such as "The Crook Report" and "The Halitosis Kid" show off the slapstick silliness that made Benny the undisputed king of comedy.
