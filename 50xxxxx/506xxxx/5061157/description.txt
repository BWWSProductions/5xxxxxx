Photoshop is the foundation of every digital career. It is the most pervasive technology on the market. Many users think they know it, but in truth they have gaping holes. This book covers what a professional truly needs to know about Photoshop to be employable. For students (whether in formal programs, certified training centers, or self-paced) this book offers a chance to explore the many aspects of the program interactively. The book cuts though the clutter and is unique in that it focuses not just on digital photography, but Internet, graphic design, multimedia, and video uses.

Readers will learn the basics in correcting, editing, sharpening, retouching, and presenting photos as well as work on specific projects/exercises, including: 

digital painting
preparing images for newsprint
designing a CD/DVD label, magazine cover, and advertisements
and building an electronic portfolio.
