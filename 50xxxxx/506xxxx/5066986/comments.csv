[T],verifire,2009-09-13T01:19Z,"@DevilPrez: Yeah, it would be really nice if people like you who fancy calling themselves ""DevilPrez"" could run around without ever being contradicted.. But I don't like religions either. And especially not devilish ones.

""Fuck"" this and that? Do you have a dick that's large enough, you think? What you're saying is called ""rape"", cause I don't think none of the above will ever let themselves be ""fucked"" by you. Actually, you'll most likely end up ""fucking"" yourself. But that's your choice.

Man, I wish I knew how to understand even guys like you, but I fear that I'm not supposed to. In this particular case, anyway.

Jesus lives. Deal with it. :-)"
[T],verifire,2009-09-13T01:43Z,"I am, however, downloading this. I like to keep an open mind to the best of my ability. I just couldn't help myself in the above.. :-)"
[T],jmb2012,2009-09-18T03:35Z,Jesus Christ!!! ................you talk too much.
[T],jmb2012,2009-09-18T03:58Z,"There is no God but Allah and Muhammad(pboh)is his messenger.

I was born a Catholic. After years of trying to understand it all, I figured it out. 
If you believe the words in the Bible as I do, you know also. Here a short explaination.

In the Torah(ols testament) is this

Isaiah 7:14
 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and  will call him Immanuel. 

Prophecy of JC's coming when Jesus started his ministry the Jews who knew better converted, and followed him

Now the interesting part

In the New Testament

Mark 1:7-11

Jesus says ?The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.? 

There is much more info on the but my bitch of a girlfriend is driving me nuts so go see for yourself."
,Phavonic,2009-09-25T06:37Z,"If you believe religion is the root of all evil your no more intelligent than the Nazis, its a scape-goat psychology. As much as I respect Dawkins and science he's basically calling a Jihad in his tireless obsession with Christianity and infantilism. He should just stick to research and stop making himself look like a fascist.

If you say Christianity is the root of ALL evil what other evils does that leave? I'd love to live in a world where a gospel negro (the only type of Christian in the UK) handing me a leaflet on Jesus is the worst evil that could happen. An innate hatred of infantilism does not make it evil."

the title was choosen by channel 4 and WAS not Richard Dawkins idea or personal belief, it was made to piss of moronic religious people like yourself"
,Rastapapulus,2009-10-25T19:40Z,"hey DevilPrez ... my name is mohammad, be carefull!! lol"
,Rastapapulus,2009-10-25T19:50Z,"RRRrrreligion or whatever is a way to live better, if it makes life harder then it's not the right one or is a fake
however i read so much about religion and i born as a Muslim, i love Buddha and Christ and all the people who talk right and leads me (us) to a good life. that's all i think without any one asked my thoughts!!
as a 1ONE1 person of billions people living on the earth i say ur religion isn't important to me but ur personality and behavior ... don't  waste ur breath to yell and to call others bad and don't be selfish ... i love you all and thanks for sharing ur files and ur thoughts :)"
,Pastafarian101,2009-11-22T00:31Z,"There is no God but Allah and Muhammad(pboh)is his messenger.

There is no monster but the Flying Spaghetti Monster and pirates are his messengers (ship - Shower Him/Her In Pasta).

1st Commandment of Pastafarianism:
Thoust shall eat pasta (the body of the lord) and drink rum (the blood of the lord) at least once every month in rememberence to him

The fool says in his heart, ""there is no Flying Spaghetti Monster"". Gospels of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Chapter 5 page 54

Disbelievers will mock and laugh at you. Worry not for they have not seen the wonders of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. They will laugh and mock no more when they are tickled in the bowls of hell, alongside with those virgins (oh lord have mercy on them!). Gospels Chapter 4 page 30"
,dudius,2009-12-14T16:10Z,"Dawkins needs to get more organised.  In ""The God Delusion"", he likened organising athiests to herding cats.  We're just too independently-minded.  We need to end this tyranny once and for all.

If there has to be religion, it should be the One True Religion of Pastafarianism (as mentioned above).  All hail His Noodly Appendage.

I find it interesting that religious children grow out of believing in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, but never seem to carry the logic through ...

Weird."

 u are insane. mind ur lang.if u dont believe in any thing so plz dont abuse any one.."
,kneebutt,2010-04-18T07:27Z,"Quality is okay.  A9 V8.  
What's up with all the vacant religious rambings people have left here?  It would be a pretty safe assumption that people coming to download this doco are not really interested in your dubious ramblings about Jebus.  But then again, I was blessed with an open mind whilst yours has been crippled by pretend friends and such.  Religion may not be the root of ALL evils, but it sure does inspire alot of stupid remarks from people who are old enough to know better.   
Aaaaanyway, I'm guessing you guys have enough to deal with, what with your figurehead being directly involved in protecthing men who fuck kids.  That's what you get for being a gullible idiot though, really.

Jesus never lived.  Deal with it.  :-P.

PS.  Baa Baa you stupid sheep."
,kneebutt,2010-04-18T07:41Z,"Oh, and to Riisaam - did someone have the nerve to swear while you were just standing innocently by stealing free downloads.  How fucking thoughless of that vulgar cunt.  
We're all adults (apparently).  If people can't swear then you can't come in defending your right to misinform and hate strangers.  Fairs fair (bitch)."
,crazysoccerman14,2010-04-26T10:30Z,What kneebutt said!
,IceHandFancyPants,2010-05-12T22:28Z,Thank you very much for the up 
,digdog10,2010-06-21T08:40Z,This is great! Thank you so much.
,Croix1979,2010-10-30T09:14Z,Thanks a lot for this. I am his greatest fan
,Blood4Blood,2011-01-03T03:52Z,Boooo to all the religious preachers.. Dawkins is a great man. Read his books.  Starting with the Selfish Gene.   ^_^ 
,joejohnson1236,2011-05-24T04:10Z,"to jmb2012 - your quote is from John the Baptist talking about Jesus, not what Jesus said. Just proving that Muslims like jmb2012 are full of shit too..."
,SoundBarber,2011-07-07T14:34Z,"Religion induces a dogmatic belief that we have knowledge where we have none. It creates a narcissic view of our place in reality.
This authoritarian idea displays in politics as a belief that the best state will be one that most nearly copies a model of heaven. Minimal change and max unchanging perfection, the 'leaders' being those who best understand whatever god or eternal fairy tale.

p.s. jmb2012 et all
Quotes are not a proof or a descriptive truth. Like the failure of Euclidian geometry to describe reality, dogmatic axioms are falliable."
,saikfawl,2011-08-12T11:30Z,Jesus did exist. He was a damn good illusionist.
,enyv,2011-09-04T19:21Z,"Shut the fuck up, morons."

P.S.Calm down, people. You're not going to change anyone's mind by a comment, no matter how right you think you are."
