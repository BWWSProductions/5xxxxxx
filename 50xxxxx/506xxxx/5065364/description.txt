Tony Robinson continues his quest to discover the origins of English laws, who made them and why.

In this episode, he looks at the period up to and after the Norman invasion, which was perhaps the most turbulent in the history of law. But in the 150 years from 1066, the legal system was transformed. This period saw the signing of the Magna Carta and the establishment of the three major principles of a modern legal system: independent judges, trial by jury, and English common law.

Tony demonstrates trial by flesh burning, visits a town where Norman ideas have inspired punishments for modern day Anti-Social Behaviour Order offenders and discovers how a muddy field in Surrey changed the course of international legal history.
