,gadyvdbx,2009-09-06T16:27Z,"Just like everyone else i'm stuck on 99,9%.
Please seed that last 0,1%"
,imploder,2009-09-10T17:37Z,"if no seeder shows up for last 0,1%
you can just open file in VLC player and check if it plays well, or mount it in viritual drive. Probably you vil only get 1 glitsh/picture breakup during playback. 
Jou can also unpack this iso with winrar (ceep broken files  in unpack settings)
Then you can burn this VIDEO_TS folder to dvd (use imgburn)
To bee on save side U can reauthor it with ifoedit (for fixing non vob files with errors)"
