,badprenup,2009-08-28T05:44Z,"looks good, thanks for checking for copies and such. One note though, if you have to rar pics because of file limit etc. It would be cool if you made like 10-20 even Rar files so we don't have to wait forever for the one rar to download"
[V],harry711,2009-08-28T22:13Z,"Hehe, sorry for 1 big rar; it was just easier that way, rather than splitting. Also makes it easier to open in CDViewer. I will consider making it into multi-archives next time."
[V],harry711,2009-08-28T22:26Z,"Hey guys; just thought I would also add, you can add ""http://harryy.us:8080/announce"" as a tracker of the torrent. If TPB's tracker and Openbittorrent's is not working for you."
,Dragonx9,2009-09-14T04:04Z,can you plz seed more
,Tarumbo,2009-09-29T12:10Z,"It's incitement to child pornography.
Please delete this crap.
Please"
,Tarumbo,2009-09-29T12:14Z,"Although several countries have attempted to criminalize lolicon's sexually explicit forms as a type of child pornography, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Philippines and Ireland are among the few to have actually done so.

PLEASE STOP IT"
[V],harry711,2009-10-01T09:07Z,"@Tarumbo: stop making retarded comments please, it is legal in most smart countries, if it isn't in yours, just don't download."
,foreveralone,2009-10-04T07:08Z,"add america to the list 
thanks BUSH u had to have been the single stupidest president ever...."
[V],harry711,2009-10-04T19:51Z,"It's still legal in America, and no one shall be prosecuted for it."
,Spawn of Chaos,2009-10-08T03:23Z,@ harry711:  Tarumbo is SUPPORTING our argument.  Get off his back.
,foreveralone,2009-10-27T23:40Z,"@harry711
goto imagefap.com
and search for lolicon
and read what it says"
,sevendarkdays,2009-10-31T20:56Z,"I don't see what the problem with lolicon is.

The whole reason the law against child pornography exists is to protect the children.

And i mean, this is cartoon, this was made by an old bald sweaty japanese guy that probably isn't even allowed near kids.

And as far as this being something that leads persons into actually abusing kids for sex... wel ljust look at how much sex crime there was in japan before they allowed porn.

So in my oppinion, this is just a way to let off steam and could actually prevent abuse as opposed to inciting it."
,danzzzzzig,2009-11-10T04:50Z,"@sevendarkdays

OK you have convinced me,I don't know what this is but I will check it out. "
,masonhales,2010-11-27T04:54Z,if this is legit i'll seed
,welfire,2010-12-06T01:37Z,"PLEASE GUYS, PLEASE DONT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT ITS CHILD PORN I CANT SEE 3 PICS FROM THIS PACK, PLEASE DONT DOWNLOAD THIS S***"
,tinygiantz,2011-03-06T20:10Z,"This is legal in America. It was banned by Bush and then the ban was repealed by congress shortly after as it is a form of art and not censor-able. I believe a couple people have been prosecuted though, but by law this is legal in America."
,neebworld,2011-04-27T11:48Z,"Ahh, who cares if it's legal. Not like that'll actually stop people from downloading if they feel like it. Thanks harry, looking forward to browsing. I'll be sure to seed."
,kopimiOK,2011-05-14T19:44Z,Lol to all who say it's cp.
,kopimi1911,2011-10-29T07:25Z,"Technically, although highly debatable, no actual real-life child was harmed in the drawing and production of fictional artwork called lolicon.

So I don't see why the fuss. Thanks for the up bro!"
,doberdad,2011-11-03T14:48Z,"If they consent & enjoy it, what's the problem?"
,skulldragon,2012-04-10T21:28Z,"This torrent has been up for almost 3 years and this is TPB, which can also be accessed via Google.
Altho, this pack contains few provocative pictures, this isn't yet CP. I hope. If it was, then Harry would already sit in jail for distributing CP or anybody dling this would be too and this torrent removed long long time ago. Unless this pack is specially planted by FBI so those bastards could FRAME people.. which is actually illegal, but nothing's forbidden for FBI, is it?

Possessing lolicon is indeed ILLEGAL in some countries. Google for ""Legal status of cartoon pornography"" and you can get a list of countries, where you can get hanged for possessing it."
