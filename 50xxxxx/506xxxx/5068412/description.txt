"Death, Sexx, The Supernatural, Nasty Little Sticky Things and Much Much More!"

If one man this decade can be hailed as the jewel among journalists it must surely be the great 'Kick Up The Eighties' correspondent - charismatic Kevin Turvey, ace investigative reporter with perceptive powers so limited he backs, quite unwittingly, into genius! Sporting an anorak that has left a subtle synthetic stain stamped permanently on 80's fashion and combing the back of his mind to bring us exclusives on such soul-searching subjects as death, sex, and the supernatural, Kevin Turvey makes contact with an indolent armchair Britain!
 
However, if all you couch potatoes really want to know the answers to these compelling mysteries you'd better look elsewhere, for Kevin is a dab hand at digression and has more important topics to discuss... like why Mrs Thatcher wears barbed-wire underwear and why 'taking it easy' involves downing a pint of Pernod!
