R.I.P Bob Marley - Legend..."
,Lenny108,2010-08-29T03:26Z,"This torrent contains a virus. Don't donwload. If you have good anti-virus software like mine -Microsoft Essentials - it will detect it, stop the download, then remove the virus. (Click: Clean Computer) Microsoft Essentials only comes with a valid copy of Windows OS."
,uniquefrk,2010-10-24T21:10Z,"The torrent actually sucks to be honest. 

I checked a few albums and they all have the wrong tracks in them (tracks that don't belong to those albums)

They are all in 320 kbps but what's the use when the quality isn't even as good as 128 kbps. They are all fake 320 mp3s with nothing above 16 Khz. Such a waste of bandwidth and disk space. "
,RanY2jith,2011-02-20T15:09Z,"He is watching up there. Rasta i will be missed seen? 

RIP "
,hopesdead,2011-02-21T05:12Z,Thanks. Already had all the Bob Marley & the Wailers studio albums (expect for Survival) and was looking for The Wailers albums to complete the discography. Don't have to smoke weed to like his music.
