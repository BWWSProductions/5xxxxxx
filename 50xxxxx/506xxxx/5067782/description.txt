Your Remote Backup Program can backup your files to multiple    
       local or networked locations on a given schedule.                
                                                                       
       Hard drive crashes, viruses and other data-erasing disasters    
       can happen any time. If you dont have backups you can lose      
       irreplacable data like digital photos, business files, tax      
       records, and other important information.                        
                                                                       
       Its not good enough to make backup copies of important files,    
       you need to place them in a different location than the          
       original files. That way, if your hard drive fails, you can      
       retrieve your important files from a network drive, backup      
       drive, FTP account, or even a web based email account.
