,Reptorian,2011-07-08T05:45Z,"I used to own this game as I was a roller coaster games enthusiast back when I was a child and I loved exploring the elements that the game supports even though it might not be great as the game Ultimate Ride or NoLimits, but the track elements and the puzzle is what makes it challenging to learn. It's quite a shocker this torrent isn't well supported. I do wish to be able to play this on my virtual XP again like I do with my old games. In this era of technology, one should see that digital format of running stuff is often more safer than CD content and one can argue that digital content would preserve more space and does less damage to the environment. It's quite bad that businesses does not implement the idea of getting people to download to earn money rather than the other way around  once a game gets too outdated. "
