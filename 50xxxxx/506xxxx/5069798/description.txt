   automatically on schedule from your PC to various storages â€“    
   network disks, remote FTP servers, etc. The program can          
   either mirror your data "as is" or create archived files or      
   directories for copying. The user can customize the method      
   of naming backup files adding, for example, the date of          
   archiving to file names. ABC Backup uses the zip algorithm      
   to archive data. It is fully gzip compatible (which is          
   important for GNU utilities users and in cross-platform          
   environments.) A built-in task scheduler helps you to build      
   a queue of automated backups, uploads, downloads, or run        
   third-party utilities to process the data before or after        
   copying/archiving. ABC Backup has no limitations on the          
   number of scheduled tasks.
