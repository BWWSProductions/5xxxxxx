Amil Khan investigates the spread of Islamic extremism in British prisons, uncovering the radicalisation and recruitment of young prisoners to jihadist Islam.

Khan interviews former prisoners and gang members who reveal the jihadist teachings that lead many inmates to join extremist gangs upon their release. He also finds out how prison officers are trying to cope with the problem, and witnesses a team of experts who are trying to 'deradicalise' those who have been seduced by extremism.

He hears from former prisoners who claim they were taught behind bars that Islam justifies crimes against non-Muslims.
