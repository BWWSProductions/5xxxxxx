Tony's journey has reached the 16th century and in this episode he looks at the battle over freedom of speech led by Thomas Moore, and how the monarchy finally lost its power - and its head, to prove that no-one was above the law.

We learn why judges wear wigs, why a tyrant ripped up the legal rule book, and about the introduction of independent judges.

Tony looks at the reign of Henry VIII whose marital problems cast Britain adrift from Europe, and changed the course of legal history with the establishment of the Church of England and the introduction of the Act of Supremacy.

As crucial as the Magna Carta, the introduction of the Bill of Rights in 1688 saw Parliament and politicians now assume complete domination over the monarchy for good.
