,11western,2009-08-23T05:35Z,"game works fine, so thanks. but towards the end the last puzzle says ""use the red key "" and all I've got is a blue one. searched every room,all are cleared except the marble one and the reflection room and there's nothing in them to use. 
anyone have an answer...thanks"

,ams49,2009-09-15T21:40Z,This was amazing - wish there were more like it!  Thanks so much!
,NIEWQL,2009-10-13T23:22Z,"11western, I'm in the same place now, and still searching."
,ToneZone,2009-10-28T15:17Z,"My apologies before-hand for inappropriate non-topic subject here but check out the game Trine.  It's available here on TPB.  VERY fun.

I enjoy these puzzle style games also so I thought I'd throw that game out as a suggestion.

Game on!"
,nishusain,2009-11-09T14:44Z,"Thnks for the game to Wendys99. 
for 11Western - nothing in that room - after taking the blue key go back to the dining room and there is a right leading to a new hall way - there u find the door to unlock with the blue key. hope you get it - happy playing"

,atropa29,2009-12-21T14:59Z,I downloaded it 3times but it's still the same: I still have only 2minutes left to play!anybody knows how to go through this?
,dign4roots,2009-12-26T18:37Z,"This one was challenging, the first time I had to find a walk through to help me out but it's now completed, the ending was the easiest part of the whole game! The marble game had me stumped for the longest, I didn't know you had to have all four colored marbles to complete it. "
,kinksie89,2010-01-02T17:02Z,Game Works Fab :D Love It Always Use Wendys There's Never Been Any Problems :D x
,kinksie89,2010-01-02T17:07Z,"the blue key thingy

i got stuck on this bit
theres a secret room just move your cursor over the screen all around it to discover a new hallway or room its hard to find though keep searching then u have to click the globe and find a place on it the keys inside there 

Good Luck"
