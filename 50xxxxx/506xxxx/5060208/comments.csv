Og jeg som trodde vi stammet fra apene."
[T],verifire,2009-08-20T21:39Z,"@ bodthedog: Yes, it is very much helpful in a way. You know; to me, such things are everyday breakfast, lunch and dinner, and then I relax in the evening hours with a little more ""proof"" of how wrong everything is when it comes to the accuracy of the Bible, and yet, right before mine and many, many other's eyes; there they are! The prophecies being fulfilled one after the other, and my own heart being more and more transformed into a loving, living thing..

I don't argue that ""This is proof"" for the Ark found on Ararat, I just believe it to be so.. As I do with the discovery of the Ark of the Covenant underneath ""the place of the scull"" outside Jerusalem..

Link to the heartbreaking and exiting video about that, is here, if someone's interested:

That one's narrated by Jonathan Gray, and what can I say? I've e-mailed with Mr. Gray several times, and he's such a humble and nice man. I believe him, that's all..

Thanks for being there, bodthedog, because it's good to have something to compare with. How in the world you are going to get through 27500 more religions before you die is a mystery to me, but I'm sure you'll try.. I'm kind of getting not only to love you through Christ, but liking you, on a personal level.. :-) Peace upon you, my friend.."
