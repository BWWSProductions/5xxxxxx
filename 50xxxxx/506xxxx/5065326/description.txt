Subject:: Factual; Religion & Beliefs



The Dead Sea Scrolls are the biblical find of the age - they contain the earliest versions of the Hebrew Bible, maps to hidden temple treasure, and insight into the mindsets of John the Baptist, Jesus, and the early Christians. But the scrolls were soon embroiled in controversy with allegations of conspiracy and cover-up, rumours that persist today thanks to The Da Vinci Code.

 
Most people have heard of the scrolls, but what do they actually contain? On the eve of the 60th anniversary of their discovery Rageh Omaar tells the remarkable story of the Dead Sea Scrolls and uncovers the truth behind the myth, discovering that their story is far from over.
