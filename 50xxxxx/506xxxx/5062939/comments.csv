,GeeBangkok,2009-12-27T01:18Z,"I am running windows 7 64-bit.
I have downloaded and installed this software and it all seems fine.
I used the ""SAVVISTA64.EXE""
Worked straight away, no registration or serial needed.
If I experience any problems in the future I'll update this comment so for now as the saying goes ""No news is good news""
Thank you FEARLESS1964"
