The curriculum vitae, commonly referred to as a CV, Vita, or Vitae, is a detailed biographical description of oneâ€™s educational and work background. It differs from a rÃ©sumÃ©, a one-page description of oneâ€™s work experience and educational background not only in length but also in detail. The origin of the term curriculum vitae is Latin and means â€œthe course of oneâ€™s life or career.â€ As such, a CV includes detailed information regarding oneâ€™s academic coursework, professional experience, publications ,and so on.

The process of writing a curriculum vitae can be an exhilarating experience because it generates a heightened degree of pride in your accomplishments as well as an increased awareness of your skills. Begin the process with enthusiasm and a desire to share information about yourself. If you approach this process with anxiety or uncertainty about its efficacy, writing a curriculum vitae will not be a pleasurable experience.
