LightZone is a breakthrough in photo editing software that makes it easier to edit digital photos and quickly achieve professional quality results.
LightZone is designed for photographers and differs in many fundamental ways from pixel painting programs that force you to
think in terms of pixels or use complex mathematical concepts like histograms and curves. LightZone uses a model based on the physics of light and methods derived from the experience of photographers
through the decades - in the field, behind the camera, and in the
darkroom.
