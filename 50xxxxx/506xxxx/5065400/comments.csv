,GRIMEYtheFATMAN,2009-08-31T19:39Z,"No.  Sega GT was Sega's try at a similar type of game.  The sequel was on XBox.

Will say I'm slightly confused by the description here - one image to install, another to play?"

,evillord77,2011-12-08T18:10Z,"Thanks for the upload, good speed, but I can't get it working, I wasn't expecting it to work 100% because of it's age. But, I installed it on Windows 7 32bit, and it loads the sega logo, then plays the activision bit, but only audio, the screen is black, then nothing, If I press alt+f4 it shows a dialoguebox saying ""are you sure  you want to quit"" or something like that. I was wondering if someone could help me? If someone can, and would like to, could you please email me @ evillord@live.com.au thanks."
