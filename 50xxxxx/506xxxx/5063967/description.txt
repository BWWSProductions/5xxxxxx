Jazz Jackrabbit 2 is a platform game produced by Epic MegaGames, now known as Epic Games..

Jazz has to chase Devan Shell through time, in order to retrieve the ring with which he planned to wed Eva. Jazz's brother, Spaz, are introduced as playable characters. The game features multiplayer options, including the ability to play over a LAN or the Internet.

Spaz originally appeared (as a background object) in the previous Jazz installment Holiday Hare '95. Jazz and Spaz have different death animations. Jazz simply falls on his back, dazed. Spaz burps and explodes, leaving only his boots. They each have a unique special move of their own, and Spaz has also a second jump as opposed to Jazz' propeller ears.
