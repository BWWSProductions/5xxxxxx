,piratesteve83,2011-02-17T03:00Z,"hi big dude.  i was just wondering if there's a trick to getting your games to work on a ntsc-u system?  i tried running your upload of king kong using the esr soft-mod, but it would not load.  i know it's not a problem with the mod, as other games i have work.  are your games ntsc (as advertised) or pal?"
