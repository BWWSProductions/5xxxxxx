Lights off and reclined seat, and listened in stunned amazement at this great concert. made the terrible mistake of not getting it from the BBC site when it was up. You did not make that mistake Sir, and I applaud you for it and thank you for taking the time to upload this GEM...this is what the internet is all about..Now... Headphones on...Lights off....travel back in time to when I was 15 and listened to it incessantly.. 10/10"

Glad you found it, flem."
