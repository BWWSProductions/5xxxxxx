The Cheat (1915) 


The Cheat (1915) is a drama film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, starring Fannie Ward, Sessue Hayakawa, and Jack Dean.

In 1993, the film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

In the film, Edith Hardy (Fannie Ward) steals charity money in order to invest it in stocks. When she loses the money, she turns to a wealthy Burmese man (Sessue Hayakawa) for a loan. He gives it to her, but when she later attempts to return it, he says the repayment he wants is her. When she resists, he brands her and declares her his property. Edith shoots him. Her husband Richard (Jack Dean) is blamed for the crime.

Originally, Hayakawa's character was described as a Japanese ivory merchant. Because Japan was an American ally at the time, and because Japanese-Americans protested the portrayal of a Japanese as a sinister sleaze, the title cards and the character's name were changed.

The film was remade in 1923 with George Fitzmaurice as director and Pola Negri and Jack Holt starring. In 1931 Paramount again remade The Cheat, with Broadway mogul George Abbott as director and starring Tallulah Bankhead.
