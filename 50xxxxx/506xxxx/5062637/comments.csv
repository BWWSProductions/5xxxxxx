,dead_whale,2009-08-31T01:31Z,Can someone comment on if this works in Vista?
,dead_whale,2009-08-31T01:40Z,"Doesn't work, much like most of Wendys99 stuff that I've tried lately. If they don't work, they either automatically launch wer (windows error reporting) , sometimes after a very long pause for AUC permission, or AV detects it as malware (perhaps false positive) Anyway I try, run as admin, disable UAC, set AV to ignore, they don't work And I have since found indications of rootkits through UnHAckMe right after some installations. 

I don't want to make any unfounded accusations and I surely appreciated the 
few of Wendys99's uploads that do work (mostly older ones) but does anyone else here have the same problems? Is there something i'm not doing right to get these apps to run? I'm on Vista SP2

PLEASE HELP or REPORT IT if they don't work for you ether ;) "
