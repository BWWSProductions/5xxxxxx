TinyXP is a "version" of Windows XP. It allows you to run Windows XP in a very small, and light, environment. Also includes Firefox and Thunderbird by default to replace IE and Outlook. There are many more features I am too lazy to type up. It is a very nice OS if your PC does not have much hardware power (and if you do not want to use Linux, of course :) )
This is the BEAST edition; even lighter than the 'normal' version. Should include most drivers you will need. If not, simply Google the hardware name, and the install should be there.


Burn the ISO image onto a CD,
boot up,
wait,
PROFIT!

No serial keys needed.


Burn and read tested on 2 different computers. Works swell, no errors.








Enjoy, seed please, and long live TPB!
