,Danneby,2009-12-25T14:34Z,Why can't I open any online server?
,Iceflier,2010-07-22T01:38Z,downloading now and if it works i'll seed
,naterzz,2011-04-24T05:54Z,"Downloaded, it all installed along with two other programs, half life and half life dedicated server? When i go to open one it gives me the message, Fatal error: Memory less than 15mb when i have wayyyy more than 15mb"
,YLJ,2011-09-18T22:37Z,"1. The shortcut that this makes is a false positive, go into the actual installed folder and click the Counterstrike exe that should work.
2. this game doesnt update well, this is the quasi v32-v42 version which is parallel to the v50-v66 current versions of the game, but is not the same.
3. i suggest you get the regular version from one of the larger torrents, though this one does have some interesting maps which you can transfer, and it also makes for a good version to use as practice, all the find servers appear in the favorites section wierd, but true."

YLJ:  I can't find the .exe file can you point me to where it might be or put a link for a working CS torrent...you seem to have found at least one"
