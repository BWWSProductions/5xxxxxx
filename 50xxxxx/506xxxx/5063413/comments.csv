,funkyDL,2009-08-21T21:20Z,"is this a unatural/zombie game or what ?

will give it a try."
,AceOfSteaks,2009-08-23T00:05Z,"shitty torrent,idk how the game works b/c of no install instructions......i've d/l about 30 games from here and figured out how to get 29 to work....guess which one sucks ass?.......fuckin douche"
,christhomson,2009-08-23T02:22Z,"This game is pretty fun, I've only played it for an hour or so though so far.
You bassically have an overhead view of a guy and you have to fight your way through levels with ammo pickup's, medikits.. etc etc... It's made pretty well. fully 3D, you can rotate the camera, blow things up like boxes and shoot through glass windows, and it has nice lighting effects on the torch.
Pretty good game overall."
,Ryuzen,2009-08-23T05:52Z,The game works but it crashes near the end of the game.
,djjjeeejjjeee,2009-08-23T14:34Z,rly good game...i just installed and defeated first boss...
,letmeon,2009-08-24T09:22Z,"Offence intented, you are an idiot.

There are rar files, so you extract them, what do you receive??? an iso. 

Since you have supposedly done 29 other games, what do we do with iso's, thats right we  mount them and install, and then copy over the crack. I didnt even download this game yet and i just saw the words pc iso in the title and a bunch of rars when i checked the file list.

The uploader just assumed the people downloading would have a tiny bit of common sense."
,funkyDL,2009-08-27T17:44Z,"well, easy to install. But the game sucks donkey balls. dont download.

U HAVE BEEN WARNED"
,AceOfSteaks,2009-08-28T06:14Z,"Got it from a better torrent and gave props to loder for his upload,now go fuck yourself in the ass the both of you smart asses.I had NO problems getting it to work with the other torrent.Great game btw but really short.Oh yeah,I unrared mounted and still could not figure this pos out so gtfo,and also it's spelled oFFense dick."
,AceOfSteaks,2009-08-28T06:20Z,"I just had to add I tried to get this fucking game to work every different way for three hours till I got fed up,mounted with Daemon but couldn't get a crack properly into the right place.Just had a prob with this one and felt it needed instructions by the uploader.So fuck yourselves again both of you assclowns,I had a prob with it and voiced my opinion.Internet toughguys,leave an address i'll murk your bitch ass you 12 year old faggot.That's what's up!!!!!"
,AceOfSteaks,2009-08-28T06:53Z,"Sry for the negativity,I was just pissed at the one poster.Didn't mean to get all crazy and sorry for calling the uploader a douche.Just had a lotta probs with this one.My bad :)"
,tunu,2009-08-30T19:11Z,fuk you.... sa-ti iau familia in pula
,tavener,2009-09-01T16:04Z,"game crashes when it's loading 55% =(

Help please :)"
,Et3rr,2009-09-05T19:41Z,"@AceOfSteaks, grow the fuck up and learn to google. Not even a 7y old child would take 3 hours to simply place a cracked exe in the game's folder.

@tavener, I had the same problem, but when I ran the exe in compability mode to xp, along with running the program as admin, solved it for me. Hope it helps. :P"
,blackhackers,2009-09-06T15:52Z,This game is fun at first.. but after a few chapter i got bored and didn't play it anymore.. That's my opinion only.. :)

""and also it's spelled oFFense dick. ""

,breid909,2009-10-03T04:35Z,"Its spelled both ways, offence is for the British and the rest of the idiots. Also, nofx sucks."
,Life-is-a-glitch,2009-10-16T01:35Z,"Got the 55% loading fix here http://www.shadowgroundsgame.com/help_sgs/SGS_temp_patch55loadingproblem.zip

But I'm now having map crashing problems. (crashes when the map tried to load from 100%)

Will post any updates"
,pollada,2009-12-16T13:22Z,"i have same problem as 'life-is-glitch', the game crashes when the map loads 100%.. any ideas? or do i just have so shitty computer? thanks for torrent though"

""offence is for the British and the rest of the idiots""
Im sorry, what language are you typing in? English? If they are idiotic speak a fucking different language.

Easy to install, fast download and overall good game, nice upload extremezone!"
,foxwilliam3,2011-07-27T05:58Z,"Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem and knows how to fix. I've installed the game without any problems. My problem occurs when I try to run it, it tells me that PhysxLoader.dll is missing, so I went and dl that, but when I make sure that the program can find it, it just says Application load error (0x02) and thats as dar as I get.. Anyone?"
