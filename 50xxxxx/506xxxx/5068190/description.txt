"Dreams" is a collection of short films that recount some of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's dreams.

Please note: I edited four episodes out of this eight-episode film ("Sunshine Through the Rain", "The Peach Orchard", "The Blizzard" and "The Weeping Demon") that I consider to be of inferior quality to the rest but preserved the original opening and closing titles. I believe that those who take a look at my edited version and compare it with the full original version would find my edits reasonable but it is definitely not recommended for completists. My apologies to such people.
