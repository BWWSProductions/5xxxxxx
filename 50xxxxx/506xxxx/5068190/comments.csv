Seriously? You edited one of the most visually stunning cinematic works of all time? One produced by arguably the most influential director of the 20th century?

IMHO - ""The Blizzard"" is hauntingly beautiful and the Dream which remains most dear to me, yet you just crumpled it up and threw it on the floor.

IDK who finds that 'reasonable' beside yourself. I'm so aghast at the idea I am even now converting my copy of the movie to ISO and will soon seed. I understand that watching a movie like this requires patience and open-mindedness. I'm saddened by the idea that anyone wants a shortcut to understanding such a complex and rich film..."
