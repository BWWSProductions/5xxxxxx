,ShineEyes,2009-08-23T04:56Z,"God, Google is your friend, people.  It's very easy.  You just think of what you want to know, type it in and BAM! Answer! Also, for the love of god...region free means REGION FREE.  Not Pal, not ntsc.  Everything.  No region.  Free of any region, you might say >.>"

,fisk1,2009-08-23T10:25Z,"This doesn't pass stealth detection for me, even though it seems fine in abgx. I've burned this three times on mac and failed."

,slothin21,2009-08-24T03:47Z,"I know everyone always says use Verbatim disc's but of course I decided to try and save a few dollars and go with Memorex brand and I just wanted to know if the reason why people use Verbatim disc is because other disc's cause the games to freeze. I've been experiencing this with a lot of the games I burn. I thought downloading it to my hard drive and playing it that way would fix it but I get the same results. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, did you  end up buying Verbatim discs? and did that solve it? If so I'm buying fucking stock in Verbatim :)"
,Sundive101,2009-08-24T04:38Z,People say Verbatim because of the old disk drives.  The Sammy and Toshiba would read the data off of Verbatim 99% of the time while off of any other disk it was about 15% of the time.  With the Ben-Q you could start using Memorex with the same success rate as a Verbatim.  Lite On has continued this trait.
,slothin21,2009-08-24T05:35Z,"Well I have a Hitachi drive and the games keep on freezing at random spots. I don't know if it's the iso or the disk, but like I said I even tried putting it on the hard drive just to see if it would do it and it still would freeze up. Super annoying! I have to turn off the system and restart.

,trickyhall,2009-08-24T10:45Z,i knw it alrady says it for the xbox. but will a verison come out for the pc or are there any emulators i can use to play xbox 360 games on the pc ? thnx
,Thebadfish420,2009-08-25T17:53Z,I have a Hitachi and BenQ and use Memorex disks and they work perfectly for me. I've never had any problems with freezing.
,LoggieB,2009-08-26T07:37Z,"I'm downloading the torrent now, but I'm not sure of the process to actually burn the ISO. Is there a step by step tutorial anywhere someone can link me to that can show me exactly what to do to go from a factory-new, updated 360, to being able to play this? I've done some Googling but the flashing of the drive and whatnot is confusing to me. Can anyone help and break it down for me? Thanks in advance."
,anthony073,2009-08-26T16:27Z,"every body says you neem verbaint disc's or something , i use philips dvd+rdl and they work perfectly , so why spen 10 euro's more?"
,AbioticFraggel,2009-08-26T22:01Z,"I always use Ritek discs DVD+ DL, to burn games at 4x. They cost about 8 euro for 10 discs. All i have burned works perfectly. It's not just what discs u use it's also about which burner u have.
