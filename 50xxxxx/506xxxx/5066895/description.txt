This is Family Research Council's revealing video documentary Hate Crimes Laws - Censoring the Church and Silencing Christians (2007) which vividly exposes how hate crime laws now threaten free speech and religious liberty nationwide across America. Hosted by Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, the program features shocking examples of how hate crime laws trample free speech, lead to arrests and censor speech. A real eye-opener for those who believe that their religious liberties are still unchallenged as given under the U.S. Constitution. One can easily recall Orwell's 1984 and how people were penalized there for various thought crimes which are always the end result of hate crimes legislature. This remarkable program will provide you with a number of eye-opening accounts on how hate crimes legislation creates a climate of "political correctness" which ultimately sweeps away the freedom of speech and religion. 40 min. long. A must see for everyone.
