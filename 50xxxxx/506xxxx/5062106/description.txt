â€œThe popularity of crime scene and investigative crime
shows on television has come as a surprise to many who
work in the field. The main surprise is the concept that crime
scene analysts are the true crime solvers, when in truth, it takes
dozens of people, doing many different jobs, to solve a crime.
Often, the crime scene analystâ€™s contribution is a small one.
One Minnesota forensic scientist says that the public â€œhas gotten
the wrong idea. Because I work in a lab similar to the
ones on CSI, people seem to think Iâ€™m solving crimes left and
rightâ€”just me and my microscope. They donâ€™t believe me
when I tell them that itâ€™s just the investigators that are solving
crimes, not me.â€
Crime scene analysts do have an important role to play,
however. Science has rapidly added a whole new dimension
to gathering and assessing evidence. Modern crime labs can
match a hair of a murder suspect to one found on a murder
victim, for example, or recover a latent fingerprint from a
threatening letter, or use a powerful microscope to match tool
marks made during the wiring of an explosive device to a tool
in a suspectâ€™s possession.
