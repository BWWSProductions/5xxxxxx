This must be another ""home made"" dvd !

Subtitles : [x] Russian ( not turn off ), What this Mean ? ""

1º No.  its the R5 DVD ( no bullshit )

2º it means you cant turn them off. thats why the other subs are boxed."
,seven0fnine,2009-09-17T21:48Z,"Nope, sorry this torrent does not have an official DVD as a source. 

The DVDs will be released 2009-12-01 through 2009-12-31 depending on region. 

Barbwier, I don't mind that you want to share your home made copy of this. But please stop fooling people that your torrent had the offical DVD as source, because it didn't. 

And your russian subtitles are home made and furthermore, they are hard-coded onto the video feed. This means that you or someone else implemented these directly on to the footage, as such they can not be turned off. Beacuse 'they' are not actually real subtitles files at all, simply text which is permanently imprinted onto the video.

Whoever did this, did not have the skills and/or patience required to make real russian subtitle files. So, what happens when you watch a torrent like this?

Well,the video plays as does the audio, then you have the hard-coded russian subtitles there all the time. If you want to enable real subtitle files, well then you have two subtitles at the same time.

And please, whoever heard of a region where the DVDs have only russian and portuguese subtitles? I suppose next you are goint to explain this by saying that you ripped the other subtitles because of space issues. Face it, subtitles take no room at all.

This is a fake, pure and simple."
