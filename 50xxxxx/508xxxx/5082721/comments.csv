[V],big_dad_e,2009-09-09T06:32Z,Thanks Ubehage!  Now about TPB tracker...?
[V],oldskoolscouse,2009-09-09T07:34Z,"Thankyou, ive been looking for this, top man.

i see you are a mod so quick question, what do i do about someone that is copying my torrents and reuploading them ?

Thanks again :)"
,TaddyPPP,2009-09-09T12:48Z,mny thx friend :)

TPB tracker is dead. No eta.

oldskoolscouse
You are happy that your work is being shared :)
There isn't really anything else to do.."
[V],oldskoolscouse,2009-09-09T20:29Z,"Fair enough, Im all for sharing i just thought that double posting was disallowed.

I also dont think its fair that someone can take the credit for my hardwork, especialy when there doing it with every single torrent i upload. it takes me 3 hours every week to get the torrent together and uploaded so its bang up to date, then this muppet comes along downloads it, then reuploads it as his own work the day after. something wrong there.

i dont think its just the tracker that has died, im begining to think the whole site is on its way out.

No worries, ill take my torrents somewhere else. It was fun while it lasted. R.I.P TPB :("

,gabriel2007,2009-09-13T16:20Z,"is this 32 or 64 bit ? , r2 ? ... I dont think it doesnt need activation , has somebody downloaded it ?"

This helps change hashing for limiting traceability if done right. He is doing you and everyone else a favor. No one here for limelight. "
[M],Ubehage,2009-09-16T14:28Z,This is 32bit...
,Korsen,2009-09-22T05:49Z,"I'm no noob to any of this, and this is just pure garbage for me specifically. The prog cycles ram usage between 30mb and 90mb, gets stuck at the install type selection screen whether I use daemon tools or an imaged DVD, and it won't boot into install after post, pre-OS. I hope this is just the version sucking and not more M$ bloatware torture. I was able to get it to go to the input serial screen ONCE which was a non-reproducible fluke. Shit. Looks like it's back to '03."
,Korsen,2009-09-23T01:27Z,"My mistake. There was a mobo issue I didn't catch. Installs fine as long as you're doing a pre-OS DVD boot, no issues, though it only gave me 3 days until auto-activation. I'll see what happens in 2 days (which is all I have left) - so I suppose i'll burn myself an XP backup just in case things go south, as they are wont to do in technology."
,the_law,2009-09-23T11:21Z,"Anyone have this in 64bit?  R2?

this is 32bit and does install without an issue or key.

Says 3 days till activation, but if i try to activate, it says there is a DNS error.

Windows update will also not update manually, i set it to go auto and will see what happens."
,Crazy420Ace,2009-09-27T10:03Z,"+1 on quality, thanx bud."
,Crazy420Ace,2009-09-28T14:42Z,"On first time login I can't get past the admin password login screen. I used Administrator for the user name and left the password blank, used Administrator for both the password and user name, but nothing is working here...

How do I get past this login screen?"
,Crazy420Ace,2009-09-29T20:07Z,"Nevermind, I didn't read... New password and confirm New password :D doh."
,markrl,2009-10-09T16:52Z,This appears to be the volume version no serial but requires KMS activation.
,BertKwok,2009-10-29T19:47Z,"This is NOT password protected! The reason people cannot get past the initial login screen is that the password YOU create has to be very strong including numbers and special characters.
    There is as yet no satisfactory activation workaround. I have tried most and none are very good. BIOS Em and OEM key will work, unfortunately there are no OEM keys for the masses. The McFly crack is piss poor, it basically turns the OS into a workstation/Win Ultimate version and the all important management console is gone. You can fuck about replacing the original tokens.dat file to bring up the server management console while adding or removing roles but it is a pain on a machine used for serious work. For the moment you merely have false bragging rights that you are running server 2008 enterprise on a gaming box or such. If you actually need this OS you will need to buy a license, have a look at how much and then see if your jaw is on the floor.
    You can rearm to give 240 days use before the install demands final KMS activation. Problem is most servers do not even get shut down in 240 days let alone reinstalled.
   The fun finished with server 2003."
,Corsary,2009-11-10T01:19Z,"How tha hell do YOU get pass the log on screen?!?

user and password the size of the world with special characters and everything and it doesn't work!!"
,spikemaker,2009-11-25T21:34Z,"its a ticking time-bomb which is set to go off in 3 days after installation. so i would recommend to u all down-loaders don't even think.
Ubehage; thanks for playing and wasting my time.
may be next time u get something better.
really annoyed me. TEST BEFORE U UPLOAD.  "
,kithylin,2010-01-06T08:23Z,3 DAYS LEFT AFTER INSTALLING THIS! CAN NOT ACITVATE! DO NOT DOWNLOAD! WASTE OF TIME!
