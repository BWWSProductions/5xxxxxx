,OrpheusDude,2011-05-13T13:13Z,"This is a really good quality torrent, HOWEVER:

1)  The 5.1 soundtrack has been dropped; there is only 2 channel audio;

2)  It is from a screener and the words ""PROPERTY OF MGM"" scroll across the screen throughout, although not that often;

3)  Subs are in Dutch only (but are optional)
