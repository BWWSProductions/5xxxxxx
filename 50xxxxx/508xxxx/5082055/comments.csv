True, tracker bugged...
14 seeds, 0 connected..."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-09-23T01:16Z,"okay WTF... lol

the movie clips are in Spanish('cept the last one which i English)... do i have to burn it to DVD in order to choose the English version?? sorry i have never burned, i just watch them on my computer.

another thing, the video quality is terrible. i mean, it equals that of a 700mb file. i have lots 4gb movies and this doesn't even come CLOSE to as good quality, like i said, its the same as a 700mb sized file which is rather unfortunate as it took me so long(and so much bandwidth) to download."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-09-23T02:29Z,"okay, i was an idiot... yes the English was fine when i burned the files over to DVD.

but the video quality is still rather poor( i mean poor in comparison to reg DVDr files - it's still very watchable)... the sound however is really good, easily a 10."
,madc0wdisease,2009-09-24T16:18Z,"Ugh, I hope it's not another divx converted to DVD5 and uploaded.  I've come across a lot of those today.  I would be extremely upset to waste the bandwidth on something I could just do myself with convertxtodvd."
,Daker9,2009-09-28T16:24Z,"Complete DVD but quality is poor. I've downloaded better Divx than this DVD. After burning the files to a DVD the structure is screwed up with menus that do not respond to my DVD remote.
A waste of a piece of plastic. Hate that!"
