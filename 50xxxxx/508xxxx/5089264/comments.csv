Great for bringing the internet into your lounge/living room via a big screen television!

The only downside is if you have an older type CRT television some websites are near impossible to read without having to use the magnify option, as CRT televisions do not give sharp enough picture clarity compared to LCD flat screen tv's. Not a big issue, and once you have learnt all of the navigation controls and tools web browsing is easy!

Another great Nintendo Wii torrent.
Enjoy."

Go to WII MENU> SYSTEM TOOLS> INTERNET CONNECTION to set up your wii's internet settings prior to using this application, otherwise you won't be browsing much lol!"
