HBO's newest cult classic in all its 24-episode glory! 

Plot:

Alan Ball, creator of Six Feet Under, has a sexy, scary new drama that delves into the meticulously-crafted world of novelist Charlaine Harris. Since a Japanese scientist's invention of synthetic blood, vampires have progressed from legendary monsters to fellow citizens overnight. While humans have been safely removed from the menu, many people remain apprehensive about vampires living amongst them in Louisiana.

A local barmaid, Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) understands what it's like to be an outcast. Cursed with the ability to listen in on people's thoughts, she's also open-minded about the integration of vampires. She is especially intrigued by Bill (Stephen Moyer), a handsome 173-year-old living up the road. The show introduces a slew of interesting characters and side plots the wind together creating two full seasons of pure entertainment!!

A Definite Must See for anyone interested in Vampires,  Human Drama at its best and the result of mixing them all into this wonderful Show.

As Always,

Enjoy and Please Seed!!!
