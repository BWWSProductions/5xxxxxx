,Viper_Bravo,2009-09-16T20:23Z,"@ Rondacss.   TB isnt a ""REMAKE"" of Twilight.  TB is based off the ""The Southern Vampire Mysteries"" by Charlaine Harris, first published in 2001.  The Twilight books didn't debut till 2005"

For potential downloaders- currently (10/15/09) that there is only 96.3% of this torrent available to be downloaded,  all of the missing parts are in season 1 (for me anyway).  However, if you download this, you can stop season 1 from downloading and still get season two.  Hopefully, someone will reseed to fix this, but if not, at least season two seems to be fine so far."
