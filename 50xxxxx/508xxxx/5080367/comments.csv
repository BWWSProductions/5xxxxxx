,pengouin007,2009-09-23T04:59Z,"Hi !

Sorry!.... Was installing in a another folder.
Juste installed in the same as fear2 and it works.
Sorry!"
,shinobiung,2009-09-26T23:28Z,the fool forgot to mention THIS IS THE EXPANSION ONLY ! ! YOU NEED THE ORIGINAL GAME. it means this game is racking over 20 GIGABYTE counting the patches and all the expansions.
,brianxxx,2009-11-19T17:17Z,"JUST ASKING...not trying to cause a panic or suggest that there is anything bad going on...

I got a virus notice in the FEAR 2\GAME\INTERFACE\VIDEOS folder in a file called intro.exe

Anyone else have this problem? Wondering if it is a false positive or something got changed along the P2P line. 

I scanned these materials before install and everything was clean. I had just scanned my system before the install, as I always do as a precaution and nothing was found."
,Torx8,2009-11-22T21:12Z,lol its your own fault if you can't figure out ON YOUR OWN that its the expansion only..
,serpentsminion,2010-01-24T01:12Z,"I got this one to work-  (pretty sure this is the one- it's an ISO when it finishes dl'ng)  Am runnin Windows XP SP3.  INstalled original F.E.A.R. 2 game and then mounted ISO  for Reborn.  Chose to install right into the F.E.A.R. 2  folder in the program files directory. Window popped saying that the folder already existed and do i want to install there anyways. Chose yes,  and it installed fine.  Planted the crack and it fired right up.  Can play Project origin or go to mission  menu and can choose Reborn.   Played for abit,  looks cool so far.  Good luck,  will leave seed for 7 days from 1-23-10.

,laitblade,2010-08-20T16:36Z,hey i bought fear 2 but im not feeling like buying the reborn dlc is it possible to use the reborn dlc from this and stil play fear 2 multiplayer and wil it work with steam?
,MoSu95,2010-10-04T17:09Z,LOOK: THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY LIKE A PATCH FOR F.E.A.R. 2: PROJECT ORIGIN - install it in the F.E.A.R. 2 location and PLAAAAAAAY
,vithu315,2010-11-08T22:54Z,"when i start the game it just a black screen then i press spacebar and it quits
any help?"
,telep_man,2011-01-13T14:42Z,"OK so I installed this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4897735/FEAR_2__Project_Origin_%28ENG_RUS%29_%5BRepack%5D had no sound, then I installed this and still no sond + I got a message Im missing content (think it has to do with serurom)."
,telep_man,2011-01-13T14:45Z,I ment SecuROM of course and the message says that I have to redownload the dlc so I could access the savegame data. So basically I got no sound and no savegame. What a fucking looser I am!
,telep_man,2011-01-13T15:29Z,"Eh, I got the sound now. As for the saves, looks like I'll need to play at the beginning of the last level I got to every time I start a new game. Doesnt sound too bad."
,BioHazard34,2012-03-19T13:48Z,More seed pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase someone
,BioHazard34,2012-03-22T09:39Z,"Thanks very much, it works great."
