                Synchronize your mobile with Thunderbird and Sunbird



BirdieSyncâ„¢ allows synchronization of your contacts, appointments, tasks and mails between Pocket Outlookâ„¢ on your mobile with Thunderbirdâ„¢ and Lightningâ„¢ or Sunbirdâ„¢ on your PC. Based on ActiveSyncÂ® technology and the Windows Mobile Device 
Center, items are synchronized  as soon as your mobile is connected to your PC. Every creation, modification or deletion of a contact, appointment, task or mail on one of the devices are automatically transferred to the other one. So you only 
have one address book and calendar to manage and you can consult and manage your mails on your mobile. Your information is always up to date.

 
BirdieSync is available for Windows XP and Windows Vista 32 and 64 bits, Pocket PC and Smartphone 2003, 5.0, 6.0 and 6.1 on "unlocked" mobiles with ARM processors.
