I can't find ""Let it Be"" in mono. It's part of the monobox. Will you put it out too?"
,stackerlee,2009-09-13T15:54Z,"I'm sorry. ""Let it Be"" wasn't part of the box.
Thanks again!"

Superb quality and clearly the real stuff with every album you've uploaded and also with the brilliant booklet. I know you've made a hell a lot of people very happy and even if not all of us thanks you in a comment, be sure that everyone would. Thanks again!"

,elektronikfreak,2009-09-13T17:07Z,"Many thanks for a GREAT torrent. All the albums in MONO and in FLAC! I wish all could understand that the real musiclovers prefer FLAC instead of the poor MP3. You are The King of TPB! The Fab Four Rocks after 40 years, really! "
,hegeland2,2009-09-13T19:44Z,Do you plan to put up the stereo box a well? Please! =)
,hartleyhare,2009-09-26T11:41Z,"Just wanted to add my thanks, a fantastic set of downloads, and with your brilliant scans and about ÂŁ2 worth of white card from Asda I've printed and made myself a perfectly good mono set - not sure how to make the box though! (I have bought the stereo box so feel no guilt whatsover for downloading the mono versions.)"
