,deamonmonkey440,2009-09-15T11:09Z,No its clean install
,romanmoga1992,2009-09-18T16:12Z,Can anyone confirm this works yet ?
,teobalan,2009-09-22T21:29Z,"Pentru userii din Romania:

 - este o varianta exceptionala pentru sistemul de operare Windows XP! 
Pe langa aceasta, este de asemenea exceptional, pentru ca permite butarea multipla de pe DVD, oferind posibilitati multiple de ""gestionare"" si reparare a calculatorului.
- unele dintre aplicatiile completatoare (Sidebar, Circle Dock etc.) sunt semnalate de unii antivirusi ca fiind infectate, dar se pot dezinstala fara probleme daca doriti un calculator mai sigur.
Interfetele (temele) oferite sunt de asemenea exceptionale, iar calculatoarele pe care am instalat acest sistem de operare functioneaza excelent (mult mai rapid decat cu alte variante), iar partea referitoare la multimedia este o incantare! Colectia de utilitare si aplicatii conexe este foarte bogata si bine-venita.
Merita tot interesul si cred ca un astfel de DVD nu trebuie sa lipseasca din colectia nici unui utilizator de calculatoare!
Multumiri uploaderului!!!! Pacat ca nu pot exprima aceste randuri la fel de bine in limba engleza, pentru ca merita pe deplin toate laudele si multumirile!!!!!!"
,Nofear87,2009-09-29T17:04Z,"I have a problem during the installation of this version. When the installation gets to ""installing devices"" the monitor flashes a couple of times then the installation completely hangs and it doesn't even load at all. Can anyone tell me what's the problem? why does it hang?"

,FlippoFromFin,2009-11-28T10:14Z,Please some1 confirm that this works :( I have seen 2 dudes say that it freezes after 30 minutes installing :(( please confirm
,Razorfootgryphon,2010-01-08T01:00Z,"I have the same problem as Nofear87. It gets about halfway though the ""Installing Devices"" bar, flashes the screen a few times (Probably video drivers) then freezes. 

If anyone gets by this, let us know!"
,Razorfootgryphon,2010-01-08T01:44Z,"Just throwing this idea out there, but I just started re-installing XP Media Center 05 and when it came to the Freeze Point, a pop-up said that the graphics card might not be compatible with XP MCE 05.

So, maybe the hardware is just no good for this Tweaked Version of Windows XP"
,zulu50,2010-01-09T03:15Z,HEY GUYS nOOB here i downloaded it and used power iso to view the files but when i click setup it only brings up information about my pc? so how can i install it ? PLeaze Help.
,XSYLUS,2010-01-19T04:43Z,AVG reports viruses and spyware inside of ISO.
,Ibwaheemi,2010-02-15T23:05Z,"my question is this (x86)32bit or 64bit windows

someone said, ""sometimes media centre sp3 crashes""

if it crashes on you you could install an sp2 version and follow the info on this link to get sp3
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itproxpsp/thread/25594f5b-953c-404a-9eaf-9c7e5ca063d5

also it could be possible you do not have 64bit hardware and this is 64bit windows"
,Ibwaheemi,2010-02-15T23:07Z,and AVG says lots of things
,FilePile,2010-02-18T03:59Z,"My install gets stuck installing network drivers.
Seems it doesn't know when to give up.
Ghost install works well, although it installs with fat32 (you can convert to NTFS easily)
Old boot sector VBS virus in ghost iso 1
You do not need it so you can re-write the iso without it and whilst you're at it add the registry keys to the archive.
Nice effort and a good upload.
Cheers (FilePile)"
,gianelli76,2010-07-11T14:58Z,Any advice on Automatic Updates?  I\'m especially concerned about KB905474 (Windows Genuine Advantage Notification).  Will it survive the test?  Other updates install w no prob.rnrnThis is a terrific op sys.  Had some probs with initial install (as noted by others) but I\'ve got it running in x86 and x64 modes.rnrnHope the originator will take the time to cure the install hangup situation.  It\'s pretty frustrating but the final product is worth the hassle.
,ndame121,2010-11-28T21:34Z,If the install freezes or gives an error that probably means theres something missing or a small defect from when the disc was written you should create another install disc using the slowest write speed you can i use a program called imageburn
,ndame121,2010-11-28T21:38Z,oh and one more quick thing u cant just use a program like poweriso and open the files on your computer u actionaly need to create the disc from the iso file which im not sure but i believe u can do with poweriso and then you have to boot to the disc in start up and it wont work if you just mount the iso on power iso either i hope this helped
,mike18xx2,2012-04-25T03:18Z,"FIRST RULE OF WINDOWS XP CD ""BUILDS"":

-- If they don't support ""repair-install"", then they are:

SHIT.

Why? A clean-install of XP is the biggest fucking pain in the ass if you have anything newer than a Pentium III, because you'll be missing half the drivers, and it'll be a goddamn chore to hunt all the fuckers down.

And every uploader who doesn't say whether repair-install is supported needs to be punched in the head until he shapes up.

(Been looking, for years, for a clear repair-install capable CD of Media Center which does NOT demand a serial half-way through.)"
