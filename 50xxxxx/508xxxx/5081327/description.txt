It is 1969 and business is booming for a Sydney crime boss (Bryon Brown). But things get a bit complicated (personally and profesionally) in his world when the Chicago Mafia come to town and try to muscle way in.

A really great film from acclaimed writer/director David Caesar, also starring Toni Collette, John Goodman and Sam Neill.

Much appreciation to anyone who downloads my torrents as I upload them in their
full original quality without any compression and with any and/or all extras!

And a special appreciation to anyone who can or is willing to seed some or any of my torrents for as long as possible as my upload bandwidth is only around 70kB/s and even though I seed the lowest seeded torrents 24/7 as often as possible so that at least all my content remains constantly available... my upload bandwidth will only stretch so far obviously... and I have alot of other content I'd like to upload!

So leechers... try to always be seeding SOMETHING when you're using your P2P software if at all possible!

Otherwise at least upload and seed some sort of content of your own.


Also, people can either leave me a message here or preferably email me at 
ndx689@australia.edu if they especially want or need me to continue seeding a particular torrent in the event that it drops down to no seeders for any particular title for more than a day or more! I'm also happy to receive requests for titles to upload as I have a large amount of content I can potentially upload if it's not already available.

I'd also be interested in hearing from people as to whether currently unavailable  versions of *Full Stage Musical Productions* that have never been released  anywhere on DVD or on TV etc. such as (JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR) -- (CHICAGO) --  (LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) -- Huck Finn's (BIG RIVER) -- (LES MISERABLES) -- (GREASE)... and several others, would be of interest to anyone for me to upload or not!

In anycase... enjoy this one people!
