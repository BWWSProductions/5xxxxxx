MagiCall is a smart tool for bidirectional calls filtering and SMS filtering. It is the only product in the world that can not only filter incoming calls but also filter outgoing calls. With MagiCall, you have the ability to block unwanted 
callers, automatically hang up on someone bothering you, and more! Stop anyone you just don't feel like speaking to at the moment from disturbing you. Automatically add prefix number in front of the original dialing number based on your 
rule. Hang up predefined outgoing numbers such as international calls. In addition, you can also take control of your incoming SMS Messages. Reply back or forward SMS to someone or launch an application when a rule is being triggered. And it can log detail information about all triggered events to the log file.
