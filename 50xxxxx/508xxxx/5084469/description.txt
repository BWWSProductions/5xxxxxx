The story of one board as it travels the world surfed by a group of friends.

Tyler shapes a single fin, traditional longboard which is then sent of to six of the worlds finest longboarders to ride in locations around the world.

Beautifully shot on 16mm film and with each rider narrating his own section single fin yellow aims to highlight the differing styles and approaches of the riders, all making what they will of the same board.
