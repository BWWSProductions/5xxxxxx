"Hold On" is a song by American pop band Jonas Brothers. The song was released as the band's first single from their self-titled second album in 2007. The iTunes music store named this single as #3 on their "Best of the Store" Playlist on August 7, 2007.

The music video starts with the band grabbing their instruments and playing them. There, Joe Jonas starts singing as they play instruments. Then while the second chorus is being sung the walls and the roof fly away leaving the band on a windy desert only with their instruments. They keep singing as the wind hits on their faces. The song ends as the wind stops.

In August 2007 "Hold On" debuted at #92 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's second charting single in their career (the first being "Year 3000", which peaked at #31). The single peaked at #53 on the Hot 100. It is also featured on the Disney Channel Original Movie, Johnny Kapahala: Back on Board. In 2008 the song went platinum.
