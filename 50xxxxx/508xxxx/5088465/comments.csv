what should i do?
I can't find an activation code anywere.
sorry for my english!"
,livingenzyme,2009-10-08T04:22Z,"Toonver, read the damn text file before you do anything and follow the instructions.  You have to enter the serial and product key and press enter twice.  The first time will come out error.  Press enter again and it will go through.  

Also, before you do anything, you have to disable your User Account Control, restart your computer, and then follow the steps.  If you don't know how to disable your User Account Control, either google or ask and I'll tell you.

This works wonderfully if you follow the instructions right."

Do this:

2- restart your computer and start AutoCAD again
3- do the keygen thing and it will work. Do not forget to click on 'Mem Patch' FIRST before entering the Request code. Once the 'succeed' pop-up windows appears copy in the request code

I had trouble at first with the whole ""are you sure your an administrator..."" thing but going to Control>User Accounts and Family...>User Accounts>Change User Account Control Settings> and setting the slider to the bottom (Never Notify) then reboot worked fine.  Just make sure you follow the steps in the readme exactly and run the ""MemPatch"" before you paste the request code into AC.  

I believe right clicking on the KeyGen and running it as administrator would probably work as well to avoid the ""are you sure...."" error code as well.

Good luck and seed!
