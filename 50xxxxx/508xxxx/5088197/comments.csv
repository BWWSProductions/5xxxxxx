,pafbrown,2009-09-15T10:56Z,"Hey 80z as ever thanks for the brilliant uploads. Was wondering if you had either of these two rarities, Landscape - Manhattan Boogie Woogie or Cabaret Voltaire - Groovy Laidback and Nasty both proving hard to track down, used to have both on cassette back in the day...."

Thanks!"

,white_arcades,2009-09-19T01:13Z,"Hiya Dan, cheers for another great upload. I wonder if the Rough Trade record label took its name from this band?!!
Just in case you miss my email, I've uploaded some new torrents finally. There's a great Documentary DVD called Souvenir - The OMD story on there, highly recommended mate."
