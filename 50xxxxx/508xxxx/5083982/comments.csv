,Flytrap0,2009-09-13T10:34Z,Delph 2010! I'm all over this like a rash... thanks Marias... I'll give you hugs once I know that it works!
,MariasLove,2009-09-13T22:15Z,It works :)
,Flytrap0,2009-09-15T03:10Z,"Okay... here is my reportback:
Embarcadeo RAD Studio (aka Delphi/C++Builder 2010) works. 247 days left on slip license as of today.
Delphi Prism also works, using the license (doesn't appear to have an expiry)

Win32, WCF Web Services (.NET 3.5) all in Object Pascal... all in one download!

I wonder if everything just stops working after the slip license expires... hopefully somebody comes up with a crack before then.

Thanks MariasLove... I can truely confirm that it all works!"
,Flytrap0,2009-09-15T03:12Z,"... and oh, yes... I am seeding for all I am worth 8-)"
,MariasLove,2009-09-15T08:59Z,"Flytrap0, Do you mean 347 days?"
,Flytrap0,2009-09-17T04:31Z,"I beg your pardon... yes, I meant 347 days."
,MariasLove,2009-09-17T08:38Z,Did you load the slip file provided?
,Tsingiska,2009-10-23T19:13Z,"Works beautifully on Windows 7 RC x64. Thank you very much for the upload.

I wasn't sure what to do with the .slip file so I just copied it into the License folder under the folder where the Studio was installed. I then duplicated the file and replaced the existing, differently named .slip file (that the installer placed there) with this copy. Probably one of these steps wasn't necessary but I wanted to be sure. Works perfectly."
,mawst,2009-10-30T22:47Z,Thanks!
,Cloud737,2009-11-01T23:06Z,"Thank you very much for this! I've been looking everywhere for it (the 2010 edition) and couldn't find it.
You should add 2010 to the name of the torrent, so people should know. Otherwise, they'll just pass by thinking it must be an older version. :P

Anyway, I have installed it and registered it using the slip file, and it worked fine and perfect until I installed the updates for it. Now, every time I load it, it closes at the splash screen and pops up Firefox and sends me to http://www.embarcadero.com/products/how-to-buy-map. This is after I'm redirected from http://installers.codegear.com/tamper?Version=xx.x.xxxx.xxxxx&Code=xxxxxxxx (where x is a digit; I prefer not to put the actual URL out of privacy concerns), so I'm thinking that the RAD Studio IDE actually detected that I'm using an ""unregistered"" version.
Sure enough, I check ""bdsreg.exe"" in the ""bin"" subdirectory of RAD Studio's install path, tried to re-register it again and it says that ""Selected activation file cannot activate this product."" I'm guessing it got wise to me, eh?

Did this happen to anyone else here? Has anyone found any workarounds? Does anyone know where to find other .slip files?

Anyway, as a general warning to anyone that tries, don't download the update files (the help update is fine I think, just make sure you don't install ""RAD Studio 2010 Update 1""). If you do, you might have to uninstall and reinstall RAD Studio again, or look for another crack."
,Cloud737,2009-11-01T23:44Z,"Yup, it's the ""Update 1"" (not ""Help Update"") pack, it seems. I've looked at the details for it, and it seems ALL it fixes is the license management/registration system (i.e.: totally useless).

I'll try uninstalling and reinstalling it and then downloading the Help Update pack again and see if it works."
,MariasLove,2009-11-04T11:20Z,I'm afraid it doesn't work anymore if you install the update. I believe that the update only included licence changes not fixes.
,MariasLove,2009-11-04T11:21Z,Have changed the torrent name to include 2010
,Cloud737,2009-11-09T18:14Z,"[sorry about that one last message, that was me, I wanted to see if I can post comments; I think I finally figured out why I can't post my comment: it's too long! Breaking it up into multiple parts]

Well, I've gone and done that, and surprisingly, the program behave differently this time, but not really as expected.
It started asking me about registration again (as it should have like when first installing), it accepted the .slip file, but then when the registration window closed, another window opened saying that the product couldn't be registered and asking me if I want to do it again. Needless to say, the second time went exactly as the first, leaving me no option but to say ""No"" on the next screen.

I then ran Delphi Distiller and cleared out all registration information - nothing. I then saw that, unlike last time (after I installed the Update 1 pack), the check box to remove the RAD Studio 2010 license check wasn't grayed out, and so I activated it... and voila! It now works completely, and on top of that, at the splash screen, the products that appear just say ""Registered"" underneath, but don't say anything about the days remaining (I take it as ""Unlimited Use""). :D"
,Cloud737,2009-11-09T18:14Z,"After a reboot, however, it started acting up again. I then proceeded with a full uninstall complete with a total wipe of directories containing the words CodeGear, Embarcadero or Borland (I think all of them were in C:\ProgramData\ (hidden) and in C:\Users\) as well as cleaning up all temporary files in C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\Temp (remember to replace [your username] with your username :P).
After that I reinstalled and instead of using the .slip file, I used Delphi Distiller (which also eliminates that ""x days left"" message and timebomb), and everything works beautifully even after one week of use.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my experiences with everyone so you know what to expect and what you can do.

Hope all this info was of great help! :D"

,Cloud737,2009-11-25T01:31Z,"I've doubled checked the file on virus total, and it's as you say, Renegado0.
However, looking closely at what AVs have detected it and what it detected, I find it likely to believe it is a false positive. I see most using heuristics, which are infamous for finding false positives everywhere.

Also, among the AVs that did find a virus, only Kaspersky, McAfee+Artemis (though not vanilla McAfee) and Panda are ""serious"" AVs, if you can call Panda serious (popular, yeah, but serious... I'm on the fence here).
Symantec, TrendMicro, BitDefender, Avast, AVG and McAfee didn't saw anything, and these are pretty big players.
So, I pretty much believe this is a false positive.

In any case, neither Prodel (ProDelphi Profiler) or InstallAware are installed along with RAD Studio, you have to install them manually, so I would see little reason to believe someone would install a virus there.

Also, I've been using this for a good month or so now, and I haven't found any problem or virus on my computer, so I think it's safe."

Hi XXX, that is a false alert, which I have discocered one week ago. If I compile the file, there is no virus. If I pack the file with ASPack, AVIRA virus scanner alerts. I do the same procedure for all other DLL's and this does not happen. If you download the newest version from my web server, you get the file uncompressed and without alert. By the way, which virus scanner do you use ? Kindest regards -XXXXXX"
