,tpbsuxx,2009-09-11T12:54Z,what's the point of remasters if it's to be shitty lossy mp3?
,flixit61,2009-09-11T16:41Z,"I agree, what's the point with mp3 format for the remastered collection!!!?? FLAC is the only way forward for these classic albums!"

[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-09-11T19:37Z,"Now we know it,

here they are, the long awaited Beatles-remasterings.

The Album ""Yellow Submarine Song Track"" already intrigued us in 1999, isn't it???
What a disappointment for those expecting sonic enhancements in such manner, at least for the new stereo versions.
I've only listened to ""Revolver"", ""Pepper"" and ""Abbey Road"" but what i heard made me angry:

Here some random noise reduction at free spaces, there one iota more trebble and one mircron more basic tone (BTW only distinguishable in an A-B comparison) - thats all? Four years of production time wasted for what?
Oh well - it is louder now - fantastic!!
Not even to some extent they made efforts in correcting some wimpy stereo effects (e.g.: ""Eleanor Rigby"").
Indeed, as well as  n o t h i n g  had been done and i'm glad not having ordered any Album of this new shit.

Personally i'm not willing to pay 180? for somewhat that everybody can correct with some 2%-tweaking on his Amplifier."

Yes, the remastering process used a 24 bit 192 Khz A/D converter off the master tapes, but after all the processing of digital copy with the 'great resolution', they got compressed to standard CD resolution. Thus, a 256 or 320 MP3 should be fine for the collection."
,bullwinkl,2009-09-11T23:37Z,I'm waiting on someone to release a large torrent with ISOs for the original discs so that people can work with everything individually to their own tastes...anyone care to do it?

Though you try hard to come off as someone who knows what they're talking about, in order to be condescending, you obviously don't have a clue.

Look up some info on data rates and then listen with your own ears to a well-mastered CD and an MP3 from that CD at best quality. If you can't tell a difference, good for you, you never need to bother with anything more than MP3.

I can tell the difference everytime. MP3 is great for my iPod, but the sound will never match that of the higher data rate.

You probably can't tell the difference between Hi-Def video on Blu-Ray disc vs a 2 GB downloaded file of the same movie. Again, good for you, but there's a world of difference if you've got good taste."
