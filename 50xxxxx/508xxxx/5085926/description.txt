Ravenloft: Dominion - Black Crusade - Ari Marmell

As Jerusalem falls to the soldiers of the First Crusade, the Laginate Grimoire exercises its influence on a population already mad with the terror of the sacking of the Holy City. Diederic de Wyndt realizes the Grimoire's influence on his companion, Father Lambrecht, too late -- but not so late as to keep Lambrecht from trial for his crimes. The sentence rendered is death, but as Lambrecht and the Grimoire are swallowed by flames, the Mists of Ravenloft choose their victim and seize him into the previously unknown domain of Malosia. Diederic chooses vengeance over wiser actions and follows Lambrecht into the Mists, beginning a tale of adventure, blood, and revenge that moves from Earth to Malosia and back again.

Note: This was to be the first in a new line of Ravenloft novels (Ravenloft: Dominion) but it never saw print!
