,fuctup.rm,2009-12-21T07:34Z,"In response to BostonSteve, I too tried this on Server 2003 R2, and it worked like a charm for me.

Reminds me of an old joke - What's better than winning gold at the Special Olympics?

Not being retarded!"
,mustafa-crap,2010-01-15T09:30Z,I found that only the WGA Validation Patch v1.9.9.1 would work for me.
,wassall,2010-02-16T18:03Z,"To all those who need help:

Anti-Virus's don't like cracks/keygens etc. So either tempoary disable your anti-virus (Not recommended) or Stop checking of the download folder (The one your downloaded torrents go into) This option is recommended...

Also you can download a registry updater that tells windows that office is genuine...."
,gmanny,2010-06-27T17:32Z,"And I've found that only AntiWPA v3.4.6 would work for me.

(I've tried 1.9.9.1, and AntiWPA v3.3 before, and both of them failed.)

Thank you!"
,SURLEWEB,2010-10-03T19:07Z,"It worked for me today...WGA WGA Validation Patch v1.9.4.1 [26th March 2009]
