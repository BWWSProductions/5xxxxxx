,RCJ_100L,2009-09-09T06:09Z,"I'm seeding. hehe

It left a repack of the release: Darkest.of.Days.REPACK-SKIDROW

Unnecessary. Taken from the release nfo:

REPACK NOTE
There was nothing wrong with game nor crack on previous rls,
but by accident the game installed 2 shortcuts on desktop,
the game icon and one called LanguageSelector.exe which was a
mistake and not needed one, sorry for that folks...."
,Lliam,2009-09-11T15:04Z,"crashed after new game, but it worked out just by downloading scorpions links.. and ofc lowering the Physx setup =P..
  I have a nvidia n9800gtx which is a little overclocked.
and I can't play the medium Phsyx =P

says on nvidias homepage that it's recomended to play with double gpu's where 1 of them is dedicated only to Physx.."

After settings, a game freeze on the loading screen. 
Because missing some cudart32dllfuckingshit!

Don't worry, i'm experimenter type:)
So... download a missing dll, from here:

http://www.dllme.com/dll/download/6490/cudart32_30_9.dll

No fear, no pay, no fuckin' bullshit, just download, and put a game directory.
No problemo, everything fine, and working.

Sorry my language, i'm hun."
