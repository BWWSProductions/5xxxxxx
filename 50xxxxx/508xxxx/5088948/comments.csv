I was wondering why you combine the 'chapters'? I listen in my vehicle. I have to find my new starting point each time. It is much easier when the chapters are small and virtually impossible when they are large. I haven't read any Irving for a long time. I would have enjoyed this."

I have changed how I rip recently. I used to keep the original CD format, which was usually tracks about every 3-5 minutes. For folks making CD's, this was probably nice, but for ipod type folks (like myself), it's probably nicer to have fewer tracks per book, as ipods remember your place, and it's easier to find your place in 20 vs 200 tracks.

Everyone's mileage varies naturally, but I rip them how I'd like to use use them, and so for ipod folks, that's probably fewer tracks. (I listen in my car too).

In previous comments, I've stuck to my (then) original many  track format, saying it's easy to combine tracks, tougher to split them, and that's certainly still true.

After ripping the 4 latest Bourne/Lustbader/Ludlum books, and posting a torrent with 900 tracks in it... well, that was a few too many. https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5024930 

So I now combine tracks into chapters when possible, usually making 3-6 tracks per CD instead of 20. So I'm not combining chapters, just the 6 tracks that might make one complete chapter (while not joining chapters/tracks across CD's).

IMHO, an ipod type thing well worth the investment these days..."
,Pimji,2009-09-15T03:58Z,"Thanks for the audiobooks. Great titles.
What I have done to increase the number of file is to use Nero Wave Editor > Edit > Insert track split > Save tracks as files.

It takes a wee bit of time and I can make a large file into as many small ones as I need. A full cd is good with about 20 @40 megabyte files.

Again, Thank You Ferrabit. My daily task is to listen to audiobooks. I do this as I do my job. 
Life is good!"
,brianxxx,2009-09-15T20:15Z,"I do the same thing as Pimji when I get a large audio book file. 

I listen in my car so it is not convenient to have big files/chapters. Need small ones. That is why the audio companies do it. They know what people want. So, I just slice it back up again. lol

Also, I work out and my MP3 player is used in different ways. I might want an audio book for cardio and crankin tunes for the squat rack so I have to switch back and forth.

Also, my MP3 player comes with me for commutes out of my car...like a train or subway and I use it in waiting rooms, long lines, etc. 

Each one has a different feel or mood and I need to be able to adjust. 

So long files that have to be fast forwarded through are a pain in the ass. lol

That is why I slice and dice if needed."
[V],FerraBit,2009-09-17T17:34Z,"Thank you all for the feedback!

I take note of responses here - which at the moment heavily favor preserving the original track formatting/length. I may change my mind...

Any others have thoughts?"
