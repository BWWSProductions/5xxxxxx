Still can't fin't the poet that wrote that 

Stay longer near, my love
And lie with me in restless ecstasy
Why go and wander
Wondering into the great, black chasm
Of that waking void
When darkness all used up
Bids peaceful things like sleep and love goodbye
For night is such proximity
And day so very wide"

You're welcome to the upload.   Thanks, bro.


Did warn you when you first asked about the poem that I can find nothing about the alleged poetess whatsoever.

I read the poem in a published poetry collection years ago.   And this poem was attributed to Jane Drew Whiting.

Don't suppose you or I will ever find any info about this one."
