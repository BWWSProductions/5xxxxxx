,chaotix66,2009-10-12T04:26Z,"Thanks for another great torrent extremezone...I do have one suggestion though...could you put in the IMDB direct links? Unlike half the people on here, I don't care if you post the links to your other torrents because I search by title only like a rational person would...I've dl'ed quite a few of your torrents, and thought I'd actually comment this time...Again, many thanks for many hours of quality entertainment..."

,fallout11,2011-02-28T00:55Z,"After watching this 2007 Toronto film festival award winner it is painfully obvious where fellow Canadian director James Cameron cribbed the entirety of 2009's ""Avatar"". 
Surprisingly good (if decidedly pacifist/nativist) film, and +1 for the unusual take on the aliens.
Thanks for the upload!"
