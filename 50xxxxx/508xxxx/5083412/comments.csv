It's a program that asks for your account name,  email address,  account password,  and other bullshit information to attempt to make it sound convincing.  And promises to give you more settings for the bot once you hit play.  Then once you hit 'play' after (to start the program),  it sends an e-mail to jonassundbom@mail.com with the info you wrote.
