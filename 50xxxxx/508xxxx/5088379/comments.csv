Notice to everyone: this was a compilation of several sites, torrents, and months of searching for what I could watch. This was the best of what I was able to find. Again, sorry I'm no longer uploading, and thanks for everyone that is uploading still."

Thank you."
,alex16ss,2010-12-01T12:06Z,"I am currently uploading both Stargate (seasons 1-8) and Andromeda, each with 600kb/s. So from my part enjoy it. I already uploaded 2:1 ratio, but i will keep it on for a while so thank me :D"
,hatchetman208,2011-01-12T03:34Z,"This is taking forever.  Over the past 2 months my download speeds for THIS torrent are 0kbs to about 10kbs and my upload speed has been around 300kbs uncapped, my download may have risen higher then that but I personally have never seen it go higher then 10kbs.  My max total bandwidth is just under 5mb.  This is complete BULLSHIT.  I will let this run a little longer to see what happens but as of right now I have capped my upload for this torrent to 5kbs, yes 5kbs.  I will uncap it once I start seeing 100+kps.  Thank you for seeding...."
