QUALITY:
THIS BEING A FIRST CAM THERE IS A LOT OF VIDEO NOISE AND THE VIDEO IS DARK. THERE IS ALSO A FLICKER THROUGHOUT. THIS IS THE SAME SOURCE AS THE OTHER ONE BUT WITH ENGLISH AUDIO. THE AUDIO IS KIND OF HOLLOW BUT IS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD. I'LL LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT REPEAT FRAME AT ABOUT THE 38 MINUTE MARK. ALSO IT DOESN'T HAVE THE OPENING AND END CREDITS
