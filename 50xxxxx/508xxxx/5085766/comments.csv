,toontea,2009-09-28T22:54Z,"Seeding on this one is really bad. Hey uploader, can't you just let someone finish so there will be more seeders instead of a growing bunch of stucked leachers?"

,leminhha93,2010-01-14T04:24Z,"Please rip at 175MB per episode. 350MB really is too much and not necessary! 

I've seen Sonny with a Chance. It was aired in High Definition, the ripper used 1/4 CD size and still look very good! "
