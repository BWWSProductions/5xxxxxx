The new highly anticipated psyclon nine release.







Psyclon Nine is a musical project from Hollywood, CA led by singer and songwriter Nero Bellum.
Their style is a mix of black metal with harsh ebm, industrial electro and general hard electronics; they belong to the so-called â€œsecond waveâ€ of American harsh ebm / industrial electro, along with bands such as Stormkern, Die Sektor, and Tactical Sekt.

The name is a malapropism of Zyklon B, a nerve agent used in the gas chambers during the holocaust. The â€œNineâ€ is used because the number is significant in Aleister Crowleyâ€™s numerological writings.
