MediaPlayerClassic HC does NOT work for sure. It crashes with an ""error reading memory..."" message. mkvmerge also shows a strange setting in the video track with a minuscule (bad?) display. remuxing it all and will post to tell."
,jabijabo,2009-09-30T12:23Z,"I managed to play video and sound correctly ONLY ONCE before a definitive crash after doing the following: 1. mkvmerged audio as is and video with a 1280x528 display ratio
2. Download and install latest MPC HC V. 1.3.1249 (Aug.28, 2009) which handles TrueHD.
3. Play.
But finally MPC crashed on the second opening and all after, telling me to download new language set. my MPC HC is in english from sourceforge. GOOD LUCK! VLC plays video but not sound."
