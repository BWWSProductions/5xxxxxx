                         Ashampoo HDD Control v1.10 + Keys



Release date: 09/10/2009


Be honest. In the digital era where bits & bytes have the day, does anyone really 
think about which tasks are performed by the hardware found in your typical 
computer? Integrated hardware components, in particular highly delicate hard 
drives, are hard at work every day. 

As long as the drive is functioning properly, you are lulled into a false sense of 
security. However, when the trusted hard drive suddenly fails, this is more than 
just a minor inconvenience. The resulting loss of data is often immensely damaging.
Ashampoo HDD Control is therefore ideally suited to boost the performance of your 
drive, guard against disk failure and remove clutter from your hard drives, while 
performing all three functions of monitoring, maintenance and defragmentation. 


Monitoring, clean-up and defragmentation
The Ashampoo HDD Control software performs hard disk maintenance for you. This 
involves taking measures to prevent potential failures and crashes before they 
occur. Towards this end, the program combines several functions available for 
the first time in this particular configuration. 

Monitoring
The software supports all commonly available IDE and serial ATA drives. Please 
note, however, that devices connected to the system via USB, firewire or RAID 
controller often do not support this function. Based on the type of drive in use, 
Ashampoo HDD Control provides the user with all important facts and information, 
including the firmware version, number of configured partitions, drive space and 
current temperature. As the number of signs indicating that the drive could soon 
potentially fail begins to mount, the background guard signals an alarm. If you 
are not near your computer, the program can be set up to notify you of the alert 
by email. In the final report, the program also provides information on the health
and performance of the hard drive shown in percentages. 

Maintenance
Over time, an ever-growing number of unwanted and unneeded files accumulate on 
your hard drive and Ashampoo HDD Control is a useful tool to help you locate and 
delete these files. Temporary files, files in the recycling bin and backup copies 
are all removed. In addition, the software empties the cache, clears the browsing 
history and erases cookies from the Internet browser. 

Defragmentation
An empty space appears when you delete a file from your hard drive. This gap is 
then filled the next time a file is saved to disk. If not enough space is 
available to store the complete file in this space, it's broken up into fragments. 
Windows in turn saves these at different locations on the hard drive in order to 
make best use of the available gaps. For this reason, it is easy to understand why 
the computer takes longer to read the file, since it first of all needs to locate 
and assemble all the separate fragments. With its defragmentation module, Ashampoo 
HDD Control is able to read out file fragments and arrange these in one cluster on 
the hard drive to ensure rapid access. As a result, the hard drive needs to spin 
less while the performance remains unchanged. As an additional benefit, there is 
less demand placed on system resources. 

Proactive defragmentation uses the time when you are not working to measure the 
level of disk fragmentation. If it needs to be defragmented, the process is 
started automatically. 


Features:

* Background guard continuously monitors status, performance and temperature
* In-depth explanations and information on context-sensitive help
* Displays all current SMART files with detailed explanations
* Able to export reports for support purposes
* Powerful, high-speed disk clean-up
* Objects found can be configured and managed in shortcut menus
* Objects found can be managed using intelligent filter mechanisms
* New exception rules can be created manually or automatically
* High-quality defragmentation performed to latest standards
* Fully automatic â€˜proactiveâ€™ defragmentation runs in background
* Defragmentation algorithm with minimum impact on system performance
* Self-monitoring, analysis, status reports on imminent failures

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of 
    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting 
    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz
    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!
  
08- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

10- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by 
   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
