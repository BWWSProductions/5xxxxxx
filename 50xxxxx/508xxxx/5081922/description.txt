INSIDE: Rolling Stones in Rio (2007)

It's one of the biggest concerts in history with one of the most groundbreaking bands in music â€¦ and inside has a backstage pass. The Rolling Stones are staging a free concert on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach - for an estimated 1.5 million people. INSIDE deconstructs the extreme challenges crew members face as they transport more than 200 tons of equipment, create posh dressing rooms for the band members and keep more than a million screaming fans under control.
