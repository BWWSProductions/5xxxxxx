,john5246,2009-11-13T13:52Z,"Within the first minute or so of this video the guy says he has some ""special super secret"" knowledge from someone ""high up"" at NASA who informed him that there was hard evidence that LIFE exists on Mars. The reason NASA hides this is because it would hurt religion and cause chaos


STAY AWAY FROM THIS IF YOU HAVE A STRONG SCIENCE BACKGROUND

some nonsense you will find in this:

1. Life exists on mars but is hidden by NASA
2. Machines exist that can produce unlimited amounts of energy
3. Aliens are visiting us but it's being covered up"

unless you are a conspiracy theory nut who enjoys hearing about the cover up of roswell area 51 then do not download this. 

COMPLETE UNSUBSTANTIATED NONSENSE "

,Nansin,2012-01-31T23:00Z,"When I downloaded this I found that on trying to play it in 'Media Player Classic' that I could not see the video (got audio only).

The problem is easy to fix in a video editor, like VirtualDub, but it would take too long to explain how here.

For non-technical folks (like myself), or those who just want to watch the video without attempting a fix, I found that it will play in 'VLC'. You can download a copy of 'VLC Media Player Portable' here: http://portableapps.com/apps"
