Dr. Steven Greer, an emergency physician, is the Founder and Director of The Orion Project. 

On May 9, 2001, Dr. Greer presided over The Disclosure Project Press Conference from the National Press Club in Washington, DC. Over 20 military, government, intelligence, and corporate witnesses presented compelling testimony regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life forms visiting the planet, and the reverse engineering of the energy and propulsion systems of these craft.

In addition to heading the Disclosure Project, he has also been supervising a world-wide search for alternative energy sources, specifically those known as zero-point or over-unity devices with the plan to identify and develop systems which will eliminate the need for fossil fuels. He has worked for 17 years to bring together the scientists, inventors and leaders in society to advance new clean technology energy systems. 

He is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the strategic process of transforming our carbon-based civilization to a long-term sustainable civilization using innovative sciences and technology.

Dr. Greer, as director of CSETI (Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence), has led research teams throughout the world investigating the existence of ETI and on several occasions has successfully established preliminary contact and communication with extraterrestrial spacecraft at close range.

He has met with and provided briefings for senior members of government, military and intelligence operations in the United States and around the world, including senior CIA officials, Joint Chiefs of Staff, White House staff, senior members of Congress and congressional committees, senior United Nations leadership and diplomats, senior military officials in the United Kingdom and Europe and cabinet-level members of the Japanese government, among others. 

He has written several books. The most recent "Hidden Truth - Forbidden Knowledge" is his personal memoir which describes his journey in bringing out this information.

Dr Steven Greer Presentation on July the 26th 2009

The  promise of New Energy
  	
This presentation will be a really in depth looking at the new technologies that have been hidden within the classified projects where they have been studied and can be brought out. How do they operate, and how that might change the way we live on this planet so that we can create a long term sustainable and peaceful civilization on this Earth, that eventually can go among the stars with this other visitors in peace.

Since the time of Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) humanity has been waiting to heat their homes, cook their food, run their cars and their factories on energy that is unlimited, non-polluting and off the grid.   Why has this not yet happened? What can you do to help New Energy fulfill its promise!
