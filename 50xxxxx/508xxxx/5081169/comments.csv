,madcan34,2009-09-09T02:09Z,I don't understand why I see zero seeders AND zero leechers  - that sucks
[T],gilgamesh07,2009-09-09T06:09Z,"My understanding is that there is a glitch in the tracker--- however, there are ample seeders and leechers on this and the other torrents.  Be of good cheer, the comics continue to flow! "
