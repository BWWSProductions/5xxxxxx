Grupp unetusetÃµve all kannatajaid on tÃµelise sanatooriumi asemel viidud Ã¼ksikule asustamata saarele. Peatselt sellest aru saades pÃ¼Ã¼avad seltsimehed iga hinna eest sealt mandrile tagasi pÃ¤Ã¤seda. 

Eesti filmiklassika. Eestikeelne, ingliskeelsed subtiitrid

A group of sleepless nerds should be taken into sanitarium for hard-therapy. They are taken to a lonely island but no sanitarium is in sight. Suddenly turns out that the nurses have kidnapped the men and are about to give them the only useful medicine they need - fresh air and work. But the patients decide to disobey. There's only one solution - to escape. The film is absolute cult in Estonia.
