IconPackager is a program that allows users to change nearly all of their Windows icons at once by applying "packages" of icons. A package of icons contains icons to replace most of the common icons on your Windows PC.

Overview
What makes IconPackager special is that unlike Microsoft's themes which only change a few icons, IconPackager changes hundreds of icons. A package of icons contains icons to replace most of the common icons on your Windows PC.

Everything from "My Computer", "Recycle Bin", Folders, all the way to specific file format icons such as .doc and .xls files and any other file type a user wishes to use. With its shell integration, IconPackager also allows users browsing through their system to right-click on any file and go to the added "Icon" tab and change the icon.
