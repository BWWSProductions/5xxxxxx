,akhiugo,2009-09-15T00:08Z,"Are you using a 32-bit system? I know the program is for all systems but I think the crack only works for 32-bit (x86) as you can tell from the registration screen.

Other than that you're out of luck if you did everything as instructed."
,torisutan,2009-09-20T06:55Z,not working for me either (i am running 32 bit)
,akhiugo,2009-09-20T23:25Z,Sorry to hear that. It's still working for me so I can't explain what the problem might be. Search around for older versions & see if they work for you. tbh I haven't noticed a great deal of difference between this one and previous releases. The interface is more user friendly but at the end of the day it just changes your icons the same as the older ones did. Good luck!
,softsmith,2009-10-12T19:55Z,Worked like a charm. XP (x86). Nice tool.
,bikerabhinav,2009-10-17T10:37Z,"thnk you !!
works great
all those who say it didn't work, go buy original..."
,XorLogic0110,2009-11-24T21:55Z,"Works great, thanks! Will seed for a long time.

For anyone who can't get it to work, the step is pretty simple. 

First install the application (iconpackager_public). When that's done, do not launch it yet. If it launches itself, close it. Now simply copy the file in the crack folder (IconPackager) and paste it into 'C:\Program Files\Stardock\Object Desktop\IconPackager'. It will prompt you that the file already exist. Simply overwrite it and you're done. 

Now launch the program, and you're good to go."
,SMIM,2009-11-26T20:42Z,"it works with windows 7 rtm (7600) x64. doesnt seem too buggy, it takes a minute or two to change between icons though so don't think your system crashed.

thanks akhiugo"
,Devinest,2009-11-26T22:26Z,"I'm curious. I've downloaded, installed, everything seems to work correctly except some features tell me this is not the enhanced version. Akhiugo, could you please clerify? and thanks for the upload!"
,akhiugo,2009-11-28T21:54Z,I don't know tbh. It's been a while since I used this. Which features are giving you that message?
,Takwan,2009-12-05T22:53Z,"Thx!!!

Works like a breeze. 

For those who don't know how to make it work: stop putting your lack of brains on others. 

Cheers!!!

,meh331,2009-12-09T08:37Z,"It's Working...

Thanks ^^"
,shyguy44,2010-01-06T16:43Z,why dont you all get of the pirate bay...only me allowed on here ....thankyou
,rodneyFpantonial,2010-02-27T02:25Z,"You can't change individual icons with this one.

Just try this:

Right Click Program>Properties>Icon Tab>Change Icon to something you want...

The program says you must buy the ""ENHANCED VERSION"" because its a shareware version....

download the 3.2 version of this in the piratebay...

it has another crack named shellext.dll

copy that to the installation directory and replace the previous shellext.dll

the individual icon change feature should already work after that.

@akhiugo: please reupload this torrent with the updated cracks... include the SHELLEXT.DLL please...

thank you..."
,trapt2821,2010-03-30T20:41Z,Worked great for me.
,Absinthex,2010-08-14T19:36Z,"Works very well, thank you! No viruses detected through AVG :)"
,siddharthshinde,2011-01-30T00:27Z,"worked great, i did however have that problem, for changing single icons but rodneyFpantonial's post worked perfectly well, thanks rodney!!"
