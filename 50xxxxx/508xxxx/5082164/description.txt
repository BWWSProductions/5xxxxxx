This .iso is Ubuntu 9.04 with OtherOS installed. 

Simply burn the .iso to a CD-R and insert into your Playstation3 and follow the on screen instructions.

If you get a screen with the Penguin and the prompt says "kboot:" just simply press enter and you will be taken to the installation screen for Ubuntu.

ENJOY!
