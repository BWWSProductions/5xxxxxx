Hi there...

Please seed this further on, because it's your right as a Christian to do so, and a privilege. Plus it takes the pressure off my seed-machine. And It can use some relief now.. :-)

Like the description say; this is the New King James Version Old Testament Dramatized/narrated.

I must, in all honesty, tell you that I found this (finally) on the net somewhere, and I thank the original uploader "TV_Dude" for it. It was included in the whole Bible as Audio book, then I disassembled it, tagged it properly, and even threw in a little cover art in the tagging. That way it shows what you're listening to on your iPods or what ever you use for heart-washing and cleansing yourselves in the bath of the Water of Life, God's Word.

It's,in my opinion, and I must be honest, not a very good narrative/dramatized Old Testament you've got here. He tends to "just read it", and doesn't seem to understand what he is holding in his hands, but like I say, that's just my opinion. You should never the less take good care of it. And for the blind, it's the only way besides Braille to actually hear/read the Word of God. One day the Words in these books and your knowledge of them will be the only thing that stand between you and a heartless world. Treasure this. Make copies. Store some. Give them away. Freely.. :-)

And there's a New Testament Dramatized uploaded on this site too:

That one's really good narrated and dramatized, and has double the bitrate of the other uploads I've heard of this New testament version. Not so "tin can" in the sound. Actually resembles more the human voice than a Edison wax-cylinder. It's more like "Your Master's Voice", actually.. :-)

God bless you all.
