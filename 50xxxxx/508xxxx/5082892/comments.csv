,FriarTuck365,2010-06-26T04:36Z,"@MadDocNC 
there is only 11 tracks on this cd , look on mp3.com or windowsmedia.com or iTunes"
,AruSama,2010-07-06T04:20Z,"Real deal, seeding from Mexico"
,Nightwolf_hacka,2010-08-24T10:05Z,"This album has ""truth"" embedded in it.  Now that is something you don't see every day.  No wonder I'm seeding it!"
,matthew_rs7,2010-09-19T23:41Z,"Muse is just simply my favorite band. I downloaded their Discography and became a fan. so I went and bought 2 albums. Plan to buy all of theirs in time.

Muse is not a band where you only have 1 or 2 favorite songs on the album, you favorite nearly all of them in their own way."
,l.i.s.a,2010-09-29T23:30Z,"Well, this was a great DL (quick, good quality, etc etc.) and definitely made me a Muse fan! What I like best about it is that it is nearly 55 minutes long, which is exactly my commute to school. Ha! Thanks! "
,bobfocs,2010-10-21T10:07Z,"Thanks - DL in 3 mins. The CD I bought of this album has degraded, so it's great to have a fully working copy."
,faizalum,2011-03-24T11:37Z,"The song files do not have any of the meta data like artist, album etc. And there is no way of adding it either..it gives an error while trying to add it in windows 7. Other than that the quality is great."
,faizalum,2011-03-24T12:27Z,"The media info problem(refer my previous post) is because of an incompatability in the ID3 tag version with windows 7. When i import the songs to itunes, it is perfect. It has all the media info already present. "
,Cman10237,2011-07-16T00:42Z,"Love for all those great comments. Just a beautiful band with moving music that can really change the world, no big deal. Download and relax, this shists EPIC."
,leapfrogEE,2011-08-15T05:50Z,what the fuck??? the damn file was empty. why!!!
,ThaPyratBay,2011-12-03T21:04Z,This album looks like a man's disco ball.
,mbsa,2012-06-25T23:32Z,Thanks!
