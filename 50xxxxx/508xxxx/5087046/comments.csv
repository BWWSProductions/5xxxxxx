,ronzalonis,2009-09-18T05:20Z,"Ths is the new BETA 1 version, right? You might want to have included that in the description, for those that have an aversion to pre-release products.

From the MediaMonkey website:
""We're beginning a new round of testing for MediaMonkey 3.1.2. This is a minor release, however, it does have some significant changes including a new CD burning engine, compatibility with iPhone firmware 3.0.x (and hopefully soon 3.1), along with a raft of other bug fixes.
This initial build has undergone very limited testing, but we've rushed it out the door because it includes a fix for compatibility with the just-released version of Quicktime included with iTunes 9.0.""

You can find more on their web page along with a Debug script for this release.

Thanks for the up however, I'm assuming the keygen and serials will work with the stable releases as well."

,doc2doc2,2009-10-10T18:06Z,"Install works great, but the serials don't seem to work for me. Says invalid registration code for each of them.
Also tried the keygen, same thing - no working code.
Any clue what might be going on?
Media Monkey is the bible, I really wanna get the gold version working!

Thx!"
