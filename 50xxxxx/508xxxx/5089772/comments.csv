,TauTau154,2009-11-08T20:22Z,"When I downloaded this, Norton automatically deleted BmLauncher, and kept the other one.  Tried to extract whysoserious.dll, and it deleted it automatically also.  Due to my experience, I would say this is dirtier than an Ethiopian child.  o_O"
,lilmitchit54,2010-01-03T22:52Z,"tau tau you re such an idiot learn what your talking about,
1. norton detects anything that it hasnt seen as a virus

2. most cracks are detected as viruses

It will only works for 20% of who have the game ""BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM"".....This is a collection of comments/complates over net  



 1.  Extract Batman.Arkham.Asylum.FullRip-KaOs

 2.  Install Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs (I think it not necessary)

 3.  You need .Net Frame Work1 Service Pack 1 (I think it not necessary)

 4.  You need .Net Frame Work2 Service Pack 1

 5.  You need .Net Frame Work3 Service Pack 1 

 6.  You need .Net Frame Work3.5 Service Pack 1

 7.  Update your directx

 8.  Move ""My Documents"" from C:\Dcuments and settings\.... to D:\Documents.

 9.  Install Games for windows by ""gfwlivesetupmin.exe""

 10. Copy ""msvcr70.dll"" to C:\windows\system\ and make the file into hidden and read-only.Some times its virus.

 12. Update your video card driver (I think it not necessary)

 13. If you want to enable PhysX, Change the ""PhysXLevel=0"" to ""PhysXLevel=1"" in the 
     file E:\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\BmEngine.ini

 14. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT! (Even, I am not garantee about working)

 15. If you installed PowerDvD, its process may will affect the game (I think it not necessary)

 And enjoy you're game !
