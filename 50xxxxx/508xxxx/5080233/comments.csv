,WithAllDueRespect,2010-03-11T04:48Z,"Neo! Half my Library has been all your doing. I much appreciate it! However there is one collection I can't seem to find anywhere, by any chance do you have access to The Best of Taste of Chaos Vol. 2? I used to have it and it was ruined. I'm dying to hear it again. Thanks for your quality!"
,Danarr,2010-04-27T20:54Z,"TRASH! this torrent was a huge disappointment. all the albums but the Saosin album is good quality. The saosin album is garbage quality, The saosin album is by far their best album, it has all of their hit songs on it. 
If you download this torrent make sure you uncheck the saosin album for downloading, but if I were you I would just dl a different torrent. >."

I can't find the original anywhere.
The original track features Anthony Green."
