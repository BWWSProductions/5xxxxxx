Over the past two years multi-award winning artists Beccy Cole, Sara Storer and Gina Jeffreys have toured together as the Songbirds.Hailed as the must see country concert to see, Australian audiences have enjoyed the hits from three of the most beautiful individual voices on stage and were treated to some very special â€œtrioâ€ performances of songs chosen by the girls from their own album collections. 


After loads of fan requests from around the country the three long time mates have for the very first time recorded a special concert so that we can re live on DVD time and time again. 

This DVD was recorded in Tamworth on January 22, 2009 at the Tamworth Regional Entertainment Centre and also features performances from Troy Cassar-Daley, Kasey Chambers and John Williamson.
