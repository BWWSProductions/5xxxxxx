[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-11T04:10Z,"I've messaged a few people with some specifics. There are probably archived forum posts that go into all the technical specifics - mines not the only way to record per se. Suffice to say there are / were only two XM units capable of a digital output (Polk or modified XMPCR) - couple it with an optical soundcard and scheduling / recording software of your choice (Replay AV for Windows for example). Convert from 44.1 wav to mp3 with razorlame, edit with mp3directcut.  Shit, maybe I can plan to do a how-to / toolkit torrent before December? Not a bad idea at all... "
