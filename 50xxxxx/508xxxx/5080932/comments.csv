,mannetjes,2009-09-08T15:00Z,seed  iam stuck at 9o % getting the shit from this
,mannetjes,2009-09-08T15:15Z,how the fuck can you  stop seeding with 1150 downloaders and no one got it  bin downloading sind about 30 hours ripping is nice but not with this upload feeling as much fucked as when i had bought it  but it is against my relegion to buy games ore movies  lmfao
[V],Subzero!,2009-09-08T15:38Z,"ever heard about hit'n'runners?... that way THEY HAVE to share, when they cant finish a download, if i wouldnt do that, all would hit n run, and thats something against my religion of sharing is caring.
now you know... and besides this 80% of all slowdowns are coming from the Public trackers, especially the pbay one, as it seems they are massivly slowing down everything, removing the pb tracker increased the upload speed a hell of alot, then i put the tracker back to the list, and guess what, its slowed down all again, now ive removed it again,and its uploading faster, so you may see, thousand little things, can be one big things sometimes..."
,mannetjes,2009-09-08T16:47Z,"well youre upload got up to 12 mb so my bitching must helpt and i always share 300% and btfw thanks fore the upload dudes

,GamerDude76,2009-09-09T03:43Z,"Soooo... Is there a key for this? When logging into Live it will ask for the key. I know It's just for the multiplayer, and I know I can't play that anyways, But I try to cancel that section for the key and it doesn't log me in... I just want to be able to save games. =)"
,GamerDude76,2009-09-09T03:46Z,"Ahh.... I think I see what's up, Srry... Needed to create a 'offline' account. I had a extra account that I made for Offline, But I forgot I used a free 30-day trial key for it heh. I need to make another account... Srry My bad."

,YuberEightFold,2009-09-09T16:43Z,"hey guys, this game just crashes on me, am i doing something wrong?"
,MageOfTyr,2009-09-10T23:43Z,"@YuberEightFold
Umm... lol,
a bit more of a description of the problem

If you got past installing, try the system requirements, if it's not that get windows SP(XP) or all the latest microsoft updates etc for vista/7"
,KonZ3N,2009-09-11T07:18Z,DO this work on multiplayer? LAN?
,stoleyourshoes,2009-09-11T08:35Z,"my game crashes aswell. i installed it and then start the game. get a black screen and get ""section 8 doesnt work"" bullshit from vista.

any help?"
,stoleyourshoes,2009-09-11T09:10Z,ok downloaded latest video drivers and it works again. i had the latest one before this one so that it now suddenly works is a load of crap but it works.
,yaqwsx666,2009-09-11T15:00Z,"System Requirements:
http://gamesystemrequirements.com/games.php?id=917"
,YuberEightFold,2009-09-11T21:48Z,"@MageOfTyr: Well, as soon as i start the game, it crashes to a Windows XP ""Don't send"" error screen, as soon as the screen blacks out. 

Im damn well sure my hardware can handle it and I do have Windows SP3, latest PHSX and Windows Live updates so i dont really know the problem.... Im trying to update my graphics card drivers... see if that works."
,Pro_Downloader,2009-09-12T09:50Z,does it work?!?!?!?! its a bloody simple question!!!!!!
,YuberEightFold,2009-09-12T14:05Z,"Well, updated my GFX driver, still no luck."
,NosTraDomus,2009-09-13T04:27Z,"i dont like Windows...especailly live crap- but this game, after extracting it,clicking on setupsection8.exe- and then using the shortcut on the desktop- crashes saying cant find xlive.dll- any1 else?"
,mamdouhbg,2009-09-13T08:35Z,"i started SetupSECTION8 but
when finished .. when clicked desktop shortcut it says there is no s8.exe and search for it
its not in the game direcvtry

please help"
,NosTraDomus,2009-09-13T21:05Z,"this game doesnt come with a BYPASS TO THE AUTHENTICITY check for this game,
the s8.exe should be there, if not, RE-EXTRACT it form the zipped file.

i have all the files...atleast i think i do, just cant get past the xlive.dll file, whish is used in conjuntion of Windows Games with LIVE..

Nice download, but cant bypass the authenticity check cause it needs a file,thats not included and wasnt attached, is this EVEN the PC version?


any1 find away to fix this and play the game?"
,sdk222,2009-09-15T20:12Z,"Wait so I downloaded this for no reason?


FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU-


Could I just download Live from Microsoft's website and use that?"
,NosTraDomus,2009-09-17T03:18Z,"update:
this game is playable after download you need a couple things though...

since the Game is ""GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE""
you need the software so visit and DOWNLOAD this 
http://games.softpedia.com/get/Tools/Games-for-Windows-LIVE.shtml

install it, its a p2p program for gaming across ""Microsoft certified"" games...yea...i know-w/o it you cant play ANY game that has LIVE written on the box.

once installed you should be able to play from the desktop. If not, you will have to download the UPDATE that it provides which is labled as, ""WindowsXP-KB938759-x86-ENU.exe"" its safe for Black edition O/S- or  a non-legal version of windowz.
after that, the game launches asking for you to sign in.. you can if you want but you need to goto their website to reg a name, and keep it or pay money to change your nic..

SO...
in the game CREATE AN OFFLINE ID/ALIAS
then save and your set.

choose an hamachi server or friends LAN>

this is hard to use trainers for....
the engine is a bit different,there are some that dont work,and crash- anyupdates on that, post here.
thanks."
