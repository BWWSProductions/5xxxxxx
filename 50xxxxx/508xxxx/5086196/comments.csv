the setup.bat file ran smoothly but on doing some research i found out that the .tptb files were note being extracted.. i got the following message on cmd prompt when i tried to manually extact it using tptb.dll:
""ERROR: can't allocate memory required for (de)compression in rep:500mb""

i think its not being ablt to extract any .tptb file with more than 500mb size becuz all it could extract was data2.tptb which was 356mb in size .. could you help me out? how do i extract the files which are more than 500mb in size? i have no idea how to use freearc"
