In Your Hands is the latest film to use the Dogme Manifesto, as set down by Lars Von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg and others almost a decade ago. A natural reaction to that news might be â€œOh, are they still making Dogme films, then?â€, but director Olesen proves that thereâ€™s life in the old Dogme yet, as In Your Hands is a powerful, engaging drama that benefits greatly from Olesenâ€™s naturalistic approach.

Powerful Well Made Drama

The characters are extremely well drawn and you really feel for both Kate and Anna, despite a gnawing feeling that the film is unlikely to have a happy ending.

The acting is equally impressive - Trine Dyrholm is terrific as Kate and we find ourselves as drawn to her as the other characters are, constantly asking ourselves if sheâ€™s really going to turn out to be a miracle worker. Jorgensen is superb as Anna, brilliantly conveying Annaâ€™s internal struggle between her faith, her sense of rationality and her hope.

The script is intelligent and thought-provoking, with the psychology of each character carefully worked out. In addition, the naturalistic direction often makes it feel as if weâ€™re watching a documentary, which gives the drama an extra emotional edge.

In short, In Your Hands is a powerful, well made drama with superb performances throughout. Itâ€™s unusual to see issues of faith and religious belief dealt with so engagingly on screen and Olesenâ€™s direction ensures that your attention is held from the start. Recommended.
