About: Hells kitchen

Each week Ramsay grills the ambitious hopefuls, putting them through rigorous culinary 

challenges and testing them to see who can handle the pressure of a fast-paced kitchen where 

only the skilled survive. In each episode, Ramsay will eliminate one chef while the rest 

remain to fillet their way toward the grand prize of a Head Chef position at Araxi Restaurant 

in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada.
