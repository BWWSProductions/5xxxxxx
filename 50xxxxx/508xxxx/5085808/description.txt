OK folks, here is a cool game where you defend your post by killing anything that moves and comes your way. Has different levels of difficulties and is challenging. Burn this to CD or DVD doesn't matter "BUT" you have to have the burned disk in to play this game. Have fun and for GOD'S SAKE people's SEED please. This is how we get the shit by SEEDING.
