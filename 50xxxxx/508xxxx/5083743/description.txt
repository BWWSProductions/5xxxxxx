This is one of the many CDs I got in Japan on my Student Exchange.  I don't know how the Japanese version works over there, but it's put together like Version A with the Version C tracklist.  Still, enjoy anyway! It's a great album!

I have an extensive Asian Music Collection of a variety of South Korean, Japanese, and Chinese artists, so feel free to request an album or single!
