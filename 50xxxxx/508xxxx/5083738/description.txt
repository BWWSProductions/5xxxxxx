More zany adventures in The Duck Factory, where Skip Tarkenton (Jim Carrey: Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber), the beleaguered producer of award-winning cartoon films, is up against it with the madcap antics of his colleagues.
There's Aggie's love life. She belives that she should be in carge but, in rare moment of truce, she needs Skip as her escort to persuade an ex-boyfriend that she is still a desirable, sensual woman. And then there is a teensie-weensie problem with Marty, the gag writer, whom Skip suspects is stealing another comedian's lines for use by "Dippy Duck", The Duck Factory's most famous cartoon character. Skip finds that his completely manic colleagues have problems telling the truth. As usual, the rest of the team are giving him sleepless nights, especially Ginger, the friendly hooker. Crazy and of-the-wall, this video will have you hooked.
