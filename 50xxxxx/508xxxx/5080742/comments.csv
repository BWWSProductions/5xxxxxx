I can't thank you enough for all these sweet 2009 GP races.  I'm here in the states and only have access to a truncated one hour version on SpeedTV complete with what feels like 20 minutes of commercials.

The BBC broadcast is how it should be done.  Suzi Perry, quite well spoken & knowledgeable gives us the grid interviews and pre-race setup, followed by the WAY COOL view of each track courtesy of the on-board camera ridden by whoever's captured the poll.  Then on to the race itself brilliantly called by Charlie Cox & Steve Parrish - get this - WITHOUT commercial interruption!  Pedrosa and Rossi both crashed in Indy right during the commercial break when I first watched this on Speed.  Sigh!  Then interviews with the top three finishers post-race and occasionally a glimpse in to the silliness that occurs on the podium.  I only wish I had that ""red button"" to press that Suzi always talks about.

tdmk1 - you come to Texas my man and I'll buy you more adult beverages than you should consume!  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

My only question - why a full month between San Marino and Portugal?

I'm enjoying the hell out of this sport! "
,tdmk1,2009-09-09T09:13Z,"@dpance - I guess the 4 week break is to let the teams have a summer break... Still, gives me some time to pack the missus & 4 kids up and have a couple of weeks in Texas! ;) 

I must admit, I don't like having to pay the UK TV license fee, but I do hate commercials during live broadcasts a whole lot more! :("

Well bring the entire family along then!  You're all more than welcome.  That was too funny!

I didn't know over in the UK you had to pay a premium to see commercial free broadcasts.  Makes what you're providing for us MotoGP fans even nicer.  I have DirecTV (satellite) and pay roughly $100 a month for my television that includes three HD receivers that are also TIVO recording type units or DVRs.  If you told me 10 years ago that I'd be PAYING that much to watch television I'd have thought you'd gone around the bend...

Something else I enjoy on the BBC presentation are the nifty packages that help explain how these million dollar bikes work.  I saw Steve Parrish explain how they launch the bikes for the start of a race and also a really cool segment on how all the data is gathered and analyzed by the teams.  Again, we aren't privy to this on what's shown stateside.

Can't wait to take you guys sightseeing around Dallas.  Cheers!

,tdmk1,2009-09-09T22:49Z,"@dpance - I must admit, I'm quite patriotic when it comes to TV, I still think we do it better than everyone else! :) 

The BBC is, as they like to tell us, 'uniquely funded'... Basically every household has to pay aprox $15 a month for a TV license fee (on top of any satellite subscriptions etc), and that is passed onto the BBC. This gives us advert free BBC channels as well as lots of programmes that probably would not be financialy viable for purely commercial channels. 

Our commercial channels are regulated too, they're limited to an average of just 7mins of adverts per hour - makes putting up with our weather a little easier... ;)"

It really does suck having speedtv cut to commercial RIGHT when the passing occurs, etc."
