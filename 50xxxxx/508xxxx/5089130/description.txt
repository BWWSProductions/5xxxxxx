Acta Numerica back issues 2001-2008 (Volumes 10-17)  

More of MathSciNet's most cited journal courtesy of MYRIAD
We are still trying to get hold of Volumes 5-9 (1996-2000)
Please get in touch if you can supply any papers at all from
these issues.

In their own words:
Acta Numerica is an annual publication containing invited survey
papers by leading researchers in a number of areas. The
papers present overviews of recent developments in their area
and provide 'state of the art' techniques and analysis.

IF you have access to mathematical research papers which are not free to all
on the Net..
IF you can supply institutional logins for MYRIAD to use..
IF you can set up a proxy inside your institution's IP space to download
the journals your institution subscribes to..
IF you can provide ftp mirrors or irc bots to use in distributing papers..
IF you know how to delete watermarks and other identifying data from pdf
files..
IF you can advise MYRIAD as to which papers and journals in your field of 
mathematics are the most important targets..
OR IF you don't have any of these skills, but want to learn how to help out..
