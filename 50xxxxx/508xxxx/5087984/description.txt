gloria! is a groove-oriented, exuberant, Disco influenced album. Something completely different from Estefan's previous albums, this album is aimed at a younger audience due the stronger Club and Dance rhythms of the album.

Gloria promoted the album at the famous Studio 54 at New York City. The three singles from gloria!, "Oye!", "Heaven's What I Feel" and "Don't Let This Moment End" all became major hits. "Oye!" peaked at #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play, Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Tropical/Salsa Airplay.

While, "Don't Let This Moment End" peaked at #76 on the Billboard Hot 100, #30 on the Adult Contemporary chart and #4 on the Hot Dance Singles Sales. Gloria! remains a highly regarded album and is touted as her best dance-heavy albums of her solo career.
