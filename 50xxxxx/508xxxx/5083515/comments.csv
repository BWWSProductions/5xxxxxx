,whybother-,2009-09-09T22:45Z,Ignore this torrent and download the original release here: http://www.apple.com/itunes
,tjosan62,2009-09-10T07:26Z,"I agree with whybother-: Ignore this one! Get it @ the source.

Download speed is never an issue with Apple's servers. I dl'd my copy at 1,6 Mb/s."
,jim0203,2009-09-10T11:16Z,The only reason I put this up was because I was having problems with the download speed from Apple's servers - might have been a localised issue. The torrent's still available if anyone experiences any issues.

,MKIVR,2010-06-27T10:54Z,"It sure helped me tonight. Not everyone is looking to update, Maybe some need to revert back ;)"
,hckrwolf,2010-09-10T02:46Z,"thanks for the upload, jim.
and dont worry about people complaining, they dont HAVE to dl it if theyd rather dl it straight from apple.

plus im sure theyll feel like assholes when they upgrade to iTunes 10, realize how bad it is and then have to come crawling back to you to get 9 instead :)"
,Mac_Run76,2010-09-11T17:15Z,This torrent's needed if you have a hacked iphone and need to downgrade your firmware.
,Lilo19,2010-10-06T04:46Z,this is great thanks. i accidently upgraded to 10.1 and its the worst!
