iTunes 9 for Mac OS X. Apples servers are straining a little to get this out to everyone on launch day, so I thought distributing the effort would make sense. The torrent will probably be quicker than Apple's site once it gets going, but check out http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ for the official download too.
