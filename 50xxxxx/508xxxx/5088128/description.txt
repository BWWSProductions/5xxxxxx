Product Description
The sorcerers' secrets in this book all have a special twist: they combine the illusion of magic with the firepower of improvised explosives, incendiaries, firearms and electronics. Most magicians don't use flamethrowers or human blowtorches in their acts, but you can after reading this! The material in this book is dangerous and therefore for information purposes only.
