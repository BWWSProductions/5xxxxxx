Stunning debut album by synth maestro Roger Powell, who would gain fame in Todd Rundgren's Utopia.  Multi-tracking several ARP synths and acoustic piano the compositions range from spacey ballads to jazz/rock excursions.  Highly recommended for fans of Synergy, Tangerine Dream, Nightcrawlers and the like.
