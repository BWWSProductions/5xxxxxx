,AsssKisser666,2009-09-08T00:44Z,both the .rar & .r00 file are corrupted for me. And this is on two separate torrents. So this needs to be fixed by STRANGE?
,tisemann,2009-09-08T01:19Z,"AsssKisser, stop spamming the comments on every DIRT 2 torrent, you idiot. Yes, some rars out there are broken, but that's not the fault of STRANGE, but clueless uploaders who don't bother to check the rars before spreading.

Get the release from a proper source and every rar will work fine. I've already extracted and I'm playing it now.

Fabulous game. I'm actually gonna buy it."
,AsssKisser666,2009-09-08T02:03Z,"Shut the fuck up tisemann, I know this torrent works fine. I tried to clearify that but TPB would not allow me to write it down. So shut the fuck up you moron, im not spamming, i was trying to wark people you idiot! Suck my cock you fuckface!"
,AsssKisser666,2009-09-08T02:04Z,warn*
,tisemann,2009-09-08T02:11Z,"Lol, who are you trying to impress? You do know swearing is a sign of lack of intelligence, don't you?"
,skytwin,2009-09-08T04:03Z,"The fact that he was also asking strange to fix the non-working rar files that they already provided par files is also a sign of lack of intelligence.

Oh, and AsssKisser666, you have been spamming shit.  Look at every torrent for dirt, says the same incorrect thing by you..."
,Ettila92,2009-09-08T07:09Z,how shall i do with the corrupedt files? can i just burn i out? 
,siwrath,2009-09-08T10:48Z,Ettila92 do nothing because asskisser666 is spamming
,Hails592,2009-09-08T12:35Z,asskissser wants to stop talking out of his ass!!! mother fucker!! spamming wanker!!!
,Hails592,2009-09-08T12:41Z,"asskisser666: ""shut the fuck up tisemann, I know this torrent works fine""

,Hails592,2009-09-08T12:43Z,asskisser666@ suck what cock? ive seen it! its like a little fucking peanut!!! has ha ha
,chris_smithy2k,2009-09-09T22:42Z,why do all the dirt torrents say 0 seeds? it wont even start downloadin
,Ettila92,2009-09-10T17:09Z,"listen here, there is currently illegal to download in Sweden so the companies would have sold their game trying to block tpb. Therefore, it may take some time when they have block the torrent"
,chris_smithy2k,2009-09-10T18:59Z,no probs mate.  I left it over night but no joy yet. I will just leave it ticking over
,Ettila92,2009-09-10T19:12Z,"on this torrent, is all the files working or some corrupted?"
,TDG,2009-09-11T05:02Z,"tiseman, YOU need to shut up, and no...
Profanities have nothing to do with Intelligence.

Grow the FUCK up, and shut up.
You're not helping anything when you reply, you only make it worse, and THAT is a sign of low intelligence.


Here is a mind fuck for you.

They say cussing is ""Adult"" Language but when you use it they call you childish.


And you better at least TRY to think before you ever do anything. because thinking you are smarter or better then someone. Makes you better then nothing."
[T],spotswood,2009-09-11T09:39Z,"ign says if you're not driving a ""rally car"" then this game is kinda arcady."
,meccs,2009-09-11T15:50Z,Works but needs to be patched according to abgx360!!
,klvsa,2009-09-11T19:16Z,"Loud noises... aghghg!!!!  No but seriously. Even if one or two rar files are corrupt, you can still tell winrar to extract it anyway. What you end up with is one or two bits of ,hopefully non-critical, game data thats either missing or misread. Also when you use abgx360 to check/patch the stealth crc it can alco correct some corrupt game data. 

So stop you spamming assfucker666.

O yes.. Thx for the upload. Will seed this one till the end of October. "
,rdrrr,2009-09-13T07:19Z,Hey does anyone have a 48 hour xbox live trial they don't need and can email it to me?
