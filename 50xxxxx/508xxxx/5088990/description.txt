  From Recorded Books:

As a Japanese-American fisherman stands trial for murder on an island in Puget Sound, snow blankets the countryside. The whiteness covers the courthouse, but it cannot conceal the memories at work inside: the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, an unrequited love, and the ghosts of racism that still haunt the islanders. First novels rarely attract as much attention as Snow Falling on Cedars. Remaining on bestseller lists for months, it has cast a spell on readers across the country.

"First novels rarely attract as much attention as Snow Falling on Cedars. Remaining on bestseller lists for months, it has cast a spell on readers across the country. This remarkable book is a tese courtroom drama, a poignant love story, and a haunting reflection on the delicate balance between the mind and heart. As a Japanese-American fisherman stands trail for murder on an island in Puget Sound, snow blankets the countryside. The whiteness covers the courthouse, but it cannot conceal the memories at work inside: the internment of Japanese-American during World War II, an unrequited love, and the ghosts of racism that still haunt the islanders. David Guterson creates a mounting tension through the fine details of his physical and psychological landscapes, yet he tells the tale with great tenderness. Snow Falling on Cedars will keep the listener in suspense until the sheer poetry of the last sentence." 

"A thoughtful, poetic first novel...packed with lovely moments and as compact as haiku---at the same time, a page-turner full of twists. Guidall knows just when to provide the emphasis and inflection..."
