,Tony28haha,2009-09-17T12:18Z,what is the difference between this and normal fable 2
,Exerz,2009-09-18T13:59Z,"This one supposedly includes the two DLC's released so far (Knothole Island and See the Future).

Havn't burnt it yet, still waiting on disc delivery.

Gonna check it out in abgx360 and see how it looks."
,brain81,2009-09-23T19:21Z,someone have the italian version? thanks
,Exerz,2009-10-03T17:33Z,No verified rip of this as of today.
,Ubersoldat,2009-10-03T17:55Z,Is this verified yet in abgx?
,seederlee,2009-10-04T21:39Z,Once fully downloaded i will seed for 15 days but at the moment 1.0 kbps till im done downloading at some thing like 1 - 10 kbps come on  this is really sad !
,jmpiv4,2009-10-10T15:49Z,Doesn't verify on abgx at least when I checked today
,007BL,2009-10-10T22:07Z,"Doesn't work, wasted [ 5!! ] DVDS on this shit"
,ace_012,2009-10-17T03:34Z,"Thanks for this, abgx said it was stealth patched but it wasn't verified in run level 3, so yea. Me and 2 other people have been playing it though since the torrent was released, no problems. Isn't verified with the one on abgx db though, don't know why. "
,Breks,2010-02-02T16:14Z,"I downloaded it and burnt it on a DVD and it didn't work. When I put it into the XBOX360, it loads it as a DVD film and wants to play it. How can I make it work. I'm sure I burnt it good. I burnt a game already and it was working without a problem."
,H0110wP01NT,2011-10-02T20:00Z,"Okay, those of you that may not know, to play burnt games on a system such as Xbox 360 you need to have a mod'd 360. How you mod it I have no clue. Ask some one who knows, since most people are saying it works means you probably are trying to play it in an unmod'd System."
