,DarkStormz999,2009-09-10T22:29Z,"Yeah, this version is kind of buggy. I even used ImgBurn and burned at x4 on a DVD-R.

When I try to load the Mexico level on the first circuit, I get a disc read error.

And even when trying to boot it through the Disc Channel, it says disc error.

I'm looking for another version now. -_-"
