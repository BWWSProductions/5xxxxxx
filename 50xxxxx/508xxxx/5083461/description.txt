Due to scheduling conflicts I will not be able to upload
the 09-18 and 09-21 shows until the evening of 09-21. So if 
someone can take care of that Friday and Monday I'm sure the 
pests would appreciate it. Thanks!

Note: I'm doing some infrastructure upgrades in 
the next few weeks which should lead to earlier 
ups. That's the good news. The bad news is I'm planning 
on "retiring" from posting O&A (it's simply a logistics
thing) in December of this year. No point in upping
when someone else could be doing it faster. That's 3 
months to find a reliable O&A upper to serve the pests.

Edit: If worse comes to worse I can still do the 128k ups in the
evenings post December, it's better than nothing.
