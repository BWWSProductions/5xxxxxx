Windows Vista Ultimate RTM with Aero theme, vLited to only 582MB ISO

Excellent for low spec computers.  Starts up and shuts down in seconds.  Stable.  No problems will be anticipated for the average user.  If you want a list of what was removed, just ask me and I'll post the list here.

I've used this for months and never had a problem.

VistaLoader 4.0 from Orbit30 is included as a bonus for OEM activation.

During the install, use this key: YFKBB-PQJJV-G996G-VWGXY-2V3X8

Then run the Vista Loader 4.0 after installation is complete. 


Please seed.  

Thanks.
