When Handy Manny is on the job, you know everything will get fixedâ€¦even when the â€œjobâ€ is helping find lost animals and bringing them home safely!

Throw on your sneakers and get ready to play chase as Manny and his team of talkative tools use creative thinking and special treats to round up the pets of Sheetrock Hills. Crunchy carrots do the trick when bunnies escape from the pet store, bananas might be gophersâ€™ favourite treats, and it turns out birds just love pretzels! And everyone falls in love with a little kitty who needs a good home.

Hop up and join Manny and all the wonderful creatures in the community for fun and furry fix-it adventures!
