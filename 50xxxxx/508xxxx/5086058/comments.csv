Fair guide if you only use it to glean how Joomla! 1.5 templating works.

Much of the advice on basic web design and CSS is utter horse-shit, though. She recommends using DreamWeaver and setting font sizes in pixel values, for fuck's sake!


Never trust someone who refers only to their ""long years in the business"" when it comes to computers and the internet."
