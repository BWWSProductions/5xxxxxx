,XParabolaX,2009-09-13T17:46Z,"It's good quality, but its not a dvd rip, its a R5. Look at his DVD cover insert... it has no barcode... and if you look close enough you can see he made that him self. Looks good, but what is the point? is it kudos for having a dvd rip of district 9? big deal man. Everyone knows your full of shit anyway... But kUdOs to you. Thanks for the upload. "

,smorebroed,2009-09-14T11:16Z,"you ppl actually are aware r5's are dvd-rips? just that those dvd's are released bevore postprocessing...
as if it was that hard to screw up a dvd-rip so it looks like a TC... 
depends on the R5-quality either it looks like shit or like the final dvd1/2"

Thanks for the upload dude. Best one so far, keep up the good work. Dont pay attention to these trolls, dont try to argue with an idiot because you'll just be bringing yourself to their level and they will beat you with experience. Looking forward to your next upload. THX DUDE."
,mac_genius,2009-09-19T20:47Z,"For all of those who don't understand the difference between R5's and DVDRips.

Thanks man"
,Planned,2009-09-20T05:41Z,Why isnt this top 100?
,snowbirds,2009-09-23T22:49Z,"Thanks for the upload.  I've been forcing myself to wait for a good print to show up here, so finally I can watch this movie.

Yeah, I wonder why this isn't on the top 100?  That telesync is still there, but not this one.  That just shows that you can't rely on the top 100 having the best copy.  You have to search for it.

Thanks again."
,zoneone,2009-09-25T23:56Z,"Wow, the dl speed actualy WAS good. Averaged +1 megabyte per second.

And the quality is... ""ok"".

I just watched some russian TS with english sound, and compared to that one, this has a LOT better video, just like it should. :P
(""Normal 700MB DVD quality"" so to speak.)
Audio is OK too, but the volume is lower than in the TS.

(I've just watched a minute or two, so I don't know yet if it's OK all the way through...)"
,zoneone,2009-09-28T21:28Z,"...however, it seems like the audio gets out of sync after a while? (Or is it just for me?)"
