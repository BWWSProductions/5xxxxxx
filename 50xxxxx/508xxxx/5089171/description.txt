From Wiki:



Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler (born on May 8, 1975 Madrid, Spain), better known as Enrique Iglesias, is a Spanish singer, songwriter, model, and actor.[1]

Iglesias started his musical career with Mexican indie label Fonovisa, which helped turn him into one of the most popular artists in Latin America and in the Latino market in the United States, selling more Spanish language albums than any other artist in that period of time.

Before the turn of the millennium he made a crossover into the mainstream English language market, signing a unique multiâ€“album deal with Universal Music for an unprecedented $48,000,000, with Universal Music Latino to release his Spanish albums and Interscope to release English albums.

Iglesias has sold over 45 million records worldwide,[2] has had two Billboard Hot 100 #1s and one #3, and holds the record for producing 19 number #1 Spanishâ€“language singles on the Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks.

Iglesias also has Maltese citizenship.








Escape  2001 



Escape is an Enrique Iglesias album recorded in English in 2001.

In late 2002, a special edition of the album was released with two extra songs, "Maybe" (Mark Taylor Mix) and "To Love a Woman", a duet with Lionel Richie.

Escape debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, his then highest debut on the chart, selling 267,000 copies in its first week. Simultaneously, "Hero" topped the UK charts, making Iglesias the first Latin artist to have a #1 album and #1 single on the charts. It was the second highest seller, in the United Kingdom, beaten only by Robbie Williams's Escapology. It was also the best selling album of 2002 in Australia.

The album also performed well throughout the world, being certified 3x Platinum in the United States, 4x Platinum in the United Kingdom, 5x Platinum in Ireland, 6x Platinum in Canada, 5x Platinum in Australia, 3x Platinum in India, 2x Platinum in Germany, as well as reaching Platinum or Gold certification in numerous other countries around the world.

The album has now sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, becoming Enrique's best-selling album to date.
