,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:19Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.

,PrincessPink,2011-08-16T11:20Z,Excellent download. Why is IGotDCMA commenting on so many of your downloads kukamonga? Does he/she have an interest in the copyright? If so he/she should know that US copyright enforcement stops at US borders........We do not all live in the US.

Hey IGotDMCA,
I am running out of toilet paper, please send some shiny Legal letters!"
