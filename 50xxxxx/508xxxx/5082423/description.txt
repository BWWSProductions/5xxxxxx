[QUOTE]Merhige recalls the celebrated works of such film pioneers as the Lumiere Brothers and Fritz Lang through this visually sumptuous short film. In it, he uses the camera as an all-seeing eye witnessing the divine mystery of creationâ€”the soulâ€™s movement into matter and the first glimpse of Eden.
Din of Celestial Birds, visually takes us on a journey into the darkness, mystery and struggle of origin and will be a living statement and invitation to consider an alternative model for the purpose and function of art and creativity.

Din of Celestial Birds is a fantastic barrage of a film, and a riveting view of creation. Director E. Elias Merhige (best known for Begotten) takes the helm of a great collection of video artists, musicians, painters, and philosophers in a 14 minute experimental film. The music by Ben Gellespie is stark at times, with many interesting movements of tribal percussion and processed voices. The general fuzziness has a interesting hypnotic effect and makes the sharper imagery more effective. [/QUOTE]
