,shifuimam,2009-10-01T21:36Z,Can't get this game to run for the life of me on Vista 32-bit SP1. Any tips?
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-01T23:11Z,"No Idea... I suggest updating to a different service back though- or get Windows 7.
It should be just download-and-run, I don't understand why it wouldn't be starting"

,italianbull38,2009-10-03T21:57Z,"it says one of my .dll files is missing, any idea what that's about."
,MoonFang,2009-10-05T02:20Z,"Ok,I get maybe im just doing something wrong. But it won't let me play the game. I click it to open the file, but all it does is open my bitZip program. So am I just an idiot and doing something wrong or what?"
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-05T16:33Z,"hm... I don't know what you all are doing wrong. It has all of the supporting data files inside the Spore folder, and when you click ""SporeApp"" you have to click the one in the ""Spore folder,"" not the ""crack"" folder.

For example, my install Desktop>Spore>Spore>SporeApp.exe
that's the one you need, not;
Desktop>crack>SporeApp.exe

@ Italianbull. If you run the one in the crack folder, it will tell you that it is missing data files, that might be why.
Make sure to run it in the right folder

@ Moonfang, I don't understand what your problem is. I don't know why it would open bitzip unless you are only clicking the torrent file again. xD
When it's done all you do is go to your folder that it's in ""Spore>spore>SporeApp.exe""
[Your installation may be different]

Sorry for your inconvenience- but it should work just fine. It is for most people so I odn't understand what you're doing wrong. =/"
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-07T16:27Z,"Also, everyone needs to seed a lot more....."
,Jake.18,2009-10-08T00:46Z,"ok so i downloaded it with utorrent, un-rared it ( it was a rar archive), then i went to the place where i put it.
 my folders go
My Documents> spore2> then there are 3 folders 
a data folder
a supporting folder
and a text document

 i dont see any crack folder, or another spore folder? what did i do wrong?"
,Fogner,2009-10-08T18:49Z,"When I try to run SporeApp.exe in the ""spore"" folder, not the crack folder, it says d3dx9_27.dll was not found. Is this the same file others are missing?"
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-09T00:19Z,"MIGHT BE DELETING THIS TORRENT!!

people who downloaded better start seeding more, since I am re-installing my operating system. If no one else seeds, than I can't seed it with my new OS, which means no one will be able to download.

As for the missing .DLL, you might be able to look it up and download it online, this worked for most people so I don't know why it's only missing for some.
It's a Direct3D .dll so update your DirectX to DirectX 9 or Direct X 10 and then try it."
,Law0070,2009-10-10T22:23Z,"After downloading and installing this game, I wanted to install galactic adventures as well, but I only seem to get the message ""spore installation not found""

can anyone help?

Thx
the game itself works fine btw ^^"
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-13T07:55Z,"Okay the torrent is not being deleted... Recovered it fine and I'm seeding again. ^-^

@Law0070;
I had this problem too and found out that it is a problem with the saved directory.

It should be in something like C:/program files/Electronic Arts/Spore/Spore

I know I already said that about the .DLLs but this happened to me and it has to be in the Spore folder within the other Spore folder.
I have also had a copy of Galactic Adventures that said that and it was a copy of the Galactic Adventures extension, not the install. So make sure your copy is good."
,Gage1029,2009-10-13T22:21Z,It isn't working for me. When i try to open it says that D3dx9.27dll is missing.
,Gage1029,2009-10-13T22:22Z,"Oh and I'm running it from the Spore folder, not the  crack folder."
,Tomernater,2009-10-14T07:06Z,"New to this also, 
""Just download and run...""
Does that mean no mounting required, no seeking out a suitable crack, everything is just ready to go?"
,poppydo12,2009-10-14T10:57Z,"What do i have to do?
I've downloaded it but idk what to do next
Any help?"
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-18T23:53Z,"Yes, Tomernater. It doesn't require you to mount/crack anything, it is ""pre-activated"" and just ready to run. =]

For the missing file problems, [IF IT SAYS YOU ARE MISSING A .DLL] you can just Google the missing .DLL file. There is a site you can download the .DLL file from, then you just need to drag-and-drop it in the main spore folder.

You should also update DirectX just in case.

That should fix the missing file problems you're having. You shouldn't even need to go through all of that if you update your Direct3D.
but after that just run the .EXE file."
,nacm23,2009-10-21T19:38Z,"is there anyway to use xpack with this?

and ,

if I already had a real spore account can i just use this with it?


also grat torrent was almost to easy to get working XD"
,Shinagai,2009-10-24T23:05Z,"When i open the exe file it says :"" Could not find a needed package. The data directory is missing or corrupt. [1004] "" What should i do?"

are you useing the one in sporeapp.exe in the spore folder?

if not open spore folder...then open the spore fonder in it (XD) run sporeapp.exe there ya go play :P

,Shinagai,2009-10-25T14:00Z,"Yes i'm using the sporeapp.exe in spore folder and not  the crack.exe. Still, it doesn't work. Also i can't seem to extract the entire folder.

,nacm23,2009-10-25T20:46Z,"where you extraction it to?

all i did was drag and drop the whole folder onto desktop and started playing"
,nacm23,2009-10-26T18:40Z,"back to my Q


anyway to install xpacks onto this?

also would it be a bad idea for me to log in on my spore account (like is EA secret police going kick my door down?or ban my account... )"
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-30T01:58Z,"nacm23; No EA wouldn't ban you for that.
lol. Not so sure if online works witht his, never tried it with a downloaded copy.

If other people get the error with winrar or 7z you MIGHT have to redownload it because sometimes things just happen with downloads where they become corrupt."
,LViking,2009-11-07T02:30Z,The installation is in E:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Spore. Everything is in that folder; wat do
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-11-21T07:22Z,"......?
Just run it.

Seriously- I've downloaded this on a bunch of different systems for friends and stuff and to help seed my torrent, and not once did they have a problem with running it.

If ppl are still having problems, it has to be your hardware/software compatibility or something. Update your graphics card, and then update Direct3D."
,jammz,2009-11-27T00:04Z,"when i finished fhe torrent its in .7z and cant mount it cause i cant find it, can someone help me im a noob"
,jammz,2009-11-27T00:50Z,theres no spore exe in the folder only app why is that?
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-11-27T02:35Z,".7z is a compressed file which you open as if you were opening a .zip or .rar file.

also- which folder are you looking in?

It should be ""C:\Users\Karabiner\Desktop\Spore\Spore\SporeApp.exe""
That's the file you run to start the game.

If it's not in there-- that means your file is corrupt or you stopped it before the download finished.
You'll need to re-download if it's not in that folder..."
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-11-27T02:38Z,"My bad. Karabiner = the user account that I'm logged on to on this computer.

it will be in

,Enzo03,2009-11-30T02:26Z,"I was told I needed to update Direct X, although I have DX11.

,ringmanme,2009-12-08T02:53Z,Avira indicates a trojan in Sporeapp.exe!  Beware!
,ringmanme,2009-12-08T03:02Z,TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen specifically
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-12-08T09:17Z,"Okay, ""ringmanme.""
I'm going to go easy on you since I'm sure you don't understand basic tech talk or are new to pirating and bootlegging copies, etc.

But xpack.gen = genetik or Trojan/Genetik which is what most antivirus programs use to describe a keylogger or a crack.

The thing about this, Most antiviruses do pick up on ""keygens"" or serial key cracks, when they aren't actually viruses, and is not even anything harmful to a computer. It's

as a side note: I also suggest getting something better than Avira antivirus."
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-12-08T09:18Z,"Oh, also, out of 11 people you're the ONLY one to rate this negatively. That's something you should take in to consideration...
When you're downloading pirated copies of anything, pretty much any antivirus will display the crack/keygen as Trojan/Genetik or "".gen""

GIYF..."
,aaauut,2009-12-08T22:34Z,"I was having a lot of trouble the first time around. Like, it always crashed as soon as I defeated a tribe in the game. It said ""Configuration failed-2000"" or something like that, and it was bugging me. I also had trouble with the 2004 error, so now I'm downloading it again, in case anything got screwed up in the process. However, I did notice that I could never make a desktop icon for Spore, and always had to spend 10 minutes extracting it so I could play at all. Any advice? I'd prefer a simple, quick icon to let me play."
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-12-09T00:09Z,"Like I've said many times already

It could be a partially corrupt download, or it could be that you don't have your graphics card+drivers and Graphic support [DirectX 9 or 10].

I don't know why it would crash, it has to be something with your system or corrupt download then.

I was saying before that I downloaded this on a few other Friend's computers for them so they could have the game and help seed, and none of them ever had a problem, because they had a very up-to-date system."

,EricksHinumaru,2009-12-12T20:30Z,"Okay, FuBaR, I have a question.

Is there anyway to connect to my account using this? I've tried, and all I've been getting is an error code about the registration key used to install the game not being valid.

Halp?"
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-12-13T09:14Z,"No, sorry.
It is disabled in this copy.
Most ""bootlegged"" games do have patches so you CAN connect online with a specific game.
I don't have one for this game, but you can just look for a Spore online patch on Google or another torrent site."
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-12-13T09:18Z,"OH, ma901nc...

Download 7zip to open .7z files. Extract it somewhere, where it can easily be found, [I put it on my desktop just for quick access, but you can put it anywhere]. When it's done extracting it with 7zip, you just run the SporeApp.exe file like you would with any other file.
You can't open .exe files like compressed files to play it.

All you have to do is run the SporeApp.exe like any other game or program."
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-12-13T09:20Z,"Oops, sorry, I missed another comment.

roninalacaster- There is no way it's in Spanish. I don't even think I included a Spanish language pack in this download at all.
Every bit of this game is in English..."
,distrofik,2009-12-15T22:28Z,NOTE: This version of the game is 1.0 and you will not have a chanse to update it or install add-on (becouse you'll haven't some registry entries - i guess)

There is no language pack that comes with this. it IS in English and has no separate languages in the download."

,lunatik3904,2010-02-10T13:29Z,"Thanks a lot for this download :)

Now, for all the people who can't get the game to work:

1)Download this torrent (D'uh?)
2)Download WinRar on http://rarsoft.com
3)Once the torrent is done downloading, right-click on Spore.7z archive, and select extract to OR extract here.
4)Once it's done extracting, open the Spore Folder, then the other Spore Folder.
5)In the second Spore folder there is Spore.exe. THIS is what you launch the game with. Don't bother going to the Crack folder.

For those who doesn't see the .EXE after spore, it's only because File Extensions are hidden. You don't have to bother for that one, only check for Spore (File Type)Application.

6)HAVE FUN!"

Here is the definition from wikipedia:A seeder is a peer that has a complete copy of the torrent and still offers it for upload. The more seeders there are, the better the chances of getting a higher download speed. If the seeder seeds the whole copy of the download they should get faster downloads."

If you get an error, remember to update your graphics card and DirectX!"
,ProjektFUbaR,2011-03-23T16:27Z,"Also, there is no crack folder, it should be pre-activated.
You just unzip it and it should be ready to run."
,ProSD,2011-05-17T12:49Z,How i can seed
,ProSD,2011-05-17T14:47Z,"good now i have download speed 1.5 mega
bite"
,FtSGallium,2011-05-30T03:02Z,How would I add galatic adventures onto this?
,LordMerkadis,2011-06-02T13:01Z,"For those generations after me who will want to download this pain in ass of a game heed my words and be enlightened:

1. Install Clean v1.0 Spore
2. Install patch v1.5.1
3. Install patch v1.6
4. Install creepy and cute mod
5. install Galactic Adventures

6. WIN!

Found all of this out after i donated some good amount of my blood to this games altar.. Or in other words after god damn annoyingly long ass research, so you better be thankful bitches.

Tested on Vista x64 with gtx nvidia 8800
The problem was apparently in the v1.5.1 patch if u install this bitch on top of GA mod it messes it up making the animation static aka non-moving-shit. I couldn't bring myself to play static shit so i had to go researching p_p"
,secretshield,2011-07-07T17:53Z,"sorry for bothering, but I'm new at downloading torrents, and here's something I don't understand: my download has reached 100%, and it says it's complete, however it says it is ""sending"" and it says that the time left is approx. 1 year!! And I can't find the folders anywhere... All I can find is the torrent file for Spore, and if I click it, it will send me the utorrent program of course, what do I do? Do I really have to wait all that time?"
,secretshield,2011-07-07T17:55Z,"typo

*it will send me to the utorrent program of course*"
,shatzy101,2011-07-28T15:35Z,"@secretsheild

right click the tag and click on open file destination itll take you to the destination you downloaded the file too.
apart from that your screwed XD unless you have moved the file to another destination."
,chinagirl187,2011-10-24T05:59Z,"i've installed the game and the missing dll file.  The game is working but only offline.  It wants me to register or login but it won't let me register and I don't have an email and password to login.  Please help so my son can play this game online.  Thank you so much, it's really appreciated."
,chinagirl187,2011-10-24T06:42Z,"i've downloaded, installed and also got the dll file that was missing and installed that as well.  The game works great and is much appreciated.  I was wondering though if there is login info to go on line or a way to register.  Any info is welcome.  Thank you."
