,Anonymist,2010-01-29T06:35Z,Is there any way to convert this back to PSX?
,shadowmoose,2011-02-20T11:25Z,This give you a a .pbp file.  If you want to use an emulator like ePSXe to play it then download a program called PSX2PSP to extract an .img file out so that ePSXe can mount it and run the game.  I got mine working with no weird hiccups.
,GreatCop,2011-07-10T08:10Z,"I converted this back to .img to play on a psx emulator. I used both psxfin and epsxe and the leg bug still persists unfortunately. If you savestate during battles and use the skip battle animation option found in the battle config menu, it's tolerable. Great game. "
,GreatCop,2011-07-10T09:25Z,"Actually, after updating epsxe the bug no longer seems to be an issue, versions 1.6 and after shouldn't have any compatibility problems."
