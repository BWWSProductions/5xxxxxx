Learn to write too. I can't understand WTF you're saying.  Next time run your post through Word's spellchecker *before* abusing us with it. Thanks. "

And by the way, no one wants to go to some sleazy website (zanzibar.com??) to convert their Word files instead of doing it right their own Mac. Get a frickin clue.  "
