The game seems to crash due to unoptimized physx-software bundle.
this one should solve the problem as it actually did with me.

It was taken from the latest nvidia driver v.190.62
- note that it's mentioned in the documentation that optimization goes to both Darkest of Days and Batman Arkham Asylum.

* Please consider also updating your video/sound card drivers for a better gaming experience *

have fun !!!
