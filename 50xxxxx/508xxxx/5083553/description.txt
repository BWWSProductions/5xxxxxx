EDIT: Try adding udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce and/or http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce to the trackers...I think my college's network doesn't always agree with TPB.

I haven't seen a good State Radio torrent out there, so I figured I'd put one up. This isn't perfect, but it's got most of their stuff at 192kbps. Includes:

-The Barn Sessions
-Flag of the Shiners (128kbps, one song at 112, you can't hear the difference though)
-Live at the Sync (awesome acoustic show)
-Peace Between Nations
-Simmer Kane (only a wayyy chill version of "The Waitress" and "Hopeless Tender;" the other 2 songs from it (Keepsake and Heady Riser) are on Peace Between Nations anyway
-Us Against the Crown (including Indian Moon, of course)
-Wicker Plane (only "Revolutionaries" and "Good Graces," since Wicker Plane's on Year of the Crow anyway
-Year of the Crow

Song numbers aren't in file names, but they're in the id3 tags.


Enjoy
