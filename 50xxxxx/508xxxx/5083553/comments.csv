great band, couldn't find the discography anywhere for a while. Thanks so much!

New Album ""Let It Go"" releases 9/29

I hate stealing music from these guys cause they donate so much of their proceeds to great social causes, but I had to finish my discography w/o spending $50, deff. gonna buy Let it Go though. "
