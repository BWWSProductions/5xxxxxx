,yellowsubmarine,2009-09-08T09:30Z,"Thanks anon!  I hear TPB is going commercial like napster etc what a shame. Ive been sharing and downloading here for several years.  I understand Demonoid is the next best P2P. Could anyone please send me an invite, would be much appreciated. dumptydo@windowslive.com.  Thanks in advance. Power to free P2P for ever!!"
[T],eddie1969,2009-09-08T22:51Z,"You should check demonoid every day.

At least once a month registrations are open as they delete the accounts of morons who have not used the site for ages.

I have been on demonoid for yonks now and believe me it is in a class of its own.

Pure brilliance. You just would not believe the treasure trove that awaits you!!"

Cheers. "

,mpgaastra,2011-11-23T01:59Z,"Pfff... It took some months before this download had been completed. This evening it was the first time I could enjoy, but... I only got error messages :-(.
Who can help me? Is there anything I have to do with the downloaded files before I can open them? I tried to open with different programs, but maybe not the right one. Anybody a suggestion?
Thanks!
