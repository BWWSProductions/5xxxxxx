,AsssKisser666,2009-09-08T00:45Z,both the .rar & .r00 file are corrupted for me. And this is on two separate torrents. So this needs to be fixed by STRANGE? 
,skytwin,2009-09-08T04:00Z,"why would strange fix this?

The original was posted on usenet and was supplied with Par files.  This is a torrent so I suggect MQFPLO provides par files (presuming their not already)"
,MQFPLO,2009-09-08T11:23Z,i can unrar without problems...
,MQFPLO,2009-09-08T11:35Z,"i check the .sfv again, and it works without problems."
