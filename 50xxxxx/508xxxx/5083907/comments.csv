,tonyc21,2010-06-09T09:46Z,"Thank you so much! This is my favorite game after Resident Evil 4. It worked for me on the first try. I used the included DVD Decrypter and burned it to a phillips lightscribe dvd-rom. I then used a swap disk and it worked on my ps2 slim. Also, thanks for including the pictures of the cover and of the disk itself. "

I have burnt the image twice and both times the intro movie (the movie with the song ""you're not here"") stops halfway. Is this only problem for me or is it something wrong with the image?"
