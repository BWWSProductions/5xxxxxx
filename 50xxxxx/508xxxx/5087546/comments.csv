,Deltics,2009-09-13T21:05Z,"Thanks for the complete mono albums, your uploads are much appreciated.
Now, who has all the stereo versions?"
,Auntie-BeeB,2009-09-13T21:37Z,"Thanks Anonymous, you sure do have a lot of files lol."
,cupirate,2009-09-18T17:12Z,"Mono is superior in this case, as stereo recording wasn't implemented yet (in those days).

Thus if the original is mono, and stereo was ""created"" later, the stereo won't be as good.

Thanks for this upload."

Are you CERTAIN your drive has no audio cache? If not then your rips are not accurate and should be redone. 

Always leave the option to YES, even if it doesn't. This won't make others question your rip :)"
