Nightmares have to put up with a lot of crap. Of all the different types of dreams, you'll never see a fan page for this type of dream. But why not? What's more exhilarating than a nightmare? The rush of being chased, of an adventure! Of course adventures are only good if they have a happy ending, but what's a happier ending than waking up in your own bed!?

Love your nightmares. Here's some darkness in a drum & bass rhythm for your mind. Neurofunk!
