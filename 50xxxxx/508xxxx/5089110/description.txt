The Law of Nines is the title of the new thriller by New York Times bestselling author Terry Goodkind. 

The book was released on August 18, 2009. 

It debuted at #10 on the Times bestseller list.

The book represents a move by Goodkind from fantasy to the thriller genre, although his new book has many fantasy elements. The book is linked to Goodkind's Sword of Truth series by the explanation that there are now two parallel worlds, one with magic and one (ours) with technology. The "technology universe" is the one created by Richard Rahl at the conclusion of the Sword of Truth series. The setting of the novel is in present day, thousands of years after Richard created two separate worlds. The book's main character is Alex Rahl, an artist whose life becomes more complicated when he meets a woman named Jax from another world.
