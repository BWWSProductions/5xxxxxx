Succeeding where so many of her contemporaries in the Latin American music scene have failed, Shakira has fully achieved mainstream pop success without ever losing her ethnic identity. Having moved over 60 million CDs worldwide (and counting), Shakira hasn't sold out -- she's simply crossed over, effortlessly melding her trademark Colombian rhythms with elements of pop, rock, jazz and R&B. While other artists like Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin often seem desperate in their tongue-wagging quest for world domination, Shakira is the real deal.

Following her multi-platinum two-CD assault of "FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1" and "Oral Fixation Vol. 2," Shakira embarked on her marathon Oral Fixation Tour. Spanning one hundred dates over nearly 14 months, the jaunt saw her selling out arenas worldwide and performing a stageshow filled with song, costume and dance that easily ranks up there with the concert extravaganzas put on by Madonna, Cher and Celine. Performing new songs and older hits alike, Shakira belted out a 17-strong track list that kept the audience on their feet for nearly the entire two-hour show.

As a live performer, where Shakira excels above even her fiercest pop peers is in her multi-instrumental skills and charming enthusiasm for exhibitionism. Whether she's running around barefoot, jamming on the harmonica like a distaff Bob Dylan, or letting it rip on a guitar as if she wants to be the next heavy metal rock god, she beams from ear to ear. She's like the little girl down the block who dreamed of being a pop star in front of the mirror and actually got her wish, but lost none of her child-like enthusiasm along the way. Simply put, her spirit is infectious.

As has become the standard over the years since Madonna launched the Blonde Ambition tour back in 1991, female artists must now merge theatrics with the music, and throw in a bit of Cirque Du Soleil for good measure. Shakira doesn't skimp here, either, bringing a cavalcade of dancers and musicians together to create quite the spectacle. Although all the hip-shaking grows a bit tiresome by the end of the concert, and the musical nods to multiculturalism sometimes feel a bit forced, Shakira is still one of the few pop stars out there who doesn't seem to be merely pandering as she blends her influences together seamlessly, with top-flight production and professionalism throughout. Whether you like her music or not, there's no denying that this is one pop star who has her act together.

01. Intro
02. Estoy Aqui
03. Te Dejo Madrid
04. Don't Bother
