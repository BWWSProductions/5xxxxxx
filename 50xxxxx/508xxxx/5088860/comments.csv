And i installed this PhysX enabler: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5089551/Batman_Arkham_Asylum_Crack_Only-RELOADED

Just use setup.exe and install it normally.

I also included whysosrs.dll file into the Binaries folder. And the game works great, gliding bug gone and PhysX is good and all.

Note:
If you dont have a Nvidia graphics card you don't need to install the PhysX enabler."

,Pseudonym101,2009-09-29T20:29Z,"And I downloaded for about 18 hours and its complete and working great. I had connections to at least 6 seeders the whole time and uttorent shows there being 1445 of them in the cloud.
So heres a thought... We are seeding! Maybe somethings wrong on your end dumbasses! Quit bitching and flooding the comments with your SEED demands. Who is going to read those after they downloaded anyways? If they're not seeding, they're not reading either. It just makes it hard for the rest of us looking for solutions to real problems like:

Thanks for the quest to help me! i appriciate it. But i figured it out eventually. My theory was that if i could install it manually with another language, i could maybe run Revo uninstaller so it could trace registry keys for batman when i uninstall it with Revo. What i did:

1. Browsed Reloaded dvd for ""setup"" file only. And just used the Italian versjon, becouse the english setup can only be started manually thru ""autorun""

2. Installed it in italian. Sucess! 

3. Uninstalled it with Revo, and checked the ""check folders, registry"" for traces after original uninstall. 

4. Revo found folder and registry keys, uninstalled them manually and deleted them.

5. i sucessfully could install Batman thru Autorun setup!!!!! And finally fully working game with no bugs and physx!


Hope this maybe can help someone with the same problem. i cant be  the only one? :)"

Stop whining, i dwn it in 7 hours with ~500kbp/s.. 

check ports, check firewall in win and router. try tweaking utorrent if thats what  u use. then maybe u get more speed."
,frankenstein1394,2009-09-29T23:47Z,"TPB Quality Checker is right, it was downloading very slowly and I thought everything was configured correctly, but then I double checked my port config and doubled the dl speed by making sure the right port was being ignored by the multiple firewalls I'm running, do as he says."

Quote; 
If you are getting the error ""seculauncher: failed to start application [9000]"" this is how I fixed it.

Download msvcr71.dll from the following link

then copy it to your windows/system folder.

Then copy/paste the content of the crack-folder in Batman/Binaries

,Juvetti,2009-10-12T12:11Z,"knight92: Your processor seems fine. But if u are using Vista, i think 2gb ram is minimum req. 
And with what u have shown it looks like ur graphic's card is built in to the motherboard, and i searched it. And so on it looks like the graphics card is using memory from ur ram. So if thats the case u have less ram than 1,4. 

So if u have a built in graphic's card i would recommend u to get a new one. And 1gb ram more. 

1gb ram is like 56£ i think. And 120£ for a graphic's card with 512mb.

I dont know if the price's are right. Because i had to figure it out from KR to £.

Anyway, that's what i think u would have to do to get to play this game without lag. It will be worth it anyways. When u got a pc and want to play all new games, u need to know that u will have to buy new stuff pretty often, to play the newest games that are coming out. "

,ShadGar,2009-10-28T17:35Z,"Ok, for those who don't feel like going thru pages to find out how to make this work...

1) Install game (Don't use Crack yet)
2) Run 1.1 Patch - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5092238/Batman_Arkham_Asylum_Patch_1.1
3) Place original Crack Files (both of them) into your Batman Binaries Directory.
4) If ask for your Live ID click Create New->OFFLINE then it wont ask for a key.
5) If you get the Securom 9000 error then place this dll file in your Windows/System folder...
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71

The patch fixes physics and many misc. fixes to game and the Offline LIVE ID will fix not being able to save."

1. The game automatically redirects you to a ""create account"" screen, click ""new account"".
2. The game tells you in a wall of text how awesome Windows LIVE is, which it's not. Scroll down, you'll find hotlinked words, saying something like ""if you don't want to benefit from WL just yet, click here"".
3. Type name.

if you can't save, create a windows live account and put any key of any other original game that uses the GFWL you have, that will work. If you don't have any game(which by not having the live account, you don't), buy one, or try finding in the internet, there are tons of keys out there, and websites that often give them."

,Quantum12,2010-03-04T18:49Z,"For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.

People actually believe that working against each other is the best thing for humanity. They are brainwashed into thinking that fighting for the same small portion of resources passed down from the top of the pyramid is the smartest thing to do.

How much longer will people be this stupid? When will they learn that the entire purpose of dividing us is precisely so that we can never rise to facilitate change? There is no trust because everyone wants the same jobs, the same resources and the same small percentage of wealth. Over 95 percent of the world?s wealth is owned by less than 1 percent of the population.

The answer to fighting crime isn?t to put more police on the streets. Crime can only be defeated by removing the inequality that gives people the incentive to commit it in the first place. Politicians know this but are trapped in the system just like everybody else. Political success requires massive amounts of funding to be pumped into campaigns and advertising. I assure you that the poor don?t pay for this.

When will people learn who their enemies are?

Did slavery end, or did it just evolve into something more nefarious and cunning?

I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.

P.S. There are three things you can do to help.

1) The system isolates people from one another by giving them conflicting interests from their competition. The way it hides this is by uniting the people in hatred of something else.

Unity is everything provided we face the right enemy. Tell people who the enemy is. They will not believe you, so be patient and persist. Do not let ignorance destroy us.

2) Do not have anything to do with the military.

The military takes orders from the government, but the government takes orders from the banking industry. War is about profit because the system is a business and not a charity. The best way to convince men to fight is to make them want to fight. Think about it. 

Don?t fall for the jingoism bullshit. There are no great pieces of land, just great people.

3) Know your enemy.

The system that lets most people suffer in poverty and a few to wallow in self-indulgence because of bloodline or blind luck is the enemy. This is the same system the Romans used, and will end in the same way. The greed of a few is holding back evolution for the rest.

The heart of the enemy is the banking industry. The banking industry perpetuates debt and most horrifyingly of all, it keeps people static. It weighs them down with car loans, mortgages, personal finance, stock options, credit cards, overdrafts etc..... The point is to keep you in permanent debt, and therefore an employee of the bank until you die. Everybody works for the banks: the only difference lies between those that know it and those that don?t.

Strike the heart."

,ohbugga,2010-05-05T18:37Z,"~EVERYONE WHO HAS THE ERROR [9000]~

The problem most likely is your anti-virus program. I have Norton, and after installation, I had the the same error message. I looked it up, and Norton scanned the binary file (that is in the crack folder, IMPORTANT) as an trojan file. SOme folk say that it's a trojan, but it's not - Norton only sees it as one.

What you need to do is turn your virus program off (and nice thing would be that you get a better one) and after that copy the binary file from the crack folder to the binaries folder in the game folder. I didn't have to download anything else than this torrent, no updates or anything. I just have to repeat the progress every time I want to play. So to keep it simple:

Open the crack folder -> Turn Anti-virus program off -> copy and paste the contents of the crack folder to C:/Program Files/Eidos/Batham Arkham Asylum/Binaries -> Play!

Most likely if you have Norton or anti-virus program that scans the binary file as an trojan, you need to repeat those steps everytime you want to play.

Cheers."
,ohbugga,2010-05-05T18:42Z,"If you have Norton and you're wondering how to turn it off:

Click the icon of Norton in the taskbar -> click the tab ""Norton Internet Security"" (don't be confused, that part runs through the whole computer too) -> Settings -> click on Auto-Protect -> Turn off -> TA-DAA! You're ready to install the binary files.

It asks you when it turns itself on again, I usually pick 15 minutes. After it turns again, it scans the binary file as trojan, and deletes it. Don't worry, it won't end your gameplay once it's deleted. Even thought that on the next time you play, you have to copy and paste the binary file to the game folder again."
,simroto,2010-05-06T03:10Z,"I had error 9000 at begin too, I followed instructions and it's working ! Great game and graphics..

,ohbugga,2010-05-06T08:26Z,"(He doesn't actually ""fly"", he just glides from top of the buildings to the ground)

So you've tried to glide? In my game it works when I'm on higher ground and push space button down... Doesn't work thought if there's not enough room for Batman to glide around.

Just try it once more. I don't think that would need it in the beginning of the game until you have to kick Victor with glide kick."

,Achillestherotti,2010-08-08T22:02Z,"For those with the Seculauncher 9000 error. 

It may be due to your anti-virus program deleting part of the crack. In order to fix this you must:

1. turn off anti-virus, for norton make sure you have auto liveupdate and auto protect off. 

2. Extract files. If you have already extracted the files while you had your anti virus on then go to the rld-btaa file and right click, then open it. Whatever program u used to extract it should open with the contents of the rld-btaa file. I used winrar so then in winrar(or other program) open the crack folder and there should be the BmStartApp.exe file and a whysosrs.DLL file. The .DLL file is the file your anti virus deleted. What you now want to do is drag both files and put them into the crack folder that you would usually copy to C:/program files(x86)/Eidos/Batman Arkham Asylum.

3. Once you've ensured that you have both the BmStartApp.exe and the whysosrs.DLL files, copy and paste/replace them into C:/program files(x86)/Eidos/Batman Arkham Asylum/Binaries folder and then click on the BmStartApp.exe that u just copied there and voila, it should work. 

I saw a lot of stuff about downloading msvrc71.dll etc... but none of that worked. Simply stopping norton from erasing part of the crack and following the instructions at the top of this page in the description of the game was enough to make it work. Hope this helped a bunch of you. "

It will only works for 20% of who have the game ""BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM"".....This is a collection of comments/complates over net  



 1.  Extract Batman.Arkham.Asylum.FullRip-KaOs

 2.  Install Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs (I think it not necessary)

 3.  You need .Net Frame Work1 Service Pack 1 (I think it not necessary)

 4.  You need .Net Frame Work2 Service Pack 1

 5.  You need .Net Frame Work3 Service Pack 1 

 6.  You need .Net Frame Work3.5 Service Pack 1

 7.  Update your directx

 8.  Move ""My Documents"" from C:\Dcuments and settings\.... to D:\Documents.

 9.  Install Games for windows by ""gfwlivesetupmin.exe""

 10. Copy ""msvcr70.dll"" to C:\windows\system\ and make the file into hidden and read-only.Some times its virus.

 12. Update your video card driver (I think it not necessary)

 13. If you want to enable PhysX, Change the ""PhysXLevel=0"" to ""PhysXLevel=1"" in the 
     file E:\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\BmEngine.ini

 14. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT! (Even, I am not garantee about working)

 15. If you installed PowerDvD, its process may will affect the game (I think it not necessary)

 And enjoy you're game !

For those who couldn't get to work...

1) Install as directed. For newbies :

Mount with Daemon Tools (Free software)

Any virus alert - Must be a false alarm.

Unblock it from your program if it blocks.

For precaution : try to keep the net off

Stop your anti-virus,firewall if it creates problem

It should run smoothly."

a false positive never comes up as a trojan downloader. AND its even worse when its in the runsetup.exe file that is clearly a virus. 
(false positives are normally in the crack) BECAUSE the clack is a virus that over rides part of the game allowing you to play it!

Pretty good game, I'd give it a 9/10.

Installation:
1. Mount in Daemon tools or PowerISO.
2. Install the game normally.
3. Extract the CRACK files inside the .iso.
4. Put the BmStartApp.exe and whysosrs.dll (lol'd at the .dll btw) from the CRACK into the Binaries folder located in your installation folder. Overwrite the original.
5. Run the game from BmStartApp.exe.

Before anyone calls me a noob, I have been doing this for awhile (so don't waste your breath) and I've tried everything that has been suggested in the comments so far. I'm still getting the ""securom"" error. I'm about to give up but figured I'd ask the forum one last time before deleting the file - since it took freakin' forever to download! Please help - this game looks too cool to pass up the chance to play. (And yes, I could just pony up the $$$ and buy it which will probably be next but hey, we're all pirates and wouldn't be here except that we're trying to get our games for free - so don't bother preaching either) Just help a brother out - :) Thanks "

,Drymarro,2011-01-29T08:14Z,"Okay guys the original installation instructions aren't fully true. and don't listen to anyone telling you to download from gamecopy world.
1. Mount the Image

2.Install the game

3.Copy the files from the cracked folder to x86/eidos/binaries and copy and replace when prompted.

4.download msvcr71.dll(google or use link)
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71

5. Run from BMStartapp.exe located in binaries(you can send a shortcut to your desktop)

p.s. I had gotten an error.. I googled it and found out that all you needed to do is get that dll.
That's how I got mine working, and you should try that out if all hope is lost(trust me, we've all been there.
Cheers!"

For anyone looking for crack, its on the iso image, just like always.  And the slowmo problem sounds like it has something to do with either your game running in software rather than hardware, and also, try updating the game and finding a 1.1 crack.. or w/e is the newest version of the game.  Stop getting on TPB and whining because you dont know what your doing.  Just ask nicely and someone will help.  Otherwise, you get bitched out.."

,DontPissMeOff,2011-08-05T16:52Z,Could someone kindly explain it to me why you are downloading this game now? It's been almost 2 years since it was released. Apart from the people who are going to play it for the second time the only explanation that comes to my mind is that you have bought a new computer or 3D and you want to play it with better graphics - is that so?

I want to tried the game. It is very good, but it can't save the game. I know why, because you need a windows live. OK, I did it. But the game needs a serial. Is there anyone who knows a working serial?"
,freedomphamtom2,2011-08-07T05:07Z,"it works,i highly recommend this torrent. Before downloading,i was affraid it would work because i read all those comments,but no need to worry

,nomailx,2011-08-08T13:42Z,test
,nomailx,2011-08-08T13:44Z,"Ok Guys. I Just finished the whole buggy Batman. I read almost all threads in the whole internet. I am really pissed off because the developpers did all they could to prevent the pirated version to work. But I finished the game anyway. So here is my answer to them: I will write the ULTIMATE way to finish the game. All the grapple bugs you will encounter and the save problem, the poison ivy bugs, the floorless level, etc... you will find all the answers here.

1. Download this version of the game. (reloaded one). Do what they say on the info.

2. Go there for a most effective Crack:

http://datei.to/datei/F6zgvbApyN.html

you won't need any save from now on until later.

3. You may wanna activate PhysX.

How to enable PhysX

If the option to turn on PhysX is missing from the in game menu, try the following.

    Browse to directory  C:\Users\USERNAMEDocuments\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config
    Open UserEngine.ini file with a text editor such as Notepad.
    Change the line PhysXLevel=0 so that it reads PhysXLevel=1
    Save and close the file. Run the game"
,nomailx,2011-08-08T13:46Z,"
4. For a while you will have a cool game, until you meet your first grapple bug.

When this happens, do this:

make a backup of the file BmGame.ini located in- Documents/Eidos/Batman Arkham Asylum/Bm Game/config
open the file BmGame.ini with notepad and look for line ""DefaultGravityZ=-1000.0"" and set it to 0.0 and SAVE the document).

You may also wanna consider changing the line below to -0.5 instead of -1.5.

In some place like the small room before young's office, the gravity won't help you since you have to pass under a lower door, and then go back up.

So here is what you do:

While you float, if you turn your camera up (look at batman from the top), he will go down slowly. If you turn camera down, batman will go up slowly. By changing the gravity settings, and the physx settings line just below, and trying to do this trick you will finally pass the door, and reach the vent which is above. I did it in 10 mins, but it requires many tries. You may also wanna try different gravity settings. It's a challenge but it works.

For the other grapple bugs, the gravity tricks will work normally. For the one in the mansion, the wind won't allow you to enter the vent above the balcony. Then just use the glide trick. It's simple. Float in the air, and glide to the vent. If u miss it, try again."

,nomailx,2011-08-08T14:01Z,"5. Unfortunately, later in the game, you will meet an invisible wall while trying to go back in the botanic gardens. Do not panic. Watch this video and do the same:

(search ""batman invisible wall pass 2 "" in u tbe)

It works. I did in the the 2nd try."
,nomailx,2011-08-08T14:01Z,"6. That's not all unfortunately, When u will enter poison ivy's room, you will fall in a dark room. Here is the ultimate solution for this. You will use someone elses save: Here it is.

http://pctroubleshooting.ro/topic/8308-batman-arkham-asylum-poison-ivy-savegame-invisible-wall-grapple-fix/

The site is in spanish but the instructions are in english.

Do as said, and it will work. Note that your save game location may differ regarding your windows version."
,nomailx,2011-08-08T14:03Z,"7. (spoiler alert)

When fighting in the joker's room if you lose many times, sometimes the retry options sends you in the same room but this time the room is empty. Just restart at the last checkpoint. It will work. If not restart the game, it will work for sure.

8. When you will finish the game there will be one last bug that eidos left for you. The 2nd part of the ending movie will be missing, and u will be left with a black screen.

Well, this one is pretty easy. 

--Spoiler alert--

Once you beat the Beast Joker, and punch him with the explosive, the game is finished. So it doesn't matter if you watch the final cinematic from the game, or from youtube.

So feel free to watch the ending from u tbe here:

(search ""Batman Arkham Asylum Ending (HD)"" in u tbe

Check out also the alternative Bane ending.

And show the finger to the developpers who left so many bugs to ruin this game.

GL HF dudes."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-08-08T20:40Z,@nomailx Because of the problems you are writing about I dropped playing the game when it came out in 2009 - it's no fun.
,Ch1r0n3x,2011-08-09T00:53Z,"I had a problem with re-installing the game, I had a 9000 etc error, something about the firewall. I solved it by deleting the game entry using CCleaner.

I just re-installed it, re-cracked it, it works perfectly :-)"
,zaroba,2011-08-14T15:50Z,"@dontpissmeoff

If I click no it takes me back to the ""Press Start"" option.

2. Once you enter the opening cut scene with batman bringing the joker into Arkham, I skipped it and still there is no ""Live"" option nor can I hit the big button on the controller or the home key on the keyboard

3. Before going back to the desktop, a screen pops up with more options and your story completion. I see a ""Live"" option in orange, but once I click on it and nothing happens.

,Refrayin,2011-10-24T20:04Z,"@zantetsuken4 There's plenty of seeders so stop whining.
Also if you can't find where to create a ""offline live account"" just click create a new account, at the bottom of the window that appears it says something like ""create a local account"" in blue writing. Just click that and input your username."

-------------------------------------------------------------

1. There are over 700 seeders, if you are downloading slow, try to google ""How to speed up u-torrent"" you might need to open ports somewhere

2. I know how to create account, my problem is that I do not see the option to make one. Where exactly is this Offline Account option? Is it in the moon?! up batman' ass?! because I am not getting the option to make one."
,PaganCh,2011-10-25T03:03Z,@kaiserphoenix The latests versions of Games for Windows Live (GFWL) lacks the option to create an offline account. You'll have to download an older version (3.2 works fine).

,Dragice,2011-10-25T15:14Z,"@kaiser: your problem is probably simple enough: you're running it on vista. A lot of problems there, even with support. No, I'm not being a hater, it probably is meant to run perfectly, but it might not. Try compatability mode.

Lads, there's almost 800 seeders. The problem is not seeders. It's the fact that there's more than 750 leechers. Is everyone getting this one because the sequel came out lol?

For those of you complaining about the crack: you probs put in the wrong place. Check what you did with it.

For those of you with the windows live games error: Here's a tip for you. You can create a games for windows live account outside of the game. Do some googling, get the account, and presto, good to go."

How I did it:

I know the problems is that in the start windows THERE IS NOT a Windows Live Games button!!! what I did was, I download and replace the original crack whit this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5089551/Batman_Arkham_Asylum_Crack_Only-RELOADED  and then I install the update (1.1) this one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5097254/Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs then I start the the game and SOLVE!!! when you start the game, in the part where batman is looking at the moon the windows live games banner will appear, then you just make a local account (offline) and THAT'S IT!!! at least worked for me...

RESUME:

1) Install new crack
2) Install Update (patch 1.1)
3) ENJOY!

NOTE: the patch generates 3 folders and some files ""binaries"", ""bmgame"" and ""engine"" you have to combine them with the originals and say yes to replace the files."

The game seems to have created an association with this account and is no longer giving me the option to create an offline account. Is there any way to reset this?

What am I doing wrong? Anyone can help me, please."

4. Download mody6543's v.1.1 crack from google/filetram
5. Put all files from the crack into the binaries folder in the program files.

This worked perfectly for me. if it doesnt work, try contacting me!
Thank you Rock53!"

,deathislife,2012-07-23T02:06Z,"Okay, so I downloaded this game, the Crack thing people were suggesting, and something with the name of Content, which I think is the Vida thing. That's downloading right now. Can anyone please explain, in English to someone who does not know a lot about torrents and stuff like this, what to do after this things are downloaded? The help would be greatly appreciated."
,marcol000,2012-07-25T17:14Z,"I'm so sick of these RELOADED torrents. Do they actually check if it works or not? It's great that so many people here puts up suggestions to making it work, but shouldn't RELOADED to it themselves? Why do i have to go on other sites and download patches and cracks? That means the only thing their releases are good for are the original ISO files which i can just make from somewhere else."
,marcol000,2012-07-25T17:16Z,"I understand that it's getting harder to crack games due to the improved security that the game companies use, but that just means that RELOADED should just stop making releases if they can't do it."
