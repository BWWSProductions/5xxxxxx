I assume the xbox360, but just like his other rips that ""he has tested on the xbox"",
this does NOT work on the xbox360!!!!!

,ferla1978,2010-01-17T23:27Z,"video gegevens niet ondersteund op samsung lcd sierie 6 ????
nog iemand dit probleem "
,bychance,2010-01-18T04:38Z,"Converted to Mpeg2 with Xilisoft HD and burned to DVD with Nero7. Excellent results as usual with your uploads S.M., thanks a lot. Now I'm waiting for a good copy of Alvin and the Chipmonks 2, any way you can do it?. One By Oileywater is a scam."
,jelle3434,2010-01-23T01:35Z,"@ferla1978

het ligt niet aan je beelscherm,
het ligt aan je driver, download bijvoorbeeld VLC player.

Dat is een gratis programma waarmee je alle films mee kan afspelen"
,ferla1978,2010-01-23T11:21Z,"jelle3434 
ik speel mijn filmen af via externe schijf op mijn lcd tv maar sommige films gaan wel en dan sommige niet 
zijn allemaal filmen van secret myth met de zelfde video uitput ????"

,RexRuudy,2010-05-13T12:45Z,"Fuckin' sweet dude. Insane quality, fast download, and a great movie! Haven't seen this in a while, and I missed it when it was on TV last night."
,44414,2010-05-18T15:40Z,could someone tell me if this release is 5.1ch?cos it is not mentioned in the name unlike other secretmyth releases like THE MATRIX BOX SET????? 
,frenzier,2010-05-19T15:11Z,great movie thanks
,psprapper,2010-06-13T03:24Z,"@ 44414

read the discription dude!!!!

btw it's 6 channel, secretmyth always releases films with 6 channel and 2 channel (2 chnl to play on xbox360)"
,FastClau,2010-06-30T10:51Z,"tnx mate, looks impressive!"
,Glock40clbr,2010-10-05T19:30Z,Why is it that hackers always have to make stupid pictures with notepad...you cant even read the nfo file...its like a friggin fukked up roadmap made by a second grader. Its the same way with keygens and their stupid sound files...you cant open a keygen without hearing a friggin stupid ass lame song...I just dont get it.
,hell81007,2011-01-05T14:08Z,"@Ravisawalia is right. Without a shadow of a doubt secretmyth is one of the greatest uploaders but some of his releases, like this one, are extremely dark which mars the viewing experience. After d/l this one i downloaded bellboy's http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5737388 which seems far better as far as darkness is concerned."
,zammil23,2011-08-06T08:51Z,"which is better secretmyth or bellboy(remastered edition).secretmyth bdrip is said to be much darker compared to bellboy which is ripped from the remastered edition.plz anyone tell me.I'm confused over which one to download
Thanks. "
,nandy002,2011-08-13T21:29Z,can the 2 channel of this movie be played on normal 2.1 PC speakers??
,Buzzfly,2012-04-02T08:22Z,"I must say, normally I'm a fan of these releases, but it's almost as through the sharpness and saturation were turned up to high while encoding this. Once you notice it it'll bug you throughout the whole movie... I downloaded another 720p Extended Cut to make sure I was just crazy and when running the two side by side you can definitely notice. I would recommend finding a different download."
