This is a rather strange South African film (a Troma pick-up) and in the introduction by the director (and thankfully not the increasingly annoying Lloyd Kaufman), he mentions that it's a combination of horror, dark comedy, and some references toward the direction South Africa was headed in at the time. Well, if you don't know anything about South African politics, I think you'll find yourself as lost as I was.
