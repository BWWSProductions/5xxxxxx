Perhaps no masterpiece but Space Oddity Bowie's second release was a pretty damn good album. Good combination of Folk,Psychadelic and Rock. Although called Space Oddity after the first track on the album also Bowie's first hit single the album itself is far from being Spacey or strange. bowie obviously was very influenced by Dylan and others and he probably showed more his influence then himself on the album and perhaps that's the reason why so many music critics have overlooked Space Oddity ( originally titled Man of Sound or music or whatever). This album is by no means a masterpiece but it is good nevertheless.My personal favorites on here are "Space Oddity," "Cygnet Committee," "An Occasional Dream," "Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud," and "Memory of a Free Festival," especially "Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud!" I love that song and I always play it around three times until I move on to "God Knows I'm Good." Man, that would be so cool if he'd do just one more folk/glam rock album. I really like the newer stuff he's done, but nothing beats folk and glam.
