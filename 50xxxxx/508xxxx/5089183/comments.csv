**The Body reads**
""E_INVALIDARG : XLiveInitialize(&xii)""

anyone have a work around for this... I did run the game fine once after install, i closed it and tried to run it after dinner and got that error"
,Teknothug,2009-09-17T02:50Z,"ok 

I figured that one out as well... and I have to say im pretty sad. apperently there is a problem with using the iz3d 3D Monitor with the game. the monitors drivers are ""blocking"" the X Drivers or something. and i was DYING to play this in 3D!!
BUT....if any of you guys figure out a way around this, shoot over to www.iz3d.com and fill in those guys, they are all as upset as i am   :)

,Alluboy,2009-09-24T21:46Z,"@Metroidn1f

If you're having trouble in the beginning, the only advice I have is that remember to save ammo, which means, keep punching and kicking the enemies. Also, if there are too many enemies to handle, run, and find a better place to take care of them. Also, make good use of the explosive and flammable barrels. Oh, and if you are low on ammo, health and money, you can always replay the earlier chapters too. 


I have one question btw, and I hope of someone could answer this. Is it possible to play this in LAN with Hamachi? And is it possible to play this, or the RELOADED version online, if you make an online profile to LIVE?"

,ZERO_BS,2009-10-04T14:18Z,"Works great. Too bad it's just an average game.

It's not scary... not one bit. There's no tension, or anything remotely creepy. Nothing ever jumps out at you, and there are cutscenes warning you of practically every enemy attack.

Your partner is stupid and gets in the way. She won't even sidestep to let you past in tight spaces, so expect some annoyances while being bludgeoned to death. I think her only purpose is to burn through ammo like there's no tomorrow.

You can't fucking move while shooting, or even reloading... whose bright idea was that? I don't care if the originals were that way; that was because of console limitations at the time... why cripple a modern DX10 game just to make it feel retro? Do you know how annoying it is to get chainsawed apart because you're glued to the fucking ground trying to do something as BASIC as reload? Why should I have to run and hide just to do something I could do on the move? Why can't I even walk while aiming? People say it ""adds to the realism"". To that, I say: Fuck you, you fucking idiot. I'm glad you're not training our SWAT teams.

I have no idea what they were thinking... this was their big chance to evolve beyond Playstation One, and they royally fucked it. Fanboys will be the downfall of this franchise because they refuse to let it evolve.

I beat it, and can say I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I tried STALKER first, and bought it immediately. Now THAT game has atmosphere, and my full financial support. "
,ZERO_BS,2009-10-04T16:05Z,"Oh, yeah- it looks great though. Very nice...

Could have been great. Maybe future mods can fix the movement, (lack of) difficulty, and creepiness."

The over-the-shoulder perspective causes your avatar to constantly block a third of the screen (at least on a 4:3 screen).

clumsy inventory handling and strange level design: You actually need a key to open a door where anyone would normally just slip past.

nice graphics, though."

FPS isn't important, because i was getting 15-20fps at benchmark utility but game was running smoothly even at high settings with 4xAA. My specs are P4 3.0Ghz, 1GB Ram, 8600GT Sonic+ and i'm using Windows 7. As i said, i'm playing now and it's running smoothly.

If you get xlive.dll missing error it means you didn't install Games for Windows Live. This program is needed to play the game.

Also you don't need serial or windows live account to save the game. When it asks you to create profile click yes. Then create new profile > offline profile at Games for Windows Live screen. Now you can save your progress. Have fun.

And thank you Shroo."

Also you dont have to run the tptb file

I have DirectX 10 and it would not find the file

,MiracleWorker93,2011-03-15T16:56Z,"For all the idiot retards who say this doesnt work, it does. The reason it is half the size is because it is a Zip file, meaning it is compressed. The Xlive error you get is the XBOX Live program missing on your PC. Go Download GFWL (Games For Windows Live), install it. When RE5 asks you for a serial say no. Create a profile, make an offline account, and use that. That will let you save and play Co-Op on Lan. Nothing is ripped. If your computer cannot handle the specs for this game, go download a Pre-2.0 Version of GameBooster or any other PC Booster technology. Read the instructions to boost your game, and when choosing what to boost, choose the Launcher.exe. When all is said and done, this game will be like you just bought it, able to play 1280 X 760 On All Medium - High settings with motion Blur and you will thank Uploader. If you want to be generous, Seed, or donate to PirateBay so Pirates can do their thing."

Also I am not a noob.

Now for TPTB team of person or who the fuck it is.... Don't bother uploading games or files that you don't know to make to work proper, full and without any problems... Cause mates you are wasting our time...

,ebasoufeliz,2011-07-05T23:29Z,"Hey, is there any way of playing Co-op through lan here, I mean, via tunngle?
I could see some rooms while playing, giving priority to the Tunngle, and then entered the game. I could see some rooms, but I couldn't connect to'em. I'm going to try it with a friend of mine wich I'm sure that has this version, and then we'll see. Hope anyone can say anything 'bout this?"
,ebasoufeliz,2011-07-06T15:56Z,"@ebasoufeliz
I tested, and worked. I couldn't enter no one's room, but only my friend's one. And, well, it worked, at least. If'm right, you need to have the same version. And, there's some bugs, sometimes, but nothing really importante. Just close and open the game. Oh, I had to use one archive that TeknoGods made, to give priority to Tunngle. Only this way you can see rooms through tunngle. Just search for his forum and download the archive. Its a .reg archive."

In fact I was at the loading screen where they're going on about Umbrella's History, etc. Then, I would get minimized and hit with a fatal error called something like ""Failed to Open File - omcartridge.arc '2' "" and the game just boots back to desktop.

,Ganeshvo,2012-02-26T08:34Z,"latest comment in year 2012
no errors in zip.

this games works great 
just extra 2 files is needed to download to play this game which is not present in this file
1.xlive.dll
2.msidcrl40 dll
so download it from google and paste into the resident evil 5 folder

if you get error like xliveinitialize
then delete xlive.dll to remove error.

if possible download registry file for resident evil 5 and paste into the resident evil 5 folder

link for registry file was:http://www.regfiles.net/file/102/

"
,Ganeshvo,2012-02-26T08:46Z,"no error in this file while extracting 
to install this game just click setup 
it takes about 20-30 mins to install for me 4gb RAm
after install game folder will increase it size to 7.89gb.

just two extra files are needed to play this game that are
1.xlive.dll
2.msidcrl40 dll

just download this 2 files from google and paste into resident evil 5 folder.

if possible download resident evil 5 registry file and paste into the resident file 5 folder 
run the registry file.
link:http://www.regfiles.net/file/102/

if error comes like this: e_fail xliveinitialize &xii
just delete the xlive.dll to overcome this error.

thankyou."

RE4 was the worst. It wasn't even ""survival"" horror, it was just run & gun with practically unlimited ammunition. In the version I played I couldn't even strafe. Pathetic...

This one is similar, and it feels a lot like dead space, but at least it has co-op.

,superkiller32,2012-07-19T22:37Z,i realize that the way you install this game is clearly different from the usual method(using a .exe file). does installing the game like this have a negative impact on your computer when installing it or playing it ?? my apolgies for this kind of question but i'm kind of paranoid
