[V],GoodFilms,2009-09-13T17:10Z,you can't call it BLURAY if the source isn't a BLU-RAY DISC.

,moshster,2009-09-13T18:35Z,"Curious as to why the width is 1916 and 1920?  Full HD monitors running in dot-by-dot mode will have to stretch the 1916 image to fill 1920 pixels thus engaging extra video processing and probably adding noise in the process.

Since the file is over 4.7 Gb anyway, wouldn't it have made more sense to aim for a 8Gb file..."

Notice that the color is more naural and more shadow detail is visible (around her hair for instance)."
