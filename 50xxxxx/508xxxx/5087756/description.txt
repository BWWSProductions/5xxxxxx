                NOTES.........: New x264 codec rev = MUCH better compression, smaller files.



                                Source is a bluray constructed from a 1080p HDTV stream

                                (1080p Sky Broadcasting/1080p German Premier Caps).



                                hV's version has a source of 1440x1080i... erm no no not good!

                                This source has a bit-rate of 35Mbps and AC3 5.1EX sound. 



                                I will be honest. Some scenes don't look bluray quality. But

                                loads of other scenes look amazing. What you see in the scenes

                                is near to the source.



                                Thank-you WOOKIE GROOMER for all your hard work on source.

                                He's been working on it since Feb 2009 so ty very much
