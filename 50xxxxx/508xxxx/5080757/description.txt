This is Alan Scholl's informative video presentation A Case for Repealing NAFTA and Blocking the NAU (2007) which exposes the globalist plans for an American version of the European Union simply called NAU - North American Union. The EU was put into place incrementally over fifty years, not by the citizens of the member states, but by the efforts of an intellectual elite who disguised their ultimate goal of a regional government. Today, a bloated, unelected bureaucracy has rule over hundreds of millions of people - people who have no say over the EU's actions... or their own futures. A merger of the United States, Mexico and Canada enabled through NAFTA and called the North American Union is arguably the greatest current threat to freedoms of Americans under the U.S. Constitution. This amazing video presents many of the reasons why the American people must take action. 35 min. long. A must see for everyone.
