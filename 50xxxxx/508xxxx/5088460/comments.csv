,Flawz777,2010-03-20T00:59Z,man this game is cool too bad noone is seeding it
,jthm420,2011-02-20T18:34Z,"well the uploader isnt trusted, so right off the hop it's high risk, that coupled with it having so little seeds, no rating and no comments tells me not to download itbecause it probably does contain some sort of virus or worm or something, i'm not saying it does as i wouldnt know, but what i can say is i'm not chancing it, and if anyone does take a chance downloading it, good luck to ya, cuz it's only a matter of time before one of the chambers in the game of russian roulette you're playing with your computer is loaded with malware that will either eat the boot layers of your hard drive, fry your motherboard, burn your power supply out, or something of that sort that we all know malware so well for ;]
