When it says that Need for Speed has stopped and can not start that means that there is either some problem with what you did to install (Follow the directions) or your computer sucks.

Then I copied all the files downloaded from this torrent and pasted them in to the game folder I just installed, i believe thats what ""copy cracked files"" meant.

When i start the game, it asks me to insert the cd. I do have Daemon tools but no file opens with it or there is no image file i can use.

+1

If you're getting a black screen when starting up the game, DO THIS:

Simple steps of fixing it


1. Go to Documents and you will find a folder NFS SHIFT
2. Open the folder and you will find graphicsconfig.xml, delete it and you are done

Note: If still you are getting the errors please cut and backup the copy of the folder NFS SHIFT in a differnet directory and try

If it still does not work go to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts] and delete the Electronic arts registry entry.
