Also look for other stuff by Gottman as its really helpful.  e.g.  ""The Relationship Cure"",  ""10 Lessons to Transform your Marriage"", ""Why Marriages Succeed or Fail"" and ""The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work"".  All good books and worth buying so you can read them several times and write your own notes in them.  Getting your partner to read them is also an excellent idea.    "
