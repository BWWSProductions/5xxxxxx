An audiobook from the Dr John Gottman series on love, relationships, marriage and repair.   This is a book that helps you to fix what is wrong in your relationships, and make your relationship or marriage tronger.

Dr John Gottman at the Gottman Institute has written several excellent books on marriage and relationships, based on scientific studies on marriage and relationships over many years.

This stuff really does work.  Its not a fancy gimmick.  It really does help strengthen relationships and marriages.

Good Luck.
