,schtaaf,2009-09-17T20:03Z,"I installed the evaluation version and applied the patch successfully, but the program keeps coming back asking me to agree to the license. And afterwards it terminates.  Could anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?"

Hi, 
1. drag the contents of the ""Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended.rar"" onto your desktop.

2. click the ""APEX9_Win_WEB_WWEFG.exe"" this will install the program, dont worry about a code just install the trial version.

3. When its installed open the ""Adobe_Acrobat_v9.0.0_Pro_Extended_by_CiM.rar"" file and drag the ""patch.exe"" file onto the desktop.

4. click the ""patch.exe"" file, then use the browse button and point it to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\Acrobat\AMTLibWrapper.dll"" or ""C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\Acrobat\AMTLibWrapper.dll""

Is it possible to try to crack a software called  devFus     versione 1.01a ?
The Homepage Link.. is http://www.devcad.com/ita/download.htm 

Its a FANTASTIC little program (12.9 MB) for design fuselages for radiocontrol airplanes. The most amazing thing is that from one design the program can make the various sections of the fuselage and also the 3d fuselage and also the jig that support the fuselage during the construction.
I am sure that many persons out there are interesting regarding programs like this. 
You can use this program but without the possibility of saving or printing the results.
If you can make a crack it would be wonderfull because there are not free programs like that out there.
Best regards

Adobe CS4 Design Premium Stopped Working

Posted by A. Cemal Ekin on January 19, 2009 路 8 Comments 

Whatever the reason, I could not run any Adobe application this afternoon. This was after all my trials and tribulations as outlined in some earlier posts, frustrating. As I launched Photoshop or Acrobat, I received a message window to tell me that ?The license for this product stopped working? on its title bar and instructed me to contact my IT department. At the end of the message there was a cryptic error code ?148:3?.

My product was fully installed, running, and performing well. So it was a licensing issue I thought. I looked in the directory:

C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Aplication Data\FLEXnet

and saw a .log file. Looking into this text file revealed a message ?Our service is disabled.? If you run into this problem, you may want to know what I did. I am telling you what I did and you follow it at your own risk.

   1. I went to ?Start/Run? and typed ?services.msc? into the ?Open? field, then pressed [Enter]
   2. Looked for ?FLEXnet Licensing Service? under the column labeled ?Name?
   3. Its status showed ?Stopped? which was the cause of my problem
   4. I right-clicked on ?FLEXnet Licensing Service?, selected ?Properties?
   5. Under the ?General? tab, I set the startup type to ?Manual? and clicked on ?Start? to start the service
   6. I was not sure about this, but I tried it anyway: Under ?Recovery? tab for the first failure, I chose ?Restart the Service?
   7. Clicked OK

Photoshop and Acrobat started fine. I do not know what made the licensing service to stop. But now, I know how to kick start that again."
