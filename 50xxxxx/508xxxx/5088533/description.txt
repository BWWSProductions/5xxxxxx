Decibel 2009 (SMCCD17)

Seismic Records 
3-CD release: at Decibel 15 August 2009

On Saturday, August 15, b2s Events will be holding the 8th edition of the major outdoor festival 
for harder styles: DECIBEL! Just as in previous years Decibel will take place at the huge nature park 
â€˜Beekse Bergenâ€™ in Hilvarenbeek, and this year itâ€™s bigger than everâ€¦
After the fantastic 2008 edition (which was visited by about 30.000 people) b2s Events will once again be 
pulling out all stops to ensure that Decibel 2009 will be one of the highlights of your summer.
This yearâ€™s edition will be visited by 40.000 (!!) people as b2s has been given the opportunity to enlarge the 
festival property, meaning more comfort and capacity for the visitors. The locationâ€™s unique features such as 
the wooden areaâ€™s, hills and the beach will be done full justice as result. 

Decibel is the festival where a variety of b2s concepts come together every year. In addition to the Decibel 
mainstage, back2school, Hardcore4Life, Refuse, Pussy Lounge, UP, Darkness4Life, Remember and 1992is4you! 
will all once again be represented. A new addition this year is the Euphoria stage. This means all of the hard styles 
will be there, and all will be represented by a varied mix of national and international top artists. Not only does this 
include the old hands yet also todayâ€™s heroes and the faces of tomorrow!

As every year b2s Events and Seismic Records present the official Decibel compilation, and again this 2009 edition 
is launched just after the festival weekend. This yearâ€™s edition contains three slamminâ€™ cdâ€™s mixed by several headliners 
of the Decibel 2009 festival. 
Disc one presents a monster hardstyle mix by the leading hardstyle duo of the moment: 
D-BLOCK & S-TE-FAN, these youngsters offer a wicked mix with best tracks found in hardstyle today.
Disc two is mixed by hardcore heroe THE VIPER, the man who will close the mainstage this year brings you a killer 
hardcore mix as only this highly skilled superstar dj can do!
Disc three takes us back to the early days of hardstyle, Dutch founders of Seismic Records BEHOLDER & BALISTIC 
took of the dust of loads of major hardstyle classics and brewed a fantastic early hardstyle mix, a highlight on this triple pack!

The compilation is again presented in a luxurious digi pak, of course designed in the classic Decibel artwork which makes 
this triple pack a collectorâ€™s item for all visitors of the Decibel festival and all lovers of harder dance styles in general!
