>
> BrÃ¼no is a gay Austrian fashion guru. He has his 
> own fashion based television show, Funkyzeit,
> the most popular German-language show of its kind 
> outside of Germany. After he disgraces himself in 
> front of his Funkyzeit fan base, he is ruined in 
> German speaking Europe. He decides that in his
> quest for worldwide fame, he will move to Los 
> Angeles and reinvent himself. Accompanying him 
> to the US is Lutz, his former assistant's assistant.
> Lutz is the only person left in his circle that
> still believes in BrÃ¼no's greatness. BrÃ¼no 
> goes through one reinvention of himself after
> another, ultimately straying to areas far removed 
> from his own self. Perhaps when BrÃ¼no finds an 
> activity that he truly does love, he will also
> find that Ã¼ber-fame he so desperately desires.
