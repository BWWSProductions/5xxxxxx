3 albums from legendary The Ventures lead guitarist Nokie Edwards.  Very smooth, elegant and assured playing throughout, Nokie can work a melody like not many others.  Highly recommended for fans of Chet Atkins, Les Paul, Jerry Reed, Mark Knopfler and the like.

Albums:

1. Carvin' It Out
2. Hitchhiker
3. No Boundaries

Enjoy and please seed!
