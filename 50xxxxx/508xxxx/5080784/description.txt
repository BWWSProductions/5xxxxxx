This is Richard Kershaw's amazing video documentary All Hail the Supreme Architect of the Universe - Conversations on Freemasonry which is a non-mainstream English documentary on Freemasonry and the supposed role it plays in our society. It features interviews with two Freemasons and two researchers who are trying to understand what Freemasonry is all about. It's a short but interesting investigative video on what Masons are not telling us about their private club that is apparently not even a secret society anymore. Find out what they have to say about themselves. 15 min. long. A must see for everyone.
