Cross the equator and follow in the footsteps of the Incas to discover ancient artifacts. Learn the magic of the great Inca by solving tricky puzzles in exotic locations. Not your typical "swap-and-match" puzzle, this game lets you select an entire strip of tiles to match three or more of the same kind. Can you unearth each artifact to find the Treasures of the Ancient Cavern? Play this tale of fantasy, adventure and ancient magic to find out.
