,CrazySan,2009-09-06T15:35Z,"I've been wondering when this was gonna come out, been wanting to try it.  Now everyone remember the most important rule of downloading.  If you like the game, try to show your support for the people that put the time in to make it and buy the game"
,CrazySan,2009-09-06T16:06Z,"I think it's broken.  when I unzip the files all i get is setup.part40.rar  Help please?  I've tried unziping that one and I've tried renaming it setup.rar, but it just says that I need the other parts of the file"
,Oompz,2009-09-06T20:47Z,"Thanks!
Works great, good game!"
,Oompz,2009-09-06T20:48Z,"CrazySan - First you have to unpack all .rar's separately, then you unrar 1 of the result rar's and get the setup file. :)"
,CrazySan,2009-09-06T21:19Z,"okay....kinda have to wonder why they did it like that, but thanks"
,hellhammer69,2009-09-09T21:28Z,Works great thanks.

,RadGH,2009-11-04T10:52Z,"What a stupid way to package the game. Split zips inside a zip?

Whats the point in a zip in the first place? The total filesize of the provided zip's is 193 MB. The total filesize of the installer is 188 MB.

It takes up even more space. Plus you have to extract it...twice... then install it!

Oh well. Thanks for the upload!"
,craft000,2009-11-18T23:47Z,"STUPID, why do you upload a full version of this game and then tell people to buy it and show support, that doesnt give you the morale high ground, if you wanted to show your support you wouldnt have uploaded the game in the first place.

im downloading this and im not buying the game. neither is anyone else who is downloading it."
,NinBan,2009-11-22T22:19Z,"@craft000
You're the stupid one. In fact many people, after playing the game and liking it, choose to buy it in respect of the developpers. Sure, he could have uploaded a demo (if there exists one) but demos are known to only show the coolest and less-frustrating aspects of a game so they are not completely relevant."
,Mik0ri,2010-02-10T12:35Z,"Good torrent, great game. That's really all that needs to be said."
,candylord,2010-05-04T20:33Z,"Great torrent, worked like a charm!

Great game too! Love it!"
,stalker59,2011-04-09T10:38Z,"thanks ;-D
