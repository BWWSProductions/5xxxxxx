When you save but nothing happens
Actually the save works, and put the saved games in my documents/mygames/red faction../[user]
it seems its a problem with the characters( if u are using a non english os)
so i solved the problem:
1. download the latest patch(google red faction manual patch) from the official site
2. crak it down by gamec0pyw0rld

or 

rename the folders(didnt try it) in the english names"

And when something makes sound, you end up hearing it for the next 5-10 minutes even if whatever it is isnt make noise anymore.

To activate a offline account do the following:
1.Open/start up game until you reach menu.
2.Go New Game and the GFWL should pop up.
3. Press Create New Profile (AFTER THAT DO NOT PRESS CONTINUE) scroll down the page where it says ""Games For Windows Live"" until you see a hyperlink which says ""create a local profile""
4. Finally type in your user name and your basically finished and ready to start your epic mission... ^.^

,jEase_Us,2010-06-01T18:25Z,"""This mission starts just west of your western safehouse in Eos. Headover to the marker and take out the handful of EDF troops there. Enterthe building and you'll find the console. Once here you'll take controlof a satellite. You'll see a top down view, but the camera doesn't zoomout. Use the guns to destroy any vehicle that gets near the truck. Youhave unlimited ammo, so just keep shooting. Eventually the truck willstop and you'll have to destroy a roadblock. Each of the tanks willtake several shots to destroy. Blast everything and the truck willstart moving. ""

I've this bug here, the yellow truck keeps maneuvering like in a loop even though there's nothing on the road anymore and it's clear for it to move forward. Did anyone got this? on v1.2
I'm not sure how to workaround this... Ideas?
It's as if the for the yellow truck there is still a roadblock present of sorts, but there's not even debris left."

,jEase_Us,2010-06-02T14:35Z,"I uninstalled everything (GFWL and redist, RFG and its options) but I kept the savegames. Installed RFG again but didn't patch it, and I used the crack on the DVD and didn't change any options from the default. And well same thing happens lol
To note that all programs are blocked from accessing the internet and I am using an offline local profile for GFWL as described above (thank you btw). So the options didn't remain because I deleted them, but I kept the savegames (restored them after uninstall succeeded) and GFWL was able to log me in automatically on the offline local profile. So no problems except that odd weird behavior. Oh did I mention that the yellow truck (yellow aura truck) is sometimes invincible when it's stuck doing the maneuvering. And if it mistakenly hits a leftover tank (these leftovers disappear if you move your camera away from the scene) it will move it without any trouble and if I hit Space it centers a bit before where the two tanks were and it's not moving from there, meanwhile the yellow truck keeps maneuvering as if trying to find a new path...

I also removed the savegames from C:\Users\youruser\Documents\My Games\Red Faction Guerrilla\Saves\
I kept the game installed(and its options folder), ran it and created new local offline profile (I even gave it a different name).

If the game doesnt work on low settings then you might as well uninstall the game and stop wasting your time. You're computer is a steaming pile of shit. 

But if you would like to improve the lag, I suggest you turn the graphics to max, and put a bunch of towels over your computer. Then take a piss on it.
