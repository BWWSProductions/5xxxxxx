"Gone Too Soon" is a song recorded by American musician Michael Jackson. It was written by Buz Kohan and Larry Grossman, and co-produced by Bruce Swedien and Jackson for the singer's eighth studio album, Dangerous (1991). The song was also mixed by Swedien, and featured instrumentation by artists such as Steve Porcaro, Michael Boddicker, Abraham Laboriel and Paulinho Da Costa. "Gone Too Soon" was dedicated to the memory of Jackson's friend Ryan White, a teenager from Kokomo, Indiana who came to national attention, after being expelled from his school for having HIV/AIDS.

The song was released on December 1, 1993, as the ninth and final single from the Dangerous album. Following its releaseâ€”on World AIDS Day of 1993â€”"Gone Too Soon" became a moderate chart success in several countries: France, Germany, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. The song was not released in the US, but became a hit in Africa, where it charted at number 3. "Gone Too Soon" was not a significant critical success, as it received mixed reviews from music critics.

"Gone Too Soon" was promoted with a music video directed by Bill DiCicco, which showed footage of Jackson and White together, as well as scenes from the latter's funeral. A live performance by Jackson at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration also served as a promotional platform, for both the song and AIDS-related funding. "Gone Too Soon" later received more exposure, following the deaths of both Diana, Princess of Wales and Jackson himself.
