Pier Paolo Pasolini

SalÃ² o le 120 giornate di Sodoma
Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom
1975 (2008 BFI Blu-ray)

The world's most controversial film comes to DVD and Blu-ray in 2-disc editions. Presented fully uncut and in its most complete version, the film has been re-mastered from the original Italian restoration negatives.

Pier Paolo Pasolini's final and most shocking film has been banned, censored and reviled the world over since its first release in 1975. SalÃ² did not receive UK certification until late 2000, when it was passed uncut. The BFI then released it on DVD in 2001 and, despite having been out of print for almost three years, the title still ranks amongst BFI's all-time top 10 best-selling DVDs.

The film's content and imagery is extreme and it retains the power to shock, repel and distress even today. A brutal allegory based on the novel 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade, the film is a cinematic milestone - culturally significant, politically vital and visually stunning.
