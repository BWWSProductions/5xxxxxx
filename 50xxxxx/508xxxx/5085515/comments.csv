[T],Apokarteron,2009-09-15T23:33Z,"20 seeders just vanished, come back, don't leave me alone with this load!"
[T],Apokarteron,2009-09-15T23:41Z,"Come on guys, be fair.  Seed at least a ratio of 1:00 before you stop."
,dingo-138,2009-09-16T22:11Z,"So what am I missing? How is this file playable?
Nothing seems to work."
