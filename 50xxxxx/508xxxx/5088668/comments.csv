,Philonetic,2011-03-05T10:54Z,"1. You've made an overloaded package using other peoples models, handling, skins, etc.
2. You DO NOT have permission from the mod authors to upload this.  Its like reuploading a razor1911 game and claiming it for yourself if you dont atleast give credit to EVERY AUTHOR that made a mod in your package.

-mark from me, get permissions next time."
