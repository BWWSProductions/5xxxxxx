Suicide - Live 1977-1978

Quote:
Limited edition of 3000, x 6 CD set of high quality "audio verite" recordings of Suicide playing
live in September 1977 to August 1978! As you will hear, a crucial year in Suicide's development
and their mission to stretch the label of Punk Rock to the very limit.
Plus a 64 page booklet of Suicide & Red Star Records memorabilia from the personal archives of
Howard Thompson, the A&R man that signed Suicide to UK Bronze Records.
Only the infamous "23 Minutes Over Brussels" has been released before !!
All mastered by Denis Blackham for optimum listening pleasure.
