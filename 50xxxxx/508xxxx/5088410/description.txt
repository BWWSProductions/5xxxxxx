Episode 131 - Create Billboard Lights
Sunday, June 21st, 2009 â€“ running time 18:43

Learn how to create Iron Man's glowing chestplate and the lights that highlight the art on a billboard.

*** Create Iron Man's illuminated chest piece
Start on a canvas filled with a black background. In a new layer named Disc, create a vertical oval marquee, then fill with white. You'll be adding some effects to this disc give it some dimension. In layer styles, give the object a light blue Inner Glow. Make sure the blend mode is not Screen, because the color won't show up. Instead, us Multiply. Also add a small inner shadow.
The background is the chest, so change the color from black to a reddish color. Create a copy of the disc layer, and apply an Outer Glow. Use the same blue tone as the inner glow. You can dump the effect copied over on the copied layer. Apply a gaussian blur to the glowing layer.

*** Prep the billboard lights
In Bert's example, his billboard has 5 light sources from the lower edge of the artwork. In his light template, he applies an Inner Shadow with blend mode: screen and he uses the color white. Add a white drop shadow and match the angle of light so that they appear to be shooting upwards.

*** Add illumination
Use the pen tool to draw the light boundary. Fill the path with white. Make sure this layer is behind the light sources. Add a light gaussian blur. On the upper edge of the light, apply more gaussian blur. Do this blurring incrementally as you move the feathered selection upward. When done with adding blur, bring down the opacity of the white light. Change the entire light layer to layer mode: Screen. Duplicate this light 5 times for each light source.
The light is probably spilling outside of the billboard right now, so clip the lights to the boundaries of the billboard. Create a comp of what's visible by holding Option and choosing "Merge Visible" in the layers window. We hold option so the original layers are still in tact and not flattened.
