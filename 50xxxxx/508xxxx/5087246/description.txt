In this Energy From The Vacuum part 10,  John Bedini discusses the Kromrey Converter patented in 1968 that can produce up to 350% more energy out than in.  John gives a technical explanation and instructions on how to construct it.  It does have a lot of useless dialog that could have been better spent on construction notes but is still a good video.  Also has video of the original announcement from a 1984 free energy conference.

NOTE:  When played, the avi gives a popup "AVI Chunk Converter" which happens when the AVI file's footer was not closed correctly. This is not spy/mal/scareware.  Just close the popup and build it!
