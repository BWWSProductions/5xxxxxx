Product Description
This is the first volume in a series concentrating on Germany's Blitzkrieg tactics during the course of the Second World War. It describes in detail how the strategy evolved and how it was first deployed against the ill-prepared and poorly-armed Poles and Scandinavians, using contemporary photographs, allied with line drawings and detailed analysis.
