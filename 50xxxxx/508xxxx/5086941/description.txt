Story behind this upload:
When I was about 10 years old (1991 or so), I recorded this album to a cassette from a friend. I absolutely loved this! I didn't know the song names, so I just wrote what I thought they might be on the cassette cover, most of them 100% wrong. :D Later on, cassette players got rare and I wasn't able to listen to it anymore, so years passed.. In the Internet age I thought this album has to be out there somewhere, but I've never found it. Searching was hard too, since I didn't know the album name and only one song name for certain. So imagine my surprise when I noticed a familiar name when browsing through some random LPs at a second hand store in 2009! So here you go, some nigh-forgotten New Wave Of British Heavy Metal, served as it was in the 80's, complete with vinyl hum and grittle. :)
