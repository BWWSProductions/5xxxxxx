RELEASE NOTES

        
	MarkAble is designed for audiobook listeners who own an Apple iPod,
	or who use iTunes to listen to such books. 

	Or podcast listeners wanting to be able to combine and bookmark their
	saved files.

	Audiobook files bought from the iTunes Music Store or from Audible.com
	are â€˜bookmarkingâ€™ - that is, the iPod (or iTunes) remembers the point of
	the book where you were up to, and resumes from there when you start
	listening again. 

	This, of course, is vital.

	However, there are many other sources of audiobooks. 

	Such books may be in a variety of different formats such as MP3 files
	(for ex, from podcasts, www.audiobooksforfree.com or 
	www.telltaleweekly.com),or audio CDs or tapes you may have bought.

        MarkAble makes it easy to merge a large number of tracks or individual
        files into a few files which will bookmark on your iPod.
