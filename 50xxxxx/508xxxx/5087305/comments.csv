,Equinox117,2009-09-29T19:35Z,"downloaded in less than 5 mins, great torrent but like every version of soul silver i came across. it crashes after about an hour of gameplay. Save often. Every hour of play it crashes :( but a lot more translated than i thought... Menu, pokemon attacks, items... very simple"

,xXxLisaVanityxXx,2009-10-25T20:05Z,"I downloaded it, but once it's time for gameplay (after the professor finishes talking and you're supposed to be in the house or wherever) it goes to a black screen and won't play. :("
