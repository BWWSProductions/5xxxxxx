,Bodabengt,2009-09-10T13:20Z,I have all six parts home now and I will keep seeding them for a couple more days. Thanks again Ekolb for the upload
,asobier,2009-09-13T04:54Z,"Typically BBC  and English (not excluding Oxford) over simplistic view WW2. From the very start they repeat cliché after cliché like ?Polish cavalry charged german tanks?. Also presenting Tobruk as a French - British operation is an insult to hundreds of Poles who died there.
I don?t know why those little people keep on doing that, after all it was Polish Air Force  that stoped the Blitz in  1941 all trained before 1939. Thanks to English language they propagate this shit all over the world and no body even knows they are the Torrentinos of history. Good night BBC."
