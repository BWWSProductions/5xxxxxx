[V],Shroo,2009-09-11T17:32Z,doesnt matter ;D it will be up tomorrow morning if ill be allright :]
,darkwolverinex,2009-09-11T22:16Z,shroo is hot....
,Pro_Downloader,2009-09-12T05:03Z,so this works????
,Pro_Downloader,2009-09-12T09:45Z,i'll  d/l wen theres more seeders!!! meh
,Japacino,2009-09-12T16:51Z," Like I said before, Thank U Shroo, Best as always & All the Respectz once again!!! By the way PPL there is no testing or confirming Shroo's stuff, Just get it when he is still with us... Cheerz"
,Vonzom,2009-09-12T20:44Z,What do you guys use to make those animations? (the one that is shown when I run the TPTB exe)
,Moretakama,2009-09-13T19:33Z,"Thanks for this game. The download was a bit slow in the beginning, but then kicked
up to a few hundred KB/s. This is one of those games like Skullptura's where you
have to extract an archive before playing. This usually takes a few minutes,
depending on your computer of course.

Don't judge Mini Ninja's by is childish demenor or its storybook like visuals. Its
actually a decent action game with a fair amount of depth. Mini Ninja's is a nice
refreshing change from the constant dark and gritty settings of the current market.
If you don't play this just by the way it looks, your missing out on a good
action/adventure game. "
,eGaTS,2009-09-13T20:37Z,"I can take partial credit for the speed boost. I was driving around and tapped into an entire neighborhood that had FIOS. I ran at ~200 kbps upload the entire night. So jealous... I can't get FIOS where I live :/

Haven't had a chance to actually play it yet, but the trailers all look fun. Many thanks to the uploader!"
,eGaTS,2009-09-13T23:41Z,"I can confirm that the audio works in the cutscenes, but not during gameplay. Any solution for this? Maybe something to add to the INI file?"
,eGaTS,2009-09-14T02:04Z,"Audio issue solved! Reinstalling OpenAL fixed it for me. This is a bug inherent to the retail version of the game, not just this release. Link follows.
