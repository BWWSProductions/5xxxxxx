Imperial Glory [2005] [PC]

Single player / Multi player / Online

Imperial Glory is a game that wants to be the next Total War. Not that there's anything wrong with that. After all, 
Creative Assembly's popular strategy franchise has gotten bigger and better with every release. 
However, in copying the formula of Total War, Pyro Studios, the designers of Imperial Glory, 
have missed the small nuances and details that made the Total War games, in particular Medieval and Rome, something special. 
That leaves Imperial Glory feeling very much like an uneven first step, which is a pity, because it does have a lot of promise.
