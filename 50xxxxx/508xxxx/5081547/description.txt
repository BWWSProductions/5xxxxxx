It's March 2009 and the Queen's Dragoon Guards, known as the Welsh Cavalry, are coming to the end of their bloodiest tour of duty in 50 years. The Taliban is a determined enemy but the regiment has succeeded in keeping them at bay both in the south and north of Helmand Province.

This programme follows them during some of their final operations, including one on St David's Day, which turned into a vicious firefight in a village near Garmsir. A third of the boys in one troop are only 18 and face a huge range of dangers. 

But their sergeant, Butch Davies from Swansea, does everything he can to ensure their safety.
