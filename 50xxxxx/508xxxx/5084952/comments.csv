daVinci was definitely better as it atleast had original theme frm book. in this the motive of whole gig is screwed. + a super fucked up ending."

,foever86,2009-12-02T06:05Z,"THE AUDIO OUT OF SYNC PROBLEM CAN BE FIXED!

Guys, download Virtualdub, and open it up to delay the audio by 300ms. I tried it a few times and I think 300ms audio delay will fix the problem."
