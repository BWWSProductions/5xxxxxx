I'm sure its excelent quality. But full hd"
,Hardcode,2009-09-14T15:32Z,"Not for an animated movie, they compress much better."
,mac6435,2009-09-15T14:19Z,rar is lame but thanks
[T],insinuendo,2009-09-19T02:48Z,"just unrar the fuckin' thing and watch it for fuck's sake.

it's worth every penny!

perfect quality (and not 8 gigs).

thanks!"
,xiIix,2009-09-20T05:10Z,"This might be great quality, but it's definitely not ""perfect"". Perfect 1080p is far and few between when it comes to downloadable content. "
,xenomex,2009-09-21T15:35Z,"Excellent Quality.
Thankyou."
,mac_intel,2009-09-28T01:20Z,"The rar problem can be solved easily in two steps.

1. download the damned rar already and extract it.
2. delete rars and don't feel guilty about not seeding.

People don't expect you to keep the original rars AND a viewable copy.  So rar'd torrents are the only torrents where it is acceptable to leech and run without anyone bitching.  After all, if they expected you to seed they wouldn't have left it rar'd in the first place.  Think of it as a gift.

Simple really.  "
,Stillborne,2009-10-01T07:20Z,"OK. Once and for all....
STFU about the ""not a real  BlueRay or 1080p movie"".
Simply put If you have any deep research on the subject you would know that as of right now to actualy rip or burn a true, true, taaaaaroooo....blue ray is next to improbable for the masses.
Yes there are one or two people that do actually have the real software and to get it from them you need to be a paying member. Not a please donate $5.00 to me member. A real membership.
So. All that's out there for the time being is near great quality BR rips and that is that.
xiIix had it right. Perfect is rare, very rare. If you had to shell out bucks for the rare software that ""can"" actually give you perfect 1080p on a regular basis than you would think ""Hmmm f@#k them. Let them get there own software"".
It doesn't truly exist
Chances are you have never realy DL one.
Your complaints are hollow and under-educated.
DL this one or another one and move on children.
Oh...and please don't forget to seed like good boys and girls."

,pair8,2009-12-28T16:51Z,anyone noticed any stuttering/slo mo 3/4 in the movie (tv news announcement)?
,raptorms,2010-02-09T18:39Z,"if you have trouble with freezing just use media player classic google it and or install cccp codec
again on google and watch it on windows media player. vlc has a lagging problem with 1080p movies"
,MitsEvX,2010-04-29T20:07Z,"Excellent quality, but yeah I noticed that stuttering to at 3/4 of the movie! ;-) (Not a big problem! :D )"
