,blablo,2009-09-10T23:05Z,"tx, working 100% fine. Just install, didn't ask for any serialkey or whatever. Run the update and it installed them all without any complains.

Have tried alot of other without getting it to work but this looks totaly ok."
,nari4peace,2009-09-14T10:24Z,"Hey Kasubhat,
  You do not have to abuse someone with expletives like ' Bevarsi ', ' Rande Maga ', ' Kandrekutti '.  You should check your own facts before you run your dirty mouth.  If you don't like something, just leave.  Don't bad mouth.
