Something is amiss on the continent of Faydwer. Whispers of war have spread like wild fire among the Dwarves, Elves and Gnomes. What could be driving these peaceful races to the brink of destruction? Will hundreds of years of 
harmony and peace be crushed forever? In the third chapter of EverQuest for the Pocket PC, War on FaydarTM, you must answer these questions and more. Visit Kaladim, the mine city of Dwarves; Kelethin, the city in the trees; Ak'Anon, the 
city of Gnomes, and Felwithe, the city of High Elves. Battle monsters in Butcherblock Mountains, Steamfont Mountains, the Faydark Forests, and Dagnor's Cauldron. The fate of Faydwer rests in your hands. Are you up to the challenge?
