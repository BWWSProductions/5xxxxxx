,wishyou,2009-09-22T10:17Z,"Yeah, whats with the 100 seeders with everyone stuck at 79%

Wish"
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-09-25T01:58Z,"OK ... normally I don't do re-seeds, but if people are having problems, I'll start seeding this again for a bit and see if I can figure out what the issue is ...

Maybe just too many slow-seeders."
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-09-25T02:03Z,"OK ... this is weird.  I'll seed this for the rest of the night and it should get over 50 of you to 100%.

Maybe the stats aren't showing up correctly or something ... I'm currently connected to almost 80 leechers and my torrent swarm stats show over 100 seeders, but nearly everyone in the swarm is at 79.1% ...

Weird.  Just be sure when you hit 100% to keep seeding for a few days ... please."
