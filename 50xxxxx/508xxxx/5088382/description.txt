IMDb Description.....: When teenager Sam Witwicky buys his first car, what he doesn't know, is that it's actually an alien robot. This isn't the only alien to arrive on Earth. Optimus Prime and a fellow group of transforming robots have arrived in search of the AllSpark. But, Optimus Prime and his Autobots aren't the only aliens to appear. Megatron and the Decepticons are also searching for the AllSpark, and it would do anything to get it, even if it means destroying the city.

Much like my Star Wars film encodes, I've already encoded this film using the 720p as the source ... but this time, I've used the new method of encoding which was originally developed by HolyRoses.  As such, like the new Star Wars film encodes I did, this is a physically smaller file, with a lower video bitrate, yet the quality is actually better.  How this is accomplished is highly technical in nature and would take me several paragraphs to explain ... ok, so I don't actually know how it works, but if you send a message to HolyRoses I'm sure he can send you several paragraphs of technobable on the subject.  So just be happy, download, and be sure to keep seeding so others can grab the file!  :D


So, since I've never even heard of this film, I couldn't find any trivia for it ... just kidding:
1.  Throughout the film, Bumblebee speaks through the usage of radio/television transmissions because his ability to speak has been damaged.  This is an omage to the original animated Transformers film in which the tranformers of the Junk planet spoke only through television quotes.
2.  In the original 'Transformers', Bumblebee's car form was a Volkswagon Beetle, however, the film producers thought this was too weak and not a strong enough car image for Sam's "protector".  Therefore, they went through many models of cars before finally settling on a Camaro.  Not-so-oddly-enough, Michael Bay's first car as an adolecent was a Camaro.  In a nod to the original though, when Bumblebee parks in the used car lot, he parks next to a Volkswagon Beetle and in fact damages it when the salesman overprices 'him.'
3.  Bumblebee has an air freshener hanging from his rear-view mirror with a Bee on it that says; "Bee Otch" and the emblem on his steering wheel is the Autobot emblem.
4.  While in real life the F-22 is the evolution and replacement for the F-15, Starscream appeared as a F-15 in the original 'Transformers' and in the film he now transforms into a F-22.
5.  The Transformers official slogan, "More than meets the eye," is heard twice in the film: firstly when Sam is talking to Mikaela inside Bumblebee; and secondly when Optimus Prime makes his transmission at the end of the film.
6.  In his police car mode, Barricade's front side holds the Decepticon symbol, and reads "Pacis Quod Alcedonia" (Latin for "Still, Halcyon days of Peace") and "Incorporated since June 1865." His back side reads "To punish and enslave," a twisted version of the classic police slogan "To protect and serve."
7.  Steven Spielberg, an executive producer on the film, suggested to the writers the central storyline of "a boy and his car," and read each of their drafts and gave notes on improving the story. Spielberg also encouraged Michael Bay to film most of the stunts live, and keep the use of CGI to a strict minimum.  After his suggestions, Michael Bay spent most of the film's $150 million budget on 15 practical action sequences, making sure the VFX aspects of the film did not overwhelm the live-action elements.
8.  During filming, Mark Ryan acted as a stand-in for the Transformers on set, to give the actors a physical presence to react to/act against. He also ad-libbed characters during the film's post-production. He was eventually taken on board to voice the Autobot Bumblebee when he finally speaks at the end of the film to voice his opinion about remaining on Earth.
9.  Optimus Prime speaks his trademark motto ("Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.") for the first time ever; it was not heard in 'Transformers' but was mentioned in the packaging for his original action figure back in the 1980s.
10.  According to the graphic novel "Transformers: Prequel," the destruction of the Beagle 2 Mars rover (as seen in the film and a trailer) was carried out by Starscream.  Although most fans assumed from the shape and demeanor of Decepticon in the trailer, it was Barricade or Blackout.  Also, since Barricade and Blackout both appear early in the film, while Starscream does not appear until later in the film.
