[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-09-11T19:45Z,"Now we know it,

here they are, the long awaited Beatles-remasterings.

The Album ""Yellow Submarine Song Track"" already intrigued us in 1999, isn't it???
What a disappointment for those expecting sonic enhancements in such manner, at least for the new stereo versions.
I've only listened to ""Revolver"", ""Pepper"" and ""Abbey Road"" but what i heard made me angry:

Here some random noise reduction at free spaces, there one iota more trebble and one mircron more basic tone (BTW only distinguishable in an A-B comparison) - thats all? Four years of production time wasted for what?
Oh well - it is louder now - fantastic!!
Not even to some extent they made efforts in correcting some wimpy stereo effects (e.g.: ""Eleanor Rigby"").
Indeed, as well as  n o t h i n g  had been done and i'm glad not having ordered any Album of this new shit.

Personally i'm not willing to pay 180? for somewhat that everybody can correct with some 2%-tweaking on his Amplifier."
[V],bubanee,2009-09-11T23:48Z,"^ you got to remember something these are recordings from the 60s odd the best they can do with it.. unless the beatles made vocals seperate on a different track they could get anyone in to replay the music..
but most of there songs sound like straight out lets get in and play stuff..

@JoiresWay-II
it won't let me up with a .txt in music so i had to go with other.
i know it rattles me too!
cheers

and people i can't buy the box set in AUS it's sold out and gone until mid oct.. so if i do up anymore from now til then.. it will be seperate ones that have been split from the collection
i'm not going to do transcoded on someone elses work or borrow and edit words like i did too 41 greatest hits [no transcodin]
i'm shattered for myself and for you.
'cause i was really looking forwarded to this collection!
cheers..."
,JoiresWay-II,2009-09-12T00:04Z,"yeah bubanee, the demand especially is increasing day by day everywhere. Going outta stock. It would be really nice to see an individual upload from you... The greatest hits from you was amazing... 

And i think you may use the Edit Torrent button and change the type from other to music, try it man...."
[V],bubanee,2009-09-12T01:33Z,"^ Cheers
others to music!"
,JoiresWay-II,2009-09-12T02:18Z,i think your previous uploads also needs to change from others. It may top the list on music. especially the greatest hits of the Beatles one.
[V],bubanee,2009-09-12T15:09Z,"i was wondering about that torrent today actually..
mmm now i know why...  on to it!
cheers"
,JoiresWay-II,2009-09-13T14:33Z,now it looks full and great...
,Billycan,2009-09-13T22:49Z,"It seems pretty pointless to me to get the new remaster with what one would hope was superior fidelity over the original only to compress it down to mp3 format thereby rending any possible upgrade, moot.  I'm sure everyone would appreciate an uncompromised FLAC version of this album which those that need it could then downconvert to crappy mp3. "
[V],bubanee,2009-09-14T01:42Z,"billy people make up there own minds what to download and in what format.. you want flac go get flac. at moment there is more than enough uploads to suite everyone's need.. really your post is pointless..
cheers...
and on a serious note any MP3 which is 90 percent plus compared to the original 100 wav is just as a good as flac... why do you think more people lean towards MP3...
to save disc space!"
,Billycan,2009-09-14T02:05Z,"Any mp3, no matter what the compression ration is compromised and therefore NOT as good as an equivalent FLAC. It is however, a satisfactory format for personal music players with their nasty little earbuds because the player isn't capable of high fidelity, and it does as you say, save disk space. "
,Billycan,2009-09-14T02:10Z,"If the CD were available in FLAC, I would download it in that format. If you had uploaded the CD in FLAC format, ppl could then process the music into its original format or downconvert to mp3 at any ratio they pleased without risking further degradation of the music."
,Billycan,2009-09-14T02:11Z,"Please understand it was not my intention to have a go at you. I was simply pointing out the advantages of uploading in a lossless format without resorting to an excessive upload size. 

Perhaps you could consider this, should you choose to upload anything in the future. In any event, thanks for your uploads of past and present."
[V],bubanee,2009-09-14T02:53Z,"billy no pun taken.. your point is a good one.
all i was saying is there is plenty of beatles on here..
maybe download the flac elsewhere, grab the rest from here! just a thought
cheers"
