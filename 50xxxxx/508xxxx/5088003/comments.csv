I probably can, but just be warned I haven't been able to figure out how to encode in this 853x style with subtitles yet.

It's possible I might be able to MUX the subtitles in and they might be usable by turning on subtitles on the iPod, but then I'm not sure if they'll be usable on other devices.  Though you could always watch with Subs on a PC if they are muxed vs. hardcoded.

I've got some other files I can try first and see how it goes while I download the 720p of The Last Samurai.  As it is though, I can probably just do a standard 640x encode w/hardcoded subs to fill the request."
,romeox145,2009-09-15T06:53Z,Thank you so much.  Thats fine.  and congrats on the new baby.
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-09-15T07:57Z,"New baby?  Dear God NO!!!  LOL.  I just got married recently ... I'm not even sure I want kids.

Anyways ...

I found a way to hardcode subs into a video from an MKV into an MPG file which is fairly quickly done ... less than 3 hours at least.  Right now I'm trying the 853x encoding method using the MPG as a source and I'll see how the final file turns out ...

Since I'm still downloading the 720p Last Samurai, I used another film to try this method out.  If it works, you'll probably see ""Defiance"" uploaded very soon.

If it works, I'll probably be encoding several subtitled films that have been sitting in my ""hard work"" folder on my HDD for several months now.  The last time I tried to hardcode subs and then do the 853x method, I used another route and it didn't work, so hopefully this does work.

If this method doesn't work though, I'll definitely encode it in a standard 640x version for ya with the English subtitles hardcoded for all the Japanese-language scenes."
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-09-15T18:02Z,I've got three dogs ... does that add up to one baby?!  Can that substitute for the procreation clause in my life contract?!
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-09-15T18:03Z,"Oh ... and my ""test"" encode with hardcoded subs ... worked fine.  Expect an upload of ""Defiance"" soon to be followed by ""The Last Samurai"" ... if it ever speeds up on the download ... slow ass torrent ... grrrr"
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-09-16T07:12Z,"OK ...  ""The Last Samurai"" is done, converted and tagged and ready for upload.  It's next in the queue.  Once ""Defiance"" is done uploading, I'll start it up.

Enjoy romeox145 ..."
