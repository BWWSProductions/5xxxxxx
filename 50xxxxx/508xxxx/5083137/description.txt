-EDIT-

It turns out this is 160kpbs transcoded into 320kpbs mp3. Sorry about that - I am working on a legit 320kbps version which I am transcoding from FLAC at the moment. Expect it up some time today.

I will no longer be seeding this when I start to seed the high quality version.

I did not make this, I am just uploading it because all the other "The Resistance" torrents have no seeds.

This is real - I am listening to it now. It was leaked earlier today

Enjoy - and remember, Muse is a great band so go and buy the album when it comes out.

When I get my hands on a CD I will also make a FLAC version.

The Resistance is the first Muse album since the critically acclaimed, triple platinum selling Black Holes and Revelations that spawned five top 20 singles, was nominated for a plethora of awards, including the prestigious Mercury Music Prize, and concluded with two sold out nights at the newly opened Wembley Stadium. It was recorded in Northern Italy, produced by the band themselves and mixed by Mark â€˜Spikeâ€™ Stent. In terms of sound and sonic vision The Resistance is their most ambitious long-player yet, which is clearly saying something. They have blown up the robo-funk/monster riff/stadium space rock sound of Black Holes... and widened their viewfinder even further to take in an even greater horizon of sound.
