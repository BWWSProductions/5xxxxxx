  From Recorded Books:

  A journalistic masterpiece. John Hersey transports us back to the streets of Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945â€”the day the city was destroyed by the first atomic bomb. Told through the memories of six survivors, Hiroshima is a timeless, powerful classic that will awaken your heart and your compassion. In this new edition, Hersey returns to Hiroshima to find the survivorsâ€”and to tell their fates in an eloquent and moving final chapter.
