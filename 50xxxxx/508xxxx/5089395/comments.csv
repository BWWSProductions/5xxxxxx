,dianada,2009-10-10T05:04Z,"Great download! However, I got a letter from my ISP re: downloading copyrighted property - not to say anything is wrong with this download, but be careful because your ISP is probably looking out for downloaders of True Blood!"
,SuiChiDae,2009-10-11T04:51Z,"@dianada: Thanks for the tip. I wish I knew a way to make these harder to find for the ISP, but easy to find for the users. Ah well, be careful everyone!"

Do you guys use PeerGuardian?  Seems to work for me.

Also, do regular spyware scans in case your ISP (or someone else) uploaded something to your computer."
