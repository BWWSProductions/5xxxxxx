This an update that enables PhysX in the game.

Hardware accelerated PhysX is a nVidia only feature. If you have an ATI card, this DL is not of any use to you."
[T],Beebe85,2009-09-15T18:56Z,"This works for me, PhysX now on options menu"
,johnl12,2009-09-17T15:26Z,"You will need the ""RELOADED"" download. "
,chris17585,2009-09-18T07:14Z,also i found that physics creates significantly less lag when using the update 2 crack over reloaded's my freind's fps went from 68 avg to 92 avg on the benchmark
,Gyrolin,2009-10-20T07:30Z,"You named the torrent file content? Wtf =(

I suppose I don't have the right to complain, thanks for the up!"
,godzook1,2009-12-06T23:09Z,"I'm very confused with all the solutions that everyone is posting, should i still copy the crack that came with the RELOADED version even if i'm using this one? What patches/updates do i need? I've seen 3 or 4 different ways to get this to work, someone please clarify."
,chengda85,2010-01-15T20:13Z,"help, I'm using the reloaded version and when I installed this the game wont start up any more giving a general protection fault."

It will only works for 20% of who have the game ""BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM"".....This is a collection of comments/complates over net  



 1.  Extract Batman.Arkham.Asylum.FullRip-KaOs

 2.  Install Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs (I think it not necessary)

 3.  You need .Net Frame Work1 Service Pack 1 (I think it not necessary)

 4.  You need .Net Frame Work2 Service Pack 1

 5.  You need .Net Frame Work3 Service Pack 1 

 6.  You need .Net Frame Work3.5 Service Pack 1

 7.  Update your directx

 8.  Move ""My Documents"" from C:\Dcuments and settings\.... to D:\Documents.

 9.  Install Games for windows by ""gfwlivesetupmin.exe""

 10. Copy ""msvcr70.dll"" to C:\windows\system\ and make the file into hidden and read-only.Some times its virus.

 12. Update your video card driver (I think it not necessary)

 13. If you want to enable PhysX, Change the ""PhysXLevel=0"" to ""PhysXLevel=1"" in the 
     file E:\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\BmEngine.ini

 14. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT! (Even, I am not garantee about working)

 15. If you installed PowerDvD, its process may will affect the game (I think it not necessary)

 And enjoy you're game !
