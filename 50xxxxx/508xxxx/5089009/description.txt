  From Recorded Books:

  Ãntonia Shimerdas moves to the harsh Nebraska heartland with her impoverished Bohemian family when she is still a girl. For young Jim Burden, who lives with his grandparents on a homestead nearby, Ãntonia is an embodiment of the female pioneerâ€”self-sufficient, vigorous, and determined to withstand the daily challenges of maintaining home and family in a primitive countryside. When Jim grows up, his memories return to Ãntonia. In his effort to understand what she meant to him, he creates an enduring picture of the American frontier and of a woman of unusual spirit.
