,CEDR777,2011-05-05T11:59Z,i dont believe that this is a directors cut because this still didnt show captain's intestines when the ship was torpedoed...
,GrimmCro,2011-05-12T23:37Z,"A10, V10, as usual from Secret Myth. But unfortunately, this is not the Director's Cut.

Bay's DC version of the film is R rated, scenes from that version are not in this upload. If there is a chance of seeing that version in this format, that would be great."
