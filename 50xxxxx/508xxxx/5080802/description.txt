Zot! is a comic book created by Scott McCloud (Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art) in 1984 and published by Eclipse Comics until 1990 as a lighthearted alternative to the darker and more violent comics that predominated the industry during that period.  McCloud credited Astro Boy creator Osamu Tezuka as a major influence on the book, making it one of the first manga-inspired American comic books.  The series is particularly notable for its imagery which is reminiscent of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, its energetic visual design and its meta-fictional underpinning.

Zachary T. Paleozogt, popularly known as Zot, is a blond haired, blue eyed teenage hero from an alternate Earth who flies via rocket boots and fights villains with a ten-shooter laser gun and boundless optimism.  He lives in "the far-flung future of 1965," a utopian Earth of world peace, robot butlers, and flying cars. Jenny Weaver lives in an imperfect world of disappointment and broken promises - the Earth we live in. Stepping across the portals to each other's worlds, Zot and Jenny's lives will never be the same again.
