A being of pure energy from an alternate dimension, The Weird was a member of a race known as the Zarolatts.  For years, his people had been exploited as energy sources by a cruel race known as the Macrolatts.  When the Macrolatts sought to bridge the dimensional gap and attack other realms, The Weird knew he had to act. Escaping through a portal to another world, The Weird found himself on the planet Earth.

Seeking a corporeal form to contain his energy, he possessed the body of a dead man named Walter Langley. This produced a composite form which contained both The Weird's memories and traces of Langley's. In this shape, he sought out Earth's superheroes for aid and was dubbed "The Weird" by the Blue Beetle. 

The Weird next appearance would be in Mystery in Space v2 along with Captain Comet.
