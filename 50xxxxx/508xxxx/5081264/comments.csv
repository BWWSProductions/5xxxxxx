[V],nightissuchproximity,2009-09-30T11:00Z,"Hi, jasperjoy.   How you doin', bro?   When I first got this I expected it to be a great pile of crap.   Listened to it and was pleasantly surprised.
   Glad you like it.   Cheers.
Regards nightissuchproximity."
,D-RAWKCITY,2009-09-30T15:47Z,i couldnt be convinced in a million years to download this.  keep your eyes open for the new chuck norris gospel record!
[V],nightissuchproximity,2009-09-30T16:23Z,"Download it.   It really is not bad.   Trust me...I've heard far worse.   And that Chuck Norris 10CD gospel collection is brilliant.   I play it all the time when I'm down on my knees.   Not in prayer...just drunk. 
   Sacrifice some bandwidth and down this.  It grows on you...
...but there again so do boils..."
