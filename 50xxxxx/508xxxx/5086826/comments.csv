,gonzalo76,2009-09-13T21:46Z,"Codec: flac, 1411-1536 kbps (for true quality go buy the cdÂ´s)

What does it mean ?

- Audio CD is always in 1411 kbps (not 1536)

- FLAC or any other lossless codec is always true audio quality. "
,AuDioXxxx,2009-09-13T23:30Z,"False,

any rip from a original cd (the bitrate of a casual cd is 44.100) to digital input (like a pc) is compressed, of wich 1536 kbps is the max"
,AuDioXxxx,2009-09-13T23:46Z,"alright i explained it a bit wrong. 
lets just say when cd's are played analoge, like in a cd player the quality is always higher then digital.
Because when you go from analoge to digital there's compression 

so by ""true quality"" i mean analoge cd's not ripped ones



"
,gonzalo76,2009-09-14T03:48Z,"I don't understand your explanation, seems you're a bit confused about it... nevermind. If it is in lossless format (CDDA > WAV > FLAC), that's enough for me. 

But, I wonder why you didn't include the EAC log and cuesheet (noncompliant).

Anyway, many thanks for this great torrent.

,AuDioXxxx,2009-09-14T08:16Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter  everything's explained here.

and there is no cue because, if you want this on cd u should buy the cd.
"
,gonzalo76,2009-09-14T15:32Z,"""if you want this on cd u should buy the cd""

This is the most stupid answer I've ever heard.

And by the way, I have the complete discography of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler on silverCD.

I suggest you to learn who to rip and share CDs properly.

And in the future, when somebody ask you something, avoid stupid answers like ""if you want this on cd u should buy the cd"", because nobody forces you to share 'your cds'.

,AuDioXxxx,2009-09-14T18:48Z,"If you want your artist on cd u should buy it so the author get full credit and u full quality, thats my statement

and by not adding any cue's i hope to encourage people to do this.

and if you think this is total rubbish, your problem

your comments just show that you have a totally different idea of ""what the purpose is of flac"" than me (certainly when u say that it's highest quality) so guess this is apointless discussion

,lonesomebit,2009-09-15T12:30Z,"Hmm....

beside your discussion about cue or not....

If it is on CD it is DIGITAL ( that means 0s and 1s )
there is no such thing like ANALOGUE CD, thats plain BS.

Since a Laserbeam can only distinguish between true ( 1 ) or false ( 0 ) it is incapable to READ Waves ( ANALOGUE ).

,hitec45,2009-09-16T19:48Z,"@AuDioXxxx 
there is NO 44.100 in bit rate you got really wrong thats the Hz and it's the input frequency.
and lonesomebit is right the CD is always digital... and the bits? well what i know one bit is a 1 or a tone in musik (i guess) so if it's 1411Kbps (=1411000 bits / second) it can handle the more bits the better sound a dvd can handle more bits and have higher input frequency guess around 48.000Hz (DD5.1 or DTS ) depends on the extra material on the dvd the more compressed is would be and the lower input frequency it will have."
,gonzalo76,2009-09-17T07:55Z,"Yep, I told him he was confused... but who can maintain a decent conversation with somebody that replies things like: "" if you want this on cd u should buy the cd."" 

Who can talk with a guy who thinks that people will buy all these CDs because he didn't provide a cuesheet, rip log, artwork, info, md5, etc, etc, etc.

You need psychological help my friend :D"

,jamesisin,2010-02-21T18:44Z,"Why would you convert you mp3's into FLAC files?

Why not just head back over to the kiddie pool with your mp3's and leave the FLAC files to the adults?

Fascist file sharing.  What a concept."
,YankeeDoodleDandy,2010-07-03T13:25Z,"I've tested the files myself, with the same results as digger87.

Although audiochecker sometimes gives a false positive, the lack of knowledge portrayed by the author of this torrent leads me to believe this is another lame transcoding from a lossy format!

Some explanation about sampling frequency and bitrate:

44100 is the sampling frequency used on audio cd's, it is not the same as bitrate.
Divide it by half and you get the maximum frequency that can be reproduced without distortion (about 22 kHz). The human ear can pick up sounds up to about 20 kHz.

bitrate:
16 bits per sample:
16 bits x 44100 kHz x 2 Channels = 1,4112 Mbits

This tells us how much data is decompressed and / or decoded per second.

Thus smaller files means lower bitrate, but not necessarily loss of information.

The reason flac files are so big is that you can only compress it so much using lossless compression.

MP3's remove information in order to make the files so small.

If you decompress a FLAC file the resulting .wav file will be as big as the source file and will be a bit-perfect copy of the source file!
If the source is an audio cd the FLAC file sound quality will be equal to the CD!
NO LOSS OF INFORMATION!

If You decompress a MP3 file the resulting .wav file will be as big as the source file, but will be different = LOSS of information.

FLAC RULES!"
