Massive Attack - Splitting the Atom EP [2009] (320 Kbps) [Dodecahedron]

Massive Attack are a British music duo from Bristol, UK, considered to be progenitors of the genre known as trip hop, as well as effectively being a wider collective including other musicians that they assemble. 

On August 25th their new EP, "Splitting the Atom", was announced. The other new tracks off of the EP were revealed to be, Tunde Adebimpe's "Pray For Rain", Martina Topley-Bird's "Psyche" and Guy Garvey's "Bulletproof Love". The latter two tracks appear as remixes of the intended album versions and none of "LP5"'s tracks are expected to resemble the versions that were played on tour, with some songs, such as "Dobro", dropped altogether.
