Synopsis.

Homicide | USA | 1991 | Directed by David Mamet
                                  
In David Mametâ€™s cinema, nothing is as it seemsâ€”so you better know what youâ€™re looking for. Unfortunately, the protagonist of Mametâ€™s nightmarish urban odyssey Homicide, inner-city police detective Bobby Gold (Joe Mantegna), is as bewildered about who he is as who (or what) heâ€™s after. Goldâ€™s investigation, following the murder of an elderly Jewish candy-shop owner, leads him down a path of obscure encounters and clues, to a profound reckoning with his own identity. Filled with Mametâ€™s trademark verbal play and featuring standout supporting performances from William H. Macy, Ving Rhames, and Rebecca Pidgeon, Homicide is a taut, rich work from a true American original. Audio commentary featuring writer-director David Mamet and actor William H. Macy.
