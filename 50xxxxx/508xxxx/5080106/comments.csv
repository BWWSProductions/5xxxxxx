,Ozz447,2012-04-20T07:56Z,"I created an account here at TPB just so I could alert people about this torrent - DO NOT DOWNLOAD. I have been through the first 8 episodes so far and every single episode has some sort of interruption in it. Example being you are watching an episode and all of a sudden there is a 2 minute section that shows a clip of ""Dexter"" or another one showed a 2 minute clip in the middle of a frigging episode of ""The Big Bang Theory."" DO NOT waste your time with this crap torrent. I have been using TPB for going on hell maybe 4-6 years and this is the first review I have ever left because it pissed me off so bad. Heed my warning or else enjoy your crap interrupted episodes and all the time you wasted waiting for it to DL. They reminded me of when Brad Pitt cut in frames of porn in children's films in Fight Club. A-HOLE!"
,Hancock79,2012-05-01T18:09Z,lol @ angry Fight Club comparison
,altonina,2012-06-20T08:21Z,TU very much; your efforts are appreciated!!! I loved the minisodes too!
