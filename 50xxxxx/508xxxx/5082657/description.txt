With low popularity and a dwindling economy, Barack Obama (real name Barry Soetoro) holds a speech to America's students in a means to bolster his cabinets support with citizens of the future.

In the run up to the planned talk, much criticism was given over the socialist direction of the event. Americans questioned the expectations of students to write letters to Obama and the motives of why he would center attention on young children. Many parents refused to allow their children to attend school on the day. Some likened the speech to Nazi Germany, but for the New World Order agenda.

This is the speech given.
