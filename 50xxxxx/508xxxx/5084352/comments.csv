thanks for all the Dad's Army downloads. Very much appreciated. There are a number of the discs that are stuck. Can u do anything about it? Disc 10,12,13,14, & 15. Any help would be appreciated "
,wolfy100,2009-09-15T11:57Z,What do you mean stuck??
,milligan283,2009-09-15T15:47Z,"yes can't get past 73.1% with disc 10, 90.1% with disc 12, 86.5% with disc13, 95.9% with disc14. I've only just noticed Disc 15 so that hasn't started yet and shows no sign of starting. Thanks for your speedy reply."
,wolfy100,2009-09-15T16:33Z,"You can request a re-seed from the PB, I think you need to go to the forum?? If not get back to me and I will try to do it from my end, but not sure how to though"
,milligan283,2009-09-15T23:43Z,Sorry Wolfy no idea how to do any of that. Can't think i'm the only one not finished downloading. I have 7 to 24 still available seeding.
,wolfy100,2009-09-16T09:05Z,just scroll down to the bottom of this page and click on forum
,milligan283,2009-09-21T13:30Z,"Hi Wolfy

I've asked on forum but still no action on the Dad's army stuff I mentioned. Seems a few of us are stuck without being able to finish. Any chance of seeding?

Thanks Milligan283"

,milligan283,2009-09-27T01:26Z,Thanks Wolfy only 15 to complete now. I await the last 3 discs. Fantastic job.
