if you use PG or PB make sure all lists are current, if you dont use anything - good luck with that, LoL..

Before some shithead replies about  what  a piece of crap PG is let me reply, Would you choose not to use a condom because they have been known to fail occassionally? in other words, using it would be better than not using anything PG does what its designed to do, make sure its on and updated and you will have a better chance and not getting bent over and plowed...LoL"
