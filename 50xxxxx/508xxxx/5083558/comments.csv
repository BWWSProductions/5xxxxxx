[T],swebarb,2009-09-10T00:48Z,bah shit requires 5.50 and 5.00 m33 doesnt work
,erlend,2009-09-10T11:47Z,"correction, requires 5.55 (at least).. doesn`t work on 5.50GEN-B FULL either"
,dvarl,2009-10-22T20:28Z,5.50 Gen-D is now out and can run any game needing 5.51 - 6.00 ofw without decrypting and patching them. If you run M33 cfw then there are game decryptors that will patch the games to play without updating.
,TwistedWoods,2009-12-23T00:52Z,"If problems with gen, try switching the ""umd iso mode"" to ""m33 driver"" in the vsh"

,wujlele,2011-04-03T22:34Z,how big is it after unrar?
,ust2,2011-09-19T21:11Z," It's 830mb unpacked.

 Which kind of sucks, cause I only dled it since I thought it could be another small game just to stick on there when there is some extra room.

 Not a whole lot you can fit on a 2gb card lol, and i'm definetly not going to fill up about half of it for this shitty game."
