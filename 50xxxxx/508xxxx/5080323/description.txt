Very interesting documentary on Vlad the Impaler hosted and narrated by non other than the legendary Vincent Price.

There is lots of great dialogue and re-enactments of the war between Vlad and the Turks.

My favorite part is where Mr Price is making fun of Count Chocula and The Count from Sesame Street as only Vincent can. 





Enjoy and Seed!!
