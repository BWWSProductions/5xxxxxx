Ella Es el Matador (She Is the Matador)
Premiere Date: September 1, 2009

For Spaniards â€” and for the world â€” nothing has expressed their country's traditionally rigid gender roles more powerfully than the image of the male matador. So sacred was the bullfighter's masculinity to Spanish identity that a 1908 law barred women from the sport. Ella Es el Matador reveals the surprising history of the women who made such a law necessary and offers fascinating profiles of two female matadors currently in the arena: the acclaimed Mari Paz Vega and neophyte Eva Florencia. These women are gender pioneers by necessity. But what emerges as their truest motivation is their sheer passion â€” for bullfighting and the pursuit of a dream. A co-presentation with Latino Public Broadcasting (LPB).
