,Scazza,2009-11-06T17:55Z,"Further, in downloading DIVX7 for mac you still need an additional audio decoder.  Downloading 2 programs and I still can't find how to turn on subtitles.  A simple .srt file would have been easy.  Be advised that at least for mac users, this file is unfortunately a real hassle."

Subs weren't a problem for me at all, but I have a PC, not a mac.
Thanks for another great upload, omifast."
