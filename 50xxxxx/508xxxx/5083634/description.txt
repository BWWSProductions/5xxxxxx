Entre Les Murs [The Class] 2008 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068646/

Plot: Based on an autobiographical novel by Francois Begaudeau, a drama that follows the year in the life of a French schoolteacher working at a high-school in a tough neighborhood of Paris. Ethnicities, cultures and attitudes often clash in the classroom. As amusing and inspiring as the teenage students can be, their difficult behavior can still jeopardize any teacher's enthusiasm for the low-paying job. Francois insists on an atmosphere of respect and diligence. Neither stuffy nor severe, his extravagant frankness often takes the students by surprise. But his classroom ethics are put to the test when his students begin to challenge his methods.

FranÃ§ois BÃ©gaudeau, Nassim Amrabt, Laura Baquela, Juliette Demaille, Cherif BounaÃ¯dja Rachedi
