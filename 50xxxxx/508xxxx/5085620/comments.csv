,ctoveloz,2009-09-11T18:30Z,if its an american console it will definitely be NTSC-U. NTSC-J is asia and japan.

Its more like Forza than any NFS game I've played, the car's don't handle that great but its still fun to play. Much better than NFS Pro Street!"

VERY IMPORTANT... run this bad boy through abgx360 before burning the iso. the stealth did not pass the first time..  abgx will patch and fix this so you don't get kicked off xbox live. 

And seed dammit..."
