Only these albums were mastered as MONO editions by EMI/APPLE in addition to the stereo releases (differs from Stereo Box-Set), these are unique mono-masters by the studio not downsampled versions from stereo

Are you CERTAIN your drive has no audio cache? If not then your rips are not accurate and should be redone. 

Always leave the option to YES, even if it doesn't. This won't make others question your rip :)"
