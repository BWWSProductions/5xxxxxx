It follows Nick Morgan, a struggling musician whose friend Jake Sheridan recommends the perfect manager by the name of Damien Brooks. Damien immediately secures Nick a slot on the Facemelter Festival â€“ the biggest musical festival in the world. After the show, Nick is launched into the global spotlight; and it's only a matter of time before the bad side of fame entices him.
