These absolutely are the newly-remastered versions; the most noticeable difference is in the early records, which are now in true stereo.  But even the later records benefit significantly from the remastering: the high and low ends have much better definition and the balance is much better across the entire spectrum.

Listen to the 20-year-old digital masters side-by-side with these as I have; you'll notice they sound dull and muffled by comparison.  Some people have complained about the loss of dynamic range in the remasters, but I honestly don't notice any detriment.

Now, just waiting until Amazon delivers my CDs..."
