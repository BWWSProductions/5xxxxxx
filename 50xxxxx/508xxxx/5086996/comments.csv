Hope you keep em comming.  No longer available on TV in the US, sinc ABC's dumbasses decided to cancel the show.  And for what? to play some reruns in its timeslot.... stupid."
,scooterbaga,2009-09-14T11:04Z,They fucking canceled it?  ABC has been canceling some really great shows the past few years.  They have some profoundly stupid people there apparently...
