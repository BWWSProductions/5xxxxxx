MP3Resizer. Simply the best MP3-resizing solution.
MP3Resizer is designed to optimize the capacity of your portable music player by reducing the size of MP3 files.
This is especially useful when listening to MP3 files or MP3 Audio books on a mobile phone, MP3 player, Pocket PC, etc.

Portable MP3 players don't usually have much memory, and of course, it's a shame to waste precious megabytes.
It's hard to refuse temptation to upload more music than possible.

For example, a 5-minute 256kbit MP3 file will occupy approximately 9.15Mb. By recompressing this file to 80kbit, the file size is dramatically reduced to 2.86Mb.

The output file size is more than three times smaller than the source file size!
Using MP3
Resizer, you can upload three times more music to your MP3 player than before.

Please note, the reduction in size is achieved by recompressing the file with a lower bit rate. This may cause a slight degradation in audio quality.
This application uses Lame, a high quality MP3 codec. A minimum bitrate of 64kbps is recommended for music playback on a mobile phone's MP3 player. The best and most commonly used MP3 formats for Audio Books are as follows: Mono, 8/16/24 kbps.

MP3Resizer is designed to work with Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista.
