Worst of Opie and Anthony presents the Best of WWE
XM/Sirius commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3
Rip+Edit mg56

Hosted by Primetime Sam Roberts, E-Rock and Matt
Striker. Featuring appearances by Mick Foley,
Vince McMahon. Shane McMahon, Triple H, John Cena,
Chris Jericho (vs Jim Norton), JBL, Taz, Al Snow,
Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Iron Shiek. Also
featuring Jim Norton, Rich Vos and Bob Saget &
more.

 

Note: I'm doing some infrastructure upgrades in 
the next few weeks which should lead to earlier 
ups. That's the good news. The bad news is I'm planning 
on "retiring" from posting O&A (it's simply a logistics
thing) in December of this year. No point in upping
when someone else could be doing it faster. That's 3 
months to find a reliable O&A upper to serve the pests.
