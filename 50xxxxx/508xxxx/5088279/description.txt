friends, i am living in Germany and bought this C.D in Berlin at music store, as it was on sale I had heard one song before and liked the song. road to sadness, anyway I am glad that i bought this c.d. After listening a few times this is one of my favorite music of all times. you will be blown away by the songs on this album from Canada. So then I was interested in the man and what he was all about and watched his crazy movie things. I am a big fan now!!!! I am also a fan of District 9, great movie. PLEASE ENJOY "AMERICAN JUSTICE", AND SEED
