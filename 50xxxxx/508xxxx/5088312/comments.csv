,darkkaleo,2009-10-24T20:13Z,"I didn't rip any movies out, every cut-scene is included and works fine. You're the first one on here and Demonoid who's had that issue. Re-extract and try again, you've made an error."
,Citats,2009-10-30T02:58Z,"@darkkaleo
Could you post the method of installing?

I haven't downloaded yet because I'm on limited internet and need to know before I download over 5 gigs worth. :P

Is it a disc image that needs to be mounted? Or does it install using a batch (.bat) file or some other method?

Thanks in advance "
,darkkaleo,2009-11-15T16:39Z,"@Citats
Read the description...
""All you have to do to do to play is extract to the destination of your choosing using WinRar.""
There is no installation, just extracting as is with all my precracked and ready to play torrents."
,zacharyyy,2009-11-20T01:50Z,"So, While it's downloading, I'd like to ask, Can you play online with this crack or Single Player only?"
,darkkaleo,2009-11-27T21:31Z,"@zacharyyy
As you should know, no pirated game is able to play online with today's protections. You can create a VLAN with Hamachi or similar program but getting on official servers is not going to happen."

,Shadow972,2009-12-08T21:19Z,dude if you get that you have to run it in compatability mode for a previous windows version although the game SHOULD work with windows 7 it says so on EA's website
,Shadow972,2009-12-08T21:22Z,oh and @darkkaleo just to be clear can i extract the files to a DVD 8.7 GB and it will run on multiple PC's?
,Daniel330,2009-12-13T07:08Z,"i loaded the game right and it starts up but after i start to play it for a few minutes it stops running 
any suggestions?"
,darkkaleo,2009-12-14T03:15Z,"@Anders and thurumbar
the key part of that error is ""dx9"". It is most likely a directx error. google the latest ((c redistributable) and install. if same errors, try compatibility mode. I have played this game in XP, Vista, and 7 in both 32-bit and 64-bit each without error.

@Shadow972
I no longer have the game on my computer but I believe the size after extraction is too big for a duel layer DVD (8.7 GB). but you are welcome to try. And yes as long as you have a disk for each computer or have copied the files to each computer, it will work without conflict issues.

@Daniel330
Try updating video drivers, directX, and make sure you meet requirements for the game."

,awlh,2010-11-22T05:34Z,"@badminto Thanks for help with the custom map problem. Could you explain the steps a bit more. So far I think what I'm supposed to do is create a registry entry under 
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts\Electronic Arts\Command and Conquer 3]
I had to create all those folders as there weren't any C&C entries. Then I created a new multi-string value and pasted this in it

put .reg in the end of the name ex. 'cnc.reg'. Then, launch 'cnc.reg'. It will create automatically. Again..browse to registry [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts\Electronic Arts\Command and Conquer 3]
and change the 'InstallPath' to your cnc3 location game if differ. Proceed with caution. If not work, please undo the change u have did before"

My cnc3 is installed as shown above and I am running windows 7 64bit. I also went into the registry and confirmed that the entries are there. Now I don't know where to put the new maps. I was told they should be in 
C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Roaming\Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars\Maps
I put them there but still no new maps in skirmish mode. Did  I miss something?"
,badminto,2010-11-23T04:46Z,"My post before only for 32bit system only.For 64bit system we need a little bit modification. Create another .reg file with this:

,darkkaleo,2011-01-23T22:59Z,"@thatonetimeguy
It seems you've never seen .rar files that weren't compressed by a monkey. When you unrar it will automatically go through all of them.

Unraring in parts makes the compression a lot better (usually) and I chose the number of parts so that they would easily fit over a couple CDs, DVDs, or what have you for easy sharing at LANs."
