Updated to v1.09

Another prepatched, precracked, and ready to play release from TheAlchemist and DarkKaleo. All you have to do to do to play is extract to the destination of your choosing using WinRar.

This easily fits on to a couple CDRs or even a flash drive big enough for the files which makes this perfect for LAN games or passing it off to friends.

This has been tested multiple times to work in both campaign and LAN play with no serial conflicts. It DOES work, so if you're getting an error you must have done something wrong. You're welcome to post on the site any questions you have for it.
