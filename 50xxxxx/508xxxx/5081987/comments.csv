,sdhdhgdgb,2009-09-14T07:30Z,"Thanx to divx team for this UL.  However, why is it cropped so bad.  Like it's zoomed in real far and stays there.  Was this necessary for this scr copy and if so why.  not meaning to sound ungrateful, just don't understand why.  Would someone please give link to original source."
,chair_tard,2009-09-22T00:15Z,"quality is good, but the original aspect ratio is 2.35:1, shot in anamorphic widescreen, not super 35, so this is 3:4, so as if both sides were cut off... but appreciated anyway"
