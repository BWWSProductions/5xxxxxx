thanks for the up AiTB"
,tribeboybena,2009-09-16T17:12Z,"possemaster is full of shit. my xbox's date are still 2006, and no way they can ban me for not updating the time on my console."
,Tony28haha,2009-09-16T17:30Z,Just wondering if this one is in English and if it is NTSC thank you.
,DethMonky,2009-09-16T23:26Z,"@Possemaster:  Stop lying.  A video game shop in France already sold about 100 copies of this game to legitimate buyers... those people will not be banned.  Playing before the drop date NEVER causes bans.

@Tony28haha:  This release is English and it is RegionFree.  However the disc it was created from is PAL, not NTSC-U.  Since it's region free, that doesn't really matter, but it's just a random bit of information to have."
,Tony28haha,2009-09-17T15:27Z,Thank you Dethmonky question though is there more of a chance to banned with it being created by pal if i play it here in canada on a ntsc or are the odds the same just wondering 
,Krazy_Ice,2009-09-17T18:20Z,"tribeboybena...

Sure thing, jump in and play, later u can come back here and tell us if anything happened. Im just curious. Go for it."

How do i do that? im using imgburner to burn, previously it worked fine.

Thanks for the help"
,ozke,2009-09-25T13:36Z,"To BrandonG1394:

Since its 2 dvds you simply just burn boths dvds as normal.

To Passonic:

In Imgburn, where it says write speed, if u look to the right you will see a little icon of a book. Click on that and choose your label, then in the drop down menu you choose ""DVD+DL"" media

Also, in the settings menu you might want to turn off the ""auto change booktype"" option, its under the write tab."

Theres alot of guides on the net, but heres what you do:

Install abgx 360 and get the settings right (check the web)

Download a game and run it through abgx

Get Imgburn and burn the game with it

If you want a more detailed guide you should search the net"

This is a Wave 3 game. You need to have iXtreme version 1.51 or 1.6 to be able to play this game. You can patch the game to make it play if you have a older firmware but you are likely to get banned if you do this. I would just upgrade your xbox. Also, don't use your 360 to power your drive when your flashing your console. Microsoft flag every console that does this in their NXE download. So becareful!"
