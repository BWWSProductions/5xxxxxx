AutoMapa is the first satellite navigation system to feature 3D building visualisation in Polish and European towns and cities, making it the world's leading car navigation utility. Owing to its coverage of a  comprehensive road network in Poland and the unique building address option, AutoMapa delivers unprecedented navigation precision on Polish and European roads.

Highly accurate city navigation maps, hundreds of thousands of precisely described Points of Interest (POI), a unique community of registered users of the Miplo.pl service and Krzysztof HoÅ‚owczyc's voice - those are the distinctive features of AutoMapa.

AutoMapa is a leader on the market of innovative solutions. It is the first Polish system that supports the collection of traffic data, and users will soon be able to avoid traffic jams with the program's help. AutoMapa has been guiding drivers since 2003, and it continues to be the most popular and the most frequently awarded GPs navigation program.


AutoMapa Europe is a detailed navigation map of whole Europe.

It includes full version of Polska XL map, extended by navigation data of  European countries provided by the Navteq company.

Searching for travel destinations and navigation all over Europe does not require switching between maps- they are combined into one homogenous product with advantages of the most detailed maps of Polska XL release and  maps of Europe of the Navteq company. Information on the degree of precision and the area covered in respective countries are presented on page 'Contents'.

Just like Polska XL map, AutoMapa Europe release also offers the option of choosing and installing both a selected part and the whole map. Thus the user depending on his/her needs may have at his/her disposal either a set of maps for navigation or, when needed (i.e. when the map is to be stored on a small memory card) only a selected area.

AutoMapa Europe on the territory of Poland offers all functionalities of AutoMapa Polska XL, including detailed address points, visualisations of building outlines, rich topographic contents and many others.

With its detailed navigation plans of over 2,600 cities and towns, complete road network, which covers over 637,000 km of Polish roads in all categories, almost 430,000 Points of Interest with detailed descriptions (located in particular in popular summer resorts),  you can easily and quickly find your favorite local haunt. Clubs, discos, restaurants or museums â€“ any tourist with AutoMapa will have no problem in finding the way to fun!

AutoMapa constitutes an actual and deliberate effort to improve the safety on the Polish roads. In cooperation with the Polish Railways, AutoMapa provides Polish drivers with a particularly accurate and current database of railway crossings in Poland. Over 15,000 such crossings have been specially marked to ensure that AutoMapa users will be aware of any potential danger. Data collected in cooperation with the General Headquarters of Police and Krzysztof HoÅ‚owczyc's foundation called â€œSafe Driverâ€ indicate and warn of 500 most dangerous road zones in Poland. The biggest database in Poland of fixed and mobile speed cameras, road check points and unmarked cars with cameras shows the spots where you cannot simply put the pedal to the metal and safely reach your destination.

â€œI refuse to leave without my smartphone with AutoMapa in my pocket. Even if I know the route, the navigation system remains very useful by indicating dangerous zones or updating the current distance to my destination. Obviously, I still have to think hard and concentrate on driving but in this way I can better control my progress. I have already tested the most recent version of AutoMapa and I must say that I'm very satisfied. I'm particularly impressed with the railway crossing warning system, which is truly indispensable to anyone traveling ,â€ said Krzysztof HoÅ‚owczyc, the best Polish rally driver.

Anyone planning to travel Europe in a car will particularly appreciate this version of AutoMapa, which comes with the latest maps (specification: Q2 2009) provided by NAVTEQ, the world's leader in European map drawing. With such new maps, drivers will manage to find their way to any of 44 European countries.
