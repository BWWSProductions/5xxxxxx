,Doowangle,2011-03-20T09:46Z,"The guy who made the 'bush lovers' comment was referring to matt stone and trey parker, as they often are center-left. The F.A.G. bit was obviously making fun of the way liberals overstate Americas faults, but this entire movie is satire about  Americas policy, hardly bush loving propaganda.  "

,dlarrym1111,2011-08-15T20:25Z,"@Knaster: You may never read this comment, However, Have you ever even seen this movie?? It's story/plot AGREES with you!!! It's not PRO AMERICA propaganda. It's a comedy that MAKES FUN of the US and our screwed up ways. To be more specific, this movie is a Satire of America's F___ed up foreign policy.

WORLD POLICE!!. FOR God's sake, a majority of Americans agree with this film as far as the US sticking its nose in every other countries business. Sadly, America WRONGLY DOES act like WORLD POLICE.

TOO many Americans (mainly the college aged citizens) WANT us to Change. The INSANE aspect of this is that these younger Americans don't do anything about it!! They don't vote, they look out for themselves, complain about all this kind of stuff and then sit on their ASS an do NOTHING about it.
They are too lazy to write their congress men, Stop playing their PLAY STATIONs and XBOX, Stop all the Drinking and partying and go out and get pro active, VOTE, and share with your peers and future children some real values and show them that freedom isn't free at ALL. It is totally ridiculous for these young Americans to sit and Blog and complaint about how messed up the US is in this area and a slew of other issues, but when the computer is shut off and the next day begins, They do nothing about it. It is really SAD.

We (the US) are sending our fleet of Air Craft Carriers (Practically Mobile Military Bases/cties), all over the planet to enforce our ways and beliefs upon everyone else weather they like it or not. Once we go in to ""HELP"" another country, we almost always end up leaving 1 or more permanent military bases in our wake and never leave.
To be fair, there are some countries that WANT us to intervene, and genuinely need assistance, but even more DON""T appreciate this ""HELP"".

Trust me, MANY MANY Americans agree with you. But this film ISN'T PRO-AMERICA PROPAGANDA!

enough said. Walk Well."
,Raggis,2011-08-18T15:54Z,Why can't the US just stick to their own business and more strongly support the UN that is a somewhat legitimate intervening force?
,bompidom,2011-08-26T18:12Z,"Great, thank you!"

,ukroadie,2011-09-10T03:46Z,"So then America, can you really not laugh at yourselves? Having read some of the comments that have been left, I guess you can't!!
Lighten up, this film is a comedy... & It's NOT true!!
You can tell that coz the ""Actors"" in this film have strings attached, SIMPLE.
Oh, & as for American Beer, I think you'll find it's bottled far to quickly after it has come outta the HORSE (Ha-Ha)!!
