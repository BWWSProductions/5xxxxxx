The second volume of Mystery in Space follows on from the Rann/Thanagar War, Infinite Crisis, and 52 maxi-series.  It features Captain Comet who has recently been reborn in a younger body.  As Comet tries to piece together his life again he comes under attack from the Church of Eternal Light who have used his old body to clone an army of monks.

The eight issue limited series is written by Jim Starlin and drawn by Shane Davis.  The first seven issues contain a backup story starring The Weird (from the eponymous 1988 miniseries), with art by Starlin.
