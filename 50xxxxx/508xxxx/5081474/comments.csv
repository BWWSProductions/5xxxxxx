I use Xilisoft and when i try to unrip it, it crossed size limit of 5 GB and also just gives a 2 Channel Audio.

I would like to play on my Home Theatre with 5.1 GB on a DVD 5 (4.7GB )"

,nickguyatt,2011-08-01T14:50Z,"Very good quality video and audio, excellent. My only problem was the subtitle track didn't seem to be synchronised properly, tried fiddling with the synch in VLC but it still didn't work. But hey that's probably just me goofing up and I didn't have to pay for this so np."
,.Leto.,2012-03-21T21:24Z,"I've never been a fan of SecretMyth rips, I almost always have to delete them because they're way too dark. But this one doesn't have that problem, it's really good.
Actually I just downloaded a 5GB BDRip on rutracker but the SecretMyth rip, even though it's much smaller, is better. Definition is much higher here. Good job :)"
