,gaijin01,2009-09-12T04:13Z,"Havent you ever wondered why so many people just do one line ""drive-by"" shots on rush comments, conservative forums and all over the web. Seriously how many people click on a torrent with no intention of downloading, just to try and score political points.

The only people who continously try and convince you of their own opinion, are more often than not, scared they are wrong."

Video: Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh politicize 9/11 while accusing Dems of the same

Unfortunately 9/11 has become just another tool of political attack over the years.  The politicization of 9/11 has reached fever pitch this year as we have a new Democratic president who has the gall to propose people use the day to complete acts of service. To conservatives like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh the 9/11 service day is an affront to what people should really be doing in remembrance of the national tragedy. So what should we all be doing according to these commentators.  Here is a list of ""acceptable"" and non-political activities to participate in according to the conservative media: (1)  Spend time attacking the Democratic presidential administrations (since that is what Beck and Limbaugh have done) (2)  Go to a local Tea Party event to protest the ""socialization"" of health care and government spending.  How non-partisan of them. (3) Support their own ""projects"" and list of principles which just happens to coincide with the release of their book in the case of Beck. (4)  Call on the President to resign for giving an address on health care reform. So the lesson is on a day in which the President did not dare to attack Republicans the conservative media is allowed to relentlessly attack Democrats while promoting their own agenda.

,booboo332,2009-09-12T21:27Z,And why does clear channel pay him?  Is it because of what he says or is it because people listen to him.
