Based on Machado de Assis' novel, this is a macabre story of a 19th century Brazilian priest and social reformer who puts most of the population of his village into a madhouse to "cure" them of insanity and sin, and make his utopia come true.  The land-owners (left without workers to till the land) volunteer to take their places in the "rest home"; when the priest refuses, he is subjugated and finally becomes the only inmate of the asylum.  "Some day", he muses, anticipating Laing, "the madness of our day will be the reason of tomorrow." The film's radical intention is clear and the decor, color, and mise en scene extravagantly beautiful, but the audacious parable ultimately becomes labored. Amos Vogel, Film as Subversive Art
