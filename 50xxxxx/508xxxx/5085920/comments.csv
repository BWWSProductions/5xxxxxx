yea    sorry mate most portables will only work on xp or vista 

win 7 is still in it's early stages and some portables won't work properly.....it is to do with the way win 7 's files and folders are structured 

sorry again I will edit this torrent so no one has the same trouble.....and thanx for the feedback "

I will let you know if I have any luck :)"
