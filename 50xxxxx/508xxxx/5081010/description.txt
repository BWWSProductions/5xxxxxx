Don't wait for seeders, download directly from Adobe !


I was bored so I decided to look into the possibilities offered by the Adobe Download Center and the awesome patch by Goldfish_92.

And there you go, this torrent is a small DVD that explain and help you download any CS4 application you'd like and fully activates it.

It's quite basic, but it's awesome !



There's a french and an english version. I tried to explain as best as I could the steps but if there's any question feel free to ask.
When you mount the image, a small .bat launches the english instructions. Then you just need to read and watch the pretty pictures.

Don't ask about the stupid .iso format, I was bored I said. Just use MagicISO to mount the image or burn it onto a disc so you can keep it... I don't know do whatever you like, but share it.
