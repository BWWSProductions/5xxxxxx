,hunnicuddler,2009-09-07T16:54Z,Many thanks for this btw.. :D
,fanpirate,2009-09-08T11:36Z,Tracks are in mono - not dual channel. The uploader is incorrect. I've noticed other recent torrents of his are also in mono!
,fanpirate,2009-09-08T11:37Z,"Sorry! My VLC player has them in mono. Hmm... that's weird. Plays in stereo on Realplayer.

My mistake. "

[V],oldskoolscouse,2009-09-08T16:21Z,"@fanpirate, all my torrents are what they say they are.

@IpodTouchGuy, There are 334 seeds on this torrent, TPB is not tracking them for some reason."
