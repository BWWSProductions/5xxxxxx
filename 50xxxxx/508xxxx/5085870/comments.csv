,LTD602,2009-10-10T23:15Z,"This is a rare treat, everyone. Blade Runner - The Final Cut, in full Blu-Ray, no bullshit.

I know it's a big file, but please seed. This is the best Blade Runner gets, so let's keep seeding as much as we can. 

Thanks go to spotted_jackal for this amazing upload!  Damn . . ."
,LTD602,2009-10-17T01:48Z,"@Jaffie:

Open the entire folder and play it with VLC player. Works on a Mac, I assume it'll work the same way in Windows. "
,LTD602,2009-10-17T18:31Z,"By the way . . .  this is the ONLY full 1080p rip of this movie on TPB. There is another ""1080p"" rip that is actually 800p, although the quality is gorgeous, I only have good things to say about that one. 

But *this one* is the real deal. "
,ODBC,2009-10-19T16:24Z,"A great classic and great quality.

Thank you very much to the uploader for sharing."
,0doktor1,2009-11-30T11:15Z,Great Stuff!!!
,groove420,2009-12-06T04:06Z,"This is the first time I'm attempting to download a blu ray format movie, fitting that it's this classic :)
I don't own a blu ray burner, and the directory structure looks unfamiliar to me.
I'd like to burn it to a single .iso for easy virtual disk mounting/playback, is this possible?
What's a good/easy program to do this, and could someone give a brief explanation on how to do it? and also what would be the best player for playback?, Thanks guys - seeding @110kB/s"

,0doktor1,2009-12-16T08:01Z,"Once again...

This is definitely one of the best torrents on TPB.
Thanks to the uploader!!!"
,marmcfly,2010-01-14T03:04Z,"just to confirm...if i wanted to burn this to a blu ray, would i need a double-layered BD disc because of the file size???  thanks all!!!  (but for that price, you might as well buy the movie, right??)"
,themouse2,2010-01-28T04:18Z,"So my system can't play this fluidly for some reason.


i 7, Sata Drives in Raid, etc

any ideas?"
,TrustNobody,2010-02-10T14:24Z,"Well, there is no subs on this one right?.. I right click on the ""BDMV"" and opens it with VLC player. Choosing subs is not an option, so i guess the uploader fooled me. No subs when playing with WD HD TV too."
,adamf154,2010-03-11T21:55Z,"FOR FUCK SAKE SEED AND CAN U PLEASE STOP CAPPING YOUR SPEEDS OR ITS GOING TO TAKE WEEKS TO GET THIS FINISHED BEEN DOWNLOADING FOR 48 HOURS AND GOT LESS THAN 3 GIG, THERE IS ENOUGH PEOPLE ON THIS FOR IT TO GO FASTER SO COME ON"
,adamf154,2010-04-06T23:51Z,"We could have all had this fucking downloaded by now if you hadn't been a bunch of absolute fuckwits and capping your speeds, i have been fucking downloading this for almost a month now 24/7"

,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-05-30T04:09Z,"26gb wont fit on a bd-r 25gb disk so youll have to buy 50gb bd-r disks which are very expensive eg looking on amazon.co.uk theyre around ÂŁ9 per disk ! anyone know a cheaper place ?
ps bd-r disks cost around ÂŁ1.40 per disk..again if you know a better deal tell me here thanks"
,PhantomWhoWalks,2010-07-17T20:27Z,"zeitgeistmandvdrip, how about to use BD_Rebuilder that is a software to shrink a Blu-ray with all menus and extras using the x264 Encoder(H264 video). Backup Blu-ray to a DVDR(also called BD5 and BD9) or a BDR. Look at: http://www.videohelp.com/tools/BD_Rebuilder"

,raster68,2010-11-06T20:52Z,Thanks for this great share....17 seeds today and a few more about to be -:)
,Hyperion888,2011-02-25T15:02Z,"thanks for the ul, its a massive amount of data, but worth it. 

CDs, DVDs Blu Rays are all shit. 

Keep it on your HDD and play it with vlc, 1920 X 1080p, or u can convert to mpeg to play on any device. 

The conversion took 7 hours, and i have a shit hot pc"
,Ponyoo,2011-11-18T16:43Z,"FUCKING AWESOME.   Thanks @spotted jackal!
"
,Ponyoo,2011-11-24T15:30Z,"Anyone talking about size, all you need is 00047.m2ts file which IS the movie and 23.3 GiB.

Use some software like TsMuxerGui (I like) to get rid of unwanted foreign audio and subs, then the file size would be around 20 GiB or so.  Same awesome quality and fits in one BD-R.  "
,Zoraster,2012-01-23T05:06Z,I remember watching this amazing film back in mid-90's after new year's day celebration (I was 15-17 years old).  Stuck with me ever since.  I'm definitely seeding this sucker!!!
