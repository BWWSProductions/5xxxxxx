,gammy69er,2010-01-02T14:09Z,"@ youssef0eddoumali

2.35:1 Cinemascope - this means that the picture is wider than a normal 16:9 picture - to get more movie in

Officially 1280 x 544 is 720p - because it includes the black bars in the equation (when in 2.35:1 Cinemascope).

If you find one that is Actual 16:9 1280x720 - enjoy the cropped movie you recieve, as it will be missing about 1/6 or more of the edges of the film."
,RedGN,2010-01-06T02:57Z,"Quality is amazing
