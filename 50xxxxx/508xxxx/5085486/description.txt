This visually stunning program traces the history and message of Islam by following the journeys of six young pilgrims from across the Muslim world to Mecca. It explores their lives and beliefs as well as the beautiful and historic mosques where they worship. They leave their homes and families, travel to Saudi Arabia, and share their responses to the culmination of their journey of a lifetime - the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the prophet Muhammad was born.
