Thanks.   You are welcome.   I've been waiting for this to appear myself.


Nice of someone to bother to say thanks.   Find it hard to believe how many can leech 24/7, but cannot come in to say a thank you.   A thank you that would only take a few seconds to post.

 And I cannot believe how many of you can leech every fuckin' thing uploaded here and never upload sweet Fanny Adams.   

If you have...upload for fuck's sake...otherwise those of us that do have will cease to bother, will cease to exist, will desist from giving a shit what happens to torrent sites, and will leave you (leechers, but not uploaders) to wallow in the graveyard-dust of timeless frozen centuries of not being able to download anything.
   If you take: you are expected to repay.

And if you don't understand Fanny Adams...check out Scotland Yard...'cause the case has never been closed...

,inAcrysis,2009-09-14T01:47Z,"Hi again. I've been going through all your torrents & would really appreciate it if you could seed the UB40 albums H2O & Signing off. They only 130Mb so shouldn't take long. Just hope I'm still connected if you do seed them! My originals were stolen a few years ago.
Thanks in advance"
