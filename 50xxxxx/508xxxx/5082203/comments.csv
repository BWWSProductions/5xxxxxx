,ILoveNcis,2010-02-13T15:59Z,FYI It's a french movie. I prefer watching movies in their native language. 
,BuzzDave,2011-04-05T02:09Z,"@ILoveNcis last time I watched that movie, it was a french movie but with some parts in serb, so either you know french and serb and thats why you dont need the subs or you are talking out of your ass.

@cgaurav007 this is a WHiiZz release so there should be subs with it, but I guess you just dont care about us and think we all speak french and serb... I speak french and english but serb??? it not that a common language...

But thx for the up the rest was great."
