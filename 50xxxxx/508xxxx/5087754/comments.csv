,akhiugo,2009-09-14T01:19Z,You need a program like WinRar to unrar the archived files. Search for it on here and you'll get it free. 7-Zip will do it also and that's freeware.
,GIJerryO,2009-09-14T04:03Z,Hey akhiugo . . . how do I (er ah umm) never mind. LMAO!  Many thanks!
,Please_wait...,2009-09-23T22:37Z,This program is very good. Works very well in to converting movies int-o 3gp and playing them on my nokia 6234.
,Please_wait...,2009-09-24T01:21Z,"   Wiredly, the 3gp setting I used for my nokia to make 3gp videos at 320x240 10fps xvid and acc mono sound ware moved to mp4 TAB in this version.

   The resulting extension of converted files would be mp4 of course. (but playable by most phones).

   This is very helpful if you want to see movies on phones with equal or greater screen resolution then 320x240 pixels, also with mp3 sound quality.
   Most phones have this resolution (like my nokia 6234), but the 3gp is only maxed to 177x144 (or so) with amr sound (pore sound codec)."
