,pluffer,2009-11-06T18:27Z,"i have downloaded it and it works fine. except that if im connected to internet it wont start. if im not connecte i can start it. and i can start it and then connect to the internet and it works. but i cant start it if im connected to the internet. whats wrong? in the task manager it comes up as a process and takes a lot of cpu but you cant do anything with it. why is that? 
i need help!"
,bmw318ti,2009-11-19T17:21Z,"when i downloaded this, the crack folder was not there. where can i get the license_standalone.dat?"
,DixonNxn,2009-11-24T05:30Z,the license file for standalone did not work for me either

,greythorne,2009-12-08T17:17Z,as usual bastards SOB's who has 100% of the copy kindly help to seed to the max.
,Dex_Luther,2009-12-13T11:12Z,"Where/how do I install this ""license manager"" thing? I've looked everywhere, and can't find it."
,opteron911,2009-12-16T07:58Z,"Install and crack worked perfect for me.  What I did:

Extract ISO to a directory (have Winrar installed, right click the .iso, extract to and pick a directory).

Went into 64 bit setup, right click the setup file, run as administrator (always a good idea it prevents some problems).

When asked picked stand alone install *not* over the internet and then entered the serial number for stand alone given by Karl above.

Matlab installed, asked about config stuff, just hit next until it asked for license key.  Again, don't pick internet, navigate to the directory where you extracted everything, then into the crack directory, and pick the ""lic_standalone.dat"".

Voila, done and running without a hitch for me."
,hotels,2009-12-19T01:36Z,Thank you
,arcanemethods,2009-12-22T22:43Z,opteron911's instructions worked for me installing it on Windows 7.  I took the additional precaution of disconnecting from the internet first and reconnecting after the first run/exit of Matlab.
,mindfighter2,2009-12-24T11:53Z,"HI ALL

great torrent, works perfectly. Big Thanks.

I also followed Opteron911 instructions in comment above, and it is working 100%, no problems at all.

Runinng Windows 7 Premium 64bits here."

if the ""crack"" folder is what is taking it over the 4.7... remove that from the .ISO before burning

... choose the ""standalone"" install, unplug from the internet while installing also, or use a firewall like COMODO that will ask you if you want to let MATLAB connect... tell it ""no"" and to remember your choice."
,kittleboy,2010-01-12T14:25Z,"Thanks nunyasochata

no,
crack is only 28Kbytes.
can i remove 64bit version cause i just use 32bit version and just write 32bit version on dvd? does it effect the install?

I could block it with kaspersky Internet security."
,Pelos21,2010-01-21T17:12Z,I don't  have the crack folder??? only the isofile to install matlab. 
,dieralo,2010-01-28T05:41Z,Does this come with full lybraries and full tool boxes??? please???
,FPChris,2010-01-29T20:00Z,"Can you Believe it?

,robin_th01,2010-02-03T17:42Z,"Somebody who has done the download please seed at max speed.
Here m not gettin the speed.
we will enjoy together."
,kittleboy,2010-02-05T10:39Z,"I finished it, but i don't know how to seed cause i removed it from my utorrent.
Anyone, the size is more than a DVD, how should i write it into a dvd,please?
will it be any problem if i remove the 64bit version folder ( win64 )?

Crack is inside the iso file with other folders

both versions, 32 and 64

I just can't open my files with older version of MATLAB, why? any way?"
,mindfighter2,2010-02-09T17:45Z,"Folks

To start MATLAB after installation, you MUST be disconnected from internet.

Everytime you want to open the software, you must be offline or the software wont start.

After the start, you can reconnect.

Thats the only bug ive found, everything else works 100%.

I dont know why. "

    * Publishing Results and Deploying Applications

Introduction

MATLABé€Ÿ is a high-level technical computing language and interactive environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numeric computation. Using the MATLAB product, you can solve technical computing problems faster than with traditional programming languages, such as C, C++, and Fortran.

You can use MATLAB in a wide range of applications, including signal and image processing, communications, control design, test and measurement, financial modeling and analysis, and computational biology. Add-on toolboxes (collections of special-purpose MATLAB functions, available separately) extend the MATLAB environment to solve particular classes of problems in these application areas.

MATLAB provides a number of features for documenting and sharing your work. You can integrate your MATLAB code with other languages and applications, and distribute your MATLAB algorithms and applications."
,cribaret,2010-02-23T06:24Z,"The annoying thing is, I initially had a problem with the license, I got help from an unexpected source, the damn activation application tells me ""Activation is complete"" and then there is a checkbox that says ""Start MATLAB."" I click ""Finish"" and BAM! The activation application runs again. This is so annoying and confusing because it tells me the program is activated and then it restarts the activation application without ever starting supposedly activated MATLAB. I tried both offline and when connected to the internet but it was all to no avail, shit I even tried to edit the license files, including my computer's name but that didn't work neither. I will officially give up if don't get any help here."
,kittleboy,2010-02-27T18:31Z,"to mindfighter2:
No, you don't need to disconnect every time,
i use Kaspersky internet security ( latest version ), only the first time i disconnected, block matlab from connecting to the internet through KIS.
That's it.
It is working fine for me,
but, only the places that it need to go online, are dangerous. ( like some demo videos i think are nedded to be connected )"
,Nashidar,2010-03-02T14:49Z,So does anybody know if this includes Simulink and Toolboxes (like the student version does)?

,castiboy,2010-03-18T20:01Z,"worked great.

it's a shame it's just a few megas above a DVD's limit... i was trying to share this with a friend and couldn't find a way to do so without an external NTFS drive :(

and to answer someone's question about removing folders: i couldn't make the installation work from outside the original ISO, and i couldn't delete any file from the original ISO.
i tried copying the entire CD into a new ISO (via winRAR), without most of the compressed win64 files that is... still, no luck there."
,lil_neutrino,2010-05-14T03:19Z,Works great on Win 7 x64. Includes all toolboxes :)
,lil_neutrino,2010-05-14T03:28Z,"To install:
**Turn off your internet!!**
1. Mount iso-file using power iso. (Google this if you dont know how)
2. Go go my computer, and to the virtual drive with solid works on it.
3. Click on the win 32 or win 64 folder depending on which one your computer is.
4. Click on set up
5. choose ""install manually without using the internet""
6. enter the ""file installation key""
   36322-23096-57999-54517-22630
7. After installation, you need to activate. Do this manually, by browsing your virtual drive for the file ""license_standalone.dat"" when asked for license file
8. Turn back on internet and enjoy!"
