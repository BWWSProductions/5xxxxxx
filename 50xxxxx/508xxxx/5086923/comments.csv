,JRefinne,2009-09-12T21:13Z,Is this a movie or documentry???
,bren_pirate,2009-09-12T21:41Z,OMG..what a piece of shit this was
,SchoolyardKiller,2009-09-12T22:06Z,"To JRefinne: No, it's not a documentary. Nothing close to it. It's a drama/horror film with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe. You can follow the imdb link above to find out more.

To bren_pirate: I doubt that this movie is a ""piece of shit."" If Lars Von Trier isn't for you, don't download his films. But just don't call his movies ""piece of shit."""
,phishthis,2009-09-12T22:28Z,"shcoolyardkiller .....why cant he call this a piece of shit...its his opinion, are you the opinion nazi?? "

,yelloo,2009-09-12T23:20Z,Thanks blowley.
,SchoolyardKiller,2009-09-13T00:31Z,"An opinion Nazi? I think not. Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion - I agree. For instance, I didn't like Trier's ""Dogville"", so if I had to review it I'd say, ""I thought it was a bad movie and I didn't like it at all."" But I would never call it a ""piece of shit"", even if I thought it were. You can call Uwe Boll's films ""piece of shit"", but you can't call Lars Von Trier's films that. It's just common cinema sense. It doesn't make me an opinion Nazi to defend great directors. "
,Toblehorde,2009-09-13T00:49Z,"I dont care ppl say about the torrents if they are bad or shitty! I just think they should thank the ppl who are putting out these torrents so that ppl dont need to spend money on going to the cinema and watch this ""piece of crap"" as bren_pirate said! Pirate be happy that the piratebay is still running and that members can put out torrents! If u dont like it piss off plz!!!

,sirac1925,2009-09-13T16:31Z,"it truly was an awful movie, the first hour is so boring I think watching paint dry would be more entertaining. and the second half is just ridiculously confusing. 

and i don't care about symbolism or any of that crap, because none of it was even explained ever. It was like an acid trip that went very very wrong. Honestly I thought I was sleeping, and dreaming this crazy mess. 

mabe some people, probably very few, enjoyed this. But I would not recommend this to anyone ever.

thanx to HORROR MANIAC for that Review:
keep in the spirit of things.... the anti-shit to the shit guy guys actually starting giving reviews of there own... to say something is shit, is a more apt summation than having to go to IMDb"
,nerv666999,2009-09-13T17:07Z,No Bren_pirate is correct. This movie really is an overly pretentious piece of shit. Maybe Lars would be better off directing music videos. Making a movie that is intentionally obtuse does not make one a genius it just makes for a bad narrative. William Dafoe is a well trained actor as a founding member of the Wooster Group and should have known better than to lend his name to tripe such as this. Save your bandwidth
,nerv666999,2009-09-13T17:23Z,but hey... big thanks to the uploader for keeping us all from having to pay to watch this unfortunate mess. Imagine how the producers must feel

,Allimak,2009-09-13T19:34Z,"To SchoolyardKiller: If he wants to call this movie a piece of shit, hes allowed. The beauty of free speech, my friend. And to be honest the movie was pretty bad, its so euro artsy that it becomes a cliche. Trier tries to ''shock'' us by showing a closeup of dick penetrating a pussy. If we want to see that we will watch porn. And often the movie goes on for 10 min with no dialog, just some trippy dream sequence. Usually of some dead animals. I get it, hes trying to be artsy, but its getting old. This is not a movie I would recommend to anyone who is looking to be entertained since there is very little entertainment value in this one. Download District 9 instead. "
,bobalazs,2009-09-13T19:51Z,I can't believe this movie starts with penile insertion. Lol. Should be rated NC-17.

,SchoolyardKiller,2009-09-14T20:18Z,"To Allimak: the beauty of free speech indeed. Well, I've seen the movie and I didn't like it and I completely agree with you: it's more aiming on the shocking side of things rather than the soul-stirring one. And since Trier's name is on the director's chair, we can make a porn movie and call it art. But I still wouldn't call it a ""piece of shit."" This man gave us ""Breaking The Waves"" and I respect him that much, even if this film isn't of my taste at all. Free speech or not you have to recognize the limits of the acceptable if you have that much respect for the intellect."

Typical LvT but with the ugliest actors ever. :)

,o00scorpion00o,2009-10-12T14:19Z,"typical of the  crap that's coming to movie theaters these days be it from the (U.S or Europe) Why is there always the argument of people thinking that they live in the best country in the world? how childish and pathetic!!! why can people not leave politics out of the reviews? If this were a forum on politics fair enough, but it isn't so keep the reviews about what it is you are downloading!!!   "
,mesidd_90,2009-10-13T08:02Z,One of my favs. Amazing movie.  
,sygaba,2009-10-17T06:32Z,"WOW well this has to be the worst film i have ever seen it has set a new benchmark in my all time shit films never to be watched again with pain of my eyeballs being remove by rusty spoons.

All it consisted of is pointless metaphors, boning, enraging suspense with no foreseeable end and random acts of gore. The distian i fell for the director, writer and all other sadist involved with the making of this film is unparallel to anything i have and will ever feel about any living being.

,Phatfish,2009-10-19T02:34Z,"I think it's a shame that film audiences today have become so lazy. Here is a film that displays artistry, subtlety, and intelligence, relying on the viewer to actually use their brain instead of be bombarded by useless imagery. This truly is a horrifying movie. And so many people have problems with it... people say it's the ""worst piece of crap"" they've ever seen, but then go and high-five each other while watching ""The House on Haunted Hill"" or ""Jeepers Creepers 2"". Movies like this are rare. I found this film to be one of the most disturbing movies I'd seen in a long time. But also suffering from poor reviews by people who don't seem to really understand what they're watching. If you are a serious movie fan, who likes to use your brain and be challenged by a film, watch this movie. It's fantastic. If you'd rather just see what the latest computer effects wizards are dreaming up, there a number of other films where things pop out at you and teenagers get killed by something. Stick to those."

,emptypockets8,2009-10-30T22:33Z,"Highly Misogynistic trope, if I understood this movie right.  From what I gathered among the other messages of this movie is this.  Women are inconstant and lustful, making them an element of the chaotic.  In almost every culture in the world, chaos is tantamount to evil.  So then women are the antonym of Christ.  Dafoe was repeatedly put in positions that made him a Christ-figure in this movie.  Furthermore, the resurrection of Christ led to the deaths and persecutions of women over the centuries.  Wow!  what a trippy ass movie.  I had to watch it twice to kind of understand. I'm still not sure I got it.  I'm also not sure if it was a good movie or if it sucked.  Audio and Video were good, though."

,Phatfish,2009-11-05T20:26Z,"@McBalls:
Im not saying anything really as that was all a quote from someone else.
But what I meant was that people seem to think its crap just BECAUSE it horrifying. (which make little sense to me)
No the movie isnt great because its horrifying,
its great because Lars von Trier made it. "

Thanks for the ul"
,schfloo,2009-11-21T18:37Z,So the fox was like BLEHHHHHHH and I was like. Cool. Interesting movie.
,black_jester,2009-12-11T04:44Z,"Poor camera work. I couldn't tell if every 30 seconds time had passed, if the camera man was just unable to move the camera, or if the editor had ADD.

First half of the movie is boring, I can't see any reason to have it on other than piss-poor background noise. 

This shouldn't be horror, this is a glorified snuff/mutilation film. It's like watching the first Saw with poor lighting, poorer camera work, and half the plot."
,DerGolem,2009-12-19T21:35Z,"Good torrent, thanks.
The talking fox is tottally ridiculous.
Couldn't STOP laughing.

Cool movie though, the christian imagery must be pretty scary for atheists... interesting idea with the ""evel women""
thanks.."

,zwoerdkop,2010-01-29T09:13Z,"See the difference between the New World and the Old World! Americans vote this movie very poor, whilst Europeans are more than positively impressed. Why?

The American perception of good movies is that they have the popcorn-factor, not the art-factor. Americans sit down in front of the screen waiting to get amused. That's all. If they don't get the full potion of cliches, they are heavily disturbed and run away from the screen fully disorientated and in full panic.

Of course this movie is High Art. A masterpiece that must be watched with an intellectual state of mind, ready to perceive a few pen strikes that give the thrill of real art.

Get your popcorn elsewhere."
,zwoerdkop,2010-01-29T16:27Z,"Excellent camera work. More than excellent editing. Don't ever insult the truth.

Poor camera work and poor editing is done by Handicam-Daddies that have just unboxed their first Sony.

And you know that."
,x_kRikKa_x,2010-02-17T03:11Z,"Good Torrent! Clean, quick download, great sound & image quality.

Now, this movie ain't for conservative/narrow-minded. I've only watched the first ten minutes of it and my expectations are quite high.

When an European producer seriously does a movie... there's no joking, here. European good movies are DARN MASTERPIECES."

,waxxhopper,2010-05-12T04:13Z,"zwoerdkop ------

Your seriously deranged if you assume ALL Americans watch movies the same exact way, there's 350,000,000 of us, do really think we all watch movies the same way? And after your comment that this movie is ""High Art"" or a ""Masterpiece"", i am proved right about you being deranged, Dude the 9nth Symphony is a masterpiece, the White Album, is High Art.... This movie?.... watchable and pretty decent.... I hope all Europeans arent like you :)"

,Dahhak,2011-03-05T15:56Z,"This site is getting full of fucking film critics. Do you all have degrees in that or something? There's the ones that are too shallow to understand the film, so they would call it crap. Then you have the ones that know it's artsy and European and all that stuff so it must be great. But both are trying to convince me to either watch it or not, pretending that they have all the truth..."
,infernal13,2011-04-13T14:48Z,"I've just watched the movie and i don't know if i should call it the best or the worst i've seen, but the one thing i know for sure is that movie is the most horrible, sick-minded movie i've ever seen in my whole life, my balls still hurt from watching this movie. 

don't get me wrong, the movie beautiful but in a hideous way, i kinda wish i didn't watch it, it's just toooo much from humans.

P.S you're better off not watching this movie."
