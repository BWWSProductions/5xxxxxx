,JoiresWay-II,2009-09-11T03:48Z,"Hi, thanks for this docu. Actually this was aired on BBC 2 on the Fifth of September. This consists of all the album documentaries in one episode, which is great and the one which bubanee uploaded was the original one which comes with the CD (enhanced). BBC also aired ""Beatles in USA"" the next day after they aired this one."
