,Simon2672,2009-09-15T20:14Z,"Thanks a big bunch for the upload !!!

@woouala, these are .flac files."
,woouala,2009-09-15T21:45Z,"@Simon2672 Indeed they are, and as anything they have a bitrate. The log files of this torrent say that they are 128kbps, any descent .flac should be over 500kbps. I won't pretend I understand the whole thing, but this isn't in proper quality.  
As for contrast, the remastered monos are ripped into 768kbps."
,thkspr,2009-09-16T03:01Z,"The bitrate assigned when you rip a CD and convert it to flac (as EAC does) does not have any meaning to the encoder. You can assign 0 if you wish and the conversion will be the same. The flac encoder does not have ""bitrate"" as a parameter. You can check the bitrate of the flac files and you will confirm this. Ir you want to make sure this files come from real CDs and not from already compressed files use Audiochecker.
BTW. Great post!"

[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-09-17T20:40Z,"As i already noted in another discussion a few days ago:

This is unfortunately legit!!

I've done a comparision with the aid of some spectrum analyzers and there is no doubt about it.
Contrary to the '87 recording these new remasters are dithered. This method is being used for downsampling, e.g.: from 24bit to 16bit"

,kornchild2002,2009-09-19T02:58Z,"I am downloading the whole release now.  I have already purchased some of the albums so I can compare those (CRC values and spectrographs).  Either way, I think that this is real.  There are some real idiots on here making some dumbass comments.  wooula, there is a reason why the log says 128kbps for the bitrate.  That is EAC's default bitrate setting.  FLAC, much like all other command line encoders, aren't limited by the bitrate selector in EAC.  That bitrate may end up in EAC's log but it isn't the actual bitrate of the songs.  How do I know this?  I have been using EAC for over 5 years now.  It always selects 128kbps for the default bitrate.  EAC's logs would show 128kbps despite me ripping to --alt-preset standard (with Lame 3.90.3) oh so long ago.  So that gets rid of that ""theory.""

What else?  File sizes can be decreased when content playing in the left and right fields are the same.  This is similar to what Lame uses for joint-stereo encoding.  File sizes can be shaved while keeping lossless quality.  Please educate yourselves about EAC and FLAC before making comments.

There are currently 572 seeders and over 1000 other people all involved with this torrent.  It will take awhile to download."
[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-09-19T04:28Z,"Because so many sceptics concerning the ""2009 Beatles Remasters"" here on Piratebay, i took a short sequence from the stereo versions of ""I am the Walrus"" (album: ""Magical Mystery Tour"") to show the fine distinctions between the old and the new ones.

I generated a short wavefile and made some screenshots to highlight the differences, so everybody has 

the chance to make his own position.

Thanks for the upload, Anonymous"
,rippervanwinkle,2009-09-19T17:02Z,"These are the real 2009 remasters.

I completed this torrent a few days ago and I also  own the 1987 remixed CDs of Let It Be, Rubber Soul,  Abbey Road, Sgt Pepper and Revolver (retail and paid for, not downloaded!) and these 2009 editions have slightly different track lengths because they *are* slightly different mixes.

You probably also know that the 2009 CDs have an embedded quicktime short documentary film.  So look at the EAC cue files within each folder.  Example, Rubber Soul: 14 audio tracks, and the final entry on the cue file is

TRACK 15 MODEx/2xxx
    INDEX 00 02:21:07

which shows the presence of the movie on the original CD. 

Also it's safe to disregard the fact that the release was made one week before the CDs went on sale in the shops.  There were plenty of copies sent out for review to the music press and general newspapers. A quick google will show you reviews of these 2009 remasters in reputable journals/sites a week or two before the release to the public.  This is how marketing and publicity works ;-)

Clearly the releaser is someone who was sent, or had access to, a review set and it's equally clear why he/she chose to remain anonymous. "
,thuerrsch,2009-09-19T23:57Z,"A thousand thanks for this! 

Anybody who doubts the authenticity of these rips should just download them and listen to one of their favorite songs. If you know the old CDs, you'll hear the difference at once. If you can't hear it, you're half deaf and it won't make a difference for you anyway. And if you've never heard the old versions, well then, welcome back to earth, wherever you've been those past 20 years, and please enjoy your first encounter with the Beatles' music."

,greatnorthernpirate,2009-10-13T10:33Z,After downloading several albums I am trying to burn to CD using Burrrn using the CUE files. Every time I get an error suggesting that the last track on every album can't be found. Has anyone else seen this? Very strange and no amount of editing of the CUE file seems to help.
,thkspr,2009-10-23T03:00Z,"That is because the last file is a data file, not a music file. You can remove it, burn the CD and you will still have all the songs."
,scott_ehm,2009-10-23T14:01Z,This sounds like the real deal except the cue files are atrocious. I had to manually edit the spelling errors in a few of them. All of them need the last track taken off as they refer to the quicktime file which doesn't exist in these rips. Thanks though.

Do you really put all that effort and throw it all away ending up with a FLAC-conversion similar to really crappy Mp3???? WHY????

,thkspr,2009-11-10T05:29Z,"@reine12

Check the files, you will see that the bitrate is not 128k.
The 128k parameter that you mentioned does not have any meaning to the converter. You can see it in the log but it is not passed to the converter since it is not an valid option for the program.
Have you ever used EAC and/or FLAC.EXE? Do your homework"
,reine12,2009-11-12T20:14Z,"Off cource you can choose the quality!!! You can go down all the way to 56kb/s. Unde ""EAC"" You have something called ""compession settings"" If you then choose to transform the file into a FLAC file, doesn't mean that you have the quality intact!!! YOU should do your homework!"

,thkspr,2009-11-12T23:35Z,"I agree with you that the LOG says that, but the FLAC encoder does not recognize the parameter, but this parameter is not actually passed to the FLAC encoder since IT IS NOT AN OPTION to this command. You can choose ANY bitrate you want and the actual bitrate will not be affected, Only the size of the file is affected when you choose the option ""compression level"" (not included in the EAC interface, you must actually code it yourself) this option does not have an effect on the quality. In ths case, it really does not matter what the LOG says about the bitrate. Check the FLAC command in ""Additional command line options"" in the LOG file to see the actual parameters passed. Compare these options with the FLAC command options and you will see.
If you want to use an external program from within another (as FLAC used from EAC) you should understand how parameters are passed from one program to the other. Read a little and experiment yourself.
The parameter ""compression settings"" in EAC only apply to lossy encoders like LAME (MP3)."
,OzBrickie,2009-11-19T11:59Z,"@reine12

Sorry mate, you are the fool.

Flac.exe does not recognize any ""bitrate"" compression settings. It is a lossless encoder. End of story. The only compression settings you can change are large or small, 1 to 8. It will still be lossless, perfect CD quality.

You can have whatever bitrate you like in the compression box but the only thing that flac will listen to is the additional command line that you failed to include in your copy and paste of the log.

Im afraid you may need to do some homework mate . http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=EAC_and_FLAC"

I have listened to this entire collection for months now, with good headphones, and it is the most clear recordings as any I have ever heard. I too have ran comparison tests, and indeed, these are the real 2009 remasters in high quality Flac format. If the audio quality was not awesome somebody would of bothered to of upload a flac version with a bit rate log file that claimed a higher number. The quality of these discs is top notch. "

,XxM24Ty,2010-02-03T00:03Z,"jsleitrip: There is more than one way to get these songs on Itunes. I will explain my method- I simply made audio dics of each Beatles CD then used Itunes to rip the Audio CD. Make sure PeerBlock HTTP is OFF so that Itunes can fetch the song titles from another online source- it works perfect. Rip in Apple lossless for best quality.

To make Audio CD one can use many methods, such as using free Flac to 16bit Wave converter programs- Then use CD burning program to burn the wave files to CD."

,NoCode0680,2010-08-04T18:01Z,"Everything sounds very good.  I actually bought all these CD's, but I sold them to a used music store after I ripped them to my computer.  However my external harddrive crashed with all my music, luckily I had backups of all the albums except for Rubber Soul, The White Album and Let It Be, so I downloaded this torrent.  I compared the ones I still have to what's in this torrent, and unlike some other torrents, these are in fact the 2009 remasters and not just the standard old CD's being advertised as such.  

I was a little concerned with the White Album, I noticed some pretty loud hissing in the background on a few songs, like Martha My Dear.  I pulled out my old 30th Anniversary Edition of the White Album and the hissing is on that too, so it's part of the recording.  It's just louder and more noticable here because I guess part of the remastering process was just to crank up the volume some."

,harry218,2011-04-28T13:17Z,"To move FLAC to iTunes, I usually converted the files to WAV using Winamp.

It's simple : drag the files to Winamp playlist, go to preferences>Plug-ins>Output change to ""Nullsoft Disk Writers"". Then start the playlist and the files will be converted to WAV. This is the defult setting in my Winamp.

If you think the WAV files too big, convert them to ALAC or AAC in iTunes."

I have many of the Beatles albums and you can definitely tell them apart, cleaner, crisper sound, but some songs seem to have a little to much stereo separation they seem to be empty in the middle if that makes sense. AVS Audio Converter is what I use. It can convert to any format and if you use the Windows Lossless (PCM 16bit) setting when importing into itunes all the info is added as well, its like importing a CD. Just to be safe I burn all my flac files to DVD.
Thank you so much. This is awesome."
