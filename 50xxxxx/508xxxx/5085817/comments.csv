thanks for the torrent"
,unfairy,2009-11-06T00:52Z,Not sure. I don't use an emulator.
,NikoZBK,2009-11-07T00:20Z,What's the size after everything is decompressed?
,unfairy,2009-11-07T21:27Z,"The iso will be 4.59 Gigs. It takes the compressed size on a USB Loader partition. I think it will burn to a regular DVD. I don't know how DVD booting works though.

I run it on Configurable USB Loader with cIOS 249."
,bteljuice,2009-11-13T23:31Z,"Noob here.So help, dont bash :)

I know ISO files that i usually download are 4.4GB. I have homebrew and USBloader.

this file is only 405Mb. How can I play this on my wii. I have a usb HDD.
Do i need to download any other software?"
,unfairy,2009-11-25T11:10Z,"The file is 405MB because I ""scrubbed"" it. Meaning, I used a program to delete all the superfluous dummy data that the Wii requires of the disc. The game data is only 405MB, but the iso is 4.59GB (or whatever) because the discs are that size. You'll notice that the file you downloaded is a rar. Unrar and you'll get an iso that is 4.59GB (or whatever). To use USB loaders, they format the HDD to a specific format that Windows can't read. You need a program that can work in that format and transfer isos to the HDD's special USB loader partition.

However, it not my prerogative to help you beyond that."

,kdude63,2011-01-16T09:42Z,@bteljuice As far a Wii backup ISO files that have been extracted by USBloader programs such as WiiFlow or USBLoaderGX the sizes vary. I know that Super Smash Bros Brawl is a 6 Gig game whereas Super Mario Bros Wii only takes up a couple hundred Megabytes. It works the same way as PC games do. All games take up different amounts of space. ;D
,Pogie4,2011-02-03T11:49Z,Is this a hack or an original game (means not hack)?
,modemslayer2,2011-04-25T07:04Z,"Does this work with USB Loader GX v2.1 IOS 249 Rev 20?? 
I downloaded the pal wbfs file and got black screen after the hold wii remote horizontally screen same happened with neogammer.."
,unfairy,2011-09-07T11:33Z,"Unless otherwise labelled as such, my uploads are full rips of games. The most I'll ever do is scrub out the updates. I don't guarantee it though.

You need to use DVD-R if you have an older Wii. Burnt discs don't work on the newer ones (not sure when exactly as mine is a launch Wii).

This works fine on CFG loader as far as I know should work on any properly set up Wii/emulator. Make sure you can run NTSC region."
,RtKGamez,2012-01-16T18:01Z,"@unfairy 
Wii's stopped bein able to read burned games in 2009
anything before that is good to go though"
,Wiintakid,2012-03-19T18:20Z,"The torrent works up until chapter 5-4 for me, the game stops working it doesnt freeze but i'm unable to move at all."
