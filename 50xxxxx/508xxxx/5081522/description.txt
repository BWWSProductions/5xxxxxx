Vince Seneri - Three Albums - Jazz Organ


Vince Seneri is considered to be one of the best jazz organists around. He is one of these cats capable of playing advanced bass lines himself while at the same time soloing on top with great complexity and dexterity. All with a really great groove.

Raised in Hackettstown, NJ, Vince Seneri began his musical career at the age of six. His father, Peter Settineri, was an accordionist, who played professionally with his own band, and introduced the instrument to Vince. Later, his father bought a Hammond M-3 organ, and introduced that instrument to him as well. He learned the accordion, then devoted himself to the Hammond organ and piano.

During his teens, it was the great jazz organist Jimmy Smith who musically influenced Vince the most.

Vince Seneri has performed and recorded several albums, with some of the best musicians in the business today including: Randy Brecker, Dave Valentin, Houston Person, David 'Fathead' Newman, Paul Bollenback and Buddy Williams.
