Heavily bootlegged BBC Radio 1 broadcast of Japan live in concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon on February 7th 1981 on their "Polaroids Tour". Tracks from the albums "Obscure Alternatives" (October 1978), "Quiet Life" (December 1979) and "Gentlemen Take Polaroids" (November 1980) plus a radically different take on non-album track "European Son", subsequently included on 1981 compilation "Assemblage" and remixed and re-released as a single in 1982.
