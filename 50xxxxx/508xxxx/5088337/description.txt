The entire re-imagined series with all 4 seasons, the original mini-series, all webisodes (resistance and face of the enemy), the TV special Razor as well as the pilot for Caprica; a spin-off of BSG that takes place 50 years before the original war. Season 1-4 all have subtitles. 

Definitely worth watching at least once!




Enjoy and Please Seed!
