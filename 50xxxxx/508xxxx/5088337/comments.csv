,kornfan4,2009-10-15T00:38Z,What happened to the seeder? Everyone is stuck on 65.1%
,DL_King,2009-10-15T21:47Z,"Sorry everyone, the power went out in my area and reset all my computers. 

They are all back up and uploading now and I will be adding another seed source as soon as I finish another upload.... so in the next day or so"
,kornfan4,2009-10-17T03:23Z,Thanks so much!!!! Definitely looking forward to this!
,cybertribe,2009-10-22T17:36Z,"soo slow after 70%.
i've already uploaded it at least 4 times, and still haven't downloaded myself"
,greaver88,2009-10-26T21:13Z,Could someone please seed this?  We are all stuck at 90%.  
,kornfan4,2009-10-29T07:44Z,This is a bit rediculous. Any reason why the 5 seeders arent really doing any seeding? I've found myself uploading about 99% of the time and downloading nothing.
,DL_King,2009-10-31T02:11Z,"This torrent is still on its initial seed. As of now (oct. 30/09 9:00 pm EST) there is 96.8% available since 4/5 seed sources are part of my networks. The 5th seed confuses me a little but the torrent should be complete (ie leechers currently at 96.8ish now will be done) in approx. 2 days.  Hope you enjoy and PLEASE REMEMBER TO SEED, especially sent out to all those who complain about slow seed speeds, remember if you don't seed then you shouldn't DL.  

For any interested in more BSG action check out my torrent for

,kornfan4,2009-11-02T08:21Z,As soon as I finish downloading this I will leave it seeding permenantly so everyone else can get it too! I'm at 99.9% with 28mb left to download.
,greaver88,2009-11-02T09:19Z,"Just finished downloading!  I will seed this for as long as I can.  What a great series...thank you DL_King, very much worth the wait!"
,kornfan4,2009-11-02T09:22Z,"Just finished downloading, will now leave my computer seeding this file as long as there are downloaders on the torrent."
,herindoors,2009-11-28T19:26Z,"Please seed.  I'm at 64% after 4 days and the estimated DL finish is currently 14 weeks!!  

This is an excellent series and the quality of the files is good.  Already can't get enough!  If the makers would make it available for download I'd get it from them, I'm just sick of finding places to store my ever expanding collection of DVD's.  Especially as they'll be out of date or unusable before we know it and I'll have to buy everything AGAIN.

Thanks King for uploading this.  It's an amazing series and you did the graft of collecting it all in one place and uploading."
,herindoors,2009-12-01T01:31Z,Multiple tracker errors?  Whats happening?
,DL_King,2009-12-03T20:35Z,"@herindoors

Depending on the global region your downloading some trackers are not available to be used (ie there are ~4 unavailable in the continental US) that's why there are multiple trackers to help improve speed. Hope this answers your question.

Enjoy and please seed!"
,cyclaman,2009-12-09T13:59Z,"Many, many thanks, for a great torrent! I have watched two episodes already and the quality is very good. Also thanks for the episode guide! It took 3 days to download but was well worth it. I shall seed when when I can. "
,Saffyblue,2009-12-18T22:13Z,"DL_King, thank you for the great torrent!
It took me a week to download the files, but it was worth the wait. Seeding now :)"
,technosailor,2010-01-02T09:52Z,"Put this on Initial-Seeding, seeders are 1:10 compared to leechers."

,DL_King,2010-01-02T23:23Z,"@technosailor

I've added 2 more seed sources as well as adding some of the additional trackers. I hope this improves things for you!

To everyone who has completed, commented and helped by seeding I would like to personally thank you guys.

Keep up the awesome work!

as always...
Enjoy and Please Seed"

,bigOT65,2010-10-20T03:45Z,"Just finished it, and am seeding.  None of season one are playing properly, however. All others seem to be working.  Anyone else have any issues/ ideas about it?"
,bigOT65,2010-10-20T15:21Z,"Still seeding. I got Season 1 to work,just had to download some more codecs.  Still not sure what I was missing, and although it will play in WMP, it still won't play in DIVX play, for more than a half a second.  Very curious.  You might want to post the codecs used, or any other issues you might be aware of."
,Timestretch69,2011-01-12T19:33Z,Does this also include the Miniseries from 2003?
