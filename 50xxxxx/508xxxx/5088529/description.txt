In an overbuilt city, Zed is an outcast. He always dreamt to be free and of a door. When he was chased by the police, he saw the door of his dreams. Not knowing what lies behind, he jumps in. When he opens his eyes he doesn't see all the metal of the city, but instead a green scenery and for the first time in his life he can feel the wind blow. He meets a girl named Roia, who appears to be a "Shard Caster". Shard Casters are people who have the power to control spirits and allow them to fight for you. Together with Roia and with her master Jiko, Zed learns how to cast shards. Just in time because this new world seems in peril...
