,BlowBye,2009-09-15T15:22Z,"Many thanks, it works well.  Even took the Online Updates without protesting. Remember to restart the app after entering the activation serial.

Not sure why but the app will not run sandboxed under Windows 2003 server."
,c3Rhcno,2009-10-10T14:48Z,"It still has the logo, it's registered but yet it's still has the logo, is it somehow not done?"
,c3Rhcno,2009-10-10T14:53Z,"Sorry, my bad, I put the e-mail in wrong, I put it in right then restarted the program, worked perfectly. Good torrent"
,weijsm,2009-10-12T14:08Z,"Having problem after trying to publish
background flashes red and it reads ""THIS SITE WAS CREATED WITH AN ILLEGAL VERSION OF WYSIWYG WEBBUILDER!""

Plz help have followed instructions
Maybe serail is blacklisted?"
,bialystok,2009-10-15T09:35Z,"---""THIS SITE WAS CREATED WITH AN ILLEGAL VERSION OF WYSIWYG WEBBUILDER!""---

Any solution for this?????

All advise are welcome"
,SDguy,2010-01-14T02:15Z,"Seems every uploaded version of this ends up with the ""This page was created with an illegal copy of WYSIWYG"" message, but whenever a downloader asks for help or advice, the responses dry up.

Are these just one week trials that are being uploaded to PB by the WYSIWYG teams themselves, by any chance?

If so, it would probably be better to just go and download the full 30 DAY trial from the WYSIWYG site.

Please don't shoot the messenger."
,SDguy,2010-01-21T09:52Z,"Hmmm. As I thought. Guess that that's that, then.

Thanks, anyway, for the upload. 

Just a darned shame I can't get one of these to work for more than a few days. :-( "
