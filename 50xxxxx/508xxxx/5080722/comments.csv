,77bigmac77,2009-09-09T23:18Z,"Downloaded very quick thanks for putting this up it's not even out yet. Only good song on it was Hyyerr (besides Day N Nite, but that's old news now). Kid Cudi is defintely not as good as some other rappers making music right now, and not even close to classic rap."
,nikkoli,2009-09-24T21:25Z,"if 77bigmac77 doesn't like it. nobody likes it.

good thing i read your comment.. I almost downloaded this."
,phelony420,2009-12-17T06:04Z,"You guys are idiots Kid cudi's one of the sickest rappers out right now at least he's not talking about bitches,gats,and coke like all these other faggots."
,Crunched,2010-01-02T03:23Z,"Yea, I'm listening to ALL hip hop right now and I definitely approve Kid Cudi. Kanye helped him out for sure, and some of the tracks are pretty solid! 
Not one of the top dogs, but definitely has potential and a pretty good sound already.
And he is rapping about ""bitches"" and talks about drugs quite a bit phelony420. And if you're concerned about drugs, why does it says 420 in your username? "

,ahaalco,2010-03-12T05:00Z,"its not that he DOESNT rap about bitches and drugs cause he does. but he doesn't sound like a retard when he does like other dumbass rappers. cough kanye, cough lil wayne, cough radio."
