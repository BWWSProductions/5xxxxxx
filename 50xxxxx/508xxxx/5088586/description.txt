just install and play full game

Meet the Chuzzles! These googly-eyed little balls of fur giggle, squeak, and sneeze as you poke and push them across the board. Free them by forming groups of three or more, but watch out for dangerous puzzle locks! Explore four different game modes as you earn trophies, unlock secret games, and more! From the creators of Bejeweled and Zuma, once you start popping Chuzzles you wonâ€™t want to stop!
