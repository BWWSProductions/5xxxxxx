,lotrman,2009-12-29T19:04Z,I got some fucking anoying shit on my computer (windows security alerts) and I will write what I think about this program when its done.
,lotrman,2009-12-29T19:10Z,I klicked run as admin on the file but nothing happend.
,mxz800_2001,2009-12-30T20:13Z,"@lotrman: Depending how nasty the shit is that's on your computer, sometimes it blocks the install of known anti malware software like malwarebytes, adaware etc.  3 things you can try are:

#1 rename the malwarebytes install file to something else, anything you want. Jut make sure to not change the extension (.exe)

#2 Try installing Malwarebytes while in safe mode. 

#3 If these options won't work, try these other 2 programs: ""hijack this"" and ""smitfraud fix"". They're both free to download. Smitfraud fix has never let me down. Be advised though, be careful with it...it can really jack up your computer if you don't pay attention to the option selections. 

Good luck!"
