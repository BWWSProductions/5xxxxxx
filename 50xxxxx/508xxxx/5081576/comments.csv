,webmarek,2009-09-09T01:27Z,"Ummm, this torrent has been downloaded over 300 times in just 24 hours. Does anyone have any comments about it?"
,sp_addict,2009-09-12T22:48Z,"Has anyone successfully been able to update their 3200 with this?  I've got a 2GB SD card, but there doesn't appear to be any options to read directly from the SD card ...the default disk space is just under 1GB, and this update file is 1.25GB.  Help! :)"
,sp_addict,2009-09-12T23:09Z,"FYI (for anyone trying), this update will not work on the 3200.  I modified the meda.cfg file to read off the 2GB SD card, but the new map updates (this download) produce a ""this map is not compatible with this unit"" error message after rebooting the device.  Just trying to save the 3200 users like me a little download time :)"
,sp_addict,2009-09-12T23:46Z,"*** CORRECTION, I'm an idiot ***
This file *does* work on the 3200 ...it just usually helps when you actually put the SD card *in* the device.  Sorry for all the confusion! :)"
,dominodennis,2009-09-25T06:45Z,"I have copied all of the files onto a 2 gig card, I do not know how to get the unit to look at the card instead of its internal memory.  I read that the one guy changed a cfg. file, but don't know how to do that.  Help please....."
,auswalk,2009-10-04T02:13Z,i copied / replaced files directly on the sim card and then rebooted roadmate 1412 but it now no longer has canada and us regions. am i doing anything wrong?
,eappan,2009-10-13T06:34Z,"US and Canada Maps are missing in GPS regions after the copy. Took a backup and copied NRBM_NA.MGI, Canada/US .imi and .poi files. But unable to see the US canada maps after the update. Planning to restore the data. 

I have a Magellan Roadmate 1412. Before the POI update f/w was updated to 3.12 from magellan website."
,OmniusPrime,2009-11-16T07:00Z,Any chance of getting the Spring 2009 map update?
,skwerlabusr,2009-12-06T03:43Z,Worked great on my Maestro 4250!

,FlippyJeez,2009-12-15T18:51Z,This one worked on my Maestro 4250 as well. Thank you very much. I've been using it for a couple of months without any issues.
,MadeOfFake,2010-01-22T23:27Z,"Great upload, hope it works.
Will be seeding"

,adam_kenny,2010-05-11T06:57Z,"I need help, my maps look okay but the towns aren't showing up, they are just numbers. and when i go to points of interest i can't search by town.  i have a 4040"
,RussWill,2010-10-28T02:48Z,"Works well on my 4250 firmware 4.86 ! ! !
Many Many Thanks ! ! !"
,Philipp5,2010-11-18T06:54Z,"Did not work on my Maestro 4040 with the latest firmware. I deleted the files in the MAP directory and replaced them with these. Unit starts up with message about loading SD card. The 4040 has built in memory and an extra SD slot for music, etc."
,zibby61,2010-11-20T06:48Z,"Just updated my Magellan Maestro 3140,which had original map from 2005.Everything works great.Maps database is now 31 instead of old 27.
Do not copy enything to SD card,just open map folder on your GPS unit and replace old files with new ones from your computer(copy and paste).Try to use windows xp if posible.
Thanks ."
,TorrentChick,2011-03-09T02:34Z,Does anyone know if it would work on a Magellan Maestro 4350?
,lolynn63,2011-10-11T19:24Z,Seems to have worked perfectly for my 4040.  Thanks for the great instructions!  Magellan wanted me to trade my unit in and buy a new one!  I was outraged!  I'm thrilled to be able to update my current unit and keep it!
