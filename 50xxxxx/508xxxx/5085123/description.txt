Wikipedia bio:

"The Very Best of Japan is a compilation album by the British band Japan, released worldwide in 2006 by EMI Music.
Although not the first Japan compilation to collect recordings from the band's career on both Hansa Records and Virgin Records, it is certainly the most comprehensive and also the first to be released worlwide, including all nine of their UK top 40 hit singles as well as two other singles that made the top 50, released between the years 1981 and 1983; "The Art of Parties" (#48, 1981), "Quiet Life"(#19, 1981), "Visions Of China" (#32, 1981), "European Son (Remix)" (#31, 1981), "Ghosts" (#5, 1982), "Cantonese Boy" (#24, 1982), "I Second That Emotion (Remix)" (#9, 1982), "Life In Tokyo (Remix)" (#28, 1982), "Nightporter (Remix)" (#29, 1982), "All Tomorrow's Parties (Remix)" (#38, 1983) and "Canton" (Live) (#42, 1983). 
The Very Best of Japan includes both the single and album versions of their biggest commercial hit "Ghosts", the 12" mix of "The Art of Parties" as well as the Steve Nye remix of "Taking Islands in Africa", originally released as the B-side of the "Visions of China" 7" single in 1981." The version of "Nightporter" included on this compilation is however neither the 7" nor the 12" version remixed by Steve Nye and released in 1982, but the regular album cut from 1980's "Gentlemen Take Polaroids". The album was originally planned to include several other 7" single versions of songs that have never been on CD but in the end it was decided by EMI to use the album versions."
