Let's find that OTHER torrent : I'm french so I wouldn't need subs anyway.."
,Almarenan,2009-09-15T09:08Z,"Haven't found the other one (sigh) ..

I'll have to wait for another occasion to get that movie.
It's a shame, really 'cuze the movie's great (aah, la Binoche !!)..."
,kaminer,2009-09-15T10:15Z,"Can someone else tell me if they are having any problem withthe torrent file?
If so I'll produce a new torrent file."
,Almarenan,2009-09-15T20:01Z,"Pleeeeeeeeeaaazzzze do so : I really want to get/see this film ...

TIA"
,Almarenan,2009-09-15T20:34Z,"BTW, got the URL of that other torrent you spoke of ?
Can't find on Pirate Bay or Torrent Finder ..."
,kaminer,2009-09-16T23:09Z,"demonoid is down at the moment and will be so for some time.

I'll make a new torrent and post is somewhere else and I'll announce it here but only after other people finish this download  it takes some time as I have slow speed for upload :) "
,kaminer,2009-09-21T13:15Z,"@ Almarenan 
As soon as demonoid is back I'll post a torrent file with the main tracker only for the film. I'll give you the link here and also let you know which other trackers you may add directly from your vuze client.
Either way I would suggest you should reinstall your client as all the torrents I've uploaded recently have had several downloads by vuze/azurreus clients. It might be something to do with the instalation gone wrong."
