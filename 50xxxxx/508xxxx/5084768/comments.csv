,doddsie,2009-09-11T01:24Z,"shame really dont so much care so much for most companies ripping people off, but they were pretty much giving this game away, ÂŁ2.51 you could buy this for on the champ man website, i think you still cant till 2am on the 11th of sept. go on support them and get the game for next to nothing anyway."
,fredf1,2009-09-11T11:37Z,"How do you get this game to run? Followed the instructions but still get ""Please insert original cd instead of a back-up copy (1000)"" message. Any help would be appreciated!"
,muslix,2009-09-11T14:41Z,"I have the same problem. I tried with a couple of different versions of Daemon Tools Pro. I tried 4.12.0223 and then I tried a newer version, 4.3.030 or something along those lines and neither worked.

Has anybody gotten this to work?"
,muslix,2009-09-11T14:42Z,"Oh, forgot to mention. Yes I did mount an IDE 3 drive with the 4.3.* version of DT as the instructions suggest."
,muslix,2009-09-11T17:37Z,"Hmm, it says 29.99 on their site not 2.51.. "
,joonoo1337,2009-09-12T09:50Z,"Thank you this is great while waiting for FM2010,
just hope its work now.... =)"
,fresh69,2010-03-04T16:55Z,"burned it to disc as well and it still has the ""insert original cd ....."" crap coming up, i played it for about 2 seasons before this started happening and now cannot work around??? can anyone out there solve this? (ps i cant believe people are whining about d/ling games no matter how cheap, slightly hippocritical seeing as your on a fucking torrent site!!!)"
