Hi there..

Firstly I'd like to tell you about a new Christian site:
 
http://www.blazefire.org/

Registrations are open for a while. Safe, no ads, pure, non-denominational site.

Now about this upload:

Here are some more unusual footage and material. Now from an unknown era in Egyptian history. And a mystical figure that was second to the Pharaoh in power, but came from outside the dynasty's bloodlines..

The Archaeologist and explorer J. Gray takes us through yet another journey through the landscape of the past. Again he does it through the simple method of him and a silver screen and slides and a camera.
Through hieroglyphics and depictions and statues and ancient records, he point out to us a man by the name of Imhotep. But who was this man? Why and how could someone that did not come from the lineage of the blood of the pharaohs, be elevated to a position that was next to Pharaoh himself in command?

J. Gray makes a certain case and lays out an explanation to this that may baffle many, but it is not to be discarded easily. The truth has a unique way of convincing those who really want to know it's full potential, with all aspects taken into consideration, even aspects that shake our foundation so we might have to change our views and stands. But that's just what growth in knowledge and wisdom has in it's wake..

Love from
Verifire.
