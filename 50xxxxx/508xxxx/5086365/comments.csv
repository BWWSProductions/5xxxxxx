,torrent-sweetie,2009-09-12T10:54Z,I look forward to watching this one. Thanks.
,HamsterXX,2009-09-12T13:04Z,Trackers are back up dude. Torrent box sucks. 
[T],verifire,2009-09-12T17:48Z,"@HamsterXX: Yeah, I can see that some tracker must be up and running now.. Thanks for the info. Great!! TPB rules the waves, just like I hoped and waited for!
And yes, TBox isn't quite the same as TPB, that much is true. But; since I've begun uploading there and other places, I'll actually continue to do so anyway. Broader results on searches and lots more people getting access to the material than before..

And some people won't go to TPB. The reasons may be many. I for my part, owe my gratitude to TPB, and have been such a long time member here, that I still uploaded while the trackers were down, but I really could do without having to see my neighbors wife or daughter's T&A filling 1/4 of the page. I solved that one by installing AdBlock Plus as addon to my Firefox. Free and works great for almost any ads..

But anyway, I think that's perhaps one of the reasons why some won't go here.. I mean, Christians (like myself) are funny that way. We're all different, but nudity and such is so dangerous to a Christian in some cases, that it'll actually lead to him condemning himself for his or her eyes being drawn towards it. That is a bit silly, because Jesus says that ""..whoever looks at a woman TO LUST FOR HER, have already committed adultery with her in his heart.""

Some of us thinks that we've sinned if our mortal flesh tempts us, or even worse; if our mortal flesh draws our eyes towards that section, automatically and not because we really want to check out what's there. It just happens, now and then, because we are human. Paul writes about that like this: ""..I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. BUT I SEE ANOTHER LAW IN MY MEMBERS, WARRING against the law in my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."" That's from the end of Romans 7, if you'd like to look it up.

Many mis-interpret this, or simply do not understand what he means, but he means that we are human, and if it is not our will to sin that drives us, but we stumble because there's a law that dwells in our bodies, then it is not ""we"" that sin, but the flesh.

Of such sin, we are not to feel guilty, because this law is inevitable going to manifest itself in weak moments, but while walking according to the law of God in our minds, we will, little by little, be freed and changed by the Spirit of God into a new creation, so that what once tempted us and even held us captive.

Take for instance pornography, which is exactly what these ""ads"" aim to promote; lust for other women, was a shameful and heavy bond for me once. I was, in a manner, lusting for other women than my wife, and it was hard, but through the grace of God and thanks to the Holy Spirit that he sent to me when I asked Him for it because I wanted to obey Him and didn't want to hurt my wife anymore, I am now changed on that particular point, so I avoid looking at other women, and it is such a relief.. I can't explain it, but imagine not ever having to feel or be cause to jealousy anymore! That alone is worth the struggle and the price to pay on the way by saying NO, and turning my head the other way if I felt the temptation.
And now I rarely or never feel even a little tempted to give the columns or porn-mag shelves in the shops a ""quick onceover"".
Now that's a miracle right there, and a proof of what the Word of God promise is true; that God now writes His laws onto our hearts, and make us walk according to them, fulfilling the righteous demands in the law, like it says further in Romans 8..

And it's the same with every sin a human being is tempted to commit or is bound by: God only wants to help us to get rid of things that are harmful and/or hurtful to ourselves and people around us. That's all.
That's what He defines us by, that's what He wants for us! That's the basis of it all! That's what the whole God, Jesus, sacrifice, creation, heaven or hell, Bible - ""thing"" is all about. It's that easy!

Imagine not hurting those you love or anyone anymore, ever! Never waking up with a bad hangover and shameful and h"
[T],verifire,2009-09-12T20:50Z,"I'm sorry, I just saw that a sentence in the above ended in a rather abrupt way, so bear with me as I end it properly.. :)

""..but while walking according to the law of God in our minds, we will, little by little, be freed and changed by the Spirit of God into a new creation, so that what once tempted us and even held us captive, is being replaced by righteousness. Not to interpreted so that we by our own will can make ourselves righteous in the sight of God, but through faith in Him who alone have the power to transform our mortal and sinful flesh into, let's say containers of this new being, through the very faith in Him alone. If we believe according to the Word that He makes righteous the unrighteous, and walk according to the law of the Holy Spirit with our minds, the work is carried out by the very same Spirit, sent by Him for this purpose, and thereby end all alienation and enmity between us and God, and all enmity between those who walk according to this, the Spirit of Truth.""

Thanks for bearing with me. V."
[T],verifire,2009-09-12T21:03Z,"@killlawife"": Wut what? Didn't you understand? If so, and i presume that's what ""wut"" means, perhaps it's because you are not perceptive  to the Word of God? Because you see; what I've written above is very clear and easy to understand, it just have to be received by someone who want to know something about the things I write about. If you're not able to ""decipher"" the above, but would like to, I can only tell you that if you really, really, want to, and won't give in until you do, the understanding will come to you. You see; this is so called supernatural, and involves the presence and will of God, if you want to get this.
His will is clear: He wants every person on earth to be saved and come into the realm of understanding the truth. All you have to do, is to want it, and perhaps pray to Him for understanding. That's never a bad idea, and you've got nothing to loose if you do, logically deducted. Whether you believe in Him or not, He might just believe in you, and then contact will be established. Trust me. 

All the best, V."
[V],neon,2009-09-13T00:19Z,hey verifire you need to download and watch this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5066986/The_Root_of_all_Evil_-_Richard_Dawkins__(2006)
[T],verifire,2009-09-13T01:06Z,"Hey, catsout: Why would I want to do that? Ive got access to loads of stuff by that man. You watch it, and read his books, and see where that gets you. Me, I haven't got the time for this ""genius"". I must spend it on other things and people. But thanks for the tip, I'm familiar with him..

And actually: If they could prove to me that Christianity is just a fake, I would nevertheless live like Christian, because it has transformed me into a happier, better person that I was. I nearly killed myself in my old life. I won't have to do that anymore. People like you will probably take care of that in due time.. He-heh..

[V],neon,2009-09-13T01:16Z,"Somewhere in the world a man has abducted a little girl. Soon he will rape, torture, and kill her. If an atrocity of this kind not occurring at precisely this moment, it will happen in a few hours, or days at most. Such is the confidence we can draw from the statistical laws that govern the lives of six billion human beings. The same statistics also suggest that this girl?s parents believe -- at this very moment -- that an all-powerful and all-loving God is watching over them and their family. Are they right to believe this? Is it good that they believe this?
No. 
The entirety of atheism is contained in this response. Atheism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply a refusal to deny the obvious. Unfortunately, we live in a world in which the obvious is overlooked as a matter of principle. The obvious must be observed and re-observed and argued for. This is a thankless job. It carries with it an aura of petulance and insensitivity. It is, moreover, a job that the atheist does not want.
It is worth noting that no one ever need identify himself as a non-astrologer or a non-alchemist. Consequently, we do not have words for people who deny the validity of these pseudo-disciplines. Likewise, ?atheism? is a term that should not even exist. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make when in the presence of religious dogma. The atheist is merely a person who believes that the 260 million Americans (eighty-seven percent of the population) who claim to ?never doubt the existence of God? should be obliged to present evidence for his existence -- and, indeed, for his benevolence, given the relentless destruction of innocent human beings we witness in the world each day. Only the atheist appreciates just how uncanny our situation is: most of us believe in a God that is every bit as specious as the gods of Mount Olympus; no person, whatever his or her qualifications, can seek public office in the United States without pretending to be certain that such a God exists; and much of what passes for public policy in our country conforms to religious taboos and superstitions appropriate to a medieval theocracy. Our circumstance is abject, indefensible, and terrifying. It would be hilarious if the stakes were not so high.
Consider: the city of New Orleans was recently destroyed by hurricane Katrina. At least a thousand people died, tens of thousands lost all their earthly possessions, and over a million have been displaced. It is safe to say that almost every person living in New Orleans at the moment Katrina struck believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, and compassionate God. But what was God doing while a hurricane laid waste to their city? Surely He heard the prayers of those elderly men and women who fled the rising waters for the safety of their attics, only to be slowly drowned there. These were people of faith. These were good men and women who had prayed throughout their lives. Only the atheist has the courage to admit the obvious: these poor people spent their lives in the company of an imaginary friend. 
Of course, there had been ample warning that a storm ?of biblical proportions? would strike New Orleans, and the human response to the ensuing disaster was tragically inept. But it was inept only by the light of science. Advance warning of Katrina?s path was wrested from mute Nature by meteorological calculations and satellite imagery. God told no one of his plans. Had the residents of New Orleans been content to rely on the beneficence of the Lord, they wouldn?t have known that a killer hurricane was bearing down upon them until they felt the first gusts of wind on their faces. And yet, a poll conducted by The Washington Post found that eighty percent of Katrina?s survivors claim that the event has only strengthened their faith in God.
As hurricane Katrina was devouring New Orleans, nearly a thousand Shiite pilgrims were trampled to death on a bridge in Iraq. There can be no doubt that these pilgrims believed mightily in the God of the Koran. Indeed, their lives were organized "
