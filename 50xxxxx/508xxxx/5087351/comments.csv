,JonYo,2009-09-14T02:43Z,"Doh!  I was about to track down my physical copy of that EBN-OZN record for KettBlack, but 80zforever beat me to it!  AEIOU Sometimes Y often sits in my head got days at a time quite comfortably the same way that Safety Dance by Men Without Hats sometimes does."

Thanks for your reply under the vol. 76.
Finally I founded by my self.... Long and hard way.... It's a band called Matterhorn Project and the song is called Muh!.

Do you have any CD/vinyl with Matterhorn project to share???  I hope so...

,blingpig,2009-09-26T05:38Z,Thanks 80z! You are still the hero to the eclectic connoisseurs of 80z music.

Can you please tell me the source of the BB Gabor? The artwork looks like a CD release, but I hear clicks and pops on the tracks which sounds more like a vinyl rip.

Thanks."
