,WWIIfan,2009-09-14T17:59Z,"do you know about avy good converting programs for vista/windos 7
some programs that don't make the convertet file larger,but still has a good quallity"
,unidentified2008,2009-09-15T00:26Z,"What a disappointment. Not this movie I mean, it's great...

But that my massive request list of around 50 times from a long time ago has hardly had any of the requests filled.

Good job encoding is not only for the elite and we can all do it for ourselves, each and every one of us!"
,unidentified2008,2009-09-15T00:28Z,"Btw to the person above, I've noticed The Godfather requested many times - I think I may have even requested it myself also...

...My suggestion, encode it yourself and it would've been done already!"
,britslovr,2009-09-15T06:23Z,When are you going to post the True Blood finale? I'm eagerly awaiting it
,mayhem09,2009-09-15T06:38Z,"I heard HolyRoses went on vacation to the Bahamas...

thats why there hasn't been any new up's lately.
so give the genius a break! =D"
,unidentified2008,2009-09-15T10:13Z,"While the conversions are very good quality, remember that it is a computer that is doing the converting, not HolyRoses. From what I can remember he was using standard available tools to do so and tweaking the settings, which he provides in the information. 

He also earlier provided the programs at an earlier stage to do the same, so the process is not so difficult. To do it yourself is easy. Just take the time to learn.

Maybe he is taking high end avi and converting (if there is some amazing upconvertor that is improving the quality and it would be interesting to know what that is) but some of the encodes are from BluRay rips as he states, hence the obvious better quality.

As I've said before, the conversions are good, but it's a disappointment that wants don't become filled - I didn't think mine were unreasonable but I see others have the same problem - so the solution is - encode them yourselves! :)"
,pommetje10,2009-09-15T20:03Z,"Some other requests:

,unidentified2008,2009-09-16T10:20Z,"""I did them already just haven't posted. Will post today sometime.""

The proof is in the pudding! :)"
,unidentified2008,2009-09-16T21:56Z,"...or should I say, the proof ""will be"" in the pudding!"
,unidentified2008,2009-09-17T16:16Z,"""I did them already just haven't posted. Will post today sometime.""

The proof ""will be"" in the pudding!

""idk what you are talking about...""

It means once we actually see them go up then we'll know they were already done. Until then the jury is out..."
,unidentified2008,2009-09-17T21:14Z,"...Done maybe yes.

Uploaded, it wouldn't appear so :)"
,unidentified2008,2009-09-18T10:41Z,"We must be talking about entirely different uploads then, as there doesn't seem to be any sudden resurgence of requests being upped despite many ppl asking.

Seems that blindness is affecting more than one party.

,unidentified2008,2009-09-18T14:53Z,"There ya go ppl, straight from the horse's mouth.

Hope everyone is reading!"
