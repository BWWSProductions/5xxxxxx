,Tripgnosis,2009-09-10T16:59Z,"Most of this album was very inspired by the styles of Daft punk, Fatboy Slim, and Moby. Infused with alot of Jazz/disco/house. 
I didn't include the track numbers in the file names, so the filenames would be technically out of the intended order, not that it matters much. 
The ID3 tags are complet with track numbers though."

I'm a huge fan of the chill atmosphere 4:20 Pm creates. 

Hopefully the rest of your stuff is as good. "
,lowpriest,2010-11-01T13:11Z,Hi! I want to check it out! When do you seed? IÂ´m in from Austria (concerning the time). How much time has it taken to get along with Acid 6.0? Is it very complicated? Cheers
