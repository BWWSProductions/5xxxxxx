***But the fact remains this is not the ACTUAL manufactured soundtrack/score etc. If you are looking for the great music and artist from the film like Motorhead or The Moody Blues then this torrent will have what you're looking for. As for the rest it's just recorded (low quality) scenes from the film itself. If you're a die hard fan of movie scores I wouldn't recommend this.
Keep looking>>>  :)"
