,lixivium,2009-09-11T14:06Z,80zforever THANK YOU!
,Phavonic,2009-09-11T17:27Z,"Thanks again for this, superfast download as well!

Regarding Bara Flokkurrin: yeah, they were strangely good for an unknwon village punk band. I couldn't recommend too many groups like them that you haven't already heard of. 

If you haven't already heard them then I recommend Peyr (Bowie meets Killing Joke meets Devo)

Most people think they should've made a bigger impact on a world scene for being so innovative. Check out ""As Above"", ""Fourth Reich"", and ""Lunaire"" particularly. Tah

,80scrazy,2009-09-12T23:36Z,"looking for Martin Briley's ""One Night With A Stranger"". Tried to download from another source....but got stuck @89.6%

Any chance you have it 80's?"

,Estlin,2009-09-13T21:02Z,@JettBlack9: I have Feeling Cavalier and should get around to uploading it before TPB ship goes down. It's an 80s gem. 
,bigcheef1,2009-10-10T09:16Z,"dude, you are amazing for adding all these unreal albums. I havent heard 99 percent of them.
I'm looking for portion control's early albums, any or all of them.  Have you seeded any of them?
I'm new to bit torrent, and have a lot of great music of my own to upload.
hope I can find those albums
thanks."
