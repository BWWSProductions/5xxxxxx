Most of the records I recently posted in these series were more focused on power pop/new wave/aor/rock style. Now part 77 is dedicated to some sweet but darker synthwave/electrowave records. Some of you guys might still remember David Harrow's coolest song "Our Little Girl" or dark and moody tone of Experimental Products's "Sweet Rejection"! Hope you like'em!
