Imlay an ancestor of mine ...knowing the men in my family I have often wondered if the this association ever influenced her in dipicting the monster ;)  ..again thank you so much! "
,Orion1986,2010-03-22T00:07Z,"This has to be incomplete. the book is over 200 pages and the total length of this is about 50 mins.
I checked on librivox, and they have a version that is far longer than this one. Id recommend just dl'ing it there instead of this. "
