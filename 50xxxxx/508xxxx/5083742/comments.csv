,tking0036,2009-09-11T02:59Z,Can I get a quality verification on this?
,PLnet,2009-09-13T21:14Z,"Confirm it's fine - same as the file downloaded from iTunes.
But why can't we update? iPod Touch isn't iPhone, so we can update now and wait for redsn0w to be released"
,Yoshimar,2009-09-14T20:25Z,"I've downloaded from itunes, trust me."
,nike0590,2010-06-03T00:22Z,Please seed :]
,AstroZombie87,2011-02-03T18:14Z,"Great download, worked like a charm. 

For those of you who don't know how to install. Go to your device in itunes, hold shift and left click on the restore button. It'll open a window to find the saved file you just downloaded, find it and presto. You're updated ;) "
