,Liet727,2011-06-22T20:27Z,"Maybe this is an isolated incident, but these files seem to be damaged (or something).  I'm using VLC and having trouble viewing these videos.  Each episode will skip back to the beginning at around the 30sec mark.  Additionaly, Episode 2 is completely unwatchable after about the 2min mark.

I want to believe this is something wrong on my end and not the torrent, so if anyone knows of a fix for this, please let me know.

PS: I encountered this same issue with one other torrent, and redownloading did not help.

Oh, and kudos to [D] for actually uploading this series.  Respect."
