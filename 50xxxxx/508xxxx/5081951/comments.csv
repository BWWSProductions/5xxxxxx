[V],big_dad_e,2009-09-08T11:17Z,It wasn't Glenn Beck it was Al Franken!
,booboo332,2009-09-08T12:38Z,"When this was first posted it clearly stated that it was a ""Glenn Beck Meme kit"" in both the title and the name of the torrent and encouraged people to join in the spreading of it.

From the file's new description:
""Did Glenn Beck Rape and Murder a Young Girl in 1990?""
""WE need an answer to this question, download, post everywhere.""

The pussy of a poster admits that he or she doesn't know and yet has posted a torrent that is designed to spread the impression that he is guilty.

I don't agree with Glenn on a lot of things and I think he can be a drama queen but this sort of abuse of freedom of speech is contemptible."
,booboo332,2009-09-08T12:42Z,"As a matter of fact, I just noticed that the poster forgot to remove the word ""meme"" from the Tags.  I imagine that will be edited soon enough as well.

This clearly wasn't posted by a very bright person."

,OttoBismark,2009-09-09T09:06Z,"Sometimes people upload to public trackers for one or two people, for individual reasons you may not comprehend and they will not tell you, and if anyone else wants it they can have it.
These comments are for technical details and validity of the said content, not your individual beliefs. Titles can be changed, sometimes to mock people, other times as a message. This is not a newspaper or a blog. 
Got to arguewitheveryone if you want to express your beliefs or opinion about whether Glenn Beck(or Al Franken) raped and murdered a young girl in 1990. "
,booboo332,2009-09-09T09:47Z,"Bullshit.  If this was meant for a few people, the entire torrent is small enough for email or r@pidsh@re.  This file is posted in the high profile TV section and is clearly trying to get noticed.  

The poster waffles between trying to ""uncover the truth"" and creating a meme.  Discovery of the truth or merely sharing files is clearly not their intent and I am merely calling them out on it.

Free speech is at the heart of this site but it is also a two way street.  The poster is free to post his or her duplicitous and slanderous garbage, I am free to say whatever the fuck I want about it and you are free to whine about it.

Piss off to Mininov@ or Dem0noid if you can't deal with it."
