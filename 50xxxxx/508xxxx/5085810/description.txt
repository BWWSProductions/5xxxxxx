Ever wondered what The Beatles' 1 (2000) would have sounded like without NoNoise, EQing and abusive compression ?

Here's something really basic I'm surprised to be the first to submit : the "one" tracklist, sourced from the new 2009 stereo remasters.

Obviously, no extra re-remastering was needed, no mess up... just the 27 tracks, ripped from my own box-set the right way (with EAC), compiled on a disc. They play just fine (volume/gaps are always consistent beetween tracks).

It's intended for either people new to the Beatles; or for people looking to have a good sounding Beatles' compilation record to play in their car !
