The game features over 40 World War II planes and online support for 16 players in Dogfight, Team Dogfight, Survivor, and Team Survivor game modes.

The sequel to the mighty World War II flight combat game Heroes of the Pacific, Heroes over Europe takes aspiring combat pilots into the bullet-ridden heart of major World War II European air battles in glorious, dogfight-friendly high definition. Heroes over Europe follows the Allied campaign from the attacks on London to the destruction of Berlin, with players under orders to strap themselves into the authentically rendered cockpits of the campaignâ€™s iconic aircraft. Their mission: to survive the most intense dogfights ever seen in a flight combat game.
