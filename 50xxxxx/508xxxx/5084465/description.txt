PLOT: My Life in Ruins is a romantic comedy film 

set amongst the ruins of ancient Greece, starring Nia Vardalos, 

Richard Dreyfuss, Alexis Georgoulis, Rachel Dratch, Harland 

Williams and British comedy actor and impressionist Alistair 

McGowan. The film is about a tour guide whose life takes a 

personal detour, while her group gets entangled in comic 

situations among the ruins, with a series of unexpected stops 

along the way.
Georgia (Nia Vardalos) is a Greek American tour guide who is 

leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit 

tourists who would rather buy a T-shirt than learn about 

history and culture. In a clash of personalities and cultures, 

everything seems to go wrong, until one day when older 

traveller Irv Gordon (Richard Dreyfuss), shows her how to have 

fun, and to take a good look at the last person she would ever 

expect to find love with: her Greek bus driver (Alexis 
Georgoulis).

NOTES:
This is a rip of an mpeg2 file ,now i received this as a 

screener...however i believe this might
be another rip of ppv movie......
The source......was fullscreen,borders all 

round,interlaced,lacked colour plus to bright with a slight 

flicker and has a very small water mark on the far right side of 

screen.
Audio was really good 



WORK DONE:
Cropped borders
Deinterlaced
Increased the contrast some and also adjusted the gamma,lum 

and chroma slightly. 



Yet another one of these hotel ppv movie rips...or screener whatever 

you want to call it. lol........ Overall 

based on a screener ppv rip.....V7.5-A8-M7......... Turned out 

way better than the original....Pretty nice and ok for what it is 

and will do until a r5 or rip gets
here .
