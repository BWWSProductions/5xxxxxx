,jackson122,2009-09-16T21:44Z,"This is not a copy of Wallanders celisten-it contains
some rubbish cooking programme from ch4 uk"
,jackson122,2009-09-17T01:07Z,"please ignore the comment above it does contain
cellisten, without english subtitles."
,cannibalvegetarian,2009-09-20T20:42Z,"Since you're Swedish I could expect you to know the importance of subtitles. Why do you not include them? The DVD has atleast Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish languages. That's the only thing the REDCROSS release betters.

End of ranting, yours is still the one to go for and I thank you for it :)"
,jackson122,2009-09-21T19:00Z,"hi-hej
