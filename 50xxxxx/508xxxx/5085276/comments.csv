Maybe it is a good suggestion to read first the comments, before you step into the open door......."
,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-09-12T18:07Z,"First of all, thanks Pamona!
@rodella, it really is not a good idea to post serial numbers in the comments, when they are already included in the torrent, as this often causes the S/Ns to be blacklisted...

Anyone having trouble registering this in Snow Leopard (Prefs win appears, but with no Divx pref pane visible) - go to /Library/PreferencePanes/DivX.prefPane and double-click it.  It will tell you that the PreferencePane already exists - re-install it.  Relaunch DivX player, select Extras -> DivX For Mac Registration.  This time Preferences will appear, with a message 'to use the DivX PreferencePane, preferences must quit and relaunch' - click OK, double-click the (now visible) DivX prefs, and complete your registration...(roll of drums, followed by Cymbal crash ;-)"

Sorry dude, but did you not look in the file: info.text?

And yes, all developers check TPB all the time, and S/Ns die daily because of incompetence!

How easy do you need it to be? It's all there...

pamona, I can only apologize for these (slightly) ignorant people who either can't read, or can't think..."

,pamona,2009-09-13T08:34Z,"@TGDr-aka-RG,
Thank you for your support. I was writing more or less the same comment, but also adding a deep excuse for not explaining how to open the file, how to look in it, how to open a serial-text, how to open the .dmg, and how to look in the menubar of the DivX-player, but I decided not to do so. Maybe the expression in my language ""you don't look into the mouth of a given horse"" would have been enough!"
,iphonerulez,2009-11-01T22:27Z,"Thanks for the download because it works fine in 10.5 Leopard, but this mofo sure doesn't work with 10.6 Snow Leopard.  Even the official DivX player doesn't work for me.  The DivX player just freezes on launch, so don't bother with it for 10.6."
