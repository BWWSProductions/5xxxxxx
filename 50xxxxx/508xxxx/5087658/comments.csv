,bren72,2009-09-14T11:53Z,Anyone know if this is better quality than DEViSE release and/or it has subtitles for the scenes DEViSE doesn't?
,mercutio44,2009-09-14T13:31Z,Great ! Thank's a lot
,whisky13,2009-09-14T13:54Z,"No, it is ""basterds"" you idiot. That's the movie title, look it up dipshit. and it's ""genius"", moron! I hate stupid people!"
,zylpher2,2009-09-14T15:11Z,"Bren, I have net even downloaded this torrent and can tell you it has the subs you are looking for."
,rens0000,2009-09-14T16:16Z,"Took me about 2 hours to download.
This is the first version I download so I dont know how the other cams look in comparison with this one.

All foreign languages are english hardcoded.
The quality is not so good. Colors are not balanced well, to bright or to dark.

In cam terms:
V: 6
A: 6

Thanks for the upload!!"
,paulo1966,2009-09-14T21:10Z,same shit cam!! dont waste your time
,meatnug,2009-09-14T21:12Z,"hey whisky,  he only wrote two words both spelled wrong and he was trying to correct someone elses spelling, does irony get anymore profound?"
,scottiemafia,2009-09-14T22:26Z,What an idoit!
,WilloW_22,2009-09-15T05:18Z,"v 6 a 7
picture is ok if u just wanna see the movie. voices are off just a little
ok copy for a cam"
,Logan_5,2009-09-15T19:40Z,"You guys are all a bunch of whiners who are complaining about this rips quality..

ALL Rips before they grow up to be DVDrip's are Cam's or maybe screeners... THEN after a while, they might grown in to R5's and THEN we'll finally get a good quality screener or R5...

A DVD quality rip with perfect audio and video will only happen after the DVD is close to being released..

As someone else has already said, it's good enough to watch as is so WATCH IT already and then grab the better quality release later for your collection..

90% of the bullshit posts could disappear if people realized that they are getting shit here for free and didn't have such unrealistic expectations of what they're getting for free..

'Cmon now, this fucking movie's still in the theatres so COMMON SENSE would tell you that it will NOT be Theatre Quality on TPB....yet.

V: 5.5 - Dark and out of focus in some places
A: 5.5 - Out of Sync and choppy in places

You get what you pay for here.... "
,scottiemafia,2009-09-16T01:31Z,"I just can't wait for a good version because my local cinema isn't showing this and I reeeeeeally want to see it.

Whining about the whiners makes you a whiner. Don't fucking patronise me."
,chiefs2,2009-09-16T09:03Z,"Unfortunately this is the same cam that's been going around since August with the dual Russian-Eng subs - with a few subtitle rearrangements in timing.
Voices are slightly out-of-sync in a few places as well. Not the worst one I've seen - but not the best either.
Fine for a 1st download, but if you've got one already - no need."
,mikeeee62,2009-09-16T17:06Z,hands up all those who think wiskey should be hung hands up . he is a prick
,eforce,2009-09-16T18:32Z,lol
,eforce,2009-09-16T18:33Z,too bad he's right
,chiefs2,2009-09-16T20:21Z,"Dam- think the R5 release date has been pushed backed to December for this.

Still think we can get a better cam/TS for this before then. "
,OGma59,2009-09-16T21:49Z,"hey, mikeeee62: you may feel that whiskey is a prick, but he can spell.  if quezi is going to call people stupid for improper spelling, maybe he should buy a dictionary or mayb read a book.  if english is his second language, mayb he should just refrain from speaking or writing it altogether. and you, mikeee62 should stop with the judgments, lest ye b judged, you may b familiar with the concept."
,HarleenQuinzel,2009-09-20T08:19Z,"Although sometimes i do some stupid stuff myself, i agree with whisky13, i also hate stupid people."
,e30cabrio,2009-09-21T11:31Z,quezicotl = obvious troll
,scottiemafia,2009-09-21T18:18Z,OGma what's your problem with the letter e?
,klvsa,2009-09-23T00:42Z,"Don't bother explaining complex tasks such as using a dictionary; ..reading; ..thinking before doing; doing onto others as you would want..... they won't understand. 
At the end of the day it's still too easy for children like mikeeee62 and quezicotl to type bullshit comments on their PC because no-one can reach through the screen and bitch-slap the little pricks. "
,infocom4ever,2009-09-24T22:26Z,"mininova have the original(...bastards 1978 BRRip) and its much better then this bland #é€ %%""% even if brad or terrantino is on the bill. Please dont dl  the file dubbed with that russian asshole that reads all lines in the same indiffferent tone and maimes the entire movie.  "
,sentient1,2009-09-25T03:15Z,"@northmonkeyboy

So you're mad about people swearing here, yet you tell them ""fuck off"" ??? 

I'm with Whisky13.... I hate you for your stupidity!"
,Remix4357,2009-09-25T08:53Z,"quezicotl, for someone who can't even spell their username correctly (quetzalcoatl), I doubt you should be attempting to correct the spelling others use. 

fact of the matter is, Tarantino spelled his movie Inglourious Basterds to differentiate it from the other, similar but unrelated, Italian film Inglorious Bastards. Also, the misspelling is the same way that Aldo spelled Inglourious Basterds in writing on his rifle.

QED motherfucker"
,stj69,2009-09-26T22:27Z,Why complain about something you are getting for free just because you didnt like the quality???????? if that is the case then plz gtfo TPB

Did I miss something or is my computer screwed up?"
,snowbirds,2009-10-04T05:46Z,"God, I'm so tired of all the angry, hateful insults on every comments page on the PB.

People cursing out the uploader, then other people cursing out the people cursing out the uploader, and then people cursing out all the people cursing other people out...

Maybe getting everything for free is having a bad effect on people's minds?  It sure seems like the PB is becoming full of spoiled, whining and hateful people. "
,theoquda,2009-10-05T00:04Z,"A:5
V:4
The video is unwatchable. The movie is god so it deserves to wait a couple of weeks for an R5 to come."
,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-08T13:52Z,"i think,

that SOMEONE would see the meteor coming, and as well,  it would have to be pretty large to make it through the earth's atmosphere with the size to crush half of someones house, so, it definitely would be seen.

so, dont be stupid ^_^"

[T],zombifuzz,2009-10-23T15:03Z,this guy is a fake.  he is on mininova and he spams almost all the time.  he also steals other peoples work and calls it his own.  he was swearing and being ignorant and got almost all his torrents taken off mininova.  do not DL from this guy.  there are plenty of other people worthy of DLing from.  save yourself alot of time because if you Dl from this user you will be VERY disappointed.
,worldnick,2009-10-24T18:22Z,This movie is shit.  The reason is that more has happened to non-jewish people that jewish people.  They act like they are the only people who have ever been persecuted.
