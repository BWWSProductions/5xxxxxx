,Sillysauce,2009-11-01T21:15Z,"Ok, did anyone succeed in installing this?

And HOW??

Moved the bink file about 10 times bu no luck in running the game.."
,Sillysauce,2009-11-02T02:37Z,"Yay!! Found the mistake;

I thought this needed a separate folder in the Project Origin installation folder, but it didn't.
Once I installed it as an addition to the Project Origin-installation, I found Reborn in the Main Menu.
The bink-problem disappeared cause the .dll-file was already there in the first place.

Thanks for the UP!!"
