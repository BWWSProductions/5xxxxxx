,JebusKryst,2009-09-16T18:20Z,FFS - Seed please!!!
[T],kukamonga,2009-09-16T18:38Z,"JebusKryst: I'm seeding right now, at 30Kb/s... It's a very recent torrent, so it needs sometime before spreading, you should know that, if you're dealing with torrents... What about YOU sharing something before complaining?"
,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:20Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.

Thanks for this torrent! Will seed."
