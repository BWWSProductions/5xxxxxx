In Biology: The Science of Life, gain the background and guidance to explore in depth the fundamental principles of how living things workâ€”principles such as evolution by natural selection, the cellular structure of organisms, the DNA theory of inheritance, and other key ideas that will help you appreciate the marvelous diversity and complexity of life. Taught by award-winning Professor Stephen Nowicki, these 72 lectures take you through living systems at all levels, from biological molecules to global ecosystems. Along the way, you gain insights into some of the most pressing scientific questions facing society.
