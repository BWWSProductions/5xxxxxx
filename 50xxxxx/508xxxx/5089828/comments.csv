Use «Install Lightroom 2.5.exe» to install the program.
Start the program and copy & paste any key from «serials.txt» (open with notepad).
Do not register and uncheck «Auto check for updates»."

I am using Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit version. Which file should I use, setup64.exe or Install Photoshop Lightroom 2.5.exe?

Thx in advance and sorry if this is a nuisance."
,nicegt94,2010-01-16T21:07Z,"Is anyone having any problems with this?? Maybe someone can help me. I installed it and it seems to be working fine, it edits the pics just fine but when I click on Print in the upper right hand corner a window pops up and says it has encountered a problem and needs to close. I have uninstalled and re-installed and that did not fix it. If anyone can help please let me know. Thanks"

,mabus6277,2010-04-20T02:44Z,"Im getting the same problem as o-max. Each time i open lightroom it asks for a serial, the same serial will work each time, but theres the problem of the trial running out. I previously had lightroom, but i used up the trial, and up until yesterday, i couldn't use it any more. Im wondering if me having had lightroom previously may affect this at all?"
