I guess that makes 3 of us.  Gotta love Stumble Upon.  Hope this is as good as it was made out to be.

Thanks blowley for the upload!"

,Scientography,2012-03-02T00:49Z,"Hey blowley, thanks for sharing.  This is an unusual request, but could you post your own movie recommendations for other similar movies in the description of movies you upload?  IMDB isn't always good at this and you probably watch a lot of movies so you know which ones are good. Thanks :)"
