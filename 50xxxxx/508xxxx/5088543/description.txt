Syaoran is a childhood friend of the kingdom's princess Sakura. He works as an archeologist at the ruins just outside of the city. One night, when Syaoran was working at the ruins, Sakura was lured there by a strange light. Sakura is acting really strange, and suddenly grows wings. As Sakura is almost vanishing into the wall, Syaoran is able to reach to her and her wings shatter in feathers. Those wings were her heart, en without them Sakura is just an empty shell without memories and the feathers have drifted to different worlds. Syaoran and Sakura are sent to the Dimensional Witch, where he meets Fye, a wizard, and Kurogane, a swordsman. They want to go back to their own world, but they can only travel to a random world at a time, so they decide to travel together.
