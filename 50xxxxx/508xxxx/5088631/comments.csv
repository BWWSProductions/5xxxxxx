,archang3l,2009-09-14T17:01Z,"This may seem like a stupid question, but is this the final release version?"
[T],Knaster,2009-09-14T21:39Z,This may seem like a stupid question but.......Is it swedish subtitles in it? Im blind you see.
,franky98,2009-09-15T00:23Z,"I'm stuck in the PUMP ROOM where you need to disable the last two pumps, its 50% in the game. i cant graple back up to the door, the grapply icon shows on the ground insted of where it should, and it takes me under the map wish sets you block and cant play. anyone has the same problem? i already tryed with this new crack but same problem."
,susscon,2009-09-15T02:18Z,"hi i downloaded this already of another tracker, but cant save...
has the save feature been made available on this download?

p.s. thanx for the upload in advance :o)"
,spigadoro,2009-09-15T08:04Z,this version does not have physx there will most likely to be a patch that comes out in a few days that enables it so if you have the p2p version just get the new crack 
,andy72184,2009-09-15T08:32Z,It better have physics or I will kill someone.  Its always something I tell you.
,susscon,2009-09-15T09:11Z,"forget my last comment, i found the patch for saving, also it fixes the glide bug for the download version...
the physx works but you have to set it yourself by...
Browse to directory  C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config 

Open UserEngine.ini file with a text editor such as Notepad. 

Change the line PhysXLevel=0 so that it reads PhysXLevel=1 

Save and close the file. Run the game

works 100% and also tried it with 3D vision."
[T],Beebe85,2009-09-15T14:54Z,"There are no video options, how do you enable them, the game plays and saves so far."
[T],Beebe85,2009-09-15T15:18Z,OK I see it
,minutertill,2009-09-15T16:28Z,Anyone successfully fixed the glide problem?

It will only works for 20% of who have the game ""BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM"".....This is a collection of comments/complates over net  



 1.  Extract Batman.Arkham.Asylum.FullRip-KaOs

 2.  Install Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs (I think it not necessary)

 3.  You need .Net Frame Work1 Service Pack 1 (I think it not necessary)

 4.  You need .Net Frame Work2 Service Pack 1

 5.  You need .Net Frame Work3 Service Pack 1 

 6.  You need .Net Frame Work3.5 Service Pack 1

 7.  Update your directx

 8.  Move ""My Documents"" from C:\Dcuments and settings\.... to D:\Documents.

 9.  Install Games for windows by ""gfwlivesetupmin.exe""

 10. Copy ""msvcr70.dll"" to C:\windows\system\ and make the file into hidden and read-only.Some times its virus.

 12. Update your video card driver (I think it not necessary)

 13. If you want to enable PhysX, Change the ""PhysXLevel=0"" to ""PhysXLevel=1"" in the 
     file E:\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\BmEngine.ini

 14. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT! (Even, I am not garantee about working)

 15. If you installed PowerDvD, its process may will affect the game (I think it not necessary)

 And enjoy you're game !
