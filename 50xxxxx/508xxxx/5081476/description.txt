Storyline: The playboy wolf and genius Tony Stark is the successful CIO of the Stark Industries, 
a weapon company founded by his father. His second in command is Obadiah Stane, who worked with his father, and his loyal and professional 
secretary is Pepper Potts, who has a crush on Tony. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate the ultimate Jericho missile developed by his 
company, his military convoy is attacked and Tony is seriously wounded on his chest and kidnapped by a group of rebels that wants him to 
assemble a missile for their use. Tony stays with his abductors for three months and develops a powerful metallic armor to escape from 
the cave where he is arrested. He decides to stop manufacturing weapons in his company under the protest of Obadiah, and dedicates his 
time to improve the armor, manufacturing it with gold and titanium and installing a propulsion system to fly. However, Pepper discovers
