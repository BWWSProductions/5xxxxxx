The Brandenburgers were members of the Brandenburg German commando unit during World War II.
Units of Brandenburgers operated in almost all fronts - the invasions of Poland, Denmark and Norway, in the Battle of France, in Operation Barbarossa, in Finland, Greece and the invasion of Crete, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Some units were sent to infiltrate India, Afghanistan, Middle East countries and South Africa. They also trained for Operation Felix, the planned seizure of Gibraltar, and Operation Sealion. The unit had stunning successes early in the war acting as advance units that captured strategic bridges, tunnels and rail yards in Poland and the Netherlands.
