,kutedude81,2009-09-17T15:38Z,can anyone tell me how i can burn this? I tried VSO ConvertXtoDVD and it fails all the time. 
,deltazulu,2009-09-18T00:35Z,should be no need to convert it. it should burn like any dvd. nero. convertx is for conversions.
,jb99,2009-09-18T18:55Z,kdude if you just select write data in cx it should work fine or you can use dvdfab.
,kutedude81,2009-09-18T21:19Z,"i have tried with VSO....i know there is no need to convert, so i choose the BURN ALREADY EXSISTING and it starts to burn, but fails at 1 percent. ill try DVDFAB and see how that goes...."
,kutedude81,2009-09-18T22:50Z,nope...didnt work either. keeps failing...
[T],hjsn1,2009-09-19T01:03Z,Download ImgBurn or DVD Decrypter. Its a lot easier to use from what I hear. ImgBurn is going to be easier to find.

,melfn,2010-01-08T06:01Z,"Great Upload, Thank you very much and keep up the good work, going to download more of your uploads soon :)

From Venezuela thank you!"
,melfn,2010-01-08T21:17Z,"Everything is great, just one observation is that there is one extra spanish subtitle with no subtitle. Don't know if its my fault but if you check the dvd and click on the subtitle button on your control there is two spanish subtitles but the second has no information but other than that which doesn't take away from the quality of the upload its great.  Thank you for the upload :)"
,R1ch1e778,2010-01-29T06:48Z,"Hi, I have an iPod touch 3G and I was wondering If i could put it onto my ipod? I know how to do that (put it into one video and shrink the format) but I was wondering if you could tell me which one of the VTS... etc... (all the files I can download now), is the actual movie I need to download.. I only want the video in english, i dont see why its necessary to have to so many different files...

thanks"
,R1ch1e778,2010-01-29T22:08Z,"sorry what im trying to say is. there is 4gigs of stuff there, all I want is the movie in english.. no menus.. one movie"

,theblade180,2011-05-06T17:56Z,"Okay, so I downloaded it, opened it, and there was like 100 files, 50 movie files, and 50 non movie files. What the hell? Obviously something's wrong with my computer because nobody else seems to hve the same problem...Can somebody help me out?"
,Sharing_Is_Loving,2011-07-23T08:08Z,"Thanks mate.  The audio was low but I was able to boost it in Win 7 by opening 'speakers properties', 'enhancements', 'loudness equalisation'.

theblade180:  Just click on the first VLC file (VIDEO_TS, 178kb) and it starts the movie at the main menu.  Play or select a different language from there."
