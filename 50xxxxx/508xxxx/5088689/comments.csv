,sinux12,2009-09-16T16:40Z,Guys I know about the speed it's very slow I'm using my office connection to seed this so some times I've stop the upload when other are working but when no one is there I'm using the full bandwidth to seed please bear with me.

I was wondering if you can separate and upload the crack. I'm looking for a time bomb deactivator for win7rc1, but I don't want to leech the entire iso just to do it."
