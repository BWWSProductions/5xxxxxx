  |   You've always wanted to build your own Monster - and now's your       |
  |   chance! Your hometown of Happy Valley is constantly under attack, and |
  |   the best defense is to have your very own Monster ready to defend it. |
  |   Raise, train, and care for your Monster. You'll have to watch over its| 
  |   care delicately, because the safety of your friends and family depend |
  |   on your training. Oh - don't forget, it's tough to care for a Monster |
  |   bigger than your house, so be prepared. You can take your Monster into|
  |   the lab for wild and crazy customizations. And each battle,           |
  |   experiment, and tonic can change your Monster's attributes, like      |
  |   strength, speed, and abilities!                                       |
