This is a XviD rip from a DVD I found in the dust bin and I thought that I would upload it and see if any other Eagles fans found it interesting. It is a 1973 BBC concert with Glen Frey, Bernie Leadon, Don Henley, and Randy Meisner. 

Song List:

1. Train Leaves Here This Morning
2. Saturday Night
3. Peaceful Easy Feeling
4. Certain Kind Of Fool 
5. Earlybird
6. Witchy Woman
7. Take It Easy
