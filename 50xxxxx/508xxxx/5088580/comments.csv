I recently downloaded a few rips from 2006 and the general standard was better then than it is now. Porn should NEVER be ripped at < 1300 kbps or the picture goes to hell as soon as the fucking gets going. No disrespect to NYMPHO, as they put in a lot of work, but people can do better than this... DivX and XVID have come a long way in the last few years, but you wouldn't know it to look at some of the rubbish that has been posted recently."
