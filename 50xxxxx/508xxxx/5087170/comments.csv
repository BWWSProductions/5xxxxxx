,nambinhvu,2010-04-19T03:49Z,"I'm not sure if you can do this with all torren downloaders, but with limewire you can choose which files to download from the torrents.  I downloaded a bunch of episodes and found out that episode 102 from the torrent I downloaded had the wrong sound track matched with it.  So I'm downloading episode 102 from yours with limewire and leaving the rest.  Thanks :)"

I haven't completed the download yet but I have a good feeling about this torrent.
From completed episodes I'd say audio and video is great with the rating of V-8/A-7.(good for animation)
From first season episode 1-27 all are in english"
