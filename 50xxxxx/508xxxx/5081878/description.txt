 Benjy at Comicon Teaser
               
    * Howard takes a look at Benjy and Richard's appearance at the Comicon
      convention where he dresses up as "Ben-She" and starts a commotion
      in the screener room for 'Wolverine The Game'.  Benjy and Richard end
      up getting kicked out and he screams like a woman which became the
      sound effect that Fred always plays.  Benjy and Richard at Comicon
      airs at the end of October.
