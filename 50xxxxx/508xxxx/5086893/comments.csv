,DarkZuL,2009-10-08T04:08Z,"Thanks Murlok!
Too bad the program is a bit strict when selecting export resolution.
I wish i could type the exact resolution i want, instead of selecting predefined options."
,noekk,2009-10-19T06:35Z,Is this legitimate ? Does it have a serial or a keygen ?
,kelokata,2009-10-19T18:31Z,"Hi Murlok!
Have not yet build 2207 ? That seems to have appeared this build.Can you find and we put to Pirate Bay.Thanks."

,Breyvan,2009-11-18T02:45Z,"This works great thanks, installed it as the ultra version, thanks a lot :D"
,devilthroe,2009-12-03T03:49Z,its my 1st time to register here just to tell that avast home edition detected trojan in keygen...
,twinkle123321,2009-12-03T18:23Z,Has to install quicktime... :(
,missy_belle,2009-12-11T06:51Z,"Thanks Murlok...Works perfectly! 

Note to others on Vista I had a problem installing the SmartSound which didnt want to install. I just killed the session in task manager, and then PowerDirector completed installation. Created a keygen, started the program, and copied and pasted. "
,Xaphan377,2009-12-12T02:07Z,Confirmed this keygen has a Trojan Horse
,geomon1,2009-12-30T22:42Z,Virus scanner also detected a trojan horse
,Fazzmania,2010-01-13T14:57Z,"Wow it's incredible how many users on TPB don't have the slightest clue about program structure. Everyone with a brain knows that keygens /often/ give false virus positives, based on the nature of the design. It's not a virus, deal with it."
,TheNameless23,2010-01-26T16:57Z,"Great torrent 
but I have so many problem with the software
when I try to Enhance/fix the clips the program just stop working ...
I think it doesn't work well with windows 7 ...
anyone else got the same problem ?"
,dgei58,2010-03-08T02:26Z,Thanks a lot for this. It works great on Windows (sucking) 7. As soon as I have the $ I plan on buying this program. It's sweet! 
,BradKITZ,2010-03-23T15:18Z,how do you register this thing ........ It seems to be running as the trial version ...... Great Upload ..... Thanks in advance .........
,KINTEKLA,2010-05-12T22:19Z,"@ TheNameless23:

yeah, i get the same problem.  i get into a project then all of sudden it ""freezes"" and the windows 7 shuts it down.  

i even save the projects a lot but when i open them, media files are corrupt.  

either way, thanks the torrent"
,nuggz,2010-05-19T02:12Z,"@KINTEKLA-- ""i even save the projects a lot but when i open them, media files are corrupt. ""

One think I've noticed about this is when you move the files from the original folder to a different one, then point powerdirector to the new folder with the files in it, it seems to corrupt the files. A workaround would be to place your files in their permanent resting spot before you start editing. Hope this helps."
,MrSketchtastic,2010-05-22T22:12Z,dgei58   are u stupid.. when u get the money you will buy it ...wtf do u think the pirate bay is for..you downloading it for free now dumbass

,hi182,2010-08-09T16:13Z,hey does the keygen have a virus or not?
[V],froggie100,2010-10-21T18:11Z,"it is clean works fine thnxs m8 :)

,AsTroNoMiCal676,2010-10-21T21:00Z,"It won't let me open the program anymore.  I was using it, saved, and shut down for the day. and now i can't open the program.  nothing happens when i click the icon.  any suggestions? "
,aaron1046,2010-11-03T05:44Z,"Get an error when I run it after installing.

,CTPAX2,2010-11-20T15:01Z,"I'm kind a choosing what video editor to download. I've seen a lot of positive feedback on CL PD. But I've heard that 9th version is out. Why there is none to download, only 8?"
,Rikplay,2010-11-26T16:20Z,Installed fine on windows 7 although it did give me an error the first time. when i installed i was not asked for any kind of registration or serial and when i check it seems to be running in trial but it does not seem to watermark the movies i produce or anything like that. I did have powerdirector 7 installed previously so this may be why i was not asked any info at start. thansk for the upload.
,Rikplay,2010-12-01T20:21Z,"After 5 days of making movies it has become slightly unstable crashing regularly. Im now installing build 3022 also from murlok, Thanks murlok. "
,lievenazerty,2010-12-13T21:16Z,A keygen/crack is supposed to be a virus how can it crack the program otherwise... people these days
,blackxino,2010-12-31T23:26Z,"fuck this man!

powerdirector 8 is just like PD 7 but with more features.

I tried to open a project I saved from PD7 and PD 8 just crashes when it's loading half of the files.

I'm gonna try PD 9 and I swear down if that is not relaible, I'm gonna use other programs cuz I'm tried of the Cyberlink series!"
