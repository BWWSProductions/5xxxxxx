,DACSTER,2009-09-06T20:18Z,thanks for puting Earth on your list Jason. Im glad to see you back on TB 
[T],hjsn1,2009-09-06T21:42Z,DACSTER: I just replied to you on djfreds upload. Not a problem. I'm glad to be back. If I couldn't get back on here I might've stopped uploading altogether. At the other site I was hardly getting anybody downloading from me and it didn't seem worth it. 
,DACSTER,2009-09-07T06:44Z,"I did see it thanks alot for puting it up next week. As for that other site im not a big fan of it for movie but it's not bad for music . No one knew where you went untill fred told us what happened to you. It might of taken a couple of weeks untill we all found you. Lets face it theirs not alot of good uploaders of NTSC DVD-R movies, and your's are great quality . And between you , djfred , and TwiztidxxNinja i always know theirs something good to download . 
ps. im looking for a new computer, what kind do you have and do you like it , do you have any ideas i think im leaning towards an HP Media Center i want something thats got some power to it so i can multitask . LOL"
