Ex-con Jack Crews, who works as car mechanic in New Jersey since he's out and enjoys being a good husband and father to his daughter, refused to do it as his license was suspended, but when he finds the bank is about to foreclose on his house, he has no other choice then accept $10,000 for one truck ride all the way from Atlanta. He doesn't want to know about the load, but guesses right as it comes with a black dog, spare driver and two men 'protection' in a car that his long ride is about to turn into a mobile battle fought with vehicles and bullets for the illegal arms shipment which the FBI is after too while Red, who sent the load in the first place, turns out to head a gang which stops at nothing to get them delivered. And then there's the legend of the ominous black dog...
