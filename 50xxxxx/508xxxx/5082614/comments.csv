,thebadoliver,2009-09-15T00:06Z,"this is my torrent, there is NO password.

If you're asked for a password, next time don't download your stuff in a sub/sub/sub/sub/sub/sub/sub-with-a-long-name/sub/subfolder.

Otherwise, rename the zips to a shorter name, extract again, and this time, TADAA, no password will be requested.

Sigh, does that STILL need to be explained in 2009 ?"
