,samljer,2011-06-03T08:47Z,"@Gamerguuy

Region free doesnt mean NTSC/PAL
you shouldnt get mad at people who ask.


There is several NTSC regions
NTSC/J   NTSC/U   NTSC/China 
and same with PAL.

To ask if its NTSC is a legit question
no matter how many times you wrote region free, so check yourself."
,samljer,2011-06-03T08:48Z,"Oh and for the guy who asked
its PAL-RF
it wont run on NTSC consoles."
