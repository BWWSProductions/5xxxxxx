,TyMod,2011-09-27T00:21Z,"HOW TO PATCH THE GAME:

A. Download the patch from http://www.fileplanet.com/207434/download/Section-8-Patch-v1.1-(Retail)

B. Because Skidrow doesn't understand what a retail disc looks like, the patch will give you an error if you try to run it as is.  SO: take the patch and move it to the Section 8 directory.

C. Run the patch.  It will give you a error about REgistry missing or whatever, just hit ok.

D. It will then ask you to select the directory (just hit ok, skidrow got that part right.

E. Let it install, then when it is don goto gamecopyworld.com and download the latest crack.

All set, your welcome.

,TyMod,2011-09-27T00:28Z,"Also you will most likely get a error saying ""Old file not found. However, a file of the same name was found. No update done since file contents do not match."" If you get this goto the file it says its missing, and there should be two copies, switch the files so that the copy becomes the main file and the original main file becomes the copy.

Hope this helps everyone."
,NicolasBalan,2011-10-03T13:55Z,"@TyMod regarding the:  ""Old file not found. However, a file of the same name was found. No update done since file contents do not match.""  The question is: how can I locate this file ""Old file""? Where I can find 'it? I browsed through all the folders, I couldn't find anything. Thank you in advance."
,TyMod,2011-11-24T03:49Z,"Sorry for such a late answer.  When the patch is installing the files it will tell you the file and directory as it is extracting.  Thats all.

I came back to the page because I never got the game to work right and decided to reinstall it and I wanted to see if anyone got it to work right."
,epHesTus,2011-11-26T15:00Z,"@TyMod Now, can you explain a bit more? So, basicaly if I'm updating and get that error, I need to check updater to see which files are old or whatever? Done. It showed s8.exe at that time, but I have only seen one s8.exe in the folder of the game. Be more specific please, where to look, what to look? Ok?"
