RLS NOTES:

Due to the nature and native

format/rez of the source it exceeds the normal 1.333 AR

which has led us to making our release 512x352 to maintain

the quality without unnatural AR/REZ alterations



Pleaders, It's one thing is to steal our source and label it your own

It's another thing entirely taking it without asking, This goes to all

Other Language Ruleset's you can say take the best source, but in our

book thats stealing, we see it happening all the time with other groups

content as well. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves. Grow up
