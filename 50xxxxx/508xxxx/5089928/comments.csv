,Spikey00,2009-09-23T04:58Z,"Working on Ultimate x64, no problems at all.

A pleasant but familiar experience comparable to the original Zuma(s).


However, the only downside is that"
,Spikey00,2009-09-23T05:01Z,"(Unintentional submission of incomplete comment)

**the downside is that the lazy way of copy and pasting the game files onto a flash drive/etc. does not work, unfortunately.  


Otherwise a great upload--I appreciate it."

,Incoming,2009-09-28T04:45Z,"Trying to run this in Windows Vista Ultimate with every driver and supporting application up-to-date. Immediately upon launching the game I get a message telling me that the application has stopped working. No luck in compatibility-mode either. And I pass the sys.requirements by far. Any ideas? / And thanks for the upload, even though I can't enjoy it."

,NoelVance,2010-02-13T09:40Z,"this game works if you have XP. there IS a virus in this. a vista internet security viras, that will overwrite everything. the virus only affects vista. i downloaded it to my XP and it worked perfectly. i downloaded it for my dad on his vista and it fucked that computer horribly. so all in all, XP you re safe, Vista or higher fuckin forget it."
,alkabirj,2010-02-16T08:22Z,"XP users: DO NOT DOWNLOAD! It messes up your Hardware Digital Signature which means all your hardware including processor and mass storage will be detected as UNSIGNED and UNVERIFIED including all plug and play hardware like flash drive, etc. The trojan activates at random times (days or months after it had infected your pc). Had to do a clean install after this happened to me. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"
