I love it, it's little more complicated than windows, but once you get right it's almost flawless. Visual effects are much better than Windows 7 even! You can easily dual boot by giving some space on your harddrive away. 

try it   http://www.linuxmint.com/    Tell me what you think"

They are all very good but, Linux Mint 7 just seemed like a breeze to get going."
