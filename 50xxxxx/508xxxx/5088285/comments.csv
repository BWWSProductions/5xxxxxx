,BeingEricaTorrent,2011-01-28T23:02Z,"Hi! Thank you very much for this torrent. I have one issue (I only got this to make DVDs with menus) is that whenever I try to load videos on Nero Vision it stops working and shuts down because it has ""compatibily issues"". I'm running vista. I'm not too techy so maybe I've missed something?
Thanks, Nicola."
