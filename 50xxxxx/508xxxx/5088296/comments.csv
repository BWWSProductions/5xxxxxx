,cornflk,2009-10-27T18:24Z,"When you open the disk image, Finder warns you there's a problem with the image and could make your computer less secure if you open it.  What's that about?"
,Rickko,2009-11-25T07:57Z,Same warning here ! Is it safe ? Someone who has tried can confirm.
,mojopanel,2009-12-19T14:43Z,What about the 1.0.1 update?
,Tragedy773,2010-01-08T14:17Z,Works perfectly. No warning or something else. Thx

,xvader,2010-03-09T04:28Z,"works perfectly as i want!

,Thetruesong,2010-05-02T09:35Z,"Absolutely amazing, one of the best things i've ever torrented. The torrent took about 5 minutes, i installed Camtasia, i opened up the patch, i dragged the Camtasia icon onto the the patch and everything went smoothly. Perfect! 10/10"
,sbphoto,2010-07-30T00:32Z,"Great torrent, 9/10... downloaded fast (about 20 min)

However - one problem I noticed: when rendering for high def, can't output Mp4 files greater than 354x288... in other words, Hi-def output appears to be suppressed. :-(  anyone know a work-around?"
,Wouto1997,2010-10-10T14:40Z,Tnx
,Meko_,2011-01-23T02:36Z,"The trial expired now it's not letting me use it.  I redid the patch and it opens but it does not let me record.  and by the way, every time I install it gives me all the warnings, but that's just the computer trying to warn you. click ok and tell your computer you want to open it. 

I think I did it wrong. The download should have included a text file with instructions like everything else. 

but what the hec. Now I have to figure out how to delete the app and the preferences to install it correctly. I got 3 recordings in tho... and they were HD. 

I'll come back and post if I'm successful after re-installing. "
,Meko_,2011-01-23T03:02Z,"nope, I can't get it to work again. It only worked during the trial. It opens but it wont let me record. It keeps telling me to register. "
,nieco,2011-02-24T17:56Z,"it worked, it was patched and all, but then it kinda stopped and says i need to buy it and shit. how do i uninstall it?
cheers"
,blada2011,2011-04-05T22:03Z,"you must change the date for exemple : 26/11/2010
have fun !!!"
,Ablekain,2011-06-24T13:53Z,Nope. Trial expired. Not working .Change the date??? 
,remicornelissen,2011-07-12T17:28Z,"The software is working fine, but I do have one problem. Like... Today... From the 43 minutes which I record, Camtasia makes a video of only the first 9 minutes and 32 seconds! So not the whole recording!
In the complete 43 minutes which I want to record, my laptop is getting filled with megabites (so until I press the 'stop recording' button), so you would expect that Camtasia makes a video of the complete 43 minutes, but sadly this is not what happened.
Does anyone know how to fix this? Any help would be appreciated, thank you."
,SilentControlx,2011-11-02T13:04Z,Black recording!! help?
,greenpoint,2012-01-20T01:28Z,"***This version does not work with Lion. That's why I was getting the black screen when I attempted to record. For others still being asked to enter a serial, you probably did not drag the application into the patch correctly. After installing, drag camtasia into the applications folder, then drag it into the provided patch. "
,BulliBob,2012-03-25T04:04Z,"Cannot get it to work, except in Trial mode! Drag the app on to the patch, you say? This only creates an alias - pretty useless, if you ask me - it might be ""complete"" with ""k"" but it still doesn't work ...

sigh"
,treekixx1,2012-04-23T22:11Z,"Everything worked on install and patch but does not record the screen... i did a test record and it came up black, not blank, black... i could see my mouse and hear myself narrating. I have OSX Lion 10.7.2 now i know that it doesn't work in lion so i updated it to camtasia:mac 1.2.2 and now it asked me for serial... does anyone have the serial? or a patch for 1.2.2... the same patch does work...."
,rik.star,2012-05-06T19:45Z,it is asking for registration key after 30 days. Please help!!!
