Bear with me at first, not the fastest connection here."
,RazzielDL,2009-09-09T05:13Z,"Legit, good quality and for the amount of seeders it goes fast enough."
,Ycarcomed,2009-09-09T05:38Z,"It works, average 250kb/s. I'll seed until I'm at like 100/1 ratio."
,Faraday90,2009-09-09T08:42Z,Super quick download. I'll comment on the legitimacy momentarily.
,Faraday90,2009-09-09T08:45Z,"Yep, this is the real deal. Good sound quality, cover art intact, all is good."
,bebster,2009-09-09T14:26Z,"I have this uploaded (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5083137). This guy isn't seeding, so please go download mine and seed it (I have slow internets)."
,vberg,2009-09-10T00:12Z,"I'm sure you've commented in the wrong torrent.
I'm still seeding and have uploaded the cd a full 25 times now.
475 seeds on this torrent currently.  (Why isn't TPB reporting seeds/peers properly?)"
