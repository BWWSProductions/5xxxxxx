,shadow1a,2009-09-09T23:21Z,"I've stopped seeding this with a 5:1 ratio.TPB says no seeds, no peers. There have been no comments for my last 5 or 6 uploads so I figure why bother. The Bay shows 0's everywhere all the time. There are so many fakes and just as many complainers that uploading and seeding isn't worth it anymore.Yes everythind is free here but at Netflix or Blockbuster I know exactly what I'm getting.

Thanks to the few who have been helpful!"
