00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:36,708
Cold this morning, Captain.

2
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,408
Cold.

3
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:00,608
And hard.

4
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,808
It's time, Captain...

5
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:25,608
It's time.

6
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:28,808
Time indeed.

7
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:05,908
Time to open the orders, sir.

8
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:08,408
The Political Officer...

9
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:11,108
...is in your cabin.

10
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,208
Very well.

11
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,908
You have the con.

12
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,008
What are you doing?

13
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:44,308
I must oversee the stability
of the crew, Captain.

14
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:48,908
By invading my privacy?

15
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:55,108
Privacy is not of major concern
in the Soviet Union, comrade.

16
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:58,808
It's often contrary to the collective good.

17
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:07,608
""Behold, I am coming as a thief...

18
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,608
""And they gathered them together

19
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:16,408
""in a place called Armageddon.""

20
01:52:53,608 --> 01:52:55,908
He's turning green...

21
01:53:28,108 --> 01:53:29,508
You speak Russian.

22
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:32,708
A little.

23
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:37,108
It's wise to study the ways
of one's adversary.

24
01:53:38,608 --> 01:53:39,908
Don't you think?

25
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:02,908
The Captain is fighting them.

26
02:05:31,108 --> 02:05:33,608
Captain scared'em out of the water!
