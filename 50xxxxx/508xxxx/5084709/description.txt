Penn & Teller Magic and Mystery Tour (2005) DVDRip XviD 


Made for Canada's CBC, this three-part miniseries proves the West doesn't have a monopoly on magic. For each 50-minute program, the intrepid duo takes an irreverent, non-academic approach to their subject, the art of illusion as practiced primarily by street performers. In Beijing, they observe the bowl and mask tricks. Then it's off to Cairo for cups and balls, which silent partner Teller actually talks about (just not in public). Next it's Alexandria for snake swallowing, Delhi for the handkerchief trick, and Calcutta for the Indian rope trick (some of these are not for the squeamish). Along the way, they share some of their specialties, like fire eating (Penn) and the needle trick (Teller), but are careful not to give any secrets away. Penn & Teller's Magic and Mystery Tour explores culture and history as much as sleight of hand, resulting in a series as enlightening as it is entertaining. --Kathleen C. Fennessy

Program Description
Join the maverick masters of illusion as they trek to China, India, and Egypt, and witness astounding feats of magic and other inexplicable things. Pack your bags and take a funny and unpredictable trip that reveals rarely seen tricks, outrageous charactersâ€”and Pennâ€™s true feelings about puppeteers.
Watch as Penn & Teller gawk in amazement at an Indian snake-swallower. See traditional Bengali performers "torture" family members . . . just as local authorities get into the act. Venture to Calcutta for a "performance" of the legendary Indian Rope Trick. Enter the Egyptian tomb at Beni Hassan for a modern "inside" look at the ancient "cups and balls" trick. See how Penn and Teller survive a collision with a hay truck and enjoy a vintage performance in an extremely remoteâ€”and extremely coldâ€”village.

Caution: This program contains a few scenes that may not be suitable for the squeamish or faint of heart. 

I split up the three programs for ease of downloading and viewing.

Enjoy!
