The Dave Marsh Show

"We didnâ€™t elect ourselves into this mess and we arenâ€™t going to elect ourselves out of it!" says SIRIUS Left host Dave Marsh. Marsh goes beyond traditional liberal media with the principles that liberal and radical Americans believe in most intensely. His view is filled with hope â€“ but is more than just a dream.
