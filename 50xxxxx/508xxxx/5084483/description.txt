This second box set will finally give us a few answers on the questions of what happened with Kazuma during those years after he was banished by the Kannagi clan and his personal war against the mysterious shadow group called Pandemonium. There are going to also be a few more light-hearted episodes with this set as well, one has Ayano, Ren, and Kazuma going to an amusement park on a seemingly important job but there's a little more to it than that especially with the mischievous plots of Ayano's father. There will also be new questions opened up about Kazuma's past as well in this set and hopefully the makers of this great show will release another season later on. The voice cast for the Japanese actors/actresses were of course superb and the cast for the English voice overs that Funimation got were also very incredible for their character roles, if there's any complaint about this series that I can think of than it's probably that it seemed to short you truly wish that there were more than just 24 episodes for this series
