Buck Owens - Act Naturally: The Buck Owens Recordings 1953-1964

Bear Family Records. Release: 2008. Remastered.


Undeniably the most comprehensive Buck Owens collection available, ACT NATURALLY contains everything the Bakersfield boss recorded during his most artistically fertile period, from 1953 to 1964. You can hear not only his genre-defining West Coast honky-tonk classics like the title track, "Under Your Spell Again," and "I've Got a Tiger By the Tail," but also loads of lesser-known gems and rarities. The latter include some of Owens's earliest sessions as a sideman, alternate takes, demos, and other previously unreleased ephemera. It all adds up to the ultimate Owens package, five discs of honky-tonk heaven that allow the listener to chart the stunning evolution of one of country music's true trailblazers.
