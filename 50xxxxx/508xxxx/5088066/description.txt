Great soundscape pioneer.  David Parsons was a sound engineer for BBC New Zealand for many years.  His travels took him to Tibet where he fell in love with Tibetan culture and the natural beauty of the Himalayas.  During his travels he recorded sounds of the monasteries, nature in the mountains and along the Gangese River.  He weaves these samples seamlessly into epic, timeless compositions.  Highly recommended for fans of Robert Rich, Steve Roach, Nightcrawlers and the like.
