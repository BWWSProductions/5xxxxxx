It seems to play fine, but I transcoded them all to subtitled mkv and then to a DVD using DeVeDe*, and only episode didn't work. It zips through a few minutes of the video in only 24 seconds while the audio is normal, and then it stops. Whatever is wrong with this avi survived the transcoding to mkv and reared its head again when the final DVD was made.

* I did the double-transcoding because DeVeDe would not pickup the subtitles unless they were the defalut in an mkv file."
,shonangc,2011-03-05T07:37Z,PS Episode 5 played fine as an avi in both VLC and linux's Media Player. The mkv transcode played fine too. It was only the DVD encode I made and only this episode that had a problem.
