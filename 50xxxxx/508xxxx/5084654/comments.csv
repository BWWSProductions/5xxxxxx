,nagumo,2009-09-11T15:24Z,"It's real, and it sucks compared to the first game.  You can't tell what's happening on-screen.  I'm so glad I didn't buy this one.  Though I totally appreciate the effort it took to bring it to the trackers (I snagged it off of USENET).

Chalk up another write-off under Bobby Kotick and Activision."
,Burvid,2009-09-12T01:53Z,Is it really region free? Or am i just wasting a verbatim disc to burn it?
,harpes_336,2009-09-12T15:47Z,Check the iso file with abgx360 GUI 1.0.1 then you know if its region free
,projectrico,2009-09-14T22:15Z,"Man why has this torrent been so slow lately, for that matter pirate bay has been slow?"
