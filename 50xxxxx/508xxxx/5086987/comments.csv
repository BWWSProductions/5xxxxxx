,fleischi93,2009-09-29T12:42Z,Could you seed more pls? (:
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-09-29T23:32Z,"Yes, I'm really sorry I haven't been seeding as much as usual lately. I started seeding more like I usually do since yesterday.

When everyone finishes downloading, I ask that you seed too. =]
it's a lot easier on everyone if you do."
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-07T16:28Z,"Okay, everyone needs to seed- not just me. I see a ton of downloaders, but barely any of them seed."
,cesarcro,2009-10-08T22:12Z,"ill be glad 2 seed amap. but i got shit connection..  20kbps max :S
thx 4 oph helped me several times cheers :)"
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-09T00:22Z,"No problem, always glad to help...

but as I said on my other upload;

""MIGHT BE DELETING THIS TORRENT!!

people who downloaded better start seeding more, since I am re-installing my operating system. If no one else seeds, than I can't seed it with my new OS, which means no one will be able to download.""

Please keep seeding, for those of you who are able- otherwise this torrent will die out."
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-10-19T00:08Z,"NVM, recovered it without problems.
*seeding*"

,hentooth,2010-05-23T19:02Z,"Nice one, thanks for the up projectfubar, and I WILL seed when done.

DON'T LEECH, you want to download stuff, and if others didn't share it you wouldn't be able to, so put a bit back, even if it's only a few days, it all helps

Sorry... HATE LEECHERS LOL"
