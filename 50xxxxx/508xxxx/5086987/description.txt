READ HERE TO LEARN HOW TO USE OPHCRACK!!


Many people don't understand that .ISO files need to be mounted to a CD or DVD.

Mounting an image [.ISO file] to disk will require you to have a program such as Roxio, Sonic, Nero, Daemon, powerISO, MagicISO, etc.

Look up any one of these, either one will work for mounting the .ISO to CD/DVD.

Why upload this here?
I have been in situations where I didn't have my CD and the original sourceforge direct-links and mirrors were down. Also the fact that you can only download them separately, well, this includes both the XP AND Vista version.

This should help a lot if you are having troubles.
