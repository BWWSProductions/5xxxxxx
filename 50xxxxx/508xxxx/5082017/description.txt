Synopsis.

The Human Condition | Japan | 1959-1961 | Directed by Masaki Kobayashi
                                  
Masaki Kobayashiâ€™s mammoth humanist drama is one of the most staggering achievements of Japanese cinema. Originally filmed and released in three parts, the nine-and-a-half-hour The Human Condition (Ningen no joken), adapted from Junpei Gomikawaâ€™s six-volume novel, tells of the journey of the well-intentioned yet naive Kaji (handsome Japanese superstar Tatsuya Nakadai) from labor camp supervisor to Imperial Army soldier to Soviet POW. Constantly trying to rise above a corrupt system, Kaji time and again finds his morals an impediment rather than an advantage. A raw indictment of its nationâ€™s wartime mentality as well as a personal existential tragedy, Kobayashiâ€™s riveting, gorgeously filmed epic is novelistic cinema at its best.
