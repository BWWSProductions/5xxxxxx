,korty13,2009-09-08T04:24Z,thanks. will seed. just wondering but how did you get a hold of this?
,cclloyd,2009-09-08T04:48Z,personal friend from TechNet gave me it with a serial for each.  Activator was from another torrent.  i forget which one.
,rederic4,2009-09-10T23:33Z,Is this activator the one that will eventually time out every hour (I believe after 90 days).
,rederic4,2009-09-10T23:39Z,Nevermind just read the activator info text. Thanks this is AWESOME
,crook16 ,2009-09-12T01:50Z,"wow good job!
more than a month before the public

ill test it on my inspiron mini 9 "
,nuvi760,2009-09-13T02:50Z,"First of all ---- THANKS
But
What am I doing wrong
I followed your steps 1 to 6 and I am still getting 30Days to activate.
Any help would be appreciated."
,cclloyd,2009-09-13T04:13Z,"First make sure u installed 7Loader then reboot (install is on the app)

Then add the OEM logo of ur choice (preffably the real one u have)

Finally the leftmost option.  Use the one that corresponds to your manufacture.

W8 5 min the check."
,nuvi760,2009-09-13T04:19Z,"Issue solved
Downloaded 7Loader1.5V2 and all is good

Thanks"
,imsharing,2009-09-13T04:29Z,gotta ?....title says 32 and 64...torrent dl says 64 and 86...so will this wrk on my 32?
,crook16 ,2009-09-13T04:56Z,"x86 is compatible with 32 bit.....


oh and PEOPLE! 

the activator works only with windows seven ultimate right?"
,crook16 ,2009-09-13T05:06Z,oh woah another thing.....does this include windows media player 12 ? it isnt out yet but....
,cclloyd,2009-09-13T17:43Z,"Yes it has WMP12.  I can give u a download if any of you would like WMP11 back in 7.

And the activator works with all copies (tested on VM - Sun Portable-Virtualbox)"
,masterffp,2009-09-13T23:00Z,"Gracias, i installed it on my 2 laptops(HP dv6628us and dv6605us) up-to-date works perfect, just follow instructions. this is great!!!!!"
,crook16 ,2009-09-14T00:17Z,"yeah it has media player 12 haha thanks alot after a few hours i finally installed it with a usb on a dell inspiron mini 9

its awsome but what im worried about is that it wont say its activated
it still says that i have 30 days...i checked with the activator and its says the same thing tho i did everything i was supposed to

i ran it as admin and removed the oem info 

after that i installed 7loader and after a few minutes it asked to reboot so when started again i ran as admin and installed the dell oem logo...
am i missing someting?"
,crook16 ,2009-09-14T01:21Z,"sory never  mind it does work the last thing i missed was clicking on the ""slic 2.1 in bios"" option


i chose dell and a couple of minutes later it says its licensed 


again, thank you cclloyd for the iso and the torrent and big thanks to orbit30 and Hazar for the activator

its now going to be my permanent os!"
,cclloyd,2009-09-14T02:30Z,"@crook16

Yea after u do all that look at the leftmost option.  There should be a dropdown menu.  Just click it then choose the OEM u chose.  wait for it to do its magic and it should be active."
,xaviourte,2009-09-14T22:47Z,"ok first i have some question, how to instal it step by step. second is this compatible with the grub from linux mint to use a triple boot (vista linux mint and this (windows 7)) and how all this work? plz and btw im seeding this"
,cclloyd,2009-09-15T04:50Z,"Clean Install:
Burn to a CD or extract to a USB drive (freshly formatted to fat32.  Reboot and bring up the boot screen usually by pressing F12 on startup.  Then just follow the instructions on screen from there (choose custom install as the install option and do not enter a product key)

Upgrade install:
Extract to a USB (fat32).  Open 'sources>cversion.ini' and change both of those numbers to 6001 (Vista SP1).  Then run setup from your USB and choose upgrade install from the option.

And I am not sure about triple boot but I do know this works to double boot Windows XP/vista and Win7 or triple boot XP/Vista/7."
,xaviourte,2009-09-16T01:29Z,okay thank a lot but will it be able to reconize partition on hard drive or will it be able to create partition to instal?
,Juliusthegreat,2009-09-16T12:40Z,"Ok, I trid to burn a dvd-r but when completed it said some files was not copied? Tried anyway and of course it did not work. Did you include any intructions anywhere on a textfile, I don't find any.
I have XP sp3 now and want to have only windows 7 as OS. Help a newbie out :)."
,cclloyd,2009-09-16T21:16Z,"If you have Windows XP you should check to make sure you have the required min specs.

1GHz or more proccessor
16GB hard drive space (x32) 20GB for x64
1GB RAM (x32); 2GB RAM (x64)
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver

Thats the all time minimum.

If it still doesnt work then your computer cannot run it as it doesnt have the power to handle some of the big files in the installation.

Hope i helped."
,cclloyd,2009-09-17T03:20Z,"@crook16
even if the activator only worked with ultimate, if ur gonna pirate y wouldnt u pirate the best?

And to anyone having issues with burning...
Try using ImgBurn (google it).  Its the all time best CD/DVD burning software."
,cclloyd,2009-09-17T03:20Z,and try to burn at x4 speed.
,Juliusthegreat,2009-09-17T09:35Z,"My computer has the minimum specs (even more) and I used Imgburn with 4x speed and choose bootable. But still I can't boot from dvd but can run install from windows. It works until it need to restart the computer then I get a message that there is no bootable disk or something like that.
I start to feel very very noobish :P"
,cclloyd,2009-09-17T21:27Z,You shouldnt need to have any check to make it bootable as it already is.  Just burn with IMGburn at x4 speed.  No other options needed.
,Juliusthegreat,2009-09-18T12:34Z,"Thanks for your patience with me :). I got this error message after starting the installation: windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase of installation. To install windows, restart the installation.

I just burned the dvd like you said. But still I have problem :(. Seems like i am the only one having istallation problems."
,cclloyd,2009-09-19T01:21Z,"Then the Windows 7 RTM disk isnt compatible with your computers hardware.

The only way for you to get this is to buy a new laptop.  And most likely if you do, you would get a free copy of Windows 7 anyway.

Sorry dude. "
,cclloyd,2009-09-19T20:11Z,"Again the reccommended program is ImgBurn

http://www.imgburn.com/"
,Shiva,2009-09-20T11:20Z,Activator did not work :(
,dta151,2009-09-29T23:32Z,so to do an upgrade from vista do you need to have a usb or can you burn it to a dvd?
,cclloyd,2009-09-30T03:32Z,You need to have a USB.  Then edit the cversion.ini to 6001 (Vista SP1) and it will let you do an upgrade install.
,justdance11,2009-10-04T11:38Z,"Thanks ccloyd I have Downloaded different windows, and this is the best I have ever done.
                                                                      Thank you for this great upload.          Excellent."
[T],stupidul,2009-10-07T17:47Z,"Works like a charm.
You just need to make sure Windows 7 is installed on the first partition of the HD, otherwise the activator won't work ;)"
,pegapalo,2009-10-08T17:26Z,"im confuse here, if anyone can answer me , what is the difference between this 5G download, and the 12G download?"
,marflo,2009-10-13T02:13Z,"Did you get any abuse or infringement notice downloading this?
Your answer will be much appreciated because I tried to download lately from another torrent and I had to delete everything due to above mentioned notice.Thanks!"
,1k0ed1,2009-10-25T11:15Z,"@ cclloyd

Okay sorry for sounding like an  idiot :P

But 1. Burn the iso image to dvd-r
      2. Reboot, Install windows to my selected partion

,C_3010_S,2009-11-02T12:25Z,Thanx cclloyd......gr8 upload!!...Will Windows Update work with this OS?
,kayycubed,2009-11-10T06:02Z,Thank you so much! Worked perfectly; no trouble at all.
,aC9,2009-11-25T02:14Z,"@ccloyd

need help ccloyd.. 
    I've successfully installed the OS w/ no prob. on a new pC, I chose Win7 H.Premium (32).. the only prob that I've encountered was the activation; on the desktop after the installation I tried running the 7Loader.exe but getting an error message something about the file itself, in short can run the activator.. What do you think needs to be done. help will be well appreciated... Thanks much..     "
,aC9,2009-11-25T02:23Z,"@cclloyd

I have the 7Loader.exe file on my flashdrive, copied it to the desktop then tried to run it but no success, tried several times, no go... Just need to run the loader ""as admin"" ryt? then follow the wizard.. no need to actually burn the loader or even boot it to disc ayt? still stuck on this 30day/trial status.. ='( "
,aC9,2009-11-25T02:31Z,very nice upload.. the actual install of the OS went smooth & fast.. my only left issue was the activation.. any help will be well appreciated.. Thanks Much...
