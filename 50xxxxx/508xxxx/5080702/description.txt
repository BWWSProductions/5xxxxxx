This is the Windows 7 RTM Build 7600 (The build that is released to public on October 22nd) With an activator (Tested numerous ones and included the one that worked.)

To use just burn to a DVD-R or use on a VM.  If you want to do an upgrade install extract then run setup.exe.  If you aren't able to do an upgrade install then extract then open Sources>cversion.ini and change both to your build number (Vista SP1 = 6001)

The activator that is included has instructions on usage that i simplified for what worked for me.

For those of you who are skeptical about releases of Windows 7, i included the Windows 7 ISO Verifier for you. :)

Recommended Program for burning to a DVD is ImgBurn - http://www.imgburn.com/
For best use burn at x4 speed.
