after you installed it, set it up and closed it, make sure you right click the task bar and select task manager. then under process, right click the nmapplb.dll process and ""end process""...then use the patch...worked great for me."

THANKS...."
,mstir,2010-03-14T06:16Z,"Beware this torrent.  

The patch has a payload on it.

Avast 5 did not detect this one (unlike the many other false positives it does).

The patch apparently does work, it looks like my copy was ""patched"", however, Avast was completely crippled after this.  I had to remove and reinstall it to correct this.

Dr Guard was installed.  Dr Guard is a fake malware protection program.  It not only disabled Avast, it disabled my firewall (win 7) and disabled my ability to remove it without resorting to malwarebytes and trojan remover and several reboots later.  

Dr Guard is an asshole related program.  Whoever wrote it to get you to buy that shit is an asshole.

The uploader needs to check this shit before he uploads it to us."

,CARTOONCANCER,2010-07-28T12:07Z,"This whole fucking Network Magic and all the useless time it's consumed of mine has brought me to this... It does not fucking work for WINDOWS 7 Home edition nor WINDOWS 7 Ultimate I'm not even trying anymore... I'm sure there's something just as fucking useful if not better then this old piece of shit waste of life... Yeah! I'm sure it works just fucking spiffy if your still using any home made or altered XP and on that note... Fuck, i would have been better off trying to design my own Keygen for this fucking piece of shit outdated program... Christ...  Do yourselves a favor and just download the Slayer & Slipknot Discographies.
Then gain enough fucking courage and balls to just walk into a Best Buy, Walmart, Office Max, etc. and pick out your new computer with the best shit in it and tell the people that work there that if they even look at you sideways you'll blow there fucking brains out and walk calmly out of there with what you want... New Shit... Im actually supprised that Windows 7 didn't come equiped with something 1000 times better then punk ass Network Magic... 

Rape the government... "
,psycho_freke,2010-09-30T15:06Z,"@CARTOONCHARACTER

Wow dude, you got some pent-up anger boiling in there. Go smoke a joint, research how to build a real computer yourself, so you can tell Best Buy, Walmart, Office Max, etc., and Dell, HP, Compaq, Gateway, ect. to fuck off while you build a computer for a comparabile price that will blow any of their shit out of the water (except alienware, which you won't be able to touch :P). After your whole rant, and the fuck the government comment, I expected something better than ""gain enough fucking courage and balls to just walk into a Best Buy, Walmart, Office Max, etc. and pick out your new computer with the best shit in it"""
,relax999,2010-12-24T07:36Z,"the patch display is incomplete. No button to press to activate patch. May be issue with Windows 7. :( 
HELP"
,Gunga_Din,2012-02-05T19:29Z,"I have not downloaded this to try because of the many negative, and really extreme, comments about it.

It would be nice, though, if mstir was anywhere near correct in the damage it did to his system, to see a bit of Middle East-like punishment inflicted on the malware/virus writers: Let's see how well they adapt to using only their left hand."
