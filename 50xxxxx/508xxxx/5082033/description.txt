Ace Frehley is a 1978 solo album from the lead guitarist of American hard rock band Kiss. It was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978.

"New York Groove" rose to #13 on the US Billboard chart, the highest showing for a Kiss single since "Beth" in 1976, until the song "I Was Made for Lovin' You" a year later (#11). The album itself reached #26 on the US Billboard album chart. It was certified Platinum on October 2, 1978, when it sold 1,000,000 copies.

The album featured Anton Fig on drums, who would later perform session work on the Kiss albums Dynasty and Unmasked, as well as become a member of Ace Frehley's post-Kiss band Frehley's Comet. Fig, along with Will Lee, who played bass on three tracks on this album, would become permanent members of Paul Shaffer's band on Late Night with David Letterman and The Late Show with David Letterman.

Paul Daniel "Ace" Frehley (pronounced /ËˆfreÉªli/; born April 27, 1951) is an American guitarist best known as an original member and lead guitarist for the rock band Kiss. He took on the persona of 'Spaceman' when the band adopted costumes and theatrics. Frehley played with the group from its inception in 1973 until his departure in 1982.

After leaving Kiss, Frehley embarked on a moderately successful solo career, which was put on hold when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour. His second tenure with Kiss lasted until 2002, when he left at the conclusion of what was purported to be the band's Farewell Tour. He has since resumed his solo career. On January 5, 2009 Frehley reported on his official website that he was putting finishing touches on his next album, Anomaly, which will be released on September 15, 2009.
