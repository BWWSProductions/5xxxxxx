"'Personal Jukebox' is a compilation album by Italian singer-songwriter Alice, released in 2000 on WEA/Warner Music.

In the Spring of 2000 Alice returned to the Sanremo music festival, twenty-nine years after first appearing in the contest under her birth name Carla Bissi, singing "Il Mio Cuore Se Ne Va", and nineteen years after the victory with "Per Elisa" which also became her international breakthrough. The song she performed in 2000, Juri Camisasca's "Il Giorno Dell'Indipendenza" ("The Day of Independence"), was also the opening track on the career retrospective 'Personal Jukebox', alongside two other new recordings, "Tutto Ãˆ Niente" ("All Is Nothing") and an Italian language cover version of David Bowie/Pat Metheny Group's 1985 hit "This is Not America" with new lyrics penned by the singer herself.

The album also contains four singles from Alice's then most recent pop albums 'Exit' (1998) and 'Charade' (1995), including "Open Your Eyes", a duet with Skye Edwards of British trip-hop band Morcheeba - a song co-written by Peter Hammill of Van Der Graaf Generator - and "Dammi La Mano Amore" featuring King Crimson guitarist Trey Gunn. Other highlights include the original versions of "In Viaggio Sul Tuo Viso" from 1992's 'Mezzogiorno Sulle Alpi' and "Visioni" from 1989's 'Il Sole Nella Pioggia', licensed from the artist's former label EMI, featuring collaborations with international musicians such as Steve Jansen, Richard Barbieri and Mick Karn of Japan/Rain Tree Crow, Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music, Tony Levin, Dave Gregory of XTC, Jerry Marotta, Jon Hassell, Danny Thompson - to name but a few. In addition to these, the aptly titled 'Personal Jukebox' features new interpretations of some of Alice's best-known songs from her early repertoire, among them "Chan-Son Egocentrique", a duet with Italian indie band Bluvertigo, the Franco Battiato cover "Prospettiva Nevski" which became one of her signature tunes, "A Cosa Pensano", "Nomadi", "Il Vento Caldo Dell'Estate", a radically technofied dance remix of Sanremo winner "Per Elisa" and an orchestral solo version of Eurovision classic "I Treni Di Tozeur", the latter just like "Prospettiva Nevski", "Il Giorno Dell'Indipendenza", "Tutto Ãˆ Niente" and "For This Is Not America" with strings courtesy of the London Symphony Orchestra, arranged and conducted by acclaimed British composer Gavyn Wright."


Uploader's comment: to those who may not be familiar with the second half of Alice's career, this is the perfect introduction to her esoteric and poetic albums 'Charade' and 'Exit', musically influenced by genres such as ambient, electronica and world music, and the subsequent projects 'Devogue', 'God Is My DJ', 'Viaggio In Italia' and most recently the live album 'Lungo La Strada'. 'Personal Jukebox' also serves as a time document of a musical journey by an uncompromising artist who over the past three decades has always had the integrity, determination and courage to go her own way - no matter what certain multinational record companies may have said at the time.....


Grazie di cuore cara Carla e tanti complimenti sinceri per la tua splendida musica!
