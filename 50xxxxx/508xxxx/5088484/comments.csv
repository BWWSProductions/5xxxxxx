,so_fresh_so_clean,2010-08-01T04:44Z,"no clarification here soooo, this isn't JUST in Spanish is it?  It's a slow torrent for me so I decided to ask before waiting another 10 hours =/  Please tell me it's in English"
,so_fresh_so_clean,2010-08-01T08:36Z,"confirmed, in English, game works perfectly.  Just use 7zip or winrar to un-rar the torrent, then use daemon tools (or similar) to mount the image to install.  After installation copy the crack to to the program files>capcom>re5 and there ya go :)"
,blueboyannehem,2010-09-21T11:17Z,so yeah the menus are in english however the fucking submenus are in Chinese and i dont get shit on how to change graphic etc. or some shit like that. There is also an fucking annoying chinese subtitle in all the cutscenes. How do i get rid of it?
