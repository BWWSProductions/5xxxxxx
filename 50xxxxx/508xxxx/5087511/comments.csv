,panzersiddhartha,2009-09-23T21:19Z,"Hm. Ok, ok. Sorry. I take that back. It all just looked so available right away there.

Hope this torrent comes alive. "
,mitter,2009-11-26T15:41Z,"nice idea, but with no seeders useless waste of internet.
"
,Autarchus,2010-01-14T08:06Z,"No seeders...this is why files of over 30GB are prohibited on some torrent sites. Great try torrenzed, but could you break it up a bit and re-upload, like in 10GB parts? Thanks. "
,torrenzed,2010-01-24T17:42Z,"for all those who are about to complete the download.

PLEASE KEEP ON SEEDING FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

THANKS."
