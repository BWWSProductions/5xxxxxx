AIMS AND SCOPE OF JOURNAL
Nature Immunology is a multidisciplinary journal that publishes papers of the highest quality and significance in all areas of immunology. Priority is given to work that provides fundamental insight into the workings of the immune system. Areas covered include, but are not limited to, innate immunity and inflammation; development; immune receptors, signaling and apoptosis; antigen presentation; gene regulation and recombination; cellular and systemic immunity; vaccines; immune tolerance; autoimmunity and tumor immunology, microbial immunopathology; and transplantation.

Nature Immunology places its highest priority on fair and rapid review and speedy publication. Decisions on whether to send a manuscript out for peer review are normally made within two working days of receipt and decisions about publication are typically made within two days of receipt of the referees' reports.

In addition to publishing significant original research, Nature Immunology also publishes commentary, News and Views, brief research notes, historical perspectives, correspondence from readers and reviews of the literature, thus serving as the major conduit of top-quality information for the immunology community.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER NATURE JOURNALS

Nature Immunology is editorially independent, and its editors make their own decisions, independent of the other Nature journals. If a paper is rejected from one Nature journal, the authors can use an automated manuscript transfer service to submit the paper to another Nature journal via a link sent to them by the editor handling the manuscript. Authors should note that referees' comments (including any confidential comments to the editor) and identities are transferred to the editor of the second journal along with the manuscript. In that case, the journal editors will take the previous reviews into account when making their decision, although in some cases the editors may choose to take advice from additional or alternative referees. Alternatively, authors may choose to request a fresh review, in which case they should not use the automated transfer link, and the editors will evaluate the paper without reference to the previous review process. Click  Visit this link: http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml/05_transfer.xml&style=xml/05_transfer.xsl for details of the manuscript transfer service, and for links to NPG journals and subject areas.
