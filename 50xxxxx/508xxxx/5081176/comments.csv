Matt.7:16 Ye shall know them by their fruits."

I find that very appropriate. Seeing someone's lies and half truths dragged out into the light shows their true character. Perhaps this will help.

""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""

i know, we live in a free world not thanks to people like you -you would have started another inquisition- so anyone is free to persue their ideas and in your case no matter how stupid those may be! "

If you believe this, then you clearly don't know how to read. These passages DO NOT say that. Quit trying to lie and make the Bible look bad. When it refers to the ""edges"" of the earth, it's simply using figurative language, quite the same when we say, the four ""corners"" of the earth. This does not mean the earth has corners, but simply refers to North, East, South, and West.

Also, using you line of reasoning, then if the Bible is correct about anything, then it can be reasoned that it's also correct about everything else too, huh? Well, the Bible was the first book to mention the King Nebuchadnezzar, Hittites, , and tons more. Historians and scientists said there was no such king or no such nation (respectively) and then were forced to admit defeat later on when they found archeological evidence of their existence. Maybe you should all try and read the Bible with an open mind."
