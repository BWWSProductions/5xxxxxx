I just need advice as to what the best DVD to .avi ripper is and any advice to the settings in order to get the best size to quality ratio. I have tried a few different apps but they either rip too big or the quality is crap along withthe screen ratio. Any advice from the PROs would be good. (I did try to contact axxo last year but got no reply.)  regards and respect Archy."
