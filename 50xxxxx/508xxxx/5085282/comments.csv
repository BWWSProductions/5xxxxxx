,fredfan,2009-11-20T16:29Z,"...Well, then, you didn't miss much, hjsn1.  Pleasantly silly for Star Wars and even Star Trek fans, though.  Funny cameos.

DVD9 size includes EVERYTHING, including FBI warnings and plugs for the renting video store.  Thanks again, flu dude."
,PUCKU,2009-12-05T23:09Z,"I'm new to burning with dual layer discs, I know with Xbox games, you need a layer break or you will get a pause in the middle of the playing of your video.  Do we need a layer break with this file as I don't see one posted???"
,fredfan,2009-12-12T20:27Z,"Fruitballz is right.  Seamless can be better if your player/drive supports that playback option.  I think most up to date players do, but if you don't know just sacrifice one disk to find out.

Trust old IMGBurn will present you with several ranked suggestions when you're going through the burning process.  I never found it matters, but I'm told on older players, you might see a pause if you choose certain ones.  Either way, no biggie."
