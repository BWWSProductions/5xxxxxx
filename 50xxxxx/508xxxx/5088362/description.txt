From the ashes of old conflicts, a new terror arises. The Umbrella
Corporation and its crop of lethal viruses have been destroyed and
contained. But a new, more dangerous threat has emerged. Years after
surviving the events in Raccoon City, Chris Redfield has been fighting the
scourge of bio-organic weapons all over the world. Now a member of the
Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (B.S.A.A.), Chris is sent to
Africa to investigate a biological agent that is transforming the populace
into aggressive and disturbing creatures. Joined by another local BSSA agent,
Sheva Alomar, the two must work together to solve the truth behind the
disturbing turn of events. Featuring a revolutionary new co-op mode of
gameplay, Resident Evil 5 will let players experience fear together as
terror moves out of the shadows and into the light of day.
