Counter-Strike 1.6 NoSteam [with BOTS] LAN + online, full p47+p48 support + server nonsteam

You can play online only in patched nosteam servers. I included two separate
nosteam clients in this release so you should be able to join them all without
having to worry about which nosteam version the server is. If you want to play in regular
Steam-only servers, you need to buy the game.

I also included a separate dedicated server setup, in case you want to start your
own dedicated LAN game with your friends, or start your own server on the internet.
The server is already setup to accept all nosteam clients.

If you are new to Counter-Strike, read the NFO it includes lots of sites you can
find support and information at.
