OK now here's the thing...

While searching Thepiratebay for Gothic rock / metal songs i stumbled upon this great uploader ASSMASTER [ http://thepiratebay.org/user/assmaster/ ]

He uploaded these great torrents called Gothic Melancholy which were a compilation of various artists of the Gothic genre...Now these were way back in 2006 and hence the torrents have almost died...

Now i thought it would have been impossible for me to get all these songs until i saw someone had uploaded all the 20 Volumes. 
Many of the artists and bands in this collection are almost impossible to get hold of otherwise...

That's why i uploaded this torrent here so if nothing else it'll atleast get a larger audience than it had before...So now i need your help in bringing this torrent back from the dead and get this incredible collection.


Please help me with the seeding and the uploading.

(Last time i checked it had 5 seeds and 10 leeches so you are gonna have to patient)

PS : i did not rip these mp3s or create the m3us...All credit must go to Assmaster.
   : Comments even if criticisms are welcome.
