mandy,
i added those trackers just to be on the safe side...more the trackers the better right?"
,torrent-sweetie,2009-09-13T02:49Z,"I seeded about 4.5 gb for you then everything froze up on me, sorry it wasn't more."
,Touchmetal,2009-09-13T11:36Z,"Thank you very much torrent-sweetie and others who have been seeding...the peer number has been steadily growing which means many people have helped us share this great collection...

So perhaps we can say we have achieved what we set out to do...

,123abc123abc123ABC,2011-05-11T08:11Z,This is awesome. I was searching for the originals so I could beg them to be seeded. I'll seed the hell out of this once I get it.
