Happy Gilmore (1996)

After failing to make the hockey team, Happy Gilmore is forced to take up the "sport" of golf to make enough money to pay off his grandmother's I.R.S. debts. He wins the first tournament and is admitted into the P.G.A. Once he gets there, his wild antics help give the sport of golf both a bad name, and great ratings. More than a few people stand in his way. Especially the current golf champion, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald).
