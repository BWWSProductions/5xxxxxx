I ripped this from my own CD using Exact Audio Copy in Secure Mode.  Excellent sound quality.  Enjoy."
,DrVolker,2009-09-12T08:21Z,"I will seed this for as long as I can.  Please seed when you are finished downloading.  Thanks!

Also, if anyone has Qzoo's ""Butterfly Peepl"", which was their second album released (in 2000), please upload it.

Regards,
Paul"
