Could you, please, help answering: is there a way to convert Ots files into avi/mpeg/vob that you can suggest?
I have got about 5 of your 1980s compilations into Ots format from here, and still didn't find any decision... Would like to convert few of the clips."
[T],towerelect,2009-09-22T18:46Z,"Well the best thing to do is obviously buy the software, it will simply be the best $250 you will ever spend!  But let me know the album titles you have and I will upload the original VoB's here on TPB as Demonoid seems to be in a little bit of deep hardware trouble right now.

Ots Studio is a one way conversion for all Video and Karaoke files, this may change with the new version due out in October.   Meantime the free demo will play your stuff for 30 days.  Go here for more info http://www.otsav.com"

1980s Disc 3:
GTR - When The Heart Rules the Mind [Video] (5:04)

1980s Disc 8:
Fixx - Stand Or Fall [[Video]] (3:36)
Stevie Nicks - Stand Back [[Video]] (4:16)"
[T],towerelect,2009-09-25T00:38Z,"It is a little difficult taking individual track requests as this collection is normally in its native Ots AV Pro format and conversion to Ots is one way for copyright and performing rights reasons, so I have to go back always to the original media, which is a pain in the neck, however I promise I will see what I can do and make up an album of just those tracks...  Watch for my next seed soon :)"
