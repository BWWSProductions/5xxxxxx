,.Leto.,2009-12-29T20:36Z,"true. I don't know why you wrote 
""Language.............: English  | Italian  | Latin  | French  | Swiss German  | German  | Spanish""
since the whole movie is in English and there's no other language available.

Perfect quality though. Thanks :)"
,.Leto.,2010-01-03T04:39Z,"I noticed a problem regarding the subtitles. Some characters aren't correctly displayed. For example ""w"" or ""v"" spelled ""W"" ""V"" where they're shouldn't (like in the middle of a sentence), a square or ' displayed for no reason,...
To fix this I extracted the subtitles track with MKVtoolnix + MKVextract. Then corrected the .srt with Word (which took quite a long time since there're a lot of mistakes) and put it back in the MKV.
So if you're having the same problem there's a way to fix it."
