Very interesting to hear how they progressed as a band.I await your next series of uploads with anticipation mc,I can always rely on you to come up with some tasty goodies ! Cheers."

I can't think of any other band that's changed that much from their firstalbum to their last, both visually and musically - and all within the space of three years... But there's a prelude as well; Rain Tree Crow. Coming up!"

Yup, plus a few other goodies. :-)"
