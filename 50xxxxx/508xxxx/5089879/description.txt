Episode 133 - Use Photoshop for 3D Animated Videos!
Sunday, July 5th, 2009 â€“ running time 15:46

Create videos that move while in a 3D space using Adobe Photoshop CS4.

*** Photoshop imports video in CS4
You now have the ability to import Quicktime videos into Photoshop with CS4, so this means you can add video to your images, much like a moving picture within a TV in a living room, or a changing scene outside a window.

*** Add video layer
Choose Layer > Video Layer > New Video Layer From a File. Bert chooses a video of an old PixelPerfect episode as an example. He then creates a frame around the video using separate layers.

*** Create a 3D Postcard from the video layer
With the video layer selected, choose 3D > New 3D Postcard from Layer. Nothing will change in the appearance of the layer until you rotate the movie using 3D controls. Apply the 3D settings to both the video and the frame, then merge all the layers so that they become one unit that moves together. Adjust the positioning of individual layers by using the 3D Scene window.

*** Apply video to a 3D shape
In a separate example, Bert demonstrates Photoshop's ability to apply video to a 3D shape. He creates an example of a curvy object made from a black and white gradient (3D > New Mesh from Grayscale > Plane). To add the video to this shape, open the 3D object layer and choose Layer > Video Layer > New Video Layer. When you save and close this window, you'll see that the video is a part of the wavy 3D shape.

*** Create animation
In the Animation window, lock the object position. Shorten the movie length to about 5 seconds. At the 4 second mark, rotate and change position of the 3D object. When done, Export > Render Video, then choose your video output settings. This will take a few moments before your exported 3D video can be viewed.
