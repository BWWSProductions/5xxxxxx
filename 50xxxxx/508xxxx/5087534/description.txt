Tomorrow is the follow-up to Sean Kingston's self-titled debut album, which was released in 2007, sold more than 1 million copies worldwide and generated three back-to-back Top 10 singles including the double-platinum smash "Beautiful Girls," which hit No. 1 in 21 countries.

The new album reflects the 19-year-old's growth as a person as well as his evolution as a singer, songwriter, and entertainer. It is a buoyant collection of pop-fueled feel-good anthems and dance-floor clarion calls that bumps everything from electro-pop (the club-banging first single "Fire Burning") to rock ("Shoulda Let U Go" featuring Good Charlotte) and from reggae (the breezy "Island Queen"), to R&B ("Wrap U Around Me"). The production is courtesy of a host of top-notch producers, including J.R. Rotem (who produced Kingston's debut), RedOne (Lady Gaga), Wyclef Jean (who also contributes vocals on "Ice Cream Girl"), Detail (Akon), Lucas Secon (Jordin Sparks), and The Smeezingtons (Flo Rida). "Fire Burning," the singer-songwriter's first single off the new album, entered into the top 5 at rhythm and top 10 at pop radio and was certified platinum by the RIAA in just 10 weeks. In addition to its ascent up the charts, streaming of "Fire Burning" reached over 13 million in just 2 months while the video for "Fire Burning" was the #1 most played video on MTV and Fuse for the month of July.
