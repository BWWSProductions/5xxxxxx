,g3543,2009-09-13T16:11Z,MBAM says the file SetupDAWN2.exe has a Malware.Packer.
[V],Subzero!,2009-09-13T18:16Z,"well this is a crunched file (upacker) and as i was expecting this, i was so kind to bring you forward a proof. (not only for you , for all the other too, who claim we spread malware!).

go to # TPTB # directory and extract SetupDAWN2_BckUp.7z

check the difference!. and if you still receive the same msg from your viral tool, i suggest to get a better one, or stay away from TPTB releases!."
,AnimeNewbieDude,2009-09-13T19:48Z,"Game works perfectly so far. (Only played for about 30 minutes.)

Thanks!

,Mudget,2009-09-22T21:42Z,"My biggest concern right now is how to uninstall this game.  In the official read me it says there are two ways - 1. insert the DVD and it will give an uninstall option, or 2 . use the uninstall option from the start menu programs group.  Neither of these show up for me.  No uninstall option when mounting image, and no start menu programs group (possibly because of Windows 7?  i don't know).  Anyway, any suggestions would be nice.  Although I appreciate all uploads, I found this game to be an utter piece of crap and I want it off my computer.  Thanks."
,Emophiliac,2009-10-20T05:11Z,Mudget there is no actual installation being done.  All you should need to do is delete the extracted folder and manually delete saves and registries
,Mudget,2009-10-23T18:39Z,"Thanks, Emophiliac, that's what I'll do.  Appreciate the feedback."
