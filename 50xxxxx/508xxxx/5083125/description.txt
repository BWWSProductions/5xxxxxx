"3 years in the making...First time filmmakers Colin Arlen and Colby Elrick have created a stunning visual representation of not only the art, but the city of San Francisco itself. Starting in 2006 with nothing but a camera and a cast of 14 amazingly talented riders, the film was created with virtually no budget and absolutely no outside assistance or corporate sponsorships. It's been a long time in the making but we think you'll find it worth the wait."
