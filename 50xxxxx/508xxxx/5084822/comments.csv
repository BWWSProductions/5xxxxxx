,NoCode0680,2010-08-02T01:52Z,"baggies91mpk, I don't know if any of the torrents for the Remasters have the mini documentary in them.  I bought all the Remastered Beatles CD's, and ripped them all to my computer, and it didn't rip the mini-docs.  I just ripped them using iTunes.  Just because the documentary isn't here doesn't mean this is fake.  I did check out a couple of the other torrents and they are fake, not because they didn't have the doc, but because I listened to them and compared them to the real thing.  I don't know about this one though, there aren't any seeders."
