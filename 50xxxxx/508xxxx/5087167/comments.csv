[T],insinuendo,2009-09-13T15:52Z,"why rars man!?

your ups are better than that!

get one corrupt file and it's done...
"
,verbose2,2009-09-13T19:10Z,I don't think there are any advantages for keeping HQ torrents rarred. Your torrent client should already be doing the hash checking and automatically re-downloading corrupt chunks
,verbose2,2009-09-13T23:00Z,"plus, by leaving your content rarred, you are wasting everyone's time and money, because after someone with a fast connection downloads and unrars it, they are less likely keep on seeding because rarred files use 2x the disk space.

I've downloaded a couple dozen unrarred, HD quality movies and I've never had a problem with opening/playing the finished download. However, the first time I tried downloading a rarred film, I was hit with 3 corrupt because they were either corrupt from the start or it was that they were rar files which came with external checksums, thereby disabling the built-in auto hash-checking provided by my torrent client. I have refused to download rarred content ever since."
,verbose2,2009-09-14T03:46Z,"""some will be packed, some will be unpacked""

I appreciate your unpacked uploads, I really do... but why may i ask?"
,verbose2,2009-09-14T04:05Z,"and have you read this article from torrentfreak:

,loadstone007,2009-09-14T12:10Z,Thank you! :)
,Rusty888,2009-09-14T15:03Z,jonny the one and only!!
,Rusty888,2009-09-14T15:04Z,Thanx!
,nnike,2009-09-14T19:49Z,"Plz seed...
I mean 554 seeders and only 50-70 kbps

Not good...."
,sk8er2872,2009-09-16T00:11Z,um who really cares if they are rarred or not.  esp like a lot of people who download big files and stream to ps3 your going to use mkv2vob it's still going to take up 2x the disc space. so quit bitching and be glad your getting shit for free.
,caliwillbemine,2009-09-16T19:11Z,"i think you failed in proposing a good HD rip.
2Gb for 94min ?! come on...
on top of that you made rar files! no sense much ??"
,neotokyo,2009-09-16T20:33Z,"a/v quality 10/10

i guess you can compress animation more than normal movies. i liked the movie too. made me laugh a few times."
,chevy1966,2009-09-17T05:44Z,do u have to have a certain dvd to burn blue rays
,Pichan2,2009-09-19T19:29Z,"I'd like to inform you that I will be seeding this as long as I can afford to keep the useless rars wasting space on my laptop. There's absolutely no advantage to using rars in BT.
BT is not the scene, so stop doing things the ""scene way""."
,verbose2,2009-09-20T04:52Z,you can still unrar before you upload to BT
,verbose2,2009-09-20T16:38Z,I don't understand... Are you saying multiple people have access to your account?
,verbose2,2009-09-22T01:47Z,"I wasn't complaining. I was trying to ask a legitimate question... When someone posts a torrent and then later remarks that no, they ""didn't  make the Torrent"", it sounds a bit contradictory and therefore merits some additional explanation, don't you think?

Now there's no real financial incentive here on TPB forcing you to be accountable for your actions, but bloody hell man, you sure are putting your trusted status into question when you refuse to answer simple questions like that."
,cannibalvegetarian,2009-09-24T16:42Z,"I'm going to have to concur with the negative quality comments.

Got this and the backgrounds have rather much macro blocking. Eventhough it's well within scene rules it's so far away from the real thing that you need to see it for yourself.

Even the audio track is a mere 640kbps DD as opposed to 1536kbps DTS these things usually pack. Albeit the audio isn't lacking anywhere near as much as the video.

Sadly, it's a beggars version."

,S3nd41,2009-09-26T19:39Z,Please stop sharing shit in .rars. Most people just extract the movie and erase the archives right away because they use up free space. If you share the actual movies instead people will normally share at least before they burn/copy it and erase it from their disks. 
,dougaldog2002,2009-09-30T23:13Z,"Why are certain people whining about the file format of this torrent? It takes 2 seconds to check what the files are, then it's up to you to DL or not. There is absolutely no reason for -jonny- to justify anything to anyone.

Simple, eh?"
,verbose2,2009-10-03T04:41Z,"That's actually what I do before I start a torrent. If it's just a sample and unaltered mkv, I download, seed, and STFU. If it's rarred and there's not already an unrarred version that I can find, I start complaining/whining. It's as simple as that. Don't wanna hear my blabber? Well then stop fucking rarring your shit!!!"
[V],-jonny-,2009-10-15T15:46Z,fuck off verbose.
,justin131,2009-10-23T00:21Z,"The rars are from when it first hits the scene and the people who make all this shit possible pass it along to one another via non bt routes where rars ARE advantageous for quickly resolving corrupted transfers.

So personally, the fact that they make getting free high quality movies for free possible in the first place absolves them of the miniscule task of unraring it before it hits the mainstream torrent sites.

So shit the fuck up and thank the man for doing this at all.

Thanks jonny, your the best."
,justin131,2009-10-23T00:22Z,shut*
,yuz2008,2009-12-14T00:06Z,"Thanks.
Is there any 3D version of this film?"
,fdgdzbzdfb,2009-12-29T02:34Z,"ive said it before but ill say it again
jonny, you are quickly becoming the aXXo of hd movies bro.
thanks a shit load."
,sanjuboy,2010-02-21T09:09Z,Awesome video and audio quality...thanx jonny and sinners.
,dlldmn,2010-07-11T21:34Z,"Snobby ass people.. Rarred or not, it\'s fuckin FREE. If it\'s corrupted, move on. Or you can go buy the damn thing, how about that? Rarred is better than nothing at all you pusses.nnGive thanks to our uploaders for putting in ANY amount of effort, jeez. Thanks -jonny- and SiNNERS"
,GodspeedX,2010-11-28T02:19Z,"oh NO!  I have to..  *gasp*..  UNRAR IT?  but it's going to take me like a whole minute!!!!!!!

fucking whiners

thanks for the torrent jonny!"
