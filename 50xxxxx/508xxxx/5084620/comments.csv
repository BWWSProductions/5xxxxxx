But don't listen to me, I am of course a government agent, part of the conspiracy."
[T],verifire,2009-09-11T00:27Z,"@undulat: If you say so. But actually I don't believe you when you say that you work for any government agency.
And ""going to this guy's website"" doesn't exactly qualify you to utter as much about him and what he can tell you or offers. Actually, the prices he operate with are extremely low, both on books and DVDs, compared to what most people charge. He just wants to get the knowledge out to people, but this is his only occupation and income, and, as I say; he uses everything on expeditions and all that goes with that.
He doesn't even charge you for giving lectures. If you invite him to come and have a lecture, he just comes! And he lives in New Zealand! Does this sound like a ""Bible merchant"" to you?

Have you read anything or seen any of the evidence he presents in the various books and DVDs he offers? No. And if you did, you would probably not believe it even if he came knocking you in the head with a 3 meter long thigh-bone from a human being that once lived here on earth.
And if he showed you 5000 years old batteries from Babylon, you'd probably argue that they were drinking vessels, but it was a bit inconvenient with those electric conductors sticking out of it..
If he took you to the Red Sea, and you dived down and saw a pathway of sand that stretches 13 Km across the bay and makes the water only about 300 meters deep at the deepest, but stoops to a 1600 meters on each side of it, if you there saw chariots and wheels from the exact dynasty in Egypt when Moses is recorded as to have led the people of Israel out of Egypt, but the water drowned the Egyptian army following them, and you still find wheels, horses hoofs and LOTS of human remains, you'd probably say it was just a coincidence? Don't judge in matters you  know nothing about.

I know this man through his work and our personal mailing, and I can tell you that he's NOT a hoax.

He is the most educated and yet humble brother you can imagine. I'm sure he forgives you, because you only judged him upon a quick once-over on his site, but lay off the slander until you know what you're talking about, won't you?

Sorry, but I get a little carried away sometimes by for instance ""know-it-alls"" that hasn't even begun to fathom how little they know. I'm beginning to fathom a little how ignorant I am, and that is a sign of growing wisdom, according to Socrates/Plato..

The Bible says that ""Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and good understanding have all those who do His commandments"".

I lack a lot there.. But I won't give up! He will finish the work He started in me. :-)
Peace on you all. V."
,undulat1,2009-09-12T17:54Z,"Sigh. Why do I even bother?
Listen, writing I am part of the conspiracy was sarcasm, ok?
What you need to understand is there is a difference between being oppressive and being dismissive. When you think you have figured out this enourmes network of hidden knowledge and the oppression of the same, it is easy to take other's dissmissive attitude as being part of a pattern of oppression, when in reality it is just a lack of interest, not necessarily in any facts presented, but more in the conspiracy attitude.

As it happens, I have a high level education within science and a good general knowledge of different fields and history. The simple fact is that while there are undoubtedly many examples of lost knowledge, there is no oppression happening from the scientific community at large. Sure, there are arguments, both petty and weighty, about a lot of things, but that does not consitute a conspiracy.

Did you know that the so-called Babylonian batteries were featured in an episode of Mythbusters on Discovery? Hardly suppressive, wouldn't you agree?

In fact, since you for some reason found it necessary to bring Christianity into this, a actual example of grand scale suppressing of history can be found right there. Not from science, but from the good ol' God guys. Check out the BBC programme  ""The Lost Gospels"" (easily found on TPB) for that fascinating story. Because as we all know, ""Fear of the Lord is the end of Wisdom""."
,resonator,2009-09-12T23:31Z,"Thanks for the upload and Gray's site address. I cannot recall I have heard of him before, although these subjects are my interests. Very interesting stuff indeed, regardless of its true or not. I try to keep an open mind and question the accepted /mainstream knowledge or truths out there."
[T],verifire,2009-09-13T00:51Z,"@resonator: Thanks for saying thanks.. :-)

@undulat1: I understood that it was sarcasm. I just thought it inappropriate. I haven't even considered that you were not intelligent, and neither do I doubt your education. Never the less, I did presume that you were one of those who had no idea of the subjects involved, and there I was somewhat wrong. Sorry about that, but you gave me very little to go by, and I've been attacked by such light headed ""commentators"" before on my uploads, so I jumped to conclusions. And so did you.. But if you have no interest in this, why do you comment like you did? That was very offensive to me, because what you wrote was slander about a person you do not know.

Not to mention the stupid-ism that ""we all know that Fear of the Lord is the end of wisdom.""
That was uncalled for, and not a wise move, but that's not my business, i just wanted to let you know. He doesn't like twists like that, the God you (apparently) don't believe in.

Of course you are allowed to think that I am out of line when we start talking about the ""conspiracy line"", but I dare say, even though it might be foolish of me, that I believe I do know more about that subject than you. I'm glad to hear what you say and perceive so as there isn't any total control upon the freedom of speech and exchange of knowledge (yet), but actually and truly: How often do you see or read in a mainstream media let's say a serious Archaeologist, that get to present the actual proof he has for a Creation, and a great flood?
Just about never, but when it comes to evolution, it's incorporated and full throttle all the way, everywhere. And while we're into the ""Christian""-thing, have you seen ""the Case for Christ""? It's easily found on TPB too..

But to quote you: Why do I bother. Well, I just do. I hope you'll come to grips with both tolerance and bigotry, like you perhaps perceive me as not having enough of. And you're right. I don't. But I'm working on it.

Suppression of the Gnostic ""gospels? Kinda glad you brought it up. Scholars generally agree that these were written at a much later stage than the Gospels of the New Testament, and that they portray a totally different Jesus. And yes; I have read some of them, at least partially, and they're just so far off the Jesus that's being portrayed in the NT, that they almost made me hurl. I'm so glad they're not in there. But you can read them all you want to, and so can anybody. Including Christians. So whee's the oppression on our part? Aaaah.. you are referring to the so called ""Christians"" that rape and pillage and oppress people and lie about it, of course you are. That must be it. I absolutely agree that such persons are dangerous and should be brought to courts by the thousands. But they probably won't be..

In fact, I'd rather see that more Christians DID read and watch a little more of the stuff that differs from the doctrines we have. That way they/we'd be more understanding towards other people instead of alienating them.

So, actually, thanks for the input, but please do refrain from statements like the ones about Mr Gray being ""just another money-machine"" and that twist of the Bible-verse I referred to. Unless you want to stand out as a bigot, that is.

I know I don't want to be perceived in that way, so if what I wrote and will write in the future is perceived like that, I am really sorry. That was not my intention, but I do make mistakes. Lots. But I do also make good things.. :-)

Love from Verifire."
[T],FaeGiN,2009-11-19T11:58Z,"Hey Verifire, this film is highly dubious to say the least!
Credible? I DON'T THINK SO!!!
You have proven to me now that, not only are you living in cloud 9 with your reliance on the whole christian myth, you also believe in *cough cough* the zodiac?
Are you Fucking serious or are you actually a comedy character, cleverly put together by studying all of the current hyperbole conspiracies out there and melding them all into one personality, for the purpose of comedy?
If so then I would have to say WELL DONE!
You are brilliant!!
Made me laugh anyway.
Although it is slightly worrying to see that you have zero sense of humour and act rather like an unemotional, unfeeling automaton."
[T],verifire,2009-11-20T00:28Z,"Well. Since you act like you're the king of the world and are rather obnoxious, I think I will look at your ""comment"" as nothing but spam.

BACK OFF!

Your evaluation of me have taken on a rather personal form of attacking me, and I don't like that. Watch it, tough guy. I'm not the only one who can resonate and read these comments.."
[T],FaeGiN,2009-12-10T12:27Z,"Hey here's one for you:
FUCK OFF MORON.
:)
Aaaah I feel so much better after that.
Nothing like insulting someone who spreads disinformation to the masses to help start the day!"
[T],verifire,2010-01-02T02:16Z,Yes there is.. Ignoring them.. :-)
