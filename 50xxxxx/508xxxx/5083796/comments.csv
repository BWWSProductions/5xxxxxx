Just wondered if there was a problem with the monster 80GB Superman torrent you upped a while ago.  It seems to have stalled at 99% for the past 48 hrs.  "
[M],Ubehage,2009-09-10T15:47Z,"I'm sorry, I have to go offline later tonight.
I will be back tomorrow, and make sure to finish both this one and the Superman-torrent!"
