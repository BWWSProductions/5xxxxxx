The game and crack are 100%, would be helpful if nuke shouters included the reason for the nuke in their post."

,neodubbz,2010-02-27T15:49Z,"i had the same crash issue,i coudnt even get to finish installing the game,but i finally got it to work =) 

1 - first issue,while installin : it said somthing like ""an error ocurred while trying to install some crap.."" any1 having the same error,just select ""ignore"" then copy ""darkestofdays.exe"" inside ""skidrow"" folder that comes with game to your main instalation folder : ""C:\Program Files\8monkey Labs\Darkest of Days""

2 - as for the crash issue,here is what i did: 
go to instalation folder again ""C:\Program Files\8monkey Labs\Darkest of Days"" there should be a folder (physx) open it,and instal the PhysX_9.09.0814_SystemSoftware(latest version),then go back and open another folder (setup),install oalinst.exe , and vcredist_x86.exe.. et voila!!! the game working like a charm! 

im on windows 7 btw."

What's most important is that this torrent is great! Everything is working smoothly! Is the game good or bad depends on your taste,if you like fast action adrenaline first person shooters then off you go!
Just copy SKIDROW contest on mounted image to installed destination and execute oalinst.exe in installed Darkest of days / setup 
folder to prevent pop up error! Enjoy!


Running oalinst.exe solved my game boot error."
,allangb,2010-08-12T10:45Z,to patch the game  I need a new crack?

,hurka79,2011-01-11T19:59Z,"I don't understand! More and more seeders, and the speed is slowly.very slow.shit!

KapjĂĄk be!"
,The77s,2011-02-13T12:25Z,"Anyone figured out how to apply Patch v1.04 and v1.05?

I get a ""Cannot identify this version of Darkest of Days. Either this version has already been patched, or the files are corrupt.""

I've tried it with out the Crack, with the Skidrow Crack, I've tried updating Nvidia PhysX, I've updated everything in the Setup Folder, still no idea how to update it.

It works without the Patch, it's just it's quite clearly poorly optimized, I only get 70FPS on everything High with 2x AA, and it's not that I'm complaining about that, but sometimes I've seen it go down to 45FPS.

Thanks anyhow."
,war_peanut,2011-02-14T20:10Z,"I got the error message ""OpenAL32.dll was not found"" so I went ahead and ran oalinst.exe (like stoleyourshoes and others have suggested) and that worked.

One thing though, when I ran the game for the first time the menu was in German. Wasn't really a problem, I just clicked around in the options and fixed it. I thought I might note it here in case anyone else has a similar problem."
,luxar1226,2011-04-06T02:15Z,anyway to make it run with Windows 7? just crashes when i hit new game
