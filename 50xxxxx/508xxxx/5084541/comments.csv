,BitGod,2009-09-11T16:53Z,Curious: MartinBLCK  - why did you download from FEFE2003 and then upload the same torrent only a few minutes later as your own at 256bit mate???  
[V],MartinBLCK,2009-09-11T23:13Z,@BitGod:  because I want to have both versions - with respect to quality and size.
[V],MartinBLCK,2009-09-11T23:18Z,"btw: it is not (!) the same torrent, mine is constant 256 quality, the other one is variable bit rate."
,Fat_slut,2009-09-20T17:05Z,"This album SUCKS!!
Man this guitar-hero is getting old and boring. Kill To Get Crimson was also boring as hell, but this one makes me sleep.. 
Where is the Dire Straits guitarhero? 
Where are the catching tunes?
I know he is the boss of the band, but someone has got to tell him that he is making crap!"
