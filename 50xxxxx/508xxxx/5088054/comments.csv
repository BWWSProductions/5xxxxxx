Great movie, very original."

But more into the movie the picture was ever and again stuck (while the sound progressed) and then took on again some moments later. I still kept watching and I was very impresed by the film but this was annoying. I don't know if that's just me (rather old laptop, vlc player, izarc?) or if this a general issue so I wanted to share it. What about you?"
