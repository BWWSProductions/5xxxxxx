So the crack is there.
About seeders and leechers - something is wrong with piratebay. There are 4 seeder and 395 leechers - 6.09.2009 on 10:09 Polish time"

Parece que este jogo contem o crack, ele estè°© renomeado de SKIDROW.
Espero ter-de ajudado.

Lately there has appeared 0 seeds and 0 peers because it must be a problem of the site.

It seems that this game contains the crack, it is renamed SKIDROW.
I hope to have helped.
Sorry for my bad English :D

,_fungus,2009-09-06T17:38Z,"seeders & leechers are all there, its just tpb. works fine when you start the d/l. kudos to skidrow for gettin this out so fast."
,StefanGavrila,2009-09-06T23:54Z,"The beta was boring and the final game is boring. Except for the ""burn in"" and the tanks (which are awesome) everything else in this game is generic and the 2 factions have nothing to make them different from one another except for the look of the weapons. Even Quake Wars is better.

Uninstalled after I finished the 1,5 hours campaign."

stupid little things like this..."
