,mission2move,2009-09-09T20:08Z,It'll start seeding shortly.  I uploaded over 50 videos at once and my up is only 1mbit.
,mission2move,2009-09-09T20:39Z,Please seed when finished!  I'm pausing most of the torrents in order to upload a few at a time at a much faster rate - so I can pause them and seed the others.
,VideoRipper,2009-09-10T00:20Z,"NP m8 ;)

I will seed it for a while (once I have it of course)"
,VideoRipper,2009-09-10T03:13Z,"Never mind...

I will get this one instead http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4277549/The_Buggles_-_Video_Killed_The_Radio_Star

Thanks for the effort, though I think it would be better if you'ld start uploading a torrents once you can in the future, not just set it on hold.
