[b]TVRage Description...:[/b] Weeds is about a single mother named Nancy who sells weed for a living. After the death of her husband Judah she had no source of income and decided that was it. To make sure she can continue to do this she buys a shop, which sells "cakes" so her real business is no longer under threat. This idea was brought to Nancy's attention from her pot smoking accountant, Doug. Nancy has two kids, Silas and Shane. Their uncle Andy also lives with them to help support them, although he does a poor job. And of course, the show would not be complete without Nancy's 'friend' Celia, her husband Dean, and their daughter Isabelle who are always somehow getting involved in Nancy's life, usually to Nancy's dismay.

OK, so I was able to figure a work-around and get my files over from one PC to another so I can upload this for you.  For those who are interested in my harrowing tale of woe in which I do battle with my PC and the minions of Microsoft, I think I've isolated the problem to my primary HDD on the PC.  I've installed XP on the secondary HDD, and so far, no BSoD!  Yay!  Hopefully, this means I'll be able to switch out the old HDD and put in a bigger one, as it was just a 300GB.  It would be nice to have 4GB total internal HDD space on my "play" PC, which is where I do most of my converting and such.  Anyways, I've basically left this torrent description the same because it's just Season 2.  If you're looking for Season 1, just click on my username and grab the previous torrent!

If you've never sat down and watched Weeds, you're missing out ... this is probably one of the funniest shows on Television today.  As the description above tells you, it's about a suburban single-mom who has absolutely no job skills and because her husband was up to his eyeballs in debt when he suddenly dropped dead, she chooses to become the biggest pot-dealer in her small SoCal town of Agrestic.  Comedy and drama ensue as Nancy's life and that of her family only complicate matters.  Personally, I can always count on this show to lift my spirits.  And the show actually gets even funnier if you're a little baked.  Enjoy!


Tradition, tradition ... uh, here are a few little "trivia" tidbits I know:
1.  Two of the regulars on the show actually worked together before the show started, though they didn't actually meet in person until the first cast read-through on the pilot.  Alexander Gould (Shane) voiced the title character in Finding Nemo, the little-finned fish, Nemo.  Elizabeth Perkins (Celia) voiced Nemo's mother Coral.  Since the film was animated and most of the cast did their voices in private sound-booth recordings, the two never met.  In a spooky-odd sort of way, Nemo and Coral never met either, in the beginning of the film, Coral is killed by an eel while Nemo is just a fertile egg ... spooky-weird.
2. While "Agrestic" means fields, country, or rural, it is also oddly enough an anagram for "Cigarets".
