,piratailin,2009-10-23T23:08Z,"These tracks sound great to play back on PC or mp3 player. I had considerable difficulty burning them, however. This may not be the original uploader's fault as files can become corrupted over time even when we're all sharing ""identical"" files. Just a heads up."
,mcflurry17,2009-12-13T05:45Z,"Thanks for the kinds words.

Sorry, piratailin, to hear you had problems burning them, I didn't test that before I uploaded the files so I agree with you in saying that it could be the files. Hope you are able to fix your problem."
