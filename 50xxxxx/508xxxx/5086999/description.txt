Some of the banjo roots can be traced all the way back to Africa so I guess something like this was bound to happen. Bela Fleck made a journey to Africa to investigate the banjo's roots and one thing led to another. Fast forward a few years and here is Bela Fleck touring with Toumani Diabate. It couldn't be any other way. Banjo and kora fan? You are in for a treat!

Kudos to original releaser.
