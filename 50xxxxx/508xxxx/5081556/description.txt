Plot:
Khan Kluay II is set after the victory of Ayutthaya against the invasion of the powerful Burmese Empire when Khan Kluay is appointed as King Naresuan's royal elephant and services the king in many battles. But it isn't the end of the war yet when the Burmese Empire determinedly declares more battle. Before Ayutthaya's troop could set the journey to the battlefield, some Burmese soldiers creeping up to Ayutthaya to capture people as their captives, they even kidnap Khan Kluay's wife and children, ChabaKaew, Ton-or and Korkaew. To save his family from danger, Khan Kluay escapes from Ayutthaya to encounter his new adventure and single battle in the land of enemy. This is the biggest mission for Khan Kluay to challenge.
