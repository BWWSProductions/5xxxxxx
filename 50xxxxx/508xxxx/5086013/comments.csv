,unfairy,2009-09-21T07:25Z,"Suuure, be sarcastic. I'm just making sure I don't become liable for what people do with this file."
,ProphetTheGrey,2009-10-06T21:53Z,Any idea on whether this will work on a burned disc instead of USB loader?
,unfairy,2009-10-07T18:07Z,"It should, but I don't know how all that works. Just extract the *.rar and burn it. If your Wii is set up to play burned games it should work like that from what I hear.

The filesize is so small because it's been compressed."
,TTDLER,2009-10-15T00:12Z,Trying to load on my Wii w/Wiikey2 gives a black screen. Ideas? 
,crook16 ,2009-10-17T03:51Z,not only am i not going to delete it but im going to resell burnt copies of it in mexico  HA!
,Timewarptwo,2009-11-09T06:45Z,"Is this a USB Loader: http://wbfsmanager.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=26808

I was told to put this on a flash drive then iso files and the Wii would read the files. I am very new at this"
,demonparia,2010-04-10T03:34Z,"Oh, yeah. That certainly won't make you liable."
,grmmripper,2010-07-07T22:26Z,"Am I the only one who actually doesnt pirate these games? I actually do have this on disc, and I just hacked my Wii a few days ago. When I extract it from my disc and try to play on USBLoaderGX I get a DSI error."
,stumpy2006,2010-09-01T09:05Z,"Works Like a charm. Great game, love the series to death :)"
,NecroFile,2011-02-28T13:11Z,"Unfairy: No matter what you put in the description to save your ass, putting this file up is still illegal, and it is also illegal for anyone, even those who own a legitimate copy of the game, to download this file.

But I'm cool with breaking the law. I smoke weed."
,sexybrina,2011-06-07T21:24Z,"Had so much fun playing the first on GC I must try this, seems to work good, Thanks a lot for uploading"
,energico,2011-06-25T00:02Z,"downloaded the entire thing in about 2 minutes, ripped it and it works well on my emulator. i havent played it yet but it runs. there might be some minor graphical errors, but seems to run smoothly"
,chedderB,2011-07-21T10:06Z,"works great on softmod 4.3u usbloaderGX
I see there are no seeders. I will seed again for a little while. Please eveyone seed you uploads at a max speed and seed files that need be seeded. I love this community
-cheers"
,unfairy,2011-09-07T11:42Z,"I'm not concerned with legality, I'm concerned with pukes putting annoying anti-piracy comments on my torrents."
,stregs,2011-12-31T06:44Z,"yes, isnt it funny they come here for pirated software movies and games, yet put anti-pirating comments on your torrent? i had to make an account just to say that. and it was every bit worth it."
,Sivos,2012-01-04T23:10Z,"@unfairy Welcome to the internet, where they tear you down and bash you for a misplaced word.  Just watch what you say if you don't want insults."
,docjomalley,2012-03-15T05:08Z,Sadly doesnt work on dolphin :/
,PirateEm,2012-05-15T05:22Z,"@Docjo
you're definitely doing something wrong because I can run it on Dolphin without any issues whatsoever.

The game runs awesome on dolphin.

The only issues I encountered was some minor slowdown upon leaving your house and on the catalog, there are these yellow backgrounds that shouldn't be there.

I think it's due to it being a backup rather than the original as another torrent with a similar upload mentioned such.

Nonetheless, these problems are so minor that it doesn't harm the gameplay.


Anyways, thanks for the upload unfairy.
But if you don't want people pirating this then you shouldn't have put it up on the PIRATE bay. :"
,Mag0man,2012-07-08T17:03Z,Game works perfectly for now on my Softmodded Wii =D Usb loader GX Loads it fast from my external HDD. Thx M8!
,goeva,2012-07-26T21:07Z,Works perfectly. Thanks for the game.
