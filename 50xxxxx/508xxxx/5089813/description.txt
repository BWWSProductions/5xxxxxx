Alice Cooper ( born Vincent Damon Furnier; February 4, 1948 ) is an American rock singer, songwriter and musician whose career spans more than four decades. With a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, boa constrictors and baby dolls, Cooper has drawn equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a grandly theatrical and violent brand of heavy metal that was designed to shock.

Muscle of Love, released in 1973 is the last studio album recorded by the original Alice Cooper band, and is a concept album about teenage angst, life on the streets of New York City, and implied male prostitution.
In place of the usual jacket, the original LP was packaged in a shallow corrugated cardboard carton, as if the carton contained something other than a record, with a "stain" intentionally printed along the bottom. The original release also included a paper "book-cover" with Teen-Age Lament '74 theme and an illustration of the band in pink and white.
The track "Man with the Golden Gun" was going to be to be the title song to the James Bond film of the same name, until the producers decided against this. "Teenage Lament '74" features Liza Minnelli on background vocals.
