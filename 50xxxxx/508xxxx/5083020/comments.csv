,D0gmeat,2009-09-09T13:26Z,"Thanks!

BTW, if you've already downloaded the original release, you don't need to get this repack. The original had an installer that puton  an extra desktop icon that's not needed. but otherwise there was nothing wrong with that release.
"
,Lito602,2009-09-09T15:19Z,"I have an error on the previous version. Couldnt find a dll file, a copied it in but didnt work anyhow.

Well i dont know about the REPACK."
,thefret,2009-09-09T17:33Z,can you upload the PhysXLoader.dll deleted demo. thanks
,deBeauharnais,2009-09-09T17:56Z,"Well... Since one week, every torrent has 0 seeder and 0 leecher... What is happening?? Who can explain? I can no more download anything..."
,Ashenz,2009-09-09T19:43Z,"MidgardViking, make sure that you have WinXP SP3 installed. They said it's necessary for the game. Otherwise, my rig is even worse than yours (AMD 64 3200+, ATI 3800 HD, 2 Gb RAM) and I hope it can run the game anyway."
,Ashenz,2009-09-09T19:48Z,Then the missing SP3 is not the case. Maybe there are compatibility problems with Win7? I really don't know... Good luck!
,MBenjo,2009-09-10T18:04Z,"Well I got such an old rig...

AMD Athlon XP 2800+
1GB RAM
NVidia GeForce 7600GT
WinXP SP2

...but I could complete the demo without a crash."
,DikkatDeliVar,2009-09-10T20:42Z,"According to the original game forums, you need to download the newest PhysX drivers. PhysX_9.09.0814_SystemSoftware.exe is for Nvidia cards, which can be acquired from nvidia site. However there are reports that the Steam and directtodrive versions of the game is corrupted, and game cannot be completed. 
AiTB, can you tell please which version is that one?"

,lolwut11234,2009-09-14T18:02Z,"I d/l and installed fine but when I go to run to the game it tells me that OpenAL32.dll was not found, how do i fix this?"
,lolwut11234,2009-09-14T18:15Z,I fixed it nvm.
,Weedmonster,2009-09-14T23:30Z,"doesnt work
Tested on amd +5300   nvid 9800gt   4gig ram"
,Mantard,2009-09-17T00:02Z,"Hi, I had the New-game error too, like the game crashes and says the program needs to...blah blah blah...but thats often because you have your adaptive anti alaising enabled, go to your catalysc controlcenter and disable it (or was it the catalysc AI? dun remember) and now you can play:D"
,everfrag,2009-09-19T04:35Z,"worked for me, didn't even have to change any settings, may tweak later, updated my direct X, not that it should have needed to, and installed Phys X itself. very cool game"

,aljazo,2009-09-21T19:49Z,"hey, lolwut11234

how did u fix this problem? it happens to me too. what do I do??"
,hercthemerc,2009-09-22T03:24Z,"I dled this, put in the crack and i crashed so i dled this

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5084081/Darkest.of.Days.Crash-FIX

and i never crashed since.

This game is good, i reccomend it"
,iBleedFuchsia,2009-09-25T06:08Z,"If you're experiencing the OpenAL32.dll error, go to the setup folder in your install directory, which is most likely C:\Program Files\8monkey Labs\Darkest of Days\setup and run the OpenAL installer (oalinst).

This will allow you to run the game, but you will most likely be presented with the crashing issue. Download the latest PhysX software and this should fix the issue.

Hope that I was of some assistance. "
,Chibicho,2009-10-01T01:25Z,"Ok When I started this I got
""Steam Error"" Application load error 5:00000(yada yada) "" I forgot, sue me. 
Anyways 
HOW I FIXED THIS. go into the Drive, that you mounted it to, and go to the ""Contents"" folder. Inside you'll find the .exe.

Simply copy the .exe from the disc to the actual folder with your game in it.

Enjoy"
,FearedMerc,2009-10-04T08:35Z,"Chibico,
what do u mean when u said ""go into the Drive, that you mounted it to""? i have this error and i dont know what im supposed to do...."
,blueeyes82,2009-10-04T20:44Z,Chibicho i got the same error how do i fix it... i dont know where the contents folder is
,FearedMerc,2009-10-05T01:15Z,"hey blueeyes,
i found out what to do.
1. open the TORRENT FILE.(the one with all the winrar crap in it. i opened it with winrar)
2. look for the exe file that says darkestofdays.exe
3. extract that file to the your darkest of days folder (program files>8monkeylabs>darkestofdays.

Hope this helps... Good Luck!"
,deathpuppet16,2009-10-07T00:09Z,"Hi, i'm having trouble with the new game issue.  When i hit the button the game loads for lik 2 seconds and then crashes.  I'm wondering what my problem is.  I don't think its my rig, because it can run anything specs wise. I also tried downloading three different torrents of this game, so this one isn't the problem.  I get the microsoft general error, and when i click on more information i get this 
AppName: darkestofdays.exe	 AppVer: 0.0.0.0	 ModName: unknown
ModVer: 0.0.0.0	 Offset: 00000000

I really don't know what that means, but i have a quad core processor, 3 gigs of ram on a xp, and have an nvidia (something, but its newer) and a x-fi sound blaster.  

If anyone knows a solution i'd be glad to hear it. Also, sorry for the long post lol, but i have needs of an answer.
Thanks!"
,dethraptor,2009-11-03T17:11Z,"know how to solve the crash-while-new-game problem. Go here and dl / install this.

http://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload-March2009/confirmation.php?url=/Windows/8.09.04/PhysX_8.09.04_SystemSoftware.exe‚å©=us&type=Other

Then go here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5084081/Darkest.of.Days.Crash-FIX

And dl / install that. This should work, as it did for me. Good Luck!"
,Nemo89,2010-01-08T17:19Z,"F..k ! This game cannot be finished due to repeating crash, and cannot be patched due to checksum error when you try to install a patch! F.....g frustrating!"
,neodubbz,2010-02-27T15:59Z,"iBleedFuchsia is right :
i had the same crash issue,i coudnt even get to finish installing the game,but i finally got it to work =) 

1 - first issue,while installin : it said somthing like ""an error ocurred while trying to install some crap.."" any1 having the same error,just select ""ignore"" then copy ""darkestofdays.exe"" inside ""skidrow"" folder that comes with game to your main instalation directory  by default ""C:\Program Files\8monkey Labs\Darkest of Days""

2 - as for the crash issue,here is what i did: 
go to instalation directory again ""C:\Program Files\8monkey Labs\Darkest of Days"" there should be a folder (physx) open it,and instal the PhysX_9.09.0814_SystemSoftware(latest version),then go back and open another folder (setup),install oalinst.exe , and vcredist_x86.exe.. et voila!!! the game working like a charm! 

im on windows 7 btw. "
,animetrooper,2010-03-07T19:29Z,Thanks very fast download !! I am installing it now and I hope it will work
,animetrooper,2010-03-07T19:53Z,"Ok i figured out the steam error crap. All you have to do is open up the iso file and double click on the ""skidrow"" file and copy the exe into the game folder and replace it and then run the game"
,asia_rules,2010-03-21T14:33Z,"It runs smoothly even on higher settings i get around 50-60fps but it crashes/freezes????????????????? what could be the reason?????

help this poor soul :("

,The77s,2011-02-13T12:28Z,"Anyone figured out how to apply Patch v1.04 and v1.05?

I get a ""Cannot identify this version of Darkest of Days. Either this version has already been patched, or the files are corrupt.""

I've tried it with out the Crack, with the Skidrow Crack, I've tried updating Nvidia PhysX, I've updated everything in the Setup Folder, still no idea how to update it.

It works without the Patch, it's just it's quite clearly poorly optimized, I only get 70FPS on everything High with 2x AA, and it's not that I'm complaining about that, but sometimes I've seen it go down to 45FPS.

Thanks anyhow."
