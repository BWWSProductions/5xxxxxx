This is my first Open-ITG release. It is based on the beta 2 release of the OpenITG (http://openitg.com)

Song Packs included with this release (collected from many sources):

In the Groove
In the Groove 2
In the Groove 3
In The Groove 3 OG (Open Groove)
In The Groove Rebirth
Pro Pack 1.1
Missing Arcade Songs

obs. The charts of ITG, ITG 2 are the ones from the PC release not the arcade ones 
(except the Missing Arcade Songs).

Unrar, plug in your dance pad (mine working, Positive Gaming Impacta Dance Mat), configure it, and dance!
*Should* work with other dancepads also

This release is "factory" default. You can set it to "Event mode" by going to "Options"->"Arcade Options"
Obs. After setting the "Event mode" you can acces "Options" by pressing the "Scroll Lock" button on your keyboard

To configure you pad go to "Options"->"Config key/Joy mappings"

To set you resolution go to "Options"->"Display Options"
Obs. After making this release counld'nt change my resolution, maybe because of my crossfire setup. Dunno.

Please if you have any problems DONT ask me, I just put these things together, I am NOT the developer.

Have fun and enjoy.

Ah, and no, this does not requiere any serial at all :D
