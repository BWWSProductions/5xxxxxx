"Jet City Woman" is a song by progressive metal band QueensrÃ¿che appearing on their 1990 album Empire.

The song talks about coming home to family after a long road trip. "Jet City" is a nickname for Seattle, the band's hometown.

Empire is the fourth full-length album by QueensrÃ¿che, released on August 21, 1990. The power ballad "Silent Lucidity" was a cross-over hit, reaching #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and #9 on the Billboard Hot 100, which helped the album reach triple-platinum status. The songs "Jet City Woman", "Della Brown", and "Another Rainy Night (Without You)" create a miniature concept album within the first half of "Empire," as they are linked by audio effects that bring the listener from one audio background to another seamlessly. "Empire" could arguably be included within this series, as the song begins with voices on an answering machine (as are also used in "Another Rainy Night"), though its subject is more of a stretch to relate.

QueensrÃ¿che (pronounced /ËˆkwiËnzraÉªk/) is an American heavy metal / progressive metal band formed in 1981 in Bellevue, Washington. The band has released ten studio albums and several EPs and DVDs and continues to tour and record.

QueensrÃ¿che has been relatively successful in the progressive scene, having sold over 20 million albums worldwide including over 6 million albums in the United States.
