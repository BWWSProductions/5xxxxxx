Sort of Connie Francis meets Tiny Tim meets
Ken Dodd meets the pub singer you know whose
testicles have not yet descended meets the 
sister of your best mate who likes to howl
during her self flagellation routines meets
the worst ever American Idol auditionee
meets the woman at the supermarket check-out
who thinks she is just waiting to be
discovered meets the only singing baboon
ever discovered and brought into captivity
by an insane naturalist who thinks that he
himself does a mean karaoke rendition of all
the songs ever recorded by Pinky & Perky...and
they have all got together met Salvador Dali now
live with Salvador Dali and have had a strange
experience on the Road to Damascus.

You what?  I don't know either.


Bollocks.
