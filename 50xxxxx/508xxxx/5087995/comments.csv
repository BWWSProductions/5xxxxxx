,vaquero_99,2009-09-14T16:33Z,"As usual, a BIG thank you for this!!"
,Nokque,2009-09-15T04:25Z,"Huge thanks to darmeth and to all the folks who make this quality F1 coverage available to those of us who have none.

batega, given that so many folks put in such effort to help others see F1, it's staggering that a mean spirited, good for nothing little shit would get his rocks off by trying to spoil it for others. All of us who say thanks to darmeth send a big 'fuck you' your way as well. But I guess that's what a nasty little anti-social troll like you is looking for, isn't it? There you go."
