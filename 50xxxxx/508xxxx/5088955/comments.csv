Este torrent es el mismo que ya esta en Frances?

    Developed exclusively for Xbox 360 by acclaimed developer Bungie, 
    ?Halo 3: ODST? is a new game in the ?Halo? saga that lets people experience 
    events leading up to the epic story told in ?Halo 3? through the eyes of an 
    ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Trooper), as they search for clues leading to the 
    whereabouts of their scattered squad and the motivations behind the Covenant?s
    invasion of New Mombasa. The release adds a new dimension to an all-encompassing 
    universe that gamers around the world have known and loved for close to eight
    years. ?Halo 3: ODST? also introduces Firefight, a new cooperative multiplayer*
    mode where up to four players can assume the role of an ODST squad and fight
    together to take on increasingly challenging waves of enemies. Also included 
    are three new ?Halo 3? multiplayer maps on a 2nd standalone disc, which includes 
    all original ?Halo 3? maps, as well as the ?Legendary,? ?Heroic,? and ?Mythic? 
    Map packs for a total of 24 maps. * Xbox LIVE Gold account required for online 
    multiplayer gameplay

   This is the retail and not some dubious p2p source with foreign speech 
   and missing half of the game !

,Gethyper,2009-09-15T06:52Z,"Disc 1 ? Campaign Disc

- Nieuwe single player campagne
- Nieuwe ODST co-op mode: Firefight

,XboxMicke,2009-09-15T17:47Z,"I can se that this is the real game, but can you play it online after the realiese, and still not get banned, ive had a flashed xbox for several years and played almost every game online, i mean alot, i haven't even heard anything from microsoft.

So de question is is it safe after release to play online"

Ive been playing PAL region free games on my NTSC system for 2 years now. I can say for sure that they work using any HD setting over 480 (ie 720, 1080, using component, vga, or hdmi)
...ive got 3 360s now lol.
I dont think theyll work on SDTV tho. just a theory tho.
cause pal and ntsc are different video standards, but HDTV is all the same. 
one standard to rule them all..."
,siwrath,2009-09-16T10:50Z,Possemaster- bring it on bitch. ive been playing this game offline an other game online. its called hiding your games played list

,devoidx,2009-09-16T15:35Z,"@posse   

yes achievements get the date, and yes playing online before the release date will get you banned. that is why you unplug the network cable, and set the date on the machine to a future date, like sept 22. that way you got the achievement on the 22nd ! reset the date when it is the 22nd, and go online, and have fun. "
,backsidecan,2009-09-16T18:08Z,do you need a modded box for this?

Well played, thats what i did with guitar hero 3 rock band ninja gaiden 2 and halo 3.
worked pretty good so far :D"
,deadpirate23,2009-09-18T07:31Z,Is anybody else getting disc unreadable errors on the first disc? I've burnt it twice and it still gives me an error every time.
,THATPURPP,2009-09-18T07:41Z,i took awhile for my xbox to read disc 1. anyone else having that problem? maybe my memorex discs are finally failing me.
,siwrath,2009-09-19T00:42Z,can comfirm this game works perfectly offline.havent tested online just waiting til after 22nd which is wise
,saada245,2009-09-19T09:25Z,"This game works!! You can play the campaign offline and firefight offline, i don't recommend playing them online. On disk 2 it is pretty much Halo 3 with just all the new map packs, so I just played all the Halo 3 maps and not the ODST maps.   "
,gsa13,2009-09-19T23:23Z,"Both discs works perfectly fine. AGBX can't verify but it still works. For safety precautions, I disconnected the internet to my xbox.

This game rocks! Thanks Morck22!!
