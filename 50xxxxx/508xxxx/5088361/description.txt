Don't be fooled by the "low" bit rate, the quality is VERY DAMN GOOD, since mono doesn't use a lot of space like stereo would.

No covers or anything else is included, just the tracks. Also the extra stereo mixes from "HELP" and "Rubber Soul" have been removed to save space. Everything here is mono only!
