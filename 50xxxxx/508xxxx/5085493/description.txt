Massive Attack is back with an EP containing four new songs, two of which are remixed. If you notice on the track list, all the songs feature a guest vocalist, such as TV on the Radioâ€™s Tunde Adebimpe. Horce Andy guest-vocals on â€œSplitting The Atom,â€ a chilly, yet intriguing track that premiered on BCC Radio 1 August 25. 
Virgin will release Massive Attackâ€™s EP, Splitting the Atom, October 5, 2009. They will do a physical, digital and vinyl release of the record simultaneously.
