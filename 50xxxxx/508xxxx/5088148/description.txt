NHL 10 features more than 200 gameplay refinements that replicate the skill and finesse of hockey, spectacular new ways to score, and improved goaltender intelligence. Winning one-on-one battles for possession of the puck along the boards is now a test of will and skill. Utilizing an all-new board physics engine, players can use their body to shield the puck on the boards and kick-pass it to teammates. Watch bigger, stronger players pin opponents to the boards while fanatical fans bang the glass, just like real life. Grab and tug an opponentâ€™s jersey to land the punch that ignites the fans and sparks your team to victory. Prove you are tough enough to quiet the crowd, silence the opposition and survive a playoff run to lift the Stanley Cup!
