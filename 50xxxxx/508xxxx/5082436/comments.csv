,trickdaddy0024,2009-09-09T07:07Z,Back from Vacation is Dumbo Limbaugh who just pulled his script out of babyboo's ass...Dumbo is the  biggest liar on radio...But this does not matter to the zombie followers...Like I've said b4...Anyone could pull Dumbo's mp3 six months ago and hear the same hate speech now but just with some news updates...People dont listen to Dumbo for facts...this could only be Entertain becuz of a lost election....END
,booboo332,2009-09-09T07:27Z,"Welcome back whiny-pants.  Are you going to keep blaming discord within Democrat party on the Republicans and talk radio?

Old tune, dude.  The Demo-scats have a majority in the house and senate and blaming others is the typical, tired bullshit we have come to expect from them.

Also, If anyone is repeating the same weak talking points over and over, it is you."

Obviously, babyboo is a Dumbo's ass kisser and is reading a Republican talking point said by many conservatives...So, Babyboo u have not said anything new or original but still ur bitter I know....""Back from Vacation is Dumbo Limbaugh who just pulled his script out of babyboo's ass"", is what i've said and shows ur can be baited easily so what else do u have?...END"
,ItBitTorrent,2009-09-09T17:18Z,"booboo just ignore the trolls. To read their posts is a wast of time and to respond a bigger waste. 
Stay positive and let them suffocate in their on vitriol."
,booboo332,2009-09-09T20:25Z,Oh little trick you are just too easy.  BTW who ever said I was a conservative?
,ItBitTorrent,2009-09-09T21:55Z,"The fact you frequent this torrent and took a dig at the dems in an earlier post suggests you were conservative.
Bottom line.... I don't care.
Perhaps I should heed my own advice and pass on commenting here altogether.  
It's kind of like a train wreck you can't avoid looking at.
Peace out."
,booboo332,2009-09-09T23:18Z,"IBT,  peace be with you, bud.  Some conservatives do piss me off sometimes but for the most part they are decent folks and are a hell of a lot easier to deal with than the many flavors of statists.  Republicans however . . . 

I doubt jwhitt has little love for me or my harassing comments but thanks to him for his posts nonetheless.  I think Rush is full of shit a lot of the time but he is still the master of his craft and is a great host.

As for Little Trick, I just can't help poking holes in the gas bags facade.  It is getting a little too easy though."

,booboo332,2009-09-10T21:57Z,Try again Little Trick.  You are even easier than I originally thought.
