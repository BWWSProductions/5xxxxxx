Synopsis: Good writers of all kinds rely on basic observations about human nature. This is especially true in comedy, and thatâ€™s exactly what makes GOLIATH hilarious. A bare-bones production, itâ€™s a study in economical storytelling that lives up to its name in laughs. Beginning with the opening photo montage of a man, his cat, and the scratched-out face of his soon-to-be ex-wife, GOLIATH ripples with insights into the human conditionspecifically, the condition of a man working in a dead-end job, going through a divorce, and coping with a missing cat. The plot of the film is secondary, however, to the comical moments sprinkled throughout. Finding humor in the trimming of a moustache, the signing of divorce papers, and the inane lunchroom banter of coworkers, brothers David and Nathan Zellner show they are as perceptive as they are funny. With many prior shorts at CineVegas, they return with a feature that is simultaneously deadpan, stark, strange, realistic, and amusing.
