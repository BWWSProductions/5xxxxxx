"Better" is a song by Regina Spektor. Three versions of this song are known. First, the version that appears on her 2006 album Begin to Hope. The second version is a re-recorded radio re-cut and third version is called "Better (Piano & Voice cut)," which is simply the re-cut version, only with the piano and Regina's voice.

The Strokes-guitarist Nick Valensi played guitar on the track.

There are two known music videos for "Better". The first one is quite low budget, and features Regina in front of a TV-set. The second one is a music video for the radio re-cut, where we see Regina in a black dress, while Regina look-a-likes start to dance around her.

"Better" was covered by Dashboard Confessional on the 2007 covers album "The Wire Tapes Vol. 1." It is the eleventh and final track.

Begin to Hope is the fourth album by Russian-American singer-songwriter, Regina Spektor. It was released June 13, 2006. The album debuted at number 70 on the Billboard 200, but due to the popularity of the single "Fidelity", it peaked at number 20 and was labeled a "pace setter" by Billboard. Rolling Stone magazine named it the 21st-best album of 2006. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA for shipments to U.S. retailers of 500,000 units.

The album was nominated for the 2007 Shortlist Music Prize.
