,segersta,2009-09-16T08:37Z,Read this http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/188779017/3-o-fun before you do anything.
,wantsToBeFree,2009-09-17T05:48Z,"I also had my cell service (AT&T, so no unlock) quit working after trying to use this with OS 3.1 on my 3G.  Gave up on the jailbreak and just used the official update to fix it.  But those who jailbreak because they require the unlock may want to be prepared for this possibility."
,andy72184,2009-09-17T12:30Z,"OK listen just check cydia page click Upgrading to 3.1? Read This periodically and wait for them to confirm you can unlock and jailbreak 3.1.  

Just to be safe.
Other then that, this is a load of crap torrent so I hear."

,sundazed,2009-09-20T00:42Z,"Sorry to see people are having problems with this. It jailbroke and upgraded my 2G iPhone absolutely fine. The only problem I had was getting iTunes 9 to load the newly created firmware ('alt+restore' not 'restore'!). Everything else was, and is, groovy. Thank you."
,andy72184,2009-09-20T08:40Z,"@TOTTITORKY wont be any time soon, stick with 3.01 it still works"
,ChrisCrossMacBook,2009-09-20T19:43Z,"As anyone successfully done this with a unibody MacBook? Last time I tried to jailbreak my iPhone, I needed to download a patch so OS X would recognize the phone DFU mode and it screwed up my computer and I needed to re-install the OS. "
,ChrisCrossMacBook,2009-09-20T19:43Z,I'm running Snow Leopard btw.

,andy72184,2009-09-27T10:36Z,"@ChrisCrossMacBook bullshit you can't fuck up an OS X with the iPhone nor anything, you're just too fucking retarded to know what the fuck you are doing."
,sundazed,2009-09-27T18:40Z,"Hey! andy72184 ! Go and fuck yourself. You should be able to work out how without too much problem as you seem to know everything. Foul-mouthed aggressive arsehole. We don't need people like you. If you don't like what you see here, go somewhere else. Bye."
