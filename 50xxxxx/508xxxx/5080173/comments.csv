Remove these noobs their VIP status, for as long as needed until they learn NOT TO WRITE EVERY SINGLE MOVIE INTO 1's DESCRIPTION JUST TO MAKE IT RUIN SEARCH FEATURE (they pop up if word ur searching is mentioned in his description)

AND YES, THEY WILL LEARN WHEN THEY SEE VIP STATUS GONE AND WONDER WHY AND READ FEW POSTS.

Sry for caps, but thisway it gets noticed bit better perhaps..
And thanks in advance to making search work again hopefully."
