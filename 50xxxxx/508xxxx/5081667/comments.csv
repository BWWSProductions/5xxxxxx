,AsssKisser666,2009-09-08T00:45Z,both the .rar & .r00 file are corrupted for me. And this is on two separate torrents. So this needs to be fixed by STRANGE? 
,Hails592,2009-09-08T12:34Z,"asskisser is a retard, ignore him! hes put the same comment on all the other dirt 2 torrents, tosser!"
,chuchunesme,2009-09-08T17:31Z,"I'm also having a problem, when I go to unrar the files I'm getting errors and it never finishes. I only downloaded this specific torrent so I'm not sure about the others. For the record, I've gotten approx 30 other games off here and had no issues with any of the others."
,dynapacker,2009-09-08T20:01Z,Same for me. File corrupt. What to do Hails592? Seems that you have no problem unraring it
