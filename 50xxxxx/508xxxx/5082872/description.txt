The Ring is a 1927 British, silent, black and white film directed and written by Alfred Hitchcock. The story focused on a love triangle between two men and a woman. It is the only film in his career for which Hitchcock took or was given a full writing credit. The film, while widely considered a minor work, features photography tricks Hitchcock would use again years later in films like The Man Who Knew Too Much, most notably during the climactic boxing sequences.
