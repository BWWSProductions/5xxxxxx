This is my first torrent. ;-)"
,mikexxxryan,2009-09-13T06:41Z,"No problem.  88 seeds now.  Again, big thanks to you for coming to the aid of the Mac community.  This is why I am a Mac fan!  Best wishes to you!  The file should stay seeded on its own now!"
,albinoz,2009-09-13T12:34Z,Thanks

,tsam19,2009-09-13T15:29Z,"This isn't version 4.2 - its version 4.1 !

Read the - DiskWarrior Read Me.rtf in the DMG file

The real version should be 'rev 909' according to the website.

,tsam19,2009-09-13T16:06Z,"Disregard last comment - it is Version 4.2

Doh !"
,mikexxxryan,2009-09-13T18:48Z,"I am able to update my 4.1 app to 4.2 but unable to boot from the DW files burned to disk.  It comes up as a bootable option onscreen but never does boot (wheel just spins). I've tried making two disks using different optical drives. Has anyone else been successful making a bootable CD and then actually booting to it?  The ability to boot may require a direct image rather then a (dmg) copy.

Still, for my purposes this solved my problem.  If you read the Mac forums you'll see that Alsoft is the worst software maker when it comes to customer support.  After two weeks of trying to get their update program to work and many emails and faxes many of us have been duly ignored."

MacBookPro3,1

  Processor Speed:	2.2 GHz
  Number Of Processors:	1
  Total Number Of Cores:	2
  L2 Cache:	4 MB
  Memory:	4 GB"
,mikexxxryan,2009-09-15T02:17Z,"Yeah, I'm on a 3.2GHz Mac Pro with 16G Ram and 8TB internal HDs.  The boot option key gives three boot options and two work but the third, the DW boot, fails.  I'm pretty sure the files from an image must be burned to CD.  Something about the Mac kernel requirement.  

Bummer... :-("
[T],frankie-boy,2009-09-15T20:04Z,I burned a DVD. Did you try a CD?
,tsam19,2009-09-16T12:59Z,"This DMG is compressed & when uncompressed is 1.25gb, so it won't fit onto any CD !

I used the Macbook's  'Disk Utilty' program to burn this dmg image straight to DVD, once 'disk utility' verifies...then...

Leave the disc in the machine + re boot + immediately hold down the 'C' key before the Apple logo appears & the DVD disc will boot up in its own time !"
,eguatpatto,2009-09-19T06:18Z,"Thanks a million valdoit, great upload. Works 100%"
,Bernie.au,2009-09-29T04:07Z,"For those of us that have upgraded to 10.6 this is a blessing.........Thanks Valdoit, ur great mate !!"
,bufori,2009-10-23T00:17Z,Anyone plan on uploading rev909?
,bufori,2009-10-23T00:27Z,Or is this rev909 and just mislabeled?
,Sonny788,2010-01-24T01:09Z,Does This Work On Snow Leopard
,syriaccjoseph,2010-05-01T18:46Z,"Does not boot in my mac. iMac late 2009.
