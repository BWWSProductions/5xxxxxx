Belle and Sebastian highlighted the adventures of a young boy named Sebastian, his Pyrenean mountain dog, Belle, and the little puppy he carried in his pocket, Poochie. Sebastian was searching desperately for his mother, Isobelle, and his journeys took him throughout Spain, Andorra, and France. It was an animated version of an earlier series, Belle et SÃ©bastien, based on a book by author CÃ©cile Aubry.
