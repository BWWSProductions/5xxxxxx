Synopsis.

That Hamilton Woman | UK | 1941 | Directed by Alexander Korda
                                  
One of cinemaâ€™s most dashing duos, real-life spouses Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier live their greatest on-screen romance in this visually dazzling tragic love story from legendary producer-director Alexander Korda. Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars of the late eighteenth century, That Hamilton Woman is a gripping account of the scandalous adulterous affair between the British Royal Navy officer Lord Horatio Nelson and the renowned beauty Emma, Lady Hamilton, the wife of a British ambassador. With its grandly designed sea battles and formidable star performances, That Hamilton Woman (Winston Churchillâ€™s favorite movie, which he claimed to have seen over eighty times) brings history to vivid, glamorous life.
