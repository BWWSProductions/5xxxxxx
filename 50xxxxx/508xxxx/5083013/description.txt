Story : 
................After experiencing several major wars, people have finally obtained peace. However, they are unable to appreciate peace without contemplating war and death from a safe distance. Therefore, they make a show business out of war. In this staged war, those who must fight each other are children called â€œKilldreâ€. They remain forever young until they die in the sky.

Kannami Yuichi is stationed at Uris, a frontline base in Europe. He has no memories of the past prior to arriving there, but he knows he is a Killdre, and knows how to operate a fighter.

Yuichiâ€™s ability is soon acknowledged and he becomes an ace pilot. Then, he meets a girl, Kusanagi Suito, a commander of the base, who is also a Killdre and used to be an ace pilot as well. Although they are meeting for the first time, they feel as if they had known each other for a long time and soon they become close. However, one day, she asks him a surprising thing: â€œCan you kill me? Otherwise, we cannot escape from all this.â€

A word about the Movie : This movie is one of the master pieces of Oshii's direction. He tries to make you think and doesnâ€™t hand you every piece of info, you have to look for answers, and trust me, theyâ€™re here. The plot isnâ€™t weak at all, but you can agree or not if itâ€™s well presented. And I presonally felt that ,interior scenes with their beautiful hand drown backgrounds definitely left a bigger impression on me than the cg dogfight scenes.

Do remember "there are no bad apples here"
