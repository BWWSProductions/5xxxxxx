I tried every emulator, it just renders a black screen."
,ShineEyes,2009-09-11T19:11Z,"I'm using the latest SVN release of Desmume, not sure if that would make a difference.  It plays 100% flawlessly for me."

,majca,2009-09-12T13:16Z,works on DSTT (dunno about DSTTi though).

,s___amson,2009-09-14T11:54Z,"""Cannot read data. Please turn power off and reinsert the DS card"".

Using M3DSS English version 1.07.

Any help?"
,Zell65,2009-09-15T13:11Z,"Tested and working on NO$GBA.

For those with the cannot read data message: you have to open the emulation setup and change the ""NDS Cartridge Backup Media"" to EEPROM 64Kbytes."
,Zell65,2009-09-15T13:12Z,"The above should work for any other emulator with a similar option by the way, just change the backup from Flash to EEPROM, and you're good to go, you'll know you did it right when pressing start on the title screen gives you a proper menu."
,spankbot,2009-09-16T01:52Z,Works fine on CycloDS Evo
,ster77,2009-09-16T02:33Z,game crashes when you enter the ollar store
,mangomush,2009-09-17T08:49Z,Got it working with the DeSmuME version for which neuralzen provided the link.
,mangomush,2009-09-17T08:50Z,THANKS SHINEEYES!!!!! and neuralzen!!
,NetNigga187,2009-09-18T04:28Z,I'm trying this with the link to Desmume given by neuralzen but when I run it it lags out like crazy.  Any ideas as to why?
,mshades,2009-09-19T03:15Z,"Just to share - if you're getting the ""Cannot read data"" error using an older R4DS, go here and get the v. 1.18 kernel. Copy, paste, and you're good.

,ShineEyes,2009-10-14T06:10Z,Glad it's working well for everyone :D I wish Piratebay had some alert system for people commenting on your torrents so I could have responded sooner.
,000032589,2009-10-19T06:07Z,It seems that on my r4sdhc I can do thing on this scribblenauts that can't be done on the consumer version like use electric chiar on a corpes and ride a t-rex

,Mallred,2009-12-13T03:47Z,Ok so I'm using a DS ONE Super Card and I copied the file onto the card but when I try to start the game it just shows double white screens and nothing loads.

Like mentioned above by Zell65, make sure to:
Open the emulation setup and change the ""NDS Cartridge Backup Media"" to EEPROM 64Kbytes. "
,m4rt1,2011-05-31T03:56Z,"Works perfect with in my dsi, with R4i Revolution. Thanks!"
