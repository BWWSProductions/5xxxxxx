Sorry for the late upload!

Please be advised that I had a CRC-error on the original disc!
I had to recover the data from it and make a new DVD.
It works on my DVD player and my Computer, however I can't guarantee that it will work on your setup.
The race is complete, and the first interviews are also there, after that is stops.

I'm sorry for this F**k-up, next time I'll make sure I get it right again.

Also added the Openbittorrent tracker, hope that works...
