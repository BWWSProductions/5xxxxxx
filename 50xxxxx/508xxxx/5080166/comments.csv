,fruitloopy,2009-09-06T12:41Z,"Seedbox is now working correctly.  Had to update the tracker, which was completely borked.

Seedbox is set to seed for the first 5000% @ a max speed of 10,000 KB per second, so folks should be good to go!

Enjoy and post any issues you have."
,fruitloopy,2009-09-09T19:26Z,"It wont let me edit the .torrent file here.  the reason why its not updating is due to TPB's trackers that constantly keep failing.  The seedbox is seeding this without issue, over 95 GB uploaded from it thus far."
