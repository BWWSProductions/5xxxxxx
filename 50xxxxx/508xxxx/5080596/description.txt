Little Star tells the tale of a British dad coming to terms with the realities of actually being a father. Simonâ€™s life is not where he though it would be, he barely sees his wife, he doesnâ€™t have a noteworthy career to speak of, and to top it all off, Simonâ€™s daughter seems to prefer her mummy despite the fact that Simon is indisputably her primary caregiver.
