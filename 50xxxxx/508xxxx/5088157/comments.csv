Some people say the smartest things, like: ""Hey, you forgot to include the keygen: the keygen folder is empty"", or ""Where is the install dir? I've been looking for it but there's no such folder named install dir"". Some times I wonder what they're gonna do with the program if they can't even read and understand included Readme.txt files.

,teckmo,2009-10-03T11:27Z,"I have the same problem after following the instructions.  I had a previous trial and cracked version installed before, maybe that has something to do with it?"
,Scorpio70,2009-10-09T14:54Z," Arrogance is cool, but it really does not help us at all. RH: I have been using TBP for quite a while and IÂ´m perfectly capable of following instructions. It just so happens that your instructions either a) donÂ´t work or b) are poorly written. So, instead of mocking us, climb down from your ivory tower and double-check this out.

 It really does say ""the purchase code was not found"". Upon installing with network disconnected it complains about not being able to connect the website and refuses to go further before plugging the cable back in. Then it happily accepts any given code and seems to be all right, but after looking up the magic 50 songs it insults with the above quote."
,LifetimeTorrenter,2010-03-23T03:50Z,It accepts the key for like 3 seconds and said wasnt found. then Crashess.
,GPS08,2010-06-26T07:56Z,"lol, sorry but couldnt get this to work...

Followed your instructions by word.

Disable internet - done
Copy cracked files to installed folder - done
Open FixTunes and select ""Enter purchase code"" - done
Enter a random set of numbers and click Next - done

After this all is well, it says the code was accepted blablabla and i click on the not looked up tab and wham! ""your 50 look ups are used up, please insert your purchase code"" and you redo the whole thing and end up doing nothing.

* Status torrent at sept, 13 2009 - 23.45 CET: clean, tested & working.	erm bullshit? you saw the pop up saying code accepted and you closed it thinking ""im leet, it works"". next time try actually testing your uploads before giving out crap. Where did u get the skull from anyway? remove it, you're a disgrace."
,RadGH,2010-07-26T02:07Z,"Crack does not work, followed directions exactly but in order for fixtunes to function it must connect to the internet to look up the songs. After all the cracks and entering a serial (which worked fine), I turned on my internet and it prompted the key is invalid AFTER it had already accepted it.

Needs an updated crack..."
