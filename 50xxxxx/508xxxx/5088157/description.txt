                    FixTunes v4.82 (Non-iTunes Version) + Crack



Organize and Fix Your Music:
*FixTunes is an easy and powerful program that will fix any missing or misspelled 
song details, add album artwork, remove duplicates songs and organize your music. 

*Smarter Than Other Programs
Works even if you have misspelled or missing song data (unlike iTunes and others).

*It's Automatic - Typing Not Necessary
Look up and fix all your songs with just a few clicks.

*Add Album Art to Songs
Enjoy music the way it was meant to be seen. A must have for iPods, iPhones, etc.

*Edit and Fix MP3 Tags and Names
Corrects and updates Artist, Album, Title, Track, Year and Genre tags.


Smarter Than Other Programs:
*iTunes and other programs rely on correct information in your songs to find 
album art. Not FixTunes. Even if your song names have misspellings or missing 
info, FixTune's intelligent database technology will find the matching artwork.

It's Automatic - Typing Not Necessary:
*Who has time drag and drop thousands of album pictures or to re-type hundreds 
of artist names? FixTunes is completely automated. It will automatically add 
album art to your songs and fix your music while you sleep or play outside.

Add Album Art to Songs:
*In addition to correcting all your song details, FixTunes will download the 
correct album artwork and add it to each song. Its a part of the automatic 
process and no extra work is needed from you. Enjoy your music collection 
that way it was meant to be seen.

Edit and Fix MP3 Tags and Names:
*FixTunes is a full-featured music-fixing package. It will add missing album art 
to all your songs, but it can also clean up all your missing and incorrect song 
information: artists, albums, titles, tracks, years, and genres. 
Isn't it annoying when you have 3 different spellings of the same artist? 
FixTunes will correct your music tags and names.



Some features of FixTunes:

â€“ Edit the song title, artist, album, track, year and genre tags of your music.
â€“ Fix songs automatically, without having to type all the information yourself.
â€“ Automatically download and add album cover art images to your music files.
â€“ Look up online information on your music like artist bios & reviews with 1 click.
â€“ Rename the music in your library into a standard format.
â€“ Organize your music into folders according to artist, album, year or genre.
â€“ Remove duplicate music files from your collection with ease, saving the best one.
â€“ Quickly search and edit only a portion of your music collection. 

Edit MP3 Song Tags
FixTunes makes editing songs tags incredibly easy. FixTunes will automatically 
download song information from an online database so you donâ€™t have to type 
anything. If you prefer the hands-on approach, FixTunes makes manually updating 
your songs easy as well. You can type in the information you want directly or you 
can search the music database from within the FixTunes program. Searching the 
database makes it easy to browse directly to the correct artist / album / song 
combination â€“ even if you arenâ€™t sure what they are supposed to be. FixTunes will 
read and save both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags to your MP3 song files â€“ including artist, 
album, title, track, year genre, comments and album cover art. 

Album Cover Art
FixTunes will automatically download the album cover art images for your songs 
from the Internet and add them to your files. Many music programs (including 
iTunes) will display the album cover art image of the currently playing song if 
the image has been saved inside the fileâ€™s ID3 tags. In addition to the traditional
â€œlistâ€ view of your music library, FixTunes allows you to browse your music by 
album cover. Album art is organized by Artist, Genre or Year allowing you to 
quickly scan your music collection. 

Rename and Organize Your Music Library
Using FixTunes, you can easily organize thousands of music files into folders on 
your hard drive. FixTunes will ask you how you want your files names (for example: 
â€œArtist Name â€“ Song Title (Track Number).mp3? and what type of folder structure 
you want to organize the files into (for example: â€œMusic Folder Artist Name Album 
fileâ€). All you have to do is answer a few questions and FixTunes takes care of 
the rest. FixTunes will also detect duplicate files and move the duplicate with 
the lower file size to a special duplicates directory that you can go through at 
your leisure. 

Automated Organization
How long would it take you to manually go through all of your music and type in 
the correct information? With FixTunes, your entire music collection can be fixed 
and organized with just a few clicks. Hereâ€™s how it works:
Step 1: FixTunes scans your computer / music folder(s) and finds your music files.
Step 2: With two clicks, you tell FixTunes to begin looking the correct info for 
        your music files from the online database.
Step 3: Once the correct information has been downloaded, you simply tell FixTunes 
        (with one click) to fix and organize your music files. The correct info is
        added, album art is downloaded, folders are created and organized, 
        duplicates are removed and files are rename â€“ all while you do something 
        else (like sleepâ€¦). 

Online Catalog Information
In addition to the correct tag data, FixTunes also downloads additional info about
your songs and albums. From within the program, you have one-click access to a 
variety of sources including Google searches, Amazon.com catalog information, 
artist biographical info from Wikipedia and Amazon.com similar albums lists.
FixTunes will also display details on the current album directly in the programs 
interface: Artist, label, year, genres and track listings (so you can easily see 
which tracks you have and which you donâ€™t). 

Search Your Music
FixTunes makes every part of the library editing experience easy. There is always 
a search field visible on the program that will display search results of your 
music files as you type. You can quickly find the songs you are looking for and 
edit their information, view catalog data or album art all within the same window.

Music Database
The power behind FixTunes is a huge music database with information on over 
4 million songs, albums and artists. FixTunes uses this database to look up 
the missing information in your songs (using the existing information) so you 
donâ€™t have to type it in. The database links to other music sources on the 
Internet, allowing FixTunes to download album art for your songs and give you 
one-click access to artist bios and additional catalog information. 

Easy to Use
FixTunes is easy to use. Most FixTunes users have multiple thousands of songs 
in their collections, and this program was built specifically for them. All 
actions, from browsing and searching for a specific song, to quickly editing 
details of multiple songs at a time is all performed in the main program â€“ 
no extra windows are opened. Menu items and buttons are clearly labeled and do 
what you would expect them to. You will think FixTunes was designed just for you.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of 
    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting 
    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz
    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!
  
08- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

10- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

To the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
