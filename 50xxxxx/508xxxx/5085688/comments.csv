NO SEEDS WTF??"
,john5246,2009-10-06T23:27Z,"Guys the next version of this game will be out by the time I'm able to download the whole thing. WTF? 

TURN UP YOUR UPLOAD SPEED A LITTLE AT LEAST AT OVERNIGHT."

Also it was a big turn off to see that you can use microsoft points to buy new cars even though you already bough the game WTF? "
