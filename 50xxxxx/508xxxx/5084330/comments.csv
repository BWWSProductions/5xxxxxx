,yayer,2010-07-05T10:53Z,"Thanks Markuf for the up!
Sorry to do this, but this is my first game DL, so is there any special instructions burning it? Do I just use a DVD burning program like Nero and select the folder I've saved everything in? Or do I only burn parts of it/do i add something else to it? Will it work on a stock standard wii? 
Thanks a heap in advance!"

You will not get this to play on a STOCK WII. 
You need to go down one of two roots:
1) buy a drive chip and disect your wii to install it (many different chip types and wii drive types, i poersonally wouldn't bother) 
2) Soft-mod your wii. This involves multiple procedures to install new IOS and cIOS files into your wii which allow the use of copy games which for the purpose of copyright law we will call ""backups"" of games you have ""apparently already purchased"" 

There are hundreds of soft-mod guides online, some easy to follow, some not, and you can soon do it in a few hours but READ UP first. Don't destroy your NAND (wii mem) by writing all sorts of files over the top if your guessing procedures. 
Once soft-modded you can pop in a DVD-R disc and play, or go one better and play games without any discs and run from a hardrive nformatted in the WBFS file system (again, have a good google-up on this)
I prefer running from HD as DVD-R cannot be read fast enough by the wii drives, and often some games glitch or have loading speed issues. USB drives eliminate this issue.

You can't just download a wii game image, burn and use on stock wii's. It will laugh back at you i'm afraid..."
