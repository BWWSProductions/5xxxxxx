,Stinkyfanooter,2010-12-25T13:47Z,"Okay so just wondering how am i supposed to register image doctor and xenofex? I didn't see a keygen or any form of serial in the folders for each and i don't believe any of the other ones apply to either of those...Thanks a lot for the help and the other ones (havent figured how to get to eye candy yet :S) work great i.e. blowup, snap art."
