Hear some of the most eloquent and best informed defenders of liberty. Hear Richard Hersh, head of The truth project, tell about the infiltration by military intelligence of the Quaker church, about what happened to him - his e-mails, his license plates, his phone calls etc. Hear noted constitutional scholar, Jonathan Turley, tell of the terrible threat to America. Hear noted author, James Bamford, give his stunning testimony about the NSA, that if the government ever became a tyranny, it would be a total tyranny, there would be no way of fighting back, because of the power of technology to find out virtually everything. Find out how the US government has been taken over by people with absolutely totalitarian mentality and what they have been doing behind the backs of Americans on the grounds of battling international terrorism. As you are about to see the plan for a police state has been long in preparation and with every step millions of Americans are pushed into the hands of people who set themselves above every law. 2h long.
