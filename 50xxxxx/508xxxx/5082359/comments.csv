,calrin88,2010-01-19T15:38Z,it works perfectly fine on vista 64bit
,Scuura,2010-02-16T12:05Z,"I can't seem to get it to work. I get to the autorun when I mount it into daemon tools, but when i hit install game, recovery commander comes up, but when it's done, the installation setup doesn't appear. Or, if it does, then it stays for a minute before exiting out by itself. I'm using vista by the way."
,AgnostikRU,2010-02-18T12:56Z,"Sorry, can't help you there, never even touched Vista. :("
