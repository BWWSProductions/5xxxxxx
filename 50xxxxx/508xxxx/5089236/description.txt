Are We Alone?

ARE WE ALONE? ventures to Earth's strangest, most extreme regions to uncover clues to the universe's evolution. From Death Valley, California, to the glaciers of Chile; from the harsh desert climates of Africa to the lush seascapes of the Caribbean, the world's top astrobiologists and astrophysicists examine the geological record and the biological influence of life forms that created and continue to sustain life on Earth. Could this answer the profound question of whether life is possible in our own universe or beyond?

ARE WE ALONE? examines the vast scientific knowledge of the environmental conditions of several planets in our solar system gathered by numerous NASA space missions to find a surprisingly high number of planets where alien life might already exist or be possible, including Mars and several moons of Saturn, Neptune and Jupiter.

Geologically and biologically, Earth serves as a virtual science lab, providing many intriguing parallels to the development of life forms elsewhere, while answering many complex questions about how life adapts to and evolves in extremely harsh environments. The challenging conditions for the existence of life on our planet allows experts to posit theories of how alien life could exist or develop on other planets.
