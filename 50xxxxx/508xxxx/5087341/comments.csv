,yuppefish,2009-10-05T01:35Z,"80z! I love you, you rock so hard. Thanks so much for all of this... I hope I can make a request... do you have any honeychurch? one of their songs is on volume 12 (?) of the new wave compilations... and I REALLY like it... so if you have more I would be totally into it. 

Same with the Droids - they were on the French New wave compilation - and I totally love that song as well so if you have any more I would be SO GRATEFUL. 

either way, thanks so much."
