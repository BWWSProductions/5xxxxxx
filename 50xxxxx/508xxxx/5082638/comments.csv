Sorry, I am putting a limit on the upload speed: 3000 KBytes/s. My seedbox needs bandwidth for other chores."
,Azaluum,2009-12-13T09:41Z,"Thanks for a good torrent! I just downloaded it, looks good. Could I get a confirmation, for cataloging purposes mostly, is this from a Blu-Ray source? (vs. HDTV or upsample - of which latter I doubt)

I can see you have a BD cover, but it isn't actually mentioned at all in the tittle nor in the description."
,ebolasm,2010-01-15T04:10Z,"thanx for the upload, best movie ever"
,Ulexi,2011-02-04T17:16Z,"anybody else experiencing this problems or is it just Ubuntu causing the problems?

I can't select wich audio track to play, most media player's I tried it's in italian and the one where it's not the audio and video are not the same "
