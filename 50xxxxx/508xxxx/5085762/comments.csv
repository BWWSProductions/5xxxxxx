,Henkzki,2009-09-23T11:22Z,"This game is not region free, just a waste of Double layer CD......"
[T],spotswood,2009-09-25T04:42Z,"@ Henkzki:

only a moron doesn't notice the ntsc label on this game and yet, still, comes on here complaining about it not being region free. "
,RastaNinja,2009-10-03T03:47Z,lol just use abgx360 and make it region free LOL!
,lamboleap760,2009-10-08T19:18Z,Your P.C Should always be Seeding Something. There's No Excuse. 
,samljer,2009-11-09T07:35Z,"@ Henkzki:

Not only are you an idiot for complaining about it being NTSC when it says its ""NTSC""

But if you properly use programs like ABGX etc it will also tell you ""its ntsc""  by region code"
,YoungCrimson7,2009-11-16T04:33Z,How Do i burn this after i put it through winrar and make it into a dvd file and iso file i burn it with imgburn and set the layer break to 1913760 i've wasted three dvds with it trying different things 
,stommy989,2009-11-30T05:40Z,"I can't get this to work either...I made the .DVD file in Notepad with the layer break set to 1913760, burned it twice with Verbatim DL's through IMGBurn, verified the file is OK with ABGX360 and it still didn't work. Actually, it works upto the EA Sports logo and then it freezes the entire 360 with a white screen. I'm using an NTSC/U 360 w/ iXtreme 1.5 w/the Benq drive. Maybe I should upgrade it to iXtreme 1.6??"
