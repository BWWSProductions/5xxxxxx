,gtsome,2010-05-23T22:22Z,"I cant get any subs on this.
I have tried VLC that i use to watch movies, but I also downloaded Divx player as instructed in the movie information. Please advice?"
,woodrowwilsonsmith,2010-05-25T11:38Z,"Sadly, the subtitles don't work on a Mac, even a new one with VLC. Does anyone know a Mac version of the required software?"
,gtsome,2010-05-29T00:57Z,Anyone knows where I can get a sub for this one?
,gtsome,2010-05-29T01:58Z,"Tried DivX player again, and now it worked. There I could change between English and Greek. In VLC I get some kind of error message. Anyway, looks like the DivX player is the thing for this movie. Thx for the up."
,dearghoul,2010-06-06T02:17Z,"Works with divx player, just turn sub track on, but there is nasty static throughout. Can't get rid of it. What a fucking drag. Can't someone do something right with this fucking film?"
,dearghoul,2010-06-06T02:35Z,"OK, here is dearghoul to make things right.
Download these subs, and use vlc to play them. Open vlc, choose advanced open in the media tab and point to the movie file and sub file, dunno if you can make it play both pieces in a row, probably, I didn't try. It works, these subs sync perfectly with this copy, and there be no static. Yay!
Thanks for getting us most of the way, uploader fellow."

Oops, here be the subs!"
,dearghoul,2010-06-06T02:42Z,"PS, make sure ye have a fat codec pack like k-lite installed, and grab the divx codec pack while you're at it. Dunno which is needed, but I have all these and something worked for me with vlc. "
