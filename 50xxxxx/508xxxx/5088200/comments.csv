,darnell101,2009-12-01T08:15Z,What's the difference between this and the original Full Metal Alchemist??
,Kypster,2009-12-04T06:42Z,"The storyline in the beginning is fairly similar, but abbreviated. After a certain point however (around episode 12-13) it becomes a whole new story line. Only thing thats the same is their looking to restore their bodies using the philosophers stone. Aside from that? Don't expect anything to be the same =D"

It's not really a ""whole new story line"".

Season 1 of Full Metal Alchemist came out before the Manga was finished. They didn't know where to go and made up a lot that had to do with the story.

Season 2 (Brotherhood) is following the Manga storyline, as the Manga is closing in on it's end.

Thanks for the episodes!"
