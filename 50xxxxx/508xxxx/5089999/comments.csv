,troy1969,2009-09-18T02:34Z,"Stop the bitchin' ppl. Just take the time to look at the file name and you'll see what it is.

Fuck I'm getting tired of all you nagging little boys and girls ""there's no nfo so it must be shit"" 

Just take a look at the file and you'll see it's iHack OSX install DVD.iso.

Took me 3-4 secs to find out

I don't need it, but thanks for the effort unixer.

Always appreciated when someone is sharing!!"
,unixer,2009-09-18T09:23Z,"Sorry about that.
I (and some friends) have a lot of problems with this torrent.
Cause this I stop the seed.
This was a Mac OS X Snow Leopard Release DVD, for Mac OS X Conventional PCs installation.
Cause this I have corrupted the description.
But, if you dont like, fuckyou!
XD"
,ras_yo,2009-09-18T13:40Z,"@ unixer:
Dont care about the newbies. Intelligence is not spread to all People. Sad you are stopping seeding this. I would like to test it.
thanks anyway
"
,unixer,2009-09-21T08:46Z,"Sorry, I can`t seed this.
I put some links, to some people inside the iso.
And this is problem, with justice and with police.
Cause this I stop the seeding.
But, don`t worry, in some days (2/3 weeks) iHack OS X will be released to 2.0. And without ""dangerous"" links for the developer (me) and Idealizator.
iHack is not dead! It Still Alive!"
