,lailabagge,2009-09-14T09:32Z,"I truly wish I was a little girl again, perhaps then I could appreciate this show."
,barda24,2009-09-17T14:58Z,"The plot sounds a little like the Twilight Saga, two supernatural creatures competing for the affection of a 17 year old girl. And yes I know that The Vampire Diaries were written before Twilight, now I'll just have to see if this is as good."
,Exodus666,2009-09-18T16:30Z,"Its not. They even made the actors look like the actors in Twilight. I dont care what was written first, this is an obivous ripoff of Twilight, unfortunately that is all it is. There is not one original idea in this entire show, this Vampire cliche fest will not last one season. MUCH better Vampire shows then this have been canceled, Blade the series for one."
