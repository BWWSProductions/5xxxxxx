,johnniebrasco,2009-09-16T19:46Z,great game except for the controls. Makes it unplayable. you cant shoot while moving. And that would be an advantage with hundred zombies all around you.

,reeves2k2,2009-10-05T15:33Z,"i have a problem,

the game installed and played fine the first time i played it

i had to do a system restore on my system and when i re-installed this game when i open launcher and click the dx9 the game screen opens and my system locks up and i have to do a hard reset 

any help please guys 

ive tried the compatability settings and running as admin etc but nothing seems to work 

i know the torrent and game itself are good because when i first installed it before i did a system restore everything was fine"
,tonisimic,2009-10-11T11:21Z,why is the setup language some unknown words and is it the same thing in the game please answer me PPPPPPLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEAAAAAAASSSSSSSEEEEEE
,apparentsymmetry,2009-10-13T01:17Z,"graphics were pretty damn good... 


probably the only good thing about this game is the graphics though... 


looks like it's back to playing FEAR 2 and Dead Space over and over and over and over and over and over again..."
,Thorcsf,2009-11-02T07:09Z,"I'm having a problem to run the game. I think it's something to do with the ""RE5DX9.exe"" file.
First of all, when I enter the game and start a new game, the initial movies are not shown; I just hear the sound and see the subtitles, but the screen stays black all the time. And after that, when the game will start, an error window appears with the title ""RESIDENT EVIL 5: RE5DX9.exe - Quit because of an error on the application"", and in the window appears ""D3DERR_DRIVERINTERNALERROR : present_result"". When I click ""OK"", the game is closed. :(

I already updated the DirectX and my graphics card driver, but the problem persists.

Does someone knows how to resolve that?

Thanks!"

There should be a language menu in the upper left corner, all you have to do is to choose english (or any other crap you speak in) in that menu.
