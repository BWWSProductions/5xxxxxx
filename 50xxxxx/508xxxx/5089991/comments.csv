,PsychoMY,2009-09-24T03:55Z,Anyone know how to tell the difference between basic and pro with this version? I have several things that don't work the way they should and I'm wondering if the crack is fully functional. Stuff like video chat don't work.

,aoxo,2009-10-17T17:13Z,"Scanned with AVG, Kapersky, and Adaware...no virus detected as of now.  Seems to work well.  The Pro Feature Icons are now gone and it says it's registered.  I disabled all update notices so I don't accidentally update.  I assume future versions will break the crack but I could be wrong.

I wouldn't have bothered with a crack except Cerulean Studios thought it would be cool to offer lots of neat skins only for pro users.  They claim you can find more skins on the website, yet don't have any Astra skins available.  The only reason I switched to Astra was because they said it was better optimized and used less system resources, unfortunately I would have had to give up my previous black skin for an ugly powder blue one.

Cerulean Studios has threads on their forums warning of a crack that contains a trojan that includes remote access, keylogger, rootkit, etc.  It seems that this is in reference to a beta release anyway though I'm sure they don't care to be too specific about which cracks are safe.  The fact that suburban_user's link is now dead and he has no other uploads, I suspect his loader was of the infected sort.  Do be cautious!"
