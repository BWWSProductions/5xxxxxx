that he has to breakup with three women at the same time during a conference call in front of his next prey. His brother Paul 
(Breckin Meyer) is about to get married, and Connor thinks he is making a terrible mistake. As an incorrigible bachelor, Connor 
loves his freedom more than ever settling down and loving only one woman. Connor tries to talk Paul out of getting married, 
and it looks like Connor is about to succeed. Then the night before the wedding, Connor is visited by three ghosts, who take 
him back to his past, present, and his lonely future. They try to discovery the point in time where Connors became this womanizing
