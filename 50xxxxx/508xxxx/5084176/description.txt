One solution for everything:
====================
While most competitors offer different packages for remote support, remote administration, training and sales (and also charge for them...) TeamViewer is the one-stop solution for everything you need: TeamViewer includes all modules in one simple and very affordable package.
	
Remote administration of unattended servers:
==================================
TeamViewer can also be used to control unattended computers and servers. Installation as a system service even allows remote reboot and reconnect.
	
File transfer:
==========
TeamViewer comes with integrated file transfer that allows you to copy files and folders from and to a remote partner - which also works behind firewalls
	
Highest security standard:
====================
TeamViewer is a very secure solution. All versions feature completely secure data channels with key exchange and AES (256 Bit) session encoding, the same security standard used by https/SSL.

Online status display:
=================
Are you working in a team with members in many different locations? Would you like to present your desktop or collaborate in a document? In the TeamViewer partner list you see at any time who of your partners is available - it just takes one mouse and you are connected.
	
Remote support without installation:
===========================
With TeamViewer you can remotely control any PC anywhere on the Internet. No installation is required, just run the application on both sides and connect - even through tight firewalls.
	
Remote presentation of products, solutions and services:
==========================================
The second TeamViewer mode allows you to present your desktop to a partner. Show your demos, products and presentations over the Internet within seconds - live from your screen.
	
Works behind firewalls:
==================
The major difficulties in using remote control software are firewalls and blocked ports, as well as NAT routing for local IP addresses.
If you use TeamViewer you don't have to worry about firewalls: TeamViewer will find a route to your partner.
	
Browser based access:
==================
Are you on the road and would you like to control a remote computer? Why don't you use TeamViewer Web Connector? The purely html and flash based solution can be used from nearly any browser and operating system.
	
Very competitively priced, free versions available:
====================================
TeamViewer offers a lot of value for low prices, there even is a free version for non-commercial use available.
	
Optimized Performance:
==================
TeamViewer optimizes the display quality and speed depending on the network connection. This leads to optimal performance starting from LAN down to dial-up connections.
