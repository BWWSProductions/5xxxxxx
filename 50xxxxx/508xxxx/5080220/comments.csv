,SirSaWa,2009-11-26T13:47Z,"I have problem.
I installed this programme. When it installed, my computer fucked up.
I restarted my computer. When I try to install it again, it says: ""Are you sure you want to completely remove Corel Digital Studio 2010 and all of its features?""
I push the remove-button. When it tries to remove, it goes a little while. And then the programme says: ""Installation Wizard not completed. Your system has not been modified. To complete installation at another time, please run setup again. Click Finish to exit the wizard.""

What should I do?
I try to install it again, but the sam message come up everytime.
I even removed it from the computer and downloaded it again. But the same message comes up again.
Could anyone help me, please?!"
