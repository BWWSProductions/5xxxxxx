With a chilling crime at the center of its spellbinding story, Vampire Saga is not intended for 

the faint of heart. Join Matthew Ward as he steals aboard a cargo ship to escape the violence of 

the Spanish-American War, passes out and then wakes up to find himself alone with several 

sinister-looking coffins. Where did the crew go? Why is Matthew having strange visions? And why 

does he feel like he's being watched?
