,MaxCrisis,2009-09-14T21:26Z,"Erm...problem...how do I enable PhysX?
Becouse there's no option for it on the ""Launcher"" where you set all the other graphical options"
[T],Knaster,2009-09-14T21:44Z,OH thx ESPACONSOLAS i could kiss your spanish ass.......hope its not too hairy......hope its an female ass too lol
,archang3l,2009-09-14T22:41Z,Yeah same thing here... I have PhysX installed and I have a PhysX capable video card (nVidia 8800GT) yet there's no option in the launcher... I can't test if it has any issues that were present in the leaked version because I don't know if it works with the old saves? Anyone have any ideas?
,archang3l,2009-09-14T23:00Z,"Ok, I have witnessed pure awesomeness in the making. It appears PhysX can be enabled via config editing. You just need to go to RootFolder:\Users\[UserName]\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config (for Vista at least) and edit BmEngine.ini at the line PhysXLevel... only problem is... in my case it just crashed at the first fist I threw that made papers fly around. I have no idea why so use with caution. "
,Dumbbanus,2009-09-14T23:26Z,"yeah ESPACONSOLAS tell us how to enable Physx...changing the value in the config file only works if you change the file to ""read only"", so it doest default back, and even then the game crashes right after the intro... I want PHYSX!!!"

,spigadoro,2009-09-15T08:03Z,this version does not have physx there will most likely to be a patch that comes out in a few days that enables it so if you have the p2p version just get the new crack 
,vikingBaLLe,2009-09-15T15:43Z,"when i try to launch it,it says: SecuLauncher: failed to start application. 9000 , whats wrong?"
