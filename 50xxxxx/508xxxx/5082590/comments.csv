,madcan34,2009-09-09T22:51Z,why are there no seeders or leechers on anything that's been posted for the last few weeks?  Am I missing something?
,bugmeless,2009-09-12T15:19Z,"I'm with zhelkus on this on (or are they with me?  I asked last week too).  For what it's worth, espurious is using 256kB pieces on his torrents, which I regularly use to part-seed yours.  It's annoying having a file complete, yet I've got almost 7MB of a file that I can't seed because of the end pieces which I have to download again, even though I've already got most of them."
,roguejumpr,2009-09-16T04:12Z,Anyone else having problems getting torrents from this site to work the last few weeks? The site says there are a lot of seeders and leechers but I'm not getting anything to show up.
