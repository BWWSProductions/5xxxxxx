,Bodh1,2010-03-21T20:49Z,Where's the english subtitle for this?
,clevertroglodyte,2010-06-09T03:15Z,"Thanks for the upload!! Great quality, and well-done English subs.

I couldn't get English subs to play on anything except my DivX player... but for anyone else having trouble, the DivX player is a free download."
