Into The Light - Gloria Estefan [1991]
	

Into the Light is the follow up album to Cuts Both Ways. The theme of the album is bouncing back from the darkness of tragedy, hence the album's title. The album received a favourable welcoming not only from commercial success, but in the charts and the professional reviews. The album has sold 3.8 million copies to date. The album was slightly different than her previous ones in that the songs on the album were more in a soft-rock/lite style than her previous well-known Latin ones.
