 From back cover:
Legendary CIA man John Wells is glad to be back in the U.S. after years working deep undercover in Afghanistan and Pakistan-time spent saving the world-yet in his sleep is plagued by nightmares of extreme violence.  He knows better than anyone that unseen threats are lurking.  One morning while driving to work with his fiancee Jennifer, traffic into D.C. abruptly grinds to a halt.  Wellâ€™s instincts are aroused just before a shocking terror attack is unleashed.  In the wake of the carnage, Jennifer is among the casualties.  Like a man possessed, Wells swings into action-with Russia squarely in his sights.


  From RecordedBooks.com:
New York Times best-selling author of The Ghost War, Alex Berenson delivers potent doses of adrenaline-laced 21st-century espionage. The Silent Man confronts a frightening near-future scenario--ominous and undeniably real. Today, procuring a nuclear warhead is only a matter of money and access to Russia. But this round is personal for CIA man John Wells after a shocking terrorist attack hits heartbreakingly close to home.

  
  From Publishers Weekly
Bestseller Berenson's well-plotted and thoughtful third thriller to feature CIA agent John Wells (after The Ghost War) finds Wells and his fellow CIA agent and fiancÃ©e, Jenny Exley, living happily together in Washington, D.C., content to devote themselves to fighting the forces of evil. One morning, while stuck in traffic on their way to CIA headquarters, men on motorcycles attack them in their minivan. Exley suffers a serious gunshot injury in an act of revenge by minions of Pierre Kowalski, an enemy from an earlier book. Meanwhile, jihadists bent on destroying America steal two small atomic bombs. These extremely clever villains, per Berenson's style, aren't mad dog idiots but credible characters with reasons, at least from their own perspective, to be doing the great evil they're planning. Fast and furious when it needs to be, this is a welcome addition to an excellent series. Berenson won an Edgar for his first novel, The Faithful Spy [The Faithful Spy rose to #1 on the New York Times paperback bestseller list.]
