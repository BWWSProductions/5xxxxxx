Description: only a few of the song lyrics are here, it's not that kind of remix.  But it is a nice remix reworking of the tune, something to have.

One thing Michael did best was have solid bass lines, unlike his sister. I had to dial down my subwoofer, so I'd say we've got bass oh yeah.

Thanks."
