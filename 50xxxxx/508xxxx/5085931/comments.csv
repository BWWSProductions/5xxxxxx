,burningrabbit,2009-09-16T16:33Z,"You mean free PJ is the shit. Just admit it. Yes, I buy music. But most albums are not worth the money. TPB gives me the opportunity of listening first before buying. I'm not going to make anyone rich by buying their music. Posterity will be an artist's true reward."
,Otaku1,2009-09-17T08:08Z,Thank you. Quality +1. 
,Derrick4Real,2009-09-17T13:37Z,"thanks...im going to try this one out. not a big fan of the new sound...backspacer didnt do much for me. i have been a huge pj fan since 92 so i still ove them.

i just never thought i would like the new alice in chains song more than i like the new pj song...considering the circumstances.

thanks for the upload my friend"

,GeezusWasHere,2009-09-26T19:47Z,"@ 1JEM1 ... you aware that for a PJ fan you listed only the most commercials, not really well researched songs of PJ ... Haven't heard Backspacer yet but I would never say "" I miss songs like daughter, Jeremy and Evenflow .."" Pretty good songs that I loved ... but PJ grew older since then and are imo way better"
,neoslink1,2009-09-30T23:39Z,gonna listen to this till i have time to rip my copy off the cd. great upload =]
