Also for Vista run the game as admin to help in starting the game.

but for me after doing all that the game starts with the starting movie and games for window so all is well for about a second or two then again it crashes due to a problem in SkiDROW ""S8Game-F"" file,  and if I restarted the game again all will by ine till the start menu with the ?PREES ANY KEY TO START? and  then sadly I get the message games for window fail to start  and again I?m back at the desktop

,RobLovesHotMoms,2009-09-24T06:00Z,"Okay, for Vista 32-Bit users.

1) Uninstall Games for Windows
2) Go to http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-Games-For-Windows-LIVE_program_35222.html
3) Go to nVidia and download the latest PhysX
4) Run as Adminstrator
5) Play game

Enjoy!

,mashnovska,2009-09-24T07:23Z,Has securom been removed from this torrent?
,krisha,2009-09-24T21:54Z,siemper - i get the same - i have win 7 - haven't figured it out yet though.
,Shadowbade,2009-09-28T07:08Z,"Ok here's the deal for all of you who are having Games for Windows LIVE problems.

Microsoft released an update for it that performs 2-3 tests to root out pirated games.

Basically, the only way you're not gonna have this prob is to get the old Games for Windows LIVE (which will probably auto update as soon as you start it up anyway) or wait till someone with hacking skills makes it to where you don't need Games for Windows Live."
,ThePriestman,2009-09-29T17:54Z,"Mine isn't having a problem initializing. It just says 'Please use Games for Windows LIVE launcher' I've looked throughout the directory and didn't find a different launcher. Also checked to see if I could launch it from the Windows LIVE client, couldn't do that either."
,ThePriestman,2009-09-30T23:30Z,"Fixed my problem for awhile. Then it did the ""Initializing"" error, so I deleted Xlive and reinstalled GfWL. No it's back to my original problem

Vista 64bit btw"
,ThePriestman,2009-10-01T00:35Z,Finally got it to work. It's an intense game. Not all that difficult on Medium. It's like if you mixed Unreal Tournament with the game Tribes

,Ovais221,2009-10-20T13:50Z,Guys wats the CD key for this game?
,Ovais221,2009-10-22T15:15Z,Seriously can someone give me the key for this game coz i am unable to save my campaign without it! pls tell me the key
,trial2err,2009-11-13T21:43Z,"OKAY- The .exeyou need to click is:

Go to your install directory- Inside the Section 8 Folder..

Section 8> Binaries> S8Game F-prot.exe

Worked for me when nothing else would, and after I used that one, the rest work now- like a kick start, but sadly GFWL still sucks and needs a CD-Key..."
,garyb916,2009-11-15T02:02Z,"^^ That doesn't work, it just says to use the s8.exe file to open it.

Opening with the other .exe in that folder tells you to use the Windows Live launcher, but how the hell do you do that? Games for windows live only has the demos on there.

I'm running win 7 and am getting an error opening the game too. "
,skullboy88,2010-01-04T19:55Z,Fucking trojan horse when you extract files. Bullshit.
,skullboy88,2010-01-05T17:24Z,"I dont know why so many people are having problems? Creat a folder.right click an  extract files to the folder. f-prot is a trojan. I deleted it. install game from setup app. Do not install WIN LIVE! you can cancle the install it gives u the option. Replace the section 8 exe with the one provided. click on it. black box, then the game starts. Stop being noobs! OPEN YOUR MIND! OPEN YOUR MIND!"
,venom1200,2010-01-15T10:43Z,"@skullboy88

i actually tried that a while back and i didn't get any game starting. in fact, i've tried every suggested method here and still no game.

if anyone knows how to get this game to work 100% then let us know!

ps. i'm running it on windows 7. is this a problem?"
,skullboy88,2010-01-28T07:46Z,"Venom 1200

I have windows 7 ultimate. I swear I did what I posted and the game works fine. ??? It has a unreal 3 feel to it big time. kind of boring after a bit. The steps i did worked for me. ???"
,vasisfury,2010-05-12T18:16Z,"Game works perfectly fine, just it has no sound. Anyone know a way to fix it? Would be muchly appreciated."
