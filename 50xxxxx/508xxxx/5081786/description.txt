Keith Jarrett is one of the few jazz superstars, whose concerts sell out almost immediately, wherever he plays. But Keith is much more than just a jazz musician. Through an exploration of his life and work, and close encounters with the man himself, this documentary offers an exceptional opportunity to examine the contrasting worlds of jazz and classical music. At the same time it will present a fascinating and analytical portrait of a complex but remarkable musician whose interests and influences range from jazz, ethnic and folk music, to Bach, Mozart, Stravinsky and Samuel Barber. 

The film explores, through a collage of interviews and performance, the complete range of Keith Jarrett's life and work. Great archive material is interweaved with original and richly detailed filmed interviews, not only with Keith himself, but with all the musicians he has played with over the years, as well as with members of his family, tour managers and other close musical and recording associates. "Keith Jarrett - The Art of Improvisation" - produced and directed by Mike Dibb, in collaboration with Jarrett's biographer Ian Carr - is the first ever major documentary about Keith Jarrett to be made with the full co-operation of Jarrett himself.
