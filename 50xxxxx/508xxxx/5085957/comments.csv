,cylanoid,2010-03-09T02:05Z,"after installation it told me the correct direct x did not install, i have installed many new games, i'm sure i have the most updated directx, i stated the game and it told me to insert cd rom, image is mounted, daemon tools"
,cylanoid,2010-03-12T23:21Z,Seriously?  Only 4 comments and my problem didn't get answered.  Where is the crack for this?  it asks for the CD even after i mount the image.  Re installed fine.

,CocaColaberoende,2011-04-18T18:20Z,"I hate ppl who says the game ""works"" and dont explain how they got it to work! Ppl are retards."
,lollydoddle,2011-05-31T22:24Z,"@CocaColaberoende - I hate when people think that typing like a 12 year old is a form of civil communication. 

People who are able to make the game work know something you don't. Like how to spell."
,sahu12,2011-06-02T15:43Z,After installing when I open the game it says insert the correct cd/dvd rom. What to do???
,markofkv,2011-07-11T23:33Z,"i dont know what are you people talking about, but this game works perfectly. there is no save problem."
,halfchalupa,2011-07-13T20:41Z,hmm 0 out of 0 seeders connected...maybe the trackers are messed up
,blemin,2011-08-12T21:17Z,"I know that it's definitely possible for this to work, but it's stupidly difficult to do it properly. Could someone post a step-by-step tutorial on how to work this succesfully?"
,Dragice,2011-08-15T14:43Z,"Steb by step guide, for those asking:
1. Download torrent (duh)
2. Using winrar, extract the .iso file (it'll auto link em if you got em all)
3. Mount/burn image to disk.
4. Install game via disk.
5. Most important step: Go to your DVD drive and right click the disk. Click ""Open"" or equivalent. Now, open the folder named ""Crack"". Copy the file there to your installation folder. Overwrite.
6. Enjoy the game. As a safety, keep the disk in/mounted."
