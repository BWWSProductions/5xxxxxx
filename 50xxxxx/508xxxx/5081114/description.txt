4.  get daemon tools onto your computer
5.  take dev-pk1.cue and mount it on daemon tools
6.  it should start an instalation
7.  follow the steps to the installation

9.  then when it asks for the next cd you mount dev-pk2.cue on deamon tools and click ok on installation

10.  when it asks for the final disk then you mount the last .cue file-dev-pk3.cue
