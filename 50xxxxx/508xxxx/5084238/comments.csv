,degtop,2009-09-13T06:12Z,"dammit i found out why there are no comments and i downloaded avg cause i was skeptical :( The 100% seeder logged off so we had to mooch off of each other, and about an hour ago or so he logged back on and we all just got to 100. There will be comments soon. That's why there are so many leechers and not seeders. Just saying to clarify THERE ARE NOOOOOOOOOOOOO VIRUSES!!!! THIS IS THE FULL GAME!!"

,xiIix,2009-09-23T06:37Z,"Well then, move out of your bullshit country. Move to Sweden, or Japan or America. We have tons of fuckin' bandwidth. I'm downloading shit at 900-1500kB/s at almost a constant basis. The worst you'll see is maybe an ISP that throttles users, but that's what encryption is for. There is nothing worse than censorship and lack of freedom. Get the hell out of there."

,utdarkviper,2009-10-03T05:32Z,"Well I fixed it, but I didn't really have to do much. I exited the game, re-ran the mounted disk, reset settings to default. I went back into the game, set all my settings back at max and loaded my save file and all was good. Weird."

,kungjoel,2010-01-30T16:07Z,"Got a transparent ""box"" at my left side of the screen when i play the game, hiding every NPC that moves under it, aswell as the trees, making it look like the apples in them are just floating in thin air.
Aswell as the game randomly crashes.

Got the latest drivers, and PhysX installed, if that should be of any difference? Tried all kinds off different video settings to get rid of the magic box, aswell as reinstalling the game and still no luck.

Any suggestion to what may cause this? Especially the crashes.
Cheers
