[V],only1joe,2009-09-19T10:27Z,"yohohoandaBottleofRUM - well done you found and your prize is ..... ermmm.....well.....i not that generous.....but i have upload another music torrent, the best of Rick Sprinfield if your interested.

Looks like i will only be doing Weekend Uploads for the near future as i am working away from home.
But i have been taking the laptop with me and i have started ripping some music DVDs, so you can expect some music videos soon. I have still over 250 CD Albums to rip and scan. So lots of uploads in the pipeline.
My main upload site now is h.33.t (looks like demon oid is down for a while)
