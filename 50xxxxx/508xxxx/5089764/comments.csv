,jadotben,2009-09-16T05:14Z,"Info:
No Sli ?
With 3-way Sli I had to go to Nvidia control panel ->manage 3d settings->add Shift.exe in the list->Sli performance mode-> select 3-GPU alternate frame rendering 2.
And after that fps increased a lot with everything on max.
I guess this works also with Sli."

,xiIix,2010-10-21T04:23Z,"Can someone release the ferarri DLC for xbox360 converted to the PC version? People are converting it over with instructions on how to do it manually, but it's tedious shit. I've been a modder for over 10 years, but I'm getting old and I don't have time for this shit anymore, so if anyone could take and package their ferarri conversion and post it here as a drag and drop for the ""Loose"" file setup, that'd be awesome."
