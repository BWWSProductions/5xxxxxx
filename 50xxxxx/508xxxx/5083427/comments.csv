,Lustr,2011-08-27T07:10Z,"thanks .. love this .. remember it from being a little kid.

This series inspired Chris Carter to do Xfiles ... infact, Darren McGavin appeared in Xfiles.

Also ... references to the Darren McGavin character - Kolchak appear in many shows about the mysterious, magical and spirit world including the TV series ""Supernatural""

thanks so much 

Love this series .. and the inspiration it Delivered."
