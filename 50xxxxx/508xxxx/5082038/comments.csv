,dertdamb,2009-10-08T21:51Z,does not work with vista
,JKupper,2009-10-14T02:05Z,Could not get this to run on Win 7.
,cyberkeeper1,2009-12-09T12:06Z,"well now.. i got mine to run just fine in windows 7. you need to have some knowledge of the compatibility layer built-in to windows 7. if a program will not run due to ""OS not supported"" or some crap like that, or it just wont install, then please right click the installer, click on ""troubleshoot compatiblity"" and then it SHOULD work. i do not guarantee 100% that it will work, but any who have problems need to try that method. "
,iknowwho,2009-12-09T17:31Z,"Sweet!!! Works well on win 7, vista and xp.  Just got to use your admin com promt in 7 and vista to install the crack."
,cyberkeeper1,2009-12-24T11:54Z,"thank you iknowwho. that is right. please, when installing into any OS other than windows XP, please allow the programs and / or cracks to run with Administrator privileges. Right-Click, and click ""Run as Adminstrator"". Vista or Win 7. same concept."
,r46u,2010-02-06T12:18Z,"Does not work with vista 64. Installer runs into a problem at the very end, tried setting compatibility mode to XP SP2, ran it as administrator (and both at the same time of course), even tried to kill the process before it had a chance to roll back the install and delete everything. It simply doesn't work.
cyberkeeper1 and iknowwho, what exactly did you do to get it to work? Specifics please, what exact type of OS and detailed step by step of install please."
,cebzki,2010-03-12T10:30Z,"it worked well in my XP OS...i installed the program and then copied the patch into its program files folder and pasted it there...i replaced the same program installed in the folder with a patched one...and doubled clicked it there...

So far its working perfectly fine...thanks for sharing minitab! i badly needed the program...i hope it won't expire...."
,nwagzy,2011-04-09T19:37Z,Won't work on my Windows 7 computer. Tried both compatibility AND run as admin ideas. It says there is a problem with my installer package? Help?
