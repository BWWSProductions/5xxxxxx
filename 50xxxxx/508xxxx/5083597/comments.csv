,rpgman1,2009-09-12T21:53Z,No hacks yet. We need to wait for GEN to release CFW 6.00 to get this game working. DAX decided not to update M33 as 6.00 had no major updates.
,unfairy,2009-10-01T23:39Z,The why upload the game?
,rotcore,2011-02-12T02:04Z,I have CFW for 6.35 and will comment when dowload is finished
,jacob5jac,2011-04-05T19:33Z,i own this game and i just want to say this game is fucking great. i only played about 3 or 4 hours of it and i already love it. i'm downloading this for my computer emulator. i started downloading this about 4:30 ago and its already a about 3.5% os the download speed is great (it is going up .2 per sec). i hope this works and thanks for the download
,joseph1up,2011-07-06T03:16Z,"yeah i just downloaded it, and i was playing it and it worked alright, but when i put my psp on sleep mode, (like i just flick the power up once) and when i resume my psp had reset to factory default. everything had changed, it was all in japanese. im running on cfw 6.39 ME. might be a bad game"
,blakfayt,2011-11-25T04:12Z,"Actually the factory default thing happens even with the actual UMD. If you sleep mode during the before clearing the first chapter (which is basically a tutorial) or during a cut scene it will restore to factory default. I thought it was an issue with the add on content, but eventually discovered it wasn't. Bad programming is all."
,sunken_rock,2011-11-25T11:37Z,"so blakfayt
after finishing chapter 1, will the PSP restore to factory default if put it to sleep?

and the cut scenes,
does any cut-scene(from chapter 1 onwards) i put to sleep mode, the same factory default thing will happen?"
,sunken_rock,2011-11-25T11:39Z,"and btw Disgaea rocks!
WOOT!"
,blakfayt,2012-06-11T18:05Z,"After chapter 1 it should only go to factory default if you save DURING a cutscene, any other time and it ought to be good., there also seems to be a connection between the cutscene freezes and DLC content. When I had the game and no DLC it only fucked up during the tutorial parts of chapter 1 (so pretty much all of it) and I had sleep moded it multiple times during scenes. But once I got the two free DLCs it started defaulting if sleeped during scenes."
