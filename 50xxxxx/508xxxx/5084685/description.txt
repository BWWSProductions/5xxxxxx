That is Pack of all the original campaigns in Heroes of Might and Magic IV, The Gathering Storm and Winds of War. Changes from the original files have been made only to make files readable by the game and to change the campaign's names so they are prepared for use and the game won't mistake them with the originals. Additionally all campaigns have been marked to carry heroes out of them. The tutorial map has been imported to campaign. No Changes in the Maps themselves have been made.
