Come on Over 1997


Come on Over is the third studio album recorded by country singer Shania Twain. It was released on November 4, 1997. The best-selling country music album of all time, it is certified 20Ã— Platinum in the US (2x Diamond under new RIAA), 2Ã— Diamond in Canada, 15Ã— Platinum in Australia, and 10Ã— Platinum in Great Britain. Twelve singles were released from the album, of which eleven were top five country hits in Canada.


The album became an unprecedented blockbuster success, breaking many sales records around the world and becoming the biggest-selling album of all time by a female artist (surpassing Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill), the biggest-selling country music album ever, the biggest-selling album of the 1990s and one of the biggest selling albums in music history.

Some of the reasons of its tremendous success were the availability of two different versions of the album (the original country version, released in 1997, and the international pop version released two years later) and the huge promotion that the album received, supported with an extensive world tour and an impressive 12 hit singles, all of them released through September 1997 through July 2000. 11 of those singles were released in Canada and the U.S., and all of them reached The Top 5 on the Canada country chart, including #1 hits.

Twain topped her own record with the release of Come on Over, beating out then Diamond album The Woman in Me (1995), as the best-selling country music album ever released by a female artist. It was, in fact, the best-selling album ever released by a female artist. Debuting at #2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 with a moderate 172,000 copies (3,000 units behind Mase's Harlem World), the album showed its consistency when it moved another 170,000 copies in its second week (a 1.2% decrease) to stay at #2 again behind Barbra Streisand's Higher Ground. The RIAA certified Come on Over Gold, Platinum and 2Ã— platinum on December 23, 1997. It sold more than 100,000 units in each of sixty-two weeks. The album's best sales week was its 110th week, during which it sold 355,000 units to settle at number ten (Christmas 1999). The album stayed on the top 100 for 151 weeks. On November 15, 2004, the RIAA certified Come on Over at 2Ã— Diamond, recognizing 20 million shipments throughout the United States[1]. Worldwide, the album has sold 36 million copies. Come on Over ranks as the best-selling album of the Nielsen SoundScan era in United States, with 15,478,000 copies sold up to April 2009,[2] ahead of its nearest rival, Metallica's 1991 self-titled album.
