Are you CERTAIN your drive has no audio cache? If not then your rips are not accurate and should be redone. 

Always leave the option to YES, even if it doesn't. This won't make others question your rip :)"
,no1uno.m8,2009-10-10T19:43Z,Whats the bloody point of taking a mono disk and making it stereo in FLAC ??
,snashforce,2010-09-03T07:22Z,"@ no1uno.m8 - The mix is mono.  There are still 2 channels.  No hard pans of vocals or instruments that many people dislike in early stereo mixes.  You want sound to come out of both sets of speakers on your stereo, not just the left one, correct? When you play the music the same audio will come out of both L and R, just as if you played the cd that was ripped for this upload or the original mono LP on a stereo system.  FLAC for lossless audio quality.  That's the bloody point."
