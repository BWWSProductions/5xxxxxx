,rhythmix,2009-09-07T22:58Z,Does this Rip have the grappling bug or anything in it?
[T],budakrist,2009-09-08T01:42Z,"Not sure if this has the glitch when you're on the second encounter with Scarecrow. After the second skeleton spawn you can't grapple up to the higher edge.


 Gravity Method:

Go into the \BmGame\Config\DefaultGame.ini file, and change the gravity from -1000.0 to something like -100.0 or -50.0, save the file, start the game and jump off an edge to your choosing, and try to float to the place you have to. It's gonna take a lot of tries, It's very hard to control batman when floating.

Again I'm not sure if this version works or has the glitch but I'm downloading it now and will post"
,falo007,2009-09-08T02:23Z,come on ppl seed
,Italiano83,2009-09-08T04:00Z,Everyone with the Second Scarecrow level Gripling issue.. i did what budakrist wrote.. the gravity method.. beleive me its very hard to control batman in air.. with gravity por afte 40 minutes of trying.. i actually could get close enough to the other side.. and the checkpoint sign started to load.. then i just click restart from checkpoint and i was already in the other side.. and was able to finish the level.. with no problems.. ive not being playing longer through the game so i dont know if later i will find antoher problem.. but so far.. ive passed that second scarecrow level..

[V],Shroo,2009-09-09T01:09Z,thankfully mods removed :]
,archang3l,2009-09-09T02:37Z,"Thanks for the release but I seem to have a little bit of a problem. I managed to get over the Scarecrow areas without any glitches and have managed to find workarounds to certain situations were grapling was pretty bugged, and am at 62% of the game. However, I seem to have an issue with the botanical gardens level, upon a second revisit. Just as I walk in the building and walk about 10 feet I can't get past an invisible wall that's apparently left over from the first encounter when the giant vine spawns there when you're trying to get out of the building. I've tried looking for grapel points, jumping over or crouching and nothing worked... I'm just bumping against air. Has anyone else had this problem?"
,Italiano83,2009-09-09T06:45Z,I won the game already.. and i can tell you archang3l that when you walk in the botanical gardens for the second time.. as soon as you open the door you have a big plant infront of you.. so that invisble wall your are talkin is definatelly that plant.. that for some reason is not showing in your game.. but anyways.. what you need to do in that part is move to your left or right i dont remeber.. and there you will find a little vent.. that is not seen while in detective mode.. look for it. and you will  be able to cross that plant from below and then come back further again...  hope you can make it. this game was so great.. even with glitches and everything.. felt so good wining it..

,IronBars,2009-09-09T16:28Z,"I had no problem with 2. scarecrow, but now I cant get over a wall in the abandoned tunnel. Cant get the graple to work. Any others with the same problem? This is just behind a door that opens, so no place to climb up to and start gliding from. I can see some enemies on the other side through the closed door I need to graple over.

Sometimes in this cave, when the door you enter is still open, you can grapple out and you are pulled to the middle of the ocean around Arkham island. Must then restarts ofc since stuck there on an invisible platform above water.

you enter this area in the abandoned tunnell from the Arkham ""Main"" area...second time you pass through there not so long after second scarecrow..... "
,GandhiCrib,2009-09-09T17:06Z,"Downloaded the game, and haven't even gone pass what the demo had, so I can't comment on any glitches (though i can glide). But what I'm asking is, can anyone get physx to work?

Because i tired going into the UserEngine and altering it, but it gives me an error that physx cannot be found.

I know my comp can run it, because it ran the demo with physx enabled.

Any solution or patch would be great, otherwise I guess I have to download another version, Physx is that important to me in this game."
,Arkyfox,2009-09-09T18:42Z,"
If your having trouble in the game with grapple or anything in general. There is a trainer on Gamecopyworld that will let you use the number pad to move on the X Y and Z axis.

Here is the link http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2009&f=Batman_Arkham_Asylum_V1.0_Plus_4_Trainer_By_KelSat!rar

,IronBars,2009-09-09T21:53Z,"the game crashes just after i float up, stops floating and grabs the ledge. Then.....crash! :( cry cry cry :)"
,ManoloCIA,2009-09-09T21:59Z,I can confirm that the grapple doesn't work in the abandoned tunnel. Gay. 
,IronBars,2009-09-09T22:10Z,phuu...just made it...trick is to get over the wall with float then run as fast as you can to next savepoint before crash. so glide over the enemies and through the next door...save and get back to them when you load game again without trainer....
,darkness000,2009-09-10T01:25Z,i can't glide.. that is my only problem

,stackerman,2009-09-12T21:20Z,there is a big glitch in the version of this game it's when you search for the doc.s not you get into her office through a air vent but when it is time to leave the grapple hook lauches you out of the game map all the time.. and it dose not let you get back when you rest it and do it again it will not let you lockon back to the air vent. i hope someone patches this game it is very good no im piss that im stuck with this glitch.

If this is the same section I am talking about there is a hole in the floor right under the vine, and I think a Riddler trophy in there. (Just using that as a point of referrence). 

All you have to do to get to the door behind the vine is climb up to the second or third platform on the water fountain turn towards the vine, And use your Batcable/zipline to go over the the vine AND the sign that is above it. (I think it says Botanical Gardens...).

,Kazinhu,2009-10-07T00:31Z,"I don't know why but my game run fine for a few minutes, and then it starts to lag like hell. anyone else experiencing this?"
,sebajas,2009-10-07T14:28Z,can I fix the game with using the reloaded crack? plz reply
,TMU999,2009-10-08T18:39Z,"I doubt it, since cracks just allow you to play the game without a disc in/without registering etc. They don't fix bugs in the game, and the bugs in this are because it's a leaked version. You should probably just get the RELOADED version - it's twice as big, but I'm getting 80KB/s off it. That's not amazing, but it isn't bad and it's more than twice the speed I was getting off this. Alternatively, read these comment pages and you can ""fix"" the bugs using trainers off gamecopyworld to bypass glitched areas."
,ryaneli,2009-10-08T21:20Z,"if you use the word noob. you need to grow up before you get pwned. I don't know why I ever read comments anymore. you guys keep coming back just to argue. there should be a limit on how many post you can do on one torrent. keep you children from making curious people read through pages just to see if its worth a download. Please notice no matter how much shit you talk about me after this. I won't post anything after this

 Thank you for the upload Gansuk!!
& Thanks to all that left comment worth reading."
,Gosudade,2009-10-11T06:41Z,"Hey Kanzinhu my game worked fine until i ended it, then i started having the same problem

Btw does anyone know where i can get the Insane night dlc?"
,ryaneli,2009-10-13T22:11Z,ok game works great. I'm 32% through and I'm chasing Harley quinn and I crossed the electric water crawled through the crawl space got to the room where I pulled the vent cage off the wall and it won't let me grapple up there? anybody else? nothing I can do about it and I don't want to start all over. 32% is to far for me to restart.

First of all, I'll show you how I did this.

1. For All Those People Who Don't Know How To Save

When you start the game after installation, you will be prompted by Windows LIVE to make a account so go ahead, make one. But on the second screen, click ""Create local profile"" and type the name in to create a offline account.

2. Fixing Grapple Issues

Download these:

Google ""batman arkham asylum pc glide.grapple.missing ivy fix"" and click on any torrent site that has it.

THEN START the .exe file before you play the game.

Download the crack from RELOADED..

 And Replace the files in the game folder Binaries to play.

That may fix your problems. =)"

It will only works for 20% of who have the game ""BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM"".....This is a collection of comments/complates over net  



 1.  Extract Batman.Arkham.Asylum.FullRip-KaOs

 2.  Install Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs (I think it not necessary)

 3.  You need .Net Frame Work1 Service Pack 1 (I think it not necessary)

 4.  You need .Net Frame Work2 Service Pack 1

 5.  You need .Net Frame Work3 Service Pack 1 

 6.  You need .Net Frame Work3.5 Service Pack 1

 7.  Update your directx

 8.  Move ""My Documents"" from C:\Dcuments and settings\.... to D:\Documents.

 9.  Install Games for windows by ""gfwlivesetupmin.exe""

 10. Copy ""msvcr70.dll"" to C:\windows\system\ and make the file into hidden and read-only.Some times its virus.

 12. Update your video card driver (I think it not necessary)

 13. If you want to enable PhysX, Change the ""PhysXLevel=0"" to ""PhysXLevel=1"" in the 
     file E:\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\BmEngine.ini

 14. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT! (Even, I am not garantee about working)

 15. If you installed PowerDvD, its process may will affect the game (I think it not necessary)

 And enjoy you're game !

,spiegelnder,2010-12-25T00:29Z,"After spending a total waste of nearly 2 hours trying to make this damn thing work I finally gave up. There are so many different comments of instructions, and most not really concise, and though I followed the steps carefully the game doesn't launch at all. I even downloaded and installed the KaOs fix but I keep receiving strange errors and other stuff.
How have some people made it to work...? No idea. Screw this."

,finisher489,2011-07-25T09:26Z,"This game freezes way too much for me, even at low graphics and 1024x768. Other games like GTA San Andreas, Star Wars Battlefront II, The Simpsons Hit and Run, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets actually run well in my PC at 1024x768-1280x800 but this game sucks at those speeds"

,manipwr3,2012-01-04T16:57Z,working 100% THANKS AWESUM GAME
,manipwr3,2012-01-04T16:59Z,i was stucked due to graphics glitch.when i exit batcave then after removing the shaft i could not move up due to glitch that doesnot allowed me to use grpapple.luckily i had a previous savegame backup so i replayed to that level and this time it worked so i am playing further
,manipwr3,2012-01-05T18:03Z,grapple glitches come in pirated copy of this game.the working way is to goto 'Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\bmgame.ini ' then find 'DefaultGravityZ= ' and change it to -90.0. now in game batman can fly so fly up to the ledge where you want to go thn go until game autosaves and quit and change it back to -1000.0
,t1n2,2012-01-15T14:58Z,how exactly do you save the game using windows live??
