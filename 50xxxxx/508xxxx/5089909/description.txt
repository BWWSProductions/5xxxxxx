Far in the distant future, the sun in its old age has swollen into a red giant! Mankind has long since migrated to the stars and lush, green terra is now,The Barren Earth. A group of humans returns to Earth, searching for military garrisons left behind on the planet after humanity left for the stars. They plan on brining them up to combat readiness and then use them in their war against the alien race known as The Qlov.  However, they are attacked by the Qlov and crash land on the harsh, unforgiving surface of the Barren Earth.

Written by Gary Cohn and pencilled by Ron Randall, The Barren Earth started off as a back-up story in Warlord and then earned it's own mini-series.
