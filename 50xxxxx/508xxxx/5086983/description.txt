Frank Turner's style is similar to Billy Braggï¿½s, and other musicians that have a background in punk rock. He shouts out what he thinks, and in an effortless style he doesnï¿½t make a mess of it. Sure, some words donï¿½t have to rhyme but the way Frank delivers it makes it sound perfect. ï¿½Live Fast Die Oldï¿½ is the first track on the new album and itï¿½s a re-phrase of that classic punk song ï¿½Live Fast Die Young.ï¿½ Unlike Frankï¿½s previous albums, this time he records with a full band instead of doing everything himself (except drums and pianos). On most tracks, mandolin, piano, harmonica, organ, drums and bass accompany Frank with his guitar. I believe for the most part Frank Turner just plays by himself at his live shows, but I could be mistaken. The strip down folk punk style would be fitting to hear live but Iï¿½d love to hear the full band at a show too!

I didnï¿½t really know of Frank Turner until I heard he was coming out with an album on Epitaph. Iï¿½ll be honest; itï¿½s been quite a while since I last loved an album on the label. I think if they continue to sign musicians like Frank Turner, they will get back on track with being a premier punk label. But letï¿½s get back to Frank shall we? The song that got me hooked was his newest single ï¿½The Road.ï¿½ The song just sounded very powerful, catchy and something I could see an entire venue singing along to frantically. His style isnï¿½t all shouting, he actually can sing like on tracks ï¿½Fastest Way Back Home,ï¿½ ï¿½Faithful Sonï¿½ and ï¿½Journey Of The Magi.ï¿½ ï¿½Sons of Libertyï¿½ could be my favorite track after ï¿½The Road.ï¿½ I love the subtle piano notes after each verse. The fiddle playing on the track reminds me of the UK folk rockers The Levellers, which I believe Turner is a fan of, Well everyone should be a fan of them but thatï¿½s neither here nor there.
