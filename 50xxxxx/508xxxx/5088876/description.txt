Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56

Patrice Oneal in-studio. Stephen King is an ass, Kanye is an ass / VMA 
stuff, crappy FM morning show having O&A related problems. I'm not 
struff, sorry.



Note: the 128k has a few minutes from the intro to a Guinness live read
that I decided to leave in as it was funny and precluded the actual
commercial. It's not in the 64k....

Also, tomorrow's 64k may not be up till 1 est or so - some RLS came up.

???I wonder if I could use a VPN to securely (and anonomously) stream XM 
202? Anyone out there have any experience with this???



Due to scheduling conflicts I will not be able to upload
the 09-18 and 09-21 shows until the evening of 09-21. So if 
someone can take care of that Friday and Monday I'm sure the 
pests would appreciate it. Thanks!

I'm doing some infrastructure upgrades in 
the next few weeks which should lead to earlier 
ups. That's the good news. The bad news is I'm planning 
on "retiring" from posting O&A (it's simply a logistics
thing) in December of this year. No point in upping
when someone else could be doing it faster. That's 3 
months to find a reliable O&A upper to serve the pests.

Edit: If worse comes to worse I can still do the 128k ups in the
evenings post December, it's better than nothing.
