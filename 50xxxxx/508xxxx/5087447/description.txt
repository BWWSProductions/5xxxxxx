Plan and implement fiber optic networks

Effectively design and deploy bandwidth-rich networks for major types of data traffic. Covering both short-reach and long-haul networks, Planning Fiber Optic Networks provides full details on all major fiber optic parameters and includes appropriate background theory and design calculations. You will find guidelines for optimizing SONET/SDH and Ethernet networks, setting up network topologies, minimizing signal loss and impairments, and using dark fiber. Real-world examples are included throughout this practical guide.
