PS: This is an original release disc. This is the baby I used to Twilight Hack my Wii. I'm not sure if Twilight Hacking will work if you run it from a USB Loader. The game, itself, was briefly tested on the Wii. Also note that if you plan to test Twilight Hack on a USB Loader, the exploit was blocked on 4.0x. Just Google it to find additional information.

PPS: I forgot: the coding on the data side of the Disc reads as RVL-RZDE-0A-0 JPN.
