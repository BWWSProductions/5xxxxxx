,kayez,2009-12-31T19:58Z,This game doesn't work when burned with imgburn or play on neogamma.  Don't download.  It's not usable.
,Demosthenes928,2010-01-03T12:31Z,"kayez:
I doubt you have modded your Wii in any shape or form, so don't go making accusations. I'll test this out on my Wii once I finish downloading and post results."
,Demosthenes928,2010-01-04T07:58Z,"Works perfectly so far, haven't ran across any problems."
,Trapnextone,2010-01-04T20:29Z,"Demosthenes, this is the first I've looked into wii torrents.  Is there any way you can send me a link or any information on how to mod my wii to get torrents to work?  I've been searching a little myself, but I'm not sure what's good information and what's BS."
,boof222,2010-01-05T05:47Z,go to gbatemp.net to hack your wii its got great guides its where i hacked mine
,rafflysia,2010-01-10T09:42Z,can this be played with dolphin emulator??
,defenceplox,2010-01-11T16:35Z,"works well on a virgin 4.2e wii with CFG loader v50
"
,megatremble,2010-01-27T21:05Z,"Works with soft mod Wii FW 4.2e,  using neogamma r7 and/or backup launcher 0.3.  cheers unfairy"
,motofox2,2010-02-09T00:23Z,I burned this game with Imgburn and it works JUST FINE!
,blombardo,2010-02-15T03:53Z,Used Imgburn at 2x speed on Memorex DVD-R and it worked fine.  (Though I prefer the simple up-down-left-right and two button simplicity of the original game... I will not be playing this complicated version)
,Tyeten_P,2010-02-23T21:11Z,"seeding, enjoy"
,koko-goal,2010-03-05T02:15Z,"Works beautifully. 

Burnt via CloneCD (the latest one) at 2X. Sony DVD-R
Softmodded Wii. 

Thanks unfairy and thanks to seeders."
,nolifeman,2010-03-31T20:46Z,"Worked perfectly using:
-Verbatim dvd-r
-Imgburn 4X
-Neogamma"
,dannbeau,2010-04-08T02:16Z,"works perfectly on dolphin 64 bit if you choose direct3d9 for graphics, wouldn't work any other way."
,inflikkt,2010-05-04T08:05Z,"bleh. I am totally angry @ this dolphin emulator. Game seems to load fine for me and the sound and graphics look great but i cannot get any response from keyboard controls.  Ive posted in the dolphin forums but no answers.  

I dont know what is wrong, in the key bindings it shows all the keyboard keys should be set.  

Im going to try to buy a gamepad and see if it works :/   ive never had any problem with using a keyboard for emulators until now.."
,angelarroyo22,2010-06-16T18:45Z,yo this game work perfect now i will try with dolphine emulator 
,quirkynature,2010-06-23T22:40Z,"@Inflikkt:

The keyboard controls won't work because the game needs you to swing the Wii remote to emulate Link swinging his sword. The keyboard doesn't have a motion sensor and...doesn't swing well. Get a Bluetooth dongle (it's amazingly cheap) and connect your Wii remote to your computer. Dolphin works fine that way."
,_4_,2010-06-29T08:15Z,"@blombardo: I love that one!

Downloading for dolphin. And yes I have a copy for the wii.

Personally Id rather play OoT."
,Nova666,2010-07-08T05:41Z,This is a fine upload... but a very mediocre game. Thanks anyway.
,char824,2010-12-09T04:49Z,thank u
,martiw,2011-03-07T00:13Z,"Thank You ! Works absolutely fine ! soft-modded, burned with Imgburn on DVD-R"
,viperguy,2011-04-01T16:53Z,"Why do I get a black screen freeze when tryin to start this game?
Softmodded wii, 4.3 with modmii.
Thanks!"
,CJames,2011-04-25T21:17Z,"How can I mod my wii so I can play burned games? Is there anyway to get Bannerbomb to work on 4.3u? Also, I dont have Super smash Brothers or Indiana Jones to do those two so is there any other way?"
,loman1997,2011-05-08T03:03Z,"my question is this, can neogamma support dvd-rw or is it only dvd-r becuase i have modded the wii and got neogamma and all of the other stuff but all of my iso's wont run on the dvd-rw discs and i dont have any dvd-r so does neogamma support dvd-rw discs?"

For Game play, I haven't runned into any trouble so far, Great Upload.

PS: Used 4.7gb DVD-R Disk."
,Ishtiyaque,2011-07-13T16:59Z,will it work on dolphin ??
,Xaronyr_EnCardier,2011-07-16T12:10Z,"Tested on a PAL Wii. Burned at 2x (Although, it knocked itself up to a steady 2.9-3x) and wasn't working with Neogamma 6 (Loads up perfectly fine, music starts to lag on the first cut scene, then I get an error on the cut scene where the girl is washing Epona), although it seems to be working perfectly fine on WiiGator's backup launcher 0.3."
,some1new00,2011-08-23T22:10Z,This torrent is being tracked. Just got a letter from my ISP. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
,unfairy,2011-09-07T11:29Z,"FYI, y'all need to use DVD-R if you choose to burn instead of USB load. There's no reason for me to believe this will work on PAL, as it is clearly labelled NTSC."
,indie_guy,2011-11-09T13:31Z,My Wii is NTSC and it plays PAL. I think it can work vice-versa too. (Softmodded 4.1 w/ NeoGamma & USB Loader GX)
,indie_guy,2011-11-09T13:33Z,"If this is scrubbed, does it mean it's missing files? Are they important files? I don't want to miss out on the full experience. (BTW I own a physical official copy)"

,adpotter,2012-03-18T16:40Z,I can't burn the .iso image. It says it isn't mountable or recognized. I tried on a pc and a mac and neither recognize it. I downloaded another game a while ago and the same thing happened. All my programs say the file is corrupt. How could you guys play it. Don't say that I didn't mod my wii because I did. The problem is that I can't burn it. Please Help!!!
,david_s_96093,2012-03-30T18:18Z,"Works great on my soft modded 4.3u..thank you unfairy, I will seed for a while.  Any idea how to get skyward sword to work?  The screen keeps going back to wii menu.  Thanks again."

,LinDERP,2012-06-09T21:38Z,"I cannot get NeoGamma to read the disc, even though it recognizes it as Twilight Princess. Atm I'm using the latest r9 beta and a memorex dvd-r. I used Free Iso Burner (I'm conserving hdd space til I get another one). It burned fine, but for some reason my wii cannot read the disc, only recognize it. Should I try an earlier version of NeoGamma or another backup disc reader?"
