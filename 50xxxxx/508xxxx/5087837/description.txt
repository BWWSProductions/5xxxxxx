JFK and the Unspeakable - Why He Died and Why It Matters
Publisher: Orbis Books | ISBN: 1570757550 | 2008 | PDF | 510 pages 

An education on the inner workings and intrigues of the our government. Those in real power aren't necessarily those that we elected. A real lesson on what really goes on at the executive level. A great detailed read. I recommend everyone read it and learn.
