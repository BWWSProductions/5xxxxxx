Hey, this is the same as the DOS version made in 1997, but modded and tweaked into an installer for Windows XP

This version has correct sound, video, and gameplay settings. No need to detect your audio/video cards

Included are the installer (300mb), two gameplay patches (crash fixes), and three .pdf files (walkthrough, manual, and cheats.)

Mission packs 1 and 2 are included, and require the patches listed above to play

Enjoy this classic rts game
