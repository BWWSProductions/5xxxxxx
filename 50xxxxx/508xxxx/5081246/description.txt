Grand Theft Auto
GTA is made up of a series of levels, each set in one of the three main
cities. In each level, the player's ultimate objective is to reach a
target number of points, which is typically achieved by performing tasks
for the city's local crime syndicate. Each level has its own unique set of
tasks. Successful completion of a mission rewards the player with points
and opens the opportunity to attempt harder missions for higher rewards,
while failure awards few points and may permanently seal off opportunities
for more tasks.

Grand Theft Auto 2
GTA2 retained the top-down viewpoint of GTA, as well as the car-stealing
telephone-answering formula of the original. The player has the ability
to explore cities on foot or in various vehicles. The aim is to achieve a
certain score. On achieving this goal the player then can proceed to the
next level. Doing missions awards the player more points than any other
method but are not essential for completion of the game.

Grand Theft Auto III
GTA3 inherits and modifies much of the gameplay mechanics from its
predecessors, Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2, combining elements
of a third-person shooter and a driving game in a new 3D game engine.
