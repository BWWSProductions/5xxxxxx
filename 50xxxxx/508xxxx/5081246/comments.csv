,mikels12,2009-09-09T16:20Z,hi it keeps asking me for the no.2 disc i've mounted the game and the audio one to seperate virtual drives GTA III is one i'm on about
[T],eyezin,2009-09-09T17:39Z,mikels12 unmount GTA3.iso and mount GTA3_AUDIO.iso to the same virtual drive.
,mikels12,2009-09-09T22:09Z,ok will try that i also copied the audio file to the directory where i installed it but will try that thanhks
,mikels12,2009-09-09T22:21Z,doesnt seem to be doing it (allowing me to put them both in the same virtual drive was thinking of burning them to disc but surely when its asking for disc 2 it doesnt mean the audio as when i try to play the game it loads up with music then asks for disc 2
[T],eyezin,2009-09-10T00:10Z,"So you installed the game then copied the audio folder inside the GTA3_AUDIO.iso to the games directory and the ran gta3patch.exe, making sure you directed it to the games directory. You then replaced the games .exe with the one provided and unmounted all images.   "
,mikels12,2009-09-10T11:37Z,thanks i've got it going now for some reason this time it had put the audio file in with the gta.iso so all good apart had a report of a key logger or somert dont know if it was with this ghame or not buit anyway thanks will have a play now cheers eyezin
[T],eyezin,2009-09-12T09:21Z,"key logger or somert dont know if it was with this ghame or not

Its probably your firewall asking to give the game access to the keyboard, If you don't your keyboard won't work.   "

,7ocetalo7,2010-12-22T14:57Z,Hi there! Nice torrent. I installed following your instructions and all smooth for about four days but now it's asking me for the 2nd CD. Any advise?
,ak47killa14,2011-04-10T11:31Z,"I am downloading it right now, I'll comment again when I find out if it works or not. "
,brickedmeat123,2011-07-08T07:38Z,"Actually I came here just to download GTA II xD

But since ÂľTorrent have an option to select which to download, then be my guest!"
,brickedmeat123,2011-07-08T07:39Z,Sorry I mean III
,Gemeral,2012-01-04T02:10Z,"Question:
     Well, I am getting the same response, but I am not sure I understand what to do; By game directory, do you mean the games folder?
Number 2:
     What do you mean by unmounting? Do you mean removing?
Number 3:
     Where do you put the audio file (Not fully understood I think I stated that, but just in case)?
Thank you,
     Gemeral"
