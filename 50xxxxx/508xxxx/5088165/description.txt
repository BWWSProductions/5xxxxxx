Greatest Hits - Gloria Estefan [1992]


	
Gloria Estefan Greatest Hits is the second compilation album released by Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan. It is her fourth album released after going solo.
After fifteen successful years in the music industry and numerous hit singles, Estefan released a Greatest hits album that includes many of her successful singles from throughout the first part of her career. To date, the album has sold 5.5 million copies.

Most of the singles released prior to 1992, both as a solo artist and along with her previous band, the Miami Sound Machine, are included on this compilation. However, fans were disappointed in the albums lack of ALL of Gloria and the Miami Sound Machine's hits. The US version ignores "Dr. Beat", "Bad Boy", "Cuts Both Ways" and "Live For Loving You." The international versions included "Dr. Beat" and "Bad Boy" in the compilation.
