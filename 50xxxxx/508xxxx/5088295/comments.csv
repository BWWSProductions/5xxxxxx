,malouphix,2009-09-14T11:10Z,"Thanks EZTV.

Anyone else notice recently piratebay torrents don't begin to download straight away, if at all?, not just this one.

It's like it can't connect to any peers. Works fine with torrents from other sites.

It's all good, just strange thing I've noticed over the past 2-4 weeks."

,hadtoregistertopost,2009-09-14T23:12Z,"EZTV = still just bot ? ;)
Or is there wiser reason why doesnt eztv add other trackers even its known issue that tbp trackers are down...
Xsaimex for example, has other trackers added as default, so works for EVERYONE, its not your con prob its tbp tracker.

So, recommendation/tip:

UNTIL eztv gets its shits together and adds other trackers too, DOWNLOAD XSAIMEX/other vip uploaders episodes.

Example:
at the moment, eztv (this one) doesnt connect trackers and wont dl much at all, same time ep uploaded by xsaimex is coming with approx 650kb/s (full rate for this 5mb), few mins left to complete :)

Or keep downloading eztv torrents without trackers, takes AGES, your choise :)

eztv uploads rocks, not trying to flame them, but for now its better to get other uploaders stuff. When they realize this problem, keep supporting them after its fixed again.

Sry for spelling, hope this was usefull for someone :)"
,petter_sundgren,2009-09-14T23:21Z,"thankyou eztv! really excited about last episode :-)

well i added the trackers from FrankieFingers and am dl at 400kb/s"
,hadtoregistertopost,2009-09-14T23:27Z,"Or add trackers manually, those who knows how to do that :)
(for bitcomet: right click on task, click properties, then second page and copy paste trackers into that list u see there)

But then again, why bother if u can simply dl the ones with trackers added, avi files aswell and vip uploaders, and nothing more needed to do than simple 1 click :)

Adding trackers is shitloads of work afterall, at least 5 clicks, whos willing to do that if u can get past it by 1 click lol ;)"
,elax666,2009-09-15T22:57Z,eztv rules my tv world!

eztv there were no new episodes uploaded. were they just not aired ? "
,Lonsman,2009-09-16T10:01Z,"Maybe someone can explain to me why it's necessary to cut off the MUSIC and credits? In my view, it only ruins the show...?? For all show...Hey, let's start adding Music and credits!!"
