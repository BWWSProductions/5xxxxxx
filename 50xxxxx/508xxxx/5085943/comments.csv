,FEARLESS1964,2009-09-13T17:50Z,DOES IT WORK ON 5.00 M33-6???
,8386839,2009-09-14T09:16Z,"Game is fully functional on my phattie PSP (5.00 M33-4)
thanks for sharing this.."
,TripleAAABattery,2009-09-14T12:03Z,"why does this seem like fake to me?
playing on my psp now and the graphics are worse than the previous versions "
,Genewitch,2009-09-20T20:16Z,"the game says shift but it plays like Pro Street.

You have to compete against ""kings"" same as pro street. It's also fairly linear, and the way you upgrade your car is to keep using it, no bolt on functionality like the PC version. It's kinda fun, i suppose, but burnout or flatout are better overall, i think."
,Kev0069,2009-09-21T09:33Z,"The game itself is terrible, i would recommend playing NFS Carbon instead.
I dont know whether the game or the rip is bad, but it has a lot of bugs and crashes often.
Tested on: PSP Phat - 5.00 M33-6
could be because of firmware?"
,kamikazepowa,2009-10-10T12:17Z,it's work but the game suck. NFS carbon was better
