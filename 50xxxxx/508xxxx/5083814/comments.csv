[V],Slickinator,2009-09-15T01:02Z,yeah sorry i could not have known so best thing to do is download this one uninstall other one and make sure you delete folder from program files and re install this and after installed don't update and make sure you turn off updates in the preferences for now till a new patch can be found
[V],Slickinator,2009-09-15T03:47Z,"also try this manual code 

378-970-1812

C198-3470-1EA3-C15F

but make sure you uninstall and del any folders in program files as u need to put the first three codes in also for this too work i did and back up and running and had newest update also"
,isepiq,2009-09-19T07:30Z,"OK, I UNinstalled, deleted install folder, REinstalled including doing the current updates at install time, told it to NOT do auto updates, & then did the serials & patch again.  Working as of now with auto update off.  I wonder if the manual dat updates that you can download would work without invalidating the install???  Will have to try that.
