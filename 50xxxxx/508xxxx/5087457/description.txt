Release Notes:  This is Zill O'll Infinite pre-patched with transgen alpha english
                patch. They have stopped work on this translation project for this 
                game. This is not a complete english translation but some text has 
                been translated to make the game somewhat playable in english. 
                What has been translated is the -Title screen menu, -Game menu, 
                -Battle menu, -Options, -System Messages, -Store Menu, -Map 
                Display Menu, & -Miscellaneus Messages.

Patch Bugs: There are 2 known bugs you may or may not encounter. One is the "enter 
            name" menu error, it seems that the game lacks a vwf and the text 
            display is not aligned with the real content. The other bug is a 
            lockup when loading a saved file in-game, using the menu feature.


Note: The main text in the Gameplay is in Japanese, unfortunately they didn't 
      convert that to english from the patch so you'll either need to understand 
      the language or find an english script.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, (This is for older fat ps2's)..you'll need to first remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Tayio yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.
