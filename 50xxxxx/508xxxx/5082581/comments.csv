,MoggyM,2009-09-09T01:00Z,"This is real stuff with good quality.

A little bit bigger that SIRE-release but with best possible quality."
,Dimreaper,2009-09-09T02:51Z,Sounds no different to my 1980s CDs. I call fake. 
,michaelingeorgia,2009-09-09T08:48Z,"I've only got a couple of tracks downloaded, but I got ones in particular which would demonstrate a much-needed re-mastering. HELP seems quite improved over the 80s release, and LOVE ME DO is dramatically improved, causing the original, by comparison, to sound like it's coming out of a tin can. TWIST AND SHOUT is certainly stereo now. I'm calling it the real deal... either that, or someone's gone to a lot of trouble to put off a hoax with some damn good editing.  "
,baggies91mkp,2009-09-09T15:48Z,sounds better than the other one i downloaded it could be the real thing
,Knuckles7,2009-09-09T20:33Z,Come on! We need more seeds!
[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-09-09T20:56Z,"Hey, listen to ""Eleanor Rigby""....same lousy old production. This is not the 2009-remaster!!!"
,poiuytman,2009-09-09T21:56Z,"Confused... most of the tracks don't seem any different from the 1987 masters, and Eleanor Rigby doesn't have the corrected channel that was fixed on the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, but it seems that all the early mono tracks are in mono. Not sure if this is real or not... the differences are few and barely noticeable for a supposed four years of remastering."
,MoggyM,2009-09-09T23:13Z,"I have downloaded them from Waffles and ppl there seems to thinks that this is real stuff.

,michaelingeorgia,2009-09-10T01:02Z,"According to several news stories I've read, including one featuring an engineer who was instrumental in this project, most of the changes are going to be subtle for the average listener, and many of the tracks were not changed at all. The majority of the re-mastering effort, they said, will be most noticeable by people using high end equipment; not so much, in particular, with these ripped MP3s on an ipod and crappy earbuds. 

By the way, I always thought the mix on ELEANOR RIGBY was brilliant to begin with. In a side by side comparison, this mastering job is, indeed, subtle, but definitely improved, sonically speaking, over the original. I think people who expect totally new and dramatic sound on each track are going to be disappointed. This is not like the digital re-mastering and tweaking that Lucas did with the original Star Wars films."
,poiuytman,2009-09-10T13:56Z,michaelingeorgia: Eleanor Rigby's original master had a synchronization error where the vocals shifted to the right channel slightly late into the first verse. It's very noticeable on headphones. George Martin corrected this on the 1999 Yellow Submarine Songtrack -- I find it odd that this correction would have been left out of the 2009 remasters.
,iceberg303,2009-09-10T20:54Z,"Many many thanks for this!

I wanted to know if the box set was worth the money and by listening to this it defiantly is.

For those wondering, listening to these, if you didnt know better, you would probably never know that these were not recorded within the last ten years. These are the best remasters Ive heard."
,flatus69,2009-09-10T22:46Z,"""converted to V0 from flac""

What does ""V0"" stand for?"
,iceberg303,2009-09-10T23:21Z,"on further examination about 10% of the tracks are badly encoded and will not play on many portable devices nor on the ps3 or 360

I wish someone would post the ISOs as some of them also have videos."
,sndtrk1982,2009-09-11T00:30Z,"Downloaded ""She Loves You"" from this set and opened it in SoundForge. IT IS MONO, NOT STEREO. This torrent is a FAKE."
,iceberg303,2009-09-11T04:38Z,"sndtrk1982 your a dumb cunt

http://www.amazon.com/Stereo-version-She-Loves-You/forum/Fx24CCBYGE55A24/Tx3T9EN0S0TCN59/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B000002USY

do some damn research there is no stereo version of the song and it wasnt remastered to be stereo, this is NOT a fake."
,Sephiroth912,2009-09-11T04:54Z,"Compared the Abbey Road tracks here to my CD and in the same stereo. Just on ""Come Together"" alone you can tell it's a little louder (they adjusted the volume just so that all the songs are at the same level but didn't go the way of Metallica, thankfully) and much, much clearer and crisper. This is the real deal. Anyone who doesn't think so, sit down, shut up, and enjoy it. I know I am. Thanks a bunch for the upload Moggy."
,king_pirate,2009-09-12T03:37Z,"Thanks for the up man!
And if anyone is still confused, this IS the real deal.
It sounds amazing."
,kindofblue02,2009-09-12T11:15Z,This is the real deal. Thanks.
[T],FaeGiN,2009-09-22T10:48Z,"I'm not downloading this as I would go for FLAC if I do.
I just had to point out to that dumb fuckwad fimblegimble.
Hey asshole!!!!  It says a lot about you that you seem to think a demonoid invite is somethign exclusive or amazing.#
Every fucker has one you twat!
Hehe what an idiot."
,roketjack,2009-10-24T13:41Z,"Try listening to Golden Slumbers (Abbey Road).
I havent heard this one but apparently the remastered features a much lower voice on Macca.."
,holyface,2009-11-16T09:32Z,"I just became a new member and I need to learn how to download. Please help!
I can't find any instruction to learn to use this site.
Thanks!"
,Movieguy26,2009-12-29T19:21Z,"Why is the bitrate so low? Should have done 320 dude. 

Sigh."
