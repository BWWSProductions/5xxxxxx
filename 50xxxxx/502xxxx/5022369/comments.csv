,BigSniff,2009-07-25T15:25Z,"Quick question extremezone, why would you upload a cam and dvdrip at the same time?"
,toblakai,2009-07-25T15:45Z,there was a problem during the night his account got deleted... and we are currently working to allow him to upload everything again :)... so he's uploading things in order of listing I assume...
,BigSniff,2009-07-25T17:21Z,Thanks for the clarification toblakai. I was wondering how his newly uploaded torrents had thousands of seeders within an hour of being uploaded.

,mrvoor,2009-10-25T17:25Z,"Dudes,

1 help, I'm having 256 kbps internet broadband connection in India. My issue is,

100 MB file takes around 1 hour always for download
So that Single CD movies take around 7-8 hours always &
Double CD movies take around 16-18 hours always.
Also seeding takes so much time.

Here in my country, due to power/internet problems i can't able to finish the downloads 

expected time.

I'm using uTorrent. In this program, on Speed tab, @ grid It shows 27-29 kB/s as maximum.

Is there any solutions to reduce the time? It will b helpful 4 me.

Thanks"

Yes, to include subtitles you need to re-encode the movie with the subtitles.  This generally means a slight loss in quality.  I use Handbrake, a free video program.  This program encodes the video as MP4, used for iDevices.  But it does a good job at keeping quality, so it is my program of choice.  Another program is called AnyVideoConverter, also free, but looses quality throughout the process.

To encode subtitles with Handbrake, make sure your avi file is named exactly the same as the .srt (subtitle file).  Click on source -> Video File.

Then you can change some settings on the tabs in the lower part of the window.  To add subtitles, click on Subtitles tab, then ""Add"""
