,spunkster,2012-04-29T19:53Z,"Beware - Dub Side of the Moon and Lonely Hearts Dub Band are encoded in 128k! Pretty shitty quality. The other two are VBR (bet. 188-216 kbps). I recommend getting the albums separately. 
Also, this was uploaded before their last two albums so they're not included: Dubber Side of the Moon, and First Light. "
