30 Days of Night

Real nice quality for the file size

Encoded with Handbrake

Plays well with VLC and on my ps3, haven't tested others (that's all I use)

On my ps3 hooked up to a 32" HDTV it looks great, i can't even tell the difference from that and the original DVD.

My first attempt at uploading a torrent so please leave feedback

I'm rocking a whopping 35 kB/s max upload so it might take a while, but be patient

Thanks for downloading
