Maybe someday somebody could post a torrent of all the hubble pics... I'm sure there are some interesting ones the past 20 years."
,zyzykwy,2009-07-26T05:02Z,"There are, but even the limited collectin I have is several gigs and it is not complete.  The NASA picture of the day site has a fairly good archive of many pictures from the past few years in good resolution and size.  http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html"
,the_Phyrexian,2009-07-26T20:40Z,I have some other torrents with pics from hubble and spitzer and also still a nice collection of pics offline :) looking for anything in particular?
