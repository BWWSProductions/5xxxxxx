I really love this show. The only thing I would change is it's name, it should be called: ""Idiots on the high seas""

It's only a matter of time until one of them is seriously injured or killed."

You'd think that the Nisshin Maru being Paul's nemesis for so long would prompt Paul to pronounce its name properly, but he doesn't - ""Nisshun Maru"" indeed."
