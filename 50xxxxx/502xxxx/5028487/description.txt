Always guaranteed to deliver quality product, Mike Sanchezâ€™s latest project finds him teaming up with Swedish outfit Knock-Out Greg & Blue
Weather for rockinâ€™ â€˜nâ€™ rollinâ€™, rhythm â€˜nâ€™ bluesinâ€™ tour de force. Just one look at the deluxe fold-out cover and you know this is the business -and
thatâ€™s even before you split it in your machine. When you do -whoa! Roy Brownâ€™s â€œCadillac Babyâ€ shuffles out at you and sets the scene for
what the press release aptly describes as â€œa potent cocktail of vintage-style West Coast rhythm and blues, New Orleans rockâ€™nâ€™roll, Texas
blues and Mike Sanchez boogie woogieâ€. In Knock-Out Greg & Blue Weather, Mike has found the perfect foil for his oh-so-authentic brand of
rockinâ€™ music, the result of this marriage made in heaven being one superb album thatâ€™s bound to please his growing legion of fans. His ability
to breath new life into the songs of Wyonie Harris, Percy Mayfield, Billy Emerson, Larry Darnell, Jimmy Liggins et al never ceases to amaze,
and in most cases he has the uncanny knack of being able to sound just like his heroes -but at the same time youâ€™re always aware youâ€™re
listening to Mike Sanchez. Thereâ€™s no point in trying to select standout tracks because just about every track is a highlight. But as an example
of what you can expect, try the following on for size: Leiber & Stollerâ€™s â€œHot Dogâ€ (done Jessie style, not Elvis), the so smooth â€œThe Voice
Withinâ€, a cracking take on Wynonie Harrisâ€™ â€œAll She Wants To Do Is Rockâ€, a terrific romp through The Nite Ridersâ€™ â€œWomen And Cadillacsâ€
and Big T Tylerâ€™s tailor-made-for-Sanchez â€œKing Kongâ€. The whole band -guitar, bass, drums, trumpet and two saxes -cook up a storm on the
T-Bone Walker instrumental â€œStrollinâ€™ With Bonesâ€. And thatâ€™s only the covers. Sanchez contributes a selection of original songs that include the
rockinâ€™ blues numbers â€œYou gonna winâ€ and â€œPoor boyâ€ together with the delicious â€œEasy Boogieâ€ -all of which sit easily alongside the vintage
toons. And just when you think itâ€™s all over thereâ€™s a bonus selection of â€œhidden extrasâ€ -20 minutes worth of â€œtoo-good-to-waste left-oversâ€.
These include Lloyd Priceâ€™s â€œJust becauseâ€, two goes at Richard Berryâ€™s â€œYama Yama Pretty Mamaâ€, another version of â€œKing Kongâ€ and other
goodies that are easily too good to be â€œburiedâ€ in this fashion. Yup, this is one cracking little album -just the sort of thing youâ€™d expect from the
most charismatic performer on the scene today.
