Allmusic.com review:

"Great dance material is featured, again by Ashford & Simpson.. The Boss (May 1979) was a gold-selling album, followed by the platinum-selling Diana (May 1980), which featured the number one single "Upside Down" and the Top Ten hit "I'm Coming Out."

Wikipedia bio:

"The Boss is a 1979 album released by Diana Ross on the Motown label. This album was written and produced by longtime Ross collaborators Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson and marked her return to Top 40 radio based on the strength of the title track, which peaked #19 on the pop singles chart, and #12 on the US R&B Chart. The following singles "No One Gets the Prize" and "It's My House" became club and R&B hits respectively. The album was subsequently certified gold by the RIAA and ultimately sold about 850,000 copies. The album was remastered and released on CD in 2001 with 12" versions of "The Boss" and "It's My House" as extra tracks."

Amazon.com bio:

"While hardly as superfine a Ross vehicle as the Chic-produced Diana of a year later, 1979's The Boss does offer a few tracks of prime Ashford and Simpson-helmed disco-pop. Foremost among them are the title track (also heard on this augmented CD reissue in an even better 12-inch remix), "No One Gets the Prize," and "I Ain't Been Licked." All three offer a mix of sass and vulnerability that's among the diva's most pleasing stances. "All for One" and "I'm in the World" try too hard in their ways to reinvent Ross's showbizzy anthem "Reach Out and Touch," but neither truly offends."
