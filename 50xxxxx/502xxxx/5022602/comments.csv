,deearedee,2010-12-17T05:31Z,Can someone tell me what Dual-Audio means? How can the spoken languages be both Japanese AND English? I downloaded this hoping there would be an option for English Subtitles and Japanese audio but only had English Audio. I'm kind of confused.
,kortizol,2011-02-01T21:40Z,"you can use many media player such as VLC, which support many sound track any you can switch between them. It is very simple similar to DVD movies...:) "

,stonedmau5,2012-01-02T02:05Z,can you upload the complete naruto shippuden series in english? please please please (:
,phat_71,2012-01-09T10:01Z,"Eww...Naruto in english is horrible..absolutely horrible. Every one of them sounds annoying in the dub, and Naruto's voice makes me want to stab little children it's so annoying.

Not that I'm a dub-snob, some anime just have better voices in one language or the other is all. Naruto is better in Japanese, but then you look at Bleach and the jap voices are horrible, the dub voices fit the characters much better XD"
,phat_71,2012-01-09T10:06Z,"As for anyone experiencing sound related issues, it's your player not the actual file itself. I'm at a bit of a loss about this one actually. If I play it with VLC it works perfectly, just like it should. 

But even with all the codecs I've got I can't run it in Media Player HC, which is where I run everything all the time. Oddly enough this is the first time such a thing has EVER happened.

To make an actual point, 9 times out of 10 issues about video or audio playback problems (such as the one about the audio being screwy) have absolutely nothing to do with the file being bad and everything to do with the codecs or video player you're using. Update codecs often enough, and keep your players up to date, and you should almost never have a problem. And as most people will tell you, VLC is an amazing player, that almost never runs into any sort of trouble with anything you throw at it :D"
,Creades,2012-01-30T10:01Z,"Thank youuu!!!

Now I only need look for Spanish subtitles or have a lot of patient for wach it whit  English Subtitles...
