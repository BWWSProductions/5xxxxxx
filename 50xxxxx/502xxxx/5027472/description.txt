REMEMBER THE NAME


Miss Howard TV for August stops by and wows the staff.  Artie muttered a quiet, despondent evaluation: "Holy shit." Melissa told the crew she sold cars for a living: "Some people come in just to get in on the test drive."
Melissa was particularly passionate about cars with Hemi engines: "Because of all the horsepower. It's just very powerful." Melissa added that she loves them so much, sheâ€™s gotten the nickname, â€œHemi Girl.â€   They test her knowledge against Ronny's car knowledge.  I found this girl really annoying though and she's not THAT hot to where you could look past it.
