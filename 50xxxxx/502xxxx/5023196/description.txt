Customer review from amazon.com:

Three giants come to mind when you think of R&B and Soul,Sam Cooke,Otis Redding, and the man singing the Beatles standard ,Hey Jude,Wilson Pickett records this and other rough and ready tunes starting with,SAVE ME,HEY JUDE,BACK IN YOUR ARMS,TOE HOLD,NIGHT OWL,A MAN AND A HALF,SEARCH YOUR HEART,and Steppenwolf's,BORN TO BE WILD. Duane Allman takes the lead with a tight back up studio band and the Sweet Inspirations ,all for 'Wicked' Pickett as the gritty singer eases through each song on this short eleven song classic compilation called ,HEY JUDE - minus Mustang Sally and Midnight Hour, Wilson Pickett's,Hey Jude, stands tall on it's own will and power - people make the world, people like Wilson Pickett made the music.
