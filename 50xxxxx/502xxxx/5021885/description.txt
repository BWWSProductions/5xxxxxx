Back in the 1980s, the DeBarge family was music R&B music royalty: El DeBarge and his siblings James, Bunny and the rest were like a younger version of Michael Jackson and the Jackson family. But struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as poor-performing albums and prison time for a couple of family members led to the family's decline and fall as a recording group. Well, it's been 20 years since the group broke up, but a young family member is now trying to make her mark in the music industry: 19-year-old Kristinia DeBarge, (pronounced kris-ti-NEE-a) daughter of James DeBarge (aka Janet Jackson's first husband) has an album coming out sometime this summer via Sodapop Music, Babyface's new record label. The first single, "Goodbye," was co-produced by Babyface and The Pentagon.
