With the defeat of the Gang of Four and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's era of reform, Chinese filmmakers began to create works that cast critical looks at the injustice and excesses of the preceding decades. Xie Jin, already the grand old man of Chinese cinema and its most respected director, made this deeply moving study of the clash between personal feelings and Party loyalty during the 1957 Anti-Rightist Movement, a result of the Hundred Flowers Campaign. When Song Wei's fiancee Luo Qun is denounced as a right-wing traitor by Party official Wu Yao, he is sentenced to ten years' hard labor. Song Wei breaks off her engagement, and eventually marries Wu Yao. Years later, after the Cultural Revolution, political currents have shifted; Song Wei demands that her husband, now a powerful Party official, seek Luo Qun's rehabilitation, but Wu Yao has no desire to open up old political and emotional wounds. Xie Jin captures the sense of fear and caution of a generation that had experienced over twenty-five years of devastating persecutions.
