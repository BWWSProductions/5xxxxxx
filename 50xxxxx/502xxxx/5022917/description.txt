ABOUT THE SUBS ( READ THIS )

English, Brazilian Portuguese and French subs (srt files)

Well, unfortunately, there's no sub on DVD Box Beckett on Film. Searching around, I find this English subs with some sync problems. Most of the lines were too shorts. So, I worked a little on re sync. It was very difficult because the dialogs are too fast and the text too long. Anyway, I thing the final result is good and, despite a few lines, the whole is acceptable. Later, I found French subtitles that matches with this release. They are on torrent too. The Portuguese subs were translated by me, with the help of two Brazilian translations of Beckett's work. There are on net Romanian subs for a 2CD version. I thing there's not difficult to join this 2 files into one. Enjoy!

[i]Waiting for Godot[/i] was written in French in 1949. In the first scene, two men, Vladimir and Estragon, wait on a lonely country road for an appointment with Godot. After a while Pozzo enters, leading Lucky on a rope. They talk. Godot fails to arrive. The second scene is a mirror image of the first. The Irish critic Vivian Mercier called Waiting for Godot a play in which 'nothing happens, twice'.

'Astride of a grave in a difficult birth. Down in the hole, lingeringly, the grave-digger puts on the forceps. We have time to grow old. The air is full of our cries. [He listens.] But habit is a great deadener.'
â€“ Vladimir, Waiting for Godot
