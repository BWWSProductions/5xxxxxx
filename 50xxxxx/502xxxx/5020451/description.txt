For the tenth anniversary of Phil Lynott's death, a new best-of collection was issued in most parts of the world except for America: Wild One: The Very Best of Thin Lizzy. While the Euro-version was a single disc that contained 19 tracks, the Japanese version contained a bonus disc comprised of ten rare live performances, all on par with Lizzy's classic 1978 in-concert set, Live and Dangerous. In fact, two of the tracks were planned to appear on the aforementioned set, but were dropped due to time constrictions â€” "Bad Reputation" and "Opium Trail" (both are must-hear, kick-ass versions). Featured on the live disc are renditions of "Are You Ready," "Chinatown," "Killer on the Loose," "Hollywood," "Got to Give It Up," and "Dear Miss Lonely Hearts" (the latter originally being a Lynott solo composition), among others. The best-of disc contains all the expected Lizzy faves, such as "Jailbreak," "Whisky in the Jar," "Waiting for an Alibi," "Still in Love With You," and more, but surprisingly, the song that the album is titled after is not included (which originally appeared on 1975's Fighting).
