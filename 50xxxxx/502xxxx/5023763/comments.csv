,The.Norse.Crown,2009-07-26T20:06Z,"If and when TPB ends I know of a place. A place that even uses TPB trackers! Their highest seeded film (Burn After Reading) right now has over 200,000 seeds! Want to know more? Then go check out btjunkie,org! It dos'nt have the awesome features of TPB but after a little getting used to you'll be out of the stink, and back in the pink (unless your gay, then you probably want to reverse that sentiment...). You'll thank me and yourself later!
Mods nuke Halach!"
