Encoded 320kbps [Lame] mp3.

Burning Fiction are a Australian punk rock band from Perth, Western Australia.
From the ashes of previous ska punk and hardcore bands, the five guys that make
up Perth's Burning Fiction came together in late 2005 to play the kind of fast,
melodic punk rock that they were fans of. Burning Fiction self-released their
debut EP, "Material" in 2007 which has since brought with it a string of
international support shows over the years with some of the bands who have
influenced their sound such as Strung Out, A Wilhelm Scream, No use for a Name
and Lagwagon.

Don't Lose Touch is Burning Fiction's debut album. It was released on June
19th 2009. Bringing honest, fast, trend-free punk rock to a thriving Perth
scene, Burning Fiction entered Sovereign Studios to record their eleven track
debut album with Aidan Barton. The recording captures the intensity and
enthusiasm of five young guys having a good time playing the style of punk
rock they live for.
