Drivers for running Windows. These are the same drivers bundled with the DVD. In case you lost your copy. Snow Leopard features slightly new drivers such as HFS+ read/write support so you may want to find those instead.

These drivers are specifically for model MacBook5,2. You can find the model in OS X by clicking Apple/About This Mac/More Info/Hardware. This was the white model for sale between January and April 2009. The model is similar to every Macbook White version and drivers may work on others, but is untested.
