Release Notes

Demon Tea is proud to present the third official album by Swedish genre
defying electronic music producer Simon Rahm aka Psilodump. Psilodump's
sound may be hard to define or explain, but could be vaguely described
as flexible, eclectic and maybe even somewhat schizoid. Filled with small
details, lush melodies, mysterious darkness, complex but groovy rhythms,
clever cuts and breaks, shifting or parallel moods, spiced up with a wild
imagination, on the edge to overkill, Psilodump still manages to deliver a
recognizable "Psilodumpish" sound. What at one moment is lively, wild,
energetic, loud and hard, can the next be quiet, passive, mechanical
and/or neurotic, if not all entirely at the same time. Simon started
composing electronic music in late 1991. Although already getting his first
record deal offer in 1996, it was in 2001 he got his first official release; a
vinyl EP on the Swiss experimental electronica label Domizil, followed up
the next year by another two vinyl releases, one on Swedish breakbeat
label Sound of Habib, and on on Swedish tech house label Q-Records. In
2006, after numerous releases on netlabels, such as Monotonik, Kahvi
Collective, 8bitpeoples and Candy Mind, Simon released his first CD album,
"Psilodumputer", in strictly limited quantities, on a small Swedish label,
Ninjani Diskus. Shortly after, Simon was inspired to set up his own label,
called 476 Records, where he released his second CD album, "Never Heal".
Simon has also done remixes for artists such as Kraftwerk, SlagsmÃ¥lsklubben
and BodenstÃ¤ndig 2000. Simon has diligently been performing his music live
since 1996, at both big commercial and underground rave-parties, clubs and
cafes, festivals, culture events and demo parties. To date, he has covered
about 120 gigs, in 15 different countries, including France, Germany, UK,
Russia, Italy, Israel and Spain - alongside artists, acts and DJ's, such as
Neil Landstrumm, Chris Liebing, Cari Lekebusch, Thomas Krome, Infected
Mushroom, SlagsmÃ¥lsklubben, Bit Shifter and Kleerup. In Sweden, he has
performed at notable festivals such as Peace & Love 2008, Norberg Festival
2008, Arvika Festival 2005 and 2002.
