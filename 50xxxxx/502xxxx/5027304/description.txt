A (very) tiny IRCd connection by Vulcan. At just 9kb vIRCd is anything but your typical connection. It features rock solid connectivity with auto-connect, reconnect, join, nick in use change and ping-out check. Version update checker, revenge kick, auto identify and even a built in multi sock filler/flooder all in a package so small and blindingly fast and lightweight it will run on any computer system big or small without notice.

Bonus: Optionally including Vulcanâ€™s vOPS dialog a power packed 5.0kb channel control dialog featuring, selectable ops, mass ops, access control, kill, own, kick, flooder mass kicks and channel modes all just one button away.
