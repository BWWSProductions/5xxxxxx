This is basicly a collection of skins ive created by editing the default skin for 

Virtual DJ V6.0 and above. Anyone that uses Virtual DJ will know how hard it is to

get skins for this software, and is also the reason behind this torrent.

This is my first attempt at doing this and i have tested them all and work exactly 

as they should.  Nothing flash just some small adjustments.

For Virtual DJ v6.0 and above only.

Hope you like them and please comment.

ENJOY!
