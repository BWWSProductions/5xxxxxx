,avi_benny,2009-07-29T15:22Z,"hmmm, probably something wrong with ur computer, cause with 724 seeders, i doubt that a lot of people getting that problem. Try finding audio codecs or decoders or something. or use the KMPlayer, it works really well."

,niceandblue,2009-08-22T15:12Z,@arsenal74 Japan have to wait until December. :P
,mike18xx,2009-08-27T08:13Z,Video quality very grainy. Tinny 25fps. CBR audio wastes a lot of file-space.
,TauTau154,2009-08-31T04:29Z,"Sound makes me want to choke someone, sounds like it's coming out of a 1920's radio...even when it's not the old opening sequence. x_X  Video's par at best.  Looking for another uploader (crosses fingers)"
