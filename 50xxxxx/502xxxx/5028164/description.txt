CRUSADER - NO REMORSE:

The PC hit CRUSADER: No Remorse makes its way to the PlayStation. You are a Silencer, an elite enforcer for the World Economic Consortium. The work you do is for the good of the world, or so you believe. You soon discover the corruption of the Consortium, and realize your only choice is to join the resistance. However, the members of the resistance do not trust you. Take on a wide variety of missions: help your new friends escape from prison before they are executed, cripple a city by destroying its power generators, or find a top-secret piece of intelligence to help plan the next attack. Thankfully, you have lots of guns and plenty of things to blow up in every mission. Will you be able to gain the trust of the resistance? Can you stop the evil plans of the World Economic Consortium? Play CRUSADER: No Remorse and find out.
