===================================================================================
Welcome to SwiftShader 2.01 :
===================================================================================
This is the SwiftShader 2.01 for 32/64-bit Windows.

Created by : The Mastermind   Email : the1mastermind@gmail.com
===================================================================================
SwiftShader is a revolutionary software-only 3D renderer that provides 
DirectX 9 features including both Pixel and Vertex Shaders and can be more 
than 50 times faster than Microsoft's reference rasterizer. SwiftShader 
achieves this level of performance through the use of TransGaming's SwiftAsm 
runtime code generation system.  SwiftAsm allows developers to easily and 
efficiently generate highly optimized code entirely at runtime. SwiftShader 
uses SwiftAsm to translate both shader-based and fixed function geometry 
and pixel pipeline operations into high-speed x86 SSE and MMX code, which 
is then cached for later reuse as needed.

NOTE: Use of the SwiftShader 2.01 is subject to the enclosed SwiftShader 
License agreement.

System requirements
-------------------

* x86 CPU, SSE support recommended
* Basic 2D video card - no 3D card necessary!
* Microsoft Windows 98SE, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista 
* 128 MB RAM
* 25 MB free hard disk space


Installation
------------

SwiftShader 3D renderer is packaged into two DLL files:
 D3D8.DLL and D3D9.DLL

These DLL files can be dropped into a directory containing an application
that uses Direct3D, and SwiftShader will automatically be used in place of
the built-in OS version of Direct3D. Note that some applications may load
the D3D DLL directly from the Windows System32 directory.  Such programs
will not work directly with SwiftShader without modification.

In addition to the DLL file, an optional configuration file can be used 
with SwiftShader.  This file, SwiftShader.ini, can be put in the 
same directory as the application, and can be used to fine tune performance
and quality settings.  The commercial version of SwiftShader includes an 
API for changing many of these settings programatically at runtime.


Multi-core Support
------------------

SwiftShader can use multiple CPU cores to speed up software rendering.  
Using SwiftConfig or the SwiftShader.ini file, you can determine how many 
threads will be used simultaneously.  By default, SwiftShader will use as 
many cores as possible.  Note that SwiftShader is currently optimized for 
single-processor multi-core configurations due to inter-core bandwidth
limitations.


Changes since previous version
