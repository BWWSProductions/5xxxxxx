Huckapoo - Huckapoo (2005)
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huckapoo)

It was not released, but thanks to BunnyFooFoo in "Candy Pop In Love" we can listen to Huckapoo's album here.

I think this album was awesome and worth-listening, you should give it a try (just need a bit).
First, of course with "Perfectly". Next with "Crazy for the Boys" and "I Should Have Said I Love You". Finally, must-listen "Supernatural".

Enjoy music and seed for it, people!

Huckapoo is a fabricated Girl Group created by the people behind Dreamstreet. They have appeared on various Disney complications, and have toured around the New York City area.

This CD was supposed to be released, however, the band broke-up after Angel Sparks left to pursue an education. Some of these songs are from their EP (I got it at their concert) the others are from Soundtracks they've appeared on.)
