-General-
I know that it is already free to download it from NCsoft, but I had problems with resuming while I was downloading it.
I made this torrent for speed and flexibility. (I'll try to seed but i don't have the best upload speed in the world...Please, be patient at the beginning :S)

---------------Instructions---------------

1. Extract the files somewhere(I'll use the default, "C:/Program Files/" here)
2. Run NCLauncer ("C:/Program Files/NCSoft/Launcer/NCLauncer.exe")
3. Go File->Settings->Advanced tab, select your region and click "OK"
4. Right click->Properties at "AION" ("NOT INSTALLED" menu)
5. At "Install Location" browse for AION.bin (C:/Program Files/NCSoft/AionEU/bin32/AION.bin")
6. Click "OK", once more, again... (Now AION is under "INSTALLED" menu)
7. Right click at installed AION->Repair (Wait until it check all the files...if some files are wrong it will download them again)
8. Click "Play" and enjoy :)
