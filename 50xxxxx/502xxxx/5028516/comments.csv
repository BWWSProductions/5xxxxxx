,D0gmeat,2009-07-28T22:30Z,Will this work for anyone not signed up for the Closed Betas? The Open Beta's not until late August?
,yiamiyo,2009-07-29T00:34Z,"As I stated, the only difference between downloading this torrent and downloading it from NCSoft is the speed and flexibility...You'll still need an NCSoft account with a Beta key...


Beta Schedule

    * Closed Beta Event #5 July 31-August 3 Focus: Elyos and Asmodian levels 1-30
    * Closed Beta Event #6 August 14-August 17 Focus: TBD


(Never heared about open beta...:S)"
,seercirra,2009-07-31T02:07Z,"thanks for this, i appreciate it.
but please... what is happening with your connection?

i was going at about 900k till 80% and now its just fiddling around, dropping to as low as 10 and sticking around 20..

so i tried the NCsoft downloader again and im now getting a solid 400 - 500. so thats looking like getting done first again now :("
,yiamiyo,2009-07-31T02:40Z,"I'm seeding with 90-100 kb/s..
There are 32 leachers...xd"

,harm99,2009-08-13T16:22Z,"Awesome torrent much faster than NCsoft site!
Keep it up for seeding :)

thanks all in advance"
,lage93,2009-08-15T00:16Z,"Thanks Seeders! I am at 30% now, it have been down to 100kb/s and up to 1300kb/s, but most time it's been like 800kb/s! much better downloading it here than NCsoft. Thanks again ^^ hope ya'll will be seeding more now ;d"
,zipz33,2009-08-15T05:19Z,hey where do i get this thing called beta key?:D
,lage93,2009-08-15T10:53Z,"zipz33, I don't think you can get beta key without preordered it. I bought it via steam for 59.99Euro, And it costs 12.99Euro a month. tho it havn't come out yet so I'm playing the beta now, this weekend :p gonna log in now and try an priest x)"
,bbpwnt,2009-08-15T13:57Z,"Any idea if this will work for us US players too? I thought I read we both use the same client and the only thing that determines your location is your login name and PW when it comes to EU/US players but I could be wrong.

Hope this does work for US players though or im fucked for playing the game this weekend."
,zipz33,2009-08-15T19:52Z,so if i preorder it and ithink its boring  how i do then? then i wasted 20 euro:D
,D0gmeat,2009-08-20T22:48Z,Open beta for English users opening soon... :)
