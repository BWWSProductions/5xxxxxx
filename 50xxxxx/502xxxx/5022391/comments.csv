,Yellowbelly,2009-12-02T14:02Z,For all of you who are on here looking for movies....do not follow any link that promises you a site where you can watch the latest movies for free.....they make you fill out a survey (which in turn will overflow you with spam) then they say your video player needs its latest update....as soon as you click yes you are downloading a herpes like virus (when you try and run virus removers or delete associated files....up pops the Blue Screen of death).  Please use common sense and try to keep your downloads to trusted TPB users.
,zapenstien,2009-12-04T20:54Z,"Okay I'm gonna be completely honest about this film. It has to be one of the funniest if not the most funniest movie I have ever seen!

I actually had to pause it several times because I was laughing so hard I had to get the tears out of my eyes!

Yeah it's that funny! On a scale of 1 to 10

,11241xXeyeXx14211,2009-12-14T02:30Z,I gotta say extremezone you have been a trusted UL and i have all the goods left from aXXo. Does anyone know what happend to him? O and can anyone tell me a free reliable program to put my DL movies into a dvd format and put those formated files onto a dvd? Thanks ahead of time. I know you guys know your shit so this would be the best place to ask for help. And what type of discs would be required for all of this? So thank you extremezone and to you pirate bay users for seeding and helping.

if you want to burn avi to dvd, ""The Film Machine"" can do it. Click the link, find the ""free video software"" section, and click and download ""the film machine."" I buy DVD-Rs and they work just fine.  If you want a fancy one, find a torrent on piratebay of ""Xilisoft AVI to DVD Converter"". Thats the one I use.

,XxM24Ty,2010-03-16T23:29Z,"I have no complaints with video or audio quality, and I can be picky at times. The movie is geared a little bit to a young/middle age generation, and be advised that if you do not like to here the ""F_ word"" about every 20 seconds for an entire movie, then this movie may not be for you. The cussing did not bother me, but I know lots of people that would find this movie funny but would not watch it due to all of the swearing. It will be interesting to see a cleaned up version for broadcast TV."
