"Dicks Diamonds" regulars Dick Strawbridge & Jim Milner are joined by Andy Middleton (Chaos Crew) for the Grand Final.

The two finalists from the semi final, "The Wheel Nuts" and "The Carbon Consolidators", are pitted against 'wild card' team "The Tree Musketeers" to take on "Dicks Diamonds" in the Grand Final. 

The challenge : build a radio controlled flying car.

The overall winner of 3 rounds, gets the furthest run-up to the finale cliff jump.

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. So please, do your part.
