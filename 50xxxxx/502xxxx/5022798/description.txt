Enjoy the qualifying as it happened...

I will be uploading the Full BBC One LIVE coverage of the Hungarian Formula 1 Grand Prix 

tomorrow. 

Please note that there was a temporary transmission fault during the programme from the BBC 

for over 4 minutes, which I have edited out. I have left 2/3 seconds in so you know where the 

fault occured.

Please seed for as long as possible

Enjoy

*NOTE* To retain smaller file sizes and achieve the upload as quickly as possible, the video 

has been encoded from MPEG2 to AVI format at 1200kbps. Still Excellent quality, more than 

watchable even on a 42" LCD TV.
