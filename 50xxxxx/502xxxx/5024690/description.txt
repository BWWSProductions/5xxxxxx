The band spend a few minutes improvising before Save Me tonight, 
during which Freddie does a vocal exchange with the audience, 
using bits he used to do during Now I'm Here on previous tours. 
He also sings the words 'Keep Yourself Alive' a couple times towards the end. 

Before Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Freddie leads the audience through a couple choruses of Teo Torriatte, 
done a cappella. The second time around, Brian plays the chords in the background on his acoustic guitar. 

Freddie sings "Jump, jump, jump to it" a few times in the middle section of Another One Bites The Dust. 
His favourite singer was Aretha Franklin, and this is the chorus of the title track off "Jump To It," released just a couple months earlier. 

peace, love and shannon hoon
