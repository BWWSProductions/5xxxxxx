Autumn's Bleeding - Autumn's Bleeding - 1999
-------------------------------------------

Introduced to a friend at Milwaukee Metalfest 1999, this band seems to be another unique one that showed up and disappeared.  I have very little faith in most underground metal, but this is one of the few that made it to my collection and continues to remain there 10 years later.
