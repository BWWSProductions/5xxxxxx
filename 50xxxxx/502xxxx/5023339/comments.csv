,Syf,2009-12-24T16:53Z,Whats the difference between PAL and NTSC???
,Black666Widow,2009-12-26T16:52Z,"games have different releases for different regions, 
PAL is European
NTSC is American.

some consoles have region locks, so u cant use games other than from your own region. but since ur downloading this game, it means ur console is hacked, and that means it should be able to play games from various regions =)"
,shawshankredemption,2010-01-21T22:00Z,"Please seed, I'm stuck at 94,6%, been downloading this for 2 straight days and sometimes it downloads at 800kb/s for very brief periods.. come on, seed a little more.."

,Lyssa,2010-05-24T19:46Z,Hi love your torrent it's works great and all and just wondering if you could upload the ffx (not ffx-2) to also working for emu?
,ryujinXryuk,2010-05-25T08:56Z,did it work guys with pcsx2?
,nanank,2010-06-10T11:08Z,well. i have the NTSC version. and it work with pcsx2. just a little bit slow when FMV. but the ingame is great...make sure your PC is a dualcore and strong enough...
,jtundra,2010-06-11T17:30Z,@nanank Can you confirm that is doesn't freeze after the djose temple? I have been looking everywhere to get a new save state just to skip it but so luck. I just dont want to start over and the same thing happen with this one :(. Thanks
,jtundra,2010-06-11T17:32Z,Just to clarify Im using pcsx2 and the version Ive been using is the NTSC version
,Gdubness,2010-07-23T01:49Z,???
,lozza,2010-09-19T18:27Z,"its english pal, download the torrent you stupid people and find out. It has pal on the name of the download."
,alex0008,2010-10-13T17:06Z,"@cdub6959

I've actually gotten a seeder by asking for seeds.
Also, I go to the pages of my torrents (and my favorites from other uploaders') now and then to see if someone has asked for a seed."
,heyman1981,2011-03-17T10:35Z,"Thanks! if you have Pal Ps2 and you dont want the shitty gfx and black boarders, make sure you get GSM (GSModeSelector) and run at Pal 60hz it will look 100x better

If you emulating it wont matter :)"
,druid513,2011-04-24T10:20Z,opening cutscene is fk up
,silvershadow22,2011-04-27T16:35Z,"Guys Please Please Please Pretty Please seed :)

,chumbz,2011-05-22T15:49Z,"currently downloading this one guys. Please keep on seeding. Ill help once im done

Im nearly finished playing the FFX, i did not realize there was FFX-2"
,xXBluRXx,2011-07-30T18:01Z,cutscene problem hit f9 (might have to hit f9 when game starts though)
,shenomega,2011-09-13T16:37Z,the game is Slower than ntsc version and 1 problem.... THERE IS NO CHEAT CODES!!!! 
,matias676,2011-09-25T10:08Z,what gives? its getting about 9-10 fps
,elturbo9077,2011-10-28T04:52Z,it works ok but you need like 20 macs to make this working at 60 fps 
,steelllynx,2011-12-01T00:37Z,"I'm using pcsx2 0.99 and the game hits 160 fps sometimes (sometimes only 15)

Go into the GS plugin and change it from DX9 to DX10 and it will go much faster.

Remember to use F9 again after the movies finish playing or it will go really slow."
,Maturame,2012-01-15T04:43Z,I'm actually having the same problem as saladbowl was having back in 2010 I think. The file that was torrented wasn't an iso like I was expecting. How can I get this file to work on pcsx2?
,Risen197,2012-02-11T19:05Z,"Amazing Torrent, seeding at a fast pace for all
those with downloading issue's. Not tried the to play it yet but getting high speeds.

I shall comment again when it's done"
,Risen197,2012-02-13T13:02Z,"Ok, i'm back. Runs faster then most torrents but FMV's are glitched. Very happy with how well the game is, not crashed once.
