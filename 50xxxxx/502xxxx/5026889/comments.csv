They're not recognized so I can't get past the part in the first level with the crows. Also, is there a way to make the text more visible?

Thanks again"

I enter the ""Story mode"" menu, then see what appears to be empty save game slots, or empty profiles, but when I press enter I get a message window where I have no options than to press esc to close. "
