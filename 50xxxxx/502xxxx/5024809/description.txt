Arthur Dent is having one of those days when you have trouble taking in all the information you get. He hardly has time to take in the fact that his friend Ford Prefect wasn't born on Earth before he learns that the Earth is going to be destroyed. He hardy has time to take in the fact that he has just been thrown into the vacuum of space when he learns that he's on a hijacked spaceship with a galactic celebrity. His adventures bring him to Milliways, the Restaraunt at the End of the Universe, where he has time to go over his quest to find the meaning of life during dinner, until a time travel accident lands him and Ford back on Earth, with no companion but the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He is in for one hell of a ride.
