Baby Face Willette - Six Albums - Discography - Jazz Organ

There is an air of mystique, an alluring attraction in jazz circles, to those highly talented musicians who shone brilliantly for a short duration, then slipped into obscurity. Jazz organist Baby Face Willette is certainly one of those figures.

Roosevelt Willette, 1933 - 1971?, was the son of a minister who was introduced to the organ, as many others, in church, an influence which would define his style and direction. In the early 50's he played with various gospel and R&B groups, and reportedly put out a few singles around this time. He worked his way to Chicago in the late '50's and eventually went to New York and got involved with the jazz scene there.

We pick up on his trail with the Blue Note releases in 1961 of Lou Donaldson, â€œHere 'Tis,â€ and guitarist Grant Green's â€œFirst Stand.â€ This would prove to be his definitive and prodigious period, as he in the same month, put out his now collectable â€œFace to Face.â€ He would go back into the studio a few months later and recorded â€œStop and Listen.â€ This session was again with Grant Green, and is a stellar set. Considering Blue Noteâ€™s musician roster and reputation, this record was right on the groove for the period, and is recommended still.

By 1963 he had formed his own trio, and after signing with the Argo label in 1964, he released â€œMo-Roc,â€ and â€œBehind the 8 Ball.â€

He apparently resurfaced in Chicago, playing local gigs from the late '60's into the early '70's, then seemed to vanish, leaving only his few recordings as an enduring legacy. Even his death remains a mystery.

His work with Grant Green stands out, and remains vital in a contemporary light.
