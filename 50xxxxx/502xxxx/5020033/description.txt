Marvel Age was an imprint of Marvel Comics intended for younger audiences, including small children. Unlike the standard comics published by Marvel, which often take place in story arcs spanning several issues, each Marvel Adventures comic tells a standalone story.  The idea was initially established as the Marvel Age imprint in 2003. Initially, the idea was to reuse the early plots, written by Stan Lee in the 1960s, in a modern day setting, with new writers and artists retelling the stories. The stories would be published in the standard comic book format and quickly collected and reprinted in manga-style digest size. Several titles from Marvel's failed Tsunami line, as well as several other Marvel series, were also collected in this format and released under the Marvel Age banner.  In 2005 the Marvel Age imprint was rebooted as Marvel Adventures.
