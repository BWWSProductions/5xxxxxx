I'd really appreciate it if you seed this as much as possible. I have a very slow upload speed.. :/ so it's hard to get it out there. I just wanted to get a torrent up of this because I couldn't find one anywhere. Just help me out a little, at least until there's a good flow of downloads and seeders.

Thanks,

Hype.

P.S. This is my first torrent, you should feel honored if you're downloading it.
