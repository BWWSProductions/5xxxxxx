V = ?

whats the quality like?"
,mybroinlaw,2009-07-25T21:57Z,"All these seeders and leechers and no comments on the quality,wtf?"
,SteamRadio11,2009-07-25T22:18Z,"I would be tempted to comment on quality, if I could only download the thing! 
I have 46 seeds and 49 peers connected, and a speed of 0.3kbs - it will take me 9 weeks at that rate, so I aborted."
,Big-fat-cone,2009-07-26T02:21Z,"I'm at 28.4%, I will let you know about the quality when its done."
,aeroplane22,2009-07-26T05:27Z,"When I first booted it up.. I was thinking.. Holy fucking shit, what is this.

But, he zooms in the camera and the video quality is actually pretty nice. Audio is standard for a cam.

Cam/TS Rating:

V: 8
A: 6"
,Big-fat-cone,2009-07-26T15:06Z,"A = 7 

V = 7

Overall its a fairly good cam. Its watchable for me."

,MeTylerdurden,2009-07-30T23:36Z,"Travolta is due for a good film, he is usually top notch or suck juice  "
,microbi,2009-07-31T20:14Z,"Saw it on cinema. OK film. Really nothing special. Actually seen films like this, with ""about"" same idea before (many). For the film I would give 6/10. Some actors from old tv-series. With out Travolta this movie would have sucked big time."
,frankgw,2009-08-01T10:05Z,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS TERRIBLE UPLOAD...VOLUME HAS MASSIVE ECHO AND NEAR THE END ENGLISH SWITCHES TO SPANISH AND BACK AGAIN..PLUS IT IS A VERY DISSAPOINTING FILM AFTER ALL THE HYPE..NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL
,J33SEJ,2009-08-02T07:21Z,Thanx Extremezone (No bullshit cryin like a baby about the quality as it wasnt a waste of my time as the torrent runs itself No cryin like a bitch about how good the actual movie is!

,jackie226,2009-08-02T14:30Z,"Thanks for another Great Download....For a Cam, this is great. It is  truly appreciated by many of us........As for YOU KNOW WHO!...moaning AND COMPLAINING is not what comments are for. Comments by definition are: observations, Or when Someone provides  information about the topic. Constructive Feedback, etc.. tHERE ARE SOME spoiled people out there. Maybe you really should go and buy the dvd, since getting it for free isn't good enough.

,crazi25,2009-09-11T06:47Z,"why would you download a telesync or let alone any divx file of a big hollywood blockbuster, the director intend you to experince high quality 1080p picture and 7.1 channel carefully written to produce the ultimate experence, if you watch a file like this, you obvious has shit equipment and no fucking class or sence of quality"
,swashbucklingbuckaneer,2009-09-17T19:56Z,"Video is watchable.
For best audio I used crappy speakers because bass overpowers it

,Kamikaze5156,2009-12-15T01:34Z,"complete crap. if you can even hear what the actors are saying, all the people that keep walking in front of the guy taping this at the movie theatre make it hard to watch. dont waste your time"
