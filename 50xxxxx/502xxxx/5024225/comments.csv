[T],eddie1969,2009-07-26T17:50Z,"teabags87:

It is trash like you which gives piratebay a bad name. This has got 1 seed and 57 leachers at the time I write which is just after you.

Has it not occurred to you that it could be a problem down your end?

Why don't you try uploading something yourself and then you will understand that it sometimes takes time for the trackers to kick into action.

People go to immense effort to put together these torrents for your enjoyment. Show a little respect and if you are worried about the number of seeders then try seeding yourself. I imagine from your attitude that you have never seeded anything in your life.

PS. Thanks Sheila. Some of us appreciate the hard work you put in!"
,teabag87,2009-07-27T05:02Z,"eddie1969:

you're a fucking idiot that has no idea how to interpret a sentence.  I said ""it sucks this has no seeds""

AT THAT TIME, THERE WERE 0 SEEDS and 70 LEECHERS.  I would of loved to have downloaded it and seeded, but i couldnt if there were NO SEEDS.  So... the problem is at my end? I had no way to supply a seed for the torrent

I don't upload my own things.  But I do seed things I download.  And that makes me trash? your just a fucking idiot.

I never insulted the uploader

seriously, you're a fucking idiot. 

might wanna consider suicide

YOU are the trash of pirate bay cause YOU'RE the stupidity of the community that complains about stupid shit when they should in fact just SHUT THE FUCK UP"

,DonPatch,2009-08-01T22:51Z,"Thank you for the up! Enjoy watching things like this. History channel and some whiskey and a cigar after work  hoorah

,cooolway,2009-09-06T06:07Z,"wow, sheila6, you could have given me some credit as you did just take the contents of my torrent file. please search in PB ""The Most Evil Men/Women In History"""
,Onizuka3,2009-09-24T04:36Z,"I had to release an evil laugh after reading the comments. Muwahaha. teabag87 is right. Eddie interpreted assumed the worse (like the dipshit he is) and then attacked the poor guy. Makes for a pretty interesting display of stupidity, but I'm sure feelings were hurt in both ends. That's why it's better to stfu. Better advice from teabag I'm sad to say."
,Onizuka3,2009-09-24T04:38Z,"BTW it's bullshit that Henry Kissinger, George Bush, Nixon, Johnson, & Dick Cheney aren't on here. That is indeed a very small list that excludes many other evil Americans. Funny how this documentary only includes evil men from other nations.

(Coming from a 19 yr old born & raised in New York)"
,schmitty84,2009-10-20T01:56Z,"Well, to be accurate, teabag said there were 70 leechers. So someone had to be downloading it. Which it turn if someone finished the download, someone had to be seeding as well. Why couldn't he have done the same as the other 70 instead of being a fucking idiot? More often than not the seed/peer ratio doesn't update as often as it should. Which everyone will notice upon downloading something. On here sometimes it says 16 seeds 2 leechers. Only to find out once in utorrent that it has 50 leechers and only 12 seeds. So maybe both of you should shut the fuck up. "
,schmitty84,2009-10-20T02:10Z,I meant 57 leechers
,iSze,2009-12-20T11:19Z,"In 1,000 years, Sanzee will make ""The Most Evil Men in History"" documentary on the SUPER HISTORY TV Channel (Telepathic Vision Channel)

Why? National Geographic > History Channel

Hail Sanzee!"
