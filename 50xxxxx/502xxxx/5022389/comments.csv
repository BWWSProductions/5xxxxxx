I always burn them to a DVD and when ever I do that, I go through the effort of putting in full animated menus with full features, trailers, and what ever I can find, and by the time I get done with it and the effort I put into it, the movie then comes out on DVD a month later. I am looking for a good quality video. Is this a cam?"

Umm... So you think your saving bandwidth by streaming it instead of downloading it? Either way it gets transferred to your PC."

Shitty cropping job...missing at least 10% of the sides and top of picture as evidenced by alot of cutoff heads and only being able to see the ""N"" in VULCAN when they display the first scene change to that planet to see a young Spock at school. "
