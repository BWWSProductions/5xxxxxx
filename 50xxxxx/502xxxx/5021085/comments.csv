Tack för ett mycket bra arbete."

At the moment, i am focusing on english releases, and scanlations, so my plans for the rest of the danish Yoko Tsuno, Gammepot and Natasha are on hold.
I do not plan to buy the english release of Yoko Tsuno, so someone else will have to scan those.
I will scan more Linda and Valentin, IF it comes out in english, at the moment all i can get my hands on are scanned.
No clue if Red Kelly is out in english, but if they are, i wont work on them, dont care for it.
And Jeremiah is attempted out in english a few times, you can find the 2 first albums, under the title Survivors. A few more issues was released more or less at random, but not something i plan on hunting down to scan."
