,zbig169,2009-07-25T10:38Z,"Sorry I forgot about subs... It' looks like the is no any subs on this DVD. There are 5 sound tracks
eng DD5.1, eng. DTS-ES, french DD5.1, french DD2.0. Subs for this movie are easily available elsewhere, but I did not any 'reverse engineering' 
with DVD so I did not put subs either."
