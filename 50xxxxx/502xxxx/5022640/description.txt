B-17 Gunner: Air War Over Germany is an air-combat simulation game based on the real-life obstacles faced by the men of the American 8th Air Force. Control six gun positions in the famous B-17 bomber to fend off attacks by enemy fighters. The game includes 25 missions and 5 types of realistic Luftwaffe enemy aircraft. 

My warning: 
I played this game and I think, that its unvaried, monotonous game! Really good idea for game players, but effect is poor. And games with B-17 theme are only few.
