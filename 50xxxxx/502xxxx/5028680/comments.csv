I hate stupid people. That includes critics of me..so if you want to flap your trap you'll be talking to yourself. I don't recheck my comments like a GD internet DORK thinking this is a message board.
The Truth is always The Truth and nothing changes this. Nothing people say about The Truth matters. No matter how much one might whine and insult The Truth shall not bend to your whim. People may cover up The Truth for a time, but it usually comes out.
I speak only truth. :)
Have a nice day."

,remy1492,2010-07-08T04:32Z,"Thanks for this upload. I bought a chinese copy off of Ebay and the subs were apar with a 1st grade translation, way off in timing and definition. Couldnt make it past the first episode.

The subs on these are spot on and done by a Russian speaker. Only Ru and Eng.

Its two large 8gig ISO files.
It took me a few months to download since there aren't many seeders.  Just be patient. I will seed as long as I can for you cheloveks.

If you like RU WW1/2 war movies, try Admiral and Zvezda. http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/archive/index.php/t-116050.html"
