EON (Ian Loveday): 1954-2009  R.I.P.

"HE WHO CONTROLS THE SPICE CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE!"
(The spice must flow...)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mostly the work of Ian Loveday, Eon was an early hit on the acid-house club 
scene with sountrack-sampling trance hits like "Spice," "Basket Case" and 
"Light Colour Sound." Loveday was an electronics fan from early on, 
beginning his recording career during the mid-'80s with a simple setup 
including only a drum machine and keyboard. His first proper Eon single, 
1988's "Light Colour Sound," was pushed along by a close friend, Colin Faver, 
who played the track during his sets for the noted pirate station Kiss FM. Two 
singles from 1992, "Basket Case" and "Spice" (the latter sampled Dune), 
became proper club hits in America as well as Britain, and debut album Void 
Dweller was an early full-length success for the dance world.

Several tracks on the album had benefitted from collaborations, with Depth 
Charge's J Saul Kane and Peter "Baby" Ford (Loveday returned the favor 
with production for a track on Ford's Bford9). He also provided remixes for 
Bizarre Inc.'s Energique album, then branched out even farther with singles 
for Ford's Trelik Records (recorded as Minimal Man) and Kane's Electron 
Industries label. No LPs were forthcoming, but Loveday continued to record 
increasingly minimal, trance-inspired tracks.
