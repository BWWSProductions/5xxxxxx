,Digbigpig,2010-07-22T04:00Z,thanks to some seeders a while back alot of us are at 56% now
,RS232C,2010-08-06T17:28Z,"we're stopped at 88.3% I know how frustrating it is to upload and then watch fools and idiots who get it not support the upload after they get it selfishly and just kill the transfer when they get it all........Listen people.....P2P only works by peers supporting peers. the original uploaders are kind enough to offer, EVERYONE should seed after they get what they transfer for themselves. not just for a few hours, but periodically come back even after a day or so and restart the transfer again to help out. ESPECIALLY if your ratio is lower then 1, but certainly if its lower then 2. or even more. the original uploader may have other things to offer with their bandwidth, so if they're stuck trying to upload something like this to all 103 leeches, thats to much of a burden. "
,RS232C,2010-08-13T06:26Z,for all you guys who claimed it was at 99.9%...you obviously ditched after you got it for yourself...because I'm stalled at 87.8 and it says only 92.5 is in the swarm.....
,PikachuCLS,2010-08-23T02:14Z,"Don't Worry Guys! If I manage to download it, I will let it seed! If it works, be nice to me in the future! ^-^"

,M1K0,2010-11-14T15:32Z,"stuck at 99,9% wtf is up with that?"

,ibr4him,2011-08-05T11:06Z,i hate dubbed subs. where can i find plain video and separate subs?
,kastheone2007,2011-08-15T19:35Z,"@ibr4him

It says subbed, is that not what you want?"
,ibr4him,2011-08-16T11:55Z,"@kastheone2007
these are hard subbed. i want plain videos, i mean videos without subs. i couldn't find so far :("
,ibr4him,2011-08-16T12:05Z,"If I need subs, I prefer soft subs because you can edit them. Also hard subs are old-fashion and they decrease the quality of video. Since you're not really encoding the video itself, the quality of the soft subbed version is a lot better than hard subbed version."
,markusminix2,2011-09-02T18:50Z,"Seeedddd please, don't be selfish"
,markusminix2,2011-09-04T02:31Z,"God,,, is this torrent has been left? Many peer, no seeder.. poor me.."
,oOoVEGITAoOo,2011-09-12T22:25Z,"Quality looks VHS but its better than any other Naruto torrent on the bay with Subs.

There is an issue with episodes 27-29, 27 and 28 are the same episode but it doesn't seem like there is a missing episode... it's weird I can't find whats missing.

What's also weird is it seems like there is missing content in episodes like e-68, I specifically remember the Jounin with toothpick spitting it at the Sand dude and them clashing... o.O odd."
,SeedingTheFields,2011-09-13T02:17Z,"Downloading,  but also have my Upload set at 1.5MB/sec.  Follow Suit."
,SeedingTheFields,2011-09-14T03:04Z,Severely cut back my seeding.  I have 226.20% ratio and downloading no faster.  When I get the file I will seed at max bandwidth until my transfer allowance runs out.
,Monkeries,2011-11-21T08:09Z,is this site any good??
,rexfd3slvr,2012-03-29T02:47Z,It's in japanese with english subtitles if anyone was wondering
