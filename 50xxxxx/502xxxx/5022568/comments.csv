as far as i can tell all other homebrew still works though, and i can still play other backups"

,javed8,2009-07-27T19:35Z,"If you use USB Loader GX you don't have to update system menu.  There's a few short steps to follow to get it to work, but for anyone who doesn't like to update their system menu it's an excellent alternative.

,justanotherguy_2386,2009-07-28T13:57Z,I use USB Loader GX fully updated and with version 4.1 and never had any problems with any game before but this one doesn't seem to be working for me. It gives me the 002 error and when I turn on the fix for it it just doesn't load. It will sometimes go back to the main menu or just freeze up. Anyone else have this problem or a fix for it?
,Gregbmil,2009-07-29T07:07Z,"I have rev14 and NeogammaR6 and the game starts to boot, but then just returns to the Wii Menu.  I've tried many times and it's always the same"
,crapdog,2009-07-31T00:25Z,All you need is the alternate .dol and the game works flawlessly. Google the alternate .dol and put it in the correct folder and the game works perfect...

,whoami022002,2009-10-14T08:01Z,"I used following steps
===========
OK I FINALLY GOT THIS WORKING. Took a LOT of messing around. Here is a straight answer as to actually how to get it working:

I am using system menu 4.0U and cIOS 13a. This is for the NTSC-U version. (The PAL version also works now as well)

Install NeoGamma r6 and set the options in Region to Force Video - Disc and leave everything else off and default. Set config options to anti 002 fix ON and alt dol to DISC. now when you launch the dvd it will say main.dol on the alt dol line. press the control pad right and it changes to PLAYER.dol. launch it now. You should see the intro video for motion plus and be booted back to system menu.

Load up NeoGamma again. This time around leave all your options as they were, except turn the alt dol to OFF. Launch it again, it should now load everytime without issue.

I also was able to get the PAL version working on my NTSC system on NTSC TV by having all region options turned on. IE. VIDTV YES, Country Patch YES, Force Video DISC and Patch Video ALL. I hope this helps anyone who may still be struggling! Good luck."
,banditomexican03,2009-10-27T08:05Z,"This is the first backup I've tried to dl and burn it worked like a charm!
FYI you need wii motion plus.
thanks, will seed."

WHOAMI...

i got it to work finally... 
really appreciate your post.
thanks again!!"
,mattlovefanny,2009-12-23T03:09Z,Hi first off it works and it doesnt work pls help at first i couldn't even start up the game but i read a couple of comments and it finally boot up but right after the ''put the strap around your rist blablalba'' it tells me can't read disc look in onswer manuel plss help!!!!!  
,robertohoudini,2009-12-26T19:23Z,"Works perfect for me (at least it loads, shows video, allows to start but cannot continue because I don't have motion plus yet). But seems to work perfect. My gear is a Wasabi DX chipped, with last update, which only allows NTSC games in my case. If chipped before upgrading to last update, it would also read PAL or other games. Bottom line, download is real, game works, trustable uploader (I have downloaded Rec room games from same user and works perfect). Muchas gracias WII SOS!!"

,sister_kelly,2010-01-04T07:06Z,"@GuitarGuy44, have you set the alt.dol settings to disc and then changed the .dol file to ""Player.dol"" and watched the Wii motion + video yet? If not, do that and it should work from there.

Also, thank you so much! Been wanting this. Confirmed working on menu 4.2U with NeoGamma R7 :)"

,trom2004,2010-01-06T19:00Z,Works but requires Wii Motion Plus hardware to play (small attachment that is bought seperately to improve accuracy of the Wii Pointer).
,Bamboo9,2010-01-07T23:06Z,"I'm getting the same error as Guitar44, The wii just resets.  I'm using USB Loader GX  on menu 4.2u and this is the first game it doesn't work up to date.  @ Sister_Kelly : I have no clue what you  mean by changing the .dol  I have a dol option in GX but I have to load it from a sd card or somewhere and this download doesn't include any .dol files.

Any help would be appreciated."
,clvilla13,2010-01-08T17:37Z,"Hey folks! Thanks for the download. BUT, I'm having the hardest time with this ISO. I've tried both NTSC & PAL versions and continue to have the same issue:

I've watched the motion video, wii restarts, go back to neogamma to load game (from disc), I see my mii ready to jump, I push A then it freezes... Every single time!!

I've tried many fixes... Any clue what I can do to make it work?

Using:

Neogamma 8
and yes, I have the motion + device connected"
,KARNAG3,2010-01-17T08:26Z,"Hello everyone,
i downloaded this a while ago but since i didnt have the wii motion plus i havent really tried it before and im having a problem, heres my issue:

i have looked all over the internet before writting here ... Im really desperate..

I was able to do the normal procedure to watch the video about wii motion plus by selecting the file from the disc or from a file on my sd card (.dol).
This part works fine. After this i come back to the wii menu...go back to gamma, r6, r7 or r8, i make sure the option to start from the .dol file isnt activated and then it boots up the game but right after the warning about how to hold the remote, i get the error message that says it cannot read the disc and that i need to read the manual. I have tried so many combination, so many gamma version. I even tried to patch the iso with isopatcher and putting it to 249 but once i have burned it with imgburn and try it, theres a dvd error code that comes up what ever i do when i try to launch the dvd in gamma...so patching it is not the solution, at least not in 249. Please ohhh please someone help me! I have read so many threads that says the same thing over and over...i want it to worl to :))) thanks in advance guys!!"
,SmoothCrim,2010-01-24T07:12Z,this game is awesome. Wiimotion pluss.... Can't wait for red steel 2
,SmoothCrim,2010-01-24T07:38Z,pls seed. 
,happyendin21,2010-01-28T18:24Z,"First of all, let me say thank you for the download and the support.  At first mine kept booting back to the menu.  Then I went to Neo Gamma and went to config then altern .dol then selected disc instead of sd.  It then went through the motion plus demonstration video.  When I loaded the game a second time with all default settings it started, however like ""clvilla13"" my game would freeze every time i got ready to jump out of the plane.  I then proceeded to  burn another copy at 1x speeds using imgburn.  And that did the trick.  First time it went flawlessly!  So I hope this helps some of you out there.  Thanks again for the great backup!"
,rickyoon,2010-02-24T21:25Z,"Very fun. Works. You need the Wii Motion Plus.
you NEED to watch the instructional Video in order to play.
If your game will not load, buy/rent a game that is already compatible with Wii Motion Plus, and watch the Instructional Video. After that, this game will work without any problems."
,inkdrgn,2010-02-27T19:27Z,To get this to run with USB Loader GX for the first time select the alternate dol then let it pick the correct one. That will let you play the starter videos no problem. after that turn it back to the default and the game will play perfectly.

[T],ctang,2010-03-09T06:31Z,"nevermind, i got it working...this is the first game i have tried since the whole softmod ordeal...for others like me what i did was load NeoGamma R8 and made sure region options\Force video was set to disc, then went to return to menu, then config options\altern. .dol and made sure it was set to disc, then return to menu and go to launch game on dvd...it says loading disc but then i get an error...i ignore the error and return to wii system menu and magically it is now where games that are bought load...is this how it is supposed to work or not

,chuchunesme,2010-05-20T02:16Z,"I've confirmed this as working off of a USB hard drive. I use WiiFlow for my access program for the drive. At first I would click to play the game and it would go back to the home screen so I changed the DOL setting from main.dol to player.dol, backed out of the settings and clicked play. It played the initial motion plus video and then exited to the home screen. I went back in and changed the DOL back to main.dol, the game plays fine. Thanks for the upload!"
