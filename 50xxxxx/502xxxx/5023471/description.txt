Vardis were a pioneering three-piece New Wave Of British Heavy Metal band between 1978 and 1986. 
They were from Wakefield in England, and consisted of frontman Steve Zodiac on guitar and lead vocals, Alan Selway on bass and Gary Pearson on drums.
Original Vardis records are rare and are valued in most record collector's books and guides. 
An original copy of '100mph' including the enclosed tour guide and poster has an estimated value of approximately Â£500 ($940).
