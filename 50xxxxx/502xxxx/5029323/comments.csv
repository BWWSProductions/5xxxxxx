,oracle_omaha,2009-07-29T06:14Z,And the reason a hour TV show - max 350M is 1+ G? maybe using avi - which does HD just fine and obviously not 3 times the size
,illuminant,2009-07-29T06:43Z,Don't comment if you don't know what your talking about. This torrent is 720P it would still be 1+ GB if it was an AVI. The Matroska format allows the native surround audio encoding and (much better) H.264 compression in the same wrapper which the AVI format does not. If you don't have a TV that allows you to see the huge difference I suggest upgrading or simply waiting for the 350MB release.

Does seem like EZTV is les concered about limited bandwidth users these days. Lazy little aggregator ;)"

,gregersamsa,2009-07-29T12:34Z,"This is all very interesting, but there's a minor snag: This show is a complete dud. It is so boring and poorly scripted that no matter how high the screen and audio quality is, it still is a pain to watch. I want my money back (for the space on my hard drive)!!!"
,Alaemon,2009-07-29T13:29Z,This show does need work I only watching to see if it does get it together. If I was paying to see the show I would not waste my time or money as it is right now.
,mrkennedy,2009-08-05T15:05Z,This is episode 5. Frist episode was a double episode.
,velcroman0001,2011-02-01T01:08Z,"DON'T wrap things in .MKV!
Keep It Simple stay with .AVI"
,velcroman0001,2011-02-01T01:13Z,"There no advantage wrap files using .MKV.  All you do is make people move away from using you as a seeder.
Keep It Simple. Stay with .AVI"
