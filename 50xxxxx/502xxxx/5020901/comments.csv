,chaotix66,2009-08-22T06:37Z,"Thanks for the effort, but this is not the discography...it is all the major releases...with the exception of Salival..."
,raidercrazer,2009-11-14T05:58Z,chaotix66 is right.............. no salival
,lordoz420,2009-11-16T17:07Z,I must concur.   Needs salival.  Good set tho.

,euphorial,2010-02-21T20:15Z,You all need to stop complaining and be grateful for what you do get. These people don't HAVE to upload it in the first place. Just saying.
,shodan5000,2010-02-26T06:18Z,Eat a dick euphorial.  The two comments you're talking about both showed their appreciation and just were just pointing something missing out.  Just saying.

,D3Studios,2010-03-13T23:26Z,"Nice upload, missing quite a few songs to include hidden tracks. Nice work though."
,sikkilla,2010-03-15T06:27Z,Thanx for the upload!! Great stuff!! Tool rocks
,Filmaddict41,2010-04-04T03:01Z,Anyone know Tool Discography with all full albums including Salival. That has 320 kbps Bitrate?
,dj_klyde,2010-05-19T01:49Z,"without Salival, the uploader is just a douche bag"
,killgroup,2010-05-22T20:36Z,"Awesome band, and one of the few bands that I actually bought all the CDs to, they're a band that actually deserve your money for once, instead of that mainstream pop trash. "
,pesmaniac,2010-05-24T08:23Z,"Can anyone plz tell me what the bit-rate of these songs are???

Thanks for the upload"
,noquarter333,2010-06-19T07:14Z,Hey its noquarter333 i just uploaded tool discography with a string tribute to /-enima. and it has salival too
,gunbike,2010-12-22T14:56Z,Great UL even if it's not the whole discography! Why complain if it's free?

,djdtm420,2011-04-13T22:41Z,I come from the one song at a time p2p file sharing era. Am farely new to the whole torrent thing. But I must say to those whining about a torrent missing an album?. . . Fuck you. Get over yourself you spoiled piece of shit. . . 
,GBSB,2011-06-17T19:02Z,"eh, if you label as 'Tool discography' you should probably include all their released albums.  I am not complaining since I have the Salival box set but you have definitely mis-labeled an otherwise awesome compilation."
,Lead_Eye,2011-08-04T20:59Z,Always include bit rate.
,luvtpb123,2011-08-14T20:07Z,"@djdtm420
AMEN MY FRIEND !!!!

btw- I do wish uploader wrote a bit more details of bitrate and what albums included..then would help out all these stupid comments.."
,eatmecaptain765,2011-09-23T02:22Z,"Check out this band's debut EP.  Finally a new band bringing back ROCK!

,nameless.twisted,2012-03-16T17:55Z,"I'm downloading this only because I don't have Opiate yet.
The new magnet thing won't let me select which files to download [it usually let me when you could download the torrent file]
Anyone know how to get it to let me do it?

Thanks for uploading |m|"
