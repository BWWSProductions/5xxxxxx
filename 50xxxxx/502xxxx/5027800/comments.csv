,FilmDork,2009-09-06T14:03Z,"Comments for Red Cliff 1:

Audio - 8
Video - 9.5

Overall, this rip is very good...the only problem with the video was that in one or two brief moments, there was some pixelation.

As for the audio, it was generally very good as well, except that quite frequently when the noise level was high (for instance, during the battle scenes), there was a constant loud popping/crackling noise. When the noise level wasn't quite so loud, the sound was very good.

The one other problem I had was that the subtitles went by way too fast. Generally I have no problem reading subtitles, but this movie, the subtitles came and went faster than normal. That's not something I think can be blamed on the ripper, it's just that the spoken dialog comes very fast. Also, the subtitles could've been a bit bigger.

As for Vikins question: Yes, the subtitles are hardcoded.

Aside from those few quibbles, Red Cliff 1 is defianately a very good quality rip that I would recommend.

Thank you Blue Lady for the great download! Once I watch Part 2, I'll write again with my comments. 

BTW, I just checked, the download on this page is definately Part 1. For those looking for Part 2, please go here:
