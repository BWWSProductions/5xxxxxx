IMPORTANT NOTES- AV Scanning results of SysMech.8.x_Patch.3.1.exe:
******************************************************************

1- Norton Internet Security: Clean. 
2- Avast Anti-Virus: Clean.
3- NOD32 Anti-Virus: Clean.

4- AVG Anti-Virus: Detected in SysMech.8.x_Patch.3.1.exe: 
   - Category: Virus
   - Name: Win32/Themida

5- Kaspersky Anti-Virus: Detected in SysMech.8.x_Patch.3.1.exe: 
   - Category: Trojan
   - Name: Packed.Win32.Black.a


The scan result of AVG Anti-Virus and Kaspersky Anti-Virus are false positives!
So just stay cool or don't use this!!!


... Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by 
    other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!





> Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this! <



So feel free to report more infections, especially from stupid programs like SuperAntiSpyware."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-07-30T21:35Z,"BTW: I've tested this myself and there's nothing wrong with the patch. 

People need to learn what false positives are, otherwise they're just fucking up things for others. *SIGH*"

[V],RobbingHood,2009-07-31T21:22Z,"@1JEM1 

Fact-1- If you never heard of this program before then that's your problem.
Fact-2- Despite all your bla bla till now you never mentioned your av scanner and the name of the so called infection(s). Afraid to fail?
Fact-3- As you may have read Ă­t was not only scanned with AVG.
Fact-4: I'm used to handle little dickeads and trolls like you who are never to the point. 

Have a nice life, Mr. Troll."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-01T16:10Z,"@BROKEN1981

With the activators (patch) you don't need to activate System Mechanic online. That's why cracks etc are for. Just read the install notes in the Readme.txt file."

[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-06T12:13Z,"@hockeyboii91 

It's you who forgot to do your homework. Probably the patch is removed by your av virus scanner. Read the Readme.txt file about how to deal with that."

,Temptation,2009-08-12T00:35Z,"help!  I applied the patch like you said and it seemed to work.. but something is seriously fucked up because each time I try to run some operation, the application runs and then just closes and exits by itself!  What's going on?  Can someone please help."
,Temptation,2009-08-12T04:51Z,"yeah, something is definitely fucked up with this version.  It keeps crashing.  "
[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-12T09:44Z,"@Temptation

Most likely it's just your pc which is fucked up."
,Temptation,2009-08-12T15:54Z,"RobbingHood,

I guess that is possible.. but I assure you, I'm not a noob.  My PC is a relatively new build, and is relatively clutter-free and clean.  It's an older PC - Pentium 4 Celeron 2.66 GHz, 1.00 GB of RAM - but surely that's good enough to run this application.  

The program just crashes very regularly.. sometimes after an operation is completed, eg, analyzing the system, or sometimes just from navigating from one program window to another.  The application just exits and Windows creates a crash log, which is how I know it crashed.

If anyone else experiences this problem, please comment."
,Temptation,2009-08-12T15:56Z,"And btw, I'm running Windows XP, SP3.  "
,sivre009,2009-08-13T17:31Z,"Cant install it because it forces you to connect to internet before installing, when you disconnect the internet you cant install it, when you conect it checks and says you can't install it...

WTF! This is CRAP! I guess the company is good at preventing crackers...

Good job for them...

Fail to you... waste of time for this..."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-13T19:36Z,"@sivre009 

Don't assume that your problem is others their problem too. If you can't install this version it might be because of an earlier crack you've used for SysMech.

I can't install the normal version of SysMech because of the following:
""You cannot install a trial version of System Mechanic over the top of an older licensed version of System Mechanic"".
""Error: Runtime Error (at 525:1315): Could not call proc.""

The problem is being sorted out. Next time when posting remember that your problem is not always the same as others their problem."
,sivre009,2009-08-16T15:45Z,"Ok sorry for freaking out, hope this would be fix soon^^

by the way i never used any earlier crack, because i never have installed it..."

Torrent is clean. Upgrade your knowledge about false positives, upgrade your av scanners, and read the scan results at the torrents description. Also use Sandboxie totest cracks. This all should prevent you from looking stupid."

No need for sorry. Actually I'm the one who feels sorry twice for you:

1- For just trusting the result of one av scanner.
2- For not learning anything from av scan results and about false positives.


Here once more the av scan result as mentioned in the torrent description:
IMPORTANT NOTES- AV Scanning results of SysMech.8.x_Patch.3.1.exe:

1- Norton Internet Security: Clean. 
2- Avast Anti-Virus: Clean.
3- NOD32 Anti-Virus: Clean.

5- Kaspersky Anti-Virus: Detected in SysMech.8.x_Patch.3.1.exe: 
   - Category: Trojan
   - Name: Packed.Win32.Black.a


The scan result of AVG Anti-Virus and Kaspersky Anti-Virus are false positives!
So just stay cool or don't use this!!!


... Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by 
    other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!


If you wanna get scared some more the read the av scan results of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4881078/Adobe_CS4_All_Products_Keymaker_v1.02_Only_[CORE]_[RH]


So if you wanna miss it all for free: keep believing each av scan result and don't learn about false positives."
,spen007,2009-08-23T22:29Z,Thanks for some of the very best here at PB. May PB R.I.P. 
,andicro,2009-08-24T01:45Z,"Thanx RH for try to cool me, I give it a try.
Im just not understand whitch one is false positive and whitch is not!
Half of AV scanners says clean and half of them it is virus!
So for persone with avrege knowlage of PC is quite confusing to decide whitch one to thrust.
Thanx for you response,respect!!!"
,andicro,2009-08-24T03:25Z,"Me again...
I follow the instructions, instal and patch properly ( I think) but when I try to run Sys.Meh.it says:
Unable to connect and validate...Sis.Meh.must periodically validate its subscription info.by communicating with iolo.com over the internet.
Problem:firewall or internet security product blocked Sys.Meh from communicating with iolo.com to perform validation!

And I asume that if I unblock the Sys.Meh. it will detect ilegall  registration!
Any idea?"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-27T22:37Z,"@andicro 

The problem you've described can only happen before installing SysMech. In that case SysMech cannot be installed at all because a previous crack was used. (See my previous posts.)
If SysMech is installed and patched correctlty they message won't appear.
And indeed: don't let SysMech connect to the homeserver. That and more is described in the Readme.txt."

""...\SysMech.8.x_Patch.3.1.exe - probably a variant of Win32/Obfuscated trojan""

Still, when NOD says ""probably"" it means it's a heuristic hit, so it's behavior based. Considering the fact that the file hasn't been changed in two months, it's doubtful that it would not trigger a definitions hit, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

Still, full disclosure and all that..."
