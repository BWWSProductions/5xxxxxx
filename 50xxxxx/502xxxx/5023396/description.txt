Ok, here it goes.

I am kind of a noob when it comes to uploading torrents, but I have had a lot of
experience with torrents themselves, including what works, and what doesn't. I can tell you right now that this one works. I have pieced together files from several different torrents to create a Winamp + DFX torrent that works.

I have went through many torrents that didn't work. So I put together a combination of files that do work.

Enjoy it, instructions are in the torrent.
