Nietzsche regarded â€˜Thus Spoke Zarathustraâ€™ as his most important work, and his story of the wandering Zarathustra has had enormous influence on subsequent culture. Nietzsche uses a mixture of homilies, parables, epigrams and dreams to introduce some of his most striking doctrines, including the Overman, nihilism, and the eternal return of the same. This edition offers a new translation by Adrian Del Caro which restores the original versification of Nietzscheâ€™s text and captures its poetic brilliance. Robert Pippinâ€™s introduction discusses many of the most important interpretative issues raised by the work, including who is Zarathustra and what kind of â€˜heroâ€™ is he and what is the philosophical significance of the workâ€™s literary form? The volume will appeal to all readers interested in one of the most original and inventive works of modern philosophy.
