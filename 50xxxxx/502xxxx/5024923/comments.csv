,asuri13,2009-08-16T19:35Z,"thanks, nice itunes replacement"
,Spironic,2009-09-12T01:30Z,"Is this program compatible with iTunes 9?  I have a 1st gen iPod touch fw 3.0 (NOT the latest 3.1.1) and iTunes 9, and it says ""unconnected ipod touch found"", and it asks me to make sure I have iTunes 7.3 or higher installed.

I also get an ""encountered a problem and needs to close"" window at launch, but I can still operate the program if I move that window out of the way."
,killme777,2009-09-27T19:24Z,I read that it doesn't support firmware 3.1.1 and iTunes 9. Download the program CopyTrans as it does work with the latest firmware and latest iTunes.
,yunais,2009-10-24T13:05Z,does not support FW 3.0
,Lordsbassman,2009-11-15T11:05Z,Works great! and I just updated it now supports 3.1.1
,Mrpushpin,2009-12-23T07:51Z,"Thank you very much.

,soto619,2010-01-05T21:13Z,"it work. I updated first. then install the whole program again after the update, then I paste the crack folder in the xilisoft directory from there i open the crack folder and install the bad boy then i lauch the program and work fine! hope i help."

,nass2001,2010-02-17T19:22Z,thnx for the up! worked great! Just do what the instructions say and then update and works with the newest iphone version 3.1.3
,hdk94,2010-05-30T14:55Z,"This didn't work for me (on Windows 7 32-bit), so what i did was:

Download newest set-up file from the Xilisoft site. Install. Run the crack. It works fine, and you now have the updated version"
,themadtexan,2010-08-18T05:10Z,where am i pasting the crack too? And what's the crack? Please help I am so confused!

All I did was, run The Setup, copy crack to ""Program files, Xilisoft, iPod Rip"" (Default) 
Then Ran The Crack which worked perfectly, Turning the program from unregistered to Registered, Updated it, Now it's working with iTunes 10, with my iPod touch 4G! Copied 2155 Songs EASILY :D Thanks Alot :)"
