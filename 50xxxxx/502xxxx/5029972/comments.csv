,caliwillbemine,2009-07-31T02:20Z,that sounds like a cool movie. too bad the size (2.1GB) makes me wonder about the quality.
,hawke,2009-07-31T19:54Z,hi! If I have to burn a bluray film will then burn the movie on a bluray disc or a regular DVD disc? and one must have a region free bluray player?
,SonGoku7,2010-01-21T06:20Z,you know even though i download movies in bluray i convert them with Any Video Converter then i burn them to disc the quality does not get wose it stays the same great quality

If you're comparing it to a normal movie, then you don't know that animated video quality scale is different.  Especially, the direct to video / non-big budget releases."
