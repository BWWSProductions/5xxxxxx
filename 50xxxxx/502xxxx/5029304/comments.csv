,ry4ntr0n,2009-11-08T08:06Z,Thanks so much!
,cherrysbaby2000,2010-05-10T07:44Z,"""hrchy""  Your right its a TORRENT file. You need to download with a torrent program (Bittorrent, Vuze, to name a couple) Your not downloading a video, movie, software, from this site.
You should seriously have read the information before looking for anything on here"

,6daniels,2011-07-15T08:36Z,Thanks! Quality is alright.
