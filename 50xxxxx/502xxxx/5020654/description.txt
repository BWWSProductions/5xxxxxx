ZPG is a full-length science fiction film that was released in 1972, in the wake of Paul R. Ehrlich's best-selling book The Population Bomb. The movie concerns an overpopulated, very polluted future Earth, whose world government executes those who violate a 30-year ban on procreation. "Z.P.G." stands for "Zero population growth".

The movie stars Oliver Reed, Geraldine Chaplin, and Diane Cilento. It was directed by Michael Campus.
