Somewhere in the Stockholm, Sweden area, the band got together in mid-November 2005 and quickly wrote some music. 

After a couple of weeks the band found a singer and that was it.

The demo â€œMaximum Grooveâ€ was released in March 2006.

After a hectic spring the band has just released their second demo called â€œWe shall triumphâ€. This time properly recorded at Studio Ljudion i Stockholm. 

During the fall the band started to write some more material but also managade to record a third demo with two songs that didnâ€™t for some reasons make it to the We shall triumph demo.

â€œHighfueled leftoversâ€ containing Freezing cold and Careless whisper was released in Nov 2006. 

In april 2007 we released our 4th demo Heavy rock which contains 6 Ponamero Sundown sounding songs.

All music is availiblehere on Last.fm under the album title: â€œHeavy rock filled with maximum grooveâ€.
During the fall of 2008 we recorded several songs with will hopefully in some way be released asap. Read summer/early fall of 2009.

And already the band is working on new songs, making more babies and are working the stagesâ€¦

The bands debut album Stonerized will be released through Transubstans Records who also have released records from bands like Abramis Brahma, Graveyard, Siena Rot, Blowback among others.
