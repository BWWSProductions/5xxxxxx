Once she was a computer professional, now she's on the run. Wanted by the police for a murder she didn't commit, wanted by government agents for a data disc she doesn't have. Jane Doe didn't start this game of cat-and-mouse, but just watch her finish it.


This action-packed thriller stars Desperate Housewives' Teri Hatcher together with Rob Lowe

Jane Doe is the real name of arms manufacturer Cy-Kor's recently fired security password employee with top clearance, whose teenage son Michael is kidnapped. She obeys the bizarre instructions, including getting and learning to use a gun and downloading a secret file (after which her work post starts totally deleting), dumping both in a dumpster and waiting nearby, only to witness the company's CEO Churnings being shot by a sniper using an identical weapon. Michael is released, but the pair is now wanted for the murder and both are abducted by armed men, who bring them to a ranch. There they are welcomed by Michael's father, David Doe, who discloses to be an agent of the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), and so is Michael, who used her clearance as the whole thing is a sting for the kidnapping and murder's brain, Avery, so he will sell the enemy false data. Alas David's DIA-partner Kurt Simmons and their boss Phelps have a dirty agenda
