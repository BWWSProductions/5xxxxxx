When it comes to matters of the heart, keeping her man happy and committed is all in a day's work for ShantÃ© Smith. ShantÃ© is so adept at navigating the waters of romance that her best girlfriends Diedre, Karen and Tracye depend on her for advice whenever "man trouble" clouds the horizon. But when ShantÃ©'s boyfriend Keith is caught red-handed stepping out with a co-worker, ShantÃ© institutes her "Ten Day Plan" to get her man in line. Whether its sexy lingerie or good home cooking, ShantÃ© has an arsenal of weapons designed to bring a man to his knees...and back to her. She's not above playing the damsel in distress or using the ever-reliable local grapevine to get Keith's attention. It's all good, because getting her man back - by any means necessary - is all that matters. Unfortunately the happy ending that ShantÃ© expects goes sideways when Keith begins following the advice of his buddy Tony, who brings a player's perspective to the games girls play. In this comedic battle of the sexes, Shante's about to discover that not only are there no rules - she's not the only one playing. With her relationship at stake and her friends checking her every move, ShantÃ© has to think fast and stay a step ahead of Keith if she has any hope of bringing her man back...with her pride intact
