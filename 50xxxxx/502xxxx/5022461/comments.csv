,mugglensu,2009-07-31T05:32Z,damned fucked up spammers
,tigerigs,2009-07-31T09:46Z,"Anything uploaded by extremezone recently marked as a BR-SCREENER has been fake. Its always a VERY bad CAM copy instead of a BLUE RAY rip, sometimes the spoken language is not incorrect. 

Look out for the uploader extremezone and dont bother downloading from his/her torrents again.

I have not downloaded this copy and neither should you."
,creste,2009-08-04T23:46Z,Why is this fucker a VIP if his stuff is shit?
,could_do_better,2009-08-08T02:31Z,"Extremezone didn't make a mistake - had you been watching the message boards on his posts before they were deleted, you'd have seen that he (or she) believed they were labelled correctly, and that BR-Screener meant something other than the obvious Blu Ray Screener and that we were wrong for chastising him. 
Other purists will say that the abbreviation for Blu Ray torrents is BD - Bluray Disc, and so we shouldn't be annoyed at the use of BR for somethioing other than Blu Ray, but surely we all agree that a Screener is a pre-release copy of a title, sent to critics, papers etc for critical evaluation. This is NOT that - it's a cam rip, and if BR indicates Brazilian (?) language in his/her eyes, this is still NOT a screener.

Beware people, the green skull still requires scrutiny. 
Mrpio (green skull) recently upped a dvdrip of Moon(2009) that was blatantly fake, which he defended against nay-sayers, but was subsequently deleted. No Sanctions seem to be taken against these violators.

ALWAYS read the comments before downloading, people - TPB is trying to go corporate. The Pirate Code is dead on TPB.

Other green skulls are quick to defend their brethren, saying that, since it's free, we have no right to complain. However, for anone still hampered by a bandwidth limit, every movie they download costs them money, and perhaps prevents them from downloading a better copy later.

This movie now has genuine R5 dvdrips up - my recommendation would be Noir's, for best audio sync - so don't wase your time, bandwidth and ratio with this garbage. 

And sanctions for repeat offenders please. After this was initially deleted, presumably due to complaints from downloaders, Extremezone casually re-upped it, as if we were all wrong, and he/she knew better. 

Trusted/VIP status for TRUSTWORTHY uploaders please. Mistakes are fine, we all make them, but blatant disregard for your peers and their advice and opinions does not a VIP make, in my opinion.

Extremezone - Fuck you, you spunk-munching bumblefuck.

Peas."
