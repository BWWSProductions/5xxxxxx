A team of maverick geologists hunt for clues to prove Bretz's theory to be true. Scattered across the terrain, they find one-hundred tonne granite boulders, giant potholes, 40-foot ripples carved into the landscape and scratch marks gouged into the bedrock. "In geology we are really looking for evidence of features in the rocks, on the landscape. It is very similar to what a detective does looking for clues at a crime scene. Those clues fit into a pattern and ultimately a culprit is associated with that crime scene," explains Geosciences Professor Vic Baker, from the University of Arizona.
