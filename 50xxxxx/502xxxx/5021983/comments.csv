Can you prove it or are you just jerking me around?"
,JetEngineCom,2009-08-03T09:12Z,"Doesn't work - gives message ""Close NetTransport And Try Again"" even when NetTransport is not running. I have tried putting in the full path to the exe file - but nothing"
,JetEngineCom,2009-08-03T09:14Z,"Justus - the patch is the one giving the error message, so what is wrong and how do i correct the problem?"
,JetEngineCom,2009-08-03T11:11Z,"Okay finally got the patch working but here is what i had to do - first i installed nettransport, then i copied nettransport.exe and put it to a custom directory, then i uninstalled nettransport such that when i ran the patch, it did not see the executable and had to ask for location, i gave it the custom location and that nettransport.exe was patched and registered, then i reinstalled nettransport, then cut and pasted the patched nettransport.exe from the custom location to the program files location and voila ..."

If even after showing the program the way to the patch it says Close NetTransport and try again then the file is returning ""Access is Denied"".
If you have Vista then run the patch as administrator.
If you have XP or running as administrator doesn't work send me a pm on SuprBay :

I'd love to troubleshoot this with you"
