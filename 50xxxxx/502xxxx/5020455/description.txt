Late Night with Jimmy Fallon - June 10, 2009

Target Demographic: the balds
Cellphone Shootout

Guests: (on this all-white-boy edition of Jimmy Fallon) the surprisingly funny and lively comic actor John Krasinski from TV's The Office (US) and starring in the movie Away We Go, the English actor Stephen Moyer from True Blood (trivia fact: vampire teeth don't grow by pushing hard), a demo of Microsoft's Project Natal which is a XBox 360 control system that includes no controller (red jumpsuit optional), and alternative rock band Manchester Orchestra who performs a piece from their album Mean Everything To Nothing

Note
The Sam Mendes feature film Away We Go starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph includes very pleasant music by various artists but mostly from indie/folk singer-songwriter Alexi Murdoch; for more info see the OST torrent:
