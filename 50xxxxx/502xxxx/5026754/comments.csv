,josher212,2009-08-25T19:20Z,"ye soz about b 4 my bad :-P
nice dwnload but i couldnt get the xbox upgrade feature included to work 
could that be becuase i didnt use the xp pro instalation inlcluded"
,josher212,2009-08-25T19:23Z,"also in system information it says it is version 2002 is that how it is suposed to be?
i know that media centre(the actual program) is 2005 its just the os"
[T],xxThugxx,2009-08-28T11:01Z,"system info will always say 2002 because mce runs off xp pro 2002, to find the actual version of mce your using just check the software version in media centre, the mce upgrade & xbox feature shoud work, on any version of xp pro, did you reboot inbetween each step? just try again :)"
,crook16 ,2009-09-22T08:08Z,"shit its an upgrade i thought they distributed it as a stand alone (an upgraded version of xp) 

but i get it 

if you already have xp then you skip to step 3...right?"
,josher212,2009-09-29T20:34Z,"ye in reply to crook16

,josher212,2009-09-29T20:41Z,could it be that my os isnt booting to my c drive?

THUG is the right name!!!! "
,Hamulus,2011-03-17T03:37Z,"@jj423
Noob much? You do know when you install an OS that the drivers need to be installed seperately? Windows doesn't have (has never had) drivers for every piece of hardware. You need to find your motherboard model and manufacturer, go to the manufacturer's website and download the ""missing"" drivers there. Then come back and apologize to Thug and thank him for what is actually an awesome upload after all."
,DrunkenFossile,2012-04-17T01:59Z,can someone please seed i know this version of media center definately works thanks very much
,DrunkenFossile,2012-04-17T04:45Z,can some one please seed stuck at 82.8 per cent need this quick as possible
,steve-blow,2012-06-08T01:06Z,"Hi thug + Thnx for the upload. I never used torrents before, but am OK at installing XP etc...
I got a ""legit"" MCE 2005 SP3 installation on this PC and need an OEM disc to try a repair, and/or a fresh install if that is neccessary...
Will this ISO install in the usual MS way, or do i need to try another torrent for that.
Many Thnx - steve-blow"
