,Artaudian,2009-07-27T16:29Z,subtitles for English?
,Artaudian,2009-07-27T16:33Z,Anglaise sil vous plais.
,Dethes,2009-07-27T16:50Z,Guess weÂ´ll have to find subtitels. I need to figure out how to make my PS3 understand that it should use the sub titel file. That's why I'm always hesitating downloading non english movies without burned in subtitels. 
[T],Atilla82,2009-07-28T00:49Z,I couldn't find the subtitles too.  If you did post the link here.
,Dethes,2009-07-28T23:35Z,Cant find any sub anywhere. Damn I really want to see thisone =(
