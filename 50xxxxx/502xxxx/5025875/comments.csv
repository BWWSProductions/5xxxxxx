,MrCyberdude,2010-05-11T07:21Z,"Monkey aka Monkey Magic - English version of Japanese version of 16th Century Chinese novel called ""Journey to the West""

This series was shown in Australia back in the 80's and has a cult following. The quality is better than I remember watching back then. It is in English and there are no subtitles (better than vcd quality)

Great Upload Baodrin"

I don't remember it being so violent and kinda rude in some bits too (in a good way)

words cant express my gratitude(ty to all seeders keeping this treasure alive too)  "

,LG_,2012-01-13T09:27Z,"Many Thanks Baodrin!  Memory Lane is getting a thrashing at the moment.

My kids are having difficulty understanding what is being said (due to accents). Does anyone know if there is subtitles available anywhere?"

,Purakushi,2012-04-29T17:37Z,"This is a seriously poor rip straight from dvd as mentioned. There are better versions and  ""so called rips"" of this show... This is poor quality size at

384 x 288 to say its a dvd rip.

Yes its in english but i have copies of this also in english at a quality size of

592 x 480 which I found on another torrent."
