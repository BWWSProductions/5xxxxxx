The final Nintendo DS Cave Story was canceled due to negotiations with Nintendo for the WiiWare version.  However this demo was released and shows most of the levels.  There isn't any guns or HP bar or anything.  You can basically just walk around and explore and have the monsters chase after you.

You will need an R4 or M3 or some other NDS rom cart to play with this.

It's too bad the author didn't finish it.  It doesn't look like it would take that much more time to complete.
