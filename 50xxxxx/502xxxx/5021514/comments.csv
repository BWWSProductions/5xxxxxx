Do not watch this using a Widescreen monitor, that's 24"" or above, my 42"" monitor made it look like it had been going through 3 passes of Film Graining, but on my 21.4"" it was awesome.
Suggestively; watch this far away from the monitor(If you've got a wide one), or on a normal 4:3 monitor.

In summary; great movie, great audio, great vid, definitely worth downloading."
