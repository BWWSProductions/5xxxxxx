,DePo316,2009-07-29T12:03Z,"there are 5 in total, giving backgrounds on the other immortal weapons, as to where they fit in, they are origin tales, so it's anyone's guess"
,IronBars,2009-07-29T17:23Z,Thanks alot for the effort. Its appreciated....
,DePo316,2009-07-30T00:37Z,"sorry everyone for the slow upload speed, I've got a shitty connection so you can guess just how long it took me to get all this together. IF anyone is interested I also have up to date collections of Looking For Group, Least I Could Do, Order of the Stick and Questionable content as well as the naruto manga from kakashi gaiden to current, Exiles up to current, Incredible Hercules, Amazing Spider-Man from 506 to current, New Avengers, Avengers The Initiative, and a few others so if anyone expresses interest I will upload once I see a few more Iron Fist seeders"
