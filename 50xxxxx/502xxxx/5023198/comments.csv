,lareth,2009-07-27T21:05Z,"And no sound on Grim, only in the intro, but in the actual game it's dead silent."
,TheFreezerBox,2009-07-28T21:38Z,"Speech (aka ""Talkies"") wasn't introduced to LucasArts Adventures until ""Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis"" (1992)... Even then you had to wait for the 1993 CD-ROM re-release which had added a full voice soundtrack."
,lareth,2009-08-04T08:00Z,"Yeh, jsut realized that myself, for soem reason I remembered Monkey Island 2 having speech.. But Grim I had to download elsewhere to make it work. Try playing it in WIn 95 mode, might help."
,TheFreezerBox,2009-08-06T19:58Z,"Re: Grim Fandango (and Monkey Island 4, also)... that's why I wrote above that one's mileage may vary depending on the type of hardware/OS you run it on since they are NOT being run through any type of emulator like the SCUMM games are required to (either thru DOSBox or ScummVM, etc.). I too have experienced it working on one machine but not another and it does seem to work better if you play around with the compatibility-modes a little. The third-party launchers also go a long way towards making them a little more Windows(XP/Vista)-friendly."

,TheFreezerBox,2009-12-17T21:28Z,ScummVM v1.0.0 is now available! Get it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5217974 to easily update ScummVM to the current one and still keep all your settings.

What have I forgotten to do?"
