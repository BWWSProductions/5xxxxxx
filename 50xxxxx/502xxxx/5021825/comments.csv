,untrueparadox,2009-09-13T03:51Z,"if you get that error, cannot be installed, please realize that you can only install it on the iPhone 3G or iPhone 3G S. the original iPhone, aka, iPhone 2G or EDGE, does not have built in GPS functionality."

Your method worked for me, thanks."
,sheikh2,2009-11-15T19:14Z,can this be used on a 3.1.2 and jail broken with blackra1n
,untrueparadox,2009-12-14T04:11Z,yes. any jailbreak 3.0 or above will do.
,nukem419,2010-01-03T07:44Z,"this is a huge, massive app. don't be alarmed if it takes you forever too sync once you drop it in Itunes. 
it seems a bit light on functions; no over head sat images, built in compass ect but it locks up on a gps signal fairly fast, auto reroutes and shows the location of gas stations, starbucks ect. also it has a night mode which is very handy; the default map in the iphone can be blinding at night. 
you do not need to unlock your iphone to install cracked apps. you need too jailbreak it. You are more than likely stuck in a 2 year contract anyway so there is no reason for you too unlock for other carriers.  If you have not jailbroken your phone yet make sure it's fully patched up with apple before doing so too 3.1.2 then follow the instructions in this forum."
