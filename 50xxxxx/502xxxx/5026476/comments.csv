,acer99,2009-07-31T02:39Z,"In the tradition of Grindhouse, Kill Bill and Sin City, award winning comic book writer Ed Brubaker (Incognito, The Death of Captain America, Daredevil) teams up with stuntwoman - turned cult star ZoĂŤ Bell (Death Proof, Lost) to deliver a stark, stylish pulp thriller about a very bad girl gone ""good.""

Eve (Bell) is a sexy assassin who kills without remorse - until one botched hit changes everything. Caught off guard, Eve is stabbed in the head and inadvertently murders a young girl. The blade is removed, but the damage is done: Eve's mind is now filled with visions of past victims. The hunter becomes the haunted and this killing machine is plagued with remorse. Unable to ""work,"" this mob asset has become a liability. Eve's only chance to survive is to track down her ruthless bosses before their new hitman finds her.

Originally webcast on Crackle.com, Angel of Death co-stars Lucy Lawless (Xena, Princess Warrior, Bedtime Stories, Battlestar Galactica), Doug Jones (Quarantine) and Ted Raimi (Spider Man 3   ;~) Thanks Very Much..."
