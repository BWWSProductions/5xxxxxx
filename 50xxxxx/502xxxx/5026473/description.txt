Stop Smoking (Brain Sync audios) by Kelly Howell
Publisher: Brain Sync | January 1, 2003 | ISBN: 1881451879 | Audio CD 

No matter how many times you've tried to quit, you can do it now! And this time you'll succeed. Precision-engineered brain wave frequencies induce a state of hyper-receptivity where subliminal messages get down to the very root of self-sabotage. Specially designed trigger phrases curb cravings, bolster resolve, and re-build a new sense of self that is healthy, vibrant and free from the grip of nicotine addiction.
