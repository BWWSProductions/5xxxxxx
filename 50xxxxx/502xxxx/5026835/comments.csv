It would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!"

The quality is quite acceptable, both visual and audio.

Worth a try for all Beethoven fans!"

thank you for the torrent, the videos have excellent quality.
Utorrent user seeding for the world, lo unico malo es que no he encontrado subtitulos en espaĂąol, pero igual se puede entender algo."

Pretty damn good films. But alas- its time to move on.
Seed this people. Before it disappears 4ever!!  Sadly, almost every1 has hit&run."
