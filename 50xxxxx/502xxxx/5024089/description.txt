This is the third of a set of rainbowtables generated by the freerainbowtables.com project, compressed with the PAQ9A algorithm to allow for more efficient distribution. The overall size of the tables can be reduced by about 12 % when compared to the uncompressed ones. Tools to decompress the tables are included for Windows and Linux, as well as the source code.
