In the tradition of Grindhouse, Kill Bill and Sin City, award winning comic book writer Ed Brubaker (Incognito, The Death of Captain America, Daredevil) teams up with stuntwoman - turned cult star Zoey Bell (Death Proof, Lost) to deliver a stark, stylish pulp thriller about a very bad girl gone "good." Eve (Bell) is a sexy assassin who kills without remorse - until one botched hit changes everything.
