@zackslater

I thought of that too, but Jake's too dumb to go to college, they show that in all the episodes.
If he did go, it sure as hell wouldn't be realistic."

,scottsasse,2011-09-27T04:13Z,"@ urial, not a Trojan, or virus. It is likely due to your codec or old computer. I had problems with  ILPruny's uploads of small file Californication and Two & Half Men. Computer often claimed ""corrupt audio file"" and when I put them on a memory stick I had a hell of a time trying to delete them, but they worked and were of great quality even on my widescreen TV. Very sad to see Sheen leave the show, the network really fucked up on that decision:(  And WTF were they thinking only doing 19 episodes when the previous seasons all had 24??? CBS can eat my asshole!! ....................................and THANKS for the up killerdemon!! Lotta Love, DrScott"

[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-06T17:05Z,"Now this issue has been covered already and since the item is still here and since I have downloaded it and checked it there is no viruses with this at all. So no more about viruses when its been checked!

@urial - Do not stir the pot of conspiracy. 

Now lets get back to what should be. 

A = 10
V = 10"
