,mahesh19882008,2009-07-26T05:27Z,"and dude!!!!!
Did u think of any other torrent site to upload u r amazing torrents as TPB may become a pay site. If so, plzzz let everyone know it."
[T],brickop,2009-07-26T08:06Z,"As for the bars they stay i dont resize any of my films they are meant to reflect the same look you would get from the disc (aspect ratio)
I do upload my torrents to Demonoid and ExtraTorrent."
,waddish,2009-07-26T17:12Z,"mahesh19882008 stop f***ing complaining about the black bars. I'm sure Bricktop is sick of people like you who have probably only just found his torrent uploads and then complain ""oh can you do this, can you do that""... erm no! If you read comments on his previous uploads you will notice this has been discussed time and time again. If your not happy with Bricktop's uploads 'don't download'.

You are probably among the people who download from Bricktop, moan a little and then don't even seed afterwards. I have seeded at least 10 of Bricktop's uploads for 4 weeks @ 1000k upload ratio 2.00. In future read comments of previous uploads before complaining about black bars or anything else for that matter!

Bricktop keep up the good work m8 :)"
,mahesh19882008,2009-07-27T04:16Z,"I'm sorry, I'm a newie and i have not checked the comments on previous torrents.
as for the demonoid, if anyone can send me an invitation code plz do one to mahesh19882008@gmail.com.
and also WADDISH, i do seed. Don't babble what u want. There r many seeders around the world not only u."
,waddish,2009-07-27T12:54Z,"mahesh19882008 don't fucking capitalise my name  after admitting your a 'newie' it makes you sound so small. Don't babble what you want? eh? that's not even english. When and please 'quote' where in my post did I say I am the only seeder in the world? Like I said read some previous comments on previous torrents before requesting nonsense!

'newie'... now thats funny :)"
,jpbonadio,2009-07-29T00:28Z,Thanks brickop.
