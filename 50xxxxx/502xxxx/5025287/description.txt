http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499487/

From the producers of GOAL and GOAL 2 comes the latest installment in the fast-paced, action packed trilogy.

With the actual World Cup as its dramatic backdrop, this is the story of two players, Liam Adams (J.J Fields) and his best friend and Real Madrid teammate Charlie Braithwaite (Leo Gregory).

Their journey playing for home country England takes them to the center of the greatest stage on Earth and is filled with humor, romance, tragedy and redemption.

Liam's world is turned upside down by a chance reunion just as he's set to enjoy the pinnacle of his professional career.

This is also a 'coming of age' story for young Liam who finally faces up to his responsibilities on and off the field of play. [D-Man2010]
