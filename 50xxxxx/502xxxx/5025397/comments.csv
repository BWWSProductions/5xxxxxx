@""azarela"" - U suck!"
,[NTT],2009-08-28T01:54Z,"Man.  I was so excited when I saw this link.  I own a copy of Stanley Burroughs' revolutionary book & have done the cleanse a few times (28 days the last time).  So, to turn a negative into a positive, I found Stanley's book as a file in this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4497674/TalmudTimmy_Book_Pack_09-11-08 .

The Master Cleanse is better for you than a trip to the doctor.  Do it before 'swine season' sets in.
Peace!"
