I love PT, and I swear this has better audio and video than my ORIGINAL copy of Arriving Somewhere....dts.
Easy three click burn with Nero Essentials, and totally flawless.
I will seed this forever, you have my word.
Thank you SO much, yoncenator!"

Isn't this the 'special edition' of FoaBP, not the DVD-A? Because DVDDecrypter can't find the .mlp (lossless 5.1/24bit) files. All this contains is LPCM Stereo and 5.1 DTS (lossy), oh and ACC for Nil Recurring along with DTS.

I hope i'm wrong, and am just over tired."
