First of all, did you get all the bios:es needed for the emulator? if not, search and download them.

Under the meny called FILE, use RUN CD/DVD and point it to the file you have downloaded, or if you have burnt it, tell pcsx2 to run the dvd. 

If that doesnt help, there are great step-by-step instructions at the official forums for the emulator. (and oh, make sure you check the compability for the game and emulator (on their website))"
