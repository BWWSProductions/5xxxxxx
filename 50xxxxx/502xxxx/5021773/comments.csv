,zen-TAO,2009-07-26T06:42Z,"Thanks - but no thanks...

When a ""new"" cut arrives,
it use to be someting more to it.
But this one is in fact 7 minutes less
than the original episode.

Thanks for the UL anyway.

Peace and Love!"

But I gave it a chance, and it was totally worth it.  Why?  Music.  This has the actual soundtrack composed for the episode (and the series).  The original version was forced by Metro to use the movie soundtrack instead.  Maybe you're thinking that makes much of a difference.  But I'm saying: it does.  Night to day."

,Metron,2009-07-27T08:30Z,"Second ""review"" after finishing it :-)

What I said about the music.  It's better, it's smoother, it's in the right moods at the right times.  If you watched the original version recently (which I have), you'll notice the difference again and again throughout.

Some of my favourite dialogue is gone :-( I understand some people hate the reproductive organs line, but I see no sensible reason to remove the McGuyver reference.

Chu'lak looks A LOT cooler, more real, and more engaging.

Possibly the most important improvement is Teal'c, his character is more developed, more real, less wtf; you can really see what's going on in his head throughout.  I read Judge also re-dubbed his whole performance, which I confess I didn't actually notice while watching, but it may have been part of my general opinion about the improvement of Teal'c in general."
,zen-TAO,2009-07-28T07:16Z,"Sorry for being a jerk...
I had a bad day.
 Of course I will give it a chance!
Sorry for open my mouth without
thinking...

I am a fan - so its a must see.

,WillKatt,2009-08-04T13:26Z,Can anybody share the actual DVD please?
