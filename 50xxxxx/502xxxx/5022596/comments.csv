Or is a Panzer with nipples ?"
,BBD3,2009-07-25T20:09Z,"that big girl is captivating keep it up, thanks"
,lodger111,2009-07-25T20:15Z,"Great stuff, thanks dude.

@ chisinaumoldova, chacota: you have nothing to say, so why bother commenting?  Seriously.  If you don't like Kailyn's pics, just keep moving along.  It's not difficult."

,Bartolllo,2009-07-26T01:32Z,"I L O V E K a i l y n....
I've been watching this girl for some time...
She is so pretty... Those lips.. Those eyes...
Don't you guys remember the first chubby virgin
you ever f*cked? She willingly became your slave... Hahaha... Anything for her man..Hahaha.
Kudos to K'  for showing us her lovely voluptuous body...  Any of you MF'ers got the guts to do the same?
Bart loves Kailyn"
,tdatb,2009-07-26T06:14Z,"Bartolilo I dunno where you're from but here the only people who fuck chubby virgins are fat old potheads, Blacks, and Mexicans. The rest of us know they're only good for sucking your dick through junior high and highschool. Once you graduate you don't even talk to them anymore. You get a job and find nice hot girlfriend."
,lodger111,2009-07-26T09:37Z,"@ chisinaumoldova: I don't live in America, and I don't carpet bomb people's houses - not that either fact is relevant here, so I don't know what point you're trying to make.

You'll note that I wasn't being discourteous to you.  But your comment was offensive, and had no constructive use.  People who appreciate Kailyn can download the pics.  People who don't, can find something they *do* like and download that.  Either way, I doubt that anyone except you cares to read your cheap insults.  And it isn't beyond possible that the lady herself might read these comments?  Imagine how she'd feel to hear what you two think of her.

So for the sake of you making a clever comment, nobody benefits.  As I suggested before, if you don't have anything positive to say, why not just say nothing and move along?  There's more than enough misery in the world without any of us adding to it."
