I doubt that I will have time to play this anytime soon though as there are so many great games coming out at the same time and I will only have the time and resources to support a few of them. "

1. Install latest DaemonTools lite

3. Mount the mdf image with DT
4. start YASU check everything and cloak
5. press ctrl+alt+del and force shut YASU but when the question comes up to close the program press NO it will then close and work hidden in the background.
6. NOW start the game and when the securom fail thing comes up press RETRY and when it fails again just start the game again.

THIS should work, atleast it did for me im using Vista btw.

I've also changed the language from German to English (yes stbd, I have changed the value to English: erased the word 'German' and typed 'English'.) That did work though, the start menu and the char creation screen were both in english.

2. download vritual cd 9.X 
3. install it on advance (while installing u getting this option)
4. finish this instalation (next next etc but mark on ""permit indrect insert of vritual cd"")
5. then mount the image with deamon tool or alcohol 120%
6. go on vritual cd and mark ""creat a vritual cd"" and execute
7. choose the image of divinity 2 that is mounted by dt or alc120 (just click next)
8. close yasu/daemon tool/alcohol120%
9. rightclick on your ORIGINAL dvd/cd room -> instert a vritual cd -> divinity 2
10. install the game
11. overwrite dialog.dv4
12. change registry file (first u find when search on larian studio) lanuage to English(US)
Now play the game^^

1, 11 and 12 is only for english users

Dancolio, im passed that ages ago, there is 2 main entrances to tower, one do you need climb ladder up from bottom (found near bridge ruins at west area) that is real entrance, there will you find levers to activate platforms, open gates to step forward, or do like i did at first time, go on the undamaged brigde to 2th entrance go on edge and jump over (left side of bridge)"

Only way to remove force is to go to beach portal  and north east area is 2 pieers that leads out to 2 missons, you need complet the misson with the 3 lights around the grave (use one quest spell item to remove wind) after u got the ghost back you should go to sea side (portal)  and find the ""hidden"" doot left of portal, there contains the ring to resurect the ghost (password is found by mind read the  whale quest girl i think)

,IronBars,2009-08-06T18:38Z,"ok...Then the game still persist in using the default registery. I can see it does, cause while in German, everytime I try to speak to someone now, my char just puts away the weapon and stands there...cant move him or do anything. Probably cause its got ""no value"". 

Its no ""use this registry"" command in that menu."

,juzto,2009-08-09T13:15Z,"IronBars, ur right about it is dv2 not dv4,easy to remember wrong times to time^^  Let me try make it simple in case of missunderstanding, can you open the game en german(passed 2th load screen) before patching it over to english? If no then it is some wrong with ur instalation/mounting with virtual cd, if yes then but cant open it in english then problem is with overwrite of dialogs.dv2 and edititing registry. 
If problem in last part, check registry if \HKEY_LM\SOFTWARE\Larian Studio\Divinity 2\
and if REG_SZ lanuage has valuse data ""English(US)"" and check if you overwrote dialogs.dv2 (it should be 720 699 392 bytes and located ""Data\Win32\Packed\dialogs.dv2"" at folder of ur installed game. If both of these is right then u should be able play it with english text.

wraithsmith and defaulto, if you done it right as i wrote then just try use autorun on virtual cd mounted dvd, it sometimes gives up error but not permanently:)

krod77, it aint that hard, im only at level 31 but NEVER go vs enemies that is 7 or higher levels (as L12 u can easy do L18 mobs)

""Wrong disc inserted.
Please insert the original ""Divinity II - Release"" CD/DVD.""
ive even re extracted the mdf file recreated the DVD and reinstalled the game and still same results, since theres no crack i dont know what else to do "
,defaulto,2009-08-09T22:22Z,yeah i guess its my fault for using poweriso to create the vCD lol

,IronBars,2009-08-10T10:53Z,"I have done it right, but it does now stop loading in second loadscreen. I played the game in german before, so this started after i began to change the registry. The problem there is that even if I uninstall and reinstall the game, the registry does not change. I have a default REG_SZ with no value under larian studio. In the  divinity2 folder under larian I have 2 reg_SZ. One default-named with English(US) in data and one I try to name English (US) or language with also english(US) as data. The onlyone I am allowed to delete all of is the last one. 

Thanks for your effort Juzto, but it seems I fucked up the registry in some way and it wont get back to the original registry. 

If anyone know how to fix this please tell. I use Vista 64. "
,IronBars,2009-08-10T11:39Z,hmm It works in german before I copy the dialogs.dv2 still. Strange...just ....strange.
,swingster,2009-08-10T14:42Z,"juzto you seem to have a lot of knowledge when it comes to this game.
do you know how i will be able to make it stop saying im using a copy?
i have used the virtual drive thing and all that (not the english translation thing yet...) so i dont understand how it is that it dont work?"
,juzto,2009-08-10T15:24Z,"hellakos, use trailversion as defaulto says :) if you fail try again=)

bosnianomb, recomand upg your video and MAYBE cpu due it might lagg with decent grapic settings but it should be able play the game.

defaulto, didnt i tell make it with virtual cd:)? did you get to work now?

IronBars, try rightclick on your map with ""larian studio"" (same i mentioned before) in the registry and simple delete it and try add registry file again, Did this work?

krod77, try play as ranged, that is simple, get L7 summon undead, 10 evade, 10 wisdom, 1 regnation, 5 lockpicking then u easy run around with ur 2 creeps as tanks^^"
,juzto,2009-08-10T15:28Z,"swingster, As i wrote before, follow this guideline and you will remove your error
(1, 11 and 12 is only for english users, for german just skip em)

1. download englsih version of dialog.dv4 ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5041790/Divinity_2Ego_Draconis_English_Hot_Fix )
2. download vritual cd 9.X
3. install it on advance (while installing u getting this option)
4. finish this instalation (next next etc but mark on ""permit indrect insert of vritual cd"")
5. then mount the image with deamon tool or alcohol 120%
6. go on vritual cd and mark ""creat a vritual cd"" and execute
7. choose the image of divinity 2 that is mounted by dt or alc120 (just click next)
8. close yasu/daemon tool/alcohol120%
9. rightclick on your ORIGINAL dvd/cd room -> instert a vritual cd -> divinity 2
10. install the game
11. overwrite dialog.dv4
12. change registry file (first u find when search on larian studio) lanuage to English(US)
Now play the game^^

,hellakos,2009-08-10T15:34Z,"hey... sorry for the trouble so.. just finished installing using the v cd changing the dialogs.dv2 running the reg file and nothing when i try to run it , it says Please insert the original ""Divinity II - Release"" CD/DVD."
,PredatorRules214,2009-08-10T16:39Z,"followed those steps and this is what I get http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=copy&c=1000

,IronBars,2009-08-10T18:20Z,"I was able to delete the Larian folder, and then apply the registry file that comes with the english dialog.dv2. That eliminates me deleting some parts of the regfiles. It looked just like before however and did not work ( hangs on second loadscreen and all text still in German). 

I feel it may be the computer that does not see the english text and still tries to find the german text that is not there anymore ingame, cause of the different dialog.dv4. 

But why would the computer try to load either the first Default Reg_SZ under Larian or the next default Reg_SZ under divinity2 folder, when all I want is it to see and use the Language REG_SZ English(US) under divinity2? 

all text in starter menu and in character creation is still german....."
,IronBars,2009-08-10T18:31Z,"Predator rules: I think you get that because you try to start the game from your newly made virtual cd where you have the list of hard-drives and diskdrives (computer). 

You must load it into your normal diiskdrive by rightclicking it and inserting divinity2 there instead.....then you dont get that problem. (insert the elected virtual cd)...."

I'm not very good with computers, so I have some questions for someone more experienced. I'm just wondering, should I unzip all the files that I recieved? All the zipfiles contains a file of a size 6 GB which is huge, that does seem weird in my opinion. Is there someone who has the time to write an (very)detailed install walkthrough. I don't know much german( even though I'm a swede ;) ). 

Thanks alot for your help!"
,Raventhorn,2010-02-24T17:35Z,"@SAJGurree
I'd call the file rather small ;) most games nowadays have sizes over 8-10GB...
The file you see is an image of the original disk, with probably an additional folder for the crack/keygen, so its normal to be huge.

After unzipping the archives, you will have to use a program like Alcohol 120% or Daemon Tools to 'mount' it into a virtual drive.
This simulates a DVD/HD-DVD/BD drive.

From then on, it works just like a regular installation, besides having to apply a No-DVD crack (probably included on the disk)"
