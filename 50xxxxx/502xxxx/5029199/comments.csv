,Kindo,2009-07-29T04:08Z,"@reactor903: Please do. It's an amazing band, right up my alley. Like many others, I discovered them via the game Mass Effect (M4 (Part II), and once I started checking their other songs out, I was instantly smitten. :)"
[T],reactor90,2009-07-29T18:48Z,loved the music sorry my other account got banned..
,m0t0ko,2009-07-30T11:47Z,"Oh, wow. I'm speechless. Do you realize how long I've been looking for these? Thank you so much. Faunts is based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. And, I live there, so, you can see, I love em. Indie is awesome. Anyways, I cannot believe that this was uploaded only 4 minutes after I went to sleep after 3 hours of looking for it. THANK YOU!!!! And, awesome quality Kindo. 320kbps is near perfect in my books."
,Kindo,2009-07-30T13:28Z,"@m0t0ko: Hehe. Well, I've found torrents with their music (except for the remix one), but they're all in quite low quality - M4 is even in 128 CBR! Like you, I was searching like mad for anyplace that had higher quality releases. Eventually I gave up and bought them at that store (they offer MP3-version at 320 - they had all the albums), and figured I might as well create my own torrent. Canada has bred some great musicians over the years, and this might just be their finest yet! I'm situated, myself."
,Kindo,2009-07-30T13:29Z,"(Somehow I missed something in my last comment): I'm situated in Sweden, myself."
,KoRneY,2009-12-26T19:39Z,"FANTASTIC.  Thank you (:"""
,DrFealgood,2010-05-18T21:04Z,Ive got high hopes for this band. I loved M4 partII at the end of Mass Effect so I cant wait to see how there other music compares. 
,zstylin,2011-02-20T16:21Z,Thanks for the torrent!!! Wasn't sure I'd be able to find one!!!!
