"He Ain't Wit Me Now (Tho)" is a song performed by R&B girl group RichGirl. The single was produced by Rich Harrison, and will serve as their self-titled debut album's lead single (second overall).

The music video directed by Ray Kay . The music video starts of with all the girls walking to the front of the frame, and later shown full-length until the first verse starts. Lyndriette is shown during her verse in a life size square on the floor which appears on and off with men or the other girls in it. The music video continues with each girl on top of a square figure during their verse (Seven & Audra in a standing up square, and Brave on top of a box being spun). The camera shakes whenever the bass plays loud. The music video ends with the girls walking away from the first shot as the lights close.

The song was produced by Rich Harrison, who also did BeyoncÃ©'s "Crazy in Love" and Amerie's 1 Thing. The song is the lead single of the groups self-entitled debut album "RichGirl". The song features a background by piano keys and strings, along with a heavy bass with every other metronome note.

As of June 23, 2009 the single was released and is already getting airplay in the UK. A digital download and CD Single is yet to be released anywhere.
