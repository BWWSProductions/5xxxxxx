There were three attempts to kill General de Gaulle which were unsuccessful. The first was by German snipers in Paris 1945. The second attempt was on September 8th 1961 when a plastic charge was fired at his car by a gang controlled by Raoul Salan. The third attempt was on August 22nd 1962 when his car was raked with machine gun fire which shattered the rear window and burst two tyres. The General escaped all three attempts, but was there a fourth which was not reported?
