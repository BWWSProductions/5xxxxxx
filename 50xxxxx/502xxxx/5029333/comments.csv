,notenough,2009-07-29T11:50Z,"Someone uploaded the first episodes and then someone uploaded episode three and then someone uploaded another copy of episode three that was labeled as episode four and then this episode, episode 5, was uploaded.

,WillKatt,2009-07-29T13:34Z,"notenough - this IS the episode 4 according 
to IMDB:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132290/episodes
and TVrage:
http://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-7884
This is maddening that rippers persist to number them according to hours as usually and not reference sources.

If you check IMDB you see that episode Claudia is #4 and the episode #4 is the one that was aired yesterday. Episode 5 is to be aired only on the 4th of August and it is much anticipated by some of us due to Joe Flanigan from Stargate Atlantis guest starring in it."
,zen-TAO,2009-07-29T14:06Z,"Its nothing to worry about.
The 1st episode was a double one,
so ep 1 and 2 was together.
capice?"
[T],despo1ler,2009-07-29T18:07Z,"lol, it's the warehouse 13 influence causing the confusion over episode numbers to hide the true existence and whereabouts of the warehouse. Yeah, the double pilot should only be labelled as episode 1, this is episode 4, I've only found episode 2 today myself, thanks to all this mislabelling I got 2 copies of episode 03 instead of E02 and E03 because 1 of them was labelled as E04, :s"
,notenough,2009-07-30T05:33Z,"Thanks for clearing that up for me guys. I still have a pile of ""american dad"" episodes where I have no idea what the actual episode number is.

After a while I just give up and download the whole series all over again."
