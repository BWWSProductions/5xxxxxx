,Aikido4,2009-07-27T11:13Z,"  I have been DL-ing these, and all I can say is THX !!! Very very very much. I love F1 and I could never seem to find the races. Too bad you don't have any from the michael schumacher days in the mid to late 90's. Those where my fave races. 

 I like PPG CART races too with Greg Moore. I knew his family before he died. I am here on the coast of BC, Canda. ^_^"

,klaaz,2009-08-08T22:50Z,"Hi tdmk1,

Many thanks for uploading the BBC motogp airings! I usually wait for you to upload your version begore watching! I even try not to get the rankings before watching! This is sometimes hard while I have to wait some days before yours is available.

Is it possible to do it faster...? ;)"
