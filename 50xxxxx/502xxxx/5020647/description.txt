Four animated college friends doing research for a school project find themselves a part of the legend they're seeking to unravel when car troubles render them lost in uncharted Ozark Territory where a secret and sadistic society of the deformed awaits them. Through their enduring quest for survival, the eerie curtain covering a real-life American legend is lifted, and a past almost as disturbing as its present is uncovered in "Albino Farm."
