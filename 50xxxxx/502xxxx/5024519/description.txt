Celtic Legend

Continuing the narrative musical style of his previous release "Ghosts", Llewellyn returns with music inspired by celtic folklore. Gods, lovers, heroes, battles and honour are all portrayed in spellbinding musical interpretations of classic celtic legends. Featuring Medwyn Goodall (acoustic guitar on avalon), the album fuses keyboards, guitar, violin, atmospheric effects and alluring vocals in a heartfelt, spiritual tribute to the sacred celtic peoples. Power and energy and gentle beauty can all be experienced by the listener as they journey with the music from the realms of celtic gods, and the kingdom of the faery to the lands of Arthurian Legend.
