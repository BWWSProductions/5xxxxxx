,mistergroenevingers,2009-11-09T22:48Z,"now why do i get the feeling that 'Big_Seeder' is some asshole that works for some movie company or something trying to get himself into demonoid to snoop on pirates??
oh it's probably because he doesn't have a torrent to his name and is sad enough to call himself Big_Seeder and he just seems to damn eager and doesn't seem to understand the whole concept of when you would get invited to Demonoid
nobody give this cocksucker an invite please"

,Bigcrunkone,2010-06-22T04:57Z,"*WARNING* Big_Seeder *WARNING*

haha ill never send you an invite ""Big_Seeder"".  Its very clear that ""mistergroenevingers"" is right.  And with an e.mail like hot_controller_mods and a name like that?!  Only an idiot would send you an invite.  NO ONE INVITE HIM.  Demonoid is closed to keep ppl like YOU OUT."
,justakeit,2011-01-31T00:02Z,"@Bigcrunkone
I understand the irony of me asking this in reply to your post about NOT inviting someone but here goes...
How do you get an invite to Demonoid?  I want to avoid getting scammed by sites that claim they can invite you

Thanks.
