,Torent.Spy,2009-07-29T04:51Z,"He is not wacko nor crazy.This world is run by those people but they are ordinary human as we are.They are under influence of  something in Christianity known as a demons or fallen angels. In Bible Lucifer was called old usually dragon and serpent.In film industry and comics demons are usually portreted as lizards or half lizards.Why.?
There is lot of thing and i cant explain here all but if you want to understand this conspiracy you must read a lot of books from different sources "
,ThaStfu,2010-01-30T18:20Z,"Well hmm yea wacko right...............
Wtf people.I don't care if it's Iguana race or some frogs or motherfucking cows or humans.The very core of the problem is the fucking enslavement,which you obviously see unfolding day by day.
Everybody who say he is a wacko doesn't know a clue.Did you watch or read about who we are and stuff like that.Infinite love and all that.Gees people.We all need a better mind before setting foot in these waters.Because when you realise what is he talking about reptiles or human thematic about who is ruling the world become less important.But even so,there is a strong suggestion of reptiles"
,ObeEbe,2010-03-20T08:40Z,"@ Goatmaster:

Why do you judge so harshly on people who think ""outside the box"" ? Is some of this stuff making you uneasy ? 

You call people - whose perception on life is different from yours - losers ? Well good luck to you, it just goes to show what prison conciousness you live in.

I don't believe everything mr. Icke says - the reptilian stuff -  for example, but I think a lot of he says makes sense.

Live and let live. Peace."
,takepills,2010-05-07T09:24Z,"sistromo, kluelos, zmacdaddy8, lysergic.acid, goatmaster.. don't mind these people, they are paid disinformants, or just very sad about the human race finally coming out of the dark ages where everything is backwards/ base/ carnal/ lowest common denominator/ survival of the fittest,  thanks to brave warrior souls like david icke. If you notice the people mentioned above, they don't actually contribute anything on the pirate bay, they only waste everyone's time weakly trashing ""planet awesome"".

  thanks mr. icke! you are amazing! and way ahead of your time!! 

""one step ahead your called a geniues. two steps ahead your called insane."""
,WWu777,2010-05-07T22:16Z,"goatmaster, remember that ridicule is the defense of the fool against truth. icke may not be right about everything, but a lot of what he says is true and insightful and important.

,hissil,2010-05-10T22:22Z,"ROFL, Goatmaster  aka sistromo is a multi-account trolling faggot who goes around to all the major truth torrents on TPB posting the same rhetoric bullshit spam in order to prove his ignorance and obediance to his masters. He is a sad piece of shit with no life and just clicking on his profile will reveal his fascination with Beheading and other torture videos. "

,doorgunner,2010-12-03T18:24Z,"When you cannot understand why we have dilemmas like our current economic woes, just follow the money trail.  Icke has the banking industry figured out.  You folks need to learn to find the seeds of truth mixed in with the gravel.  If you don't buy the whole story; great.  But pick the wheat from the chaff.

America and the world is quickly headed for economic collapse because it will enrich the bankers.  Can't pay your mortgage?  ""Well, we have to foreclose...""  Multiply that times millions of houses and businesses.  Due to interest you paid for the house 4 times over and still lost it."
,Nergalsyn,2011-03-24T23:00Z,"People like David Icke, commander x, et al should not be called wacko. These people risk their lives and the lives of their loved ones to try an appeal to many closed minded people who are just to naive to believe his information. His new book, ""Human beings get off your knees"" should be read by anyone who is not a billionaire or hundred millionaire."
