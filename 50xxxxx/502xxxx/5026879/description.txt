I greatly appreciate the efforts of other uploaders (on this site and others), but I hated retagging all the songs from different soundtracks to correct errors and inconsistencies....(lol, OCD much?) After fixing them, I realized it would be in dereliction of duty to not provide them in a compilation for others.

To the best of my knowledge, these are the complete, non-game-ripped versions of the Half-Life 1, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Episodes 1 and 2, Portal, and The Orange Box soundtracks. it was a pain in the ass tagging all these, but I think it paid off. :)

As you may notice, some of the HL1 songs are on the HL2 soundtrack as well (albeit with different names) -- songs' alternate names are included in the title tag.

Enjoy.
