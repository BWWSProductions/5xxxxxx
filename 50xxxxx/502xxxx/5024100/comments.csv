,psphackerowned,2010-02-25T00:18Z,"thanks for these dubbed torrents but for your information you dont have the episodes in the right folder season number, great quality and it doesnt have the season in the name so all you have to do is look at wikipedia and just move them into the right season folder name if you even care great up!!!"
,lil45,2010-04-10T12:59Z,hey man how do we get all complete episodes of 'em there are three to four with only 4.06 minutes my most players say they are currupt

,aqwsde,2010-12-12T06:42Z,"i have problems viewing some episodes of this season, vlc reports it as a broken index file, although i have finished downloading those episodes completely. Please help !!!!! at the earliest . Thanks"
,goodyme,2010-12-14T01:55Z,"hi
just to let people know this as i said in the description is a 4Kids dub. they cut out entire episodes and even mix a few episodes together that's why the ep description or number might be wrong
Goodyme"
,aqwsde,2010-12-14T13:57Z,"I think i know what the problem is. I use Vuze to download it tells me that i have successfully finished download episode 62, but in the folder it's just 57 MB instead of the usual 182.10 MB. Please do a favour to all of us. People (goodyme) who have successfully downloaded the whole lot please seed these episodes. Thanks a lot for the up, goodyme."
