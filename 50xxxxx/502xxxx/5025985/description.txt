Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts. Formed following the disbandment of the bands Overcast and Aftershock in 1999, Killswitch Engage's lineup consists of vocalist Howard Jones, bassist Mike D'Antonio, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, and drummer Justin Foley. Signed to Roadrunner Records, the band has released five studio albums and one DVD.
Killswitch Engage rose to fame with its 2004 release The End of Heartache, which peaked at number 21 on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold in December 2007 for over 500,000 shipments in the United States. The title track, "The End of Heartache", was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2005, and a live DVD titled (Set This) World Ablaze was released in 2005. Killswitch Engage have attended festivals such as Wacken Open Air, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Ozzfest, Download Festival, Rock on the Range, Mayhem Festival, and the Australian Soundwave Festival. The band released their fifth studio album, Killswitch Engage II
Killswitch Engage (sometimes called Killswitch Engage II to avoid confusion with the band's 2000 album of the same name) is the fifth studio album by the metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It marks the first time the band has worked with an outside producer, Brendan O'Brien (known for his work with AC/DC, The Offspring, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, Incubus, Mastodon, and Stone Temple Pilots). It was released on June 30, 2009 via Roadrunner Records. A special edition and vinyl record of the album was released on the same day. On the band's official website, if a pre-order for the album was made, the buyer would be entered into a drawing to win a custom Parker P44 guitar with artwork from the album as the paint job.
The album peaked at #7 on the Billboard 200, selling 58,000 copies in its first week of release, making it the band's highest charted album to date.
