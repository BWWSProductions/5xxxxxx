  I ran across something interesting.  Some conspiracy theorist claiming stargate has some validity to it in real life.  Project Camelot has some interview, and they don't seem crazy or lying.  They even had that theme in the show if you remember."

When a ""new"" cut arrives,
it use to be someting more to it.
But this one is in fact 7 minutes less
than the original episode.
(You can read it for yourself.)

Thanks for the UL anyway.

Peace and Love!"
