lookup the vista and win7 edition basics first before you start noobing around.

without any of those letters means its the full edition, nothing stripped away.

E means no internetexplorer.
N means no windowsmediaplayer

,4n0n,2009-07-25T08:56Z,"Earlier this week there were reports that Microsoft had discovered some show-stopping bugs that would delay the RTM, but if build 7600 is legitimate, then Microsoft has obviously found a way around the issues. This build is in the process of being leaked into the wild, but we recommend exercising caution with build 7600 as Microsoft has not confirmed (or denied) its existence.

Microsoft was rumored to be aiming for compiling the RTM build on July 13, 2009. If 7600 is indeed the RTM build, we can expect an official announcement as early as tomorrow, at the kickoff of the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference, which is taking place in New Orleans. Of course, for all we know, build 7700 might end up being the RTM, so let's all hold our horses until Microsoft gives the official word."

1)  Each activation tool needs to be run as ""Administrator"" - Right-click --> Run as administrator

2)  Activator 1.5 and Toolkit 1.8 use ""frankenbuild"" methods, which use hacks to inject RC code/keys and activate them, hence the possible addition of expiration dates (run WINVER)

3)  TimerNuke nukes the activation pieces altogether, so activation status stays at ""unknown""

4)  ALL activation hacks should be considered temporary, as Microsoft deploys countermeasures against them - YMMV

No there is not an upgrade option for Windows 7 Beta builds nor will there be."
,byzantium54,2009-08-02T23:29Z,"WINDOWS 7 BUILDS CAN BE UPGRADED TO RTC!!!!!! READ BELOW...this is from www.zdnet.com....

Microsoft really, really, really doesn?t want you to install the Windows 7 Release Candidate or RTM code over an existing installation of the Windows 7 beta (or over any interim builds, for that matter or RTM). The result is a beta-over-beta installation that could exhibit odd behaviors that a customer installing the final version of Windows 7 would never confront. Not only that, but any feedback you send in via the automated tools built into Windows 7 is mostly useless for identifying problems in the final build.

So, as a result, the RC blocks upgrades over any build earlier than 7077. If you?ve been running the original beta (Build 7000) and you try to upgrade, you?ll see an error message.

But if you insist on doing the upgrade anyway, there?s a workaround. Start by copying the entire contents of the Windows 7 DVD to a local folder (use a bootable USB drive, or create a folder in the root of the drive you?re planning to upgrade, and then run Setup from that location).

In the folder you just created, open the Sources subfolder and then open the file Cversion.ini in a text editor like Notepad.

Change the MinClient value (highlighted in yellow above) to 7000 and save the file in the same location with the same name.

You can now run Setup without being bothered by the version check.

THIS WORKS! Follow above...and enjoy"

Login with your MSN messenger ID and verify it yourself if you don't trust me! p.s. ""Hash Tab"" can be use to check the CRC & SHA1 values; just google it.

Great job @ torrentshredder! Thank you."

,mathfast,2009-08-16T09:37Z,"Nice quick torrent, add me to the list of seeders. If anyone can help tho? Running out of ideas. ISO hashes out great (CRC32 and SHA1 both compare (used HashTab))!! Burned image loads windows files okay but BSODs shortly thereafter, ""STOP: c000021a fatal system error"". Status of 0x00000000 (0xc0000001 0x001003f0). 

The image is a *fresh partitnd XP* + sp 3. Sorry 2b noobing; (1) I ran ubuntu on it for a few months??, (2) its a Toshiba notebook brand new still w/latest firmware, (3) the BIOS was originally 4 vista cuz that's what it shipped with. 

So, is this iso purely for upgrade from Vista? Anyone please hit me back if something glaringly missing.   "
,ashmat,2009-08-16T12:50Z,"@Mathfast,

It is certainly not purely for an upgrade from Vista. I had a similar problem installing it on an older laptop of mine, bsods after the loading windows files screen, however that turned out to be RAM related (Flawless install with a gig of RAM) Though I'm sure if your notebook is new and came with Vista it already has that or greater.

So all I can think to say is back your shit up and try a fresh install...:)"

btw, about the Activation.
-----------------------------
Hey Guy's
........

btw, I tired this toolkit 1.8 but it won't work with me a least! 
--------------
anyway..
I just activated.

Here's How:

- Look for ' 7loader_1.4 ' & download it.

-Then, all what you have to do is just one Click on { Intall 7Loader}.

- A small window will appears click (OK )

- Then You done with 'genuine'.

Enjoy ^_^

Peace!

AMD Phenom X4 9150e Quad-Core Processor
4 gb system memory
500 gb hard drive
GeForce 9400gt

Ok.  heres my problem.  I installed Windows 7.  Just the basic operating system.  Not any of that extra stuff that came from the factory.  I should of had alot of extra space.  Before i installed windows 7 i had 436gb free space on my hard drive.  After i installed Windows 7 i only had 358gb free space.  I want my space back.  I deleted the Windows.old file and that freed up about 30gb.  Am i missing something?  What am i doing wrong?  Someone please help.  I don't wanna go back to vista but i might have to.  I need my hard drive space back.  Thank you."

,Grenadeh,2009-09-12T11:20Z,"Oh also btw, you're mentally retarded. EN has absolutely nothing to do with IE or Media player. The EN versions of Vista had both, and the EN versions of 7 have both. There's no such thing as a Windows release that comes without IE or WMP, they have been part of the OS longer than you've been alive. There may be custom modified images that come without them, aka they aren't actual windows releases."
