Young women disappear one after another in drizzling rain. They all hear the â€œcursed songâ€ of the Cage Song before they vanish into thin air. Kitaro and his friends investigate these mysterious cases when they meet Kaede Hiramoto, a high school girl who finds herself involved in this mystery. With the help from the librarian of Yokai Library, they find out that the curse was caused by an evil Yokai that was released from 1,000 years of sealing. To save Kaede, they are to gather the 5 ancient musical instruments and perform the ritual to seal the evil Yokai again, which has to be done within 48 hours!

In search for the ancient instruments, Kitaro and his buddies depart for three different points that the ancient map indicates Kitaro & Kaede head to â€œskyâ€, the sacred mountain in Hakone, Cat-girl and Ratman head to â€œlandâ€, Mt. Takao, and Sand Witch and Old Cry Baby head to the â€œoceanâ€ off the coast of Miura peninsula.

Will Kitaro be able to stop the curse, protect Kaede and the human beings from the evil Yokai, and also, overcome his destiny?
