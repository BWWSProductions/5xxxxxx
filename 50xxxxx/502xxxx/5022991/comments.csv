,xiIix,2009-08-04T21:02Z,"Amazing torrent. This is the only torrent of it's kind in existence right now. The rest of the box sets are all shitty TV rips.

This is the most powerful television series I've ever had the privilege of watching. It really changes the way you look at life. I highly recommend that anyone out there who appreciates truly original pieces of work that dig into you and don't let go... watch this from beginning to end, a couple episodes a day. A couple years ago I downloaded the whole set in TV rips and watched it in about 2 weeks. It completely blew me away. No television series has ever come close to as hard hitting as this. Such an amazing series. Alan Ball is a genius."
,Soeni,2009-08-26T09:35Z,"C`mon guys, Seed for meh!

,AgentEve,2009-10-09T13:31Z,Please seed!!!!!
,DwightOnTheSpot,2009-10-10T23:24Z,"I set my upstream limit to 100 kbs/sec and I swear that my download speed went up. It's like a miracle. Give and receive. 

Must be why it is called file SHARING."
,apparentsymmetry,2009-10-18T15:21Z,"Thank you so much for sharing this... 


Halfway through the first season, I didn't understand how this had made people think differently about the world around them, and had no idea how they put together 5 seasons of people living in a funeral home... but by the end of the first seasons I was amazed by the character development (though it's not too hard for them to grow considering how they all are in the first couple of episodes. What got to me is how they grow...), story line, even the sort of artsy way the series is shot. This really is one of the best shows I've seen, ever. 

So thank you again for uploading this... "
,mightysarax,2009-12-27T23:55Z,please seed!

,CassandraCheeks,2010-01-09T14:09Z,Can someone please seed? I would love to see this :)
,Pisces17,2010-02-05T01:04Z,"Can everyone please seed this entire thing and keep your upload limits at a respectable level. Right now I am only trying to get season 1 alone and it is moving at a horrible 12kbs.

574 Leechers and one 68 Seeders?! Cmon people, dont be lame. And for th people Seeding...68 Seeders should not result in such a low speed. 

Crank the limits up and dont be a fucking lamer...SHARE."
,pinco84,2010-02-06T03:34Z,"Great quality torrent... Thanks for the good work, let's just hope it doesn't take forever to download! :)"

,irish62,2011-03-12T06:31Z,seeeeed pleeassee!!!
,dollarscholar,2011-09-14T20:49Z,"hey Spotted_jackal, I appreciate your work. Seen your stuff a bunch on my fav HBO shows.... Any chance you can make a torrent for ARLISS???? It was a GREAT HILARIOUS SHOW on HBO that was on during 6th Feet Unders time.... Its even on DVD, so I don't get why there isn't 1 result for ARLISS, not here, not extratorrent, not on google when you type arliss torrent! It's celebrity cameos rival that of ENTOURAGE. Both great shows, but I continue looking for an ARLISS torrent, for a season or the series, and have never found anything!"
,nick98999,2011-09-27T03:38Z,"I am praying the seeders increase here. I often am getting maybe 30k/sec on a 25mbps pipe. 

due to this I will happily help out seeding afterwards. Unfortunately my upload speed is only 200kps, but I will dedicate a majority of that to help others seed as well. 

thanks, uploader, for helping share such an amazing package. this is the bees knees of awesomeness. "
,j3d000,2011-10-01T12:01Z,"I am getting around 700KB/s download speed, and I am uploading at 7 MB/s. The share % just reached over 1,000 % :)"
,thefizdude,2011-11-10T17:10Z,Nice share! Thanks a lot matey!!!
,logan-xart,2011-12-22T03:23Z,...this torrent is shit...mkv is shit...
