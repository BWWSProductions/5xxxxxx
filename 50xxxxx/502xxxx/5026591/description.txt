Storyline: Set against the coming of Christianity, this is the 
story of the last hero: in 507, a monstrous troll wrecks havoc in the mead hall of the Danish king, Hrothgar. 
He offers rewards for the death of Grendel, so Beowulf, a great and boastful Geet warrior, arrives with his thanes. 
Beowulf sets aside his armor and awaits the monster; a fierce battle ensues that leads to Beowolf's entering the 
watery lair of Grendel's mother, where a devil's bargain awaits. Beowulf returns to Herot, the castle, and becomes 
king. Jump ahead many years, and the sins of the father are visited upon Beowulf and his kingdom. The hero must 
face his weakness and be heroic once again. Is the age of demons over?
