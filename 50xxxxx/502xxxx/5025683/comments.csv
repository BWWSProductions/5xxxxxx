thanks!!!"
,tdmk1,2009-07-27T11:06Z,"@f12009 - I'm the uploader and there won't be any more seeds until my line can push it all out to a few more people - donations greatly accepted for a 100Mb line to make this process faster... ;)

Just kidding - I always seed until there's a good few people who have a complete copy as well as myself. :)"
