,survivorguy,2010-09-17T12:16Z,"I got to 67% and it said 'Error: Access is Denied' and went back to 66.8%.

It was working like 2hrs before this happened. I had stopped the download briefly so i could try to stream the finished videos to my xbox. Unless that affected it somehow...anyone know a fix to this problem?"

,mathewnik,2012-06-05T15:31Z,"why is the traslation different from other videos????
ZORO is called zolo and the intro is completely different

Why is that???"
,HcNwn111,2012-06-16T06:08Z,"@mathewnik:
That's because this is the 4Kids Dub, if you want the original Japenese to English Dub, you should llok for the Funimation Dub which is HEAPS EASIER to find.

Thank You very much Goodyme for this torrent, it took me AGESSSSS to find the 4Kids Dub, PLEASE EVERYONE KEEP SEEDING!"
