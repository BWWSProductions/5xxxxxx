This is DVD9-rip, not DVD5."
,The_Outlaw,2009-10-08T22:02Z,No it is DVD5 as you can see from the file size
,kklasen,2009-10-10T00:31Z,This guy compressed the file wich sucks. And I cant open it since its last file is damaged.
,TheLeech,2009-11-03T23:52Z,"This is DVD-9, not DVD-5! When everything is extracted, the size of the ISO is 5.27 GB
I think the uploader needs to ajust the title so people don't waste their time and bandwith downloading this thinking it's DVD-5!"
,vkey1781,2009-12-11T01:24Z,"hi guys

,felix555,2010-01-20T12:23Z,"First of all it is a real PAL DVD9 rip
and  I T   W O R K S  (on my moded PS2).
To make it work, BEFORE burning you must aply ''Toxic Dual Layer Image Patcher''  program on .iso image file, which you exrtact from .rar files!
After u get confirmation of succesfull patching from Toxic's program than you can go to burn it on a DUAL LAYER media.
I made it work with Samsung DVDwriter on Verbatim DVD-R DL on 4x speed in Nero Burning Rom.
(Toxic's Patcher program you can also find here on Pirate bay's torrents)
I play it without problem on my moded PS2
P.S.   seed what u downloaded so others can make it work to!"
,azzaman77,2011-01-03T18:23Z,"Can anyone (or uploader) confirm this is for DL dvd??
and that thing ""felix555"" is talking about, that 'Toxic Dual Layer Image Patcher'',, is this needed ;) ??"
,azzaman77,2011-01-05T17:18Z,"I just downloaded it, applied ""toxic patch"" and tryed to burn using Nero on dvd+r dl media..
After 3% of burning process, it failed and gave me an error message ""could not perform end of disc-at-once""..
I googled this and found it could be due to one of the folowing:

Bad quality disc
""Dirty"" burners lens
High memory usage while burning
Non-up-to-date Nero (or other software)..

I'm mentioning this only for benefit of others, because I'm ok with all of that (at least I think so), but I'm only unsure could it be due to unappropriate media, since I was using +R DL instead of -R DL that is required according to Felix555's post above??"
,felix555,2011-01-22T02:10Z,"@azzaman77

Yes, ""Toxic...Patcher"" IS needed, otherwise disc layers will not be burned properly!

Try it with  -RW DL  (if you didn't  in the meanwhile), it worked for me and still does. And offcourse burn it at low speed.

Instead of ""Nero"" you can use ""Alcohol120%"" program, since it has dedicated datatype setting for PS2.
Goodluck

P.S.
You may aply Toxic's patcher on the extracted image ONLY ONCE. If you did it twice delete it and make new extraction to get fresh iso image. You should get the message that patching was succesfull. (it takes about 2 seconds)"
,felix555,2011-01-22T02:22Z,"C O R E C T I O N :

Try it with  -R DL  (DVD-R DL)

NOT with -RW DL, as I wrote above by mistake"

anyway, will it work with pcsx2?"
,nick141,2011-04-12T15:30Z,"To make things clear:

* This is a PAL DVD9 rip.

* 100% original, untouched (size and checksums match with http://redump.org/disc/359/).

* If you have a modchip with DVD9 support (such as Matrix Infinity and DMS4), you can burn it straight to a DVD+R DL. Also make sure DVD9 support is enabled in your modchip configuration.

* In any other case, you first need to apply Toxic Dual Layer Image Patcher on the .iso file (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3324176/Toxic_Dual_Layer_Image_Patcher_v1_0).

* Swap Magic probably won't work.

* It is recommended to set the booktype to DVD-ROM instead of DVD+R DL when burning."
