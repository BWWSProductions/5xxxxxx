,Bb308,2009-08-14T01:35Z,"=== Also @ filthdx ===

Once mounted with daemon tools, go to my computer and right click on the drive with FUEL (Probably (J:) or something). 
Click explore to open it up. 
Then in the Razor1911 folder will be the crack. (The little FUEL icon)
Copy and replace that into the folder where you installed the game ( Likely to be something like c:/Programme files/FUEL.

,pallepop909,2009-08-15T15:52Z,Guys .. Im gettin all the correct files that i normally would Extract but they arent rar files i only gett the option to compress them ?? whats wrong here
,nitraaa,2009-08-15T16:29Z,"If you're having problems extracting or mounting the ISO properly, read this.

I was unable to extract the files using 7zip, and when extracting the files using WinRar I had problems mounting the iso properly using DaemonTools. The file was mounted with no error, but when trying to access the files were corrupt.

To fix this problem, I renamed all of the files in the directory to rzr-fuel.001.r00, rzr-fuel.001.r01, rzr-fuel.001.r02, rzr-fuel.001.r03 and so on. This solved the problem. I'm not sure why this works, but I'm guessing it's wrong to give the first rar file in a list the name .001 so giving it the extension .r00 solved it for me."

Because this is...and as always from extremezone.
Incredibly easy to install.

STEP 1
Double click the first rar 

STEP 2
Drag the iso out of it, to where you want it

STEP 3
Install Game from ISO file with Daemon tools once its done extracting

STEP 4
Once game is installed, open the iso file with winrar and take the cracks from the razor folder.



DONE. "
