Three college roommates are on the ride oftheir lives when they drop everything to join a bus full of sexy, scantily clad models to compete in the ultimate sport competition: the National Beer Pong Tournament.

With all these detours will they reach the competition and win the ultimate title? Getting Your Pong On has never been this fun!
