(petter_sundgren: om det är engelska subs du menar så brukar det variera, ibland redan samma dag, ibland dröjer det flera dagar. Svenska tar veckor.)

Prova här de är ganska snabba:

,CherryxDarling,2009-07-27T18:20Z,"Does anyone know where they filmed the church scene where Sookie and Hugo first meet Sarah? Because it looks absolutely identical to the Rose Hills Cemetery Sky Rose Chapel in City of Industry, CA. My sister had her nursing graduating ceremony there and my friend had a funeral service there and I can't help but think that it's the same chapel. I Googled for about an hour and couldn't find anything... "
,CherryxDarling,2009-07-27T18:21Z,"Seriously, Google that chapel I mentioned and tell me it doesn't look exactly like it."

,CherryxDarling,2009-07-28T18:57Z,"Actually once they showed the inside of the church I knew for sure it was Sky Rose Chapel in Rose Hills Cemetery. It's an extremely beautiful place, too bad it's in the middle of a cemetery."

,rebelBodhi,2009-08-01T02:10Z,"Note to everyone: I got my internet shutdown for the first time because of torrents for dl'ing True Blood.  It worked out OK in the end, but they had my IP.  

~HBO is watching True Blood Torrents and contacting the ISPs very quickly~~

I was using PB and BTJunkie, so don't know which swarms are being watched.  And I forgot to run PeerGuardian for a day or two.  In any case, be careful."
,Noluckk,2009-10-20T09:52Z,Thanks
,izzyzum12,2010-01-12T06:12Z,"
most cable companies work on a 3 strikes and your out program.  If you use a router they cant identify which IP is responsible but after three times getting caught they cut off your internet and the house address is flagged so cable from that company can not be re ordered.

 When you get caught the first 2 times they dont tell you right away, i assume it comes in the mail. most ppl call the cable provider and its explained that whatever companies shit u stole contacted your provider and said this fucker is stealing our moives\games\shows\whatever cut his internet off or we will sue you. so the do.  Thats all they can do to you up until that point I believe.  

How to stop it i dont know. Id like to hear any ideas or solutions. thanks and your welcome to those who asked."
