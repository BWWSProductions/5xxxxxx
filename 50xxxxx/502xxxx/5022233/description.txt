Chickenfoot har gett ut ett album 2009.

Chickenfoot is a hard rock band, supergroup featuring vocalist Sammy Hagar (ex-Van Halen and Montrose), bassist Michael Anthony (ex-Van Halen), guitarist Joe Satriani and drummer Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers). Chickenfoot have recently completed a self-titled album that was released on June 5, 2009.
 
Chickenfoot first performed together in February 2008 at a Sammy Hagar concert in Las Vegas. They had a three song set which included Led Zeppelin's "Rock And Roll" and Traffic's "Dear Mr. Fantasy". From the performance it appeared that Chad Smith (drummer) was the 'glue' that holds the band together: "The material is really slamming, and anybody who has ever been around Chad knows that he is a very huge personality, a very high-energy guy and his drumming in person is explosive," Satriani says. "This band really gives him carte blanche to go crazy. I think it's the best of what you'd expect, that's the best way to put it. No one is acting out of character." 
Chickenfoot performed during Conan O'Brien's first week as host of the Tonight Show, June 5th, 2009, playing their single, Oh Yeah!. This is the same date as their first album release. Chickenfoot began their tour in Europe shortly afterwards, as they plan to come back to North America, August 2nd, to finish their tour, starting with the Canadian Forces Halifax Rock Fest.
