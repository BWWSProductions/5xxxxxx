well there were so many copies of this i figured the mpaa wouldn't notice one more                    
work done:

stg said the colors we're off and alot of work needed to be done, i disagree this video is untouched    
the original spanish group did good.                                                                         
                                                                                                                         
audio source: Harry.Potter.6.Half.Blood.Prince.CAM.XviD.EngAudio-androme.mkv                  
the original group did alot of work getting their file out first and i'm not ready to let them be    
forgotten so soon                                                                                      
                                                                                                                         
converted audio to 192 abr                                                                                      
                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                         
other groups stretched audio to sync with video at 25 fps; the audio syncs fine with out that once the file   
plays at proper film speed 24.000 fps                                                                           
                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                         
this is a good release, not perfect, both cd's are oversize, but at least im the first one that knows   
enough to reconize that                                               
                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                         
height and width are divisible by 16, dupe frames are removed, audio is not cbr                 
appearance is fine, and i didnt rape the awesome new audio thats out
