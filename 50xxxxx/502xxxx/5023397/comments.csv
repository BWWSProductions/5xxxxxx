,yadayadaya,2009-09-09T19:07Z,"R0CK7Y too bad only 1 of those is consider rap.  Akon is borderline and the others are closer to rock than rap.  Nice work.  If you want hip-hop,

I say Little Brother
I say Common
I say KRS-ONE
I say The Roots
I say De La Soul
I say Gangstarr
I say Buckshot
I say Doom
I say Cunninglynguist

Your problem is with the establishment, not with the music.  Headbanger shit gets no real airplay.  Well guess what, neither does real hip-hop.  Get your facts straight before you come around running your mouth like you have half a clue what you are talking about.  If you support real hip-hop and disturb tha peace (Luda style) copy and paste to 4 videos."
,yadayadaya,2009-09-09T19:12Z,"And what is funny is you posted that and I just went and looked at what torrents you uploaded.  Gorillaz...who did a song with De La Soul, one of the artists I mentioned.  LOL at you again."
,sandeep90,2009-10-10T00:14Z,This isn't the album...
