"Just wanted to tell you that I am always excited to get home to Movie Label when new DVD films arrive in my mailbox. I actually learn a lot reading the information downloaded for each movie! It's also nice to watch my collection growing in the graphs :) Letting friends browse the collection for movies to watch
 is also fantastic! Thank you."

"Perfecto!! I can now show my friends the width of my collection and I can a list of them borrowing my DVD. I also know now when I last watched a movie. And the trivia while downloading is genius! Last thing: The support you have given me has always been quick and on target. Nice weekend to you and you may quote me on this."
