,glasseffects,2009-08-22T00:18Z,"Does everything in this world sounds ""porn"" to you?

Mods please delete those two comments asap!"
,Joy89,2009-08-23T02:32Z,thank you so much!! it really a precious collection.
,GoldenInk,2009-10-05T07:36Z,"Mods, please don't delete that.

It may not be a great comment but freedoms are a rare moment in this world. Who cares if some idiot calls Shakespeare a porn star. 

Leave it for the sake of free speech and a few human rights. "
,zeinabqureshi,2009-11-21T13:15Z,"Quite interesting to see how a rather strange name gives people ideas. Apart from the big joke, this is a very precious torrent, though it's a bit unjustified to put into that miniscule size (approx 500 MB wmv for three-hour plus plays). However, the entire DVD set will set you back by something like 600-700 US dollars, so it's a great gesture even to share. Many, many thanks."
,knee69,2009-12-10T11:59Z,Big thankyou from Sweden
,method_shaolin,2010-01-06T19:53Z,"Thanks alot! 

P.S. Are the lines they speak identical to the original Shakespeare texts?"
,Bardak,2010-01-20T18:04Z,"Is this classical Shakespeare, or the ones the BBC adapted, including ""Macbeth"" being set in a restaurant and one of the portents being ""When pigs can fly"" and a police helicopter comes down to get Macbeth?"
,Gorilla25,2010-04-17T17:14Z,"This would be the BBC Television Shakespeare, shot between 1978 and 1985 and featuring top-class versions of 37 Shakespeare plays in pretty close to the original uncut texts performed by an incredible set of casts: Gielgud, Jacobi, Mirren, Horden, Hawthorne, etc etc etc. Not a police helicopter to be seen."
,harriedpotterpirate,2010-07-13T07:48Z,Thanks Sheila6 for this superb torrent.nnand thanks to all the seeders too. I\'m gonna seed this one for a long time.
,blackbox_jones,2010-12-12T22:59Z,"OH MY GOD.  I think I've seen these!  Anthony Hopkins plays Othello, Derek Jacobi plays (a slightly older) Hamlet, and the ""Where's your neck?"" guy from ""Rocky Horror"" Julius Caesar plays Julius Ceasar.  Puck is played to resemble Sid Vicious.  This stuff is awesome.

Looks like the best torrent ever, and I just got a faster connection."
