Andy Middleton re-joins "Dicks Diamonds'" Dick Strawbridge and Jim Milner for this second caber-tossing challenge.

Their three challengers : "The Paintball Terriers", "The Mersey Mechanics" and "The Tramps".

The challenge is to again build a caber-tossing machine and an Atlas-stone thrower.

The winner of the three challenging teams earns the right to take on "The Diamonds".

Help me seed & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

I'm adding one episode a day Mon - Fri as they air on ABC2 digital TV here in Australia. (Yes, we're getting them before the UK).
