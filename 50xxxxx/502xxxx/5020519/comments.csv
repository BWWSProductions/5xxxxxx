I seem to be the only one continually seeding the episodes, even though plenty of you have downloaded them. (Although a bloke in Vietnam left a message saying he's doing his part - & he's on dial-up...shame on you cable / dsl connections)

For the final 2 episodes, I will allow people to get no more than around 85% of the files until I see all the other episodes being made available to others. (Alternatively, you could wait until they air in your own country & record them yourself & post them - if you're selfless enough, that is).

I'm not a one-man army - I can't feed the world. It's a team effort - join the team, do your part.

Get your share ratio to 1.0 or better...mine are all over 10.0 & yet I still find people have no other source other than me."
