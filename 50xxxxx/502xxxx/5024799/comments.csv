,Mr888,2009-07-27T02:30Z,"Thanks heaps, I missed it live, the first one Ive missed live in over 10 years i think...and a McLaren victory at that. Our thoughts for Massa, we hope and pray he will be ok.  Stellar work jorrell, Ive been sweating on this being uploaded the last few hours, lol. I will seed all day today and tomorrow at least, along with the pre-race for whoever else wants it. thanks jorrell - from an F1 Fan"
,Mr888,2009-07-27T03:37Z,"got to 35%, or 425 Mb, and the download speed has dropped right off and even stopps. (?)"
,Mr888,2009-07-27T09:55Z,upto 90% and will seed for a few days
,Mr888,2009-07-27T15:43Z,"got it all and looks good quality, you're a champion. I'm seeding this for 48 hours. "
,tgetkrunk,2009-07-27T17:52Z,"Nice work Mr88 you massive spoiler! I didn't know who won till I read your post...

Maybe think next time huh.

Thanks for the up jorrell."
,Mr888,2009-07-27T22:37Z,"sorry tgetkrunk , but you should know by now to wear earplugs all day and avoid televison and even avoid reading anything at all until you get to watch the race. Lesson learned ok?  noted anyway. ;)"
,Mr888,2009-07-28T06:55Z,"I am still seeding like 90 others, for the sake of soft-cocks like tgetkrunk. tgetkrunk should get his mouth off David Coulthard's cock and not miss the live broadcast next time, or try not read the fucking comments before he knows the result of the fucking race. Go milk yourself tgetkrunk, too much frustration in your tone, the fucking McLarens won so cheer the fuck up son !  LOL - Lowndsey"
