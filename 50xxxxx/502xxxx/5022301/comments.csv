,AnimeLover2010,2010-05-25T19:22Z,"Thanks - I'll seed for alittle while, and stop, then seed some more :) It'll take 1week on my connection nice speed."
,Yankme206,2010-07-29T12:28Z,"I've been downloading this all day and i think that speed is actually pretty good
i mean its not extremely fast but thats a given with big torrents and the sheer seeder to leecher ratio

i will be seeding this til about a ratio of 5 for what im downloading from it or something along those lines"
,jroot45,2010-08-18T06:38Z,come on people seed so i can after!
,haleer_you,2010-08-21T21:28Z,seed please
,Tsuribachi,2010-09-02T05:07Z,"@rahul325 That site only gives out a free RealMedia file, and anyone worth a shit know Real isn't.  It says avi version, but oops you have to pay for that one. Fuck your dipshit site.

@anyone else, Seed please. If I get this in less than a week, I'll seed to 10.00"
,theRealKarmine,2010-09-22T18:45Z,dubs suck because they remove the cussing.  fuck dubs.
,theRealKarmine,2010-09-23T09:56Z,"and to the idiots seeding, limit your upload slots to like 2 so people get this shit faster.  2 people downloading from you at 1mb a second is better than 75 people downloading from you at 0.2k a second.  no wonder the speed sucks.

if i wanted to download at shit speeds like this id travel back to the 80's."
,Austivo,2010-10-03T12:23Z,Thanks a ton gonna take a while but i can wait lol :p
,gr3gp,2010-11-01T04:27Z,"Can't burn 168-229, they r corrupt :( tried twice and now I want the week it took me to dl and re-dl them again back!!!"
,carnis666,2010-12-06T18:20Z,does anything happen if i dont seed? id like to but i cant have anymore than a few files cause i dont have very much space
,Ruisoul,2011-02-16T23:34Z,seed ppl... its very slow... im almost at 100%  but ill keep on sending after im finished.. u should do the same.. thanx =)
,ibeandii,2011-03-03T08:42Z,thanks nice torrent and it would be nicer if everyone wasnt such a tightass on their bandwith and clicked the unlimited button on their upload limit... please seed. 
,codnips,2011-03-04T10:17Z,not worth dlding 46 seeders 217 leechers gg
,iamhelix,2011-04-07T04:21Z,"you fucks are killing the torrent scene, all you do is download and then remove it from your upload list when its finished, soon torrents will only last a few days becasue of idiots like you. You fuckers, i'm keeping a IP address log of everyone that downloads and then doesn't seed, and you will be blocked from further torrents and may have some other misfortune as well ;-("
,aknight,2011-04-13T13:37Z,"I registered just to say thanks on this one. I've been trying to get the complete collection, or as complete as possible. I'm still downloading and will seed to 20, and again as you update the collection. I took @theRealKarmine and limited the upload slots to 2, great tip. I'm on a 35/35mb connection and chugging along.

Thanks again, bro"
,darklotusegg,2011-04-21T17:53Z,"Thanks for the up but as others had said, this is a VERY SLOW torrent.

Hit and runners are ruining torrents"
,animirror,2011-04-24T11:33Z,Anyone interested in ddl mirrors instead?
,connorxkhaotic,2011-04-28T07:29Z,taking forever but when i get it ill seed to 10 thanks for the upload. ppl seed!!!
,vdutch,2011-05-29T07:48Z,"alright let me explain something to you people crying about something thats FREE. when you download something thats just a bunch of tv shows dont download tho whole fucking thing at once.
1. click download
2. bring up whatever program you use to download with
3. select what episodes you want to watch first and only download them
3.1 something like 10-20 is good or even just 1, its not like you going to watch more then 1 at a time
4. select a few more to download and repeat
5 when your not using the computer select everything to download or whatever however many you want

dont just blame people for not seeding shit when you can do you part and not be such a dick and be thankful that at least some people are

my dl speed is decent for 49 seeds and 218 leechers durring the day im dl'ing at about 490kbps and at night 175kbps, so durring the day its like 7min per episode. so lets do a little math to prove a point. if it takes me about 7min(thats probably longer then it really takes) to dl 1 episode and they are each 23min long then i can dl 3 episodes in the time it takes to watch one. fyi it took me 3 days to dl this, i was not dl'ing 24/7


to sum this up dl a few episodes watch those and dl more while watching the ones finished dl'ing, stop bitching, and learn that saying SEEEEEEEDDDDDD or something about seeding more is not going to make people seed. suggestions like theRealKarmine's are cool tho
"
,vdutch,2011-05-29T07:52Z,"oh yea thanks a lot of this, i dont like subs makes it harder to concentrate on wtf is going on and subs go to fast at times"
,4tunenoix,2011-06-16T13:26Z,"@vdutch 
haha, thought everybody would know you could do that by now... 

Also: Great torrent ;D i love it when they trow everything in 1 big torrent. makes it better for people to organize their episodes.

Downloading like 350kb/s atm at day. decent enough to get 1 episode in 10 minutes."
,vVPhaseVv,2011-06-17T05:27Z,"If you compare the subs to the subs on Netflix, the torrent subs are some complete crap. Even important things get jacked up. 
In the beginning title before the Bount arc: ""I wield my souls sword, and explode with resolve to save my friends""? Seriously? That barely makes sense?
That's not anywhere near what he says, comparing it to Netflix and Hulu. 
Yeah, I like pirating things, and getting them for free, but not if its just going to suck..."
,Arch4ng3l,2011-06-24T17:49Z,"Hello, just bleach related story advice, skip following episodes, they are just fillers (total shit episodes that have nothing to do with main story arc, so don't waste time downloading them):

,Poganin,2011-07-02T10:57Z,"It's a pity the fansub changes around episode 50. I've only watched until episode 63 now but from episode 50 onwards they don't translate proper names anymore and leave them in Japanese instead which for me breaks the immersion and leaves me lost because all of a sudden I don't know what's what and can only surmise. I liked ""Soul slayers"" better than ""Zanpakuto"" and so on."
,fusionman_3,2011-08-01T00:58Z,"ay guys can we please seed, im really getten into this show but im missing from episode 21 - 126...and im pretty sure if i just skipped all thouse episodes id be like ""w.t.f is happening"", atm im downloading at like 4.8 kb/s which is slow as dicks, it will take me 6 weeks to complete. comon guys lets seed the fuck otta this shit.
