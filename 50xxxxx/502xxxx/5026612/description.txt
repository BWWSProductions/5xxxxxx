Infinite Mass was the only Swedish hip-hop group that managed to break commercially with West Coast rap and G-funk. Their time in the spotlights in the mid-'90s was brief, but the work they and Latin Kings did in paving way for the wave of Swedish hip-hop in the late '90s should not be underestimated. Infinite Mass was formed in 1991 by Rodrigo Pencheff, Amir Chamdim, and Bechir Eklund, and soon swelled out to become a big collective of rappers, dancers, and musicians. Pencheff was also a member of Latin Kings and in 1992 the two groups participated in a rap contest where Latin Kings were discovered and offered their first record deal. Infinite Mass won the competition but the international contest that was to follow was canceled. The band was offered to record an EP as compensation and the result was Infinite Mass, released later the same year and sold by the band members themselves. At this time, Infinite Mass played political and angry music with clear influences from Public Enemy and NWA, as can be heard on the singles and EPs released the following two years, including "Shoot the Racist," which reached some fame through the action movie SÃ¶karna in 1993.
