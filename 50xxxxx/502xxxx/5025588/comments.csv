http://www.discogs.com/Various-The-New-Wave-Complex-Volume-17/release/1772660

Either way, see ya on the net somewhere, sometime, somehow mister 80zforever!

PS - The Effigies' ""Blue Funk"" is a great track."
[V],80zforever,2009-07-27T07:28Z,"JonYo, New Wave Complex 17 is actually a new compilation of 80s minimal/synth music and I have not got it yet. The original series ended at vol. 16. cheers"
,fanciz,2009-07-27T07:32Z,"Thanx 4 the upload. The Parachute Men was part of my Wish List on Amazon coz I like their song My Flamingo appearing in The Great Fire Of London.
In case U have something of Colenso Parade, I would appreciate if U could post it in Demonoid or in another life. LOL! Same with Under Two Flags. I have their songs Masks and Lest We Forget but I think they might have a few more songs. Thanx again for Ur great contribution!"
[V],80zforever,2009-07-27T08:03Z,"fanciz, I have 2 singles and one EP from Under Two Flags with these songs on:

The Day After Dub 
Masks
Early Sunday Morning 
Land Of The Rising Guns 
False History 
Lest We Forget 
Drown Inside 

If you have these then you have'em all. What a great band indeed.

From Colenso Parade, I think I have the Glentoran LP and a few singles. Gotta check that one out as I have not given it a spin for some time."
,fanciz,2009-07-27T08:15Z,"I don't go much to Church but next time that's the prayer I will say:

Our Father 80zforever, 
Who is in Heaven,
Holy is Your Name;
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done,
on Demonoid as it is on TPB.
Give us this Saturday our weekly 80?s music,
and forgive us our many requests,
as we forgive those who sin against good taste;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from Rap and R?n?B. Amen. "
,fanciz,2009-07-27T08:24Z,"80zforever

Abt Under Two Flags I have only Masks and Lest We Forget so I'm looking for the other songs. And then, I think there are different versions of the 2 songs cited above.
Abt Colenso Parade, I have only Fontana Eyes and that song is quite original so I'm looking for more stuff of the band.
Thanx "
,JonYo,2009-07-27T10:36Z,"Hey 80z,
I'm noticing that the folder named ""The Effigies - Fly On A Wire & Ink"" has all 11 tracks of the Fly On A Wire album, but only the first 3 of the 10 tracks of the Ink album.  Was it like a CD reissue of FoaW with 3 bonus tracks from Ink?  Or are some tracks just missing?"
,okbyethen,2009-07-27T17:50Z,Thank you 80's for all these wonderful bits of the past.  Can you please invite me to the Dmn site?  I could not bear to miss out on more!  my username AT email Dot com

can you reseed some of your earlier volumes of this collection - like the ones from 1-20

I mean not all at once but some of the ones you think you are best from the beginning? I missed them while they were more live."
