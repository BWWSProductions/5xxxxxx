To all my friends and downloaders, here's how we close the book on the pirate bay, but the phoenix will rise from its ashes, and that's certain. One thing I'd like to say is that I tried to turn this great file sharing tool to an obscure 80s music dictionary. I hope this will lead you to discovering more new "old" music and that new bands get inspiration from this awesome music. The music that belongs to the best decade of music ever, The 80's.
