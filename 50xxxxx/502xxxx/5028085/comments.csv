,EvilEyeUK,2009-07-28T16:31Z,"Triangle Woman takes you on a narrative odyssey of a series of ten short stories ranging from the grotesque, the weird, the perplexingly absurd, and the ridiculously silly. A bit of an odd character, Triangle Woman has kept these stories locked up in her head for many years. The film includes stories about a man whose finger rapidly deteriorates and the impending consequences; a nice lady who really isn't that nice; an old woman who talks backwards; an employment agency that has a man-toy named Mr. Brombellarella; among other stories. Triangle Woman is the thread that binds all of the stories together, and she imprints her bizarreness throughout the entire film."

Why are you telling someone not to post when it's a useful comment.

Go spend your time finding spammers instead not power-tripping on useful account holders.
