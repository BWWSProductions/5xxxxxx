,QuiapoPirate,2009-09-29T04:29Z,"@SeyR: to remove trial --
1. install the trial.exe file
2. run the .reg file (just double click and ok)
3. search for ""squeeze.exe"" in your program files folder of sorenson.. replace what you found with this .exe file

,vue02,2009-09-30T01:51Z,"I see why the .mov presets were missing
It's a bug in the latest version of quicktime player
So i installed an older version and all the presets are back

,jonabudi,2009-10-09T01:24Z,"Thanks for the upload sonic720. 

I'm having a preset problem. If I run it with the cracked .exe I only have .mp3, .mpg, .mov, and .mpg. If I run it as a trial, I have all available presets. I've also gone to Audience>Import and then to the default presets folder, but I get an error when trying to import. Anyone else come across this problem? Have a solution?"
