,danneman_77,2009-07-28T18:54Z,This is amazing! I used to own a CDTV back in the day. I'll be seeding this for a long time.
,Nekto2,2009-08-05T10:41Z,"Guys, you should download "".torrent"" from this site, and some of you should download _all_ files of this share, so number of seeds could rise. Now, I only the one seed, - it's bad, because if I'll go out, the share will stop showing or even may be deleted at some catalogues, plus some people will not try to download it, if they will see 0 seeds."
,nisse_123,2009-08-14T10:55Z,"This one is well seeded on Underground Gamer, where people just don't stop seeding because they got the collection.."
,Nekto2,2009-08-15T20:53Z,"nisse_123: originaly it is from Pleasuredome, where to rise a ratio is much easier. Quantity of seeds is low, but avaibility is comparable, and hence maybe speed."
