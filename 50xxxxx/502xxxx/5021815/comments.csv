You cant play this shit without a crack...NOOB!!!"
,Fox_Almighty,2009-07-26T17:19Z,"Listen here asshole... I didn't think it required the crack seeing as it was such an old game, I was originally going to add a nocd crack to the upload but for some reason the one I found disabled my audio, so I didn't want fruitcakes like you complaining for something that prevented other things from working.

So eat shit and die... Next time show a little appreciation for ppl like me who upload rare really hard to find stuff. I originally only uploaded this by request, I didn't think it would collect so many peers and seeds. One more thing, if you think I'm a newb, think again, I garantee my ratio at demonoid is a hell of a lot better then yours. users/turgsh01"

,p.pwrgy,2009-07-28T19:35Z,"Hi Thanks for sharing

,mikey1999,2009-07-28T22:17Z,can any one help me to get this working on vista?
,Fox_Almighty,2010-06-09T17:59Z,"The only thing I can suggest is right click / properties on the file, and set the compatibility to winXP sp2 mode, that might do the trick, if not, then everyone does their fair share of research when it comes to making games work on those new Windows, post the results if you come across any that work.

That conflict with the emulator, now that I think about it (months later, lol), it was probably due to the security checks features disabled in daemon tools, enable them and all should work like a charm, or just go with the nocd patch, whichever works."
