SPECIAL NOTE: To get updates from me on the capturing, editing, and compression process of the torrents, you can get more information by visiting a Twitter page I created at [url]http://twitter.com/TourTorrents[/url]. I've never used Twitter before, so I'll be learning as I go. I created this so that you will all have a good idea on when to expect the torrents in the coming weeks.

TORRENT NOTE: This video has been edited with no commercials and covers the entire race live, no highlights. Part 1 & Part 2 are separate files so that you can download Part 1 first to watch the race while you are downloading Part 2. All coverage is live and none of the race was removed during the commercial removal process. Enjoy.

Stage Profile: After the start of Stage 19 the Tour turns in the opposite direction of what is traditional for the race. Itâ€™s all for one specific reason, to bring the riders towards Mont Ventoux.  With only two days remaining the riders are used to heading north towards Paris but this flat stage will take them south to the town of Aubenas. 

Not since 1962 has the Tour started in Bourgoin-Jaillieu and the riders will have a complicated race in front of them. The stage is flat but it is one of the last chances for the stage hunters to take a prize. The race will be fast as riders try to escape while the sprinter teams will be thinking about trying for another bunch gallop. The G.C. riders will want nothing to do with racing today but they will have to pay attention that no dangerous riders escape up the road. This stage is almost an afterthought to those thinking of having yellow in Paris because of tomorrowâ€™s big finishing climb.

Bourgoin-Jallieu is home to over 70 cycling clubs and in celebration of the Tour de France they have multiple rides for the tourists and visitors to take part in. The Tour de France will depart from the Berjallienne site in the city and the race will take place in the heart of the Rhone-Alps region towards the finish in Aubenas.
