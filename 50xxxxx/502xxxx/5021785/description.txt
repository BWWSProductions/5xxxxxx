Starscream and BB, discuss their plot against the Maximals and Insectrons. Below, the Maximals discuss the newly found Insectrons: Mantis, Bigmos and Tonbot. Bighorn is quite enraged about the Insectrons and their attacks. While Bighorn, Diver, and Tasmania Kid wander off from the Maximal base to look for the Insectrons. 

Drill Nuts (a bole weavel) and Scissorboy (an earwig) arrive on the surface via an underground entrance. As Drill Nuts attempts to use a detection device, fellow Insectron Powerhug (a pill bug) rolls in. Drill Nuts, the tech-head of the Insectrons, continue to work on his device. The device detects Bighorn, Diver, and Kid approaching. As the Maximals approach, the two factions fight square off in character-appropriate fashions: Drill Nuts and Diver, both tech-heads, fight, as do Scissorboy and Kid and Powerhug and Bighorn. Starscream and BB watch from a nearby cliff. 

Will the Cybertrons and Insectron destroy each other, leaving the Destrons to take over the planet?
