,menuasha,2010-06-14T08:16Z,"Thank you for this, please seed!!!! I will continue to do so after it's done! "
,tgeer43,2010-11-28T02:18Z,"I really love this series and remember it from childhood. It's too bad that all of the complete sets are such monster size files. These films were shot on old B&W stock in the 40's with a monoaural soundtrack. Each ~27 minute episode fits nicely in under 70MB with acceptable size, frame rate, and audio using H264/Lame codec. So the entire series should fit in 1.8GB easily. Instead I see sets ranging from 5.8GB to 23.5GB! what - Blue-Ray 1080P from 1945?
Just too big for my puny connection. If I can ever get a good, complete set like this one, I'll chop it down to size while maintaining watchability. Thanks to the uploader, though."

,perfecto1,2011-10-03T23:16Z,"It'd be nice to have these WITHOUT being badly interlaced, it's very annoying.  As it is, it's not worth the download unless of course you don't mind badly interlaced video.  "
