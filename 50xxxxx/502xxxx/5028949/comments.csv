,irate976,2009-09-18T21:47Z,I'm wondering why I can't get anything to download from here anymore. I got maybe 4 movies then everrything just stopped connecting. As you can see my internet connection is fine. Everything says there are no sources??? What am I doing wrong? Hit me up at irate976@yahoo.com. Thanks Bricktop. I enjoy the movies that I'v gotten very much.
