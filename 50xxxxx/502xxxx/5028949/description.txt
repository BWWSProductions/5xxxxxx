The Jackal (1997)

Russian mobster Terek Murad has declared open season on the Russian militia 
and the FBI over the shooting of his brother in a Moscow nightclub. He hires
the Jackal, a nasty assassin whom nobody has even seen, to kill the Director
of the FBI. With nowhere else to turn (except a woman who used to work with
the Basque separatists, who is now in the USA but whose exact whereabouts in
unknown to all save Mulqueen), FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston (who was 
present at the Moscow shooting) and Major Valentina Koslova of the Russian milita 
(who pulled the trigger in that shooting) enlist the reluctant services of Declan 
Mulqueen, an imprisoned IRA sniper, to track the Jackal down, for Declan is 
the only other person who can positively identify the Jackal.
