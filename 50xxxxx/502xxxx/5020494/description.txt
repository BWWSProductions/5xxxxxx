Release Title: Echelon Conspiracy 2009 BRRip H264 5.1 ch-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)
Release Date: 24 July 2009
Release Length: 01:45:18
Storyline: Shane West (ER, ONCE AND AGAIN) stars in this technological thriller 
that was originally titled THE GIFT, a genre-less moniker that would have captured the young-male fantasy of the 
untold riches and limitless luxury dangled in front of our winsome hero in the films opening section, but says 
nothing of the Big-Brother-informed noir-mystery nightmare that follows. ECHELON CONSPIRACY is a much more suitable 
title (and not just because it makes mention of the international governments real-life information-tracking 
software system). Lightweight yet complexly conspiratorial, ECHELON takes inspiration from the vast array of 
paranoia thrillers of yesteryear, from the heaviness of THE PARALLAX VIEW (1974) to the fantastical 1980s-ness 
of WARGAMES and such '90s takes as THE NET and ENEMY OF STATE. While on a business trip in Russia, young computer 
technician Max Peterson (West) receives a high-tech cell phone in the mail that dispenses advice via anonymous 
text messages. After initially writing the phone off as a promotional gift from the hotel, Peterson is saved from 
boarding a doomed airplane thanks to the warnings of the inexplicably omniscient device, and so hes not entirely 
reluctant to try out its suggestions at a local casino. Naturally, this attracts the uneasy attentions of the 
casinos security chief (Ed Burns), a burly FBI agent (Ving Rhames), the head of the NSA (Martin Sheen), and a 
beautiful, mysterious woman. Soon enough, the phone starts making death threats to Peterson and a sniper appears 
on the roof across from his hotel room. Rather than the over-the-top action scenarios of EAGLE EYE, its closest 
contemporary, ECHELON CONSPIRACY grounds most of its tension in behind-closed-doors plausibility. And, in a movie 
released in 2009, the technology that introduces Peterson to a governmental techno-underbelly, rather than falling 
into the realm of utter science-fiction, is on par with viewers actual options in portable devices.
