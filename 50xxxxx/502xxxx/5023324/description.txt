BBC - The Real Room 101 (2003) HDTV [Orwell, Big Brother]



Directed by: Jonty Claypole
Starring: Michael Radford, John Hurt, Margaret Atwood, Michael Rosen, and D.J. Taylor.


Plot:

 	

This film is about Room 101 - the room itself, Orwell's influences in creating it (his school days, his time at the BBC, Soviet Russia and communism), the psychology of fear used in Room 101, and its impact on popular culture since its creation.

Orwell based Room 101 in part on his experiences of the BBC and the political vetting that used to go on in its conference room on the first floor. There is also a theory that the headmaster's study, in his old school St Cyprians (pictured), was a model for Room 101.

Artist Rachel Whiteread is filmed making a plastercast of the original Room 101, based in Broadcasting House. The room is facing demolition as part of building development.

Contributors to the film include Rachel Whiteread, film director Michael Radford (who directed the 1984 film version of the book), Terry Waite (discussing the power of the interrogation used in Room 101), John Hurt (who starred as Winston in Radford's film), David Taylor (author of an exciting new biography of Orwell), Tony Benn and Margaret Atwood.
