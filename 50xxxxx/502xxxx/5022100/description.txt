The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson - June 10, 2009

A Special Report from the Supreme Court by Tim Meadows (or is it Don Cheadle?)

Guests: the host of the political review show Hardball on MSNBC and author of The Hardball Handbook - How to Win at Life, journalist Chris Matthews (the only analyst who can explain the radio phenomenon that is Rush Limbaugh), and the jaw-droppingly talented one-woman band Theresa Andersson who plays the extraordinary piece Na Na Na from her CD Hummingbird, Go! (Love the daring of that dissonant violin passage near the end just before she ends the piece with the tonal note.)

Note
There is now a torrent for Theresa Andersson's album Hummingbird, Go!:

A public release of Jimmy Kimmel Live could not be found for this date.
