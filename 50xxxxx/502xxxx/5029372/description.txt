In the vein of traditional westerns such as 'High Noon,' comes 'Blue Eyes,' nickname of Johnny Rios, the most sadistic outlaw in south Texas. After being captured in a foiled bank robbery in the sleepy town of Wardlaw, the courageous Sheriff, Bob Gambol, awaits the vicious outlaw's family who has given him twenty-four hours to release their brother or else. Now it's good vs. evil as one man has to choose between honour and the annihilation of a town.
