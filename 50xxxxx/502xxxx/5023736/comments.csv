Btw, what happened to your Photoshop Plug-in Mega Pack upload? It has been removed from PB.
As you wrote, there were a lot of warnings from my antivirus. Is it safe to use those plug-ins?"

The thing is,as i mentioned there, that I personally unzipped all the rar's and avast found some FALSE-positives.As you know keygens have that.I wouldn't have been able to upload the files because avast wouldn't have let me,if there where ""virusus"".So for me to have them on my desktop and avast not being set off,well there where no virusus.AVG tends to see everything as a virus.Heck I even double clicked and opened every keygen before uploading it here.Anyway no more keygens...."
