Also, Austrian speech is in German subtitles so you have no idea what people are saying during these sections
Good movie, but not as good as Borat!"

,Cuntboy459,2009-07-27T16:21Z,"This was very watchable and the sound wasn't bad at all, as for the German parts... THATS THE POINT, Bruno is Austrian duuuuuuuh *makes downs syndrome style dribbling*

Anyway, for a handheld it's very good and saved me a trip to the cinema."
