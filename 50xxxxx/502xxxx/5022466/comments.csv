Everything you need to know here. And you cant use a 64bit operating system for flashing. Unless your real good. Use jungle flasher. it has a tutorial. and its the easiest for noobs.
Just answering the question before it comes up;)"

,capice2003,2009-09-27T07:48Z,Man I tried getting this torrent forever and when I finally wrote it to disk after a day or so of downloading it it didnt even work. The game wont even read it starts as if it would work but then it say the disk cant be read.
