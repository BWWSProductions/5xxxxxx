,rille2222,2009-07-31T15:06Z,How about seeding the last 0.1%?
,renivier,2009-09-20T12:51Z,"Please seed. 
I'll keep seeding myself when I get this."
,Blackoberst,2009-09-22T09:22Z,Dude... you're missing episode 26.
,hart37,2010-12-20T15:57Z,Seed guys. I've been downloading for 3 days and only have 3.08 gig yet I've already uploaded 6.3 gb. 
,DSXC,2011-02-14T07:40Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460627/episodes#season-4

Only 25 episodes in season 4.  Check before making comments like that."
,EmollGuitar,2011-02-20T15:05Z,Thank You Very Much!!!
,streetraceros,2011-03-01T00:25Z,"actually, balckoberst is right, there should be 26 episodes, on imdb there is 25 because first episode is made of 2 parts and they count that as one"
,okonomiyaki,2011-03-08T10:34Z,"It seems this REALLY IS missing an episode..
Even accounting for the first episode being a double-episode, it is still missing the last episode (26)..

Look at wikipedia: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bones_%28season_4%29

Wikipedia ALSO counts the first episode as two episodes, just like the torrent does, but wikipedia goes to 26, while this torrent only goes to 25.."
,tkm99,2011-03-19T18:08Z,Does anybody know which episode is missing? I'd hate to have to download them all individually and compare...
,ToxicInsanity,2011-04-13T20:36Z,"I just looked at the files...Look at the title of the first file ""Episode 01 02"", looks like the two episodes are in one file.  hence the ""missing"" file. also, the fact that it is exactly double every other episodes size kinda gives it away as well."
,napfeny,2011-04-22T16:01Z,"seed plx!!
T[]T
i just need this so much!!"
,thaibaco,2011-04-25T07:36Z,"THERE IS A MISSING EPISODE. STOP ARGUING.

The missing episode is the season finale. I can tell because I watched all 24 of the included files and none of them are the season finale, which is detailed below. Without this episode, the season 5 premiere makes little sense.

SPOILER ALERT
The season finale is a dream sequence that Booth goes through while in a coma. It is the 26th episode."
,Filmaniac,2011-06-11T15:37Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS! It's a waste of time: it's missing the last episode, ""The End in the Beginning"", which you can't find to be downloaded alone. Get the complete season from: http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/6245289/Bones_Season_4.6245289.TPB.torrent"
,Filmaniac,2011-06-11T19:27Z,"I was wrong before. U can download the missing episode, the season finale, from: http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/4895101/Bones_S04E26_HDTV_XviD-LOL_[eztv].4895101.TPB.torrent"
,renbay,2011-06-16T22:24Z,hay alguno con subtitulos en espaÂçòol???
