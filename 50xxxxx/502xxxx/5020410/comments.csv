,Morgarat,2011-05-04T00:01Z,"To all those that cant get this to work, try this:
1. Mount game using Daemon Tools or whatever it is that you use.
2. Extract the AWE.exe from the AWE.zip from the folder that this was downloaded in to anywhere that you can get to easly.
3. Move the AWE.exe that you placed somewhere into your Ancient Wars: Sparta folder.
Hope this helps some people!"
,Jbird242,2011-10-05T20:58Z,"i downloaded it and installed it fine, i even put the AWE into the same folder as the ISO but it says that it wont run an emulated copy, what do i do?"
,PragmaR,2012-04-11T02:15Z,"@ Jbird242:

I see it's been some time since you've gotten any help, but you place the exe file from the zip folder into the directory in which you installed the game -- not the iso folder. To sum it up, exe from the iso folder goes into the directory in which you installed the game. For someone using a 64-bit OS, it would be program files (x86)>PlayLogic. Good luck and don't forget to support the authors of the software (i.e. WorldForge) if they've done a good job with their work!"
