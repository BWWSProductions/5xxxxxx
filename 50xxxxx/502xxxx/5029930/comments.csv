I was looking for this movie for a long time.
When i finish the download i will tell tou about the quality of your torrent."
,Fendergirl,2009-08-02T21:20Z,Please help seeding to keep it alive ;) Thanks!!
,DavidGGG,2009-08-04T09:01Z,"Thanks! This one is impossible to find in proper quality. It's a full DVD (not a rip).

Yesterday here were 15 peers, but they all left soon after they got 100%. Sad to see.. I find you get much better seeding if you multitrack it with Demonoid and Mininova (Pirate Bay is kinda like the wild west). And if you want it to have eternal life, rip it into a smaller size and upload it at eMule."
,Fendergirl,2009-08-04T10:31Z,Thanks for tips :) Feedback is always welcome.
,noverime,2009-08-12T14:41Z,"Many thanks for your torrent.
Excellent picture and sound quality."
,OrpheusDude,2011-01-29T07:31Z,"Many thanks!  This is a VIDEO_TS file, so while its individual parts can be watched on VLC Media Player, it is best to just burn it direct to a blank DVD.  It includes the full menu, the film, the gorgeous music video of k.d. lang's ""Barefoot,"" and a 43-minuted interview with her.  There are no subtitles.  Since it's an exact duplicate of the DVD, the quality is as good as it gets.  I will keep seeding as long as there is interest.

P.S.  Curious Fact: It's the next-to-last film made by 1950s/1960s TV star Chuck Connors, best remembered for ""The Rifleman"" and Jason McCord in ""Branded"" (well-known to fans of ""The Big Lebowski"").  He died in 1992, a year after ""Salmonberries"" was released."
,OrpheusDude,2011-04-05T20:58Z,"Hey!  Fellow k.d. fans!  I have seeded ""Salmonberries"" since February, to a ratio of over 60.0 and will keep on going.

I just wanted to let you know that her next album, ""Sing It Loud,"" is scheduled for release in the USA on 12 April, and a bit later in Europe.

There is also a special edition available with additional tracks exclusively from k.d.'s official Web site:

If this torrent to ""Salmonberies"" ever dies out, leave a message here and I will make sure it is up and running at 100%. (I will check in at least once a week)."
,OrpheusDude,2011-04-09T23:36Z,"Fellow k.d. fans: the torrent for her new album (the extended 14 track version) is now up at TPB:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6301844/k.d._lang_and_the_Siss_Boom_Bang_-_Sing_It_Loud_%282011%29

This is a regular mp3 torrent.  There is also a torrent in FLAC format:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6302732/k.d._lang_and_the_Siss_Boom_Bang_-_Sing_It_Loud_%282011%29_FLAC

It's very low key compared to most of her earlier work, but still a stunning, gorgeous album."
,RexRexroth,2012-03-04T00:52Z,"I just wanted to say that I've now seeded well over 300 copies of SALMONBERRIES in the last year.  Due to some computer problems and work-related travel, I may have to sign off for a while, but I will always come back!  I hope you are all enjoying the film!"
,RexRexroth,2012-03-15T20:21Z,"I have seeded several hundred copies of ""Salmonberries"" in the past year.  I am having surgery next week and will be in hospital for at least a week and will have my laptop with me (but no Internet connection).  I will upload ""Salmonberries"" again as soon as I am home. Meanwhile: PLEASE KEEP THE TORRENT ALIVE!!!  If you download it, PLEASE seed to a ratio of AT LEAST 1:5 (at least until I get home).  Thanks, and all best!"
,RexRexroth,2012-05-03T06:37Z,"I've sort of adopted this torrent. Since the spring of 2011, I seeded over 500 copies of the torrent, 24/7, taking time off for only a brief vacation and short stay in hospital.  But I've been back for a month and everything was going as usual until tonight when BitTorrent suddenly told me that the files were incomplete and the torrent invalid (!).  So I've had to start from zero and am rebuilding the torrent.  There are only a few of you out there with 100% - I ask that you please help me get the active torrent back up to 100% and I will resume my 24/7 access to it.  Many thanks!"
