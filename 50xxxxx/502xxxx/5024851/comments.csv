Thank you."
,tribudi,2010-04-13T16:35Z,"thanks sheila...really great upload...but it would be better if there's an English subs.... I think I have to look in DVDR category....but i couldn't find it, so could you rip or put the subs or something like that? sorry if I comment not related with this torrent...I'm newbie here....but thank you anyway"
,monkybizzz,2010-05-07T02:25Z,"You can find subs for just about any show at TVsubtitles.net

I am not associated with this site, and there may be other sites just as good.

For season 1 of The Tudors: http://www.tvsubtitles.net/tvshow-76-1.html"
,monkybizzz,2010-05-07T02:47Z,"I should have said, I have found *English* subs for every show I looked for. They also have other languages, but possibly there are specialized sites that are better for other languages... They do have 12 languages for season 1 of this show, but no German, Romanian,  or Scandinavian languages."
,monkybizzz,2010-05-08T18:05Z,"The whole season of subs for this release can be downloaded (currently) at http://www.sub-titles.net/ppodnapisi/podnapis/i/270794/the-tudors-2007-subtitles

The release version that matches this one at tvsubtitles.net is ""DVD-WIDE"" - but full-season download is not currently working."
,tribudi,2010-05-31T14:54Z,"@monkybizzz
Thanks for the info. I've downloaded the sub from the web you suggested. Unfortunately, I've already converted them into DVD without any subs. Is there any possibilities to convert again and put the subs??? I'm using ConvertXtoDVD4, and it works for the other TV series like CSI: NY I've downloaded from TPB and all subs (I've downloaded from the web you suggested) and 99% match with the movie. Hope it'll work and match for the Tudors series."

,Regnaloube,2011-08-28T20:36Z,"Would anyone know why I do not get any sound when I convert the files into DVD format?  There is sound if I watch the files on MAC, but none when I make an image or burn them with Toast 11.  Thanks"
