Jeffrey Lynne (born 30 December 1947 in Shard End, Birmingham) is a two-time Ivor Novello Award recipient and Grammy Award-winning English songwriter, composer, arranger, singer, guitarist, and record producer who gained fame as the leader of Electric Light Orchestra and was a co-founder and member of The Traveling Wilburys. Lynne has produced recordings for artists such as The Beatles, Roy Orbison, Del Shannon and Tom Petty. He has co-written songs with Petty and also with George Harrison whose 1987 album Cloud Nine was co-produced by Lynne and Harrison. His compositions include "Evil Woman", "Telephone Line", "Livin' Thing", "Mr. Blue Sky", "Don't Bring Me Down" and "Sweet Talkin' Woman".
In 2008, The Washington Times named Lynne the fourth greatest record producer in music history.

Armchair Theatre is the first solo album by Jeff Lynne, released in 1990.
"Every little Thing" and "Lift Me Up" were released as singles. The album also features two classic cover versions "September Song" and "Stormy Weather" the latter recorded as a tribute to his late mother. The album re-united Lynne with Electric Light Orchestra's keyboard player Richard Tandy and fellow Traveling Wilburys member George Harrison. Despite positive reviews the album became only a minor hit.
