[T],zeromancer,2009-07-27T07:46Z,"Ron Burgundy: Boy, that escalated quickly... I mean, that really got out of hand fast. 
Champ Kind: It jumped up a notch. 
Ron Burgundy: It did, didn't it? 
Brick Tamland: Yeah, I stabbed a man in the heart. 
Ron Burgundy: I saw that. Brick killed a guy. Did you throw a trident? 
Brick Tamland: Yeah, there were horses, and a man on fire, and I killed a guy with a trident. 
Ron Burgundy: Brick, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. You should find yourself a safehouse or a relative close by. Lay low for a while, because you're probably wanted for murder.

[T],zeromancer,2009-07-28T04:18Z,you can use meGUI for that.
[T],zeromancer,2009-07-28T04:20Z,"just demux the file first, convert the audio track, then mux it.

aviMuxGUI and tsMuxGUI are recommended.

Depends on what types of files u have."

vista (should of at least used that years ago) and Win7 all use esclusively NTFS, as well you should of selected NTFS for your WinXP setup, it's faster and bigger files and much better."
