classic/horror/monster movie



Tremors is a 1990 dark comedy monster film about a group of people
from a small Nevada town fighting subterranean worm-creatures dubbed
"Graboids". It was directed by Ron Underwood, and stars Kevin Bacon,
Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross and Reba McEntire. The film's
exterior scenes were shot near Lone Pine, California, an area which has
long been used as a movie location.

The handymen team of Valentine McKee and Earl Bassett live in
Perfection, Nevada, a decaying ex-mining town with only 14 residents,
among them survivalist couple Burt and Heather Gummer and the
namesake owner of Walter Chang's General Store. A new arrival is
Rhonda LeBeck, a college student from Michigan State University who is
conducting seismology tests around the town; Earl unsuccessfully
promotes her as a possible girlfriend for Val.

Val and Earl tire of their hand-to-mouth existence and set out for Bixby,
the nearest "real" town. En route, they discover Edgar Deems, the town
drunk, dead at the top of an electrical tower with a loaded rifle clutched in
his hands. Puzzled, Earl and Val haul his body to Jim, the town doctor,
who announces that Deems died of dehydration. On their second try at
leaving, the duo come to the property of sheepherder "Old Fred" and find
that he and his flock have all been horribly butchered. Panicked, Val and
Earl race back to Perfection, now thinking that a murderer is on the loose.
They warn two road-construction workers they meet, but soon something
underground kills the workers and causes a landslide, blocking the only
road out of town.
