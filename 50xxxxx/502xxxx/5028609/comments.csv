Thanks a ton! :)"
,leniana,2009-12-29T22:46Z,"thank you a  lot, great torrent!!:)"
,ultr4violence,2010-02-01T13:03Z,Thank you very muchos!
,cartman19987,2010-08-12T17:47Z,"Thank you so much! This show has to be one of my favorites of all time.
Curse NBC for cancelling it WAY before its time."
,Thomps6o,2010-08-29T10:08Z,"awsome...i cant believe more people do not have this though, i figured if anyone was hanging on to a show for just archiving reasons...it would most def be this one.  well, at least thats what im doing, ive already seen it, i just want to make sure i have it if it dissapears. thx wiley!"
,meusa,2010-09-10T11:55Z,SEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDD 3 days 192mb downloaded wtf!!!
,cartman19987,2010-09-19T15:45Z,"@Thomps6o, that's what I'm doing too. I also have the DVD of this, and I've watched the deleted scenes and audio commentary on that. I just wanted as much of this brilliant show as I could. :)"
,Thomps6o,2010-11-19T05:34Z,glad to know someone agrees.
,cartman19987,2010-11-22T03:21Z,"Yep, and it was such a shame that this truly marvelous show was cancelled :("
,cartman19987,2011-04-22T21:59Z,"I'm still missing this show terribly :(
Also, calling this a mini-series implies a conclusion. Kings, however, was intended to be a full series with a series's ambitions. But, NBC in their infinite wisdom, decides to cancel Kings, yet let garbage like The Biggest Loser run for 10+ seasons. Long live Kings"
,chickoy3,2011-09-13T18:37Z,"one of the best tv shows i've ever seen. cancelled because USA is full of people who prefers to watch ""reality"" tv that is not realistic and american idol."
,cartman19987,2011-10-02T21:38Z,"@chickoy3, I'm American and trust me, I absolutely hate all that reality crap. Kings was truly a special thing that people, for some reason, weren't smart enough to catch on to."
,aiturn,2012-03-05T04:54Z,"Been looking for this for a while now. Have heard only great things, so thanks for seeding the entire thing! Much appreciated :)"
