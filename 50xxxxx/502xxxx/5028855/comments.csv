,tva1777,2010-04-17T01:06Z,warning??Trojan??
,swordofspirit3_16,2010-04-22T02:19Z,"This download is fucked up, I mounted on PowerISO like ur supposed to and installed it. Since the download only comes with 1 ISO containing the assumed multiple discs, the game does not load correctly and gives an error message saying insert the correct disc. What files do we need to comprise within an ISO to get the game to play? "
,VDRHTC,2010-04-28T15:26Z,"Google:

,BlackDiamondFox,2010-09-01T03:31Z,Can't find Registration Key.
,spiegelnder,2010-11-17T19:05Z,"It's 'amazing' that noone ever bothers to give any detailed instructions on how to install a downloaded game, as if it would cost them something! We are not all experienced in this,  you know.
Sometimes we get just some very brief and incoherent phrase and that's it, which naturally doesn't help at all. Additionally, we may even get some mocking by the various 'experts'. Jeez. 
(I have noticed this thing happening far too often,  that's why I wrote these words.)"
,spiegelnder,2010-11-17T19:46Z,"Well, some minutes later I managed to figure it out on my own after trying some things and here are instructions in detail for those who still have trouble:
After the download right-click and extract the compressed file. (WinRar will do)
Click the Setup file to install.
Afterwards, from the extracted files open the folder titled, ViTALiTY. Copy the two files found in it (hellgate_sp_dx9_x86  and  hellgate_sp_dx10_x86) and then go to the directory of the game in your Program Files, open a folder called, SP_x86, and paste the copied files there. It will say that they already exist but still click yes and replace them.
That's it. You can launch the game now. ;)"

,barda24,2011-02-13T02:06Z,"Descent game, I mean; it was fun until you reached level 30 or so, and that was because of the storyline, because long before that the levels becomes way to similar.
If your looking for an easy class to play, go with the Guardian, but I enjoyed playing the Marksman way more.
The last time I played the game, I got to around level 30 or 40 (cant remember), and then it got boring, so I never saw the conclusion of the story line, but I imagine that if they had cleaned up the levels and monsters so they didn't look so much alike, I imagine we could have seen titles like; Hellgate: New York, or Hellgate: Tokyo or whatever works.
I give this game: 5/10 simply because of the fun I had playing the Marksman."
,1111222233331234321,2011-03-07T06:11Z,what version is this?
,Mr.Wolfe,2011-05-15T09:44Z,"I thought I'd never get to play this game...

I have to much on my computer at the moment, but as soon as I clear up some space I'm going to download, install, and play this.

Thank you for the upload, Josvila."
,Mr.Wolfe,2011-05-17T09:29Z,"Thank you, spiegelnder, for explaining how to get it to work.

Unfortunately, after all that, Hellgate London still didn't want to work for me. I meet all the system requirements and have all the updates for Vista, but it thinks I don't have service pack 2."
,Kamianbu,2011-05-31T20:11Z,"@Spiegelnder

How to do the entire thing is pretty easy if you've done it before. If you're a newbie at this, then you download from the more popular scene release if you want instructions, noob.

The setup/cracking process is the same no matter what readme you look at, but if there isn't a crack folder in the iso, then use google to look for it."
,ayiezat,2011-06-10T01:24Z,"umm...I cant play the game...my screen just got blank and a window showed up with ""Uploading Error Report To Server""..."

,kobac005,2011-06-20T07:56Z,I HAVE A PROBLEM IT SAYS  ''PLEASE INSERT THE ORIGINAL HELLGAET LONDON'' CD/DVD I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO PLIS HELP
,Ic3b0x,2011-07-17T11:03Z,"WOW!! Is there only noobs on these torrent sites now lol, every other comment is someone who doesnt know what their doing.

If you dont know how to install a cracked game then you probably shouldnt be here d/lin em. Let alone bitching here in the comments for asking for someone to hold your hand.

Heres some hints, start with GOOGLE!!! google is your best friend, it may take some time to search through sites, but you can eventually find anything. Help yourself before asking for it.
and if you must ask, at least do so respectfully like a few did.

1. Download DaemonToolsLite
2. Mount Hellgate London [PCDVD][MULTi5][DVD9] By josvila.ISO to a virtual drive using Dtools.
3. Install game
4. Serial: N1XL-ETTE-YKWB-KSG7-ZTBW-5Z0E
5. Go to my computer open the drive with Hellgate London
6. Open ViTALiTY folder
7. Copy BOTH files in it (hellgate_sp_dx9_x86 hellgate_sp_dx10_x86)
8. Paste BOTH files in C:\Program Files\Flagship Studios\Hellgate London\SP_x86\
9. Say yes to overwrite old files
10. PLAY THE GAME AND ENJOY NOOBS!"
