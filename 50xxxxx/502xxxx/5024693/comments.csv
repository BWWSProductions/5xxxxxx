,iluvchem,2010-10-23T11:29Z,"hey cudnt get proper subs tht sync with this rip! nowhere on the net! not on subscene, opensubs, or other sites either :("
,vhdlrfn,2011-04-24T12:51Z,"This is 4:3 ratio, NOT 16:9. Good quality for standard definition TV, but it will be in pillar box on a wide screen."
,vivatpb5776,2011-07-22T20:24Z,For those that are looking for quality of substance..look elsewhere. The video quality is average at best and it's in FULL SCREEN (560*416).
