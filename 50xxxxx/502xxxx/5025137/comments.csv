[T],verifire,2009-07-27T12:21Z,"@""Maerlon"": Right back at you.. :-)

@""yemoller"", who wrote: ""HAHA, this is almost funny .. sadly people take this as a  documentary instead of comedy as it should :-P"".

It just never fails. Every time I upload something with the words ""Jesus"" or ""Bible"" or such in there, somebody has to post mindless proof of their ignorance and/or hatred almost immediately.

I sometimes wonder: How is it that people with their brains totally void of information and understanding of all matters not concerning how to get their own, empty lives and thoughts to look good, feel they have to comment on matters they don't know anything about? No, it's just a big laugh.. 

Well, I think the Joker laughs at you..

I hope the God of the Bible doesn't, but has mercy on you. We're all gonna need that mercy in the years to come.."

Christian theology is hate filled and paranoid and flawed to the core

[T],verifire,2009-07-28T14:11Z,"@""comandanteloof"": ""Paranoid conspiracy biblical mumbo-jumbo nonsense"" (?) and ""Christian theology is hate filled and paranoid and flawed to the core"" (??)

I'm not paranoid.
And if you'd actually seen this flick, you'd have PROOF that there's a conspiracy on, over your head and right in your eyes.
And the word Biblical is what really sets you off, isn't it? I just refer to my comment above this one.

It's possible you've heard so called ""Christians"" hurling their hate upon people and things, but I haven't as far as I know. I'd like nothing better for you than to be free and safe forever. But rules apply to that. As on earth, so in eternity..

But was Jesus a paranoid, hate filled, flawed person? Not the one I know..

Strange though, how Christian torrents cause such a commotion. Well, I'm not surprised, I've been around for a while, and I feel old..

BTW; I am downloading that torrent you recommend, but I read the comments on it, and besides hate against Christianity, and ""IndianChristian"" in particular, my eyes fell on this one from ""theshape31"":

""I don't believe in a God, Jesus, or The Bogyman. But this steaming pile got the most selfless 5 minutes I've ever given. This so-called 'Documentary' gives its opposition every reason to denounce its completely broken narrative, and lazily thrown-together arguments. This is Michael Moore storytelling at its worst. Don't. Waste. Your. Time.""

And that was presumably from an atheist.. Take a hint.. :-)"
,FrezingTurtle,2009-08-08T12:09Z,"This is madness... Truly madness!

Randomly selected historical pseudo facts presented along with ""profs"" that just are wild... 

Look at this one... 
The crescent moon looks like the horn on a bull. So all Muslims pray to a bull... This is Baal, or Satan.

I am not a Muslim, but even with my somewhat limited knowledge of history and religions I can see that this is assumption after assumption leading to a stupid result.

Even wilder is the accusation that Europe is supporting a war against Israel. This is a word by word quote: 

The European Union, following in the tradition of Hitler is one the greatest political and financial supporters of Arafat's Palestine war against the Jews.

The EU supports peace efforts and provide humanitarian aid to the Palestine population."
[T],verifire,2009-08-10T09:33Z,"@""FrezingTurtle"": I actually understand your skepticism I think, but you have not been diving deep enough into the mountains of evidence and actual proof from the people behind this so called ""humanitarian"" aid and such. They are building a national identity on both sides of every fence, by various efforts, and it looks good from the outside, but the ultimate goal is so well concealed and yet clearly revealed by the conspirators themselves, so you have to see through the smoke screens they put up all the time to conceal their true motives.

Try this one on for size:

http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm

With that said, I don't support all of the narrators thoughts in this upload, I think for instance he misses some of the bigger picture in narrowing in on Europe, but where should he begin? It could be anywhere, but this one's about Europa as part of the ongoing, occult and prophesied Globalism as ultimate goal.

I think he might be pentecostal, and I don't support any denomination but One True Church: Those who follow Jesus full time, are fully pledged disciples. And those are found here and there, and not confined in a set of rules set by any congregation, but by God Himself in their hearts and through the Bible. 

But the bottom line on this upload is that all too much of the facts he presents, CAN NOT BE REFUTED.

If you're looking for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, I must insist that you seek God the Father through Jesus the Son and His Words, so that you, in turn, are able to become a born again Christian, so that the Spirit of God can dwell in you and direct you and let you in on the whole Truth.

John 14:26)  ""But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. 
27)  ""Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid..""

Jesus said that.."
,Clairwil,2009-08-16T17:50Z,"Thank you, verifire, I'm a satanist myself and it's really hard to obtain serious documentarĂ­es about the subject."
[T],verifire,2009-08-16T19:22Z,"@ clairwil: I knew you were, as you might have guessed from the response I gave on your last comment. You'll regret your choice though..

Your ""clarwil(l) migh prove not to be so clear after all is said and done, and that is soon..

Turn over to Jesus everything, because Hell IS a bad place to be. Sorry someone has ruined you in such a way.. Really sad.."
,Clairwil,2009-09-01T12:45Z,"Thanks for the offer, verifire, but I prefer to worship his older brother. "
[T],verifire,2009-09-04T20:04Z,"He's actually not His brother at all. And most certainly not His older brother.. Phew, how you've been lied to.

Satan is an angel, one of many, but was a glorious sight and in a high position with God. He's called ""the seal on the well-ordered building"", but then he said in his heart: ""I will rise my throne above God's throne"".. God didn't like that, so... He became a ""fallen angel"" and also the leader of those who followed him in his rebellion..

And then Jesus and the Father agreed on providing the perfect plan to give man free will: Serve ""Lucifer"" or what ever you like to call him, or serve God, the Creator. He did that through coming to earth as the Son of Man, committing no sin, or trespass against God's will, and then, upon crucifixion, he triumphed over your master's will, perfectly.. Not even His murderers could get His love to fade.. ""Father, please forgive them, for they know not what they do..""

You've certainly been filled to the brim with ""truth"" about how it's all connected, but you've been lied to..

""His older brother.."" If it wasn't so tragic, I'd laugh, but there's not the hint of a smile in my heart or my face writing this, nothing. Except grief and sorrow on yours and your fellow believers behalf..

Life is a battle ground, we're all at present engaged in a war, but this much you know. What you don't know (yet) is who you're up against, and that you're serving a ""master"" who was defeated utterly about 2000 years ago..

That's the irony. You feel so high and powerful and free, but it's nothing but a feeling. The darkness doesn't put out the light; the light drives the darkness away..

And I will in the Name of Jesus, my Lord, bind the forces of evil that have you woven into their net of deceptions and double-sided ""truths"", until your mind IS clear, and you are able to make your choice, with a free will. You will feel very alone in the days to come..

May God Almighty shake your cage and force open the channels to your mind and spirit, and fill you to the brim with the pure existence of His everlasting and conquering love..

Dear clairwil. Turn. Find another name for yourself and to worship. In Jesus Name I pray. Amen. So it shall be written, so it will be done."
,fan666inhell,2009-11-05T17:17Z,"thanx! awesome upload as usual! 

everyone who wants to refute this film or any other information should check stuff out first hand, instead of regurgitating the propaganda taught in schools and by corporate media. 

and everyone who draws a conclusion about this film, based upon what another person writes, is plain stupid. 

do'nt let your fear or ignorance dictate what information you get and evaluate. educate yourself instead of dissing stuff you think you do'nt like. reject the norm if you wanna KNOW something."
[T],verifire,2009-11-28T12:14Z,Yeah..
[T],FaeGiN,2009-12-10T12:31Z,"This is unbelievably biased and amounts to little more than propaganda. Religious bullshit for gullible weak minded fools with no idea about finding out real truths and hard evidence.
FACTS are something that are very scant in this film.
AVOID this bullcrap!"
,sandshreder,2009-12-22T19:25Z,"Hey faeGin... or faggin or whatever you are... If you believe Christianity is untrue why are you constantly on here running from torrent to torrent blasting it as untrue... I would think if you really didnt believe in it you wouldnt wast your time criticizing it... Maybe like Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens you secretly do believe and you are angry about it. Angry you cant go on living a perverse life so you are out to convince yourself it isnt true. well keep trying to convince yourself... I will believe that you dont believe in Christ when you stop posting on Christian torrents.
in the mean time God Bless you"
,doubleusquebaugh,2009-12-24T09:39Z,"Thanks for the upload! I can't wait to see it.
Too bad some people don't respect someone who has a different view than they have.
But they're interested otherwise they wouldn't be here."
