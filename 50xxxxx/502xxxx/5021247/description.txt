Greetings again friends!

This relese must have been changed from where I downloaded it. (I really dont know why?)   But I have burned it, and watched it, so the quality is GREAT!

It seems that the source is from BluRay.720p.x264.DTS-WiKi, and customized by NITSUPORT (Thanks guys).

Once again I have not found a good SWESUB copy of WATCHMEN for DvDR / PAL, so this is why I upload this relese here and now...!      :)


The audio is English (Speech), and with Custom SWESUB. You can choose to watch it without subs as well.

And as always, I NEVER SAVE CRAP ON MY COMPUTER, so therefor also this is a good quality Sound and Video movie. The Swedish translation is super (undertexter.se?) so there is nothing to complain on.


Special thanks to: "WiKi" for the source
                   "Nitsuport" for the rip, strips, Swesub and the menu
                   "YellowHorse" for the bandwidth!
                   "The Pirate Bay" for your never-ending-piracy!

Take care, and I hope you enjoy this relese as much as I do!
