,feanor111,2009-07-29T15:25Z,nice idea .. bt if da server goes down .. da files cannot be hosted it wont work..
,wolfie22,2009-07-29T21:27Z,"It's a nice idea, but 1: yes, you would need a dedicated server to allow access, and process program, etc, etc. 2: you will need to be programming-savvy since you still need to integrate these files (as well as other work on coding, error checks, and so on).  Just plugging these into a HTML or similar web design program won't be enough.  Besides most other torrent sites are just as good at listing torrents.  The better challenge is to build/host a top-notch tracker to replace TPB's.  I'm no expert, but I think TPB's tracker may not be as accessible after the change to pay status."
,InfectedPirate,2009-08-13T19:16Z,"Try this one instead, it has more than 4 times the torrents and also a database with descriptions, etc.  Also, I wasn't as high as this guy when I put the package together *cough cough**thats some good shit!*
