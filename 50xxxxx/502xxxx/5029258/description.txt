This is a reply to a Darkside compilation, so whatever.

None of these are my releases. Some I ripped off (a streaming video site that is censored in TPB Comments)(HD), some I found on P2P.  Props to 2nafish, Regenzy, and Dinamovistu007 for their releases.


1. Alizee - J'en Ai Marre
2. Alizee - Moi...Lolita (Live in Taormina)
3. Enrique Iglesias - Dimelo
4. Jennifer Lopez - Get Right (Rap remix)
5. Mariah Carey - Don't Forget About Us
6. Paulina Rubio - Todo Mi Amor
7. Paulina Rubio - Y Yo Sigo Aqui
8. Rihanna - SOS (Rescue Me)
9. Rihanna - Unfaithful
10. Rihanna feat. David Bisbal - Hate That I Love You



Oh, and this is in "Other" because TPB won't let me put a torrent with the Demonoid.txt file in Videos.
