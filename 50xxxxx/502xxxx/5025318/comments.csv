,2dpostp,2009-07-27T02:58Z,it legit. i got it from the mac torrents site about an hour ago. it came down at aprox 500 kbs but just waiting on a serial. at least we have the install disc. contents is crap anyway. dvd sp 4 has no differences. but fcp 7 is well worth it. LEGIT but no serial.
,2dpostp,2009-07-27T03:19Z,any serials? only a matter of time but im so eager to upgrade fcp.
,andy72184,2009-07-27T10:45Z,"Thank you

Now we need serial"
,specialz,2009-07-27T12:12Z,It arrive this morning but waiting for the serial now I will go to the apple store today try to grab one
,2dpostp,2009-07-27T14:30Z,good idea. one of the computers might have it installed. its in the pro apps folder in the library
,spikeypineapple,2009-07-27T15:26Z,"Hey, sorry to be dim, but what does it mean ""without the content""?"
,2dpostp,2009-07-27T15:32Z,the contents is live types live fonts. motions footage librarys. sountracks samples and sfx and dvd studio pros templates. its the things you dont really need unless you you want drag and drop dvd menus etc. the sfx are actually good and motions library footage has some usefull things. but if you have the old studio package you can use that content. just be sure to untick the contents when installing otherwise it'll ask for those discs.
,spikeypineapple,2009-07-27T15:49Z,"oh ok thanks very much. I do not have a code, but am downloading, so presumably once i have it i have to wait for someone to post a code up?"
,specialz,2009-07-27T15:54Z,We all waiting for the damn serial lol I keep refraishing this page every 5 minutes just in case someone will post it
,2dpostp,2009-07-27T16:16Z,we're all so impatient. anyone got a local apple store. get on a system that has it installed. boot up safari. email yourself an email but attach the id file located in the library/app support/pro apps. id do it but have no apple store near by. it all sounds too easy. why do i hear the mission impossible music? lol
,tomh2o,2009-07-27T16:31Z,that would be funny if someone made a video with that music of them getting the file from apple or best buy
,2dpostp,2009-07-27T16:36Z,especially if if was edited in final cut 7
,specialz,2009-07-27T16:36Z,@2dpostp I think just the serial would do. I was suppose to go today to the apple store but I need to finish a XXX video first for my client fuck

Some applications may complain your hardware is not good enough to run them. Here's the solution: look for files named 'minsys.plist' inside package bundles (in Finder, right-click an app > Show Package Contents); delete them or edit in Property List Editor (block can be changed to warn)."

,Supa_K,2009-07-30T19:23Z,"Ok so I'm new to this

I'm at 60% right now, whats gonna happen once its finished and what do I need to do... 

My guess is that its gonna go into installer like most things and it'll ask for a serial number and I'll put in the one from another torrent I recieved and all is swell

What is this stuff people are saying about no content?????"
,Free-ak,2009-07-30T19:28Z,@Supa_K Yes when you download just open the disk image and enter the serial. HOWEVER! This torrent has no content. content is the stuff that makes up the other 6 disks of the final cut studio package. this means that all the programs will run but there will be no sound files or motion presets that would usually be there. BECAUSE of this you'll have to uncheck anything extra in the install dialog except the main apps (eg motion content) or else you will get an error on install. EVERYTHING STILL RUNS NORMALLY THO. hope this helped clear things up.
,Supa_K,2009-07-30T19:58Z,"Awsome thanks, and I'm using utorrent to dl but its super slow do you think it would go faster if i went to somthing like transmission?"
,Free-ak,2009-07-30T21:28Z,@Supa_K IDK I am using Vuze right now as it has a feature to help with rogers traffic shaping. I have also used transmission. As a comparison I have 32 peers on my current torrent and i'm getting from 120-220 KB/S
,Supa_K,2009-07-31T00:12Z,"at about 80% i got the installer thing come up and when i clicked it it said something about not being mountable, why did this happen at only 80% of the download?"
,Free-ak,2009-07-31T00:35Z,@Supa_K It will only work once you are 100% done the torrent
,Free-ak,2009-07-31T00:36Z,so any more luck on finding the content disks? I still haven't found any
,Free-ak,2009-07-31T00:45Z,ok so I found all the content cds! I don't know if they all work but 3-7 I got at iso hunter and number 2 I got at demonoid.
,parkk,2009-07-31T01:34Z,"Its nice to see this torrent, but what exactly does ""without the content"" mean ?"
,Free-ak,2009-07-31T01:55Z,"@parkk content is what makes up the large part of final cut studio. It is miscellaneous files (audio, motion effects, dvd preset menus) that add to the usage of final cut studio. The files however are HUGE so most of the time people just upload the apps. all the apps will work without the content. You can find the content disks from other torrents (check demonoid and iso hunter)"
,Free-ak,2009-07-31T03:05Z,to anyone wondering. here is a picture of the settings I used to install FCS3 WITHOUT THE CONTENT. http://img.skitch.com/20090731-ee4ymcg5gkdafgists14y91dj7.jpg

8: Enjoy


Ideally you want to already have Studio 2 content installed. Obviously if you do, you don't have to do the downloading the Motion disc, you can just follow the instructions for as if you have final cut studio 1 installed, and stick with the motion content from studio 2.

On a side note just incase it's helpful to someone out there, I had a few probs getting this going on my (vanilla) Hackintosh. It was telling me that I needed more vram (i have 2000 =P) so would quit the installer saying that my system was not meeting min specs. So...


To bypass Final Cut Studio 3 requirements test during installation.

1: On the FCS3 installation image navigate to 'Install Final Cut Studio' package, right-click and choose Show Original
2: A new Finder window should open with FinalCutStudio.mpkg hi-lighted. Right-click and choose Show Package Contents
3: Inside FinalCutStudio.mpkg, navigate to Contents/Resources/Requirements Checker.app, right-click it and choose Show Package Contents
4: Inside Requirements Checker.app, navigate to Contents/Resources and open file minsys.plist for editing
5: Replace all ""block"" with ""warn"" and save file.


Works a charm now! 

I had the full studio 2 already, so have got content and it's all great.

To clarify - Final Cut Pro 7, Motion 4, Soundtrack Pro 3, Color 1.5, Compressor 3.5, and DVD Studio Pro 4 ALL WORK GREAT WITH THIS TORRENT!

,tirza,2009-10-04T17:17Z,"can somebody please explain to me what is the diff with the other torrent that has 44gig size?

will i get Motion 4, Soundtrack Pro 3, DVD Studio Pro 4, Color 1.5 etcs with this torrent? or i need to download the 44gigs torrent to get them? thanks"
,pv-provo,2009-10-15T20:03Z,"gfotty - that is a problem probably with your system. Check specs and see what other programs are running at the same time.

tirza - yes you will get all of the programs with this torrent, working, complete and all a-ok. What you don't get is all of the extra content for the programs. Eg, you will have DVD Studio Pro, but none of the templates for making DVDs. for the sake of 44gigs tho, i'm not sure if it's worth it - thats up to you. For now tho, d/l this and get going - can always get the content at a later date."
,dcsimpson,2009-10-23T06:19Z,I just updated FCS 3 or the Pro App update I should say (should not have done that) and now my serial doesn't work.  Does anyone have a working serial as of 10/23/09?

,Castortroy2008,2009-12-04T02:31Z,"gfooty, I had the same problem- FCP is looking for  Ethernet connection 'en0'. When the program doesn't find it becuase it has a different name (liek en2 or whatever) it will crash the program.. You must go to network in the system preferences and erase the current network connection (select it and then use the minus sign to get rid of it. Then reboot and it will be fixed. This drove me crazy too. 

If you need further clarification just let me know."
