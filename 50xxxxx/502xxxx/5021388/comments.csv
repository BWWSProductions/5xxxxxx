,Screamn4444,2010-06-09T02:11Z,"Thanks for the rip its good quality, but why did you rip it in m4a????  If i want to play it on any sort of music player other than my computer i either have to burn like 30 cds or convert it to mp3. Also like the previous poster said, an m3u file would be very much appreciated or at least name the tracks in order.

Anyway, thanks again."
