,nick2124,2009-09-06T02:55Z,"Doesn't work =(

Upon reaching 100%, I extracted the files as it says in the readme (I used winrar) 

I open the folder, and try to run MAE.exe, the screen turns black (as though the game is opening) then it closes and says 'error report-game.exe' - I have the latest directx/drivers, why is this happening?"
,Pir42,2010-01-06T22:29Z,"Works great.
You can mod the game and add lots of new super heroes. Check marvelmods.com"

[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2010-05-14T03:09Z,theres fuck all wrong with this i will reseed it i notice that some of you are gettin errors extracting sounds to me like you need to extract archive from root of hard drive if u try to extract the archive inside a folder then inside another and so on you will be creating paths that windows cannot read if you dont understand me then buy the game simples
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2010-05-14T03:12Z,and all of you using winzip uninstsll it its crap use 7zip or winrar and stick to root of your hard drive  to extract

,rendellboy94,2011-05-11T15:25Z,it works for me...but i need to extract it everytime i play it... =( is there a way that I could play it immediately without waiting for several minutes of extracting???pls help.....
,kurtblue04,2011-07-17T07:14Z,"The Game works perfectly , and for those having character rendering problem just follow the tip given by @pelezim... thanks dude ... your a life saver

@ rendellboy94.. i don't think you have to extract it every time.. just use 7z and right click extract file.. and run the game through game.exe or mua.exe

Now i have this problem, in the first mission when you are completing the objective :

5. Protect the heli carrier engine from the Masters of Evil.

and you defeat the Weatherman and Radioactive duo, a cut scene should appear, where Nick Fury activates some elevator, but it doesn't for me, so I'm totally stuck. I really want to continue this gave, but i cant move on past that part no matter what i do, so if any one can provide me with a Save Slot, after defeating them on the next S.H.I.E.L.D point, please please please... I'll be really greatful... Thanks "
