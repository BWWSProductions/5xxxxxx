A: 10"
,jragnar,2009-07-29T19:31Z,Do anyone know where to find english or nordic subtitles?
,doctorrob,2009-07-30T00:42Z,"Is this the film with the dinosaurs? The one starring that Will Ferry from the TV? My grandson wanted me to get it for him, I think this is the right one."
,equazcion,2009-07-30T01:53Z,"V:8
A:9

Video brightness needs to be adjusted down, but otherwise this seems like DVD-rip quality."
,deepblue_mag,2009-07-30T04:34Z,What a piece of shit!!!
,equazcion,2009-07-30T07:51Z,"This movie sucks, by the way. The quality of this upload is great, but the movie is just not worth watching. It's a direct-to-DVD, ridiculously low-budget ""film"", and the CGI dinosaurs look like cartoons. Really, save your bandwidth. If you have any intelligence at all, you will not get through the first 15 minutes."
,rob29evansville,2009-07-30T07:53Z,Its free. I think u r the piece of shit for complaining. Your so stupid Deep blue only way you can raise your Iq is to stand on a chair. Thanks for the Upload AiTB
,deepblue_mag,2009-07-30T11:33Z,"@rob29evansville
Sorry, but you're wrong, only someone with the IQ of a chair would think this is a good movie. Free is not a mark of quality. Besides, I do not know what your problem is, am I not allowed to have an opinion about the movie in your world? Chill out man! You live longer!"
,Nicothelion,2009-07-30T14:47Z,"First of all thanks for the upload AiTB. Hope you dont take offence but I have to say what I think of this movie.

IT SUCKS!!! This movie blows so hard it gives movie that blow a bad name. I dont know whether to laugh or cry. Its redicolous!"
,sweetp46ddd,2009-07-30T15:08Z,could someone please send me an invite to demonoid ?..sweetp731@yahoo.com..I'll show you my tits..! 46ddd
,donki,2009-07-30T16:07Z,"Reminds me of my youth. Nice remake but somehow even though the original is kind of corny now, it still seems more endearing. Many thanx for uploading this. My kidz loved it.

I have a tall chair. Does that mean my IQ will be much higher if I stand on it? :)"
,juanpedro021,2009-07-30T17:05Z,LOL guys.. any nudity in it that could be why some like it... but with the internet being invented to give us porn I doubt it very much.
,necrocide,2009-07-30T17:32Z,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
If we're going to whinge about something then how about these asshole fucking spammers like this prick above"
,necrocide,2009-07-30T17:34Z,ha ha 'was' yay admin
,lazyKazy,2009-07-30T19:42Z,"man, I can read comments on pirat bay all day long!! Its better than soaps!! Its fucking silly to argue about if somebody likes a film or not for fuck sake"
,Shynobi,2009-07-30T20:26Z,"Why are idiots commenting on the quality? It's a DVDRip from AiTB, out of curiousity, what exactly were you expecting? tards. But no, the movie is not phenomenal. Thanks 4 the up!"
,kalleballe123,2009-07-30T22:35Z,"Taken from imdb from a comment by equazcion:
""The CGI dinosaurs are laughable; they all look like cartoon cut-outs, which is unforgivable considering the current state of CGI technology.""

I looked around 20 mins, then I jumped to a scene with the T rex, and from what I saw of my 20 minutes, The above comment is entirely true.
Good quality though."
,acer99,2009-07-31T02:12Z,"A/10
V/10
My Movie Rating (Good for a Laugh) *****

Thank You Very Much Keep Up The Great Work Plz! ;~)"
,Gr4ntS,2009-07-31T12:38Z,"Well, I cant say it was a crap movie, but personally the only thing that kept me watching it was the women. 6/10.

V: 9
A: 9"
,sconsrelli,2009-07-31T18:46Z,"I can watch this movie for free, in high quality by downloading this torrent and receiving packets from my peers, wheee! Thats why we come to tpb yay."
,jumala1976,2009-07-31T22:20Z,Yes this movie it is so shitty that i donÂ´t really have words for it. Jurassic Park is made 1993 and the special effects in this poop is 10 times worse than JP and the actors should suck cocks in porn movies instead.
,jetreschau1,2009-08-02T00:24Z,Thomas LOOKS like a METH addick!!!  WHoa!!!
,old_gregg,2009-08-02T07:23Z,"Speaking of subs, I'm not a noob, but I've never used subs that are included in some torrents.

How does one go about adding them so when a file is converted to a DVD the subs show up when they are supposed to?

thx"
,Pottfrillan,2009-08-04T18:53Z,"rofl Shynobi, you think everyone knows who AiTB is? Good commenting movies for those who are new to this. Tard Shynobi suck my big salty mofo diiiekk will ya? :S"
,harigata,2009-09-03T00:20Z,"Good ripping quality.
But then again, why rip this piece of shit?
It's not just the minimal budget (hence the T-Rex that looks like it's made of paper). The story stinks, makes no sense, leaves you disgusted with your self for watching it all to the bitter end. The cheapest, most ridiculous piece of crap I've ever seen on screen. Makes ""Delicate Sound of Thunder"" look kinda OK....."
,weasel5i2,2009-11-01T19:24Z,"It's a movie produced by The Asylum. They do spoofs on blockbuster films, most (if not all) of which suck horribly badly. Low-budget goodness.
