" One day, in a fishermen and hunters's community, as poor and as timeless it can be, nature decides to show it's macabre side. From the mangrove swamp, where they get the wretched sustenance, Cannibal zombies emerge. Nobody knows the cause of this â€œcontaminationâ€. The important thing is to run and survive, to run again. With every bite, parents, friends and brothers, become awful creatures.

In front of a horror that doesn't move back, not even with the daylight, that doesn't exempt fish or crustaceans, an obstinate and fearful survivor is revealed, skillful with the axe and terrible when the moment comes to declare to the brunet who makes his heart beat."
