The folder you get is fully portable, so you can put it on a stick if you want to.

Note: Using old mac files in windows can be messy.
Make sure to binhex (.hqx) your files on a mac before moving them to a
windows computer, or else your files will be as dead as your
great great great grandpa probably is.
Instructions are inside the Tools folder on the disk image.
