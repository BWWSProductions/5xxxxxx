Well u'll still need a oem key. but at least now you have loader which emulates slic 2.1 + certificate
when keys are leaked you'll only have to open cmd and write slmgr -ipk XXXX-xxxx.... and windows is done
Although me (teh l33t uploader) recommends a modded bios you cand probably live happy with a loader too
