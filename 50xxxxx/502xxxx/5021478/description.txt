Peace .. :o) .. Salaam

My enlightenment is largely a result 
of my trying to fathom the truths 
that don Juan Matus and his friends 
struggled to impart to 
Taisha Abelar, 
Carlos Castaneda, 
Florinda Donner, 
and Armando Torres.

Abelar's, Castaneda's, Donner's, and Torres' 
17 books are not a clear guide; ..

.. yet, the books do contain more clues 
than I have yet been able to assimilate 
into my life.

Don Juan and his friends had the keys 
to do anything and everything 
that is humanly possible.

These keys are revealed through 
these books, articles, etc. ..

.. I feel the need to 'see' 
between the lines.

"The movement of the assemblage point 
of a sufficient number of warriors 
can change the modality of the time, 
and that is what I am working towards."
  -by Armando Torres.. 
     from "Encounters With The Nagual".
