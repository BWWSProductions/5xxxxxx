Very nice irish like music, with nice quick fiddle, flute and accordion parts. They also use piano, guitar, mandoline, bodhran etc. You also hear nice footwork, like irish dancing. The difference is that the acadian do it sitting down on a chair, because in old days they were not allowed to dance, the church leaders said so....And not to forget two twinsisters singing beautiful in french. What makes it very special. I'ts magic, listening to this you can't sit without moving!

This is their 2nd album, personally i like the first one more, but this is also very good!
