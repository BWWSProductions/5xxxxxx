In his quest for a magic treasure, Conan must do battle with wizards, warriors, and great beasts, as well as cross a mystical desert. Schwarzenegger is back as Conan in this sequel to the action fantasy "Conan the Barbarian." This time the fearless warrior embarks on an epic quest for a magical jewel. Along the way he must protect a virgin princess who is about to sacrificed by an evil queen, vanquish a hideous monster known as Dagoth, and fend off the queen's henchman (as embodied by Wilt Chamberlain). Real-life Amazon Grace Jones also makes an appearance as Conan's feisty female sidekick.
