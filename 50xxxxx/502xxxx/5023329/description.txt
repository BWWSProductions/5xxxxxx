This is a working package for installing Macdrive 8

Macdrive 8 does not have keygen yet so you have to follow these instructions



1. Install the older version, MacDrive 7

This is included in the package!



2. use keygen to install it (read carefully the instructions for the keygen!)

Keygen is included in the package!




3. save the file "license" in "C:UserApplication DataMediafourLM{****}md7" to another place

The folders can be different - try your way trough, or use Search



4. Uninstall MD7 and install MD8

5. Move the file "license" you copied earlier to "C:UserApplication DataMediafourLM{****}md8" and overwrite

6. Now restart and then use the keygen from v7.0 to register as usual
