,mrpras,2009-07-27T16:34Z,"@Skogenskonge666

Depends what OS you are using

in vista it's Users->etc
in xp it's Documents and Settings-> etc

Just search the drive for Mediafour and you'll find a couple of folders, one is the program files and the other the data files.

Hope that helps"

You are the follest assholes !!!"
,ism3c,2009-08-01T18:09Z,"Lol, get the 7.0 installer running under ""Comp ability Mode"" tab, in the .exe properties. After you do the hack, the License file will be under C:\ProgramData in windows 7.

,greglon,2009-08-02T14:52Z,"Win 7 users note:

The Programdata folder may well be hidden.  You have to unhide hidden folders (Google for the various ways to do this uin Win 7) then you will see it.  Licence is in one of the folders within that folder.  It works for me on Win 7 RTM 64bit"
,ism3c,2009-08-04T15:07Z,I've discovered you can use the old keygen on the new version. But you have to test a couple keys. Just choose the activation by phone option.
,richrard,2009-08-04T20:01Z,"thank you so much! its perfect!

i was actually considered doing this before i came across this torrent, but figured that they were too smart to make it that easy. guess i was wrong :)"

I did a search on AVG and found five virus and removed them all and reboot and add and remove programs populated again. Anything to do with Macdriver which I like i had to remove. So for the people that did get it to work, I wonder why? non of my business, I did open a read me text and it said buy it! from the person who sent it out I guess, maybe people get a kick out of this stuff? I don't get it, yes I tried to get something for nothing and I paid the price, I hope it didn't spread into my external drives which are non windows, I guess not? I uninstalled them  before doing the virus scan. In any case I hope that those people who put virus out there don't get the virus in their souls and dis ease called cancer from hurting other people.

,Lynkin,2009-10-04T03:18Z,"100% working fine !!! Windows 7 Ultimate release candidate

any help ?

just unhide system folders and the PROGRAMDATA will appear !! then do the steps in torrent !
"
,daytonatrbo,2009-10-20T01:07Z,"once you have the MD7 license file, save it to your desktop or somewhere else handy.  Then just start the install of MD8.  You will have to reboot during this. Resume install. When done simply copy MD7 lic to same directory for MD8 and reboot.  No further patch required...."
,daytonatrbo,2009-10-20T02:26Z,"Win7 x64 and Vista64 users!!  MD7 will fail to install, when the pop up pops up to tell you that click ""install using the recommended settings"".  IT WILL INSTALL in compatibility mode!!!

then follow previous posts' advice!"
,montypi,2009-10-20T08:55Z,"Follow the instructions and it'll work perfectly. However, after what seems to be approximately half a year, it'll request activation again. I am currently re-installing to see whether it works again afterwards."
,montypi,2009-10-21T12:22Z,"Ok, re-installing works fine.

After about half a year, Macdrive wanted me to activate again. Didn't accept the keygen generated serials, so did this:

Uninstall MacDrive 8
Reboot
Install MacDrive 7
Reboot
Activate MacDrive 7
Copy license file
Install MacDrive 8
Replace license file
Reboot
Activate MacDrive 8 with MacDrive 7 keygen
...
...
Profit!


Everything works 100%"
,packhater,2009-10-26T19:38Z,"Windows 7 - You only need the keygen from this torrent - NOT the install files

You can download them from Mediafour!   :)

1 - install mac drive 7 - download from http://download.mediafour.com/macdrive7

set it to vista sp2 compatibility and run as admin!!!!!!!!!!!!
    If you don't do this, it will not run on Windows 7!

2 - delete the reg entries for macdrive in \\hklm\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

3 - stop the mac drive service

4 - run the mac drive activation and choose I have a sn and ready to activate

5 - choose I don't have internet access -
    Use that info in the keygen to get your computer ID and activation number

6 - copy the license file somewhere as a backup. Goto C:\ProgramData\Mediafour\LM\blah blah\md7  

7 - install 8.0.4.10 - download from http://download.mediafour.com/macdrive/

8 - stop the macdrive service

run activation and you'll notice its already activated

9 - reboot"
,packhater,2009-10-26T19:38Z,"Just to be clear....You DON'T need to reboot.

:)"
,Mimimae,2009-11-05T18:06Z,"There is a bit to be wished about the instruction manual here, I agree. Especially when the flaw it is about the crucial part of the cracking. However, the people who wrote it must have been working on Mac computers all their life. That leaves a trace ;)

On my computer the path for the license file was:

C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Mediafour\LM\{B6916668-60EA-4EE6-AC3E-DA8989868EC0}\md7

I doubt somebody others license file will help you, because license is generated with the Computer ID. 

Otherwise as packhater rightfully says you do not need anything from here except the keygen for v7. Everything else can be downloaded from the manufacturers site

mac drive 7 ? download from http://download.mediafour.com/macdrive7
mac drive 8 ? download from http://download.mediafour.com/macdrive/


Hope this helps

,attitudefan,2009-12-01T15:58Z,Dun download this . I detected 2 trojan horse. Can anyone clarify this?
,jrdaigle1000,2009-12-05T05:15Z,"Okay now. Time to clarify some stuff.
A. No viruses. Most AV's tend to report false positives on keygens. Scanned with MSE, and it's just fine. MSE tends to not give false positives on keygens.
B. I can't believe nobody noticed this, but the MD7 keygen works for MD8. At least I think it does. I followed the directions up until it talked about installing MD8. I rebooted and it complained about being a trial. Ran the keygen again and put it in. Just fine. I'd most likely say to skip all this installing MD7 stuff and just go straight for installing MD8 and using the keygen. Haven't fully tested it, but it should actually work. Please report back with your findings."
,attitudefan,2009-12-05T10:48Z,so its safe to use it? After installing it can i delete the key gen?
,soselo,2009-12-10T23:55Z,"zeromancer.................
is there anything that does formating for mac?
coz my mac partition is passwordprotected and doesnot let me to fresh copy of os x on it, even i borrowed osx from my mate. i thought i could attack from windows 7 side.
prss and hold C doesnt work either,
please help"

well whatdya know....he was right....after racking my head over this for a few days...

i decided to try it out....and guess what hold down the make key for a while....seems a little older key does work on MD8...so gr8...the keygen works even for 8...try it out guys

thx penna _ha"
,cclloyd,2009-12-21T22:30Z,"Safe to use for anyone wondering.  Worked on Windows 7 x64, and with my 10.6.2 on PC from my torrent.

,richrard,2010-02-11T13:52Z,"I didn't activate Macdrive 7, just grabbed the license file. I did this when the Win7 beta was first out, so I remembered that you don't need to. Just grab the file, uninstall, install 8, replace file, run md7 keygen to activate. I found this post on a forum before and was glad today to see a pack torrent of everything needed, as I am resurrecting the ol' hackint0sh :)

Only one extra step though, not a big deal."
,franglais,2010-02-21T12:19Z,"Alright, this worked for me running Win7 final Ultimate, x64.
I did as packhater posted, but after step 5 I rebooted, cause I was prompted to do so. 
Then after step 7, I had to reboot again.
Packhater didn't say what to do with MD7, so I never uninstalled it. 
Upon restarting, and restarting again, I moved the license of MD7 that I had copied to a safe place earlier, as instructed. 
I was still told, upon starting up MD8, that it needed to be activated, so
I went to the final step, step 6 of Penna_ha's instructions in his upload post. 
I didn't need to reboot, just plugged in an hfs disk in my usb slot, and am copying shit over to my Dell as I type.
Thanks!"

,ewwwww,2010-05-01T12:36Z,"""Threat Win32:Malware-gen""

Avast! antivirus software alerted me for the file contained in this torrent called ""keygen.exe"" when I scanned tonight. I JUST partitioned with Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro yesterday and one of the first things I download after uTorrent was this MacDrive torrent. I have never been a PC user in my entire life as I've been an Apple user for more than a decade so I don't know how program keygens work but if a kid can create a keygen like provided in this torrent with Malware inside than imagine what else has Malware. Beware people, I am not saying do not use this App. All I am saying is use antivirus software people.

Also, I followed the process. It worked on Windows 7 64x. Went from MacDrive version 7 to version 8. I needed to restart my computer within the next couple of hours so I did, tried to view my Mac side in Windows and it said MacDrive was no longer activated. In fact, it was giving me the option to activate it after it already had said it was activated before restarting. Keep in mind, I DID copy and paste the license file and it did work. Upon restart, it was no longer working. So sorry to write up so much on that but, if someone has an reasoning for this, I'd like to hear it. Thanks."

working keygen, just copy/paste serial number into the activation blank, click ""other activation options"" select ""offline activation"" then copy the computer id code from the activation window, paste it into the key generator in the appropriate ""computer id"" blank, then click activate, and copy the newly generated code in the bottom box into the empty box in the activation window.
