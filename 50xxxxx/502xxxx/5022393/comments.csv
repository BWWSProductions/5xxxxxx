,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-11-23T09:38Z,"works pefectly. super easy to install... although i have admit, even tho the game is pointless, and boring, and retarded... i can't pull myself away from it.

perhaps i need a life. :("
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-11-24T05:38Z,"alright, i wanted to update the game to 1.7... so i uninstalled, reinstalled and before installing the crack(and bypassing the patch included), i updated from the EA download manager and it went very smoothly.

or so i thought... for some reason now i cant open the game at all. if i try to open from the ts3.exe file it does nothing... if i try the sim3launcher, it just says it ""...has stopped working and needs to close.""

is it because i updated from the site? anyone have this problem and know an easier work around than reinstalling the game all over again?"
,breatheback,2009-11-24T16:06Z,"have a problem! i have installed the game and all, but when im going to do the copying crack-step, it says that sims3 dont have enough memorie!? needs 15 mb or something just to copy it into gamebin:(!"

thats about it, thats all i did an it worked perfectly. the only file u need from this torrent is the game itself, don't bother with the other stuff. hope it works."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-11-27T19:34Z,"oops one misprint, the first patch updates from v1.0.631, not v1.0.632(whatever version installs from the torrent) to v1.2.7.

i think the patch that's included in the game updated to the 1.0.632 version... if u did install that patch by accident it's alright, just follow the instructions for the first patch, it tells you how to update from 1.0.632."
,romanlol,2009-11-27T23:37Z,this game is in english or in french ? where can i found the french version ? thanks

,Sandrene,2009-11-28T19:18Z,Question: Can this game be updated? and can the expansion be added on? if so please share.
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-11-29T01:52Z,"@ Sandrene: r u serious? can u not even scroll up 2 inches and see my huge post about updating this game to 1.7.9? O_o

@ pistol-mike: ya see, i tried that... updating straight to 1.7.9 from this torrents version and i got errors, and it fucked up my game. i think i tried like 3 times. perhaps i wasn't using the right patches i dunno... but if u follow my steps above it will update your game with absolutely no problems and it only takes about 5 minutes."
,Sandrene,2009-11-29T02:51Z,"yes i saw what you wrote evilcorporatewhore but what pistol-mike wrote was contradictory. so i still asked. have you played with the expansion? and did you detect any viruses?

,wayne1000,2009-11-29T04:25Z,"@evilcorporatewhore

and can people please seed? The ratio of seeders to leechers is terrible."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-11-29T04:57Z,"@ Sandrene: they should, i mean are u talkin bout expansions like ""world adventures' and stuff? i know that there are a few like that on tpb that specifically mention they work with this torrent. whether u have to install them before the update patches, after or whatever that i'm not sure.

i don't play The Sims 3 that much after getting it to work finally, lol, i find the game rather dumb and pointless. but i'm sure if u read through the comments on this page(or whatever expansion ur tryin to add) u will find ur answer:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5166218/The.Sims.3.World.Adventures-RELOADED.iso

@ wayne1000: the patches themselves install in seconds. i 'spose actually downloading them may take longer, but the largest file is the 1.6.6 one i believe but its only like 200mb. it really shouldn't take that long to get them all... depending on ur computer."

with MagicISO, u can just extract directly to your computer like you would a .rar file. all i do, it go into your desktop(or anywhere u wish), create a folder, then open the .iso, or image file with MagicISO and choose extract. then locate the folder and bam you're done. it ALSO does burning and mounting fairly easily too. hope that helps.

just search and get the free version, it says u cant SAVE files greater than 300mb, but, to be honest, i'm not sure what that even means because i have used it to extract files that were 15gb, and burned files that were over 4gb... so just give it a shot."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-11-29T20:00Z,"@ pistol-mike: erm, ok cool... but with my update method i don't think u have to do any of that region stuff. just d/l the torrent, install the game, install the patches, and play the game.


btw, one thing i did forget to add was using the keygen included in the torrent. i've re-installed this game like 5 times trying to figure out the patches, and the keygen has produced a working key every time. so just use the one included in this torrent. i don't understand why ppl are posting keys or even looking for them. to use it, just open it when the game asks for the key... it will put it in automatically."

Ok, so anyone that is having a problem with the update not being able to update and then just exiting out, here's your Solution, 100% Working.

- The_Sims_3-Razor1911
- The.Sims.3.Update.1.6.6-BAT
- The.Sims.3.World.Adventures-RELOADED
- The.Sims.3.Update.v1.7.9 (Didn't Need it.)

1.) Install the Razor1911 release but don't crack it.
2.) Install the Sims3_1.6.6.002002_from_1.0.631.00002.exe 
file from the BAT release but don't crack it.
Here : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5168758/The.Sims.3.Update.1.6.6-BAT

3.) Install the World Adventures expansion but don't crack it.
(It Worked This Time, 100%)

Didn't need the 1.7.9 Thing, After I installed the World Adventures, I Double Clicked The Sims 3 on my desktop, and It WORKED 100%, NO FUCKING BULLSHIT...

No Cracking, No 1.7.9, I Installed Razor1911, Used the nicely made Graphical Keygen, entered the key, and Finished installing His Copy.

Then... I went to the URL above, for the Sims3_1.6.6.002002_from_1.0.631.00002.exe, installed that, then I installed the fucking World Adventures, 

Guess What... NO PROBLEMS, it didn't show me the fucking stupid ((Error with The Sims 3 update. Setup is unable to continue)).

Then... lmao, here's the go-getter... After I installed the World Adventures, I double clicked The Sims 3 ICON on my desktop, IT WORKS.

Hey RAZOR, FUCK YOU. lol. 

But thank God I'm 1337 too, and thanx for Forums online, THEY HELPED, BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T.

Why Didn't you, or why don't you tell people that your shit needs to be updated or what-not?  Why did you make me go online and find out how to get World Adventures to work, ...

Welp I got it too work, don't need to click on World Adventures to play world adventrues, I clicked on TS3 and when it was loading it says Wold Adventures when it's loading... IDK, If I have any more comments or words of wisdom I'll be sure to come back and POST EM HERE.

The Names ""Ace"" Bitches, for anyone that wants to know, and I'm far from a noob.

Peace out. I'll go ahead now and do what I usually do now, and sit back and Chill, and I'd advise you wanna be 1337 people to do the same. I'm out.

so just install all the patches in sequence.. don't worry about any other file till the LAST patch... and that's when u add the crack. then start the game from the TS3.exe file in the Sims 3 game folder.


@ 29385729-Unknown (aka-ACE): WTF are u on about you dumb n00b fuck? there was NOTHING wrong with Razors torrent. it's not updated to 1.7.9 NO, but he never said it was. and it STILL plays perfectly fine. the ONLY reason you need to update is to add mods or expansions. but unless you're some fag TOOL like you, you should already KNOW that. clearly you did not. lol

btw, you wouldn't be playin ur lil faggy world adventures game if it wasn't for Razor... i think a little courtesy for all the ppl that provide us with these torrents isn't too much to ask. why do they have to baby step fags like you through the process of updating, why the FUCK does Razor or anyone care if you wanna update?

now sit the fuck down and STFU... you're about as elite as the shit i took this morning. also, i used Razors keygen about 5 times for this game... it worked EVERYTIME... why should he, or anyone care that you're too dumb to figure anything out on your own?"

***Finalizing Your New Game****
***The Sims 3 & World Adventures***

01. After you do everything that I told you in the previous post... do the following to, because if you don't a couple days latter, when I choose to load up the game, the Game Started, but It told me that the game Disk was needed, I said FUCK THAT.


02. Making sure you Copy and paste the Original TS3.exe @ C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin\TS3.exe

03. Now, From the Razor1911 Downloaded Content, in the Folder Called Crack, Copy and paste the TS3.exe to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin. 

((Because that's all I needed to do, not the TSLHost.dll, IDK why I just didn't. It worked, and this time it didn't ask for the stupid CD when I loaded the game and after the intro played...))

03. Making sure you copy and paste the original TS3EP01.exe @ C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 World Adventures\Game\Bin\TS3EP01.exe

04. Now From the Downloaded Content from World Adventures RELOADED : Virtually Mount the ISO Image, and Choose Explore. Now goto the folder called crack, copy and paste TSLHost.dll AND TS3EP01.exe to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 World Adventures\Game\Bin\

05. Start the Sims 3, NOT SIMS 3 WA. Volla, It doesn't ask for the CD.


Thanx Ace, Man your awesome... lol

There, I've Debunked the entire process, and Simplified it as best as I could.

That's why I'm called Ace, If something is too hard, I make it so it's not too hard, I make it so that a person that might not be too smart could understand it, because after all, we all were not so smart or not so 1337 at one time. I'm Ace, and I'm one of the best understanding Pirates, 1337, hackers, or whatever, Internet Rat. lol, or Nerd. lol, I'm a Nerd, but I'm not weak, far from it. I got that equal balance type shit. The right mix if you will. I'm Very Observant and I have plenty of time on my hands.

And I don't like Hot heads like Girl_Crush, she can eat a dick. Midas well be a female with a name like that. Sounds like shes pussy whipped. lol. Girl_Crush, LMAO...

Hey Girl Crush, Don't Fuck with people who have nick names like Ace and user names with numbers and the word Unknown... stupid fool.

I didn't slap Razor in the Face, but his shit could have been better. Last time I uploaded a game, as soon as you got it to your PC, you could play it right then and there.

I know my shit, but I too ain't perfect.

I'm glad I could help, @wayne1000.

@cehrah, Yes Do Bother w/Wold Adventures.

Because if you don't then I guess your not totally 1337, and you midas well not play the damn game, World Adventures go Side by Side with The Sims 3, Don't get me wrong, The Sims 3 is really cool and all, but we are always striving to be better. Just having the Sims 3 is Cool, but getting World Adventures too, is Complete. If you have but just The Sims 3, then you only have Half the Game.

IDK, cehrah, I have about 300+ GB Left on my 1TB External Hard Drive, I'm sure it wouldn't really phase my 1TB hard drive for an additional 5 to 10 GB of used space, then I'd still have over 300+ GB... lol.

Shit External Hard Drives nowadays are getting so damn cheap, it's unreal.

I remember when a Hitachi 1TB External Hard Drive was like $300+. Now you can get like 2TB for like $199, and 1TB for like $99 or $129.99

Plus if you don't have shitty Verizon, your speed is decent. I HATE VERIZON. Money Hungry Sons of Bitches, Monopolizing Cum Guzzling SOB's.

I double-clicked on the TS3.exe in the Game\Bin folder but nothing loaded up, so I tried double-clicking TS3P001.exe(something like that) in the World Adventures\Game\Bin folder. The game loaded up, but there was a message saying that they couldnt find the CD. What do I have to mount so that I can play the game? Thanks alot to anyone who can answer this!"

But I've got a little problem. When I play the sims and I want to set the time faster. It just goes a tiny little bit faster. For playing the game this is very annoying.

Fucking Looser.

baby step fags like me...? through the process?

Hey Evil Wanna Be Looser, why don't you try installing the fucking WA, retard, and see if it works for you, you Ignorant SOB.

Wow, ... , you're about as elite as the shit i took this morning... Sounds like you got that line from the shit you took too. lol, your lame. Get over it, lets face it, your totally not leet.


Elite (occasionally spelled ?lite) is taken originally from the Latin, eligere, ""to elect"". In sociology as in general usage, the elite is a relatively small dominant group within a large society, having a privileged status perceived as being envied by others of a lower line of order.

Now you shut the fuck up, and let the big boys do what we do best, and enjoy the free content.

Leet, also known as eleet or leetspeak, is an alternative alphabet for the English language that is used primarily on the Internet. It uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latinate letters. For example, leet spellings of the word leet include 1337 and l33t; eleet may be spelled 31337 or 3l33t.

What's that EvilEmpireWhore, I didn't catch that.

Sounds like you need to go to bed to get up early tomorrow to catch the school bus.

,SDMorris,2009-12-04T05:48Z,"Ok, I need help. I had a MAJOR fuck up. I installed the game, played it, worked fine. 

THEN, I tried to install the Expansion pack. For some odd reason when the expansion pack tried to install and update, the update would fail and It would cancel the install. So, I tried to uninstall the Sims from my computer and re-install, but this time installing the expansion before copying the crack.

So, when I went to uninstall, I copied the cracked .EXE and TSLHost.dll  so I would have them for the next install onto my desktop. When I tried to uninstall the game, I got this REALLY weird error and windows explorer would quit running and cancel my uninstall. 

Desperate, I just deleted the ""C:\Progam files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3"" File completely from my computer and tried to re-install. Then it told me The Sims 3 was still on my computer. 

So, I used Registry Mechanic 09 and cleaned my registry of several sims 3 related errors and made sure NOTHING other than my TPB download with the word ""Sims"" in it exsisted on my computer.

BUT STILL, when I try to install the game it tells me a newer version of the game is installed and I need to uninstall it first. I don't know where it still sees the game, and im stuck. Am I screwed and do I have to re-install windows to get rid of the Sims 3 magically exsisting somewhere on my computer now? Thanks."

It lags probably because the content that Razor1911 gave is isn't 100%

Oh yeah, and the reason why you need to create a shortcut from the TS3.exe is because Razors shit isn't 100%, I can launch my game from the launcher now, Thanx Ace.

Been there, done that, ... Playing Nice and Smooth now.

Not Bombing on you Razor, but everyone can be a little better at what they like to do, and I do try to be better at what I do, and what I do is similar to others, ... I just so happen to have more time on my hands, and ect.

I love Repeating myself EvilCorporateWhore, when I know it needs to be repeated or that I see it really needs to be repeated.

It gets things right, and straight.

If you don't like repeating shit, how come you repeated the entire process again, like I'm about to do...?

Razor does not have anything to do with the WA_Reloaded, dumb ass...

As a matter of a fact, it causes problems, or there is a problem between the two of em, if there wasn't I don't think I'd be on here trying to help. Which is why I'm here, talking and texting on this torrent.


G, I wonder why she doesn't want to play the games you get off TPB... maybe it's because your shit is faulty.  I know, been there done that, and now my Friends, or whatever LOVES playing the games I get off here.  Because I work hard at solving problems, and I GET IT RIGHT.  So unlike you, when I do get a good house wife game or whatever, after shes all done playing the new games or watching the new movies I get, I GET SOME, lol, and you, IDK. Because you choose to not like people like me, and not fight to get shit the way it should be, ... Straight.

I'm playing the Sims 3 and World Adventures, pretty cool game...

Getting a little boaring now, it was more fun, despite how hard it was to get the sims 3 ""&"" WA to work... and believe me, it was very anoying to hear, 

"" Error with The Sims 3 Update. Setup Is Unable to Continue "" And then I press OK, and MOTHER FUCKER !!!!!!! It just exits, lol, It's really not funny... WHAT A BITCH... and here when I think that EvilCorporateWhore is a really big bitch, I correct myself, and say, No Ace, the problem that I had when I got the game and WA and tried installing WA when I had Razors content and installed his game, and then tried to install WA and got the fucking error, 

"" Error with The Sims 3 Update. Setup Is Unable to Continue "" .... You honestly don't wanna know how fucking pissed I got, I fucking got up and started punching the CRT screen and Boy O Boy, ... Then I went TO MY FRIEND, GOOGLE, and searched for help, and long and behold, there were people out there that were having the SAME GOD DAMN PROBLEM, YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT CoOpWhore...

Oh yeah, no dis on you too much RELOADED, LOVED SPORE. Worked 100%.

04. Copy Crack, from Razor1911, TS3.exe to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin\

05. Copy Crack from inside RELOADED, TS3EP01.exe & TSLHost.dll to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 World Adventures\Game\Bin\

06. Double Click on Sims3Launcher.exe and Click the fucking Play Button it WORKS 100%.

I just went into C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin\Sims3Launcher.exe, 

it works 100%, NO FUCKING BULLSHIT, I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE GIVE WRONG INFORMATION,

I had the same problem SDMorris, not because I'm a noob, but because I knew and was told to replace the original TS3.Exe and TLHost.exe into the Bin, ... I WAS LAZY.

Windows Can't Uninstall the game if theres Alien files in place of where there should be original files, It's not a bad thing, you needed or need the New NO-CD Patch Files to Run a game without a CD, this is common knowledge to people like us...

I was thinking that maybe since 64-bit based systems have two program files folders (x86 and the regular ""Program files"" one) that maybe it had stuff in different spots on the registry. So, I started going into other areas and looking. 

So I went into the ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER"" folder and found the ""electronic arts"" folder I had been looking for before. There WAS a Sims 3 folder in there, so I deleted it. Although, there was no other seperate sims folder. So I started searching through ALL my registry to find ANYTHING sims related I could, and did find a few more things, and deleted them.

Now  I cannot find anything else, yet the problem persists. I cant figure out how to get to the ""Tools>Folder Options>View>Show Hidden Files and Folders"" for Windows 7, because there is no ""tools"" option.

been reading through the comments and i must say you are probably the epitome of ""internet tough guy"". if you want the god's honest truth, you sound like a 12 year old, and an immature one at that. i'm not sure if you are 12 or not, but that's what you sound like. the people bashing you are right, all i have seen you do is paste stuff from other people in other forums. then you turn around and act like you created the Sims game yourself. rofl. yes, i am exaggerating to prove a point. i'm not sure if you even are aware at how stupid you sound.

thank god for people like HaraldM and EvilCorporateWhore and others who just help everyone and leave out all the utter bullshit about how great they THINK they are. it only serves to reveal how utterly useless you must be in reality. ""a lot of time on your hands"" yes, that is obvious. i think we are all well aware that no one in their right mind would want to be friends with a self-righteous dipshit. and you've helped no one apart from your own alter egos."

And I suppose we can take out the macho, seeing as you are being out-witted ultimately out-worded by virtually everyone here.

,lerchos2,2009-12-09T22:02Z,"Hello dear users. I have recently noticed that most of you, if not all of you have found the function of SEEDING a torrent, but setting you upload to 0 (effectively disconnecting you from the DHT or Peertrade also seems to be popular) to somehow steer clear of the ever so powerful MPAA/FBI/IFPI (at least that is my assumtion, since TPB is working awfully slow ever since the trial against the crew) Let me lay down some ground rules for all of you who are sheepishly afraid of ""da man"" or being sued or in general seem to suffer from paranoid delusions about the governments effort to stop YOU. 

1. NO, the goverment dont spend $$$ on sitting in front of Utorrent harvesting IPs from the log, its inaccurate and worthless. This theory can now be diminshed once and for all

2. NO, the government will not SUE in EVERY DAMN SILLY CASE the MPAA files againts single individuals. The amounts of cases may be staggering, but if we would all be that dangerous, we would already be in jail. And NO, nobody is currently behind the wall, building a case against all of us..there is no conspiracy, only paranoid people who spend to little time in the sun. 

3. There are no FBI/MPAA/IFPi honeypot torrents out there, building a case this way is entrapment and illegal in most countries outside of the USA, and when you do a cross section of people who use a torrent, you might as well paste the UN flag all over it. Even if theyd have honeypots to collect you IPS, filing and suing against you would take many many years..so please stop haggering about ""oh this must be a honeypot..everyone stop your upload..""

4. Okay,  now im going to stop for a while to simply say this. There is NO way you can DOWNLOAD from ThePirateBay, Demonoid, whatever WITHOUT being visible. Whatever douchebag that got this around, or whatever ?expert? said it I don?t care. He or she is propably the one from MPAA, trying to make you look stupid. There is a large difference between Utorrent and lets say Kazaa. Kazaa uses a ?reflection? of you harddrive, to download (copy in webspace) stuff from you to  others and vice versa (by hashing and numbering mirror files). I remember the myth that said that you apparently could acess someones entire system IN REAL time because IT HAD CONTACT WTH YOUR HARDDRIVE. I think ive heard som many bad myths about the internet and how fucking dangerous it seems to be. Yes its technically true that someone can do this..but why, and how would they ever find such a stupid idea compelling enough to try..P2P is safe, more safe than keeping hard copies inside your home..so stop worrying..and start UPLOADING. 

5. There is NO excuse to say..have a 10MBIT /10 MBIT and set you upload to 2 MBIT something..set it to MAX output or fuck off.

6. I know that since all this hi fidelity psycho-paranoid crap about that ?theyre watching man, they are..dude? most of you people who cant even unrar a single damn file, let alone use the simplest of inctruction to install say a RELOADED release probably act out like weed-crack-meth smoking hippies alone in your computer room, thinking that the man will run into your house the next minute cause you used the pirate bay..but let me say..smoke all the weed you want..or crack or whatever but RELAX..NO ONE is going to come to your door. It is SAFE to upload, and not doing so is more of a favour to MPAA/IFPI/all other evil companies than anything else.

7. Im sorry if I sound pissed off, but I have 50/50 MBIT Bahnhof optical fiber installed and I know that this must be hard on you people, but I would like to GET SOME JUICE. It doesn?t matter whether your upload is 1 or 10, strangling your upload or not seeding at all will lead to shitty speeds for EVERYONE, especially people with high speed connections, who instead get to feed your leeching with their bandwidth. Ive seen several IPs download from me in 4-5MBIT /Mb/s) and I get to sit and watch download speeds of lets say 20 kb/s. That?s not fair?

So here it is..in short

1. Nobody is watching us..if they do, let them..they cant hurt you.
2. Not using your upload is inexcusab"

help pls"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-12-09T23:15Z,"@ papasmurf6464: i said you only need to install the game itself FROM this torrent. install the entire game, it will install to it's own folder in your program files directory. therefore, what i meant is that you do NOT need the patch or crack from this torrent if you're using the patches i posted.

when you install the LAST patch(1.7.9), then you take the crack from that rar and place it into the game folder(the one located in program files directory). it will overwrite the existing file. then play the game FROM the TS3 file.

""...but shitty winrar wont let me move the crack from the last update"" ..that's odd, how are you trying to move it? just right click it, choose 'CUT' or 'COPY' then paste it in the Game/Bin folder.


@ lavenderabc124: use the keygen included in the torrent. just open it up when the game asks you for the key. ALL the keys i've used from that keygen have been successful.

@ Foxx64: *applauds*

@ samoframbow: that's odd, i've not come across that problem. so you've installed WA? did u apply any cracks BEFORE installing WA? if so try re-installing THEN applying the crack. or use one of the methods either with the individual patches i posted to 1.7.9 or the method HaroldM posted that patches right to 1.6.6, (DON'T CRACK)... then try installing this: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5166218/The.Sims.3.World.Adventures-RELOADED.iso

...THEN try applying the crack. not sure if that will help, but its worth a shot.

@ Arghh: did you install a crack BEFORE patching? you will get errors if you do. patch THEN crack.

@ skullo: seems like your comp can't handle the game itself.

@ yoxx: have you installed any mods at all? in my short experience, i've noticed that some mods will just cripple the game upon load up. otherwise i suggest un-installing everything then re-install a fresh one.

@ jordanm0611: thanks! a repost was in need i believe. the reason i posted the individual patches up to 1.7.9 is because i've tried several direct patched to either 1.6.6 or 1.7.9 and they all failed or had errors. not sure if that one posted was one of them, but if its working for some people then great. btw, Jordanm... u Haroldm's cousin? bad joke. :P

@ ecctv: why wasn't the error in english? are you sure you're following instruction properly? install the game form this torrent, do NOT patch, do NOT crack.. then use either the individual patches i posted or the direct patch Haroldm posted. THEN try installing WA, there's a torrent of WA on this site, THEN try cracking.

lemme know if that helps."

@ rwbk: sounds like you didn't crack it, if you're getting that error. or if you did crack it, you're not loading the game from the crack itself, you need to load the game from the TS3.exe file. i actually can load the game from the original game app, but i recommend using the TS3. if you did crack properly, and are loading the game from the TS3, then uninstall, reinstall, patch, then crack again.

@ kicker4life: it works 100%. if you don't care about mods or expansions, just follow install direction within torrent. if you do care about mods and expansions, then use one of the patch methods posted in the comments.

@ xRnEx: mounting is one option, i think that's mostly if you're going to burn to cd/dvd. mounting an image, like an iso file. but, you don't necessarily have to do this. you can extract the contents of an image file like any other rar or zip using tools like MagicISO.

I'd really appreciate it."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2009-12-14T18:29Z,"All i can say to the ppl that are getting the 'insert cd' issue is to patch BEFORE you crack. whether you're using the patch within the torrent, or updating the game with other patches(that can be found posted by several ppl in several methods within the comments). also, the keygen provided in this torrent was, in my experience, working 100% when i installed this game.

@ -Mekova-: no i don't think it does. but, there are patches you can get to update the game, last i checked it can be updated to 1.7.9, maybe even higher now i don't know. you can also install expansions on top of the patches BEFORE cracking and you should be fine.



if ppl would just read through all the comments(i know it can be a pain, but better than waiting for a response that may, or may not, help you) then you'd save yourself a lot of time. just sayin."

download a program called little snitch, not sure if you're on pc or mac. when that program is running it tells you what programs are trying to access the internet and you can confirm or deny this connection, hit deny any connection forever

to anyone else: after a full install and putting the cracks where they need to be, the .exe patch doesn't have a place on my mac. wondering how to get around this.

,edge9999,2009-12-15T09:58Z,I am a bit confused with the updating. Is the update provided in the torrent the most recent one? (1.7). It doesn't let me update using the game launcher so i tried searching online for the 1.7 update. I ended up finding one but when i updated it tells me that I have an error with the region. So if this is the most recent update then disregard this but if it isn't how can I get it to work?

I tried everything and lost hope and uninstalled the game. but i really want The sims 3 
Can u please explain to me in a simple way how to install the game?  

Btw i live in sweden if that makes any changes for the installing

but anyways, thanks for posting the direct links, those appear to be the same patches that i posted, exact same update versions anyway - but they def needed to be re-posted so thanks. also, that's a great site you've found... Spore i actually like, but haven't played it in ages, i'm going to check out that site and see if my game needs any updating. ^^

here's the link if anyone wants to check it out(highly recommended), and thanks again Plakkie:

http://www.simprograms.com/the-sims-3-patches/patches-the-sims-3/

@ edge9999: it's been stated about a hundred times in the comments(which nobody bothers to read), install the game in the torrent(it's the first step in the installation instructions), but, do NOT patch or crack, instead, use the patches(plakkie posted some great links u can use), THEN use the crack.

@ thag13: yeah i don't think many ppl had difficulty with that.. but you won't be able to use any mods or expansions without the patches... which it was most ppl are having trouble with."

,Bellanza,2009-12-17T10:23Z,"Hey.

Okay, so I've read through the comments and this still hasn't become clear to me. I downloaded this torrent plus the patches that were at the link that EvilCorporateWhore provided (thanks, by the way :) ), but no matter whether I follow the instructions word for word, patch BEFORE cracking, patch using Extremezone's patch that came with the torrent or by using the ones at simprograms, or just don't patch at all, the game won't run! 

Sometimes it just plain won't start at all when I run ts3.exe and Sims3Launcher.exe just comes up with a ?Sims3Launcher has crashed, please send this error report to Windows? dialog if I try to run it. Other times I get through the main intro and loading screen of The Sims 3 then I get an error message saying that ?EA cannot verify whether your CD is legitimate, please contact customer service? blah, blah, blah.

I?m using Windows XP SP3 if it helps.

Unlike the huge differances between Sims 1 and 2, there is almost no difference between sims 2 and 3. outside of personality tweaks and the use of cell shading, you lose more then you gain by switching.

,Mesamoon,2010-01-01T00:15Z,"IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE SCREEN GOING BLACK AND NOT DOING ANYTHING, OR OTHER PROBLEMS.
HERE IS HOW TO REALLY GET IT TO WORK:
(SPECIAL THANKS TO HAROLDM)
1. Download: The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED (If you already have it installed [not downloaded] uninstall it. 
2. Do not patch the game, or crack anything (yet)
3. Go to your firewall (this could be your anti-virus program) and block the following from accessing the internet : ""Sims3Launcher.exe"", ""TS3.exe"" (Should be found in your bin folder, mine is like this ""C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin"")
4. Download ""The-Sims-3.Update.1.6.6-BAT""
5. Go to the 'Patch' folder  and install ""Sims3_1.6.6.002002_from_1.0.631.00002""
6. Go the 'Crack' folder, copy 'TS3' and paste in you Bin folder, (C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin). And replace.
7. Repeat step 3.

YOU CAN NOW PLAY ENJOY--KEEP READING IF YOU WANT VERSION 1.8.25.

* I suggest you install all your 'Customs' now if you have any.

8.  Download, and follow file instructions: The.Sims.3.Update.v1.7.9-FASDOX

9. Repeat step 3.

* I suggest you install all your 'Customs' right now if you don't want to have to go through a lot of fuzz.

10. Download, and follow file instructions: The.Sims.3.Update.v1.8.25-FASDOX

AND THERE YOU GO! =]

*To install 'Customs' in version 1.8.25:

Download: The Sims 3 Store Update Pack 2009-12-03 (You don't need the 'Customs' from here but you do need the 'Sims3Pack Multi Installer'.

As of the latest patch, (1.8/2.3) installing pirated store content from the EA Launcher does not work. To get around this new protection scheme, you need to use the included Sims3Pack Multi Installer to extract .package files from the .Sims3Pack files. Once you have extracted all of the files, simply cut/paste the .package files into your Mods folder. If you do not have a Mods folder, do a Google search for ""Sims 3 Mod Framework"" and you can hopefully figure it out from there.

Congratulations, you have sucessfully bypassed the EA Launcher to install pirated content! All of the items should now be in-game.


I HOPE EVERYTHING WORKS! =]
GOOD LUCK. "

,savestheeday,2010-01-04T17:12Z,"If you want this game to work, do what I say step by step!

1) Disable anti-virus so it doesn't attempt to delete your keygen

2) Mount image and install, and choose NOT install EA Download Manager!

3) Use the keygen provided under the mounted disk to generate a key

4) Once the game is installed, DO NOT RUN!  Instead, go into Windows firewall, and create a new inbound AND outbound rules for TS3.exe, and Sims3Launcher!  So in total, you would have made 4 new rules, two for inbound, and two for outbound.  I don't know if outbound needs to be made, but I did it and it works just peachy

5) Once this is done, run the Patch provided by Razor (I love you Razor)

6) after that, THEN replace the crack files provided, placing them under ""Electronic Arts/Sims3/Game/Bin""

7) Once that is done, delete the Sims 3 icon on the desktop that was created during install, and create a new shortcut from the newly placed TS3.exe file, and launch the game from the TS3.exe file ONLY!

8) Enjoy your new pirate game!


Note:  I tried other methods that people suggested, and they all failed for me.  Left me with a black screen when the game loaded.  This works perfect for me!"

Copy the crack files into the game/bin folder and overwrite the exe and dll file after you patch. That's it.

This means you copied the crack files 2x. I'm not sure if it's necessary to crack the game BEFORE you install the update, as per Razor's Readme.txt but I'm guessing you don't need to. Just update first, then crack. Voila (or as you dumbshits might say, ""wala."")"

Then get the crack, copy the files in there. Go to Program Files (Might be program files (x86)), click game, gameplay, bin, and paste the files in there.
This alllows you to play the game without a cd.

,darkbreed,2010-03-02T17:23Z,"I just added a FULL package including retail version of Sims 3 standalone, PLUS World Adventures, AND in addition Riverview world, ALL store objects released up until January 2010, fixed awesomemod, uncensor patch, ALL patches up until latest version (Sims 3 1.10.6 and World Adventures 2.5.12) with complete and easy to follow instructions on how to CORRECTLY get the game and all extras installed. You can find this package here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5403527/Sims_3___World_Adventures___All_store_items___patches___rivervie

I had serious problems with the other releases and installing and so on. If you already have downloaded either razorblade release or reloaded release, you may simply download the other parts you want by deselecting the Sims 3 Iso in your Torrent Client as the rest should work for the other releases two - and all patches included.

,RamVa,2010-03-17T00:18Z,"@gcarney: Use a program like poweriso or daemon to create a virtual drive were you mount the iso file. Alternatively, you can just extract the iso with winrar and click on setup to start installation."

Help ME!"
,camboslice,2010-03-17T14:23Z,"to gcarney - i just figured all this mount stuff out yesterday. 

when you download the torrent it will be in a zip file. you need to unzip this folder using winzip or 7zip etc. just click extract files.

you also need to download daemon tools, i downloaded a trial version but im sure you'l be able to find the complete version if u wanted it. 

what this program does to my knowledge is it creates a phantom disk drive which you can then add a program to so that your pc thinks that you have the disk installed. 

when you open up daemon tools there will be a bit at the bottom which says virtual devices and in there you can create a new SCSI Virtual drive. once you have an empty Virtual Drive you right click on that and click mount. you mount the original ZIP file, not any of the extracted files. 

you only need to extract the files to get the keygen out of the crack file. 

I hope this helps mate "

,italian3034,2010-04-30T05:56Z,run windows 7 x64 bit ult ed works great updated al the way to 1.11.7 thanks razor  keep making good cracks no matter what these F*cking noobs say...
,hannahhannah,2010-05-02T09:11Z,"I hope someone can help me with this: I'm running Windows 7 64 and the game works perfectly for me. I used a different key generator though and run the game from the replaced ts3.exe file in the bin folder as suggested, NOT the launcher which was created on the desktop. 

However, I can't figure out how to use downloaded objects since they seem to require the launcher? I tried to put the sims3package files into different folder, nothing worked. When I try to start the launcher in the game it doesn't work either. I read that you're supposed to install sims3package files by simply clicking on them, since the launcher doesn't work I redirected them to the ts3.exe file, but that gave me an error.

Can someone please help me with this??"

,snowdude,2010-05-04T06:55Z,"ATTENTION!
For those of you who have been having problems with it saying it is not a valid disk, do not use daemon tools. Use PowerISO. Here is the website to get a free download.

http://download.cnet.com/PowerISO/3000-2646_4-10439118.html

after downloading it, right click on the cd thing and go to mount with PowerIso. It should work."

,hannahhannah,2010-05-04T09:08Z,"riley61: You have to mount or burn the downloaded file in order to install the game. It will ask you for the serial number, use a key generator for sims 3 for this. Then you replace the ts3.exe file plus another file from the folder ""Bin"" with the ones from the folder ""Crack"". Now you're good to go"

Thnx "
,Minimanuel,2010-05-19T16:47Z,"Okay, here's a guide to anyone who hasn't managed to update their sims. This has worked for me and took a long time of searching for an answer before I found a way to do it myself.
1) Download this version of The Sims 3. DO NOT download RELOADED's version as it is difficult to update.
2) Mount the ISO with PowerISO. I use VirtualCloneDrive.
3) Install The Sims 3 and use the keygen provided. Then use the patch located on the disk.

DO NOT COPY THE CRACK, I REPEAT, LEAVE THE CRACKED FILE ALONE. YOU DO NOT NEED IT YET.

4) Run the launcher and it will say the game needs an update. Let the game update itself. If you get the error 'Invalid File' or 'Missing File' look at the installer and it should show the missing file as 'sims3launcher.exe.config'
5) If this is your case, close the update, go to My Computer and then along the top status bar, go to Folder Options.
6) A new window will open named Folder Options, click on the View Tab.
7) Find the box that's next to 'Hide Extension For Known File Types'. Untick this box and click ok.
8) Now run the update again. It should complete this fine. 
9) Now run the Sims 3 WA Autosetup and let it install. It should say that Sims 3 needs to be updated to install it. Click Ok and let it automactically update it. 

AGAIN, DO NOT USE THE CRACK FOR WORLD ADVENTURES. LEAVE THE CRACK IN THE FOLDER.

10) This is now Sims 3 and Sims 3 WA installed.
11) Now download High End Loft and run the Autosetup. Again it will ask to update Sims, LET IT UPDATE. Wait for it to install.
12) NOW MOVE THE CRACK FOR HIGH END LOFT INTO THE SIMS 3 FOLDER. And it should be working. Also make sure the crack you have is the same region as the High end loft youve installed otherwise the crack wont work.

If you feel I missed anything let me know. Also i have not downloaded EA Download Manager.

(THIS IS MY WAY)

SMART TIP - Make a Shortcut to Everything you download. make a ""PC Games"" folder to add the game(s) you download into. On this, make a C:\Users\''Username''\Desktop\PC Games\Sims 3

1. Download PowerISO and this torrent.

2. When You have this torrent, open PowerISO and open the torrent here ( THE THING YOU ARE GOING TO OPEN IS THE .iso FILE - the one that looks like a yellow/orange CD ).

3. All the files that shows up in PowerISO, Drag them into C:\Users\''Username''\Desktop\PC Games\Sims 3. On me there always pops up an error after replacing the files from PowerISO into ..\Sims 3, leave it after everything is finished, cause after PowerISO is done, there comes just the same one more time..

3.1. When everything above is done, open the error message on PowerISO and press ""switch to"" ( The left of the three choices ), then close the folder that pops up. ( for the new guys, as you, jbb812,
 this is mounting - If its wrong, its just the same )

4. Open the folder where you placed your mounted files and open/start setup. To find this file - Its called Sims3Setup - All setups is called, as this Sims3Setup.EXE and have the type: Program.

5. In the setup you will need Serial Keys, here are some of the ones I find:
6e9r-d2ty-252x-h25s-2rld
2fww-tcwj-83wz-m83n-5rld
6mcl-klly-t72q-2t7s-trld
6fnw-femp-8r2r-58rs-urld
njff-6t4l-67a8-d672-crld

6nwe-77yu-r524-ss5s-7rld ( Keys from guest, http://www.blurtit.com/q7843387.html )

6. After finishing the installing the setup, you have one part left - Crack.

6.1. For me ( and probably many other Windows 7 users, we regulary install this at C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3.. Find your your torrent download folder. You will find the two files called ""TS3.exe"" and ""TSLhost.dll"". The you will have to drag into C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin.

7. As you will se, they are there from before. Still, get rid of the ones that were there and add the files you have in your torrent download. Sounds dumb, but this is NEEDED.

8. The game should work now, so enjoY =)"

Help! 
I have followed all the steps by Tiny4201 but when I run the game it says a software update is available, so I can go two ways:

Update --> When I try to update it downloads most of it and says it is invalid and returns to the launcher screen.

Don't update --> When I try to run Sims 3 from the launcher it says ""Program too big to fit memory""; exactly the same for when I try to run from the TS3 application from the Bin folder.

Okay for those people who dont download the ea manager you do know that you cant get anything custom objects into the game. (for example clothes, objects, ect)   If anybody has found any way to still be able to get custom objects please tell me.  

Also another thing i notice if you want the custom objects to work and the new map for the sims 3 you must download the other sims 3 torrent.  (forgot who but you can find out )  The problem with that is that you cant download the other expansion packs.  Im downloading all of them to test it out witch one is better so ill keep you guys posted.  Happy sims life :)"

3. download patch and crack bundle from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5689494/The_Sims_3_All_Expansion_Packs_Cracks___Latest_Updates%2813-7-2010 and unrar it. It includes updates and cracks for the expansion packs too but ignore those if you don't have them.

5. backup the original files, then use the crack. 
6. launch from TS3.exe

,TomCatJak,2010-08-01T00:59Z,"Wow really...You guys are making this WAY too complicated. For those that want to play JUST this do the following:

1) Install Razor's release DON'T CRACK OR PATCH

2) Install patch, 1.6.6.002002_from_1.0.631.00002.exe
Found HERE : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5168758/The.Sims.3.Update.1.6.6-BAT

3) Move the TS3.exe from the Crack in The.Sims.3.Update.1.6.6-BAT to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin

4) Play! 

Those instructions actually worked...you can choose to apply the patch after.

,INeedTheSims3,2010-08-17T01:33Z,"I got The Sims 3, WA and Ambitions downloaded.


Now there is this:



=================================================================


1. install sims 3 razor use the patch provided to update (do not crack)make
 sure u r antivirus is disabled (needs to be disabled for patching)after that u can enable it 
2 .now install sims 3 world adventures reloaded (it will ask u to update)update on line tip:install 
EA download manager its good when download completes through EADM u can copy update file 
loacated on u r hard drive for future C:ProgramDataElectronic ArtsEA Corecache
3. now install Sims 3 Highend loft stuff vitality and update this one too 
4 .now install ambitions vitality and update it as well 

NOTE: do not use cracks cause they dont get updated every now and then,use mounted image insted which works as Orignal DVD no matter what version is updated

=================================================================

1 - Install Sims 3 first. DON'T UPDATE. Don't crack. Wait till your done installing everything.
2 - (OPTIONAL) Install world adventures, high end loft stuff, ambitions. (try that order, you can 
decide to skip one or two or all, wont hurt)
3 - Crack the last installed expansion/stuff pack.
4 - update/patch at your own risk. you might not be able to install the next expansion pack (whenever it comes out) 
if you do. It happend to me, had to reinstall and start all over.

So yes, you have the hang of it. cracking the old expansion packs will do no harm. However, you must crack 
the last installed pack at least, and use it to start the game. I guess you can use one of the old cracks to start the game if you prefer. 
Also be sure to follow the instructions in the nfo files of the torrents over mine, for example, this torrent requires you crack AND replace two old sims 3 files with Vitality files.

TIP: create a shortcut to the crack, and use it. else your gonna have to use the desktop shortcut which goes to the sims launcher. and that's soooo much wasted time!!

=================================================================

WHICH ONE IS RIGHT?!
HOW SHOULD I INSTALL THEM?!"

if your getting the message about the game not being valid or whatever, then you need to make sure that you FOLLOWED the instructions to a tee. If you don't use the crack you'll get a message about verifying the cd. Also i always open the game from the file you copied to the tsbin folder. "

What do I do?"
,Vicccy,2010-09-05T17:37Z,"@ststacy 
You have to mount it with a program.

Instructions for noobs like me haha:
1. When you've downloaded the file, it's time to mount the iso image with a program for ex. Daemon tools. It's a program that tricks your computer to believe that you have the actual cd inside. (Not sure if it's correct in english) but rightclick on the program>Virtual CD/DVD rom> Device 0 [E]>Mount Image and then you look for the Iso file you just downloaded and mount it.
When you're done, start the The sims 3 program and follow the instructions to install it. 
Serial: W2c4-vatb-3sex-s3s6-3rld or 7GN6-R796-X6ZM-HLGN-7B6D . If none of them works, google one yourself.
When you're done installing, go to the crack folder you downloaded, copy TS3 and go to My computer>C/program/electronic art/The sims 3/Game/Bin  and when you're there right click and press ""Copy"" and when a window comes up press the ""Copy and replace"". Now you've cracked the file! So it should work now when you start the game to play. :)

That's what I did to make it work. When you are installing the other games like Ambitions just do the same thing. It worked for me too. It's not hard. ;)
"
,Vicccy,2010-09-05T17:38Z,"Opps, when you're in the bin folder, press PASTE not copy. ;)"

,Danimoloko,2010-09-12T00:05Z,"I'd just like to thank the uploader for making this available for people who can't always go out and buy overpriced games & another big thanks to the commenters who have helped me in learning how to even use torrents. 

Of course, I have one question about this, which I haven't caught in the comments. The only custom content I can use are the .sims3pack ones (I hope I got that right) by using the method of downloading and placing them into the downloads folder. From then on I operate the launcher off-line and install them. They show up fine in the game (which I got working by reading the comments) but all my other .package CC does not show up. I've tried using Delphy's TS3 Helper Monkey programs on MTS and even doing it manually by making a mods folder and using the resource.cfg file. Still no luck.

I just wanted to ask, do I need to patch up a certain amount to use them? 

Right now I have 1.7.9.002002 installed and my game is running perfectly. I want to use extra facial sliders and clothing, but I can't seem to work it out.

I'll fiddle around with it more and see if I can find any possible solutions. I already checked google and host of other sources and this is my last resort. Maybe I'll just have to live without CC...

This will set up the game on your computer(use the serials provided or the keygen).

Help pls"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-10-04T18:18Z,"So for anyone that cares; Here's how to install The Sims 3 with World Adventures, Ambitions and The High End Loft Stuff, fully updated and cracked with no issues:

1) First d/l the torrents you will need - I'll post the ones i used, but i don't think it really matters which ones you get:

The Sims 3: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED

Ambitions: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5602463/The_Sims_3_Ambitions-ViTALiTY-[tracker.BTARENA.org].iso

World Adventures: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5168507/The_Sims_3_World_Adventures-RELOADED

High End Loft Stuff: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5329998/The.Sims.3.High.End.Loft.Stuff-ViTALiTY

Updated Cracks: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5841490/The_Sims3__amp__All_Expantions_Cracks_Only_(10-9-2010)_(RePack)

2) Once all torrents are downloaded, extract or burn all the ISO files(some of the torrents will be RAR's - just click on the first RAR to extract the ISO file(use WinRar). Personally, i extracted all the ISO's into separate folders, but i don't think it matters.

3) Once all the ISO's are Extracted or Burned, you can start installing them. First install The Sims 3(use the keygen to get a serial - disable your anti-virus as it will most likely read the keygen as a threat... it's not).

4) When The Sims 3 is installed, you will need to update it(do not crack any of the programs till the VERY end!). To update your Sims 3, go to this page: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

...If you did a fresh install of ExtremeZone's 'Razor1911' torrent, you will use the very first Sims 3 update.

5) Now that your Sims 3 is installed and updated, you can now install and update your expansions. Just do what you did for The Sims 3, install it, then update it from that update page. If you're not sure which version you installed, there is a 'skuversion' TXT file in each folder that will tell you which version it is... but for the most part, you will be using the first update files in each list.

...It should all go very smoothly. I'll post some serials for those who are too lazy to look:

(continued in next post)"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-10-04T18:18Z,"(...continued)

a) Install Ambitions - use serial (VJZR-UPAC-SCRM-PITA-LITY), then update from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

(do not crack!)

b) Install World Adventures - use serial (2PXF-EYDN-L3CH-AL3A-MRLD or F33K-HVX5-8KR2-E8KP-6RLD), then update from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

(do not crack!)

c) Install High End Loft - use serial (DKQY-4TMS-8SK9-RRZN-YQVK or GMBK-KYCW-B7LW-2Y54-EE74 or 5BH9-DB77-ZYB5-CUNR-9ZMH), then update from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

6) All your programs should be installed and updated to the latest versions now. So you can go ahead and crack them. Open the Sims 3 & Expansion Crack folder you downloaded, copy both files in each folder to their counterpart Game/Bin folder in the install directory. That's the directory you just installed all your files to... most likely it's something like C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts or C:/Program Files (x86)/Electronic Arts for us 64bit users.

Find that directory, then extract the TWO files from EACH Crack Folder into the Game/Bin folder of the program. So, The Sims 3 crack files, will be copied into the C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Game/Bin folder then overwrite... Do the same for the other cracks.

7) Play the game and enjoy. (or add a ton of mods like i will)

*note: run the games from their TSE files(the ones you copied over from the cracks)


That's about it, it may seem complicated, but that's only because i tried to be thorough with the directions... it's actually ridiculously easy. But if anyone has any questions let me know... or if i screwed up the directions somewhere.

Peace."

@MalusPixie

Did you use the update from this torrent? I hope not because it's outdated. If you didn't and had a clean install(meaning you didn't do anything to it, like update or crack, or try to play it) then you would use this update for your main Sims game: 

http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.15.34.008002_Update.exe

That update should run smoothly from a clean install of RAZOR's file. If you still have the torrent, try a clean reinstall(delete whatever you already installed). Also, make sure you patch before installing the other expansions.

I did a quick search, and a lot of people have gotten that error when trying to patch... seems like on several versions of the game, even legit ones... unfortunately, i did not see any fix posted."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-10-20T07:55Z,"For anyone getting the region errors(which you shouldn't get using Razor's[this] version of Sims 3), here's a site that might be helpful:

http://www.patches-scrolls.de/sims3.php

It contains patches for the game from various regions of the world(even saw a 'worldwide' patch in there) that might help. Just pay attention for the patch versions and the version your installed game is and download accordingly.

*note: i have not used any links from that site and can't confirm them either way."

Im trying to install this tunable core but I keep crashing to desktop after the main load. The creator said to try to make sure Im updated to at least 1.10 so I was wondering if you had those for me? 

You know if you're still around this torrent and all. I assume it would be simple enough as installing like your earlier patches; after installing the game install each patch, then crack it?

Thanks,

~Will"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-10-25T23:30Z,"@WillTroll

If i am reading you correctly, you're trying to install a core mod? Well, either way, this page will update your games to the latest patches:

http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

You have several options, but if your game is patched below 1.10, then you will want to use this one:

http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.15.34.008002_Update.exe

So, if you're installing patches over an *already* cracked game, you will need to put the *original* .exe file back into your game folder.... because you can't patch over cracks(that's why it's a good idea to save the original .exe files).

So yeah, that's basically it, try to find a copy of the original .exe file, copy it back over into the game folder, use the latest patch, then crack it again... after that, you should be able to install the mod or whatever you were trying to do.

If you were looking for an earlier patch(meaning, you don't want to patch to the latest one), then have a look here:

http://www.patches-scrolls.de/sims3.php

I saw a patch in there for version 1.10.6(if you were specifically looking for that patch, that is)... although i recommend patching to the latest, which is 1.15.34."
,evolnemesis1,2010-10-26T14:59Z,"It's the same as any other game, the company is always fixing bugs, adding new features, adding new behaviors and options for building.

the included patch updates the game to the latest version as of when the torrent was added... but, it's a year old.   

EA has been adding new things to the game for a while, and some of the newer patches are required to make the base game compatible with the new expansion packs.  

The patch with the torrent won't do much besides a few early minor bug fixes... i recommend the file evil mentioned, this download is right from EA's site:

[url]http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.15.34.008002_Update.exe
[/url] 

If you install this update file right after a clean install of this ISO, it will update your game all the way to the latest version with no errors.  

The 'crack' by the way isn't technically necessary either, it's a NO-CD crack, BUT the game has NO copy protection at all and won't be able to tell the difference between a mounted ISO and a CD... so you could just mount it if you want and play fine without even touching the game files.

EA's form of copy protection is their web service, you need to register the game with them in order to use the online sharing features, the official sims 3 community site, and the microtransaction shop within the game.  

Needless to say, you won't be able to register this copy if you used a generated key.  If you really want these features, go ahead and buy a legit copy, the developers deserve the money."

And thank you, extremezone! The download worked well and there has been no problems so far, other than the disc verification."
,evolnemesis1,2010-10-26T17:01Z,"Sorry for double post before, was getting errors on the page.   Also, forgot to mention many newer mods also will require a certain patch version, another reason to update the game to the most recent patch.  

The disk verification error, when are you getting it?  If it is from the launcher, ea download manager, or when attempting to register your game or buy something at the sims 3 community site, then your problem is that you can't register the game with EA using that key.   You need to pay for the game to get a legitimate key.

As is, this game should work fully, you just will not be able to access the online features that require you to register your copy. 

If it is just the launcher is giving you this error, try just running the TS3.exe from the game's BIN directory, and make sure that you have either applied the included crack or have the ISO still mounted on a virtual drive.

If it an update giving you this error, then it is probably because you applied the crack before updating (you can only update with the original files in place)."

,evolnemesis1,2010-10-27T07:37Z,"For anyone still having problems, here are guaranteed steps to get this game working AND fully up to date:

1.  Mount the ISO and install the game normally, use the keygen included in the Razor directory on the DVD when it asks for a key.  DO NOT install the update patch or crack in the torrent!  Just install the game.

2. The update patch included with this torrent is outdated.  Do NOT install it, it will cause issues with mods and expansions.  Instead, download the latest update patch from EA:

http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.15.34.008002_Update.exe 

and install it.   This updates the game to the most recent version so it has all bugfixes and new features, and so any mods or other packs you install will work. 
"
,evolnemesis1,2010-10-27T07:45Z,"3.  Now your game should be playable with the ISO mounted, as there is no copy protection.  If you want to play WITHOUT the ISO mounted, then you need the no-dvd crack. For this, you need the a link to the latest no-dvd crack, which can be found at:

http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/sims-3-ver-1-15-34-no-dvd-crack-1298624/

DO NOT use the crack included with this torrent.  It WILL NOT WORK with recent patches, it was made specifically for the old patch which is included in the torrent."

I posted a detailed tutorial on how to install the main game, all the expansions, patches and cracks on page 38 of the comments.

You can't install an expansion over a crack. You will need to copy the original .exe game file(not the crack) back into the TS3 folder before installing World Adventures, then apply the cracks after you've patched WA.

...again, there are full instructions on page 38."

My prob is when I want to crack it (yes it is installed and then patched up) there is no game/bin folder for me to copy the cracks over in what was installed on my pc.  I then mounted the iso to see what happens and it takes me past the launcher, past the intro, right to the start and then the disc verification notice comes up.

Only noticed this now... I suppose thats why when I start it now (from new ts3)nothing happens anymore as supposed to when I nearly got it to work last night (that was by not updating it at all)
I am not bothered about getting the expansions at all now.. would just love to get the game to work!

"" ive mounted iso installed game, replaced ts3 and tslhost, installed final version patch...""

Well, if you did it in that order, than you did it wrong. You can't patch over cracked games... also, i wouldn't suggest using the patch included in the torrent.

Uninstall everything, reinstall your main game, apply the latest patches from this site...

http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

If you're installing a fresh game, then you will most likely use the first patch link, the second one is only for people who are already patched up to 1.15. After you patch your game, you can either install any expansions or dlc's, then finally, apply the cracks.

Hope that helps."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-11-07T16:57Z,"By the way, anyone looking for original uncracked files, or the latest, updated cracked files, can get them here:

You have to register to see the d/l links unfortunately, but it's very quick and completely free(and very useful). I would suggest using the latest cracks with the latest patches if you want your game to install smoothly."

,zachariahholt,2010-11-08T06:26Z,"@evil Your instructions where really good and i followed them to the letter. 

I installed updated to 1.17 then tried to run it while mounted. got the disk bullshit. so then i cracked it and tried using the ts3 but nothing happened. 

then ever time i tried to open it it said failed to launch application. So i deleted it out of the C drive and deleted all related files off my comp to do a new install. but now it wont let me install cause it says sims 3 1.17 is still installed. 

so now im stuck and cant do shit. wtf can i do maan?"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-11-08T07:09Z,"@Davania0745

We all have to learn at some point, Davania(and i'm still learning as i go), so i don't think any questions are dumb. It's the people that are afraid, or too lazy, to ask that end up messing up their install then getting upset. So ask away!

Before i answer your questions let me start off by saying there's a simple basic rule to installing cracked games - ANY cracked game - and that is; extract, install, patch then crack. You should never avert from installing in that order, even though patching is not always necessary.

As far as the DL Manager, that's not something you need unless you have an EA account and plan on downloading something from there. There are some specific sim mods that require to be installed via *a* download manager, but that manager you can access via Sims3Launcher.exe in your bin folder. It's not the same as the EA one.

You will be starting the game from the TS3.exe crack... that crack will be copied(by you) into your bin folder and overwritten. If you're doing a fresh install from this torrent, this is how you should be doing it...

1 - Extract the ISO
2 - Install the game
3 - Grab the latest patch from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php (use the first link at the top)
4 - Install any expansions (then patch your expansions) - if necessary
5 - Then install latest cracks

If you follow the above method, your game will be patched up to 1.17.60(the latest), also, if you install Late Night, that will automatically install the latest patch, so you will need to use the 1.17.60 crack. Which can be found at that paradox site linked in my previous post. Just make sure you d/l the cracked file, not the original. :)"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-11-08T07:22Z,"@zachariahholt

Did you install the 1.17.60 patch before or after you added the crack(s)? I realize you mentioned ""so then i cracked it..."", but i'm wondering if you installed, cracked, patched, then cracked again? If so, that will be your problem. If not, are you sure you used the proper crack? You will need to specifically use the 1.17.60 crack found at:

http://***file.com/dl/78621412/e43596e/Sims3_v1.17_No-DVD-cheewongken.rar.html

(replace stars with ""hot"")

Also, you shouldn't just ""delete"" the files from your comp... you need to actually uninstall the game(s). You can do that via the control panel... i also suggest people get some sort of registry cleaner, to clear up old registry entries left by removed programs(they always leave a bunch of registry files behind which may, or may not, screw a reinstall up).

So yeah, completely uninstall your game(s), do a fresh install, patch to 1.17.60, apply the latest 1.17.60 crack, then you should be able to play. I will add that i have never actually played cracked games by burning to a disk, i always install to my HD, so i'm not too familiar with that method(if that is what you did, i'm not sure).

If it doesn't work, let us know."
,zachariahholt,2010-11-08T19:41Z,"@Evil yeah i installed then updated and then tried to run it cause somewhere some said you dont need to if you keep the iso mounted. 

yeah i didn't dl the crack. and i didnt think i could uninstall cause every time i tried to open the game it couldnt open.

,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-11-25T22:23Z,"**Sims 3 + Expansion Install Tutorial**

I'm going to post this again as it seems a lot of people are having some unnecessary problems... This instructions will will install the main game, plus all the relevant expansions - fully patched and cracked.



1) First d/l the torrents you will need - I'll post the ones i used:

**The Sims 3: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED

**Ambitions: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5602463/The_Sims_3_Ambitions-ViTALiTY-[tracker.BTARENA.org].iso

**World Adventures: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5168507/The_Sims_3_World_Adventures-RELOADED

**High End Loft Stuff: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5329998/The.Sims.3.High.End.Loft.Stuff-ViTALiTY

**Late Night: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5913515/The_Sims_3_Late_Night-RELOADED

**Updated Cracks + Originals: http://tehparadox.com/forum/f67/sims-3-all-expansions-stuff-packs-cracks-original-uncracked-files-1194582/

2) Once all torrents are downloaded, extract or burn the ISO files(some of the torrents will be in RAR format - just click on the first RAR to extract the ISO file - use WinRar). Personally, i extracted all the ISO's into separate folders, then extracted those ISO's into the same folder to keep everything in order.

3) Once you have all the ISO's files extracted(or burned), you can start installing the games. First, install The Sims 3(use the keygen to get a serial).

4) When The Sims 3 is installed, you will need to update it(do *not* crack anything yet). To update your Sims 3, go to this page: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

...If you did a fresh install, you will most likely use the very first Sims 3 update.

5) Now, your Sims 3 should be installed and updated, so you can now install and update any expansions you want(again, do *not* crack anything yet). Just do what you did for The Sims 3, install it, then locate the proper patch from the above link."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-11-25T22:39Z,"(...continued)

a) Install Ambitions - use serial (VJZR-UPAC-SCRM-PITA-LITY), then update from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

(do not crack!)

b) Install World Adventures - use serial (2PXF-EYDN-L3CH-AL3A-MRLD or F33K-HVX5-8KR2-E8KP-6RLD), then install latest patch.

(do not crack!)

c) Install High End Loft - use serial (DKQY-4TMS-8SK9-RRZN-YQVK or GMBK-KYCW-B7LW-2Y54-EE74 or 5BH9-DB77-ZYB5-CUNR-9ZMH), then install latest patch.

d) Install Late Night - use the Keygen, then install the latest patch.

Get ALL the latest patches from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

6) Now all your games/expansions should be installed and patched to the latest update. So you can go ahead and crack them. Use the 'Updated Cracks' link from step 1 above. You will need to register to the paradox site, it's quick, and definitely worth it. Just make sure you d/l the cracks and not the original files.

Once your cracks are d/l'd, overwrite the files to their appropriate Game/Bin folders(ie; Sims 3 crack to Sims 3 bin, and Late Night crack to Late Night bin folder). Most likely, you'll find all the game bin folders @ C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/... or C:/Program Files (x86)/Electronic Arts/... for the 64bit users.

So, The Sims 3 crack files, will be copied into the C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Game/Bin folder then overwritten... then just do the same for the other cracks.

7) Play the game and enjoy. (or add a bunch of mods)

*note: run the games from their TSE files(the ones you copied over from the cracks)


If you follow these instruction without skipping any steps or getting ahead of yourselves, you shouldn't have a problem. If you do, please Google it before asking, or read through the comments, as most problems have already been covered."

I haven't tried it yet, but one question appeared in my head: 

[quote:]
"" *note: run the games from their TSE files(the ones you copied over from the cracks) ""

Does this mean that you have to choose witch expansion you want to play, every time you start the game? 

Or do you have to start the expansions from the 'ts3expansion.exe'-file (the cracks) one single time, to like... activate them?

Or, can you, after starting every expansion from the 'ts3expansion.exe', start 'ts3.exe' and play with all expansions at the same time?

,Japa2,2010-11-29T00:57Z,"Hi!

Okay, so i have this problem- of course. At first the game worked perfectly. But then the game asked if i wanted to install the latest update and i said yes. After that the game didnt work. When i tried to enter the game, it just said that ""Sims 3 have a problem, and we will try to fix it"". 

Then i tried to reinstall the game, but i couldnt do that either, because of the new update i installed. So now i cant play or reinstall the game. 

Can anyone help me? I would appreciate it a lot!"

Download the uTorrent
Download Winrar
Download this Torrent[May take a few hours]
Once downloaded, download either Daemon Tools or PowerISO and INSTALL!
Then Open up the folder you installed this torrent, The Sims 3.

Then, Install and use the Keycode: U8ZZ-GZNQ-D7N2-S5T3-1911
Now, copy TS3 out of Crack and replace the one in the game files in Program Files under Electronic Arts with this TS3 from Crack folder downloaded in this torrent.
Once you have replaced the TS3 file in the game files with the TS3 file in the Crack folder, Create a SHORTCUT to the new TS3 file in the game folder, place the shortcut on your desktop. It should be named ""TS3 Shortcut"" or something similar. Simply re-name it to ""The Sims 3""

I'm sure your question has been answered already, but after you install the expansions, any game .EXE file will run the same main game(most likely it will say 'Late Night' when starting up). For instance, if you opened the original Sims 3 game .EXE, it will still say 'The Sims3 - Late Night' in the opening credits, same goes for all the other game files. If you didn't install Late Night, then any game file would open up as 'The Sims 3 - World Adventures'... as all the expansions intertwine with the main game, they don't act as separate programs.

Hope that helps."

Yeah, you can't install updates or patches over a crack. That's why that site i linked to has both crack *and* original .EXE files. If you're trying to update or patch a cracked game, you need to seek out the *original* .EXE file, then copy it over the crack(exactly the opposite of how you cracked it), then install the update, then crack it again(with the *new* updated crack - also on that site).

Hope that helps.

@heidin23

What i meant was if you have all those expansions installed, they will all open together. It's not like you can *just* play Late Night, or *just* play World adventures... they are now officially part of the Sims 3 main game.

Even if you installed World Adventures(for example) in the middle of a Sims 3 game, nothing will change. You keep all your traits and everything i believe, the only difference is now you have all the World Adventures options... like going to the phone and planning a trip. Same goes for all the Sims 3 expansions. The other difference is the game will no longer ""start up"" as The Sims 3... it will now either start up as ""The Sims 3 - World Adventures"" or ""The Sims 3 - Late Night""... depending on which you have install or which you installed last(i think)... it will say this no matter what .EXE you attempt to start the game with.

...which raises the question, why do they even bother *putting* an game start file with the expansions, since the original Sims 3 game file opens it all up anyway.

FYI, i posted fairly detailed instruction for install on page 44. Just make sure you use the updated patch/crack list which is posted a few comments above."

Did you update from a fresh install, meaning, did you just install this game and then update? If you did that, i hope you didn't use the patch in the torrent, if you didn't use it, and applied the patches over a fresh install, then you would need to apply the latest crack, ie; if you patched it to 1.89.xx, then you will need the 1.89.xx crack. Make sense?

If you patched it over a *already* cracked game, you would have needed to apply the original .EXE file over the crack before patching, otherwise it will cause problems. Once you apply the original .EXE then apply the patch, you will need to, once again, make sure you use an updated crack... not the same one you had before.

Like Scullyy said, you need to get the crack intended for the latest patch. You also probably shouldn't have used the patch in the download, as i've heard that's caused problems for some people who patch over it.

Anyway, since you applied an older crack to a newer patch, you may want to just wipe that out and do a clean reinstall... you may not have to, though. I would suggest finding the latest patch that matches the update and just giving it a try, you can find it here:

,nGBeast,2010-12-31T03:08Z,"for those who missed this by mWare this was the best instructions I saw on installing, simple and concise, and this was my first game torrenting.

Download the uTorrent
Download Winrar
Download this Torrent[May take a few hours]
Once downloaded, download either Daemon Tools or PowerISO and INSTALL!
Then Open up the folder you installed this torrent, The Sims 3.
-Should be Crack, Final Version Patch, click the next one. and it will open up the folder with the PowerISO file in. Right Click ->PowerISO-> Mount to Drive.
Then, Install and use the Keycode: U8ZZ-GZNQ-D7N2-S5T3-1911
Now, copy TS3 out of Crack and replace the one in the game files in Program Files under Electronic Arts with this TS3 from Crack folder downloaded in this torrent.
Once you have replaced the TS3 file in the game files with the TS3 file in the Crack folder, Create a SHORTCUT to the new TS3 file in the game folder, place the shortcut on your desktop. It should be named ""TS3 Shortcut"" or something similar. Simply re-name it to ""The Sims 3""
Done. Open the shortcut, play sims 3."

,Hana-kimi,2011-01-01T18:03Z,"Can I play a downloaded copy of ""Late Night"" while I have a legal copy of The Sims 3 installed?
Thank you in advance.

@kittykat219 You need 1 GB RAM to run the game on Windows XP, and 1.5 GB RAM for it to run on Windows Vista.
Defragmenting the hard disk drive which the game is installed to can help.
You can defragment a hard disk drive by right-clicking it and going to ""properties,"" and then to ""tools"".
Or by downloading a defragmentation tool from this site."

,brnkstl,2011-01-03T12:14Z,"I got it working thanks to EvilCorporateWhore's instructions on page 44.  Big thanks for ECW for being a patient helper for a good part of a year.  It works perfectly.  I've never had to deal with a game that was so fussy about the way it's installed.  

To the people having problems, basically follow ECW's instructions.  If you uninstalled TS3 before, make sure to use a program that will delete ALL traces of TS3 from your computer.  I'd recommend CCleaner.  Then restart before reinstalling.  

Also, if the region you chose for the base game doesn't match your system locale, some of the expansions will try to install in a different language and the game won't work.  

Good luck guys!"
,Bjorvy,2011-01-03T15:25Z,"STEP 1: Download the Torrent.
STEP 2: Mount it with Daemon Tools.
STEP 3: Install the game.
STEP 4: Type in one of the generated CD-Keys.
STEP 5: Open the Crack File called ts3.exe
STEP 6: Copy Paste the Crack into the folder where a file of the same name is.
STEP 7: Play the game using that file.

There you have it. Good luck!"

2 - can i update it from the launcher? i only ask because i updated it a little while ago and then i tried to open the game and it kept asking me to put in the disk. keep in mind it worked perfectly fine before this but i was trying to install a lot of mods so i'm not entirely sure if the two are related.  and if i can't update from the launcher, where do i get my updates from?

please & thank you!"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-01-08T19:34Z,"@eatoutlots

lol. Yeah, i guess that does seem like a lot. But that's only because i posted those instructions for people that wanted to install all, or most of, the expansions as well. Hence the reason there are so many files.

There are a few files on here that have them all packed together, with the possibility of one exception. So perhaps that might be a more suitable torrent for you. Although, the file sizes are about the same, so i don't see a big difference from 1 huge file, or 5 big files. Especially since the huge files are, in fact, just singles files placed together... so there's really no difference, is there?


Glad some people got some use out of those instructions... the formula is quite simple, really: install/update/crack/play ...in the case of expansions, you just add a few more install/updates in the mix. :D"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-01-08T19:44Z,"@mermaidhair

Yes, you can mod the crap out of this game... i have tons of mods in mine, including core mods which allow me to control almost every thing in the game.

For your second question, i think you can patch from the launcher, but you're going to have to re-crack the game. Also, i don't recommend updating over an already cracked game. So, find out what your game is now patched up to(it's the latest i'm sure - i just haven't played this game in a long time so i don't know what the latest may be atm), then locate the crack for that patch. You should stop getting that error."

as for the mods, do you think you could give me a quick step by step as to how you get your custom content to show up? i guess i'm doing something wrong but i just can't figure out what.

I wouldn't come here to learn how to mod you Sims game, go to a sims modding site, like http://www.modthesims.info/ ...they have a bunch of great mods and information on how to download them.

Not all mods are installed exactly the same, so there's no one way to really explain it. Check out that site, though, and google some others, there are some great mods out there.

@Chlortabs

Did you update your game? If so, did you make sure to apply the correct crack after you updated?

@braduz

Learn2Torrent.

@PLASEEBOMAN

Sounds like you might be having the same problem as Chlortabs. Did you update after installing? If so, did you make sure to apply the updated crack to the game? 

@livlena

Yes, you *have* to copy the crack over the existing game start-up files. It will ask you to overwrite them, say yes and start the game from the TS3.exe file. Just make sure that if you updated your game, you find and download an updated crack.

@deadbattery

That's really odd, sounds like a corrupt download... even more odd to happen 5 times. Normally i would suggest downloading a fresh copy, but you'e obviously already done that. My other suggestion would be use a different client, i use UTorrent, not sure if that's what you're using. Maybe try different programs to unpack the files, too. MagicISO has never let me down for extracting ISO files, of IMGBurn for burning them.

What is the *exact* error you get, and, have you tried googling the error? Odds are if you got the error, other people have as well.

@xkristin01

I posted full install instructions on page 38, perhaps i'll post them again, an updated version, for people who don't bother to read back that far.

@Angerfist_DJ

You updated over the crack, didn't you? You shouldn't update, or add any DLC's over cracked games. If you plan to update or install DLC's after you've already cracked your game, you need to replace the original game files first. After you've updated or installed the DLC's, then you need to apply an *updated* crack... ie; you you patched up to 1.18.xx, then you need to get the 1.18.xx crack. 

Hope that helps."

,maabdout,2011-02-21T12:14Z,"This is a comment posted earlier that helped me thx EvilCorporateWhore

1) First d/l the torrents you will need - I'll post the ones i used:

**The Sims 3: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED

**Ambitions: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5602463/The_Sims_3_Ambitions-ViTALiTY-[tracker.BTARENA.org].iso

**World Adventures: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5168507/The_Sims_3_World_Adventures-RELOADED

**High End Loft Stuff: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5329998/The.Sims.3.High.End.Loft.Stuff-ViTALiTY

**Late Night: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5913515/The_Sims_3_Late_Night-RELOADED

**Updated Cracks + Originals: http://tehparadox.com/forum/f67/sims-3-all-expansions-stuff-packs-cracks-original-uncracked-files-1194582/

2) Once all torrents are downloaded, extract or burn the ISO files(some of the torrents will be in RAR format - just click on the first RAR to extract the ISO file - use WinRar). Personally, i extracted all the ISO's into separate folders, then extracted those ISO's into the same folder to keep everything in order.

3) Once you have all the ISO's files extracted(or burned), you can start installing the games. First, install The Sims 3(use the keygen to get a serial).

4) When The Sims 3 is installed, you will need to update it(do *not* crack anything yet). To update your Sims 3, go to this page: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

...If you did a fresh install, you will most likely use the very first Sims 3 update.

5) Now, your Sims 3 should be installed and updated, so you can now install and update any expansions you want(again, do *not* crack anything yet). Just do what you did for The Sims 3, install it, then locate the proper patch from the above link.
"
,maabdout,2011-02-21T12:16Z,"(...continued)

a) Install Ambitions - use serial (VJZR-UPAC-SCRM-PITA-LITY), then update from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

(do not crack!)

b) Install World Adventures - use serial (2PXF-EYDN-L3CH-AL3A-MRLD or F33K-HVX5-8KR2-E8KP-6RLD), then install latest patch.

(do not crack!)

c) Install High End Loft - use serial (DKQY-4TMS-8SK9-RRZN-YQVK or GMBK-KYCW-B7LW-2Y54-EE74 or 5BH9-DB77-ZYB5-CUNR-9ZMH), then install latest patch.

d) Install Late Night - use the Keygen, then install the latest patch.

Get ALL the latest patches from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

6) Now all your games/expansions should be installed and patched to the latest update. So you can go ahead and crack them. Use the 'Updated Cracks' link from step 1 above. You will need to register to the paradox site, it's quick, and definitely worth it. Just make sure you d/l the cracks and not the original files.

Once your cracks are d/l'd, overwrite the files to their appropriate Game/Bin folders(ie; Sims 3 crack to Sims 3 bin, and Late Night crack to Late Night bin folder). Most likely, you'll find all the game bin folders @ C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/... or C:/Program Files (x86)/Electronic Arts/... for the 64bit users.

So, The Sims 3 crack files, will be copied into the C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Game/Bin folder then overwritten... then just do the same for the other cracks.

7) Play the game and enjoy. (or add a bunch of mods)

*note: run the games from their TSE files(the ones you copied over from the cracks)

Extremezone torrents are always good. 

One thing I will note, however, in regards to 

http://filesmelt.com/dl/TS3_InstallationTutorial_ECW.txt

(Which is a fantastic guide, btw) is that if you're installing the lot of them, the only one you need to go back and crack is the latest-patched one, so if you were for example installing all the games and Stuff packs, the only one you need to install the two cracked files for is the Late Night expansion. (Ie, the latest expansion) 

You do NOT go back and crack ambitions, world adventures, etc. Just the LN one. That, I think, is why some people have a hard time getting it to work. "

I have installed the game and the patch without any problems (cracked it too), I also used one of the named serials.

,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-05T23:52Z,"@Armageddon1976

Theoretically, you're absolutely correct, one only needs to crack the last patch/expansion, as all the game files ultimately open the same game.

With that said, cracking all the game files should have no impact on the installation itself. Perhaps it's an unnecessary step if you're installing them all in one shot, but again, it shouldn't effect a clean installation either way."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-06T00:05Z,"@elinorejansson

Did you use the proper crack? You say you patched it, i'm assuming you used the latest patch, or did you use the one in the torrent? If you used the one in the torrent - something i would not suggest as others have had problems with it as well - then did you use the crack in the torrent, too?

Here's what i suggest, uninstall the game, then reinstall it(do not crack it), and this time don't use the patch within the torrent, go to:

http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

...and obtain the latest patch for the main game(assuming you only have the main game installed). After it's properly patched, go to:

http://tehparadox.com/forum/f18/sims-3-all-expansions-stuff-packs-cracked-files-patch-17-onwards-1473431/

...and grab the latest crack to coincide with the patch version(again, don't use the crack within the torrent). You will need to register to the site above to access the links, but it's worth it."

1) Do i have to download ALL the patches that followed since the game release??? If yes..

2) Where can i find all of these patches and download them FOR FREE??? (and i mean no registration to any pages or paying n stuff..)

,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-07T22:52Z,"@8emakos

If you looked at my tutorial it's pretty straight forward.

1. Download this torrent.
2. Install the game - use the keygen to obtain a key.
3. Update/patch the game from: http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php (use the first link - ""Any version to 1.19.44.010002"")
4. Locate the crack for that patch from: http://tehparadox.com/forum/f18/sims-3-all-expansions-stuff-packs-cracked-files-patch-17-onwards-1473431/ (yes, you will need to register - it's free)
5. Play the f*cking game.

My tutorial also includes instructions to d/l, install and patch/crack the expansions, too... but they're not needed if you don't want any expansions. Although i recommend them because they add a lot to a game that can get boring super fast.

If you're too much of a whiner to register to a free, and very handy forum, then stfu and find another source for the updated cracks. I don't give a shit. You had to register here to post, and complain, why can't you register there to get the updated crack? Make sense?

@boromadnz

Stop screaming like a fag and pay attention. No one said, at least i didn't, that anyone needed to patch 6 or 7 times. It all depends on where their current game is already patched to. The patch in the torrent is old and outdated.

Also, no one is making anyone download World Adventures... it's just a suggestion. As i stated above, the expansions add a lot to a game. So f*ck off already."
,Wuzafish,2011-03-07T22:57Z,"Can anyone help me?

,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-07T23:21Z,"@Wuzafish

Your disk image doesn't have enough space? You're supposed to either burn the ISO, or extract it's contents to a temp folder. After that, you are free to install it.

After it's installed, then you can apply the crack into the game folder and overwrite. You shouldn't need to delete any files to make more space.

Or, are you saying that your HD doesn't have enough room to install the game itself? "

,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-08T00:46Z,"@Wuzafish

Well, someone more knowledgeable on burning can probably help more, as i never burn games, but ImgBurn has never let me down with movies and stuff.

As i stated before, i usually just extract the ISO using MagicISO into a temp folder, install the game from there, then delete the folder when i'm done. If you insist on burning, try ImgBurn(www.imgburn.com), then go from there.

Hope that helps a little."

,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-09T16:21Z,"@irishonion

You don't have to download any expansions... but i find the main game can get a little boring after a while. The expansions for The Sims are actually pretty decent, ie; World adventures adds a lot of extra content like traveling to other exotic destinations, and Late Night let's your Sim become super famous, etc...

There are several ways to install expansions: If you're installing an expansion over an already cracked Sims game, you should definitely replace the original files first(the ones you cracked to play the game). I believe that paradox site has original files as well, so just download them, over write the cracks, then install the expansion, then crack the expansion... meaning, find the cracks for the expansion you just installed, and overwrite the expansion game files. No need to re-crack the main game. Just make sure you START The Sims from the expansion game file as all the games integrate into the MAIN Sims game.

That make sense?

In short, when you install an expansion, or several expansions, find the crack for the LAST expansion you installed, overwrite the expansion game files, and START the game from that(you don't need to start the game from the main game file - as all the expansion game files will start the same game).

The reason why i had people cracking every game was merely to cover any mistakes that might be made if people were not going to install all, or any expansions. That's all.

Lastly, installing the latest expansion will not install the previous ones as they are all separate entities. So just install the ones you want. You can always install more later on as long as you follow the instruction above."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-09T16:32Z,"@boromadnz

Yes, and that's perfectly fine if you're never planning to add any updated patches or install any expansions(as installing any of these over an old cracked patch can cause many problems). But, for those that want to install expansions, use recent mods, and fix any bugs, they should use the newest, and most updated patch. 

No one said this game doesn't work right out of the box - it does... but it will still be outdated."

First of all:

sims 3 install order: -


   1. The Sims 3
   2. The Sims 3: World Adventures
   3. The Sims 3: High-End Loft Stuff
   4. The Sims 3: Ambitions
   5. The Sims 3: Fast Lane Stuff
   6. The Sims 3: Late Night
   7. The Sims 3: Outdoor Living Stuff


If game expansions are installed in this order, any patching related compatibility issues should be avoided.
To install an earlier expansion to your game when a later expansion is already installed (e.g., you wish to install Ambitions when you already have Late Night installed), you will need to uninstall all expansions released after the expansion you wish to install, then reinstall them in the correct order


***Do not do any of the cracks for any of the expansions until the VERY last one you install as each new install will overwrite them, VERY important***

*** Also VERY important, DO not download EA Update Manager. You can untick it or if you didn't see the tick, just say NO when it asks you to install the EA Update Manager - this will stop it from auto updating and again overwriting your cracks ***

Now. lnstall the main game & remember do not 'download ea update manager'.
REMEMBER, DON'T USE THE CRACK. oNLY USE THE CRACK IF YOU INTEND ON ONLY PLAYING THE BASE SIMS 3 GAME WITH NO EXPANSIONS.
Each expansion will say it needs to update to install new expension, this part is ok, so say yes.
Install any other expansions/stuff games without the cracks and by ticking no to install the EA update manager.

Now, once you have every install in the pc, you can now copy and paste the crack from whatever final expensions you download.
Then to play you just use the icon of the last expansion.

vOILA :)"

Have you copied the crack to the game map?"

""it seems like 90% of the people who downloaded it cannot get it to work including me.""

Don't be an idiot. 90%? First off, only about 2% of the people who downloaded this have posted comments here, and out of that 2%, maybe 25% of them have had problems... most were dumb and easy to fix.

So suddenly your 90% of all the people that have ever downloaded this game can't get it to work is, in actuality, about 0.50% of people... which is basically nothing.

If you follow the very simple instructions, the game works flawlessly, when newbs attempt to add a bunch of expansions and patches, and don't know how to follow instructions, then people start to get messed up. Also, everyone's computer is different, it can be about a thousand reasons why one person's install doesn't work.

So how about you stop blaming everyone but yourself and use your head to figure shit out instead of summing up all your ignorance with a statement like ""this download sucks"". No, it sucks for you because you're probably an idiot."

Can tell you this most defininitly works, if you can't get it to work it's probably just your pc or graphics..lets face it ,you need a decent PC. and if it tells you it's not legit then you haven't done the crack or the install right. again refer to page 58."

DL'ed this ages ago, worked fine for months then my sister accidentally tried to update it.

Since then I just can't seem to get it to work for me! Every time I try to start the TS3, the screen goes black as though it's about to start, and the mouse with the blue loading circle comes up, then nothing. It closes itself.

- I've updated my video driver
- updated windows
- checked my Service pack
- blocked sims 3 from the internet
- gotten rid of EA manager
- tried 3 different TS3 torrents
- tried starting the game directly vs the launcher

...nada.

Anyone have any ideas? Much appreciated!"

2)Install Ambitions, WHEN IT ASKS TO UPDATE, DO IT!
3)Install Late Night, WHEN IT ASKS TO UPDATE, DO IT!
As for any other errors I'm not sure! If anything it's most likely a problem with your hard drive or video card.

Hope this helps!"
,silverking789,2011-05-26T17:14Z,does this work on MS Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
,warmachine0092,2011-05-27T20:51Z,its says i dont have athorized disc or something like that can someone please help me
,ytsen13,2011-05-29T14:28Z,"OK here's what i did:

I mounted the image using daemon tools, did the autorun. When i got to the Serial key screen i entered one of the 5 given serials, and it worked perfectly fine.

When i had the game installed, i patched it, using the patch in the torrent. After this i copy pasted the crack into the Sims 3 folder in the program files. 

If you want the game to work, you have to run it using the TS3 launcher, so make a shortcut on your desktop.


(@silverking, yes it does)
(@warmachine, this will solve your problem)"

MOUNT - To climb or ascend.

SOMETIMES WHAT'S IN THE RAR FILE IS THE ""ISO"" SO U NEED TO ""MOUNT"" IT, 

OR SOMETIMES WHEN U EXTRACT THE RAR FILE THE INSTALLATION SET-UP IS ALREADY THERE SO U DON'T NEED TO ""MOUNT"" IT.

,asherkaye,2011-07-07T16:29Z,"I know there's lots of instructions on this torrent telling how to install it, but it sucks looking through all these pages so here's how I did it:

Mounting:

1. Make sure you have Daemon Tools Lite (free download from the Daemon Tools website)

2. Once installed, open Daemon Tools and click ""Add Device"" (hard drive with green + sign). This creates a virtual drive on your computer (your computer sees a disk drive that is not actually there). 

3. Drag the .iso file from the directory where you saved your Sims 3 copy (The Sims 3 - Razor1911 MAXSPEED yadda yadda yadda...) to Daemon tools and it will appear on the list of disc images. 

4. With the .iso highlighted in Daemon tools, click the green play button (""Mount"") and the .iso will appear on the virtual drive and run like an actual disc. 

From here, follow regular installation instructions. 

Installing: 

1. When prompted for a serial key, either use one from the comments on this page, or download a Sims 3 keygen from TPB (search and you'll find a few) and use a serial generated from there (I recommend doing this). 

2. Finish installing regularly. 

3. Before running TS3, go to the ""Final Version Patch"" directory and run the patch by double clicking it. This will update the game for you.

4. Once this is done, go to the Crack directory and copy the 2 files (TS3.exe and TSLHost.dll) to the Game directory (the directory where you installed the game - usually C:/Program Files/The Sims 3). Make sure you Copy and Replace (overwrite) the other files. 

Et voila! Enjoy the game!"

If you want to patch up to version 1.12.70 (the lowest patch version required for CC), you must download EVERY PATCH between your current version and the desired version, and install them IN ORDER. If you try to skip any, you'll just end up with a ""File not found/invalid"" error.

!!! If you receive a region error, you downloaded the wrong patch. IMPORTANT: DO NOT JUST CHANGE THE SKU VALUE IN REGEDIT. Doing this will just result in a lot of ""File not found/invalid"" errors. (If you're curious as to why, it's because the different regional versions have different file and folders names. Changing the SKU value in regedit tricks the patch into thinking it has the right version, but it won't be able to find the folders/files in order to update them.) If you're using the Razor torrent, you want to download the ""Worldwide"" patches. If not, you can easily check to see what region your version is from: just open the game launcher and check the version number at the bottom. If it ends in ""01"", you have the English version. If it ends in ""02"", you have the Worldwide version. Download the proper patches accordingly.

!!! If, by chance, you have the right regional patch, haven't changed anything in regedit, and are still receiving ""File not Found/invalid"" errors, download Delphy's PatchLogViewer (http://www.modthesims.info/showthread.php?t=350186) and run it. This will tell you what files are causing the problems. To fix it, copy the files corresponding to the broken ones over from the ISO and replace them.

3) Once you're all patched up, find yourself a crack for the proper version. If you're just looking to be able to use CC, and don't care about future patches, then just patch your game up to 1.12.70 and then use this crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5616554/The.Sims.3.Update.1.12.70-ViTALiTY-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D

!!! BEFORE USING THE CRACK, MAKE A BACK UP OF THE TS3.EXE AND TSLHOST.DLL FILES. This way, if you decide later on that you want to patch up even farther, you can remove the cracks and replace them with the originals. You won't be able to patch the game if the crack is in place!

4) Load up and enjoy. If you're looking to install CC, use this guide to start: http://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Installing_Sims_3_Package_Files/Setup_and_Files"

,alleexo,2011-07-12T10:23Z,"If you're getting disk authorization failures, it's probably because you've updated to a more current version than the patch that's included. I think you can solve this by making sure to NOT download the EA Download Manager.

,virtueflor,2011-07-21T02:13Z,"Okay, so this seems really complicated and scary to me at first, too, because I had never downloaded and installed a game before.  BUT, it's actually really simple, so if you're confused, just follow these steps:

1. Google ""Alcohol 120%""...I actually downloaded Alcohol 52%, a completely free version from their site, and that worked just fine.
2. Once in Alcohol 52%/120%, click ""virtual drive"" to enable 1-6 virtual drives.  When it appears in the bottom, right click on your new virtual drive and ""mount image"" will be an option.  Click it, then go into this torrent download and click the iso file from the Razor1911 file.  You have now mounted the image as described in step 1 of the install notes.
3. Continue onto step 2 of install notes, which is to get a key.  I got mine from a keygen generator I downloaded from TPB.  Just search ""the sims 3 keygen"" and you will find one.
4. Let the program finish installing.
5. When finished, go into the Final Version Patch folder and double-click the file to install.
6. Once that is installed, go into the file named Crack, copy both those files, and then go to Program Files>Electronic Arts>The Sims 3>Game>Bin and paste them.  Tell it to Copy and Replace
7. Click the launcher, et voila!

Thanks!!"

First of all, you should properly erase everything you've got that is copied from TPB or any other sharing network. And I don't mean just a format and reinstall, but a complete wipe of the drives. Even better if you are able to get rid of your harddrives entirely, tossing them where no one will ever find them after you've either put them through your microwave or done a few proper wipes.
Second, deny having downloaded anything and hope they don't pursue this matter. Cause if they show up at your door, you might be looking at an law suit, of magnitudes whitch would take you two life times to pay down. 
Third, Change your ISP who obviously gave away your personal information to a private company, this is in many countries illegal and you might be able to sue them because of this, but I would not count on it. 
Fourth, good luck!

And now for my own needs. Any members of the scene who reads this, I would love to see a The Sims 3 collection with an auto install. Kinda like the sims 1 had. Think the pack was called sims all in one or something like that. That way it would be correctly installed and everything would work as it should. No need to download one hundred different scene versions and hope that one of those versions worked together with each other. If anyone out there could make that, I would be forever greatfull and seed the file for weeks or months on end no matter how large the file is. Currently I am sporting an 20/20 Mbps line which I will use to seed this monster release if it ever comes out."

I had a similar problem, just check that the whole iso file is extracted from the rar. 

I would also like to add the FAT32 system cant support files bigger than 4 gig, and the iso turns out to be 5.something. (A lot of external harddrives tend to automatically be in FAT32, a solution would be to change it to NTFS, or have the iso on your C drive.

Does any of this help?

Try installing it with your internet turned off, and if it works then make sure you add firewalls, and load it from the TS3.exe"

1) download
2) install by mounting the iso file with d-tools or w/e you prefer (serials in the readme file)
3) download this patch : http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/Sims3_1.4.6.00002_from_1.0.631.00002.exe

4) run the patch, should just run fine
5) get into your bin folder and backup these files: ts3.exe, TSLHOST.ddl (I recommend to just create a folder with the name backup or whatsoever and paste them there).

6) Copy the cracked files from the razor folder you just downloaded and paste them into the bin folder and obviously overwrite, now play by starting ts3.exe and not the simslauncher.

7) waste millions of minutes by creating pointless fires in every house you can find.

p.s. if you want to install expansions just place the backed up files back and then install those, whe done just crack it again."

4) download and run this patch aswell:

5) get into your bin folder and backup these files: ts3.exe, TSLHOST.dll (I recommend to just create a folder with the name backup or whatsoever and paste them there).

6) paste tslhost.dll from your torrent folder (found in /crack) into your sims 3 folder (game/bin/)

7) download this ts3.exe which is the cracked version of 1.7.9 and paste it there aswell(overwrite when needed)

8) start sims by running ts3.exe, not simslauncher

I resolved this by copying the whole extracted Sim3 folder from the BD-ROM drive and into my computer's internal C-drive into a new folder (just label it as TS3), afterwards the copy-pasting Crack files process can be easily carried out. Make sure you've got more than enough space on your C-drive, and also don't forget to delete the contents of C/Program Files/Electronic Arts/Sims3 to avoid duplicate space consumption  on your internal C-drive."

For the no disk found, you simply have to run the iso while attempting to turn on the Sims 3. Run it in something like Daemon Tools.

For the invalid copy error; follow these instructions (instead of what is in the ""readme"" file)

1. Install game as instructed, using ISO and serial number. Make sure you say you want EA Download Manager.

2. After installed, run the Final Version Patch first.

3. Replace the cracked TS3.exe file with the original (specific instructions on how to do so is in the readme)

4. You don't have to bother with the .dll file.

5. Run the game by clicking on the cracked TS3.exe file in the Bin folder. 

6. Play the game! If it helps, make a shortcut on your desktop for easier access."

I think something may have gone wrong when after installing expansion it said it needed to update base game to work properly. So I did. Now nothing works. But game does work on wifes lappy fine.

I tried a complete uninstall and reinstall fresh, without any expansions and base game still will not run. Its not hard to install (mount iso - install game - enter key - copy over files from crack folder - run ts3.exe - enjoy.

I do not crack games unless i really need to.  I just run the game by mounting it every time i play the game.  

What i notice from the sims 3 and other regions is that they have small difference.  For example one of the sims game give you selection of music to enable or disable, ect.  *Please anybody that can confirm this let me know.*

,Staleningrad,2011-11-05T00:47Z,"Seems people are having are still having trouble installing this.  First of all, the .rar is NOT a mountable ISO, I dunno why people think it is.  You'll get an error if you install it via mounting.  I'll list some steps:

1.  Extract files to a location you can easily find.

2.  Run the file ""Sims3Setup"" to begin the installation.

3.  When prompted for the verification, open up the folder labeled ""Razor1911"" and open the file ""The_Sims_3_Keygen"" and type in the game key it gives you.

4.  Let the setup finish the installation.

5.  Patch the game FIRST before using the crack.  There is only one patch in the file, but you can find a program that will install every patch up to game version 1.26 here, all you have to do is create a quick, free account: http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=409829

6.  COPY these files from the ""Razor1911 Final MAXSPEED\Crack"" folder: ""TS3"" and ""TSLHost.dll""

7.  When prompted to move and replace, click yes for both.  This will crack the game and remove the CD authentication.  Start the game from the TS3 file you just moved from the crack, you can create a shortcut on your desktop if you want to access it faster.

8. Enjoy

~Staleningrad

8.  Start the application from the TS3"
,Staleningrad,2011-11-05T00:57Z,"Seems people are still having problems installing the game, I'll make a guide that's as newbie-friendly as possible:

1.  EXTRACT the .rar to a location where you can easily find it, do NOT mount it.

2.  Run the ""Sims3Setup"" inside the ""The Sims 3 - Razor1911"" folder.

3.  When prompted for the key, open up the folder ""Razor 1911"" and click ""The_Sims_3_Keygen"" this is the keygen.  Just start it up and enter the key that it gives you.

4.  When that is finished, you may want to patch the game.  I HIGHLY recommend this because the EA Downloader is annoying and you may get errors from its installer.  I even hunted down a program that will automatically install ALL patches for the game up to the most recent one, here is the link, all you have to do is create a free account on the website: http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=409829

5.  After you have finished patching, locate the ""Crack"" folder it should be under the folder ""The Sims 3 - Razor1911 Final MAXSPEED"".  Now, COPY those two files (TS3 and TSLHost.dll) and paste them into the Bin folder of your Sims 3 directory.  Mine was ""C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin"".  When prompted to Move and Replace, do so.

6.  Start the game from the ""TS3"" file that you just moved over and enjoy your game.

,Teuthras,2011-11-11T05:11Z,"@kiosks

The .iso file is what the autorun and setup files are contained in. If you're using WinRAR, it's likely coming up as a WinRAR Archive since it can be used for that. Just mount that file in Daemon Tools, or whatever program you use, and install."

,UniWoozle,2011-11-24T19:12Z,"The iso is too big to burn to my 4.7gb dvd, and when I do mount it files are missing so my installation is incomplete. What can I do about this?"
,SammyE89,2011-11-25T20:20Z,"To everyone that is getting ""disk authorization"" errors, you NEED to download a No-CD patch. Just google ""no-cd sims 3"" it is the first result! You might need to try a few of them, and you need one that replaces the game's .exe file (found in program files/electronic arts/sims 3/game/bin) replace the TS3 file there with the one you downloaded.

Secondly, it is NORMAL for the keygen to come up as a virus. This guy is a green skull, you think he'd have that if his shit had viruses? If you're worried, DON'T USE the keygen. It is not required. There are plenty of serials on the internet if YOU GOOGLE IT, once again.

DO NOT UPDATE YOUR GAME AFTER YOU'VE CRACKED IT. IT WON'T WORK.

And finally, all these n00bs on here, asking how to mount things and where the iso is, try reading the fucking directions first. If you haven't figured it out, you need a program that emulates disks, namely DAEMON TOOLS (free for light v. and thats all you need!). The thing you need to mount is in the ""sims 3 razor folder"", right under final v. patch and the crack folders.

IF YOU USE WINRAR IT WILL SHOW UP AS A WINRAR ICON. NORMAL, ONCE AGAIN.

go 2 daemon tools, right click on the virtual drives, click mount and then find the previously mentioned iso image and instal the game.

AFTER using keygen (located in the iso image under Razor1911, will need to use winrar for that) for a working serial or googling for one, AFTER the game is installed, run the final version patch. THEN go 2 the crack folder and copy the contents.

THEN, go 2 program files/electronic arts/sims 3/game/bin and PASTE, yes to overwrite/replace. 

And there you go. If you get a disk authorization failure do like I said before. DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS FOOL ""ACE"" ABOUT DOWNLOADING WORLD ADVENTURES, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT SHIT. THAT IS A FUCKING WASTE OF SPACE.

A lot of people are complaining about how to get all the Sims 3 working together so I thought this may help - I used Daemon Tools Lite to mount the images - unzipped with winrar when necessary - installed, using the keygen provided* and updated and applied cracks and patches when advised, these are generally found on opening your computer > right clicking the iso you can see loaded into your BD-ROM Drive > Open/Explore and locating the folder that shouldnt be there ie: fairlight/razor1911 etc this is also where you will find most keygens. 
I installed all perfectly on my laptop first time, also installed the base game and the Pets expansion on both of my nieces laptops, working perfectly, although one has the pets graphic issues where they have weird chins and legs! If anyone knows a fix to this please help :)

to the trojan whinners....  if you would look at who youre d/l from (one of the most well-known uploaders on thepiratebay) you would realize youre stupid... unless youre just too ...  well stupid.

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!

I thought and tried to maybe see if I could delete or move the files I'm going to replace anyways and can't even do that. Never had this problem before. Whats going on with that?

,twwfttm,2012-07-11T13:59Z,"Okay guys. I thought this was really hard but its actually very simple!

STEP ONE:
--------------------
Dowload this... Clearly. 

STEP TWO:
--------------------
Download ""DAEMON Tools"" and install

STEP THREE:
--------------------
Go to the folder this was downloaded to, open the folder ""DVD-the sims ""  then open the file called ""Sims3"" (the icon should now be the DAEMON logo instead of a photo icon)

This should run as a normal Sims setup.

STEP FOUR:
--------------------
Go back to the  ""The Sims 3"" folder, go in to ""Crack"" and open the rld-sim3 app, get one of the codes then copy and paste it in the Sims setup and finish the installation.

And now you're done! 
Hope this helped :) "

Secondly don't give Razor or ExtremeZone any grief, if it wasn't for them you wouldn't have sims3

How to properly get this game working

1. Install Game
2. Patch Game
3. Copy Crack
4. enjoy.

( As always with any game patch before you crack
not the other way around )

If you want to update then your going to have to find updated patches with cracks.

And if you still haven't figured out how to run this
you need to download daemon tools and mount the image"

,Mealatus,2012-07-16T18:03Z,"Girls and Boys,

This is how you install sims 3 + ALL THE expansions. (This worked for me anyway..)

Download and install sims 3. (i presume you people know how to do this.) UPDATE, UPDATE, UPDATE.

So basically just keep updating your base game untill you no longer can. Get the correct crack at:  thesimstg.com (they're fast + fast with new cracks as well)

Then, install the lastest expansion, (Diesel ritte now) 

If possible update Again. Check without copying the crack from diesel to your main game bin folder if it still works. If so, u're in.

I have been relentlessly searching for all the right cracks and guides and shit. Never worked. This however worked. No installation order bullshit, just update the base game, install the lastest expansion, update again, check if it works, (it will) and boom. U can keep adding expansions (i'd check every time to make sure) WITHOUT even having to crack it.  Voila, lemme know what u guys think."

I believe the antivirus companies are paid to tell it's users that certain cracks and keygens contain malware. Regardless if that's true or not, it's wrong that there's any malware in it."
,AtotehZ,2012-07-19T13:18Z,"I saw 2 people here who didn't know what ""mounting"" means.

What you are actually downloading here is a DVD that has been transferred to the computer. 

The best format for doing that is making a so-called image. These images has to be read by your computer to be of any use. 

What you do to read them is similar to putting a disc in your DVD drive. You download a program that makes a ""virtual drive"", meaning a drive that only exists inside your computer. This could be a number of different programs:

DaemonTools, Alcohol120%, Magic-iso and the list goes on.

You open the program and find the DVD file you downloaded it through the program. Now it is mounted and you can install it as if you had a disc in your disc-drive"

And for updating read the above comments.  I dont know why they made it so damn difficult to update games ect.  Also try installing the expansions pack in order if you dont know what game first google it.  

Once you download a expansion pack or dont want to have any other ones just delete the expansion but save the ISO image.  You need that to play and to ""pretend"" you have the game.  "

This is what I done!

4.Go to program files, find electronic arts and click Sims 3 folder

5. Then go to download folder and copy whats inside the crack folder to Electronic Arts/Sims 3/Game/bin (overwrite files)

6.Then launch game from TS3 in Game/bin NOT LAUNCHER
