,vanmann,2009-07-30T03:47Z,"WOW, you don want much do ya, lmao. "
,unidentified2008,2009-07-30T04:45Z,"Don't expect them all at once of course, but wow, HolyRoses sure knows how to rip properly so why ask any other :) "
,greatsunrise,2009-07-30T06:28Z,"@ unidentified2008, if you look at some of his past posts..you will find some of these movies."
,unidentified2008,2009-07-30T14:22Z,"I looked thru all past posts, could only find around 2 -3 of them.

-Inkheart is there, my mistake...
-Hancock was an R5, but DVD been released since this?
-Slumdog Millionaire, can only find an iPod DVD?

All the others I don't see any HolyRoses rips of :)"
,unidentified2008,2009-07-30T14:25Z,"U mention also u use encode-handheld.pl v4.8 to encode... on Linux?

Is there any .m4v encoder that can give similar results for Windows without too much hassle?"
,unidentified2008,2009-08-01T18:02Z,"Okay did a complete second sweep of all movies I'd requested just to check what was there and what wasn't.

Apart from those I already mentioned I had found there is also:

-Slumdog Millionaire DVDSCR (but DVDRip has been released since this?)
-I Am Legend

...which along with those I already mentioned that's about all I can find out of that request list of HolyRoses rips.

I think that makes about 5, out of a list of around 50 :("
