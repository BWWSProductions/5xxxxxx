Carson hosts from the famed KCRW radio station in Santa Monica, CA.

Guests: the comic Rob Huebel who creates zany skits for Funny Or Die, the dedicated whale-saving Capt. Paul Watson (Whale Wars on Animal Planet), and the punk rock band Green Day with one of its performances this week on Last Call, the already-classic track 21 Guns from their album 21st Century Breakdown
