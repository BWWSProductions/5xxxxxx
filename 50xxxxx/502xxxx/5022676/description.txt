When the family business is fire, and you canâ€™t handle the heat, itâ€™s time to look for a new line of work â€“ and maybe a new family, too. 
Kazuma is a descendent of an ancient clan skilled in the magical Fire Arts. Unfortunately for him, the gift seems to have skipped a generation. Defeated by his younger, female cousin, Ayano, in a battle to become the clanâ€™s successor, Kazuma is exiled with only the smoldering burn of failure to keep him company. But now heâ€™s back, risen from the ashes and armed with a powerful new mojo thatâ€™s sure to fan the flames of the family rivalry. The cooler he gets â€“ the hotter she burns, and when Wind and Fire collide, Tokyo is caught in the eye of the storm.
