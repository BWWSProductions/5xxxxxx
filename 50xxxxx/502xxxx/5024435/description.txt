Ep Summary:

Hungarian.
Jake Humphrey presents live coverage of the Hungarian Grand Prix from the Hungaroring
in Budapest. Lewis Hamilton started the race in pole position 12 months ago, but it
was his McLaren team-mate, Heikki Kovalainen, who crossed the line in first place to
claim his maiden Formula 1 victory. Brazilian Felipe Massa had looked every inch the
winner until he suffered a spectacular engine failure with just three laps remaining.
Jenson Button was a lap behind most of the field and finished 12th.
