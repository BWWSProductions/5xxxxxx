I did HIT and never looked back. 3 times a week, 30 highly intense minutes each work out and the muscle gains were staggering. My arms have never been smaller than 22 inches, my thighs added 2 inches in one year and have never been below 32"" since.

Check Arthur Jones or Dr. Darden for more guidance. But Mentzer was wrong. 1 workout every 2 weeks is not going to work for 99.9999% of the people."
