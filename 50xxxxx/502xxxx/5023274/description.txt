Allmusic.com review:
"The double-disc set Anthology contains all of Diana Ross' solo hits for Motown Records, from "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" to "Endless Love." It's a comprehensive collection, featuring all of her biggest hits plus many important album tracks and smaller hit singles. Since it doesn't delve too deeply into obscurities and contains all of Ross' most popular songs, Anthology is the definitive career compilation for fans who want more than just the standard cuts but are unwilling to explore the original albums or invest in the box set."
