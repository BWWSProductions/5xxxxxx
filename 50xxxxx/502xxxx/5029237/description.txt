Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) Desktop i386 FLASH IMAGE

This is a simple conversion of the Ubuntu ISO to an .img file suitable for installation from a USB flash disk.

This is not the netbook remix, but can be installed just like the netbook remix (ie, from a thumbdrive)

I have a blog post describing how it was created here:
