Damn Small is small enough and smart enough to do the following things: 
   Boot from a business card CD as a live linux distribution (LiveCD) 
   Boot from a USB pen drive 
   Boot from within a host operating system (that's right, it can run *inside* Windows) 
   Run very nicely from an IDE Compact Flash drive via a method we call "frugal install" 
   Transform into a Debian OS with a traditional hard drive install 
   Run light enough to power a 486DX with 16MB of Ram 
   Run fully in RAM with as little as 128MB (you will be amazed at how fast your computer can be!) 
   Modularly grow -- DSL is highly extendable without the need to customize 



DSL was originally developed as an experiment to see how many usable desktop applications can fit inside a 50MB live CD. It was at first just a personal tool/toy. But over time Damn Small Linux grew into a community project with hundreds of development hours put into refinements including a fully automated remote and local application installation system and a very versatile backup and restore system which may be used with any writable media including a hard drive, a floppy drive, or a USB device.
