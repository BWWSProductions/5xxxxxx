Den fantastiska Caramelldansen med nÃ¥gra nakna dansande flickor!

Here's some movie clip I clipped together, showing the Caramelldansen song with some naked dancing girls.

Not pornographic in the strict sense, since it contains nudity but no sexually explicit content. Still posting in this category because I got banned when I posted it as "Music Video"...
So, on the whole totally harmless, though PG of course might still be appropriate for anti-nudistically raised kids.

The song is Caramelldansen from the Swedish band Caramell's album "Supergott", the normal (non-speedycake) version. Just search on you tube. I just thought this song deserved more than endless-loop-manga-animations. Was banned from there also :)
The girls are from the free video samples of naturist "documentary" films at holynature.ru.
The clip is dedicated to beauty, in the sense of aesthetics. And to Caramell of course.

Sing & dance along :)
