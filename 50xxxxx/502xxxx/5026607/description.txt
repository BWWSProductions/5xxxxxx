Review taken from metal-observer.com:
What a way to launch a career.
Hailing from the cutthroat Los Angeles Rock/Metal scene, five musicians from various parts of the United States, after many years of playing for ill-fated projects, all wound up in this one band: GUNS Nâ€™ ROSES.
They proceeded to write the soundtrack of their lives and their environment. A cutthroat environment full of backstabbing, politics, selfishness and lawlessness. The daily struggle to survive while still attempting to achieve greatness. Men living reckless lives of debauchery and self-destruction. The mindset of somebody who needs drugs to survive. A world where one would not know if he or she would see their friends the following day, as their lives are just as reckless, and the worry that it engenders. The hopes of men trying breaking out of the hell they have put themselves through in order to achieve their dreams, and them latching on to their more innocent memories.
This exposed the Rock/Metal scene of Los Angeles for what it truly was: A desperate climate full of naÃ¯ve souls and hustlers looking to screw them at every corner, where violence, drugs and cheap sex were rampant. They showed all the insidious dealings and the obvious hedonism. They redefined what it was to be a bad-ass band, and revolutionized the Rock world.
Not to say that their world is totally bleak, though. Brief moments of hope and sincerity are sprinkled throughout the album (â€œSweet Child Oâ€™ Mineâ€, â€œThink About Youâ€), showing that their world is not completely bleak, that the folks stuck in this world of hell do have some goodness to them.
Thatâ€™s why GUNS Nâ€™ ROSES succeeded. Amidst all the bullshit of the mainstream Rock world, here came five dudes that tore down genres, mixing together Glam Metal with the fury of Thrash and the feeling of Blues, with uncompromising attitude and emotion.
Itâ€™s no surprise that the music found on this record is deceptively complex, as their very competent musicians. Yea, they may have been wasted or coked out of their minds, but the music found herein has much subtlety to it, with many discrepancies and nuances within the melodies, while still having immense amount of balls and intensity. The rhythm section is very solid as well, reminiscent of the great rhythm players of the 70s, but a lot more restrained.
Top it off with the vocals of Axl Rose. Say what you want about the manâ€™s ego or his antics (chances are Iâ€™d agree with you), but GUNS Nâ€™ ROSES would not have succeeded with anybody else. He had an unrivaled passion in his voice, managing to convey hatred, apathy (the â€œI-wrecked-three-cars-today-and-I-couldnâ€™t-care-lessâ€ kind, not the going-through-the-motions-kindâ€), sorry, nostalgia, rage and hope, and he is able to use his many singing voices to propel the mood of the song and its speaker forward.
The lyrics both reflect the personal lives of the members of GNR, and hint at the Axlâ€™s volatile nature. Lyrics about misogyny (â€œItâ€™s So Easyâ€, though now, that one part just makes me laugh. Look it up if you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about) and Axlâ€™s paranoid nature (â€œOut Ta Get Meâ€) are just foreshadowing some of the content he delves into on the â€œUse Your Illusionâ€ albums, and possibly his attitude within and towards the media. I donâ€™t even have to MENTION what he did to the band halfway through the 90s, do I (if youâ€™ve been living under a rock, just look it up ;-) )?
This album was GUNS Nâ€™ ROSES at its most down and dirty, before getting (over?) ambitious with the â€œUse Your Illusionâ€ double album. They did it like no other, and they did it the best. I like the UYI albums, but this shows what they can do while on the throes of desperation.
You probably have an opinion about this album, considering itâ€™s one of the most important in the history of modern music, and especially Rock & Heavy Metal. For me, GUNS Nâ€™ ROSES were the first band I got into, and their albums hold a very special place in my heart.
