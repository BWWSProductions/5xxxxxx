The Piratebay is being sold and will no longer be tracking free torrents. Tentative sale date is August 8th - bookmark the link below so you can find O&A. Even if this sale doesn't happen - the owners are willing to sell which means tpb could cease to exist in it's current form at some point. Be ready for that day right now.
