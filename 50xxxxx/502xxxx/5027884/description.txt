Brubaker does it again, this time in movie form. A violent, action-packed, compelling revenge/vigilante story with great performances and fun characters. I've seen others compare it to La Femme Nikita and Alias (odd, the only other female assassin stories that quickly come to mind. If there is a male assassin in a movie is it an imitation of The Mechanic? Or is that only if there is a female in the lead role?) but this film easily stands on it's own. Gratuitous and darkly humorous violence mixed with a engrossing story of a killer who develops a conscience.
