,BoonesFerry,2010-03-22T07:17Z,"you can downlaod a zip file containing the english subs at http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/101660/auschwitz-the-nazis-and-the-final-solution-en

note however the subs are only of the narator and not the background or speaches that are in german"
,Big_Blue_Monkey,2010-08-19T23:20Z,"It was never intended that you understand what is said between the actors portraying the german officers and soldiers, not unless you understand german that is, everything you need to know is either told by the narrator or through the performance and situations presented by the actors. If you need everything spelled out for you rather than taking in what you see and judging the scenes then this isnt for you."

[T],winto_bungle,2012-02-09T17:41Z,"@Big_Blue_Monkey how wrong you are. 

there is a scene in the first episode where the narrator sets up a discussion by the nazis and says that the following words are taken from a real transcript. the scene plays out for about 4 mins in german, and the narrator doesnt tell you what was said. i would be very suprised if the aim was for the audience to not understand this entire scene, plus many others."
