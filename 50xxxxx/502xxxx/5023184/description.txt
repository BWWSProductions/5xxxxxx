*As noted, "Hurdles Even Here" (track 14 under "The Crane Wife") is slightly cut off at the end due to a flaw in an earlier Decemberists discography torrent, but everything else is complete.  Also, note that "Dark Was The Night" is a 2-disc multi-artist compilation album, and "Sleepless" is the only Decemberists track on it.  Please seed!*
