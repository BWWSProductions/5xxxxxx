MacUpdate:

Times is a new type of newsreader for Mac OS X Leopard. Instead of treating news like email (as most RSS readers do), Times presents you with headlines and photos from a variety of sources all in one place, letting you more easily discover the news you want to read. Like your own personal newspaper, you can put feeds into separate areas, create pages for different subjects, and more.

App + Serial.

Leopard Only.
