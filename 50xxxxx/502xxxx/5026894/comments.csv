,cj_,2009-10-03T08:40Z,"Indeed, the first episode is broken at 26:13 and it also lacks an AVI index (which prevents seeking).  The AVI index is written after encoding completes, so it's pretty obvious this one errored out half way through.  If you look at the file in a hex editor, the second half of it is just NULL bytes.. no data there.

Rest of the torrent is fine, good quality, etc., but you need to get the pilot (part 1) elsewhere."
,neoteo,2009-10-04T16:21Z,"yep ,  episode 1 doesnt work

if someone could upload one that works and paste the link here would be awsome.

This compilation should be complete !"

,frantz22,2009-12-05T21:55Z,Are these from DVDs or are they TV rips? One idea for people who are downloading slow: set the first episodes to highest priority so they download the quickest. That way you can start watching sooner.

,Fox_Almighty,2010-07-19T20:23Z,"/Lost Season 1/Lost - S01E02 - Pilot (Part 2).avi has a malware on it... After having it partially downloaded, Avast detected it as a virus, I of course ignored it cuz well, how is it possible to get a virus from .avi right? Anyway I researched and of course it confirmed telling me it's basically a false positive and any virus that could go into an .avi extension is harmless... Well, 10 minutes later, Antimalware Doctor installed itself (which is known as a pretty big virus), and I of course panicked and set Avast to do a boot time scan and I restarted only to find out it's too late, windows wouldn't run, avast wouldn't run... dead.

I then formatted, re-installed windows, and tried downloading this torrent once again cuz I thought maybe there's a chance that a virus from somewhere else just attached itself to the .avi, but nope... file reached 65% downloaded and WHAM!, Avast detected it again, this time I deleted it and the torrent before it started up again.

There are other torrents out there with that episode, I can't vouch for the rest, but Season 1 episode 1 part 2 is a bad file to download. I'll be downloading from someone else from now on.

And plz, no bashing at my comment, I know it sounds ridiculous that my computer got infected by a .avi file but there's really no way I can prove it, I can just make the warning and then ""walk away"" hoping someone listens."

,matt0678,2010-10-31T19:44Z,Works great! As true with the other comments the first episode of the first season is screwy but you can get that on iTunes for free in HD.
,Shafi107,2010-12-11T09:26Z,"Plzzz SEEED!!!

,jubear,2010-12-15T03:55Z,"Okay so I am new to torrents. Have downloaded utorrent and transmissions (for mac) and deciding which I like better. I am getting a VERY slow download speed for lost, any advice? Also, read a few comments talking about ratios etc and opening up to seed. Could someone explain what I have to do to not be selfish lol?

Thank you!"
,FRivera,2011-01-05T12:24Z,10x ezme great quality v9 a9. dl a bit slow - average speed ~40 Kb/s.
,Spree2009,2011-01-08T13:50Z,"Season 3
Episode 23 (Through the Looking Glass Part2) not working. I downloaded it a few times since it refuses to be played by any of my players while i got all the codecs yet none seem to work"
,redtar,2011-03-28T01:47Z,"For those of you having trouble with S03E23 part 2, you can use VLC if you have a mac and possibly a windows(unsure of that though) and click repair.  It works then.  That worked for me at least.  Also, would everyone seed a bit more.  I've been seeding up the wazoo forever.  I will seed this when it finishes.  If we all seed it will go faster for everyone.  

Thank you.  Props to EZME."

,smurfmurfet,2011-07-20T15:35Z,Averaging 101KB/s. Good work guys. 46% after 3 days. Not bad.
,cardshark11,2011-10-20T19:07Z,what a joke its impossible 2 get lost season 5 because nobody will fcking seed
,Gr8BSer,2011-11-27T03:51Z,"Those of you that complain about the D/L speed check your settings, either your not opening up your U/L speed or your history shows that you yourself do not seed. I just finished this torrent with an avg. speed of 954KB (thats bytes not bits (KB=kb*8)) off 7 seeders. I know it is easier to blame others, but look at yourself first. I bet you get home from the store and b**** about how hard they made it for you to shoplift the crap you got. "
,dsblink182,2012-02-22T17:08Z,"Please seed everyone, it's been 20 hrs and I'm only at 10%"
