,heretic0,2009-08-03T18:36Z,"What made me hate this movie: 
when skynet finally captured john connor's father (whom they were so obsessed to kill), they locked him up in a room instead of terminating him immediately.

What made this movie the worst sequel: 
The terminators were merely toyminators tossing their main targets around. Toss, toss, toss... 

What made this movie so unoriginal: 
the cyborg's (marcus wright's) role in this film kinda reminded me of schwarzenegger's role in Total Recall. The writers of this sequel tried to put a twist in the story, but then again, its just another cliche.

What made me watch this movie:
it's fcking free."

,eastsider_roadrunner_com,2009-09-01T09:20Z,"My opinion of this movie: It was good, but seriously, if they don't get it right by the next part then the franchise is going to $%!&.  They need to stick to the original series storyline and not t.v. it out with the cheapness, let's see some war scenes like in the old flashbacks from part 1."
