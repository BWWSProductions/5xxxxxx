Allmusic.com review:
"A splendid 41-song set featuring Diana Ross' best recordings with the Supremes, along with Motown and post-Motown solo recordings. This is a very comprehensive and thoughtfully chosen package. The selections run the gamut from "Where Did Our Love Go" to "Love Hangover" to "I'm Coming Out" to Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers' "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" and Michael Jackson's "Muscles." It features her duets with Lionel Richie and Marvin Gaye, "Endless Love" and "You Are Everything," respectively, and "I'm Gonna Make You Love," a duet with Eddie Kendricks credited as Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations. Ross' compelling soprano is often imitated, but has never been duplicated as successfully by anybody, and that includes her namesake, Jackie Ross ("Selfish One"). This is as good as it gets. Compiling a more complete and pleasing package with the same number of tracks to work with will never happen. The circus-sounding "The Happening" is a nuisance, but you can skip or program it out entirely if it bothers you."
