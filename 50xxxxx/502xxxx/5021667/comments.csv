Just back up your memcard and do the whole Magic stick + pandora thing again to update to CFW latest version, that should work just fine right? then transfer your memcard files back and you should be golden, I'm no expert but that sounds like it should work to me.

@MemiBH do you have 'WipEout Pulse' i think its called?"
