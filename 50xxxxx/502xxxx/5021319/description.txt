[Lyrics]

We are livin' in a police state 
Situations getting grave 
Right now 
I'm takin' it 


We are livin' in a police state 
More than your rights at stake 
Right Now 
I'm takin' it 


Heaters got my town 
Infiltratin' the air yeah 
Locking down the masses 
Even to scare ya 
We don't have to deal with this shit 
To serve and protect yo I ain't buying it. 


Do it for the power 
They're abusing the glory 
Strip away the badge 
And you'll still be out 
_____ (next two lines I have NO idea what Alex says) 
Fightin' the fight for the people right. 


We are, livin' in a police state 
Situations getting grave 
Right now 
It's over yeah. 


We are, livin' in a police state 
More than your rights at stake 
Right now 
I'm takin' it. 


Get ready cuz its time to go 
Heaters movin' in and before you know it 
They've got us all surrounded 
The call has been sounded 
This is how its goin' down tonight. 


Tonight now we set things right 
And besides who'd wanna live and die 
In this mess we made 
Its so depraved 
What happened to my freedom 
And you'll find me 
Lying on the floor 
Thinking about war 
Thinking about war 
Don't wanna do this anymore 
They paraded 
I'll be waiting for 
The perfect time to strike (cool echo) 


We are livin' in a police state (we are) 
Situations getting grave (we are) 
Right now (we are) 
We are takin' it 


We are livin' in a police state 
More than your rights at stake 
Right now 
I'm takin' it. 


Right now (we are) its on (we are) oh yeah 
We are.
