With Robert Llewellyn as the host throughout this first season there's only a 'Yellow' and 'Orange' team. 

The Yellow team consists this 'week' of Major Dick Strawbridge, Kali Monroe, Dave Price and guest specialist John Kilgour. 

The Orange team consists this 'week' of Anne Saunders, Richard 'Bowser' Munson, Shen Chiu and guest specialist Mark Pacey.

The challenge : build a power pulling tug-of-war machine.

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. So please, do your part.
