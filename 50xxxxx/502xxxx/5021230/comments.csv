I watched it on the BBC when ir originally aired and Professor Kaku explains in laymens terms the nature of time very entertainingly.

If you ever wanted to understand Einstein's theory or indeed anything else with respect to this most elusive of nature's elements then the programmes will fully educate you."
,Deucalion2008,2009-07-28T17:58Z,"SORRY to say that for a BBC documentary on time, a lot of TIME is wasted showing clips, slow-motion, speeded up clips and so on, that seems there only to fill up the hour. 
Not impressed at all... 
Still, thanks to the unloader."
