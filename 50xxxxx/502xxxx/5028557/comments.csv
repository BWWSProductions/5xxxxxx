Jesus never existed.....the bible is a book of fairy tales. If you believe in jesus and the biblical god, you are worshipping far more ancient beliefs, it's called paganistic Egyptian and is far older than Jesus.....stop believing, start thinking........"
[T],verifire,2009-08-13T17:55Z,"@""DevilPrez"": So. I see you've done your homework. Isn't ""Zeitgeist"" the most ""enlightening"" movie to ever hit the eyeballs and hearts? Oh, I wish I could describe how incredibly clever it's directed, and how it's bottom line is...how can I put this..? Ah, to take away the faith in Jesus.
Cause that is, amazingly enough, what this and oh so countless ""documentaries"" aim for.

Why is it so important to discredit the person described in the Bible, the Son of Man, Jesus of Nazareth?
Because it's obvious that that is the objective, right?

So, DevilPrez (catchy and revealing name, b.t.w.): Did it ever occur to you that the old snake from Eden can read the Old testament too? I think you know he understands pretty much of the Scripture.. Let's for instance take Genesis 3:15, where he is told by God:

""And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel."" 

Don't you think he might have some clue there about what God had in store?

And then there's the propheciy of Isiah 7:14:

""Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel."" [Immanuel means ""God with us""]

I'd say that already he would have had plenty of time to conjure up these religions you refer to.

And I could go on and on, but I won't. Either you're perceptive and truth-seeking and open minded enough to see how amazing and totally unique Jesus of Nazareth really is, or you're not. If you'd like to be, just ask Him to open your eyes, and even the green in the trees will look different when you open them again. If you're born again of His Spirit, that is..

He's available, 24/7.

To conclude, I'll choose Jeremiah 33:3. :-)

""Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know."""
[T],verifire,2009-08-13T18:01Z,"Oh, and I see that I forgot to refute the idea that Jesus was born on winter solstice. That was an idea the sun-worshipers (also know as the ""Mother Church"") adapted into the Christian Faith..

But it's nice though, in the wintertime, with candles and the family gathering around the table and peaceful ambiance in the house.. :-)

Love from V.

If this is how you ""think"" for yourself, then truly you will never believe that the Lord Jesus Christ existed and provided us (christians) the gift of eternal life."

,theone-11,2010-04-30T18:11Z,"This primitive tribal religious fascism is the cause and justification of so much bloodshed and suffering that if personified gods do exist this is a god of lies and deceit and blood and death ,its what HE DOES!!
I believe .. In the beginning man created god in his image.
As intelligence appears in man ,he sees the rocks and trees and water that influence his life and environment.He believes that they have an energy too. ?we know with modern science and this is a correct assumption. To make his life better ,he tries to bribe and placate these tree and rock energies. He believes that these energies have the same desires as we do? so offerings are made to bribe and gain favor. This belief then becomes a rock or tree personification,an early god or spirit. These personifications become more human as they are given human desires and weaknesses to give reasons for their inscrutable actions.
Please read the Golden Bough for a very good explanation of this process.The ?words of Jesus? can be traced to previous pagan authors , Eusebuis Pamphilius of Ceaserea , the MAN that wrote the New Testament for Constantine gives very clear reference to this. Constantine was a monotheistic sun worshiper and head of Sol Invictus cult.
Constantine then instructed Eusebius to organise the compilation of a uniform collection of new writings ,his instructions were: ?Search ye these books, and whatever is good in them, that retain; but whatsoever is evil, that cast away. What is good in one book, unite ye with that which is good in another book. And whatsoever is thus brought together shall be called The Book of B o o k s. And it shall be the doctrine of my people, which I will recommend unto all nations, that there shall be no more war for religions? sake.? (God?s Book of Eskra, op. cit., chapter xlviii, paragraph 31) ?Make them to astonish? said Constantine, and ?the books were written accordingly? Eusebius amalgamated the ?legendary tales of all the religious doctrines of the world together as one?, using the standard god myths from the presbyters? manuscripts as his exemplars.(Life of Constantine , vol. iv, pp. 36-39).Merging the supernatural ?god? stories of Mithra and Krishna with Druidic Culdean beliefs effectively joined the orations of Eastern and Western presbyters together ?to form a new universal belief?.

They were the ?New Testimonies?, and this is the first mention (c. 331) of the New Testament in the historical record. With his instructions fulfilled, Constantine then decreed that the New Testimonies would thereafter be called the ?word of the Roman Saviour God? (Life of Constantine, vol. iii, p. 29) and official to all presbyters sermonizing in the Roman Empire. He then ordered earlier presbyterial manuscripts and the records of the council ?burnt? and declared that ?any man found concealing writings should be stricken off from his shoulders? (beheaded)
SO RELIGIOUS FASCISM ARRIVES IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE
Before religious tolerance was the norm, people would compare beliefs and find similarities. Merging gods in some cases. (This is how Jesus Christ came to be , Hesus and Krishna ,the joining of East and West Roman empires.)
Constantine's idea was a New Unified Roman Saviour god , his book ,the New Testimonies ,his city Constantinople was to be for Constantine the Great what Alexandria was to Alexander the Great. It failed and was usurped by messianic Judaism?. Set Worshipers ,who added the Old Testament,the Book of Set , to make the bi-ble (2 books or 2 bulls). Today Jews , Christians and Muslims still bow down to SET!!! and send their prayers to AMEN
Abrahamic monotheism spread through Europe via genocide , and convert or die policies , witch burnings ,inquistions,book burnings and it spread disease as well, with the closing of bathhouses and burning wise women and healers. EXACTLY the same thing happened in the ?New World? when Abrahamic monotheism arrives there.The same thing happened to the natives of North America and Australia.COINCIDENCE? THESE ARE REAL ACTIONS IN THE REAL WORLD ,ALL DONE IN THE NAME OF ABRAHAMIC M"
