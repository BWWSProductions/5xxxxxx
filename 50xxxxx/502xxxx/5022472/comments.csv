,dmng99,2009-08-04T07:52Z,hi i downloaded this movie it looks real nice on the computer but when i burn it on a dvd its not sync. why is that?
,VideoSource,2009-08-04T19:06Z,"Well im guessing this isnt fake cause there is over 1000 seeders and leechers i think people are just to lazy to post if its a good coppy or not, im DL now but ill post qualty when its done.

dmng99 if its fine on the computer then when you burn it to a dvd its prolly your computer software causing the mis-sync. maybe you running a to powerful program than your computer can handle.
Try getting a lighter program or turn some of your setting down.
its hard to help without seeting how your setting it up, just troubleshoot it."
,darkangel88,2009-08-09T03:30Z,"Good upload. Thanx.  For PS3 users who don't have sound, try this little program to ""fix"" your videos. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4258208/AVI-Mux_GUI-1.17.7. If you are not sure how to use it, just google it.  Good Luck."
,darkangel88,2009-08-10T07:26Z,After I ran it through avi mux gui and played it on my ps3 it was perfectly in sync.

,Typoopie,2009-09-13T00:33Z,Horrible does not begin to describe the shittyness that is this movie. Don't watch it unless you feel you have to.
,end0fdayz,2009-09-13T07:27Z,"@  Pike84, about your comment: ""Stop screwing the search results by those useless ""recommendations""! Spammer!""

Hear, hear! I wrote a few complaints about this as well in some of his other torrents, and my comments were deleted.

When you search for any movie that he ""recommends"", tons of his unrelated shit turn up in the results.

Sad thing is, a couple movies I got from him were of good quality -- but I don't recommend his stuff because what he's doing jeopardizes the integrity of Pirate Bay's search engine!

DO ANY OF THE MODS SEE THIS???

Does anyone in authority care??"
,Master86SDMF,2009-09-14T11:02Z,Thanks darkangel88 i have needed a program like AVI Mux GUI for so long you really helped me
