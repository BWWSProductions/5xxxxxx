,fiftyninevolvo,2009-12-26T12:27Z,Out of line but.. Baseballs should be shame mixing rockabilly with this kind of rihanna and other hiphop shit. UNCOOL.
,da_300_squirrels,2010-01-15T17:43Z,you should be in the box of shame since rockabilly dont count for a shit when you look all the other music styles like pop hiphop punk rock metal deathmetal melodeathmetal screamo folkmetal and your mom so shut your vortex of misery that is located in the middle of your face and be happy about me being your father......
