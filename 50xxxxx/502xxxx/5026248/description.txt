Storyline: Remy, a provincial rat with a wonderful sense of smell, 
hates garbage and risks death to enter a human kitchen where he discovers real food and the cooking 
of five-star chef, Anton Gusteau, author of "Anyone Can Cook." On the day Remy learns his hero has 
died, he is evicted and ends up alone in Paris. By luck, he discovers Gasteau's restaurant, down to 
three stars and run by a frozen-food-hawking chef. As Remy enters, so does Linguini, a clumsy youth 
hired as a garbage boy. To save the soup that Linguini accidentally fouls, Remy throws in some 
ingredients; the soup is a success and Linguini's career as a chef is born. Can Remy find a way 
to maintain the fiction and use his gift?
