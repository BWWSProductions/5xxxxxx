This and your other torrent are great ups, but they are not being seeded because nobody saw them. Let me be arrogant enough to make a couple of suggestions. The TITLE has to grab attention, especially if the book or torrent is not of something really famous. For your other torrent, I would have put something like ?Newbury Award Civil War Classic ACROSS FIVE APRILS ? Irene Hunt ? Unabridged?

Then, in the DESCRIPTION AREA, you need to tell us about the book, and the formatting. You can just copy and paste a review from Amazon or Wikipedia, and let us know if it is mp3, flac, m4a, what bit rate etc. Also list the narrator if that is known.If you do this, you will quickly gain a following, and as people notice your constant good uploads AND detail work, you will likely get the trusted skull here on TPB and lots of people will take a chance on your stuff just because it is YOU uploading it. You cannot count on people knowing any author and title unless its somebody like King or Rowling."
