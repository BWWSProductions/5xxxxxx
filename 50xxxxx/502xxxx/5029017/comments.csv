Movie is shait. Absolutly nothing happens and I almost fell asleep. The plot suffers from a severe case of swiss cheese syndrome. If there even is a plot that is, I don't know..."

,driver76,2009-08-05T19:27Z,"People that upload. Would it be so fucking hard to add a little description of the movie. Are you people fucking retarded. Your the 99% guys...you juist always nearly get there, but can never finish. Then again I suspect you never ripped this or done oany of the leg work. I suspect you took it from another site."
,driver76,2009-08-05T19:28Z,"ired and irritable, Zakes Abbott drives home along the motorway, his girlfriend, Beth, asleep beside him. Failing to spot his exit he speeds across the causeway, cutting up a white van and barely avoiding an accident. Apoplectic with rage, the truck driver gives chase, and as he violently overtakes the tailgate flips up revealing a woman bound and bloodied in the back. But before there is time for a second look, the door is slammed shut and Zakes is left bewildered and wondering if what he saw was real. Later at a service station, Zakes' fears grow when Beth goes missing, and as he begins a frantic search, he is enticed into a deadly game of cat and mouse on the deserted motorway. But being the sole witness to the earlier scene, how does he convince others of his desperate need for help? Playing on our most primal fears, this taut suspense thriller challenges a world where we constantly turn responsibility over to someone else and asks the question: what do you do when there is no one else there?"
,lporiginalg,2009-08-06T02:38Z,Driver he put the url for IDMB if you can't be bothered to take 2 seconds to copy and paste that into your browser then you shouldn't bitch at the uploaded for not writing a synopsis.
,cheddagetta007,2009-08-06T17:34Z,what the fuck is the movie about
,originalKL,2009-08-12T03:29Z,"Driver, you have exactly 0 uploads here.  I don't think that leaves you much room to bitch."
,oasismiki,2009-08-13T07:02Z,"Thanks, great quality and I actually enjoyed the film, starts off a bit slow but it does get suspenseful."
