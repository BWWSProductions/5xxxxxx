,warlockwizard,2009-07-29T01:59Z,Only use VLC media player.  It is the best player out there for free. get it at videolan.org or google for it.

This seems to be an atempt at re-doing a B Movie Scfi film of the  50s.
 You seem to wonder what its trying to say?
You wonder if it should have been put in black and white!
 Its a Film with alot of potential to make a good comedy film, but ends up being too lame.
 With some of us remembering Kevins dad from the Wonder Years, thats about it.....shame!!!!!! could have done somthing good, to this film.
