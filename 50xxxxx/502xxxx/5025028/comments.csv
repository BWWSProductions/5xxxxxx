,q222,2009-07-26T22:28Z,"Thanks, but why RARs?"
,Sweeeet,2009-07-26T22:36Z,"Thank you very much indeed.

RARs suck though."
,Wapniak,2009-07-26T22:55Z,"make torrent - upload is faster than
unrar, delete rars, make torrent upload
pre time - ~9min, good for public torrent?"
,Raider01,2009-07-26T22:57Z,Thanks to you Wapniak !! I am a Biggest Top Gear fan in Poland !! Hell Yeah :D
,Sweeeet,2009-07-26T23:23Z,"I don't know, what you are talking about. Rar cannot compress XVid any more and uploading a rar isn't any faster than uploading an XVid.

Rars hurt the community. People throw the rars away because they use space on their hard drive. Thus, these torrents have less seeders. Uploading an XVid directly is already the perfect way to do it, raring it only makes it worse (and a lot at that).

Don't get me wrong, I am thankful for the upload anyway. Cheers."
,Sweeeet,2009-07-26T23:31Z,"Oh, sorry, Wapniak, now I got it :-). You mean you did not unrar the vid in order to be able to start the upload sooner. Well, I think unraring is well worth the short delay."
,backlit,2009-07-26T23:32Z,thx !!!
,Sweeeet,2009-07-26T23:33Z,@akirambo: Bittorrent is not usenet. And people with broken BT clients will fail the checksum check after downloading which should be an incentive to switch to a client that isn't broken. But I have not heard about corrupt files on bittorrent for years now. Most clients are very stable.
,Raider01,2009-07-26T23:34Z,Uploading rar`s is much faster way for those who have fastest internet speed

One of us is missing something. BT upload is not FTP/Usenet upload and XVid cannot be compressed any more. There is nothing to be gained using rar on Bittorrent."
