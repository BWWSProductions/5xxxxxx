What is the serial key cause it's requiring me to have on...

OK it would ask u for a serial if u choose to update 
from ur current os. run the cd via boot mode then the serial is integrated"
[T],minOdroL,2009-07-29T13:47Z,"Thank you very much, works great so far! And yes, this works fine to run via boot mode, if you do that it does not ask for a serial.

Will post again if any issues arise. Big thanks!"
,Katsurui,2009-07-29T17:59Z,"I'm noob. But, I certainly did turn my XP long time ago. Anyways, I have a question. How do you do ""Boot Mode"" ? It's an innocent question, no need to harm me. Care to explain, nice people? "
,Katsurui,2009-07-29T23:12Z,"What makes this ""EXTREME PERFORMANCE"" ?"
[T],grimreaper420,2009-07-31T08:28Z,295-samuels IS FULL OF SHIT..lol

,Studdevil,2009-08-04T05:37Z,"I want to run this with bootcamp on my mac.  Anything I need to know?  Can i just select the .iso file or is burning it to disk necessary?

Thanks"
,Dani3la,2009-08-04T11:46Z,"can i use it in romania, too? the last windows that i've installed had a thing in the right saying that i may be a victim of software counterfeinting... what can i do to avoid that?"
,ste-,2009-08-04T16:49Z,Language?
,lotira,2009-08-04T19:03Z,Did this version strip away east asian language support? I'd like to know what Im getting 600mb sooner than later
,Triakor,2009-08-04T22:11Z,"For anyone downloading, downloaded, or going to download this please be aware that this version as soon as it is installed makes your HDD accessible to the public to be edited as well as the registery. as well as adding an extensive addition to letting someone edit and use the system in an asian language remotly. For those that don't know how to disable all of these things, get yourself the latest version of TuneUp Utilities 2009 and a quick scan through it will show you all of stated above. I have yet to try and actually use the system after disabling all of the above but will keep you posted. I guess you have to expect this kind of thing when your getting things illegaly. "
,Sucz666,2009-08-06T02:20Z,"@ Triakor wtf are you talking about? Even original version of xp HAS enabled remote desktop, remote registry and other shit by default. And you need to disable it manually cause automatic programs will turn off things that are useful. I recommend Ashampoo Winoptimizer 6"
,Android6,2009-08-07T05:30Z,"All i can say, it's a peace of SHIT!! Here you go, loud & proud. Get Windows XP SP2 UNTOUCHED version, if you need clean & full SP3 upgrade, get it from here http://www.softwarepatch.com/windows/windows-xp-service-pack-3.html & ENJOY! Just don't even bother getting one of these.."

,c3k1,2009-08-07T05:45Z,"""Extreme Performance"" what? He disabled a couple of services and tuned some tweaks perhaps, but don't expect a performance increase greater than 0.1%..."
,bander49,2009-08-07T08:25Z,"I totally agree to everybody who say this EXTREME PERFORMANCE edition sucks!
Why? Simply because there is nothing EXTREME about it!"
,aljohnsalomon,2009-08-07T10:47Z,"this sucks,,, i waited for an hour and all it shows me is an error after the install... the windows can't continue, all it show is blue screen error"

Different accounts same spammer , it weird that he  agrees to himself though."

,ContraXC,2009-08-10T03:40Z,"@ aljohnsalomon: Wow, seriously? I performed a clean install on my uncle's PC and it worked perfectly well. You're just a boring n00b and an annoying spammer."
,emfy,2009-08-10T11:01Z,"Can someone please tell me if this is x64 or x86?
And all the crappy windows progs like moviemaker etc. are they removed?"
,coltnrg,2009-08-16T17:36Z,to aljohnsalomon // blue screen usually  means a memory issue ether with mother Bord or Graffias card or a bad ISO Bern if you had windows on before install then its a bad Bern or video card  if you instaled you own video card and kno how to do this get it out of the muchen if it is not integrated  then reinstall xp if it is integrated  then go to step 2 make a knew xp disk using power iso or imp burn at the fastest speed if you have a new cd or dvd burner if it is a older hard where then use recommended speed 
,coltnrg,2009-08-16T17:49Z,to jumand  dariks boot and nuke is a program you use to erase hard drive for good i have hade no good luck with it i use Maxtor disk recovery tools downloaded from  Maxtor it will alow you to srub hard drive fill it with 0000000000 then reformat it with windows xp disk all windows disks have the format option when you install fresh copies meaning starting from cd not os/if you loade frome os you will need a key to install// if this dosent work then go in to bis in computer and see if you computer registers you hard drive meaning if it sees it if not you have big problem and shod take it to a service senture good luck

,Jay91,2009-09-05T19:05Z,"Okay to all the newbies, theese are the facts.

- There is no problem with Microsoft_GM's release
- It works.
 If you are getting blue screen, then go to boot menu at start, go to MAIN ""for acer PC's"" i dunno if you have the same menu, but at least, Choose IDD mode i think it was that, if its already IDD choose the other alternative.

Yes i downloaded this and it works, but this is service pack 2, service pack 3 is out on Piratebay i suggest others to download that and install as i did!

Thanks."

Will this torrent work on my laptop?"
,Ibwaheemi,2010-01-21T15:09Z,"to Ignitiontube

no it wont work

you need sata drivers and none of the xp drivers are on the xp install cd.

the cq61 series is the hardest notebook from hp to downgrade.  with the torrent here and this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5186645/presario_cq61-312sa_downgrade_to_windows_xp_drivers_(ibwaheemi) you are well on your way

,flixman,2010-01-25T04:56Z,I installed this version in bootcamp and everything worked until I started using Mac drive. This the only OS that screwed up mac drive and it corrupted my hard disk. I had to completely wipe my hard drive and reinstall everything. I lost all my work :'(. So I caution bootcamp users who plan to use macdrive.
