,6hexagon6,2009-08-13T22:10Z,"Our Lady is weeping in picture2. When I was reading the passage below (Faustina) I better understood why:

'1373 O humdrum days, filled with darkness, I look upon you with a solemn and festive eye. How great and solemn is the time that gives us the chance to gather merits for eternal heaven! I understand how the saints made use of it.'

Just look around the world and see how people make use of them..."
