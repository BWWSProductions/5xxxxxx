,nojobber,2009-08-20T00:35Z,"Having problems with the patch not working. Every time I install it gives me 16 days (of 21?) trial period and after restart it says ""Trial expired"". What am I doing wrong?"
,Timewarptwo,2009-10-24T04:17Z,I can't get this to work. I disabled updates and made sure it was not running in task bar. I also tried to install other anydvd torrents from TPB. 6.5.8.7 & 6.5.7.1 & 6.5.9.5 None these work. I keep getting a message that it is expired or have a few days left on trial period. I noticed that when I uncheck updates it becomes checked again automatically. A message pops up saying that since it is a trial version the defaults will be reset when you close the window. I also had no idea where to find the DVD.CHK to change it to DVD.BAK?? It is not in the program files thats for sure. I tried all of these versions about 3 times each. Installing then uninstalling. When I uninstalled I chose the option to delete ALL information and NOT save anything. Still no go. My only other thought is that something must be left behind in the registry which is not deleted when uinstalled making any other version after it read as a TRIAL version. I am running windows 7 64bit. Is there a registry removal/cleaning tool specifically for Any DVD???
