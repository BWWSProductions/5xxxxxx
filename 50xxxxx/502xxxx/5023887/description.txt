Broken Haze is the alias of Keisuke Ito, a Japanese experimental electronica hip-hop producer whose fururistic music is composed with glitchy digital noise, chopped melody, industrial drum sound, and dark cinematic ambience.

This is some cutting-edge music. If you like dark dubstep/atmospheric breakbeat/techno/glitch, you'll feel right at home. Bought this at the HMV in Tokyo a few months ago after seeing him live at a local event.
