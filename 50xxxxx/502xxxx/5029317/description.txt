Archivarius 3000
Instant full-text search of documents and e-mail in 18 languages

Archivarius 3000 is the system which understands natural language queries (English, German, Spanish, French for example). Documents can be searched by keyword or using query language, the same like in Internet search engines. While searching, the program automatically generates all forms of words, which provide full-text documents search in 18 languages.
Support for LAN (local network) and removable drives (CD, DVD and others)

While indexing documents and e-mail, Archivarius 3000 will extract and save full information about them. During search, even if document is not physically accessible, Archivarius 3000 will find it by keywords and determine on which disk the required file is located.
Handling large volumes of documents and e-mail

Archivarius 3000 is built to handle rapidly growing document and e-mail flow with no hassle. You can index thousands of documents and messages daily and still you won't see any significant slowdown while searching and accessing them; there is no need for constant reducing number of documents and messages in your folders in order to make it running faster.
