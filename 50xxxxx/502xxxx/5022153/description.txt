Island Life (Best Of) - Grace Jones [1985]
	
Island Life was Grace Jones' 1985 compilation album, featuring songs from her Island Records albums Portfolio, Fame, Warm Leatherette, Nightclubbing, Living My Life, and Slave to the Rhythm. No tracks from Muse were included. The album was a huge success in the UK (reaching number #4 on the UK Album Chart in December, 1985), with "Pull Up to the Bumper" (#12 in the UK Singles Chart) and "Love Is the Drug" (#35) re-entering the charts a second time.
The tracks are arranged chronologically so it maps out her musical development from the robotic disco sounds of La Vie En Rose through her new wave experiments with Private Life, her torch song phase in Libertango up to the funky R&B of My Jamaican Guy.
