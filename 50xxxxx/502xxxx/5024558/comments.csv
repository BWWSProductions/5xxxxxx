Video is not perfect.  In no way DVD quality but very watchable. If you intend to burn and save I would try to get better quality tho.  Avi files and 5.1 sound.  Sound works great with Vlc btw."

I want to sincerely thank to Anonymus for this upload. 

My opinion about technical aspects of this play: 
(from an estimate range of 1 to 10)
Video: 7.5-8.00
Audio: 7.0-7.50
Average: 7.50-7.75

My opinion about the plot of this mini-series:
I havenÂ´t been able to watch this tv programme before and now that I 've seen it I think it's simply a very naÃ¯ve, simplistic and therefore slanted and even ridiculous version (said only from the american point of view, of course) of what happend at the final stage or phase of World War II, -when Nazi Germany was nearly defeated and dead, handicapped or disappeared their best combat troops-, so I'm almost certain it might be funny to watch it but always from a very critical and hesitating eye.

,AoF,2010-09-23T21:08Z,"Waste of time to download, I got no sound and no video on most of the files, and the ones I do manage to get video they are all blurry and pixelated, this doesnt happen with other movies/tv shows I have downloaded."
,SFSU,2010-09-25T00:28Z,"Great sound, not dvd-material regarding the visual, but nothing to complain about when watching it on computer...

No subs, original language, WS, all ten episodes in .avi so no need for unzipping.

Got it working in vlc btw. Great torrent."
,SFSU,2010-09-25T00:40Z,"Better subs.
