"Dicks Diamonds" sit-out this semi final challenge.

The six finalists from series eleven who beat "The Diamonds", namely : "The Rocketeers", "The Cannock Ruff Necks", "The Tree Musketeers", "The Destroyers", "The Carbon Consolidators" and "The Wheel Nuts", take on each other in a bid to be among the three winning teams to go on to challenge "Dicks Diamonds" in the season Grand Final. 

The challenge : build a radio controlled rally vehicle.

Help me seed & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. It's a team effort.

As so few have seeded the previous episodes and I have been left the job of seeding, I'm going to stop uploading this torrent at about 85% until I see that the previous episodes have sufficient seeding. Once I see sufficient seeding of the other episodes, I'll resume seeding this one.

Apologies in advance to those of you who are doing the right thing & seeding.
