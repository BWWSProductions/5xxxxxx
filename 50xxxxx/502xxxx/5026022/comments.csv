,cloudy123123,2009-07-27T16:59Z,Am trying to help you out with the seeding problem - currently seeding all episodes at 800k/sec -  I'd really appreciate it if you could let the rest of the this ep come down - Thanks for all the work in getting the series up :)
,SOBB3029,2009-07-27T17:55Z,"Goodonya cloudy123123, your help is greatly appreciated.

Currently I have 49 leechers for this episode, the most of which has got 79% of the file. I'll press on to 85% & download my own torrents & use Halite to check seeding. (I'm using uTorrent to upload them).

If sufficient seeding is there I'll continue until this episode is complete."
,cloudy123123,2009-07-27T18:02Z,"Now seeded 6GB in the last hour, managing 900k now - I hope it's enough..."
,cloudy123123,2009-07-27T18:52Z,"Another 2.5GB of upload, but it looks like it's paused at 85.6% - I'm giving all the bandwidth I have"
,SOBB3029,2009-07-27T19:19Z,"I 'caught' a bloke at IP address : 70.95.245.218 who has 85.9% of this final episode, yet like you, everyone else is 'stuck' at 85.6%. Obviously he is not sharing what he has, otherwise everyone else would be at 85.9% too.

I have put this person's IP address in to IpFilter so he can't get any more from me. He can't log in to my PC."
,cloudy123123,2009-07-27T19:24Z,"I did notice that, I'm showing as having had  1.5MB from there... 

Now sent over 10GB into the torrents, despite having already seeded to over 1.5 when I grabbed each ep previously. Would you be able to continue the torrent?"
,SOBB3029,2009-07-27T19:25Z,"I've opened it up.

It'll complete now.

The final episode ""Scrapheap Challenge - 11x20 - Grand Final"" airs tonight, needless to say I'll be watching out for non-sharers.

They just waste my upload bandwidth by not re-seeding. Stuff 'em.

Everyone should congratulate you for your communications, otherwise I would have kept them on hold indefinitely."
,cloudy123123,2009-07-27T19:27Z,I have a vested interest in seeing these episodes... ;)  Thankyou very much :) I will continue to boost the other torrents
,SOBB3029,2009-07-27T19:49Z,You wouldn't happen to be in Canada would you ?
,SOBB3029,2009-07-27T19:59Z,"If you are, you were the 1st to complete, followed by Latvia, then Finland."
,cloudy123123,2009-07-27T20:14Z,"UK...   I've got it, now seeding - thanks again"
,rontorr,2009-07-28T05:13Z,"I just hope som of you will say seeding long enough for me to get it all, I currently have 7 seeding and am averaging 7-10k download. I appreciate the way you all seed this show, I ussually get it in less than 1 day, faster than any other shows, top gear runs second.  I always try to seed for a couple of days if I can, but I can't seem to get more than 30k at the most out of this lousy Thai connection"
,SOBB3029,2009-07-28T11:31Z,"Thanks again 'cloudy123123' & 'rontorr'. Keep up the good work.

I've completed recording the Grand Final. It's excellent!. It'll be posted about 9pm Melbourne, Australia time.

Once again, I'm going to suspend uploading (at about 90% this time) to ensure lots of seeders.

I'll also be watching for cheaters who aren't contributing to the swarm. 

From last nights' experience, I learned that a 1.0 ratio is not 100% seeded...it needs to be about 1.5 to be a complete copy. "
,cloudy123123,2009-07-28T11:52Z,"30GB uploaded since yesterday, please let the torrent go, can't wait to see it!"
