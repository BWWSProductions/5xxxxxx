Allmusic.com review:
"A narrower anthology, this covers only the sentimental love tunes and ballads, omitting the uptempo dance and funk hits. She sounds uniformly great, but it's only one side of the Ross story. Of course, those who didn't like hearing her doing disco, funk, and pop/dance will find this a bargain. Among the featured songs are "You're All I Need to Get By," "I'm Still Waiting," "My Man (Mon Homme)," "Touch Me in the Morning," "All of My Life," "Love Me," "Theme from Mahogany," "Sparkle" and "Endless Love."
