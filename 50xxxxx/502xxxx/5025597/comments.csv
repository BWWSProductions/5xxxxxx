I hope the EZTV website is back soon though.  Nicer to navigate than here."

,clitsy1,2009-07-30T20:39Z,"For some reason I can't get the audio to play for this video on my new mac.  I tried tv rips of mighty boosh and they wouldn't play either, but the dvdrip season 1 and .mov season 3 did.  I got the xvid codec for quicktime and that gave me picture, then I got the divx codec, but that didn't do anything.  Anyone knoe what's wrong?"
,clitsy1,2009-07-30T21:46Z,Correction. I can't get audio in ANY .avi file.

Try updating to Perian 1.1.4, plus the newest version of QuickTime, or if nothing else, use VLC player in the meantime. I'm on a Mac too, and had to use a combination of fixes in the past. Still worth it though!  ;)"
,clitsy1,2009-07-30T23:54Z,Perian worked! Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!!!
,NumYummy,2009-07-31T06:42Z,"Anytime! Glad it worked, and that I could help! ;)"
