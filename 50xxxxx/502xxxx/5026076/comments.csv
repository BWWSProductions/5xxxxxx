,ronzalonis,2009-07-27T17:33Z,"Great upload. Works perfectly with Windows 7. 
I did not need to use keygen to register. 
I installed over an already registered copy (keygen) of Poweriso 4.4 and it shows up as a version already registered to Administrator.
Simple, working... just like a torrent file should be. I'll help seed.
Also the real benefit of this program, besides the .iso and .daa support is the fact it allows you to load programs in a virtual drive. I installed a copy of Adobe's Master Collection CS4 (5 CD's) from the virtual drive and didn't have to burn a single disk to do this. Again, a great program and great upload. Thanks!"
