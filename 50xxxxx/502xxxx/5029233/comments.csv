,la_cross37,2009-10-24T15:44Z,"well I have just downloaded and installed it using the instructions, and it works fine and is very easy to do. but I have one question: can I update the program to a newer version or will it stop working if I do so? I have tried a couple of torrents and one of them was almost exactly the same as this, and that one worked just fine at first, but then when I updated it, it said instead of lifetime subscription it said pro trial version and then after a while it said that the trial period was over. so can I update this one?"

I ran the keygen as a admin and ran it in XP. I am using Windows 7. I had the same error you had, till I did that."
