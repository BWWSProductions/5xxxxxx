I meant to include this changelog for neogamma. this is ALL for neogamma:

Quote:PROBLEMS PLAYING A CERTAIN GAME?

Try the following options:
Hooktype: none
Ocarina: no
Alternative .dol: no
Boot language: Console Default (2nd test with the language used in the game)
Force Video: Disc
Patch Video: no
VIDTV Patch: no
Patch Country Strings: no (2nd test with yes)

If you play from sd or usb, insert a disc.

If the game does not work with this, the game is not compatible or an IOS Reloading game, or it's a cIOS, media or new unknown problem.

If you get either color issues or a green screen freeze(with video mode != Disc), try different combinations of Force Video, Patch Video and VIDTV. Note that this issue can't be fixed in lots of games.


PROBLEMS WITH OCARINA?

Try the different hooktypes.


PROBLEMS WITH USB LOADING?

- NeoGamma is not able to load games from usb with rev12(maybe rev11 does not work too) of Waninkoko's cIOS
- Make sure you are using the bottom usb port, the top one won't work for HDDs from cIOSrev12 on.
- Also if you have WiiConnect24 enabled, test what happens if you disable it.
- If you have an IDE HDD, try both master and slave jumper settings(experts only!, very low chance to change something)

Try starting the loader after the HDD was connected and powered
Try starting the loader, connect and power the HD, and then selecct mount WBFS
Try starting the loader, select mount WBFS, connect the HDD, and then power it
Try starting the loader, select mount WBFS, power the HDD, and then connect it
Try starting the loader, select mount WBFS, wait until tries left 20, connect the HDD, and then power it
Try starting the loader, select mount WBFS, wait until tries left 20, power the HDD, and then connect it

If all this does not help, get: 
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/GeeXboX
start something from the HDD with it(requires 2 partitons, 1 wbfs and 1 other),
don't do anything to the HDD, do not unplug,
exit to HBC, start NeoGamma and try to connect.

If GeeXboX is the only way for you to get your HDD working, please get in contact with the people at irc://irc.freenode.org/cIOS or me

And if even this does not work, try to get 2 partitions on the HDD:
1. FAT32 or NTFS
2. WBFS

And then try again, maybe try the GeeXboX trick again.



OPTIONS:

Hook Type:
ONLY ENABLE IF YOU NEED IT! Required for debugging and Ocarina, the different option can differently reduce game compatibilty.

Ocarina:
ONLY ENABLE IF YOU NEED IT! options to use either sd or usb for Ocarina and which IOS to use to access that device. The "not cIOS" options may not work with some cIOS and sd/usb loading.

Alternative .dol:
ONLY ENABLE IF YOU NEED IT! "Disc" searches the disc for .dols and let's you select which one to load then. It should be ovious that only using a .dol different from the main.dol makes sense here. "SD & USB" load a .dol from storage instead of loading the main.dol from disc. The .dol has to be in the folder 'NeoGamma' and the name has to be the first 6(or 4) characters of the disc id.

Boot Language:
Option which language to force. "Console Default" forces nothing, "Auto Force" forces english on NTSC-U games, and japanese on NTSC-J games. Forcing the language of the disc is required for some import games.

Force Video:
Option which video mode to use. "Disc" is the default and DOES NOT force anything and is THE option that works. "Wii" forces the video mode set in the Wii settings.

Patch Video:
ONLY ENABLE IF YOU NEED IT! Patches the video mode(s) inside the main.dol to the video mode the game will be started with. This makes more import games playable with "correct" colors.

VIDTV Patch:
ONLY ENABLE IF YOU NEED IT! Something video related.

Patch Country Strings:
ONLY ENABLE IF YOU NEED IT! Required for some import games, mostly people with japanese Wiis need this.
