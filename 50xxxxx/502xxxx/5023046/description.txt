This is coming out for WiiWare also.  It is really fun to play on the PSP, I highly recommend it.


This is a pretty fun free game.  You will need be running Custom Firmware to play it.

To install:

On DAX 5.00 M33-6 just copy the cavestory directory to \PSP\GAME

If you don't have custom firmware on your PSP well this game is a reason to run it.  If you have a new PSP-3000 or the slim ta-088v3 then use ChickHEN and CFW enabler with 5.03 original firmware.


This game is sort of like metroid and castlevania with a little metal slug action here and there.  I think he may of even borrowed some metroid sounds, they sound really familiar.

You can get the xbox version here:
