,Quad-K,2009-12-03T04:17Z,"first u need to know your firmware version. if its above 5.00, then u gotta make/find a Pandora battery and a jig-stick memory card with necessary files for re-flash to an older firmware then install a custom (m33 preferrable) firmware to play copied games. If below 5.00 firmware, you can use other exploits to make it go directly to custom firmware without pandora or jig stick. I tihnk its like chicken crack, or somthing."
