,condcool,2009-08-06T03:57Z,"Wot to do now after downloading.
there are 9 RAR files named ""sr-icc09"" all of same size & a 'sr-icc09.sfv'..
Theres a no use document file.
Unraring any RAR gives 'sr-icc09'(BIN file) & 'sr-icc09.cue'..
Any idea wot to do with these,seems useless..

,TheGame14,2009-09-24T20:50Z,"After you've installed the game (most likly in D:\Program Files\Childish Things\International Cricket Captain 2009) and mounted the .cue file using daemon tools go to my computer right click on the International Cricket Captain 2009 logo then explore. You'll see a load of files come up, go into the ""SKIDROW"" file. Then copy everything in that folder, now go back to D:\Program Files\Childish Things\International Cricket Captain 2009 and paste into here it'll say the folder already contain these file's would you like to replace them. Click yes!
You should no longer see the pop up saying insert the right disc when you try load the game up!
