[V],2nafish,2009-07-29T08:23Z,I switched to XviD because the MPG files are too big and take double the time to upload. Also I have limited hard drive space and the MPG files take up too much room.
,goldensun87,2009-07-30T01:54Z,Couldn't you just delete your older mpg videos?  Surely you are not still seeding the torrents that you uploaded over a year ago.
,slkslk,2009-07-30T03:52Z,"Speaking of old torrents, can you re-seed Adam Ant's ""Strip"" before following this deleting advice?  It's maxed out at about 90%. Thanks"
[V],2nafish,2009-08-01T13:24Z,I already delete my older files but I'm adding files that aren't music videos to my hard drive so I'm running out of room. 
,xHeliosx,2009-08-15T06:48Z,Guys don't reclaim too much.. Just download and not request more.. You're only leeching and not seeding yourself..
