Keep your computer privacy and protect your data with Shadow Defender

Shadow Defender provides a new way to solve current security, data protection and disaster recovery problems. Our unique approach provides disaster prevention, eliminating security, data protection and disaster recovery problems before they occur. Why recover from a PC disaster when you can prevent it?

Shadow Defender is using a unique method called Shadow Mode to ensure PCs are protected.By placing PCs in Shadow Mode with Shadow Defender, you can be confident the system is going to be protected no matter what happens.

Shadow Mode tracks each system change and redirects them to an unused location on the disk. These system changes can be permanently saved to disk, or completely discarded. With Shadow Mode, there is no need to specify regions on disk for backup or use BIOS functions to reserve space for OS images. Shadow Mode is the most efficient and intelligent way to protect PCs.

Shadow Defender provides non-restrictive, easy to use desktop security and protection for Windows operating systems. Shadow Defender is the best way to prevent unwanted or malicious changes from being made to a PC.

Shadow Defender can restore the system state before Shadow Mode no matter what has happened to the PC. At anytime, authorized users can save changes to the system, save selected files and folders or simply return the system to its state before Shadow Mode.

Here are some key features of "Shadow Defender":

Optimal State - Configure your system exactly the way you want it ONCE and run in that optimal state at all times. No need to spend the time removing unwanted files or trouble shooting and eliminating unwanted PC changes.
