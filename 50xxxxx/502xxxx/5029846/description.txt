This is the file you need to install (for free) the gba emulator for the iPod Touch and iPhone. To install, do the following:

1. Copy the .deb file to your iPod using OpenSSH (google it, if you don't know how). Put it in /var/mobile/, and change permissions to '777'.

2. Open Mobile Terminal (can be downloaded from Cydia). Type "su" (without "). Then you need to enter your password, that is "alpine" (again, without "). 


3. Now, you should be in the same map as the .deb file. Type exactly "dpkg -i gpSPhone 6.1.0.deb".

4. Reboot, and it should work.
