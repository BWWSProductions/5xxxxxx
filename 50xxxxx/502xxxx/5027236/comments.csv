As for MKV do you know anything about video encoding? 
First of all h.264 video is ghetto rigged in avi. 
second: avi has no error recovery. 
third: the MKV container is SMALLER than AVI
fourth: MKV allows you to add a subtitle file(s)
fifth: variable frame rate
sixth: open source
...and I can go on and on about how much better MKV's are than AVI's. 

Go troll elsewhere you useless peace of shit. "
