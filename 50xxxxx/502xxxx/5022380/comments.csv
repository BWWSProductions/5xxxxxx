I refuse to support torrents uploaded from jackasses. What dlarrym1 said was actually important, why did you have to put him down?

Btw, this torrent is shit. Download this one instead:

,An2quam,2010-07-20T17:10Z,"Audio - can stand
Video - 1/100 - dvd is out for more than a year so do not waste ur time on downloading this shitty live rip"
,icewolf72,2011-09-07T22:36Z,"maybe because it's not supposed to be the highest quality you've ever seen in your life, maybe because that kind of quality is only meant for high end PC's that we regular pirates don't have and maybe we just want to watch the fucking movie!!! For people like you down-raters, there is no such thing as a 10 rating."
