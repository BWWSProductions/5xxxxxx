,JujitsuFreak,2009-08-16T13:33Z,"Fantastic torrent. Thank you for uploading the latest version of this useful tool. 

By the way, I'm not sure why you would be at a -2 rating, so I gave you +1, which leaves you at -1 for the final rating.  Maybe someone accidentally rated you incorrectly? No doubt you should be way above 0 for your contribution.

Cheers, keep up the great work."

Kool MAN the hits are false positive as I've mentioned it in the Virustotal Report "
,frekken60,2009-09-13T09:33Z,Thanks man. Works 100%. No virus
,brianxxx,2009-09-29T02:30Z,"True that. Anyone can say TRUST ME...they are false positives. 

Now, I have NEVER had a rpoblem with and uploaders that were VIPs here. So I would believe Tauseef...

BUT to be safe, you can always create a test machine under VMWARE folks. Run proggies under that then wipe it clean when done. Wash, rinse...repeat!!! lol

I use keygens under it, generate 20 or so keys..then copy and paste them into a txt file and keep that. Then you can save your keygen into a compressed, encrypted file for later use if needed.

I do this even if it comes from a VIP simply because no one is perfect...viruses are tricky and things happen. 

An ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. lol"
