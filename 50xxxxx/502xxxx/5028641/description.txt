Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored 128k VBR mp3 
Rip+Edit mg56 

Note: This is about 10 minutes longer than the 64k up due to the full intro and I also left the whole Dylan tune in.

The Piratebay is being sold and will no longer be tracking free torrents. Tentative 
sale date is August 8th - bookmark the link below so you can find O&A. Even if this 
sale doesn't happen - the owners are willing to sell which means tpb could cease 
to exist in it's current form at some point. Be ready for that day right now.
