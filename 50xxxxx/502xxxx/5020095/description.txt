Electric Light Orchestra, commonly abbreviated ELO, were a symphonic rock group from Birmingham, England, who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern pop songs with heavily classical overtones, but falling under a light rock category. However, the band's direction for most of their existence was set by Lynne who, after the band's debut record, wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.

This album is primarily a Jeff Lynne solo production (albeit with some guest musicians, most notably former Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr). The only other past ELO member appearing on the album, Richard Tandy, appears on one track and performed live in promotional concerts. This is the only album to feature the ELO name on which Bev Bevan does not play. This album featured a more organic feel with less reliance on electronic effects and a return of strings in the form of cellos. Although billed as a return to the classic ELO sound the album sales were relatively poor and a planned North American concert tour was cancelled.
