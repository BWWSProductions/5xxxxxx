It's a lot better if you use a controller. Like a Logitech USB controller. Makes it 100 times better."

,berkay2100,2010-11-23T08:56Z,what is the live access code? help plss..
,loljk,2011-01-07T02:50Z,"@natanaelcd
That's all well and good, but all I could find was useless info that is seemingly no longer relevant. When I DL Games for Windows LIVE now, I get an MSN Messenger style interface which is black, not blue as my Google searches depict, and there is now method to create a local account. All you can do is sign in with a pre-existing Windows LIVE ID (same as MSN Messenger etc)"
,loljk,2011-01-07T03:14Z,"Holy fuck balls. Just spent a half hour - 40 mins stressing over the Games for Windows LIVE issue, as cannot create an offline profile in Marketplace (which appears to have taken over GFWL). Turns out that on the screen that asks you to enter your GFWL access code you can just leave it blank (or 0-0-0-0-0) and it will work fine. THANKYOU FOR INCLUDING THIS VITAL PIECE OF INFORMATION IN YOUR TORRENT DESCRIPTION"
,loljk,2011-01-07T03:17Z,"Well, after about 40 minutes of stressing out turns out the resolution to the LIVE access code is that you don't have to put anything in, just click next and it will work fine. Would have been nice to include this little bit of information in the torrent description."
,loljk,2011-01-07T03:20Z,"^^ sorry for double post, interfag is being gay and not refreshing shit properly, didn't think the first one worked (plus I dulled it down a bit after I took a few breaths lol)"
,loljk,2011-01-07T03:30Z,"Oh and btw to get the game running full-screen simply go to 'C:\Documents and Settings\USER\Local Settings\Application Data\CAPCOM\STREETFIGHTERIV' then open 'config.ini' and edit it in notepad. I assume just change Fullscreen=OFF to Fullscreen=ON, haven't tested it yet."
,The77s,2011-01-24T08:38Z,"Street Figher IV Installation Guide

1. Burn or Mount StreetFighterIV ISO.
2. Install Street Fighter IV.
3. Copy & Paste Street Fighter IV Crack content into Street Fighter IV Directory.
4. Finished, have fun playing Street Fighter IV.

Notes: If asked for a Serial Key by Windows LIVE, simply ignore it. Remember to create an Offline Profile when asked to create a Profile by Windows LIVE."
