[T],thegrimreaper123,2009-07-27T04:46Z,for some reason if your trying to install on a virtual machine dont because the virtual machine thinks that its genuine you need a cd key but when you install it on your pc it self it dont need one so dont install it on a virtual machine.

,Manipulateral,2009-08-02T15:23Z,Is this English only or does it have other languages? Has anything been removed from this release or is it full? Thanks.

,SOARiNGBiRD,2009-08-02T18:05Z,"Works perfectly, thanks. It works in VMware without a serial too when you choose 'custom' and 'I will install OS later'. That way VMware doesn't use easyinstall which asks for a key as default.

And use OpenOffice as a substitute for Office. It's free and works just as good."

,madLyfe,2009-08-04T06:05Z,for some reason i burned it to a cdr in win 7 64 rtm... i then tried to install it on a messed up laptop that i have and it wont boot up even tho one of my other xp disks does boot up... well it runs fine from within windows but it asks for a key.. i used one of the keys you put up here but just didnt think it was supposed to ask me for a key..
,madLyfe,2009-08-04T10:25Z,ok i had to reburn it with not the windows burning software and now it works and i dont need to enter a key.. awesome! next problem is that when i go and get all of the updates from ms there is a WGA program after i am all done and it pops up on the main screen when i restart and log back on... but its not the usual one that pops up from the lower right task bar.. do i follow the instructions the WGA program is giving me and press next for it to check my computer or do i just click out and find a crack for it..?
,madLyfe,2009-08-04T12:23Z,actually im retarded.. dont listen to anything i said...

,freexp123,2009-08-08T09:37Z,Sorry for my slowness again this is first OS switch I have done when I reformat the HDD do I need to reformat the whole thing to start from scratch or do I need to keep a few things? and if it doesn't have SATA drives does that mean it has AHCI?

,boom777,2009-08-08T19:53Z,"Can the uploader confirm that this does NOT have SATA drivers for installation?

I'd like to know before I download :|

Though, for those interested a way to resolve this SATA driver issue is presented in this article:

http://news.softpedia.com/news/Install-Windows-XP-On-SATA-Without-a-Floppy-F6-47807.shtml


It will involve you adding the relevant drivers to an XP CD/ISO and creating a new installation CD/ISO.

But it would be nice if this version already has the required drivers :/"
,freexp123,2009-08-08T21:49Z,I just installed it and I went to the f2 menu and changed my SATA to IDE mode and everything went fine

,lukeroo,2009-08-09T04:25Z,I've downloaded this torrent twice and both times it asked me for a key after I mounted and launched it. After I downloaded a keygen and gave it a key on reboot it said hal.dll was corrupt.
,nmhsjunk,2009-08-09T23:29Z,"lukeroo, you clearly did not follow standard procedures. You were supposed to:
1)Burn the iso to CD at slowest speeds
2)Restart the PC with the CD inside, so you can BOOT OFF OF IT and then follow on-screen instructions.

That said, there is nothing wrong with your hal.dll file. What you need to do at this point is modify your boot.ini file, so that it points to the boot drive, and you'll be able to get back on Windows like you always did. In the future, don't do something if you don't know what your'e doing. "

thanks for pointing that out to him mate"
,iphonerulez,2009-08-10T03:16Z,"Son-of-a-bitch!  This install works like a champ.  A monkey could use this sucker.  I burned your iso with Toast 9 (OSX) and used it to install in Parallels Desktop on my MacBook Pro and it practically installed itself.  I just put in some key-generated serial and that was it.  It's damn fast.  You did some perfect shit here.  Haha, sweet.  I'm going to re-do my BootCamp partition with this.  Rock on. :D  I'm reseeding this 2X."

You're right; my bad for misinterpreting ""Boot of CD and install XP"". 

Anyway, works fine if you don't mount it and instead burn to CD and boot from there."

i just had one question though, its a nooby question
im not sure about your steps, even though there are simple
do i just mount it with powerISO and reboot or do i burn it onto a CD and reboot with CD in the comp
just want to make sure how to do it so i do it right and dont mess up my computer"

any help is appreciated"
,fcssd,2009-08-18T07:19Z,"hi reaper, me again lol.  ok, im having trouble installing this on my girlfriends emachine tower.  Basically i burned it to a cd-r with toast on my mac, then mounted it.  When i put it in the emachine, i select boot from cd dive in the bios, but when i hit F10 to enter the settings and choose boot from CD, it then gives me the option to hit F11 to enter receovery, if i dont hit that it starts up like normal, which i dont want.  If i hit F11 it goes into the emachine recovery section and asks for the proper recovery CD.  How the hell can install a fresh copy of windows xp on this machine?  Its so frustrating, thanks for the help"
,Thomapro,2009-08-18T09:20Z,"YounGifto: In previous message you can see that I have exactly same problem with my computer which has SATA hard-driver. 
Every computer has a different SATA-drivers and it would be imbossible to make iso file which includes all of those. 

So it need to be make own pakkage with n-lite. Just search with google and you find the guide to do that."

Another issue I have is that I cannot install Norton Internet Security 2008 on this Windows copy. 

I inserted the installation CD to see if there is a Chinese language component there somewhere but the only think I got was a strange window antivirus that has literally  screwed the pc...

My problem is that I have some viruses on my computer. And I cant get them off. So Im just resorting to what I always do, reformatting my drives and wiping everything. So I can just start fresh.

But when I boot from cd (burned on cd-r and a dvd-r at lowest speeds), and it did the begining stuff, like scanning everything. But once its done and says its starting windows, the screen goes black. Just before all the setup stuff like partions. 

Idk if its a problem with my graphics card not wanting to display anything, or if I did something wrong. But if anyone knows how to fix it please let me know"

1- I can't access windows update site even just for checking some updates that are needed;
2- With the portugues keyboard settings I always get double accent when I press any accent key, which is a huge problem for me. 
these are 2 of the problems I've found"
,brent825,2009-08-31T01:07Z,"** THANK YOU!!! **

i have been dealing with a horribly slow system for two years now, because although my system was supposedly ""designed for windows vista"", it could barely support the OS. it was always slow, locking up and being a pain in my ass. many sources on the internet and even a family member that works in IT told me that downgrading to XP would be too much of a hassle and to just upgrade my memory. i wouldn't stand for it, because to me 1GB of RAM is more than enough to listen to music and browse the web.

so finally, i recently came across an article saying that the newer intel chipsets have some different aspect to them (i think the integrated graphics maybe?) and that only windows XP with SERVICE PACK 3 support those chipsets. so i came here, found this torrent, and what do you know... windows XP installed FLAWLESSLY, with no errors, and incredibly quick! i just downloaded WMP 11 today, and it passed windows genuine validation.

so to those of you wanting to downgrade from vista, do your research. everyone kept telling me it had to do with SATA hard drive compatibility issues, which apparently was not the case at all. it was chipset support that was only supported by service pack 3.

THANKS AGAIN TO THEGRIMREAPER123!!!! this torrent finally made it possible for me to love my computer! it runs fantastic now.

P.S. if you are downgrading from vista, make sure to have your modem and/or network card drivers saved to disk! thankfully i downloaded my network card driver before installing XP, otherwise i would've had no internet! and you will probably need to manually download your sound card driver as well."
,bbpwnt,2009-09-01T20:26Z,"Hey again. I just wanted to update to anyone worried about installing this that I've been using this for around three weeks now and I've had 0 problems with it. I've never been happier with a pirated OS like I am with this.

,muzikgirl,2009-09-13T09:10Z,"Installed this on vmware without having to burn a disk or use the product key:

Install on Vmware fusion (2.0.5) with mounted image (no need to burn CD) and no product key:

1.  Open Vmware Fusion
2.  Choose File>new
3. In the create New Virtual Machine screen choose ""continue without disk""
4.  In the Installation Media screen choose ""Use operating system installation disk image file and then navigate to your .iso image in the drop down menu
5.  Select the correct OS in the next menu (windows xp professional...in case you forgot)
6.  In the windows easy install screen unclick ""use easy install""
7.  In the finish screen you can either hit finish to complete the installation or choose customize settings to tweek your install.  If you use customize settings, Vmware will first prompt you to save the virtual machine before you continue.

,deepsixx,2009-10-08T23:22Z,"Someone near the beginning of the comments expressed similar issues such as myself. Namely the below default color and bit. Also stating that he was asked to provide a key and that it was not activated. Well I tried the link for the keys earlier in the comment and 3 of them didn't work, so I'm considering the rest not working. But that's really beside the point, I thought it was already activated. I followed your very brief instructions all but on two ends. Exact software listed, and the speed of the burn which you did not list in the original instructions. I read it after I burned it and I have never been told to do that before (standard procedure?). So I'm at a lost at how the burning speed would effect this issue."

,eldred03,2009-10-09T03:33Z,It asked for a key during my installation as well. I was installing on dell computer if that makes a difference.

Grim, you're my hero, this works beautiful. 

People like you make this place so special, 
and all the help & efforts you put in this...WOW

I just needed another language version and Microsoft forced me to re-install XP and now it's 
more beautyful then ever (Zune Theme) 

The only few people who might get problems probably burned the ISO at a too high speed. 

My first attempt (burned 24x) gave me issues during installation, second try (10x) went fine. 

It might be a good idea to boot and install this from USB. Anyone has experience how that goes?

That would be intersting to try.

do not upgrade it thats why it wont work  you HAVE to do a clean install by burning it to cd placing it in ur cd/dvd drive rebooting ur pc loading it from bios menu and formatting ur pc and do it that wayy"

,venutia,2009-12-31T22:47Z,"grim reaper, if you're out there----

Everyone seems to be saying your WGA fix works, but I'm concerned about microsoft update when using other MS software, like Office.  Won't it try and update office as well, and realize that one or the other is pirated?

(Like it would if I were to put the CD in while I were on my desktop.) See, the code I have for my disk is invalid (?) and it expires in 3 days. I looked online for some codes that I could try, but every time I go to 'Activate Windows' it doesn't come up. Even when I'm on the welcome screen and it says, 'Would you like to validate?' and I hit yes, it just takes me to my desktop. I'm worried that when my time is up it won't let me and either a) activate it with the codes I don't even have -_- or b) I'll be stuck with a useless computer until I completely reinstall WinXP. My disk got stepped on the week after I installed it and I just can't afford to go out and buy another disk. This is the only computer I have. ;n; That's why I'm considering this torrent, but I don't have any CD burning software/hardware."

I just finished reading the 15 pages of posts and cannot thank Grim enough for all the patient support he has provided!  The answer to your question is in there numerous times ... and in summary .... No, you cannot use it to upgrade xp home .. it is a clean install to a reformatted drive which means you will be starting over without anything on the drive if I am reading correctly.  Which also means you should back up
any files, documents, pics music etc you don't want to lose. Now in the sense you will be moving up from xp home to xp pro sp3 ... you could say it is an upgrade! ......

Secondly I want to make sure I have all the drivers I need backed up for easy access (I read somewhere to save the C:Windows\inf file but I would be concerned about overwriting SP3 files with SP2 files). The 40gb drive was devastated by a rootkit so I don't really trust the installed drivers although the rootkit has been  removed (used malwarebytes forum support, they are great!).  When I go to the Dell website, they don't show XP OS drivers for my system ... they only go up to NT OS although my system was upgraded to WIN XP SP2 at some time. Any advice on how to proceed? 

Thanks again!"

,Cracker_Jak,2011-07-03T05:52Z,"when your installing you will be prompted for service pack 3. Just use the same disk your installing with. Don't do what I did and try and install an actual sp3 disk!!!!!!! Other than that totally update-able and I also installed security essentials just to see if I could, and I could . So thanks for the up. Peace to all."
,TripHammer,2011-08-24T19:45Z,"Grim - I have no idea what happened between all these ""great reviews"" and when I downloaded a copy, but trying to load I got a acpi.sys driver corrupt error, locked up and when I rebooted my configuration had been changed in my bios, it would start up then shut off. I also got a ""your cpu has changed"" notice. EXCUSE ME??? WHAT THE F$$$ is going on? All I can say thank goodness it was an old pc I tried it on and not one of my better good ones! More than likely someone who downloaded it had a virus on their computer and when it reseeded it passed it on. Better get a CLEAN version out there."

,torrentic,2012-01-21T12:35Z,"I was getting disappointed with other releases, till I found yours.
