Tony Trischka, Bela Fleck - Solo Banjo Works

Though solo banjo music dates back at least to the late 1700s, Trischka and Fleck have brought it very much into the present with this collection of bluegrass tunes, originals, a Middle Eastern sojourn, rags, jazz, arrangements of Bach, Beatles, fiddle tunes and more! Playing a variety of both metal- and nylon-strung banjos, Fleck and Trischka utilize a variety of techniques as well, playing with and without picks -- there's even wah-wah pedal and various stomp-boxes employed on the album. Two tracks feature the duo performing together live.
