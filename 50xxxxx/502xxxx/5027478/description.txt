REMEMBER THE NAME


Craig Gass stopped by to promote his upcoming comedy shows and told the crew about a "secret meeting" he recently had a major movie studio. His assignment was to do the "looping" - dubbed over dialogue for clean movie edits â€“ so, for instance, instead of Nicholas Cage saying, "That's bullshit!" you hear Craig's impression of Nick saying, "That's hockeypuck!" Craig said it was a great gig, but the only condition was that he can't reveal which celebrities' voices he overdubs.
Craig told a story about doing the Richard Belzer roast and meeting Christopher Walken on the dais. Belzer forced him to do his Walken impression for Walken, but Walken was unimpressed: "Wow." Belzer than forced him to do his Tom Arnold and Adam Sandler impressions: "Walken cuts me off and goes, 'Wait a second. I get it. You're talented,' and goes back to eating his food."
