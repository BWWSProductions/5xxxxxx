This bootable ISO contains the setup files for Windows 95 OSR2.5, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), and Windows Millennium Edition (ME).

The setup files are unmodified, and the product keys are included.

I have included a text file that explains how to boot and use the CD. ***THERE IS A SPECIFIC PROCESS REQUIRED TO USE THIS CD, AND YOU WILL BE LEFT CLUELESS ON WHAT TO DO AFTER BOOTING IT UNLESS YOU READ THE TEXT FILE!!!***

Also on this CD are updates and enhancements for each OS, in the form of a self-extracting archive.

I am not the author of this ISO. I am uploading it because although it used to be on TPB, it recently dissappeared, and I happened to have the ISO.

Enjoy!

EDIT: I made a mistake in the Instructions.TXT file - at the A:/> prompt, you have to type d: , press enter, THEN type setup and press enter.
