Freddie Jackson thinks he owns the underworld when he gets out of prison. His wife Jackie just wants her husband home, but she's forgotten the rows, the violence, and the girls Freddie can't leave alone. Bitter, resentful, and increasingly unstable, Jackie watches her life crumble while her little sister Maggie's star rises. In love with Freddie's cousin Jimmy, Maggie is determined not to end up like her sister.

Families should stick together, but behind closed doors, jealousy and betrayal can fester. And for the Jacksons, loyalty cannot win out. Because in their world, you can trust no one. In their world, everyone is on the take.

Highly acclaimed for her hard-hitting, uncompromising, and haunting writing, as well as her phenomenal success, Martina Cole is the only author who dares to tell it like it is.
