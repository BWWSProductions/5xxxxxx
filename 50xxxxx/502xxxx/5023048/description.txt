microsoft windows server 2008 r2, dvd iso image, rtm, 7600.16385, you know the deal, same build day as win7, as the teams work together ever since vista sp1 events.

win7 has same foundation as win2008r2 server. refrain from asking moronic questions and acting out the douche publicly.


english, 64bit x64 build only, as there is no more 32bit world in the msft server business starting with microsoft windows server 20008 release2 aka r2.

look up the facts on your favorite noob tool named google or wikipedia if you are too brain-dead to understand sweet words.

any complaints? send em straight to the vole@microsoft.com
