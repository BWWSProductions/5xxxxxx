[T],torrentshredder,2009-07-26T00:00Z,"it used to be the way in server 2008 at least, that you could go from eval to both retail and volumelicensing just by using the serialnumber you buy, but you cannot go oem (serialnumber), as that works differently.

look at darrell gorter's (microsoft dev team et. al.) post at:

The question is, if I have the requirements above (assuming that an OEM key will be leaked), can I use this ISO?"
