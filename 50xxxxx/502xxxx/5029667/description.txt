This weeks' Yellow team consists of Major Dick Strawbridge, Kali Monroe, Dave Price and guest specialist Russell 'Mitch' Mitchell. 

The Orange team consists of Anne Saunders, Richard 'Bowser' Munson, Shen Chiu and guest specialist Harvey Porrett.

The challenge : build a contraption to enable a team member to retrieve 'gold' from a treasure chest 20 feet under water.

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. So please, do your part.
