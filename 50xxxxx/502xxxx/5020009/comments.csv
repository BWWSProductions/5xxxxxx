I know you hear this alot from uploaders but ill say it anyway. Can you guys please seed when you are done downloading. If you do so youll be helping me a great deal, this way i can upload more torrents faster. With your help I will upload as many games as possible. Iam also planning to upload games for other systems not just PSP. I have the complete [US] rom collections of the following, NDS(Up to date),GBA,GBC,GB,SNES,NES, and the Sega Genesis. And some roms for other systems. Well if you guys have any requests just post it up.

Thank You	"
