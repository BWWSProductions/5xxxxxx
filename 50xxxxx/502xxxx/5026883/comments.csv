,stevoGDF,2010-02-12T16:55Z,"Thanks for the Upload! Now, I wouldn't say that Jerry is God but he most definitely was an angel of some sort. He lives on in the hearts of fans all over the world who know that was more than a man with a message. The lyrics and kindness in his voice speak to the Rainbow Family [according to our government, they are the 2nd most watched 'terrorist' organization' in the U.S.] and their way of life. And, no, it's  nothing homosexual, check it out at http://www.welcomehere.org/. The official Rainbow Family website used to be welcomehome.org but if you type that in now you'll be redirected to the White House' web page.

Peace & Love,
Stevo"
