,jersson,2009-07-27T05:35Z,"Would you please upload latest vers 5.10 of Atomic Mail Sender if possible to crack, thank's"
,mroboto,2009-07-27T05:49Z,"jersson, i hesitate to upload the 32 bit version because i am not sure about the best way to activate it,but,when i have tried a combination of this keymaker and another keygen,from i don't exactly know where,that seems to work.no other patch needed."
,digdeep28,2009-07-27T07:44Z,fck off mroboto use this viruses and #stuuf# for yourself
,mroboto,2009-07-27T08:08Z,"digdeep28,you are not serious,you don't have any reason for what you comment here.

i don't have any doubt,this upload is clean.i use antivir and regrun security suite platinum,no trojan,viruses,rootkit in my system after installation.

just like i said,i don't want complaints about this if your anti virus scared you.

""no noobs comments please""

run it on a virtual pc or in sandboxie and tell me what you found with which tool .

if some serious people want to add serious comment,you are welcome.

if you found any real problem,t i will remove it as soon as i can."
,jersson,2009-07-27T12:34Z,"Digdeep28 you are really insulting mroboto and this guy never upload,s any virus, he,s one of the most trusted uploaders on PB so go and fuck yourself"
,Falkkon,2009-07-31T10:14Z,"False Positive dected with Kaspersky - Win32.Black.A. Here's why:

Some antiviruses detect files packed by stolen version of the Themida software protection program as Trojan.Packed.Win32.Black.a. Please note that clean files which have been packed using a stolen version may also be detected. 


In other words, the poor schmuck who packed the keygen and compiled it, used stuff that was dun dun dun dunnnnnnn pirated!"
,deonjahy,2009-07-31T23:29Z,"a little time consuming but it works including updates! good job and thanks for the upload and i just wanted to say that if anyone here is afraid of catching a virus then you shouldnt hang out with pirates! but no really there is no virus in this,i will seed to at least a 3.5 ratio"
,alexanderhuzar,2009-08-01T05:13Z,"Holy crud!!! This thing actually works (the crack)!!! So many other fakes out there (planetmaster), but this is the real deal! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!"
,alexanderhuzar,2009-08-01T11:17Z,"Works (tested by me just now) on Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate RTM running in a virtual machine in VMware workstation 6.5.2 build 156735 with UAC enabled. This does not, however, work on the RC1 build 7100. I guess Micro$oft changed a few things since then."
,AudiTQ,2009-08-02T14:20Z,"Thanks! Seems to be working- at last! 
Allthough the ""shopping"" icon is still present. Is it for you other guys too ? Running the DkActivationreminder.exe tells me that there is ""0"" (zero) days left of the trial. Wich my working 32bit version allso tells me so..i guess it works :) "
,mroboto,2009-08-02T15:24Z,"no,if you follow the instructions carefully,you can see (registered to:Your name) 

no shopping icon."
,AudiTQ,2009-08-04T09:54Z,"Yes, i did something wrong and i know what.  I uninstalled Diskeeper Now, no matter how i do it- it won't work. Trialware has expired.  Perhaps there is some leftovers from the previous installations."
,mroboto,2009-08-04T20:10Z,"In case of problem,you can choose repair diskeeper,and restart the operation to activate."
,diamond-optic,2009-08-07T02:53Z,"this works!! thanks a lot, been waiting for a working one for ages...

the one i was running seemed to be registered but then after 30 days it said trial expired.. uninstalled it and followed the directions with this one and it seems all good :D

running it on Win7 Build 7264 x64 (yes i know i need to update to RTM :P)

thanks again!"
,ItsReallyMe,2009-08-09T20:42Z,"Hello,
I have just one helpquest: can someone please explain point-to-point how can I export the new registerymark or should it be in some folder?

Thanx!"
,mroboto,2009-08-09T22:35Z,"open registry editor.

1.Click on start and the click on run
2.In run dialog box type regedit
3.Either press enter or click Ok button on the run dialog box
4.In registry editor,right click on the desired entry to export and click on Export."
,ItsReallyMe,2009-08-12T17:58Z,"Hello mroboto,

Thanx for trying to help. I have been using the registry editor also before, but cant understand this:

3. Go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\
	- Export the ""Diskeeper Corporation"" entry; name it ""Diskeeper1.reg"".

From wich file should I import the registry file?"
,mroboto,2009-08-12T23:51Z,"ItsReallyMe,when you are in the registry editor,look at the right bottom in the window,then when you click on the good entry to export,you can see  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Diskeeper Corporation"
,mroboto,2009-08-13T02:27Z,"Sorry,at the left bottom of the window."
,ItsReallyMe,2009-08-13T20:16Z,"Hello again,
I am at location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Diskeeper Corporation.
There is only one entry under it (Default) and it can not be renamed.
If I eaven then go to file and click export: it ask where would I like to save the registry key..."
,mroboto,2009-08-14T03:43Z,save it somewhere where you can right click on it and choose modify.
,Longtime1,2009-08-16T11:06Z,"Thank you very much.
Installed and works on Windows 7 64-bit without problems"
,Zenu,2009-08-20T13:45Z,"I am just going thru full re-install of OS after following instructions on this program. I have Win7 Professional (legit.). It failed when I was supposed to add disk2.reg to registry, it said some programs were in use so it couldn't update the registry, I then restarted computer and after Windows started up only cursor would appear in the screen. I couldn't access safemode for same reason and couldn't use safepoint with dvd because there wasn't one. I will now have to go thru hours of reinstalling everything back which stage I could skip earlier when I upgraded from Vista to 7.. I'm now slightly pissed off..."
,Zenu,2009-08-20T22:52Z,After some reinstalling process I tried this again and it ended up the same again. Again I couldn't get rid of the wow node anymore with the disk2.reg because some keys are in use there. This time around I had system restore points so I didn't have to install whole OS again.
,zinfinity,2009-08-21T07:59Z,"When I try to run the Keymaker as administrator, I get the error ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.  You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.""  Basically, I can't get Keymaker to run at all on my machine, therefore I'm stuck.

This doesn't seem right, any suggestions?"
,zinfinity,2009-08-21T08:13Z,"Nevermind, AVG wasn't fully disabled.  Had to go through a lengthy process to kill it."
,ykorotia,2009-08-28T10:53Z,"that's not his work, guys... too many thanks
that's just another torrent.

it's pretty clean. Keymaker.exe uses service stop/start, pc guid read and creates/deletes some diskeeper unique keys.
"
,Zenu,2009-09-04T13:12Z,"If someone gets this to work on windows 7, let me know .P"
,mroboto,2009-09-05T02:49Z,"It works with Vista and Windows 7,i have not tested with Xp 64 bit."
,Zenu,2009-09-05T15:57Z,"Can you then explain why I can't do the second edit of register because it says the keys are in use and can't be modified? Done everything as is instructed afaik. 

In first register edit when you apply the changes it copies every setting from the root folder under new directory and the second edit is supposed to change them back to the root but some keys in the copied Microsoft folder are in use and can't be removed/moved anymore."
,mroboto,2009-09-07T05:17Z,"Zenu, look if keymaker or veoveo processes are active and kill it before to clic on the .reg file with task manager or better process explorer http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx"
,r46u,2009-09-09T03:46Z,"Doesn't work for me. Did everything EXACTLY as instructed but after restart when I open up Diskeeper it says trialware has expired and a red button Buy it.
Now since I had Diskeeper previously installed on the machine (and removed), I thought maybe some traces remained that told it it was expired. So I uninstalled Dk, wiped the registry clean by removing any reference to diskeeper and removed anything that contained Diskeeper or executive from the C drive. Installed again from scratch following instructions EXACTLY (I even left the name in the Keymaker unchanged, just in case) and after restart at the end it keeps saying Trialware expired. Maybe there's still traces that I've missed or something. Any suggestions?"
,r46u,2009-09-09T03:46Z,"By the way, I'm running Vista Ultimate x64"
,jessez,2009-09-12T18:00Z,"first time i tryed this i messed up, because i was intimidated, but by the time i tryed the second time a min later it was very easy ; congrats bro you got the only working x64 2009 diskeeper torrent you rock way to put together a great torrent and for you retards that are 10 years old and finally learned how to hit scan on an anti- virus program, FUCKyou all keygens (hack) which reads malware. how you think you get the damn keys....."
,jessez,2009-09-12T18:03Z,dude just follow the directions with a 6th grade level and you can figure it out. i'm running it on vista 64bit ultimate works fine just give it a nother shot and make sure when you edditing your reg you export it to desktop name it like he says and just hit control H each time to replace the key lines and replace all and it will work btw when you are running the keymaker it has all the settings selected right already 
,jessez,2009-09-12T18:05Z,If you did it exactly like he said it would work so no more fucking complaining on such a genius torrent
,Bysheon,2009-09-13T18:54Z,"Thanks mroboto, impressive. 

Well explained step-by-step. Only thing that made me hesitate for a second during the install process was "" -Select the respective 'Edition', 'Type', 'License', and 'Licensee'"", but it is fairly obvious what to do there..

Anyway, installed on Windows 7. Works fine."

,IceWolf1102,2009-09-28T05:50Z,"mroboto,

unfortunately the step by step instructions didn't work for me :( it may work great for others, but just not me. When I start my Diskeeper it tells me I am running 30day trial, even though I followed your instruction guide to the letter.

I am trying to run it on Windows 7 7100 RC x64, maybe this is the reason why.. otherwise great job mroboto :) always good to see quality releases hit the scene.. just might need you help on this one though."
,mroboto,2009-09-30T05:22Z,"Did you right click and run as administrator on keymaker and veoveo?

Other than that,i don't know,maybe an antivirus or firewall???"
,MK41144,2009-10-11T15:29Z,This is working great on Windows 7 Ultimate.  Just follow the instructions!
,tonymontagna,2009-10-13T17:01Z,"Cavolo sei un genio ma chi l'ha fatto?? Ci ho messo un ora perchĂ¨ con Windows 7 c'era bisogno di attivare lo stato di account amministratore, per il resto tutto perfetto basta seguire le istruzioni passo passo, mi ha dato anche soddisfazione alla fine di tutto il processo perchĂ¨ prima con altri trorrent scaricati non riuscivo mai a craccarlo! complimenti e grazie."
,inAcrysis,2009-10-26T13:23Z,"Hi, I've got to step 8 & it says
Edition - diskeeper professional premier
type - hyperfast
license - individual
licensee - vdown
EXACTLY what next? do I change anything?
I click ""clear keys"" ""generate"" ""register"" then when i click ""patch"" a box opens with select target file ""tab"" dynamic link library.
there was nothing where it was so i went to the veoveodll.dll but it says access to target file denied & a load of ""nothing has been changed""
8. In the Keymaker:
	- Select the respective ""Edition"", ""Type"", ""License"", and ""Licensee"".
		DO NOT press the ""Apply"" buttons yet.
	- Press in order: Clear Keys > Generate > Register > Patch.
	- Press each ""Apply"" button from top to bottom.
On license it says ""you may have to restart to see effect"" 
Do i just goto step 9 or did i mess up somewhere?
please help"
,inAcrysis,2009-10-26T13:35Z,"I just made copy of veoveodll & renamed it ""Tab"" & when i clicked patch it said ""operation completed, none of the patterns found""
? is that right or not?
step 9?"
,inAcrysis,2009-10-26T13:36Z,"oh no - new page of comments - mroboto please read previous page i posted on too.
Help! please"
,inAcrysis,2009-10-26T13:48Z,"well, that failed. 
I don't understand why. Presume when clicking on patch that it's supposed to use the veoveodll itself, without me having to find it etc. so why is it not doing it?"
,mroboto,2009-10-26T19:21Z,"There is a file in the diskeeper folder named Tab.dll,seems to be the file you have to patch,but why it is not automaticly patched and why access denied,i dont know Admin rights,UAC?"
,mroboto,2009-10-26T19:26Z,Or Tab.dat
,inAcrysis,2009-10-26T19:37Z,"oh great you are here.
No, UAC is off, one of 1st things I do to a pc.
I followed guide to the letter but at step 8 -- like I already said.
will try again"
,inAcrysis,2009-10-26T19:42Z,"also, now I've tried it do I need to uninstall & reinstall or just start from step 5 as I've still got both reg files 1&2 saved?"
,inAcrysis,2009-10-26T20:41Z,tried patching tab.dll in diskeeper folder. still nothing. this is getting frustrating now.
,inAcrysis,2009-10-26T20:55Z,"when patching Tab.dll the keymaker keeps ""not responding"" for 2 secs then goes again but tab.dll is not changed at all."
,Megatronic,2009-11-01T17:23Z,"Hi, I have 7 x64 Pro and I am having the same issue where everything goes fine.....but I can't write the second reg file to the registry. The Diskeeper service is off, and the keymaker and veoveo arn't working. Anyone found a way round this?"
,Megatronic,2009-11-01T17:48Z,Never mind....figured it out. I clicked on the whole HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ instead of just Diskeeper Corporation. It said the keys were already in use as it was trying to alter keys relevant to lots of other windows programs....so I am guessing the other users who reported being unable to add diskeeper2.reg to the registry did the same thing. Hope this helps someone :)
,senseisimplet,2009-11-15T04:13Z,"works excellent. didn't work at first, gave me the 30 day trial nag, but i realized made the same mistake as a few others and exported the whole Wow6432Node  key which gave me a 50MB file of all my applications entries. the instructions clearly say to export the Diskeeper... key from INSIDE the Wow6432Node key... all i had to do to fix was stop the diskeeper service, export properly, merge and start the service back up... Perfect!"
,DixonNxn,2009-11-18T04:25Z,"When I press patch in the keymaker a window opens with a tab file, should i press cancel? also there is no diskeeper corporation in the Wow registry once I get past the keymaker step..

,Takster,2009-12-02T13:49Z,Over complicated shitty patch. If you fuck reg2 you wont be booting into windows again. That's an unacceptable fail in my book. Worst patch yet.
