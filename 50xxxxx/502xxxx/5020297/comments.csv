[T],ripthejacker420,2009-07-25T15:29Z,haha i hear u bro. as far as i know he hasn't come out with his new album. check out my torrents though because i believe i have most if not all of his other albums. if not i will be sure to get them all up there for you.    canibus was a visionary indeed! he believed light could travel in multiples of c. the organic super computer that solved the mysteries of klein-kaluza with two blue metric rulers.... lol 
[T],jmb2012,2009-07-28T22:11Z,"I have every track hes done that I know of, Poet Laureate II of course one of the best collabs he done agreed?! You know he wrote the lyrics, then sent them to stoupe(jmt) amazing ain't it.
PLOO is the most create thought provoking song EVER writin to date. I want to hear the RTJ:Infinity album I'm fiending for it.

[T],ripthejacker420,2009-07-29T12:52Z,"excellence.  but yes PLII is simply one of the greatest songs ever created. and yes i know how he did RTJ. it's quite amazing how a man can spit lyrics and when they are blindly placed over a beat they are still so beautiful. i almost wish stoupe had done all his album's beats because RTJ is probably my favorite album (although a can't say i have a favorite because they are all masterpieces.)  i have been fiending for more ever since  the c of tranquility ep came out. those tracks just fortified the fact that he hasn't and can't ever lose his perfection and superbness.  by the way, i all 5 have his PLOO layers with just the lyrics. i downloaded this program called ""virtual dj"" which allows you to take two tracks and dj with them. so, i used bus' PLOO lyrics and laid them over instrumentals and made some crazy sounding songs. let me know if you'd like to have some. also, i will put the lyrics only PLOO up for you and everyone. good day my new friend=) take care"

[T],jmb2012,2009-07-29T21:58Z,"BTW if you can, might aswell upload the accapellas, I will DL and seed they are not available on torrents sites as of now."
[T],ripthejacker420,2009-07-30T14:28Z,"ok my friend acapella's uploaded for your enjoyment=)  please seed as much as you can because my stupid ISP gives me a 10gb limit on bandwidth per month and i have recieved warnings already saying i have exceeded my ""bandwidth limit"" and if i continue to do so i must pay more money for more bandwidth or some bullshit. this makes it SO fuckin hard for me to even upload a game or movie or 2. makes me so mad.  btw whats the difference with the new virtual dj u uploaded?  ok man i gota get 2 bed. ttys my friend"
