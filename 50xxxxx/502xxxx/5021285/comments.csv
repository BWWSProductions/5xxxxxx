,garfieldgurl,2009-09-20T05:47Z,"There's nothing in this ""dvd"". I used daemon tools and then VLC to open it but i only get ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" in pink and a small box with a hand in gray color. What's up with that? "
,LS7,2009-09-28T16:43Z,"This is a huge advertisment for Galaxy.net. Once you sit through the advertisment, you get to the low quality, tiny sized rip of the movie. DON'T download this. There are many out there that are worth your time, this absolutly is not."
,capnJB,2009-10-09T20:00Z,Pretty frustrating with all of those advertisements at the beginning. Quality of movie is descent at best. I would recommend not wasting your time with this one and finding a better one with less non sense and better quality..
