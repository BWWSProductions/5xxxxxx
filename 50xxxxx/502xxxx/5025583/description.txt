The game is based around tuning cars for street races, resuming the
Need for Speed: Underground storyline. Need for Speed: Underground 2
provides several new features, such as a broader customization,
new methods of selecting races, the "explore" mode (just driving
around freely, like the Midnight Club series, in a large city known
as "Bayview"). Underground 2 also introduces several SUVs, which could
be customized as extensively as other Underground 2 vehicles and used
to race against other SUV racers. Brooke Burke is the voice of
Rachel Teller, the person who guides the player through the story.
