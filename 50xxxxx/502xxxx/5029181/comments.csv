,Pompeius,2009-11-27T11:01Z,"There's a lot broken files in it! Chapter 18 for example: films 2, 3, 7, 8, 10 and 12. The same as torrent by gordsmash."
,Bugsy_B,2010-03-14T17:03Z,"There are several movies missing from this. 
I noticed the placeholders were there for them while downloading the torrent but the sizes for all the missing movies was 2mb while all the other movies were much bigger. 
When I had it all done, the movie folders all had a bunch of movies that wouldn't play...when I checked them against the files my Azureus said were only 2mb, it turns out they are the same ones. 
My suggestion to the contributor is delete this one and re-up the full DVD with all movies.
Don't let your name be attributed to trash.  "
