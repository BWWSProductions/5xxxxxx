non-fiction. Ewan McGregor and his friend Charley Boorman go on a roadtrip on bikes. they travel around the world from England to U.S.A. (or something) exclusively on bikes (except when crossing water bodies). i saw this on discovery and was smitten by 
the genuine love the two guys had for this trip. they were excited like children about it. in the series, they go through places like afghanistan and stuff. they interact with a vast variety of people which is the most fun part of the show. really awesome documentary.
