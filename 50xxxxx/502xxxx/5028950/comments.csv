I told you already that this does not come with any keys. So don't come crying to me for it.

And there are no viruses. Make sure your game is in the directory you put it, which is StarCraft by default."
,Demosthenes928,2009-10-10T14:11Z,I'll give you a plus for providing such an amazing little program. Takes the HUGE hassle out of changing CD-keys (i.e. uninstalling then reinstalling Starcraft just to change something as small as the CD-key).
,Arg_the_pirate,2009-10-10T18:28Z,"Thanks. That does get quite annoying.

But remember. I'm only the provider. I didn't make this. "
,DoubleVision,2009-12-30T11:41Z,you wouldn't happen to know where i can get a program like this for mac would you? sorry just had to ask..
,Arg_the_pirate,2010-01-12T04:59Z,"Sorry man, I don't. If this isn't working on Mac, I'll add that to the description.
