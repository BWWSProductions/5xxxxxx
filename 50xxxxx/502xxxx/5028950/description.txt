FALSE POSITIVE WARNING: Some anti-virus programs may detect the crack contained within the key changer as a trojan. 

Ignore it. Thanks.


This is an authentic CD-Key changer for StarCraft.

The file size is small, yes, but it is not that large a file.

Just run the executable, and click "Change CD-Key". Then re-enter whatever info you want to put.

Please note that this is NOT a key generator and won't work with any other key. You need one that you got from a generator itself or yours when you bought it.

And also, you MUST have StarCraft installed. When you run it, it will ask for the directory that StarCraft is in. It will need to detect certain files, and it won't work without the game installed on your computer. Sorry.

Thank you. Now download and enjoy, friends.
