     Ice is the third official single by Canadian singer Lights and her only single to be released in 2009. Ice is a upbeat tempo song regarding how her boyfriend has "turned to ice" and left her in the cold. Created with various synths and a small loop of music, Ice is a great representation of who Lights is.

The video of Ice was released shortly following the single. Most of the video was made by Lights herself, spending over a week on the props. The monsters who are in the second part of the video are played by Light's band who perform with her on stage (Maurie Kaufmann and Adam Weaver)

Ice was originally supposed to be released as her second single, but was pushed back for February Air. Lights herself has said that "Ice" was actually one of her favorite songs that she had written.
