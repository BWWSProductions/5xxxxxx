I haven't seen this show since I was a kid. Simply brilliant to be able to watch it again & in colour - not b&w as it was on Australian TV in the early 70's.

Regarding the ""tancanel"" comment; what do you expect for a 40 year old show...that no-one else has? Maybe 'he' can upload his DVD-quality version..."
