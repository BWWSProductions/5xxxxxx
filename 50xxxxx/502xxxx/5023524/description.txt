FATAL FURY - WILD AMBITION:

A classic SNK game enters the third dimension with FATAL FURY: Wild Ambition. Choose from 10 characters, each with unique fighting styles and moves. Then practice the moves in the training mode, or tackle the story-driven arcade mode, where every character has different motivations and goals. Should your friends want to experience the action, challenge them to a match in the versus mode. No matter what mode you play, keep an eye on your heat gauge as it rises, you will be able to pull-off a heat-blow that will stun your opponent and allow a few extra hits. However, if your heat gauge reaches zero, you will be stunned and receive a thrashing. In addition to heat-blows, characters also have super-special skills and overdrive attacks. Can you master all of the skills in FATAL FURY: Wild Ambition?
