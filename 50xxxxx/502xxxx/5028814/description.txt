U2 DVD Live in Paris 11th July 2009 - Revised


Sorry, on the first release, the chapters are wrong, so I've corrected it on this version. If you're downloading the first version, there's 2 changes from this one. 

1. The last few chapters are named wrong
2. I also made a few changes to the sound file to remove some echo's which can be heard at various places.

Please give me your comments



I would like to express an image that rests in my head. This is the image of my ex-girlfriend, standing over me, with a gun against my head. This was 4 years ago in France when we seperated.

Although the French police found her finger prints on the gun, and 4 rounds left in the gun plus one in the chamber, they did nothing. No court case. No help for me.

Her name was SANDRA CALVARUSO. She's dangerous. She lives in Lexy in France (near the Luxembourg border)

I realise there's little I can do about this, but I want to tell people about the racism in France. I'm British, and seem to not be allowed the same protection as French people in France.

If by any chance, someone who reads this is sufficiently powerful to help me out against the government, to investigate the matter as opposed to sweeping it under the carpet to protect their own citizen, then please contact me.

Thanks for your time.
