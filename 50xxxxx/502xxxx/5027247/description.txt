Human Edge
Episode: Dead Man Walking 2005
 
Himzo Muratovic, a Bosnian Muslim, turned up in a taxi in his home village 12 years after family and friends had given him up for dead. Himzo had disappeared in the early 1990s during the height of the ethnic cleansing campaign by Serbian forces. His return was a shock to the senses for everyone. For family it was joy at the return of a son. For neighbours it was a painful reminder of what they had lost and fuelled burning questions about what happened. When answers are not forthcoming - Himzo claims he doesn't remember - intrigue erupts into fury. This film attempts to uncover what happened during those 12 lost years and reveals a community haunted by tragedy.
