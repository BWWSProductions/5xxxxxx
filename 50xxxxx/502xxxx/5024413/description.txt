BBC Documentary - Why I Hate the 60s: The Decade That Was Too Good to Be True (2004) (TV)


Credits to thebox.bz for capping and uploading this long ago.


Genre: Documentary


Starring: Chris Langham, Terry Eagleton, Marianne Faithfull, Timothy Leary, Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, Twiggy. 



Plot: 

The myth of the 60s was created before the decade was out. But what we have lived with ever since is a mirage, a mass hallucination, a fantasy.

Why I Hate the Sixties examines the truth behind the myth. It suggests that we were living on borrowed time - we partied as Britain lost an empire and slid into unchecked industrial decline.

Archive footage and contributors of all political stripes build the case against the decade where dreams turned to nightmares.
