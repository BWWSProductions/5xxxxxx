Storyline: In I Love You, Man, a comedy from John Hamburg (Along Came Polly, 
co-writer of Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers, Zoolander), Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd, Knocked Up The 40 Year 
Old Virgin) is a successful real estate agent who, upon getting engaged to the woman of his dreams, Zooey, 
(The Offices Rashida Jones), discovers, to his dismay and chagrin, that he has no male friend close enough 
to serve as his Best Man. Peter immediately sets out to rectify the situation, embarking on a series of 
bizarre and awkward man-dates, before meeting Sydney Fife (Jason Segel, Forgetting Sarah Marshall), a 
charming, opinionated man with whom he instantly bonds. But the closer the two men get, the more Peters 
relationship with Zooey suffers, ultimately forcing him to choose between his fiancÃ©e and his new found 
bro, in a story that comically explores what it truly means to be a friend.
