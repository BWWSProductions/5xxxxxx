This is my first attempt to create a torrent and a dvd :)

I've just downloaded the avi file from: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4963907/James_Taylor___Squibnocket_VHS
(so mountains of thanks to chas10e, the original uploader) and then made a dvd cause I wanted to play it anywhere... and find the songs easily, so I added chapters (and a menu) as follows:

1 Intro 
2 Secret of life
3 Wandering
4 Traffic jam
5 Interview I
6 (I've got to) Stop thinkin' 'bout that
7 You've got a friend
8 Interview II
9 Fire and rain
10 Sun on the Moon
11 The frozen man
12 Shed a little light
13 Interview III
14 Copperline
15 Sweet Baby James
16 Interview IV
17 Country road
18 Mexico
19 Your smiling face
20 You can close your eyes	

PS: If, for any reason, you feel the urge to thank me for this torrent, please do the same with chas10e
