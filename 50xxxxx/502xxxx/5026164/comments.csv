,Nuovo_Cinema_Pirata,2010-02-02T18:32Z,"Sorry but you can't really consider this movie a ""..bizarre ...low budget Asian movie that Hollywood will never remake."" The very well directed (Fruit Chan) and wonderfully shot (Christopher Doyle, HKSC) ""Gaau Ji"" it's been raped in this very bad quality rip. Seeing what was a masterpice of lighting, shooting and colouring in this very low definition 4:3 letterbox ""havoc"" is an insult to the work of two contemporary masters of NOT JUST IN ASIA cinema. A total waste of time and bandwidth. "
