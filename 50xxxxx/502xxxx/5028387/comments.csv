,icanseeu,2009-08-27T19:20Z,I don't know what antivirus you use enigma but nod32 detected a virus and quarantined it. I decided to download the older version from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4851859/Active_Desktop_Calendar_v7.75_%5BBRD-Keygen%5D_%5BEng%5D_%5BArx%5D and didn't find any viruses.
