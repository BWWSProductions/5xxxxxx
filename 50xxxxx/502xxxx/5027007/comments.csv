''The specified ISO file is not recognized Windows 7 image''"
,xwildmanx,2009-07-28T15:02Z,"I installed and worked perfectly, including updates, thanks a lot"
,ART2008,2009-07-28T16:57Z,Home premium ENG is work ??
,Maller,2009-07-28T19:00Z,"@xwildmanx

The reason this image isn't a ""recognized Windows 7 image"" is be course it's been modified. The check sums are different cause the size is different.
That doesn't mean it's not the RTM version."
,mrjibas,2009-07-28T19:24Z,c'mon i need your help.please can someone tell me how did this is instaled?

,sarakawa,2009-07-29T23:29Z,"Can you upgrade from vista or must you do a clean install?
Thx"
,greybigtop,2009-07-31T00:35Z,"Installed 7 Ultimate RTM and works perfectly in my native language too.
Activated like a charm as well.
However. running windows updates, windows tells me NO UPDATES AWAILABLE, which I know aint true because earlier versions provided updates for hardware such as soundcard etc.
Does anyone know if this might be due to updates to the final RTM version not being available untill the official release date?"
,oliviers75020paris,2009-08-01T00:02Z,"Hello! Thw for the download. I installed it perfectly... but I don't know how to activate it???
Thank you for your help"
,greybigtop,2009-08-01T00:18Z,"Internet is ON, but windows 7 ultimate RTM says NO AVAILABLE UPDATES!!!!!!!!!!!
Tried several clean installs, same result.

BTW, I even tried updating within the 30 day grace periode before applying any activation cracks, same result.
Any suggestions? 

PS

I installed the danish version and everything else works 100%"
,greybigtop,2009-08-01T03:30Z,"Tried to install english version, which CAN be updated.
Perhaps the smaller languages like danish will be updateable a little later..............?"
,fgghjjkll,2009-08-01T04:43Z,"language packs prolly change the region settings too?
if so, ur country prolly doesnt have updates at the mo."
,oliviers75020paris,2009-08-01T09:09Z,"hello greybigtop, please, can you say how you you activated windows 7?? THX"
,greybigtop,2009-08-01T19:19Z,"Tried many activators on as many clean 7 installs.
HazarÂ´s 7 activator works perfectly for me.
Stat"
,greybigtop,2009-08-01T19:20Z,"Status after activation:

,Kristallprinz,2009-08-02T15:45Z,"Where I can find the german Languagepack only?

Possibly someone has an idea?"
,table543,2009-08-03T16:41Z,"Does anyone know: Will windows 7 OEM allow you to update/upgrade from Vista?
Or, must do clean install? "
,janjappie,2009-08-03T17:41Z,thanks! 
,Tyrconnell,2009-08-05T17:54Z,"@ table543

option to upgrade is given, i did a clean install.
you can always give it a try, but i do advice to backup first.

i used  Orbit30 and Hazar 7loader v1.2 to activate, did the job. don't know yet about updates."
,marc2040,2009-10-06T18:08Z,"worked for me, but:

got office 2007 from TPB. after installation of windows 7 ultimate, the uninvited friend OGA came. had to download Microsoft Genuine Advantage (WGA-OGA) Crack. worked. after that downloaded 7loader_release_5 (see comment).

now everything is fine.

So, WELL DONE >>> THANK YOU"
,computer_guy_finnish,2009-10-25T09:34Z,"Hi!

I was wondering about THREE different kind of things..

1) Is this torrent a DEMO or a FULL (or an UPGRADE) version of Windows 7 Ultimate? Does it have all those 36 different languages, even Finnish?

2) What should I do about all those .RAR packs, should I put them in one .ISO file or what?

3) Is torrent a CLEAN one and how many people have noticed that this Windows 7 has worked?

Thank you and have a great autumn!"
,yannickvanhex,2009-11-14T10:30Z,"Works perfectly, full version , legit, upgraded without any loss. Works like a charm for over 1 month"
