Next time use PC instead of CPU. Except for that description is good, congratz. And thank you for this torrent."
[T],Akamaru-,2009-08-17T02:44Z,"ok buddy my new releases will be updated and It will say PC instead of CPU, but my whole question to you is, if you new what we meant why bother writing a comment on it if it gets the point across? if people know that the xbox and the mac have no cpu then it is obvious that we meant PC therefore, there being no need to point out the obvious. Cheers though, i appreciate you noticing the discrepancies. "
,skippy12094,2010-04-26T23:29Z,l would tell snaketusv  to stop his/ her crap.  Some of us aren't perfect.  Why would he/she write computers instead of computer's when speaking in a possessive tense. So cut the crap and watch movies.
