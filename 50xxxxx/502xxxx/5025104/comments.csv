,matty1111,2009-10-15T20:41Z,"Yeh i bet it is , no offence to Americans but Darwin seems to be a very controversial over there - he has never been here (recently anyway) I went to a Catholic high school and I was taught about Darwin, his scientific beliefs the the Big Bang theory, dinosaurs were billions of years old, etc, etc,  EVOLUTION basically, we were not told the Earth was 5000 years old ever - at least i can't remember been, R.E. wasn't my favourite lesson and was very short - (half an hour a week) and as i remember was more about other things nothing to do with religion a lot of the time  (Drugs, morality, etc were some of the other subjects we covered) ,we have Darwins face on the back of every ten pound note here in the UK.
I'm hearing in the US you are having trouble getting anyone to distribute to new Evolution film (about Darwins life and struggles) and about cinemas refusing to show it!
sounds crazy to most brits, even a lot of Christians prob think banning the film is over the top over here."
[T],IndianChristian,2009-11-28T17:58Z,"This gotta be the joke of the millennium. And here is the old fool Dawkins making a monkey out of you?

As rightly said, Evolution is an idea....that is what it is ...just an idea....a nonsensical idea.

Evolution does not explain: 
1. How and why we are here. What is the first cause?

2. The missing link tree. Only the roots and leaves are visible. Where is the trunk and the branches? The fossil evidence gives a resounding kick to evolution.

3. The complexity of a cell proves evolution is false

4. The error correction in DNA shows the Bible is correct and evolution is false. Variations can happen only with kinds never across kinds. 

5. The supposed Cambrian explosion shows that species did not evolve gradually but came at one time.

6. The mechanism how one species changes to another and why it is not observed today?

7. Why do we have a moral inbuilt law which tells us right from wrong? And why animals don't have this?

8. Why we need to be moral citizens if we have really evolved from monkeys?

People supporting evolution...keep dreaming to your doom."

I am not older than 20 and I can think of evidence against at least 5 of your ""proofs"" of the top of my head. Take the time to research a topic before rejecting it."

Christians like you are the joke of the millennium.

Not one of your claims has any merit, I suggest you take your nose out the bible and go do some research (nota bene: Googling ""Intelligent Design"" is not research).

Thanks for the share, Sheila."

You are such a detriment to society. Attempting to disprove fact by calling upon various logical fallacies gets you nowhere. This is analogous to saying the theory of gravity is false because of airplanes. Whomever says such a thing has no idea what is actually happening. "

Taxanomically we are still apes...The same way a car is still a car even if it possessed sentience/intelligence (e.g. knight rider??), we are still apes, animals...

""As rightly said, Evolution is an idea....that is what it is ...just an idea....a nonsensical idea.""
A nonsensical ""idea"" supported by a vast majority of biologists, remember - scientists have more credibility than those who assert w/o evidence.

""Evolution does not explain:
1. How and why we are here. What is the first cause?""
Evolution is to explain the DIVERSITY of life, not the origin of life itself or the universe.

""2. The missing link tree. Only the roots and leaves are visible. Where is the trunk and the branches? The fossil evidence gives a resounding kick to evolution.""
On contraire.


""3. The complexity of a cell proves evolution is false""
You confuse abiogenesis with evolution.


""4. The error correction in DNA shows the Bible is correct and evolution is false. Variations can happen only with kinds never across kinds.""
The error correction present in animals is far from perfect and mutations/malformations still do occur. Cancer is an everyday example of the effects of genetic mutation. Variations occur through all ""kinds"" of animals.

""5. The supposed Cambrian explosion shows that species did not evolve gradually but came at one time.""
You fail to mention that the Cambrian ""explosion"", or the time frame in which it occured was SEVENTY MILLION YEARS.

""6. The mechanism how one species changes to another and why it is not observed today?""
Speciation has already been observed with microorganisms, fruit flies, lizards and various animals.

""7. Why do we have a moral inbuilt law which tells us right from wrong? And why animals don't have this?""
Animals DO have this, notice: wolf packs.
Its not as complex as human morality, but its complicated enough to be looked at comparatively.

""8. Why we need to be moral citizens if we have really evolved from monkeys?""
Because without morality and a set of rules we would die and suffer a heck of a lot more.

""People supporting evolution...keep dreaming to your doom.""
Ahh yes the boogey man is coming to get you!!!"

Well the last of your questions are explaining evolution by it self.

6, 7, 8
instinkts tells us to do anything to survive and allways be stronger than outher species. This instinkt is evolution. Everything living has it. Without it there would not be any life.

What you call moral is instinkt. In your words all living creatures have moral since all of us wants our kin to survive. It's instinkt/moral that tells us not to eat our children. I guess you think that cows, for exampel, have a very high moral since you probably never heard of a cow eating it's child.
Many animals doesent kill anything at all. Is that because they have a higher sense of moral than us humans?
I guess monkies kills, rapes and steal a lot less than humans. So don't you think they have higher moral standards than us?
Or is it that they walk around naked that makes you think they lack moral?
That's silly."
,Darwonka,2010-02-26T20:44Z,"I love it when someone tries to argue against evolution by natural selection by being ignorant to what evolution by natural selection is.
I also love it that I know the Bible better than most of the people who believe it like it's a history book."
