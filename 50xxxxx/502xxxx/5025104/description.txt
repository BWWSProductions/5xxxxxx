In 1859, Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species â€“ and nothing would ever be the same again. Evolution by natural selection is probably the most powerful idea anyone ever had.

In this three-part series for Channel 4 (UK), Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary scientist and bestselling author, takes us on a journey of discovery. How does evolution work? How do we know itâ€™s true - and why do some people still deny it? As evolved creatures, do we have to be callous, selfish and immoral? Dawkins echoes Darwinâ€™s emphatic "no".

In the course of his journey, Richard Dawkins visits a New York sperm bank and talks to the women about how they choose the genes of their children. He takes us to Lambeth Palace to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury - and to Kenya to visit that spectacularly well preserved fossil - the Turkana Boy. With its fascinating interviews, stunning photography and authoritative and good-humoured commentary, this series is a must for all who want to understand why we exist.



Enjoy and Seed!!
