,pirates_life,2010-03-06T20:48Z,"E-323-JSH-026-XQT-305-GEH-415-PFL-MEB-X37B 

After I upgraded my OS, I lost my license. this one just worked for FCS 3.."
,juanclau,2010-10-07T10:10Z,"bizerkly,

That happened to me when I accidentally installed an update through the software updates:
Pro Applications Update 2010-02

This update completely invalidates the serial number. The solution is to uninstall FCS and re-install, then your serial number will work. Remember to avoid running the update again.

Anybody has a serial that works with these updates?"
,Irep,2010-12-14T07:10Z,"please i was wondering if you can provide new serial number, the one u have provided are not working"
