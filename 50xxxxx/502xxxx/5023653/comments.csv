Oh, and I do have a Linux box, but I use that for work, so I can't have it chugging away converting files all the time :P

On the other hand, my Windows Vista machine really only gets used when I'm uploading to RS/MS, downloading (non-torrent), watching vids, or web-surfing.  So I might as well put the darned thing to work :D"
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-07-28T01:20Z,"I doubt I'll re-release them separately, but you can always just download the ones you want ...

When you add the torrent to your torrent client, just SELECT only the files you want.  All the major torrent clients allow you to selectively download specific files.

---------------------

On the other hand, hard drive space is really cheap these days, you can get an inexpensive portable HDD for very little these days and that would give you quite a bit more storage space."
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-07-29T16:33Z,"HR is right ... 

uTorrent is really the best thing you can use to download torrents with.

It's free, has no ads, and it works very, very well."
,romeox145,2009-08-01T18:32Z,Hey vov i downloading all of your new hd star wars onto my ipod touch and iphone but it doesnt play all the way through.  Do you know of anyone eles that has this problems? thanks
[T],VixenofVenus,2009-08-02T05:36Z,"@ romeox145

If you can open them in iTunes and click towards the end and see the credits, then they downloaded correctly but just didn't sync to your iPod correctly.

If you can't see the credits via iTunes / Quicktime ... they didn't download correctly and you'll need to re-download the ones that don't work.  Sometimes this happens with torrents unfortunately.

But I know all of my files are working fine, in fact, I just finished watching Jedi on my Touch yesterday ... I didn't have any issues with them."
,romeox145,2009-08-03T00:22Z,I just re-downloaded them and tried again.  It works now.  I guess there was a glitch with my computer. Its a wonderful download great quality.  Thank you again 
,motorazr,2009-09-10T05:32Z,Thanks.....
,windscar,2009-10-26T14:10Z,"Are the deleted/extra scenes edited into the movie files, particularly Episode II?"
,CakeMonster,2009-12-08T09:40Z,"Are the episode 4-6 the original or the remakes

Are the episodes 1-3 normal edition or extended edition?

What does the ipod mean can you only watch themon an ipod or what?"
,xxxdave666,2009-12-18T02:53Z,great torrent but where can i find fullscreen versions of these movies its wierd watching letterbox movies on a 20 inch tv as only 2/3rds of the screen has a picture please let me no where to get full screen versions thnks and great upload
,Car_Gussy,2010-03-18T04:53Z,"Very great torrent! I did have an issue (And maybe this isn't a problem with everyone) is it seems that all but Episodes 1 and 3 are off pitch. In-fact, they're about a half-step sharp. Is it the way I downloaded? 

And is there a solution? It's really bugging me, as not only does it make the into theme sound very off, it makes all characters in that episode sound way younger and off..."
,Car_Gussy,2010-03-19T02:58Z,"Also, they're all out of sync for me! Did something go wrong with the download or do these converted videos not have very good audio? (Littles things like this really get on my nerves in videos and it hampers my ability to enjoy it. It sounds picky, but it's just the way I am)."
[T],VixenofVenus,2010-05-08T12:12Z,"If these are all out of Sync for you, then something went wrong.

A) your video codecs are not up to date or installed correctly.
B) the files were corrupted during download
C) iTunes or your iPod are corrupted
D) you need your hearing checked.


I've watched these files multiple times on both PC, Mac, and on my iPods (both on screen and through TV-Out) ... they're in sync.

As for the off-pitch thing.  I've gotten that comment before, and usually it has to do with a low bass setting on whatever audio system you're using.  On iPods and most portables, the sound is normal.

---

No matter where I upload these, I always include the screen shots, and someone invariably asks if the OT films are Special Edition or not -- they are, and if you look at the screens, you'll be able to tell.

E4 - There is a moon in the first screen shot, it wasn't there in the Theatrical.
E5 - Emperor Palpatine's holo-image is now the actor from E6 and the PT, not a rubber puppet like in the Theatrical.
E6 - In the Theatrical, when Palpatine arrived on the Death Star, there were about 30-50 soldiers standing at attention, in the screen I provided, there are 200+ ... obvious CGI.

---

As for finding FULL-SCREEN versions ... I almost ignored your comment.  Uh ... I have no idea.  Honestly, watching Full Screen, IMO, is like insulting the people who made the movie by saying ""I only want to watch part of it"" -- because literally, that's all you're seeing, part of the film and ignoring the rest."
,m3throbot,2010-06-15T04:45Z,"Thank you VoV you do the best handhelds in my opion. The way the look through the 360 is almost DVD quality and i have a 42"" so thats good.
