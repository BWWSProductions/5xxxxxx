The video begins with a guy trying to sign up for a mining job, but fails. Meanwhile a girl works at a diner and accidentally spills pop on a female customer. Her boss starts yelling at her and fires her. The next camera shot is at the couple's home, their neighbor is leaving for a musical gig. Both argue about their foreclosure of their home. The final segment begins the next morning when the man wakes up and leaves. The girl wakes up and can't find him.
