but i found it very difficult to make DVD from mtk files :-( Any explanation on how to do it???  

Does anyone have image file?

Thx"

Great DVD. Could you please tell me how I can put it back to dvd format (and watch it on my tv with a normal dvd player) with the menus?

Cheers,
"
,SOARiNGBiRD,2009-12-19T23:35Z,"Hi, you can convert to dvd quite easily with ConvertXtoDVD. With it, you can make your own menus too. The menu I made can't be burned.

The whole image would be 8GB, because the original dvd is dual layer. To burn it you would also need dual layer dvd's. No big deal, but more of a hassle. As I said, the best option is to burn to a 4,5GB dvd using ConvertXtoDVD. Even better is to burn it in two parts to two dvd's for better quality (or to one dual layer dvd for that matter). If there is some demand I can upload the image, just ask."

Thank you for your quick reply. I have watche plenty of Paragliding Aerobatics DVDs althought there are many very good like Jockey Sanderson Tryology, Mike Kung ground handling and many others this a very complete (Acro/Siv) exploring in full the issue.
I would be more than graetfull if the image could be uploaded.
Many thanks,"

Cheers"
