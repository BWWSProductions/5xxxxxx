This is Broken Toe Acro: the best SIV and acro explanation DVD out there. Made by O'Connor flight school, it covers all aspects of SIV and advanced acrobatics.

This video should by no means be used to train yourself - you can learn from it but you MUST ATTEND PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT COURSES BEFORE ATTEMPTING THESE MANEUVERS ON YOUR OWN!!!

Enleau and Ann O'Connor put a lot of hard work into making this DVD, so if you like it please BUY THE DVD at www.brokentoeacro.com . These people deserve it. The website of O'Connor flight school is at www.oconnorflightschool.com .

If you want to do some SIV maneuvers or Acro, this is a good way to get to know a lot about them. But it is by no means a substitute for real-life training: you can't do all maneuvers right just by watching this video. So always get professional training.


IT ACTUALLY INCLUDES A FULLY WORKING DVD MENU!

What I did was: I ripped all parts off the DVD then put them in a separate folder and renamed them so you can access them directly. I then included screenshots of the DVD menus, after that I created HTML files with a clickmap for each DVD menu. The whole thing is not directory sensitive so it should work wherever you place the file. This emulates a real DVD menu and works just as good!

>>> As far as I know, I'm the first one to emulate a DVD menu this way. If you like it, show your friends and ask other uploaders to do it too!

The quality is unsurpassed: 1600kb/s, two pass encoding, same audio as original dvd but bigger non-anamorphic resolution: 848*480. I can't tell the difference between this and the DVD, especially since the menu is included.

If you don't know how to play .mkv files, use GOMplayer: the best player around for any format you can imagine. Download it at www.gomlab.com .
