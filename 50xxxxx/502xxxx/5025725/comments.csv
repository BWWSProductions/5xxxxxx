,notenough,2009-07-27T11:41Z,"""The Storm"" is an epic miniseries event where the changeable forces of nature combine -- in the air, on land, in the seas -- as the world counts down its final, catastrophic hours. 

Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominee Treat Williams (""Everwood"") and James Van Der Beek (""Dawson's Creek"") star in this ultimate tale of man against nature. Also stars Teri Polo.

and
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4266586/10.5_Apocalypse.PDTV

Although the latter doesn't seem to have any seeders and I'm sure there must be a smaller version somewhere.

,zen-TAO,2009-07-28T04:20Z,any english subs yet?
,notenough,2009-07-28T08:50Z,"Annoying these local channels putting their severe weather warnings on to shows as they're playing. 

At least this time it was kind of appropriate as they show the people rejoicing at the rain."
,CABLE999,2009-07-28T14:21Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4266586/10.5_Apocalypse.PDTV

Got this but not english, anyone know of another version or any subs?  Sorry newbie to all this!!"
,zen-TAO,2009-08-01T03:06Z,"No english subs on
any of the usual sites.
Why is it taking so long?"
