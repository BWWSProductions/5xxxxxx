Ho-ho-ho....here is the new twisted mix for your pleasure ride to another dimention
If you have the old mixes u KNOW what this is all about!! ;) and if not!!! U donÂ´t understand.
The music in this mix is more va.than the old once(I think) so I hope some mixes and songs halp u to get more new artists to explore.
Because the songs are not exactly as they should be u must listen to those 2 to get an understanding!!
Please relax and focus on a long and wierd ride to many different places and time
