,Yurn2,2010-02-05T03:54Z,"708 and 380 are not divisible by 16. The first MAJOR mistake with this release. I would not download this as compression is wasted AND not everyone will not get the best playback of the file.

Besides that I think MIL or whoever has probably made many mistakes if he/she got a fundamental thing like resolution WRONG.
