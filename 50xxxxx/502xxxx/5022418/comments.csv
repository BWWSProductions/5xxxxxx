,roland69uk08,2010-06-29T22:11Z,wont work with windows 7
,hypnotoadtrance,2010-10-11T06:23Z,"Actually, this DOES work with Windows 7. All you have to do is find the installer and:

Right-click->Properties->Compatibility->Run this program in compatibility mode for:->Windows Vista (service pack 2)->Apply->Ok

Then simply install as usual, works just the same. You will need to do this same thing for the actual .exe after you install it."

,farooq.ksa,2011-11-12T16:01Z,"Don't Download it... It is Full of viruses just a 347 KB file, how it could be  Setup file.."
,Umpie,2012-06-13T09:40Z,"The program seems to be correct without virus, worm or trojan. But the included Keygen is blocked (and deleted) by many Antivirus programs. Thats is where you get the Virus warning from!
They block all program that seem capable of generating keys (like all keygen do!)
The included key-picture is already registered online as ""used to many"". So if you want to use that. Disable internet first. Else just terminate your virusscanner and run the keygen to get your own key, and the start your virusscanner again.

The program btw. I have not been able to get to listen to the streaming yet. Need to check the manuals.
but set seemed pretty simple... More news later....."
,Umpie,2012-06-13T10:07Z,"Can't get this version to work on Windows 7.
It does set up a webserver on port 88, that indeed does seem to provide streaming links. The manager does indicate that the software receives and audio signal that is should be streaming. When I connect a streaming client, it does indicate a good connection, but I just don't receive any streaming data.

I tried checking for updates, and I quickly get a message that my version does not work on Vista. So Thinking that I already have a license key generated it might work with the newer online version 1.21. NOT! 
The new version (1.21) does work, and I can connect with my phone and listen. 
But the generated key seems to be useless now and they completely changed their key-system. And once program has detected you can update to the newer version you can't install the old any more. 

They are to smart for me. But I am NOT going to pay $69 to be able to have a remote-headset (trough my wifi-phone)."
