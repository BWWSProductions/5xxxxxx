â€œSheâ€™s reached a clear career peak with the unconventional, focused and utterly charming Hummingbird Go!â€

â€œThese elements [traces of her jazz and blues-rock past] add splashes of unexpected color to these songs, bringing the extroversion of those styles to the too often introverted genre of indie pop and making Hummingbird, Go! sound too big for any kitchen to contain.â€
- PITCHFORK

â€œSwedish vocalist blends chockablock rhythms, fairy tale instrumentation and dreamlike melodies for music that recalls a spacier, sultrier Feist.â€
- ROLLING STONE

â€œSwedish transplant delights as a dextrous one woman bandâ€
- SPIN

â€œThis interplay of exceptional musicianship, sound, texture, and musical color are what make Hummingbird, Go! a truly extraordinary piece of work.â€
