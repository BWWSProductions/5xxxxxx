This is a chapter by chapter and verse by verse study of the book of Revelations as taught by Dr. Arnold Murray of the Shepherd's Chapel in 2007. His scholarly no nonsense / non-denominational approach brings forth the Word in such a manner that a child can understand.

If you don't have a King James Bible, the Scriptures are shown on-screen as he goes through them.

Information about him and the church can be had directly from their website:
