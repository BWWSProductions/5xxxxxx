This album is free!  Please share it with everyone you know!
We really want you to hear this music alot more than we want to 
make money off of it.  This is our little way of showing that we
support file sharing, especially because it empowers independent
musicians to get their music out there to anyone who wants to hear
it, even if they don't really want to shell out extra cash for it!

Please, take the time to visit our myspace or our website, drop us
a line, let us know that you're out there and that you're listening!
We are always recording new songs, and even though the quality isn't
as good as it could be, we're doing the best we can with what gear
we have for now.  So if you're annoyed with all the compression in the
songs, it really is because they sound alot better with the compression
because it's hiding alot of the little flaws :)

Thank you so much for listening and taking the time to download this!
Please visit us and let us know what you think!  You never know, we may
be able to come play a show for you in your town :)

Thanks again!

	-Jym Pagel (Lead Vocals, songwriter, piano, guitars, synthesizers)
