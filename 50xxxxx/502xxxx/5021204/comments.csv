,detunedharmony,2009-07-24T21:20Z,"Hey so I have to say I'm pretty impressed with this album, man.  Seriously.  It's a good quality recording with some really really great songs... I haven't made it very far into it, but I'm especially liking ""Swollen"" and ""On My Mind"" so far.  If those aren't radio hits waiting to happen, I don't know what is.  

There's a few minor mixing things but I'm actually a producer out on the East Coast so I just kinda pick up on that stuff...  For an amateur (i'm assuming) you have a really good ear for mixing though and wow I'm really liking these songs.  Keep it coming, hope to hear more songs!  

I'll add you on myspace and if you want some advice or at least a contact in the industry I'll give you my info.  I just don't know how to send a private message on here.


SEED and DOWNLOAD THIS ONE, PEOPLE!!!!!  I'm serious!  I was pleasantly surprised! "
