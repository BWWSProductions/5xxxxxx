[T],60Hertz,2009-07-29T18:12Z,"It isn't edited, and I'm fairly sure everyone can assume a cd isn't edited unless the description says so. I personally will never get an edited cd if I can help it.

Also, the Parental Advisory logo in the cover art might be a clue. =p"

[T],60Hertz,2010-06-03T13:30Z,"No prob, guys. They are fucking sick live no doubt! 

I'm gonna try uploading at least a torrent a week now that it's summer, especially since I know of a bunch of sweet albums that will be coming out soon. Comment one of my torrents if you have any requests! I have a ton of albums, and chances are I have it.

Of course, if you like the artist, you should buy their CD and support them (straight from the artist if possible, less chance of the labels ripping them off)! Anyway, happy torrenting"
