Review	by Thom Jurek

Simply put, Blow Up! A JTQ Collection is the most representative set of the 
band's work until Hammond-Ology (a double disc) a few years later. Released as a 
joint effort between Acid Jazz and Music Club, it is loaded with 17 burning cuts 
ranging from raw, woolly spy-groovers like "Mission Impossible" and "Theme from 
Dirty Harry" by Lalo Schifrin to the monstrous U.K. hit the band had with its 
instrumental meltdown reading of Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" to the funky, 
soulful groove jazz of tracks such as "3 Mile Island," "One Way Street," and "In 
the Hand of the Inevitable." The harder-driving funked-up jazz-rock (and that 
doesn't mean fusion) on "Europa" and "Check It Out" illustrate yet another side 
of the band's seemingly limitless forte at the time, just as slower tunes like a 
fine instrumental cover of Paul Simon's "Mrs. Robinson" and the gorgeous "Love 
Ballad" do their soulful side. If you can hunt this baby down, it'll be cheap, 
it sounds great, and it has decent liners. Well worth investigating, but be 
forewarned: you'll be digging for the original albums before long should you 
attempt a listen.

                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
