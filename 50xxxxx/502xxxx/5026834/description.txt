This is the version of Boot Camp which comes with the June 2009 MacBook Pro 15"

It has been ripped straight from the Leopard Install Disc and is completely untouched.

I haven't tested it on other machines, but I expect it should work with the latest crop of Apple portables (including the 13" MBP).
