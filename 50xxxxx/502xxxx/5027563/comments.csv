What are you on about?
Where is the logic in that. The more you upload(speed) the more your connection is throttled, the more you upload(amount) the better your ratio (the nicer you are in the community).

Also, you will compromised personal as well as other users by setting unlimited properties.

Sorry to be an ass, just letting you and others know."
,shredtheibanez,2009-07-28T16:33Z,** Compromise users of your connection (within your network)
,shredtheibanez,2009-07-28T16:34Z,But thanks for the upload anyway (1 UP)
,midgetbro09,2009-07-28T17:32Z,i totally love how you upload a torrent for a torrent downloader...
,J-M,2009-07-28T18:02Z,stupid shredtheibanez in p2p sharing if you upload to a peer and this peer upload to you his file you're download wil be faster cuz he is uploading to you you're download will be the sum of the speed of all peers uploading and vise versa . 
,shredtheibanez,2009-07-29T01:00Z,"You are dick. You didn't prove your point at all, all you proved is, if you upload more, the other guy gets a faster download, vice versa. Which if you look at my comment, I state that. 

However BELLEND, if I download this torrent, and upload full bandwidth, I will end up with a shit upload connection for other users in my network, and the SAME (if not slightly reduced (because of tunnelling (a concept I realise you don't understand) meaning more data is going to and from my hardware (LAN ports, cables ++) download speed as if I was to upload 1kb/sec.

On the other hand!

If I was to upload full bandwidth and SOMEONE else was to download the same torrent and have MY connection in there pool! THEY'D get a faster download, than if i was to upload at 1kb/sec, which would result in a maximum download speed FROM ME of 1kb/sec!

Before you start stating BULL SHIT in both your description and comments, Understand the fundamentals of bit torrent.

And by the way dick face, Bit torrent isn't an exclusive P2P, its a separate protocol BASED on the original P2P protocol, There are UNDERLINING variations!

LEARN NETWORKING PRINCIPLES BEFORE BEING A TOTAL CUNT!

Peace out PRICK!"
