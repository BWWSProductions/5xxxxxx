We world premiered our latest Project "Where The Streets Have No Name" this weekend on imeem.com, our music player got over 260,000 views in just 2 days. Featuring our production as the backdrop for street anthems from the likes of: Lil Wayne, Bun B, Young Buck, Talib Kweli, K'naan, & much more; the project is already being heralded as a classic. Now we are making the entire album available for free download. I would suggest that you download it, and then listen to it all the way through.
Along with the album comes 12 different album covers, as well as Blackberry & iPhone wallpaper for each of the separate covers. Shouts to imeem.com and illroots.com who worked with us extensively on the project.
