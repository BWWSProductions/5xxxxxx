,mikels12,2009-07-26T21:11Z,just in case u cant get it to work once installed go to where your program file are :C:\program files\daniel corp\nintendo ds emulator\ then click on the Nintendo ds application image and then just add you gba/nds roms games to it.cheers just thought i'd put this up as i took me couple of mins to figure it out but i might be a little new to this

,kambous,2009-07-28T15:57Z,dont press escape... u have to re-download....
,pipsqueak,2009-08-09T08:40Z,is there any way to make the screens bigger? and how do i make it run normal speed? cuz when i play pokemon when i talked to the rival sound sped up and it was kinda annoying. XD
,Tinindil,2009-10-09T15:30Z,"Pipsqueak, As no one else has replyed, not sure if you have the same problem with the speed of the emulator running fast, but i suffered the same thing

To Solve it, go into the settings, and adjust Emulation Speed LCD Refresh, from Realtime*2 Auto to just Realtime Auto.

As for making the screen larger, not found a way, if anyone else has, would be apreciated."
,sabredenton,2009-11-26T03:16Z,"to make the screen larger, right click on the emulator, and properties. in the compatibility setting, run at 640x480. bam, full screen"
,art-uur,2009-12-13T17:23Z,"i executed the file but no daniel corp folder appeared in program files

soo...any suggestions?"
,KING-3,2009-12-23T23:23Z,"i hope this emulator works as i tryed a few a wile back and they was so slow, so i just whent out and bought my self a ds with a r4 card, i will try this and post another comment on how good it is."
,pedrocks1312,2010-02-02T18:38Z,"Yeah, this emulator works perfect! Just some minor lag issues, but this is easily ignored... I was just wondering for the platinum... or i should say in general.. how do you turn on the Wi-Fi option? Seeing that the emulator doesn't even have a starter screen, is it even possible?"
,FrankWesker,2010-03-18T03:15Z,"okay, for some reason my saves keep making the emulator crash. Anyone else have this problem or know how I can solve it?"
,MRitalyy,2010-06-07T02:13Z,Can anyone help me with the saving? I cant figure out how to save. lol ill play and i cant save so it make me not want to play it if i cant save. and thanks in advance.
