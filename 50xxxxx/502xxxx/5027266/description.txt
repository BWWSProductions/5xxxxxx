http://www.casttv.com/video/vd3m591/fema-citizen-journalists-record-nle-2009-for-fairness-video

Alex talks with the controversial Harlem preacher, Rev. James David Manning of Atlah Worldwide, who declared at the National Press Club that Obama is not only "the most notorious criminal in the history not just of America, but of this entire planet." Earlier this month, the marquee on Manning's church accused Obama of faking his citizenship and explicitly challenged the president to prove that he was born in the United States, as required under the constitution. Attorney and former gubernatorial and senatorial candidate Philip Berg, who filed a lawsuit claiming Obama is constitutionally ineligible to be president, also makes an appearance. Alex also covers the latest news and takes your calls.
