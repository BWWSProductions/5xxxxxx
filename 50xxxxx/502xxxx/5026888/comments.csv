,omni1100,2009-08-07T03:59Z,you need to modify your host file to keep app from phoning home. this is what is explained in read me.
,willpowerpt,2009-08-08T08:30Z,"Can someone explain how to stop it calling home everytime? I cannot see this in the instructions ? Instructions call for this folder ""sudo pico / private / etc / hosts "" I cannot find this folder."
,mathfreak,2009-08-08T23:11Z,"I haven't downloaded it yet but modifying the hosts file to prevent calling home is basically this:

sudo nano /etc/hosts

In this file you'll see a few lines such as 

127.0.0.1 localhost
::1 localhost

These lines tell your computer to reroute all requests to localhost to 127.0.0.1 or ::1. You need to add a line that routes all requests to adobe.com to another address that isn't adobe.com. 

Keep in mind that hosts file operates under an exact match setting. In other words, adobe.com is not http://www.adobe.com nor is it https://www.adobe.com. It either matches exactly or it doesn't match at all. You need to include all cases that the program you want to block might try."
,findermix,2009-08-09T12:42Z,"Apreciados colegas:
Gracias al aporte de Josvila he instalado la suite, pero como la mayoría de usuarios de Mac hemos escogido este sistema por la sencillez de su funcionamiento y no queremos entrar en sus interioridades, he probado otra alternativa más sencilla que la que indicada y me ha funcionado perfectamente.
Simplemente una vez que el archivo ""ADBESTAMCS4_LS4.dmg"" que hemos descargado este en el escritorio le damos doble clik y que se abra en el escritorio, abrimos la carpeta y encontraremos un icono de ""SETUP"" le damos a este y se abrirá el instalador, (paciencia...)una vez abierto, aquí colocaremos el serial que está en la carpeta inicial del torrent bajado, tiene que empezar por 1325-....-....- lo insertamos y empezara la instalación. más paciencia.
CONSEJO: No es necesario instalar toda la suite ya que es muy ámplia y seguramente no necesitaremos todas las aplicaciones, podemos instalarlas más adelante.
MUY IMPORTANTE: Una vez este la carpeta bajada en el escritorio y antes de instalar nada, desconectarse de INTERNET, instalar las app que necesitemos, abrirlas, probarlas, y después de esto reiniciamos, ya podemos conectarnos a INTERNET.
No es necesario desinstalar las versiones anteriores, pero una vez comprobado que funcionan las nuevas se pueden desisntalar, más que todo por el espacio en disco y que al clicar un archivo se abra una u otra.
----------
-Instalar la aplicación que indica JOSVILA ""Littlesnitch"" no es necesaria, pero es muy buena para saber donde se conecta nuestra máquina. la bajamos de  Softonic  y le colocamos 32T9GDBAA0-715H5-P51UE6HGML listo
------------
Para desinstalar una aplicación lo mejor es utilizar AppCleaner, abrir la carpeta que contiene la appp tirar el icono sobre AppCleaner y después todo el resto a la papelera.
Se consigue free en http://www.macupdate.com

,findermix,2009-08-09T19:34Z,"Ampliación/aclaración del anterior post:
Siguiendo los pasos anteriores para instalar la suite, tengo que rectificar ya que ""si es necesario"" tener instalado Littlesnitch y que cuando se conecte a Adobe para actualizar o registrase  DENEGAR ""DENY"" así tendremos la aplicación disponible, ya que si clicamos ""ALLOW"" nos cerrara y bloqueará la aplicación.

También decir que con el procedimiento de Josvila se instala perfectamente y funciona de maravilla, no es tan complicado de hacer y nos ahorramos cada vez que abrimos las aplicaciones denegar la comunicación con Adobe."
,willpowerpt,2009-08-09T23:48Z,"ok that's my question Mathfreak.
Where is this folder ""sudo nano /etc/hosts"" on a mac?
I cannot find it "
,mathfreak,2009-08-10T00:55Z,"It's not a folder. hosts is a file located in the folder /etc

Just go into Terminal (it's located in the Utilities folder). Terminal is a black screen that looks like MSDOS in windows. If you don't see this screen then you are in the wrong place. 

Once you find this screen, type the command:

sudo nano /etc/hosts

This will ask for your account password. Enter it in and press enter. Please note that with UNIX, passwords aren't visible so it will seem like your computer has been frozen. Don't worry. Just enter it and press enter. This will open up your hosts file for editing.

If you're still having issues, please tell me your version of Mac OS X that you're running. You can find that out by clicking the Apple icon in your menu bar and then clicking ""About this Mac"".

Hope this helped."
,findermix,2009-08-10T01:05Z,"Don't exist this folder, 
Open app Terminal, (inside utilities), you can write exactly this words ""sudo nano /etc/hosts"" and key/Password of administrator/propietari of mac then paste the text 127.0.0. etc. etc..

,mudlark1,2009-10-12T23:30Z,"To anyone having the problem with ""Licensing for this product has expired"", the following worked for me. You must be logged in as the administrator on your mac. Also, obviously, you should only do it if you own and have paid for a legitimate copy of the product (clears throat)

OK! Install Adobe but don't launch it. (If you already have it installed, use AppZapper to completely delete it.) Now turn off your AirPort to stop the computer connecting to the internet.

Launch Terminal from Applications / Utilities. 

Type sudo pico /etc/hosts

You will be prompted to enter your password. Nothing will appear onscreen while you do, but enter it anyway and press enter.

A very lo-tech-looking text editor will flash up, with one or two entries beginning 127.0.0.1 in it. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the beginning of these entries. You need to get the following entries in there: use the TAB key to insert a linebreak.

127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate-sea.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate-sjc0.adobe.com

When you're done, press CTRL-X to exit. It will ask you if you want to save changes. Hit Y. You have now edited the hosts file to stop Adobe phoning home. Don't stop! There is more.

[Sidenote: the bit above becomes very much easier if you can be bothered to get hold of BBEdit, install its command-line tools and then open terminal and type bbedit /etc/hosts. Then copy/paste the list and save.]

NOW: to get rid of the ""Registration has expired"" thing, do the following:

Quit all Adobe programs and delete the following file:

/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe PCD/cache/cache.db

NB that this should be in the Library folder of your root directory, ie Mac HD, or whatever you've called your hard disk. There's another Library folder under your username under Users, but it doesn't have the Adobe PCD folder in so it isn't the one we want.

Now launch your Adobe app and enter one of the following serials. Make a note which one you used in case you want to install and activate any others. Don't connect to the net just yet.

1325-0321-2015-7091-9681-7717
1325-0181-3738-0615-5739-9898
1325-0084-0806-2185-0302-7354
1325-0112-3840-5467-8974-0282
1325-0248-9800-0187-7623-7106
1325-0412-0855-1375-6305-7806
1325-0581-1108-1105-1944-2760
1325-0213-2599-6032-5159-4780
1325-0882-6599-8787-6439-6137
1325-0261-4811-3496-3493-1549

A tick will appear beside it when you have it right. Hit continue. I don't know if it's safe to run the Updater that may appear, so I have avoided doing so. Quit Photoshop and restart to check everything is OK, then you should be able to reconnect to the net and breathe a sigh of relief. You're done.

Apologies if some of these steps are repeats or redundant. Thanks should go to the various sites all over the net that came up with the separate bits of this explanation: all I have done is put them together. Good luck!"

SWIM already has this release up and running, but has been nagged by the Adobe Updater.

So SWIM was wondering whether anyone here has concrete info on whether it is okay to let this release update, or whether it's gonna go berserk and lock up the license, as many releases do.

Also, SWIM has just yet downloaded a trial version of Lightroom and keygenned it.
If (See? SWIM needs YOUR opinion! :-P ) it's okay to update this release, is it then also okay to let Lightroom get updated?

SWIM hopes that this message was clear enough for everyone here to easily grasp and hopes to get some conclusive news from y'all soon! :-)

In case you know the answer to this dilemma, but don't want to discuss it here, feel free to contact SW on facebook[dot]com[slash]damoon.f

i've read through the various guides on the boards - but which steps to make this work? i can follow them but as i don't really have a great understanding of computers, i'm not sure what i'm doing...

i've got a 10.5.2 laptop...

-----

STEP 1

Change the Date to something like 18th December 2008

STEP 2

turn off airport to stop connecting to interrnet

STEP 3

Launch Terminal from Applications / Utilities. 

Type sudo pico /etc/hosts

OR: 

sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts

You will be prompted to enter your password. Nothing will appear onscreen while you do, but enter it anyway and press enter.

A very lo-tech-looking text editor will flash up, with one or two entries beginning 127.0.0.1 in it. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the beginning of these entries. You need to get the following entries in there: use the TAB key to insert a linebreak.

Here are the steps:

A. open the terminal.app
B. type ""sudo -s"" [without quotes]
C. if asked, type your root password and hit enter
D. type ""pico /etc/hosts"" [without quotes]
E. copy the list you find in the post of bsodmike (below) and past in your terminal (at the end of this hosts file)
F. ctrl+x to exit, y to save and enter to confirm the same name and modify your hosts file.

127.0.0.1 activate-sjc0.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 hl2rcv.adobe.com

When you're done, press CTRL-X to exit. It will ask you if you want to save changes. Hit Y. You have now edited the hosts file to stop Adobe phoning home

STEP 4

Test if it really blocked: on the Terminal, run ""ping activate.wip3.adobe.com"" it must show 127.0.0.1 instead of 192.150.14.69

STEP 5

run the following under Terminal: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache

(above is for leopard)

You can also do the same in Tiger with the following Terminal command:

lookupd -flushcache

STEP 6

Install CS4 MC in Trial mode: select trial mode at the Welcome screen

STEP 7

Use Little Snitch to block Adobe checking serial from obdev.at

STEP 8

Now launch your Adobe app and enter one of the following serials. Make a note which one you used in case you want to install and activate any others. Don't connect to the net just yet.

and save the file. Do NOT do a 'Save As'. Close the file.)

Now install CS4

5. Run any application from the MC CS4. Choose trial, let it connect to the internet !!!!!! Close the app.

6. Open Terminal (found in Applications/Utilities/). In the terminal window, paste in:

sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts

Hit return and type in your admin password.

A file will automatically open in TextEdit. In TextEdit, at the bottom of the document, hit return and paste in the following:

127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com

127.0.0.1 activate-sjc0.adobe.com

Save the file. Do NOT do a 'Save As'. Close the file.

!!!! This is not a mistake in step 4 you were supposed to undo these changes if you had edited the file before and had CS4 that suddenly stopped working.

7. In a new terminal window, paste in:

sudo dscacheutil -flushcache

Hit return and type in your admin password [if asked again].

8. Launch any CS4 app and enter the serial:

1325-0505-2949-5043-2724-3432

OTHER STEPS SUGGESTED

setting the clock back off it is says it has expired

using appzapper

to clean:

CS4: http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cs4clean.html


AND THIS:

open a terminal, and become super user ( namely root) using the command 
""sudo -s"" (without quotes) and when it asks, give your password. and delete the file 
""cd /Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/Adobe\ PCD/cache/cache.db"" using the command ""rm"" ex. 
""rm cd /Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/Adobe\ PCD/cache/cache.db""
when you reopen any adobe mc app. it will ask you a serial, and you know the rest of the story.  good luck.

sorry, I forgot to rm ""cd"" command in front of the path to the file. The file is
/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/Adobe\ PCD/cache/cache.db
