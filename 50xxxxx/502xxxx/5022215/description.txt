This is V. E Howard's informative booklet The White House - American or Roman (1960) which was mass mailed throughout America when Roman Catholic JFK was running for presidential office and included arguments against anyone Catholic ever taking the White house. Should a Roman Catholic be the head of the government of the United States when the Roman hierarchy has always been opposed to many of our American freedoms? What about a Catholic President? The complacency and misapplied spirit of "tolerance," on the part of many American citizens, has almost become a virtue. All one need do is read history to ascertain the fact that Roman Catholicism is not exclusively religious, but has always been political in her aims and actions, sometimes more political than religious. 30 pages, few pictures. A must read for everyone.
