,bingora,2010-04-11T13:43Z,SOUND IS NOT IN ENGLISH. AND THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION TO SELECT ENGLISH AUDIO TRACK. I WASTED MY 24.57GB.

If you want to convert it to bluray format and have the english subtitles working with the film use TS Remuxer to convert it to bluray file structure, the PGS file there is in English (this is the subtitles).  The just use BD Rebuilder to shrink it a little so you can fit it to a 25GB bluray disc and burn it using ImageBurn.

There you go!

Thanks uploader"

,Lorax98,2012-04-07T21:40Z,This movie does not come in English. You have to read the sub-titles. That was part of the point.
,Lorax98,2012-04-07T21:41Z,"If you want Blu-Ray quality, download the version on this tracker that is half of the size. this version is way-way-way too big."
