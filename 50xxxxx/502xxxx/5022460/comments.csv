,tycoonfan,2009-07-29T13:00Z,can you explain how it work with a Iso image??
,Lambolou,2009-07-29T19:20Z,You can make a virtual image useing Daemon Tools
,rock500,2009-08-05T18:18Z,"@ tycoonfan
a ISO is a image file, u can either burn it to a blank disk and install it from there or mount it with a program(Ex. Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120%)"
,xiIix,2009-09-10T11:00Z,"Luke, I've been using Daemon tools for years and years, and I've never once had a single issue with it, so I don't know what you're on about. I've tried all the other bloated shit out there and I can't stand it. DT is small, clean and simple."
,alephisto,2009-10-08T12:25Z,"listen ive been using daemon tools for almost 2 years have never had a problem, on the other hand with alcohol 120% i had all kinds of problems like ""register or you wont be able to use these features"" and ""pay $xx.xx and get these features"" daemon tools is free supported and perfect, also if u dont want to run from a mounted image there is always the program isobuster and it is bad ass for certain games"
,greendaygal540,2009-11-24T18:11Z,"THIS ISNT AN ISO!!! its a bunch of .r00 files or w/e, theres not an iso 2 b seen!"
,greendaygal540,2009-11-24T18:17Z,"SRY! total n00b, lol. i use PowerISO to use w/ my ISOs n stuff"
,abdullibaloch,2009-12-04T16:01Z,gayz use ultra iso
,badtrooper13,2009-12-21T03:50Z,all you have to do is like xxx.001 change one zero to and r like xxx.r01 then you do that for all of them then double click on the first one then extract and there u have ur iso
,Mavese,2010-01-12T01:33Z,If you don't know how it works why the fuck are you here?
,peety001,2010-01-30T10:05Z,Seems to be a lot of people born super smart??? Others need to learn things. Those of you born super smart should be smart enough to allow others the time to learn.  That's if you aren''t so smart that you may not know this???
,sjatis,2010-02-26T13:50Z,"help me! when i open Hunting Unlimited 2010 it always show me widow break for games, then i can do nothing! how to run this game?!"
,jaymoney,2010-04-18T18:53Z,"well id have to agree that if you dont really know what you are doing, then you probably shouldnt use piratebay as there are alot of viruses and diffuicult tasks (for beginners that is) just to get the shit to work."
,hydra679,2010-05-04T12:13Z,is this thing cracked?
,Alaska103,2010-05-04T14:43Z,"Never had issues with Daemon Tools, if you had, you just lack the brains...and I'm telling you, you don't need brains to make Daemon Tools work xD"
,TheGrimSleepa,2010-05-11T07:01Z,"can someone give step by step instructions on how to install it because i dont no how to make an .iso image and such!?!
please help!!!"
,ioannisarc,2010-06-18T19:41Z,"I downloaded the game. It works fine and its good but when I close it, when I want to open a windows dossier instead of one they open 5-10 dossiers and when I want to click on a file instead of one file they open 4 or more.
After a reboot everything is ok but after playing the game the problem it represents again so I uninstalled it.
Sorry because it was a good game."
,uploader1337,2010-07-29T09:20Z,"I installed it, but whenever I click play button there comes up an errorbox saying: Corrupted Installation. Reinstall application from original CD.

Please help :)"
,Szabotage,2010-09-25T16:52Z,"@ All you People

Power ISO is the Best IMHO. 
 Daemon tools was cool back in the day, like 98/XP days.....seriously, get with the times. I never had good luck running DT or A120%. Stupid fucking errors or straight up BSOD's"
,Keithuk,2010-12-05T22:29Z,It works perfecly WinXP SP3.
,Eleggu,2011-01-09T15:50Z,Thanks! It works :D
,jamesblue67,2011-01-22T22:00Z,"I suggest you folks who need help to understand how run these files..dont ask these retards here..
because they dont know..and pretend to know
They want attention from you and want others to think they know something.. They learned  from some video or someone held their hand..now they forget how and wont tell you. DONT waste your time on these airheads"
,jamesblue67,2011-01-22T22:09Z,"People don't listen to the ones who think they KNOW how its done.. they just want attention !
better to google or go on forums to find out ..
More attention ya give them the more they feel 
important.
 But what i want to know is why the poster of this file Didn't leave  good instructions !"

,Rikomag,2011-03-03T19:21Z,"Did not work for me.. All there is is a bunch of Rar files containing corrupt data, and no ISO file..."
,Psukki,2011-03-13T20:34Z,"Somebody help

In every map the ground looks black and bushes just appear out of nowhere, how can i get the ground look like sand, snow and grass like it should be"
,cundalinimadmax,2011-04-02T06:13Z,Thanks for the fast upload. Good game.
,DALAJS,2011-06-28T09:22Z,"Bearing in mind that what works for one PC might not work for another:

1. Look for the file ""gow-hu10"". Unrar with appropriate software.

2. Once you have unrared this file, there should be a new folder. In this folder will be two files. ""gow-10.bin"" and ""gow-10.cue"".

3. You will need to mount ""gow-10.bin"" (the larger of the two) with your favourite mounting software. 

4. Once you have done this, you need to explore your new image and click ""setup"". 

5. Follow the normal installation prompts and you are good to go.

Hope it works for you!"
,Rebalosho,2011-07-06T08:22Z,"Thanks DALAJS ,it worked..."

,nuyari,2011-09-04T12:32Z,thanks
,angga321,2011-09-16T10:54Z,"if you're having trouble extract the file you might interesting to use winrar. just klik all rar files while you leave one file un block. then right click choose add to archive. then browse to one file you're not block before, and start it compression. after it done re-extract all that file. now hope it would help......hehehehe !?"
,angga321,2011-09-16T12:30Z,"ehm sorry i think my advice doidn't work at all, but now i have figure it out how to fix it !? just extract the rar file, then after you ectract it you will find .cue and .bin.

after that use cd-rom virtual such as magiciso to maount it !? choose on of the file you have extract. once you mount it, it will directly proceed to install to your computer...this one is work, i've tried it !? need any help or have another idea, share with me guys,
