,xDieHardx,2009-08-02T19:03Z,"I'll let you know if it is real after I download it, got about 20 minutes left on the Download."
,xDieHardx,2009-08-02T19:29Z,"Yes, it works properly."
,DarkTunes,2009-12-06T12:22Z,"It says i have to install it on a CD, but the reason i'm downloading this is because my DVD player on the computer doesn't work!"
,felpz123,2009-12-25T05:01Z,"don't know what you guys are talking about mounting, this torrent has no cd, just an .exe

the crack DOES NOT work. there is no need for one, and if you do install it, then you will not be able to load games.

simply update it to the latest patch and enjoy"

If anyone has ideas please share."
,Cobes26,2010-03-09T00:37Z,"@SonixAurora, did you try changing to 32 bit instead of 64 bit or whatever it is? I believe changing to 32 bit will make the game have more colours to it and perform better."

Do NOT use the crack, you will not be able to load saved games. Mount it in your mounting software everytime you want to play."
,Sgt.Flea,2010-10-12T17:48Z,"Great Download! Very fast aswell, took me about 7 minutes to get it downloaded, and only a few minutes to install and get started... Don't use Crack, install deamontools and mount the ISO for playing."
,SLS1992,2010-10-13T01:05Z,"yeah this torrent works fine for Xp, not so good for vista or 7, brilliant up tho thnx logkii"

,LiveInABox,2010-12-03T04:33Z,"whats this ""HSBR.exe is a threat"" thing MSE picks up? virus?"
,devlin679,2011-03-19T05:44Z,"1 mb/s? damn thanks for fast dl speeds, ill get back on if it works"
,Arrgh420,2011-04-23T08:16Z,"Downloaded great!  It runs okay on Vista.  I didn't use the crack, just ran the ISO with Daemon Tools.  As long as you don't have any other applications running in the background, it should be okay.  It also seems that I have to make a new save file for each save.  Not a big deal though..."
,KlasKlettermus,2011-07-24T22:51Z,Crack wasn't needed?
,killmehell,2011-07-28T20:47Z,im trying to do what you say but it keeps popping up with this box were u gotta type the numbers from the cd
,chelsea93,2011-07-30T07:09Z,"i downloaded it, and installed it.
then i get to the menu, and try to click on a new game, but it just keeps flicking straight back to the menu.

,stonecoldtrck,2012-01-12T21:34Z,"wow ty, i own this but who knows where i put the cd its been so long lol, kinda got an itch to build me a park tho"
,Fireskrit,2012-04-22T04:19Z,"Seriously guys, if you keep getting the CD code error, just google ""Rollercoaster Tycoon Serial Code"" or go to www.gamecopyworld.com and find a crack there.
Not that hard, just sayin'."
