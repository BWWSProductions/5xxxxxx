Judas Priest are an English heavy metal band from Birmingham, formed in 1969. Judas Priest's core line-up consists of bass player Ian Hill, vocalist Rob Halford and guitarists Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing; their current drummer is Scott Travis. They have been cited as an influence on many heavy metal musicians and bands. Their popularity and status as one of the definitive heavy metal bands has earned them the nickname "Metal Gods" from their song of the same name. They have sold over 35 million albums worldwide.

Nostradamus is a concept album and the band's 16th studio album to date., focusing on the 16th century prophet Nostradamus. The band's first concept album.

"This is a record thatâ€™s full emotional outbursts, soundtrack worthy pieces and music imagery. It is so hard to judge record like this. My biggest complaints are production and the theme of the album. Taking into account that this is one of my favorite bands of all time, some clever arrangements, couple of really good Goth ballads, and sheer dedication of the band to the project , I will give it a strong 4 stars. This could be truly a masterpiece if production was better and if they tackled more serious theme. Having said all that, I will bet my right arm that this record will sound phenomenal performed live  which Priest is planing for next year.
The faves include: â€œPestilence and Plagueâ€, â€œPersecutionâ€ â€œAloneâ€, â€œNew Beginningsâ€ and title track."
