The Beginning Of The End - Funky Nassau
label: Rhino Records | HQ MP3 CBR | 320kbps |
Genre: Soul, Funky Soul

One of the very few soul groups from Nassau, the Beginning of the End had one hit in 1971, the scintillating "Funky Nassau." They recorded an album of the same name that year, then dropped out of sight. This CD (a reissue from Rhino Records) shows that this group had a lot more to offer than the one hit that characterized them. But I guess we shall never know. Get real funky with this one!
