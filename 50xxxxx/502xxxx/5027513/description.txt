"Hush" is a song by Tool from their 1992 EP Opiate. The song was first recorded on a self-titled demo tape variously known as Toolshed and 72826, recorded in mid-1991. It was the first song that helped establish the band's reputation.

The lyrics protest censorship, which is a recurring theme in Tool songs.

The music video for "Hush" was Tool's first ever music video. The video is shown in black-and-white-style, the band members appear nude in a white room, with tape over their mouths and signs shown over their genitalia that read "Parental Advisory: Explicit Parts", a parody of the "Parental Advisory: Explicit Content" sticker.

The Canadian music channel MuchMusic played it regularly, but it received little airtime elsewhere.

The concept was entirely provided by vocalist Maynard James Keenan. It is the only Tool music video other than "Sober" in which the band members appear, and the only one in which they appear in a prominent fashion. There is a misconception that Ken Andrews was the director, but this is not the case.

The music video was released in 2000 as a bonus on the DVD, but not the VHS, of the Salival box set.
