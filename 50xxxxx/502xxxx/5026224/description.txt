A woman (Cindy Pena) arms herself with an arsenal of lethal weapons and heads into the woods to take revenge against four masked hunters who beat her boyfriend (Michael Walker) to a bloody pulp and subjected her to a brutal sexual assault.

Marginally superior 3-D offering from the same stable as CAMP BLOOD (1999) and its embarrassing ilk, featuring a spirited performance by Amazonian beauty Pena as the vengeful, leather-clad harpy seeking revenge on four irredeemable slimeballs, leading to a genuine twist in the tale. Jeff Leroy's direction is lively and competent (including a fair number of off-the-screen 3-D effects), but the rock-bottom production values and unflattering camcorder photography conspire against any and all good intentions. 



THIS IS FILMED IN TRUE STEREOSCOPIC 3D
Unfortenately this is not the full dvd quality, it is a bit blocky.

Can be viewed with Shutterglasses, NVidia Stereo3D Vision, Zalman and IZ3D Monitors and in Anaglyph using Stereoscopic Player
