I figured a lot of people in schools have very few resources when it comes to finding sheet music to work on when learning percussion.  I have uploaded this torrent to help solve this problem, and have included some pieces that can be good to work on (The Mitchell Peters ones are great for beginners).  If you like these sheets, please be sure to purchase them to support the composers (www.steveweissmusic.com)!  All files are PDF.


This torrent includes:

Chant For Marimba - Mitchell Peters
Sea Refractions - Mitchell Peters
Yellow After the Rain - Mitchell Peters
Zen Wanderer - Mitchell Peters
Frogs - Keiko Abe
Amorada - Waldyr Azevedo
Nocturne - Reed Maxson
Rhythm Song - Paul Smadbeck
Etude 1955 - Earl Hatch
Four Rotations - Eric Sammut (just the first 2 movements)
Whispering Woods - William J. Schinstine

Two for Two - Domenico Giannetta (for marimba and vibraphone or vibraphone duet)
Clair de Lune - Claude Debussy arr. Pete Chambers



The best way you can thank me for these is to upload your own percussion sheets.	 There's still a ton of stuff that isn't on here, such as much of Keiko Abe's material, all of Ney Rosauro's work, and Musser's etudes.
