,Morno,2009-07-29T21:16Z,so i can turn my Acer Aspire 6920 into a server? 
[V],harry711,2009-07-29T21:57Z,"Yes. You can turn pretty much any computer into ""a server"". This ISO is titled Server Edition because it is best optimized for use as a server. But, you could easily run a server on the Ubuntu Desktop edition.

tl;dr: yes, you can turn your computer into a server, as long as you read the proper guides on how to set it up."
