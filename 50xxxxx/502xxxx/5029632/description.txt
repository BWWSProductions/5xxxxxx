Recorded live at Toronto's El Mocambo rock club, this concert captures the late blues-guitar legend Stevie Ray Vaughan in his prime. Four of the songs featured were never released during his lifetime, and the other eight were band favorites from the early days. Included are "Testify," "Texas Flood," "Wham!" and covers of Jimi Hendrix's "Voodoo Chile" and "Third Stone from the Sun," plus a 1999 interview with some of Vaughan's band mates.
