Broken Hearts on Ice - "Ruination" (2009) [FLAC] [cxcr6-008]

Ruination is the latest single from upcoming computer musician, sound artist, and audio programmer, Broken Hearts on Ice (aka Andrew Grathwohl). Running just under 13 minutes, Ruination is a nervous, dark voyage through the yearning psyche of the composer, scored for violin, two cellos, and computer. Grathwohl's precisely-crafted atmospheres and psychedelically inspired string scores create a miraculously tense and suspenseful listening experience, which are sure to compliment the tastes of those who enjoy the works of Tim Hecker and Fennesz.
