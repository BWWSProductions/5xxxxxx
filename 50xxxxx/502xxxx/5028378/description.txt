Here's the video of Linkin Park & Jay Z performing 99 Problems/One Step Closer, filmed at the Roxy in 2004. Personally...I think this is the best track from the DVD so I'm making it available here as a solo.

I have also included a mp3 of the audio track. The live version of this tune is way better than what was put together in the studio. The studio version seems very underpowered and sterile.  I pulled this track directly from the DVD..and retouched the EQ and gain to preserve that "Live" feel.  Sounds great through an Ipod or a killer home stereo system.
