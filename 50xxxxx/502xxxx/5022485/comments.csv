Windows 7 Professional 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1.
AMD Athlon(tm) II X4 645 Processor (4 CPUs), ~3.1GHz
AMD Radeon HD 6670?
Anyone to verify?"
,jimmyjamjam,2012-03-20T09:47Z,"The game isn't very well optimised, the bloom, AA and shadows are the worst, i recommend you disable them if you're experiencing lags.

Thx for this game Extremezone !"
