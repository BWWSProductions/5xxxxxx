Various Artists - Funky Funky New York - Rare and unreissued NY funk 1969-1976
EAC FLAC | CUE and LOG Included | CD Rip | Funk | Artwork | 2006

This latest installment of the outstanding Funky Delicacies series focuses on the offerings of the funk community from the Big Apple. Unquestionably one of the largest metropolises in the world in the '60s and '70s, it could be argued it was nowhere near the hotbed of funk that other communities were experiencing during that time. Many of the artists found on here landed in New York by way of other cities, especially New Orleans. The story of Funky Funky New York's tracks lies largely on the story of two camps: the Pazant Brothers and Roy Hammond. The majority of the tracks here are productions from one group or the other, with a strong emphasis on the Pazants' Beaufort Express group. And while there isn't really anything that could compare to the raw energy found on obscure 45s from Louisiana, Memphis, or Detroit, Funky Funky New York is a nice workout that will be of interest to the most dedicated of beat junkies.
