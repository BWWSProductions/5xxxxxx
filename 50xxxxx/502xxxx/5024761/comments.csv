this file is seeded. It is taking a long time to upload as I have an upload cap by my service provider. The only game in town, you see. I am planning on setting up a seedbox. Anyway, seeing as you complained on one of my other uploads as well,
maybe you should do something useful, like find the people downloading this with leech-only clients, and adding them to blocklists, because I have already uploaded 6GiB, and eveyone is only at 37%. Or you could set your client to not download for a while, and just seed. "
