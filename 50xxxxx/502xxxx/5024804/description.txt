LYRICS:
Roots natty roots,
dread Binghi dread.
I and I are the roots.

Some are leaf (shoo-be-doo),
Some are branches (shoo-be-doo),
I and I are the roots.
Some are dry wood (shoo-be-doo)
for the fire (shoo-be-doo),
wo yo, look at that.
They need-a dry wood (shoo-be-doo)
to cook their raw food (shoo-be-doo),
wo yo, look at that.

Got to survive
In this man maniac downpression.
Got to survive
in iration.

Me say: Roots natty roots,
dread Binghi dread,
I and I are the roots.

Some are wolf (shoo-be-doo)
in sheep clothing (shoo-be-doo),
wo yo, look at that.
Many are called (shoo-be-doo),
a few are chosen (shoo-be-doo),
wo yo, look at that.
Nothing they can do (shoo-be-doo)
to seperate I'n'I (shoo-be-doo)
from the love of our father.
You see, blood is thicker than water,
wo yo, look at that.

Got to survive
in the ghetto.
Got to survive,
people don't fret, no!

We got the Roots Natty roots,
dread Binghi dread,
I and I are the roots.
Roots natty!
Dread Binghi!
I and I are the roots.
Roots natty roots,
dread Binghi dread,
I and I are the roots.
