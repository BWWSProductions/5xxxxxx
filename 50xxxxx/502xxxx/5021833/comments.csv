,kumochan,2009-07-27T12:56Z,Many thanks for all the work you've put into uploading. Sorry you're upset that hardly anyone has donated yet. Maybe they are cautious types like me and were waiting for the end of the basho before paying up. I hope so. I've already donated a bit to thank Shikigami_SuMO as it looks like he's done as much as he can for this basho. I'd be really grateful if you would put the last two days up. 
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-07-27T13:52Z,"i may post day 14 & 15 after all my group who i share with has the files first. for now, those who want to see the rest can see the matches only here:

,Rtlbones,2009-07-27T19:34Z,"FYI : The current day on banzuke.com is day 11... so you still won't see the last two days of matches. 

And, as an aside TV-Japan has limited availability if you aren't part of the Dish Network...

Thus why *I* at least appreciate those who have been posting the Basho videos. If we need to donate to get them in a timely and reliable fashion, how about letting us in on where to find out about donating."
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-08-03T02:37Z,if you look again they have all 15 days up. it just takes them a while
,kollijonker,2009-10-05T01:10Z,"Havent seen any of the september basho. Luckily in the sasuke torrent there was a news break at 1 hour 35 minutes and they showed the last two matches. Minutely better then seeing no sumo at all. Well there is always hope, maybe next basho... And no, live feeds arent an option when one has to work for a living. Thou chances are by no fault of mine i wont have a job by next basho. Then iÂ´ll look into those live feeds. But i beseech you please upload the september basho if you have it. Thank you."
