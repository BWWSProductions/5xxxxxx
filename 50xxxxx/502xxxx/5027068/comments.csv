,toyapower,2009-08-22T03:04Z,"SciFi-Sumo, check this out: 
http://www.tvjapan.net/pro_list/?date=2009-08-29&area=14
The 25th Wanpaku Sumo Tournament, Aug 29th at 02:50. Could you grab it and post it? 
Greetings. "
,wind_cloud,2009-09-13T07:57Z,"Shikigami has announced he will discontinue posting sumo. Is anyone willing to upload? There is an HD broadcast in Japan, maybe it will be posted on D-Addicts."
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-09-14T14:36Z,"If anyone wants to see the sumo free use this:



A great resource to watch online
sumo translations on NHK G channel (with more qualitative picture
than
at sumo.goo.ne.jp).
Just download free p2p-player TVAnts:
http://tvants.en.softonic.com/
run it, search NHK G channel there, and watch live 16:9 translation
with japanese comments.

If someone wants to then use software like:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4665054/WM_Recorder_12.4

to record the feed and then post it here - you can be the new sumo poster!

Enjoy!"
,wind_cloud,2009-09-14T17:28Z,How do I use WM Recorder with TVAnts?
,wind_cloud,2009-09-15T01:21Z,"Right click video, select properities, copy the address, paste it into WM Recorder"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-09-15T01:42Z,"I think the REZ is not too bad. If you are up at 4:PM JAP time, that is 9:AM EURO time, or 3:AM EST, then grab and post here!
"
,wind_cloud,2009-09-15T02:53Z,WM Recorder has a scheduler with a timer. I also downloaded an automatic shutdown gadget for Vista.
,wind_cloud,2009-09-17T02:59Z,Only 2-3 JTV channels are available as of 09/15
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-09-17T13:55Z,Dang. I think you should ask for your money back!
,wind_cloud,2009-09-17T17:41Z,I meant it looks like an unreliable source to get everyday of sumo.
,SUMODRAX,2009-09-17T19:30Z,I agre with wind_cloud! Why sudently the stop to broadcast the JAPAN NHK G channel now hmmm? And now we can only se sumo in (sumo.goo) And with the small bitrate  huuhhh  hmm. It is very irritating this al...hope some one soon can posting (The 2009 September Grand Sumo Turnament) days here or so ! Thanx al for who try to help up with things and so here  THANX  ;-))
,wind_cloud,2009-09-18T06:42Z,YT has a couple of users uploading videos. 
,wind_cloud,2009-09-18T06:43Z,UTube
,kollijonker,2009-10-05T01:13Z,"Havent seen any of the september basho. Luckily in the sasuke torrent there was a news break at 1 hour 35 minutes and they showed the last two matches. Minutely better then seeing no sumo at all. Well there is always hope, maybe next basho... And no, live feeds arent an option when one has to work for a living. Thou chances are by no fault of mine i wont have a job by next basho. Then i´ll look into those live feeds. But i beseech you please upload the september basho if you have it. Thank you."
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-10-05T05:08Z,"i did post each day for our pvt group - for those who have supported me all the way. sorry, will not risk open posts anymore!"
,Little_rU,2009-10-05T14:51Z,"SciFi-Sumo,

"
,nalleg,2009-10-13T23:24Z,Hej. Finns det möjlighet att ta del av din sumo? Går inte att hitta något längre i sverige nu när ingen delar ut här.
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-10-14T14:20Z,Ja. Titta upp i titel rutan så  jag kommer att sätta upp min email för dig. Det kommer inte stanna länge så se till att kollar snabbt. Tack
,nalleg,2009-10-14T14:28Z,Tack!
,he-hulk,2009-11-13T03:54Z,Sci fi how can i go about donating to get your files again i used to get them in 08 but havent downloaded any for along time and would like to start getting them again.
,cotola,2009-11-18T22:36Z,"Ciao, I'm from Italy. No way to watch sumo here. I've sorrowfully lost september basho and now I'm losing november basho too. Do I have any chance to take part of your group? Please contact me at scotola et gmail dot com.
Anyway a big tack to you and to Shikigami for what you did 'till now."
