On one hand, you have a rare and brilliant book that ought to receive wide torrenting, but it won?t because the uploader has used a bad label, a bad format  - m4a ? and provided no detail or tags. The uploader lacks a trusted skull, so nobody even takes a chance on THAT basis.

Okay, Across Five Aprils is a famous CLASSIC 1964 Newbery and Follet award winning novel covering the US Civil War. It is similar in tone or layout to RED BADGE OF COURAGE or WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS. Even today, it is very commonly an assigned book in 8th grade history or English classes. It is a gripping and marvelous story, well designed to enthrall and teach readers of any age. Home school families in particular should consider using this. I teach secondary history in the US public schools, and have often assigned this book. Additionally, I see that this uploader has at this time one other torrent, which is also a classic. I hope that this uploader will continue to post audio versions of quality juvenile literature.

Across Five Aprils is a novel by Irene Hunt, set in the Civil War era. Jethro Creighton, the main character, was Irene Hunt's real grandfather. He told her the stories, and she wrote them down to be Across Five Aprils.

In the beginning of the story, Jethro Creighton lives on an Illinois farm just before the Civil War. He has always been a hard worker, and he is busily tending his family's farm. However, when his schoolmaster and good friend, Shadrach Yale, returns from town with the news that the war has officially begun, Jethro?s world is turned upside-down.

Jethro has three brothers (Bill,John and Tom Creighton) and his cousin Eb, most of them eager to join the fight. But Jethro must struggle with the split between them, as three go to the Union Army and one (Bill) goes to the Confederacy. Later on, Jethro's good friend Shad and brother John also join the Union. John's wife Nancy and their two young sons live with the Creightons during the war. Jethro also has a sister named Jenny. She is in love with Shad, but her father will not approve of marriage for he thinks she is too young.

As the war heats up, so do the tensions among the townspeople living near Jethro. A gang of rowdy men led by Guy Wortman are angered by the fact that one of Jethro?s brothers joined the Rebel cause. Eventually, Jethro's father suffers from a heart attack, leaving Jethro as the man in charge of the household. Thus, the narrative spotlights the hardships of the war, interlaced with its effects on Jethro's family.
One day Jethro travels to town, and overhears the men talking about how traitorous his brother is. Though Jethro is frightened by the men, he thinks nothing of it. While Jethro is riding back, however, he is warned that the men are up to no good. A man (Dave Burdow), whose son (Travis) had been involved in Jethro's sister Mary's murder prior to the events of the story, ends up saving Jethro's life and driving the troublemakers off. However, the trouble is far from over.

After a few months, the men are at it again. They sabotage the family?s property by burning down the farmhouse and then contaminating the water in the well with oil. Jethro is given little time to concentrate on this when he finds out that his cousin Eb is a deserter from the Union Army. He now must face the hard decision of whether or not he should help his cousin. He begins communicating with President Lincoln and begins to look up to him as a leader during the crisis. However, by the end of the war, just when his family is reunited safely, Jethro learns that the president has been shot. It is in these turbulent times that Jethro has grown from an innocent boy to an intelligent man.
