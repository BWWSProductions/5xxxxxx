Publisher: Elsevier Science | ISBN: 0444532196 | edition 2008 | PDF | 624 pages

Research on the biochemistry and molecular biology of lipids and lipoproteins has experienced remarkable growth in the last 20 years, particularly with the realization that many different classes of lipids play fundamental roles in diseases such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The 5th edition of this book has been written with two major objectives. The first objective is to provide students and teachers with an advanced up-to-date textbook covering the major areas of current interest in the lipid field. The chapters are written for students and researchers familiar with the general concepts of lipid metabolism but who wish to expand their knowledge in this area.The second objective is to provide a reference text for scientists who are about to enter the field of lipids, lipoproteins and membranes and who wish to learn more about this area of research. All of the chapters have been extensively updated since the 4th edition appeared in 2002.
