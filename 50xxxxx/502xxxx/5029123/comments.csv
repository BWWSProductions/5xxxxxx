,tankdog03,2009-07-31T03:30Z,"this movie is really old, i just watch the sample, and i deleted the download it sux so bad"
,frkonleash787,2009-08-01T03:38Z,ok i read alot about Hart D. Fisher before i watched this flick. I was highly disappointed in it. the most hated man in america probably cause his movies are trash thiso ne didnt have much of anything to consider it banned or even look at. old movie yes he probably had to dope the people who put it out so he could actually get it out. stear clear and DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE. if you like gore and violence not them ive for you.
