I downloaded these 3 episodes of NASA X-Files from here: http://sxg.in/board/showthread.php/nasa-x-files-season-01-a-40281.html . Thought I'd save you the hassle because these series have some great interviews and are way cool for any aviation buff (like me).

It's made by Vision films and there are two more episodes (http://visionfilms.net/catalog/documentaries/military_technology/nasa_x_files.php), but I couldn't find them anywhere. If you have those episodes, please tell!
