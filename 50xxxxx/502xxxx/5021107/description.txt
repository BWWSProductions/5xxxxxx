Oregon - Northwest Passage
Year: 1996
Label: Intuition (1997)
Total time: 56:46
Bitrate: 320 kbps

Oregon's first recording in a while features the three surviving original members (Ralph Towner on guitar and keyboards, bassist Glen Moore, and Paul McCandless, who switches between soprano, English horn, sopranino, oboe and bass clarinet) with either Arto Tuncboyaciyan or Mark Walker on percussion.  They perform 14 originals that usually avoid blue notes, making the music sound very folk-oriented.  There is plenty of variety in the atmospheres, and the consistently intriguing music should appeal to many listeners, including those who are into mood music, world music or folk songs in addition to jazz.  ~ Scott Yanow, AMG
