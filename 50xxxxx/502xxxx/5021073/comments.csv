,Shadiac,2009-07-25T05:10Z,"ummm ok a couple of questions:

1) Wtf does ""untouched"" mean? And how should that matter?

3) What abt cracks? Is this gonna be the same crap all over again as with Vista, or did some haxxor fuck it up goody already?

,mattchazz,2009-07-25T08:48Z,"shuknopata:
""Yeah why it is untouched?""

=================

it's untouched so you know there are no rootkits, malware, trojans lurking.  Straight from Microsoft.  Many people wouldn't download some of the beta and RC releases because a few were not the ""official"" ISOs -- they were slapped together with files from earlier releases.  And since there were no hashes to go by, some joker could also have slipped in malware, right? 

This is pure, untouched ISO straight from Microsoft. "
,4n0n,2009-07-25T08:56Z,"Earlier this week there were reports that Microsoft had discovered some show-stopping bugs that would delay the RTM, but if build 7600 is legitimate, then Microsoft has obviously found a way around the issues. This build is in the process of being leaked into the wild, but we recommend exercising caution with build 7600 as Microsoft has not confirmed (or denied) its existence.

Microsoft was rumored to be aiming for compiling the RTM build on July 13, 2009. If 7600 is indeed the RTM build, we can expect an official announcement as early as tomorrow, at the kickoff of the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference, which is taking place in New Orleans. Of course, for all we know, build 7700 might end up being the RTM, so let's all hold our horses until Microsoft gives the official word."

@adisx06x: 30 or 120 days is for sure. There are no keys out at the moment. When oem-keys leaks an activator will come. (in fact they exist right now but not fully functional because there are no keys out)
With this method you can activate Windows but keep in mind that ""windows update"" function can possibly recognize that one day. But since Vista is activated with such tools MS did not!

them, hence the possible addition of expiration dates (run WINVER)

No, no: it?s just the opposite. You should be in control over your OS not Micro$haft.
Windows can be setup with bullet proof security comparable to Linux.

,iHacker0325,2009-07-27T05:10Z,"?Rearm? trick on Windows 7 is done using the similar commands and steps with Windows Vista. Follow these steps to reset and extend activation grace period from 30 days to 120 days in Windows 7:

1.Install Windows 7 without any product activation key.
2.After installation is completed, use the Windows 7 for 30 days and wait for the remaining days left to activate Windows counting down to 0, or almost zero.
3.When the activation grace period (or evaluation trial period) is almost expired or ended, log on to Windows 7 desktop, and open a Command Prompt window (i.e. type Cmd in Start Search and hit Enter).
4.Type any of the following commands into the command prompt, and then hit Enter: 
sysprep /generalize

slmgr.vbs ?rearm

rundll32 slc.dll,SLReArmWindows

slmgr /rearm

5.Reboot Windows 7 to enjoy another 30 days of free usage without worrying about activation nor even need to crack Windows 7.
6.When the activation grace period countdown timer almost running down to 0 again, repeat the ?rearm? trick to enjoy another 30 days of Windows 7 for free. User can run the rearm command for maximum of 3 times.
As rearm only works for 3 times, make sure the command is only been run when the 30 days countdown of evaluation period is almost expired."

Hi
As far as I know you currently have two options:
1. If your BIOS contains SLIC2.1 table (for instructions how to check it:  http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/07/30/how-to-check-or-verify-pc-motherboard-bios-slic-version-is-slp-oa-2-0-or-2-1-for-oem-activation/ ) you will only need the valid OEM cert matching with SLIC 2.1 in BIOS  (egg. Dell, Lenovo, HP? ) and the master serial key ( for detailed info check:  http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/07/29/windows-7-ultimate-cracked-and-activated-permanently-with-oem-slp-master-product-key-with-slic-2-1/ ) . After you import valid cert and serial key both 32-bit and 64-bit (x86 and x64) Windows 7 Ultimate system should be activated immediately.
2. Second option consists of two possibilities:
a) You can perform hardmod of your BIOS to include SLIC2.1 table and then follow first option (PS. There are some brilliant people around which can do it for you http://forums.mydigitallife.info/forumdisplay.php?f=16 ) or
b) You can use 7lo*ader  to emulate BIOS/SLIC2.1  during Windows boots up and ?trick? licensing service, to my opinion this is the easiest option. All what you may need you can find here: http://forums.mydigitallife.info/showthread.php?t=7240 "

,byzantium54,2009-08-03T00:15Z,"WINDOWS 7 BUILDS CAN BE UPGRADED TO RTC!!!!!! READ BELOW...this is from www.zdnet.com....

Microsoft really, really, really doesn?t want you to install the Windows 7 Release Candidate or RTM code over an existing installation of the Windows 7 beta (or over any interim builds, for that matter or RTM). The result is a beta-over-beta installation that could exhibit odd behaviors that a customer installing the final version of Windows 7 would never confront. Not only that, but any feedback you send in via the automated tools built into Windows 7 is mostly useless for identifying problems in the final build.

So, as a result, the RC blocks upgrades over any build earlier than 7077. If you?ve been running the original beta (Build 7000) and you try to upgrade, you?ll see an error message.

But if you insist on doing the upgrade anyway, there?s a workaround. Start by copying the entire contents of the Windows 7 DVD to a local folder (use a bootable USB drive, or create a folder in the root of the drive you?re planning to upgrade, and then run Setup from that location).

In the folder you just created, open the Sources subfolder and then open the file Cversion.ini in a text editor like Notepad.

Change the MinClient value (highlighted in yellow above) to 7000 and save the file in the same location with the same name.

You can now run Setup without being bothered by the version check."

,takedashogun,2009-12-22T18:41Z,"This IS the REAL DEAL!!! To be quite honest, i paid no attention to the others so called ""versions"" available for download. The thing is, one can never be too sure about a certain download. However, once again, this is ""DA SHIT""! Works perfectly! By the way, ""Hazar's Activator"" - about 165 kb - works like a charm !!!, every time, guaranteed! Best regards to the uploader! And of course, Merry Christmas!!!"
,DataNet,2009-12-23T22:48Z,what is the registration code?
,jawalmsley,2009-12-28T18:59Z,"iHacker0325 you talk about jaydean09s bitching and insults but you talk bout cancer in the worst possible way now who is the moron ????
(fuckin idiot) any one else lost some one dear to cancer ?????"
,iHacker0325,2009-12-31T05:17Z,"yes i have, and i did say i was sorry, jaydean is really annoying though"
,Warmonger1337,2009-12-31T16:11Z,"@jaydean09

Yes, your right there is a difference. This torrent match's hash's. Go try rip a bought copy and post it on here saying its ""golden"" not much to go by to trust it."
,iHacker0325,2010-01-01T06:40Z,"jaydean would never do that, he's not a ""geek"" , I would bet you jaydean cant tell you what checksums are, I know he does not know what port forwarding is, but at least this forum isn't mucked up with 40 posts of his complaining about people not seeding when hes not port forwarded correctly

by the way, this is a legit ISO it matches hashes from tech net"
,iHacker0325,2010-01-01T06:51Z,i still think alot of people here in the bay need to walk the plank
,Warmonger1337,2010-01-30T12:31Z,"Good Torrent Hope People Keep Seeding These 2 MSDN Leek Torrents, Their Better Then The Retail RIPS From Store DVD Since These Come With 100% Guarantee They Are Legitimate."

,waqastariq,2010-03-02T20:10Z,"The best Windows 7 torrent available!

If you cant make it work its YOUR fault...

This works I have been using windows 7 from this torrent on my primary computer since 2 months and its great... Thank you torrentshredder!"
,erikdudeftw,2010-03-16T00:04Z,"i can't get my sound working, the problem is my Multimedia Audio Controller, but i cant updatet it eather.... any ideas please tell me?...."
,someonegotmyusername,2010-03-26T14:52Z,"why is everyone talking as if this is the first working copy?. there are several others on the top 100 that work fine. i have installed many times and never block updates [you can always recrack if it falls over]

for those suggesting BACKUP of files, there IS NO NEED with windows seven. just click ""custom istall"" choose full installation, it DOES NOT format your drive. it wraps up your old information into a file on your c drive called ""windows.old"" go inside and look for your username document folder. all of your old documents will still be there, just drag them into your new document folder. [i do this for people regularly and it looks like you did lots of work backing up their shit].

if YOU DO require a format, and you don't mind losing data, then stick a windows XP disk in the drive, push it through the ""slow format"" option, then remove the disk while it is scrubbing the drive. when it finishes formatting installation will halt, then put in windows 7 disk, 

ffor extra noobs, if you can't get windows disk to boot, then turn computer on, push delete and escape to get into setup. set ""boot priority"" to cd drive. it's easy.

and to everyone with vista don't upgrade do a full re-install. and do it today.
does anybody want me to wipe their bottoms aswell?"
,nietx,2010-03-26T14:54Z,"Thank you so much. Works PERFECT with this:

,supanut,2010-03-30T14:39Z,"Works like a charm in VMware Player!
Also, my copy is activated, I can't remember which activater I used, but it is up and running, without problems that others complaint!
Hint: If you're installing this on VMware, set it to boot from .iso. That way work for me. Same applies to MS Virtual PC and Virtualbox."
,iHacker0325-hater,2010-05-02T13:23Z,iHacker0325 - you are a down right fuck wit!!! Have u ever lost anyone to cancer - by the sounds of it ... NO. I have and would love to meet u to show u how enraged i am about people using cancer (probably the most viscious desease there is) as a form of insult/threat to others. You are a total moron who has his brains stuck so far up his arse that it's suffocated and is now useless. DICK HEAD!!! 
,supanut,2010-05-28T07:11Z,"Thanks for this.
One more thing, can I use a product key from my laptop to activate this thing? My laptop has Windows 7 Home Basic installed.
Since oem keys can be use on more than one PC and more than one times, then I can use a key from my laptop since I believe it has got an oem key on it.
Also, since I'm reformatting my laptop this summer holiday, which activator would you suggest that works permanently w/o expiration date?"
,nhall1423,2010-06-06T05:39Z,how do you register it? i have a dell and i am using the dell premium key but it is not working...help!!!!
,supanut,2010-06-12T02:05Z,"For anyone who are looking for activator for Windows 7 you should try RemoveWAT. It's very safe, and it did shows no expiration date in winver. RemoveWAT is a great alternative to something like Toolkit 1.8 and other activators that modified your bios."
,squishyrob,2010-06-19T20:43Z,"what a bunch of obnoxious cunts. torrentshredder are you american? some people may not know as much as you cuz they have lives IN THE REAL WORLD!!  i have no idea what a md5 hash is unless i google it but i can bet ive had more pussy and parties than you can dream of. and i dont mean where you run round the woods dressed as an elf. now upload some more stuff for me you basement dwelling troll fucker. then masturbate using your own tears as lubricant. and try not to be such a righteous twat in future. thanks for the up, credit where credits due."
,funnyname,2010-07-19T01:43Z,This up is a golden one. From one year ago until now. (to whom it may concern)
,supanut2000,2010-07-21T03:52Z,"funnyname,
I agree with you. This one must have been a ledget one because it's one year now but still more than 300 seeders, unlike other ones I saw that now has few seeders even though it is original and stuff."
,arrirc,2010-09-21T05:31Z,"Thanks so much for this upload. Though in the name of the disc I can find that it appears to be EN edition? (There are two ""EN""s, in the name, one for English language but the other in all CAPS)Is it so? Please clarify. thanks again."

,sgt.ghost,2011-11-14T15:28Z,"If unetbootin does not work then I would suggest win2flash. It's a free program and I know that it works because I have used it to install win 7 32 and 63 bit from a flash drive several times, from multiple torrents. Nice torrent by the way Torrentshredder."
