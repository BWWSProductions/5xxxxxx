,perez817,2009-07-26T01:36Z,"HR I was wondering if you were ever going to make a windows xp port of your encode-handheld.pl?

I dont mind if the answer is no, but i would love it if you made it! "
,perez817,2009-07-26T02:09Z,"HR sorry for double post.

But if you could upload How I Met Your Mother Season 4 it would be awesome.

P.S. If you dont want to to take the trouble to look for it i found one and its HD 720p.
