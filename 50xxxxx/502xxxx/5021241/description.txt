Covering all the essential topics for undergraduate courses, this is the ideal student introduction to game theory. It sets out the basics of the subject in a non-technical way and uses illustrations and examples to show its application
to realistic, topical, and interesting problems ranging from strategic decision-making within companies to international environmental policy-making. All explanation is clear, well structured, and entirely accessible to students of both economics and business.
