Interplay Star Trek TOS Adventure Anthology (ppGames Edition)

Computer games based on the Star Trek television series were not particularly good sellers -- until Interplay's Star Trek. It was the first critical and popular hit, and helped expand the Star Trek franchise throughout computer gaming. An odd combination of flight simulator and adventure game, using an intuitive point and click interface, and featuring both space combat and landing party aspects, Interplay's Star Trek adventure games remain one of the best Original Series games to date.

The games are divided into several seperate episodes, each of which features space combat and away mission elements. During the game, you will discover new races, meet up with old friends, rescue other Federation Starships, fight in epic battles, and more! As well, there are many different possible ways to complete each mission, some better than others, which gives these games great replayability. At the end of each episode you'll be debriefed and graded on your mission by a Starfleet Admiral.

Both floppy and CD-ROM versions were released, the latter of which featured the voice talents of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols and Walter Koenig playing their original characters!

Although the graphics and sound may pale in comparison to newer games, the stories and gameplay will make this anthology one that TOS fans will find hard to put down. 

This anthology pack uses the CD-ROM versions and has, wherever possible, any source-code used for installing, launching, or playing the games. And be sure to check out some of the goodies in the games' startmenus.

******** GAMES INCLUDED ********

Star Trek: 25th Anniversary (1991)
	The first in Interplay's games based on the 1960s Star Trek TV Series, you are Captain Kirk, leader of the Starship Enterprise, the most famous ship in the history of Starfleet Command, and are able to give orders to other crewmembers. It is up to you to right the intergalactic wrongs, protect the Federation, and boldly go where no man has gone before in a series of missions that test both your wit and command. The original cast of Star Trek provided the voices on this CD version, including William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, and Walter Koenig.

Star Trek: Judgment Rites (1993)
	Interplay's 1993 sequel to their hit "Star Trek: 25th Anniversary". It uses the same DOS gaming engine as the earlier game; however, it had sharper graphics and sound, particularly with the CD-ROM edition. And like its predecessor, the game also features the original cast of the classic Star Trek in a series of new adventures, including one involving Trelane, the omnipotent child from the original episode "The Squire of Gothos". The game also took a step forward from the previous game in the series, in that at least half the missions are part of an ongoing story arc, and one is a direct sequel to the final mission of the previous game. Plus, the Space Battle sequences are now completely optional, with adjustable difficulty.
