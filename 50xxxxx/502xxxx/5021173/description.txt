Brainman/The Boy With The Incredible Brain
2005

Many people learnt of Daniel for the first time through the award-winning documentary 'Brainman' (titled 'The Boy With The Incredible Brain' in the UK). Filmed in 2004, it shows Daniel reciting the famous mathematical constant Pi from memory to 22,514 digits - a European record - before travelling to the United States to be studied by brain scientists in California, beat the house at blackjack in Las Vegas and meet the original 'Rain Man' Kim Peek in Salt Lake City. Daniel is also given the challenge to learn a new language - Icelandic - from scratch in just seven days, before an interview in Reykjavik entirely in the home language.

The documentary won a Royal Television Society award in December 2005 and was nominated for a BAFTA in 2006. It has sold in more than 40 countries worldwide.
