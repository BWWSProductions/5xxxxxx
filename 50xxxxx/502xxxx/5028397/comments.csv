silly :3
P.s thank you so much"
,Dolessus,2009-12-16T00:36Z,"Seems to be a full set. I listened to most of the songs, and they've all been the full songs with pretty good quality. Some parts got a little static, but it didn't happen much.
It seems that they're all the full albums too.
I'll be seeding this, as it seems to be a very nice download. Thank you NG."

Useful Idiot 
Message to Harry Manback
Reflection
Triad

Low quality audio on a few songs.
I do NOT recommend this torrent. There are others that are better."
