,table543,2009-08-03T16:41Z,"Does anyone know: Will windows 7 OEM allow you to update/upgrade from Vista?
Or, must do clean install? "
,jadraja,2009-08-03T23:22Z,"table543

Yes, it works and it's very easy. But be careful: if your Vista is 32 bits and you want to install Windows 7 64 bits, it's impossible...and I think it's the same problem from 64 to 32 bits.

I did an upgrade from Vista 32 bits to Windows 7 32 bits without any problem."

,Ervin1995,2009-08-11T22:59Z,what I can do at this time?? Plees help me :-/
,jadraja,2009-08-15T20:55Z,"Ervin1995

Your computer may be too old and your processor isn't compatible with 64 bits applications: this version of Windows 7 is only for 64 bits processors."
,jipukka,2009-09-17T19:21Z,"Ervin1995

If you try this DVD 32bit running Windows, you got that messages.

You can't install this in Windows(upgrade) You must install clean, boot dvd etc..."
,freddy_54,2009-10-04T02:49Z,"Sorry, but this version is not the final Build!

This is the final build:
Windows 7 Final Build 7600.16386.090714 1355

This is the real genuine final build!"
