DL, Unzip, and run with your emulator of choice.


I would recommend PCSX2.


There are 2 points in the game that might cause crashes:


- Inside of Home, before the boss.
- The Yunalesca fight/cutscene before it.

This can be solved by saving right before them, and then loading/playing through with the PCSX2 Beta 872.

Enjoy, and please seed if you have a soul.
