,leandercool,2011-05-25T21:30Z,I need an EA regestration code. How do I fix this??
,bausmaus,2011-07-08T08:16Z,"you only need the keygen at the start of installation. after installing, copy MirrorsEdge.exe from the cd file in ""Mirror's Edge 1\CrackCrackv1.01"" and paste it into ""C:\Program Files\EA Games\Mirror's Edge\Binaries"". this will replace the MirrorsEdge.exe file that is already in the folder. use this .exe to start the game and that should fix the problem of the game asking to re-enter the product key"
