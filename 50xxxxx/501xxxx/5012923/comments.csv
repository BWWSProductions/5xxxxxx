,rets1972,2009-07-21T11:20Z,wow you never seen this one?
,dsteinmetz,2009-07-22T09:42Z,"I can't believe everyone hasn't already seen this film. If you haven't, you are in for an incredible thrill. Despite being made more than twenty-three years ago in 1986, it remains one of the most exciting and respected films. The screenplay, special effects, sound, technical quality, music, and direction are nothing short of amazing. Sigourney Weaver's performance is remarkable.

I first saw the film the night it opened on July 18 with my brother. The screaming, cheering, and applause by the audience were unforgettable. My muscles ached from the tension. This is a great film to see with a group of people, especially if you can find some who have never seen it. The bigger the screen and the louder the volume, the better. Be prepared for over 2 Â˝ hours of brilliant filmmaking. Try to sit through the film from beginning to end without a break to appreciate the tension experienced by theater audiences.

To really appreciate the film, you should also view the lengthy commentary on the making of the film which was created for its 20th anniversary, which can be downloaded on TPB. Also note there are multiple editions: The special edition was released as part of The Alien Legacy DVD box set in 1999 along with Alien and Alien 3. Both the theatrical version and the special edition were released again in 2003 as part of the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set along with similar versions of Alien, Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection. A separate two-disc ""Special Collector's Edition"" DVD of Aliens was released on January 6, 2004 containing the same material as the two Aliens discs in the Quadrilogy set. Additional content in these versions included an audio commentary for the special edition featuring director James Cameron, producer Gale Hurd, special effects artists and crew members. The second disc included special features relating to pre-production, production, and post-production.

What edition is this?"
,rets1972,2009-07-24T02:47Z,wow great info but this is just the special edtion i own with the extra footage like the colony and a few other bits.
,dsteinmetz,2009-07-24T05:03Z,"I think if you have the colony scene of them receiving the order and going to investigate the first spaceship from Alien, then you have the final director's cut. But even this is not the full version of the original screenplay, which Cameron had to edit for time. Check out the 12 part commentary on the making of the film:
