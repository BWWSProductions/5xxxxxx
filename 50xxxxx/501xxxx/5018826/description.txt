This is Phoebe Courtney's shocking book Why Not Call It Treason? (1987) which exposes the Council on Foreign Relations as the America's unelected rulers who seem to fully determine which course that country is going to take. Ever since November 1986, the nation's mass communications media have been bombarding the American people with stories concerning President Ronald Reagan's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. The obvious purpose of such tactics is to try to force Reagan, who was re-elected by a landslide in 1984, either to resign or be so surrounded by advisers as to be virtually powerless. While the media have been so busy bashing President Reagan, and hearings and investigations drag on, just what is really going on in this country? What group is now in control of U.S. foreign policy, and how dangerous is that foreign policy to the very survival of the United States of America as a sovereign nation? Why Not Call It Treason defines the clear intent of the CFR to undermine American sovereignty and suggests direct legal action against it. Also includes a list of CFR members at that time. It is definetly interesting to see the familiar names of figures from politics, business and the media, all together in an organization whose stated purpose is the establishment of one world government. 130 pages. A must read for everyone.
