In Full Swing is Mark O'Connor's tribute to Stephane Grappelli, the musician he 
describes as "my biggest violin hero." His band, the Hot Swing Trio, features 
bassist Jon Burr, who toured with Grappelli for years, and guitarist Frank 
Vignola, one of the finest American players in the Django Reinhardt tradition. 
Even though the selections include standards that Grappelli played during the 
1930s with Reinhardt (such as "Lime House Blues" and "Honeysuckle Rose"), 
the music is far more than just a nostalgic recreation of the famous Hot Club 
sound. Instead, O'Connor and his bandmates have filtered musical elements 
from the past through a contemporary rhythmic and harmonic sensibility to 
come up with a style that sounds both timely and timeless. The trio is joined 
on a few tracks by singer Jane Monheit, who delivers a particularly moving 
rendition of "As Time Goes By," and by trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who plays 
a delightfully abstract duet with O'Connor on the intro to "Tiger Rag." All of 
the musicians here are at the top of their game, but O'Connor's playing, 
which blends his formidable technique with deep emotion, is particularly fine. 
Stephane would be proud. --Michael Simmons
