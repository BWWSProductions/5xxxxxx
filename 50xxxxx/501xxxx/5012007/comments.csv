EDGE Diagrammer is our ultimate diagramming tool. EDGE lets you define ""styles"" 
using hundreds of predefined drag-and-drop shapes and arrowheads. Save your 
styles in diagram templates to establish your own diagramming methods. EDGE 
Diagrammer comes with complete flowcharting templates, network diagramming 
templates, block diagrams, org charts, and more to get you started.  EDGE 
Diagrammer can create flowcharts and similar diagrams with minimal effort. As 
you draw your diagram, EDGE Diagrammer connects lines to figures and attaches 
labels to lines. It remembers these relationships and adjusts automatically 
when you move objects around. It can also adjust the size of a shape when you 
add text to it. http://www.pacestar.com/edge/desc.htm"
