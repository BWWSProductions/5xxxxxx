,Brewskie86,2010-04-13T20:50Z,"Didnt Work for me either, tells me to run full installation first."
,Urei1601s,2010-09-15T10:33Z,Is this an update?
,Urei1601s,2010-09-27T20:21Z,Confirmed. This is an update you must first install a previous version. Works just fine. Thank you XoLWoX.
,StookeyOfficial,2010-11-02T17:42Z,"Is this the demo version of Massive, i have a demo already which only allows me 30 minutes of usage at a time."
,confusioon,2010-11-29T19:17Z,This is the fucking demo verision you stupid fuck!!!
,Johnny7533,2011-01-07T01:40Z,"It works i did it nukka. 

1. DL the trial off the native-instruments.com and install it
2. run the update in this torrant
3. replace the massiv.exe file from the root file C:program files/massive...........
4.copy the VST (.DDL) FILES IN TO UR PLUGINS

n if ur using Fl studios u add it by going to your mixer
2. click on FX slot one and select,more
3. refresh the list of plug
4. click the massive plug in

,Reptile151,2011-01-22T08:27Z,"Works just fine for me, however, when I open Massive in FL Studio, I am unable to change the size of the plug-in window, or scroll down, and the plug-in window is so large that in goes off-screen halfway through, so I cannot access the lower half of the plug-in. I've tried everything I can think of, and this is driving me insane. Any ideas or solutions? "
,eltacosuave,2011-02-26T22:25Z,did you try adjusting the resolution of your screen so everything is a bit smaller and will fit on one screen better?
,jaxke_m,2011-06-18T16:45Z,"If i open massive alone it works good
but if i open it in fl studio as a plugin, it's still the demo version.
Can someone tell me a solution for this problem plz?"
,DrKoNfLiCt,2011-06-22T01:23Z,"i tryed everything , it crashes everytime on windows 7 x64"
,bmh420,2011-06-25T03:14Z,this is deffently not a demo. it worked perfectly for about two days now whenever i try to open it up in fl studios or even by it self it says it stopped working an it shuts down. does ANYBODY know how to fix this?????
,wretchrow,2011-06-27T05:56Z,"To anyone who has the problem where this program crashes after using it for a couple days, this is how you fix that. Run a search on your computer for a hidden file called ""nimassivedatabase"" (can't remember the file extension but it should still locate it) that should be somewhere within your profile data on your computer. Once the search finds this file delete it. Now run the stand-alone version of the program and it will say it needs to remake the database and it will do so and will work again in FL Studio. This won't cause you to lose any data or sounds you've created, it's just a small annoyance that some computers have trouble with for some reason. Hope that helps anyone who has this problem."
