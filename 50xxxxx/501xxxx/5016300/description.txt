Dave Brubeck's landmark 1959 album, "Time Out," is perhaps the defining record of the so-called West Coast jazz sound, a playful, dynamic set that concentrates on melody and formal composition over muscularity and improv, and (for many) a welcome step back from the aggressive hurly-burly of the more macho bebop and post-bop scenes. Even though it was an experimental concept album -- toying with unusual time signatures -- it's a comfortable, comforting record, best remembered for the hit song "Take Five," but also packed with other melodic delights such as "Three To Get Ready" and "Blue Rondo A La Turk," all of which show the brilliant interplay of Brubeck and saxophonist-composer Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello.  ~ Joe Sixpack
