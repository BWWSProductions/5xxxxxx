that their charming Victorian home has a disturbing history: not only was the house a transformed funeral parlor where 
inconceivable acts occurred, but the owner's clairvoyant son Jonah served as a demonic messenger, providing a gateway for 
spiritual entities to crossover. Now unspeakable terror awaits when Jonah, the boy who communicated with the dead, returns 
to unleash horror on the innocent and unsuspecting family.
