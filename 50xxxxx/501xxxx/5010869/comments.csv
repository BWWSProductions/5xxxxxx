i... wanna... piss... in... my... pants ! god damn it..
i hope i do here tho, im gonna freakin' turn up my volume and get my 42"" TV closer to ma face.

not a damn salesmen, not even one in the stores could point out a movie so i could finally piss my self for once, omg that's really bad service man! anybody else have any GREAT movie to inform me about?
feel free to mail me. same as my nick here, just put [AT]hotmail[DOT]com at the end.

I DON'T WANNA KNOW ABOUT SOME HORSESHIT B-MOVIE THAT'S ALL ABOUT FLYING BLOOD THROUGH THE AIR AND ROLLING HEADS ON THE DAMN FLOOR. 

THAT'S OLD BRO!



thank you Secret_Myth for uploading the movie!
but hey.... can't you upload your movies on torrentreactor[DOT]net to? coz this place sux man i got fail on the page 3 times before i finally got in here... servers is bad as hell here. keep trackers tho! trackers is ok.

would be supreme if you could do that =)
torrentreactor is totaly free and has serious users there. take care buddy!"
,gunblaster75,2011-03-14T04:13Z,"@zingo............If you want to see a movie that will make you piss yourself, watch the documentary of A Haunting in Connecticut that was put out by Discovery Channel about 10 yrs ago. That shit is scary and about 3 hrs long. This movie here pretty much put me to sleep. you can probably get the Discovery Channel one here on TPB or buy for $5 at Wal-Mart. Trust me the documentary is WAY BETTER than this one."
