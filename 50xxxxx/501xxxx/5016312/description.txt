Notes:
Tracks 1-12 are each 5 seconds of silence. (Not Included)
Bonus song "Earache My Eye" follows "My Gift To You" (track 25) after a period of talking and farting.
On sticker on front: "Follow the leader, special limited edition 2CD, includes exclusive remixes by DJ Clark Kent, Level X and Scarecrow Adams".

Follow the Leader is recognized as their mainstream breakthrough, and the album that ultimately ushered nu metal and re-ushered heavy metal into the mainstream. With more than 5 million copies sold in the U.S. and 4 million copies sold out of the U.S., it is their best selling album.

Don't forget to seed and say thanks! Cheers!
