Finding the real second episode of "Breaking the Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed" has been a tough battle. The one floating around out there that is easily obtainable is actually episode 3 by aaf. It took me a while to find this one in it's odd state of a WMV file :(.

Work done from wmv to avi:

First raw dumping from WMV to AVI to harddrive. The video seemed to be created from 2 separate sources, the entire show is there, just the first part up until the first commercial break is in fullscreen and then after it's widescreen. It was given the black bars on top and bottom to fill in after it switched from fullscreen to widescreen. So I split the video's fullscreen and widescreen resizing and cropping as needed to fit with the rest of the episodes out in the p2p community 624x352. Having to add black bars on the fullscreen's left and right sides to accommodate the widescreen's aspect ratio and pixel resolution. This proceedure took approx. 4 hours to complete. It's not perfect, but it's all that seems to be out there that's anything to do with the true second episode of this awesome series.

Tricks in this episode:

   1. Making a Girl Vanish from a Table
   2. Levitating a Girl on a Floating Table
   3. Dismemberment
   4. Making a Girl Appear from a Set of Clothing
   5. Making an Elephant Appear in an Empty Parking Lot

   And of course the smaller tricks.
