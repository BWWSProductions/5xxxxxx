For this LP-length CD reissue, tenor great Sonny Rollins plays five songs (including the unlikely "There's No Business Like Show Business" ) in a quartet with pianist Ray Bryant, bassist George Morrow, and his then-current employer, drummer Max Roach.  Rollins was an original stylist from the start, and in late 1955 he was ready to take his place among the greats. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG
