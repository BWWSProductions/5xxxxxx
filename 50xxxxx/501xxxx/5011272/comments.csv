,drcheney,2009-07-20T04:43Z,"FROM THE UPLOADER:  what do you mean?  someone needs to clarify what a ""screen shot"" is for me.  why do i need screen shots?  what do they do?  how do i do this?"
,drcheney,2009-07-23T13:15Z,by the way....it's nice to be the only one seeding this after 5 days.  can we quit it with the hit and runs already?
,gs242656,2009-07-24T13:53Z,Nobody has hit and run because nobody has got 100% yet
,thearches,2009-07-24T20:02Z,Could someone tell us what the resolution is (dimensions).  Comments on quality would also be welcome.  Thanks.

,drcheney,2009-08-12T02:28Z,"from the uploader:  this was converted from .avi format in the worst possible dimensions and audio quality possible in order to have the smallest file size possible.  

the reason for the .mp4 format is to watch it on an ipod or psp or whatever.  i can tell you that after having watched it on an ipod:  it's almost perfect quality - you can't tell that it's bad at all.  i promise you that for all intents and purposes, you'll have a great time watching these shows."
,Mickstape,2009-08-16T05:07Z,"Dr Cheney is a waste of time.

DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS FUCKING WANKER.

ALL TORRENTS BY THIS OXYGEN THIEF WILL STOP @ 95%

FUCK YOU CHENEY

FUCK YOU IN YOUR STUPID ASS"
,drcheney,2009-09-03T19:41Z,"this torrent will work perfectly fine.  this guy is right, some of my other torrents died because i seeded them for 2 weeks straight without a single other seeder - so they would stop at 95%.  sorry for that confusion.  "
,drcheney,2009-09-03T20:00Z,"oh, and all of you are welcome.  "
,ToniSoto,2009-09-29T19:50Z,"Very noble of mr drcheney not to descend to the level of Mickstape user with the absurdly offensive comments, regardless of the fact that the accusation was correct. Way to go drcheney."
,big_wiseguy,2010-01-16T16:03Z,"low quality - even for handhelds
whoever made these should look at what holyroses does for movies...the wire deserves the same treatment"
,Droog_UK,2010-02-25T12:25Z,"Loved This!
One of my favourite torrents of all time.
Watched the lot on my Blackbery this week and quality was superb.
Thanks for this"
