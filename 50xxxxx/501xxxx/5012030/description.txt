Horne & Corden is a brand new sketch show on BBC Three.


Fast becoming the UK's favourite young comedy double act, writers Mathew Horne and James Corden will be performing in front of a live studio audience, as well as leaving the studio to play a host of brand new characters - including a socially awkward spin on the meeting of Spiderman and Superman in everyday situations.

Oh, and watch out for Xander, an old boarding-school chum who is the most hideous, foul-mouthed, but well meaning man to ever rear his head from a person's past. Unfortunately, Xander specialises in turning up at inappropriate times to remind people of embarrassing moments they'd rather forget. Not like Horne & Corden - the memories of which you will hope to retain forever.
