PLOT

Best-selling author Wes Wilson's self-help book about honesty has saved millions of relationships. 
But when his fiance is abducted and declared dead, Wes suddenly finds himself hunted by hired killers, 
beautiful spies, and a ruthless criminal mastermind with a taste for both style and violence. 
What does Wes have that an international smuggling ring wants? Why did his late bride-to-be keep a secret room 
full of weapons? And who can he trust when nobody is what he or she seems to be.
