Tongass Fjords X for FSX

- unpack the Tongass_Fjords folder to your FSX installation
- add the two scenery areas to FSX:
- Run FSX, Settings -> Scenery Library -> Add Area
- browse to the Tongass_Fjords folder, highlight the Tongass_Fjords_Lower_Priority folder, check "use directly" and hit ok
- do the same for the Higher_Priority folder and make sure it's listed above the other
- done! maps and manual found in Docs


Note: probably need to run the configurator, (TongassFjords FSX.exe), for it to write the proper terrain.cfg
