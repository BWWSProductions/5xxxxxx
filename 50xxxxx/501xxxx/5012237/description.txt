hey..wazup?

This is a modified version of XP pro SP3 setup to run from a USB HDD or a Flash/Jump/Thumb/Pen Drive
(whatever you call it).

It has been tested and works (tested on a desktop with 2 gigs ram and an athlon64 x2 4200+)

Your bios have to support booting from a USB device and it is a little slow but i am running it off a jump drive
(4gig).

it should be fully functionalâ€¦have not found any issues with it yet.

 It does bitch during the install about unsigned drivers or such but, this was expected as modifications to make it
boot from USB break some of this. it also bitches about no pagefile.sys when you boot up but just ignore that as it
works anyway.

this has probably already been uploaded before but here it is just in case.

note to be on the safe side disconnect the power to your actual HDD before install to eliminate the accidental re-installing over your current OS...may also avoid conflicts too.
