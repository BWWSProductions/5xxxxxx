"Superman was born a hero.
Batman became a hero.
But only Green Lantern ... was chosen!"

This is one of my usual rip from the KART3LDVD ISO. I won't get the DVD for a few months, and I didn't want to wait with such a great source available.

Enjoy,

P.S. I am very willing to work with people can source the DVD earlier so that I can have my rips out sooner. You just need to send me a message.
