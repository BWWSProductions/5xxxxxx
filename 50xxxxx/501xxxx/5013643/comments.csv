,Mikuhly,2010-11-22T06:40Z,Can you play these torrented games on a stock PS2? Burn ISO onto a DVDR?
,Arbitrox,2010-12-27T08:40Z,Thanks for the UL bro...  to all those that are new...  Alcohol120 has a ps2 burn setting; you can also use an emulator for the pc( i suggest you have a gamepad).  For those that don't know how to unrar; buy a console.  @SithMasta  #warezguild  irc.efnet
