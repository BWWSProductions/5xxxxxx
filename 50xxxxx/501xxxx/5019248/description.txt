Designed by the same team that assembled Resident Evil Outbreak, Monster Hunter is an online action/RPG that boasts base creation, item collection, and a myriad of different creatures. Originally unveiled as a surprise title at E3 2003, the graphic-intensive slasher takes four-player gaming to a world filled with dinosaur-like creatures and bloody weapons-based battles. The game features item creation, weapon customization, and character building. Players can strip their kills of their flesh for food, claws for decoration, and bones for weapons and armor -- not to mention upgrades for existing equipment.
