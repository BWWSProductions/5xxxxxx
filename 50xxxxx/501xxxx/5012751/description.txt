How About The Truth. Most peopleâ€™s reaction is â€œWhat kind of name is that 
for a band?â€ Actually, the â€œTruthâ€ is, thatâ€™s just one example of how different 
and complex the Kansas City, Missouri based band can be. When trying to 
â€œdiscoverâ€ a name for the band in mid 2005, the first bass player John Foster 
spoke up and replied â€œHow About The Truth?â€ Thatâ€™s when the band realized 
that the â€œTruthâ€, was not only a good name for the band, but is what 
everyone really wants, not deception or lies. This became the groupâ€™s 
philosophy in dealing with their music as well as pertaining to their personal 
lives as well.

How About The Truth consists of Ricky Horney (25) from Camden Point, 
Missouri on Lead Vocals & Didgeridoo, Pat Kelley (19) Kansas City, Missouri 
playing Lead Guitar, Bryant Bridges (20) Smithville, Missouri on Vocals, Piano, 
and Rhythm Guitar, Ricky Sands (19) Agency, Missouri on Bass, with Matt 
Davis (19) Kansas City, Missouri playing Drums and Percussion.

When asked to describe the bandâ€™s musical style, that can difficult at times. 
The reason being, Hattâ€™s music cannot easily be put into a certain genre 
because the bandâ€™s style is an ongoing work in progress. The band is always 
open to new ideas with one example being, the use of the Aborigine 
Didgeridoo used in the intros on some of their songs. Melodic at its core, the 
band agrees its music has gotten heavier in the last several years. The 
closest industry classification would probably be Progressive/Alternative Rock 
with a Post-Grunge influence.

How About The Truth writes and composes all of its own songs and music. 
Three independent CDâ€™s have been released. Around The Table, Eleven To 
Elm, and Redefine (EP). The Redefine (EP) was recorded, mixed, and 
mastered at Chapman Recording Studio of Lenexa, Kansas.

"Around the Table" lineup is Bryant Bridges - Lead Vocals and Guitar, Patrick 
Kelley - Guitars, Matt Davis - Drums and Percussion, and John Foster - Bass and 
Backing Vocals.
