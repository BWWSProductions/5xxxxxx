,ezboard,2010-09-29T10:52Z,"nvm the error thing, I got it finally.

...but it don't want to hardcode my subs >"
,redox1,2010-11-06T09:27Z,Wouldn't convert properly for me - no error messages but the output vids were small and broken. Ended up using the imtoo one instead which worked for me http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5910176/ImTOO_MKV_Converter_6.0.12_Build_0914___Crack-%5BHB%5D
,d.spark,2011-01-01T16:36Z,"yeah here too small movie output and broken image, useless upload :("
,Pepsimal,2011-02-09T22:57Z,"I thought so to, I've used it for a year now, suddenly it stops the conversion after about 10 minutes, found out that it was with HD material it didn't work, when converting ordinary material up to about 640*480 it works just fine."
,tuks57,2011-08-08T16:20Z,thanks for giving out such an ultimate converter . rock on jumbo
