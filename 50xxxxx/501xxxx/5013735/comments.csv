The piratebay is great, but moderators think they are the owners of the site. If you mean in this page, well, I didn´t put any link here, I did in other torrents, but not here. Now it´s not allowed to put links in the torrents page. Anyway, I don´t care what you say, you don´t even know what spam means.  "
