TiNTiN is a series of comic strips created by Belgian artist Herge, the pen name of Georges Remi. The series first appeared in French in a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle in 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, the series has continued as a favourite of readers and critics alike for all these years.
