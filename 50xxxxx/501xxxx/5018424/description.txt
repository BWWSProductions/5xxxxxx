Angus MacLise was one of the original members of Velvet Underground, until a paying gig for the band caused him to think they were selling out, and he quit the band. He played drums and bongos, and was replaced by Maureen (Mo) Tucker. When this album actually was recorded, I don't know. The cd was released in 1999. This album is all instrumental, psychedelic, and pretty cool. Enjoy!
