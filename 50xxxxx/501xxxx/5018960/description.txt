Continuing the recent stream of â€œbands that were popular in the late-nineties/early aughts that have decided to get back together because why,â€ is Sugar Ray with their sixth studio album, â€œMusic for Cougars.â€
Itâ€™s definitely easy to scoff at the idea of the California bro-band making a comeback, but singer Mark McGrath had this to say about the bandâ€™s reunion: â€œWe have realistic views of how the music industry is today. I know people arenâ€™t sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for a Sugar Ray record. But that wasnâ€™t the point. It was purely because we love to make music.â€
