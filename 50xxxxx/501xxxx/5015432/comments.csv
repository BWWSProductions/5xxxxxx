,EzP,2009-08-02T23:47Z,"I agree with nungging, the registry serial that you provided doesn't work, this is just the freeware version of MBAM you can get from the official website with a registry key that doesn't do anything =/ "

if your lookin for zillatube i think i still got it. but if you have it, theres a trick i discovered while drunk.

step 1- put cursor where you type in the password, then type anythin.

step 2- a diolog box will pop up saying that you typed in the incorrect pass, click OK

step 3- fiinally, put ur cursor where u type in the password again and HOLD ctrl+v ( or control paste whatever u wana call it) 

but it somehow always lets me in.

ps- you have to do it every time you use it and im not 100% sure that it'll work unless you do the first 2 steps."
