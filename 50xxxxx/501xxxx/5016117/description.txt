Paper Rock Scissors Techno Remix

The comic universe of Paper Rock Scissors is explored in this digital short. Cardboard Box Man is but the chief paper product in a world where paper, rocks, and scissors everywhere are ever at war. Join Cardboard Box Man as he teams up with the King Rock (aka the King of Rock and Roll) as they do battle against the evil Dr. Scissors (although his PhD is in question).
