,remazix,2009-07-23T02:15Z,"umm hi i downloaded this crack from you 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5015293/COD_5__WaW_1.5_MP_Online_Crack_NO_PB_KICK(Working_Now)

i do wht it says i do f3 to start go into console and type

connect then server ip then i do enter but nothing happens. 

when i do my cod5 private client 1.4 no pb kick it works perfect on one server because its still 1.4 but i want to play some 1.5 and i cant. 

so when i do your 1.5 no pb kick i do same thing as i do with my 1.4  which is f3 to start then i go into console and type

connect server ip and nothing happens..... i dont get an error it doesn't connect nothing happens

Also i connect to English servers only 

what do it do?

@remazix 
Hi, first thing did u already update youre 
cod5 WaW version to 1.5?? 
and this crack isnt working realy good 
check my text above it gives a link to a new working torrent 
and if u wanna update to cod5waw 1.5 here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5012325/ 

and i see u posted already something there....
so then i think if u use vista start the crack with rightmouse button--> Run as Administrator 
with most vista users this IS REALY NEEDED

And u need the original CoDWaWmp.exe 1.5 ofcourse :) dont be stupid to overwrite a patched file on it u can only overwrite on sp "
,jordiadr,2009-07-25T19:48Z,"@maverik90 
Hi, there is no single player map only a zombie map and i also dont think there will be a new singleplayer map.....
there wasnt one in cod1 till 5 till now 
i dont see it in description also..... it's a zombie map :) 
with a new zombie map weapon"
,hellytje,2009-07-27T11:21Z,where do you have to extract this file?
,jordiadr,2009-07-27T14:17Z,"@hellytje
