Some notes from wikipedia about this release:
The F.W. Murnau Foundation (which now owns the film's copyright) and Kino International (now the film's American distributor) released a 124-minute, digitally restored version in 2002, supervised by Martin Koerber. It included the original music score and title cards describing the action in the missing sequences. Lost clips were gleaned from museums and archives around the world, and computers were used to digitally clean each frame and repair minor defects. The original score was re-recorded with an orchestral ensemble.

Notice it also says they are restoring some newly found old footage, possibly for a completely restored version, 
but restoration work is slow, we could be waiting until aftter 2010
