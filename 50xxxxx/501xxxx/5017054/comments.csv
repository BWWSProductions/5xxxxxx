,tree-hugger,2009-07-23T03:36Z,"WHY?? Well let me tell  yuh, some chump had posted this ""OLD"" episode wanted people to purchase it. So most people like myself haven't had the chance to watch this one let alone down load it.
Secondly, your poorly thought out question, can be pointed out at many other items that are available for downloading. THINK be for you post."
,djforti,2009-07-23T22:04Z,The funny thing is if this is such a WASTE of time and zmacdaddy8 is so busy than why did he bother to comment at all.  And people just keep gettin dumber by the minute. Thanks a mill for the upload. Always appreciated.
