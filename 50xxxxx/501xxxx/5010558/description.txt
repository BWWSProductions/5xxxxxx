(5 stars)
It has been a few years since we have heard rumblings from ''The Court of 
King Crimson''. ''Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With'' is a CD/EP 
that runs over 30 minutes. Anything over 30 minutes qualifies as an album as 
far as I am concerned, but when your dealing with progressive-rock 
heavyweights like this, 30 minutes is merely a warm up of what is to come, so 
standby for more soon.

Adrian Belew's voice is present to give the music a distinct flair and the 
instant recognition of their legacy. I always thought he sounded different 
from anyone else in rock, and it worked out as a perfect fit for KING 
CRIMSON's sound. Mastermind Robert Fripp remains at the helm after all 
these years and his guitar work is consistently outstanding. The beauty and 
suppleness of "Eyes Wide Open" is a huge departure from a rocker like "Lark's 
Tongues In Aspic" with its wailing guitar and odd time signatures coupled with 
jazz fused overtones. They sound as if they have not missed a step after all 
these years and remain light years ahead of their contemporaries. The best 
part about their music is their element of surprise, you never know what to 
expect from track to track, and that is what makes them so intriguing and 
fascinating to listen to.
