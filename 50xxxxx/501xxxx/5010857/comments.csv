,bigjoe,2009-07-19T14:00Z,"You will be sadly missed. A lot of the bands you've uploaded are long forgotten, they should all be thankful for yor efforts."
,tostator,2009-07-19T22:29Z,"That's a sad new...

I haven't any demonoid invitation code, so it will be difficult to find your downloads.

Thanks again for your job.

"
,tkm0718,2009-07-20T16:57Z,"True, you WILL be missed.  How does one get approved on Demonid???  It sounds like a  satanic cult...I'm scared.

,erikphnx,2009-07-21T02:20Z,80z I can't say it enough I have really enjoyed your uploads.
,gangway,2009-07-21T03:53Z,"Tnx for making my life a bit more cheerful with your music. I hope someday i can repay you, somehow. Sh*t, if i win the lotto ( delusions of grandeur LOL), Ill remember you, send you an email and deliver your cut bro. How does that sound? Hell, you'll probably spend it all on 80smusic( and beer) and then share it with the rest of us. Anyway, Im having a few beers as soon as i finish typing this, Crank the stereo full blast with some of your wicked music and reminisce about the first time i came across the superd musical repertoire of the legend known as 80zforever! What a ride it has been...."
[V],80zforever,2009-07-21T21:16Z,"Thank you for the kind words guys. I do hope you were able to find some of these records really enjoyable. I also hope you keep these obsucre records alive by sharing them with your buddies etc. 

The room was dark
It looked like someone had to get out fast
A window open by the fire escape
""How long have you been following this guy?""
The bell boy asked
""Not long enough, 'cause we got here too late."""
[V],80zforever,2009-07-22T06:16Z,The above Stan Ridgway lyrics pretty much sums up the fate of TPB! hahaha
,JettBlack9,2009-07-22T12:01Z,"THANKS FOR THE FIRST STRANGE ADVANCE LP.
YOU ARE THE KING!

,JettBlack9,2009-07-22T12:01Z,"I couldn't find David Reilly on RYM or Discogs.
Now that's obscure!"
,80scrazy,2009-07-23T07:52Z,80's you have filled a lot of gaps in my music history......thanks for all your help!!
,blingpig,2009-07-26T03:37Z,"I clicked on your name and it listed all you have done. I spent all day Saturday downloading quite a bit. Hope I get it all before this goes tits up. Demonoid may be limited to accessible members only, so I won't be able to follow you. Your work here is remarkable and greatly appreciated. Only one album of the 60 I have played so far is suspect. That makes me believe you have a great music appreciation sense. I hope you decide on someone besides demonoid but I will treasure these excellent albums. Sorry I'm long winded, but I wanted to express my gratitude. Thanks ever so much! "
,gangway,2009-07-27T19:21Z,Tnx 80zforever! Ill be eternally in your debt! This music is now part of the soundtrck of my life.. Cheers!
