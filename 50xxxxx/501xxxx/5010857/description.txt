It's probably my last post of these series unless there's a new twist to the whole tpb ordeal (which I doubt). I will also complete the new wave complex series before deleting my account.

For those of you wondering where I'll be posting in the future, If I do it would be most probably on Demonoid. If I get an invite to another private site, I will get be active there too. 

Now here's how this story ends (or not!). Four great records that are ultra hard to find. I doubt anyone was looking for David Reilly's album though (David who?) as this one is truly obscure.


David Reilly - Life On Earth [1982] 

Radio Heart (feat Gary Numan)- Radio Heart [1987]

Stephen Duffy - Because We Love You [1986]

Strange Advance - Worlds Away [1983]
