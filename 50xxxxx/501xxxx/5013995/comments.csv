,sandoz27,2010-08-11T22:04Z,"is it work with (pal) ??? ...
or jest (ntsc) :( .... "
,slackgit,2011-09-22T20:33Z,"NTSC only. This is precursor legacy.

Seems to be working okay so far with openps2loader over smb using modes 2, 3, 6 and 7. Save games work too."
,samljer,2012-04-02T03:12Z,"Works fine on PCSX2 - would prefer to use PAL for emulation ""less max FPS = better performance"" but this works perfectly."
