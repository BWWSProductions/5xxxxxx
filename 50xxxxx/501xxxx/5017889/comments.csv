,Benta,2009-08-24T01:02Z,"Somebody got to help me! From the ""Spor - D&BA Risky Presents"" he starts playing a lot of Spor remixes in a huge mix. I need to know what song/remix that plays from 53:00 to until 56:40 in the 87:32 long podcast by Risky! 

I cant seem to find it in the torrent

I rly want it, would be happy if someone knew and could tell! Thx alot!

Thx alot for a great torrent!"
[T],sjbrand99,2009-08-24T12:01Z,"Sorry Benta, but I am not too sure. I can't seem to find a tracklist for the podcast :S

It is most likely a dubplate remix which he keeps exclusively for mixes/sets - which is very common with dnb artists.

Perhaps someone else can help?

Anyway... Thanks for the appreciation guys!"
