,dp2746,2009-12-05T09:49Z,"Downloading now, does anyone know why they cut like 7 episodes from the dvd set?"
,oversoul53,2010-05-25T04:57Z,"@dp2746 it's because each DVD has the end half of one season and the first half of another. 

hey MeesterDaveed Volume 8 comes out June 15th and it'll have the first 8 episodes of Season 8, would u mind uploading those when they come out?

u could do a season 8 DVrip and TV rip too, the DVD episodes would be Road to the Multiverse-Dog Gone."
,oversoul53,2010-06-26T05:36Z,"btw, if any of the season 7 DVDrips came out before 2010 then it's fake. cuz in order for somone to make a DVDrip of the ENTIRE season 7, the would need volumes 7 AND 8, and vol 8 didn't come out til 10 days ago, sooo... yeah... "
