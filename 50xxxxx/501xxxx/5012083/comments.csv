I was taught to google ""Movie"" titles and that always leads me to a preview, but there may be away to do it here at Pirate Bay I'm still learning. As for this movie agian GREAT, the quality isn't bad for a cammed movie and yes it gets fuzzy at the end but not enough that you can't or won't want to finish the movie. I know that ""Pirate Bay's"" bar is set VERY high when it comes to movie quality, but give em a break they can only offer what's out there and again this is no were near aweful or anything. So if you've been wanting to see this move half as much as I did, I'm sure you won't be disappointed! Get some tissues and enjoy"
