The J. Geils Band (pronounced "Guiles" was an American rock band formed in 1967 in Worcester, Massachusetts, that had a successful R&B-influenced blues-rock sound in the 1970s, before moving towards a more pop-influenced sound in the 1980s, which brought them MTV airplay and their 1982 international hit single, "Centerfold."
