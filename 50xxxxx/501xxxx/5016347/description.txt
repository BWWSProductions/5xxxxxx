Plot:
As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously 
"This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.

Notes:

Vid: Spanish TS
Audio: Direct -STG 

This is a combo of the Spanish TS vid and the STG audio:
Firstly I tweaked the colors, sat, hue, adjusted contrast...ect...., then sharpened the vid a bit.

The audio I got from the Stuffie's release and removed the hiss and much of the background noise,
then ran it through some EQ's....think it came out nicely...IMHO

....Take it or leave it.

Greets to:
NNC, STG, Diamond, THS, PrisM, Encode, DEViSE, BDK, RaBiD, Stash, FaTaL, 
Empire, Spire, Flawl3ss, ViSiON, satya, traphouse, Escalade,...and more.

"Resistance is Futile."
Enjoy!
Lynks
