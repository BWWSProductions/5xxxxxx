Twelve years in the making, Rhett Butler's People marks a major and historic cultural event for millions of Gone with the Wind readers, complementing and adding new dimensions to its timeless story.

Through the storytelling mastery of award-winning writer Donald McCaig, the life and times of the enigmatic Rhett Butler unfolds. Meet Rhett as a boy, a free spirit who loved the marshes and the tidewaters of the Low Country, and learn of the ruthlessness of his father, whose desire for control resulted in unspeakable tragedy. Through Rhett's eyes we meet the people who shaped him in other ways: the overseer's daughter, Belle Watling; Rhett's brave and determined sister, Rosemary; Tunis Bonneau, the son of freed slaves and Rhett's childhood friend who understood him like no one else; and Jack Ravanel, whose name became inextricably linked to heartbreak.

And then, of course, there is Scarlett. Katie Scarlett O'Hara, the headstrong, passionate woman whose life is entwined with Rhett's: more like him than she cares to admit, more in love with him than she'll ever know. Rhett Butler's People, brought to vivid and authentic life by the hand of a master, fulfills the dreams of those whose imaginations have been indelibly marked by Gone with the Wind.
