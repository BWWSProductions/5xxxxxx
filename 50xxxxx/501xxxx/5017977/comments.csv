Props to Vitality for the crack too. ^_~"
,KevMovieMan,2009-07-23T15:34Z,"Mustafa 94:

Those console controllers can be a bit touchy on the pc sometimes. I know that the 360 controller don't work well at all with FPS games so I wouldn't be surprised if there were some limitations for the PS3 controller as well. Just google it and see if there are others who r dealing with the same thing."

"
[V],Subzero!,2009-07-23T18:35Z,"we are triple-checking our releases, so moan on some other places... i guess your problem is the eagerness... making out of an installing process a frantic situation... geezUs!.

ps: and writing something like ""getting errors"" doesnt helps anyone, dont you are able to write down the EXACT error messages?, again, ""the eagerness"" won!... cheers!, good luck with the other downloads!. hope they are easier for you, although , it cant be much easier at all ;)...
