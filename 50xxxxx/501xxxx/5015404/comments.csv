,acer99,2009-07-23T22:19Z,"Academy Award-nominated Atonement director Joe Wright teams with screenwriter Susannah Grant to tell the true-life story of Nathaniel Ayers, a former cello prodigy whose bouts with schizophrenia landed him on the streets after two years of schooling at Juilliard. Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is a disenchanted journalist stuck in a dead-end job. His marriage to a fellow journalist having recently come to an end, Steve is wandering through Los Angeles' Skid Row when he notices a bedraggled figure playing a two-stringed violin. The figure in question is Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a man whose promising career in music was cut short due to a debilitating bout with mental illness. The more Lopez learns about Ayers, the greater his respect grows for the troubled soul. How could a man with such remarkable talent wind up living on the streets, and not be performing on-stage with a symphony orchestra? Later, as Lopez embarks on a quixotic quest to help Ayers pull his life together and launch a career in music, he gradually comes to realize that it is not Ayers whose life is being transformed, but his own."
,sirac1925,2009-07-27T16:08Z,the director prevents the film from getting stuck on Cliche (as this was an Oscar bait film).. so probably worth the time............NOTHING DEEP TO THIS

Generalizing an entire country based on a few negative incidents is also a sign of ignorance. "

Metacom is right.  Also, using words incorrectly to convey your theory is considered ignorant.  You're starting to sound like a pretty stupid bloke."

,infocom4ever,2009-08-05T21:56Z,The soloist....female...violins...to deep... or you cant even imagine what sick stuff they put up at tpb.    
,OttoBismark,2009-08-08T08:13Z,"thanks blowley 

@MovieMadness101- it was a reference to you advertising for microsoft, there are open source free and superior media players (like vlc), thought maybe you worked in Redmond. Just a guess.
like that scum spammer  for film-tub that is everywhere these days"
,jackjaguar,2009-08-09T12:38Z,theres nothin 'too deep' in the movie...its just too boring....
,Bob__Dole,2009-08-16T21:58Z,"dorkmunchis, how can it possibly ""save bandwidth""?  Whether you get it all at first or stream it as you watch, you still devote ALL the bandwidth it takes to get the entire thing unless you decide you don't like it and quit watching before it's finished.

It will save upload bandwidth temporarily but so what?  There is enough of that when you are doing other things."
,MojoBender,2009-08-21T20:06Z,"@ Barryosterburg

If you're going to try to insult someone in their native language, I would highly recommend not making yourself sound like an idiot while you did it.  Not all of us are fat, not all of us are dumb, not all of us are jackasses.  In conclusion, if you really want to prove you're better than us, prove you are less ignorant than those of us you despise so much.

@ blowley

Great upload!  Thank you.  I love the information you provided in your info section.  Keep up the good work.  :)"
