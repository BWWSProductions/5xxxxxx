[Lyrics]

Man walks along the railroad track
Hes goin some place, theres no turnin back
The highway patrol chopper comin up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin around the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleepin in their cars out in the southwest
No job, no hope, no peace, no rest, no rest!

And the highway is alive tonight
Nobodys foolin nobody is to where it goes
Im sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin for the ghost of tom joad

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
Hes waitin for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin in the cities aqueducts

And the highway is alive tonight
Nobodys foolin nobody is to where it goes
Im sittin down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old tom joad

Guitar solo

Now tom said; ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Whereever theres a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma
Ill be there
Wherever somebodies stuglin for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin to be free
Look in their eyes ma,
Youll see me! (repeat 8 times)

And the highway is alive tonight
Nobodys foolin nobody is to where it goes
Im sittin down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of tom joad.
