In this raucous romantic comedy, John (Owen Wilson) and his partner in crime, Jeremy (Vince Vaughn), are emotional criminals; they know just how to use a woman's hopes and dreams for their own carnal gain. Their modus operandi is to crash weddings so they can meet guests who want to hook up with someone else on such a romantic day. But when John meets Claire (Rachel McAdams), he discovers what true love -- and heartache -- feels like.
