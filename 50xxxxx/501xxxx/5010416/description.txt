Found this on a forum and it works great for me. Had trouble at first so you will probly have to fiddle with it like I did. Theres read me inside, follow it.

In case it helps, I swtched res like document said, but got a black screen. switched back to direct 3d mode, failed again. Tried one last time and it worked with log file on desktop this time. So yeah, just mess with it a bit and share for other people.
