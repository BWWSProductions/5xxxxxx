____________________________________________________________________________________________
This is a free dvd entirely filmed/recorded and made by fans of Nine Inch Nails who attended
the show on the 24.02.09.  I dont claim any ownership of anything in this DVD, all the videos
in this dvd have a rightful owner as listed in the contributions section.  I (Goldy) do...
take full credit in making this dvd.  This DVD has been burned in  with Dolby Pro Logic II
Surround Sound, so fucking crank it up.  This concert was a fucking memorable concert right 
from the amazing setlist, to the 40 minute power outage and all the way to the fucked up vibes of
the crowd and mosh.  This dvd is another to add to the collection and to once again remind
you why Nine Inch Nails is no doubt one of the greatest music legends to ever exist, enough from 
me, now enjoy the fucking show.
