,the1geekman,2009-07-20T09:55Z,"Not sure if the DVD is PAL or NTSC since I didn't author it, but I'm guessing PAL.  I'll find out.  As for why it was deleted the first time, I'm having some issues with my seedbox VPS connecting to the torrent, I had assumed it was an issue with the tracker info in the torrent, but this was not the case.  Sorry for the inconvenience."
