DUKE NUKEM 3D - ATOMIC EDITION:

Duke Nukem having shoved his size 13 boot into the Alien Emperor's face before blowing it off with his shotgun, is recalled from vacation to deal with an alien-human hybrid that threatens humanity. A new weapon called the expander is available, plus a usual assortment of "Dukai Sushai" traps, paraphernalia, and captive strippers make the cut.


Just drag and drop the folder to the PSP>GAME directory and run like any other homebrew. Tested and fully working on both slim and phat models.... 

I have now figured out how these games are ported so expect to see a lot more of these coming from me in the near future.....KloWn
