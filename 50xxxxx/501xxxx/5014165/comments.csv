,lotr1980,2009-07-22T11:09Z,cant look up or down 
,Rage323,2009-07-23T18:26Z,"dumbass... you CAN'T look up or down, its a Doom type game, point in the general direction of target and let loose!"
,Varkrath0,2009-09-14T04:54Z,"no, actually, you CAN look up and down.  You have a jet pack and shit so you have to be able to look up and down.  You obviously have never played this game on anything it was ever ported to.  I had the original Atomic Edition for DOS.  I ran it using Windows NT.  Even the N64 version you could look up and down the only N64 FPS i know of with a jetpack in multiplayer.  I was even playing this game on an iPod Touch (iPhone) after jailbreaking it and you could look up and down on THAT one too.

No for a real answer.

This PSP port needs some explaining.  It is a computer game that is running on the PSP.  No emulator.  So, the game thinks it has a keyboard and such.

Start  = Enter
Selete = Esc
Home = Nothing?
L        = <
R        = >
Circle  = Right Ctrl
X        =  Z
Box    =  fuck if i know

the controls are really funky.  My PSP crashed 3 times while i was playing with all the buttons.  I think holding Home and pushing start just makes the game freeze.  Good proof of concept, crappy game... mostly becuase load wouldn't work (for me)."
