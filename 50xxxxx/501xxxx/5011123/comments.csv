You said ""I had a quick search around TPB and did not find this classic"". There were at least 2 uploaded before yours so you probably didn't find them as you were searching for ""Delerious"". Surely one of the first rules of uploading has to be to know the name of the thing you're uploading.

Also hardcoded subtitles is never a good idea but slightly more acceptable on a foreign film. Here it is a huge distraction to English speakers.

On the plus side the quality is OK, but overall the hardcoded subs ruin it and because you have given the torrent the wrong name seeders will always be low. Avoid. "
