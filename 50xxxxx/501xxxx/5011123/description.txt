This is my "cherry popping" at uploading torrents. I had a quick search around TPB and did not find this classic (Only as Audio Book) and thougt this would be a perfect intro!

Anyway since this is my first time there are room for errors, even tough I have followed the tutorials @ suprbay. 
Feel free to comment anything, both good and bad, so I can be inspired and most important learn!
