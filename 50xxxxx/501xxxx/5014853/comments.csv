You will need an SD card and a USB hard drive to store the game images."

Use NeoGamma as the USB Loader or use USB loader GX. Both have #002 fix.

You need to get the alt-dol file from the Wii Sports Resort ISO.

Open it in Wii Scrubber and go to partition2>sys >mpls_movie and save the player.dol file.

Rename the Player.dol file to RZTE.dol

For NeoGamma enable the #002 fix setting and Enable the Alt_dol setting. Place the RZTE.dol in the NeoGamma folder that should be located at the root of your SD card.

For USB Loader GX enable the #002 fix setting and Enable the Alt_dol setting. Place the RZTE.dol in the root of the SD card.

Both ways should work. Also I would update to cIOS38_rev14 which came out the other day.

After you play the motion+ video the first time you can then disable the Alt_dol option in whatever USB loader you decided to use."
