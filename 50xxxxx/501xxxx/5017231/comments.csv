I'll have a zshare link posted in about 3 minutes, if some of the regulars could grab that file and start seeding - I'd really appreciate it. Thanks...."
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-22T17:35Z,"Here it is:

(change * to z)

Also, the ampersand gets malformed by z share so you'll need to rename it to 2009-07-22-O&A CF64K.mp3 before seeding. 

Thanks again, sorry for the BS but it's out of my hands...."

,VastLite,2009-07-22T17:44Z,I will be seeding on my miserly 256k for the foreseeable future. 
,Frrrrrrrrrrankus,2009-07-22T18:25Z,I'll seed for the next 2 hours...
,Craskill,2009-07-22T18:54Z,"Thanks MG, will seed for 2 hrs."
,VastLite,2009-07-22T19:18Z,"My part is done... ended up with a ~400 share ratio.
Gotta love satellite internet. (b with a bunch of o's)"
[T],shuazien,2009-07-22T19:41Z,Thank you all who helped.  Especially thank you to goosey!! 
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-22T20:41Z,"Yes thanks. I ended up seeding myself alright so I'm not gonna bother to do it for the 128k (z share link), but I did notice 3 or 4 seeds pop in early on that 64k - thank you. 128k up in a matter of minutes...."

[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-23T16:06Z,"Just a heads up, not sure if it was weather or what but when I checked this morning my 128k rip was cutting in and out. I was fucking livid, I called in just so I could re-run the antenna today. Not sure if the first rip is salvageable, I may need to grab the replay. 64k should be up between 11:30 / 12 though..... "
