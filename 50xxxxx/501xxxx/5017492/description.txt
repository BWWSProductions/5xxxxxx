With the teaming up of Jeff Beck on lead guitar, Rod Stewart on vocals, Ronnie Wood on
bass and Tony Newman on drums to form the first Jeff Beck Group, the world witnessed the
birth of a new genre in music: heavy metal. With Beck's blistering blues riffs and Stewarts
gravelly hobo voice, this is where the SuperGroups first started. Originally issued as two
seperate albums, Truth and Beckola are brought together here on one CD, and this is a must
for any serious rock music fan. Admittedly, the sound lacks the dynamism and performance
of, say Led Zepplin, but easily makes up for this in the musicianship, vocals and, not least,
the songs. The first album to be released, Truth, features some classic blues rock songs such
as I ain't Superstitious and Rock My Plimsoul, whilst at the same time effortlessly slipping into
the more soulful Greensleeves and Ol' Man River. Sound dymanics and contrast are an
important and oft overlooked ingrediant in the best of heavy rock. The arrangements, here,
however, are full of light and dark corners and shade. This is a classic album which redefined
rock music in the mid/late sixties. Beckola, on the other hand, goes one step further and
offers something genuinely innovative and as such can be viewed as a landmark album from
1969. Nicky Hopkins joined the group on keyboards and Rod Stewart was at his zenith as a
blues singer and Jeff Beck was rapidly developing into a serious heavy blues guitarist.
Whatever music Beck had made before was only leading up to this beathtaking album. The
accent, as the sleeve notes explain, is on heavy music. And it doesn't come any heavier than
this. Plynth, Hangman's Knee and Rice Pudding are all intelligently arranged songs, avoiding
the crash bang wallop school of heavy rock, prefering instead an air of control and suspense.
Historically important as these two albums are, they are still as exciting and fresh as the day
they were released
