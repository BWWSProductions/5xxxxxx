[T],60Hertz,2009-07-19T19:00Z,"I personally really like this album, but I haven't heard much of their old stuff so I can't compare. Enjoy the album!"
,rock-demon,2009-07-20T01:35Z,"as far as i am concerned all silverstein is good, this one i great, my favourite on the cd is vices feat liam cormier, and yes this some of the  better silverstein"
,jmcfizzle,2009-10-09T04:05Z,"I agree silverstein is a good band with some good songs but this cd blows the rest outta the water. 
Usually by a bands fourth cd they're just the remaining shit outta their ass but I'll repeat myself, this is Silverstein's best."
