,rontorr,2009-07-21T08:11Z,"Thanks for the show, it has been a good watch, BUT I SURE WISH SOMEONE WOULD STAY ON AND SEED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS LIKE I DO,  (I'M STILL SEEDING 68,69) it takes some of us a couple or three days to download anything. In 1d6h Ihave only downloaded 96MB of this, and in 4d 6h only 68% of ep 70 and I can't find ep 71
  Can anyone upload Good Eats? Alton Brown is my 8yo son's favorite TV cahracter, also any Nascar or Aussie v8s, we who live in Thailand are Quality TV deprived."
