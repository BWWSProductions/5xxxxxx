Episode 128 - Masking Tricks and Reflections
Sunday, May 31st, 2009 â€“ running time 15:03

Create realistic reflections of light using layer masking and warp distortions.

*** Create a reflection in windows
In Bert's Time Square piece, he focuses on an LG ad that is reflecting on a neighboring building's windows. To create this reflection, flip a copy of the original image horizontally, and distortion and masking to match the window's reflection surface. Having trouble trying to visualize a reflection? Simply pull out a mirror to create a a model. Here are the details:

*** Use Warp for distortion
Windows create some distortion on any reflection, so you will have to add some ripples of your reflection layer to create a realistic effect. Start the distortion by duplicating the reflection layer, then turning off the original reflection - you'll need this original reflection layer later. Warp (Transform > Warp) a vertical slice of the image and pull in the anchors to give the image s slight ripple effect. Repeat for the remaining slices of the image. After completing the warps, Bert cuts removes few slices of the image, whose selection matches the window's separations. Turn on the original reflection layer, then warp the portions of the image you just deleted. Merge these two reflection layers. Next we'll apply a mask.

*** Apply masking
Since a reflection consists only of light, you will be able to see transparency more strongly through the darker portions of the image. Turn down the reflection layer's opacity in dark areas by creating a single mask on your reflection layer. You can do this by clicking the mask icon while the reflection layer is active (the icon is third from the left on your layers window). Since the dark portions of this image are somewhat solid, such as the logo and banners, Bert can create a reflection by using the magic wand tool. With this selection, fill the mask with 50% gray. This makes your opacity in the selected areas transparent by 50%. He then brings down the entire opacity of the layer down to 88%, so that the whole reflection is somewhat transparent. In this demonstration, there is a separate layer containing the window's edges. These need to show through the image, so makes a selection (Ctrl click) of the window edges, then fills the reflection mask with 100%. Now, the reflection only appears on the glass, and not the window edges. Add more tone by lightly brushing your mask in desired areas.
