Essential Blues is an attempt to trace the evolution of the music from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago and other modern, urban cities.   It does a fairly good job in providing a brief history, but the main strength of the collection simply comes from the music.   Featuring cuts from Lightnin' Hopkins, Howlin' Wolf, B.  B.   King, Slim Harpo, Junior Parker, Elmore James, Albert Collins, and many, many others, it's a quick and effective way to sample a variety of different blues styles.   For neophytes, Essential Blues does offer a splendid introduction to the genre.  

If you are just starting to collect blues recordings, then you would really enjoy this one.  It includes some very popular ones, like the tracks by Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, and BB King, as well as many lesser known artists.  But it's all good, and the variety in style that you hear from track to track makes this a great CD to play over and over again.  It's a lot of blues for the money, if you can find it! ~ Patrick Madigan
