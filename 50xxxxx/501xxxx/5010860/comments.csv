Oh, BTW, maybe you got some other complete seasons in 720p from past years, that aren't available anywhere else!?"

It's very likely (but i'm not sure about a lot of trackers in the world :) )"

,fred15q5,2010-02-05T01:12Z,"Why couldn't you have uploaded this in a format that 99% of the people here would use? ie: xvid and mp3 at 350MB.

for what it's worth, i want to watch these on my standalone xvid player and so have to transcode. I use ConvertXtoDVD to get a dvd format and files. This is payware. unless you are resourceful.

Then i used autogordianknot (AGK) to translate to xvid/mp3 standard 350 MB avi file.

if anyone has the series in this format could you upload.

Thanks."
