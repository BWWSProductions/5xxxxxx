Fantastic music and a great tribute to the series...

Can't wait for ""The Plan"" to come out in November."

Simply Frackin' Fantastic

And so say we all!"

Any way, I will buy it when coming to my country. Just for paying Bear efforts"
,Enigma_x,2009-08-18T20:22Z,"Thank you so much for a great soundtrack.  Great Sound.  I was suprised that season 4 was 2 CDs.

For those who are into soundtracks, and especially BSG soundtracks I recommend wikipedia for more information.  It is great for song and file lists.
