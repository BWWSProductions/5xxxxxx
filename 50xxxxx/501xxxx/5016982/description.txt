Dearest Stern Fans,

Most of you are aware of the recent announcement regarding the ownership of The Pirate Bay.  For those of you who are in the dark about this issue I regretfully inform you that a software company,  namely Global Gaming Factory,  has decided to take ownership of TPB and all of it's trackers.  Their plans are to totally deface the true beauty and sharing freedom that this site stands for by completely remodeling the site as a legal pay-to-use company.

     What does that mean? 

         * All Pirate Bay trackers will become private.
         * Subscribers must pay a monthly fee to stay a member.
         * All Illegal and Copyrighted material will be removed.
         * Someone made baby jesus cry.

Now to discuss what the future holds for those of you who enjoy my Howard Stern torrents.  Thankfully there is a solution to the first three problems (sorry baby jesus).  In response to the dire news,  pirates around the world have united and started a development project which includes two new open source trackers for public torrent uploaders to use as they please.  Both http://www.publicbt.com and http://www.openbittorrent.com have launched recently to help people make the transition into the post-piratebay world.  The sites do not host content nor do they list the torrents that are using their trackers.  They simply provide the trackers to be used by torrents.  This will ultimately avoid any legal action taken towards the project since they are not hosting any illegal content directly and should protect the trackers from ever being taken down.

Now that there are two reliable trackers to use the matter at hand becomes which BitTorrent site to use for posting torrents.  I have narrowed it down and am currently experimenting with Mininova as the eligible replacement.  It is the closest resemblance to TPB as far as functionality and popularity.  What I suggest to Stern Fans is that they sign up for MiniNova and start getting accustomed to the site as well as downloading & seeding torrents.  Play with the site a little and get used to the format and setup of functions such as user profiles.

Now to explain the process of the transition so you guys will understand why I need your help.  I have been uploading the Howard Stern Show for over 6 months now as well as various episodes of Howard TV spanning over 80 torrents.  I would like to keep this collection of Howard Stern media as well as continuing my daily show uploads to build on to it.  This means that I will have to transfer the torrents over to MiniNova and change to the new trackers.  Luckily there is a program called Torrent Editor which makes this process much easier by allowing you to edit an existing torrent and change the trackers for it.

Since The Pirate Bay should stay unchanged until the end of July the plan that I have will hopefully work out perfectly.  I am going to continue posting the show here until the The Pirate Bay officially hands over the keys to Global Gaming Factory and the site goes private.  In the meantime,  I am going to start transferring my older Howard Stern torrents over to MiniNova. The way I am going to do it is posting torrents that include an entire month's worth of the show rather then trying to re-seed every single show separately.  Basically just the shows that still have about a 10:1 ratio of seeders to uploaders.  So I might just forget about a few months worth.  Don't worry!  We'll start over and there will be a lot more.  So if the time table goes perfectly the Pirate Bay site should go down at the end of July and I can package up all of July's shows as the final torrent to be transferred to MiniNova.  Then when the first show of August airs I will post the first new separate daily show on Mininova.

I am asking for you guys to help me make the transition and in return help yourself continue to enjoy my Howard Stern torrents without it being too confusing of a change.  I will promise you that Mininova is just as well put together as The Pirate Bay and is definitely the perfect replacement.  I am calling upon all of my Stern fans to go sign up to Mininova and look out for my torrents under the same user name "wushdishmeen".  When the first monthly package is posted I would highly appreciate it if you guys could help seed them for their initial life span until it circulates enough to keep it alive.

I seriously appreciate all of the support that I have been given over the months.  I am happy to provide and share Howard Stern media for the true fans out there.  Howard is a big part of my life and I know you guys appreciate the show just as much as me.  That is why I do this and that is why I need you to help me!  By helping me you ultimately help yourself and others just like you.  Sign up to MiniNova and keep an eye out for my torrents!

Sincerely,
wushdishmeen
REMEMBER THE NAME
