I had seeds from this user in my downloads for a week before finally throwing them away... you know, it only counts as seeding when you have your computer on! I got the whole season from someone else, but episode 24 is broken, so I do hope he turns his comp on once in a while... fast downloads depend on A) Your connection speed, B) the seeder's connection speed, C) Traffic, and D), does he even turn his computer on more than once a week?! You have to do more than keep the completed downloads in the comp to seed, you need to leave the computer on once in a while! SHARE!"
