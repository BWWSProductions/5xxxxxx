Sex and the City is an American cable television series. The original run of the show was broadcast on HBO from 1998 until 2004, for a total of six seasons.

Set in New York City, the show focused on four women, three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties. The quirky drama/comedy had multiple continuing story lines and tackled socially relevant issues such as sexually transmitted diseases, safe sex, heartbreaks, multiple partners, and promiscuity. It specifically examined the lives of big-city professional women in the late 1990s and how changing roles and expectations for women affected the characters.

The show was primarily filmed at New York City's Silvercup Studios and on location in and around Manhattan. Since it ended, the show has been aired in syndication on networks such as TBS, WGN, and many other local stations. However, basic cable outlets excise certain explicit show content that was broadcast in the original version.

In comparing advertisements placed in "Was It Good For You?"[4] vs. those placed in an episode of Malcolm in the Middle, the researchers discovered that "programs heavy on sexual content actually lead to less recall of ads that appear in commercial breaks"[5] and that sex was only an effective tool for selling to men.
