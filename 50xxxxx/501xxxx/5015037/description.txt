This is a good new entry by the wildly popular '90s band Sugar Ray. It's a great 

comeback, and I hope you all enjoy it. If you do like it, please spend a little

bit of cash and buy the album to show your support for the band's first new 

release in six years. Amazon has it downloadable for only $4:
