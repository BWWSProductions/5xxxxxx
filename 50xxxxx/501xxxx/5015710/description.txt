Direct From the Moon

A Japanese lunar orbiter, custom-built to map the moon's surface and measure its magnetic and gravitational fields, beams high-definition images back to Earth. Nearly 40 years after Apollo astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin enthralled the nation when they became the first men to land on the moon, lunar exploration has returned to the headlines as new information is being uncovered about the birth of our solar system. With stunning footage from the Kaguya lunar orbiter, Direct from the Moon reveals images of the moon and Earth in spectacular detail like never seen before.

Featuring Buzz Aldrin and NASA scientists, Direct from the Moon explores the past, present and future of lunar expeditions from the Apollo missions to the challenges involved with establishing a lunar outpost and innovations under way that will inspire the next generation of space exploration.
