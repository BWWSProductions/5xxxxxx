Life In Slow Motion - David Gray [2005]


Amazon.Com

On His Seventh Album (And First For Dave Matthews' ATO Label), David Gray Refines His Sonic Palette With Wonderful Results. The First Record Made In A "Real" Studio And The First Done With An Outside Producer (MOR Hotshot Marius De Vries), It's A Nice Improvement Over 2002's Lukewarm, Sparsely Electronicized New Day At Midnight. There's Quite A Bit Of Diversity Afoot; "Hospital Food" Begins With A Sheen Of '80s-Cheese Keyboards, While "Alibi" Has An Orchestral Pop Arrangement That Brings To Mind Rufus Wainwright Collaborating With Jeff Lynne (And Yes, That's A Good Thing). The Album's Title Seems To Refer As Much To The Fact That The Album Took Three Years To Appear As The Way The Songs Unfold Glacially. With His Band Really Fortifying Him Throughout, Parts Sound Like Coldplay Unplugged. But Where That Band's Lyrics Start With Self-Doubt And Burrow Inwards From There, Gray Seeks Absolution, Something Beyond Himself. He Also Seems To Have A Sense Of Humor. It's Too Bad Six Feet Under Is Off The Air; This Entire Album Would Make A Great Soundtrack For A Special Episode. Slow Motion Is, In Its Subtle Way, A Huge Step: The Blue Eyed Folk-Soul Singer's First Truly Stadium-Ready Album.

Life In Slow Motion Debuted At #1 And Stayed There For 3weeks On The Irish Top 75 Albums, In The United Kingdom A Week After Release In Ireland, It Debuted At #1 And Stayed There For 2 Weeks On The UK Top 75 Albums. The Album Debuted And Subsequently Peaked At #16 On The US Top 200 Billboard Album Chart.
