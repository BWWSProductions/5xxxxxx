Jack of Fables 36 (2009) (Minutemen-DTs)
Written by Chris Roberson

Cover by Brian Bolland

Featuring an untold tale of Jack's past drawn by guest artist Tony Akins and written by guest-scripter and novelist Chris Roberson (HOUSE OF MYSTERY #13)! "Jack 'n' Apes" is the exciting true story of the time our hero found himself in equatorial Africa in nothing but his underpants, was taken prisoner by a bunch of talking apes, and in no time had set himself up as their king. That's right, monkey fans, Jack was the real king of the jungle, so accept no substitutes. Kreegah!
