	           Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince TS XVID - STG

	Yes you see a different group name.... Probably one that someone will get all crazy
	and go OMG!!! GGEEAHH!!! AHHH!!! KILL!!!! DIE!!! OMG!!!! and I say... you want 
	to see Harry Potter in good quality??? I bet you do! So here you go... grabbed it from
	a friend of mine, re-encoded it to improve the video quality and upload it to release to
	the scene. So enjoy and nuke this if you want... I could care less, I dont pride myself
	on grp stats nor do I care if you see the T word that everyone is so affraid of... Torrents
	are used all the time for Linux distos and open source applications. BUT!!! Lets be clear,
	this DID NOT COME from a illigal public torrent site, nor do i condone them or support them. 
	I personally HATE public torrent sites and HATE what they are about. So dont go getting
	your boxers in a bunch! This is a release just like any other... someone just actually tagged 
	the video. Dont think all of the other releases are not from places like torrent sites... I know 
	for a fact of a few groups who are currently actively releasing shit FROM torrent sites... 
				So go to hell!

			As i said... Enjoy the good qual release!

[color=blue]NOTES:[/color]
Right here's what we've been waiting for ......the bloody spanish video with some nice english 
audio....The video source is pretty good,has some faults..couple of focus issues but not many,colours
are a little whacked but the main problem was the video noise.....looked over sharpen,oh a  tad dark.
Video i was supplied with was really nice direct audio,there's some noise now and again....like a buzz,but 
nothing major :P


[color=blue]WORK DONE:[/color] 
Right was a ball ache....well syncing was.My new little german friend synced it all up but somehow there was something wrong
and it did match up....so had to shrink the audio in ssf to match video runtime :lol: we got there in the end anyway between us....
The video now it was dark so i increased lum and gamma slightly....i know the black doesn't look a true black but if i kept it like
that certain parts looked too dark and there was alot of scenes like that.
The main problem was the video noise so i needed to filter that first....
Also changed the rgb colours slightly and increased chroma a touch aswell.....yet again with the colouring there was many scenes that
had a black and white look to them....and when increasing chroma too much these scenes looked bad so i kind of found a medium and
stuck to that.
Also used a contour and sharpen filter aswell and croppd the bottom by 6 as there was a black line across it ....hence the different res.

Overall based on a TS V9 A9 M8.........One sweet TS and i think only a scr/r5 or above will beat this....yes there shall be more encodes and 
now doubt some really nice ones....Only fault i can pick myself is the colouring but too much makes alot of other scenes look wrong....after
all all the harry potters are quiet dark films ;-)

Future releases over the next few days
Public enemies new source 
my sisters keeper new source
ice age 3 new source


Ps PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD MY RELEASES IF YOU DON'T LIKE RE-ENCODES OR IF YOU THINK BY SOME
HOW ME RE-ENCODING THEM IS GOING TO MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE R5'S....BECAUSE THEY DON'T!!!!!
