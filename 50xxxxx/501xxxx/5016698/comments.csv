,2006denali,2009-11-01T03:28Z,Awesome! Thanks!! Navigation is flawless! Works perfect! Burned first try with ImgBurn. You do need to unrar the file first. I will seed this for a long time.
,LarryKingsShoes,2009-11-17T05:10Z,Thank you very much for seeding this! I didn't think I'd ever find this. :) I can't wait to try it out. I'll be seeding this one for quite a while. ;)
,suckitboston,2009-11-18T03:53Z,"I downloaded the file, and have been seeding. I cant figure out how to burn it and use it. I burnt it onto a DVD+R using IMGBurn but that didnt work. Could somebody please help me?"
,hisself,2009-11-24T20:41Z,"I have burned 5 DVD-R DL disks so far, using two different burners, and two different burn programs (including ImgBurn).  None will work in my 2005 Denali.  One worked for a few miles, but the next time I started the truck it said 'Unable to read'

Any thoughts???   PLEASE"
,jms727,2009-12-09T10:51Z,I downloaded the file un rar it but cant seem to burn properly. I used imgburn but have had no success with a dvd+r DL. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
,bonz11,2009-12-12T20:12Z,"I also downloaded, un-rared and burned on a DVD +R DL but it didn't work for me either.  Any suggestions?  Oh, I also downloaded ImgBurn and used that to burn the dvd."
