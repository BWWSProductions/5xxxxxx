Porter (Ashley Scott) and forced him into "12 Rounds" of dangerous games carefully plotted throughout the streets of New Orleans. 
Danny struggles to keep focus while the obvious ticking clocks and crude consequences that accompany each one of these 
"rounds" do their best to derail him from rescuing the love of his life before it's too late. The movie is 108 minutes long.

NOTE : I have tested this on the PS3 and it works fine.
I have noticed lots of nobs are posting fakes using my name only grab films from genuine SecretMyth, MajorTJKong and LifeChanger accounts or straight from the source
