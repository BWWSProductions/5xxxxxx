,krazykaraoke2,2009-07-21T13:08Z,thanks for the movie !! what do i need to convert this to dvd for tv viewing ??
,utptube,2009-07-21T14:23Z,"krazykaraoke2
convertxtodvd will do the job for you I think. But the purpose of secretmyth uploads are HD(1280x544) at low size and if you convert it to dvd you will lose the HD resolution and end up with 720x480(pal). 
So better get a player that supports mp4 and H264 encode for better viewing experience. WD HD TV player, ps3 or stream with pc to your TV with HDMI or dvi cables."

If you are ""one"" guy (or if you do actually encode some releases), could you send me a PM on Kingdom-KVCD?  Username The_Linyx, I've something quite nice to offer..."
