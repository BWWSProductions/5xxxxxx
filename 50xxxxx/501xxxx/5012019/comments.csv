,Haach,2009-07-22T12:05Z,"first thanks for the up
after mounting the bin with power ISO
running the set up
copying and pasting the crack
when i run th game 
i get the opening bit
but then all i see is three gears spinning
and nothing else happens any ideas?"
,p5yk0tik,2009-07-24T06:41Z,"@Haach: Same result here, using Daemon Tools 4.10. Have installed OpenAL and Physx. Have copied the crack over. Interesting that GameCopyWorld only lists the Vitality Crack (which does not work with this release). We must be missing something. I'm gonna try modifying the cm2.ini file."
,p5yk0tik,2009-07-24T07:05Z,"@Haach: Are you using an ATI Gfx card?
After installing PhysX 8.04.25 I still get this in the cm2.log file:
""[Error] PhysX: Unable to find the PhysX libraries. The PhysX drivers are not installed correctly.""
Looking at the PhysX ""Products Supported"" Page:
""GeForce 200-series, 100-series, 9-series, and 8-series GPUs (with minimum of 32 cores and a minimum of 256MB dedicated graphics memory)
AGEIA PhysX Processors (All)""
Guess that means ATI users a screwed.

Hrm.. Just did a big search on the 'net and have found that PhysX does not work on ATI gfx cards - and although there has been talk of getting it working, it has not happened - and most likely never will. The only way to play this game is with an Nvidia Gfx board.

This is an Nvidia-only game."

,hamidmp3,2009-09-25T08:45Z,"I confirm. as p5yk0tik said, this game doesn't work with ATI cards."
