Twilight: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack


Director Catherine Hardwicke revealed in an interview with MTV that a song by alternative rock band Muse, later revealed to be "Supermassive Black Hole", would be included on the film's soundtrack.[7] Hardwicke said that Muse may record a remix of the song to give it "a little bit of extra Twilight stuff to fit the scene". She also stated that two songs written and performed by Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward, would be included in the film as well.[8] The soundtrack also includes two songs by Paramore[3], with their new song "Decode" being the soundtrack's lead single, the debut of a new song by Mute Math from their forthcoming sophomore album, and a new original song for the film by Perry Farrell.[9] "Flightless Bird, American Mouth" by Iron & Wine was chosen for inclusion in the movie by star Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella Swan.[10] Noticeably absent from the soundtrack is "15 Step" by Radiohead, which plays as the movie ends and during the first half of the credits.
