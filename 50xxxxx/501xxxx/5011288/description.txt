A Short Film Musical Drama featuring Paul Kelly Kaarin Fairfax and Kelton Pell, Directed by Rachel Perkins. Based on the true story of a young girl who went missing in the Australian outback in 1932. Won numerous awards inluding AFI. This movie seams to be pretty rare so I thought I would rip my DVD copy. 

This download is intended to aid in study on this film mainly for high school students in the yr 11-12 English coriculim in Australia. I know when I did all the assignments on it I would of loved to have a copy of my own to rewatch. 

DivX coded. Running time about 55 minutes. Ripped and uploaded by BiGs.
