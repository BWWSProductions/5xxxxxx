,kiefspoon,2009-11-24T05:58Z,"Hi there,

The end part of Shine On Part II, was at the end of Welcome to the Machine as this is how the copies of the US quad copies were pressed (different to the UK where side 1 did end with Welcome to the Machine as normal, albeit in the different quad mix form).

Some refer to this as the 'secret track' at the end of side 2.

I don't actually know if this is a pressing 'error' or not, but it is definitely there, as I own a US quad copy. It is not on any other quad I have (UK, Australian, NZ etc).

If anybody has any further info about it, I - and I'm sure others, as well! - would be grateful to hear about it.

A strange one... !"

,Godbluffer,2010-08-09T01:28Z,"Impressive job you did with the EQ-tweaking.  It doesn't *sound* tweaked at all, which is of course exactly as it should be.  And the quad-mix itself is nothing less than a revelation.  So much more spacious, e.g. the vocal parts in 'Welcome to the Machine' and many of the synthesizer effects that tended to sound a bit blunt in the stereo mix really blossom here.  I think the highlight is the closing 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', sounding airier now and the mix itself gels far more convincingly and magically than in stereo.  This one's a real winner!"
