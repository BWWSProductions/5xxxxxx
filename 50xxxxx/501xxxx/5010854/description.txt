Mnemic Videography DVD - [NTSC]

Here are 5 video's by Metal band "MNEMIC".

I have converted each video from 4:3 (TV standard) format back to it's true 16:9 (widescreen) format and created a custom DVD with simple menu.

The original "LIQUID" video taken from "Monsters of Metal VOL 2" had a bad fault in it which I have cleaned up and made perfect again. 

I HAVE UPLOADED A [PAL] VERSION ALSO.
