,jethro84,2010-10-12T16:49Z,"Torrent works fine! Thank you 'Crazypu' and TNTvillage :) 

Only problem for me is: 
Using Nero 10, I am not able to burn it to a BluRay 25GB disc (project is about 100MB bigger..) 
So.. is there any way to overburn the disc or any other solution? 
I wouldnât like burning a 50 GB disc, if of course I could avoid it.. 

Cheers."
,kidjersey,2010-12-15T21:44Z,"Forget about burning discs. Buy a 2gb wd green drive for under $100, Fill it with full bluray rips, watch with totalmedia theatre v3 . enjoy"
,nemosrings,2011-05-30T05:34Z,"jethro84 sounds like your Nero is attempting to re-encode the video. A no-no. You have chosen wrong options in burn settings I'd imagine.
This is a BluRay disk of course it's going to be bigger than a DVD. lol
VLC can usually play bluray.
Thanks to the host uploader."
,jethro84,2011-06-03T01:14Z,"nemosrings: Obviously you misunderstood my comment..

Here we go again:

,tenkre1,2011-08-19T12:58Z,can you please convert this to MKV or tell me how to please CRAZYPU

,Wolfpacker96,2011-10-03T23:28Z,And VLC can not play a blu-ray directly.  Must have Cyberlink PowerDVD or similar.  Can convert it to mkv and watch in VLC.
