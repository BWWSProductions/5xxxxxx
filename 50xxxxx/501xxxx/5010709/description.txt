This is a very important show.  Not only does it return to the haunting male vocal trance that drew me into this music in the first place, but the electro-house movement is taking charge and the first half of this set really celebrates it. 

Kicking it off is Marco V and his crucial track Unprepared.  I was unprepared for feeling completely debilitated when I first heard this and after looking up the lyrics it still moves me greatly. I havn't figured out who does the vocals but doesn't it kinda sound like the guy from She Wants Revenge?

The next track is a perfect counterpart  and the electro buzzes in with DJ Shaolin, Deadmau5 and Robb feat. Freeland.
No sim card, no disco lol.

Not to be outdone, it's Kelly Rowland on a really great version of the David Guetta track. Who knew she could sing? They performed this song live on So You Think You Can Dance the other night. It was, well, live
Then it's a return trip home with a Spencer And Hill remix of the quintessential Paul Van Dyk track and Anguilla Project.
Rounding out the back is the soothing and powerful Nic Chagall track featuring Jonathan Mendelsohn, who may or may not be the poor man's Christian Burns.


Thanks for listening and please help me seed!

I've watched the ball that comes and go
Still I'm unprepared for you"
