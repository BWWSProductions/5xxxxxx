,paabus,2009-07-19T07:23Z,must think we are retards its not that easy and the audio files are different to match the cuts  made in the videos as Ive tried so if you did best wishes too you
,darkko,2009-07-19T08:18Z,"wtf? are you tards kidding me? i appreciate the effort and all, but this cam is really shitty. the picture is super dark and the audio is low and almost impossible to decipher. 

always great when the cam has auto focus on. idiots.

,Verkew,2009-07-19T10:34Z,"Stop spamming that comment on every Harry Potter cam video darkko. This is probably the best version out so far, it's got the video quality of the spanish cam (which is good) and the audio is english so it's watchable."
,rushXx,2009-07-19T13:34Z,does the audio line up throughout the movie?
,loulou81,2009-07-19T16:36Z,"Goes out of sync about 40 mins in, can be synced manually in VLC as playing but pita to do. Haven't been able to find another though, this is def best quality with english audio. "
,dermie1234,2009-07-19T18:18Z,Is there anyway of blocking that cunt darkko's post's. Every single one the same. You are a wanker of the highest order. Loulou81 will nandub synch it.
