Book Description
================
From 1968 to the early 1970s, the self-styled "Zodiac" killer made headlines 
in the San Francisco Bay Area. In random attacks, he is known to have 
murdered six persons; in a series of letters to newspapers, which sometimes 
included cryptograms, he boasted of many more. To this day, the infamous 
case remains unsolved and surprisingly little has been written about 
it. Graysmith, a San Francisco Chronicle staff member, was obsessed 
with the case from the beginning and he has continued to investigate 
it as an amateur sleuth. Except for "Zodiac" himself, the author now 
knows more about the case than anyone. In this full, chronological account, 
which will fascinate true crime readers, he speculates about the most 
likely suspect.

"SHE WAS YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT NOW SHE IS BATTERED AND DEAD. SHE IS 
NOT THE FIRST AND SHE WILL NOT BE THE LAST." Few cases in the history 
of true crime are as colorful and intriguing as that of Zodiac, the 
bizarre gunman in an executioner's hood who hunted the streets of San 
Francisco in the late 1960s and sent dozens of taunting letters to the 
police. Robert Graysmith provides ample details about the police investigation, 
including the full text and photos of most of the letters. Zodiac is 
an excellent starting point not only for the casual reader, but also 
for those interested in retracing the author's steps in order to pursue 
their own ideas about who the killer may have been. This book has been 
praised by the San Francisco Chronicle, the very paper in which the 
Zodiac's eerie messages and cryptograms were published: "Graysmith's 
taut narrative brings the horror back with jolt upon jolt."
