"Finally!  After 2 months of hard work and design, the 2010 version of Death and Taxes is finally released and available to purchase.

The page is here, http://www.wallstats.com/deathandtaxes/

I must say I was very excited to get this project finished because it wasnâ€™t just the same old Bush administration budget this year.  This is Obamaâ€™s first official budget.  This is his plan for the future, beyond the headlines, beyond the press releases.  The federal budget is where the true story, once the rhetoric falls away.

So I encourage you all to look over the poster, enjoy it, and if you feel inclined, purchase a poster.  Sales of the poster are what allows me to take the two months required each year to research, create and design this poster.

If you are a blogger or just feel like getting the word out, I have some resources and images to help below.   This is DIY government oversight.  Important information, that should be required for every responsible citizen, or people who just love info-porn."

Please consider buying a poster of this if you like the idea of the project or want to support the author of the work.



Enjoy, and seed please!
