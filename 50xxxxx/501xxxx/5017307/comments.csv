I'm sorry but i don't have a sample.

Why is the .avi file so large: hmm...let's see ProfessorSocks...
Resolution: 1056x432
Video Bitrate: 5250 kbps
Does that answer your question ?"
,cobra666_millenium,2009-07-24T09:40Z,"You are welcome, Professor Socks...

I forgot to answer your last question: yes endded, the source for this is the DDC [Digital Distribution Copy]"
,cobra666_millenium,2009-07-24T09:41Z,* endeed
,theone_nr,2009-07-25T07:47Z,"@cobra666_millenium tell me something please , its reencoded after the DDC source ? do you have the original DDC ?"
,cobra666_millenium,2009-07-25T09:47Z,"@theone_nr
No, it's not reencoded after the original DDC, but trust me, that this is by far the best copy of DDC.
Just download it, and see for your self that you won't be disappointed..."
,the_fatman76,2009-07-27T03:02Z,hi cobra666 is this the actual full movie?
,cobra666_millenium,2009-07-27T19:28Z,"Yes the_fatman76, this is the actual full movie.

""RUNTiME : 1 hour 46 minutes 38 seconds""

+ that the video quality will not disappoint you.

Trust me !!! "
,john-rickman,2009-07-30T20:13Z,"Quality is EXCELENT you will need a DVD9 to write(burn) it on 
Audi is not 5.5 but Cobra does not claim it to be. shame not 5.5, but quality is ver high"
,Sleppmegin,2009-07-30T23:19Z,But no eng subs it seems :\ 2 bad
,cobra666_millenium,2009-07-30T23:51Z,"Yes john-rickman, I know that the audio quality is a lil' bit poor,as you can see, I told the_fatman76, that the video quality will not disappoint him, and no bragging about the audio quality :D

And sorry Sleppmegin, as it says in my torrent's description: Romanian Subtitles, not English Subtitles i'm sorry. :( "
,pumara,2009-07-31T10:42Z,"Cobra, u should be ashamed with this DVDR. Now I realise that a 4 GB movie do not means that it is  one with good audio and video. My rate: A=6, V=6.

As a movie addict, am I difficult?"
,cobra666_millenium,2009-08-02T19:05Z,"Yeap...pumara...you really are difficult...
I mean: Audio:6 ...ok...i know the audio isn't that great...but Video:6 ...come on ...you're a little picky, don't you tink ?"

,bogwart,2009-08-03T13:33Z,"In all the years I've been downloading stuff this is easily the biggest pile of dogshit I've ever wasted bandwidth on.

It is a single AVI - no rars - and I would give it 1/10 for audio and 1/10 for video.  In fact it's unwatchable - I deleted it within minutes of first checking it.

DVD-R is a lie, plain and simple.  It is a cam, and a cam of zero quality.  It might go down well in Romania but Cobra666 should be impaled on a large stick and be eaten by the ghoulies for pretending this is anything other than total crap."
,cobra666_millenium,2009-08-03T18:52Z,"No bogwart, you should be impaled on a large stick and be eaten by the ghoulies ... for saying such crap: Video 0 out of ten...
In this case, Blu-Ray Quality for you, on a scale from zero to ten, would probably be: one, one and a half maximum.
And no, the source is the DDC ( wide screen, excelent video quality, and yes i have to admit that even though is stereo sound, the audio quality isn't that great: 5,5 - 6 )"
,Jeremybradley25,2009-08-04T15:16Z,"Cobra can you hear it on regular dvd player, I am not all that picky; I just want this great movie. And can you find Nightmare on the 13th Floor? It's an axe-murderer type movie thnx if u can."
,cobra666_millenium,2009-08-04T16:48Z,"Well JeremyBradley ... about your question regarding the regular DVD Players...I don't know what to say: On a DVD Player Panasonic DVD-S33E-K, there weren't any problems with hearing or seeing, but one of my neighbours has a DVD Player Samsung P171, and he only got the sound on his player, but no video... and both DVD Players are cheap, regular ones.
So...I don't know exactly what to tell you...I ope my answer clarified your question.

And now, about: ""Nightmare on 13th floor""...i'll notify you here if/when i'll upload it here on TPB."
,the_fatman76,2009-08-07T06:45Z,"hi cobra 666 I would just like to say that I have a crappy $39 DVD player I bought from crazy clarks a year and a half ago and a sony stereo that has great sound and bass and I thought it was great to watch thanks. 
And to all who bag cobra666, get fucked "
,cobra666_millenium,2009-08-07T16:13Z,"thank you the_fatman76, for your kind words regarding my movie's quality.
"
,Crisco_Land,2009-10-08T17:30Z,"Good job Cobra, but I have to say that the quality claims you made are misleading. It is better quality than a standard movie (700mb) but not by much. Also, the size of the video is not very large, so when blown-up the quality disintegrates to that of a standard movie. THe only problem is that the movie is 3.88 GiB and you can download a large size, HD movie for that much space. Personally I think the the HD is the better bet. Sorry :("
,JohnnyGhost,2009-10-26T01:23Z,"Hey, this Movie looked Great! The Sound needed the Bass turned down a bit, but it sounded good also.
V= 9 (little choppy at times)
A= 8
Fully enjoyed the Flick.
Thanks Cobra!"
,cobra666_millenium,2009-10-31T17:08Z,"You are welcome, JohnnyGhost !

I'm glad you appreciate my version of ""Terminator Salvation"""
,cobra666_millenium,2009-10-31T17:11Z,"Of Course HD is better Crisco_Land ...

You can't expect a 5250 kbps Video Bitrate to be better than a 10000 kbps HD Video bitrate ... Right ? "
