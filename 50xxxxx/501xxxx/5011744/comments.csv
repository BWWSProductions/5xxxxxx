[T],FatFreddy756,2009-09-26T21:33Z,"@ phantazmo

your unzipping it wrong. Use the latest 7-zip or use the 7-zip beta to unzip it properly. Usually winRAR and winZip wont extract the .7z files right"

---------------------------------------
At the end of this week I am stepping down from the gordsmash title and giving it to my pal. I want to thank everyone for supporting gordsmash and uploading my torrents to keep them alive! I hoped that everyone of you has enjoyed my torrents! I want to thank all of you for supporting me! Thank you all and goodbye!"
,mangoa,2010-04-11T13:41Z,thank you VERY much! :)
,TheCrucifier,2011-01-09T04:51Z,"thank you for the upload mate. That speed was slick. WinRar didnt extract it properly so Had to use Win-7. If you get an error with winzip or winrar, dont blame the torrent. Just use Win-7 or something like it. Cheers"
,Dragunovk,2012-01-11T23:05Z,"Just clicked ""Download this torrent"" but I already want to thank you for the torrent! :)"
