[T],ripthejacker420,2009-07-23T03:25Z,i re-created this torrent because i was unable to reseed the original torrent. the only difference with this torrent is that i did not RAR the files. now you can view the individual files and select individuals if you need. enjoy
[T],ripthejacker420,2009-07-23T03:28Z,"if you are unable to finish the old torrent then download this one since i can now seed this particular torrent. again, i cannot seed the old torrent anymore but i left it available since people are still accessing it"

alot of these keygens and cracks have been added to antivirus/malware lists but i think it's just to try and stop people from using them. however, i use avast! free antivirus and it doesn't detect the crack. i'm not sure if my answer helps but i haven't noticed any extreme problems after i installed this game. i've had it now for over a year =) no problems here"
