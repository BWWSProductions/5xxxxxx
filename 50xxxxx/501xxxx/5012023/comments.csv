1)  Each activation tool needs to be run as ""Administrator"" - Right-click --> Run as administrator

2)  Activator 1.5 and Toolkit 1.8 use ""frankenbuild"" methods, which use hacks to inject RC code/keys and activate them, hence the possible addition of expiration dates (run WINVER)

3)  TimerNuke nukes the activation pieces altogether, so activation status stays at ""unknown""

4)  ALL activation hacks should be considered temporary, as Microsoft deploys countermeasures against them - YMMV

5)  Doubful anything will be permanent (unless you don't update your OS and keep it off Internet)...OEM methods will have the best chance at success"

,byzantium54,2009-08-03T00:16Z,"WINDOWS 7 BUILDS CAN BE UPGRADED TO RTM!!!!!! READ BELOW...this is from www.zdnet.com....

Microsoft really, really, really doesn?t want you to install the Windows 7 Release Candidate or RTM code over an existing installation of the Windows 7 beta (or over any interim builds, for that matter or RTM). The result is a beta-over-beta installation that could exhibit odd behaviors that a customer installing the final version of Windows 7 would never confront. Not only that, but any feedback you send in via the automated tools built into Windows 7 is mostly useless for identifying problems in the final build.

So, as a result, the RC blocks upgrades over any build earlier than 7077. If you?ve been running the original beta (Build 7000) and you try to upgrade, you?ll see an error message.

But if you insist on doing the upgrade anyway, there?s a workaround. Start by copying the entire contents of the Windows 7 DVD to a local folder (use a bootable USB drive, or create a folder in the root of the drive you?re planning to upgrade, and then run Setup from that location).

In the folder you just created, open the Sources subfolder and then open the file Cversion.ini in a text editor like Notepad.

Change the MinClient value (highlighted in yellow above) to 7000 and save the file in the same location with the same name.

You can now run Setup without being bothered by the version check."

,anarchy41,2009-08-20T08:39Z,Should I uninstall or format my HD that is currently the RC1 7100 build of Win7 64 bit? to install this version? or can I just upgrade? what is the best course of action?
,gards,2009-08-21T02:51Z,"I would like to know why this version will not shut down!  Thanks for the software etc but why will it not shut down like normal? Is this a know issue?

thx "
,kilerzkof,2009-08-26T05:29Z,"I downloaded this And Got the Following error: ""Windows could not collect information for [osImage] since the specified image file [install.wim] does not exist."" Im not saying this is a bad torrent but i did receive this error and i have made probably 7 + dvds using slow and fast burn speeds on a different (new computers) computers. Anyone know how to fix this?"
,gards,2009-08-30T01:17Z,"LE Toney

It's not the activator, that comes with the torrent and works fine.  It's an issue i'm having when shutting down it hangs, I thought it might be my soundcard drivers.  Either way i'm reinstalling to OS cause if i can't shut down the PC properly there is no point in having this!

I realise it's only my problem though, most seem to be able to use it without this EXTREMELY annoying bug that I/my software has created."
,Zupra2k,2009-09-09T19:15Z,What is the difference between this RTM version and the RC version (Build 7100) that could be downloaded directly from Microsoft?
,Grenadeh,2009-09-12T08:51Z,"Ooh! Neat! I got one of those COMPLETE bullshit errors : Cannot find device drivers for CD/DVD drive. Okay, even though the last two public beta's of W7 had the proper drivers on the install media, I'm expected to believe they suddenly vanished. Good job MS, you still suck. "
,bwfc123,2009-09-16T21:47Z,"THIS IS NOT THE RETAIL VERSION, Microsoft released several hotfix installers a month ago, maybe longer ago that updated the windows version to 16399 and not 16385."

Can one select the version of Windows 7 they want to install?

I want to upgrade to 64-bit, but dont want Ultimate Edition, only Home Premium. The previous 32-bit ""Ultimate"" disc i had allowed me to select the version prior to installation."
,roumanobr,2009-12-07T19:53Z,"Hey Le_Toney, OR ANY1, PLZ HELP ME.

,florgflorg,2009-12-14T04:46Z,I am currently running vista x64 and want to do an upgrade to 7 cuz i'm sick of vista.  Is THIS version going to reformat my HD or are my files going to be fine?
,THX_1138,2009-12-20T00:46Z,"@roumanobr
If it's not booting from the dvd you should make sure that your bios is set to boot from your cd/dvd rom drive first. During the boot process keep your eye on the screen. It could prompt you to push a key to boot from the cd/dvd rom drive as in my case it flashes for about 2 or 3 seconds. Depends on your bios."
,7lover,2009-12-24T10:58Z, does this really work
,larsaaby94,2009-12-25T01:26Z,"I dl'd this, and tried to install it on my Computer, but after the installation loads done (after ""Starting Windows"" shows up) it shows me the lightblue background, the DVD loads for like 5 seconds, then nothing else happens.
the wizard doesn't show up :S
hellp?"
,countzero1942,2010-01-02T18:40Z,"To the guy who gets the screen on boot up, then nothing happens: 

That happened to me when I had a hard drive that had a copy of Windows on it - and I was using the System Builder version of Windows 7. I removed the hard drive (and had another blank one I was going to install on) and the setup program started up ok. So delete/recreate the partition or remove all traces of Windows from the hard drive first."
,countzero1942,2010-01-07T14:41Z,Update on screen doing nothing... Did another sys where the screen did nothing. I just left it running for 5 or 10 minutes and the dialog box eventually came up. The next setup screen had the same problem. This was on a quad core sys too. Weird.
,VamSin,2010-01-23T11:17Z,can you upload that serial key on filefactory dot com and share the link plz. i m in uk and that sharecash link is not valid for UK.

,jimbobhuxley,2010-03-06T21:34Z,"I installed this on 2/28, and all was well until 3/4 when I started getting nags to activate. I used the included activator but it failed saying that the product ID had reached its limit (I forget the exact wording).  However, now when I run winver, it says that this is an Evaluation Copy, expiring on 3/1/2010, and it's shutting down my computer every 2 hours. 

Isn't this supposed to be the RTM (like the name says)?  And has anyone else run into this problem? I finally got everything reinstalled, and I'd hate to have to start over."
,jimbobhuxley,2010-03-06T23:04Z,"PS - Upon manually installing Windows updates, 13 of the 17 available updates failed, saying ""Failure Configuring Windows Updates, Reverting Changes..."", and just also failed on 2 out of 5 optional updates (drivers, mainly)"

,salahuddin1,2010-03-15T08:46Z,"well the crack doesnt work...this is the third time im isntalling this, because i jsut figured out that toolkit 1.8 fuckes it up. after i use toolkit and it restars the pc, and when the pc tries to load it it jsut restars again, and it jsut keeps going. then when i do the troubleshoot it tells me to restore, when it restores it tries to load windows again, but this time a blue screen comes up saying dumping memory to disk. so any other ways of activating it?

besides that great torrent, windows works perfectly, and fast download! will be seeding! except someone please help with my issue lol..."
,salahuddin1,2010-03-15T09:41Z,"well i jsut tried the new loader, and option one works only if i dont restart..... so when i use option one, and it says reboot pc, before rebooting i chcked the system and it said windows is activated, then i rebooted and checked again, and it said you have 30 days trial left...any solutions?"
,biogenesiss,2010-03-17T02:04Z,"I downloaded this and thought about installing it but i realized that because it's such a new OS, successfully cracking it will be nothing but a headache and nearly impossible, Honestly i don't know what i was thinking by downloading it. I'm sure it's a good torrent but i believe my above statements remain true. Don't waste your time cause likely ppl wont get much help with these types of torrents from the uploaders."
