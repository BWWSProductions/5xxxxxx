     Plants VS Zombies is a puzzle/strategy game from PopCap, similar to a tower defense genre. The object is to protect your home from invading zombies using a very large array of plant friends. (Hence the title, Plants VS Zombies.) It's incredibly addictive, and overall, one of the most popular, and fun, games PopCap has ever created. There are instructions in the torrent...as if you need any.

Have fun, and make sure to seed!
