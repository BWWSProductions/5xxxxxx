,Strupstad,2009-09-04T07:16Z,"You only have to download the jaikoz.txt file, as this method works with the new (3.2.2) version as well.
File - Install Full Licence and select the jaikoz.txt file :)"
,Strupstad,2009-09-04T07:16Z,The new version is available on the authors homepage of course. Google is your friend!
,iden32,2010-02-03T01:54Z,serial does not work with newest version! they use a different file now...
,anonymous007,2010-02-24T22:52Z,Anyone found key for 3.4.0 already?
,qurst,2010-05-04T13:37Z,"This download is more or less useless now, theyve changed the license keys they use to connect to the online stuff, and the olds one now dont work"
,Babylon42,2011-11-14T22:28Z,"Just disconnect from the internet and this will still work, I have WinAso Registry Optimizer and I have to do the same thing, true you can't get updates but it still works perfectly, I just hope this works the same as WinAso."
