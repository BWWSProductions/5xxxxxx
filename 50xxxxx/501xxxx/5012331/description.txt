In this sequel to the hugely successful Born Free, George an Joy Adamson (Nigel Davenport and Susan Hampshire) discover that Elsa (the prize lioness they nurtured successfully to the wild years before) has died, leaving three cubs to fend for themselves. George and Joy once again take the young lions under their wing to see that they safely grow to maturity. Like it's predecessor, the movie was filmed on location in Kenya.
