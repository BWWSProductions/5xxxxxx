As this is one of my favourite films ever, i took extra care of it.
I hope you guys are satisfied with the result, let me know.

I used the 2-disc Special Edition as my source.

" 2.35:1 aspect ratio with an anamorphic transfer. Digitally remastered, Darius Khondji's cinematography receives full justice.
Sharpness and detail are excellent throughout the presentation, with a depth to the picture at times that is pretty remarkable.
This transfer underwent extensive remastering, and it definitely shows. Fincher's original vision for the film is preserved perfectly. "

I muxed the DTS sound stream, intact from the DVD. DTS-ES (Extended Surround), 6.1 discrete channels.

"New Line has also remastered the sound, the audio has been reprocessed into a true 6.1 channel mix (DTS ES 6.1)
The level of detail within the mix, even down to the tiniest of detail, is mixed to perfection.
The new audio mix extensively utilizes directional effects throughout the film with the surround channels being used continuously.
The subwoofer channel is heavily used throughout to support the score as well as effects such as gunshots."
