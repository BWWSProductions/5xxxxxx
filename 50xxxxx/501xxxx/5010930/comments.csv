All of You, having problems with this torrent: be sure to follow the instructions correctly, eg: if there's a chain: install->crack->run then it is something completely different then install->run from installation checkbox->close->crack->whine"

2. Alcohol is better then Daemon Tools for some reasons"
,eslindsey,2009-11-17T08:25Z,"Worked like a charm on the first try, by following the directions exactly. The rest of the comments are correct: I had to run the Alcohol program AFTER installing--as in every time you want to use it--as an administrator for it to succeed. This is made easier by either disabling UAC, or by changing the properties of the file and checking Run as Administrator.

,red_spyder,2009-11-25T06:29Z,Just downloaded it in 5 seconds. Thanks muryucu
,JonxAllen23,2009-12-03T20:49Z,@Kartoon59.  really  it almost gave you a virus?  thats funny because i have successfully downloaded and installed. works 100% perfect for me.. and im using windows 7 ultimate.  why dont i have a virus???    thanks man nice upload =]
,BitMalik,2009-12-07T11:49Z,"Downloaded and installed this and it actually worked, to my surprise. I had downloaded another torrent claiming to have this same crack and that file didn't work, but this crack did (and I didn't even have to set it to run as admin, but I have UAC at the minimum level so I guess that's why). Thank you!"

,blah6,2009-12-11T09:55Z,could it be you are on windows 7 which alcohol didn't support back then?
,prophy,2009-12-12T18:26Z,This Torrent doesnt work under Win7 64bit.
,bob12970,2009-12-16T09:38Z,"@ kernelleonessar.

Yes, I have the same problem too. I find that if you run the program as the administrator you would get Alcohol 120 to start working. Sometimes it also freezes up during startup of Alcohol 120 after when the crack is applied and I am not too sure why. I am thinking has to do with Alcohol 120 connecting to the internet for updates maybe. "
