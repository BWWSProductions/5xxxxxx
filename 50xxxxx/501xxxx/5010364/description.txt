AS LONG AS I LIVE  (Johnny Cash / Emmylou Harris)
-----------------

As long as I live
if it be one hour
or if it be
one hundred years

I'll keep remembr'ing
forever and ever
I love you dear
as long as I live

It was easy said
that night we parted
that we forget
we ever met

I haven't forgotten
I wonder if you had
or if your heart
still's full of regret

As long as I live
if it be one hour
or if it be
one hundred years

I'll keep remembr'ing
forever and ever
I love you dear
as long as I live

/piano break/

Oh, I never thought
that night we parted
that life alone 
would be oh so sad

I know it sounds funny
but I'll never forget you
you're the only joy
I ever had

As long as I live
if it be one hour
or if it be
one hundred years

I'll keep remembr'ing
forever and ever
I love you dear
as long as I live

I love you dear
as long as I live
