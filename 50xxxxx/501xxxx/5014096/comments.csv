Bad Santa
Meet the Robinsons 
Da Vinci Code
Hope you download them.
One question... what is the numerical value you use to lock the files under 4.00GB? I use 4096 which is meant to be the max but the file size after converting comes out as 3.85GB"
,lordofthebong,2009-07-21T20:11Z,"And now brothers, if you would turn to the Book of Bricktop in your prayer guides...

Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.

And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, Bricktop, thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

For who in the heavens can be compared unto Bricktop? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto Him? 

And more of these saints came forth, made in His image. Akamaru, son of Hersephetes, and Swordfish, son of Swordfish Sr., and they shared their seeds with the congregation.

And Bricktop said ""Let all who share their bounties on Earth, shall forever be known as Saints. And these Saints will be blessed by many""

To all the Saints, I thank you.

For thine is the bluray, the ps3, and the glory
forever and ever, Amen."
