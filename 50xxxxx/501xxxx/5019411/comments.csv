,laned130,2011-05-29T13:15Z,"Anyone looking for this album can find it on Google. I would have uploaded it to TPB, but it's a private torrent, and I can't see any reason to split the swarms.

Also, on March 2, 2011, Nalick announced her new album ""Broken Doll and Odds and Ends"" to be released May 2011. I'll try to remember to post a link here when I find a copy ;-)"
