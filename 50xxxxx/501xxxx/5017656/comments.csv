,don6876,2009-08-14T10:49Z,"Attention! This torrent is cool 'n all - downloads superfast, works good BUT it does NOT contain Project 2007. That was all I was interested in so I'm a bit bummed. I also didn't see Visio 2007 or Sharepoint designer in the folder either. Am I going blind? Did anybody else have this problem? Cheers Anyway,
Don."
