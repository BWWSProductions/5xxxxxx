Edmund Campion was a Jesuit priest who defied the Tudor state's protestant orthodoxy.

He was captured in 1581 and after being hideously tortured in the Tower of London he was sentenced to death. He died on December 1, 1581 at Tyburn. Subsequently
he was beatified. A grisley footnote is that the ropes used in his quartering were retained and each year are placed on the altar at the mass celebrating his feast day.

This play views England's Catholic-Protestant divide through the eyes of the poet cleric John Donne.
