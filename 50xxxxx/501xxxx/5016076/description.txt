Muse's United States of Eurasia + Collateral Damage outro, 320kbps mp3:

This single is from album "The Resistance" which is scheduled for release on 14th September 2009.

Info from musewiki:
A song featuring stringed instrumentation reminiscent of the Lawrence of Arabia soundtrack by Maurice Jarre and falsetto vocals reminiscent of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, as well as embodying influence from FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin. "United States of Eurasia" ends with the sound similar to that of a missile launching.

I will definately be buying this album the day it comes out! +1 quality if you like. seed and enjoy :)
