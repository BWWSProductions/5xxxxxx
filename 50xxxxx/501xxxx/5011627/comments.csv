,saph27,2009-07-22T00:58Z,"@MyKingdomHeart
I would think they use the .nfo instead of just .txt because ASCII art is easier to read when viewed in the browser as html. Also, they dont use .html files because, well, .NFO is like saying theres info in the file, so the reader may be more likely to click on it...
just my thoughts haha."

,MageOfTyr,2009-07-22T12:50Z,"@mcqnick
Use WinAmp (http://www.winamp.com/)
Or VLC Media Player (www.videolan.org/vlc/)

Both have alot better codecs for AVI NTSC videos and probably will serve you alot better, safe, free and you'll never need to download a codec again.

Or if you really want to play it in WMP, http://www.codecguide.com/ for the K-Lite to play it in."

Yes, you can see much of the picture much of the time, but it is blurry, and very very dark. The sound is pretty decent, tho a bit muddy - maybe 6 or 7 out of 10 grading on a curve. If you haven't seen it in the theater and are hoping to find a 'miracle' cam (/screener) version, this really ain't it - unless you're completely desperate to see it....In which case, this is probably the best available at the moment. 

Still tho, thx for the up, cgaura - definitely appreciated!"

I saw this movie on opening night in theaters and also thought it was the worst of the movies so far.  I can't understand how it is getting such critical praise on some reviews.  The effects are quite impressive, but the  movie just felt overall ""empty"" to me.  I just couldn't get wrapped up in it like the others.

It is there simply for enjoyment by people with imagination (kids and adults who havent had their imagination brainwashed away by society).  If it isn't your cup of tea, that's cool.  Not everyone likes to watch movies that only deal with the harsh reality of the real world.  We get enough of that in every day life.  "

--------------------------------------------------------
After I had downloaded this one I had contacted my ISP to see why they had shut my connection off,it seems that they got an unfriendly letter for copyright infringements. 

All in all they said I needed to delete the file witch I did. So yea Warner Bothers are looking in to this file.  

So for Americans I would say to try and mask your IP the best that you can and use Peerguardian or something like that if your gonna DL this one."
,-Dedrik-,2009-07-29T02:59Z,"Also it is a breech of privacy for them to do such so its more of a scare tactic when they contact your ISP. They wouldn't bother with me,but if they did try and sue it would be my ISP and not me getting sued. Also if it was me there would be numerous counter lawsuits I could make,so they wouldn't really last any time in the Big room. 

Thats why they don't bother with little fish like us and the fact that nearly every one with a computer downloads torrents like these would pretty much render it useless to sue people like us/me because who do you think the jury would side with? The one guy that dicided to download a movie because he saw it in theaters and wanted to see it again or the Corpate assholes that are hounding the one guy because he didn't want to pay to see a movie he already payed to see?

Lol the jury would say not guilty and then I would be able to rain a number of lawsuits and counter lawsuits back at them."

,thestrangestick,2009-08-14T02:11Z,"This is just a comment on the quality of the actual movie itself - if you are a fan, don't bother, I wasn't going to see this because they always rape the plot wide open but my friends took me and its just apalling, avoid if you want to prevent your brain from trickling out of your ear. To add insult to injury, this shitty film was gathering dust a year before they released it - they delayed it to make more money so download this as much as you can and NEVER pay for this film.
Arr-harr me mateys :D"
[T],stanky1219,2009-08-14T02:13Z,anybody in the tampa florida area using verizon needs to stay away from this torrent. my sister just got a copyright infringment email warning her about downloading this movie. no fines or charges but she did get a warning. so be very careful downloading this movie.
,mgdeath02,2009-08-16T03:53Z,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!! I fell asleep halfway of the film... MAn.. Fuck You Harry Fuck U!!!
,end0fdayz,2009-08-17T03:32Z,"To flipnrob & Unsign (about your Demonoid invite requests): I will gladly send you demonoid invites, but for security & privacy reasons, I will only send invites to an email address using the email host at mailinator d0t c0m.

Unlike most email hosts, mailinator doesn't reveal IPs in the source code.

As long as your email addy *ends in the mailinator domain* (for example, ""johnnydoe at mailinator d0t c0m""), I will send you an invite.  Sorry for the requirement, but it's necessary for protection.

I will also send invites to piratebay's SlopsBox email host -- but a little warning: when I tested it recently, the emails I sent from one account to my SlopsBox account never showed up.

Back in the day, PirateBay used to have private messaging, and I sent many invites that way. I really miss that. Since TPB discontinued it, finding the next best alternative to messaging between members has been a pain."
,iShare4u,2009-08-17T03:51Z,"@ mordeliush: We understood you the FIRST time you wrote it. Why take up valuable space repeating the same fucking spam?!?!

@ umplunk: Dude. There is no such thing as viewing ANYTHING online without using your bandwidth.

The moment your computer downloads even a byte of data -- TA DA!! -- your bandwidth is being used to do it!

We download local copies because we like to have files we can view that aren't dependent upon revisiting websites.

Shove your advertising spam up your ass."
,B0beau,2009-08-17T11:40Z,I need a Demonoid. So i am willing to pay $10USD to the first person to send one to b0beau.forum@gmail.com along with there paypal email address will get $10
,end0fdayz,2009-08-18T06:19Z,"@ B0beau: Why would you offer to buy a Demonoid invite when I said I would give it for free?? Your ""offer"" is fishy at best. 

First of all, Demonoid bans those who sell invites. Secondly, if you really wanted a demonoid invite, you would've created an account at PirateBay's free email host, which I mentioned here, and left your email address.

I hope people know that you're just ""phishing"" for users' information via paypal, (though PayPal obscures users' and senders' bank accounts, it DOES show both parties REAL FIRST AND LAST NAME in the transaction history).

So fuck your pretentious spam and fuck your attempt to gather user ID!

I hope you're from all warez sites!"
