,TheEmpathicEar,2009-07-20T22:21Z,"You are complimenting yourself? Anyway, maybe you could recommend Anydvd rather than DVD43. Anydvd is updated regulary and works well with CloneDVD?"
[T],jmb2012,2009-07-20T22:46Z,"Yes I am Dick!! I'm just like you I try shit out!!!
But I share it If I wan't to compliment myself I will.
DVD43 works fine with everything I've tried it with so no, I will not recommend anything but what I have put up myself."
,Balthazar7,2009-07-21T05:15Z,"jmb2012,
Don?t let these morons press your buttons. Your work is always excellent!
There will always be people getting something for nothing and bitch about it.
Thank-you for your uploads: if you should decide to move away from TPB due to upcoming changes please let us know where you are moving too. "
[T],jmb2012,2009-07-21T05:25Z,Why Thank You!! You know I'm not even sure what's going on with tpb. I will most likely go to mininova or 1337x
