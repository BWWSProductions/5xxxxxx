Last year I released new paper scans of CAPTAIN AMERICA 5, 7, 8, 65 and 76.
All are sharp new scans from original paper source, 
and are included in this torrent.
Probably the best scans ever made of Timely Cap comics,
They were made by an anonymous scanner who prefers to stay in the shadows. 


Many of the fiche files uploaded in this torrent have been color corrected.
Usually the fiche files are too dark images and the original colors are altered or missing. 
I have found a simple way to correct for the dark shadows at least, 
and I post here the brightened image files in cbz format. 
A mask sharping has been applied in some cases. 
A part of the original fiches are very fine, sharp scans 
and have improved after edition.
Yet an ammount of the original fiche files are too blur and unreadable,
so after many tries, I decided not to edit what is imposible to improve.

Many of the paper scans have also been expertedly edited and color corrected.
In particular yellow excess has been reduced, and the contrast re-adjusted. 
They are now different from the files available in previous torrents. 
The corrected files are marked with the (e) tag.

These are my personal edited files. 
If you prefer the original unaltered scans, 
download Omaham's torrent instead. 
It is in demonoid and still seeded.

If you just want the new edited files, then download twose with the tags:
(e): edited
(Fe): Fiche edited

Thanks a lot to the scanners.
Enjoy and seed.
