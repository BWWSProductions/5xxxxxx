,ddialogue,2009-07-24T21:39Z,Where do you install the no cd crack to?
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-07-24T22:10Z,"@ddialogue
right hand click on game exe icon on desktop goto properties then click find target keep that window open then copy the crack content to clipboard and paste in target window and then you should be prompted to overwrite existing files click yes then you are done 
hope that helps if not you can play the game by just keeping the image file of disc 1 mounted to a virtual drive"

,tackfurlo,2009-08-02T03:10Z,"For anyone who's wondering, yes, there's a torrent that's smaller and has more seeds, however that one does not work on 64-bit XP, so while the other torrent is better, this is what you should get if you are using 64-bit XP."
,VampricKing,2009-08-05T22:51Z,ok... here goes. first of all tall2daworld stop trying to become cool by pissing everyone off... it will just mean that you will or already have no friends and djDEVASTATE2009 thankyou for the upload i have wanted this game for a long time

,CrimsonGenesis,2009-10-16T11:17Z,"Hey guys ! How can I play this using the burned CDs ?? Actually it does work when I use the CDs but when I reached the Team Selection.. It says I should insert the correct CD..

How do I fix this ?

How can I play this using the CDs only without any cracks or patches ?

Thanks !"
,termite43,2010-09-28T05:49Z,"LISTEN HERE KIDDIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I know how to make the crack work.  It's exactly like The Battle For Middle-Earth 1,2 & Witch King (also by EA).

Create a new text document named ""Options"" and paste this into it:

AudioLOD = High
HasSeenLogoMovies = yes
IdealStaticGameLOD = High
Resolution = 1280 720
TimesInGame = 1

Close the document and change the .txt into a .ini 

Now take your Options.ini file and put it in My Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Data foler (and this also works for the Zero Hour expansion as well as ALL the Battle For Middle-Earth games).  

And that's it.  Oh, and feel free to change the Resolution values to, say, 1920 1080 or whatever your monitor will handle.  
Note that the Middle-Earth games came out long before widescreens were invented and in-game, only support 4:3 resolutions so they show black bars on each side of the game, but can be ""tricked"" into playing in widescreen mode by changing these values.  

I just tried this for the hell of it and be damned if it didn't work.  (Hip Hip Hooray!)
