James Horner - Streets Of Fire (Rejected Score)

01.	Streets of Fire		[00:11:51]

This is a BOOTLEG.  Rejected and never officially released, it's supposed to be
The score James Horner created but was rejected for Walter Hill's Streets Of 
Fire.  It's only one track, with no separations, and a drums sound taken from 
the first track that can be heard both on the CD and the actual movie, "Nowhere 
Fast", as the only recognizable link with the movie.

I haven't found many references to this score through Internet, hence this very 
short introduction text.  From http://www.runmovies.eu/, I found this text 
inside an article about the soundtrack for Star Trek III:

"Another recent assignment was in composing a score to Walter Hillâ€™s STREETS OF 
FIRE. Hornerâ€™s music, however, was subsequently rejected in favor of a rock 
score by Ry Cooder and serves as an example of Hornerâ€™s problems with free 
reign. â€œThe score that I wrote for STREETS OF FIRE was a very percussive, 
propulsive score. It used a lot of different, varied, exotic instrumentation. 
They decided to take that feeling out. They wanted something a little more 
traditional and they went with 50â€™s rock and roll.â€ Horner attributes the 
difficulty with the score as the result of his willingness to experiment. â€œI 
tried something very risky in STREETS OF FIRE. I thought it worked terrifically 
and so did everybody, actually. But after about a week of living with it, 
thinking about it, the director started to feel I perhaps had gone too far. Now 
thereâ€™s a difference between perhaps going too far and reverting back to 50â€™s 
rock and roll!â€


Enjoy it as it is, a curiosity.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
