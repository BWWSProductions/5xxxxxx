Good grief.  Two and a half years and not a single thanks or even a comment.  I wonder about us leeches sometimes.  Thanks for this excellent rarity.  I still say the score that made it to the screen is the one I prefer but then, I've loved Streets of Fire since the first time I saw it over twenty five years ago and I'm resistant to imagine this new score in that comfortable old setting.  Nevertheless it's great to have this rarity to add to my collection, and I'll give it another listen once or twice a year and see if it grows on me.  Many thanks.
