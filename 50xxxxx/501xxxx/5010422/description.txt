Urban Hymns - The Verve [1997]
	


Urban Hymns is the third album by English rock band The Verve released on 29 September 1997, which earned nearly unanimous critical praise upon its release and went on to become one of the biggest selling albums of the year, appeaaring on many end of the year lists in 1997.

The Verve were known for their music's complex, immersive sonic textures. "Bitter Sweet Symphony" was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and remains the band's most well-known song. "The Drugs Don't Work", the Verve's only number one single in the UK, has become a concert staple for jam bands and other groups. The rest of the album alternates between wistful ballads like "Sonnet" and "Space and Time", spacey grooves like "Catching the Butterfly" and "The Rolling People", and all-out rockers like the Led Zeppelin-esque, pounding "Come On", which closes the album.

The album received nearly unanimous critical praise upon its release, with Melody Maker naming Urban Hymns as the number-one album of 1997 in its year-end list. In 1998, it won Best British Album at the Brit Awards.
