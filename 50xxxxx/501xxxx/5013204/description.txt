- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   The Lost Souls is an original Americana Rock band from Virginia. Their music
   combines Roots, Rock and Pop, giving them the range to play stripped down
   acoustic porch music or to turn it up and rock with the best of them. All the
   members are veterans of the music business and have shared the stage with
   several successful bands over the years including Frog Legs, The Circuit
   Riders, Glitter Boot, Hubcap Fetish, Tobacco Row Exchange. As each of the
   band members were searching for the next step in their musical journey, the
   band came together to create their own brand of Americana Rock. The Lost
   Souls is fronted by Gray Gurkin, a talented songwriter who has played in both
   Austin & Nashville. He has been praised for his songwriting and his
   outstanding live performances. The rhythm section brings the songs to new
   levels with Chip Farnsworth on the skins and Turtle Zwadlo on the bass, both
   of whom have made their mark on the East coast band circuit. The Americana
   flavor shines though with Chris Berndt on fiddle adding some sawdust gloss.
