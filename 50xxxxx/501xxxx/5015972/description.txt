Lost Songs - David Gray [2001]


Amazon.Co.Uk Review

Released As A Glass-Raising Toast To The Longstanding Loyalty Of His Irish Fan Base (Whose Thirst For Fresh David Gray Material Is Truly Quenchless), Lost Songs Assembles Material Written During A Label-Hopping Lapse Either Side Of The Sell Sell Sell Album And Which Was Belatedly Committed To Tape In October Of 1999. Far From Being A Tatty What-I-Did-In-My-Spare-Time Scrapbook Of Discards And B-Side Quality Cast-Offs, Lost Songs Offers Conclusive Proof That Even David Gray's Folk-Pop Wastepaper Basket Is Lined With Silver. Effortlessly Maintaining Gray's Brand-Image As A Troubadour-With-A-Troubled-Outlook, Via A Homogeneous Selection Of Achy And Predominantly Acoustic Heart-On-Sleeve Urban Spirituals, Many Of Lost Songs' Choicest Moments ("Flame Turns Blue", "As I'm Leaving", "Falling Down The Mountainside") Could All Be Dylanesque Rungs From White Ladder. The Only Question Remaining Now Is How Much Higher Can He Climb?
