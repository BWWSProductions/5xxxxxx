How many readers does it take to change a light bulb?

Only one â€¦ if he or she is armed with this book! Rather than focus on the big projects that most homeowners would wisely leave to professionals, it concentrates on the common repairs that everyone encounters and anyone can doâ€”with the right instructionâ€”including repairing holes and dents in drywall; fixing popped nails in walls; checking and replacing fuses; unclogging drains; replacing light fixtures; fixing squeaky floors; repairing cracked tile and damaged carpet; replacing screens; screening gutters; and much more.
â€”Contains 250 to 300 step-by-step illustrations
