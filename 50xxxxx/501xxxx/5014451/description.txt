I am a local D-Jay from Bridgeport, Connecticut. I spin Hip-Hop, R&B, Reggae, Mainstream and the Billboards Top 100. I am capable of providing music for Promotional Events, Parties, Clubs, or even blend simple mix Cds to listen to for whenever you like.  I usually get New Exclusive releases and remixes from the record labels weeks before they are heard on the Radio. Please get with me if i can help you with any of your events. I am looking to become a full resource all-out Event Coordinator, with various acts, and maybe becoming a talent scout or agent some day. This torrent allows you to download my current Promo Mix CD's 23-25 songs of Exclusive, New Jams!!! Enjoy and Remember where you heard it first!!
