Ronald Jenkees noticed that no one else has uploaded some of the later tracks from RJs channel. If you haven't been checking him out he's about to release a new CD (which will be kickass!) and he's still jamming on a regular basis.

Previous upload mistake was due to too much jamming and not enough paying attention. Didn't realize he went back and talked a bit in the one track. My apologizes, it won't happen again. This torrent is an addendum to the last of recordings that you can find elsewhere on the TPB. Enjoy.

I grabbed the MP4 straight from the site then split the A/V converted the MP2 audio to MP3 with Easy CD-DA Extractor.
