On May 1st & 2nd 2005, Teahupo'o roared like never before over two days, and it was completely documented as THE BEST EVER by Blackwater director Tim Bonython. Day One was big grey and very scary and Day Two delivered a day of massive, perfect waves. See the images that went around the world--including amazing footage of a jet ski going over the falls and almost taking off Raimana Van Bastolaer's head! Also, the biggest wave EVER paddled into at Teahupo'o with 2001 World Champ, Globe's CJ Hobgood taking the drop on a monster of a set wave, now etched in Tehaupo'o's history.
