NOT poxy joint stereo!

That's the way to do it!"
,g8aso,2009-07-19T20:34Z,"That's weird, the partially download track was reported as Dual Channel in Winamp, but the fully downloaded tracks are Stereo.
No probs there, well better than JOINT stereo (which is CRAP).
All tracks about 1.2 - 2.9 dB below zero, try running them through MP3Trim to normalise.

Great quality, thanks, pity they are a bunch of shirt lifters though............."

[V],only1joe,2009-07-19T23:12Z,"g8aso - can you post a few links to this information and i will have a read and a download. I am a person who just enjoys the music, but i would not have a perfect ear for music. But you have to admit they aways looked as they were having fun in the songs and music videos.

Funny you should ask about the Now Thats What I Call Music Collection. I have been visiting my local charity shops and i have been steadily picking them up for about ?1.00 each, I have the following
Now 1990 - 18 - 34 - 35 - 38 - 39 - 42 - 44 - 46 - 47 - 49 - 50 - 51 - 53 - 56 - 59 - 60 - 61 - 65 - 68 - 69 - 70 - 71 - 72
They have been ripped and scanned, but i would like to add more before i would upload.
I also have the following but a disc is missing
33 - 54 - 57

So i will see how it goes over the next couple of weeks. 

Thanks for the interest.
