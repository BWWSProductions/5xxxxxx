A great Icelandic punk/glam group turned synth pop. Don't judge this group by their strange and drug-induced performance on Rokk i Reykjavik, this turned out to be one of the best groups I'd ever heard. More like a dirty Duran Duran or Simple Minds than punk, with great keyboards and drums. 

Singer = Asgeir Jonsson, bass = Baldvin Sigurdsson, keyboards = Jon Freysson, guitar = Thor Freysson, drums = Sigfus Ottarsson (only 14 years old and one of the best drummers you could hear). For a sample search you*tube "Bara Flokkurinn / The Just Group"


This torrent is their best-of CD, released a few years back.
