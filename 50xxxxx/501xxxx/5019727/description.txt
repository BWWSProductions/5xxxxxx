Dear fellow pirates. IÂ´m really sorry. I see now why nobody could start seed my first Jessye Norman torrent. Something went wrong. On Force Re-Check of my first torrent it stopped at 99,9 %. I havenÂ´t got a clue of what 0,1 % piece thatÂ´s missing.

So I hope this will work to 100 % so there can be a little action on the seeding. Download this and keep seeding. Long live piracy.

Jessye Norman
From Wikipedia

Jessye Norman (born September 15, 1945) is a four-time Grammy Award-winning American opera singer. Norman is one of the most admired contemporary opera singers and recitalists, and is one of the highest paid performers in classical
music. A true dramatic soprano with a majestic stage presence, Norman is associated in particular with the roles of AÃ¯da, Cassandre, Alceste, and Leonora in Fidelio. Norman is known for the direct and emotionally expressive qualities of her singing and for her formidable intellectual understanding of the music and its style, as well as first-rate musicianship. As a performer, she is known for her magnetic and dramatic personality, and, with her imposing physical presence, cuts an impressive figure before audiences. According to Curt Sanburn in Life, Norman on stage creates the perception of one who "veritably looms behind her lyrics." Norman's public manner combines an apparent hauteur with flashes of disarming humor, putting her squarely in the venerable operatic tradition of the Diva, to the extent that many credit her as the inspiration for the title character in the 1981 French film Diva.
