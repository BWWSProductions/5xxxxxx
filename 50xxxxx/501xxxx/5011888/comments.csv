,thepartycrasher,2010-03-09T12:14Z,"Thanks! I bought this years ago when I was in school, and then lost it. I was never able to find it in stores ever again. It's pretty fun and I just found myself getting it to work on a new PC with Windows 7 of all things!

Very cool to find this again after so long..."
