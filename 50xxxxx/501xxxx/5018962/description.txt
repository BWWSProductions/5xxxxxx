GRAN TURISMO:

Groundbreaking racing simulation that features 140 different cars including: the Acura NSX, Toyota Supra, Chevy Camaro, Honda Prelude, Nissan 300Z, and my personal favorite, the Dodge Viper. From mufflers to clutches to paint jobs, you can customize your car to fit your driving taste and style. The game offers two distinct modes: Arcade mode and Gran Turismo (Simulation) Mode. The arcade mode enables you to race exhibitions in which you can choose a fixed number of cars and tracks. In Gran Turismo mode, you start out with a set amount of cash, pass license tests to qualify for different events, and head to the races. The higher the events, the more cash you can get to upgrade your car. In addition to a mad amount of cash, if you take first place in an event, you also win a special car. And that's basically the whole idea: to race, to win cars, and to get rich.
