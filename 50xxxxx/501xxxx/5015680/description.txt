"Metalheads beware! Here is an album that is going to charm your midnight-black pants off, leaving you floating carefree and blissed out on little fluffy clouds of surprisingly seductive gorgeousness. That's if it doesn't provoke you to acts of savage, indiscriminate violence.
Hymns In The Key Of 666, the debut long-player from stylish Swedish threesome, 
Hellsongs â€“ vocalist Harriet Ohlsson, guitarist Kalle Karlsson and Johan Bringhed on keyboards â€“ takes the pedal right off the heavy metal to deliver startlingly laidback, low-fi and instantly likable covers of what would otherwise be deafening 'volume-up-to-11' rock classics. Hell has never seemed so soft, silky and beguilingly beautiful."
BBC Review Michael Quinn 2008-08-07

The swedish band who invented their own genre, â€œloungemetalâ€. Beautiful, atmospheric 
covers of classic heavy metal hits. Sit back, relax and enjoy amazing versions of for example â€œRun to the Hillsâ€ by Iron Maiden.
