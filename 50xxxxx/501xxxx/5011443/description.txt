Me Shivaji Raje Bhosale Boltoy Movie and songs..



Movie Review:

Went for the movie on first day and it did not disappoint me at allâ€¦!!!

The story is about a typical Maharashtrian named Dinkar rao Bhosale (Sachin Khedekar). People call him â€œGhatiâ€ (Correct meaning - Belonging to the Ghats of Sahyadri but vastly misunderstood as a very down market person with vernacular English accent). He faces many situations in his life where he is ridiculed like any thing. His daughter who wants to be a bollywood star is denied a role and the reason being the â€œGhatiâ€ surname. A ruthless builder is trying to get hold of his property at a throw away price by bribing municipal officials. Annoyed with everything happening around, he puts the blame on his â€œBhosaleâ€â€¦!!!
This makes Chhatrapati Shivaji Raje Bhosale (Mahesh Manjarekar) himself to travel across ages and remind Dinkar about the great ancestry this surname carries. Chhatrapati himself along with a mavala (a Marathi warrier played by Makarand Anaspure) guide him through his life and make the world understand the meaning of being Ghatiâ€¦
The movie is full of dialogues that make you clapâ€¦!!!
The movie puts both good and bad things about a Marathi person and appeals a lot.

Technically speaking, this movie has the highest production cost than any Marathi movie ever had and it is clearly visible when you watch it. Editing is perfect and the movie looks extremely polished.

For the first time, I saw the whole theatre clapping every minute and appreciating each and every bit of the film. Being from Satara, the very own capital of Chhatrapati, I could not resist myself from yelling â€œJai Shivaji, Jai Bhavaniâ€ all the timeâ€¦!!!
