So i need to know if this is a stolen copy cause i wish not to get my damn internet banned??? :P those are the only ones i stay away from cause they are traced, the rest are not usualy traced"

audio - 8 (mild distortion)
video - 8 (NOT super dark, Spanish text and a few Spanish subs for newspaper shots)

all in all 100% worth the DL and took under an hour!"
