BAD! DO NOT DOWNLOAD! THIS IS CRAP! I CAN NOT BELIEVE ONE SINGLE PERSON DID NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS BUT THE END CREDITS ARE COMPLETELY CUT OUT!!! WTF??? Soon as the end song starts playing and the cast starts to roll upward suddenly the person who made this video decides to END IT!!!! And people are giving this download positive reviews? I donât think so. If you want an incomplete movie---then this is the one for you! Now I have to go search for another version of this movie. KLAXXON I really expected better of you than this crap!"
,Dr_Zee,2011-01-26T14:07Z,"Yeah, this sound is pretty jacked up. As far as I can tell, the movie sound is all in the right channel with an ear exploding high pitched whine coming through both channels. 

0/0"
,rampage1875,2011-07-18T08:42Z,"btfan you are getting this free and so what if the end credits are cut unless u want to sit and watch the names of the production team as i dont know 1 person who doesnt know just about all the cast in this film, Some people make me laugh honestly,
Thanks for the film klaxxon its spot on :)"
