,pongfaen,2009-09-28T22:21Z,"So freeware is illegal on TPB... Yeah right. 
I like having freeware here to, because it's usually easyer to find what you are looking for here. Besides, DVDshrink is not avaiable from the publisher's web site anymore, so drop dead, mr. im-twelve-years-old-and-like-to-complain-about-everything-because-i-think-thats-the-only-way-to-get-laid!"
