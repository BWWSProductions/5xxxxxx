Especially the athiests and the fuck that can't spell so he TYPES in slang...FOOL.

If you don't believe in a creator ""God""...well then you are a flat out fool. Sorry. When you die and remove your strain on OUR air supply you'll find out. Until then SHUT THE FUCK UP and stop trying to shove athiestic SHIT down people's throat.

Stupid god damn cornholing screen hider nerds."
,Crawling_Chaos007,2009-07-19T23:38Z,"I'm putting my faith in a Creator God. Even many physicists now agree that there had to be ""intelligent design"" to the universe. 

What intelligence would that be? The Creator. Our Creator.
I don't use the bible so much as I use logic and reason. You expect me to believe and have ""faith"" in NO God. That we were an utter accident formed through processes that were just..accidental? 

You cannot disprove His existence no more than I can prove it to you. The universe supports the existance of the Creator God, however...the ""intelligence"" behind the design. 

Sorry. I have no faith in the human race and the entire universe being a universal accident.
What is written by man's hand may or may not be as some of it is. I would rather trust a booming voice from the sky, but I would think The Creator would have better things to do than prove to us ants he created that he exists. We either believe or we don't. If your right I have nothing to worry about. If your wrong YOU have something to worry about perhaps.

It's like a theory. Scientists have ""faith"" in many theories, but they cannot prove them.  
Nor could they EVER disprove the existance of a Creator God. "
,Crawling_Chaos007,2009-07-19T23:48Z,"By the way..in the end even Carl Sagon changed his belief to intelligent design/theism. Before he died.

That's the way it goes. Young people will rave and rave about how there is no God it's impossible..the only thing that exists is what's in front of your eyes and ears. Until they are near death for some reason. Then they will pray to GOD to save them. I've seen it. It happens SO often. Some times it isn't even a life threatening near death experience. Sometimes it's just a person getting older and start to find that the prospect of nothingness becomes unappealing coming closer and closer to one's own death.

Such a foolish way to look at things. To close your mind utterly to something is to be blind. Any scientist that closes their mind to ANYTHING is not a true scientist. Any ONE that closes their mind to the infinite unending possibilities of the Universe that was created for us...is dishonorable to themselves and the human race.

God will NEVER be disproven. Though if he exists he could prove it to us if he so chose. "

I just had to call you two out as utter morons. 
That's all. I don't have to tell you why as I already explained. The guy railing christians though...such a f'ing fool.  CHRISTIANITY DOES NOT TEACH YOU THAT YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN IF YOU DIE MURDERING INNOCENT PEOPLE AND FUCK 99 VIRGINS EVERYDAY..AND WHEN YOU WAKE UP EVERYDAY THEY ARE VIRGINS AGAIN. I say FUCK Islam. It was perverted by that evil warlord they call the ""Prophet"" Muhammad. He was just an evil arab that fed off of a religion to create his own in order to rule uncontested and have the faith of the weak minded. Allah is the name of the original arabic MOON GOD..not the Creator. That's why they worship that damn meteorite in Mecca. pfft"

It's actually more ""there can't be a God because of the horrible things in my life: my parents got divorced, my mom took away my XBox and my McDonald's hamburger had pickles on it AND I SPECIFICALLY SAID 'NO PICKLES!' How could God exist when such terribly evil things continue to happen to me?""

Sadly, rather than looking at the ACTUAL atrocities on this planet, these same dweeblets will curse the God that starving people give food away to know about. But that's the plan of the enemy.

I've learned not to get angry at these kids. Most of them really don't know what they're talking about and in their attempts to be rebellious and nonconformist they automatically conform to any bitter emo's opinions of religion. It takes real guts to risk your eternity by openly denying something you know nothing about. But as we know, 50% of bravery is stupidity. 

No one can convince you that God is real or not, but if you openly and honestly ask Truth to show himself to you, you will receive an answer. And the best part.....its FREE!"
