,redmoose,2009-07-22T21:02Z,"One time uploader of a show that doesn't air till tomorrow, with a slow link. smells like a FAKE to me."
,1mher3,2009-07-22T22:07Z,"their search sometimes does not find stuff.
when I searched for ""burn.notice.s03e06"", I found this torrent:

,ReasonsUnknown,2009-07-23T19:08Z,"Episode 6 has been posted last week. TPB's search engine is still broken.

,howsie,2009-07-24T07:03Z,"problem is is that its not showing in the category at all. When i tried to find this i looked in the category by clicking tv shows > burn notice > s03.

only then did i try the search engine where it also failed to find it i have since found the file but still have not seen it in its proper category"
