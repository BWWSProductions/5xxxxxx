                              THE ALLMUSIC REVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Stephen Thomas Erlewine

Flowers in the Dirt did earn good reviews but perhaps more important was its 
accompanying tour, McCartney's first full-fledged world tour in years. Given the 
tour's enthusiastic reception, McCartney could wait until 1993 to deliver the 
album's proper sequel, Off the Ground. Though it isn't as consciously ambitious, 
Off the Ground certainly picks up where Flowers left off, as McCartney feels no 
shame in making an album that doesn't aim for the charts (though success would 
certainly be welcomed), yet is still classy, professional, and ambitious. Two 
key differences appear: It's a leaner production (making the mid-tempo numbers 
seem less cloying and giving the rockers real kick), and McCartney's social 
conscience dominates the record (which is easily his most politically active, as 
he rails against animal testing and pleads for world peace several times). He 
doesn't leave love or whimsy behind ("Biker Like an Icon" is easily his worst, 
most studied stab at whimsy), and he still has a pair of fine McCartney/McManus 
songs ("Mistress and Maid," "The Lovers That Never Were") to pull out. This all 
results in a record that has its virtues â€” it's clean and direct, where many of 
his solo albums are diffuse and meandering, and it's serious-minded where many 
rely on cutesiness â€” but, overall, Off the Ground feels like less than the sum 
of its parts, possibly because the seriousness is too studied, perhaps because 
the approach is a bit too stodgy. Nevertheless, this has nearly as many 
successful moments as Flowers in the Dirt, standing as a deliberately serious 
comeback record by an artist who spent too much time relying on his natural 
charm, and who feels no shame in overcompensating at this stage of the game.

                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recording and structure

When the sessions for the album began in the fall of 1991, McCartney decided to 
use his current touring band as session musicians, most of whom had already 
appeared on Flowers In The Dirt.  In addition, his collaboration with Elvis 
Costello was rekindled with both "Mistress And Maid" and "The Lovers That Never 
Were" emerging from their songwriting sessions and reserved for this album. 
Unlike Flowers In The Dirt, however, Costello would not appear on Off the 
Ground.

One of the main differences between Flowers In The Dirt and Off The Ground is 
the leaner, more direct sound. With the musicians sounding less studied than 
they had on the previous release, Off The Ground has a relaxed, natural feel by 
comparison. Another change is McCartney's increased interest in social issues, 
be it the scathing anti-animal cruelty rocker "Looking For Changes" (McCartney 
and his wife Linda long-time vegetarians by this time) or paeans for a better 
world ("Hope Of Deliverance" and "C'Mon People").

Release

"Hope Of Deliverance" was chosen as the lead single, being released in the last 
week of December 1992 and the album following in February 1993. While Off The 
Ground hit #5 in the UK and reached #17 in the US, and eventually went gold, it 
also has the distinction of being the first Paul McCartney album to not contain 
a sizeable US hit single since Wings' Wild Life in 1971. While "Hope of 
Deliverance" floundered there, it managed to reach #18 in the UK, where "C'Mon 
People" would become a minor hit as well. Worldwide positions for the album were 
generally good, but that was mainly because Off the Ground was released during 
the very poorly competitive post-Christmas season. As a matter of fact, the 
album spent only 6 weeks inside the Top 100 in the UK, even reaching #5 there. 
In Germany, the album was particularly successful, with "Hope of Deliverance" 
reaching #3 on the singles charts and the album spending 4 weeks at #2.

Some weeks following the album's release, McCartney launched "The New World 
Tour", taking in many successful shows across the globe during the summer 
months. These gigs would be documented on the album Paul Is Live, which follow 
at the end of 1993.

Although generally considered a slightly weaker successor to Flowers In The Dirt 
and now somewhat overlooked, Off The Ground is prized by many McCartney 
followers.

The feet on the album cover are actually of McCartney, his wife Linda and his 
touring band.

"C'Mon People" is followed by a hidden excerpt of an unlisted song called 
"Cosmically Conscious", originally written by McCartney in 1968 during The 
Beatles' transcendental meditation retreat in India

                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
