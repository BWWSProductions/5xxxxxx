,ruleoffire,2009-08-18T00:55Z,thanks for the good torrent MQFPLO. Game really blows tho.. maybe thats just my opinion.
,ruleoffire,2009-08-18T00:56Z,"Oh and by the way, the description is more about the actually movie, the game doesnt follow it at all."
,jkershaw,2010-08-10T00:26Z,SEEEEED! Everyone's stuck on 93.5%!!
,jkershaw,2010-08-13T16:37Z,This is ridiculous! Please seed this so we can seed for you!
,a01s02d03,2010-08-13T20:27Z,"If you seed enough to pull one person through, that one person can pull everyone else through. There are about 20 of us stuck at 96.9% for the last three days... Please, I really want this game..."
,a01s02d03,2010-08-14T21:54Z,"LOL, now we are all stuck at 99.0%. I agree with jerkshaw, this IS ridiculous."
,jkershaw,2010-08-15T00:04Z,How did this guy become a VIP? This is the worst form of torrent torture ever!! If you seeded for maybe ten minutes we'd all have this game. All 28 of us. Unbelievable.
,face2k,2010-08-21T11:51Z,"This is fucked up!

,jkershaw,2010-08-24T04:28Z,Test
,jkershaw,2010-08-24T04:30Z,"You can download the final three pieces from torrenthound. For some reason it's not letting me post the link, but there is a torrent there that's exactly like this one that I used to get the final three pieces and it works."
