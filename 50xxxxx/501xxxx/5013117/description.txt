This is the new version of my skinned iTunes 8.2.1

Originally I've made my first iTunes skin in earlier 2005 to complete my OSX appearence theme.
Previous versions are all blacks but since iTunes 8, we can't change the metal brushed interface so, I've made a new skin, humbler and grey.
As many of you liked my work, here thus the last version. 
I hope you'll enjoy it.

Finally, here is my tutorial to make your own iTunes skin:

If you don't like the font I use, you can simply trash this font:
/Library/Fonts/SilentiumPro RomanII

If when you try to install you have this message:
"the following installation process failed: run preupgrade script for itunes by psykozz!"
All you need is trash this file:
HD/Library/Receipts/iTunesX.pkg
Then, installation is OK! ;-)

If you like it, please seed! ;-)
If you find it ugly, please post constructive comments or don't waste your time here!

See you!


FONT INSTALLATION FIXED!
