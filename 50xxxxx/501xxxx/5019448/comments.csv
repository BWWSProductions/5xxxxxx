,myysin11,2009-07-25T10:46Z,Quality sucks ass!!!
,Dr.Pepper,2009-07-25T13:53Z,"Compared to a non compressed sd DVD.

Video quality: 3pt of 6pt possible.
Audio: 4pt of 6pt possible.

Conclusion: Its crappier than iPod quality, but still I would say its worth downloading. Since there are no other options that are better. I dont see the point in the huge size, as one could easy get even better quality from twice as smaller file.

Movie on the other hand is a huge disappoitment, this is not a true Terminator movie as the previous movies was. I would give 0 pt of 6pt possible, just boring!"
,reticencias,2009-07-27T11:14Z,"why do you insist in calling it a dvdscr or whatever if the dvd isn't out yet??? man... 
you're bullshiting the community!"

,tolwyn86,2009-07-27T22:39Z,"@ reticencias : Learn what a screener is before jumping on the torrent uploader, retard.

Nice quality and audio on this. Can't wait for the bluray though."
,Sleppmegin,2009-07-30T23:22Z,And where does it even say it is a screener ?
