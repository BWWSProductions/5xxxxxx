And as always, I NEVER SAVE CRAP ON MY COMPUTER, so therefor also this is good quality Sound and Video. The Swedish translation is super, so there is nothing to complain on.

As you can see above, you can only choose SWESUB, or no sub at all (Engligh speech)

Special thanks to: "2LionsTeam" for the sorce
                   "SiGnaL" for the Swesub and the stips + meny
                   "TheHorseman" for the bandwith!

Take care, and I hope you enjoy this relese as much as I do!
