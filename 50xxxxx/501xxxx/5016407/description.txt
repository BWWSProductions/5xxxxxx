Joan of Arc [1999]
Leelee Sobieski as Joan

She died at 19. 500 years later, her legend still lives.

"Based on the triumphant, yet tragic, true story of Joan of Arc. Born in France during the 100 Years War, Joan grows to be a strong and vigilant believer in a better future for her strife torn country. Despite impoverished beginnings, her deep religious convictions lead her to believe in her destiny to lead France to freedom. 
Joan's ability to rally the people is tested as she struggles to help the Dauphin Charles claim his throne and unite France against its English invaders. But Charles has plans of his own.
France's Holy Inquisition puts Joan on trial for heresy, convicting her for the very religious beliefs that returned the King to power. At 19, she is burned at the stake. Nearly 500 years later, she is declared saint."
