,jonken222,2009-07-21T03:50Z,AVG says that the crack is infected why ?? 
,blade-boi,2009-07-21T17:37Z,"You can't copy/paste the file when it is corrupted with the virus vundo. Guess we'll have to wait for a proper crack. By the way Culpeck, you're an idiot. "
,blade-boi,2009-07-21T17:56Z,"Okay, apparently everyone not using AVG isn't having any problems running the game, so i guess that it's a false warning from AVG. 
Anyway i am also using AVG and i simply just added the Bionic Commando crack folder to the exceptions in the AVG resident sheild settings and i was able to copy and paste the crack. Do the same afterwards with the Bionic Install folder and the game works 100%

And i haven't seen any sign of any virusses.."
,hickname,2009-07-21T20:27Z,"Hey, people! Don't cap your upload speed please - 270 seeders and 10 kb\s download."
,daocmods101,2009-07-23T03:11Z,"Props to Culpeck.  He is accurate.  Anyone that says otherwise is ignorant of how software and the industry functions.

AVG is notorious for false positives as well as several other software suites.  If you get a good package (like Kaspersky) it doesn't default detect most keygens as viruses.  If you turn on grayware detection it just explains that it is not necessary malicious software.

Frankly, if you're the type of person that bitches about viruses on here you need to just go buy all your software retail.

And for god's sake stop running the virus scanners in memory.  It eats up your CPU and memory resources and takes over your system - not that you really used it anyhow."
,MrGiggles64,2009-07-23T06:17Z,"@ jonkey - 

90% of antivirus products report keygen's as either trojans or malware, and 90% of the time it is a false positive. this means it isn't actually malware / trojan, it just has code that is similar to trojans / malware. if you feel downloading something is a risk to your computer, don't do it."

,dr4v3n,2009-07-23T20:09Z,Great rip but this games a piece of shit. A forced port of the 360 version. They didn't even bother to change the control tips to PC instead of the controller. Way to go CRAPcom
,jagerfrog,2009-07-23T22:35Z,"culpeck, amen."
,samanoskeake,2009-07-23T22:46Z,Why exactly do I have 3KB download speed...and why exactly are there 4.2K leechers? 
,abbadonsminion,2009-07-24T03:51Z,"I tried uploading the crack to virusscan.jotti.org, but when I did the website said that I did not have permission to do so "

sorry for doublepost"
,Mantrhax,2009-07-24T09:53Z,"Stop using AVG, its spying on u !"
,gokselc12,2009-07-24T12:50Z,"yeah AVG detects Vundo virus but dont bother it.It's clean,I've no problem.Just add your game folder to AVG's exceptions list.
oh And use winrar's ""extract to"" button instead of drag and release method."
,ddk666,2009-07-24T19:51Z,hwo do i switch it to DX9 ? and can i lower the shadow ? so i can play without lags
,BitHQdvd,2009-07-24T21:17Z,"Very good abbadonsminion :) That should keep some of the noise off the comments section.
Me thinks culpeck finally blew a gasket... but very understandable (every new member should be FORCED to read his statement before allowed on the site! )
So sick of SEED! and VIRUS! post clogging the pipes from newbies.... wish I could ignore post from certain members permanently.

Very Disappointing reviews for a game I was actually waiting to be released.
May have to try a demo or the $10 bin for those having issues ;-)  "
,Undesired,2009-07-25T00:17Z,This is the worst port ever! The whole fucking tutorial is with Xbox controls. Its like reading a  book upside down while its on fire. I gave this a chance and hold on for 45 min. The game is pretty decent but the controls are awful. 
,MaakkaaN_123,2009-07-25T01:39Z,"hmm THIS SUX, downloading in 4kb/s .... omg"
,abbadonsminion,2009-07-25T03:31Z,"IMHO the game is okay, but the XBox controlls on the top right hand coner of the game is lame (I don't have a XBox 360 controller for windows, otherwise, I would be in a better mood). To add to the non-keyboard controlls, it feels like my movements and the whole grapple thing is off-key, but it could just be my lack of gaming skills.

All in all the game is worth playing (if you havent played the origional) but the controlls for windows blow

I am not sorry if I pissed you off by posting my opinion "
,Ripp2233,2009-07-25T10:42Z,"Culpeck u must be an ignorant stupid fool....
People will always be new at this, aslong as the old school people behave like u....
Let the kids learn and if u dont like what they do... CORRECT THEM NICELY!
Untill u do, u aint a pirate, pirates hold together and protect each other... ur just a bitch... "
,jzenman,2009-07-25T22:26Z,ripp2233... I think culpeck is right on. Plus it's makes for a very funny read. I'd add the advice to learn how to do a clean reinstall of windows and do it every six months just to keep things running smooth. newbies need to be smacked in the face once in a while so they'll learn.  
,grouchpunk08,2009-07-26T03:07Z,"the graphics are pretty good, but the controls are really bad unless you have a 360 controller, or some other sort of controller for your computer. The mouse and keyboard controls are terrible, in my opinion at least."
,grouchpunk08,2009-07-26T03:08Z,but its a good upload nontheless for those who want to try it out. Thanks AiTB
,Artak323,2009-07-26T04:53Z,"the game works fine

,silox2,2009-07-30T03:04Z,"@The Ice Phoenix,

No way the game killed your power supply.  Maybe just not enough output to power everything you got.  Also, if you got Vista, Run as administrator."
,xiIix,2009-07-31T02:37Z,"Phoenix, it is scientifically impossible for a game to ruin PC hardware. It might be possible for a game to make a PC crash, but simply crashing is not going to kill a piece of hardware. Your PSU went because it was it's time to go. Shit happens."
,rattman012,2009-07-31T03:19Z,"@xiIix
Yes if a game demands are enough they can potentially overheat hardware or pull more power than the psu can handle.

@The-Ice-Phoenix
Get a bigger psu. I run a 650watt on mine and im only running:
8800gt
Amd x2 5000+
4gb ram
2 harddrives

With your system get at least a 700 or better. Quad core and an ati 1gb 4890 really??? im surprised your new psu isnt dead yet.

,tub0rg,2009-08-01T00:42Z,"@rattman012
if you build a system that cant run at 100% aswell cooling as powerwise its you own fault not the games fault.

and from a psu point you could easily run your setup on a 380 watt psu. actually i have nearly the exact same setup running on one. 
i would recommend a bigger one to be on the safeside and for future upgrades but it is not needed."

,leberard,2009-08-04T20:11Z,"Please save yourself the time and do not download the piece of shit . Normally even if i see flamers on a torrent or read /watch a so so review of a paticular game i will still end up downloading it just for the hell of it because who knows it just might be good . That is not the case with this game . I have to say it has been one of the worst games i have played in a few years at least...

controlls suck - even if you are using an xbox controller 

no fucking options - like wow i can only adjust my screen resolution and controller sensitivity really folks ? 

flawed platforming - ok so when the bulk of the game is based off this why is the collision dection so fucked up ? you can swing atop a beam for example and no matter if its completly flat somehow your character will slide off of it ...i had to stop and LOL after i saw this one .

Enemy hit dection - you can be about 5 feet away from an enemy with a shotgun and completly miss ...The mobs hitbox in this game is about as wide as a pin . completly annoying . 

so again please dont download this crap game and if you do dont say i didnt warn you . "
,MaakkaaN_123,2009-08-06T01:13Z,i had waited for this game for ages. but what the fuck seriously? this port sucked fucking balls! and the gameplay sucked balls to it isnt even fun to play i uninstalled the shit after 1h man im pissed at grin!
,alabala12,2009-08-08T03:35Z,I completly agree with MaakkaaN_123. This port is really bad. I'd rather play it on my x360 at least the control is times better.

,chrisje070,2009-08-14T19:34Z,mastros when the game stops at 47% you have to change the file (data/movies/turorial) 60spin.bik to 360spin.bik then the game works perfect
,-=Fragger=-,2009-08-16T14:29Z,Has anyone else had a problem with getting the crack inside the folder where you installed the game ?

i dunno i only know i must backup my system--- and i delete the crack"

80 Gb Hard Drive
1100 watt PSU
