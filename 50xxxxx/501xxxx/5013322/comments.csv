,angryfluffer,2009-07-26T11:04Z,"If anyone finds that their install suddenly says that the certificate is invalid, use system restore to go back to before you installed directory opus.  Add www.gpsoft.com.au to your hosts file so that it resolves to localhost.  Then install directory opus again, disable automatic updating and everything should be fine."

,HG2112,2009-07-28T14:16Z,"It does work on Windows 7 but some features might not work correctly. 

Also this is the x86 version and many will install the x64 version of Windows 7. "
