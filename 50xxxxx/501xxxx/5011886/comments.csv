,Vojmaster,2009-07-24T14:29Z,"Great job,

Installed without any problems, no virus, it will update as well, everything worked well. Using the activator (Orbit toolkit 1.8) only activates it until 02/03/2010, this is because it uses the RC keys to activate. During install just click next when it asks you for the product key and use the  activator as an admin and activate, once restarted it will be activated until the date I mentioned.

Tried to reinstall it like 8 times and as soon as it would restart after installing the files to finish the installition more MEM_MANAGEMENT BSOD.

,Balthazar7,2009-07-25T19:40Z,"X,
With limited information it does sound as though you have a bad download.
Recommendations: right click all files in this torrent > properties.
Look for the largest file. It should be 3.8GB or 3,850,360KB
3,850,360KB is an exact number if yours is different then you have an incomplete torrent.
That file should have an extension labeled as .iso (dot ISO)
I don?t remember the original name of this file because I make my own custom installers and had renamed this file.
If this file does not have an .iso at the end ? right click > rename to .iso extension"

I do not know what else to suggest other than you may need a different bit torrent client and download this torrent fully. There are two large files here. The one you downloaded is only for upgrading Vista. The other much larger file is the ISO.

It is a rotten fact of live people are selfish and self-centered. Most people on our Earth practice ?what is in it for me- attitude.

Installs fine with virtual drive. I have no idea what your talking about. Before I burned my copy when I accedently erased the boot record, I installed using a virtual drive and could dual boot with vista.

(For anyone whos wondering) heres how I did it:

I resized my NTFS partition that vista was installed on using EASEUS Partition Manager to 125 gigabytes - half my computers memory, than created a new NTFS Partition using the now available disk space and then mounted the downloaded ISO from the torrent using Daemon Tools Lite (the latest release from FileHippo.com). I told it to install on the NTFS partition I created that was not in use by Vista, it said copying temporary files, then asked to reboot. After rebooting setup continued and installed just fine. Seems like common sense to me.

BTW, I am typing this running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit from this torrent activated, and it runs like a dream. Better than XP and Vista by a longshot, Highly recommended. The only downside is no movie maker :P Paint is upgraded though and so are MANY other aspects from older windows versions, as well as new quirks and cool options too. Plus it boots up fast. 

It does ask for a serial number but just skip it and follow the torrent's directions :]

Thanks uploader!"
