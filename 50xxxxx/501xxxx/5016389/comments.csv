,gage757,2009-07-24T16:56Z,hey great movie an i was wondering bone thugs n harmony came out with a movies called I TRIED an it really is the best rapper made movie iv ever seen an now i cant find it anywhere not even on line to buy i was wondering if you could find it for me it came out in 08
[T],twiztidxxninja,2009-07-26T00:33Z,"I added Talladega Nights and Old School to my list. I will be putting Episode 2 up next after Harry Potter. I will look for the Bone Thugs Movie. 

As for T-Fish, I don't mind the criticism, but the fact is you don't upload anything. For someone not uploading and complaining is like a fat person in the drive-thru of a fast food restaurant and complaining they are fat. If you don't like how I do my movies I'm sorry, I suggest that you make better versions and upload them and show me up."
,T-Fish,2009-07-26T11:31Z,"you are correct, i have no uploaded torrents. im one of the guys who seeds in hiding :p

its beside the point though. i didn't complain either, i merely asked if you knew what ""untouched"" means and you didn't answer my question.

that was before fanboy simpson came yelling at me in capslock -.-

[T],twiztidxxninja,2009-07-28T02:33Z,"I do understand what untouched means, but if I were to write re-encoded. What does that mean? Did I change it from PAL to NTSC? From AVI to DVD? Re-encoded leaves a lot more room for question. All I did was make the dual layer dvd fit on a single layer DVD. Untouched is more of saying that everything that was originally on the DVD is still on it."
,T-Fish,2009-07-28T16:27Z,"Video - re-encoded CCE 5 pass 4400 kbps (DVD9 -> DVD5)

^^ that would mean you re-encoded the video with CCE using 5 passes ending up with a bitrate of 4400. 

if you state; video - untouched, then thats just a lie.
if you're really worried that people arent sure
whether its PAL or NTSC, then give as much info as possible. as it is now, you lie in the description, so why should someone believe your NTSC in the title? better to be honest about it all. the more info, the better ;)"
,PepinoAhead,2010-04-23T14:47Z,T-Fish... We all understand that untouch (in 4.37 Gb) means the DVD is full. IS UNTOUCH STUPID!!! BUY THE ORIGINAL AND FUCK YOU!!! Thanks twiztidxxninja.
