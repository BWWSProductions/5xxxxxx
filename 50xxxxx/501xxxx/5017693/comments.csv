Uploader? How about you get a fucking clue and dont put up a piece of software that cost literally thousands of dollars without saying two words about it. 

Anyone have any luck with this torrent?"
,RasPirate,2009-08-17T06:22Z,"Indeed, sorry to be harsh. I see the uploader is respected, and thats always appreciated, my only point is that this program lists for $13k. Some install tips might go a long way. 

Thanks again "
,scuzzo,2009-08-17T22:27Z,"yes this is an amazing collection.. thankyou very much but is there some sort of crack or activation process to go through.. when i tried it it said the it could not find the dll in sonar..

help?"
,RasPirate,2009-08-18T00:53Z,"Good to see some response going on here. Uploader, you may be trusted, but youve got a +$10k bundle here. Again, any words at all about usage/install would not only help but are quie needed. 

Scuzzo, did you run the setup? No problems or virus'?"
,pheard,2009-08-22T04:20Z,I second the request for instructions. Where's the crack? There's also supposed to be a workaround for Vista 64-bit. Any info on that?
,uktab,2009-08-27T20:00Z,"Forget this torrent. All the latest Waves plugins are at: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3990831/Waves.Mercury.Bundle.VST.DX.RTAS.v5.0-AiR
apart from the 4000 (which sounds too harsh for some reason ?) and is pre-cracked."
,uktab,2009-08-27T20:07Z,"If you want a good start point for a mixdown, use a low-cut on every audio channel at about 20 - 30 hz. This gives you more headroom, as this is where big speakers push out air with the bassier sounds. Now add the FREE Classic Series Compressor from http://www.kjaerhusaudio.com/classic-series.php on every channel (the Vocal setting  wil work well on most sounds !). Finally, insert the Waves L2 or L3 from the mercury bundle on the master output channel, and select Hi res CD Master preset - sorted :)"

You started a great job why not accomplish it?
Anyway thanks for the effort of generousity.Atleast. "
,seeder.1,2009-11-27T22:25Z,"For people who need help to activate the plug-ins, The only tip I can give is buy an iLok key and find the authorisations somewhere over the web...

GOOD LUCK!!! ;-P"

,qstylez,2010-06-19T17:48Z,"Thank you!
Everything works great!"
,paidpirate,2010-10-06T03:52Z,"Party People!.. I feel your pain and I am happy to share the FINAL SOLUTION. :) If you're getting ""plug-ins not found"", Waveshell 5.0- 5.2 missing, etc.etc; first uninstall waves.(optionally use a good registry cleaner like ""Ccleaner"". (yes, it's free) to clear your registry. Then...go to Control Panel>User Accounts>Change User Account Settings.. Here you bring the slider all the way down to Never Notify.. ( WHY? you ask? Well, The Account Control prevents any program from accessing folders without user permission, even though Waveshell was able to locate the plug-ins folder, it was not able access it). Cick OK, then restart your computer. Right-click the Waves setup.exe and select ""Run As Admin.. After installation you should see the pop-up box asking to select your plug-in folder. Do so. Whenever you Start your DAW., again right-click> Run As Admin. This should remedy all related problems.. Hope this helps.. TRUE LOVE, People... "
,TheKonqueror,2011-06-20T09:28Z,"WORKS! TESTED!

This is a pack of (mostly) AIR cracked plugins.

Downloaded fine, took me about 20 minutes on wireless. This is a .rar file, so you'll need something like VirtualClone Drive to mount this ISO (its a disk image for all you n00bs).

Anyways, extract everything, it'll be a list of each wave pack. Go through and basically install whatever you want, although the drumagog requires a key, which I've not actually cared to try and mess with.

I'm using FL Studio 9 XXL producer edition. One of the things I realized was it was putting some of the VST's in my c/program files x86/VstPlugins folder... and some in the c/program files x86/Waves folder.. 

This is because it gets confusing when you install and it starts breaking everything up... to remedy, basically just copy and past every .dll you find in the Waves folder into the VstPlugins folder. 

Re-open FL Studio, rescan & verify the plugins, then enable to your liking.

I had forgot to grab my Waves folder from my previous studio and was unable to load some of the effects plugins... I just opened an older file I made on it and all the plugins work fine!

ENJOY..."
,evadbmobevid,2012-02-28T22:38Z,"works good. its all cracked, except for drumagog which has a keygen with it. works good on fruity loops 10."
