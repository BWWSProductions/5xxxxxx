Released alongside Jet Moto for the PC, Twisted Metal 2 was another rare game
released by Sony in 1997. This game sadly suffered the same fate as Jet Moto and, due to bad marketing, was taken off shelves due to lack of sales. Enjoy this full CD image of this rare game and please help seed to keep it alive!

NOTE: When running the installer for the game, allow it to install EVERYTHING! That includes the Indigo Video Software. This allows the game to function properly and fully. Without it, you may experience issues running this game on today's computers!
