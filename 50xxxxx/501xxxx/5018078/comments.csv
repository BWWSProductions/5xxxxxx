This has already been uploaded by me and is still a live torrent last time i checked, maybe this uploader is a complete bellend and just loves the praise, did not support my (the origional full TM2 torrent) upload or downloaded mine and reupload without a Ang3L heads up, mention or fuck you.

Anyway that aside, great game and people still play onlie via Kali, works lan too."
,LateMan001,2009-12-24T19:19Z,"Guys before downloading, we should do calculations, 
about This Torrent:-

================================================

DOWNLOADABLE GAME(TM2) SIZE = 690 MB

TOTAL SPACE OCCUPIED BY CD = 341 MB

MOVIES FOLDER(USELESS) SIZE WITHIN CD = 249 MB

TOTAL PLAYABLE GAME'S FILE SIZE = 341-249 = 92 MB

WASTAGE OF BANDWIDTH = 690-92 = 598 MB


RESULTS:-

1. TOTAL GAME SIZE = 92 MB
2. WASTAGE OF BANDWIDTH = 598 MB

So Guys look for another Torrent for This PC Game, 
with size between 30 to 100 MB."
,ngp2789,2010-01-12T18:02Z,"LateMan001, the calculations you posted are technically correct.  However you are missing the fact that the music does not get copied to the hard drive.  Plus, the movies are also on the disc and do not get copied to the hard drive.  This is the full CD image with all the music and the movies, so no bandwidth is wasted.  Only the essential game files are copied to the hard drive and NOT extras such as the music and such."
,ngp2789,2010-01-13T05:32Z,"What you are looking for is a rip.  If you want one of those, they are out there.  I understand bandwidth is a precious thing, so the choice is yours."
,ILKnight,2010-01-16T04:28Z,Works great. Thanks

,DarthzeroProductions,2010-06-24T22:51Z,Try going to gamecopyworld.com and downloading a no-cd patch
,TheNoobKIng,2010-08-28T01:35Z,setup will not work with x64 computers :( If some1 knows how to fix this that would b great.
,carhole,2011-02-24T06:37Z,"For those trying to get x64 working, this is the best i could come up with.  The TM2.exe file will run in compatibility mode, but the TM2SETUP.exe won't.  

So mount the bin file (i used magicdisk), right-click and open mounted image, right-click on TM2.exe and set compatibility mode, then run TM2.exe directly.  

It isn't installed, and you have to keep the image mounted (i couldn't get a patch to work), but the game seems to run.  

If anyone knows of a better solution please share.  "
,XxSTICH666xX,2012-01-10T01:13Z,I seeded to 41:1 (28gigs) so if you can't get a seeder the  somebody is being selfish.
,magicbean,2012-02-01T09:24Z,"there is always the option of getting the ROM out the box in storage, stick it in the dishwasher for a cleaning and mounting the iso to an actual cd, chances are- if you dont have a raid driver- emulaters are only hurting your HDD performance."
,quinn222,2012-05-09T21:36Z,"Says 'file is corrupted' for the Setup file. 

No use to me?"
