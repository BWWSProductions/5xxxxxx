[T],Kiwid,2009-07-19T21:26Z,"oops, thanks uploader!"
,anighean,2009-07-25T19:58Z,"Can only agree, good shows allways die young, look att Carnivales. Too much money and the big coperations thinks its a waste. And spend the few pennies they got on absolute crap like reality soaps, what is that? Some idiots with an IQ of an fish stick getting a free ride on our dime. No wonder the networkes are loosing viewers. Anyone withe the slightest intellegence download what they like... Oh, thanks for great uploads"
