Great?
It's okay.
   My fav part though is how the camera shakes so much that people fall out of frame when they are talking.  
It's actually an okay show, if you don't get motion sickness."

,gold167,2009-11-05T21:44Z,Excellent shame about season 2

The good thing is they're starting by airing all of Season 1 again, minus the annoying bleeping and with extra content in the episodes, I hope someone somewhere will cap and share them :)"
