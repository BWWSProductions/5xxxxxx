,dasmaster910,2009-11-08T11:31Z,"following prob:
i putted the iPatcher file into Prey->Package Contents->Contents->MacOS. your description says that there is already a file called iPatcher. but in my MacOS folder there is no file called iPatcher.

You do NOT need this torrent to make Prey work.
Actually, if you use Snow Leopard, it won't even work. What you have to do to make the patcher work is 
1. Go to ipatcher.org and download iPatcher.
2. Right click on the .app, click show package, contents and then resources. 
3. There, you will find another .app called iPatcher. Click show package again. go to Contents, and then MacOS. Copy the iPatcher unix file inside it.
4. Go to the NoCD patcher you downloaded with the game. Show package again. Go to Contents, and then resources. Overwrite the iPatcher file inside it with the newer one. 

And now it should work. "
