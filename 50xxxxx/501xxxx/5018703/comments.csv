,ashmat,2009-07-27T15:36Z,"This will do nothing for you in attempting to activate windows 7 7600, why bother risking a future install and activation when the OEM keys are released. Get the right iso, and sit and wait like good little soldiers :-) "

,denovan,2009-07-29T15:42Z,@rtj73 - almost every hack on the planet registers as a possible virus. get used to it.
,rtj73,2009-07-30T01:20Z,"sorry denovan, but I have found one that only flags 1 hit on virustotal, and it's by some off brand scanner I've never heard of....

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5006933/Windows_Activator_UES_Build_6021_-_July_2009

check for yourself, it worked fine for me on both x64 and x86 versions of Windows 7 build 7600, and it's virus free.... 

hrmmm see, not all hacks register as possible viruses, most of the time the ones that do have multiple hits are actual viruses, so YOU get used to it smartbutt... LOL"
