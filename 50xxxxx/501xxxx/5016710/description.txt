I bought this box set when it was first offered by BMG about 10 years ago.  Because it's hard to find this stuff in actual physical media, I encoded all of these into FLAC.  Each album was tagged from freedb.org

Slayer's first recording, Metallica's first, bunches more.  Some of these are available dirt cheap from Metal Blade, I hope you will consider buying them for yourself.  If you're a metalhead and don't know Metal Blade records, you need to educate yourself about one of the most ground-breaking record companies in heavy metal history.

If you want the real deal, it's available on Amazon, used.
