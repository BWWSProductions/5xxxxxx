Release Length: 01:57:02
Storyline: In 2005, the only thing hurting Los Angeles Times columnist 
Steve Lopez more than his face from a recent bike accident was his pressing need for story ideas. That 
is when he discovers Nathaniel Ayers, a mentally ill, homeless street musician who possesses extraordinary 
talent, even through his half-broken instruments. Inspired by his story, Lopez writes an acclaimed series 
of articles about Ayers and attempts to do more to help both him, and the rest of the underclass of LA 
have a better life. However, Lopez's good intentions run headlong in the hard realities of the strength 
of Ayers' personal demons and the larger social injustices facing the homeless. Regardless, Lopez and 
Ayers must find away to conquer their deepest anxieties and frustrations to hope for a brighter future 
for both of them.
