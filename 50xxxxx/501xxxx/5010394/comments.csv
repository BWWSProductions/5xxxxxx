Important. The only way to increase downloadspeed is through SHARING. Your program takes care of that part if you don't limit anything.

You have 3 kinds of shareratios:
- Torrent shareratio (how much you have shared)
- ""This session"" shareratio (since last time you restarted the program)
- ""Overall shareratio"" (since the program was installed).

Seeding another torrent (or 2) may increase the speed of the one you're currently downloading, since it will increase your ""This session"" shareratio.

The seeders will drain your speed if you use them too much without sharing anything yourself. Seeding another torrent while you're downloading will protect some of your downloadspeed and give you a slightly faster progress.

IF you have lost much of your speed try seeding one or two of your previous downloads for a couple of hours (with no upload limitations).

I have finished all the 8 downloads some days ago and will continue to seed them for 6-7 days. Some of you needs to restore your shareratio to be able to finish them all. The trick to restore shareratio is SEEDING."
