Thea Clayhill (Lindsay Lohan) is about to lose her position as secretary to a very cranky publisher (Chris Parnell) â€” so she lies about being pregnant to save her job. The plan works. With the help from a friend (Cheryl Hines) â€” and a pillow â€” Thea fakes the pregnancy while she figures out what to do next. But in the meantime, her boss gets called out of town and his cute brother Nick (Luke Kirby) takes over. Nick launches a new parenting division at the publishing company, and he wants Thea to be the editor. Suddenly she gets a raise and a promotion. And pretty soon she begins to like her new life â€” not to mention Nick â€” a lot. But how long can Thea keep up this ruse? And what will happen when everyone learns the truth?
