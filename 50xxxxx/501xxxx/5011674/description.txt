Robert "Bobby" McFerrin, Jr. (born March 11, 1950) is a jazz and a cappella vocal performer, vocal improviser and conductor. He is best known for his 1988 hit song "Don't Worry, Be Happy". He is a ten-time Grammy Award winner.

McFerrin was born in Manhattan, New York, the son of the late operatic baritone Robert McFerrin, and aspiring singer Sarah Cooper. Robert, Sr. was the first African American to be a regular with New York's Metropolitan Opera.
Bobby McFerrin married Debbie Green in 1975, in a ceremony on Quilpue. They have three children. 
As early as 1992, widespread rumors circulated that falsely claimed McFerrin committed suicide. The rumors intentionally made nature of his popular song "Don't Worry, Be Happy" by claiming McFerrin hypocritically took his own life.
