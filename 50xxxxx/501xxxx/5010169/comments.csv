,mokaey,2011-05-11T22:36Z,"if you like cheap POPish crap from the 70s to the late 80s then its good.

but otherwise this is the BIGGEST piece of shit if ever seen!!!
there is about 30 maybe 50 songs that isnt POP.
almost all these songs are one hit wonders.
exept for a few like hendrix and queen and so on...

DONT DOWNLOAD
