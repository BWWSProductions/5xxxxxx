This is the one. The Carrara of all Carraras. We worked more closely with Carrara enthusiasts to add more features, tweak more interfaces, and fix more bugs than in any previous release of Carrara. Not only does Carrara 7 include robust new features such as Multi-pass Rendering, 3D Paint, Vertex Modeling in the Assembly Room, UV Editing/Unfolding and NLA Grouping, version 7 also has many enhancements to previous features. Thanks to the cooperation we received from our community of passionate users, Carrara 7 is the best release of Carrara EVER!
