From Wiki
John Barry, OBE (born John Barry Prendergast on 3 November 1933 in York, England) is a renowned Golden Globe and five-time Academy Award-winning English film score composer. He is best known for composing 11 James Bond soundtracks and was hugely influential on the 007 series' distinctive style. One of Barry's best known compositions is the theme for the 1971 TV series The Persuaders!, also known as "The Unlucky Heroes", in which Tony Curtis and Roger Moore were paired as rich playboys solving crimes.

Authorship of the "James Bond Theme"
Sole compositional credit for the "James Bond Theme" is attributed to Monty Norman, who was contracted as composer for Dr. No. However, Barry, while not publicly denying that, has implied otherwise. Some 30 years later, in 2001, authorial matters came to a head in the High Court in London after Norman sued The Sunday Times for publishing that claim in a 1997 article naming Barry as the true composer; Barry testified for the defence. In court, Barry declared he had been handed a musical manuscript of a work by Norman (meant to become the theme) and that he was to arrange it musically, and that he composed additional music and arranged the "James Bond Theme". The court also was told that Norman received sole credit, because of his prior contract with the producers. The verdict was that Monty Norman composed at least part and maybe all of the "James Bond Theme". How much, remains an open question.
