In a village in the Southwest of France, 1962. Maite and Francois are 18 years old. They are friends, not lovers. In Francois's classroom, there are Serge, whose brother has just married to try to escape from the war in Algeria, and Henri, a pied-noir (Algerian-born Frenchman). Francois and Serge will have a homosexual relationship, but Serge wants to marry his brother's wife... Written by Yepok

RP review
5.0 Stars
I wouldn't call this a "gay movie" per se -- the story develops four characters, students at a French boarding school in the lush countryside somewhere near Toulouse, only one of whom is gay -- but I liked the treatment of the gay boy's sexual awakening and coming-out. How many others as adolescents "experimented" sexually with another boy, developed feelings for that other, and then faced the reality that he is not actually gay? Been there, done that. The other three characters and their stories are also engaging and extremely well acted. I loved the backdrop of the French war in Algeria, and I loved the end of this film: there is no resolution to anything; life just goes on. This is one of the better French films I've seen and I'll definitely add it to my "see-again" list.
