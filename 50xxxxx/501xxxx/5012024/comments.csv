Microsoft have finally announed that at 4pm today E.T. (which I?m assuming is Seattle time and not the arrival time for an alien spacecraft) Windows 7 went to RTM.

You can read the official announcement on the Windows team blog here.

This marks a significant milestone in the development of what was a very short beta and testing process.  The decision to RTM has been eagerly anticipated for weeks by the very same people who were saying the beta?s not been long enough.  Well, you can?t have everything I suppose!

The RTM build number is 7600.16385

1)  Each activation tool needs to be run as ""Administrator"" - Right-click --> Run as administrator

2)  Activator 1.5 and Toolkit 1.8 use ""frankenbuild"" methods, which use hacks to inject RC code/keys and activate them, hence the possible addition of expiration dates (run WINVER)

3)  TimerNuke nukes the activation pieces altogether, so activation status stays at ""unknown""

4)  ALL activation hacks should be considered temporary, as Microsoft deploys countermeasures against them - YMMV

5)  Doubful anything will be permanent (unless you don't update your OS and keep it off Internet)...OEM methods will have the best chance at success"

Using the included toolkit WILL render your OS crippled on 3/2/2010 due to expiration of the RC key hack.  Nobody has their hands on final Windows 7 license keys, and if they did, they would be foolish to share, as mass activations on a particular key would render the key useless."

,TeamPirateLive(TPL),2009-07-27T21:43Z,"Hi guys, I will try to answer some questions so you don't have to crawl through every comment page to find it. (Please note that my answers may be inaccurate, if not entirely wrong, so use it at your own discretion.)

@ XecutionerZ
Q: ""N about activation...,does it work..???""
A: After downloading and installing this torrent (smoothly), using the activator included DID NOT work. It may just be my comp, and that it could work on others, but it did not work for me at all. 

After a while googling around, I found this activator to work perfectly: http://keznews.com/5968_Windows_7_RTM_7600_x86_and_x64_activator_-_time_crack

I used ""Windows 7 7600 x86 and x64 activator (link 1)"". After downloading and extracting it (the file is in .rar format), run ""Windows_7_Build_7600_Activator"". If you are using Vista, please remember to right click it and ""Run as administrator"". Click the activate button, and it should activate this Windows 7 copy. To check/make sure it did indeed work, click ""Start"" and type in ""activate"" in the search bar. Click on ""Activate Windows 7"" and it will display whether it has been activated or not.

@ fugitiv3
Q: ""is this bootable?""
A: Never tried, HOWEVER, when I restarted my computer with the disc still in the drive (I burned the .iso to a disc) there was a screen that asked if I wanted to boot anything from the disc. So the option was there, but I never tried it to see if it works.

@ sanderb134
Q: ""is this a clean install or an upgrade?""
A: You can either do a clean install OR an upgrade. However, it will not allow you to upgrade if you are currently using Windows XP.

@ jag_tadeos
Q: ""WinRar is asking the password to unpack this stuff, could someone able to give the password please? thanks.""
A: The torrent is not in .rar format and doesn't need a password.

@ lars66157
Q: ""does this work? is this the real windows 7?
does these version never start up during run this?""
A: Yes it works, it is the real Windows 7, and hasn't failed to startup/shutdown for me yet.

@ Odracir194
Q: ""Will windows update work on it?""
A: Yes it does, just activate Windows 7. So far, I have only used Windows Update to download some ""Optional Updates"".

@ yomo68 
Q: ""is this better than xp for games.. if yes i'll download""
A: For me, it seems that games run just a tiny bit smoother. Not a big difference. However, other users have stated that their fps (frames per second) in games have increased by a lot.

FAQ: ""Can I please have a key to activate Windows 7 Build 7600 (RTM)?""
A: As of right now, there are no available keys to activate it. There are methods to change the files of the RTM into the RC and use the RC keys to activate.

FAQ: ""Will Windows 7 Build 7600 (RTM) expire?""
A: No, but without the keys (or activation), it will be unusable after 30 days. 

FAQ: ""Is this .iso touched? Or untouched?
A: I have no idea, but two previous comments have stated that ""Wzor"" has touched it. It's perfectly fine, as the torrent is clean (no viruses/trojans/spyware).

FAQ: ""Is this the actual RTM? I thought it wouldn't come out till October 22nd?""
A: It has been heavily speculated (even confirmed by some sources) that Build 7600.163.85 is indeed the RTM that Microsoft will ship out on October 22nd. "
,yms1975,2009-07-28T08:36Z,"Just an FYI to all potential downloaders. I downloaded this, installed it & activated this using the activator. It worked like a charm. I do have one question though : I've already verified that it's been activated, but I'm a bit confused by some of the comments about it being ""unstable"" after 30 days. What's that about? Or is that only if you weren't able to successfully activate it? Lil' help?"
,topjimmy68,2009-07-28T15:14Z,"@yms1975:  The activator injects RC code/key to ""fake"" the activation.  Type WINVER from the run line or a command prompt to see if the activator introduced an expiration date for the OS.

There isn't a real way to activate Windows 7 without real keys, and M$ may kill your activation with a Windows Update or other method, so you need to be careful about what your OS is allowed to do on the Internet."

And trust me, I know how to tweak my Windows installations and all, this shit is not working fucking well at all.By the way, I'm not sure if this helps, but I installed this on a Toshiba A205-S4777 Notebook which is pretty up to date, and there's just various problems, unless it was in general because I never got the older Windows 7's to install because of a driver issue, which even Vista has as a stock driver, psh."

(now this is for me a MIRACLE!) it play with HIGH GRAPHICS!!!!! Now that's just wowowow how a simple OS can run games without u even having to buy a video card.

It's the RTM and it's works without any problems or bugs."
,negleh,2009-07-29T04:21Z,"Enkei, that's good that it runs your sims good, but try to install language packs, refresh desktop after emulators, install daemon tools, losing taskbar. It will happen soon, and actually, it seems it runs slower than Vista which is weird, I'll have to try running this on my desktop, which actually has lower specs than my notebook."
,tatwei,2009-07-29T04:58Z,"Hi, i am currently using Windows 7 RC, can i upgrade from this torrent and not lose any of my installed programmes?"
,Harutik_11,2009-07-29T05:14Z,"wtf?
i installed this and it installed a 32 bit version
i need my full ram and a 64 bit, did i do anything wrong?"
,topjimmy68,2009-07-29T06:20Z,"@tatwei: upgrade from RC worked for me.

@Harutik_11: X86=32-bit, X64=64-bit.  This torrent is the 32-bit version.  There's no way that I know of to upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit OS."
,enkei123,2009-07-29T16:58Z,negleh I'm sorry that happened to you (hope it doesn't to me lol) but maybe it's because your using those programs (which are mostly used for pirating and such) so probably Windows 7 was made to not run those programs probably lol idk xD
,yms1975,2009-07-30T09:37Z,"topjimmy68 >> Thanks for the explanation. After activating it, just knowing that it'll expire not too far away coupled with the worry of having to look for a key later on  is enough reason for me to just take it off my system. At least I was able to install it and get a good luck at the OS. I guess I've been using Ubuntu for too long. It's a FREE OS that comes with everything I need without having to worry about keys or MS killing my activation. Oh well.

AiTB >> Thanks a LOT for the upload man. Great work."

Sorry, I installed it on my system and didn't realize it was a fake until Windows detected it. I removed it with the included toolkit. I found another one which seems to be more reliable. It's for Ultimate versions. Anyway, it's not like you're missng good advice here."

,JohnMikhael,2010-08-22T23:48Z,"No Need for 64-bit

because it needs more fucking RAM

32 bit is the best it takes less RAM and by the way its faster
even if add 1,000 gb of memory
it will be the faster way."
