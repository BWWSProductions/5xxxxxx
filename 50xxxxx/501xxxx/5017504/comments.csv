,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2009-07-30T04:55Z,Thanks. Wish you had it in a different format but it's all good. I planned on watching it on my VLC player anyways. Thanks for the upload man. =]

Keep it up. 

Thanks a lot.  "
,visiart,2009-11-30T22:13Z,"Is this really Unrate version?
USA Unrate duration should be 206 minutes, this version is written over 200 minutes.
I do not dare to download, because the information above doubt.

For those who've finished downloading, please give this version Unrate whether or not.

Thanks"

In a written statement on a 200 minute"

,Robin5555,2011-05-24T17:41Z,"it is 120 min cut version,unrated version is 126 min."
,mizzllat,2011-06-23T06:29Z,"Title does not state it is uncut, only that it is an unrated cut of the original movie.  I do not mind the .mkv at all, VLiS- actually like how clean it is- but have no problem, either, simply converting the file to .avi or mp4 or whatever format is required if the files are to be played on a different player.  I'm just grateful you went through the time and trouble to post the torrent in the first place- THANK YOU!"
,mCihhh,2012-04-07T16:04Z,"""Unrated Cut"" or ""Uncut"" are the same thing.
The source of this rip was a PAL DVD, so the difference in the duration is because of the ""framerate"".
This version of 120min @ 25fps equals to a NTSC version of 126min @ 23.976fps."
