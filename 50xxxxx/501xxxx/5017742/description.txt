This collection makes available to scholars and students an excellent and extensive selection of Galileoâ€™s key works from his early career to the end of his life - some in toto and some represented by key selections. It presents not only Galileoâ€™s most famous works but also a range of less-known texts as well as an excellent selection of the documents from the trial of 1633 and from the 1616 condemnation of Copernicus.

In addition to the breadth and quality of the selections, this volume is particularly attractive to students and instructors thanks to Finocchiaroâ€™s expert and up-to-date introductions, biographical sketch, chronology, annotated bibliography, and glossary. This is a must for anyone teaching or studying Galileo, the scientific revolution, and the relationship between science and religion.
