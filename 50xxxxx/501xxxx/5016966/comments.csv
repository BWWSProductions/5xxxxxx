,hipster80,2009-08-13T17:11Z,What a collection!! Thx dude
,aetbanan,2009-09-09T22:06Z,"thanks for sharing!! i won't download it all at once, it's too much to take.. but i will keep seeding for sure!"
,majalogan,2010-03-13T05:01Z,"This is unbelivably awesome, finally someone took the time to put a proper Fela release out there! Thank you so much!

Perhaps you should put the Fela albums out as a separate torrent too ? There are too many dodgy / incomplete Fela torrent collections out here, as far as I can see this is by far the best one. 

Are there any albums by Fela missing ? "
,tamabald,2010-05-08T01:36Z,"all the albums are here, the only thing missing are the singles, which are impossible to find"
,tamabald,2010-05-08T01:38Z,"i forgot to say thanks.

p.s. and i didn't think to bother with separating fela here from the rest, i think all torrent programs are able to give you a choice of selection which files to download and which not to.

cheers!"
,Krulj,2010-05-23T16:59Z,What a beauty! Thank u so much.
,majalogan,2010-06-04T10:40Z,"hi tamabald yeah man I know that you can separate them out in the torrent prog if you want - 

I was just suggesting to put out a ""Fela Kuti discography PROPER"" torrent so people will pick this one - for all the people who might be getting into Fela for the first time and won't be searching for ""afrobeat"" or something .. that way they would pick this particular, superior Fela collection, not the numerous low quality / disorganised / skipping etc. Fela torrents out there ...  "
,majalogan,2010-06-14T01:16Z,If you have all the discs it would be awesome if you ripped into a lossless high quality FLAC version !

- yes, now i understand what you meant, and i think it's a good idea to put Fela into a proper collection. especially in losless format. however...


1) most of these albums that are in 320kbps mp3 have been ripped by me from flac sources, that took me years to find from various obscure sites. what i already said is that the quality of those doesn't differ from the quality of any other decent rips, since all the so called ""cd remasters"" are done from the same poor quality sources because there are no Fela masters, they were almost all destroyed in raids on his residence in kalakuta.

  i have done careful comparisons of those cd-ripped flac sources with the ones i already had in poorer mp3 quality (256kbps or under). what it seems is that someone who wanted to distribute those cd's just used whatever he/she could grab his hands on, in most cases those same mp3 sources that circled around the net, and in a few cases the sound was obviously better because they actualy did succeded in finding a much better source somewhere.

  now, those are still far from the quality of a real lossless file. when i compared the 320 rip with the flac source there was absolutely no difference at all. that's why i decided to keep the mp3's, just for the sake of disk space. what's the point of having lossless filess that aren't really lossless?



2) a buddy from the demonoid site, justin1145 here, asked for my permission to upload the torrent of the Fela collection i had at the time at demonoid, here at piratebay. it's here at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4872086/Fela_Kuti_Collection

  now, that was before i ripped all those flacs i found and sorted them all properly, so many of those are in poorer quality than the ones here.

  i'm having a very tough time here where i live. i'm out of work and i can't afford much of the things i could before. online time is one thing among those. guess it would take ages to seed somethign big like this... so... if you want to upload a proper torrent of these improved quality Fela's only, instead of me, i have nothing against it. au contraire!  :)

cheers!

PEACE!"
,newmouse,2010-11-29T02:22Z,"Thanks VERY much tamabald.
