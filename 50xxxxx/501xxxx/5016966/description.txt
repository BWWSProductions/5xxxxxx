This is a collection of afrobeat music i have acquired over the years. I have already posted about an year ago my Fela Kuti collection at demonoid (under my second alias euzebije) but in the meantime I started gathering his recordings in higher mp3 quality. Almost all of these albums that are in 320kbps are ripped from FLAC sources that I've found on the net, which were ripped from original CD's claiming to be DIGITAL REMASTERS of Fela's recordings. However, sound quality on those so called remasters is more or less the same, and that is due to the fact that most of Fela's master recordings were destroyed, mostly in army raids on Calacuta republic.

But I have been able to correct many things in this collection that I've overlooked in the previous one. For example, most notably the biggest difference can be seen on (1989) Beasts Of No Nation, which had only part 2 of the named song, now it is in full length, and such is the case with 1985) Army Arrangement, both songs are in full, almost half-an-hour length. Some recordings do sound better than before, some the same. C'est la vie. I also included all Femi and Seun Kuti's albums, Ginger Baker's Stratavarious which features Fela, and Fela's drummer Tony Allen's full discography. Nothing is compressed, so you can choose which albums to download, if you want only certain ones.

P.S.
- One more difference from the old collection, this time I have tried to put Fela's albums into chronological order.
- I have removed some albums, like Zombie (USA) was, which featured previously released tracks, for the reason that someone just patched those songs from previous releases together, rather than ripping from an actual source.

P.P.S.
- Regarding my internet connection. My download speed is 3mbps, but my upload speed is pitiful 0.3mbps, and since this is a really big one, PLEASE BE PATIENT.
