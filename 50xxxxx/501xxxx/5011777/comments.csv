,xullah,2009-07-21T16:06Z,None of the serial is working. Any idea or thoughts would be appreciated.
,coco38,2009-07-21T17:36Z,"If you have updated, you need to remove the file 

/Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Office/OfficePID.plist

and also this file if it exists :

your_username/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/Office 2008/Microsoft Office 2008 settings.plist

then enter just open word and you this key (thanks jedego) :

,chillin69x,2009-07-21T22:02Z,"I'm still unable. When I choose the disk I'd like to use the the 12.2.0 update on, it has the red exclamation point on in the corner of my HD. And tips? "
,bob_bitchin,2009-07-22T15:53Z,"@chillin69x: that happened to me, too.  I think SP2 needs SP1 installed first...at least that what seemed to solve it for me.  I installed from the torrent, used the auto-update feature of Office to install SP1, then installed SP2 manually (since I'd already downloaded it).  The serial that worked for me was W339P-JRCPB-XX8XD-YK49M-7DYCW.  Also, I used this torrent, since there are no seeders on the one you're looking at currently:
