,tired,2009-07-27T16:55Z,my problem with otherkeylogger iwe tried is that World of Warcraft find it..any suggestions to silve this?..is this working ?
,logan_wns,2009-10-09T22:47Z,keylogger is a software which records every letter you type frm ur keyboard including ur username n pwd. If u are using using a good antivirus it will treat keylogger as a virus or a malware software. thats the reason it wont allow u to install it. Generally hackers use keyloggers to steal ur username n pwd.

,rul1981,2010-02-02T11:31Z,"Avira recognize it, but is not a virus because i work with the program with no problem. Maybe, the only thing is that if i want to go with YahMess. the field for Id is gray and i cannot write the id, and i can't enter in messenger. I'm sure that Elite is blocking somehow, because if i uninstall it, the YM is working great. Someone know something about that?"
,spiedey,2010-04-20T07:51Z,"@rul1981

sry dont know.
here is everything working okey:P"
,SpicyFetus,2010-07-03T22:32Z,"This isn't a virus.
It's a legit and decent keylogger.
It takes screens but the key logs are sometimes jumbled.
The reason it comes up as a virus is because for a logger to be anonymous it has to hide.  So what's it do?  It hides in reg keys.
If you don't know this I don't think you need to be looking into keyloggers. "

,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2010-11-25T02:32Z,"Do you know what the pirate bay needs to put up in the software section? They need to explain what a false positive is. You know the people that blindly follow there anti virus programs are like a cult almost as bad as organized religion. 

Somebody could put a key logger onto your computer and watch what you say. So your anti virus blocks it and says its bad. It doesn't know your purposefully downloading it. So click add exception and move on with your life. 

It is curious that somebody that doesn't know what a false positive is; is looking for a keylogger...

,hoopdedoo,2011-01-04T00:47Z,"@inyualex123:  boy, I sure wish I was your PC repair guy.  300 bucks!  Um, dude...you need to get out of TPB and any other torrent site, you need to uninstall uTorrent or whatever, and never mess with piracy/warez/porn/etc again.  Either that, or learn how to rescue your files and reinstall Windows your own self once it gets infected (and IT WILL!).  "

@inyualex123

you clearly dont know what a keylogger is..

300 bucks? hahahhahah"
,hoopdedoo,2011-04-16T07:11Z,"@ spiedey 

Listen dumbfuck, I know precisely what a keygen is.  You're too much of a numbskull to get the point of what I was saying; that if you're going to toy with software here, you better be prepared to deal with the occasional infection, without having to pay somebody $300 bucks to fix it.  Or are you so naive that you believe everything on here is legit?  idiot."

,Titanium9533,2011-09-02T23:22Z,"It would be worrying if your antivirus didn't pick this up as some sort of trojan or hacktool. If you haven't got an antivirus that does that, you are not ready to use this program. Hackers are the most vulnerable people to being hacked. "
