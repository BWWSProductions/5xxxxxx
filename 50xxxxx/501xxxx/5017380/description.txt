Benefits:
	Safety on the Internet
The two-way firewall stops inappropriate or malicious access to your computer from both internal (LAN) and external (Internet) sources. As a frontline defense, it prevents malware from spreading or â€œphoning homeâ€, providing protection against hackers, loss of personal data, unknown malware, and unauthorized program activity.

	Preemptive threat protection
Outpostâ€™s Host Protection module monitors how programs interact to protect your system against high-level security breaches and has passed all well-known leaktests to prevent unauthorized transmission of information from your PC.

	No more spyware!
Eliminate spyware with Outpostâ€™s dedicated antispyware utility. Regular updates and always-on monitoring ensure that spyware cannot activate and cause damage to your data or divert your applications.

	Secure web surfing
The versatile Web Control module safeguards you against the Internetâ€™s darker side. It steers you away from websites infected with drive-by downloads, prevents the inadvertent disclosure of personal information, limits your exposure to potentially unsafe web properties, and keeps your identity private.

	Bulletproof self-defense
Outpost cannot be deactivated by targeted attacks, ensuring continuity of protection.

	Performance-driven operation
No matter what you do on an Outpost-protected computer, it will always feel like itâ€™s brand new because the program uses so few system resources. The key engine has been optimized to deliver revolutionary speed efficiency, so you can focus on using your computer productively, not worrying about security issues.

	Power without complexity
Whether youâ€™re a security novice or expert, you can easily configure Outpost Firewall Pro to meet your needs. Thanks to automated and context-sensitive help, the firewall can learn how to handle alerts and make decisions for you, so you can focus on what you want to do, and leave the security to Outpost!
