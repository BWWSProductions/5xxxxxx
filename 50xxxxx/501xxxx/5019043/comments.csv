Unfortunately, any english subtitle file (.srt) on:
     - subscene.com
     - opensubtitles.org

It's a pity that without english subtitle, student in english, non swedish/english and hearing impaired, even if trying to read on lips but it is very difficult and painful, may not contribute in seeding. 

Thank you very much in advance for your kind understanding.

By the way no english subs on this and i couldn't understand what they are saying."
,AnotherStranger,2009-07-25T22:23Z,"Hardcoded Swedish subs, heh? That sucks big time, why not an srt-file instead? Especially as you've uploaded this under its English name - then where are the English subs?!?"
,skissa,2009-08-01T01:37Z,"Yeah too bad there are no English subs, even .srt if possible. However, i'm glad I downloaded the movie, good seeding, good video, good sound, thx"
,dartur,2009-11-25T19:04Z,"""Uploaded under its english name""? Ever occurred to you that the movie have the same name in Sweden? Also, the title clearly states ""SWESUB"". Many people in Sweden like to burn and watch movies in their standalone dvdplayers, and many of those doesn't support srt files. That's why these releases are great. Thanks kickfoot!"
,random1m,2009-11-30T07:53Z,"Only great for the Swedish, which most people in the world are not. Why won't you guys stop being so selfish? Just kidding, but I still hate hardsubs, even in English. Well, at least the Swedish don't dub the films like some others.."
