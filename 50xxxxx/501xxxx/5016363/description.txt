The EPs 92-94 - David Gray [2001]
	

Amazon.Co.Uk Review

Fourth Album White Ladder Made Him The Household Name Of 2000, But For The Majority Of The 1990s--The Years From Which The Eps 92-94 Was Compiled--David Gray's Sales Record Was Disappointing At Best. Eventually, After Re-Mortgaging His House And Setting Up His Own Label To Release White Ladder, The Manchester-Born Singer Would Prove That Perseverance And Unwavering Faith Are The Stuff Of One Million Album Sales. Unfortunately For Hut Records (Home Of The Verve, Gomez And Placebo) Their Supplies Of Both Ran Dry In 1995 After Gray's Second Album, Flesh, Bombed. Having Missed Out On The Main Prize Of White Ladder, Hut Here Capitalise On Gray's Success With This Collection Of His First Four Singles And Respective B-Sides. There Is, However, More To This Than Just Exploiting Fans. While Not As Instantly Compelling As White Ladder's Highlights, Nor As Heart-Wrenching As His Other Rarities Selection Lost Songs, There Are Some Beautiful Moments Amongst The 10 Acoustic Laments. His Pretend Accent (Part-Scottish, Part-Welsh, All Totally Unconvincing) Aside, "Birds Without Wings" Is Gorgeous, "L's Song" Is Tender And "Brick Walls" Is Classic Singer-Songwriter Material. For Completists, It's A Must For The B-Sides. For Fans Of Breakthrough Singles "Babylon" And "Please Forgive Me", It's A Less Attractive Proposition As, Apart From "The Rice" And "Wisdom", Some Of His Melodies Are So Subtle They're Almost Not There. But Like Everything With Gray, Perseverance Is Rewarded, Eventually.
