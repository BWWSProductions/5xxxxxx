You got everything correct just do like this

BOZX has added all the files that contains each game in to an huge rar file. 1ST to do is to either
unrar the hug file for the game you want.Then you see all the files you say is numbers.Its the files you need. So drag and drop them into the same folder where the hug rar file is and delete the huge file.Couse you dont need  the files twice since it take up hdd space.Now Start to unrar the iso file to the place you want it. 2ND way i find lot easier to do.1 Make a new folder.2 edit and copy the name from the hug rar file.3 edit the new folder and past the name in to it.3 now unrar the huge rar file.4 copy and past all the files from the file into the one you just made and you have the GROUPRIP as it was relesed.5 extract all the files and put the iso or cso file wher you want."
