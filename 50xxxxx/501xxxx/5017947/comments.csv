But I still can't believe that there happened to be a real person, Leatherface that would do these kinds of things.. Can you?"
,Batman_516,2009-08-28T10:22Z,"actually, it wasn't a real person. The movie was LOOSELY based on the true story of Ed Gein. Look it up on Wikipedia"
,artfan17s,2009-12-23T06:27Z,Wikipedia - now theres a source to trust for accurate information - (said while rolling my eyes) :)
,Bombotta,2010-02-09T14:37Z,"The charactor ""Leatherface"" is loosely based on the true storey of Ed Gein as Batman_516 states. As were the Charators ""Norman Bates"" from Psycho, and ""Buffalo Bill"" from Silence of the Lambs. Writer/director Tobe hooper explained that he decided to create a family of killers that had some of the charactoristacs of Gein. And the chainsaw idea, that came to him while standing in front of an upright display of chainsaws at a local hardware store. So no, this is not based on a true story."

,nastybastard,2010-09-21T17:15Z,"Ed Gein, who leatherface is losely based upon worked alone and besides from the entire masks out of human skin-thing, he had very little in common with leatherface. This is fiction, wich has been inspired by real events, like most fiction.

Great upload man!"
