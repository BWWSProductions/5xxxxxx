Movies : Drama : VHS Rip : English
The dry plot summary from IMDB is below. Bottom line, you won't find this anywhere online and it's tough to get a version to buy. It was made for TV by AT&T back in March of 1989, and despite being a DVD rip, it's VHS quality. Sorry.

You will not find a better fictionalized account of the Manhattan Project. This version beat Paul Newman's "Fat Man and Little Boy" by a mile with critical acclaims and an Emmy for best Drama. It is a true 'hail to the geeks', showing the personalities of the men who contributed the science to this incredible logistical nightmare of a project. Leslie Groves is portrayed as being slimmer by Dennehy (yeah, Groves was huge compared to Dennehy) but does a great job showing the relationship between himself, the military logistical desk jockey, and Oppenheimber, the tall slender gentle intellectual physicist.

Nowhere else have I seen a portrayal like this of the nuclear pile created at the University of Chicago squash courts.

I'm begging- please download and seed. I don't have a system that can support it for too long.

Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard leaves Europe, eventually arriving in the United States. With the help of Einstein, he persuades the government to build an atomic bomb. The project is given to no-nonsense Gen. Leslie Groves who selects physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to head the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where the bomb is built. As World War II draws to a close, Szilard has second thoughts about atomic weapons, and policy makers debate how and when to use the bomb.
