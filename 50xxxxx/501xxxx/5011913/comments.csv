PLEASE PLEASE download and seed.  I can't do it for long, and when this sucker dies, it is gone forever.  I actually broke down and bought it for this purpose."

[V],Kuthumi,2009-07-21T16:16Z,"Thank you again. Quality is far better than VHS, no reason to make excuses. We should be happy to have access to such old films."
,hydrogenbomb,2009-08-20T16:11Z,That's great! Thank you for this torrent! I've been searching for it for a long time!! It's by far the most precise drama about the Manhattan Project.
