Ladies and gentlemen, for your consideration:

This torrent contains the complete run of Aircel comics'  Dragonring v1 & v2.

Aircel Comics (a.k.a. Aircel Publishing) started as a Canadian publisher of comic books. Aircel Comics evolved from Aircel Insulation when the government pulled its contract with Aircel Insulation. 

Aircel started with Barry Blair, Dave Cooper, Patrick McEown, and Guang Yap. Illustrators such as Denis Beauvais and creators such as Dale Keown got their start at Aircel. Charles de Lint also scripted several comic books for Aircel in the mid-1980s.

In the beginning (1983), Ottawa-based Aircel focused upon storytelling techniques blending historical & futuristic fantasy from different cultures as the underlying theme for each comic series. The Aircel comic book "style" featured high-quality colour cover illustrations with black-and white-images on newsprint for the interior of the comic book. Samurai, [u][b]Dragonring[/b][/u], and Elflord were the first publications receiving international attention, featuring line-art manga-styled illustrations. 



Thanks to the scanners and the original sources.
