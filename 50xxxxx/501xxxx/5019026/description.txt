Nick Skitz is an Australian DJ and dance music producer. He was born as Nicholas Agamalis and his career in dance music started in the early 1990s.

Since 1996, his Skitzmix series of compilations have become well-known in Australian dance circles for featuring remixes and megamixes of wellknown dance songs and are the best selling DJ compilations in Australia. In late 2001, Skitzmix 10 even reached #9 on the mainstream ARIA Albums Chart alongside artists like Creed, Shaggy and the Bridget Jones' Diary Soundtrack. Skitz has also featured on Ministry of Sound & Wild compilations.

Skitz's track "The Ultimate" has reached #2 on the dance charts in the UK. His first pop hit "Slave to the Music" reached the top 20 in Australia in November 2003 and was a cover of an original song by Twenty 4 Seven.

In 2004, he joined forces with Mark Gable, lead singer of Australian rock band The Choirboys to rework their 1987 Australian hit "Run to Paradise" as a dance track. The song, billed as "Nick Skitz vs. the Choirboys", debuted in the top 20 of the Australian pop charts in July 2004. The single also features a remix by Jason Nevins.

Since 2006, Skitz has released 2 rock compilations called SkitzMetal and SkitzRocks featuring 80s and 90s rock originals like Quiet Riot's "Cum On Feel The Noize" and Scorpion's "Wind Of Change" and some dance remakes of glam rock hits. In July 2007, Skitz released a rock/dance version of David Lee Roth's 80s hit "Just Like Paradise". It reached #58 on the ARIA Physical Sales Chart in Australia.
