Carmilla (1990)

Her unholy friendship...would never die.

Lonely young Marie and her father live on a plantation just before the Civil War. Their placid lives are invaded when they rescue a mysterious woman from a carriage wreck, and soon bodies start turning up with holes in their necks...

After the ravishing Carmilla (Meg Tilly) arrives at a secluded Southern mansion, she soon has Marie (Ione Skye), the young plantation owner's daughter, under her mysterious spell. Then, when a series of grisly murders reveals the beautiful stranger as a bloodthirsty vampire, Marie's father (Roy Dotrice) and a local official (Roddy McDowall) enter into a desperate battle against the nightmarish power of the undead. It's a chilling tale of supernatural passions and timeless horror.
