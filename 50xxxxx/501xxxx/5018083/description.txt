12 Monkeys is a 1995 science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam and
inspired by the French short film La JetÃ©e (1962). 12 Monkeys stars Bruce
Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt and Christopher Plummer. The film
depicts a future world in 2035 devastated by disease, forcing the human
population to live underground. Convict James Cole (Willis) "volunteers" for
time travel duty to gather information in exchange for prison release. When
he first arrives in the past, Cole is arrested and locked up in a psychiatric
hospital, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Stowe), a psychiatrist, and
Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), the insane son of a scientist and virus expert.

After Universal Pictures acquired the rights to remake La JetÃ©e as a fulllength
film, David and Janet Peoples were hired to write the script. Under
Terry Gilliam's direction, Universal granted the filmmakers a $29.5 million
budget, and filming for 12 Monkeys lasted from February to May 1995. The
film was shot mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore, the setting of the story.

The film was released to critical praise and grossed approximately $168
million in worldwide box office totals. Brad Pitt was nominated the Academy
Award for Best Supporting Actor, and won a Golden Globe for his
performance. 12 Monkeys also won and was nominated for various
categories at the Saturn Awards.


Plot


James Cole (Willis) is a convicted criminal living in a grim post-apocalyptic
future. In 1996-1997, the Earth's surface was contaminated by a virus so
deadly that it forced the surviving population to live underground. To earn a
pardon, Cole allows scientists to send him on dangerous missions to the
past to collect information on the virus, thought to be released by a terrorist
organization known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. If possible, he is to
obtain a pure sample of the original virus so a cure can be made.
Throughout the film, Cole is troubled with recurring dreams involving a chase
and a shooting in an airport.
