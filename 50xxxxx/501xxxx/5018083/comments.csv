,rippervanwinkle,2009-10-07T14:37Z,"Thanks for releasing this.  I own the retail region 2 PAL DVD and the quality is so bad, resembling a 1xCD DivX3, that I suspect Universal did actually use monkeys and a broken VCR to master it, though probably only one or two monkeys, not 12, because they are cheap (unlike their crappy discs). 

I'm looking forward to enjoying this in good quality for the first time since I saw it at the cinema on theatre release.  

Thanks again and I owe you a banana. "
,rippervanwinkle,2009-10-11T16:00Z,"Well I downloaded it.....it is better quality than the PAL DVD. It now looks like an average quality DVD instead of VHS or divx3.

Leaving the black bars in the picture area was not a great decision. 

If you like your movies soft, grainy and noisy then Universal is the studio for you!  They really are cheap motherfuckers. "
,aku77,2009-11-06T17:37Z,"tq for the upload. if would please on your future upload to crop out the top & bottom black bar, those are useless bits/data eater. doesn't have to be ""exactly"" 1080 vertical pixels to be true 1080p and should make a clean video rip as well. anyway thanks!! "
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-01-13T16:19Z,"sorry to say but 

4400 Kbps for video

sounds prety poor quality for 1080p HDRip.

Being a 129 min movie this rip should have been more like  8 GB instead of 5.4 GB.


1080p HDRip should be over 6 000 video bitrate.

I rather go for -jonny-'s rip :
