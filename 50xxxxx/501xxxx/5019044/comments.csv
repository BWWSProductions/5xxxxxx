,Giri20,2011-12-04T22:39Z,"Oh God! First time I'm downloading a kids show as an adult and staying away from cartoons for so many years! Downloaded 6 epis for my little cousins because I have fond memories of this show and when I saw this, it made me nostalgic & I too saw the epis! Why aren't there any toons as good as this nowadays!!! All I see are crap for kids on tv!

 Great torrent, thanks for this mate! Gonna download the whole thing and seed twice as much as I download!"
