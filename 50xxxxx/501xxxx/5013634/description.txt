Lano and Woodley (Colin Lane and Frank Woodley) were one of Australia's most successful Australian comedy duos of the 1990s and 2000s. They are also affectionately referred to as 'Col and Frank' or 'The Two Men'. They are perhaps most famous for their stand-up comedy and slapstick theatre, as well as their television show The Adventures of Lano and Woodley, which aired on the ABC network in 1997 and 1999. In 1994 they won the prestigious Edinburgh Fringe Perrier Comedy Award. They have written one book, Housemeeting, published in 1996. Their final show was performed in Melbourne on November 11, 2006. -wikipedia
