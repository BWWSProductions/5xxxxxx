The king turd collection to be exact.

Can't do anything about the mtv/mtv2/vh1 logos.

Music videos included as well."
,muushu,2009-07-26T04:45Z,could you maybe seed this?
,FigNuts1017,2009-07-27T04:00Z,"Suck my nuts sir.

I told you I can only seed at night.

Quit bitching, and wait. It caps at 110 kb's."
,muushu,2009-07-28T04:32Z,fuck you you piece of shit. your not the only one whos finished downloading it. and i asked pretty nicely. fuckin asshole.
,FigNuts1017,2009-07-28T23:46Z,"Trollin' off topic, but what are you talking about? I am the only one seeding this.. the torrent messes up and sometimes says there's 2-3 seeders, when I am the only one. The top downloader is somewhere like 35%"
,muushu,2009-07-29T00:40Z,is it my fault utorrent shows 4-5 seeders?
,FigNuts1017,2009-07-29T04:30Z,"Nah, not your fault, probably pirate bay's tracker.

I promise though, I am the only seeder. and I can only seed for about 6 hours at a time, at 110 kb's, so it may take another 2 weeks or so."
,muushu,2009-08-01T19:18Z,im cool with waiting. thank you for your upload.
,lgarcia87,2009-08-04T10:56Z,"Hey man thank you soo much, I know its so hard when your the only complete seeder (Same case with a 34.7gb Greys Anatomy Torrent), I recommend all other users keep waiting and seeding so it became soon more seeders for this awesome serie"
,lgarcia87,2009-08-04T11:02Z,"also a recommendation FigNuts1017 maybe if your limit your upload during the day, you'll be able to have a decent internet navigation and still seed the torrent, just an opinion... cause that's how I am handling my own torrent."
,FigNuts1017,2009-08-11T23:21Z,"I hate to bust your balls folks, but I am going on vacation this saturday for a week.

I WILL leave my computer on, and this will continue to seed at night, but the weather where I live is insane, it can storm , then be a heatstroke within 20 minutes of each other.

What I am saying is that if my power happens to go out, I don't know if my router will reconfigure, or if utorrent will start back up and auto-seed. If so, there should be many people with this complete by the time I get back.

Cheers, sorry, and thanks for waiting guys! 70%, almost there!"
,FigNuts1017,2009-08-16T11:14Z,"OK Mr Blockhead [original, and amazing name by the way]

You are either a jackass that works for the MPAA and is butthurt by people downloading copyrighted material, a troll, or some ignorant faggot who has no idea what he is talking about.

A)If you don't like it, don't download it. Simple as that. Plenty of other people DO want this, and ARE downloading this at the moment [look at the leechers kid]

B)If you did your homework on this, this isn't my  custom top-of-the-line collection, it came from the King Turd collection. The episodes in this DVD series have the logos stuck on the screen, so don't go bashing on me saying I edited the files when all I did was merely rip the files DIRECTLY from the DVD.

Not even Mike Judge has the originals anymore you ignorant fuckbag.

Good day, 1 less leacher wasting up my bandwidth I can spend on someone who will appreciate this torrent."
,FigNuts1017,2009-08-22T18:40Z,"Sorry guys, I come home from vacation tonight [power must have gone out.] 

So this torrent will be active again, I didn't leave you guys high and dry."
,FigNuts1017,2009-08-22T18:45Z,"Also, ignore block. There are no viruses in this torrent.

He is just a moron."
,ghettowizard,2009-10-04T00:44Z,"Ive downloaded this once before, its the best beavis and butthead collection on TPB ive found and well worth the wait."
,Primon,2009-10-07T14:36Z,"muushu you're a fucking moron, he's the original seeder.  And Blockhead, you haven't uploaded a single thing you sorry bitch.  Who the hell are you to bitch about seeding rates?  How many torrents have you ever seeded to a 1:1 ratio?  If you said any more than 0, I'd have to call you a lying piece of shit.  Either way, you're still a piece of shit. 

Long live the seeders.  Thanks FigNuts1017.  Doesn't this have a Primus song?  Maybe that's the Mike Judge version I'm thinking about.  I don't mean in the show either, Primus did a music video for a song about B&B.  J/W, again, thanks for this badass compilation."
,Primon,2009-10-07T14:44Z,"Come to think of it, how fucking old are you?  Most of us have to pay for service.  Your parents don't just get Comcast because they live in a house.  It's not like junkmail."
,ST3V30,2009-10-10T16:39Z,Just started d/l....dont pay any attention to some of the idiots on here....some of us are thankful......thanks
,zaiger,2009-10-13T06:13Z,"Fignuts1017: You are the man, fuck those butthurt douchebags. I will seed this one for a very long time."
,FigNuts1017,2009-10-19T07:33Z,"Glad you guys like it.

Keep up the good work seeders, I sincerely appreciate it!"
,Eyemh8,2009-11-04T03:40Z,Thanks FigNuts this is bad ass!!
,Pothedd,2010-01-25T16:03Z,"I noticed you said music videos included.
Are they in their proper places?
Right between the episodes?
Because that's what I want.
Tell me it's so."
,FigNuts1017,2010-01-25T21:35Z,"@Pot

Yes. I never really much cared for that style of the music videos [wish they would have been separate].. but yeah, they are in the middle of each episode."
,Dockin,2010-02-03T03:48Z,"how come im the only one getting a 'undf' codec problem. I googled it and it said that there is no way of downloading the codec... HOW IS EVERYBODY ELSE ABLE TO VIEW THESE VIDEOS?!?! my message says ""No suitable decoder module:
VLC does not support the audio or video format ""undf"". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this."" i also tried windows media player and realtime player... please help"
,FigNuts1017,2010-02-03T08:16Z,"@Dockin, uhh.. that's the first time I've seen that error..

The only thing I can think of, is uninstall any video-codec pack you may have, and re-install VLC.

Or give the KLite-Media codec pack a try. It comes with Media Player Classic, which works really good as well."
,Dockin,2010-02-04T22:57Z,"found the codec, thanks for the help!"
