Last Call with Carson Daly - June 9, 2009

Carson dedicates the whole show today to Green Day with musical appearances by the band for the rest of the week.

Guests: the Grammy winning worldwide punk rock musical phenomenon that is Green Day. Some interesting comments by industry analysts about the band's rise since the 90s, a couch interview with the musicians in the Last Call studio (ever see a drummer french-kiss a monkey?), and a performance of a song from their new best-selling album 21st Century Breakdown.

Note
A public release of Jimmy Kimmel Live could not be found for this date.
