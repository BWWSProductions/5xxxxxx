Late Night with Jimmy Fallon - June 8, 2009

Jimmy opens for the new iPhone conference, and bombs as a nerd comic.
Episode 5 of 7th Floor West (an "hommage" to The Hills)

Guests: morning talk show host and now producer of reality series Kelly Ripa (she licks a soozaphone... make your own joke), the actor Mark-Paul Gosselaar of Raising The Bar (his appearance provokes a kind of merging between Late Night and Gosselaar's old hangout Saved By The Bell), and the world beat duo from Mali (and some friends) Amadou & Mariam (note the great work by the guys on the drum and electric bass behind the melodic drone of the piece).

Note
A public release of Jimmy Kimmel Live and Last Call with Carson Daly could not be found for this date.
