ONE seeder would be nice.
thks"
,renumeratedfrog,2009-07-22T17:50Z,There's only one seeder because it's still being initialized. The problem is that my provider is throttling me so it's going to take a few days to upload the whole thing.
,}{,2009-12-17T12:40Z,"There are three parts here. The sound on the first is screwed up. Iy's quiet and distorted. You can understand it, but only just.

The sound on the second is better, and the third has perfect sound."
,Evg222,2010-02-21T15:22Z,"It would be just great if somebody also uploaded ""Eastern Philosophy"" series by the same studio."

,zygarch,2012-04-02T18:18Z,This is a really good series. SO glad to find it here. Trying to watch it on Utoob in 10min disjointed parts makes you want to scream. Thanks renumeratedfrog! Hope someone is still seeding...
