,tramber8803,2009-07-24T12:51Z,"stupid noobs. Resident Evil 5 will come out for the PC Platform this July. Check out NVIDIA.com for the original benchmark file.

Devil may Cry 4 came out on the PC as well and even the 4th installation of the Resident Evil series is also on the PC. So why argue that RE5 is not also for the PC? Noobs..."
,sdfasdad,2009-07-24T22:39Z,Lolled at morons and look forward to RE5 on PC... now all we need is GOW2 and Halo 3 (both from former PC developers who have forgotten their heritage - traitors)

Software Description

A benchmark utility for Resident Evil 5

This utility initially was released to test out the performance of Resident Evil 5 using the Nvidia's 3D Vision stereoscopic technology, it's however not a requirement to check it out.

From the ashes of old conflicts, a new terror arises. The Umbrella Corporation and its crop of lethal viruses have been destroyed and contained. But a new, more dangerous threat has emerged. Years after surviving the events in Raccoon City, Chris Redfield has been fighting the scourge of bio-organic weapons all over the world.

Now a member of the Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSSA), Chris is sent to Africa to investigate a biological agent that is transforming the populace into aggressive and disturbing creatures. Joined by another local BSSA agent, Sheva Alomar, the two must work together to solve the truth behind the disturbing turn of events. Featuring a revolutionary new co-op mode of gameplay, Resident Evil 5 will let players experience fear together as terror moves out of the shadows and into the light of day. "
