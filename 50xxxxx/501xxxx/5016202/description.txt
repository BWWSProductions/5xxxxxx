Description:

A team of researchers, architects and engineers investigates the improbable construction of Greece's wondrous temple, the Parthenon -- erected without any building plans or blueprints in the shockingly fast time frame of eight or nine years. This absorbing "Nova" special revisits the halcyon days of ancient Greece, where a group of more than 200 masons brought their craftsmanship to bear on this architectural miracle.
