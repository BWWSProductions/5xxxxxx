,TheDink,2009-07-21T14:52Z,The best for burning dvds is ConvertXtoDvd in my opinion. Hope this helps. TheDink

you disgust me."
,brixton1,2009-07-21T20:24Z,"metalcore!!! Your an arse, nobody asked your opinion so keep it to yourself.  If people want to download a cam then they can, that's the choice that's given to them.  They don't need your useless comments or your personnal opinion.  IF YOU'VE NOTHING CONSTRUCTIVE TO SAY THEN SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!"
