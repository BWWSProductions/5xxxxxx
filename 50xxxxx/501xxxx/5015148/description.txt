Amazon.Co.Uk Review

A Major Artist In Ireland, David Gray Has A Loyal But Somewhat Smaller Following Throughout The Rest Of The World. Since His 1994 Debut Album A Century Ends, He Has Consistently Produced Quality, Folk-Tinged Songs That Showcase His One Major Talent--A Raw Yet Melodic Voice. White Ladder Marks Something Of A Departure From His Usual Fare, As It Sees Him Embracing A More Modern Sound, Adding Interesting Beats And Electronic Sounds To The More Traditional Acoustic Guitar And Piano. In Trying To Widen His Appeal, He Risks Alienating His Fan Base, But Tracks Like "This Year's Love" And "My Oh My" Should Keep Everybody Happy.
