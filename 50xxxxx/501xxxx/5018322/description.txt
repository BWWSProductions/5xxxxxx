A (very) tiny IRCd sockbot by Vulcan. At just 9kb vSOCKd is anything but your typical sockbot. It features rock solid connectivity with auto-connect, reconnect, join, nick in use change and ping-out check. Version update checker, revenge kick, auto identify and even a built in multi sock filler/flooder all in a package so small and blindingly fast and lightweight it will run on any computer system big or small without notice.
