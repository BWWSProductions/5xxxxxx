http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5068683/History.Of.The.World.Part.I.1981.1080p.BluRay.x264-CiNEFiLE
or that's a relabeled version of this, but the result is the same:

There are a few places where there's a noticeable skip in the sound, but nothing that would drop it below an A: 8/10.

HOWEVER, sound starts dropping out and skipping badly at 0:50:20, the Last Supper scene, and probably 80% of the sound in this scene is missing entirely. Sound comes back fully at 0:52:16.

Drops out again at 1:02:55, and skips badly again until 1:04:40."
