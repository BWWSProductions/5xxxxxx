Easy to use Linux, small but complete OS especially written to revitalize older laptops. Fits the space limitations of newer SSD baby laptops as well. Auto detects most/all hardware and settings. Make your own liveCD or liveUSB. Burn "open" CDs. Takes up less than 1 Gigabyte. Persistence is built in! Run setup just once, then automatically stores system info on same USB/CD or leaves a small file on a harddrive. Graphical User Interface; little/no Linux experience needed. Extremely user friendly. No installation ever required -- keep your Windows installed, run Linux any time you want. Perfect for users wanting to test drive the safety and flexibility of Linux.
