I posted a comment on emak212's torrent for Slightly Stoopid's ""Everything you need"" explaining that I had trouble burning the .cue with ImgBurn because the .cue tries to load a single file, but the audio is actually separated tracks. The .cue in this torrent gave me the same trouble, so I edited it (as I did with the other torrent) and was able to get the CD burned. I've put my edited .cue sheet here: http://www.pastebay.net/1069400 You can click download and then rename the .txt file extension to .cue to use it to burn the CD if you are having the same problem I had. I can't guarantee anything since I'm not the expert on this, so I recommend burning to a rewritable blank disc first to make sure it works."
