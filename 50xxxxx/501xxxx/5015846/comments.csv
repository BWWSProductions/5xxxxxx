,MarcFirewing,2009-07-27T04:15Z,Does it matter whether the discs are +R or -R?
,jester_msc,2009-07-27T16:14Z,I've always used verbatim dvd+r dl . I tried a couple cheaper discs like memorex when i started but they don't work. Just stick with the dvd+r dl cuz i know they work.

,jester_msc,2009-08-24T04:26Z,when your done downloading don't delete the file from your torrent software. it'll continue to upload (seed) that's really it. 
,jackass142,2009-08-29T21:03Z,this might be a bit of a nOOby question but. 1 work on a Mac OSX without running bootcamp? 2. allow me to play these games on live without being blocked and end up with a banned xbox
,jester_msc,2009-08-31T23:33Z,I have no clue if these will run on mac. I don't have one so i'm not sure. and i have had my xbox flashed for around a year and have not had any issues playing on line. this is a stealth version and at the time is not detectable by microsoft
,ColbyCannon,2009-10-10T02:57Z,I haven't re-flashed my 360 but this should help - Thanks a lot Jester
,PussyLicker90,2009-12-19T12:54Z,Do I need a PC to do all these? I only got a lap top.
,jester_msc,2010-01-22T12:10Z,You can do this from a laptop with the right hardware. Which means an esata port for most drives and a connectivity kit for the lite-on drives.
,hamzillagod,2010-02-13T06:25Z,"quick question... is it ""sata"" or ""e-sata""??? and second of all, i have a laptop without the ports, so i know all you have to do is buy an adapter who link your sata to a USB port. look it up on ebay or somin like that..."

,bigc87,2011-03-04T23:52Z,how do i use it on my xbox all it lets me do is install it to my computer
,AoF,2011-10-11T22:04Z,"I'm amazed at all the slow people with their stupid comments. Like the guy who said ""all I need is a pc? I only got a laptop""... Seriously?"
