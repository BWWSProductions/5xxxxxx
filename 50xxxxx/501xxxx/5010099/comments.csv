,t2BeDLaM,2009-07-26T15:24Z,"downloaded and watched.
this is NOT an unaried episode.
this is the episode where the FBI gets wise to whats going on and they program Caroline to kill him.
this was like the 6th or 7th in the series."

It is the unaired pilot.  Test audiences found it ""too confusing and dark,"" so Whedon & Co. shot a new pilot.  They tried to salvage the unaired pilot to use as a later episode, but were unsuccessful.  Footage from the unaired pilot was used in other episodes, so parts of it will be familiar to anyone who has seen the series."

For those who look for subtitles, here a good link with subs already in synch with the video.

,registeretc,2009-08-19T09:01Z,THANK YOU!
,dixiexcd,2009-10-02T19:40Z,My advice dont watch this one. It contains parts of future episodes and spoils the shows.
