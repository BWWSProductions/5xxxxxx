Will let it go for a while on my laptop and continue seeding it so other people can watch this amazing anime!"

,iwantmypot,2011-09-06T06:33Z,"@shauntay0248 - That happens when you watch a 4:3 ratio video on a widescreen. If you want it to stretch and distort the video, there should be a setting for that somewhere in your video player."
,TheDoubleP,2011-09-24T05:06Z,"I have a full version of both Clannad AND Clannad afterstory! :)
