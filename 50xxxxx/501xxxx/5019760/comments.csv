Congratulations!. 
Luckly I  found this torrent  yesterday.and I was surprised by the quality and the speed of download!
Started to browse for you other torrents and found a three-set that interested me very much, but one of them has no seeds. 
Is it possible to seed this one:

[GAY] Boys Behaving Badly: Distracted By Love ((MictrmbL))
thepiratebay.org/torrent/3838832/%5BGAY%5D_Boys_Behaving_Badly__Distracted_By_Love_((MictrmbL)) 

Thanks in advance

I stopped uploading the series due to very little interest. The Corbin Fisher series on the other hand has been extremely successful, and if this kind of interest continues, I will continue to upload more videos, as I have about 60% of all their videos. If you should though find one of my Corbin Fisher videos with no seeds and you would like to download it, just let me know and I will reseed the torrent."

Dear mate 

Thank you for you kind answer. 

I can feel what you felt when you lost files in a crash: last Sunday I lost a 500GB HD! Crashed! 

I lost almost 350 Gb of data. I  tried everything I know but it was impossible to recover any data, unless I would pay a very high fee to an especialized firm, so I gave up.

I  already replaced the HD and,  as I happen to have a listing of it's lost content, I'll start downloading all over!

Back to the subject, I also enjoy Corbin Fisher's videos and I'll be many of your torrents, and I thank you beforehand!

Best regards
