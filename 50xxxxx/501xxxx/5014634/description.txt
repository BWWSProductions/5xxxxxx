Fireworks CS4 is a hybrid imaging and rapid-prototyping application with an enhanced toolset and a greater variety of options. In Fireworks CS4 Essential Training, Jim Babbage demonstrates how to navigate and customize the workspace in this design and production hub. He then provides a primer on the array of graphics that can be created and combined in Fireworks, including bitmap and vector art, layered Photoshop and Illustrator files, and files in the native Fireworks format, enhanced PNG. He demonstrates creative uses of text, animation, and effects. Jim discusses how to generate optimized web graphics as well as entire interactive prototypes based on CSS, HTML, PDF, and AIR. This training is intended for those who are new to Fireworks or who are seeking insights into the techniques made possible by the latest version.
