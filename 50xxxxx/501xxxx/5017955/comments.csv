if anyone wants it its up for grabs. i hope i am not insulting pristine."

,80313131,2012-06-21T15:04Z,"started 3 days ago, and i haven't got a single kb. down yet,
(6 seeders and 2 leechers)
apparently no one is seeding this one,
maybe i should start looking for another upload.

since the site changed to magnet link only, 
i noticed the seeders moral left with the torrent link.

personally i don't care much about the link, 
but there has been a significantly drop i seeders lately.."
