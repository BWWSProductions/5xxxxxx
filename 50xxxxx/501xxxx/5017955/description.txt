After witnessing a murder involving a corrupt cop (Rosie Perez) and a drug kingpin (Gary Cole), straitlaced pothead Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) must go on the run with his dealer (James Franco, in a Golden Globe-nominated role) to escape the wrath of vengeance-minded criminals. Acclaimed indie director David Gordon Green steers this stoner buddy comedy, penned by Rogen and his Superbad co-writer, Evan Goldberg.
