,bluecup,2009-08-03T06:34Z,"You can boot this from cd, so if you have a newer version already, I'm not sure how you can install this.

Plus, it comes with no install instructions. Not worth the dl."
,bluecup,2009-08-03T06:35Z,I meant to say that you can't boot from cd. Can NOT.
,tekka1988,2009-08-04T21:02Z,"This is a nonbootable version of windows, it's rubbish, dont download it...big waste of time"
,Huang88,2009-08-05T11:07Z,"You guys are so dumb!I mean this is not for booting this is for use in a virtual machine or direct upgrade ONLY,so now I hope you understand.
BTW nice torrent lots a seeds.

Avira Anti-vir has detected a Trojan!

E:\Windows XP home edition with serial + crack\Windows XP home edition with Serial + crack.zip
  [0] archive: ZIP
    --> winxp/Crack/crack.exe
      [RESULTAT]  contains Trojan TR/Spy.18089"
,ThePlatypus,2010-07-30T07:37Z,"The trojan is a false positve. An antivirus program looks for .exe's that have no install directory but still modify files on your system. And yes this is a bootable version, just because its not an .iso doesn't mean it won't work, I booted this on my old machine just fine, now I'm downloading again so I can use the ativation patcher."
