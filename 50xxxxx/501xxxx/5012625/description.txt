"You're a Jerk" is a song by hip-hop duo New Boyz from their EP Skinny Jeans and a Mic. It comes with a dance called " Jerkin'". The song does not contain profanity, but the word "Retard" is used in Ben J's verse.

The video, directed by Matt Alonzo, starts with people breakdancing. The scene then cuts to the New Boyz in beds with girls. Then, Legacy gets a text message reading "You're a jerk". It then cuts to more people dancing on the street. Tyga and Paul Wall make cameos in the video. The video contains dancing by popular jerkin' crews The Power Ranger$ & Action Figures. The song samples "Scotty" by Fabo of D4L.

New Boyz is a hip hop duo from Los Angeles. They debuted with the single "You're a Jerk", taken from their 2009 EP Skinny Jeans and a Mic. The song currently has peaked at #32 on the Billboard Hot 100.

While there is arguably nothing new under the sun, there are times when the recycled past takes on new relevance and meaning within a different context. Enter the New Boyz and their revamping of â€œthe Jerk,â€ a regional phenomena of the 90â€™s perpetuated by L.A. street culture and house-party connoisseurs alike. Armed with a minimalist beat and a hip(ster)-hop fashion sense, the summer-ready single â€œYouâ€™re A Jerkâ€ has been gaining momentum in Southern California, propelling the Victorville duo into national prominence. And the Web is watching, as hundreds of user-generated videos are surfacing on sites likeof youth across the nation imitating the acrobatic and fancy footwork. "You're A Jerk" music video by New Boyz is tiiiiiighhhttt (a Favorite)! Damn, this song is fresh off the streetz! (June, 2009) Although its been out on the streetz for a couple of months, it should get your attention. Why? Think of it as a "oldie but goodie".
