Sell Sell Sell - David Gray [1996]


Amazon.com

When It Was Originally Released In 1995, Sell Sell Sell Was Such A Commercial Failure That David Gray's Record Company Didn't Think Twice About Dropping Him From Its Roster. But Because Of The Welsh Singer-Songwriter's International Breakthrough, White Ladder (Recorded In His Own Bedroom And Independently Released), This Transitional Third Album Gets Another Airing. New Converts Will Have A Hard Time Identifying The Lovelorn Folk Singer Of White Ladder In The Sleek Surroundings Here, But Sell Sell Sell Still Offers Detectable Snatches Of Emerging Talent In The Soft-Spoken "Gutters Full Of Rain," In The Straight-Laced Rock Of "Everytime," And In The Curiously Poignant "Late Night Radio." Ultimately, It's Enticing, If Not Essential.

*** I Bought the disc in a casing without covers and I downloaded the front and back covers from allcdcovers.com.
