,suewolf,2009-07-22T05:18Z,This smells like a fake from an unknown first-time poster (Osama? That should be a clue). Use the link by roddyf52 above since it is real (from the developer himself) and it works.
,kenhru,2009-07-23T09:04Z,@campus62: May be a stupid question but I don't understand why do you download something if you don't know what it is?
,Hakri,2009-07-24T06:35Z,"The both iATKOS v7 we can find on this site are the same.
But when I attempt to boot on the DVD of iATKOS (*ISO), I have a screen of a loading, then a message said me to press any key, I press, a white background with a grey Apple logo appear then... I finish on Grub who ask me if I want to boot on Fedora or Windows Seven (both OS are installed on my computer)...

My computer is a MSI VR705-034, somebody know why it won't boot on the DVD ?"
