[V],2nafish,2009-07-22T03:16Z,"Saving Abel, V Factory and Chrisette Michele all have videos but I don't have those yet. The Rich Girl video I can probably get that one and I should be able to get your Jonas Brother's videos. Also your Kristina DeBarge video just became available so I can get that one too. "
