├óΓé¼┼ôDEVILISHLY DELIGHTFUL AND DWLICIOUSLY WICKED
A MUST ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ SEE FOR ALL.├óΓé¼┬¥

Sarah has always been different.  So as the newcomer at St. Benedict├óΓé¼Γäós Academy, she immediately falls in with the high school outsiders.  But these girls won├óΓé¼Γäót settle for being a group of powerless misfits.  They have discovered THE CRAFT, and they are going to use it.
Critics are spellbound, calling THE CRAFT ├óΓé¼┼ôslick, shrewd, touching, funny and most appropriately, downright mean.├óΓé¼┬¥
