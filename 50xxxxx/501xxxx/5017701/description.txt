From Wiki:


Heavy D (born May 24, 1967) is the stage name of Dwight Errington Myers, an American rapper and former leader of Heavy D & the Boyz, a hip hop group which included G-Whiz (Glen Parrish), "Trouble" T. Roy (Troy Dixon), and Eddie F (born Edward Ferrell). The group maintained a sizable audience in the United States through most of the 1990s.[1] He has recently ventured into reggae music and can now be described as a reggae fusion artist.


Myers was born on May 24, 1967, in Jamaica. His family moved to Mount Vernon, New York, when he was a young child.

Heavy D & the Boyz were the first group signed to Uptown Records; their debut, Living Large, was released in 1987 (see 1987 in music). The album was a commercial success, though Big Tyme (1989, 1989 in music) was a breakthrough that included four hits. Trouble T. Roy died at age 22 in a fall on July 15, 1990, in Indianapolis (see 1990 in music). Dixon's passing led to a tribute on the follow-up platinum album, Peaceful Journey (1991, 1991 in music). Pete Rock & CL Smooth created a tribute to Trouble T. Roy called "They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)" which is regarded as a hip-hop classic.[1]

Heavy D & the Boyz gained even more fame by singing the theme song for the television program In Living Color and also MADtv, and Heavy D performed the rap on Michael Jackson's hit single "Jam." However, the group's next album, Blue Funk, was not marketed as well as their previous albums[citation needed], but is widely viewed as an underrated gem.[citation needed] Heavy D then began focusing on his acting, appearing in the television shows Roc and Living Single before returning the music charts with Nuttin' But Love (1994). After appearing in the off-Broadway play Riff Raff at Circle Repertory Company, Heavy D returned to recording with the hit Waterbed Hev.[1] In 2005, the Will Smith movie "Hitch" played the song "Now That We Have Love" during the ending scene where a wedding party does a line dance, and gave Heavy D & the Boyz a lot of exposure, sending many viewers to the web to find out more about the song and the group.[citation needed]

He then appeared in the motion picture 'Life", before joining the cast of the television show Boston Public. In 2002, Heavy D had a supporting role as an FBI agent alongside Omar Epps in the movie adaptation of Dave Barry's novel Big Trouble. In 2003 he starred in the supporting cast for the sit-com The Tracy Morgan Show as Bernard. In 1997, Heavy D collaborated with B.B. King on his duets album Deuces Wild rapping in the song "Keep It Coming." He also has a small role in the 1999 Oscar-nominated movie "The Cider House Rules (film)". In 2005, Heavy D appeared as Sid in the hit Fox drama Bones, as the owner and bartender at Wong Fu's. In 2006, he appeared in the motion picture, Step Up,as Omar.[1]

Heavy D has now released a new reggae album via itunes, called Vibes.

Heavy D reportedly has a son who is currently releasing mix tapes as a rapper.





Peaceful Journey 1991


Peaceful Journey is the third album by rap group, Heavy D & the Boyz. The album was released on July 2, 1991, for MCA Records and was produced by Pete Rock, DJ Eddie F, Teddy Riley, Marley Marl and DJ Clash. This marked the group's first album since the death of member, Trouble T Roy, who died almost a year before the album's release, and several on the album pay tribute to him. Though not as successful as the group's previous album, Big Tyme, the album was able to reach Platinum status and made it to number 21 on the Billboard 200 and number 5 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The following singles also charted: "Now That We Found Love" (UK #2, US #11), "Is It Good to You", "Don't Curse" and "Peaceful Journey", which sampled the bass line from This Place Hotel by The Jacksons. Guests on the album include Big Daddy Kane, Grand Puba, Kool G. Rap, Q-Tip, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Daddy Freddy and K-Ci & JoJo.
