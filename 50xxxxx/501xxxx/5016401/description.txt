 This is a very interesting band that has come out from the very diverse music scene developing in TExas lately. A very unique piece of new wave/mimimal/synth punk, something that I have really been fond of since I first heard it. IAm going to try and do a few little torrents before I go off. The larger ones haven't had the burden carried very far by those who've gotten all of it. I seeded it over and over, but none stayed over. So, a few small ones are what Iam going to put along. Enjoy:)
