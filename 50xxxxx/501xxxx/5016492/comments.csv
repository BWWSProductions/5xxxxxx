,rc71,2009-07-23T18:14Z,"Question.

In the scene where the Myca is yelling up at the nun, you can see something under her lips.  They look like venom sacks or something.  I thought her lips were all puffy because of collagen injections.  Anyone know what the deal is?"

[T],despo1ler,2009-07-29T17:44Z,"I think the confusion over episode numbers with this series is because a lot of people have called the double episode pilot episode 1 and 2 but it is in fact only episode 1, resonance, which most people have labelled as episode 3 is in fact episode 2, Magnetism is episode 3 and this weeks episode, titled Claudia, is now episode 4, maybe every1 who has posted this series might consider editing their posts and changing the title to the right numbers before we get too far into the series with different people all calling the same epides different numbers. No wonder I missed E02, I made the same mistake as every1 else :) "

,mrkennedy,2009-08-05T14:36Z,"The first episode was a double episode, therefore the confusion about episode numbers. "
