,ailinde,2009-09-15T20:56Z,"For those that don't know instead of mounting it onto a disc you can instead use a virtual daemon http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/home install it, tell it how many virtual cds you want it to see, mount the iso/cso and it'll run the iso/cso as though it were a real cd."
,Nighty1337,2009-10-07T02:09Z,"Nice upload and nice DL speed :D,I'll seed it until I upload atleast 50GB ;)"
,user0a1,2009-11-18T23:55Z,"To lysergic.acid:

You shouldn't have patched the game. Just install it and mount fake CD (RONX.iso) as written in ""Blazez3212 Read Me.txt"" (skip unpacking, it is ready to use)."
