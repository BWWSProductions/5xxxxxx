Storyline: At Dulles International Airport, John McClane is waiting 
for his wife Holly to land. A while after he arrives at the airport, he feels that something's wrong. 
He follows two men into the luggage room. They both try to kill him, but he kills one and the other
gets away. He gets the dead guy's fingerprints and faxes them to his friend Al Powell over in L.A. 
The man's name was Oswald Cochrane, and he had been officially dead for two years. John then realizes 
that someone is about to screw around with the airport, and he's correct. Colonel Stuart, a man who got 
"canned by congress", as McClane says it, and his team of ex-commandos have taken control of the airport, 
shutting down the Instrument Landing System and the runways. He then threatens to cause plane crashes 
unless the plane carrying Ramon Esperanza from Valverde (the fictitious country used in Commando (1985)) 
lands at a runway of his designation. The Chief Engineer and the airport's S.W.A.T. team unsuccessfully 
try to restore communications with the planes above. Because of this, Stuart crashes a plane. McClane must 
now try to defeat the terrorists and save his wife before her plane, and all the other planes, run 
out of fuel.

Storyline: John McClane is now almost a full-blown alcoholic and is suspended from the NYPD. 
But when a bomb goes off in the Bonwit Teller Department Store the police go insane trying to figure out what's going on. 
Soon, a man named Simon calls and asks for McClane. Simon tells Inspector Walter Cobb that McClane is going to play a game 
called "Simon Says". He says that McClane is going to do the tasks he assigns him. If not, he'll blow off another bomb. 
With the help of a Harlem electrician, John McClane must race all over New York trying to figure out the frustrating puzzles

Storyline: When someone hacks into the computers at the FBI's Cyber Crime Division; 
the Director decides to round up all the hackers who could have done this. When he's told that because it's the 4th 
of July most of their agents are not around so they might have trouble getting people to get the hackers. So he 
instructs them to get local PD'S to take care of it. And one of the cops they ask is John McClane who is tasked with 
bringing a hacker named Farrell to the FBI. But as soon as he gets there someone starts shooting at them. McClane 
manages to get them out but they're still being pursued. And it's just when McClane arrives in Washington that the 
whole system breaks down and chaos ensues.
