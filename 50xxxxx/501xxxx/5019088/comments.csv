yeah, cuz block busters all have so much to offer, right?  i don't know how this movie is, but it can't be any worse than 80% of the blockbuster crap out there.

thanks uploader (try saying it sometime, and then go find your crappy compressed rips of movies, except for HD blockbuster cash cows)"
,Fuckault,2009-07-28T04:28Z,I hate how people bitch about DTS.  Its worth the size for those who have 5.1.  otherwise go download audioconverter.exe to convert.
,caliwillbemine,2009-08-05T15:27Z,"DTS is awesome for home theaters!
this movie is great, buying it for sure"
,AxelVanHorn,2009-08-15T10:24Z,"Some people are a joke,

Compress to get small, avoid DTS...

Are you Racist? Some of us have decent systems here!

What the fuck man? Whats next?
You maybe ask to go back to 700mb rips because you run out of disk space?"
