Thanks to uploader!"

look for the pink and green skulls, these are trusted users.

Don't d/l CAM or TELESYNC as the quality is usually shit. If u are desparate to see a film that is only available in CAM or TELESYNC format then look out for screen shots links and judge for yourself.

Finally D/L Bitcomet for downloading torrents, never crashes always does what you ask it to do.

Enjoy!
