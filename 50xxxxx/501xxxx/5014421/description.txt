The first of many trips back down memory lane.  Recorded in early 2009 and late 2008 using anthems from all the big happy hardcore parties in the mid- to late 90s, you'll recognize such hits as Shooting Star, Eyeopner, Heart of Gold, and many, many, more!  Mixed using vinyl timecodes and a pair of Vestax PDX-2000s with Torq Connectiv timecode vinyl solutions.
