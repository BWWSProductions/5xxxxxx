"discography" means a LIST of recordings, not a collection.

I've been meaning to upload this for a while, but just keep forgetting.
This replaces the previous THTF garageband-sourced multitracks I have uploaded.


As you probably remember, THTF was the first track that Trent officially released as multi-tracks for remixing.
Trent only released it as a Garageband project (for Macintosh)
Several people copied the contents of the Garageband disc image, but that was only isolated samples, so it was difficult for amateurs to assemble remixes from them.
Mac owners, using Garageband, had the advantage that the original track was pre-assembled.

What I have done is borrow a Mac with Garageband and export each track individually, without normalising the volume.
When these tracks are loaded into any audio editor, they will play the original track. (The same way that later NIN multitracks have worked)
Shame on Macintosh owners for not doing this themselves years ago.


I've also included my own simple mix-down and instrumental versions on the tracks, done in garageband and again in Audacity - the result should be more or less the same.


As always, these files are compressed as FLAC.
If you haven't worked out FLAC yet: google it.
