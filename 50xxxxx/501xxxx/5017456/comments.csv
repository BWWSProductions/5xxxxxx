,revolutionary1904,2009-07-26T14:11Z,Made my day to see this on PB. You wouldn't believe how many times I've searched this site for his music over the years.
,delpieric,2009-08-14T01:18Z,"Omg. I think I love you in a distant, twisted way. Anyway... I had a song by Mr. Bogle that I had received from a p2p-program years ago which was titled ""Where Stands Scotland Now?""

After numerous searches on the internet and no results I begin to wonder whether it's actually his song (or I would, if the song didn't contain allusions to Peebles, Scotland, and Australia), does anyone know the real title of that song (I assume it must exist but under another name)?"
,delpieric,2009-08-14T01:20Z,"(If I can get this piece of information, if so from Bogle himself, I promise to instantly order all of his work)."
