Your Funeral... My Trial was remastered and reissued on April 27, 2009 as a collector's edition CD/DVD set. The CD features the original 8-song vinyl double EP's track listing and track order, while ""Scum"" is featured as a bonus audio track on the accompanying DVD.

Thanks scottyscum for the upload."
