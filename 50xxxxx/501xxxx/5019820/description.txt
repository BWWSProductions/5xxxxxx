This is a re-upload of a video I previously posted last month.
I've included some extra applications you can try, plus the necessary files needed to play the new Wii Sports Resort.

The installation instructions are as follows...

README FIRST.txt
----------------
Follow the video instructions to install 'The Homebrew Channel' and 'USB Backup Loader'.  Once installed you can install the extra applications by following the instructions below...


STEP 1 
------

Copy the contents of the 'SD_CARD2' folder to your SD card which you should have already done when you installed 'The Homebrew Channel' then insert it in to your Wii.


STEP 2
------

Run 'The Homebrew Channel' then run 'WAD Manager' then install 'USB Loader GX-ULNR-r516.wad' by pressing '+' on the Wiimote.

This will install the 'USB Loader GX' on the Channel Menu.

There are also other USB Loaders in the apps folder which you can try.

I've also included 'WBFS Manager' PC application which is used to transfer ISOs to your USB external device.

'NeoGammer' is also included which is used to play the new 'Wii Sports Resort' game.  Simply follow the instructions which can be found in the 'Wii Sports Resort Instructions.txt' file.
