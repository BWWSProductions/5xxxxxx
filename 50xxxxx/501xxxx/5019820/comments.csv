,shahane,2009-08-04T02:05Z,"I have this working well on system 3.4

Now Wii Fit (official copy purchased with the board) wants me to update my Menu.  Should I do this?  Or will it kill me?

Should I...

- update, then reinstall this?

- uninstall everything, update, then re-install?

- find another way around, or defeat the update?

I'm guessing that more and more new games will ask me to update and eventually may truly need the updates.  Or am I mistaken?

Thanks!"

,djchewmacca,2009-11-04T09:30Z,Don't use this if you have a Wii with serial number starting with LEH2xxxxxxx.  I recently bricked one.  It was also on System Menu 4.1.
