,steve190669,2009-07-24T10:25Z,can confirm the fuckyounicole.com is a scam  site wanting your cell phone number to get password
,Vakz1,2009-07-24T13:09Z,"afraid my internet went down a few minutes after i uploaded the torrent, but it should be working again now.

Also, it's most definitly not a scam site, you don't have to fill in a phone number anywhere, unless you try to do it the ""skip and fill in this to get pics""-way"
,steve190669,2009-07-24T22:25Z,"have a try dude , u gets a zip file and a readme file stating u have to imput your cell phone number to get password !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Vakz1,2009-07-24T23:58Z,"well, i got the pics just last night, and as you can see, this torrent contain the pics from that site, so i'm pretty sure there's no zip and readme."
