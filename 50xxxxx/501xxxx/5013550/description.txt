While value stream mapping is now accepted as a tool for identifying waste, future state mapping presents greater challenges. Achieving the full implementation pictured in an enhanced future state map is far more complex than its development. Hoshin Kanri can help. This method encourages employees to incorporate performance metrics to reach the root cause of problems before searching for solutions and teaches them how to promote the achievement of sustainable implementation. Though developed in Japan this technique is based on Demingâ€™s classic PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) improvement cycle. A number of Japanese Deming Prize winners credit Hoshin Kanri as being key to their business success.
