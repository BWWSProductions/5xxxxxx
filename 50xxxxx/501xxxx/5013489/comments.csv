,absitomen,2009-09-04T00:15Z,@tpbsuxx I too am an atheist. But you cannot completely disagree with something unless you fully understand it. I dont believe in god because there is no evidence that would justify a belief. Christians say that the bible is proof. I read it. It isn't. 
,macgyver16502,2009-10-25T13:47Z,"The bible is mythology, history, and prophesy...
Nothing more, nothing less...
Belief requires neither proof nor evidence...
Whence the word ""FAITH""...
Religion is group belief...
So, you stick to your belief that there is no higher power... and I'll stick to mine, that there is...
BTW, you say there is no evidence to support the existence of God; what evidence is there to indicate the non-existence on God?

,heart-vail-92,2011-03-23T11:33Z,"Yeah, don't listen to these guys. Its horrible how judgmental and close-minded people are now a days. However, my best friend said, to each their own."

Sorry this book is the one making unsupported claims about god.
Most atheist do not claim any god is impossible, We are just saying you cant assert what your trying to assert."
,craneman1,2011-05-22T19:41Z,if you deny God as your Father he will deny you as your son I think yall guys need to have a closer look at that bible
,civilitary,2011-07-27T04:19Z,Wheres Genesis in the NIV??
,nooneinteres,2011-09-15T03:46Z,"Guys, you can't sort out an argument by saying 'you're wrong', 'no, you're wrong'. You have to be open minded. I think these atheists have a point. There are two theories. 1: an explosion of hydrogen resulted in many tiny cells which joined and reproduced larger cells until fish were formed etc. (is that right?). 2: The earth was created by an eternal, all powerful being in 6 days. Both seem a bit wild. Personally, I agree with the second theory because the first one â€“ that it happened by accident â€“ sounds much wilder. The world is too advanced and too beautiful to have come about by accident, without intelligence. Even the greatest modern scientists are unable to properly replicate something a simple as a hand or eye â€“ thatâ€™s WITH intelligence. It must have been designed."
