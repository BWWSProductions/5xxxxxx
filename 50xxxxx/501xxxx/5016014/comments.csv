,mariusjr,2009-12-08T09:11Z,"I don't know.
I will check it out.

But if you want the longest version available, then check this out:

full 154 minutes. That's even longer as the longest version you can get official!"
,mariusjr,2009-12-09T21:02Z,"To answer the question:
This version is the 139 minute cut of the film that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival."
