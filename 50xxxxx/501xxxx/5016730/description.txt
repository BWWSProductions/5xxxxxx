Having won 19 Grammy Awards, 2 Golden Globes and sold 120 million records worldwide, Bruce Springsteen needs little introduction. With a career spanning over 35 years, the quality of The Boss' output has been nothing short of breathtaking. His new compilation, Greatest Hits, focuses on Springsteen's time with his regular backing group, The E Street Band, featuring 18 of the band's finest recordings.

Opening where it all began, 'Blinded By The Light' was Springsteen's first single from his debut album, 'Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.' The epic seven minutes of 'Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)' tells a tale of forbidden love in the form of a jaunty, sax-led pop song. Meanwhile, the irrepressible, award-winning 'Born To Run' still sounds as fresh today as it did back on its initial release in 1972. With a trademark drum intro, powerful piano and electric guitars, 'Badlands' features the archetypal E Street Band sound - a lively sense of rock n roll freedom also prominent on 'Radio Nowhere' and 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town'. Angry, poetic and with a hook to die for, 'Born In The USA' is considered one of the greatest rock songs ever written, and remains, arguably, Springsteen's finest four and a half minutes. Rhythmically catchy and littered with up-tempo synth riffs, 'Dancing In The Dark', his biggest-selling commercial success, confirmed The Boss as a true songwriting pioneer. A poignant reaction to the 9/11 attacks, 'The Rising' is both heartbreaking and optimistic. Greatest Hits concludes with two live takes: the pacy, anthemic 'Because The Night' and the casual blues of 'Fire'. These scintillating live tracks prove that Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band are more than just an incredible studio group.

After listening to all 18 tracks, it is evident that there is no other songwriter like Bruce Springsteen. His imagination, lyrical intensity and the ability to express a series of heartfelt emotions in a simple three-minute track is something that is likely to remain unrivalled. A stunning retrospective featuring 9 huge hits and several album favourites, Greatest Hits serves as both the perfect introduction to the great man himself, yet also a fitting and worthy addition to the collections of long-term admirers.
