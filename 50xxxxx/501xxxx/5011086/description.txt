OK guys, this is the debut of Kingdom Gone, the new hope of the german metal scene. The album has been released last night, so it really is brand new. I've encoded it with EAC in mp3's extreme mode to give you the best quality as possible, I could have done it in flac as well, but I didn't want to see it burned to CD-R. The guys wrote all the songs, recorded, mixed and produced them themselfes and paid the bills for the production and a great release party. So if you like the music, get in touch with the guys and order a copy of your own, they really deserve to get something back. The only purpose for me to release the torrent is to put them on the map. 

Help to spread the word, help seeding! 

More info inside the torrent, but if you like bands like 'Die Apokalyptischen Reiter', you'll definately love this great Melodic Death Metal band.
