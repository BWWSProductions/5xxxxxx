,steelywaski,2009-07-23T00:23Z,"Please do not interpret this as me being ungrateful, but I noticed that some of the sections are missing.  The CNC section, for example, is missing from what I recall to be Section 12.  Do you have the original images from the scans? If so, I can provide a detailed listing of what is missing.  Thanks so much for your efforts."

,ForFun00,2010-03-24T03:01Z,"malestrom_HH, Thanks a Lot!
After years of retiremnet, I came back to make designsm CAD, CAM and Programming; I lost my handy ""charts"" (my son's got them while traveling) and TODAY my MH26edition have (for some reason) lost all pages, only 3. I Panic (it's 300x faster to search than to read). 
I DL both of your MHB Torrents (editions 27 & 28) 
Again, Thanks a Lot!!!!"
