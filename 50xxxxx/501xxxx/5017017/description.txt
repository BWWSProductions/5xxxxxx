This is part 1 of a trainride from Salta to Minas Concordia in Argentina.

SADLY: Now the film is with music instead of driving noises. I also do not like
the new format 16:9 because it cuts off on top the mountain points. Decide it 
yourself. I am disappointed personally although it is a great landscape.

The German TV (ARD) broadcasts once in while during nighttimes short section
of trainrides like this featuring the most beautiful tracks in the world. 

I catch as many sections as possible using Windows Media Center recording in 
its special format dvr-ms, cut and merge it with DVREdit. Afterwards the file 
is convertetd lossless to mpg (filesize is almost identical) since I think, it
is the most popular format everybody can handle.

Hope, you enjoy my CabRide-torrents.

IF YOU LIKE THEM AND WANT MORE, PLEASE KEEP SEEDING AS MANY OF MY TORRENTS AS
POSSIBLE SO THAT I MAY REGAIN CAPACITIES!
