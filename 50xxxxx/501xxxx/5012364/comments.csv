,jlntx,2009-07-22T05:34Z,"thanks a lot for all those marvelous upload. i was born in the very late 80s but enjoy the music a lot.

i was wondering if you had the minutemen discography or at least more albums than the one you posted quite a time ago. if you don't i'll search harder and upload it if i find it."
,jlntx,2009-07-22T05:38Z,"nevermind about the minutemen i found the discography somewhere else actually. but well, thanks for all the effort you put on sharing."
