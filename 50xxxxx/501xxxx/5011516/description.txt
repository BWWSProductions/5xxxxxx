When most of these materials first came out I tried to order them. But, it would take about two months for the places to tell me they couldn't because all were sold out. Oh, well. I found other means to attain this cool music. I know little about this fellow other than he is a good German electronic artist, mixing in guitars and strange synth. This is pretty much what he has put out. The only mystery I have is what the 'downstairs' album is. It contains tracks from other albums, but some that aren't. I can find no-info on it. One lady I talked to from Vienna seemed to know very much about it, but our conversation wasn't very contructive seeing as how I speak about 5 words in German. Anyway here it is ,again, for your enjoyment :)
