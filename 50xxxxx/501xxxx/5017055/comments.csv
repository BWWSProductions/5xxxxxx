Hey guys! I finaly made an account on here, been using this site by recommendation of my brother and its by far the BEST. Over the 1.5 years i've been on this site, I have to say you guys deal with a lot of CRAP and some Grade A, highclass ignorance/retardation (sorry, dun like that word but it lierally applies.)   Anyhow thanks for being a badass site, thanks for all the dudes who've snuck some shit in a theatre so me and my girl can watch them at home. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

  As far as this torrent goes.. AWESOME i would consider this A:10 V:10 all day.

  oh i almost forgot, thanks! xD"
,raul_feel,2009-07-26T21:22Z,"the quality is superb, thank you. "
,bamadeb77,2009-07-27T02:41Z,I downloaded this in 2 hours but all i got was sound no picture! 
,daveleau,2009-07-28T04:19Z,"Video quality: 8
Sound quality: 8

Very good copy. In avi format with Swedish subtitles. If you don't like the subtitles, just delete the SRT file that comes with the movie, and it will work fine and not show the subtitles. I averaged 300+kbps on my slower-than-average wireless cable network.

Thanks!"
,thereislucky,2009-09-07T17:36Z,heel even een vraagje he als je deze op een dvdtje wilt zetten dan lukt het niet omdat de subs. appart staan en als ik die wil toevoegen bij windows movie maker dan doe hij het niet weet iemand hoe ik dit moet doen als dat zo is graag even antwoord dat zou ik dan heel erg op prijs stellen.
,thereislucky,2009-09-26T12:47Z,ok dankje ik ga het proberen!

,sk8rgrl31691,2009-10-20T01:39Z,"I only got sound, no picture :("
,sk8rgrl31691,2009-10-20T01:57Z,Great! Great audio and video quality! 5 Stars!
,greenfrog,2009-11-07T03:36Z,"yea, this codec is whack. 7 years at TPB and never had one so odd. Quicktime gives no picture. Xbox wont play at all. MPC freezes and WMP plays a squeezed version with slow motion-then fast motion. Now thats wack!. What is the point of not using normal codecs?! 
There is a better one called DVDSCR MAXSPEED
Good day."
,greenfrog,2009-11-07T05:52Z,"oy, you can find the obscure codec by googling mkv video2dvd
 get the file free_mkv_setup.exe and it installs a whole bunch of codecs including ffshow something which fix all the problems for WMP. And then its:
V8
A8
I went out of my way here to help since other have done the same for me in the past. i d/l'd 29 codecs in 3 hours before i found the right one. ahhh... hope it helps"
,jennykaos,2010-08-05T15:52Z,thanx for the add!! ik weet alleen niet hoe ik die nederlandse ondertiteling erbij krijg. de srt file zit er idd bij maar hoe krijg ik die file in mijn video??
