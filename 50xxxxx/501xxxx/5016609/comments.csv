,KelsoLandryn,2009-08-01T00:02Z,"Great job! That's a charity work for all mindfuck-searchers. Big plus for you, buddy!"
,blood_storm,2009-08-01T11:38Z,"I have absolutely no complaints about this torrent except that some movies come in two seperate avi files. I know that is not your fault BOZX, but rather the fault of the original rippers. That being said, The movies are of excellent quality, it is a very full collection, lightning fast download speed on both this torrent and the torrents inside this torrent. I downloaded at full speed the entire time (which is 620 kb/s for me). Amazing torrent BOZX thanks for all your hard work. I've been searching for some good mindfucks for a while and you gave me all I could've wanted and more. I will be seeding all torrents indefinitely, which is a rare occurence for me indeed (I usually seed only to a 2x ratio). I truely appreciate it."
