Video files are not compressible, so zipping them is pointless."

I know, but it is my first torrent, at first I thought I had to upload the movies to TPB, and that they automatically would generate a torrent file. Also I found out after zipping it that it was still the same file. I googled how to make a torrent file, and did not want to wait half an hour to unzip it, so i made the torrent from the zipped movies. Just scan it before and after unzipping if you don't trust it. It is clean, however. It's my first uploaded torrent, so hope everyone understands."

Just remember that without seeders you would not even be able to leech. If you like to download somthing then somewhen else might as well. You have to share to be able to receive. No one is forcing you, but if you love the movie(s) then pls seed, i cannot keep seeding this for months, years. Weeks, yes. 2,3 Months, maybe.  But this torrent will be dead without more seeders soon. Pls seed, even a few hours, a day, 2 days. SEED !"
,Crowned-King,2009-07-28T20:52Z,"don't worry i'll keep seeding, my pc haven't been turned off for a long time now, and only closed uTorrent, (and not often,) for like 30/60 minutes to play a game of FIFA09 online, otherwise it will lag to much. i will keep seeding non-stop AT LEAST till like 5 or 10 seeders exist. after that i will still keep seeding, however maybe a bit less then non-stop. my uTorrent starts with Windows, and if i'm not playing online (a few hours max) i'm seeding. this torrent WILL get of the ground. also, it says Seeders: 1, maybe that means actively seeding, because uTorrent tells me 5 persons have the complete download, CAN be seeders."
