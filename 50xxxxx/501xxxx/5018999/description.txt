Stephen King is the king of horror.
The cream of the crop, with the crown on top.
He IS the King and this is his royal treasure, his best (horror) works. 
Among my favorites are: 
Misery, 1408, The Shining, Secret Window (all HIGHLY recommendable).

Also, I understand that some people might find a certain movie much better the other people would, so to make it to the selection I used simple democracy, most votes count. Meaning, for each movie I used, besides my personal taste, multiple reviews, and only those AT LEAST above average could make it to the cut. Not only that, most are at least "good". A lot are also reviewed as "very good". In MULTIPLE reviews, so taste differs true, but you won't find a weak movie in this selection. I also had to let one go that wasn't a favorite of me, but I found it to be decent. It ALMOST made it, and it JUST didn't, by a whisker (Dreamcatcher).

Most are .avi files, xvid or divx encoded. Download an (Google:) "all-in-one codec pack" if you have any trouble playing one of these files. Most of you should be able to play it perfectly though.

Here is the list of the movies (and mini series) that are a crowning of his works:
