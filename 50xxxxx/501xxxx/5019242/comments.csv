,ZangetsuPH,2010-01-31T17:52Z,"Guys, im currently downloading the file, i've never played this before, so I really want to know if this file works well, I mean, this is the real RE4 right?

Im asking because I downloaded kingdom hearts CoM the other day, and the files were messed up and I ended up deleting it, leaving me frustrated."
,chopsuey2,2010-01-31T23:31Z,"@ZangetsuPH
This game works absolutely great. But you need to burn it at a slow speed in order to get the most of it "
,ZangetsuPH,2010-02-01T13:25Z,"@chopsuey2

,TFCJMHEW,2010-05-29T04:54Z,"Question
How do you burn this to a disc to play it on the Playstation 2???
Does it have to be a certain disc???"

[T],gamerguuy,2010-06-30T12:16Z,@TFCJMHEW you need to burn this with imgburn and you need dvd-r or dvd+r and burn it @ 4x speed.
,zoma45,2010-07-07T18:54Z,it works perfet
,XGamer95,2010-08-04T22:57Z,@gamerguuy I extracted both files to my desktop and burnt the ISO to a DVD+R. When I go on my PS3 that has backwards compatibility it shows up as a data disc and I can't play it. Will this only work on a PS2 even though my PS3 can play PS2 games? Any advice?

,GreyHaze,2010-09-28T20:09Z,"Downloaded the torrent and seeding it @50kb/s, wondering if this works on PC's? My PS2 appears to be broken and it seems like a waste to delete after several hours of downloading. Thanks "

,xDonarudo,2012-02-29T02:32Z,Seeded for a while at around 250kbps. The game works fine so far but the quality isnt amazing. as expected. If you are on PC and want it better quality I would get the PC version with texture pack. I only got this so that I could use my xbox 360 controller on PCSX2 emulator
,Perolas,2012-03-24T20:36Z,A litle slow downloading. Thank you man
