,coldkilla9,2009-07-24T17:28Z,"AiTB: Where will you go when TPB goes away? I follow all of your TV shows, Tivo cant touch what you can do! I hope you stick around if we have to move somewhere else, and I'd like to know where your place of choice may be. I hope I can catch your eye, with all the postings you do anyway I'm not so sure I may."
,lp_mvb,2009-08-15T00:16Z,"Might be my fault, but I can't pay this game. I used Winrar to unrar the iso file, and used the setup.exe to install the game. I then ran the patch, and copied the contents of the Skidrow map into the installation folder. The game starts, I choose a map or tutorial to play, it starts loading, and after 5-10 seconds it just shuts down...

Running Windows Vista 32bit...

Any help?"
