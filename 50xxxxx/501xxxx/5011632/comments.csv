,tromort,2009-07-19T20:08Z,probably the best version atm..definitely better as a cam.
,Blubs,2009-07-20T10:33Z,"v7.5 (a lil dark in places, but very watchable)
a8.5 (very good)
runtime 2:18.18 --- film is 2:33min. idk how much of that is credits etc but i only noticed one place where it looked as though a bit was missing.. and it didnt seem to miss much (if anything)
very watchable.. good film too!
Many thx to STG for the torrent 
& to .BONE. for the upload :D"
,trixie_osu,2009-07-21T02:42Z,very good quality for a cam. i'm new to downloading vids and am impressed with the quality. saw the movie in theatre twice and i honestly cannot think of anything missing from this vid. there is lots of closing credits so there is some of the time missing. thanks for the vid!
