PLEASE SEED!
The Manhattan Transfer, one of the worldâ€™s finest vocal-groups in my opinion. Here three albums with the first line-up, founded during 1972 by Tim Hauser and singers Alan Paul, Janis Siegel, and Laurel MassÃ©.
The albums are: The Manhattan Transfer, Coming Out and Pastiche. 
They also recorded a live album 1978, however it seems as this album is difficult to find on CD. At least I havenÂ´t found it.
