,LocusDeus,2009-07-30T03:22Z,There's no way all five episodes can be HD in this 1.09GiB download.  Can anyone besides Jack confirm this torrent?
,Neopopulas,2009-11-02T12:10Z,"Considering the MKV version tops out at over 7gb, i doubt the validity of this. Whoever uses MKV needs to burn, i absolutely hate that thing. It doesn't work on all players and almost no DVD/Media boxes. So much hate for that format"
