Cubase Studio 4 is professional-class digital audio workstation.
Cubase 4 is one for studio professionals.

Cubase Studio 4 comes with a brand-new VST3 plug-in set, integrated virtual instruments providing more than 600 sounds, and professional notation features including score layout and printing.

Based on Cubase 4 core technology Cubase Studio 4 offers the same redesigned user interface that we feel is going to revolutionize people's expectation of DAW workflow and creativity, and is only lacking features you'll need if you are operating a recording environment requiring 5.1 sound, multi-person recording, and some of the additional VSTs and sounds that accompany them.
