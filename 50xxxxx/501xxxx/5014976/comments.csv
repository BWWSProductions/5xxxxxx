Where is the ""Addition Content"" folder thats mentioned. I've looked everywhere and even unpacked the installers but still can't find it."
,kopone,2009-07-26T16:12Z,it's in the program files
,seabess,2009-07-28T01:17Z,where exactly in the program files? i still cant find it.
,beckiej2k6,2009-07-29T17:36Z,"yeah, there is no folder that says 'additional content' so that makes the instructions look flase! i cant even start it becuase it said it cant find SYNSOACC.DLL but then i downloaded that file and stil not working eitherway its a crap torrent :S unless somebody has got the same problem and can fix it lol XD thanks anyway!"
,Mentalbox,2009-07-29T19:19Z,"I was given 2 or 3 errors about Update_HALionOne_1.1.0.0.exe not being able to access 2 or 3 files (depending on how many errors) in /temp/
And now Cubase crash after starting up (after answering: I am already registered it shut down, and ever after since it crash on start-up)"
,Beneath_The_Mask,2009-09-05T15:42Z,"""During HALionOne update process, you'll be asked for Cubase DVD, press ok & browse to ""Additional Content"" folder, press ok once again."" As mentioned before whole Additional Content folder is missing. Useless, not recommended..."
,tallefjant1,2009-09-11T13:08Z,"When asked for the ""Additional Content"" Just point it to the Cubase install folder in Program files (C:\Program Files\Steinberg\Cubase Studio 4"". Thats all there is to it really. Poorly described in the instuctions though."
,fireworx2,2009-09-11T20:52Z,"worked like a charm first run, but after the first it has stopped working. i get the just-in-time debugger (visual studio) and the program crashes. Too bad, since it worked the first time."
,MrGaryGaza,2010-10-15T19:38Z,"It doesn't work on Windows 7, just thought might want to know."

,SYNSOACC,2011-12-16T03:38Z,The SYNSOACC.DLL error is because patcher.exe copies that file to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 without checking if your windows is actually installed on C. If your windows is installed on another drive (e.g. D) then C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 is the wrong place for it. Copy it from C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 to D:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 or E:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 or whatever drive your windows is on.
