,JackalsGroove,2010-05-22T00:45Z,"Okay here is how you do it-you need Daemon tools. You will see .bin and .cue files. You need to load and run through daemon tools (which while i am sure there are other .cue readers out there, this is the only one I am aware of that works with extreme ease). simple, really. When you get a torrent you do not know how to run-check the extention of the file.

 If you do not recognize that .whateverhere look it up-chances are you'll find info regarding how to use it, what it does, etc. "
