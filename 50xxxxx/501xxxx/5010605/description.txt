Review
Astonishing talent only comes around every so often, but a true guitar virtuoso has risen from Sao Paulo, Brazil and his name is Kiko Loureiro. Loureiro an already recorgnized world class guitarist as part of the hugely successful rock group Angra, has graced the covers of many guitar trade magazines such as Guitar Player Brazil, Cover Guitarra, Young Guitar to name only a few, and has been voted in polls as the #2 guitarist in the world. Kiko teams with Cuban keyboard wizard Yaniel Matos to bring you Jazz Fusion at it's highest level. Think of Stern or Scofield on steroids, and you will begin to only touch the surface of Loureiro's guitar prowess. His understanding of jazz harmonies is evident as he blows through complex chording laid down by Matos. Universo Inverso is packed with exciting world class compositions and performances that will have your ears jumping with delight! --Taurus Sweet
