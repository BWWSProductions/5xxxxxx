[T],ripthejacker420,2009-08-12T10:46Z,hey guys. i sincerely regret to inform you that i will not be able to seed any of my torrents anymore. my ISP gives me a 10GB bandwidth limit per month and i have exceeded this several times and they turned off my internet because of this. they turned it back on but i must not exceed this again or they will probably turn it off for good. until another ISP comes to my area i will be unable to seed any of my torrents. i'm sorry!!
