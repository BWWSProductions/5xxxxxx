What is cFosSpeed?

cFosSpeed is a network driver, which attaches itself to existing Internet connections. It then optimizes data transfer by means of Traffic Shaping. 

Traffic Shaping is a method for optimizing the Internet traffic. It allows maximum speed while ensuring minimal Ping. 

You can use cFosSpeed with a router and/or a DSL-modem or cable-modem. You can also use cFosSpeed with other types of Internet access, ie. whenever you already have an existing Internet connection. 

cFosSpeed supports a wide variety of connections, like DSL, cable, ISDN, UMTS, etc. 
cFosSpeed has two goals
Keep network delays (ping times) small, in order to make Internet applications as responsive as possible.
