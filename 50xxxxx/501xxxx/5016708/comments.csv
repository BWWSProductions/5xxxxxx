,zetty2009,2009-07-23T18:40Z,"nelsonn69 - you have almost spammed three different torrents with similar comments..

You need to appreciate the fact that Joe is doing all these uploads without being selfish and giving us everyday something to have a great time with !!!

Requesting him for ALL FLAC uploads of an artist ...isn't that too much that you are asking for ? To come out with one FLAC request make sense but all of them when he has already uploaded the mp3 stuff..c'mon.
Imagine the kind of time and effort that goes into ripping and scanning, then seeding all these stuff.

I think we should all be appreciative of his consistent effort and do the best on our part by seeding his torrents as long as possible !!!

Joe mate ..thnx for all ur recent efforts..Adelita's way, Melankton ,The Verve and Fleetwood Mac..amazing effort again..Keep Surprising us :)"

I have previously uploaded FLACs but they have been albums that were requested in the superbay forum, which i found and uploaded, but were not my own.

You might not be aware but i have a limited upload speed of between 33-35KB/s speed. To upload an album at 320kbs it takes about 2-3hours. So a FLAC upload would take about 4hours +.

I know there are other uploaders who can do this in 10minutes or so. But I dont have the money to pay for extra bandwidth.

I hope that helps."

Anyway just to let you know, that with the upcoming sale of the piratebay, i have decided to find an alternative to the piratebay, so you can find me on
