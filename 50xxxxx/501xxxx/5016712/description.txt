He dwells in a world of external night--but the blackness is filled with sounds and scents, tastes and textures that most cannot perceive.

Although attorney Matt Murdock is blind, his other four senses function with superhuman sharpness.

By day, Murdock represents the downtrodden.

At night he is Daredevil, a masked vigilante stalking the dark streets of the city, a relentless avenger of justice.

For Daredevil justice is blind--and for the guilty, there's hell to pay.
