The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien - June 8, 2009

Everyone on the show gets advertised, just not quite like Conan.
Conan and Andy travel the treacherous waters of the LA River.
(Armando) Trull Busters
The first episode of the telenovela Noces de Pasion con Senor O'Brien - Si, Conando!

Guests: the star of Californication (and recovering sexoholic) actor David Duchovny, the fetching Anna Friel (loved her big eyes, batting eyelashes and lovelorn looks in Pushing Daisies, even though the show disappointed - reminds me of the most beautiful eyes I ever saw on television, those of Janine Turner in Northern Exposure), and the standup comic Bill Burr who confesses that suicide can be seen as extreme laziness.
