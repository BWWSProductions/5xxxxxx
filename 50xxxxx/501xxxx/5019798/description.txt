From wikipedia:

Consign to Oblivion is the second studio-album by Dutch symphonic metal band Epica, and was released in April 2005. Trois Vierges features a guest appearance by Kamelot vocalist Roy Khan. The album's lyrics are heavily influenced by Mayan Civilization.

Stylistically, the album is more focused towards orchestration than other Epica releases and features heavy use of a chorus. Additionally, Mark Jansen's death growls appear less frequently, occurring on only three songs, "Force of the Shore", "Mother of Light" and "Consign to Oblivion".
