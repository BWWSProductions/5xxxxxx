Late Show with David Letterman - June 9, 2009

In America, Meet The Press. In Iran, Eliminate The Press.
Sarah Palin's borrowed speeches
Video of Sonya Sotomayor breaking her ankle
Changes on Broadway; Dave sells cheap jewellery.
Small Town news

Guests: the always lovely vivacious actress Julia Roberts (the relaxed longtime friendship with Dave is obvious, with talk about Dave's mariage, the late Paul Newman, and more...), and Grammy winning The Black Eyed Peas with a lively track from their new CD The E.N.D.
