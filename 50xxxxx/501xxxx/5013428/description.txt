An old but quick way to list the contents of any hard drive, CD, DVD USB thumb drive etc. and creating a standard text file showing the results
The question is why would you really need to?

I find it an infallible way of identifying individual files which can be easily located using the search facility within notepad or any text editor.

Useful? maybe to some you make your own mind up


Please seed cheers
