[V],McTav,2009-08-03T06:59Z,"thanks guys, i will try my best not to abuse it ;P"
,crook16 ,2009-08-06T05:42Z,"oh haha i knew something was different..congratz on the skull and thanks for the uploads i seed everything i download from you ......quality stuff, thanks again McTav!"
,kehaak,2009-10-11T14:37Z,Thanks :)
,korochuun,2009-10-23T01:15Z,"It's so great you've been giving us all these seasons, but the lack of proper seeding is killing me.
If you're (to the general people reading) going to bother seeding, can we do it a little higher than .000001 kb/s ? I mean, great job that you're at 100%, let's give the rest of us a chance too, eh?"
,Sumsonfire,2009-10-24T08:14Z,"hi Mctav i greatly appreciate the work u do but i was wondering if it is possible for you to create torrents of all south parks in compressed rar format because they are alot easier to download and they are quicker and for someone like me whos internet isnt very fast it would make a real difference as it took me 5 or six days to download a single season 
thank you for all your work"
,nty1907fb,2009-11-22T23:35Z,ty very much... :):) quality is good
,gmanunit,2009-11-28T15:12Z,can't download no seeders
,_043,2009-12-21T16:44Z,"nice quality, thanks"
,bubbabead,2010-02-14T06:42Z,"very much appreciated McTav

decent speed, great quality, all clean, etc."
,Sentinela,2010-03-04T18:29Z,"Just for you to know:
I've downloaded this torrent and it worked perfectly, good quality, small files, high dl speed, thanks a lot. But I've received from my net provider a Comedy Central's warning about downloading illegal material. They haven't done anything like blocking my connection, but it's the first time I receive this kind of message because of a DvDRIP's torrent. So I really advise you not to download this torrent on any computer (or IP) that you may be identified.

Do you use PeerGuardian or an IPfilter to recude the chances of getting such cease and desist letters?"
,iwantfood,2010-04-02T02:01Z,"Well, I had my IPfilter going and got a notice too"
,mr.woodcock,2010-04-24T11:06Z,"mctav,
 you have the best selction of the south park tv series Thanks man. but i wonder do you also have seson 13 complete?"
,allen42028,2010-05-03T06:37Z,thanks man your the best just hope i dont get a letter the next series you upload you should not include DVDrip cause i think that's what attracts baytsp to your torrents. 
,TrailerParkReject,2010-06-13T16:48Z,plz seed!
,cinnamon-suck,2010-08-24T00:26Z,please seed :)
,Ranky,2010-09-28T01:21Z,"FYI ... i got a email from my internet company something about a infringment shit (idk tecnical terms) but what i do know is me and 1 of my friends both got this message ... sry mcTav your torrents are great and great quality ..  but be careful "" they"" are watching your torrents .. and this one specificaly ... "" Protocol: BitTorrent

Infringed Work: Comedy Central- South Park

Infringing File Name: South Park Season 8 DvDrip-McTav "" 
 Jus a firendly heads up.. "
,ilovemycomputer,2010-10-13T22:26Z,"BEWARE: This may or may not be mctav's fault, but warning everybody for future references!!! 
THE TRACKER ""http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce"" has been found in multiple southpark seasons from MCTav and upon research on google, the second result I found from this was
""denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969 is operated by MediaDefender and this blog is a ploy to trick people into using the tracker"". That said, that mediadefender is the one running this tracker, make sure you delete it before you do ANY sharing. Praise mctav for hosting these, but warning your fans!"
,ilovemycomputer,2010-10-14T00:20Z,"By the way the blog I was talking about in my previous comments on mctav's other torrents was: 
http://opentracker.blog.h3q.com/
This is a fake site, and even advises to using the tracker, which is operated by MediaDefender to track if you upload any of the torrents it's in, so they can nail you for it. Thats why you've gotten that stupid notice to cease and desist asap."
,steviekeyz,2010-10-24T04:17Z,"They're not watching the creator of the torrent. They are watching you if you got a cease and desist letter, your ISP that is.

There's no sure-way of avoiding these but a good attempt is using PeerBlock/PeerGuardian."
,293837,2010-11-07T15:59Z,"NOT SEASON 8, MOSTLY SEASON 10"
,Basnagus,2011-09-10T02:26Z,FYI is CENSORED .. excellent quality fast DL thnx alot McTav
