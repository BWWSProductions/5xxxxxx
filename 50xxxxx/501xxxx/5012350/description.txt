"discography" means a LIST of recordings, not a collection.

A big fuck you to the 3 pricks who immediately disconnected after reaching 100%.

This is a re-up of the my previous multitracks for Only, with THTF files removed.

These multitracks are lossless
The source of these tracks are the official downloads, which were formatted for certain applications.
Includes:
- only multitracks exported from ableton live
- only multitracks exported from digidesign protools
- only multitracks exported from sony acid nin_origacidproject
- only multitracks exported from sony acid nincomplete

I've exported these as full-length track files, so when loaded up in any application, they're arranged as the original song.
(With the exception of the Ableton Live multitracks, which are arranged slightly differently.)
The directories feature the name of the source of the tracks - but they can be opened in any mixing program.
And the filenames for the tracks are the names provided by those programs.

I've converted to .flac to reduce filesize, you may have to decode to .wav before opening (if you use crap software)

I've also included my own simple mix-downs on the tracks, plus an instrumental version of the ProTools session of Only

Special thanks to Triggerm!ne of echoingthesound.org for helping out with the Pro Tools version of the tracks.
