,deathstaraven,2009-07-23T16:26Z,@sean72610: You haven't seen any of Brick's rips yet?  My god man get yourself a PS3 and an external HDD and get with it!!  His rips are Incredible. Especially if you have a HDTV with 1080p. You bet they are better than DVD.

,teabag87,2009-07-26T15:52Z,"I'll never understand why people keep requesting so much stuff:

SUPERBAD:
download the mkv:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4864985/Superbad.2007.UNRATED.720p.BluRay.x264-CHD

Then download HandBrake or RipBot and convert it yourself.  It's not hard..."
