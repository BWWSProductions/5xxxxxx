For instance, one song is 16kpbs bitrate, but sounds fine, and another is at 400-something kpbs.  One song thinks it's 24 minutes long, though it only plays for the normal 3:56.  Again, everything sounds fine, and thanks for the upload, but I wonder what happened.  Could just be my software, though it's never done anything like this before."
