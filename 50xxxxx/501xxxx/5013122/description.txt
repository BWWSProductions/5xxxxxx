From earliest to current this selection (not a complete discography) spans The Boss's career. All tracks are VBR and volume normalised to 98%, they include ID tags and thumbnail covers for display in WinAmp etc. There are two duplicates only, favour being shown to studio over 'live' tracks. Enjoy and please seed.
