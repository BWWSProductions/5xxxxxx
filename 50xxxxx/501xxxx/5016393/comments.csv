Massive fail !
The RTM was released july 22, same day as this torrent.
So we should believe that this guy who uploaded this is legit? The guy has been posting Windows 7 RTM's since may for crying out loud.

Sure, take your chances, I woudn't trust this guy for a second.

It's fake, so is his other 11 RTM torrents, plain and simple !!
Wait for the technet/msdn release and info that should be out in a week or so. If the SHA-1 matches this one, I'll post an apology here.

... but it will never happen.

See ya."
