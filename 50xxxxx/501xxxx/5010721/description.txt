After a long and grueling hunt through the very depths of the internet, I finally found EVERY episode of Ned's Declassified, including the "missing" episodes from season 3. This includes the ever-elusive Field Trip episode! Whether you're just trying to survive your next day at school or watching these for the nostalgia and memories, you'll love Ned's Declassified.

Please seed once you're done downloading... It took me months to find these episodes, and I want everybody to be able to enjoy them as much as I have.

Enjoy!

** Please note that there are two files named "Field Trips, Permission Slips, and Weasels." The first is the original source file as I found it. However, there was a problem with the audio clipping and distorting, so I have optimized the audio so that it doesn't blow your eardrums out. This optimized file is labeled as "Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide 3x21-22 Field Trips, Permission Slips, Signs, & Weasels 2.avi"
