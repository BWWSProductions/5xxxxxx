,Everyman9,2009-10-20T10:20Z,"Hey - Thanks to Marsdentech for this.  Please let me help some of you with the installation of this amazing software collection.  First, download and unzip the torrent.  You will likely need to turn off your antivirus for this - try not to worry, thousands of TPB users can vouch for it.  Second, install as directed - please read the read me file for some particulars.  What I did was to start the installation and say it was going to be a 30 day trial, and then put in the keygen generated serial number after that.  Once the serial number was in, I exited the program and then ran the disable activation command file.  Then I renamed and replaced the amptlib.dll file.  Thought I was done, but then had the same problems that others did with program interrupting me, asking for a new serial number, etc.  I looked at Picoman's note, and checked the Hosts file.  Sure enough, not modified by the disable activation command file.  Right clicked on the file, changed properties from read only, saved.  (Running windows 7) hit the windows button, typed in notepad, right clicked on the program icon in the search results area, hit run as administrator.  Used the file from notepad to open the hosts file, added the following line at the bottom of the file: ""127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com"" (but don't type in the quotes).  Saved the file, exited, and done!  I think that with W7, and perhaps with vista, they have made the hosts file not as accessible to modification to help out some of the software makers.  Feel a little guilty about enjoying Adobe's marvelous software, but I'd never be able to afford it, so at least this way I can play with it.  Good luck. "

I've read a couple of the help-tips on here for solving that problem, but some of them are conflicting, and almost all of them were by people using Windows 7, not Vista

Has anybody here gotten it to work properly on Vista and can tell me step by step what the new, updated instructions for getting this properly installed would be? Or if those instructions happen to have already been posted, you can just point me to the author and that comment.
I'll just go ahead and uninstall and delete everything, and the unzip again and start from scratch and follow your instructions.

Extra Hint if it helps: According to my friends' observations and my own, we're thinking part of the problem in the installation process is the part where I'm supposed to run the ""disable_activation.cmd"".

Perhaps one thing to add when installing is that if you're using a 64bit OS, you need to do the amtlib.dll renaming/copying stuff in the 32bit Photoshop folder (../Program Files (x86)/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS4/). The one in the straight Program Files/etc... folder is for the 64bit Photoshop and it won't work if you do it in that one (easily fixed by renaming files back)."

[T],TeamPS,2009-11-27T13:20Z,"We were all newbs once lol...

Did the download complete 100%?

A false positive is where an anti-virus picks up coding in a file and thinks it's malicious code (which, it could be if it were in an infected keygen). As the keygen generates a random code, the anti virus might pick it up as a virus, but it isn't. The best thing to do is either ignore the warning or if the antivirus deletes the file automatically, redownload the keygen/crack only after temporarily disabling your anti virus. Then once the keygen has been used successfully, re-enable your antivirus.

That's quite nice of you!

,wintems,2009-12-17T09:27Z,"hola,
thank you, thank you, thank you!!!... for the upload.

and now - the question...
downloaded, installed (by running the disable_activation.cmd, renaming only photoshop's amtlib.dll and pasting the ""new one""), firewalled - all seemed perfect. 
then i discovered this FNPLicensingService thing working in the background, went online to see what it is and, if i understood correctly - i don't like what it is and what it does! i especially don't like that it can't be turned off/removed for good because it either somehow reappears and starts working again or it disables the programs.
i have, now, ""altered"" amtlib.dll wherever i found it and this seems to be helping (the programs are working even when i kill it in the task manager).
but i will not enable internet until i hear from one (or many, many:) of you about what this stupid, f...ing license thing is (what it really is, the forums i browsed through offered too many explanations) and what to do with it.
i will also not sleep much for i know i will have lawsuit nightmares. what can i tell you people - i am a shame of the pirate world in so many ways... 
any help is enormously appreciated!!!"

All it is is an activator for Adobe Acrobat. Here's a solution to make it run only when you start Acrobat.

Click on Start, Run, then type services.msc and press Enter.

In the list, find the option for FLEXnet Licensing Service and double-click on it

Click the Stop button to Stop the service.

Change the Startup Type option to Disabled.

Click OK."

,wintems,2009-12-17T11:30Z,"hey, that was super fast - thanks!
your solution was the first thing i did but then programs wouldn't open (i forgot what the message was but it ended with ""...will need to close now""). then i started copying amtlib.dll everywhere and now the programs work and the license thing  doesn't run even when i open acrobat... which is fine with me:)
somewhere along the way, i screwed up illustrator that now won't open for the love of god.
all this is just an fyi in case someone needs it in future. 
from here, i will be figuring things out on my own as a punishment:))))

,markymarkbrant,2009-12-26T19:30Z,"For those with Windows 7; I did get it to work using the host file method.

#1; you will need to generate a new serial# and input it when it asks you but first, edit the host file.

#2; to edit the host file can be a pain because in Windows 7, you do not see file extensions by default.  The hosts file is NOT a .txt file, though you must open it with notepad to edit it.  So when you try to save, it may stick a .txt extension on it which will not work.  You may have to go to control panel/folder options and show all file extensions; then you will see it's possible that your changed hosts file is actually hosts.txt, which will not work.  You can rename hosts.txt to ""hosts"" with no extension and it will work.

Also, make sure there is no ""#"" in front of the line you entered and delete all white space in front of this line so it's up against the left margin not sure if this actually matters.
"
,Snakeyes88,2009-12-26T22:36Z,"Ok, what do I edit in the Hosts file?  I can find it, open it, know all about the .txt extension, etc.  kdr3000's post referenced a link explaining it but I saw no link in his post.

,Snakeyes88,2009-12-26T22:58Z,"Ok, nevermind, some quick Googling found me the answer...

Now for the semi-dumb question...you can't get updates for the software, correct?

In other words, this isn't a one-time workaround that validates the software; any time Adobe phones the server for anything (updates, etc), it checks the serial number to ensure it's valid, correct?

So if I manually bypass the block in the Host file by telling it to get updates, it's going to check the serial number against Adobe's blacklist when it does so, correct? "
,markymarkbrant,2009-12-26T23:16Z,"snakeyes

I would assume so, but I don't know for sure.  I don't think I've ever updated an adobe product.

And sorry I should have included the line to include in the hosts file, put this on a new line:

127.0.0.1       activate.adobe.com

Go to Start -> Run, type in services.msc in Run box and press Enter.
Navigate to FLEXnet Licensing Service and enable it by double clicking
on it.  You'll also want to right click on it, select ""properties"" and
make sure it is set to run upon Windows startup.

What you need to do is manually copy the amtlib.dll into the illustrator directory which ISNT the same as the photoshop one. Photoshop and all the others are :

Illustrators location for the amtlib.dll is in:

6)  Right-click ""Setup.exe"" and select ""Run As Administrator""
7)  Disconnect from the internet.
8)  Install CS4 as needed.
9)  Input the generated serial into the box when it asks for a serial.
10) Don't run any CS4 programs
11) Run ""disable_activation.cmd"" as an administrator by right-clicking it and selecting ""Run As Administrator"".

NOTE FOR WINDOWS 7 x64 USERS: STEPS 12 - 16 SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN THE ""Program Files (x86)"" DIRECTORY; I HAVEN'T TRIED PHOTOSHOP x64 BECAUSE I DON'T USE IT

12) Go to wherever you installed Adobe CS4 Master Collection (default. C:\Program Files\Adobe) and open the folder ""Adobe Photoshop CS4"".
13) Rename the file ""amtlib.dll"" inside the ""Adobe Photoshop CS4"" folder to ""amtlib.dll.mtc"".
14) Copy the cracked ""amtlib.dll"" from the folder called ""Photoshop Crack (inside the ""CS4 Crack.rar"" file).
15) Paste the cracked ""amtlib.dll"" into the ""Adobe Photoshop CS4"" folder.
16) Repeat steps 12 - 15 for every component that you installed (NOTE FOR ILLUSTRATOR: THE ""amtlib.dll"" FILE IS LOCATED IN ""\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS4\Support Files\Contents\Windows"").
17) Enable your internet connection.
18) Make some cool stuff.
19) If you like the software and can afford to do so then support Adobe by purchasing CS4. Academic Software discounts are your friend.
20) Feel free to ignore step 19 if you're a broke, out-of-school motherfucker (like me)."

But there's a trojan in the keygen.

I mean I will put the keygen on a thumb drive, and try to transfer it to the machine, and it will transfer, and when I try to view it in the directory of transfer, it will disappear right before my eyes.  It seems like a security thing, but I have un-installed all the anti-malware programs, and it still does it. I have even tried to put the keygen on a public folder on a machine that recognizes it fine, then try to pull it over the network onto one of the windows 7 e-machines, and sure enough it will transfer, and when I try to view it in the directory it disappears right before my eyes, right then.

The ""KEY"" to making getting everything (downloaded) to work is:

Try try again ( using MANY different utilities ).

By that I mean that using Alzip to unzip a spanned archive might produce CRC errors etc.  
So go ahead and TRY again with Winzip OR WinRAR OR others!

Same theory applies to ISO/IMAGE and ALOT of other FORMATS.

Everyone should have at least 3-5 applications to solve a few file formats.
