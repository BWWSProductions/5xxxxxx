hn demands that Ashdown delay the attack so that he can rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, John's soldiers remain loyal to him and he sends a radio broadcast asking the other Resistance fighters not to attack Skynet. Meanwhile, Marcus enters the Skynet base and interfaces with the computer, disabling the perimeter defenses and allowing John to infiltrate the cell block and release the human prisoners. The Resistance's disabling signal is revealed to be a ruse, and the command submarine with the Resistance leaders aboard is destroyed by a Hunter-Killer.

English subtitles added as .SRT file, remove that file to remove the subs. Dutch subtitles --> Remove the English subtitles, rename the Dutch subtitles by removing the text 'NL', now it's the same name as the movie and you will get Dutch subtitles instead of English
