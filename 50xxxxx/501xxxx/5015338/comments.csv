This is an amazing torrent. Audio commentary, extra videos etc. Damn!

It's btw also my favorite film (or at least one of them), but to chose who've never seen it, I highly recommend those that do so. And it won't make matters worse if you watch ""Network"" in companionship with ""All the President's Men"" :)"
[T],metalcore.,2009-07-22T19:22Z,"your welcome. 

if you were to pick 50 of the best speeches in cinematic history, this film would have AT LEAST 5 of them."
,ianfer,2009-07-22T22:03Z,"This movie goes to eleven.

Excellent film, 100% top rate everything.

btw, to those who like this film, i also recommend sidney lumet's other classics:

failsafe, 12 angry men, and if you like to take drugs, the wiz."
[T],metalcore.,2010-01-08T19:59Z,ok so Enter The Void is my new fave film (best fucking film ever made!) but this is still a damn close 2nd :P
