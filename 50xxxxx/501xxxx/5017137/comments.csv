,rolla1986,2009-07-24T18:17Z,"if i understand your question right, yes, you have to have ""mod chip"" in your ps2 to play any burnt games, including this."
,rolla1986,2009-07-24T18:24Z,"AND REMEMBER: be patient! My internet connection is not very good, so it won't come so fast, but when you have finnished download, please seed! 

and other torrents of this game have died (IIRC) so lets keep this on alive and seed."
