The Sims: RyntÃ¤Ã¤ Raitille (also know as Bustin' Out in other countries)

Don't Worry! Even if it's titled RyntÃ¤Ã¤ Raitille (The Finnish Marketing version) you can choose 5 different language (English, Dansk, Norsk, Suomeksi, Svenska)
Don't Know if the language chosen changes anything, i haven't tried.

The Sims Bustin' Out is the second title in The Sims console series. Bustin' Out was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance and N-Gage in the fourth quarter of 2003. As the title suggests, Sims can get out of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game. It was the first Sims game to not be on the PC. The PlayStation 2 version also features the option to play online, though EA no longer supports it.
