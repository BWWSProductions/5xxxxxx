Greetings.

I decided to rip these babies from my old man's record collection because some of the copies i found pirating around hadn't been ripped that well, and being a sound quality fuckhead, here you have them.


5 albums by the great Tom Waits:

Foreign Affairs - 1977
Swordfishtrombones - 1983
Rain dogs - 1985
Asylum Years - 1986
Real Gone - 2004

I haven't had the time to thorougly listen to these files yet, so in case you do find any clicks, pops, or any other form of audio degradation, please let me know. However, the ripper didn't warn of any errors.


Ripped with RubyRipper and encoded to flac with ReplayGain. Log files within each folder.



Please don't forget to seed this for a while, after leeching it. Other people would also like to be able to have access to this, so don't be a greedy mofo and do care about the rest of the community. SHARE!! Thank you.


My shitty assymetric connection isn't quite bandwidth heaven but i'll let it pummell as fast as i can till some more people can help me seed it strong.

Hopefully, I'll share some other quality stuff soon enough. :)



I'd also like to thank everyone who also shares whatever content, making it available for anyone anywhere in the world. Major props to every scene, individual, community, or whatever other word applies - kudos to you. This is the way to a better world, letting people have access to art, entertainment, tools, information, books, all for free. Fuck the corporate greedy bussinesses and industries. And yes, I do pay my tribute to the artists by attending their shows and paying the ticket fees, not by increasing their label's profits. ;) 


Peace, and good music.
Johnny.
