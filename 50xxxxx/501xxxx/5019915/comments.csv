I keep getting that error message that says ""you are not connected to the internet...check firewall settings ect""  But I've been running these cracked versions for like 6 months and this is the first time i'm getting this error. Everything looks fine with the firewall and internet connection but I still keep getting the message...anyone else having this trouble?"

,LiloVentresca,2009-08-14T15:02Z,"If you go to the site, it will tell you which one is the latest. But I'm not saying download it from there, I'm just saying, so far this appears to be the latest program...Now, does it work? So far I've seen no one respond to that. But Jokaz is determined so, I'll give it a shot."
