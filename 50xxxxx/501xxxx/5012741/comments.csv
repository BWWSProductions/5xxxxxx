i do wht it says i do f3 to start go into console and type

connect then server ip then i do enter but nothing happens.

when i do my cod5 private client 1.4 no pb kick it works perfect on one server because its still 1.4 but i want to play some 1.5 and i cant.

so when i do your 1.5 no pb kick i do same thing as i do with my 1.4 which is f3 to start then i go into console and type

connect server ip and nothing happens..... i dont get an error it doesn't connect nothing happens

Also i connect to English servers only

Hi, first thing did u already update youre 
cod5 WaW version to 1.5?? 
and this crack isnt working realy good 
check my text above it gives a link to a new working torrent 
and if u wanna update to cod5waw 1.5 here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5012325/ 

and i see u posted already something there....
so then i think if u use vista start the crack with rightmouse button--> Run as Administrator 
with most vista users this IS REALY NEEDED

And u need the original CoDWaWmp.exe 1.5 ofcourse :) dont be stupid to overwrite a patched file on it u can only overwrite on sp"
