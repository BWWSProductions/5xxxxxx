PBS POV The Reckoning:The Battle for the International Criminal Court
Premiere Date: July 14, 2009

Over 120 countries have united to form the International Criminal Court (ICC) â€” the first permanent court created to prosecute perpetrators, no matter how powerful, of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.

The Reckoning follows dynamic ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo and his team for three years across four continents as he issues arrest warrants for Lord's Resistance Army leaders in Uganda, puts Congolese warlords on trial, shakes up the Colombian justice system, and charges Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir with genocide in Darfur. Like a deft thriller, The Reckoning keeps you on the edge of your seat. Will the prosecutor succeed? Will the world ensure that justice prevails?

An Official Selection of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.
