Although, at the time I bought this at the SF show at the Warfield, it was 
supposed to be a "Limited Edition Tour CD," (as can be seen from the cover 
(#163, woohoo!)), Fripp, being the capitalist that he is, later decided to sell 
additional copies through the DGM website. Prick.  :)

Hang in there at the "end" of track 5, there's a "hidden" song at the end.

This is a live recording from 2001 when KING CRIMSON toured with TOOL.As 
the band often does,they allow the audience to hear some new material that 
will be released on their next album("The Power To Believe").I would have 
loved to have been in the crowd for this concert.And i really feel fortunate to 
have this live EP,as it's getting harder to find.Like TOOL's music,this is dark 
and very heavy. The intro to "Dangerous Curves" is quite humerous as we 
can hear Adrian whispering "Can you turn the lights down please".A little 
while later he whispers the same line "Can you turn the lights down 
please".Then he says "Heck,turn them off then you can watch how really bad 
we play".You can then hear the band joking around and laughing.The synths
-like sounds and drums are really amazing in this song.This is just an incredibly 
heavy track that builds."Level Five" is another "The Power To Believe" song 
at at over 8 minutes in length.I've said it before,but this song is a monster! It 
opens with screaming guitar,and check out the outbreaks of bass that comes 
and goes several times.The beast is crying out as we hear some absolutely 
blistering guitar solos as this monster is truly alive."Virtuous Circle" was 
changed a bit to become "Power To Believe II" on that record.Lots of 
percussion as the guitar joins in.The sound does lighten as percussion 
continues.The waves of synths-like sounds are majestic. "The ConstruKction 
Of Light" from the album of the same name is over 13 minutes long.Drums 
open the song as relentless angular guitar melodies play throughout.Great 
bass lines again,and vocals 6 minutes in. "The Deception of Thrush" is taken 
from "The ProjeKts" compilation.A monologue with processed vocals for 2 
minutes gets things started.Then a dark,heavy soundscape rises from the 
depths.It does lighten up as synths-like waves come in with guitar melodies. I 
can't recommend this high enough.There is nothing like live KING CRIMSON. 
And the material chosen for this EP is right up my alley, plus the fact it's taken 
from the TOOL concert only adds to the legendary status that this will one 
day achieve.4.5 stars.
