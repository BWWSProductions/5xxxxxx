,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2009-09-03T12:49Z,"The file is corrupted.
It begins with zeros.
Do not download."
,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2009-09-03T13:32Z,"No I am sorry, I have to take it back.
My downloading station crashed and that caused the corrupted file.
The file is good usable and watchable.
It is more like a documentary than show.
If you want only the show than download this:

,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2009-09-03T13:49Z,"Well I watched through and must say do not download it is crap.
Arielle Dombasle is old. Probably when she was young she looked good, but watching a grandma type of woman trying to pretend that she is young is sexy is just sick.
I think this is a private financed film to please her ego."
