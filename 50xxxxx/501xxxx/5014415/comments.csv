,kurkosdr,2009-07-30T01:19Z,"Ok, someone's got to explain this to me.

How can this file be *only* 3.99Gig and yet be an entire 1080p movie?? Guess the compression was so hard nothing but artifacts is left in the picture. I have made standard definition DviXes that were bigger."

Just 1 request please.
Please, please put up 'The Departed'. PRISTINE's has gone out.
Your movies have no pixellation that's why I'm asking you.

(I'm seeding this torrent 16*7 hrs per week)."
