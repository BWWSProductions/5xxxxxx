Spider-Man(2002) PG-13

After being chomped by a genetically altered spider, shy high schooler Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) is endowed with amazing superpowers. Kirsten Dunst plays Parker's smitten (not bitten!) girlfriend who willingly falls into his web, and Willem Dafoe is a mad scientist who becomes the Green Goblin -- Spider-Man's erstwhile enemy. The CGI scenes of Spidey swinging from building to building are enough to give Tarzan pause!
