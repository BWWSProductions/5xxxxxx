As a typical day at the hospital, they treat a man who comes in with a steak knife plunged into his chest, compliments of the ex-husband of the woman he went out on a first date with. Jackie receives an expensive gift from Eddie on their one-year anniversary, which she feels she cannot accept. Mrs. Akalitus cares for an infant baby in her office, which was left at the nurses station. Meanwhile, Dr. O'Hara deals with a personal crisis, and Grace begins her first day at a private Catholic school.
