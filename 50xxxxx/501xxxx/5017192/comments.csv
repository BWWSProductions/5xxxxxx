,Chaserthewolf,2010-10-03T17:59Z,"For now, I believe that all of the MusicLab guitars are gone. I have been trying to download Realstrat for a long time now. lol"
,whaqze,2011-03-14T14:23Z,"For those who cant´t get this to work.
Right click on Realstrat.exe  run as adminstrator then click on enter reg,info or something like that.
Then choose the demo file. and now it works"
,kiyoshi67,2011-06-12T23:02Z,"Worked great for me, thanks @whaqze for the right-click tip to run it for the first time (before registering).  I also had to move the entire musiclab folder into my sequencer's VST folder to make it show up.

Thanks to the upper.  Sounds pretty good through the Native Instruments Guitar Rig too."
,jchpdv9210,2011-09-10T08:14Z,"""Compatibility:
   * Operates as a virtual instrument software plug-in in all major hosts like LOGIC, Cubase , Digital Performer, Sonar""

I know it's an old thread but, 
this .exe obviously doesn't work in Logic, or a Mac for that matter, thanks for the UP, but does anyone know where to find the MAC version?"
