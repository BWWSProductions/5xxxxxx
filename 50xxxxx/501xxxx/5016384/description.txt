a small town in northern Sweden. Annika is keen to work

with her idol, geneticist Professor Gerhard Beckert

However Beckert's sinister past in the Waffen-SS soon

catches up with him when a couple of pill-popping

interns mistake an experimental vaccine for party

drugs. Mayhem ensues as the town's teenagers succumb

one by one to the mysterious virus
