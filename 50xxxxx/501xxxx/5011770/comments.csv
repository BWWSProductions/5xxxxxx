,elmasloco,2009-07-21T22:07Z,"Dear Suavecito, 

Thanks for the movies!!! 

I have a few on the way: 

Bad Santa
Meet the Robinsons 
Da Vinci Code

Hope you download them.

One question... what is the numerical value you use to lock the files under 4.00GB? I use 4096 which is meant to be the max but the file size after converting comes out as 3.85GB "
[T],suavecito195782,2009-07-21T22:38Z,elmasloco yeah with ripbot its 4096 should come out 3.99gb which version are using of ripbot im glad that u are joining the ps3 group those look like good fulture releases make sure to put them on here in demoind site as well oh also send a pm to bricktop or myself or other uploaders on your fulture releases so we wont do the same movies 
,elmasloco,2009-07-21T23:14Z,"Thanks for the quick reply!! am using the only version that hasnt given me any trouble but as I said they come out as 3.85GB and am just concern about those missing megabites RipBot264v1.13.0 
Meet the Robinsons looks amazing Wall-e is converting as I type. 
Which RipBot264 do u use?"
[T],brickop,2009-07-22T02:06Z,there is a newer version i use 1.14 of ripbot
[T],suavecito195782,2009-07-22T08:17Z,yeah im using 1.14 i would update in try it 4096 should come out as 3.99gb
,teabag87,2009-07-22T22:54Z,"this movie is way underrated

idk how anyone can think it sucks.  I like how the Nolans casted this movie in The Matrix production parking lot lol"
