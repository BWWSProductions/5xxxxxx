[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-21T05:15Z,I don't know how but I missed some drop outs in the first 128k up. A corrrected version is coming - and I am taking some steps this week to improve signal strength / isolate interference problems. I am fixing drop outs and fuzz outs nearly every day and I've had enough - and I'm sure there are smaller ones I miss that sneak through. Expect those to be a thing of the past in the very near future. 
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-21T17:18Z,"Having a slight source issue with the 07-21 64k, I'm on it though - should be up shortly. "
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-21T17:37Z,"Crap - the second source for the last 40 minutes or so I accidentally re-encoded slightly different so I need to re re-encode them. That'll be 15 minutes, than a quick up to the box and then I can post todays show. Hopefully 12 noon or so 07-21 will be up..."
