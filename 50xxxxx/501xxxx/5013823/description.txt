The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien - June 9, 2009

Conan measures his appeal with seniors' focus groups.
Twitter Tracker: the cream of celebrity tweets.

Guests: the actor and beloved SNL alum Eddie Murphy now starring in the upcoming movie Imagine That (and maybe producing The James Brown Story with Lesley Snipes in the lead role), cast member of The Office and pretty blond Texas native Angela Kinsey (former intern at the Late Show with Conan O'Brien), and the high-power combo of music greats Bonnie Raitt and Taj Mahal with a swingin' blues song.
