On the beginning of Judas Rising, there are so many artifacts that it's almost painful, even after reducing the volume to remove clipping.  After finishing this review, I will be ordering the real thing, so I will be able to compare the quality to see if the CD is this bad.  At least it's not as bad as Death Magnetic...

Having been a fan since Jugulator, I've been waiting to hear Halford sing some of the newer stuff, and it's finally here.  "
