                              THE ALLMUSIC REVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Review	by Dave Connolly

Jon Anderson's voice immersed in South American music might seem an unlikely 
match, but the rich and vibrant tones of Deseo provide a strikingly fresh 
setting for the singer. Augmented by well-known artists from across South and 
Latin America, the Yes vocalist seems content to recede into the background on 
many of the tracks, retaining a native flavor with stellar cameos from Maria 
Conchita Alonso, Boca Livre, Milton Nascimento, and many others. The songs, 
which generally clock in around three-and-a-half minutes, are warm and upbeat, 
mixing English, Portuguese, and Spanish vocals with propulsive percussion, 
acoustic guitars, bass, and synthesizers. The melodies are lovely and 
atmospheric, uncomplicated but evocative. The best tracks don't necessarily 
feature Anderson in a starring role: "A-DE-O," "Bridges," "Danca Do Ouro," and 
"CafÃ©" feature the vocalist in a supporting role, but listeners may find 
themselves too entranced by the beautiful harmonies to notice his absence. While 
the singer does take center stage on a number of songs with pleasant results -- 
"This Child," "Floresta," and especially "Bless This" (with Deborah Anderson) -- 
a few tracks leave Anderson exposed, notably the lightweight "Latino" and the 
ill-advised posturing of the opening "Amor Real." However, these occasional 
missteps are easily overlooked in lieu of the disc's innumerable charms. The 
artist had experimented with world sounds on earlier albums with his Yes mates 
-- "Teakbois" from Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe and "Angkor Wat" from Union 
come to mind -- but Deseo marks a genuine willingness to step outside of his own 
idiom. Thus, the connection between Jon Anderson and the music on Deseo isn't 
always clear, but the singer wisely shares his sense of discovery with the 
listener, allowing the music (and not the musician) to shine.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
