Release Date: 23 July 2009
Release Length: 01:16:15
Storyline: Borat trickster Sacha Baron Cohen returns to the big 
screen to offer yet another stinging dose of sociopolitical satire in this comedy that finds him 
assuming the persona of gay fashionmonger Bruno, the self-proclaimed "voice of Austrian youth TV." 
Originally conceived as part of Cohen's cult television series Da Ali G Show, the character of Bruno 
offered a cleverly costumed Cohen the opportunity to highlight the absurdities of the fashion industry 
by interviewing unsuspecting fashion icons and other haute couture hangers-on.Comedy lightning 
strikes twice for mickey-take meister Sacha Baron Cohen when his gay Austrian fashionista runs 
amok in America. In this bargain-basement narcissus' never-ending quest for "celebrity", Bruno 
attempts to seduce a onetime presidential hopeful, adopts a black African baby and provokes a near 
riot at a caged boxing bout in Texas. Essential exposure of redneck prejudice skips hand in hand 
with elaborate candid camera-style con tricks. Borat buffs will know exactly what to expect
