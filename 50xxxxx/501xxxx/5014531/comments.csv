[V],Kitlope,2010-02-28T06:32Z,Thanks Oan! Love this movie
,flynndownunder,2011-09-03T16:17Z,"This movie was originally made in a 4:3 format. It has mono sound but you wouldn't know it unless you looked at the back of the slick (cover) included in a JPEG image with the movie. A DVD upload, I would personally rate it as V9/A9, yes, the sound is quite good. Good human interest story with good acting by both Lee Marvin and his Japanese mate. Don't look elsewhere as I've done that and was disappointed with the copies."
,flynndownunder,2011-09-03T17:30Z,Sorry guys. This movie was originally made in Panavision (I didn't look close enough at the start). Only can get it to play in 4:3. I changed the aspect ratio to get a full screen on my 16:9 Plasma and it still comes up pretty good. Give it a try. Looks even better after a few of beers. Enjoy.
,TrexWarrior,2012-02-01T04:03Z,Thank you.. looks like a good flick can't wait to watch.
,ajjibhai,2012-02-20T16:58Z,regarding the aspect ratio: is this cropped to fullscreen from a scope ratio? or just 'open matte'?
,WeanedOnGin,2012-02-23T07:45Z,Thanks much!
