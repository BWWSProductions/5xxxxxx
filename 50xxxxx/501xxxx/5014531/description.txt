Original version



Hell in the Pacific is a 1968 World War II film starring Lee Marvin and
Toshiro Mifune. It was directed by John Boorman.

Two men, one American and one Japanese, are marooned on an
uninhabited Pacific island. In order to survive they must accept their
differences and work together, despite their two countries being at war.

Containing little dialogue, this film is not dubbed or sub-titled, thus
authentically portraying the frustration of restricted communication between
the two characters. The film was entirely shot in the Rock Islands of Palau in
the north Pacific Ocean, near the Philippines in the Philippine Sea.
