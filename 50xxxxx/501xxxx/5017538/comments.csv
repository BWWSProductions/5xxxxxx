,isisx3,2009-07-24T17:13Z,"Hi, could I make a request? I've been looking for this program Zillatube everywhere and I can't find it. If you could crack it and upload it that'd be really great :) Thanks ahead."
[V],NoExcuses,2009-07-24T18:38Z,"@isisx3
I'm not a cracker, and I've never seen around any cracked version of this proggie till now, so we must wait for it. But you can find other programs that do the same job, and being older you can get the crack for them too."
,sharebird,2009-08-19T01:01Z,"There is a discussion here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5052418/Total_Commander_7.50_RC1_Portable

that the Thinstall app used to generate these portable apps is infected... The apps themselves are scanning clean, but when they run they unpack a svchost.exe, usually as part of a file open dialog.  

We appreciate NoExcuses' efforts and don't want to undermine them, but right now all of his portable apps are suspect.

: (

Sorry mate, but you might want do do what fredpc did, download a different copy of thinstall.

Just wanted to spread the word, because this particular virus hides itself very well."
[V],NoExcuses,2009-08-19T14:51Z,"@sharebird
This is NOT a Thinstalled program. Stop putting this silly comment in any upload... :-("

,plankgatan,2009-10-09T16:39Z,"funkar kanon. 100% working. just install the app, start program, type username & password....done"
,ThinkCreative,2009-12-18T20:21Z,"Great torrent, though I have to say NOD32 thinks these files (when downlaoded) MIGHT be viruses, it gives a yellow flag (instead of red). Got them scanned with VirusTotal for FAT it gives one error and for NFTS 2, so I think it will be safe, already got something recovered!!

Thanks alot, NoExcuses."
,donkeydick121,2010-02-10T18:55Z,"This is a great post. This program is invaluable.

Hope you don't mind but I included it in the Jewel of my Crown at:-

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5338296/Recover_Lost_Data__Systems__amp__Anything_Else_On_Computer.

I made a positive reference to you to show the respect you deserve. And I've voted for your Torrents loads of times.

Keep up the good work.

P.S. Just discovered your secret of making these portable."
,herzan,2010-02-25T21:58Z,You saved my day.  The best program i ever  tried. Thank you.
,BlitzFahrer,2010-05-04T19:56Z,excellent
,cyborg17,2010-06-08T23:01Z,"Dearest ""NoExcuses"" ! 
Allow me to call you: ""My Friend"" !!!
Thanks to your program, I saved 99% from my almost 517000 files (183 GB !) of my external, back-up, HD, after a sudden appearance of thousands of bad sectors, into two days, one month before the expiry of the warranty !
As much as illegal is to upload such programs, as much as illegal is to sell HardDisks which ""break-down"" one month before the guarantee period is expired !
So, Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you !, and the God let's have you, always, in good health !
Friendly. Cyborg17."
,Blackwisdom,2010-06-24T14:36Z,Thanks!
,TheBoard,2010-08-26T03:25Z,"None of you could possibly understand my gratitude toward this program and NoExcuses.  We're not messing with lost movies or games or anything, but rather incredibly important documents and photos (i'm a freelance designer, these photos are my livelihood/life).  Years of work which I thought lost have been brought back.  Truly a godsend."

Also, whats the advantage of the portable version?

Thanks. "
,tom200000,2011-02-05T18:17Z,Thanks works great! lifesaver!!!
,jpjazzy,2011-05-31T21:34Z,"Oh my god... You took one of the best programs ever designed and made it portable... I think I just jizzed myself.

Seriously, thank you so much... This is one of those programs that no one should have to live without. It has saved me on many occasions. Cheers."
,mattdamn,2011-06-11T11:49Z,"Works Great!  I worked for five days trying to retrieve data from a hard drive
that I could not see in My Computer and then I stumbled onto this truly
amazing software.  Just be patient, take your time and in a few moments
that hidden hard drive and hidden data magically appear.

Thank you very much!"
,mattdamn,2011-06-11T12:40Z,"Boot Order - hdd0 - hdd1

Here was my situation:

_I needed the data from a hard drive, named BETA,
  which would be (hdd1)

_I piggybacked BETA onto a working computer, just behind ALPHA,
   which would be (hdd0)

_For the time being I did not need the DVD drive.

_Put BETA (hdd1) in the place of the DVD drive.

_Set the BIOS to boot from ALPHA (hdd0).

_Make sure you have GetDataBack on your favorite thumbdrive.

_Think FOLDER first.  Prepare a FOLDER on ALPHA to accept 
   your recovered data.

_Crank up that old computer, check the BIOS, 
   ALPHA (hdd0) and BETA (hdd1) are both visible.

_Once Windows is up and running check My Computer.

_ALPHA was visible, BETA was nowhere to be found. 
   This is a very bad situation, enter GetDataBack.

_Execute - Portable GetDataBack - on the USB thumbdrive.

_It must be magic, there is BETA and its data, wonderful!

_Copy and transfer the data on BETA to the assigned FOLDER
   on ALPHA.  Tada, you have just saved that important info.

,busteko,2011-06-30T21:04Z,Excellent! I don't understand the negative comments. It works and it does in portable mode. I could recover data from a pendrive whose partition table was broken. Thanks a lot!!
,HJ-Gamer,2011-10-13T07:20Z,"Didnt work
It took 12 hours to repair my harddrive, but if you wanna get the files out it haves to be registered. And it wasnt :("
,juanjo1,2011-12-16T12:34Z,"The onlyone really working and really portable, with your permissions or not, iÂ´m distributing this version. 
Outstanding work to share this torrent, thanks very mucho.
Salut"
,perrul,2012-01-07T21:50Z,Thanks
,fredskidoo,2012-02-12T04:29Z,"Well I took the uploader 'NoExcuses' own advice and ran this program through 
both http://virusscan.jotti.org/ and
http://www.virustotal.com/
Virustotal cleared it o.k. 
BUT Jotti came back with 
BackDoor.W32.Death.25.m 

Consider what sharebird's comment below states so eloquently before passing judgement on any uploaders. 

P.S. Thanks NoExcuses for the heads up on the online scanners - NICE!"
,xxmaan,2012-03-08T21:16Z,how to register?? pls help!
