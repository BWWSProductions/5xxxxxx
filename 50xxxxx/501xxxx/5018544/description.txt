Jordan Reyne is a female vocalist and musician from New Zealand, who operates across the chillout electronic, dark folk, and industrial genres. She combines vocal melody with narrative and urban "found sound" to do what she describes as "recreating the sonic context of characters".


Reviews from her website:

"one of the most impressive musician/ songwriter/ composers of the last 10 years" Nocturnal Hall (Germany)

"File your copy next to iconclasts Eno, Bjork and Sinead". New Zealand Musician.

"The most innovative, emotive and experimental music ever to come out of New Zealand". Salient Magazine (Victoria University)

"This album willl tear you apart - and it may be the best thing you buy all year". Rip It Up (NZ)
