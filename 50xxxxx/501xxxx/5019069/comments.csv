[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-23T17:46Z,"This is my first torrent with the demonoid trackers in it. I may have to delete and repost it, sorry. "
,Craskill,2009-07-23T17:50Z,"Downloading fine here, will seed to be safe."
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-23T17:51Z,I was just worried its not showing any seeds at tpb or mn. But it didn't list it as a private tracker at mn so I thought I'd be alright. 'Fingers crossed'
,buzzard8,2009-07-23T17:55Z,thank you MG
,8675309,2009-07-23T18:28Z,Thanks mothergoose...I lost my job a while ago and had to cancel my XM. I'd be totally fucked without this. It is muchly appreciated!!
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-23T18:42Z,"Crap - unfortunately the first 3 hours of my 128k rip are garbage. Rather than use another source I'd rather wait for the replay and get the best quality file out there I can. 

The good news is this should be the absolute last time (barring the satellite falling out of the sky) I get these drop outs. I only need the first 3 hours but I do have some crap to do tonight. I'm guessing it'll be up maybe 8pm est. Sorry folks....."
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-23T18:54Z,"Yea, tpb and mn pages are listing the demonoid seed count - which is lower than tpb or openbittorrent trackers. Not sure if there's some other way I can do this but I know that demonoid requires their tracker first, at least on the one that goes on their site. I don't want to have to do several different torrents for each file....."
,clauge,2009-07-23T19:12Z,"thanks, MG! The last time Bobby Lee was in studio was f'ing hysterical. "
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-23T19:21Z,"Bobby Lee was only in today at the end because Jimmy was leaving. But they said he'll be there tomorrow, I'm assuming as a 3rd mic as Jimmy won't be in. "
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-23T19:21Z,"Yea, there's 238 seeds right now and the counter above says '74'. Ughhh....."
,djtechsys,2009-07-23T19:53Z,thanks!
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-24T01:00Z,Beautiful CF128K VBR mp3 of today's show up and seeding on a fat pipe in about an hour......
