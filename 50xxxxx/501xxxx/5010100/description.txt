18,000 years ago there was a sudden change in climate which ends a global freeze which had lasted for several thousands of years. Melting ice caps drive up sea levels to create coastlines we recognise today and great glaciers thaw dramatically to re-sculpture the landscape. A mass extinction took place and as the human race adapted to these breath taking changes to their familiar environment, the seeds of our modern society were sown. The Worlds climate changed very quickly, with dramatic consequences for all life on the planet. Today our world is heating up at a similar rate what can the lessons of the past teach us about surviving our future?
