,zingo_punkbuzter,2010-03-29T01:25Z,yes. rar-files is missing.
,rusoaica,2010-05-26T11:56Z,"oh, come on, man! why upload, if can't be used? Don't bother anymore...at least, did you check your   file before uploading? I can see... this is a TRUSTED download :( Shame!"
,lovepuppet,2012-06-04T12:24Z,"When trying to install,  there is this message: 'You need the following volume to continue extraction: UTorrent_DownloadsSteinberg.HALion.v3h2o.r00""

this h2o.r00 isn't included in the .rar.
My advice: if you don't happen to have this 'h2o.r00' don't bother with this torrent"
