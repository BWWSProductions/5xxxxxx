[V],RR-NE,2009-07-20T08:17Z,"Which other? and is MDR, the one I linked you still working? and how many DVD's have you done from it?"
[M],vicerock,2009-07-20T08:39Z,ive ripped 2 movies with MDR and its still working the other program is 4 media not as easy to use as mdr but a much better program
[V],RR-NE,2009-07-20T08:48Z,Does 4 Media have the option of choosing to minimize your DVD file to 300-500 mb?

[M],vicerock,2009-07-20T09:01Z,no not as fast but more of a choice and you could use it as a back up plan in case anything happens to mdr
[V],RR-NE,2009-07-20T09:03Z,"I don't think I'll download it yet, maybe later cause I'm still seeding Fast & Furious..it's the largest SE and LE I have had on TPB."
