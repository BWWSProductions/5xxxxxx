""Widescreen or fullscreen"".  the more languages you leave in the better, spoken or texted . As you go along you will see how others put the info in the title. Welcome to the community hope to see more torrents for you . if anyone gives you a hard time because you didn't use the software they like .  tell them to do it themselves then "
