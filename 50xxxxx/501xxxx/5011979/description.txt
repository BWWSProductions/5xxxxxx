Plot
Set in a universe where men and women are completely segregated (on completely different planets: Mejere by the women, Taraak by the men), the gender wars are more than just a metaphor.

Male protagonist Hibiki Tokai, a third-class laborer, takes up a bet to steal a high-tech humanoid robot, known as a Vanguard, from the male attack force battleship about to fight the "evil females". Caught on board when it takes off, the battleship is suddenly attacked and all males evacuate, with the exception of Hibiki, Duelo McFile, and Bart Garsus. Stuck on board and held as prisoners with female pirates all around, things seem to have hit an all-time low, until the retreating males retaliate by firing torpedoes at the ship, to prevent it from falling into women's hands.
