You said you'd seed longer by request so I was hoping that I could invoke a request?

Although It's been 7 months so if you no longer have the file or just don't care I understand.

Thanks in advance :)"

Couldn't watch Episode 13 of season 1 in Quicktime player for some reason though :S

THANKS!!!"
