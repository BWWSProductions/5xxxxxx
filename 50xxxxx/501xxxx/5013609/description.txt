Jean-Michel Jarre - Jarre In China- Forbidden City Tian'Anmen [Live] FLAC

This FLAC ripped from CD Audio of DVD Box Set : Jarre in China performed in The Forbidden City -China in 2004 

The actual box set contains 2 DVDs and 1 CD Audio so I ripped just CD Audio into FLAC for all of you.

I believe that this CD Audio is not sold separately so please enjoy!
