Announcement

You MUST get this one if you like the period...
Tarantura's second Queen bootleg release pressed in very limited quantities (300?) during May '09. 

It is a superb recording from an alternate source, surely the best audience recording of 1981,
and one of the best Queen audience recordings I've ever heard!
Completely incredible sound for this 28 year-old master...thanks to Tarantura for this gem.

Artwork included

peace, love and shannon hoon!
