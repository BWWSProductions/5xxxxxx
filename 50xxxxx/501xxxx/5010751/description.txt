What better way to memorialize an icon than to tribute a mashup using a Michael Jackson masterpiece (Smooth Criminal) and a song titled after one of the few things in this world that he lived for (Children). So here we have it, the newer remake of Children, originally done by Robert Miles, but this time around Simone Anes took over. Feedback welcome. once downloaded, go into the properties of the mp3, and u will see an email for feedback.
