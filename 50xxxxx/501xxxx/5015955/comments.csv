,lurch1066,2009-08-13T18:36Z,why are there no subtitles when the people are talking japaneese like in the bar when she goes to see the sword maker or after shes killed the crazy 88
,Ikouze,2009-10-12T00:58Z,WTF Why are there no subs when they are talking in Japanese? Where can I find a SRT file for this?
,catamaranman,2009-11-26T03:38Z,Well theyre right....no subs for the japanese part which isnt bad if you know the movie well.....as for me I think Ill DL another copy with the subs included....rip is good with high quality video for the file size.....thanks for the effort!  Ill still seed it! ;-)
