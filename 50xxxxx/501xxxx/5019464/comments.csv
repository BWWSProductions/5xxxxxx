Thanks for the great upload... but your discribtion is missing two little details....
First, you said that we have to create a new folder inside the ""Akousitc Piano"" folder named ""Sample Libraries"", but there is already one! I also tried renaming that one into Library and then creating the new as explained by your describtion.
Then, second: I do anything as described... I go in the finder to libraries/receipts and there are no AP113_ Files... sorry but could you explain the process more in detail? It seems to me also as if there are no samples neither in the basic installation nor in the two ubdates. Please, could you enlighten me? Thanks in advance"
