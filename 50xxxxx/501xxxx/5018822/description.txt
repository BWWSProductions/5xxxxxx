Book - Concepts Of Physics 1,2
Author - H. C. Verma

Excellent books exist on physics at an introductory college level so why a new one? Why so many books exist at the same level, in the first place, and why each of them is highly appreciated. It is because each of these books have the priviledge of having an author or authors who have experienced physics and have their own method of communicating with the students. During my years as a physics teacher, I have developed a somewhat different methodology of presenting physics to the students. Concepts of Physics is a translation of this methodology into a textbook.
The book is one of the best books for physics.

The questions are very good.
