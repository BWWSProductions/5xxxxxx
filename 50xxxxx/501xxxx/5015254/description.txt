Alice in Wonderland XXX Rated Musical Fantasy

retouched version in HDDivx

Alice in Wonderland (sometimes listed as Alice in Wonderland: A Musical Porno) is a 1976 pornographic musical film, loosely based on Lewis Carroll's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. It was directed by Bud Townsend and starred Terri Hall, Bree Anthony, and Kristine DeBell. The theatrical release of the film was on December 10, 1976 in the USA. On May 26-27 it was shown at the Grand Illusion Cinema in Seattle, Washington during Satellites 2000: Screens From Outer Space.

The film initially received an X-rating in 1976 and subsequently, an R-rating a year later with three minutes cut from the film. It was later re-released on VHS with a somewhat grandiose title roll preceding the movie noting that quite a bit of hardcore footage had originally been shot, but "could not be included" at the time. Several reviews opine that the added material actually makes the movie less enjoyable by dragging down its pacing. It has also been re-released on DVD, though whether this release is official, and which source material it was made from, is unclear.
