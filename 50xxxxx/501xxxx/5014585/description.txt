Late Night with Jimmy Fallon - June 9, 2009

Beef Solvers: Clay Aiken vs Adam Lambert
Let Us Play With Your Look - fashionistas go nuts

Guests: the comic actor Will Ferrell - star of Land Of The Lost - who reunites with his SNL pal Fallon for some scripted and spontaneous zaniness (they really feed off each other), the Golden Globe winning actress Kyra Sedgwick who stars in the superb crime solver The Closer, and hip hop artist/actor Mos Def performing a complicated piece from his new CD The Ecstatic (it turns out he's worked with both of the other guests and the host, making him a little giddy).

Note
A public release of Jimmy Kimmel Live could not be found for this date.
