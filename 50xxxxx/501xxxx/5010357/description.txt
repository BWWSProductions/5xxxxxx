Requirements:

IL2Â´46 patched to version 4.08m


=========================================================================


Installation instructions:

1. Make sure you have a clean installation of il2 and patched up to version 4.08m.
This is STRONGLY recommended!
The patch can be found here: (to be added as a torrent try to search for 4.08m)

(This means  you SHOULD use a second il2 installation if you do not want to mess up your previous mods like Unified installer from AAA or other versions etc.)

2. Use 7zip and extract the archive from this torrent to your il2folder.
 (7zip is available at www.7zip.org and is free of charge)

3. After all files have been extracted run the JSGME.exe located in your il2folder.

4. Select a version of mod, preferably the "-Full_MOD" that includes most of the addons. 

5. Run the game.
