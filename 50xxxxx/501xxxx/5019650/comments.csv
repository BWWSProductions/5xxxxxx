[T],nskid11,2009-07-27T22:10Z,"Nope sorry, I'm using a Humax Foxsat HDR, its a freesat receiver, but it has USB ports so all I need to do is plug in a pen drive or external hard drive and tell it to copy. It won't copy HD content though as that's encrypted, and I've not bothered looking up how to take it off the hard drive and decrypting it, but I expect it means removing the hard drive which is to much hassle.

If you google it you'll probably find a way to get it off a Skybox, but bear in mind it'll probably come as a .ts (or transport stream) file."
