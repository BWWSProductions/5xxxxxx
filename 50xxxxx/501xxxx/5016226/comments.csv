With an outfit, and an ass like that, you can''t lose. Or can you?
She looks terrible, is it the lighting or makeup, or both?"
,famegirls,2009-07-22T05:10Z,"Makeup could be better, but hot as ever in that outfit."

,bardfart,2009-07-22T16:41Z,"I will actually put a link to a preview in future, if anyone will be kind enough to tell me how to actually turn text into a link in these comments.

I'm sure it's something really simple, but it doesn't automatically turn any http://... string into a link, and nor do html tags seem to work, and nor is there any link explaining custom codes. So I'm at a loss frankly."

,mepsipunx,2009-07-23T02:06Z,"@bardfart

copy/paste, that's about it ;)  not trying to be an ass, it's just that simple.  be sure to leave a line of space (or 2) between the description and the url or else it may show up as plain text.

hope this helps.  and keep up the good work."
,mepsipunx,2009-07-23T02:06Z,"oh yeah, meant to say thanks!"
,bardfart,2009-07-24T13:07Z,I knew it would be something simple :) thanks
