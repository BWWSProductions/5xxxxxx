Ok peoples this is my first re-encode, what better way to start than with Harry huh? :w00t: Ok, I used Harry Potter and Half-Blood Prince [TS-HQ][Line][PRESPAIN][Xvid][Spanish] (2009) as the source for this re-encode, THANKS very very muchly  :-D . Also Thanks to Stuffies for the direct audio. Now i have used this as it was already synced as this for some reason is a real bother to do. THANKS again Stuffies :-D. For a TS i must say the quality is not too bad. I have adjusted the gamma and luma slightly, adjusted the rgb colours and also ran the video through a noise filter and sharpen filter. Overall i am pretty happy with this release, i am a self confessed quality whore, who normally waits for r5 releases or better. Anyways i have watched this on my 32" LCD and must say thats it looks fine. V:9 A:9 M:8
Enjoy, This is the start of what i have to come....
 :-D  :w00t:  :-D
