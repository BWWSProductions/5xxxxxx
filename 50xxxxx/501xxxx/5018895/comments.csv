[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-07-26T15:16Z,Shikigami has said his DVR is back up so I will not post 14 & 15 unless he needs it. Thanks to the 1 of you who sent me a few bucks for all my past and current work. 
,Shikigami_SuMO,2009-07-27T01:02Z,"Sorry for all the trouble, my DVR was having issues but I managed to temporarily fix it unfortunetly it  totally blew up when I was transferring Day 14 so I sent scifi sumo a message about posting day 14 + 15, hope he helps you all out.

In regards to the daily sumo highlight matches that I promised to upload. I will only be posting DDL links on my blog and not to TPB and they will be around 350megs each (xvid format probably). I will no longer be uploading the 2hour long matches due to my slow upload speeds I always fall behind posting new matches on TPB. So unfortunately I have to stop posting them for DDL."

[V],SciFi-Sumo,2009-09-14T14:36Z,"If anyone wants to see the sumo free use this:



A great resource to watch online
sumo translations on NHK G channel (with more qualitative picture
than
at sumo.goo.ne.jp).
Just download free p2p-player TVAnts:
http://tvants.en.softonic.com/
run it, search NHK G channel there, and watch live 16:9 translation
with japanese comments.

If someone wants to then use software like:

to record the feed and then post it here - you can be the new sumo poster!

Enjoy!"

Minutely better then seeing no sumo at all. Well there is always hope, maybe next basho... And no, live feeds arent an option when one has to work for a living. Thou chances are by no fault of mine i wont have a job by next basho. Then iÂ´ll look into those live feeds. But i beseech you please upload the september basho if you have it. Thank you."
