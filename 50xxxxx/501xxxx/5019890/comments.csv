And then a while after that there was the whole Jacobite kerfluffle, with the warming pan baby, which would make the Duke of Bavaria the rightful king today, so would it be correct to say that Elizabeth is Queen Twice Removed?

Don't be fooled by history books. The real reason for the Act of Settlement was to obviate any problems that might arise from anybody coming back after the fact and standing on ceremony (or warming pans, depending)and getting all picky about who was who's legitimate son and heir and who should really have been where for which Royal Conception but wasn't, by the simple expedient of decreeing that it all started with the Electress Sophia of Hanover, so there!

You'd think that would have been enough messing with the thing, but Noooo.

In 1917, George V felt it necessary, for reasons of political expediency related to the war du jour, to spit a whole new decree that would de-Germanize for perpetuity not only his own immediate family and descendants with gov'mint name makeovers(the Windsors' real name is Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glç«¯cksburg Saxe-Coburg Gotha or something but the Mountbattens (who are really the Battenbergs) and even poor old Princess May of Teck became Princess Mary of Cambridge (at least until she became Queen Mary, a job for which she had been hand-picked, long before the name stuff, by a then-doddering old Queen Victoria, but that's a whole nother story, and holy crap! I cannot believe anybody actually knows this stuff, much less me!
