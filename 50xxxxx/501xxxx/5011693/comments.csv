,cobra-uk,2009-07-29T17:27Z,"cb0279 - You can't get traffic updates without the receiver,or a subscription to tomtom.To put voices or anything else on your tomtom,connect to computer,and open as a portable drive,then just copy and paste."
,BygDon,2009-07-29T18:13Z,Cant get it to work either.  I have been able to get other voices to work in the past.  Don't know what the issue is.
,pops66,2009-07-30T14:34Z,"an ask to all the peeps seeding this....or the uploader......does this need some kinda activation...dumped it on all my satnavs.....
it works on none of them......?"
,weeblpie,2009-07-30T16:55Z,"This worked for me, BUT it first needs to be signed.

To do this, use the EasyUseTools package with this meta key to generate a NEW data110.chk.dct file:

; data110_Homer
D1 C7 C6 C2 AB 65 10 33 9E F7 79 39 C4 57 42 30 data110.chk

To do this put the following in the same directory:

* meta.txt (a file containing the above meta line)
* all of the files from this download
* tt8_keygen.exe

Then run this command (substitute with your actual device ID):
tt8_keygen.exe "".\"" """"

It will generate a new data110.chk.dct file. Copy this .dct file along with the .chk, .tlv, .bmp and .vif to the \voices directory of your TomTom."
,pops66,2009-07-30T19:39Z,"as weeblpie says or 

put the files in the map folder and activated the map with easy activater then cut n paste the files out and into the voices folder

,deathcup,2009-08-18T23:15Z,"anybody got some more in depth comments for how to make this work? 
the Easy activator doesn't seem to like these files and Easy Use Tools does not appear to change the files when using weeblpie's method"
,Cerebral,2009-08-19T11:50Z,"Worked for me (using Tomtom on windows mobile)

First, create a file, meta.txt in the same folder where the downloaded files are. These two lines should be inside:

; data110_Homer
D1 C7 C6 C2 AB 65 10 33 9E F7 79 39 C4 57 42 30 data110.chk

Delete the file data110.chk.dct that you downloaded


Run the program tt8_keygen.exe like this:

tt8_keygen.exe PATH DEVICEID

where you replace PATH with the actual path of your files on the hard drive - and DEVICEID with the id found inside your TOMTOM application, it will look somehting like this (remove space in deviceid):

tt8_keygen.exe c:\downloaded\homervoice\ ABCDEFABCDEF

It will generate a new data110.chk.dct file. Copy this .dct file along with the .chk, .tlv, .bmp and .vif to the \voices directory of your TomTom. 


Done and working for me, exactly like that."
,25789,2009-08-21T15:16Z,Do you know where i can find the DEVICE ID in the application? Can't find it anywhere. :(
,SaXXXon,2009-09-07T02:00Z,tried on htc diamond. gets the right files and anything but when i upload it to my phone i cant find it in the voicemenu. plz help??

,Skye430,2009-11-28T10:21Z,"Um for anyone who is still wondering on how to activate this voice:

- Go to your EasyUseTools folder 
- Open your Prog folder
- Open your meta.txt file
- Paste 
   ; data110_Homer
D1 C7 C6 C2 AB 65 10 33 9E F7 79 39 C4 57 42 
30 data110.chk
And save
- Run RunMeForMetaKey.cmd
- Options 1, 1 and then your Tomtom's Drive 

-Go to your preference and change the voice and thats it :)"
,Madd_Dowg,2009-12-02T20:10Z,does not work on TOMTOM ONE 125 SE it locks it up!
,chipsterd,2009-12-20T00:35Z,so... I spent 2 days trying to get this to work using all the excellent advice given in previous posts. My boss threatened to fire me and I lost about 2 days of pay... and then I simply paid ÂŁ7.95 and it worked perfectly...go figure
,BenDerova,2009-12-29T12:04Z,"Instructions don't work
If so, they are hard to follow.

Thanks for the upload but...
I've tried the Easy Activator, the Easy Use Tools, TT8 Keygen, none of which work.... Yet.
I will continue to try."
,BenDerova,2009-12-29T12:27Z,"Can anybody shine light on this?
This is very frustrating.

The furthest I've got is ""fault in check name id hash"" when it does data110 in the ""RunMeforMetaKey.exe"""
,BenDerova,2009-12-29T12:41Z,"Not even worth trying anymore.
Thanks but no thanks.

*TomTom One (v8) - Go*
*one2008_t_1024_m_tts*

Doesn't work."
,iamabmf,2010-01-20T02:13Z,"Oh my am I glad I stuck with this. Here is how I got it to work for me. Create a text file named meta.txt with the following code: 

; data110_Homer
D1 C7 C6 C2 AB 65 10 33 9E F7 79 39 C4 57 42 30 data110.chk

Then, save this file and the files from the download in the same folder.  Using Alberts Easy Activator select the Use TT8_Keygen.exe for step 1. Step 2; navigate to your device and select the .bif file. Step 3; select the folder the files to add are in. Step 4; select the meta.txt file you created above. Click on Generate the *.meta.dct file. 

Then go to the folder on your computer where the downloaded files are and copy and paste all to the voices folder on your device. Then, enjoy. "
,nutch,2010-01-26T09:52Z,The Homer Simpson voice is now free on the TomTom support website.
,ftzlatan,2010-02-07T19:17Z,i cant do it... can anybody tell me (step by step)how i can make it work? i'm really unexperient on this
,dagobah,2010-03-07T16:39Z,Gonna give it a try.  Still $13 from Tom Tom
,jason2025,2010-03-26T09:21Z,"I also struggled with this, and finally figured out what was causing the problem, so try this.

Put the downloaded files in a folder:

c:\homervoice
Put tt8_keygen.exe in the root of c:
put the meta.txt file also in the root of c:, NOT in the folder that contains the files. 

Run the command:

tt8_keygen.exe c:\homervoice\ ABCDEFABCDEF

Replacing the ABCD... with your device id.

That worked for me."
,alasdair97,2010-07-25T14:40Z,plug in your tomtom go to my computer/tomtom/voices copy the downloaded files there done
