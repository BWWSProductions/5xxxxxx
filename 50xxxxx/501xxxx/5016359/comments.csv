I would love to download from your collection, It would be a treat for my PS3 lol.
Thanks!"

[T],HighCode,2012-04-28T20:26Z,"lame encoding. If you zoom the image you see how blocky it is. 
On a big screen it looks not better then a 720p 1.5 GB encode. still it is the only reasonable hd rip around so far. very funny movie be the way."
