Nacho Libre(2006) PG

After spending his childhood in a Mexican monastery, Ignacio (Jack Black) decides to remain there and work as a cook, mostly to be close to beautiful Sister EncarnaciÃ³n (Ana de la Reguera). So it's natural that when he learns the orphanage is in financial trouble, he pitches in to help -- by disguising himself and joining the professional wrestling circuit
as a luchador named Nacho. But there will be hell to pay if the church elders find out!
