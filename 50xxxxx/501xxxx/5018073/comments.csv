Thats the list in explorer"
,sistromo,2009-07-23T22:59Z,"Who is banning works like 1984, A Doll's House, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Bury my Heart in Wounded Knee, The Origin of Species, etc.? There isn't a single book in this list that can't be found prominently displayed in any decent bookstore in the western world, or obtained online from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Borders, etc. Where are these books banned? In Saudi Arabia or some other Middle East theocracy?"
,2448909,2009-07-24T03:05Z,"OK looks like this is doing well, I will no longer seed. Keep it alive guys!"

Yeah probably, but a lot of those books were banned in America for the longest time, a lot only (relatively) recently unbanned. I gather this is a list of books that have been banned in the past, not just currently banned books."

Exactly, I wasn't aware there was confusion about that. Sorry"
,RL269,2009-07-29T02:02Z,I wouldn't be surprised to find there are (high) schools today that 'don't carry' some of those books
