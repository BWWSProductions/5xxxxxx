Windows Vista Installation Tips

Note: Neither the Windows Vista Business nor Windows Vista Enterprise setups prompt for a key during installation because each is configured to use KMS activation by default. Within 30 days of installation, an alert will prompt user for activation. You must activate the software using your assigned MAK, not by the KMS method. After changing the product key to the assigned MAK, you can activate Windows Vista Business or Windows Vista Enterprise. The two methods to change from KMS to MAK activation are:
Using the CMD prompt: Click Start > Programmes > Accessories and then right-click CMD Prompt (run as Administrator). In the CMD prompt, run Slmgr.vbs - ipk xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx where the key string is the MAK assigned to your account in the Partner Membership Centre (PMC).

Right-click My Computer > Properties and choose the Change Product option. Select Change Product Key under "Windows activation". In Product Key field, enter the 25-digit key assigned to your account in the PMC. Then, select Next.
Note: Disregard the instructions on the screen which state "You can find your product key sticker on your computer or on the installation disc holder inside the Windows package." Instead, use the key in your PMC account.


What is Windows Vista Activation?

Product activation is a license validation procedure required by some computer software programs. Specifically, product activation refers to a method where a software application hashes hardware serial numbers and an ID number specific to the product's license (a product key) to generate a unique Installation ID.

Installation ID is sent to the manufacturer to verify the authenticity of the product key and determine that the product key is not being used for multiple installations.

As a trial, Microsoft first used product activation in some versions of Microsoft Office 2000. Some copies sold in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United States required the user to activate the product via the internet. After its success, the product activation system was extended worldwide and incorporated into all subsequent versions of Windows and Office. This practice has become a subject of debate, primarily because it was one of the first widespread uses of a product activation system in a general consumer product.

An 'unactivated' product usually acts as a time-limited trial until a product key is purchased and used to activate the software. Some products allow licenses to be transferred from one machine to another using online tools, without having to call technical support to deactivate the copy on the old machine before reactivating it on the new machine.

While product activation and licensing servers are common for business and industrial software (especially software sold on a per-user basis for large sums of money), Windows XP gave many casual computer users their first introduction to it.

The system was introduced by Microsoft to curb unauthorized distribution of Windows XP. Activation requires the computer or the user to activate with Microsoft within a certain amount of time in order to continue using the operating system.
