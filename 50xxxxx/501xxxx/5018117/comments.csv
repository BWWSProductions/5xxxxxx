,ser00405,2009-07-27T09:07Z,how to fit image file on standard DVD?
,ser00405,2009-07-27T16:53Z,"Solution found: To shirk the img file I used UltraISO 9 to open (extract) the img file and then I copied the audio_ts and video_ts to hard disc drive and then I used DVD shrink to compress it to a suitable size to fit 4,7 GB DVD. ;-)"

,BuckNaked69,2009-09-03T12:03Z,"Rather than wasting time and losing quality shrinking the movie to fit on a crappy single layer disc, why not take in a few empty beer bottles and spring for a DVD-R DL? "
