Hi. I have all the 8 copies 1975-1985, and have been seeding them (slowly 38K upload) for 8 weeks - as a ""long term seeder"". I will continue seeding until december 16th - (3 weeks off) - and continue seeding from january 6th to january 20th (unless ""Force Majeure""). These dates are estimated, but I need my upload doing other things for about 3 weeks.

All of these 8 downloads seems to be in good shape at this time. 5 of them are seeded by some others, and I'm currently seeding only 3 of them. They will be possible to download as long as there is 3 peers or more in the swarm, but they need at least 8 peers to be ""healthy"".

DL speed will be closer to your upload since there is only a few seeders, but they seem to be easier to download now than they were in october - IF you use a normal uploadspeed and don't limit it too much.

Recommended set is 1978-81 ""The Hill's Angels Years"" if you plan to download only 1 set. You'll find info about these sets at Benny's Place - runstop.de/set04a.html
(set03a b c = 1975-77 D1 D2 D3, etc.)

Please ignore other comments related to problems in october, those problems have been solved. They were related to too slow upload - torrents beeing ""parked"" at 1-2KB/s upload."
