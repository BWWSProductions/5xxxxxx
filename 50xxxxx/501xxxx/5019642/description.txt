The ascent of the Tuareg group from Saharan refugee camps to international stardom is one of popular music's more heartening stories. The standard-bearers of '"desert blues" don't falter on this fourth album, which takes a step back from the sonic clarity of Aman Iman: Water Is Life, in favour of a rootsier sound. The fundamentals are unchanged - the rolling grooves, intricate guitar exchanges, call-and-response vocals - while there's a greater emphasis on the poetic, meditative qualities of desert life, whether on the intense "Tamdjeras Assis" ("Regret Is a Storm") or the graceful "Chabiba", a hymn to youth.
