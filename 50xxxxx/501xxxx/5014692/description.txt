Blame It on The Fish a DVD by Primus that was released on October 17, 2006. This DVD contains clips of songs and interviews taken from Primus' 2003 tour. It also shows random clips between songs and interviews. The title of the DVD stems from an incident in the film where drummer Tim Alexander got food poisoning from bad fish at a restaurant, but still had to play a show that night and performed perfectly.

Directed by Matthew J. Powers Produced by Powers Philms and Frizzle Fry Inc.

The band requested that the film be abstract, artistic, and that the songs not be shown in their entirety.
