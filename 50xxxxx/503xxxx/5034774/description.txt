All 320kbps bitrates are 100% authentic, and encoded straight from the cd itself, or FLAC files...(with exception of This is Our Puck Rock) 256 ogg to 320mp3

All FLAC Files were normalized before conversion... (volume)

So EVERYTHING IS PERFECT! ENJOY!
















==============================BITRATE TUTORIAL=================================

Been a lot of people on the torrent sites claiming their mp3s are 320Kbps...

(highest available quality for mp3)

Below I will show you how to easily determine if an mp3 is truely 320 or just a re-encode...

You will need the torrent listed below to start then follow my steps... 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE

1. Open adobe audition and click on edit

2. Drag and Drop (or add) a mp3 file into adobe audition

3. Click on "View" and then Spectral Frequency Display (Shift+F)


A true 320 source will be 20Hz or above..

128 Re-encodes or 192 re-encodes will be stuck @ 16Hz or 18Hz...

Hope this clears some things up...



NOTE: There is an exception for this rule; oldies,acoustics,piano songs,and low volume music Will have lower frequencies even if encoded with 320!
