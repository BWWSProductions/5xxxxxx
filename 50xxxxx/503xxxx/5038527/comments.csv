[T],FTVDT,2009-08-10T15:13Z,"Version 6.8.1 is available. Is possible to get crack also to this version? This is very good program, but quite often main program updated to newer version. Is possible to do so called ""general crack"" which work also with future versions?"
,raskal00,2009-08-12T16:42Z,"@FTVDT

There is a general crack available, its called ""Buy the fuckin app if u like it so much"""
,pandong12,2009-08-15T01:38Z,"hello ProDvDRipper!

i want to ask if i use this to remove trojan to my keygen that has been detected with by kaspersky, does my keygen will be deleted/get corrupted/unusable  or it will clean my keygen?

sorry for asking this newbie question, but please do reply. i just want to know what will happen coz' i didn't try it so far for removing trojan on a program like keygen. i only use this to a file and in my pc's system that has infected with trojan.

And thanks to your great upload!

,gabriel84,2009-09-27T07:56Z,"Great little program!  It targets all your running processes and everything that really matters unlike most of the viruses scanners that will look for every single file on your computer.

This program really knows where to look for the malwares and it's quick too. nice."
,only1alive,2009-10-01T05:09Z,This program (along with Wise Registry Cleaner) removed all the troublesome viruses from my computer.  Thanks for a great upload!
,ben6ft1,2009-10-05T04:07Z,"I tried to remove a trojan on my pc with this and it didnt work. I still get the ""Internet Explorer Script Error"" window pop up evertime I start my pc. thanks for the app anyway"
,daddie05,2009-12-10T03:10Z,"im on 7, and when i try to run the vista.bat as admin it says in the cmd prompt that there is no trojan remover.exe.  how can i get around that?????"
,mc_homes,2010-11-07T06:12Z,"this one doesn't work anymore, TR figured the hack out and disables the program"
,nafrosounds,2010-11-07T15:37Z,"AVG finds virus Fat-Obfuscated when I try to open the exe. Wtf is that then, trusted my arse"
,mc_homes,2010-12-23T02:29Z,any news on a workable TR?
