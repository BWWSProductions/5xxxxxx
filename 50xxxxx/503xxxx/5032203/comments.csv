[V],n0b0dyh0me,2009-07-31T21:45Z,"My original collection was made by 50 torrents, mostly of fingerstyle guitar, but also of rock, world music.
I deleted them when rumours announced that the pirate bay servers were to be sold to a ""software house"" which wanted to continue the peer-to-peer activity by the payment of a fee...

I understand that Brokep, Anakata and TiAmo (the original TPB owners) wanted to save their ass from the increasing surge of legal actions the majors are trying against them...

I respect this... 

What I really didnt understand were the rumours of a new TPB activity where sharers got to pay to share...

So, in a moment of rage, I deleted all my shares. Personally I reckon that nobody deserves to gain a dime from what people like me freely shared and I hold this point.

Only, from the last news (on 30/072009 at least) it seems that this ""new deal"" will have no future.

So, until no fee will be imposed to seeders nor leechers I will continue to share here on this servers. And I will do this with the poor upload bandwidth I can spare.

If the situation will change for the worst I will migrate to other minor torrent servers (unfortunately not so reachable) but I will let here for some time the trace where to find my torrents :)"
