##### Notes #####

This is an eBook version of Learn Objective-C on the Mac, it is fully OCR'ed (meaning all of the text can be copied and searched) and the pages have been properly numbered to match those of the print edition.

Learn Objective-C is part of the Learn Series for Mac, published by Apress, I have also uploaded various other books of that series, feel free to check them out in my uploads.

If you have trouble following along it may be a good idea to learn/revise some of your C syntax, Learn C on the Mac is a prequel to this book that explains C on the Mac, very well, check my uploads to find it.

Please seed this as long as possible after downloading as my Internet connection is very slow and I will not be able to seed at very fast speeds.

If you liked my upload don't forget to say thank you :).
