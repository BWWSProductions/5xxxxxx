,iphonekillen,2010-01-28T22:55Z,I am seeding but I've a slow internet connection. Since I uploaded this I've learned how to rip the dvd's into 700 mb avi-files so as soon as I've finished seeding this I will upload the episodes in a better (dvdrip) format that I can seed quicker.
,girasol,2010-02-23T16:31Z,I'm stuck at 82% percent - please seed!
,girasol,2010-03-18T15:31Z,"Don't download this, I'm still stuck and there is noone having the missing parts."
,maniacus,2011-02-07T22:54Z,seed please :(
,smilisav,2011-12-30T10:22Z,"Seed this? It is over 3 gig per episode.
I have no intention to download such monsters, nevertheless to seed.

People, google a bit for good codecs and compress. It is much faster than waste your own time (and other's time, and bandwidth...) to upload or seed.

One episode can be as small as 200 MB, while 375 is still good."
