The four teams, "The Knuckleheadz", "The Cops 'N' Bodgers", "The Tartan Starlets" and "The Chaos Crew", drive from the steep hills of Yorkshire to Newcastle, to extinguish a raging fire challenge.

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. So please, do your part.
