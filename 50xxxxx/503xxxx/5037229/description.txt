From July 21 through September 10th, 2007, the Museum for Contemporary Art Tokyo held an exhibition honoring Oga Kazuo, the art director and background artist for many famed works from Japan's Studio Ghibli. Over 600 works from the artist were on display, and numerous fans flocked to the one-of-a-kind exhibition celebrating the lush, gorgeous background artwork typifying many a work from Miyazaki Hayao and other Ghibli filmmakers. International fans of Oga and Studio Ghibli have not been left out, however. The Oga Kazuo Exhibition: Ghibli No Eshokunin - The One Who Painted Totoro's Forest (Blu-ray + DVD) allows fans the opportunity to attend the exhibition, as well as watch interviews and testimonials with Oga's contemporaries and collaborators, all subtitled in English.

The set includes a Blu-ray disc and DVD, both sharing much of the same content, with the Blu-ray disc having the added benefit of true High-Definition presentation. Shared features between the two discs include: a slideshow of all 600 works on display at the exhibition; the 72-minute feature "Ghibli's Oga Kazuo, who painted Totoro's woods"; and a 40-minute featurette containing interviews with director Takahata Isao, art scholar Tsuji Nobuo, Ghibli art department head Tanaka Naoya, and art director Kobayashi Shichiro.

The DVD also contains a 20-minute feature detailing Oga Kazuo's creative process, as he paints the cover for a 2005 art book collecting his paintings. The same feature shows up on the Blu-ray disc, except extended to 35 minutes. The Blu-ray disc also includes an exclusive feature with Oga creating the cover painting for the Blu-ray disc release, shot and presented in HD to take full advantage of the next generation video format. For fans of both painted art and Ghibli Studios, the Oga Kazuo Exhibition represents an uncommon and fascinating glimpse into the mind of a master.
