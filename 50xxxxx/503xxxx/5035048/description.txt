This torrent contains both the Audio CD in its remastered stereo form, as 
released in 2007, plus a short video, which tells the story of DM during the era.  

The video is presented in XviD with .mp3 sound.  There are spanish and english 
subtitles already ripped and a subpack which also includes subs in Deutsch, 
FranÃ§ais and Italiano.  You have to rip it yourself (I currently use SubRip on 
Windows), in order to use them.

Note: There's no 5.1 audio here.  I repeat: there's no 5.1 audio here.  Only the 
2.0 stereo album remastered.  And sounds great!

                              THE ALLMUSIC REVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The full addition of Alan Wilder to Depeche Mode's lineup created a perfect 
troika that would last another 11 years, as the combination of Martin Gore's 
songwriting, Wilder's arranging, and David Gahan's singing and live star power 
resulted in an ever more compelling series of albums and singles. Construction 
Time Again, the new lineup's first full effort, is a bit hit and miss 
nonetheless, but when it does hit, it does so perfectly. Right from the album's 
first song, "Love in Itself," something is clearly up; Depeche never sounded 
quite so thick with its sound before, with synths arranged into a mini-
orchestra/horn section and real piano and acoustic guitar spliced in at 
strategic points. Two tracks later, "Pipeline" offers the first clear hint of an 
increasing industrial influence (the bandmembers were early fans of EinstÃ¼rzende 
Neubauten), with clattering metal samples and oddly chain gang-like lyrics and 
vocals. The album's clear highlight has to be "Everything Counts," a live staple 
for years, combining a deceptively simple, ironic lyric about the music business 
with a perfectly catchy but unusually arranged blending of more metallic 
scraping samples and melodica amid even more forceful funk/hip-hop beats. 
Elsewhere, on "Shame" and "Told You So," Gore's lyrics start taking on more of 
the obsessive personal relationship studies that would soon dominate his 
writing. Wilder's own songwriting contributions are fine musically, but 
lyrically, "preachy" puts it mildly, especially the environment-friendly "The 
Landscape Is Changing."

                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Construction Time Again is the third studio album by the British synthpop band 
Depeche Mode, released in 1983. This was the first Depeche Mode album with Alan 
Wilder, who composed the songs "Two Minute Warning" and "The Landscape Is 
Changing" (as well as the B-side "Fools").

The album was recorded at John Foxx's Garden studios in London, engineered by 
Gareth Jones (who had also engineered Foxx's seminal electronic album, 
Metamatic). It was mixed in the famous Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin (where much of 
David Bowie's trilogy of seminal electronic albums featuring Brian Eno had been 
produced).

The album's cover artwork features the Matterhorn mountain.

The song Everything Counts was covered by Swedish melodic death metal band In 
Flames on their album Whoracle.

In 2007, Construction Time Again was re-released with a bonus DVD. The first CD 
was remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The 
bonus DVD includes B-sides in addition to the single and B-side for "Get the 
Balance Right", a one-off single recorded prior to the album. The album is 
released as originally intended and does not include the bonus extended mix of 
"Everything Counts", but does keep the reprise.

The DVD includes a documentary on the album. The double-documentary discusses 
both "Get the Balance Right" and Construction Time Again, its two singles, the 
making of the cover, the lyrics, and the sampling technology used during the 
album's production. It also discusses Alan Wilder and Gareth Jones, a new member 
and a new engineer (respectively) and their impact on the band's sound. It also 
includes footage of the Construction Time Again tour from 1983, as well as 
excerpts from the music video for "Get the Balance Right".

                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOVE IN ITSELF     by Stewart Mason

The opening track and first single from Depeche Mode's third album, 1983's 
Construction Time Again, "Love in Itself" fully introduces the group's second 
stage after the spotty and transitional A Broken Frame, which had been unevenly 
pitched between frothy pop songs in the "Just Can't Get Enough" vein and Martin 
Gore's more ponderous, mopey experiments. "Love in Itself" integrates those two 
aspects quite neatly: although the overall tone of the song is solemn and 
dignified in the manner of early Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark or some of 
the other, artsier synth pop bands, "Love in Itself" also has a pair of 
maddeningly catchy synth hooks counterpointing each other, as well as a sweetly 
pretty and memorable chorus. New member Alan Wilder, introduced on the stand-
alone 1982 single "Get the Balance Right," fleshes out the reconstituted 
quartet's sound perfectly, adding a depth that had been missing from A Broken 
Frame as well as a richer tonal palette that the comparatively brittle debut, 
Speak & Spell, had lacked. 


EVERYTHING COUNTS     	by Ned Raggett

While Martin Gore had created his share of fine hit singles for Depeche Mode 
following Vince Clarke's departure, most were pleasant rather than deathless. 
That all completely changed with "Everything Counts," which saw both his own 
songwriting abilities matched with an increasing ambition of the band as a 
whole. With a big, full-bodied rhythm, as much indebted to hip-hop's worship of 
the breakbeat and industrial music's own love of huge beats as to disco's 
similar enthrallment, "Everything Counts" remains one of the band's best 
numbers. Gore's lyrical sentiments, ripping into corruption and compromised 
ideals via a perverse singsong ( Gore's own sweet delivery of the chorus is 
particularly ironic in this light), match the brutal work at play. David Gahan's 
lead vocal is a bit sour at points, but he handles himself well most of the 
time, letting the combination of drum machine, sampled metallic scrapes, deep 
synth bass, and, playing the lead melody, a sampled shawm, or Chinese oboe, come 
to the fore. Aggressive and beautiful at once, it can arguably be called the 
first English-language industrial pop hit.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
