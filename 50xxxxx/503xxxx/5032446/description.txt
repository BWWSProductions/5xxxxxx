BISHI BASHI SPECIAL:

It's actually two games on one disc, containing Super Bishi Bashi and Hyper Bishi Bashi. Each game features several unique mini-games such as catching beans, fighting off ninjas or busting a move to make your afro grow as large as possible. Due to the large number of wacky events, this is a perfect game for parties and the like.
