Final Crisis Mega Pack:

I have collected the entire Final Crisis main series and its accompanying series and one shots.  I am a completist, so i had to have the best scans, all the covers, and i tried to not get advetisments in them.  *(Wish i knew of a program to edit cbr's and remove ads)*.  As i bonus i included the sketchbook.  You are going to want to get your hands on some 3d glasses for the Superman Beyond issues, although it is still readable without them, im sure its awesome with.  Anyways i included a doc with the reading order, you'll want to stick to that, even though there is a big gap between legion of 3 worlds issues, its meant to be that way, trust me.
