Note: Enjoy this in HD 720p Xvid in 5.1 sound that can be streamed or played on Xbox 360 or PS3,

some newer upscaling DVD players and Western Digital HDTV Media Player. 

We love the new Blu Ray (Xvid) rips that are out, but don't like how they are downsized to 720x400 or lower,

so we have been making our own in true HD.

We wanted the great sound and video that comes with Blu Ray Rips and keep the higher video size.

Check out the sample and decide for yourself!
