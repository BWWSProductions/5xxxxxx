Storyline: After boarding an airplane destined for Paris, Alex Browning, a 
high school student going on his senior trip has a premonition about the plane exploding after takeoff. 
Scrared and freaked out, Alex tries to tell everyone about the explosion causing him to quarrel with a fellow 
student, Carter Horton which gets them both kicked off the plane. Along with them, Carter's girlfriend Terry 
who follows Carter, Alex's best friend Tod who gets off to make sure Alex is okay, Billy Hitchcock who was 
just in the wrong place at the wrong time, one of the faculty members Ms. Lewton, and Clear Rivers whose motive 
for leaving was just out of belief of what Alex saw. Soon after the plane takes off, the students watch as 
it explodes sending fear and curiousity into their hearts. A little over a month goes by when one of the 
survivors turns up dead. After that Alex begins to question whether or not himself and the rest of the survivors 
are in danger. Could there really be a design? Does death really have a pattern planned out for everyone? 
And if so, after cheating death once, can you find a way to do it again?
