,mautado,2009-12-28T00:26Z,"The first 4 episodes are out of sync.
If you know how to use Mkvmerge set the audio delay to:
ep1: 1300
ep2: 500
ep3: 1300
ep4: 500"

,gkalai12,2010-01-31T12:40Z,"Theres slight audio delay in some of these videos.
VLC Player could be used to fix that; after downloading and installing. go to ""tools"" then ""track synchronization"" and play around with the audio over video delay which is usually about 1s"
