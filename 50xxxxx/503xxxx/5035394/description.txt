The Piratebay is being sold and will no longer be tracking free 
torrents. Tentative sale date is August 8th - bookmark the link 
below so you can find O&A. Even if this sale doesn't happen - the 
owners are willing to sell which means tpb could cease to exist 
in it's current form at some point. Be ready for that day now.

BOOKMARK THIS NOW!! And long live the free interwebs!

Another heads up: I'll be back on the later schedule for next 
week only. That means 64k's up between 12 - 1:30 est, and 128k's 
up around 7ish. Sorry for any issues that causes but it is 
what it is. Should be the last of it for awhile, next "heads up" 
could be retirement depending on how things play out. I love 
getting O&A out to the fans but I won't be able to do it forever. 
Someone else will step up for the community when the time comes.
