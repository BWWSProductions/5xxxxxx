Thank you so much for this by the way."

[T],shuazien,2009-08-03T17:16Z,"But... reading makes my brain feel funny...

So MG, how do you do this thing that you do?
Do you have a Sub and then play/rip through your PC?  Or is there another source you use?  Also, what program do you use to Rip/Edit/Encode?
I will gladly pick up the slack if you retire (If I can) but I really don't see my self picking up an XM radio and getting up at 3AM to press record. Not that I don't want to, however I don't have the $ to spend on a radio and sub, or I would already have one.  Anyway, any info would be great.  You can PM me through Demonoid if you would like.  Thanks again for all the work you do MG.  We all love you and will be sad to see you retire."
,alboy1125,2009-08-03T17:29Z,"hey goose- i just got back to school and they tightened the restrictions on the servers a lot more for this year and its been taking me an awfully long time to figure out a work-around
i was wondering if you knew of anyone who puts up o&a or ron and fez on r*pidsh*re or site of that ilk regularly for my sake for the time being"
[V],mothergoose56,2009-08-03T17:59Z,"No live show today (08-03), it's a worst of. If I see the worst of going around before 1 pm, I'll up it here. If not, I'll post my own worst of 64k/128k rips later tonight (first one up around 7est).
