,TenzoMonk,2009-08-03T22:38Z,over 130 leechers and no seeds? :(  every1 stuck at 21.3% huh...
,ZenRhino,2009-08-04T02:11Z,"Eddie Bravo is a douchebag & has nothing to offer any serious mma fighter-in-training!!!

The Gracie Combatives is a very watered down version of the Gracie Fighting style (itself a watered down & inferior version of Judo) - that really doesn't translate directly to mma.

The Karo Parisyan & Duke Roufus vids are worth watching, but have been available on TPB for awhile now... 

but thanks for trying - but you'd be better off if you actually seed your torrent dude. :P"
,bra1ntax,2009-08-04T04:00Z,"want those eddie bravo videos

,Paulyy702,2009-08-04T19:20Z,"10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu Isn't A Direct, Ready To Use Style, It Requires A Lot OF Traning, and Lets Not Forget, Eddie Bravo Did Beat Royler Gracie By The Teepee, One Of His Own Made Up Moves, So Its Goood For Something.


The Gracie Combatves are Street Defense, Not BJJ 101.


I Knew Judo For MMA Was On TPB, But Not In MPEG Format.

Duke Roufus Is Not Great Quality But, Its Watchable.

Mastering The Rubber Guard, Is In Mpeg4 Format Also.

This Is Just, A Basics, You Need To Know How To Do All Of These Moves If You Wanna Be A Good Fighter, IF You Wanna Be Pro, Why Are You Watching These, Go To The Gym, Or Workout.

Time On The PC, Is Time NOT in the Gym.
GO TRAIN !!!"

,TenzoMonk,2009-08-13T00:18Z,"Please seed!!!  Paulyy702... can you help out and seed your torrent?  Been at this for almost 2 weeks :(  (oh, and thanks again) :)"

,subvertir,2009-08-20T11:37Z,"ZenRhino, you don't know what you're talking about. Eddie Bravo is an awesome guy, and his style is unquestionably effective in MMA. The rubber guard was specifically invented by Bravo for no-gi competition like modern MMA. 

For instance, Demian Maia is an undefeated title contender at middleweight and a world champion grappler - yet he trains with Eddie Bravo to elevate his game. Guess who else trains with Eddie? Karo Parisyan, retard. 

Any serious student of martial arts should study Eddie Bravo's techniques and humble themselves before the work of a master.

,gonzong,2009-08-27T09:50Z,"ZenRhino - you're an idiot for considering Gracie/BJJ an inferior/watered down version of Judo, and for saying that a BJJ style that has some striking defense doesn't translate well to mma.
i wouldn't say 10th planet JJ is for beginners, but if you have good and solid bjj fundamentals, go nuts, it's proven to work."
,bigstang7886,2009-08-28T12:58Z,PLEASE SEED! ive been waiting WEEKS stuck at 70% and i really am looking foward to watching these.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Is A Self-Defense Art, For Smaller People To Defend Themselfs against people Who are bigger and Stonger than a Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Compettitor/enemy."
,DannyBoy734,2009-11-01T19:53Z,"Hi Guys,
Don't criticize this collection. Even if you're a world champion with several titles, there is always something new to learn. But, none of us are champions, that's why we're downloading free combat videos from the net (and not traveling the country doing seminars). In anycase, you don't have to download it if you don't want it!
If you want the whole collection, it's best to download one at at time, otherwise you can find youself waiting weeks without having anything. I've got 12 out of 16GiB, slow and steadily downloading one at a time. I'll share for at least 50GiB.
Long live the web "
