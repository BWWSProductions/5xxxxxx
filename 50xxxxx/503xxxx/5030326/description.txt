Hi everyone! Here are three albums from Jamie Cullum, a cool young Jazz singer from UK. The albums included in this torrent are

* TwentySomething (special edition) (p. 2004)
* Catching Tales (p. 2005)
* Sunday Express (p. 2006) - a sort of a compilation, but contains songs which no other CD has

Enjoy and (of course) SEED! :)
And share lossless music as much as possible ;)

P.S. If somebody has his first two albums ("Heard It All Before" and "Pointless Nostalgic") I'd really like to see them around here (in lossless format, of course).
