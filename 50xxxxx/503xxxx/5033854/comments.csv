,sven068,2009-11-12T21:29Z,"I need a little help. Is it possible to burn it on a DVD-R DL? I used Nero 7.5.7.0 with such a DVD, UDF/ISO-Mode, no mulitsession, ISO 9960 (ISO only, not ISO+Joliet). But it doesn't work."
,MariasLove,2009-11-12T23:07Z,"No, it needs to be a +R"

,ptgomes,2010-03-28T15:27Z,"I've followed instrutions, but my Laguna II can't read it - says that the cartographic data is unavaible. Maybe is the name of the DVD?"
,ptgomes,2010-03-28T15:29Z,Or maybe on the root of the dvd must exist de v29 directory?
,themortgageman,2010-07-19T10:20Z,"Could someone help me out and explain how you convert the file for use in my Laggie, 2006. Thx"
,themortgageman,2010-07-19T10:40Z,"Do you have to convert the file ""V29"" in to some other format before burming to DVD +r or do you just burn it straight to disc as is? if any could help, I would be gratefull, thx"
