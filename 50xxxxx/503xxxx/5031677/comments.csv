,rrenderost,2009-07-30T23:02Z,Comfirm... audio and subs...???
[T],grimreaper420,2009-07-30T23:19Z,"No trailers, fbi/other warnings, ads, previews, bonus features cut it all out.
Just the movie pure untouched, and flawless just like the original.
No Spanish or French 5.1, only English 5.1.
English and Spanish Subtitles is in there.
No menu for those that may have wanted one...sorry.
My info above never said anything about a menu, or else I would have posted that for sure.

If you're still not satisfied, I shall suggest rent/buy it.
This will be my last post.
Enjoy:)"

Use Nero 7, or 8 , or 9
i use 9 now, but everyone has their own preference:)

Also, the last comment, please disregard that, it was not directed at anyone here.
Person in question is no longer here.
