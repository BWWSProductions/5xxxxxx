,TheModGod,2009-10-08T23:20Z,"This game is real. 

I loaded it using CFW 5.00 M33-6 without actually needing a Popsloader package installed. But if you have trouble loading it just use pops loader pack and pops 3.72.

The actual Popsloader package for 5.00 m33-6 can be found here... http://www.filecrop.com/popsloader-for-5.00-m33-6.html"
