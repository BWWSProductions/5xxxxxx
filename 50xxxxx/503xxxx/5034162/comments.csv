This is simply lies thrown in with religious and conspiracy theories. 

However, the music was nice. 

Try harder, fail better. 

The Zeitgeist Movement + The Venus Project = A much better world"
,liddleriddle,2009-09-28T07:17Z,The whole point of Zeitgeist was to expose the illuminati. This movie happily supports this goal and criticizes nothing. Christianity is still fairly worthless as it's a religion of humility- thus slavery. Frankly I am much more interested in the beliefs of the powerful.

,Murphy416,2010-04-24T07:26Z,"But what you have to understand is that while Zeitgeist exposes the NWO, it then goes on to try to sell you the religious believes held by NWO proponents themselves. The arguments against Christianity are the same tired ones put forth by Helena Blavatsky, and the Theosophists, that no modern knowledgeable atheist would take seriously.

 So see you have ended up informed of the political arm NWO only to go on to swallow it's spiritual underpinnings hook, line, and sinker.

As far as Christianity being about slavery, please remember that the Romans, later the Catholics, and the Communists, all considered Christianity a huge threat to their authority. Bible Christianity teaches that truth is between you and God, not you and the government, pope or current ruling party.

People embrace Zeitgeist not because of compelling evidence, but because they want an excuse to disregard Christ. God already knows the motives of men's hearts though."
