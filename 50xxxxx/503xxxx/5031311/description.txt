With the uncertainty surrounding The Pirate Bay's future, we have felt it necessary to create a downloadable archive of all the torrents found on this site.  To explain:
Yo dawg, I herd you like The Pirate Bay, so I put yo Pirate Bay in The Pirate Bay, so now yo can pirate the Pirate Bay, dawg.

This bzip2 archive contains the first batch, that is all torrents in the four million range.  This means 539847 torrents, for an uncompressed total of 16GB.  

If TPB's trackers go down, many of these torrents will need to be updated with new tracker information.  This is trivial using the proper libraries.  Or this script: http://publicbt.com/tracker_modify.html


Want to help downloading The Pirate Bay?  We sure could use a hand.  Here's s simple bash script that will do the job for you.  To run it (*nix only, sorry), save the following text in a file called crawl, then do ./crawl HIGH_NUMBER LOW_NUMBER from a terminal.  The script counts down, so HIGH_NUMBER is where the downloader will start.

#!/bin/sh
START="$1"
END="$2"
i="$START"

while [ $i -ge $END ]; do
      wget http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/$i/$i.torrent
      sleep 0.2
      i=$[$i - 1];




[Note: This download might initially take some time, I don't exactly have great upstream.  However I shall 'Initial Seed', so that for the first seed it should only take ~40 hours]
