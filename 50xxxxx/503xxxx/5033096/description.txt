Set in the near future in Betaville, a self-contained city in which there is no apparent crime, disease, hostility or stress. However, the smooth exterior hides a deeply conflicted and morally ambiguous society. In each episode of this sci-fi anthology series, a council presides, which addresses the issues of that episode dealing with the implications of rapid advances in science and technology.
