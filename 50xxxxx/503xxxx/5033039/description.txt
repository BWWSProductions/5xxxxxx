Programmerâ€™s preface
My objective is to build helicopters for Microsoft Flight simulator offering you a flight experience as close to real life as possible. Not only allow my helicopters the users to fly around, but they also support air transport missions that are typical for this type of aircraft. The Sud Aviation SA315B Lama V4 for FS2004, an earlier add-on for Microsoft Flight-Simulator of mine, already supported such transport missions. Now, I am glad to present a new edition for the current FSX.
Thanks to the help of helicopter operators, pilots und engineers who gave me most useful hints about the helicopter, I finally was able to build this Lama. The Lama allows a helicopter experience coming as close to real life as possible. The given limits of Microsoft Flight Simulator â€“ unfortunately â€“ make a 100% realistic rendition of a helicopter impossible at the present stage. However, I hope you will enjoy your flights in my Lama "X"!

The Missions for acceleration pack
For â€œAcceleration-Packâ€, this software includes 6 training units for the Lama: (They only work with the FSX acceleration pack and they are only installed when the â€œAcceleration-Packâ€for FSX has been installed on your computer)
Sling-load training at Raron and Zermatt You can pick up several objects on the bases and around them. These loads can be flown to a destination of your choice, also up to the cabins. You can choose between an 8 meter or 16 meter sling to fly the missions.
Sling rescue training at the Matterhorn Taking off from Zermatt air base you fly to the Matterhorn cabin, to pick up the rescuer using the long line. Then you fly a dramatic rescue mission at the Matterhorn
Winch rescue training at the Matterhorn Start at the Matterhorn cabin, hook the rescuer up to the long-line, and fly a spectacular 
rescue mission at the Matterhorn.
We recommend you fly the helicopter tutorials in preparation, as well as going through the sling load tutorial using EH101 of the â€œAcceleration-Packâ€ for FSX.
