Kumi Tanioka returns to the style used in the original Crystal Chronicles in this soundtrack for the Nintendo DS and Wii. It features the heavy percussion and wind solos of Crystal Chronicles, but retains the strings backing the orchestrated Ring of Fates carried. Definitely enjoyable to those that found FFCC or FFCC:RoF's OSTs enjoyable.


...Sorry. I don't believe I know which version it is. I'd guess Wii, but it's a tough call. Nonetheless, enjoy some more of this composer's work.

It must not be the wii version.
