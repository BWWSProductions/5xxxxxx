Greatest Hits - Five [2001] - Simon Cowell Executive Producer
	
Amazon.Co.Uk Review - It Seems Like Only Yesterday When Those Fresh-Faced Bad-Boys Burst Into The Charts With Their Angst-Filled Pop Anthem "Slam Dunk Da Funk" -- Four Years Later They Are No More, And So Follows The Inevitable Greatest Hits Collection. Back In 1998, It Wasn't Until The Laid-Back Third Single "Got The Feelin'" Hit The Top Three That The Boys Released Their Self-Titled Debut And Propelled Themselves Into Pop Superstardom. From Then Followed A Host Of Pop Classics Borrowing From Rock, Rap, Soul And Dance--Giving The Boys Three Number Ones With "Keep On Movin'", "We Will Rock You" (From Invincible) And "Let's Dance" (From Kingsize). Always Pitching Themselves As The Antithesis Of "Wet" Boy Bands, Their Greatest Hits Is A Touch Light On The Ballad Side Of Things. However, The Delicate "Until The Time Is Through" And The Poignant "Closer To Me" Do Raise A Smile (And A Tear) Or Two, But For The Best Part It's Fists In The Air, Hard-Rocking, Good-Time Pop.
