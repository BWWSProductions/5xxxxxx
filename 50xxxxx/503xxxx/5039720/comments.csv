[V],Slickinator,2009-08-03T23:25Z,"here are three parts

Part One

1. Open uTorrent
2. Click Options
3. Click Preferences
4. Click Advanced
5. Make sure ipfilter.enable = true
If ipfilter.enable was false you will have to restart uTorrent after changing it to true.

Part Two

1. Insert the file to C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\utorrent.

Part Three

1. Open uTorrent
2. Click on the tab ""Peers""
3. Right click anywhere within the Peers tab area.
4. Select ""Reload IPFilter""
5. Click on the ""Logger"" tab to see that the ipfilter is loaded

Hope that helps and please post if you run into any more challenges.

Cheers
