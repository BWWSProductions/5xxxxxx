LOL"
,TaiTheGuy,2012-05-15T08:45Z,"TPB says 5 seeders. uTorrent says 2.
Some of the stuff I D/L (with enough seeds), I can get at 2 or 3,000 Kb/s or more easily...
It's been over 2 hours & I've gotten half a PERCENT of this! Yes, that's 0.5%!

Someone seed this, please. Is it even any good? Seems like more people would be sharing it if it was worth watching"
,TaiTheGuy,2012-05-17T10:44Z,"Finally!!!
Now, about 2&1/2 days later, after getting only about 35%, somebody is seeding.

Still going pretty slow, but at least it's at around 40 kB/s (ETA 15~ hours), instead of 0.2 kB/s with a year long ETA!

P.S. Every torrent I download that either looks like it might die, or has a fucked up seed/peer ratio, or next to no1 sharing it, I usually seed for weeks on end. Sometimes to a 10-1 ratio or higher.
I'll probably do that with this 1 too"
