,Advmedia,2009-08-31T14:02Z,Why does everymovie get stuck in the first few seconds while the sound plays on? 
[T],fachman,2009-08-31T18:49Z,"Advmedia:
either you have downloaded unfinished/corrupted file or you have some problemms with your system. Try VLC and you will be happy."
,Victory88,2009-09-13T22:59Z,"Hows the subs on this ?
Can u choose not to use it.. ?"
,fishcp2,2009-09-27T07:13Z,"The audio is also strange to me, not synchronised ! Anda I can play all my other movies fine..."
[T],fachman,2009-10-01T19:08Z,fishcp2: Your player seems to have some strange bug I did not personally encounter. I use only MEDIA PLAYER CLASSIC HOME CINEMA EDITION and everything is fine there. 
,JPeterson,2009-10-04T01:40Z,Cropped? What does that mean? Are the sides cut off? Does anyone have a pack with the scene releases from VCDVaULT and REVEiLLE instead?
,Jokkson90,2009-11-01T01:33Z,"Could someone seed? im stuck on 94 .3% and not a single movie is done, only other stuffs -.-'"
,aapkakashish,2009-12-19T14:12Z,fishcp2 is right.. i too get the issue.. i use media player classic and audio is out of sync for every movie.. I switched to vlc and everything plays fine..
,aapkakashish,2009-12-19T14:28Z,okay fixed it... In media player classic -- options-->internal filters.. Check box next to mp4 and apply..(disable filter for mp4). 
[T],fachman,2010-01-07T00:48Z,"there are Media Player Classic and Media Player Classic Home Cinema Edition - 2 completelly different programms!!!!!
Old MPC has synchro bug. New MPC HCE dont!!!"
