,Kkeibul,2011-02-03T17:17Z,Please understand this::::Uploading a torrent is not helping anyone.You need to keep on seeding the torrent.Which means the torrent must be there in the BitTorrent client.Simply saying the torrent must be there in your BitTorrent cleint(like utorrent) and your computer must be on .The reason I m writing this is b'cause I have never come across any manipuri movie torrent which has got one seeder.Always ZERO.
