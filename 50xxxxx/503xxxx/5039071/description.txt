Alchemical Pilgrimage by Snakebeings

Super 8 Film transferred to video :
17 minutes.

Documents the pilgrimage of three monk-like figures as they make their way to the broadcasting antenna at the summit of Mount Te Aroha (north island New Zealand).

On arrival the 'pilgrims' perform a chaotic ritual utilising the 3 objects they have brought with them (a silver suit case containing strange alchemical gadgets, a radio antenna and an incense burner made from a VW hubcap).

 
No-one knows whether the monks pilgrimage has achieved its aims - the transmogrification of the mass media-



Filmed in New Zealand Jan-April 2002

Final edit 2008
