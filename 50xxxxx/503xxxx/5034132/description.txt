Director: D.W. Griffith  (Silent/color tinted with an orchestral score)

Cheng Huan is a missionary whose goal is to bring the teachings of peace by Buddha to the civilized Anglo-Saxons. Upon landing in England, he is quickly disillusioned by the intolerance and apathy of the country. He becomes a storekeeper of a small shop. Out his window, he sees the young Lucy Burrows. She is regularly beaten by her prizefighter father, underfed and wears ragged clothes. Even in this deplorable condition, Cheng can see that she is a priceless beauty and he falls in love with her from afar. On the day that she passes out in front of his store, he takes her in and cares for her. With nothing but love in his heart, he dresses her in silks and provides food for her. Still weak, she stays in his shop that night and all that Cheng does is watch over her. The peace and happiness that he sees last only until Battling Burrows finds out that his daughter is with a foreigner.  Written by Tony Fontana {tony.fontana@spacebbs.com}

Fifteen year old Lucy, the illegitimate daughter of boxer and alcoholic Battling Burrows, was raised and still lives in the rough and tumble Limehouse District of East London. She is the lowest of the downtrodden in the neighborhood, often physically and mentally abused, especially by her father. The one person who treats her with respect is Chinese immigrant and shop owner Cheng Huan, who can see the beauty in her humanity. He originally moved to London to spread the word of Buddhism, however had been caught up in the debauchery common to the Limehouse before meeting Lucy, who transforms his life back to what it was. He nurses her after the latest beating by her father. Despite the purity of his love for her, a relationship of any kind between the two cannot be endorsed by society because of differences in age and especially race. When Battling discovers where his daughter is located, he comes to show the two his version of what is right. Written by Huggo

Young Lucy Battling lives under her father's iron rule. Out one day, she falls in love with Cheng Huan, newly arrived in London from China. This does not please her father, who attempts to break the bond by brute force. Written by John J. Magee {magee@helix.mgh.harvard.edu}

    When using TPB please read these important notes: 
    

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & MALWARE!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
