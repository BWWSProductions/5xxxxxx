Political Correctness - short reading from Daniel Tammet's book

Just a short abridged reading from part of chapter 8 of Daniel Tammet's book "Embracing the wide sky". Daniel is what's known as a "prodigious autistic", gifted with a facility for mathematical and natural language learning. He knows his stuff. And this chapter points out the dangers of the language we are "encouraged" to adopt - the stifling language of political correctness.
