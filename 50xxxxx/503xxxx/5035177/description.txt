Danny Bhoy - Live At The Sydney Opera House 2007

Danny Bhoy (born 1976) is an Indian-Scottish comedian who has found success in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. He is half-Indian and half-European. 

He began stand up in 1998 after going to see his first comedy show at the Edinburgh Festival. A year later, he won The Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award, Britain's biggest competition for comedy newcomers. In 2001, Danny took his first full length solo show to the Edinburgh Festival, where, within a week, he had sold out his entire three-week run, and was forced to add extra shows to cope with demand for tickets.

The following year Danny returned to Edinburgh with a new show. Ultimately a room three times the size was not enough, with more extra shows added at the end of the festival. By the spring of 2003, Danny's comedy started to take a different direction. That year he also entered the Australian comedy market, with his first solo show at the invitation-only Melbourne Comedy Festival. The success of his live work led to various TV appearances on high-profile national Australian TV shows such as Rove Live, The Glasshouse, and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala. In November of that year, Danny was invited to perform on the Royal Variety Show.

In 2005, Danny was invited to take part in the Montreal Just For Laughs Comedy Festival, where the Montreal Gazette described him as 'the stand out hit of the festival.' In November, Danny was invited to take part in the inaugural Las Vegas Comedy Festival alongside some of the biggest names in comedy including Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock.

Since returning from his 2007 tour of Australia, Danny Bhoy is back on the road again. In 2009 Danny Bhoy, returned to Australia, for another tour.
