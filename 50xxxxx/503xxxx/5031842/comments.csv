,anotherdler,2009-07-30T15:34Z,are the subs hardcoded?
,ZmBLivi0N,2009-07-30T18:11Z,"Yep, hardcoded subs. Tried to rip them from the DVD with Xilisoft Sub Ripper but that didn't work out."

DON'T DOWNLOAD THESE FILES:

Zombie Apocalypse Now - Eng subs - by z0mBLivi0N.txt

They don't have viruses or anything, they just don't have complete availability since I altered them. Really I only remember altering the TXT file, I don't know what's up with the other ones.

Sorry to everyone for this. Like I said, it's my first torrent.. and I inevitably fuck up the first time attempting anything."
