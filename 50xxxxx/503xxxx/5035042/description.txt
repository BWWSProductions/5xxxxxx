Release notes:

Named for an extinct Hawaiian bird whose delightful song will sadly never be sung again, O'o is the exotic follow up to The Dreamers, one of Zorn's most popular and appealing musical projects. Featuring the same dynamic band of masters from Zorn's inner circle, O'o presents twelve more lyrical and adventurous instrumentals combining world music, surf, exotica, soundtracks, easy listening, minimalism and more into a fabulous and exciting new music. Beautifully packaged in original artwork by Chippy, this is charming and adventurous music passionately performed by a downtown super group.
