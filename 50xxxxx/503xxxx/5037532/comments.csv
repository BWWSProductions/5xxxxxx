""Burnout Paradise: Ultimate Box"" consists of the full game Burnout Paradise, plus all the Burnout Paradise content that was made available in 2008. Like the ""Cagney Pack"": 3 extra online game options, 70 challenges and 2 new vehicles. And the ""Bikes Pack"": 4 bikes and a day and night circel. The ""Party Pack"": an extra offline game option for 2-8  casual gamers.

Btw great upload dude. Thnx!"
,threephase,2009-10-23T16:36Z,tested and working on sony 2.4x on iXtreme 1.51-final.  Still a 1.2 GB download is required to play online well at least in the US
,osquu_94,2010-04-30T23:21Z,is it wave 3 or 4?
,jakl_53,2010-09-23T03:58Z,"People be careful with this game. It works fine, but EA or criterion is keeping an eye on this game. I got my internet shut off for downloading this game."
,les907,2010-12-05T02:03Z,Anyone else getting a 000 file instead of an ISO file? I am and don't know how to convert. I use DVD Decrypter recognizing ISO files to burn Dual Layer. And Google tells me nothing else. Help?
,skbbks,2011-06-11T21:53Z,Just in case anyone else has the same question:  simply rename the .000 file to .iso.
,abdul.ngi,2012-02-12T13:54Z,"when i trying to play this game on XBOX 360 its telling that ""To play this disc, put it in an xbox 360 console"".
could any one please tell what to do now?"
