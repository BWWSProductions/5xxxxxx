Why are you uploading this torrent? Version 10.4.0 is old. Here's a newer version: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5028866/Friend_Blaster_Pro_10.5.0_-_inc_1_000_000_MySpace_ID_s._clean

It's 100% clean too, uploaded by me ;)"
,extincas4,2009-07-31T20:16Z,"im uploading it becase i want to. 
there is no noticable difference between the two the versions.  
advertise for your torrents on my page thats fine but please dont question why i do something. "
,Rathyas,2009-08-05T23:52Z,"@ extincas4 - The only noticeable difference between this version, is that it works.
Unlike dkent4000's, whose doesn't work.

Thanks for the upload.
I'll seed for as long as possible.

@ Everyone Else - Do NOT download dkent4000's upload. It doesn't work.
Stick with extincas4's."

Its one thing to re post someones crack and give them credit but you put Cracked by me. nice try buddy. your a fake bro. kids like you(im sure your like 16) dont belong in this culture. "
,ektakrome,2009-08-29T23:50Z,"I downloaded this program and it worked fine...until today when a new version became available and it wouldn't let me use the program anymore.

Is there a way to keep this program from not looking for updates?"
,guy_wild,2009-10-31T20:17Z,"Block it in your firewall.

j/k"
,electropunketo,2009-12-12T04:10Z,omg lol wtf brb lmao
,Dysprositos,2010-03-10T06:58Z,@ektakrome You should of read the readme that said do not try and update because the crack does not work with the updated version. This is a great program and works if you follow the directions.
,snarfdogz,2010-07-13T04:58Z,"A little bit lost.. when i try to use crack i get a error saying \""unable to locate path specified..\"" when i look for file and find it.. it still wont patch... keep getting error? any ideas?"
