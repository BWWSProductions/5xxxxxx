Dude, does someone in the film says or suggests that there's no God? I certainly don't see a comment here that says that. "
,Tamarind777,2010-04-10T07:56Z,"If you made a typo and are suggesting there ISN'T a God, since there isn't any ""proof"" then you have even bigger problems. Your argument is a typical brainless one used by atheists everywhere. This underlying argument is that since there's no ""proof"" of God, then He does not exist, which is to say that you only believe things that are proven to you, that you don't believe anything by faith. If this is what you mean, let me ask you this: how do you know your parents are who they say? You're made into a liar, because I am sure you never asked them to prove to you that they're your genetic parents, did you? If you say you've seen a birth certificate, that's no good, because anyone can forge documents. Fact is that you simply go on faith that they are who they say they are. You have absolutely no proof. In other words, you're a hypocrite and a liar and God will use even this to judge you in the end. You don't have a problem with faith, only faith in God. The reason is God has rules and you want to have sex with whatever or whomever your want, you want to smoke and drink whatever you want and speak (the way you do now) and not face any judgment for any of this. In other words, if God never asked you to be like Him and be holy and pure, you'd never have a problem with him at all. If there was no judgment there wouldn't be ONE single atheist around."
