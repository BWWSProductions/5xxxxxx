,Proctie,2009-08-03T14:37Z,"Dude... Can't you guyes seed over 11 kb/s ? Im download at 10-12 kb/s, so frustrating.."
,Proctie,2009-08-03T15:40Z,23 out of 819 seeders is active.. Jezzz..
,xiIix,2009-08-04T08:41Z,"Would you guys please SHUT THE FUCK UP?!! ALL seeders are seeding, and ALL leechers are sharing. In order to be a seeder you have to be *seeding* a full file, in order to be a leecher you have to be *sharing* a partial file. And believe it or not, leechers are more responsible for a torrent being fast than seeders are.

If you are only hooking up to 23 seeders, that is because of MANY reasons, a few of which are a result of your local setup like client/router/modem/OS options. The rest, a result of proxies, network throttling and IP sector bans, DNS servers, the list goes on... and on and on."
,shavedaccord,2009-08-04T10:54Z,"lol.. wow, this has got to be one of the worst games I have ever seen. I mean I knew it was going to be bad, I was hoping of getting some slap stick entertainment from it.. but I didn't even get that. "
,PirateEcho,2009-08-04T19:28Z,"Black screen, then ""Error during 3d initialisation"".
What's up?"
,shavedaccord,2009-08-04T21:39Z,"@PirateEcho

You need to install the DirectX & Ageia PhysX during the install. At least that worked for me. Even though you don't need those, some reason the game won't run unless you do."

,Rathyas,2009-12-09T16:23Z,"I have no idea why people are criticizing something that isn't even intended to give the experience of a driving game.
What people obviously don't realize at their current age, is that this is NOT a game.
It should be clear to you that it's simply a driving simulator; nothing more, nothing less.
This wasn't meant to be 'fun,' but you people are surmising that it would be the implication of the company to do so. I think it's great and serves its intended purpose. 
If you're looking for a freaking driving game, download or buy Grand Turismo and crap like that."

,AbganExplor3r,2010-10-07T21:07Z,"For those whom think this was a game, ITS NOT! It's overpriced software used in driving schools to train tweeners to drive!"
,Takedam123,2010-10-09T15:39Z,"Hello,

Wow,you guys take this as a ""Game""?It's not actually.It's a DRIVING SIMULATOR which simulates DRIVING..Get Dirt 2 or Test Drive Unlimited or Gran Turismo"
,siddharthshinde,2010-12-06T15:37Z,"it works perfect, thank you for the upload, but i don't like it too much, i hope they come up with a good driving simulator soon!
n lol at ppl who downloaded this thinking it would be a game ;)"
,LockRobster,2011-01-28T05:20Z,"for the people who are lol'n at the people who think its a game, how bout looking at what section its under? Maybe applications would be more appropriate"
,major9211,2011-02-01T14:25Z,"Oh my god...what a waste of time and money...thank god we never spent it ...now if you want a program which shows a car on the road then go buy or download a car game, this one is the worst I saw, there is nothing of a simulator here, I have a G25 wheel which works with this so called simulator like atari control...long story short...I wanted to teach driving to someone and wanted them to try it on a simulator first, so I downloaded this shit,the problem is.... no clutch, no normal gear shifting, no reality with a vehicle or vehicle physics, I dont know why they made this thing...frankly speaking I love torrents as they give us an insight of programs so we can buy a better one.

the developers should drown them selves in mud as they released this shit in 2009 after dirt, toca, and need for speed, I dont know what I should call it...its not a game and not a simulator.
I hope you find my comment worthy."
