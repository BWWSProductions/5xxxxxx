"Sweet Dreams" is a song by American R&B singer BeyoncÃ© Knowles from her third studio album, I Amâ€¦ Sasha Fierce (2008). Written and produced by Knowles, James Scheffer, Wayne Wilkins, and Rico Love, the track was released as the album's sixth single.

The song was leaked before the release of I Amâ€¦ Sasha Fierce under the title "Beautiful Nightmare". With the release of the album, the song name was changed to its current title, "Sweet Dreams". This song was selected as the sixth single from the album as a last-minute replacement for "Broken-Hearted Girl". The song is used in the commercial Knowles did for Crystal Geyser.

"Sweet Dreams" was critically lauded, with critics praising its dark tone and its electropop sound. The Times was impressed with the song: "Sweet Dreams, with its deep bass, and disturbed lyrics, is thrilling."

MTV calls the song "great," commenting that "The gnarly low end (which kind of sounds like Michael Jackson's "Beat It" for about half a second), the spare snare kicks, the expansive-yet-molecular chorus â€” sonically, it's as adventurous as anything she's ever released. And her vocals â€” icy and cool, slippery like mercury â€” are nothing to scoff at either.
