,Infectious99,2009-08-07T22:27Z,"Hm, I have Windows 7 Ultimate, Build 7600.
I just installed yesterday, and I got asked for a serial while installing..
So I figured I'd have to activate it.

I tried an activator, NOW I have the little 'Watermark' in the bottom telling me I have an evaluation copy..

This activator didn't seem to fix it, and I am running x86 aswell.. hm?"

The prog tried to start a svc that was running already but that's quite alright."
