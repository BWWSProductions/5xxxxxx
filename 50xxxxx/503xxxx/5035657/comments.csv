"
[T],Apokarteron,2009-08-02T01:08Z,Does this one work or is it the same flawed on that's on Brokenstones?
,Demonic_Prototype,2009-08-02T01:16Z,"@Apokarteron this has been working so far for me.
@tazmania4 it is a russian site that cant be posted. This is why i am giving you the torrent straight from the site because it was hard to find."
,YCL06,2009-08-02T04:03Z,"This FCS3 make ERROR, the only way to instal FCS3 is installing the FCS2 an then upgrade to FCS3 without content. I do this and working perfect.  "
,dabi,2009-08-02T08:04Z,"How was this hard to find?
I also got the this file from the russian forum, registered there and got it.
Just use Google Translate if you're like me and don't speak russian."
,tatayo99,2009-08-02T10:06Z,"@Demonic_Prototype
You said ""this has been working so far for me.""
With all contents or not ? this is the question ..."
[T],Apokarteron,2009-08-02T12:39Z,Do the Content disks work?
,YCL06,2009-08-02T14:33Z,No the content disks doesn't work!
,tatayo99,2009-08-02T14:43Z,"@YCL06
Are you sure you have the same torrent ?
What i don't understand if this stuff is also the broken one, why we have only 1 source running on the web..."
[T],Apokarteron,2009-08-02T15:51Z,"Since the images are .toast files why don't you try mounting them with Toast Titanium instead of Disk Utility, let me know if it works."
,tatayo99,2009-08-02T19:51Z,"This is the problem, they are Toast image, !
Of course they can be mounted easely but,
all the files posted here as elsewhere are corrupted, they are all shares of the original share which was corrupted. Don't waste your time or bandwidth downloading these.

Regarding the mess of corrupted releases that have been showing up on nearly every bulletin board, The image files were created improperly from the beginning.

The ""physical"" FCP Studio 3 DVDs from Apple must be created disk with Apple's Disk Utility ? and nothing else!

In Disk Utility ? to be safe ? select the top of the device tree on the left side pane, of the currently inserted DVD, for the disk image to be created.

The choosen format can be ""compressed"" or ""CD/DVD Master"", this insures to get proper disk images, regardless whatever file system or boot mechanisms may be used on the originating discs.

Then SHA-1 or MD5 checksums for these images should be created, from inside the Terminal or for example with checkSum+.app.

Finally post these checksums (and how you created them) along with the dmg files, so in the future we can be sure of any images popping up are the real ""uncorrupted"" deal and just a rehash of the bad files."
,PhlipRock,2009-08-03T02:14Z,"Yes, this is a torrent of a torrent file. So once you download this torrent, you get to start another torrent. The actual file is 45+ GB and the tracker is no longer accepting new leechers. 

So next time, please seed the actual FILE on TPB, instead of a torrent file to another tracker."
,tatayo99,2009-08-03T10:15Z,"@Free-ak
Downloaded for you and tested ?
Thanks for us ;-)"
,Free-ak,2009-08-03T16:07Z,Ok I think these files are messed up. I keep getting errors. Probably the toast files. :( well that's 3 days of my life wasted.
,freeridediablo,2009-08-03T18:44Z,thanks a lot for this torrent. I really appreciated it that you postet the torrent.
[T],Apokarteron,2009-08-04T21:22Z,"Try changing the extension from .toast to .dmg or .iso, let me know if it works."
,tatayo99,2009-08-05T00:36Z,"they are corrupted, it's not a simple question of ""extension"""
,tazmania4,2009-08-05T00:38Z,where is this russian site maybe ill find how
,tambogabr,2009-08-08T11:37Z,"corrupted suite, only the first dvd works correctly. All the content are unusable"
