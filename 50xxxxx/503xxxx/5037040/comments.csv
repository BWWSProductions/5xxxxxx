Politics = any shit can have much power...
I hope that queer burns in hell forever."
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-02T13:34Z,"OK ant16 now you told me now I am clarified about father Christmas. I was waiting all my live for you to tell me that revalation... about the other part it is up to you to believe in what you want to believe... as for me I believe Hell (or Hades) exist and that's where rats like Hitler will really pay for what they did... another thing how do you think (or explain) that something like even a small bee exist and has life, in the only planet that has known to have life in the Universe... and humans are the only that evolved to become conscious and intelligent beings in the Planet??? coincidence...?? well that looks like a joke (or a fairy tale)to me... worse than the father Christmas joke... much worse..."

,r0ttiem0m,2011-01-23T07:32Z,Thank You so much for posting this upload.  To really understand what my relatives (and others) lived through during WWII is to know atrocity.   Seeing through their own eyes & documentation really grabbed me by the throat.  Can't remember crying this much during any documentary before.  Very powerful & eye opening.
