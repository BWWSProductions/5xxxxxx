Do you have the DVD full version

By the way map id is 2006 for unlocking."
,kwacka,2009-07-30T09:21Z,I don't have the mapsource version but I do have the additional files such as 3D Buildings and Junction View and yes the map ID is 2006 but not required when placing .img on a SD card or PNA. However if you want to read the image under Mapsource using for example MapSet Toolkit and cGPSmapper then you may need to use Jetmouse to create an unlock code using ID 2006

Just a general comment. The latest voice files (Nuvi 310) are an issue with the 2010 maps. Street name pronunciation is incomprehensible. Previous voice files work OK. 

By the way. How did you unlock the map? "
,kwacka,2009-08-03T12:32Z,"idaib, I won't pretend to know much about the nuvi 310 because I don't but I did find this http://www.gpsinformation.org/allory/garfeat3.htm#nuvi310
it lists current versions of your operating system, the latest is version 5 and there are reports of speech problems with versions of 4.7 and less, might be worth checking out. As for the map, I can take no credit for unlocking it, that honor goes to a quite achiever out there on the net. I have only used this image file in my nokia n82 symbian 60 version 3 phone and it works great."
,kennykillerkoala,2009-08-03T14:21Z,"I got this yesterday from another  source and it works well with XT.

I haven't downloaded this torrent but it will be interesting who the arseholes are that don't seed and piss off Kwacka.

I seeded his last year nt2009 for 48x didn't get the tomtom one and it went to shit.

Anyone wanting a list of Optus and telstra fuck wits as they wont re seed I have just made a full list from last week. BooHoo go cry to your poofter friends in whirlpool .net 

There is also or should be 3D maps in this for GPS that support it.

,kwacka,2009-08-04T05:16Z,"hey kennykillerkoala, i seeded this for about x10 and it took off, at one stage there were about 22 seeders and also as many leechers.
I also have the new tomtom map version 830_2290 Australia, current as of this date anyway, i loaded it up on my tomtom one xl and works great with navcore 7.903.9183. With the new patching tools around at the moment it's very easy to patch navcore and use a keygen on the map.  "
,idaib,2009-08-06T23:04Z,"kwacka,

It's the latest of everything that is the problem. I had to roll back to the second last voice file."
,mrcool789,2009-08-08T01:33Z,"Thanks,
Works Perfect!
Put it on a Kenwood Car Device All I Had to Do Was Rename the File From ""gmapprom.img"" to ""gmapsupp.img"" And Everthing Worked
Thanks Agian!"
,rsoni,2009-08-22T16:57Z,"Hi kwacka,

Would appreciate if you could also share the additional file for 3D buildings and junction view.  Thanks

Thank you so much for sharing this one."
,Nae71sa,2009-11-02T09:44Z,Trying to download the Garmin australia new zealand map software any ideas how pls?
,summer16,2009-12-06T02:18Z,"Does anyone know if this will work with the Streetpilot c330?  I have no idea how to load it and use it, please help!  Thanks!  Really looking forward to my honeymoon... this will be hugely helpful."
,glomas1,2010-06-18T11:36Z,"Are you able to upload the 3D Buildings, and Extra detail files too please?"
,poiuy666,2011-01-05T02:00Z,"Thanks Kwacka, greatly appreciated.  Being completely technically challenged it took me a while to figure how to make this work.  As per mrcool, I had to rename the map to gmapsupp.img (after of course renaming my European maps which I bought under this filename, which has made them currently inaccessable on my device) and all is working fine."
,fossil44,2011-07-23T04:37Z,your torrent is a pile of shit
