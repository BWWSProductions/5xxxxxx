About The Games
The third game in the popular MechWarrior series. Massive Mechs, awesome
firepower, and 3D action combine in MechWarrior 3. The tremendous
attention to detail in the graphics, gameplay and virtually every other
aspect makes this one of the best games of the 1990s, let alone 1999.
Flowing landscapes and wonderful animation are all well and good but
MechWarrior 3 goes one better. Shoot off an enemy Mech?s leg and you?ll
see the pieces go flying as the enemy crashes to the ground. Drop a
Smoke Jaguar tank and you?ll marvel at the intricate explosion.

MechWarrior 3: Pirate's Moon is the expansion pack for MechWarrior 3,
with an all new storyline and 20 new missions, plus six new 'Mech and
a number of weapons. The player has the choice to play as either a
pirate (attacker) or as 'Lance Leader' (defender) for the Eridani Light
Horse. Unlike in the original MechWarrior 3, your character in the
expansion has a voice and speaking lines. This story is essentially
what happens to your character and lancemates after the events of
Mechwarrior 3.
