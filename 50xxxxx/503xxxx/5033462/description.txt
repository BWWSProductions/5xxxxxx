7.04a

   This update mainly corrects an error in the delete function: It could
   delete the file under the cursor instead of the selected files if the 
   current directory was changed in the background while the delete confirmation
   dialog was up (only when the function "Auto-Refresh when the file system
   changes" was active). It also corrects problems with unpacking multi-volume
   RAR files, AES encryption on NT4, and an access violation when starting
   minimized to the system tray. We recommend that you install the update as
   soon as possible!
