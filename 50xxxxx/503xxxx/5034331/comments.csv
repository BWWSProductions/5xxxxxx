P.D. check ""Les Luthiers"". It's in spanish but simply hilarious"
,frnortner,2009-10-07T21:54Z,"Fantastic! I have never been to a PDQ Bach performance, but I've now got enough miles stashed away to go to the next one. Schickele has tickled me for so long in so many ways. Spike Jones with a Classical twist. Thanks so much for the upload, I'll seed it as long as there is demand.
Any more Schiele/PDQ Bach videos out there?
