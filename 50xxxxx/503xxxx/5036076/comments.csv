,fowlermac,2009-08-16T15:11Z,"cheers lotsoflemon now apple will see the serial and will black list it. grrr why does everyone have to comment the serial. Its more secure for people just to donwload. theres bleady 120 seeders and no leacers and it's only a couple of bytes.

you may have ruined it for everyone here"
,merve999,2009-08-17T09:28Z,"will this work for all of the logic studio (including content)? thanks,

,alelp69,2010-02-11T17:50Z,"thanks lotsoflemon, i was looking for a working serial for the better part of an hour. Thank god i finally found one!!"
,satnapar,2010-03-10T09:32Z,and now there is mainstage 2.1.1 needs serial again.... ;-(
,therif,2010-03-20T19:54Z,Is there any serial for logic 9.1.1?? I need it and I can't find it anywhere... Don't have the money to buy a fresh copy
,Slimshady08,2010-03-20T20:59Z,"Could Someone please send me a working serial for 9.1 ? I promise not to post it.

Thanx a million."
,vslink,2010-03-21T06:50Z,"Therif, I don't think there is one out there yet. Hopefully, pirates will get wind of the fact that the serials posted here got invalidated with the 9.1.1 update, and soon we will see new volume serials that people will treat more discreetly."
,vslink,2010-03-21T22:24Z,"This fix works beautifully and does NOT require a new SN. I have 9.1.1 and 2.1.1 working fine again:

http://www.demoXXXXXXXXXnoid.com/files/download/2174367/32917304

A login or membership does NOT seem necessary to access that torrent file.

I figure that everyone knows to remove the Xs from the above URL."
,gintsesen,2010-04-07T15:39Z,"still looking for logic 9.1.1 serial, if anyone knows where to get it, it would be nice ! Thanks !"
,chaostastic,2010-04-12T15:44Z,"IXL Software, drop dead!"
,plume,2010-04-15T16:09Z,"@lotsoflemon

Don't post serials you fool, that's how they get blocked.  There is a good reason for putting just a serial in a torrent.

@vslink

This worked perfectly for me on 9.1.1 - thanks.

@IXLSoftware

Piss off.  You have no right to use this site to make personal profits out of piracy.  There is a big difference between pirating something you cannot afford to buy and making money out of it.  I hope you get caught."
,eljuanlux,2010-05-05T20:47Z,"This code E-330-DOX-030-NJB-265-AKZ-414-BVZ-M2E-41HX works fine, thanks !!"

,shauns303,2010-10-22T13:13Z,"Ive just updated from Logic 9.0.0 to 9.1.2, and all of the serials posted on pirate bay no longer work. Probably because you all keep posting them. Has anyone got a working Serial for 9.1.2 ??? Could you please upload it? Or let me know and ill give an email address to send it to. 
Thanks"
,davish123,2010-10-31T21:03Z,"9.1.2 serials are everywhere, google more. 9.1.3 however isn't as it is so recent. Anyone got any luck with finding something for the update? Thanks"

,ocdcyo,2011-08-09T19:04Z,"Ohhhhh man - can any of you help? 

Upgraded to Lion 10.7. Ran Logic - it said that my version would not work with Lion, and that I needed to update it. I did this update of Logic to 9.1.5, forgetting it would wipe the serial. 

Does anyone have a serial number that will work with 9.1.5 or a way around it? I'm f***ed if I can't record and there's no way I can afford to buy it.

Thanx   claire."

,radiculare,2012-02-20T13:10Z,"Hey. The Logic studio 9.0.0 doesn't work on Lion, it need the 9.1.6 update - which isn't available with the mentioned serial. http://www.apple.com/logicpro/download/  When trying to download it says: ""It appears you already downloaded the update"" - bullocks...
