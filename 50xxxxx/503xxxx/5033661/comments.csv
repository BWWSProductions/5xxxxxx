A lot of striped flags that dont seem to want to seed but want to download... dont be greedy and if your afraid of laws or w.e its the same to upload then to download so lets make it faster for everyone and Make downloads and uploads unlimitted its not like its gonna take allllllll of it.. jeez.. just pisses me off...
,erhoman,2009-08-01T06:15Z,"BTW.. thanx AMDm, i'll comment when i finish downloading to see how it works... but anyways thanx a lot"
,AmdM78,2009-08-01T07:03Z,"Thanks erhoman

That´s the spirit, share is about not only to take but also to give.
It just bothers me that in 5 users that had completed the download only 1 is seeding :("
,djsimon23,2009-08-01T10:45Z,can people not just write if it works or not and dont slag people off if it wasn't for them there would be no piratebay. respect the good guys who are sharing like AmdM78. Finaly dont just download make sure u share what u have downloaded. I'm downloading this just so fingers crossed

,stvlite,2009-08-02T01:08Z,"@AmdM78, I have a few questions about this torrent.

Does the following build string match the version within the torrent?:
6.1.7600.16385.090713-1255

Will it be necessary to activate this version of windows and if it is, what is the method, or is there some kind of hack or fix?

Is the installation procedure the same as installing windows 7 rc?

Is there an option to upgrade to this version from the RC?

Thank you for your time.

Yes, you have to crack it.

That would be an downgrade.

Don´t think so, but im not sure.
Google it a little bit.
A clean install is always prefereble though...

Windows 7 will offer you the most basic disc tools in one of the instalation menus.

For advanced tools i recomend Gparted

I didnt know that, but i used my toshiba recovery discs which has a harddisk formatter and it erased all data on harddisk 0 OS nothing nada, loaded up the dvd it booted everything went really fast and now im typing using windows seven after creating a shortcut of all the programs installed. This is a Huge aport from your part. But i will have to download again for me to seed again yikes! forgot to back that up. Any ways i dont know if it was already cracked but i entered a serial that was going about the webs and wallah all good apparently i have it activated i dunno nothing has appeared. Thank you alot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I installed this not a porblem on install. Cracked it not a porblem on activation. Ran updates on Symantec not problem on updates. Ok the security center does not recognize Symantec. Windows update didn't like the Office Enterprise  key. I thought no big deal uninstall office and Symantec. I attmpted to uninstall office with the plan of reinstalling my own copy. 90% way through the unistall the MSI crashes saying language not supported. I couldnt not run the unistaller again. I reinstalled by key and office Enterprise over it. Nothing but errors and crashes in Outlook. Ok I am thinking uninstall Symantec and reboot. Look at office after. Not so easy. Network protocols were hung after uninstall of office and reboot. Could not even recieve an IP address from DHCP. I entered an IP add manually. Still would not register with DNS. OK....so I gave up and reformatted. Installed an untouched ISO that did not have any preinstalled programs slipped streamed in. Few, activated it...installed my office, Defrag, AV yada yada...runs nice. NOW."
