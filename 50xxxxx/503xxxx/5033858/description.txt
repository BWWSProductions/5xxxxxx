are you tired of blacklisted kaspersky keys? we all know they get blacklisted every day. 

this is kaspersky internet security 2010 with a registry hack .
what i have done is show you how to trick kaspersky into thinking it is a Beta release. this gives you FULL COMPLETE use of kaspersky just like a registered version. i detail in the tet file how to go into your registry and change this. 
this works 100%. 
FOLLOW DIRECTIONS and this will work for you. 

the registry path is for Vista 64bit but this works for all platforms. 


NOTE-WHEN YOU DISABLE SELF DEFENSE YOU HAVE TO EIT OUT OF KASPERSKY. MAKE SURE IT IS NOT RUNNING AT ALL.

THE PEOPLE WHO THINK IT DOESNT WORK DONT DO IT RIGHT ILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVE IT TO YOU. 
BUT SEE FOR YOUR SELF.
