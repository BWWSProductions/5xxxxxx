Owwww big install!!!"
,caixa,2009-07-30T04:00Z,"If you've had problems running the patches included with this torrent then help may be at hand! I was trying to install on 10.6 and the patchers weren't working. I found a fix for them from someone who was having the same problem on 10.5.7 and it worked for me too!! So I patched all the patches and uploaded them to a new torrent you will find at:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5031320

Good luck and all the best

,L3ntil,2009-07-30T06:48Z,I have serial where can i post it ?
,tatatoto1,2009-07-30T07:10Z,"You can post the serial right here. The serials aren't verified online so they can't get blacklisted per se; rather they would have to be disabled in the next update for the software, at which point another serial would simply have to be used. If you still don't want to post it out in the open you could always save it to a text file upload it right here or somewhere else. I'm sure those PPC users who can't use the patched would appreciate a serial. "
,L3ntil,2009-07-30T07:17Z,"Just that i got into the shits for posting a serial in the comments on another torrent site thats why i asked
Here it is enjoy 

SN  -   E-330-DOX-030-NJB-265-AKZ-414-BVZ-M2E-41HX"
,tatatoto1,2009-07-30T07:25Z,"Oh I see. Understandable. Many thanks! I used the patches, but like I said, there are people that cannot. "
,L3ntil,2009-07-30T08:17Z,The patches can't unlock Main Stage so the serial is better to use
,novman,2009-07-30T15:59Z,"I,d love this but have a 512 connection running on half that - if someone could help me out by posting  me a copy on a dual layer or several dvds I'd be grateful - will cover their costs by paypal, say £30? lemme know - macman@googlepost.co.uk"
,diego018,2009-07-30T18:26Z,"@deshaunz: try rebooting your mac.. maybe the peers that you got dont have the complete file. or in preferences, raise the limit for peers.
i was stuck in 98% during 2 hours.. "
,diego018,2009-07-30T18:26Z,"ohh and i forgot.. if someone has the demo content dvd please upload it, i would like to see the killers using logic. "
,tangucho,2009-07-30T20:15Z,I am just only at 5% but I strongly believe that content disk are necessary since Logic 8 does not have Garageband 09 amps modeling. The instalation manual of Logic 9 places these garageb and and jam packs on the Logic Studio contents disc.... still I will verify it by myself.
,tangucho,2009-07-30T20:43Z,does anybody would be that kind and post the studio content disc. will be paypal rewarded.....
,tatatoto1,2009-07-30T22:16Z,"As far as instruments, Space Designer and the EXS24 suffer without, specifically, the logic studio additional content disk. The warped effects for Space Designer and the Samples for the Xtreme synthesizer instruments for EXS24 are contained on that disk. Otherwise you are getting every new feature in Logic 9, excluding any new sounds (i.e. voices) that may come from the Jam Pack disks. I'm sure all the disks will end up around here soon though. "
,umudo_1,2009-07-30T22:52Z,"Does this have Mainstage 2? Can I use the older sound banks (patches, whatever xD) that i have with L8? "
,tangucho,2009-07-31T00:25Z,"just read the instalation instruction and you will figure out that critical plug-ins and content like EXS24 are on the content disk. this is what make garageband 09 projects able to be opened with LS 9. Otherwise Logic 8 will say that modules ""pedals"" and ""ampsim2"" are not available.

please post the content disks"
,tangucho,2009-07-31T04:01Z,deshaunz. believe it or not the guitar amp modelin from garageband 09 is far superior to those on logic 8. that is one of the best features of logic 9...it include the garageband 09 amps modeling plugins!
,tatatoto1,2009-07-31T04:35Z,"Very true tangucho, especially if you don't already own guitar rig. Either way, the next thing that should definitely be posted is the logic studio additional content disk, so all of the instruments have all of their usable features. But I'm sure that we'll see everything here soon because I've seen complete Final Cut 3 packages already. "
,pirates_life,2009-07-31T07:53Z,looking forward to the extra content discs... will wait until then :)
,revolvit22,2009-07-31T18:19Z,"if there was a such thing as 10.7 maybe someone could let you know. 10.6 is still only beta so i'm not sure where you're coming up with 10.7, unless of course you mean 10.5.7.. then yes, it does work."
,L3ntil,2009-07-31T21:11Z,"This works perfectly on 10.6 latest build

Im running 10.6 and it's 10000's of times better than 10.5.7

,tatatoto1,2009-08-01T04:53Z,"Apparently this torrent contains all the install disks. I, however, do not have a demonoid account, and the site does not seem to be letting me view/download recent torrents.

,tatatoto1,2009-08-01T16:15Z,Yes the demonoid one should have all of the them. 
,ledzeppelin12344,2009-08-01T17:29Z,"i can confirm that this works when upgrading from logic studio 8 with jampacks installed.

uncheck the box that is the large install, so it doesn't ask you for the additional disks. once installed for me, all of my instruments, efx, etc. were still there just fine.

happy recording, and thanks a million for sharing this!"

which torrent site are you getting it off of? The only one I've been able to find is demonoid, and I can't even download that one because I don't have an account. Either way, it's great to hear that it's being seeded well."

,L3ntil,2009-08-01T23:02Z,here ya go    http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/78999077/Logic+Studio+9?tab=summary
,tatatoto1,2009-08-01T23:21Z,Hey L3ntil that looks like a logic 8 torrent. I notice the demo content disk but still. Or are they just running on the premise that all the audio and jam pack content disks are exactly the same as 8? I'm almost entirely sure that there are minor added elements to those disks as well. 
,tatatoto1,2009-08-01T23:37Z,"Oh wait, 8 had a demo disk too, so it's definitely an 8 torrent. "
,L3ntil,2009-08-01T23:44Z,"Dammm, shit sorry it is logic 8 sorry my bad

As soon as i complete my download i will upload it here "
,L3ntil,2009-08-01T23:45Z,Only problem is i can only upload at 120k  will take yonks
,tatatoto1,2009-08-02T00:20Z,it's cool. You could always just copy the tracker file and give that to people. I know I wouldn't be able to upload any faster than you so it doesn't matter to me. There may be people that can upload faster hanging around though. 
,L3ntil,2009-08-02T00:37Z,Id get banned from the site im on if i did that.
,L3ntil,2009-08-02T00:39Z,tatatoto1  can you private message me on here ? orsend em an email @ rdporcaro at gmail dot com
,tatatoto1,2009-08-02T00:44Z,Understandable. I will do that.

,donshanto,2009-08-02T02:01Z,"Hey I runned the logicstudio.cdr on my mac and follow the install instructions..

but I get error like ""put the cd audio content 1"".. how do I fix this?"
,tatatoto1,2009-08-02T02:36Z,"hey donshanto, this is not the full install, just the programs, so you have to uncheck everything that isn't on the first disk. You will still be able to use all the new feature minus a few things with EXS24 and Space Designer, but they are minor. The best way to know that you are only installing what's on the first disk is to uncheck things until the installer says that does not give you that message that you will need another disk during the install. If you get no message, you are good. Once the full torrent can be put up and/or you decide to buy it, you won't have to do that."
,tangucho,2009-08-02T04:09Z,...unfortunately for guitar players all the content disks are a must..... WE wanT thE Amp and pedals plugins!!!
,tangucho,2009-08-02T05:02Z,I would be more than happy to do so.... and even post it here after that....unfortunately i dont have a demonoid account to do so.  :( that sucks...
,tatatoto1,2009-08-02T05:23Z,"tangucho, I was able to use the pedalboard plugin and all of the amps just fine with only this disk. The only thing you should be missing out on are the preset guitar sounds, as far as guitars go.  "
,tatatoto1,2009-08-02T05:27Z,"Also do you have Guitar Rig 3? If you do, I would say you shouldn't worry too much about this set of plugins anyway. They have a nice character to them, and I'm sure they will have their uses, but Guitar Rig 3 wins as far as sound, IMO. "
,tmrbass,2009-08-02T09:42Z,"hey, i just spent 2 days (no surprise) downloading this torrent, and im not criticizing but when i try to enter the serial it says its invalid. Am i doing some thing wrong?  "

This Torrent DOES work if you update!!!
When Apple detect a serial posted online the pull it so when you update your serial becomes invalid
HOWEVER

This crack removes the need for a serial and replaces your licence type with a Volume Licence which doesn't use a serial so you can update to 9.0.1 or whatever update you want. I have used this and it works in everything (Even Mainstage)

,msuarez20,2010-01-20T03:03Z,"Alright everyone hear me out, haha.. I'm pretty confused about what has been happening. I'm going to try to tell what my problem is and if anyone can help me please please do.


1. I downloaded this along with the jam packs.
2. I was downloading the audio content disks also but never finished them.

At my school the music majors are required to get logic studio so I asked a friend for his disks and figured i would not even need to use the jam pack download and the audio content disk and extra downloads.
Before I had got a hold of the disks I tried to start this torrent download with just the Jam packs. I entered this key 

""E-330-DOX-030-NJB-265-AKZ-414-BVZ-M2E-41HX""

and was about to start the download but decided to wait for the audio packs to finish. 

I later started the installer again but used my friends disks instead for the audio and jam packs and extra content, But instead of using the real Logic install disk I used this installer because I did not know If I needed to use this one or not or that key.


When I started the installer the second time it said that the key had already been used. I kept doing it again and again and all of a sudden it worked and started downloading and only asked me to insert the audio content disks. The download finished and I could open, ""Mainstage"", ""Logic"", and everything. I used it that night and even opened it up in the morning. I just tried to open it up and it said that the serial has already been used on my network. 


I'm really confused and need to know how I can fix it. My questions???


1. Do I even need this torrent or any of the downloads if I have all the logic disks, ""Installer, jam packs, audio content, extra content, and demo content because I have the real box of Logic Studio 9.


2. Do I still need to use the patches because I did not and if so what folder do I put each one in.

3.Should I just uninstall everything and can I just use the real installer disk with a different key?

4. If I were to uninstall and do everything again is there a tutorial to show how to make sure I get rid of all the Logic studio 9 files because I read it does not come with a uninstaller.


Please help me if you can. I would appreciate it"
,whiz_666,2010-01-20T08:12Z,"I think that you the installer is just an image file of the original dvd, so you should be able to use that with another serial. But if you want to patch it you probably need to make the image-file yourself (or copy the installer package from the dvd) and then proceed as described. 'Could be wrong though."
,whiz_666,2010-01-20T08:20Z,"After reading your post again I realized that my answer may be confusing:

*You could use either a serial or the No-serial-patch to install it without a license

*You should be able to use your friends dvds to install with the serial provided by tangucho

,livetorrents,2010-02-02T20:57Z,"How to install, and update to 9.1:

1. Install Logic and all the content you have available.
Use this serial:
E-330-DOX-030-NJB-265-AKZ-414-BVZ-M2E-41HX

2. Update everything EXCEPT - Logic 2.1 and Mainstage 2.0.1.
Use this serial when starting Logic:
E-342-PXV-169-TMH-378-IKJ-435-KXZ-FFS-41PX

3. Update the rest. 

Worked for me! For some reason, I after updating to 9.1 I also have 9.0.2 as an own program?? Don´t know why. The same with EVERY else of the the programs in the Logic pack, like Mainstage, node etc.

Well, at least it works. A lot of bugs has been corrected. I guess I will settle with the 9.1. I don't care for updating if it means more trouble.


Hope this helps!"
,livetorrents,2010-02-02T21:03Z,"I might stay corrected with the post above...

I think with the 9.1 update, EVERYTHING gets updated. So maybe you can update everything at once. 

I think it is so that Logic keeps the ""old"" 9.0.2"" programs just to be safe. I think all of the programs having ""9.0.2"" or ""2.0.1"", like MainStage can be deleted. 

I think everything else is updated to 9.1. So I guess I'll put all my ""extra"" programs in a temp-folder, and delete them in a month or so, if they're not needed."
,livetorrents,2010-02-03T14:19Z,"I can see there is some typos from my posts above.

I'm talking about waiting with the updating of Logic 9.1 and Mainstage 2.1.

Run these afterwards. And I think you can delete every extra instance of the program, like ""Mainstage 2.0.1"" and ""Logic 9.0.1"" if they are there.. Don't see any use of them."

You're my hero of the day! After updating to 9.1 I was able to enjoy Logic Studio again by just typing the 2nd serial which you included in your first post. I am not sure what you mean by all that 'wait and then continue' stuff, but with me it just went like a breeze. And indeed I figured that there were some redundant 9.0.2 files, for ""just in case"" I guess, that I immediately got rid of.

Sorry Apple, I would love to spend another 200 Euro on the official upgrade from version 8, which I just bought before you came up with version 9. But I am still a little pissed off with the fact that I then would have to spend 650 euros in total in such a short time using this product just rarely and just a few features of it - if you do not mind it feels a bit more fair to myself that I continue to enjoy the newest version a little bit longer. Thanks."
,PI22,2010-02-19T00:02Z,"O, and to alexBZ and all others that have problems with prompts for another disk... this is of course NOT the full package, but just the first disk.

I have been fiddleling by installing it on top on 
Logic Studio 8, but that kinda sucks big ones.
You need the full monty, also if you want to get your hands on all the advertised instruments and effects. So even if you finish this download, you are left as a leeched hungry dog with a lump of steak just out of reach."

,PI22,2010-02-25T00:29Z,"@Davonavon: I do not know (nor care) what kind of files there are in the other torrents, but there are 2 possibilities:
1) They are image files like .cdr - great, put them all into one folder and mount them all. That means they should all appear as a 'drive' in the left column. Start the first one and the rest will be detected automatically during the installation process. Easy peasy! And you save yourself a lot of dosh, because these DL disk are pretty expensive.
2) You have folder with various files like .pkg or something. I suppose you could burn them on disks and then install from there. The expensive, especially if they appear not working! Just make ('burn') images from them, and follow the instructions at 1).
> That's it. If you have any further questions, god luck have a nice day - you are then probably better off buying the full package.

First install logic using this serial:

Once logic is installed use the volume license crack: http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5119114/Apple_Pro_Apps_Volume_Licencing_Crack_(Cracks_Logic_9.0.2_Inc._M.5119114.TPB.torrent

then use software update to update to 9.1 and all other components are fine too. You will see duplicate files in the apps folder, just delete the ones with the version number after them.

finally, launch logic and use this serial number to get 9.1 working: E-342-PXV-169-TMH-378-IKJ-435-KXZ-FFS-41PX

I deleted the new ones, renamed the old ones, downloaded the Apple 9.1 and 2.1 updates, and put everything back like it was.

Is there any way to hide updates in the update manager? Like in windows?

I will say this: Update to 9.1, then don't bother any more. IF you should experience problems or bugs, try updating more, but most people, using just a regular midi-keyboard, or some 3rd party soundcard, will most likely not experience any problems.

3. What do I do with the .cdr file?

Thank you so much!"
,dcbear,2011-01-17T10:37Z,"Instructions (Really Easy) ------

1. Download it

2. Install it. It'll ask you to have some discs ready but just ignore it, and at the end if it asks you for the discs just click cancel. It'll say install failed but it will have installed correctly! After this do not open Logic yet.

3. Download the torrent provided by hezatuz ( http://www.mac-torrents.com/torrents.php?mode=details&id=ecf0f896f88498a944a677f7c131723b7472e9b6 )

4. Extract the 2 rar files by clicking one of them and using something like Zipeg for extraction.

5. Install the .dmg file you just extracted.

6. After that, still don't open Logic. You'll notice two other files in that folder you extracted. Select them then press CMD + C. Go to your hard drive, then Library/Application Support/ProApps.

7. You'll notice in this folder there will be two files named the same. What you need to do is replace them two files to remove the licensing. Press CMD + V to paste the two original files from the extracted rar into the ProApps folder.

8. Done :)"

The answer is here :http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5635830/Logic_Studio_9.1.1_Pro_Apps_Crack.
Just do what is say,s it says its for the 9.1.1 update, but alas, it is simply new Logic Studio System ID, and new ProAppsSystemID, and is good for 9.0.4. I regretably moved to lion when it first hit the Bay. But logic still worked fine. I have had the 9.1.5 update for a while and installed it today and do not need new ID. the new ID in the above mentioned torrent is a volume license and is good for the 9.1.5 install. So get it while its still there."

,CzajN,2011-10-18T14:41Z,"Btw.. You know the box you should not tick, it was about 40 gb big .. It is possible to recover those things now that I've installed everything?"
,theMeerkat,2011-10-19T00:04Z,"CzjAN,
Not sure what you mean. ""The box you should not tick""? Are you talking about not selecting to install some package or something at the install? "
,CzajN,2011-10-19T14:52Z,"yeah, i lost some files during the installation to be able to complete it.. is it possible to get those back?"
,baddabingbaddajoey,2011-10-24T05:40Z,Is there a working serial?!?! The posted one doesn't work!
,grrttsll,2011-10-24T19:01Z,"I used the serial in the description and the installer worked fine, except now when I try to open Logic the icon appears on my dock then an error says that Logic quit unexpectedly. I'm on Lion.

Any help?"
,jc4jv,2011-10-31T11:15Z,"For lion users with ""Quit Unexpectedly"" issues: you need to update.
But then it will reject this serial, so does anyone know a serial that works with logic 9.1.5?"
,jc4jv,2011-10-31T11:16Z,"Sorry, previous post says:
E-350-OYX-169-EGD-300-TRZ-435-TGX-FHA-41HX"
,baddabingbaddajoey,2011-11-01T20:25Z,"I'm on Lion, Logic works, but MainStage doesn't work for me. Does anyone else have this problem?"

,t0m3o,2012-01-29T06:34Z,"I just finished downloading this, and havent done anything yet, but is it worth using if i have not downloaded the content DVDs? Theyre 50gig and the download is really slow, so I'm feeling hesitant to do it. Can i use my own .vst files and synths and intruments as a substitute for theirs? also, if anyone could post any good downloads for synths and instruments I would be a very happy man. Thanks"
,yaboi22,2012-03-05T18:22Z,How do you skip the part where is asks for disc one? The only option is to click cancel I've tried hitting cancel and of course it doesn't install it. How can I avoid it and complete the download. PLEASE HELP!
,beedoola,2012-03-13T21:41Z,"I have the same problem as yaboi22.

What am I doing wrong??!"
,beedoola,2012-03-13T22:30Z,"yaboi22 - 

You have to ""uncheck"" the ""53GB"" portion of the install to skip the prompt for the additional disks."
