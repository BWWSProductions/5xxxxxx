***BEGIN UPDATE***

OK folks, I don't think we need to worry about the installer and app patches anymore. Thanks to TPB user L3ntil we have a working serial and here it is:

E-330-DOX-030-NJB-265-AKZ-414-BVZ-M2E-41HX

I've tested it on 10.6 and no probs!! If you still want to use the patches and the ones here don't work for you go to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5031320

All the instruments are here and Logic 8 content and previous Jam packs all work fine with this, but hopefully someone will upload the new content soon anyway!

***END UPDATE***


Good luck with this and all the best,

abraÃ§os, caixa.
