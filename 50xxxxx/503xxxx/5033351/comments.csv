sounds good though.  It has the album art for all except ""All You Will Never Know"""

,capnpat,2010-02-10T18:31Z,"wow!!!!   thx rustyjerk fo sho!!!
I had no idea she had done so much stuff...I, like about everyone else on the planet, picked up her first CD Let Go but then didn't continue listening to her...not sure why cuz i like the stuff.

Anyway, u should prob let ppl know that the different discs are at varying bitrates from 128 (not really crazy about that) up to 320.
Several are at 192 which is decent."
