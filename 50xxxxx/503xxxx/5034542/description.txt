##### Notes #####

This is an eBook version of Learn C on the Mac, it is fully OCR'ed (meaning all of the text can be copied and searched) and the pages have been properly numbered to match those of the print edition (I had to add in a few blank pages that seem to have been removed from the eBook versions to make the numbers work out but I assure you no pages of real information was removed).

Learn C is part of the Learn Series for Mac, published by Apress, I have also uploaded various other books of that series, feel free to check them out in my uploads.

This book is the first of the Learn series, making it appropriate for anyone who wants to begin programming or revise C to then move on to more advanced language like Objective-C and Cocoa, used to program applications for Mac OS X and the iPhone.

Please seed this as long as possible after downloading as my Internet connection is very slow and I will not be able to seed at very fast speeds.
