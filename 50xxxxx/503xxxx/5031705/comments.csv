The download is completed for some time but when I tried to move it to my external disc, it doesn't allow me to move the folder it says it is impossible to move the folder... I tried to delete it but it doesn't let me also it says the name is too long or invalid... can someone give me a clue about what could be happennig? 
Note: I deleted the torrent from bit torrent first, just in case someone could be downloading from me and that way it would say that the file is being used and cannot be downloaded. Thanks in advance for any help..."
