A complete introduction for beginners to Sun's powerful JavaFX scripting 
language 

JavaFX is a scripting language which provides built-in properties for 
manipulating objects within a 2D coordinate system. JavaFX provides the tools to fill and pen stroke colors, and create special effects, shapes and lines. It 
also manipulates images and play videos and sound and defines animations 
that affect objects over time. This complete introduction for any level 
doesn't bury you with details. It starts quickly with an introduction to 
the power of JavaFX key features--scene node graphs, nodes as 
components, the coordinate system, layout options, colors and gradients, 
custom classes with inheritance, animation, binding, and event handlers. 
It then shows step-by-step how these features could be used in a real 
JavaFX application and will help an application look professionally 
designed. Commissioned by JavaFX product team and reviewed by renowned 
Java author, Brian Goetz, this guide is intended as the first and most 
accessible book for people new to JavaFX.
