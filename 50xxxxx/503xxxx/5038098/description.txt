What Better For An Australian, Well I Had To Make It!

What i have done here is removed the video away from the Audio AC3 5.1 Track
Then Converted the track to MP3 and then split and named the songs
A Must For Any AC-DC Fan If You Don't Have It. Made a Audio disc via Nero of a few songs for the car and sounded great
Please SEED For Others To Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
