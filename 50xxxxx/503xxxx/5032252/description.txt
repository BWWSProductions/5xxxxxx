Albums in this torrent:
Eldorado, Time (remastered), The very best of (1990), Definitive collection (1999), Live at the BBC 1973-76, Flashback (Remastered 3CD Box set), Zoom, The Essential Electric Light Orchestra, A new worl record (remastered)

IÂ´ve previously uploaded a torrent with mostly studio albums in it (only two Greatest hits). So, why this torrent? 
This one has some of the studio albums that were not included in my first torrent. However, here are most different compilations. 
The full torrent is very large, so remember that you donÂ´t have to download the full torrent. You can choose album or individual tracks when you open the torrent before you click OK. In this way you can customize the download to fit your needs.

BTW, with so many compilations available; what is a complete discography? For any artist? 

All tracks in this torrent have been checked with audiochecker. Result, all tracks are CDDA except, The very best of (CD2) track 6 Secret Messages. (I believe audiochecker is wrong). 
Still, the track is available also on Flashback (CD3) track 4 and Defenitive Collection track 19, no problems with audiochecker. ItÂ´s of course also on the album Secret messages (track 1) in my first torrent.

Defenitive collection only CD1. According to Wiki there should be a disc 2 as well. Does anyone have additional info on this?
 

Electric Light Orchestra, commonly abbreviated ELO, were a symphonic rock group from Birmingham, England, who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern pop songs with heavily classical overtones,
but falling under a light rock category. However, the band's direction for most of their existence was set by Lynne who, after the band's debut record, wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.
