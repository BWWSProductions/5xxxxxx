,dukheddd,2009-08-01T18:39Z,"You need a flashed Xbox 360 console to play this game. The lastest Ixtreme firmware you need is 1.6.

Open the DVD file which is associated with the ISO file in IMG Burn and burn at a recommended speed of 2.4x

You MUST use quality discs. I recommend Verbatem Dual Layered 8.5GB discs.

Failure to use quality products or programs will cause this not to work correctly.

Also, you can check whether games are already stealth patched or not using a program called ""DVDMulleter""

Search for it using google and download it. This adds extra assurance to you not getting banned from Xbox Live!"

,gorilla00,2009-09-09T23:16Z,"One more thing, you can also use abgx360 to check if it's stealth patched or not, and if not you can make it steathed. "

,FLAMinEK,2011-03-21T20:38Z,as you can see it does verify ok on abgx but there are SSv2/dmi you can manually patch from abgx to make it appear less like a kreon rip (SSv1). Infact wave 3 up c4eva recommends SSv2/Splitvid.
,FLAMinEK,2011-03-22T09:13Z,"How to Manually patch SSv2 files:
Go to abgx360 database, use the blue number on the right hand side of your game to obtain an SS and DMI combination (still must match the XEX of your game).
Load ABGX360, Go to the ""Manually Patch or Extract Files"" tab,
Tick ""Patch even if stealth passes""
Tick the Patch SS, & Patch DMI, then browse for the files you just downloaded.
 Go to the options tab
UN-tick ""Verify if stealth passes""
Click ""LAUNCH""
The files should be patched and will say""patched successfully"" for each one.
FINALLY, load the ABGX360 default settings again, (reselect the game iso if needed)
Misc tab, make sure ""Add if it doesnt exist or isnt valid"" is selected for Splitvid
Options tab, make sure ""Verify if stealth passes"" is checked
UN-tick any boxes still ticked under ""Manually Patch or Extract Files""
(the above should really all be enabled as default settings if they are not already. If you had to change to any of them, hold CTRL then press S to save your settings and choose ""Default""
Click ""LAUNCH""
If the game now shows SSv2, ALL CRC's Match, and you get Verification Successful at the end of the test, AND it says SPLITVID VALID (or added).
YOU NOW HAVE SSv2 and SPLITVID, YOUR GAME MATCHES OUR RETAIL RIP, so you are good to go.
Enjoy your game"
