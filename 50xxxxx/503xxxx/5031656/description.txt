What happened at the end of WAR OF KINGS #4, and what did Darkhawk have to do with it? Only Chris Powell knows the terrible deeds the Fraternity of Raptors will carry out to protect their so-called "Great Purpose", but who will believe or trust the paranoid warnings of a lone young Earthman? The entire universe thinks he's committed an appalling crime-and now Darkhawk is cosmic enemy #1!
