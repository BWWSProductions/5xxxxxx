One of the most celebrated bio-pics made by the Soviet Union which dramatizes the life of one of Russia's great sons, Glinka.

Nowadays it is most famous for the fact that Sviatoslav Richter makes a cameo appearance as the piano virtuoso Franz Liszt. The irony is splendid. The greatest pianist of the 20th century playing the greatest pianist of the 19th century.

This 1952 film is an all-Russian remake of the 1946 Glinka movie, also Russian, of the life of Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka, called Kompozitor Glinka (Russian: ÐšÐ¾Ð¼Ð¿Ð¾Ð·Ð¸Ñ‚Ð¾Ñ€ Ð“Ð»Ð¸Ð½ÐºÐ°, "Glinka The Composer"). The title role was played by Boris Smirnov.
