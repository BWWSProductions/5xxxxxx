Pinhead Gunpowder is an East Bay, California punk rock band consisting of Aaron Cometbus (drums, lyrics), Bill Schneider (bass), Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Jason White (guitar, vocals). Mike Kirsch (guitar, vocals) was part of the original band formed in 1990, but left the band citing personal differences with Green Day (the band for which Billie Joe Armstrong is most famous) and their major label debut in 1994 with Dookie.[1][citation needed] The band's name comes from a brand of "high octane" green tea served at the Arcata co-op and discovered serendipitously by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many dumpster diving adventures.
