Should Religious Education be reinstated as a regular subject in Berlin schools? In the German capital, all children currently have to take Ethics as a subject, but not necessarily Religion. The Catholic and Lutheran Churches decided that wasn't good enough, and launched a giant petition, collecting enough signatures to force a public referendum on the matter. Their aim: all children between 7th and 10th grade should be given the choice whether they want to study Ethics or Religious Education. The question at the heart of the matter is: who is responsible for passing on the Christian values, entrenched in German culture, to today's generations? The state or the church?
