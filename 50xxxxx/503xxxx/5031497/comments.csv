,preblooch,2009-08-19T19:50Z,"Well, it's good quality, but i don't like the new dubbing. Vegeta's over 9000 scene just isn't the same anymore. Oh, and wtf did they do to the music?"
,stanleyman,2009-08-21T03:14Z,thx dude
,Teddikilla,2009-10-10T04:28Z,"So, do u have a choice to which audio u use, like jappa or english?
Or is just random episodes english and some are in japanese?
thx alot"
,kendojosh,2009-11-06T11:35Z,"I wondered the same about the music - turns out the files contain -three- separate audio tracks

- Original Japanes
- English with Original Japanese music (default)
- English with the far better Bruce Falconer (Funimation) Music

So you need to figure out how to switch the audio stream in whatever player your using.
I'm using Zoom Player and it's just a matter of right-click -> stream selection -> select English [Funimation]"
,kendojosh,2009-11-06T11:38Z,"and btw how fricken awesome is it that such great picture and audio quality, together with -three- audio tracks can be packaged into such small files. My hat's off to whoever sorted us out with this torrent.
Cheers mate."

,mike81693,2010-02-07T03:54Z,"hey can anyone help me? i have gom player and i cant figure out how to switch audio streams, so its not playing any audio at all"
,ThePalindorme,2010-02-23T08:48Z,"First of all, i would like to thank the uploader with the deepest part of my heart, to give me the entire Dragon ball z anime in such small files, having 3 audio streams. I looked up other torrents, they had 58 gb, 99gb sizes. Woah, it would take my slow net 3 days to download just one episode from those. This torrent solves everything.
I dont know how you did it, whether you ripped it with some godly technique, or just directly uploaded Funimations remastered release of all seasons, but nevertheless, its outstanding.
To people who are skeptical about the small size, dont be. One word about the quality - ' greater than axxo'. Three words actually.
Its unbelievable, each episode just 50mb, having 3 audio streams, and such awesome quality. Its ever better than some other torrent, which has 280 mb size of each episode. How can someone do that?!?!?!
This torrent should seeded till eternity. 
I cant thank you enough."
,ThePalindorme,2010-02-23T08:55Z,"Now about the torrent:-
It has 3 audio streams
1. Funimation dub - japanese music (default)
2. Funimation dub - funimation music.
3. Japanese dub - Japanese music.
Of all the three, the 2nd audio stream is the best,  which was all i needed, others are bad, around 96kbps only.
I use vlc, its the best player, free, downloaded it through google. Play the file,
right click on the player window -> audio -> audio tracks-> choose.
Enjoy the variety. I dont know how to make the 2nd stream as default, or change audio streams in other players, but why use other players if you have vlc?!?!?!"
,ThePalindorme,2010-02-23T09:05Z,"I remember seeing the english dub around  5 to 6 years ago. Its not the same dub in this torrent.
I did some research (i.e. i looked up wikipedia)
What i got was this:-
Originally, when english dubbing was started in the 1990s, funimation had hired ocean dub studios to do the dubbing. And that dub was aired in north america and in my country previously, but ocean studios only dubbed around the first 50 episodes, and stopped around the start of the ginyu saga. After which the airing was cancelled due to low ratings.
After few years, the re airing began from where it was left off initially, and this time funimation dubbed the remaining series itself, therefore we had a whole new voice cast and hence different voices. In August 2004, Geneon Entertainment lost its licensing rights to the old Ocean dubbed episodes of Dragon Ball Z, allowing Funimation to re-dub the first 67 episodes, restore the removed content and replace the old voice cast with their in-house one. These re-dubbed episodes aired in the United States on Cartoon Network during the summer of 2005.
This re dubbed part is what we get in this torrent.
I thought the uploader had dubbed the series using his own voice....lol.
All episodes have the funimation dub and music.
So you dont need to go anywhere else, start downloading and seeding this torrent.
Once again my heartiest thanks."
,GojitaJin4,2010-02-23T09:18Z,"Thank you so much!!!!! This torrent is flawless, and the video and audio quality is MIND BLOWING!!!  This Torrent has 3 DIFFERENT AUDIO'S, I THINK THE SECOND ONE IS THE AUDIO THAT BRUCE FAULCONER MADE (WITH THE MUSIC AND THAT GUY THAT TALKS IN THE BEGINNING AND END, FROM THE LATEST AMERICAN VERSION)

,weaping_reaper,2010-03-15T18:00Z,"Hey.. Can I burn these to dvd? like, 2 seasons at a time?"
,ThePalindorme,2010-03-21T16:48Z,"Using mkv files will give lots of problems.
IF you just want to watch the series, its fine
but if you want to make videos, mkv files do not work in any video editor, it pissed me off a lot.
It also cannot be converted properly as it has 3 different audio streams
Suggestion: if you want to make videos, then use fraps software to record the action part in an avi file. and then use that file. Lengthy but works.

But still great quality video"
,ThePalindorme,2010-03-22T13:04Z,"3 audio streams is pointless, all it did was increase the size of the files, and hindered its conversion to any other format"
,ThePalindorme,2010-03-22T21:10Z,"Okay, i know my previous comments have been shitty but this is last and detailed on the problems using mkv and how to overcome them.

Problems -
1. Any basic video converter will not work mainly because of the 3 audio streams. This ruins almost any chance of writing on a dvd or using it in a video editing software like sony vegas............get the idea.

2. At some places, very few places audio is out of synch.(this cant be overcome, ignore this because of the great quality video)

To overcome this:
Download a software known as ultra mkv converter from the pirate bay itself it works.
Use it to convert these mkv files to any format.
Conversion is awesome and excellent. Video quality is retained and time taken is really less.
The problem is with the audio streams,
This may be confusing, youll get it when you use the software
double click on the video in the source video file window, and choose the single audio stream you want. now you can proceed with ease
You may need codecs........so get klite codec pack....google it, its completely free. It will help in easy playback of many video formats and help speed the conversion.




Outstanding torrent seed till eternity......."
,kiasta,2010-03-28T21:00Z,"@ ThePalindorme:

So learn how to use decent video editing software and stop using shitty ones that do all the work for you. Why do you have to complain so much, it's a whole series for FREE. Just stfu and deal with it. I personally have no qulms using .mkv, I prefer it.

All you have to do really is extract the video and extract whatever audio you wish and the subs (if any) than use your shitty video editing software for 3 year olds and voila."

,primalclaws1974,2010-04-01T00:55Z,"wish i had read some of the comments before spending a week downloading this shit. I have tried to convert this fucking bullshit with programs and it's impossible to change them over to put on regular dvd. 
Someone suggested fraps, but wow that would take some time...but I guess better than deleting many gigs of shows. MKV is the most stupid format anyone could upload to!!!!"
,primalclaws1974,2010-04-01T01:29Z,Hey tried the fraps suggestion. That doesnt even work. Forget this torrent!
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-04T08:15Z,"There you go........problems with .mkv will rise like hell......

Dude fraps should work.
Just the way you use it to record games.
Run fraps.
Then play the video file in vlc, and do the same you do to record video games.

And you can now download ultra video converter or ultra mkv converter from THIS site .
Both will convert .mkv to avi. Use the converted avi file to write onto a dvd.

Remeber to select the audio stream you wish to have in the avi file, this is really important. otherwise its back to square one.


AVS video converter, ultra mkv converter, ultra video converter ......are the ONLY 3 video converters i have found that allow you to choose the audio stream you want. That was the only major problem with this torrent.

I used original XILISOFT .........30$, completely useless. It will be a cold day in hell before i buy some original digital data."
,grtscott,2010-04-09T04:00Z,"@ThePalindorme

Fraps, lol.  This is The Pirate Fuckin Bay, here's a clue.  Search on this site for some video editing software that supports .mkv files.  Try searching for Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere, Final Cut, whatever.  If you have a decent computer it might be quicker to render a video than watching the whole thing using Fraps.  Anyways, you can't post your edited DBZ vids anywhere because of copyright laws."
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-09T16:59Z,"to all of you, my problem is solved so just shut it.......
And if you all havent realized it yet.
Problem is not the mkv format, it is the 3 audio streams. My original xilisoft hd video converter, it converted all other mkv files i had used before.
But not these ones, the resultant .avi file had some garbled audio, not even a japanese-english combination, and didnt even play right i.e the file was completely useless. 
In my desperation to write these files in dvd format, i tried using fraps, it was a decent effort, but it was really long.
"
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-09T16:59Z," @Mr.grtscott.....instead of laughing out loud, it would have been better if you tried to use the .mkv file in adobe priemere pro, fuck the other video editing softwares, it did not even accept the files. None of them did, not even sony vegas 9."
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-09T17:01Z,"I just wanted to help in return for the free dbz episodes, so i tried to explain how to convert the .mkv files 'properly', when i learned how to do it myself, as none of you software designers out there could.
If you cant help, dont. But dont you dare fucking make fun of others who want to help."
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-09T17:02Z,"My computer is vista ultimate dual core with 4 gb ram, so all of you out there, thinking your very smart just cause you can 'use' the stolen softwares from this site, heres a fact, you dont need an MIT degree to use them. I certainly didnt."

2. this torrent comes with the japanese audio/ japanese voice sound file. the japanese audio english voice sound file. and the english audio funimation music file. so all in all 3 audio soundtracks for u to choose from while playing, just use vlc to play these and to choose between soundtracks just click the audio tab and audio track, ez. also all english voices will be in remastered format whether or not the music is the japanese or funimation versions.

the best actually for dbz.
-now guys who want to convert this to dvd ,its not easy with regularly used converts coz they dont have the option to select audio tracks.
so i suggest u seperate the two other tracks from funimation dub by using 'mkvmerge' software.
its free. load the file into it and it will show the components as 3 audio tracks and one video. unselect two other audio and now 'merge'. the file is ready in 5 sec. 
now convert using whatever software u like.

that is what i used to do for  small series like samurai champloo. but since this is 300eps it wiill take an hour to seperate the tracks.
so better watch in ur computer using vlc"
