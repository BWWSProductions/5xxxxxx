For more than nine years, Amadan has cut its teeth on the clubs, bars, stages, and highways of the Pacific Northwest. In the blue-collar tradition of other regional celtic- and folk-inspired rock acts, Amadan spent five years filling a heavy ~100-gig-per-year schedule with music and cultural festival appearances, college campus events, and the obvious staple: three- to four-hour, high-energy house gigs in various pubs throughout Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Amadan swiftly developed a reputation for raucous, energetic, beer-swilling, punk-inspired shows. Filling those time slots with Gaelic traditionals, American folk tunes, and punk rock covers gave the Amadan players the sustainable energy and cohesive trad and rock chops to churn out a number of developed original songs.

Amadanâ€™s second full-length record, 2004â€™s â€œHell-Bent 4 Victory!,â€ represented a culmination of those strengths and efforts and an earmark from which the musicians could grow. Amadan filled the next three years honing performance at an increasing number of festival and rock performances on bills with bands ranging from the Clumsy Lovers to The Supersuckers and Eek-A-Mouse to Pepper. During the same period, members Eric Tonsfeldt and Kevin Pardew wrote, arranged, and, ultimately, co-produced the record that became 2007â€™s â€œPacifica.â€

Seeking to break the molds of traditional music, punk rock, and live performance with their intricate and fast-paced three-hour rock shows and searing musicianship, their third full-length album betrays a sound that is both post-punk and post-celtic in composition, feel, and influence and post-barroom in energy level and maturity. This is world music from the picket lines and the surface streets, and rock and roll from lifeâ€™s daily struggles and rewards. This is music for the revolution. This is Amadan.
