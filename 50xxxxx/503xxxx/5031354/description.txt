The Band plays one of their final live shows in front of the entire country on Saturday Night Live.  Less than a month later they will play their "Last Waltz" at Winterland. The order of songs on "The Band" website shows "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" as the last song in the set. I would rate the quality of this video as an A considering its age. I do not know the genealogy as it came to me on a dvd coupled with the Woodstock 94' show. I would have to guess that the lineage is: TV/VHS/DVD/ (The Band website shows this as: TV/EX/20)then I used a stand alone Sony DVD Player and extracted the video with Powerdirector > Mpeg 2 > then to you. Enjoy!
