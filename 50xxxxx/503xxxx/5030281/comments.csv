,buddog05,2009-08-06T01:01Z,"The Insanity Dvd's have a newer Copy Right Protection on it, Ive tried 6 different rippers including: HandBrake, CloneDVD2, DVDRipper, Xilisoft, and so on,
I also have used DVD 43 along side with it, as well as tried AnyDVD separate from DVD43

All it does is stop after a little bit and fails when Im trying to rip each dvd, If anyone could help me figure out how to rip it then I can possibly get it posted as well.
Thanks"
,chrisjust98,2009-08-09T11:03Z,Are you using the newest version of anydvd? And are you going to put the whole iso file or just the avi. It would be awesome if you could do iso's and put them in one folder so we don't have to download individual files. Not complaining about the others since they're free but it's a little more convenient.
