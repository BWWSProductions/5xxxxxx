This is amazing!!!

I never thought I'd find this movie anywhere but here it is.

I have an extremely slow connection but once it's done I'm gonna seed it forever!!!

Thanks,
Numit"
,Numit,2009-07-31T20:01Z,"Hi,
Looks like no one is seeding. I can't download this.
You have a dvd don't you?
Cheers!!!"

,satya123,2009-12-30T13:38Z,hey friend pliz continue to seed. not all the time. do it when your connection is free... will wait thanks..
,linglei,2010-01-28T06:19Z,"v6mac, thnk u for this upload. Finally, i've got to see this movie. Thnks or other uploads too. Once download is over i'll seed it forever. plz upload other old celluloid movies like Lamja Parsuram, Olangthagi wangmadasu etc.. i'm missing those films..."
,linglei,2010-01-28T06:27Z,oh!! 0 seeds online. pls compress size with Xvid or other codecs. its a priceless upload... expecting lot more... 
,Kkeibul,2011-02-03T17:16Z,Please understand this::::Uploading a torrent is not helping anyone.You need to keep on seeding the torrent.Which means the torrent must be there in the BitTorrent client.Simply saying the torrent must be there in your BitTorrent cleint(like utorrent) and your computer must be on .The reason I m writing this is b'cause I have never come across any manipuri movie torrent which has got one seeder.Always ZERO.
