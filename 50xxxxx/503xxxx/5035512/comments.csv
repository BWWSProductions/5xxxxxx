Have you patched it in a right manner ?"
,fredpc,2009-08-09T23:18Z,"Tauseef
yes i'm sure i have patched it right......it says that it's successful.........but when i open the program it has trial version in the top left corner and it asks for a unlock code

I have used software with cracks...patches and keygens b4 so i am familar with how they work 

I am running this on win 7 if that make a difference"
,fredpc,2009-08-09T23:21Z,I will give it another run just to make sure.....thanx :)........ keep up the gr8 work
,fredpc,2009-08-09T23:40Z,"I dissconnected from the net first ........uninstalled the program and started again........installed program and patched as per your instructions and I got the box that says.....lineZer0 does it again....patch successful.

I opened the program and it still says trial version and it asks for licence code "
