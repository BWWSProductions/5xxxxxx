If you are a perfectionist and like great quality, you will hate it. 

This is all taken from one concert, but the multiple cameras seem to be cell phones and small cameras, not studio quality. 

Sometimes the audio is not in sync, the image is grainy at best. You get a great feel though what it would be like to be at the show, from different angles. 

A bootleg production for sure, and a great editing and compilation. Just dont expect amazing quality. But if your a true die hard fan, you probably wouldnt care any ways.  thanks for the up."

,unclemanti,2009-08-16T17:18Z,This is very interesting. I have never seen anything like this created by a group of fans to later stitch back togethe later. Even though I am not happy with the quality and more of an official authored type of guy I am seeding this!!! Reminds me of the days of pirate concert audio recordings =)
