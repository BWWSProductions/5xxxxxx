I will upload my torrents as I like. 
If you dont like it, get your ass and fart outside..lol"
[T],thegreenfrog,2009-07-31T21:56Z,"No one  likes it, not even you.

how often do you dl clouds of small files? Rarely, because almost no one else does that. The reason is that it takes time, way too much time for what it is worth. Other people are smart enough to see as an annoyance to others and wisely avoid it. 

Plus, many torrents will end up unseeded very quickly because no one wants to seed dozens of itsy bitsy torrents. What that your intention?

ortho is right, what you have done amounts to spam.

One last thing: it would have been much easier for you to upload one single torrent. Why did you burden yourself with that much work?

Your comment reeks of arrogance: you will keep thinking you were right. Life must be hard for you.

i consider your comments bcoz u were decent. ortho is not.. read my comments in the first Animorphs upload.. 

I don't bother or depend about anyone seeding. I will seed it forever :D

If it amounts to spam.. dont download and save yourself from the work..lol"

Whats your Internet Speed? Mine is 128 Kbps.. Its easier for me to give more priority to seed the torrents which has many leechers.

Seriously, If interested download else dont.. 
Life is simple..I dont know why it's hard for me as you say..lol"
,T.S.G,2009-08-03T19:04Z,"Well What greenfrog told is right.....

i could find many torrents left unseeded ... right now ...

it could be easier for any user to download all at once than in bits ... 

i hope you bring up better torrents in future ..

and other thing is that ... it would also consume lot of time for you to create every individual torent .."

don't know if you'll read this but look at my torrents: the larger ones tend to stay a lot longer. Some of my larger files are still active one year after their initial upload.

Granted, It takes longer to dl the whole thing, that is why I usually configure my torrents to allow partial downloads, easily done if you use a decent client.

I understand that every torrent must die but a couple of weeks is a tad short. I wish I could seed forever but I don't have the time or the resources, so my best option is a torrent, not humngous. I have seen tens of GBs many times.
