,jane_says,2012-04-29T06:25Z,"there are two different greatest hits album. this is 2009 and it would appear that it should be titled Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band Greatest hits. They have slightly different songs on them. I was actually looking for the other one, but i'm glad I have this one too. "
