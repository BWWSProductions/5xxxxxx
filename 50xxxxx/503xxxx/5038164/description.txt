AllMusic.com review:
Get Ready, Here Come the '70s features 57 pop/rock hits of the era, by the original artists, encompassing bubblegum, country-rock, singer/songwriter, glam, disco, and soul. While it doesn't contain as many one-hit wonders as Rhino's massive Have a Nice Decade: The 70s Pop Culture Box, or the additional 20 tracks found on Barry Williams Presents: 70s Music Explosion, this three-disc set zooms in on immediately recognizable chart-toppers for anyone who grew up in that decade or is a fan of pop music in general. Unfortunately, these same songs have already been reissued ad nauseam for the past decade. Yes, Shout Factory does the usual admirable job with packaging, liner notes, and remastering, but you have to wonder if yet another box set of this type was really necessary. Probably not.

My turn:
I remember the '70s musically as pretty much a loss. The spirit of the later part of the '60s died and what replaced it was surgery sweet Twinkies. The only exception was in the so called "arena rock" with groups like Journey, REO Speedwagon, Foghat, and others that set new standards for intense rock that still work today. Face it, 90% of the stuff on these 3 CDs came and went while material from Boston still sounds great today. Whatever. To me this collection is a pick and choose. Many of the artists here had only a few hits so you need to find their songs in a collection like this. I kept maybe half the songs for myself. There were are some good memories here. Check the list and see what you like. Hopefully you will be able to fill some missing spots in your own collection.
