Windows), in order to use them.

Note: There's no 5.1 audio here.  I repeat: there's no 5.1 audio here.  Only the

                              THE ALLMUSIC REVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Ned Raggett

Whether the band felt it was simply the time to move on from its most explicit 
industrial-pop fusion days, or whether increased success and concurrently larger 
venues pushed the music into different avenues, Depeche Mode's fifth studio 
album, Black Celebration, saw the group embarking on a path that in many ways 
defined their sound to the present: emotionally extreme lyrics matched with 
amped-up tunes, as much anthemic rock as they are compelling dance, along with 
stark, low-key ballads. The slow, sneaky build of the opening title track, with 
a strange distorted vocal sample providing a curious opening hook, sets the tone 
as David Gahan sings of making it through "another black day" while powerful 
drums and echoing metallic pings carry the song. Black Celebration is actually 
heavier on the ballads throughout, many sung by Martin Gore -- the most per 
album he has yet taken lead on -- with notable dramatic beauties including 
"Sometimes," with its surprise gospel choir start and rough piano sonics, and 
the hyper-nihilistic "World Full of Nothing." The various singles from the album 
remain definite highlights, such as "A Question of Time," a brawling, aggressive 
number with a solid Gahan vocal, and the romantic/physical politics of 
"Stripped," featuring particularly sharp arrangements from Alan Wilder. However, 
with such comparatively lesser-known but equally impressive numbers as the 
quietly intense romance of "Here Is the House" to boast, Black Celebration is 
solid through and through.

                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Black Celebration is the fifth proper studio album by Depeche Mode. Released by 
Mute Records on March 17, 1986, it further cemented the darkening sound that was 
initially hinted towards on their album Construction Time Again.

Black Celebration did not sell as well as the previous album did and none of the 
three singles were big hits. The album is one of their darkest as well, and 
focuses more on the band's bleak side.

Black Celebration is the Depeche Mode album that has the most songs with Martin 
Gore on lead vocals: "A Question of Lust", "Sometimes", "It Doesn't Matter Two", 
"World Full of Nothing" and "Black Day" as a bonus track. The remaining tracks 
are sung by David Gahan.

The track "Fly on the Windscreen" had already been released as the B-side of the 
"It's Called a Heart" single. The band decided to rework the song (adding new 
effects and making it more stereophonic) and released it as the "Final" version 
on this album. It was later performed live, and given a slight hip hop edge 
during the 1993 Devotional Tour. A recorded performance of this version is 
featured in the live video Devotional and a special live single of "In Your 
Room".

In 2007, Black Celebration was re-released with a bonus DVD. It was released as 
a part of the third wave of re-issues (along with Construction Time Again). The 
first CD was remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD 
hybrid. The bonus DVD includes the B-Sides in addition to the singles and B-
Sides for "Shake the Disease" and "It's Called a Heart", two songs that were 
recorded a little bit before the album and were released too early to be put on 
the album. There are also several live versions of some of the songs from Black 
Celebration. The album is released the way it was originally intended and ends 
with "New Dress" (not "Black Day" or "But Not Tonight").

Like the other re-issues, the DVD includes a documentary on the album. The title 
(seen below) is Martin paraphrasing Daniel Miller about his demos for Black 
Celebration in the film. The double-documentary discusses both The Singles 81>85 
and Black Celebration, its more challenging commercial success (especially the 
song "Stripped") and all five related singles. It also includes a plethora of 
behind-the-scenes footage of the making of Black Celebration and the ensuing 
tour. Highlights include the band meeting The Cure, and behind the scenes 
footage of several of the music videos. The documentary is nearly an hour.

It was released March 20, 2007 in the USA, March 26 in the UK and April 2 in the 
rest of Europe.

                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BLACK CELEBRATION     by Tim DiGravina

After "Blasphemous Rumours," could Depeche Mode really turn back from the dark 
trajectory on which they'd embarked? "Black Celebration," the opening track to 
the album which shares its title, is a celebration of the band's somewhat new, 
fiercely gloomy embrace of darkness. The musical arrangement is an ode to 
edginess: icy, piercing synths that build from what sounds like the minimal 
score to a horror film into what might pass for theme music for a nocturnal 
gathering of goblins. Indeed, in the slow racing tones that begin the song, one 
hears many similarities to Dario Argento collaborators Goblin and John 
Carpenter's score for Halloween. Simmering background sound effects suggest the 
growl or howl of nightmarish creatures. A dance beat arises, but with the 
increasingly chilly synths sucking away optimism, the song doesn't necessarily 
signal a stampede to the dance floor. David Gahan's tremulous, echoing, and 
processed voice is no brighter than the keyboard foundation it rises over. 
Martin Gore steps in with background vocals, eager to add a sinister, spooky 
punctuation to drive his lyrics home. That "Black Celebration" is actually a 
love song is quite remarkable. Looking past Gahan's cries that there's been 
another "black day," he's calling to his lover that he wants to take him or her 
"in his arms" to find consolation and relief. Why not celebrate their mutual 
disgust with the world? Why not revel in the reality that things aren't getting 
better? It's hard to imagine a more perfect opening to the band's fifth album 
and second foray into the shadows than "Black Celebration." 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A QUESTION OF LUST     	by Tim DiGravina

One of Martin Gore's most emotional ballads, "A Question of Lust" is a tender 
yet epic slice of beauty. Whenever Gore handles vocals on his own, it's a sign 
the song will deal with stark, personal feelings. Here, Gore's voice emerges as 
if he's singing a lullaby. By the time the song concludes, he's emoting 
desperation like a wounded gospel singer. Electronic sound effects build, tumble 
apart, and rebuild around his slightly echoing voice. Ambient sound washes, 
electronically processesed handclaps, complex racing keyboard melodies, and 
high-pitched synth notes paint an atmosphere of optimistic sadness. Gore sings 
of all his weaknesses, from his fragility to his crippling inhibitions to his 
constant apologies. Each time he repeats the chorus, more emotion is revealed. 
"It's a question of lust/It's a question of trust/It's a question of not letting 
what we've built up crumble to dust," Gore admits, that keep him and his lover 
together. "A Question of Lust" is a vital cog, if not the heart, of Black 
Celebration. It's a perfect Depeche Mode song and one of Martin Gore's most 
touching artistic achievements. Despite the fact that he's pouring out his soul 
by nearly screaming his vocals at times, the song is as delicate as a baby's 
blanket. That he's still singing as "A Question of Lust" fades out is all the 
more reason to reach for the repeat button on one's CD player. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A QUESTION OF TIME     by Tim DiGravina

A poppy, throbbing industrial tale of cliques and lust, "A Question of Time" is 
a perfect lead-in companion to "Stripped" on Black Celebration. David Gahan 
sings of a good-looking fifteen year old peer. It's difficult to listen to the 
song without thinking of the sixteen-year-old protagonist of "Blasphemous 
Rumours," though with its fuzzy, fun dance beats and angry tone, "A Question of 
Time" shares more in common musically with "Master and Servant" and "Behind the 
Wheel." "I've got to get to your first, before they do," he tells the object of 
his admiration. He knows that it's just "a question of time" before his friend 
is "stripped down" and "messed up" by the popular kids. The song has overtones 
of exploitation when Gahan sings, "I condemn them/I know my kind/What goes on in 
our minds." Gahan sings in deep, unapologetic tones. Martin Gore's higher 
background shout of "It should be better with you" adds an extra layer of 
desperation to the song. The album version feels just slightly limp compared to 
the live recording on 101, though the industrial chug is irresistibly catchy and 
endearing in every recorded version. "A Question of Time" is a perfect example 
of Depeche Mode's marriage of industrial-tinged electronic pop music with themes 
of love and lust. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRIPPED     by Tim DiGravina

Just as "People Are People" helped to define Depeche Mode as a catchy 
industrial-flavored synth act in the era of Some Great Reward, "Stripped" 
defined the darker trajectory and more mature subject matter the band suddenly 
and immediately mastered. It's unlikely there's ever been a more bleak love song 
to reach the popularity of "Stripped." The song's foundation is a complex blend 
of pounding bass beats, staccato electronic effects, and piercing keyboard 
notes. A sample recorded from a motorcycle serves as a constant, ratcheting 
background. The ominous synth washes that commence two and a half minutes in are 
now part of a classic, trademark sound. David Gahan's voice is processed with 
echo and tremolo effects. He implores his lover: "Let me see you stripped down 
to the bone; let me hear you make decisions without your television." He's 
basically asking his significant other to strip away every affectation and to 
shun the modern world for an extremely honest and open relationship. He's asking 
for an intense, possibly codependent union when he begs, "Let me hear you crying 
just for me." Imagery relating to the film Metropolis and industrial fumes 
juxtaposes with Gahan's desire to hide in the trees and lay on the grass away 
from it all. "Stripped" is an absolute tour de force of minimalist electronic 
tones and emotions for songwriter Martin Gore. Where "People Are People" seemed 
custom-geared to race up charts across the world, "Stripped" feels intensely 
personal and impenetrably gloomy. The song's unrelenting sense of dread is part 
of the reason it hit a nerve in so many listeners. Many of the songs on the 
band's next album, Music for the Masses, would follow the same formula of 
depression and emotional release. Though Depeche Mode would become more 
accomplished technically and polish its sound considerably on later releases, 
"Stripped" is one of the group's greatest achievements.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
