Virtual DJ 6 Pro - Brushed Metal Skin

Using the default skin as a template ive redesigned the look from top to bottom

ive called it brushed metal as it looks like it has a brushed metal finish to it.

It all works as it should and it has been tested.


Hope you like it, comments are welcome but bare in mind that this is only my second

attempt at a skin for virtual dj.

ENJOY
