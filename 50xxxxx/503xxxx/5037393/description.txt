By William J. Baumol, Alan S. Blinder

This text is well-known for using the Keynesian model in the teaching
of economics; yet, in recent editions, the authors have expanded
coverage of the growth model considerably to achieve more balanced
coverage. The text uses the aggregate supply/ aggregate demand model
as a fundamental tool for learning macroeconomics. It achieves the
right level of rigor and detail, presenting complicated concepts in a
relatively straightforward manner and using timely economic data.
Using puzzles, issues, and well-developed examples, the authors
provide a good balance of theory to application allowing you to
relate the materials to your everyday life.
