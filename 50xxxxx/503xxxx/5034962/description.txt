 After the departure of Rube Sofer, a new head reaper named Cameron Kane      
 takes over. He's a slick businessman who couldn't care less about helping    
 the newly dead. Chaos ensues and brings out the worst in Daisy and Mason     
 who begin drinking anew. George and Reggie re-connect for the first time     
 when George reaps a new friend of Reggie's.
