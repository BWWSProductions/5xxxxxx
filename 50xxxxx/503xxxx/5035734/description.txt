When trying to use an old Microsoft Sidewinder Pro Joystick (gameport), xp asked for files that were not on the system. So i had to go look for these, download them and hope they worked.

So here they are in one place. Just put them in some folder and when it asks you were the file is just go to that folder and open the file.

msgame
sw_effct.dll
sw_wheel.dll
