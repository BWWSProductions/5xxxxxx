,phasar,2012-04-01T00:17Z,"Wrong. Canadian Bacon was filmed before Wagons East. He died the night they wrapped Wagons East making Wagons East his last film. Canadian Bacon was released a year after his death, and after Wagons East, making it his last released film. But Wagons East was definitely the last film he worked on"
