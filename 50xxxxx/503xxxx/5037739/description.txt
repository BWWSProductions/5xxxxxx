Genre: Third-Person Shooter 
Release: Mar 17, 2002

WWII: Desert Rats is a good example of a budget game done right.
You drive a jeep, also control a gunner standing on the back of the jeep. The game's 12 levels are all set in North Africa during World War II. It's a good looking, fun, but forgotten game today.

â€¦score on -gamespot- 7.3 (good)!
