Ensemble Ars Nova

    * Based in MalmÃ¶, Sweden

 
Ensemble Ars Nova was founded in 1986 by composer Johannes Johansson, who also was its artistic director for the first nine years. Since 1995 guitarist Stefan Ã–stersjÃ¶ has been the artistic director of the group. The ensemble consists of a pool of free-lance musicians and members from the different orchestras in the South of Sweden, many of them also being some of the most important soloists in new music in Sweden. Ensemble Ars Nova has more and more sought out a repertoire, which combines instrumental and electro-acoustic sound sources. One of the goals for the work of the ensemble is to explore forms of expression in which instrumental music and music technology can come together and enrich one another.

Another facet of the ensembleâ€™s work has been the collaboration with other arts, most recently manifested in the â€œInterfaceâ€ series of productions including the first Scandinavian performance of Samuel Beckettâ€™s/Morton Feldmanâ€™s â€œWords and Musicâ€, the world premiere of James Clarkeâ€™s collaboration with Swedish choreographer Efva Lilja in â€œThe incredible youâ€ (including the world premiere of Clarkeâ€™s â€œKammersymphonieâ€) and several premieres of works by Swedish composers.

Ensemble Ars Nova has toured Sweden several times and participated in festivals for contemporary music in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Poland. Ensemble Ars Nova is regularly broadcasted by the Swedish radio and has recorded two CD's of its own (of which the second "All Digital" was nominated to a Swedish "Grammy -96" for best classical album) and participates on numerous other recordings.
