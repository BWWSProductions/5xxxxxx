She's BACK......and with a great NEW song!!
 

I Look to You is the first single by Whitney Houston, from her seventh studio album with the same name. The song became the title of the album because of its deep meaning, Houston says that the powerful piano ballad that sums up the album and is all she wants to say at this stage of her life.

As I lay me down 
Heaven hear me now 
Im lost without a cause 
After giving it my all 

Winter storms have come 
And darkened my sun 
After all that I've been through 
Who on earth can I turn to 

I look to you 
I look to you 

After all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 

I look to you 
I look to you 

Yeah 

And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 

I look to you 

After losing my breath 
There's no more fighting left 
Sinking to rise no more 
Searching for that open door 

And every road that I've taken 
Lead to my regret 
And I don't know if Im gonna make it 
Nothing to do but lift my head 

I look to you 
I look to you 

Yeah 

And when all my strength is gone 
In you I can be strong 

I look to you 
I look to you 

Oh yeah 

And when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 

I look to you 


(my levee's have broken, my walls have come) 

Coming down on me 

(crumbling down on me) 

All the rain is falling 

(the rain is falling, defeat is calling) 

Set me free 

(i need you to set me free) 

Take me far away from the battle 
I need you 
Shine on me 

I look to you 
I look to you 

After all my strength has gone 
in you I can be strong 

I look to you 
I look to you 

and when melodies are gone 
In you I hear a song 

I look to you 

yeah 

I look to you 
oooooooh 
I look to you
