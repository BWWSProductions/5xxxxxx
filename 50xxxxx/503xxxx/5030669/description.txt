As the result of the increasing demand for greater functions, many applications are more and more complicated. Every program installation on Windows may cause the operating system to change in a big way, such as copying system files, modifying registry, generating log files, installing device drivers and system services. All of these operations will affect the system performance and occupy disk space. Installing and uninstalling software repeatedly is often the case, which will cause system slowdown, freezing or crashing. It may also lead to some mysterious error messages popping up or other new software canâ€™t be installed correctly. Final Uninstaller has a scientific method of dealing with these problems.

Final Uninstaller uses a high-performance detection algorithm that will quickly identify the left-over files and registry entries of every program installed in your computer. With a few clicks, Final Uninstaller can thoroughly scan your entire Windows registry and drives and provide a list of the applications that are not completely uninstalled. After that you can choose to clean list items to get rid of those applications you donâ€™t want.
