With a budget of 1,500 pounds and 5 weeks build time, "The Barley Pickers", "The Green Goddesses", "The Boat Boys", "The Megalomaniacs" and "The Chaos Crew" must build roadworthy vehicles and drive 1,000 miles around the UK, completing challenges along the way - modifying their vehicles to suit each challenge.

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. So please, do your part.
