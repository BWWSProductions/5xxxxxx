It was VERY difficult to obtain these files through the web! Microsoft or someone has been repeatedly tracking down available downloads for these files and removing them. I finally found these files and tested them for quality. They worked for me. Note that these programs are extremely small because they are designed to do very very small tasks. So don't be put off by the file size just download it and scan for yourself. (I used Mcaffee and it didn't detect anything). I really hope that by uploading these programs, I make it easier for those of you who want to upload modded files to your 360! Please be aware that I AM NOT THE CREATOR OF THESE FILES I am simply redistributing them for convenience. please seed this and keep it alive. Also please comment on them.
