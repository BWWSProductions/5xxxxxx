,orotnref,2009-07-31T19:41Z,"Interesting perspective, but you should actually listen to what he says about cults. He doesn't care for cults or groupies himself and in his first lecture he reminds a raving fan... ""value the principles not the personality"". "
,Ethan211,2009-10-01T01:22Z,"Of course he denounces cults, it would be terrible for recruiting if he endorsed them.

Sort of like how Scientology runs the Cult Awareness Network..."

My thoughts on Kinesiology as a tool to discern Truth

Buddha said: DonÂ´t not believe in anything, unless it makes sense to you.

I have done AK, and I did the months, one after another, and only got strong on one, then I checked and I was amazed for it was the right answer and my belief in it increased drastically. However, this test was not guilty because I had seen the answer before; I just didn?t know it consciously.

I am better off AK, since it have no proof, not even one (accident, or chance) ever. It can affirm belief, and dig up what your subconscious hold, but that is as far as it gets. The experiments I have heard is that they prayed, and meditated on the truth for several days before. And when the experiment was over the result was quite a surprise, it didn?t work after all.
Other people have calibrated things for me, and not got even close as well.

David Hawkins group experiment

D Hawkins; ?What we did this morning (AK many people simultaneously) have really never been done in the history of mankind. No group has ever collectively, simultaneously verified in the most erudite way we know to verify truth, the reality of God and the spiritual reality in which we are all seeking. It has not been done before?. Okay, so this is interesting, he thinks AK is the most erudite way? Have he not do this before? Did he lie about all years of experiments with hundreds upon hundreds of people taking part?

His group ?experiment?, cannot on rational ground be held as an experiment (also, people spoke openly it didn?t work for some, the other was probably smart not to say anything and hear how stupid they are), since he said things like, if you wonÂ´t get this (something) positive, then you are stupid and donÂ´t belong here etc. (yeah, he even implied it openly, this is even worst then the experiment of me doing AK) Of this there is the reply of a person, which sums up my view:

?David Hawkins (& I have read all of his books) is a slave of his own ego. He projects his views upon a room full of people and especially upon the subject he is muscle testing and then, voila!, gets the result he thought he would. This is a well known phenomenon in muscle testing where the practitioner induces results mentally. It?s a type of hypnosis.?

Of what I have studied that is just so. For it happens frequently that it does not work, and he says, ?ohh, forget about the calibration?. In a certain moment, he first calibrated she is not losing control of her muscles, it is emotional or something, then when she explained some more, (with new information) he calibrated that she is physically sick and it is not emotional. Woah, this Doc is good (affirming what she just said after she said it, this means that the tool work both ways, Doc is not the only one that impose beliefs on others), infinite field plays trick?

DH says: ?What would humanity do without kinesiology??

Well? ^__^

Kinesiology sounds a bit like scientology, and I have never been much interest at all (I can sense it easily; especially his ?experiments? are very nonintegrious). Some say it is a well established science. Lol. There are no scientists, (Hawkins even often confirm that, every year and have to defend it constantly, and he seems to have given up AK (realized, and looked through his data?) for he starts to argue about other things, such as you get weak or strong with certain things, but that does not even address the question.

The facts he get is like this: DH says: ?I read in the scriptures, Jesus did not speak of any previous birth?, and then he calibrates that statement to be so. He goes on saying: ?Buddha had many previous births, he spoke about it?, than he calibrates Buddha to have had previous rebirth. This is obvious his imposed beliefs, for when it does not work you hear his wife say: ?we need to study it?. Why study it, does not the infinite field of consciousness know everything? Isn?t this tool to be used in a way that you can access all knowledge without the need to study everything, but to be able to pick out, which is what DH hims"
,supermegaman,2009-12-03T17:01Z,Scientology have the same tool. LOL.
