David Bowie: The Definitive Rarities Volume Two

51 tracks. Nearly four hours of Bowie!

So, browsing through my last torrent, I noticed a few unforgivable omissions.  Here are several more essential rare David Bowie tracks.  

As a bonus I have included some my favorite less common live bootleg songs (you deserve it). Most have very good sound quality.

Pay it Fwd!
