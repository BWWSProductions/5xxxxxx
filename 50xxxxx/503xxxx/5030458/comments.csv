[T],shuazien,2009-07-30T16:56Z,"I just tried to register as ""rustybrilopad"" so I could leave a nice comment here, but pirate bay said that was too long of a username, oh well."
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-30T17:15Z,Today's O&A is going to be up late... the show ran long into R&F!!
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-30T18:01Z,"07-30 running late, the show over into R&F time! 3 sources (including mine) all cut at 11ish and are missing the last 5 minutes of babbling. I've decided to up what I have for now, I'll kill it if I get the rest of it soon. As for the 128k, I want it all in so I may wait until after the replay to get it up."
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-30T18:21Z,"Alright got the missing minutes, still missing prolly 30 seconds between the sources but the ending is there. Up in 30.... sorry folks."
,SpecialED3,2009-07-30T18:29Z,"youre a good man shuazien.

i thought the computer was supposed to prevent this from happening? dont get me wrong id love some extra o&a content but they say it like 3 times a week that the computer is gonna shut them off so why didnt it today?"
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-30T18:33Z,"They've changed the ""system"" and there's been weird issues all week where they were back from break early weren't even ready for it. The ogg usenet ups start right away for R&F i figured I'd just grab those but they are not up. I am going to have to grab the last few minutes of the replay for the 128k up, so it won't be up until later tonight. "
[T],shuazien,2009-07-30T18:57Z,"Ahem...

A fancy man such as myself can't be made to wait like this.

Ramone...Bring me today's OnA!"
