,MikeQuest3,2010-04-18T04:30Z,"Thanks for uploading & to those seeding.
good & funny movie, good print, very sharp clear image. No audio or video errors of any sort, full runtime. best part is subtitles included (as seperate file) so no need to go hunting for them, all specifications already provided by uploader, good choice for download.

,zingo_punkbuzter,2010-09-23T13:30Z,"very good quality thx for uploading. but, i'd like to add a request.

could you add the SPDIF output into your BDrips? ..or maby put this question as a request in the network u're in that does the BDrips? would be very cool if all with the (Kingdom-Release) tag had this output, sence i think im not the only movie-fan of yours that has hes/her computerhooked up with a reciever, who actualy want to have use of all hes/her speakers.

i find it very hard to search for the movies i want in H264 > MP4 > 720p - movies with this option. either it's very poor picture, or overkill-sized, rarely about 2gb.

for those who don't know what im talking about, but still using your surround reciever and have all the speakers, but still used to listen to 6ch stereo.. try search your movie you want to DL, then add ""WAF"" or ""DTS"" in your search, just like you do to find ""H264"". for example: ""Kung Fu Panda WAF"" or: ""Transformers 2 DTS"", and you will find what you need to experience the true nature of your digital equipment. 

sadly, those movies are about 4 - 8gb's, and ofthen low on seeders.

sence KD-release allready are in the top, why not be better than the best?

it's just a request, i don't know if this is possible without exceeding the limit of size your team has, but i'd very much appreciate it."
