Thanks for your awesome work!
Any chance you could reseed Dave?
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4243093/Dave.1993.MULTISUBS.PAL.WS.DVDR-minOdroL
Is there anything you'd like me to help seed? I have 15GB of free space on a 10mbit connection."
[T],minOdroL,2009-08-10T13:15Z,"TheUnit2: You are welcome :) Been away a few days but will start re-seeding Dave now.

If you want to help me out if would be greatly appreciated if you could just keep that torrent seeded indefinately, because it is the torrent I've had to reseed the most! Thx."
