From the Academy Award-winning creators of Toy Story and Finding Nemo, comes this hilarious animated adventure about a team of superheroes.

Bob Parr was once known as Mr Incredible, the world's greatest superhero. Fifteen years later, Bob and his wife, Helen (Formerly Elastigirl), have adopted civillian identities and retreated to the suburbs to lead "normal lives" with their three children. Now Bob's a clock-punching insurance claims adjuster fighting boredom and an ever-bulging waistline. However, Bob is thrown back into the world of super-heroism when he receives a mysterious communication summoning him to a remote island for a top-secret mission.

Yet again, Pixar continue their trend for making ground-breaking animated films, stretching the boundries laid down by their previous movies.
