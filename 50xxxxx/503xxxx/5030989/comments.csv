,AladinSane1984,2009-07-30T05:18Z,aaah the soothing acoustic stylings of el rushbo and his eib band
,ZERO_BS,2009-07-30T19:28Z,"Yup, thanks again!

It's funny how sheeple like sistromoo think of us as Rush ""followers"" instead of independent thinkers.

We're here for the information and the opinions, which we agree and disagree with. Unlike Obamabots, we tend to THINK. We also don't support racists.

If you ever want to shut up an Obamabot, just quote Obama. Take your pick- racist quotes, Marxist quotes, whatever... there are plenty to choose from."
,nuktriggerpuller,2009-07-30T20:34Z,Have not commented in a while because I was making obscene profits.  Profits that support the leeches like sistromo and the like. Time to hide those profits so.......

Thanks as always jwhitt62."
