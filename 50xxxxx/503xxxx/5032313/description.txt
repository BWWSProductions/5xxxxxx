WORK DONE: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, First it was syncing the english audio with the video, they lined
up fine, appart from a couple of minute clip where i had to line 
up the end of p1 audio with cd 2, finding it took a but of time.. anyway
once done it was onto audio part 2, there was quite a few blank bits in
audio, so had to cut those out, but appart from that synced in only
a couple of cuts, and audio in the end was 3 parts due to cd2 starts a 
few minutes before part 2 audio.

i did cheack a fair bit of it then flicked throught and in the bits i watched 
there was no oos bits, woot just finished my second complete audio sync, woot
woot, expect many more releases in future.. 

Video was pritty much ok, cropped the black bars and the adverts from the
beginning.

if you wish Feel Free to Use my Synced Audio, to save yourselves time, 
just please give me credit for syncing :)
