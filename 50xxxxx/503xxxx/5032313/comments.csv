Anyway This is in english."

,Fuctard,2009-07-31T07:16Z,man this is the same as that lynks one its shit

,GAZZA2008,2009-07-31T11:04Z,any quotes on 100% audio and video plz?
,outpatient730,2009-07-31T11:06Z,chairs in the way and blurry....v4 a5
[T],DellTrotter,2009-07-31T12:32Z,"Fuctard - yes it will visually look similar to lynks, we used the same video source.
GAZZA2008 - it is 100% complete you have the start and the end credits.
outpatient730 - yes there is a bit of a chair, and it is a bit blury,
the blury ness is due to it being recorded from a 3D Cinema."
,maskofdarkness22,2009-07-31T23:04Z,i only got 2% more to go then i can seed it for a good while
,dead2you,2009-08-01T21:34Z,"I have seen some crap in my life and this takes the cake. The audio is not in sync, and the video is horrible, all you see on the whole left side is people due to the camera being way too low. So audio is a 1 and video is a 2. I know its free, but sometimes the thought isnt worth the time, and this isnt worth your time to download. Sorry,but thanks for the effort,but if it was me i would remove this as a download cuz its that bad"
[T],DellTrotter,2009-08-01T23:04Z,"dead2you - did you even download it ?? if you had you would know it is in sync, or it is in the most parts. if you had of downloaded it you would know the whole left side is not people, there is 1 head and 1 chair althought it does not cover anything much, just a little bit in the corner, SO PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT NEXT TIME BEFORE COMMENTING."
,dead2you,2009-08-02T00:36Z,"Delltrotter I did download it, and you know this torrent sucks, but people like you think your doing us all a favor, by uploading this crap. That is what this is ""crap"" and I wouldnt be sooooo proud of you trying to sync this, cuz its a poor job. To ask if I downloaded it isnt it obvious? How else would I know how bad you did on the sync, and about the two heads, and row of chairs in the video ""Jackass""...TO ALL OUT THERE THIS GUY IS A JOKE, DONT DOWNLOAD. THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND SPACE. Wait for the better upload, or buy in the store when released"
[T],DellTrotter,2009-08-02T01:27Z,"dead2you - can you do a better job ??? i think not. it is not massivly oos, cheacking again throught now, it is for a few moments at the 18 minute mark, if it was massivly out of sync do you really think you would be the only one, secondly there is not a row of chairs its 1 chair, unless you have the balls to cam, dont complain about the cam quality, its a cam, what where you expecting ? IF YOU THINK YOU CAN DO A BETTER JOB AT SYNCING AND CAMMING AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF YOU ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT, GO ON DO IT ?? OH I THINK YOU ARE ALL MOUTH."
,dead2you,2009-08-02T03:44Z,"Delltrotter if you would have read my first review I said thanks for the effort, correct? Some cam jobs are good and some are not, and this is just one that sucks. Why you try to defend this shit piece is beyond me. It sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks, oh by the way it sucks!!!!!! Just cuz you think your the shit by saying first one in english,who cares. like I said the quality for a screener is alwfull, and I am not the only 1 saying its not that great, read the other review of chairs in the way, and blurry by outpatient730. People this was a 3D movie so the quality sucks, it is way blurry. TRUST THE REVIEW DONT DOWNLOAD, WASTE OF TIME!!!!! EVEN MY KIDS AND THERE FRIENDS COULDNT WATCH DUE TO THE POOR QUALITY!!!!!! AND KIDS MOST OF THE TIME DONT CARE. for a screener this is below screen quality 'SORRY"""
[T],DellTrotter,2009-08-02T12:15Z,"dead2you - This is not a screener, it is A CAM, yes it is blury but what do you expect when it cammed from a 3d screen if you  do not understand 3d, 3d is two layers of images, as such it will be blury. Have You Cammed Anthing ? Have You Synced everythign ? have you recorded any audio ? NO NO AND NO, SO WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO SAY THIS SUCKS ?

reviews on quality is one thing but saying something sucks, is just foolish, it is a CAM, CAM is recorded in a cinema OK ?"
,IpodTouchGuy,2009-08-29T12:29Z,"Dude, just had the craziest idea eva. I went to see ice age 3d, and kept the 3d glasses. If this is filmed from a 3d projection, then it might just work...? am dling will comment after i try."
