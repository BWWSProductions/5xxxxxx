,jeroboam2,2009-08-03T22:33Z,"TPB isn't closing this week !
It will just be unavaillable for Netherland users that can't use a proxy ;-)"
,Skreshavik,2009-08-04T19:10Z,"That's a shame, that's a real damn shame.
Thanks for the temp. site, was wondering why there hasn't been any new content here lately XD

God's blessings."
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-08-06T01:57Z,Be sure to spread the word about the new temporary forum!
,offensiveideologue,2009-08-06T08:33Z,"Honestly, unless the new sysadmin of TPB starts tossing out MAC addresses to INTERPOL/FBI/NSA/RIAA/MPAA/whateverlegalauthoritymayexist, I'm trying to keep my (justified! ever justified!) paranoia in mild check. While your materials may be considered unsavory by some, they are certainly legal, and it will be up to Ragnar Benson or Kurt Saxon themselves if they'd like to take a word with you...or myself. Personally, I'd love it if you could keep this account up, at least until there's suspicion that the sysadmin has sold us out. There's a lot of great information here which is far too scarce to simply go under with it... I understand if you feel that you can't do so, but please consider account removal as a last resort only, or provide advance notice....not that you owe me, or anyone anything as you've provided nothing but great material for so long, but...it'd be damned decent of you. Anyhow, if I don't get a chance to tell you again due to circumstance unforeseen, thanks yet again for providing this information. I, if no one else, appreciate your time and efforts... but I am certain that others do, as well. 

Peace, friend - until war becomes a necessity."

,DumbLuck,2009-08-12T10:21Z,"The ability of humans to exchange information freely, instantly, accurately, and globally using the internet represents the peak of the electronic age. The absolute freedom of information holds within it the potential to topple oppressive governments, to freely share art, to render centralized news agencies obsolete, as well as to rapidly advance scientific and medical technology. The loss of TPB is bigger than a handful of Swedes selling a website, and it is bigger than some stubborn capitalists in Los Angeles ruthlessly defending their profit margins. THIS IS A LOSS OF FREEDOM. However, I doubt it will be too harrowing a task to get the same audio, video, and e-books elsewhere. And this speaks volumes about the intrinsic stability and brilliance of the torrent network composed of TPB, mininova, isohunt, et al. These sites will all collectively fill the void left behind by TPB, the torrent network reacting like any other compartmentalized mutualist system. RIP TPB!

One last thanks to DTOM for empowering people to empower themselves!  Nothing feels quite as liberating as sharing ""taboo"" information.  And thanks to DTOM and people like him/her, I feel quite liberated at the moment.  Never let a person or government tell you what to read/say/think/do.  

And I leave you all (and the TPB as we know it) with a quote: 

?The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.?

,MrPoopers,2009-08-16T20:33Z,"They are probably holding him/her in prison for 90 days, or something.
I think that this trend (lkxwag) and now rogue science) can be attributed to the desires of a group of people.
Our society nowadays on the whole is very conformant, the long, vacuous, voiding road has been pushed forward by conservatives who would twist Plato's words
From a website (yohbgo) about Plato:
""The peasants are the foundation of the society.  They till the soil and produce goods, i.e. take care of society?s basic appetites.  The warriors represent the spirit and courage of the society.  And the philosopher kings guide the society, as reason guides our lives.
Before you assume that we are just looking at a Greek version of the Indian caste system, please note:  Everyone?s children are raised together and membership in one of the three levels of society is based on talents, not on one?s birth parents!  And Plato includes women as men?s equals in this system.""
It may very be that this (present day) condition has come about because, in the mindset (and perhaps even unaware of it) of making  _everything_  easier, our society would do away with the middle class (see above and the present day definition, both).
Or it could be because Plato used the word ""king"" (one who rules with absolute power by birthright).


Anyway, I am happy that there are still bastions like Paladin Press, Atlan Formularies, and thememoryhole dot org (go give money to Russ Kick NOW! I did!).  And, even then, we have the (Insert Scientific Field Here) Complete series of torrents, but they are quite outdated.
I wish I had more money."
