If I was asked to describe my musical style, I would think carefully, wait a few seconds, and then answer, I have no idea!
There have been so many influences for me that it has ended up as a fruit salad style. Depends what fruits are in season.
Sometimes acoustic blues & country, sometimes power chord punk, sometimes classic rock and then just for fun a bit of effects driven noise with no limit.
