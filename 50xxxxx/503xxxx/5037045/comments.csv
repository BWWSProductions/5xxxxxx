,sgriff59,2009-08-03T21:47Z,I would be suspicios because Limewire just release version 5.2.13...there is no limewire 5.2.8.
,thatswhatshewatched,2009-08-05T01:19Z,"@dolberman2: Limewire Pro doesn't require a crack.  If you purchase the program they direct you to a download of the full pro version, which is what this is.

@sgriff59:  5.2.8 is a beta version that was released on 7/22/09.  I don't waste my time or anyone else's by releasing ""suspicious"" torrents."
