,Mushibu09,2009-12-26T12:37Z,Is this the full version??
,Thardmann,2009-12-29T23:29Z,"I have downloaded this, and are installing as i speak. ill get back with results."

,Revolutie,2010-01-23T18:08Z,"Contains ""Trojan.Peed"" inside Cab1.rar 

It fucked up my computer pretty well, so make sure you get it cleaned."
,Revolutie,2010-02-05T22:55Z,"To Install Perfectly W/out Problems-----

Before Continuing with installation, There is Trojan.Peed in Data1.cab It attatches itself to the exe file, and downloads other SHIT. Most significant way of seeing if you have it is....Virus scan, OR Your computer progressively (1week or so) starts to turn from a Quad Core with Nvidia, to a Pentium D....

-------------------------

Extract 3dsmax2010.iso (using 7zip) go into 
support>Partners and DELETE Motion Builder all together. Do not need it. If you go further into MotionBuilder you'll find the Data1.cab, if you delete that but leave Motionbuilder your 3dmax installation will fuck up

------------------------

Install BOTH 32bit and 64bit, Once DirectXRuntimeUpdate is finished, TURN OFF INTERNET CONNECTION!!. The 32bit and 64bit Max installations will try to open ports for them to access the internet, do not allow, or simply shut off internet AFTER Runtime Update

Once 32bit and 64 bit are installed, use the Xforce 64 bit on the Max 64 bit or 32bit xforce on the Max 32bit

-------------
REASON: Xforce 64 bit will NOT work on Max 64bit unless 32Bit Max is installed as well.

Best tutorial ever right here..."
,1Bot,2010-02-06T04:30Z,"Good full actual version, thanks!"
,dawebmast,2010-02-18T04:06Z,"it tells me to insert DISC_1CD1
why is this????"
,Rappoz,2010-04-27T12:04Z,"Just installed it on Vista-32, and It works fine, thank you 50c3nt :)

I got a warning from the installer the id might be incorrect, but it didnt stop me from activating.
I used the keygen from the extra dir in this torrent, not the ones on the iso, but i guess they're the same.

Again, great job 50c3nt."
,bubbaganoush2,2010-08-16T20:28Z,"@ Revolutie, i'm trying to install this, i mounted this onto Power-ISO and opened it up and deleted MB, like you said. now i'm going to be installing the 32bit version, i have windows Xp on an older HP Pavilion.do i still need to install 32 & 64 bit to get the Xforce 64 to work for me?? or just install for 32bit??thanks"
