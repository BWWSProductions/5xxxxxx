,bbutton1,2010-03-28T21:01Z,"well, there are decent blu-ray rips in size of 4.5gb and I can bet that you can't tell the difference between this one and that one...

of course, if you are sucker as I am for a great quality video you'll download the largest file out there :)"
,bbutton1,2010-05-08T17:01Z,"Guys, do you understand there's already around 13 times downloaded material but because you don't seed we all have 13 movies divided between 50 of us.
As you can see I've been downloading this for a month now. Adding up to 7 days of constant internet connection. Uploaded freaking 120GB and downloaded only 12.5GB. C'mon guys, please just seed."
