pYLON pIRATES by Snakebeings

04:50
a Group of pylon resistance fighters become corrupted by the hum of the wires - Might be a bit regional, but in the Waikato, new zealand a power company wanted to put pylons across farmlands and houses, there was a lot of resistance to the idea- excuse the pun- including threats of armed retail-iation "get off my land!" he says waving a shotgun-you know the type of thing- this film is taking the idea further and the pylon badder meinhoff terrorist group threaten to take the power into their own hands- of course all power corrupts and the hum of the pylon proves to be very seductive.
