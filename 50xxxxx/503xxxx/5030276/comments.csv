,dibikin7,2009-07-30T09:05Z,this was a good clean copy. the quality was great. just make sure you have a program to take the ISO image to a dvd or whatever. thanks for the post!
,buddog05,2009-08-06T01:01Z,"The Insanity Dvd's have a newer Copy Right Protection on it, Ive tried 6 different rippers including: HandBrake, CloneDVD2, DVDRipper, Xilisoft, and so on,
I also have used DVD 43 along side with it, as well as tried AnyDVD separate from DVD43

All it does is stop after a little bit and fails when Im trying to rip each dvd, If anyone could help me figure out how to rip it then I can possibly get it posted as well.
Thanks"
