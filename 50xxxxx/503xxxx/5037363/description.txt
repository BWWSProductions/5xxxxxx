I wasn't sure if I would end up doing this but after my friends suggesting I try to get my stuff out to a wider audience, I gave in and made a torrent. All of these songs I made myself, all in FL Studio. I hope you at least find them interesting, mind you I'm doing all this music myself.. I never have any help on them. If you have comments or suggestions on any of them you can just leave them here, I check my torrents often to see if there are problems and such.

thanks and enjoy,
