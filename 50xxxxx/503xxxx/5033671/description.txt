Back in the early 1980's, around the same time that Metallica and Slayer were making their mark on the brand new American Thrash scene Anihilated evolved from their early Punk roots into one of the UK's first ever Thrash Metal bands with this being their first release in 1986.


The flac version i had did not have adequate quality so i converted this album to wav and adjusted the highs and lows to fit my tastes.
