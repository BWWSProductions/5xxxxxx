observe others do
but thanks for spreading the hate"
,t0rent3,2009-08-29T18:25Z,"Need activation, but not work any activation methods/crack what I found. 

Also I don't found any serial what accept this version...

Anyone activated this version? How?

I tried x64 ent version to activate and failed..."
,4wdturbo,2009-11-28T12:10Z,"IT WORKS !

The only problem is for the Administrator password with could contain a number, a space and a MAJUSCULE (don't remember the english version).
It worked for 3 weeks on my server."
,4wdturbo,2009-11-28T16:42Z,"If you need some serials :

,4wdturbo,2009-11-29T02:31Z,"I made new tests and have some problem with the serials I gave above.
I found another solution : I used the RemoveWAT programme for Windows 7 x64 and it norw works.
My server is not connected to Internet so I don't know if it's still work i this case.
Have fun !
Sorry for my English, I'm French ! ;-)"

It needs letters from the Aa0 classes. Search for ""Passwords must meet complexity requirements""."
,thbandit1,2010-01-17T22:04Z,Evaluation copy - good for 180 days - - - not worth the DVD I burned it to :(
,carbuck,2010-02-04T19:04Z,"If you don't know how to make it work past the trial period, you should probably be downloading something simple like OSX"
,thevoidzero,2010-03-23T08:27Z,I'd like some tips instead. How can we activate it?
,Born2achieve,2010-04-01T07:38Z,"Windows Product Activation has been changed to a larger extent for Windows Server 2008 R2.

I guess we would have to be content with 180 Days Eval only."
,stalker2755,2010-04-15T01:48Z,Or you all could search for a BIE release and take a look at their activator/crack.
,Ludskiiz,2010-05-08T20:08Z,I have the serial for this if anyone wants to contact me for it
,raw_power,2010-05-13T12:23Z,"Hey Ludskiiz,
Any chance for that code? I was using a boot loader but an actual code would be good please? http://www.anonomi.com/rawpower
On another note, after installation the Roles and Features on the server say ""Error"" after installing in Datacenter edition. I'll reinstall it again and see how things go.

Thanks for the upload, R2 isn't even on my msdn account"
,raw_power,2010-05-15T04:56Z,Works fine now
,ap3rus,2010-05-16T10:12Z,why would you want the serial if there's no possible way to activate windows with it?
,raw_power,2010-05-16T15:28Z,"Meh, works with the bootloader, just thought Ludskiiz had a better way. Never contacted me though"
,sachabey,2010-08-30T18:19Z,"I'm hoping to try this activator after I download this. Give it a shot..

,BluECliQ,2010-09-14T15:00Z,"A previous poster said RemoveWAT worked for him, but his server is not connected to the internet. Can anyone confirm if this works with an internet connection involved?"
,gilect,2010-10-23T18:19Z,"sry can someone help me
it says i must change administrator password old and new one i type only numbers or letters but it gaves me an error"
,wafiknoob111,2010-10-31T21:30Z,"It works
But i just get a problem;i just installed it on vmware WS 7.1 once installation finished i got ukranian language and a datacenter version !!!!!
How to proceed ?
"
,wafiknoob111,2010-11-01T01:26Z,"OK no need to find a way !!!
I just find HOWTO"
,Jalhalla,2010-11-29T20:32Z,"Hey guys, here's a good Enterprise Edition serial:
CQ936-9K2T8-6GPRX-3JR9T-JF4CJ

Also, this installs in Ukranian, bit of a pain. However, you can change it by going to the Control Panel.

Also Windows 7 Loader Extreme works fine for bypassing activation.
