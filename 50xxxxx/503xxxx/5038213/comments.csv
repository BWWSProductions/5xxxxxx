,choempi,2009-08-02T19:56Z,"What a wonderful congregation of talent! Newer versions may have color and language easier for the modern ear to understand, but lovers of Shakespeare should make a point of watching this classic! Although sometimes dim and patchy, for its time, this movie contained some very inventive visual effects, effectively drawing the viewer into the fairy world. And, considering the materials of the era, one has to wonder at the time and effort involved in the construction of the fairy costumes and environment.

James Cagney's portrayal of Bottom, the tinker, shows a seldom seen side of the actor, who is more often remembered for his tough guys and dancing roles. While wearing a full-face donkey head, he was able to convey all the emotions from fright to joy through body language.

Mickey Rooney's portrayal of Puck, the mischievous wood sprite, showed his early natural talent for mimickry and comedy that would evolve in the coming years.

Other actors, who were known but not yet as famous as they would be in later years, and stars from the earliest years of film also lent their talents to this picture. Joe E. Brown, Hugh Herbert, Olivia de Havilland, Dick Powell, Victor Jory, Ian Hunter, and many others make this film a true Classic! "
