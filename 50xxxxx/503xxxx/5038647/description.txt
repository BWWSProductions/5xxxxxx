wiki: "Ferus Mustafov, also known as King Ferus Mustafov, is a Macedonian saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist who is highly popular in his home country for his repertoire of Balkan folk and gypsy, or Rom, wedding music. He is also credited as one of the artists from the Balkan region to have made this type of music internationally popular.

He was born in Å tip, in the east of the Republic of Macedonia, into a Rom family of musicians and is the son of Ilmi JaÅ¡arov who is credited with introducing the saxophone into the folk music of the area. His professional career began at the age of seventeen whilst studying violin and clarinet at his local junior music academy. During this time he was invited to go on tour with a band led by Toma ÄŒrÄev and the tour's success led him to abandon his academic learning to become a working musician. Following a year of military service, during which he established his reputation playing at evening dances, he moved to Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he took a leading role in the explosion in popularity of folk music taking place there at the time. Later, he became a director of musical programming in the Rom language for Radio Television in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia, and gained an international audience through his album releases on world music record labels such as Globe Style and Tropical."

From band:
"Each and every musician, irrespective of the genre that he or she cultivates, seeks to find examples and masters to learn from, as well as to look up to. It is an extraordinary experience for one to play with someone else that one regards as one's master. It is this experience that we intend to share by our third album. Before this album was released, we had played exclusively authentic folk music, so the present CD, from this aspect, is a novelty. This is our first release, which makes a through presentation of the Macedonian-Gipsy music tradition, still existing and so wonderfully rich in melodies, with Ferus, the greatest representative of the genre, playing and Ãgnes Herczku singing in her exceptional voice." - Attila BuzÃ¡s, SÃ¶ndÃ¶rgÅ‘

Another take:
"The SÃ¶ndÃ¶rgÅ‘ Ensemble was established in Szentendre, Hungary, in 1995. It was on the basis of our family tradition and due to our attraction to Southern Slav folk music that we set the objective of cultivating this particularly rich and valuable tradition. It was during our secondary education years that we got to know each other and began playing music together. We strive to perform archaic folk music in a concert setup and to instrumentalise it in a way that is true to both reality and tradition. We are currently studying the folk music collected by great Hungarian researchers of music such as BÃ©la BartÃ³k and TihamÃ©r Vujicsics, as well as the extant Southern Slav folk music tradition.
Our ensemble is classified as a tambur band occasionally complemented with accordeon and flute.
To perform melodies from the Balkans, we sound various wind instruments such as clarinet, kaval and saxophone, a variety of drums like tarabuka and tapan, as well as a wealth of string instruments, e.g. litarka. 

Southern Slav folk music has developed an extraordinary treasure of melodies as a result of an interaction with various music traditions.

This applies to Serbian and Croatian folk music in Hungary more than it does to folk music in the Balkans.

All along, the Southern Slav ethnicities living in Hungary have been particularly isolated from each other. Consequently, the traditions that they treasure and maintain display a wide variety of differences, which is demonstrated by the use of a wealth of musical instrument types and forms.

The first written record of the Southern Slav tambur dates from 1551, this instrument being of Iranian and Turkish origin, used in a variety of forms in the Balkan peninsula. Originally, the tambur was a solo instrument with a small resonance volume and a long neck.

It began to be updated in the 1800s with a long neck and a diatonic succession of sounds.

It was by the middle of the 1800s that the tambur family used today had evolved. They have four strings, a shorter neck and represent the so-called cromatic succession of sounds, classified as the SzerÃ©msÃ©g type of instruments.
The first tambur band of amateur artists was set up by Pajo Kolaric, in EszÃ©k, in 1847."
