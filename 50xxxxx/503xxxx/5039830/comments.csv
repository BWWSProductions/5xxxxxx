,HairyinFlorida,2009-08-05T21:02Z,"Hi Murlok!  I've downloaded the torrent, unpacked it, and installed the program.  I see a patch file, but where's the license?  I also didn't see anything in the READEME files on instructions for the torrent?  Is the patch suppose to kill any server check?  Thank you for the torrent!  Happy SEEDING guys!!  "

[V],Murlok,2009-09-21T15:37Z,Thanks for comments:) To you don´t know how use apps save me you comments! Since you not contribute to are community anyway!Don´t like me don´t download :(
[V],big_dad_e,2009-09-21T20:25Z,"Murlok, I understand THIS version IS working.  I must have used one of the other versions you upped that failed like:https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918592/Babylon_Pro_v8.0.0.r20.Incl.License_by_ZWT_%28Murlok%29 OR:https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4578870/Babylon_Pro_v7.5.2_%28r3%29_%5BNewLicense%5D.  I didn't realize you had other versions.  My mistake, and yours."
,Claude433,2009-12-15T17:26Z,"Murlock, thanks for the great upload; very simple to install. For those having difficulty, disconnect from the internet and install the app. when that's done, just double click ZWT.bof and, when the pop-up screen appears, decline to download and finish: job done and too simple for words."

,Baz2017,2010-01-17T10:51Z,"Thanks :)

Had no troubles getting it licensed (Y) "
,danydela4,2010-02-03T13:45Z,"Thx for the program, had no problem to crack it .
Keep up the good work"
,interhooked,2010-02-26T18:38Z,does not work at windows 7 64bit i mean installation was ok but the one click translate didn't work (clean from virus)
,L.exe.M,2010-03-01T08:42Z,"Great upload murlok, as always a flawless one.

However,

I have a question to ask, after ive got it registered and everything, do i keep it blocked on my firewall or can i unblock it? Also also if i can unblock it, will updates work on this?"
,bloodii,2010-03-07T12:44Z,Works Great 
,CliveCar,2010-03-18T13:45Z,"Excellent upload. License works.
Apparently virus-free.
Thanks!"
,interhooked,2010-03-29T17:37Z,"unfortunately after one month the license ends at windows 7 64-bit.
if you reapply zwt.bof it works for a while and you have to do it again
thanks anyway virus free"
,AyoubMuh,2010-03-30T21:32Z,Thanks alot.
,Enigma the downloader,2010-03-31T18:38Z,"Thx for the upload, Babylon 8 is great! However it says the license has expired and I can't use the .bof file again as interhooked says.

How do I get a new licence or get it to work again? Thanks again!"
,interhooked,2010-04-03T02:39Z,Now even and this cannot work i think only solution is system restore to an earlier point for me the only license that worked for a long time was the 7.0.2.3
,interhooked,2010-04-03T02:47Z,i forgot restore and then stop access with firewall i think 
,interhooked,2010-04-05T16:58Z,"in case that ZWT.bof doesn't work activate with this
Username: BetaMaster
License Code:P275WR5MGX6VBCQKBHCCME5GHQWDZ3U5"
,loadstone007,2010-04-12T17:08Z,"Thanks for the new license, interhooked! :)"
,geolabros,2010-04-14T14:03Z,"thanks a lot murlok
the new lisence worked just fine"
,loadstone007,2010-04-28T23:26Z,License doesn't work anymore.
,somedude.1001,2010-05-04T23:46Z,"License stopped working after 4 months. I blocked it using Firewall and host file but somehow it still expired. Fucking hell!

Someone should come up with a way to permanently cracking this, 1 release would be enough. The dictionary data can be updated individually."
,lipitoareinsetata,2010-06-13T10:27Z,Thank u Murlok & interhooked. I made a nice combination.
,fhc2,2010-08-31T01:52Z,Thank you very much.
,diar1,2010-10-07T07:35Z,"Hi, don't waste your time with babylon, there is an other program like babylon. lingoes, and its free"
,the_one_one,2010-11-04T16:02Z,Well Babylon is king but that Lingoe is not bad really and you're in the right side of the fence.  Thanks diar1
