,pedro0001,2010-02-06T23:47Z,Hi. I never used torrent so I'm with problems. I did the download and I enter the code and installed the game but when I click in the icon it asks for the CD or DVD. What should I do?
,blue_star,2010-02-14T17:38Z,"pedro,copy the hpgof(the duplicate icon) folder from the crack folder.go to properteis of the game and paste the folder in find target(in XP version).a message will display 'do you want to replace....'click yes. and you are done .if even now the game asks for the cd dvd,then something is wrong with you or your pc.   "
,xlilsergy,2010-02-17T17:16Z,"I know i may be a n00b but can someone write me how does it all work? I have the code, but i don't know which thing is right to install or whatever.. x_x i believe i am lost.. shame on me."
,blue_star,2010-02-17T19:08Z,"if you are ashamed and so very inexpirienced,you shouldn't be downloading these files"
,xlilsergy,2010-02-17T21:38Z,"It's not the first time i download a file like this. This time i just dont get it, i asked for help, not for pointless comments like that."
,blue_star,2010-02-18T03:08Z,"okay, so you asked for help! after downloading mount the ISO image on a virtual drive(i wonder if you know how to mount images).
then install the game and use the correct from crack folder.then copy the game icon from the crack folder and replace original icon in the game folder(c/:-EA games/:-hpgof).try this way.
--still i have a feeling you shouldn't be downloading these files."
,xlilsergy,2010-02-19T00:46Z,"Okay I got the point, i decompressed the file, but i think it didnt work well, because now I tried with 7 zip, and its alright, because with winzip i had like 278 elements, thats why i got lost, thanks!"
,King.Of.Pop58,2010-02-25T09:52Z,dose this game work and seed plz
,blue_star,2010-02-26T17:25Z,King.Of.Pop58. i know that you are now downloading some harry potter games. everywhere you post a comment -does this game work ? now let me ask you a question-does your mind work ? all these will games work if you have some simple knowledge about ISO image files(or just apply some common sense)  you are writing comments for the sake of writing. why do you post some junk unneccesarily. use your gray matter(if you have some) and do not be a muddlehead.
,dark_wizz,2010-02-28T21:57Z,"@blue_star i'm not afraid to recieve a comment, i had some problems with my tpb acc so i couldn't login. i'm glad u like it. i'm seeding this as long as my little bro likes HP xD :))"
,blue_star,2010-03-01T07:38Z,"Happy to hear from you after a long time,dark_wizz . What do you mean by your 'tbp acc' ?"
,dark_wizz,2010-03-01T18:56Z,TPB acc- The Piraty Bay account :)
,blue_star,2010-03-02T16:43Z,"I got it. But this harry potter game is certainly more difficult as compared to the previous harry potter games. The controls are a bit unfriendly.
Are you able to play this game well,dark_wizz ?"
,Bloddrake,2010-03-21T16:46Z,nice download speed on this one ^^ i'm up to 1.7Mb/s

,ears90,2011-07-19T06:51Z,"Brilliant upload, works perfectly. 
It's a shit port by the developers, to change the resolution, you must do a bit of hex editing. Check widescreengamingforum for a guide on how to do that."
,TRMxKNW,2011-08-22T23:30Z,"Thanks a lot, it works great!
Confirmed working on Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit.

The game-play is much different from 1-3, but overall its not too bad. I don't like how you can't customize controls or video options!"
,btd16,2011-10-07T19:32Z,cant find crack

,tockfrogs,2012-04-07T10:38Z,"Okey, I'm having some trouble. I've got it to work except that when I start the game it's just black.. No image.. Does anyone know what I've done wrong?"
,pfft16,2012-06-04T16:03Z,"1. Mount image (I used Daemon tools)
2. In autorun box, click open files
3. Open folder called ""Crack""
4. Click serial.exe
5. Choose Harry potter and the goblet of fire from drop down menu
6. Generate to get installation key
7. Click Autorun.exe
8. Follow instructions

unfortunately, you cannot receive ""rewards"" from the ea games thing cause the key has been used before. at least you'll get to play the game!"
,pfft16,2012-06-04T16:28Z,"Okay then I was stuck to a black window as well.

Open crack folder
Copy gof_f.exe into C:Program FilesElectronic ArtsHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
Worked for me!
gonna play now :)"
