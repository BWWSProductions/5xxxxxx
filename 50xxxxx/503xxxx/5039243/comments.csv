,shango,2009-08-04T00:18Z,You dont happen to have a film by Larry Clark called Ken Park? I cant find a full dvd of it anywhere and you cant even order it. Netflix and blockbuster dont really carry it and I had a friend ask me to try to get a copy. It sucks when you cant even legitimately find a copy of a movie.
