Would like to say my previous PB login & password stopped working for no good reason. 3 emails to PB admin & no response. I know they have a lot on their plate at the moment, still a pain the arse though!
I had posted some good PiL & pistols torrents with that login.

Would anyone out there who has the following gigs please post the torrent & leave a comment on this page telling me so? Ta :
