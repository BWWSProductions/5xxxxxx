if someone tells me how i`ll give it a bash
i use bitlord by the way"
,the_electro_head,2009-08-03T14:18Z,"Chizzer: Ta for posting your comment m8t. Haven't used bitlord, i use utorrent. Very simple to create torrents with it. Just a case of making directory with the files, then create torrent with the utorrent wizard (specify filepath to your directory) & then upload torrent to pb. Would be sweet if you could post those gigs."

Cheers, mate."
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-06-02T23:22Z,I was right... The quality of these recordings is absolutely atrocious. Not even remotely listenable in my personal opinion.
