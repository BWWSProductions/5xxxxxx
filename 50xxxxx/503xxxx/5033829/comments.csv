[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-06T12:11Z,"If you can read English then read the installation notes in Readme.txt file or this:

Installation notes:
***************

- Disconnect internet during installation, and/or make sure to NOT let the prog 
  connect to internet (block unwanted connections by using e.g. a firewall).

- After install copy the cracked files from the crack folder to the install dir.  

- Copy sysdat to (for example):
C:\Program Files\Tipard Studio\Tipard Video Converter\sys\soft\Tipard Video Converter\Profile 

- Copy all.dll to (for example):
C:\Program Files\Tipard Studio\Tipard Video Converter\dll


Done!


NOTE: 
- Block the program from accessing internet (with eg. a firewall)!
- Do NOT update the program!"
