Here's Metallica's first 5 albums, all in between 128 and 320 kbps.

In order:

Kill 'em All
Ride the Lightning
Master of Puppets
... And Justice for All
Metallica (The Black Album)

The lower quality ones are primarily the older ones so it's really not as noticeable as you'd expect.

I don't want to make you feel guilty, but every time you don't seed, God gives one of your relatives AIDS.

Enjoy.
