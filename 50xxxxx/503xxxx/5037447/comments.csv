,gatsu3,2009-10-22T23:08Z,"well, ty for the up, but, unfortunantely, i cant recommend this torrent. its like someone recorded all these songs while messing with the volume knob. u may need to re-up the torrent in a rar format, cuz none of the songs have a level volume. 
 ty for your effort"
,Chinja101,2009-11-03T04:23Z,"gatsu3, i apologize but i recently upgraded my computer so i do not have the originals to upload again, but they play fine in my itunes. I am a bit confused as to why there is that defect"
