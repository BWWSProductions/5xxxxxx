Some great tunes that i found in Singapore nearly 40 yrs ago, that have stood the test of time.

Use a pinkie slide for the steel guitar part in 'Good Time Charlie'. Three great audio versions of the song on the Bay. 

'Ventura Highway', also one of my acoustic favourites is on uTube. Have included 'Suite Judy Blue Eyes',as it shares the same tuning as '4+20'...tc
