,davkal2010,2009-07-30T23:58Z,u could upload this to a private site 1st and get some people to help u seed and stuff....come on this is ridiculous
,treefidty,2009-07-31T02:36Z,"Hey, I would really like to have this. You should definitely try uploading to a private site first to get some help from a few seeders, otherwise, this will never work with all the leechers. I'd gladly help and will definitely be seeding once this is done. I won't need it for another month when I finish p90x. Thanks for finding the files at least. Hopefully you can get the documents that go with it later too."
,davkal2010,2009-07-31T03:05Z,"yea maybe you should try iptorrents, or demonoid, or xtremespeeds net... it has free signup at the moment!! "
,leaker2,2009-07-31T13:53Z,"iptorrents, or demonoid, or xtremespeeds net are CLOSED for signup.

but i have donated for a VIP Access to iptorrents ... but cant login atm."

,skhonda,2009-07-31T16:48Z,"Leaker2, I love you man for this torrent. I have been waiting for this the moment i saw the ads. I will SEED this NON STOP!

If I could ask one more favor, could u upload the workout calendar? "
,roca250,2009-07-31T20:46Z,Can anyone help me rip these dvd's? I have the originals and tried 2 mac ripping software as well as about 4 pc software with no luck at all.
,julianne1998,2009-07-31T22:03Z,"I read this on another site:
the DVDs are protected by RipGuard from Macrovision. You need to disable autorun, because it automatically runs a program that hides in your system procesess (can't be closed via Windows Task Manager) that blocks de-protection programs like AnyDVD, DVDDecrypter. And then use a program like Magic DVD Ripper (I was able to rip it successfully with this program).

So according to them they where able to rip them in the above mentioned way."
,diatomicrazor,2009-07-31T22:54Z,"roca250 or leaker2 or anyone else who is gona rip and upload this program let me know if you need an invite to Demonoid or IPTorrents.

,murderfly,2009-08-02T20:49Z,i've seen one of the cardio videos. MAN! these exercises are fucking INTENSE! I think the calendar is a must if you don't want to inadvertently injure yourself (especially at the beginning). I have no intention to download this baby without the calender.
,dodedodedo22,2009-08-02T21:23Z,"yea i got the pure cardio vid ,i couldnt finish it because things were falling off of the shelves at my friends house but yea lol its a killer...cant wait to get to 4.7% some day(:"

,buddog05,2009-08-06T01:00Z,"The Insanity Dvd's have a newer Copy Right Protection on it, Ive tried 6 different rippers including: HandBrake, CloneDVD2, DVDRipper, Xilisoft, and so on,
I also have used DVD 43 along side with it, as well as tried AnyDVD separate from DVD43

All it does is stop after a little bit and fails when Im trying to rip each dvd, If anyone could help me figure out how to rip it then I can possibly get it posted as well.
Thanks"

,alienseer23,2009-08-08T22:38Z,"how to seed a huge load to hundreds of torrent users:

 use intelligent seeding, super seeding, or whatever else your client calls seeding out the entire file actively from beginning to end. this is not always possible. 

you can set your client to connect to  as few as people as possible (3 or 4), and unlimit your upload. This will reduce repeatedly sending out the same bits to hundreds of people, and put that load to three or four others. Makes sense, huh? 

You can help seed these huge loads by checking sources like h**file DOT com, and adding yourself to the seed pool. 

I heard someone on rap**find posted links."
,buddog05,2009-08-09T21:24Z,"yomanaj or anyone,

Im trying to rip the actual dvds and post the entire deluxe program, but when I rip the dvds, it seems to rip the seens out of order for some reason. Im guessing this once again is the copyright protection,

Ive shut off auto play and I use Magic DVD Ripper to burn them but what happens after I rip it is it will start off normal then it will jump to about 20 min in to the workout and then jump around from there. Am I doing something wrong? Once again, when I get the programs ripped I will post and seed thanks!"
,dodedodedo22,2009-08-10T20:17Z,i guess yall got everything under controll (: seed if ya can id rather not wait the week ityll take at 20k
