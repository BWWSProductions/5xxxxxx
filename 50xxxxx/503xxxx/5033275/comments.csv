Here's hoping the sound isn't just simply compressed and made louder for this re-issue...I'll report back.

I dunno, I always liked the Swan cover. That's deep stuff, man :) "
,naked_mugwump,2009-08-01T17:06Z,"Many thanks again--""I Sometimes Wish I was Dead"" is a great little track! 

As to the sound, vis a vis the original CD, it's much louder, and the dynamics are squashed.  

It's not my can of beans--I love having the drum track in ""Puppets"" viscerally whallop the ears, for example, like it does on the original CD. On the re-issue, the drums kind of meekly try to assert themselves over everything else in the mix, which is all kind of at the same volume, which drains the excitement out of it for me personally. 

But please don't take my word for it: you might like the compression--by squishing things, vocals really are brought out, and that's kind of a nice presentation. 

Did I mention ""I Wish I was Dead"" is cool?

Thanks again to the uploader!  "
