,Arfuuur,2009-08-02T01:56Z,Bricktop your rips are superb but will the other users you mentioned that are on demonoid ever bring their torrents to TPB? I don't know how else I would be able to get them. Also you should rip Snatch obviously :]
,gR1m_r1PPr,2009-08-02T06:13Z,hey bricktop i was wondering if u took requests for bluray/DD rips and i wanted to know if u could get FAST AND FURIOUS 2009 for us all...thanks anyway i love the ps3 format and size...

,bWg4lifeHD,2009-08-02T14:49Z,"might be old news but any1 intrested u can put these thru multiAVCHD (freeware) turn it into a AVCHD file (select the  AVCHD compatible player option) takes 5-10 mins,then put the BDMV file (inside the new AVCHD folder) into imgBURN (freeware) either burn direct to 4.7 dvd-r or create an image then burn (takes about 10 mins) then tey will play on  blu-ray players,PS3 or any AVCHD compatible system.with no quality loss.Although audio comes up as DD multi channel if thats different to 5.1? i dunno.You can also do this with the MP4 versions although it takes a little longer in multiAVCHD to convert."
,bWg4lifeHD,2009-08-02T15:26Z,"forgot the most important bit,in imgBURN go to options on the top right,select DATAtype MODE1/2048 , file system UDF , UDF Revision 2.50 or 2.60 then either burn to disc or create an image to burn to disc. "
,Arfuuur,2009-08-03T08:42Z,"Yes those users are good but Bricktop mentioned some only on Demonoid that have done Watchmen and other films he won't do. The quality should be like Bricktop's i.e. PS3 compatible and such without being over 4 gigs
Is there a good Watchmen torrent like this?"
