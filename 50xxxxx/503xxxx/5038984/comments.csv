,Sabre7349,2009-08-03T09:25Z,Anybody else getting strange redirects on TPB? Not just w/eztv but other dl links. Acts like spyware but none found and it only happens w/TPB

,SkoMedHull,2009-08-03T16:53Z,"Seed FFS. Check your ratios, if your ratio is under 1.0 get your vids elsewhere, you're nothing but an extra load and a pain in the ass for this tracker. "
,tabitha11,2009-08-03T17:47Z,Hi everyone this is my first comment. I am having trouble with Kaspersky not allowing me to download AVI files but MKV will complete. I get some message saying that it is being used by another process. Please help I do not boast any techno intelligence I just like to watch tv.
,Sirreal420,2009-08-03T18:23Z,"@tabitha11 whatever prog your using to dl, you need to remove the file from the cue, untill you do most pc's see the file being used by your dl prog, so just clear your lists, and try again"
,tabitha11,2009-08-03T19:20Z,"Do you mean take it off the list after it fails? If so, I have done so and tried to disable various parts of Kaspersky to see if it will allow and still no luck. The message vuze shows is Error: disk write error, open fails, file not found, (the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process).  This didn't start until switched from norton to Kaspersky and only affects avi not mkv."
,tabitha11,2009-08-03T19:31Z,It still happens after I delete the file I was tring to DL from the computer. Do you suggest another player besides Vuze? 
,petter_sundgren,2009-08-03T23:21Z,"thanks eztv!!!

:-)"
,petter_sundgren,2009-08-03T23:23Z,"@tabitha11,
i really do not know your problem but you could try for example utorrent instead. atleast i find it alot better than vuze.
cheers"
,RageWars,2009-08-03T23:59Z,"Hey, what do you guys seed to? I go 48 hours or a ratio of 5, whichever comes last."
