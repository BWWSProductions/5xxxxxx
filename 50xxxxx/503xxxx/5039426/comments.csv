,anvis9,2009-08-04T07:07Z,"37.78 Portable? the original is only 15MB

No Excuse - why 37.78 MB?"
[V],NoExcuses,2009-08-04T07:27Z,"@anvis9
Did you read the third line of the description?
The Portable itself is about 16 MB, but there is also the Setup program that weights about 21 MB in case you want to install it. Clicking on the Files number on the header shows you the list and size of the uploaded files."
,anvis9,2009-08-06T08:25Z,Thanks man
,sharebird,2009-08-19T01:02Z,"There is a discussion here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5052418/Total_Commander_7.50_RC1_Portable

that the Thinstall app used to generate these portable apps is infected... The apps themselves are scanning clean, but when they run they unpack a svchost.exe, usually as part of a file open dialog.  

We appreciate NoExcuses' efforts and don't want to undermine them, but right now all of his portable apps are suspect.

: (

Sorry mate, but you might want do do what fredpc did, download a different copy of thinstall.

Just wanted to spread the word, because this particular virus hides itself very well."
