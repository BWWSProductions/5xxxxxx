One of two known pro shots of the show that have been made - the other has a slightly different cast - but neither has every been released either in part or full. 
 This one was filmed in the theatre, in front of an audience, by multiple cameras - including cranes - and has the full, original London cast, including Kerry Ellis, who would go on to lead "Wicked" in London and on Broadway, and Nigel Planer, who was also in the original London "Wicked" cast, and is now in "Hairspray".
This is clearly from a VHS master, and contains permanent on screen time code. The two acts stored as separate titles on the disc with only automatied chapters. 
 There's some limited fluttering in the audio but other than that, picture and sound are near perfect.
