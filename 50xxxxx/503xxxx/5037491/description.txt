this is my music.   i've been inspired to play guitar ever since i heard joe satriani's record "dreaming #11" way back in 1989...   been a hardcore hendrix fan since starting up a trio band in 1998 and realizing the genius of his music.   and pink floyd, duh!   whoever isn't a fan of floyd needs their ass kicked!!

anyways, i'm really proud of these 8 tracks - they represent the best i have to offer and i hope people download them and send me an email sometime - i have my email address embedded into the properties of each file.   i'd rather have somebody send me a message saying "wow, that track was really kool" than make money off of any of these recordings by selling them commercially - so please, if you like what you hear, let me know, it's what i live for.   i went to music school, i've been to a thousand concerts, met a bunch of famous people, recorded a ton of music...   i have put in my time and paid my dues.

ty dennis (of the new doors band "riders on the storm") has given me his personal thumbs up on many of my tunes - in fact, he was going to record live drums on my version of 'the end', but it just didn't workout (so i went acapella instead, oh well).

download, seed, and please send comments.
