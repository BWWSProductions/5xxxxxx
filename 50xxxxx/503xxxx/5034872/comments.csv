Was wondering if you have any Dave Matthews Band collection ? 
I did not come accross any 320 kbps rip except for their new album - ""Big Whiskey And The GrooGrux King"" which I already have along with the ' Warehouse 5 volume8' compilation also at 320 kbps.
All other compilations and discographies are at 192 kbps or vbr.

Sorry to again put in a request so shamelessly after what u did for my MLTR request and all ur recent uploads ... if u come across any 320 Kbps link lemme know.

Enjoy ur weekend mate :)"

Only found 2 mp3 320kbs, I have downloaded Blazers torrents before and the user is a moderator on another site.
For the other torrents its better to source it as Flac. You can convert FLAC to MP3 320kbs using Media Monkey or what ever floats your boat [lol].

As you see i dont have any Dave Matthews, but i will keep a look out on my travels in the future.


Now to get back to seeding this turkey of a torrent.
