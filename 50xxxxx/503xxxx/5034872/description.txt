Kingsize - Five [2001]


Amazon.Co.Uk Review - Five's Third Album Kingsize Follows The Tried And Tested Recipe Which Succeeded So Well On Five And Invincible; Slamming R&B, Raunchy Rock Numbers, Fists-In-The Air Rap Tracks, Melodic Ballads And What's More, The Majority Of The Tracks Have Been Written By The Boys Themselves. Kicking Off With The Poppy First Single "Let's Dance" The Temperature Rises Further With "Rock The Party", Dips Part Way Through With The Smoochy "Feel The Love" But Then Climaxes Again In True Five Album Fashion With The Finale "C'mon C'mon". Kingsize Crackers Are "Closer To Me" A Swinging, Westlife-Style Ballad Which Is Destined To Become A Hit In Its Own Right And "Let's Get It On" A More Mid-Tempo Number. This Is Classic Five--No Major Surprises But Plenty To Please The Faithful.
