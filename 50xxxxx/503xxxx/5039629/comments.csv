All my family and my friends, and their friends uses your releases! 

Thankyou SO MUCH!"
,mizar,2009-08-03T17:01Z,"Thanks!
Win7 really needs a kick in the ass to be as good as XP or hopefully a little more better."
,Sven the swede,2009-08-03T17:18Z,"I noticed that a lot of crappy custom editions of Windows 7 have started to show up and started thinking ""why do they even bother?"" They just cut out a few things, some of them important, and then claim it is revolutionary and super fast. Hey, anyone could have done that in vLite. It is as silly as someone taking out the calculator and claim that is going to make the OS faster. Now this on the other hand... eXPer1ence knows what he is doing. On the other hand, if you don't know what you are doing, well then this is probably not for you. Does this sound like you? ""Hey?? HELP!! Where did my Help and Support go?? I can't connect to the freaking Internet!"" 

On another topic, I would want to ask if any x64 edition is coming? After all, it is not like comparing the x86 and x64 edition of Windows XP. I think porting this to x64 architecture should not be too time consuming. You used to list in your previous releases what have been removed, not what have been kept, and I would just like to point out that perhaps it was better like you did before? After all, more things have been kept than removed. 

Anyway, this seems like a great release but I don't know why everyone seems mostly interested in the x86 edition of Windows 7. Even computers that are a few years old have most likely x64 processors, unless they are socket 774 processors from Intel. The x86 architecture is really, really old stuff and that version is just developed by Microsoft for compatibility with old software, drivers, licenses and all that stuff which mostly only companies have to think about. One could compare the x86 architecture and x64 architecture with having onboard graphics and having a modern PCI Express video card. "
[T],eXPer1ence,2009-08-03T17:54Z,"1 - The complete NFO with everything thats removed is on the ISO but it just wouldn't all for here thats all. Demonoid (am I allowed to say that here lol) has the complete NFO on it.

2 - Its x86 purely because I wanted it to fit on a CD.

Fitting x64 on a CD won't be possible but by that time maybe it coud be this x86 one and x64 as a dual booting DVD. I can only guess it will not be huge because a lot of the files in x86 are also in x64.

,bouboubou,2009-08-04T12:59Z,"experience, can you please answer my questions?"
[T],eXPer1ence,2009-08-04T13:24Z,"bouboubou:

1 - The two hidden system files ""desktop.ini"" that are normally there are deleted, not hidden.

2 - Not sure about Windows 7 not having a 10 connection limit, but since we know MS do this and love to annoy everyone, its logical to assume they have done it again on Windows 7. When you run the TCPIP patcher (you can open that automatic patcher with WinRAR and drag out the actual patcher itself Tcpipx86.exe) it shows up saying the limit is 10. Patch the file and reboot and it says the limit is 255. Although I have not done any actual tests, it is sure as hell allowing more than ten connections!

Because my uTorrent gets up to 1.9Mb/s download speeds in Windows 7 and in XP that was just not possible.

Anyone with any driver issues - just go to WINDOWS UPDATE yes Windows Update, Microsoft has got its shit together.

Last night though I swapped Wireless cards (got slight lag in BF2 on my old card) and I had to get the driver's setup.exe and put that on XP SP3 compatibility, then the driver installed, then WU had a tiny driver update, honestly it has not lagged one little bit since! I guess its hit and miss with that BUT the one I took out was a ÂŁ8.50 card with no name (TP-Link, exactly!) but I put in a Belkin card and voila, no lag, not that it was bad before its just that in BF2 unless its running 100% smooth you'll just get shot.

Lets just see how long it stays activated. :D
"
,bouboubou,2009-08-04T13:32Z,"You simply deleted the files... LMFAO! How come I didn't think about that possibility!

,n2345678,2010-08-10T19:40Z,"@eXperience or someone
Can you help me? This is my first post.  This ISO isn't working for me in my attempt at multiboot setup, however the another full Windows 7 torrent did work in the same partition. I'd rather use a tiny one, if you can help me figure out how.

I used MBRtool to hide and in-activate my XP partition, then I used GParted to shrink the XP partition and create a new partition after this, then I installed Windows7 there. At first it rebooted fine and took about 5 or 10 minutes to activate (?), but then it finally said it was going to reboot in less than a minute. So I thought it's okay. Then Windows7 won't boot. It just gives me a black with a white text error message, saying 
""Windows failed to start..."" ""To fix the problem use repair on the Windows CD"" (I see no such option). ""Status: 0xc0000000F"". 

I'll keep reading what the internet says about 0xc0000000F, but in the mean time I was hoping you or someone can point me in the right direction. AGAIN, another full windows7 installation WORKED installed in the same partition.... I just rather used this a tiny version if possible. So I'm thinking you ripped out something critical for my setup, but I wouldn't have a clue where to begin looking for what exactly to plug back in. If that's even the problem.

Unless, the the two Windows intermingled boot files, in which case I don't understand why. They didn't before. As I understand it, I think hiding and in-activating the XP partition was enough to stop the Windows7 installation from mixing up files. So I still think something critical is missing.

I hope you're familiar with MBRtool. You seem pretty knowledgable; it's pretty simple software I found, I'd like to keep using it for now b/c of it's versatility and simplicity.

Just for the record: I started with a blank hard disk, added XP, then did the above. Pretty straightforward. No other monkey business. And I have backups and some time. Just saying it's easy for me to try something.

So yeah... That's my problem... No Windows7 when that partition is activated and unhidden. Just Windows XP when it's activated and unhidden.

I've been reading and experimenting all week with multiboot; learning about backing up MBRs and deactivating and hiding partitions while installing other OSs -- but I'm still new to all this multibooting stuff.  I backup, I'm just lost what's next. Was hoping to finish this soon so I could move on to other projects.  I'll read all the comments eventually.

After this problem is solved, (where I have XP and Windows7 side by side selectable with MBRtool), then I'll be adding one more OS, then the tripleboot setup will be done. I'll add Ubuntu, and I hope it's default Grub installation will autodetect and auto hide and auto activate only one of the three final OSs at a time.  Then I plan to stop playing with MBRtool.  Then I can finally put this issue to rest, and finally enjoy a nice tripleboot setup."

I tried to install, but it failed since Windows Media Player is not available on this version. Skipped it and continued to try and find another media player. Ignored that, and continued on. I downloaded and installed Photoshop, Vegas Pro (with errors, not install-stopping though) and tested it. Worked. Obviously, my internet was working, but I tried to set myself outside of the modem for a direct connection to Qwest and it failed, saying ""The service 'Remote Access Connection Manager' could not be started soon enough."" I tried to load up Services.msc and got the following error, ""One or more ActiveX controls could not be displayed..."" so none of the services would show, therefore I couldn't start the correct service.

,rsobhee,2012-07-21T15:57Z,"I have a Dell N5010 core i 5 64 bit. I was growing frustrated with how slow and how unresponsive the machine would invariably become whether it is some surfing or actual work on autocad. The machine is always like doing something else instead of what I am doing. In desperation I went ahead with taking off the original windows..because like Adobe etc..I know how they like to stuff a load of garbage which no one needs... to put Tiny7. I formatted the original partition and made aďťż fresh install of Tiny7. And got the autocad software installed, a 32 bit. When this worked I was glad. Tiny7 boots in less than 30 secs and shuts down in 8 seconds. Thumbs up from me. Surprisingly I did not have to install any drivers too ..it seemed to be working fine..although I still installed some chipset drivers etc.."
