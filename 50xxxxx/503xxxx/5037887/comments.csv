I have a whoel set of Vinyl George Szell with Cleveand Orchestra of Beethoven's , but later I bought the same set on CD.

Will compare the two."

These are his later studio recordings made with the Vienna Philharmonic in the early 1950s for EMI records. Only three are live recordings - 2, 8 and 9. The 8th is with the Stockholm Philharmonic. The 9th is the famous version made in 1951 with the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Otto Edelman. Although good in their own right, they do not quite match the best of Furtwangler's wartime recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic. The sound is in mono and is rather poor, especially after being squashed into MP3 format. There is also a lossless version of this same set available online with marginally better sound quality."
