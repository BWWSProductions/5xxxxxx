Jason Cranford Teague, "Speaking in Styles: Fundamentals of CSS for Web Designers"
New Riders Press | 2009 | ISBN: 0321574168 | 360 pages | PDF 

Speaking in Styles targets Web designers, aiming to help them learn the â€œlanguageâ€ that will be used to take their vision from the static comp to the live Internet. Many designers think that CSS is code, and that itâ€™s too hard to learn. Jason takes an approach to CSS that breaks it down around common design tasks and helps the reader learn that they already think in stylesâ€“they just need to learn to speak the language.

Jason helps Web designers find their voice, walks them through the grammar of CSS, shows them how to write their design specs in CSS, and how to prepare it for screen, printer or handheld devices. Along the way designers will learn to optimize their code, make it accessible, optimize for search engines, mix it up with Flash, and more.
