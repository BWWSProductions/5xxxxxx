Queen were one of dozens of acts to perform at Live Aid. Their performance has been lauded by many critics and voted in numerous polls as being (at least) one the greatest concert performances of all time. No need to elaborate on the event as a whole, as it has been very well-documented. 

Each band was permitted precisely 17 minutes on stage, and Queen's basic philosophy was to cram as many hits into that small time frame as possible. It was Freddie Mercury's finest hour, as the surpreme showman connected with 80,000 people in Wembley Stadium (having them sing and clap along to their anthems) and hundreds of millions at home on television. Combined with the energy of the show, his voice was in phenomenal shape, hitting all the high notes. 

Later in the evening, Freddie and Brian returned to the stage to perform an emotional rendition of Is This The World We Created, which fit perfectly with the vibe and message of the day.
