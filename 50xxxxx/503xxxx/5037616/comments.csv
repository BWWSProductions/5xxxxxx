,shokan85,2009-08-05T03:55Z,Where can I find an anaglyph film? Thanks Very MUCH for this. I'm going to give it a try.

http://thepiratebay.org/search/3d%20anaglyph/0/99/200

One torrent says to use StereoPlayer by Peter Wimmer. Is this the same as your torrent? 

Also, can you recommend a particular brand of shutter glasses?"
,enrolao84,2009-08-05T14:03Z,"You say: ""This new version is capable of converting anaglyph 3d films into Field Sequential on the fly""

How? What proccess?.I find into the program and don't see how make it. Web also don't say nothing over this. This would be a very good characteristic.

Thanks."

,brunohll,2010-04-11T20:18Z,Thanks for the keys. It worked with my v1.5.5 I had installed and got from the website. Just enter any name etc. 
,djmachismo,2010-05-14T08:51Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD came up as a virus on Norton 2010 - Major Damage - Kris812 I expect good stuff from you man...
,kris812,2010-10-01T21:22Z,"I don't remember getting any viruses with this but I may be mistaken. I don't think I ever used the KEYGEN so it is possible that there is one in there.. If major damage was done then your anti-virus program isn't doing it's job.

On another note from what I read in the ""purchase information"", this program could also input analgraph and output stereoscopic. It however does NOT allow you to convert video formats..

I am using shutter glasses from ulimate 3d heaven called the terminator style (about 35USD ea) on a 61"" samsung DLP with a totally fucking over kill computer (q9550 oc 4+ghz with 2xGTS250's) and play video games in full 1080p using IZ3D drivers (works on ever game).. 

I have to say that using the stereoscopic player in this download is the best for veiwing movies and IZ3D drivers are the best for video gaming.. Sorry I havn't posted in a while as I have been very busy. "
,raaz2023,2010-12-04T16:43Z,Keys are Really Helpful. It working. Thanx 0rangeq

,BrainGrenade,2011-04-21T05:49Z,The Keys posted work on the latest version on the Stereoscopic player website. I just downloaded the official trial version 1.7 and the key I used registered it just fine.
,alexander703806,2011-05-16T21:25Z,Really thanks man That's what I was looking for!
,pystdante,2011-05-19T05:55Z,"@djmachismo Norton is a piece of fucking shit, I think it picks shit at random cause its a shitty product, use avast.

@kris Thanks for sharing, I will let you know if it works with my Viewsonic 3d projector"
,RVGirlAlice,2011-07-16T23:05Z,what settings do u use in Stereoscopic Player make t work with nVIDIA 3d vision and have single 3d image on the screen
,nireshis,2011-07-24T13:58Z,i have upgrade to the 1.7 version and it is still registered..
,mvbkumar,2011-08-08T10:35Z,"key not worked.
player run foe 5 minutes only. "
,chicalleje,2011-08-22T18:26Z,Thanks! Works great! (Gracias! Funciona muy bien!)
,mvbkumar,2011-09-03T16:40Z,NO KEY WORKS. Play for about 7 minuts
,wanda_5,2011-10-02T16:07Z,I have this problem too with registering it. I am using 1.7 which accepts the license key but it still stops playing after a few minutes. The program itself works fine (using nVIDIA 3D Vision).
,TailsSWE,2011-12-10T17:01Z,"It working really great and it just took some secs with the keygen!
First install the the player. Mine player was already installed from their site.
Then you go into the ""Crack.rar"" Then you se some files inside there. Double click ""kg.exe"" and maybe sametime you have the player on. That was i had. Press ""Generate"" on the keygen thing and there is your key. As i did is open the player and go into ""Help"" and then ""Type product key"" ( i have it on swedish so tried to translate it as it may sais on english...). Copy your key from the Keygen and paste it on the textbubble by the Player's key thing, also type a name and work, as i did was just ""asd"" and ""asd"" on the name and work. Then ""next"" or ""continue"" and there you go! Hopely."
,TailsSWE,2011-12-10T17:30Z,"Oh i notice it now. People are right. When you have register the player and playing a movie about some mins, it will stop the movie and and tell us to register ti product while it already was. So that's a problem. :P"
,beergeek,2011-12-24T03:29Z,"This keygen DOES work, but only on the version 1.4.2 included in the torrent.  Later versions will appear to accept the key, but after about 6 and a half minutes will produce the annoying popup.

There is no virus in either the installer or keygen.  If you get a message, change your AV or mark it as a false positive.

In addition to trying the keygen directly with a newer version, I also tried upgrading the successfully reged 1.4.2 by installing a newer one on top of it, still fails.  Apparently, they have somehow blacklisted the keygen's algorithm."
,antoniojose1135,2012-02-24T09:45Z,No matter how many times i generate a code it says the key is invalid. does anyone have a valid license key?
,pyratesam,2012-03-02T20:37Z,"Yes it does contains 2 trogen virus. It never going to get registered. I found this which is much more easy and doesnt need any key or crack.

,Dude1217,2012-03-20T14:50Z,First off it will not register at all regardless of what key I use. Second off the zip file has a trojan virus and the crack/keygen file is a trojan also. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Unless you like viruses
