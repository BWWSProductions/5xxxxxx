I finally fucking found this shit and finally registered just to share this golden finding.. Yes it really fucking works too.. No bull shit found with NAV09.. yet.. But fuck it, it worked to get a key.. It's my first upload so don't rag on my uploading abilities.. This software is for viewing 3D movies on your PC.. 

It requires "LCD shutter glasses" and if you don't know what that means, YOU DON'T NEED THIS FOR ANYTHING.. This new version is capable of converting anaglyph 3d films into Field Sequential on the fly.. The guy who made this program is a GOD because I've looked into converting 3D films to Field Sequential and its a real fucking pain in the ass and this software does it on the fly.. If you like this software of course you should support his efforts and buy it or kick him some paypal.. 3dtv.com is where you can pay for it.. Sorry dude for sharing, think of this is as free advertizing for you :-/ 

I tested the keygen to stop the 5 min demo crap and it shows registered.. Let me know what you guys think by leaving some feedback.. 

Works on my Q8400, EVGA790i, 4GB DDR3, 8800GTS, WINXP, SAMSUNG 61" 1080p 3D-DLP
And some POS Dell GX270 machine with a 6200 low profile Nvidia card 
Both with needed DVI to HDMI cables..

Thanks! And your welcome if you've been looking for this shit too...
