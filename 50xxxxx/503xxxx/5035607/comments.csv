,bobbyphoto2,2009-08-01T16:42Z,"Traavis, Thank you for keeping up with this.  I hope there is a patch or whatever for the latest edition of Helicon Focus for Mac in this version."
,bobbyphoto2,2009-08-01T16:51Z,Oops--looks like Helicon Focus still only does versions 3.5 to 4.01.  Any suggestions as to where I can download one of these versions that you have in the KCNcrew Pack?  Every site I could find on the internet only did the latest Mac version.  Thank you for looking at this.
