Can't believe no-ones uploaded this classic yet so i will! seed on

Don't dis the quality till you've seen it, you wont be disappointed

Encoded in AVC (h.264) meaning better quality/smaller file size. So you may not be able to play it straight on older DivX players... 
I have quite a slow upspeed also so it may take a bit for the first seeders...

Use VLC, NeroShowTime or Quicktime etc to play
Use ConvertXtoDVD to do that
