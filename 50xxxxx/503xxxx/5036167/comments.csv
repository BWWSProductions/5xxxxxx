,dkporn,2009-12-31T00:16Z,"This is missing track 5, and you've got the wrong name for your track 7 (which should be track 8).

Amazon and Wikipedia both list 10 tracks and the same names.

1. Lisztomania
2. 1901
3. Fences
4. Love Like a Sunset Part I
5. Love Like a Sunset Part II (missing)
6. Lasso
7. Rome
8. Countdown
9. Girlfriend
10. Armistice"

,DONPRRN,2011-12-29T04:50Z,"these two tracks are mixed together

4. Love Like a Sunset Part I
5. Love Like a Sunset Part II

also it seems like a transcode if you look at the file size and the extra silence that 1901 has on the start and end. "
