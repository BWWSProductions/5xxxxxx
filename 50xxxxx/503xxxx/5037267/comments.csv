,ibutton77,2009-09-06T21:25Z,"Yes: We appear to be lacking seeders.
Bloodmalik, could you please reseed? You have dozens of folk swarming. We are 3 GB short of complete, so 3GB is all you'd need to upload. The swarm would take care of the rest."

,dork5002002,2010-06-14T05:07Z,This isn't complete is it?  Anyone know where to find the rest?
