NOTES
___________________
Please be patient with the seeding, I am looking into getting greater upload bandwidth.

If I am initial seeding, I won't appear as a seeder, but as a peer. So don't worry if 
you can't see any seeds! This allows me to get the film to you QUICKER, as well as more
discreetly.
___________________
This is a PURE DivX release including embedded DivX subs where applicable -
For best results, it is strongly recommended to view using the DivX player,
which will also burn a DVD that will play on Home Theater certified DVD players.

__________________
The primary audio on my MiniDVDs is a direct AC3 pass-thru of the Original DVD audio.
Please don't ask me to change this. Instead - If you are experiencing excessively
low volumes on the PC, that's because the dynamic range of PC audio output is much less
than for a DVD. Rather than me hacking the audio, I would recommend you download and install
AC3Filter by Alexander Vigovsky:

This is an EXCELLENT codec with a settable gain, to boost the volume
and also gives excellent surround-sound even with 2 speakers (try it with headphones!)
I have it set to play ALL my audio. Thanks, Alex!

If that doesn't work, you could always complain to the film studios! lol
