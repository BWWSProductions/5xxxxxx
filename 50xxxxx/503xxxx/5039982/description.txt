A collection of clips from four excellent, hard-to-find DVDs, depicting music in various natural settings in four different countries.

1. Among the Tuareg of Libya (Sublime Frequencies)
2. Niger: Magic and Ecstasy in the Sahel (Sublime Frequencies)
3. Nat Pwe: Burma's Carnival of Spirit Soul (Sublime Frequencies)
4. Drums and Djembes of Burkina Faso (Playasound)

These are portions of the DVDs, not complete DVD rips. But the chapters that are included are included in their entirety, without cuts.

It's a rather random collection, the only theme is that the music is good, and the backdrops are intriguing.
