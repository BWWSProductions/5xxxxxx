Happy to see that Your attention is again bent this way. Your taste is wery close to mine, so I'm keeping an eye on Your uploads.
I just had a HD buernt out, with more than 300 GB of Your stuff. Now, I'll have to start over again, but that's ok - where else to get all this stuff?
You have a sober and quiet way of going about this and a sober and sweet langauage.
Thank You for keeping all this alive, for our benefit.
Regards from Denmark"
