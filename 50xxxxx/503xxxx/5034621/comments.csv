Well actually I am taking a programming course in high-school right now and we're learning REALBasic as well as later on in the semester I think it was Adobe Flash. Then the 2nd level of programming is Coaco but I've never heard of that before.

Btw, great upload! :D I'm gunna check your other e-books. xD"

Well if you have little programming experience then AppleScript probably isn't a good place to start, not because it's difficult but because it is very different from other programming languages and cannot be used to create real programs (only automation scripts), so learning it will not help you learn other, more useful, programming languages.

The main programming language used for Mac OS X software is Objective-C. It is based on C (as are many other programming languages), so learning C will probably help you.

However, since you have already been taught the basics of programming with REALBasic, and maybe also some Object-Orientated Programming then you may be able to start learning Objective-C straight away.

Anyway two books that I would advise you to read are ""Learn C on the Mac"" and ""Learn Objective-C on the Mac"", you can download them here:

Hope this helps out, and good luck!"
