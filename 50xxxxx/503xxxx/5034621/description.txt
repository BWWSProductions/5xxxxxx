##### Official Book Description #####

This is the second edition of Hanaan Rosenthals critically-acclaimed AppleScript book. It goes the extra mile to teach you AppleScriptexplaining advanced topics without leaving you behind.

AppleScript is the high-level scripting language that resides on the Mac platform. It can be used to add functionality to the Mac operating system, automate tasks, add functions, and generally make things easier. AppleScript has always been very useful, and with Mac OS X, you can take AppleScript further than before.

This book begins with the basics like handling variables, loops, and commands. Then it proceeds with more advanced concepts like debugging, AppleScripting with databases, manipulating PDFs with SMILE, and automating media workflow. In a nutshell, this book:

    * Takes you on a journey from novice to professional AppleScripter.
    * Is completely comprehensive; nothing is left to the imagination.
    * Is up-to-date through AppleScript 1.10/Mac OS X Tiger.

If you are a Mac user who wants to know the real meaning of having full control over your machine, get into AppleScripting. And pick up this book because it really is the only guide you need to master the art of AppleScripting!



##### Notes #####

This is an eBook version of AppleScript: The Comprehensive Guide, it is fully OCR'ed (meaning all of the text can be copied and searched), the pages have been properly numbered to match those of the print edition and bookmarks have been put at the start of chapters for easy reference.

This book is good for programmers and non-programmers alike who want to learn AppleScript to create small applications ("applets") that automate tedious tasks such as renaming files or editing documents in batch.

I have also uploaded various other books on programming on Mac OS X, check my uploads if you are interested in this subject.
