I'm running it on Vista Ultimate and have a friend who's running it on Vista Ultimate, and I also have a friend who's running it on XP Media Center Edition.  

Did you close any open AV programs (especially an older Kaspersky) before installing?"

,Bebana,2009-09-05T20:57Z,"Does anyone have the ACTIVATION CODE for KAV? 
Because, without it I can not go to the part ""activate using existing key""...
It is 20 digits code, that comes in 4 blocks of five, separated by a hyphen. 
I found one activation code for KIS, but can't find any for KAV and that is what I need.
Help... anyone... PLS... "
