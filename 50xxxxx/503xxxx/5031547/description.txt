This is the latest version (as of end of July) of Kaspersky's new (yet to be released) 2010 Anti-Virus program.

Instructions on how to activate Kaspersky 2010 are included with ChattChitto's key files.

I am in no way associated with ChattChitto, and do not in any way claim his work as my own.  I am simply uploading the newest version of KAV to TPB, since all I can find are the slightly older 9.0.0.459, or the Internet Security version.  

-------------------------

If you claim there is a virus in this, YOU NEED A BETTER ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM.  This is direct from Kaspersky Labs, its 100% clean.  AVG sucks, can't stress that enough.  Freebies are not good AV programs.
