Nick Lovell is a Australian pop-rock musician and singer. Imaginary Boy is

musicianship and traverses his style of up-tempo rock, as well as his
provoking, soulful ballads. A sincere, soulful and passionate artist and
performer, his music has been compared to artists like Leonard Cohen, and
Jeff Buckley and provides listeners with a musical expression that is
thoughtful, unmistakably real and straight from the soul.
