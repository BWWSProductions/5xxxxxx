This torrent contains both the Audio CD in its remastered stereo form, as 
released in 2006, plus a short video, which tells the story of DM during the 
era.  

The video is presented in XviD with .mp3 sound.  There are spanish and english 
subtitles already ripped and a subpack which also includes subs in Deutsch, 
FranÃ§ais and Italiano.  You have to rip it yourself (I currently use SubRip on 
Windows), in order to use them.

Note: There's no 5.1 audio here.  I repeat: there's no 5.1 audio here.  Only the 
2.0 stereo album remastered.  And sounds great!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Ned Raggett

The peak of the band's industrial-gone-mainstream fusion, and still one of the 
best electronic music albums yet recorded, Some Great Reward still sounds great, 
with the band's ever-evolving musical and production skills matching even more 
ambitious songwriting from Martin Gore. "People Are People" appears here, but 
finds itself outclassed by some of Depeche Mode's undisputed classics, most 
especially the moody, beautiful "Somebody," a Gore-sung piano ballad that mixes 
its wit and emotion skillfully; "Master and Servant," an amped-up, slamming 
dance track that conflates sexual and economic politics to sharp effect; and the 
closing "Blasphemous Rumors," a slow-building anthemic number supporting one of 
Gore's most cynical lyrics, addressing a suicidal teen who finds God only to die 
soon afterward. Even lesser-known tracks like the low-key pulse of "Lie to Me" 
and the weirdly dreamy "It Doesn't Matter" showcase an increasingly confident 
band. Alan Wilder's arrangements veer from the big to the stripped down, but 
always with just the right touch, such as the crowd samples bubbling beneath 
"Somebody" or the call/response a cappella start to "Master and Servant." With 
Reward, David Gahan's singing style found the mÃ©tier it was going to stick with 
for the next ten years, and while it's never gone down well with some ears, it 
still has a compelling edge to it that suits the material well.

                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some Great Reward is the fourth album by the British electronic group Depeche 
Mode, released in 1984. The album peaked at #5 in the UK and at #54 in the US. 
The title comes from a phrase used near the end of track 2, Lie to Me ("Make me 
think by the end of the day, some great reward will be coming my way").

In 2006, Some Great Reward was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was 
remastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus 
DVD includes the two B-side tracks "In Your Memory" and "Set Me Free (Remotivate 
Me)" in addition to "Somebody (Remix)" and several live versions of some of the 
songs from the album. The DVD also includes a documentary on the making of the 
album.

The remastered album was released on "deluxe" vinyl in March 2007.

                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE     	by Stewart Mason

Originally released as a stand-alone single in the U.K. in April 1984, "People 
Are People" ended up becoming Depeche Mode's U.S. breakthrough hit, getting 
enough MTV and club airplay that Sire Records ended up gathering a number of 
stray single tracks and remixes and releasing the stopgap People Are People LP 
in the States. (This made U.S. consumers feel slightly cheated a few months 
later when "People Are People" showed up yet again on the Some Great Reward 
album.) It's ironic that this is the song that broke the group in the States as 
opposed to a poppier slice of synth pop like "See You," because "People Are 
People" was the single that introduced Depeche Mode's next-level sound as the 
group that made industrial music (Ã  la Einsturzende Neubauten or Test Dept.) 
palatable to the masses: the song features samples of clanging pipes, shattering 
glass, and other sounds recorded by the group and engineer Gareth Jones at a 
German junkyard during the sessions for Construction Time Again, manipulated 
into a deliberately choppy rhythm that emphasizes the beat to a considerably 
larger extent than Depeche Mode's earlier singles. (The overall effect is oddly 
similar to the contemporaneous singles by the Art of Noise, particularly since 
"People Are People" also makes use of a Trevor Horn trademark, the Fairlight 
orchestral stab.) Over this, the group repeatedly chants a sloganeering chorus, 
in between which Dave Gahan sings a well-intentioned but unfortunately trite set 
of lyrics about hatred and other bad vibes. Lyrically and musically, the song's 
saving grace is a refrain sung by songwriter Martin Gore, whose lightweight 
voice suits the lyrics' questioning tone better than Gahan's more strident 
delivery. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOMEBODY     by Stewart Mason

Although "Somebody" is one of Depeche Mode's most atypical songs, it's an all-
time fan favorite, remaining a key point of the group's live sets for the rest 
of its career. One of the few Depeche Mode songs sung by primary songwriter 
Martin Gore, "Somebody" is in fact basically a solo performance for the keyboard 
player, who sings the almost embarrassingly abject lyrics in a thin, weedy voice 
that makes plain why he's not the band's primary singer. Cleverly, however, Gore 
has his cake and eats it by turning himself (and the song as a whole) into a 
joke at the end of both verses, by inserting some self-protective sarcasm into 
lines like "Though things like this make me sick/In a case like this, I'll get 
away with it." It's only because of that level of self-awareness that he does; 
without it, "Somebody" would make anyone past the age of 15 gag.

MASTER AND SERVANT     	by Ned Raggett

Right from the start, with its call-and-response vocals between Martin Gore and 
David Gahan ("It's a lot -- it's a lot -- it's a lot -- like life!"), "Master 
and Servant" shows Depeche plunging even more deeply into its self-created image 
of sexual/social renegades. Keep in mind that this is the same band that scored 
big with "Just Can't Get Enough" three years earlier -- and that it not only 
kept a pop audience with this song, but the single went number six in the band's 
homeland. The gentle distortion on the harmony vocals, the crunches and synth 
melodies, created via sampling as much metallic banging as the group could 
manage, Gahan's echoed delivery of the often downright sadistic lyrics, and more 
all contribute to this being one of the more unlikely hit numbers around. That 
Trent Reznor, to name one of many people, listened to this on a regular basis 
when young is perfectly clear as the shuddering, massive beats punch the song 
along. As always, Depeche know how to sugar the pill just enough, as with the 
quick synth shimmer that concludes the second verses, but as long as one can 
hear the screams and screeches littered throughout the mix, simple and sweet boy 
band pop this isn't.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
