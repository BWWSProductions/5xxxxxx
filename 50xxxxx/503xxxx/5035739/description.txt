I believe this recording has not been made in digital format, 
so I converted the cassette recording to MP3. Limitations of
the source material are evident. 
I seems to be currently out of print (no record of it at BOT).
I have tried to remain as faithful to the source material as
possible, including, for example, "End of side one," and the
(now amusing) intro cassette instructions.

From (library) audio cassette (Nakamichi Dragon, Dolby NR was
NOT used) to CD (Pioneer PDR-555RW) to MP3 (iTunes 8).

MP3s post-processed with Audacity to combine or split tracks,
and to reduce hiss. Tracks about every 10 minutes, and at chapters
and tape sides. ID3 tagged.

PDF, RTF & TXT of the book included - ebook, ESL and reference friendly.
Cover scan included.

I have posted other Nevil Shute audiobooks to date:
A Town Like Alice, Round The Bend, Trustee from the Toolroom, Ruined City

Thanks for sharing & caring.
Cheers, FerraBit

  From Wiki:

The story concerns an elderly Englishman, John Sidney Howard, who goes on a fishing holiday in France after the Second World War breaks out, but before the fall of France. Entrusted with the care of two British children, and overtaken by events, he attempts to return to England and safety. His journey is hampered by the unexpected speed of the Nazi invasion of France, and by the fact that he continually finds himself entrusted with the custody of more and more young children. Eventually, he is stranded in Nazi occupied France and he is fully aware that, as an Englishman, he is an enemy to the occupying forces.

Technical notes:

Post processing with Audacity 1.3.7.
Tracks first normalized, to -0.5 dB.
"Noise Removal" effect, generating "Noise profile" on blank spots,
(specifying what we want filtered) then conservative settings to 
choose how much of that noise we want filtered. Preserving voice
integrity more important than noise removal.
 -  Noise reduction:  7dB
 -  Frequency smoothing: 180Hz
 -  Attack/decay time: 0.17 secs
Then exported with Lame 3.98 encoder, still at 80kbps mono.
