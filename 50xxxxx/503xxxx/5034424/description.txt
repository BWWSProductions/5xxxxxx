Plot:
The tragic loss of their unborn child has devastated Kate and John, taking a toll 
on both their marriage and Kate's fragile psyche as she is plagued by nightmares and 
haunted by demons from her past. Struggling to regain some semblance of normalcy in 
their lives, the couple decides to adopt a child. At the local orphanage, both John 
and Kate find themselves strangely drawn to a young girl named Esther. Almost as soon 
as they welcome Esther into their home, however, an alarming series of events begins to unfold.
