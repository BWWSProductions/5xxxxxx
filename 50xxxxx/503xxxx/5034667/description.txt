PDFs of each article from the LDS Ensigns 1971-2000

Once again they are in zip format.  TPB won't take torrents with too many files and since this one has over 10000 pdf I had to zip each year down.



I'm going to release the New Era 1971-2008 soon (mp3 audio for the later ones)



oh and thanks to all who have help me seed the torrents I have released.  It helps me out when I want to seed out the new ones quicker.
