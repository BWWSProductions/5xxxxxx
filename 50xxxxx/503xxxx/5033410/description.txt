pLOT:

This is a collection of propaganda films created by an Institute from the right, Instituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Sociais (IPÃŠS), before the coup d'etat that took the brazillian president JoÃ£o Goulart from the power in 1964.
The goal of those propaganda films was to desestabilize the government of JoÃ£o Goulart putting the public opinion against him and calling him a communist that would end freedom in Brazil. The IPÃŠS contributed a lot to the coup d'etat that ended democracy on Brazil for 21 years (1964-1985), the brazillian civil-militar dictatorship.
