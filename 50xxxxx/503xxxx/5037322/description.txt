REMEMBER THE NAME

This episode starts off with the "Guess The Testicles" game where the crew including George Takei try to pick out the sacks of Richard, Sal, and Benjy.  Funniest part is when George says, "Let me put on my reading glasses" so he can see the nuts up close haha.

Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen stop by to promote their new movie "Funny People".  They discuss the "Entourage" episode where the crew insults Seth by saying he's an ugly fat guy who only gets laid because he's funny.  Judd and Seth say "Fuck You Entourage".  Classic.  This was a VERY good interview.  Seth stays for the "Wheel Of Sex" which ends up failing because the dumb whores won't play the game!  Fun stuff.
