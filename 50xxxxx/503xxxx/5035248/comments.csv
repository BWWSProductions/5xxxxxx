,EnTek,2009-08-15T08:34Z,Thanks for the upload and this movie is not shit it is a awesome movie.
,picketf,2009-09-21T22:51Z,"Danjres: He rared it because 

He may want to use Picture2mail, YourFavSharingSite, IRC, Usenet or any other method of destributing the file. Plus he could care less if you like it rared. (some people actually have fast computers where joining and splitting 2gb takes less than 20 seconds)

Maybe he hasn't got a job, maybe he has an allowance of 2000 US$ a day from his deceased father Sheik Abn Abdul. 

The one who is in obvious need for a life is you who must come here to get hooked and doesn't know how to imdb shit before downloading"

I'm downloading this awesome movie with about 1Mb/s.

Thanks BOZX for ripping and compressing it to a ""normal"" file size.
