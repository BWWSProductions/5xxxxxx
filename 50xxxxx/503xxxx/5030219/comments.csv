@hechno
m8....wenever we download stuff...if we find it to be very good...we purchase it too..be it music.,...softwares....or games...it is as encouragement to the makers...what would be the point if every1 started dling and only one copy was bought n circualted?? :) moreover....the uploader purchsed the original thing too...before he ripped it ;) :D"
