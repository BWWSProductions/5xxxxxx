The Best of JFL 2008 Show #5

Show #5

Danny Bhoy: if you were fortunate enough to get a ticket to one of our thirty-two Just For Laughs Tour shows across Canada this past fall, you'd have seen Danny Bhoy in person, anchoring a killer show.

Dave Hemstad: SWM, mid 30s, hates romantic dinners, long walks on the beach and anything to do with the dating scene, seeking woman with appropriately low expectations. (Ladies, potentially the worst boyfriend EVER, but one heck of a comic...).

Bruce Bruce: by far the coolest hair of anyone on our Galas, Bruce is one of the most natural funnymen to set foot on our stages.

Maz Jobrani: this Iranian-American comic HAS to be funny, as he anchors the challengingly-titled 'Axis Of Evil Comedy Tour', featuring comedians of Arab origin.

Robert Hawkins: low-key delivery, but devastating punch lines.

Laurie Elliott: a self-described 'goofy weirdo', Laurie infuses her comedy with an affectionate charm that makes her hard not to like.

Selfish favourite moment: Robert Hawkins talks about how he would treat a wife if he had a wife, but he doesn't have a wife. But he does have quite the plan...

Enjoy!
