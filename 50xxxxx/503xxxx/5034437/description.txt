An album from yet another indie composer, and this is the first try to use torrent to spread an album. I don't say you to donate or buy, just if you thought it's good, please keep seeding. That helps me a lot.

And feel free to spread this torrent out to any other torrent sites, that also would help me promoting. I mean, I'd like people many as possible to listen to the album.

Thanks.
