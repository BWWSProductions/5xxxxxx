,pc23,2009-08-01T11:30Z,"The chaser team are bored from the whole concept - it stopped being REALLY funny at the end of the last series before they took a year off to try and get excited about it again. 

Dont worry they'll be back with something bigger and better for sure - too much talent to waste away :)

btw thanks for seeding, bit hard to watch this on tv in Baltictonia"
