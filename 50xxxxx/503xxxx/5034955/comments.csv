[V],LosslessDude,2009-08-02T11:34Z,"FLAC Compresses the amplitude ""db stream"" to save space...

So, when I download flac... I convert it to a wav file... throw it in adobe audition, and normalize it to -1db..."
[V],LosslessDude,2009-08-02T11:37Z,"I suggest you do the same... so your volume levels will be ""perfect""

I think Im just going start uploading wavs to avoid this... : P

I really do hate FLAC...
