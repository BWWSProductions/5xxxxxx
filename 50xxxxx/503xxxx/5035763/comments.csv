,RayvenE,2009-12-01T02:50Z,"I feel the need to leave my two-cents, mates. I have seen all of your comments. In all of my torrenting.. NEVER have I had an issue with Kentucky's downloads. Now, there may truly be an issue with your given systems, that will happen, and so your concerns may be legitimate, or, you could simply be an idiot, I have no idea nor will I speculate. I only wish to give a thank you to you, Kentucky, and to say that this is the ONLY uploader I would trust if I had NO access to virus protection. Heres to you, Kentucky. Cheers!"
,smilisav,2010-06-07T10:30Z,"Ok, Kentucky, I didn't download this, I don't need security now. Maybe later, so I know where to find.

Some other things gave me very good impression about your uploads. Thanks.

RayvenE, Kentucky is very reliable, but not the only one. I would trust PlanetMaster too. And many others.

Malicious pirates are much, much more rare than multimillion companies try to present to ordinary people. Maybe piracy is malicious to their greed, but usualy not to simple man like me and you.

(For some people earning money is not about survival, or comfort and luxury, but about competition agains the whole world.)

Ok, it is not all so bright, but ""to get fresh air  you must open window and let in few flies too""."

,vanjastanic,2010-12-05T13:28Z,Wow man... Thanks! You're the only one on TPB with this torrent. I downloaded almost all of your torrents! Can you tell me where do you get them (mostly)?
,vanjastanic,2010-12-05T13:30Z,"There's only 1 problem... When the computer is locked, you can unlock it by going to Safe Mode and deleting the folder ""ID USB Lock Key"" :((( Is there any other better software?"
,vanjastanic,2010-12-12T00:22Z,"WTF? 1st2blame is right! I have Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 and it tells me it's a VIRUS! And also, 33 Anti-Virus softwares say it's virus on www.virustotal.com"
,ReitenX,2011-03-26T20:31Z,"Wow, over 30 virus detections on Virustotal and my antivirus simply refuses to allow this to even get on my hard drive."
