,dark_angel_9952,2009-08-02T01:05Z,"@rakichan: if you want to play using usl loader you need to install cios223 or 222, 37 with 36.
then load it through uloader.
check mninova for a more detailed explanation. my user name for that is thongnguyen."
,WiimanfromUK,2009-08-02T13:08Z,Are you sure it doesnt work with wiikey? I have the latest 2.0... Please reply if you have it aswell and it works for you.
,gameshack,2009-08-03T16:30Z,"I use a USB Loader. It's the USV Loader GX. It loads the game, the introvideo and the ''press A'' screen. Then I wanna choose the first Menupoint and i get a black screen, with an earhurting beeping. Nothing more happens. I tried uloader too, like this guy above me bot it doesnt work. What am I doing wrong?"
,dark_angel_9952,2009-08-05T03:41Z,"@gameshack: 
are you sure that you installed the cios223 or 222 and 37 with 36. before you loaded it through the uloader>"

,shknbk,2009-08-09T06:07Z,"I've installed all of the needed cIOSes and I've tried using many different loaders but the farthest I've ever managed to get is right after the first cutscene after starting a new game.  After the cutscene it shows the loading screen but after it finished loading it just shows a black screen.  The only thing that i can do on the black screen is press the Home button, and all that does is show a little crossed out Home button symbol in the corner.  Is this because I did something wrong?"
,Genavive,2009-08-09T09:10Z,"With the way that I posted, I have not encountered any  problems playing this game one a burnt dvd-r ... the only problem I have had is with naming the freezing when trying to name your character but I have a feeling they will come out with a fix for that soon...."
,Genavive,2009-08-10T03:52Z,Change your firmware to Japanese and you will be ab le to change your name and chat online.
,shknbk,2009-08-11T21:18Z,I figured out what my issue was.  Apparently the image was corrupted so I redownloaded it and it works fine now.

,nojesus,2010-03-01T01:29Z,"dark_angel_9952 is most likely correct, as this is the way I load ANY game that doesn't work in 249. If you don't know what this means, you shouldn't fuck around with your Wii."

,Jessienesh,2010-04-10T03:03Z,You really have to hate retards like Agent74 that aren't even intelligent enough to realise the game isn't out in the US yet.
