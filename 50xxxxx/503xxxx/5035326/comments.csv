@toddiot It's a really good band. Thought about buying a physical copy of their album.

@NeonStar
Thanks neon. The only thing I know is the EP by them. You can buy a physical copy of the EP on their label site stuhrrecordsDOTcom (replace DOT with .)"

Thanks for your massive, fantastic playlists... I don't know how you manage to find so much new music in a month, but it sure is impressive!"
