,tobywoo,2009-12-13T13:36Z,This seems to be just a copy of XP Pro. Please let me know if I am missing something. It doesn't seem to have any of the drivers or other extras needed for tablet.  I really need a copy of XP Tablet for a Gateway CX2610.  Please help.

altered xp pro version
very good but not tablet"
,poo4532,2011-03-12T00:14Z,don't waste your time.  get a better image that actually passes activation then google how to convert your existing install into tablet version.  this torrent doesn't do anything for tablet users.

,ilovepuss,2011-08-19T05:56Z,i do not have a dvd drive in my tablet pc witch means i cant burn the iso to a disk and the hard drive is completely wiped of everything so that means my only option is to connect my hd to the computer im using now and install it that way. i have never done this before and have no idea what to do.
,Switch013,2011-10-26T22:34Z,"ilovepuss, one way to actually install this without a CD drive is to use a utility that I've used in the past called MultiSystem. It's a small script that allows you to create a live cd/usb multipass so you can load and install various distros. I suggest setting a pendrive up using that script since it supports Winblows iso's. Only issue is that it's a Linux tool. However, you could check out pendrivelinux.com and see if one of their tools can help. That's my suggestion."
,Switch013,2011-10-26T22:38Z,"Everyone who has downloaded this but hasn't been able to activate it, their is one method that I've used in the past. It actually works. Here's the steps:


go to start, click run and type in regedit
Next, on the left, expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,
then expand SOFTWARE, then Microsoft, then
WindowsNT, CurrentVersion, and then finally
WPAEvents. Double-click on OOBETimer and enter
these values in place of the ones in there:

FF D5 71 D6 8B 6A 8D 6F D5 33 93 FD

Then right-click on the WPAEvents folder on the left
and select permissions and click on SYSTEM.
Check the boxes that deny full control and click ok.
Now ""X"" out of everything and go back to start,
and ""Activate Windows"" or All Programs
and then ""Activate Windows"". The window
that comes up should say that windows is already
activated."
,PinkAcid,2012-04-18T09:27Z,"Switch013: I fucking love you, I have tried over 20 things this past month trying to activate my LEGIT version of windows XP that came installed on my new computer for art/school/work and this is the ONLY thing that worked. I only had 2 days left until windows was disabled, I literally almost cried when it worked."
