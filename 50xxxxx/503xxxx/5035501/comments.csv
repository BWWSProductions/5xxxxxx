Anyway how does this person for instances explains all that gave their lives and endured so much hurt, pain and persecution in the beginning of Christianity, to testify about Jesus Christ, if Jesus Christ, never existed?

Would you face being eaten by lions? Would you face pain and death like Christians faced for what they believed in... I am inclined to think you wouldn't @mrolie... so don't play the strong because maybe (or for sure) you aren't... but they were for sure. "

,OttoBismark,2009-08-01T06:25Z,"Valdo_PT-
I do not believe that the people executed by crucifixion and lions had a choice. They did not face it because they would not recant their beliefs, they were executed as a warning to the community from the forces in control to obey or else. So if somone faced death from lions, well,what was their choice? The empire executed some as a warning to others, and the empire is still alive, executing and warning. Do you believe that afghan villagers could say 'God Bless America Canada and the Netherlands' ""we love Jesus"" and be spared before the 2000lb JDAM bomb hit their house? Murder is the fault of the murderer, not the victim, and the victims were neither strong or weak, just victims of psychopaths, sociopaths, gangs and mobs."
,jiveclive,2009-08-01T07:47Z,"People willing to die for a cause, because they duped themselves into believing they can get eternal life where there is eternal trumpets and harps is not a proof of the truth of that cause. People believed in and died for Jim Jones, who was a textbook case of a psycho. 

So, all that dying shit proves is the amazing capacity of people to believe stuff when it enables them to have ready-made answers to life and they prefer that over facing life and coping with day to day complexity. 

Whether those ready-made answers are in fact worthy of belief or not is a totally separate question. "
,dukeofhazard,2009-08-01T12:00Z,"Thank you for another great upload..
We live in a partially free world, and people are allowed to belive what they want.. The biggest danger in the world, is some people telling others what right.. Make up your own mind.. Weak people need a leader.. Maybe it's god.. Some people are leaders, and some people are followers.. There is a reason for hierarchy in the world.. Some people make, most don't.. "
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-01T12:09Z,"@Ottobismark, you need to think... they had a  choice not to become Christians, don't you think? knowing all the risks they faced... Well I am not worrying who believe in Jesus Christ, I am just defending the thruth... Canada and USA or any other country don't represent God or Jesus Christ... not even the evils of Catholic church, nor any Christian church, the mistakes of a church or any person are that person's responsability not Jesus Christ's... Jesus Christ's words and actions are in the Bible, and those have no evil, no killing, no hate... many people with dirt in their souls used fanatics to try to throw dirty at Jesus Christ and God's words, but it is impossible because many people faced everything to let that the words of the MOST IMPORTANT MAN in the history of Mankind would not be changed... "
,dukeofhazard,2009-08-01T12:28Z,"@ Valdo_PT
Just to clarify things..
Life is all about choices..
Like I said before..
Weak people need some one to follow..
Strong people are leaders..

Think about it, and whatever your religion, you will understand.. Why did Waco happen? It happened because people believe what they are told.. I, personally, think it's great that people have the option to believe in something.. Something is better than nothing.. I'm just waiting for the day when people can believe in themselves, and don't need to rely on myths being told by others.... "
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-01T13:17Z,"Well you are wrong - being a leader doesn't mean being strong... most of the times it only means opportunity or ambition...
Being strong means to face all even torture and death for what a person believe or who or what a person loves... a learder can be very weak and most strong people don't want to be leaders, but they don't follow fools or fanatics... but no one was stronger than Jesus Christ, that never failed (When all men fail) not even in the unbearable pain of being crucified...
Waco, Jim Jones, etc those are fools and fanatics, not strong. They would deliever their own family just to avoid being tortured... they didn't know they were going to die... and a suicidal is a weak person not a strong one."
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-01T19:29Z,"@the4th, you would prove you are that tough if you could say that in front of me... but through the Internet any coward can pretend to be tough... I think you are mistaken, have you ever heard of David, Abrahan or Moises (to name some only) for instances?? they were no lambs, they were corageous, tough and fighters... So don't think that men of God are lambs that are affraid of fighting... I am no man of God I am just a sinner... but one thing I am not for sure is a coward... "
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-02T04:18Z,Well as I said you have all the characteristcs of the commom coward shouting from the crowd or in this case through internet...
,mrolie,2009-08-02T05:16Z,"I think personnal name calling is the start of being a coward, a easy way out when your being backed in a corner, but every here has put up a good debate, in the end if you want to believe it god thats your choice, but i personnally believe the bible is a book of stories/chinese wispers and heresay, valdo pt calling everyone cowards for putting there opinions forward? comeon!!! you dont know any of as."
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-02T13:54Z,"Yes join together to defend against one that is what cowards do... you are the stupid and the low intelligent one, because I used your own words to call you a coward, didn't you say that ""Lamb tastes good"" - meaning you wouldn't mind to sacrifice a person if that person would be like a lamb that doesn't defend himself or herself, well if that isn't the definition of a coward there isn't another then... mrolie you are the one that started calling other people cowards not me ""without belief in religion the sheep would run wild."" (Your words)... and I told to ""You can call people that believe in God, sheep, that's what Jesus Christ used to called them (in the good sense), but not that they are scared runners, would you face crucification? Would you face being eaten by lions? Would you face pain and death like Christians faced for what they believed in... I am inclined to think you wouldn't @mrolie... so don't play the strong because maybe (or for sure) you aren't... but they were for sure."" So you answered in another tone and that was it, but now that you see support to your cause and that you can have support to your cause you come back strong, well isn't that being a coward?... I am smarter than you (both) together and I am not a coward as you both show you are..."
,Cmama,2009-08-02T16:32Z,"I am going to download this just to see what this person has to say. I guess people are just bored and have to pick on something else now. So many have and will tear apart the Bible to get to the truth. Yes, Jesus came along in the 14-1500 and started a new way of religious life for many. As in his time, life is not easy and we make our own choices. We all believe in something. I don't see people seaking out the truth about other religions, only the Holy Bible. Is it that terrifing for some that so many people believe in the Holy Bible and Jesus and have to pick apart every aspect of it. Well I guess in this would we live in, everything is touchable. Nothing is safe anymore. 
Just like when they said that landing on the moon was fake, but they were proved wrong. The Davinci Code movie was wrong. These people like Brian Flemming just want to make money and get people questioning their beliefs.
Well all I can say is believe what you want and leaves us alone. 
Freedom Of Choice, The Fifth Ammendment are laws  that were passed by the Government(mankind) to protect us. Just like everything else in our wonderful world, some people use it for good and some for evil. We are people living on this planet for a short time. Stop listening to BS, and start living your own life to the fulliest, whatever that may be.
PS: This is a topic I do not talk about with others, very touchy subject for me. I believe what I want too, that being said no one's religion is right or wrong.
Bless Everyone On Our Great Planet  "

,mrolie,2009-08-03T05:33Z,"Also Valdo pt you just stated, ""other invented religions"" you just attacked other peoples beliefs on the same basis were using? shows just another ignorant believer in the bible? to me your've just lost your valuable intellegent rebuttal, because as mentioned you believe your religion is right and everyone else is wrong! 
Cmama, true and good on you for what you believe in, thanks for trying to keep the calm, but i do not pick on the bible simply for the heck of it, it is one of the worlds biggest religions forced onto cultures through fear and over the years intimadation, I was brought up half my life going to church and reading the bible and this is what ive learnt from watching others, christianity and its missionaries have unfarely taking over the world like any ""good bussines"" and teaching everyone to believe in us or perish!,while gathering one of the richest realestates in the world.
  Heck My culture believed our ancesters fished up the north island of newzealand and lasuded the sun into slowing down the days, you dont see me taunting people into those beliefs, every society have or ""HAD!"" there own beliefs till missionaries came along."
,Cmama,2009-08-03T08:44Z,"mrolie, thanks, but I wasn't talking about people posting on here, but those out there who made movies and books about Jesus. No matter how many movies and books they make, they will not deter me from my belief in Jesus.
I watched this upload today, but it meant nothing to me. I still believe in what I was taught by nuns and priests. I went to school and was taught by nuns, they taught me how to be a good girl, use my brain, and be a good student.
Yes we said prayers every morning and sang O Canada. Very strick rules were set. But if any were broken, you were punished just like your parents would. They taught us to believe in The Lord and his teaching. But growing up I didn't practice nor did i preach to anyone. 
As I have said, believe in who you want to but don't try to change someone elses beliefs if they don't want too.
This is all I have to say."
,mrolie,2009-08-03T22:57Z,"Good for you Cmama, thats how everyone should be, have a good day :> "
,mrolie,2009-08-04T05:07Z,"""the4thgod"" I guess eventually as they mature(grow older) they can learn and make there own choices for themselves, as long as its not preached to others, christianity will be as harmless as most other religions. "
,mrolie,2009-08-04T23:22Z,"frustrating for us who see this i know, but I see the future without dominating religions.  Seeking knowledge and evidence is all a part of human nature, i would imagine modern thinking will eventually out grow it. Theres simplily no room in the developing world for it, I guess  thats why most extremist and believers stem from 3rd world nations. Can you believe that in 100+ years from now if we were to be traveling  around space finding proof of other existence and find more evidence to backup evolution that people could still believe? Nah!

[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-05T13:07Z,"Mrolie the one ignorant and repressed seems to be you, between me and you... you look like you have some kind of problem with religion or with the catholic church, why don't you go and talk to them... maybe it is easier to acuse them in Internet... also I am European, you live in New Zealand, who between me and you lives closer to a 3rd world status...?
For me anyone can believe in what they want to believe... but you seem frustrated with catholic church or with religion... and say stupid things like in the future there will be no faith in God, by other words... well anyone can say what he or she wants... the truth is other matter."
,palipol,2009-08-05T21:47Z,"Dear Valdo_PT, chatolic church is only ONE of many christian churches, all with different version of bible.Well I know about atleast 4.Heck, there is even a church called Unitarian that says there is no hell.Ok, christianity is cool, my question is...if it's all about love and peace, why was it forced on american natives?See maya  people among others.Someone came from Europe, burne them, killed them...in the name of God??What sick people kills in the name of God?I can see you are chatolic right?The Bible teached you to call other people morons?To talk bad and arrogant?Is this what you learned from the Bible and the message of Jesus?The priests told you to hit back with stone when you are hit by stone?Please reconsider your words.I am not againts God, or Jesus or the Bible even.I do question however the credibility of the Bible.But not Gods existence.I don't need some priest to tell me what is good or wrong.There is an old indian saying:""Smile to the world and the world will smile back to you"" You as a defender of Jesus, Bible and the christianity etc should have been a role-model of kindness, patience and goodness for all of us."
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-05T23:49Z,"Dear papipol, I am sorry but I am not a role model... I am not sure you read all that was writtem also don't condemm all Christians for what some made, as I sad before no church or country or man represents God or Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ's words are in the Bible and He never told to hate or to kill...
Also I am not a give the other cheek person, I do to others what others do to me, if that would made me a bad Christian, well I think I have more sins than that..."
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-05T23:57Z,"Also I never liked any priest, what I learned I read on the Bible and priests know less about the truth in the Bible than me... I don't want to seem arrogant but I don't know for instances where it was taken that God looks like an old or that Angels look like small children... God is made of light and it has the same physical constitution of a man (as it said that God created man as His image), but God is not made of Flesh but of light and the colour of a red esmerald ( I am not sure of the name of this colour in English)... I am not sure you knew this many priests don't know... And no I have never seen God, but God is described in the Apocalypse Book, that is all..."

,alexross8,2010-05-24T18:07Z,"Warning -
This documentary is not 100% reliable fact.
Verses from the Bible are used out of context , and the meaning of them are obscured to fit the writer's ideal protagonist storyline .
Several comparisons are made with Jesus from other religions and cults to make Jesus (Yeshua) seem more appealing to the Pagan culture.
One example of this would be that they said that Jesus and Horus had 12 disciples , while Jesus actually had 12 disciples to judge the 12 tribes of Israel , and it was a prophecy that the Messiah was supposed to fulfill . Comparisons between Christianity and other religions cannot be used as evidence , because most of them in this documentary are ignorantly assumed without prior knowledge about Jesus or the other religions that he is compared to. This film is not debate material , and will not hold up in a debate for long , because of it's misinterpretations , misused contexts , and ad-hominems .

religion has never done any good ever. people have done good. and those who believe an atheist can't be good or a christian can't be evil are sad puppets. truthfully we're all puppets. 

what we can strive for though is to see the strings instead of just keeping our heads down and going pathetically to slaughter. just cause we're too scared to look for our own knowledge, we need the security blankets of those who are less educated than us? 

this is truth, no preacher knows more than YOU. give to collection if you want so they can have their cadillacs and hookers and rentboys. i'd rather use my time trying to expand my mind so i can know what none of then ever had the balls to learn. 

those of you giving hateful comments on this torrent doth protest a bit too much methinks. defensive? thats sad too. it's like when a guy has a tiny penis and buys a big car. you hear something that could shatter the illusions you have fought so hard to keep up, now you have to yell your side louder... being loud, the next best thing to being right.

,curlykale,2010-07-12T23:47Z,I am NOT a Christian but a Jesus who was a charasmatic preacher must have existed. The Romans refer to him and the apostles would not have suffered martyrdom for someone they hadn\'t known. Paul is very honest in admitting that he never met Jesus and appears quite jealous that the other apostles had. The message of Jesus became greatly distorted by the early churches.
