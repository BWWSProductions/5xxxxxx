Plot Summary
(Source: Manga-Updates)
"My eyes were covered by Daddy so I wouldn't know the way. My mouth was gagged and my ears were plugged by Mommy so I would hear and speak no evil. Daddy forbade me from smiling so I wouldn't have dreams and hopes. Mommy spawned me...so I would bear all her sins."

Let's talk about girlhood with Mr. Furuya in 21 chapters.
