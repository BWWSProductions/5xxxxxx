This torrent contains both the Audio CD in its remastered stereo form, as 
released in 2006, plus a short video.  Some kind of a "making of" of the album.  
The video is presented in XviD with .mp3 sound.  There are spanish and english 
subtitles already ripped and a subpack which also includes subs in Deutsch, 
FranÃ§ais and Italiano.  You should rip it yourself (I currently use SubRip on 
Windows).

Note: There's no 5.1 audio here.  I repeat: there's no 5.1 audio here.  Only the 
2.0 stereo album remastered.  And sounds great!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Martin Gore has famously noted that Depeche Mode stopped worrying about its 
future when the first post-Vince Clarke-departure single, "See You," placed even 
higher on the English charts than anything else Clarke had done with them. Such 
confidence carries through all of A Broken Frame, a notably more ambitious 
effort than the pure pop/disco of the band's debut. With arranging genius Alan 
Wilder still one album away from fully joining the band, Frame became very much 
Gore's record, writing all the songs and exploring various styles never again 
touched upon in later years. "Satellite" and "Monument" take distinct dub/reggae 
turns, while "Shouldn't Have Done That" delivers its slightly precious message 
about the dangers of adulthood with a spare arrangement and hollow, weirdly 
sweet vocals. Much of the album follows in a dark vein, forsaking earlier 
sprightliness, aside from tracks like "A Photograph of You" and "The Meaning of 
Love," for more melancholy reflections about love gone wrong as "Leave in 
Silence" and "My Secret Garden." More complex arrangements and juxtaposed 
sounds, such as the sparkle of breaking glass in "Leave in Silence," help give 
this underrated album even more of an intriguing, unexpected edge. Gore's lyrics 
sometimes veer on the facile, but David Gahan's singing comes more clearly to 
the fore throughout â€” things aren't all there yet, but they were definitely 
starting to get close.

                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Broken Frame is the second studio album by the British synthpop band Depeche 
Mode, released in 1982. The album was written entirely by Martin Gore and 
recorded after the departure of Vince Clarke, who had left the band to form 
Yazoo with singer Alison Moyet. Alan Wilder was part of a second tour in the 
United Kingdom occurring prior to the release of this album, but he had not 
officially joined the band, and thus, does not appear on the album.

In the documentary that appears on the DVD that came with the 2006 reissue, Gore 
describes the record as "our worst album". None of the singles had long-term 
success compared to most of Depeche Mode's other albums' singles. A Broken Frame 
was the only album not represented on 101 and Remixes 81 - 04. Prior to 2006, 
the last song from the album to be performed live was "Leave In Silence" in 
1986. "Leave in Silence" finally made its return (as an acoustic rendition) in a 
2006 concert in Paris.

The song "Monument" was covered by GusGus for the Depeche Mode tribute album For 
the Masses.

A special limited edition live album based on A Broken Frame recorded at the 
Hammersmith Odeon on the 25th October 1982 was also released early in 1983 which 
also included a special 12" version of Get The Balance Right on the B-Side.

2006 re-release

In 2006, A Broken Frame was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was remastered 
and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes 
the three B-sides "Now This is Fun", "Oberkorn (It's a Small Town)", and 
"Excerpts from: My Secret Garden" in addition to several live versions of some 
of the songs from A Broken Frame.

The re-release preserves the album as it was originally intended. The bonus 
track "Further Excerpts from: My Secret Garden" was removed (but unlike earlier 
re-releases wasn't put on the DVD as an extra) and the version of "Leave In 
Silence" is the album version, not the "Longer" version, making its debut in the 
USA. (Like "Further Excerpts", the "Longer" version doesn't appear on the DVD)

There are some omissions with the re-release, including a chord at the beginning 
of the stereo mixes of "Satellite" has disappeared and there are live versions 
of "Shouldn't Have Done That" and "The Sun & The Rainfall" listed on the DVD 
artwork that are not present on the disc itself.

Also included was a 27-minute documentary on A Broken Frame called Depeche Mode 
1982 (The Beginning Of Their So-called Dark Phase) featuring interviews with 
Depeche Mode (including Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder) and other personnel such 
as Daniel Miller and cover-photographer Brian Griffin. There is also footage of 
television appearances and live performances.

                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing to Fear     	by Stewart Mason

Depeche Mode's early instrumentals were consistently their weakest tracks, 
sounding more like tunes they had simply forgotten to write vocal melodies and 
lyrics for, but the sole instrumental on Depeche Mode's second album, "Nothing 
to Fear," is both one of the record's strongest tunes and an encouraging step 
forward in the band's musical development. The song opens with a bouncy, 
circular midrange riff, then slowly adds a high-register counterpoint and a 
burbling, danceable bassline. On Depeche Mode's earlier instrumentals, that 
would most likely be that, but Martin Gore also wrote a proper top melody for 
"Nothing to Fear," one that turns an otherwise passable rhythm exercise into a 
fully formed, shapely pop song.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
