â€œWhat could have been a novelty or an insipid affair is actually one of Coleman Hawkinsâ€™s more memorable albums.â€ 

Review by Scott Yanow
This CD is a major surprise. Hawkins had always wanted to record with a large string section and he received his wish on the majority of these 12 romantic melodies, all of which have some association with Paris. The surprise is that he plays with a great deal of fire (his doubletiming on â€œMy Manâ€ is wondrous), and that Manny Albamâ€™s arrangements mostly avoid being muzaky and quite often are creative and witty.  What could have been a novelty or an insipid affair is actually one of Coleman Hawkinsâ€™s more memorable albums. ~ Scott yanow
