,Zeppelinfan1,2009-08-09T07:20Z,"Nice quick upload and thanx! A7 v5. This has a few splits and merges in it but it does play decent. A few out of sync spots. This has a repeated section which is at 53:55-56:40 - 56:40-59:25. The first part of that spot is out of sync. 
I made a new file of this, I just removed the first repeated section and merged the two files together. So my copy is a better copy since it doesn't have the out of sync repeated section in it. Plus a slightly smaller file without that 2:45 repeated spot in it. Just click my name zeppelinfan1 and download it instead. And thanx again for the upload! :)"
