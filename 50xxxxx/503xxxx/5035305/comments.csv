Red Mist Poster

For dangerous and depraved loner Kenneth (Andrew Lee Potts), life at the hospital where he works is a series of endless torments from a group of ambitious medical students. But when they decide to teach him a lesson, he ends up in a coma and practically brain dead. Guilt-ridden Catherine (Kebbel), determined to save his life, administers a powerful and untested cocktail of drugs to the coma victim. Rather than cure him, however, it triggers a powerful out-of-body experience and enables Kenneth to temporarily inhabit other peoples bodies and, through them, take ...revenge on those responsible for his vegetative state."

No wait, what I meant to say was, most likely a piece of shit gore movie about some piece of shit people doing fuckedup things and eventually making the whole movie a pointless piece of shit to be buried in under a month of new pieces of shit being spewed out of the rectum of hollywood fuckheads.

(definition; Spewed: To send or force out in or as if in a stream; eject forcefully or in large amounts)"
