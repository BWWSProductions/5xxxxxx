THE CUBE.... Once you've seen it, you'll never get out....
It was a Sunday afternoon, February 23,1969, when the anthology show NBC EXPERIMENT IN TELEVISION aired a one-hour teleplay THE CUBE. It starred Richard Schaal as a man trapped in a white cubical room. He had no idea how he got there or where it was. And although anyone could enter, he couldn't leave....
A deceptively simple teleplay, THE CUBE worked its way into the memories of many who have seen it. Metaphysical play, philosophical allegory, dark comedy, psychological drama-- THE CUBE is as hard to categorize as it is to describe.
