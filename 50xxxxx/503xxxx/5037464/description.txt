Legendary music band The Beach Boys: (left-to-right) Carl Wilson, Al
Jardine, Brian Wilson, Mike Love and Dennis Wilson
___________________________________________________________________


Formed in California in 1961, the group â€“ brothers Brian, Carl and
Dennis Wilson, cousin Mike Love and their friend Al Jardine â€“ achieved
staggering success and an immovable place in the history of pop and
rock.

They had nine consecutive gold albums, 20 UK Top 40 hits, 36 US Top
40 hits (the most of any American rock band) and 56 Hot 100 hits,
including four No1 singles.

In 1966, the combined releases of Pet Sounds â€“ widely considered to be
one of the finest albums of all time â€“ and the epic single Good Vibrations
made them the biggest pop group in the world after The Beatles.

Inspired by the creative genius of Brian Wilson, the groupâ€™s main
songwriter, producer, composer and arranger, the Beach Boys summed
up a world of teenage yearning. Dreams of flashy cars, first kisses,
holiday romance â€“ and Fun with a capital F â€“ were all served up as
three-minute slices of life, with five voices in perfect harmony and
sophisticated chord changes which became the bandâ€™s trademark sound.

In an interview earlier this year, Brian Wilson said that the band wanted
to celebrate the sunny carefree environment they lived in: â€˜We wouldnâ€™t
have been the same band if weâ€™d grown up in the Midwest. The sunshine
and the girls are always there in the backbeat of our music, they always
shine through.â€™

Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred during
the bandâ€™s 48-year history, notably because of Brian Wilsonâ€™s mental
illness and drug use, leading to his eventual withdrawal from the group,
and the deaths of Dennis in 1983 and Carl in 1998.

The surviving members, now all in their late 60s, continue to tour in three
separate bands: The Beach Boys Band, with Mike Love and a rotation of
backing musicians; Al Jardineâ€™s Endless Summer Band with Jardine, his
sons and several former Beach Boys backup musicians; and Brian
Wilson with a ten-piece band including long-time Beach Boys backup
guitarist/ singer Jeff Foskett.
