,chiefs2,2009-08-07T21:57Z,"thx krun,  And agree bakeman!! - 

Can't believe how good this performance is. Watched it like 15 times now and the more and more I appreciate the performance - the entire band is phenomenal and blow Wings out of the water. Not only all incredible musicians but the backing vocals would make even Brian Wilson proud on songs like Back in the USSR. 

And Paul's voice sounds just as great as it was the 1960's, and sound mixing is pretty much perfect.  Even songs like 'Coming Up' which I wasn't a big fan of on 'vinyl' - they turn into a great jam with a Peter Gunn influenced bridge.

Dam - wish he was doing a national tour."
