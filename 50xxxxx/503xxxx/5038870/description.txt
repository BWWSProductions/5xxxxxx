Wikipedia -  Five Star, (Also Known As 5 Star), Were A British Pop - R&B Group, From Romford, Greater London, Formed In 1983 And Comprising Of Brothers And Sisters, Stedman, Lorraine, Denise, Doris And Delroy Pearson. Known For Their Flamboyant Image, Matching Costumes And Heavily Choreographed Dance Routines, Five Star Achieved A String Of Top 40 Singles And Albums In The UK Between 1985 And 1988. 
Five Star's Greatest Hits Is A Compilation Album By The British Pop Group Released In 1989.  It Was The Group's First 'Greatest Hits' Collection After A Run Of Successful Singles And Albums Since 1985. Two New Songs Were Included On The Album, The First Of Which, "With Every Heartbeat", Was Released As A Single. However, When It Failed To Make The Top 40, The Other New Track, "Something About My Baby", Was Not Released As A Single.

The Release Of Greatest Hits Marked The End Of The Group's Association With RCA Records. However, The Album Proved To Be Five Star's Least Successful Release Up To That Point, Selling Only 5,500 Copies And Peaking At A Lowly #53 On The UK Charts, Highlighting The Band's Rapid Decline In Popularity.

After The Album's Release, The Group Signed To Epic Records, And Immediately Began Planning A New Album For The Following Year, The Self Titled "Five Star" Album. However, This New Album Would Not See British Release.
