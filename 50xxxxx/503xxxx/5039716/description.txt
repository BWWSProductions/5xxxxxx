Based upon Dave Hunt's best-selling book "A Woman Rides the Beast" 

Most discussions of the end time focus on the coming Antichrist - but he is only part of the prophecy. Many are amazed to discover in Revelation 17 that there is also another mysterious character - a woman who rides the beast. Tradition says she is connected with the church of Rome. But isn't such a view outdated? After all, today's Vatican is eager to join hands with evangelicals and all religions worldwide. "The Catholic church has changed," is what we hear - or has it? 

In "A Woman Rides the Beast", biblical truth and global events present a well-defined portrait of the woman and her powerful place in the Antichrist's future empire. At least ten remarkable clues in Revelation 17 and 18 prove the woman's identity beyond any reasonable doubt.
