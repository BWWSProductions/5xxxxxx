More contrast on progress bars and drive map provide a better visual experience.

- Faster drive analyze and defragmentation.

defragmentation passes.

- New ability to Pause and Resume defragmentation passes.
This allows the user to temporarily pause PerfectDisk to run an application like a game 
or burn a dvd and then resume defragmentation without PerfectDisk having to re-analyze 
the drive.

- StealthPatrol has been enhanced to allow for automatic adjustment of CPU/Disk thresholds. 
This allows StealthPatrol to run when system activity keeps StealthPatrol from running 
for an extended period of time.

- Exclusive New Feature - PerfectDisk is now virtualization aware (PerfectDisk Server only).
PerfectDisk is the first ever, centrally manageable defragmentation program that is both aware 
of its virtual existence and able to dynamically adjust its resource consumption behavior with 
respect to its physical host resource load. PerfectDisk running in a virtual guest environment 
can communicate with its virtual host (Microsoft Hyper-V, Microsoft Virtual Server, VMware ESX) to 
determine host CPU and disk resource usage and limit guest defragmentation operations in 
order to not impact other guests or overload host server. 

- PerfectDisk for VMware enhanced to allow scheduling of virtual machine optimization.
Scheduled operation also includes ability to shutdown a running virtual machine prior to 
performing the optimization and restart the virtual machine when optimization completes.

- PerfectDisk for Exchange enhanced to allow bulk configuration of temp/working locations.

- New Fragmentation/Free Space Recovered cumulative counters.
PerfectDisk displays how many files have been defragmented and how much free space 
has been recovered since PerfectDisk was installed.

- Enhanced integration between the different automated/manual defragmentation methods. 
StealthPatrol and Screen Saver defrag methods will no longer keep manual, command line or 
defined schedule defragmentation passes from running.

- Enhanced self-diagnostics to detect and repair most common issues with PerfectDisk.

- Enhanced Space Management features.
You can quickly analyze and get a picture of how space is being distributed between file types, 
when files were created, oldest files, biggest files; find where files are on disk.

- Enhanced Command Line features.
You can analyze and get statistics through the PerfectDisk command line
