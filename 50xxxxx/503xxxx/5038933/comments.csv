Need ur help"
,C.lefteye,2009-08-20T09:50Z,"First of all: top torrent! Or so it seems anyway, because I'm stuck at 36.9%. So I would like to ask all people who can: Please seed... Pretty please?"
,Xmell,2009-10-20T12:56Z,"Please seed!!!!
We are all stuck"
,Camel91,2009-11-06T02:34Z,good torrent needs you moochers to seed this! 
,mythosaz,2009-12-06T09:44Z,"Ok, I'm also willing to help re-seed this.

I've added a complete copy of:

North by Northwest
12 Angry Men

...and a partial on 

Rear Window

I'll be adding City of God shortly.

I'm not downloading the entire torrent, as I already own most of these, but I'll be on the lookout for a few more.  I'll update as I add them."
,mythosaz,2009-12-07T06:43Z,"I've completed City of God and Rear Window as well of Paths of Glory.

I'll be making sure these are available to the swarm for another day or two (as I'm a slow uploader), but I'll go offline again if nobody else continues to plug holes in this."
,mythosaz,2009-12-07T07:05Z,"Ok, I'm actually 99.6% on my Rear Window CD1, but I think it's just that the metadata on my AVI doesn't match the original seeder's.

I need the following to complete my download, so if you can, the following would help:

Clockwork Orange
Vertigo
Once upon a time in the West

Every other movie I either already have in my physical collection or have complete now.

I could easily complete these from other sources, but I took from this torrent and I'd like to give back.

There are tracked torrents for Clockwork Orange and Vertigo that match the versions in this collection, but they're not live.

Clockwork Orange:  magnet:?xt=urn:btih:HOL6I6OPH2CR6RPSSWTRJUVVV5P2WMJW

,mythosaz,2009-12-08T09:07Z,"If someone else doesn't add some more parts, I'll stop helping :("
,mythosaz,2009-12-09T08:35Z,"If someone else lists those files that are incomplete (as I'm not downloading them all), I'll contribute by adding a few more before I give up.

Also, if someone can confirm that the swarm now has:

North by Northwest
12 Angry Men
Rear Window
City of God
Paths of Glory

...I'd appreciate it."

,mythosaz,2009-12-12T04:15Z,"Awesome.  I'll find and add some more.

Keep on the lookout for, the following, please:

Clockwork Orange: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:HOL6I6OPH2CR6RPSSWTRJUVVV5P2WMJW

Veritgo: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:BBAX2QSF57TTKM72XTMKVWI75EWIYSNC"
,mythosaz,2009-12-12T04:22Z,"Ok, confirmed.

I'll add at least 5 of these tonight.  Thanks.  I might ask for another update in a couple days."
,mythosaz,2009-12-12T10:15Z,"Added:

011-Casablanca  (99.6%)
013-Seven Samurai  (99.9%/99.4%)
025-Dr. Strangelove  (99.5%)
029-Citizen Kane  (100%/99.5%)
037-Taxi Driver  (99.4%/99.7%)

Anything at 99.x% is likely someone's re-add where the .avi metadata doesn't match the original seeder's copy.  They'll never be 100% until the original seeder re-appears.

I'll upload these at my paltry 100k/sec until they're complete elsewhere in the swarm, and then I'll try to add 4-5 more."
,mythosaz,2009-12-13T22:38Z,"As soon as I get confirmation that the following files are at the percentages listed below in the swarm (and not just on my client), I'll make 4-5 more available, starting with the highest rated films if possible.

011-Casablanca (99.6%)
013-Seven Samurai (99.9%/99.4%)
025-Dr. Strangelove (99.5%)
029-Citizen Kane (100%/99.5%)
037-Taxi Driver (99.4%/99.7%)"
,mythosaz,2009-12-14T05:55Z,"Ok, looks like my last few are there.

Added:

008: One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  (100%)
039: American Beauty (100%)

I'm running out of things to add to the swarm without TOO much searching.  Someone else is going to have to assist."
,mythosaz,2009-12-17T10:40Z,"Added:

018: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (99.6%/100%)
027: Memento (100%)

Uploading at my normal 100k until complete in swarm.

[The Fight Club by Flawl3ss I had was a match in size, but not in content.]

Someone add Clockwork Orange and Vertigo, please.  I've personally added 14 movies once incomplete."
,denaway,2009-12-24T14:14Z,Please Please stuck at 66%
,mythosaz,2009-12-24T20:35Z,"@denaway

...how about you contribute like myself and others have been doing?

Look above.  Find an original file.  Add it to your in progress download.  Select ""force check"" and there you go, you've helped others."
,mythosaz,2009-12-27T00:53Z,"I've got two more that I'll be adding, provided that the data matches.  [I had another no-match trying to re-populate Pulp Fiction.]

I'm running out of data to add, however - as this isn't my original work."
,mythosaz,2009-12-30T10:28Z,"Ok, added:

The Silence of the Lambs (100%)

...will possibly be adding

The Usual Suspects - as soon as I get the last few pieces of it - if it all matches up.

As usual, I'll seed this until the swarm catches up.

CONTRIBUTE FUCKERS!"
,mythosaz,2010-01-02T07:14Z,"Ok, added:

The Usual Suspects (100%)

I'll make a new list of what should be available and what's missing shortly.

Seriously -- someone else help, please."
,mythosaz,2010-01-05T19:16Z,"Added:

Amelie from Montmartre  (cd2@100%)

I'll upload at 100k kB/s for a while until the swarm catches up - as usual."
,mythosaz,2010-01-11T04:13Z,"Ok, as I understand it, this Torrent has 54 movies.

13 or so of them were complete or at 99.x% (non-matching metadata) when I started adding movies.

I've added 17 more, so 30/54 should be complete now.

008 - One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (100%)
010 - 12 Angry Men
011 - Casablanca (99.6%)
013 - Seven Samurai (99.9%/99.4%)
016 - Rear Window (99.7%/100)
017 - City of God
018 - Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (99.6%/100%)

024 - The Silence of the Lambs
025 - Dr. Strangelove (99.5%)
027 - Memento
028 - North by Northwest
029 - Citizen Kane (100%/99.5%)
037 - Taxi Driver (99.4%/99.7%)
039 - American Beauty
042 - Paths of Glory
043 - Amelie from Montmartre

I'm going to take a day or two (as usual) and let the swarm catch up with Amelie from Montmartre CD1, then I'll set the rest of this torrent to download and see if I can make one final attempt to add files.

SOMEONE ELSE MUST HELP!

,Tinjam,2010-05-25T06:14Z,"If I dont get any feedback about this torrent I would suggest to everyone, NOT TO START DOWNLOADING IT. YOU WILL GET STUCK ON 71.2%.

If people would like a repack when I have completed the missing files from different torrents. Let me know."

Help complete this :)"
,mythosaz,2010-06-03T23:19Z,"I fixed and am seeding Alien until the swarm catches up.

I added the first 500 megs of A Clockwork Orange

That brings my total to 18 fixed and counting.

(I also fixed a couple of subtitles files, but that's minor)

I'll have Vertigo fixed in the next day or so."
,mythosaz,2010-06-04T10:40Z,"Ok.  I've got the swarm up to 74.6% - waiting for one more person to get there, then I'll stop and add another movie tonight - then perhaps two more this weekend.  That'll make 20 of these 50 that I fixed.

I'll post a list of ones that I *really* need help with - we can fix this :)"
