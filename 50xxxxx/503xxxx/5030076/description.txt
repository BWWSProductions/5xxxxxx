Review taken from Answers.com:


When Belinda Carlisle pursued a solo career, she took more than her
 share of criticism from rock critics -- who complained that slick
 pop/rock collections like Belinda and Heaven on Earth lacked the bite
 of her work with the Go-Go's. But while nothing here packs quite the punch
 that "How Much More," "We Got the Beat," and "Turn to You" did, such memorable
 songs as "Heaven Is a Place on Earth," "Should I Let You In?," and
 "I Get Weak" show that the Angelino still had plenty of spirit.
 "Circle in the Sand" is in fact a gem -- a haunting Shangri-Las-like song
 with an early-to-mid-'60s-ish quality that makes you wish you were back
 in the Summer of '64 on your way to the beach. If one were to own only one
 solo effort from Carlisle's MCA years, this would be the best choice.
