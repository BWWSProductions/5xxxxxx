TPB sucks when it comes to deleting torrent. First of all when you click the red cross delete button:
1. The uploaded By turns ""Anonymous""
2. The torrent hash remains in the TPB system, which means you can't upload the torrent again.

So the way to delete torrent (with hash flushed out of TPB system) is by posting the hash number of the torrent to be deleted in Suprbay (TPB Forum) and requesting a TPB Mod (who says DONT PM but use forums..lol) to delete it. 

I did post my request to delete all duplicate torrents in Suprbay and do you know what reply i got from Afro (TPB Mod), ""We Mods are busy and have better things to do!"" (lol..if they are not interested to delete them why the fuck should I care !!)"
