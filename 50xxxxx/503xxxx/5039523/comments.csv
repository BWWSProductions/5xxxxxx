""Chips are down. Policies are unclear; clouded. Institutions are wilting. Law and order is out of control. Law enforcement authorities have gone haywire. No let-up in extrajudicial killings. Target killing goes on in different parts of the country on a daily basis - most visible in the metropolitan city of Karachi and Balochistan. Terrorism and militancy is on the rise. People have become intolerable of others. Security agencies are unequal to the task. Even the protector of last resort is facing multiple crises. Cracks are creeping in. Corruption is rampant and unchecked. Mind-boggling scandals hit the media, every other week. Prices are skyrocketing. Loadshedding goes on for 10 to 16 hours every day. Trains are being cancelled. The economy is in doldrums. Governance is in the pits. Insecurity stalks the land. The countryâs territorial integrity is violated every other day. Drones and foreign Special Forces kill Pakistanis with impurity. Peopleâs representative houses - the elected Assemblies and the Senate - are powerless and clueless. Fake degrees are rampant as are fudged figures. They pass resolutions which remain unimplemented. Meaningless debates are held. Power is concentrated in the hands of the military chief and ISI. Treasury is empty and unbearable burden of loans are breaking the back and taking Pakistan to default. No one wants to invest in Pakistan. We are isolated and soon will become a pariah nation shunned by the comity of nations....."" 

Is this you call life with dignity? Death is better then this retched life of a Pakistani. No wonder suicide bombers are helping others reach Jannat."
