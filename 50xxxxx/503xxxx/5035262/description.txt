Mike shows up at Teddy KGB's place to parlay his three stacks of "high society" ($30,000) into enough $ to play in the world series of poker. He runs into his old friend Knish. Knish tries to talk him out of playing because he feels they will take his whole bankroll. Mike plays, thinks he has a great hand, bets it all and loses. He is down to the felt, bust. Knish has a rout truck and lets Mike run the route to make money and Mike swears off poker. Mikes old friend "Worm" is getting out of prison and Mike picks him up. Worm pressures Mike into playing poker and they pull out all the old tricks and make decent money.
