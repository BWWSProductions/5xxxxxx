,iceberg303,2009-08-24T08:39Z,"This is very badly encoded.

Unwatchable on PS3, 360, dlink settop or popcorn hour.

You can watch on a PC but ti will freeze up and you will have to skip about 3min to get past the bad parts. So far all the 2HD releases are this way. I dont know what they are encoding with but someone please tell them to change it. Most places these releases have been NUKED for this reason.  When TVTorrents goes back up there is a repack there that fixes some of it a little bit.
