I'm with D3 on this.
Neither of you have contributed to TPB other than leeching.
The only thing people like you get to say is:""Thank you good sirs/madams"", and be on your merry way.
And next time you have something to say... RTFD!
Now stfu and run along.

To the 2Lions team: Nice job, as always. Keep it going."
,Orqhe,2010-03-03T12:08Z,Good quality!
