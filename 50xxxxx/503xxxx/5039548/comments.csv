TRY AGAIN. "

Yes it IS full of terrible nasty clicks and shit and junk that makes my stomach turn when I try to play a quality track in my car! All I can notice are the clicks and pops of SHIT MP3! "

Yeah you and trexme are absolutely right. When im pushin this through my big ass stereo everyone of those little sound artifacts popping and cracking make this unlistenable. There are other Torrents to get these cds and i strongly suggest people go with a different one.

For the carter 3 this torrent was great quality:
