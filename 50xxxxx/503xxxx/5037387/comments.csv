,boardco,2009-08-03T06:24Z,Patch is not working for me.  After I run it and open 1click it still says I am on a trial version.
,cdak,2009-08-03T10:18Z,"mr robbingHood,
can i request Palo Alto's Business Plan Pro Premier 11.0? it's very much appreciated. thanks in advance."
,rayhaque,2009-08-05T15:22Z,"I concur, the patch is either not working or does not remove the trial messages.

Otherwise the app works, and the files are clean (no virus's, spyware, etc)."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-05T17:16Z,"For those who are to lazy and stupid to read the install notes in the Readme.txt file:

Installation notes:
*******************

- Disconnect internet during installation, and/or make sure to NOT let the prog 
  connect to internet (block unwanted connections by using e.g. a firewall).

- After install copy the patch from the patch folder into the install dir. 
  Default install path: C:\Program Files\LG Software Innovations\1Click DVD Copy Pro

- Run the patch, at ""Select Target App."" select 1Click DVD Copy Pro, and press 
  the patch button.


Done!



NOTE: 
- Block the program from accessing internet (with eg. a firewall)!
- Do NOT update the program! (Right click on the program window and from
the menu uncheck ""Enable Update Notification"".)"
,TheGeekinator,2009-08-07T03:07Z,"I hate to tell you Robbinghood, because I know you've consistently provided stellar ups, but unfortunately, the previous posters are correct.  

Not that I HAD to ""read the install notes in the Readme.txt file"" (I'm quite competent in these matters), I did anyway ... as I always do.

RESULT: The provided patch does not work.  

No panic buttons here though.  Easily found another patch (from ""SND""@http://cracks.am/d.x?11FVQqF) that worked perfectly.

It's working for me. 5 or 10 people saying things don't work for them doesn't mean it's working for nobody. BTW: Please don't post such links here."
,TheGeekinator,2009-08-07T05:54Z,"Your implication that I stated your provided patch worked for ""nobody"" is inaccurate as best.  You say that it worked for you, and I'm glad.  I believe you as well.  

I'm well aware of the all-too-common install failure reports posted by woefully inexperienced users, who wrongly blame the software components they've downloaded (and the person who uploaded it), when the failure is clearly user (their own) error.  However, I'm NOT THAT GUY, as I attempted to diplomatically express in my post.  

My patch failure is NOT attributable to my target system (a very common, fully patched Windows XP Pro SP3 that's absolutely malware free).  It's also NOT because your appropriate, accurate, and well-documented procedures were not adhered to, they were.  However, there are at least a couple of common circumstances that when using a patch-type crack, an otherwise successful patch may fail.  That may be the case here.  Just say the word, and I'd be happy to elaborate in a future post.

Nevertheless, regardless of the WHY, more importantly is the fact that if it failed for me, it's a certainty there are/will be others experiencing same.  Call me odd, but I had the crazy notion to share with all other downloaders (and you) my solution, and a link to possibly (hell, at the very least, probably) a better patch.  Given these facts, why on earth would you request that I ""Please don't post such links here""?  First, why would you not want to at least investigate my proposed patch further?  Second, why would you not want any of your downloaders to be apprised of a viable alternative should/when they need it?  Today is the first I've posted on TPB, but I have reviewed ""Usage Policy"", as well as the post ""Image & Link Rules"" [http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=39609&highlight=posting+links] in the forums.  There I found nothing that prohibits posting of such links.  If I somehow missed such a prohibition, please advise, and I'll respectfully comply.

ugh, considering you are telling someone their work does in fact not work, by no fault of their own is pretty good grounds to tell you whatever they want.

and you know chances are it is something you did to leave yourself with an unsuccessful install.

Ive had problems with some of robbinghood's apps before later to realize it was something I either missed or messed up. hey im not perfect, but I guess you are, pretty smart too, I mean you can name your OS and service pack? damn

and to bad you decided to make this your first comment, because you look like a jackass. and you totally are ""THAT GUY""

thanks for all your hardwork robbin, just got your WB sfx pack, takes me back"
,boardco,2009-08-08T02:27Z,"Patch worked the next day after the install.  The day of however it gave the message indicating a trial version even after restart.  It appears to work fine now however, and it was patched successfully not an error on my end.  Thanks"

Enjoy the WB sfx pack. :)


@TheGeekinator
1- Your ""Image & Link Rules"" [http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=39609&highlight=posting+links] is for SuprBay (SB), and NOT for TPB.
2- Posting certain links is not allowed, for example to protect people to download crap.
3- What you get here is for free, so acting like as if you paid for it and have some money-back guarantee is useless. Keep it real.
4- There are several reasons why things may work for one and not for another. I my case I did not had any previous cracked version of this installed. First I ran the program, then I tried to register with any name and key. Of course that didn't work, but after I ran the patch the program was activated with that name and key."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-08T02:34Z,"@boardco 

Read the Readme.txt about blocking the app from connecting to internet and disabling auto-update etc. "
,na_tra,2009-08-12T10:21Z,work fine in vista 64 but not XP.  will try XP later again.
,neroawaits,2009-09-26T21:45Z,Excellent works first time if notes are followed correctly! Thanks RH
,just4u2c,2009-09-27T04:00Z,"did everything as was written in the Readme! file. disconnected from the internet, blocked the program from connecting to the internet, AND unplugged my wireless router (i'm installing on a laptop) also, disabled ""Enable Update Notification"" from the program menu. still says trial version. not at any time (during installation or at the time i ran the program) was i connected to the internet. the patch doesn't work."
,TheGeekinator,2009-09-27T20:06Z,"@just4u2c

I experienced same on the XP system I install to.  Very good likelihood the alternate patch (http://cracks.am/d.x?11FVQqF) I mentioned in a previous comment will work for you as it did for me.

P.S.  If you try it, I'd be curious to know your result.

,Rassweiler,2009-10-09T22:11Z,"1) thank you very much RH
2) I have read the instructions and Im also getting the trial pop-up. I was wondering if waiting a day had solved that issue for anyone other than Boardco?

again, thanks RH"
,Rassweiler,2009-10-17T02:49Z,"For anyone who cant work it: I have the entire instructions....

1)Run setup exe...

2)Copy patch to install. dir. and apply it...

3)In case your promted with the register dialog or just want to
   register application then use any 17 digit/chars Registration
   ID and any 88 digit/chars Activation Code! Do this with the
   ""Register Offline"" method.

   Example:

    Registration ID: JW / Team ICU 2k7

   Activation Code: 1212121212121212121212121212121212121212
                    1212121212121212121212121212121212121212
                    12121212

-ENTER THIS MANUAL,Dont copy/paste.

88 digit/chars Activation Code!!!

This works."
,qe_2003,2010-02-06T21:51Z,"For the life of me I cannot get this to work. Call me stupid i guess...
Followed instructions and repeated whole process several times, no dice.
Probably did not work because I'm not that great at computers, not retarded or anything but not that smart.
None the less, thank you for the upload.
Appreciate all the hard work."
