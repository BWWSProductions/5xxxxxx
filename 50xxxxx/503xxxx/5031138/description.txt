Our Local Future - Climate Change, Peak Oil & The End of Money

Whether we are prepared for it or not, our future will be local: a local future.

The challenging facing us are clear: 1. we must stop and then reverse our undesirable impacts on Earth, and 2. we must eliminate our reliance on the unsustainable global economic system.

This 30-minute talk examines climate change, global peak oil production, money creation and destruction, the current economic crisis, the relationship between energy and money, and how we can prepare on and individual and community level for the inevitable local future.

Aaron Wissner provides this insightful, detailed, and compact look at our current situation, where we are headed, and what we can do to prepare.

This is the MP3 audio file.  The accompanying PowerPoint slides and video should also be available online.
