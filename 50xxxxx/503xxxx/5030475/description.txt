A father and son switch bodies.

Typical high school senior Chris Hammond (Kirk Cameron) and his father (Dudley Moore), Jack, are about as close as they can get--but they're about to become even closer. When a freak accident causes them to switch bodies, they will learn more about each others lives than they ever expected!

Like Father, Like Son Reviews:

"...[Moore and Cameron] are so clever and charming as the mismatched pair that they turn a potential dud into a sweetly engaging film....First-rate [cast]..." -- Caryn James, New York Times
