 In the fall of 1959, for a time capsule, students draw pictures of life as   
 they imagine it will be in 50 years. Lucinda, an odd child who hears         
 voices, swiftly writes a long string of numbers. In 2009, the capsule is     
 opened; student Caleb Koestler gets Lucinda's "drawing" and his father       
 John, an astrophysicist and grieving widower, takes a look. He discovers     
 dates of disasters over the past 50 years with the number who died. Three    
 dates remain, all coming soon. He investigates, learns of Lucinda, and       
 looks for her family. He fears for his son, who's started to hear voices     
 and who is visited by a silent stranger who shows him a vision of fire and   
 destruction. What's going on?
