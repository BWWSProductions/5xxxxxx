,tkb-djuki,2009-08-07T19:39Z,"Great game.
we have a server running on a hamachi LAN.
Hamachi is a little program that simulates a LAN network.
you can download it here
http://hamachi.en.softonic.com/
once installed connect to our network
name: =TKB=
password obsolete

then start the game.
press ctrl + alt + ~ to enter your console screen
type there:
connect 5.199.83.56

that would commect you to our server"
