,TheLegendaryCracken,2010-12-11T12:34Z,"Hmm it got to around 1mb per second, 3% done and said Torrent Error, i clicked force start and it has continued as normal so fingers crossed :) 
I imagine it will work as it has gone from 3% to 14% in about 1 minute since i clicked force start. That being the case, and it being very quick, great upload :D"
