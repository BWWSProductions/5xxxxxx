Electronic dance music has always been about breaking the rules. House broke the rules of dance music and disco, drum 'n bass and hardcore broke the rules of house, and newer styles like dubstep and breakcore break the rules of previous genres and are defining a progressive sound.

SonarAsphyxiation is about tearing up all the new rules created by modern dance music and playing around with structure to create a breakcore orgy of immensely fun proportions!

Have a listen and break some rules with me! :-)
