,kun01_l,2009-10-05T00:23Z,"Hey I just downloaded this. Apparently the actual seminar section has NO sound at all!

I am using VLC. The intro has very cheesy 90s music, but when people start talking there is no sound. 

Tried all the videos"
,TuMadre1,2009-11-13T06:23Z,">I am using VLC.

Found your problem. Try CCCP: http://cccp-project.net/ which includes Media Player Classic, far better than VLC."
,thebob1991,2010-01-19T02:52Z,would love the upload if ppl plz seed!
,highlander777,2010-07-30T11:49Z,"Thanks for the upload but the videos have a few problems:

1) They are highly compressed. I'm sure this is to save space but everything is blurred. And you can't see what Jeffries writes on the board.

The quality of Jeffries' videos have always been less than professional and the compression doesn't help any.

2) When you jump ahead using VLC, the audio goes off. Again, the problem is probably because the video is highly compressed. Using Media Player Classic works though.

I downloaded this because it had Jeffries' name on it.

They should get rid of that Yates guy. The first thing you learn when teaching to a class is SPEAK THE HELL UP! It was annoying listening to him speak softly. When I turn the volume up, you can heard his snot intake every other breath! F*ck, blow your nose! His presentation wandered too as he obviously wasn't prepared. I'm going to scream if I hear ""OK?"" at the end of a sentence again!"
,discocaine31,2011-12-10T17:48Z,can somebody upload kokology 1 and 2 please?
,joerija,2012-02-27T22:34Z,"the first 8 videos are good, (when considering its a video from 2001), but the last 2 are not ok, it stuttered unwatchable and the last one has the same issue. For me its really annoying because i watched everything till 9 & 10, now i cant finish it off.  thanks for the torrent though!"
,joerija,2012-03-01T09:18Z,"sorry, all videos are correctly playing, i just had to deinstal divx software!!"
,machspee,2012-07-23T15:07Z,"Ok here's a solution i recommend for people having problems with not able to jump or scroll to a particular time. 

1. Go and download Xilisoft Video Converter here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7438937/Xilisoft_Video_Converter_Ultimate_7.4___keys__by_Senzati.rar

2. Now convert the files in this torrent to xvid, set the video quality to higher and audio quality to highest, and leave the rest of the setting unchanged which leaves the converted file size nearly same as the one in this torrent files. 

3. Now the converted files must be good without any errors previous users posted here. "
,machspee,2012-07-23T15:13Z,"It took nearly 1.30 hours for me to convert all the files.

But I don't know why the uploader compressed the files so small. I mean, each of the tapes are nearly 2 hours long and many of us wouldn't mind somewhat larger file sizes like 500-600 MB sizes for long running tapes like these. "
