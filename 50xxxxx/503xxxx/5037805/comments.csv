He said he wished he didn't have that problem, but he couldn't do anything about it. Whether the expressions match is irrelevant. He played this all from his head. His interpretation got recorded as well, which isn't all a bad thing. If you don't like the recording, oh well, but Bach was a brilliant composer and Gould was a brilliant performer. It is what it is."
,mormandy3,2012-03-24T07:10Z,"Gould is one of the greatest pianists of modern times. He DOES NOT play Mozart in the way most interpret it, and often goes off into left field. And yeah, he hums. Now with that said, I find his versions BRILLIANT, and untouchable. one the 11th sonata for instance, his version is full of energy, life, galloping along like a wild animal. When I hear other people's versions I feel incomplete, and bored. He never played the romantic period artists like liszt, chopin, etc., which he and I both find vulgar and over-wrought. He was a lover of Bach, and a closet Mozart fan, though he said Mozart lived TOO LONG, typical of the snarky Gould. In contempt of his secret hero Mozart, he played Mozart with reckless abandon at times, taking more liberties than anyone else I know of. In short, I find he is the only musician who plays Mozart sonatas better than anyone since Mozart himself, who if you research will find was a very silly eccentric person at times with his playing.
