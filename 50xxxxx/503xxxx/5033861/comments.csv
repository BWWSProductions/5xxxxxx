,LeAP666,2009-08-01T23:52Z,plz help me seed. dont hit and run
,GawdamSumbitch,2009-08-03T20:26Z,"you have to seed it yourself for us to get it so we can then help you.  45 of us want it, but with no one seeding, we're all shit out of luck."
,GawdamSumbitch,2009-08-03T20:27Z,45 of us at this moment.
,GawdamSumbitch,2009-08-04T17:12Z,"thank you to whomever started seeding this.  240 dollars worth of puddin'.  awwww, yeah."
,gimpy42,2009-08-05T07:11Z,I've got the seed taken care of on this one and the 2nd  with a seed box -- now  get to uploading the last 2 already. :D
,GawdamSumbitch,2009-08-05T14:53Z,"thanks to gimpy...now there's 25 seeders to 5 leechers...wondering how 24 people got this in 1 day, and i'm still chugging along at 10kbs...no worries, though."
,soundsett,2009-11-08T00:25Z,now this is a complete rip of the dvd. how do i go about and burn this to dvd? any help please
,lazylazyjoe,2009-11-15T00:51Z,"@soundsett ConvertXtoDvd is the easiest method if you don't know what you're doing.  Also, for those looking for x264 transcodes of The State check out my torrents http://thepiratebay.org/user/lazylazyjoe .They're smaller but watchable and can go right on an Ipod. "
,altoiddealer,2011-03-27T21:52Z,Thank you seeders!
,rg7,2011-12-25T01:25Z,"I have been looking for this for so fucking long.
i'm going to seed this with 5 sockets at 200KB/sec each when this is finally done."
