Director Eliseo Subiela has authored many outstanding (and underrated or unknown to the mass market) films as "Hombre Mirando al Sudeste (Man Facing Southeast)" (1986), "No te Mueras sin Decirme Adonde Vas (Don't Die without Telling Me Where You Are Going)" (1995) and the present "El Lado Oscuro del Corazon (The Dark Side of Heart) (1992).
All of them are a weird mixture of fantasy and reality. Subiela uses a surrealistic language delivering powerful images and proposals to the audience.

In The Dark Side Subiela employs a light comedy tone but deep themes are touched: love, death, creativity and the ultimate meaning of life itself.

The story follows Oliverio's comings and goings to sell his ideas to advertising companies in order to make a living. He is a poet in search of love, desperately looking for a woman that can fly.
In his quest he makes love to many female candidates. If they can't fly... well the bed take care of them.
Finally he meets Ana, a beautiful Uruguayan whore that flies, but she is a pro and demands money. So Oliverio has to strain his imagination to earn enough money to have a three day love tour.

Some scenes in the movie will leave you roaring of laughter: the cow talking to Oliverio with his mother voice; crossing Buenos Aires' crowded streets with an enormous phallus sculpture and the disposal bed are some exhilarating examples.

Poetry with texts from Mario Benedetti and Juan Gelman enrich the story.
Dario Grandinatti has the ideal physique-du-role to impersonate Oliverio and delivers very convincing performance. Sandra Ballesteros' dark beauty gives her Ana a sensual and captivating personality.
Nacha Guevara as the hieratical Death is great.

It is a great provoking film for adult audiences. Do not miss it you'll be delighted!
