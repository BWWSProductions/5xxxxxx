Ladies and gentlemen, this torrent contains the most recent installment of Mike Baron and Steve Rude's Nexus, in it's entirety.


Space Opera is the most recent four issue story line which was published by Rude Dude productions and was numbered as issues 99 - 102 from Nexus v2 as published by Capitol Comics (1-6) and then First Comics (7 - 80). The remaining issues 81 - 98 were completed by a series of smaller mini-series type runs published by Dark Horse comics.

Space Opera started in 2007 (issue 99), saw the release of issue 100 in 2008, and has just been completed with a double sized issue (101 and 102) in 2009.

The Dude promises us more Nexus in the future, but only time will tell.

In the mean time, thanks to the scanners and the original sources.


Please seed. Please enjoy.
