David Bowie: The Definitive Rarities Collection


(((This is a Re-Up of the original torrent.  There were...technical difficulties)))


190 songs.  13 plus hours of Bowie. 

Here it is! These are all the official David Bowie b-sides, one-offs & collaborations that youâ€™ve been looking for.  A vast majority of these are directly from CDs that I bought and ripped in high quality mp3s.    (Only a very select few of the better remixes have been included though.)

Do also note there are several â€˜Toyâ€™ songs on here.  Including a couple that have never officially been released but were leaked somehow somewhere. 

Also, these will be organized when you put them into itunes for your convenience.  
See my profile for a torrent of all his DEMOS as well.

************
Please feel free to give thanks.  This is a decade of collecting and many hundreds of dollars at work here.
