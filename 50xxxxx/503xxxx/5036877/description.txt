Big Man Japan (Dai-Nipponjin) 2007: Mockumentary, Superhero, Anti-hero, Giant Monsters

Imagine "Hancock" without all the Hollywood goody-two-shoe crap, and the most unique and disturbing giant monsters seen in anything outside of a Powerpuff Girls episode. Per "Fantasia", best appreciated on acid.
