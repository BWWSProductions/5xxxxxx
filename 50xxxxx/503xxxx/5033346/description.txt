Notes: Took Russian video source and synced MAXSPEED TS audio to it so thanks maxspeed
Also if anyone has the following:
Gforce
Orphan
The Ugly Truth
All these movies come out this friday and would like early sources for them.
Please email me these sources thanks!

Work Done:
Ok edited the hue/saturation to add a bit of color to it
added a chroma smoother
added a sharpener filter
edited the brightness and contrast and we got a real nice finish
video9 audio9
Im quit amazed with how nice this one turned out, I dont think I've Done better.
Russian source was dark and fuzzy, this one is perfect and clear.
Probably better than the MAXSPEED video :)

Looking for Cams, TS's, pre released R5's and Direct or line audio thanks
