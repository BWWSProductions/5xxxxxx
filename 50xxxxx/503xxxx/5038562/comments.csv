,kraus99,2009-08-03T17:02Z,"hey holy roses,
thank you for all the great uploads, i know you get hundreds of requests a month but i think at least this request many people would agree and enjoy having these episodes on the go. My request is Family guy episodes. i Know that there are a hell of a lot of them so even if you could just do some that would be great.

Thanks HR"
