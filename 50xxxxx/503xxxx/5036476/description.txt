Aerosmiths "collections" is a [Re-Mastered] album that came out in 2007 and has the same song listing as Aerosmith 1988 "Gems" album
So i thought i would invent the deluxe version considering the original well both go for 58 minutes,
So i added a few more songs to make it closer to 80 minutes [For CD] while i kept the original 12 songs in order and edited
The back [2007 Collections] album cover while also keeping the [2007] original with the front cover and CD, Jpegs.
The songs that i added are from the same period..
Well if record companies can just change a cover for a different year release well i can do the same.
Collections as in Gems Was Noted As Aerosmiths Greatest "Rock" Hits Compared To Their Other "Normal" Greatest Hits,
Is where most of the extra's that i included to this self made deluxe edition Are From. [Oops, another bootleg is born]
Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
