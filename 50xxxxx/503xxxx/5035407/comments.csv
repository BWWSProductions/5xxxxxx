,wollis2,2009-08-01T10:52Z,"I see that there's a problem to everybody who downloads this torrent

It just stops at 25,8% "
,legacycf,2009-08-01T12:26Z,"yeah, actually i'm stuck at 25.9 but can't seem to upload the last .1 percent to everyone. =)

hopefully, l337g4m3rg33k will seed some more tomorrow."
,l337g4m3rg33k,2009-08-03T19:30Z,"Sorry about that, had a small vacation.  Seeding again."
,l337g4m3rg33k,2009-08-03T23:09Z,"Hopefully that is a bit better.  Send me feedback/quality rep when you finish the download please.

Also, this is one of my favorite games too, and hopefully everyone else enjoys it like I have."
,legacycf,2009-08-04T10:24Z,"great upload l337g4m3rg33k. i'll seed this or a while.

finally got a chance to play it. heres my review of the download:

graphics: 9/10
sound: 10/10
the game itself : 10/10

i only have one problem so far, and that is that every minute or so, the background goes black except for immediate areas around characters. does anyone know how to fix this?"
,l337g4m3rg33k,2009-08-04T16:06Z,"Here's what I use without any problems:
Emulator - epsxe
BIOS - scph1001 USA
Video - P.E.Op.S. OpenGL Driver 1.78
     Open the config, press the ""Nice"" button in lower left, then change it to windowed mode.
Sound - P.E.Op.S. DSound Audio Driver 1.9
P.E.Op.S. CDR Driver 1.4
     Read Mode is BE_2 if you want to read from a disc.
Respond to me if I'm allowed to post external links and I'll set you up with the direct websites for all of the plugins."
,legacycf,2009-08-05T22:40Z,"you are allowed to post external links.

I think the problem i'm having is my video driver. so i'll try to fix that and see if that helps."
,legacycf,2009-08-05T22:45Z,Update: I changed my video driver from Petes OpenGL driver 2.8 to 1.78 and the game works perfectly now.

,DiabloVX2,2010-03-17T09:27Z,"This game is great and all, but how do I go from disc 1 to disc 2? It stops doing anything after the screen that says ""Please insert disc 2."""

,fiveagainst,2010-10-24T05:58Z,How Do I Save.
,Belzak,2010-11-01T16:44Z,"Hey I'm running into a recurring problem running this on psxfin. Occasionally the characters will freeze up (not the game) and I will stop being able to move. I've been able to correct this problem before by loading from the memory card and not using load stat/fast forward. I'm stuck on the Queen's Fury in disc 2 and whenever I talk to Meru, my character freezes and nothing is working. Anyone have an idea? "
,steven19l,2011-02-25T22:59Z,O_O omg one of the best games made for ps1 XD hope it works. any other site their zips/rars are fucked
,ahzzhar011,2011-02-26T07:00Z,I love this game when I played PS1..Is this game already been tested?
,Costa_Soul,2011-03-20T02:47Z,do you need a ps1 emulator to play this?
,ljparker,2011-04-18T05:09Z,"Any word on how to go from disc 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc.?"

,Jamblaster,2012-03-29T15:53Z,"For anyone having a problem swapping disks here is what you do.

1) Download and use epsxe 1.7.0 and also download epsxe 1.6.0
(Best emulator out there)
You need to download the Bios and plugins including memory card plugins as well so see youtube if you don't know how (They both use the same plugins and Bios so just download install and copy/paste between the two)


2) Use 1.7.0 to play the game and save using the memory card plugin as close as you can to the disc swap part of the game.

3) copy/paste your memory card plugin folder from 1.7.0 to 1.6.0 to transfer the save game.

4) Run epsxe 1.6.0  and load the saved game and when it says ""Change to disk (number)"" push the escape key on your keyboard 'esc' on upper left corner.

5) Go to--> File/change disc/ ISO/ (Pick your disc number)

6) Change the disc and then save it using the internal memory card plugin.

5) Copy/paste back from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0

This process is due to the fact that 1.7.0 cannot change discs, but 1.6.0 can. 1.7.0 is much better to play on though due to glitches in the source of 1.6.0.
