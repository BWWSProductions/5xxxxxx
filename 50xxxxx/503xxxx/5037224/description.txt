Indie/Experimental band from Olympia, Washington. Sounds similar to older Modest Mouse, with electronic subtleties that tie into Beta Band, Boards of Canada and Radiohead influences.

Torrent includes two self-published EPs Nice Guys Come in Threes and Arms + Legs. Also throwing in an extra track that I really liked!
