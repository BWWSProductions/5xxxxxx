Revered worldwide for their groundbreaking role as 1960s San Francisco-based psychedelic rock pioneers channeling everyone from John Coltrane to Bessie Smith into their own hard-driving sound, Big Brother and the Holding Company introduced the one and only Janis Joplin to the world. Live tapes of Big Brother in its prime with Joplin fronting the band are an extremely rare commodity, rendering The Lost Tapes a truly historic discovery.This two-CD set from Airline Records contains no less than 12 stunning tracksâ€“the entire first disc--that have never been released before in any form, along with a second disc of equally thrilling live material that sees its first legitimate release on this package.Consisting of guitarists Sam Andrew and James Gurley, bassist Peter Albin, drummer David Getz, and the mighty Janis as their mind-blowing lead singer, Big Brotherâ€™s sets were liable to proceed in any number of contrasting directions. Over the course of the concert that comprises the first disc, Janis belts her own blues-soaked â€œWomen Is Losersâ€ as well as the subtly dynamic â€œBye Bye Baby,â€ songs soon to be eminently familiar via the bandâ€™s studio versions. There was also room on their set list that evening to investigate Tommy Tuckerâ€™s tough shuffle â€œHi-Heel Sneakers,â€ the riveting â€œOh My Soul,â€ and an amazing 11-minute rendition of the timeless spiritual â€œAmazing Grace.â€
Even diehard Big Brother fans well acquainted with the material on the second disc have never encountered it in such pristine condition, both discs benefitting from 24-bit mastering. Highlights on the second CD include rousing treatments of â€œLet The Good Times Roll,â€ â€œI Know You Rider,â€ â€œMoaninâ€™ At Midnight,â€ â€œHey Baby,â€ and the Albin-penned â€œCoo Coo.â€ Also aboard are the Port Arthur, Texas-born Joplinâ€™s pulverizing renderings of two songs forever associated with her brief but indelible musical legacy,â€œDown On Meâ€ and Big Mama Thorntonâ€™s â€œBall And Chain.â€ This deluxe collection features liner notes by Big Brother members Sam Andrew and David Getz; their warm, vivid reminiscences adding to the immense appeal of the most extensive authorized domestic release currently available by the band. Big Brother was already a powerhouse despite being together as a unit a relatively short time, and this is where it all began for Janis. With The Lost Tapes, youâ€™re sitting front row as they prepare to meet stardom head on.
