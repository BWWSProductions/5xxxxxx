The first four episodes of Naruto Shippuden dubbed in english.  I FINALLY managed to actually get them downloaded, No thanks to the pirate bay >.>.  However, I love this site, so I figured I would put them on here and make sure I keep them seeded.  Anyone who downloads these, please also try to seed.  The first two were in mp4 format, I changed them to avi and they seem to work fine.  If anyone has any problems with them, let me know.  Also one last little note, episodes 3 and 4 have an annoying little screen that shows before the episode.  Nothing is wrong with the file, the screen will go away after a min or so.
