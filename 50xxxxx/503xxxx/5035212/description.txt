History and Tales of the Crusades:

In March 2000, the late Pope John Paul II apologized again for the crimes and sins committed by the Catholic Church in the last 2000 years. Pope John Paul II was sincere and passionate with his many apologies. During his long reign as Pope, he said â€˜sorryâ€™ to Jews, Galileo, women, victims of the Inquisition, Muslims slaughtered by the Crusaders and almost everyone who had suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church through the years.
