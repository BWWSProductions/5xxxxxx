,edenns,2009-08-07T12:08Z,"Hai everyone.. what I know, you have to install from cycle 06-2009 or before if you want to use this. Then you may update with the next cycle or this present cycle. Good luck!!!"

,ARNEM1S,2009-08-08T11:01Z,"Plz,

whenever i open jeppview it tells me that i have 00days to secure the product. and i need a site key, Ive treied all the available keys in TPB but dont wanna work, any help plz??? I dont wanna reinstall my win :((."
,b737-500,2009-08-08T21:47Z,"To ARNEM1S:
To activate jeppview You have to first install update 0609 or earlier (activation code will only work for those updates), activate it with the key R00D-KCAB and then install the current update."
,Sasquachi,2009-08-08T21:54Z,"hey guys, about the activation for jeppview 0907 until now, i believe, some guys don't have the cicle 0906 to use before the current cicle to keep the jeppview activated, so, i've been trying some ways to pass the activation without the code since noone knows the damn code to cicle 0907 until now, so.......open your jeppview, it doesn't matter what cicle it is, on screen with the buttom ""trial expired"" invisible, (we can't click on it), open the program called ""enable button"", the same program used to install the pmdg 747-400, it works! :D, we still can use the program without the activation code and after the 20 days expired....well, maybe it helps some guys until someone find out the code to the current cicles! see ya!"
,ARNEM1S,2009-08-09T19:44Z,"thanks guys the trick of Sasquachi, I will try 0609 when after download, at least now am safe for a few days.
again thank you :)"
