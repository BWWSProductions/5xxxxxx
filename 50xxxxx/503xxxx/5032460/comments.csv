,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-08-01T13:25Z,"Could someone either upload the Sibelius 6 iso, or post a link to a torrent for it, as the information (torrent links) in this torrent doesn't work for me.  Desperate to get my hands on this one..."
,BrocknessMonsta,2009-08-03T05:54Z,"I may be crazy, but I have a feeling that this is just a keygen for Sibelius. Most keygens (even for mac software) are executable files that you have to launch on Windows.
I don't picture this amazing software being only a whole 12 MiB either."
,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-08-09T11:05Z,"It's not a fake, it's an updater which is no use if you don't have a version of Sib 6.0.0, which is why I asked for a torrent link in an earlier post..."
,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-08-09T11:09Z,"Forget my last post, it's not an updater, (I was confusing this with a different torrent), but it is a legitimate file, it's a unix file which lives in Contents/MacOS directory of the Sib app."

...hope you got the trick"
,alxfitting,2009-08-12T05:15Z,"...oh! and don't forget to read the comments, good luck!!"
,alxfitting,2009-08-12T05:21Z,"I'm sorry!! now I realize, if you are a mac user, this link above is useless..."
