Norton Ghost v11.5 AutoBoot Installer.

This is just a stripped down version of Hiren's Boot CD 9.9 for the Ghost 11.5, based on the previous upload of VietLion that wasn't working very well. Modified some files to make it work as expected.

This program copies all the necessary files in your C: partition and modifies the Boot.ini adding an extra menu voice at startup, allowing to run the DOS version of Norton Ghost 11.5 directly from your HD, without having to use bootable CDs or USB Keys.

Doesn't work on Vista or Windows7 as they don't use the Boot.ini.

All credits and thanks go to the unknown people that has made those files, I've just assembled the whole in a working fashion.




CAUTION!!!CAUTION!!!CAUTION!!!CAUTION!!!CAUTION!!!CAUTION!!!
Doesn't work on all the PCs! On my Desktop works fine, while on the Laptop it doesn't boot from the image on HD. If you are lucky OK, if not, sorry, and go back to floppies, CD and USB Keys...

It requires also a little bit of knowledge on using Ghost and handling hidden files. During installation it creates a copy of boot.ini that can be used later if anything goes wrong. If you are unsure about this, try to find help from someone more expert or don't use it. You have been warned!!!
WARNING!!!WARNING!!!WARNING!!!WARNING!!!WARNING!!!WARNING!!!




The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built up on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 machine or other versions of Windows. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
