Now i just have to try and learn how to play it, im new to strategy games, but love anything to do with WW2 battles so should be fun.

Thanks."
,locopower,2010-02-13T14:50Z,does this game require TOW I installed ?
,VDB1,2010-02-13T15:30Z,"No, its the sequel so its a standalone. No need for TOW I. This is a good game and it works properly."
,Superbus,2010-02-17T22:42Z,"We need the Centauro add on and the newest one Kursk.

Please"
,TheBigHase,2010-03-01T11:38Z,"That's affirmative! Awseome game and really wanting more , the Kursk demo is  simply mouthwatering! Thx if someone will do that! Oh and thx a lot for this too! I never been a fan of games like these but this a good mixture of genres with also awesome graphics  and effects! Nice and recommended! :-)"
,TheBigHase,2010-03-01T19:36Z,"It's nice BUT only small content (?) and how to turn off the damned ""smart pause"" which is really annoying!? It is possibily though in other TOW !? WTF!?"
,Dutch_Men,2010-04-05T14:11Z,Please seed ! at first it went fast with 20 seeders but now i've got 0 seeders!
,HableHable,2010-06-24T15:45Z,"Can't friggin play one mission without it CRASHING, terminating on exit. My system does NOT crash without there being something wrong with the files. I loved the previous games, but this is just silly."
,HableHable,2010-06-24T16:25Z,And the mission edit DOES NOT WORK...
,sotiris009,2011-03-22T15:59Z,I hope this torrent works!!!I REALLY want this game!!!

,kolokythis,2011-08-26T20:02Z,"Actually, I figured out that Skidrow released Centauro as Battle of Caen (you can find it in TPB) and battle of Caen as Centauro lol."
,godfathr123,2011-11-26T02:43Z,ok where do i put the things in the skidrow folder because i put then in the actual game folder and it says i need the license to play the game someone help :/
