This is a big story. It's an attempt by the Illuminati, working through their number one propaganda production factory, the Tavistock Institute in the City of London, to create the illusion that the world is rapidly running out of oil and within a few short years, we will experience unemployemnt, wars, famine, and all manner of horrendous strife as a result of the fallout from the now ""rapdily vanishing"" oil supplies. It's a scam from top to bottom. If you've noticed that gasoline prices are beginning to rise at gas pumps across America, you can thank this deception for that jump in gas prices and you can also expect those gasoline prices to continue to rise over time and possibly remain at unprecedented high levels from here on out, UNLESS enough Americans wake up to this deceit and demand an end to it.

There are large numbers of people out there trying to promote this scam through books, articles, lectures, films, television and talk radio. In America, Michael Ruppert of From the Wilderness is apparently the lead disinformation meister of this flimflam. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now is a Ford Foundation & Rockefeller Foundation funded Left Gatekeeper who, with her brother, have joined with Ruppert to not only promote the Peak Oil scam, but is a regular propagandist for the Global Warming hoax fronted by Illuminatus Al Gore.

KPFK radio, a 100,000 kilowatt FM radio station out of Los Angeles, is one of the five national radio outlets owned by the Pacifica Foundation and has been unrelentingly hammering out the Peak Oil and Global Warming propagnada mantras since Ruppert kicked off this Tavistock-hatched disinformation campaing in 2004.

The only two people, that I am aware of, with any sizeable readership who have been trying to expose these outrageous lies and monstrous distortions of the facts are Dave McGowan through his newsletters and Joe Vialls in articles published at this web site. I'll use this page to post articles from writers and researchers who are trying to expose this pretense, starting with Dave McGowan and Joe Vialls. (Update: Jan 21, 2004. Found a good article exposing Ruppert from Patrick Mooney of www.unlearning.org).

,LoboSolitario666,2011-06-30T00:49Z,How can anyone not believe that the easy oil is gone and that we will have declining energy supplies in the next few decades? People think fossil fuels will last forever?
,butttfukirr9,2012-04-19T22:19Z,"These people who deny the truth rely on the fact they belive most people can't think beyond the end of their nose and are totally incapable of doing simple exponential aritmetic that hundreds and thousands of scientists all across the world have done for decades. Do it yourself. Allof earth resources that we extract are being replenished whenever we take a billion barrels of oil a dau out of the ground. When your own governement has to stage an event so horrific to get you to hate muslims & arabs in order to cheerlead them on-why wold they do that? For shits & giggles? We have a military presence now in every region of the world where there are the last remaining reserves of oil left untouched. That's why we created a new military comand structure called, ""Africon"". That's because they found some small oil resrves north of Uganda. That's what Kony 2012 is all about. Justification to put outr military in when you research the source of ""Invisible children hatched out of the White House War Room"".

Get smart people and start reading up on human istory & top down hierarchies of human societies who use military forces to exploit resources for maxiizing productin for the accumulation of wealth for a distict class of elites. This planet cannot continue to support 7 billion peole and counting-"

Correction: Natural Resources like oil, are not, again, ""Not"" being replenished for reasons that should not need any elaboration unless your of the type who denies peak oil is a farce because there is a sub-surface brand of space aliens who are grinding up sub-surface rock & turning it into liquid oil all over the planet in order for us to keep drilling holes until the cows come home. 

That's how fucking stupid they think you are in believing oil will continue to fuel a billion automobiles expected to double by 2030. 

All one has to remember has the primary motivation of nearly everything that is said & done is based on the accumulation of money. 

Those that speak of peak oil make no money, but only warn you of the truth to come.

Those who deny it have an ax to grind because alternative energy paradigms of how we live to throw off the culture of empire means less money in their bank accounts, and thus will say whatever they have to keep business as usual flowing into their coffers.

In today's world, if one has not figured that much out by now, youâre fucked anyway, because it means your not cognitively capable of fighting your way out of a paper bag, even when given a squirt gun."
