Downloaded the trail and compared to any other .ts .mts2 converters this has the most functionality and customization, its just perfect. 

thanks so much, works perfectly. the crack works fine with the already installed trail. 

THANK YOU!"

Your welcome, and enjoy it. 
BTW: Maybe your torrents are worth a pink skull .... well, who knows ........ :) "
[V],McTav,2009-08-01T06:25Z,"haha, i was beyond stoked when i saw this torrent, ive been trying to find a cracked version of this for like a week, and i figured ill try just one more time before i buy. and bam!

and yea i try my best with torrents, im not really very social on here but i know my torrents are good and i see a lot of skulls around but never really thought to much about it. as long as people download em i put em up ;P"

,TLARAYO,2009-12-19T05:06Z,i love this converter do any1 have the crack version but for mac?...
,WolfeJ,2010-01-12T00:27Z,"amazing converter for anyone needing one.  one of the coolest things I've seen is the ability to control how much cpu resource it will consume e.g. max 50%, 60%, 70% . . . 100%"
