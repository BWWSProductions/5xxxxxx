If you know who he is there is no explanation needed. For those who haven't Voltaire makes some very good goth-folk-rock like music with offten funny lyrics. I've enjoyed his music since I've found out about it and didn't see a torrent of his music so I thought I would make one. This is also my first torrent upload so I hope Ive done everything right....
