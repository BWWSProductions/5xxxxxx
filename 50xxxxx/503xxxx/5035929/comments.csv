,MacaroonAvenue,2010-06-24T11:32Z,"I absolutely love this guy. He's really small-time, at least was when I saw him at Dragon*Con, but hew's easily one of the most entertaining live shows I've ever seen. Just he and his guitar had more stage presence than most bands ever do - and he kept us all in stitches.

I highly recommend BUYING at least one of his albums, he deserves it big time. I'm downloading this myself only 'cuz I left my collection down in Georgia. Oops. : /"
