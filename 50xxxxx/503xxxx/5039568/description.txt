Priit PÃ¤rn (born 26 August 1946 in Tallinn) is an Estonian cartoonist and animation director whose films have enjoyed success among critics as well as the public at various film festivals.

PÃ¤rn's (who used to be working as a plant ecologist) career in animation began when he accepted Rein Raamat's proposal to make a design for The Gothamites (1974). After a brief apprenticeship in Joonisfilm, he directed his first film Is the Earth Round? in 1977.

PÃ¤rn's most important films are considered to be Triangle (1982), Breakfast on the Grass (1987), Hotel E (1991), 1895 (co-directed by Janno PÃµldma, 1995) and Night of the Carrots (1998).

PÃ¤rn's style is charactericed by black humour, playful surrealism and a unique graphical style. His somewhat crude style marked the departure from both Rein Raamat's overtly serious and moralizing films as well as the Disneyesque style propagated by the directors of Soyuzmultfilm. In his footsteps (and occasionally copying his style to a large degree) have followed numerous new generation Estonian film makers, most notably Ãœlo Pikkov and Priit Tender.

Influences of PÃ¤rn's graphical style can be also be seen in such commercial animated series as Rugrats and AAAHH!!! Real Monsters!.

In 2002 PÃ¤rn was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Animated Film Association.
