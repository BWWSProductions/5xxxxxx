Hello Foamers

Here is a prepackaged/precompiled version of OpenFOAM-1.6 and Paraview-3.6.1.

This is all built from source, no prepackaged binaries.

The Thirdparty folder have been striped for any source-code and only the binary/lib files are remaining.

---------------- Included ----------------
- Qt-4.5.2

- OpenFOAM 1.6 (flex, mpfr and gmp built from source)

- Paraview 3.6.1 and its dependencies.
- Built with qt-4.5.2, OpenFOAM version of openmpi. ffmpeg support (export to avi), and parallezied support for decomposed cases.


---------------- Install Instructions for the whole package ----------------

0. First you need to install the gcc and c++ compiler which is shipped with CentOS 5.3 - yum install gcc gcc-c++ (needed to compile not already precompiled OpenFOAM solvers, or your own solvers)

1. Place the content of libraries.tar.gz into /usr/local and accept overwriting existing folders. The package contains the compiled libraries/executable of gmp. mpfr, flex and ffmpeg. if this step is skipped you wont be able to compile the OF extra solvers.

2. Unpack the content of OpenFOAM.tar.gz to /usr/local, this package contains the compiled libraries/executable which the Allmake command produces. The package also contains the Thirdparty applications needed by OpenFOAM.

3. Put this line in your own .bashrc file.

    . /usr/local/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-1.6/etc/bashrc

restart console or source the bashrc $ . ~/.bashrc

to check if it works try

    $ which gcc

this should output the following

    $ /usr/local/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-1.6/gcc-4.3.3/platforms/linux64/bin/gcc

The Qt-4.5.2.tar.gz is an extra, which is only needed if you consider recompiling paraview, or some other app which depends on Qt.

It is possible to install to another location other than /usr/local, all you have to do is to modify you own .bashrc file, the bashrc in OpenFOAM (/usr/local/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-1.6/etc/bashrc) and possibly also the settings.sh file to point to the right directories.

---------------- Disclaimer ----------------
The package has been verified on a fresh minimal gnome install of CentOS 5.3 64bit

The package is "as is" and can only be guaranteed to work with a 64bit version of CentOS/RedHat/Scientific 5.3 (yum update is fine). Or if in a cluster environment Rocks 5.2 (based on CentOS 5.3).

If other distributions are used, I can't help you.
