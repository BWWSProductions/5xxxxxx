Jai (Saif Ali Khan) and Meera (Deepika Padukone) are a couple in London who live for today with each other and not for each other. Passion evades Jai while Veer is full of it. Expressions change but love remains and absence makes the heart fonder â€“ these are a few lines of thought the movie explores.
