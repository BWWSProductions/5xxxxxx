This intellectual new-wave style comedy finds passengers on an airplane each with a story of their own. One woman represents Pandora, and the box opens to pollute the world with male-dominated foibles; a nun can't agree with the church's embracing of current political figures and philosophy; and a married woman allows herself to fantasize about a fellow passenger. Alienation among humans is a reoccurring theme in this revealing and unusual feature.
