,freewillly,2009-10-10T17:12Z,Quite possibly the greatest album ever. This one will live on and on and on. You will be hearing it when you are old.

,jaburns82,2010-02-09T15:58Z,"is it me, or is creature fear (track 6) cut short?  It's too bad too because it seems like it's just building up."
,colorsme,2010-03-06T15:02Z,"jaburns82, I downloaded the track again to make sure and it is the correct length, 3:05. It does seem like it's cut off but that's just because it was made to lead into the next track on the album. :)"
