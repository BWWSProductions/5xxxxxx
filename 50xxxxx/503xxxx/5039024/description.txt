"Funny the Way It Is" is the first single from Dave Matthews Band's album Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King. Matthews said that it "talks about the world of opposites that we are in."  The single has reached #37 on the Billboard Hot 100, #22 on the Modern Rock Tracks, and #17 on the Hot Digital Songs chart in its first week of release.

The song was also released as a free download on the band's website.

Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King is the seventh studio album by Dave Matthews Band (DMB), which was released by RCA Records on June 2, 2009.

It is the band's first studio album since 2005's Stand Up and the first release since the death of saxophonist LeRoi Moore. Guitarist Tim Reynolds played on the album, marking his first recording with DMB since 1998â€™s Before These Crowded Streets. Rashawn Ross makes his first appearance on a DMB studio album since joining as a regular touring member in 2006 as well as Jeff Coffin, who has taken Moore's role since June 2008. The album was the first to be produced by Rob Cavallo, and first single on this album has been made available on their website.

The album is the second major release by Dave Matthews Band with a vinyl edition. Before These Crowded Streets is the only other album to have been released on that medium, albeit in a limited number.

The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 424,000 copies in its first week of release. This made it the groups fifth-straight studio set to open with a sales week of at least 400,000 copies.
