and the best of all, it's COMPLETELY FREE."

,deejus,2009-09-24T02:19Z,"Serial numbers wont work. When you enter the numbers, it tries to establish a connection to the company website to verify the serial number. If you deny it access, it wont register, and if you allow it internet access, it says the numbers are invalid."
,deejus,2009-09-24T02:41Z,"My mistake, I tried the serial from the keygen on the wrong version of the program. The serials work for this version, so all is well.

Thanks for the upload."

,Freitzehn,2009-10-02T19:20Z,"The program doesn't work on 64 bit applications, and the keygen won't generate a valid serial key for the program you can download off their website.

In other words, don't waste your time if you're using a 64 bit os"
