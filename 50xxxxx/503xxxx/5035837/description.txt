This is my first torrent upload. I couldn't find this movie anywhere else on the internet, so I thought I'd share it here. Not the best zombie flick, but, you know.. whatever.

Any comments would be appreciated :-)

The story: 

Toro gets paid by the Catholic church to kill zombies. A video crops up of him doing nasty things to little boys, and the church is forced to fire him. Toro then goes on a binge of sin and moves to the jungle to get away from society. His replacement quickly gets gobbled up by the zombies, and Toro's old army buddy injects him with some super-drug that makes him a badass zombie hunter once again.
