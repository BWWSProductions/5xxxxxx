,Goldencadi,2009-10-30T19:52Z,"Thanks for the up. The quality is mp4 so the video is 6/10 or so- about what you'd expect from a good quality VHS. I have a higher resolution display so it may bug me more than others. The audio is 10/10, with no sync issues at all. Plus it downloaded in an hour or so, so there's no complaints. Overall, a good quality rip"
