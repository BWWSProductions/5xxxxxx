,goduke150,2009-08-01T15:06Z,@rajiv_1 Hah! An .avi containing a trojan. Nice. Good luck with that one.
,Haunted1,2009-08-01T17:46Z,who said that the trojan was in the avi file?
,Haunted1,2009-08-01T18:45Z,"I should add that I am NOT saying that these files are infected and I dont think they are, but you can embed a trojan within an avi file.

,MyKingdomHeart,2009-08-03T18:19Z,"@iSeshan

So are you saying these movies are already on Dvd but are leaked?"
,IanMelrose,2009-08-03T20:24Z,"@Mykingdomheart

Yep, either leaked or been distributed in a different country, normally leaked"

,EAKendalP,2009-08-04T04:05Z,"Ok I just watched this torrent movie and I thought I'd fill in the blanks that most of you as myself is/was wondering.

A: 9
V: 9

This is a Real DVDRip not a cam or anything else. Movie in General is worth watching but X-man fans might not be to happy.

This MAX guy seams to be a new nick to the family and he is doing as well as FXG and aXXo.

He/she/it seams to be working in 2 ways for 2 differante ""customers"". 

One is this aka: MAX witch delivers DVDRip movies att good qualety. The Second one is MAXSPEED, witch delivers what is called DVDSCR witch basicly is the best CAM Versions you can gett. There for the name of SPEED seance they will be delivered first.

To other intrsessts it looks like aXXo yett again has gone missing and FXG might have aswel for now, leaving this MAX in there place and it might be because all the pirasy fuzz that is letting the go off the hett for a bit or maby they are all the same ;)


Hope I cleared somthings out.             /EAKendalP"

Seeder number is not the only thing that effects speed.
4 instance, torrent with Seeders 5000 leechers 12000 is much slower than the one with 1000 seeders and 800 leechers.
It's just one instance, as I said, many other things relevant to download speed."
,tjanevski,2009-08-05T20:13Z,its dvdrip allright. Exellent quality. Good work
,iSeshan,2009-08-05T22:42Z,"@MyKingdomHeart Yes, they are already on DVD, but some one has taken one that is sitting in a ware house and ripped it for our viewing pleasure.


Anyways, This is the real DVD rip not the half finished leaked. 

But it is a crappy movie and the CGI is horrible and the green screens are badly done (people said the same things when it was in the theater) Download if you don't care about the badly done CGI and Green screens."
,iSeshan,2009-08-05T22:46Z,"@novakovama

This is the final copy, the leaked one before didn't have half the CGI done, this one does, but it's just badly done. Witch makes it look unfinished."

,amikron,2009-10-10T20:43Z,"Why lowpass on the audio? Don't ask the uploader because this is one of many stolen torrents re-labeled as if they are the group that released them. You might get good d/l speed (probably not) but this isn't their work.

Thank you for the up all the same but don't be an axxo guys, at least tag it with who actually did the work."
,amikron,2009-10-10T20:45Z,"Also love the bit about ""copyright"", yea, Sigismunt, I am sure you have the copyright for X-men Origins Wolverine, and Hugh Jackman is probably blowing you right now, well the later part might be true, never know how he might roll."
