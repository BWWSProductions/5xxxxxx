Plot:
A suburban couple take a weekend vacation in the hopes of repairing their relationship. What they don't know is that when they mess with nature, Nature will bite them back. They set out to an isolated beach where they encounter nature's revenge. Stomping around nature, Peter and Carla's tactless ways raise the ire of the local wildlife, which torture the duo with strange occurrences and vicious attacks. Eager to bolt once the reality of violence sets in, the couple furiously tries to abandon the campsite, but nature has other plans for hapless pair.
