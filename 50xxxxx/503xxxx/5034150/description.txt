This was a really silly version of Raymond Chandler's novel Farewell My Lovely. Apparently, there was a series of movies featuring Leslie Charteris' character, The Saint, in the late 30s and early 40s. It was so popular that another studio decided to create their own hero, The Falcon. The series even starred George Sanders, who had played The Saint. He starred in three of the films, then his brother took over. This was the second one, and although it is not really awful, it was painfully silly. If you want to see a version of Chandler's novel, see the 1944 film Murder My Sweet. If you want an empty good time, watch this one.

Moose Malloy (Ward Bond) is a thug recently released from prison who likes to snap people's necks with his apelike strength. He is looking for his old girlfriend, and goes to a club where she used to work. He runs into Goldy Lock (Allen Jenkins), the sidekick to Gay Lawrence, a.k.a. the Falcon (Sanders). When Moose kills the manager because he won't tell him where his girl is, he takes Goldy hostage and uses his car as a getaway. Predictably, The Falcon is intrigued, and instead of going the other way, he investigates. See, he's not just a handsome playboy. He's also an American Sherlock Holmes. He and Goldy try to figure out where Moose is hiding as the bodies pile up, and The Falcon realizes that another case he's involved in, to recover a stolen necklace, is tied up with Moose too.

We watched this in my Film Noir class along with the much better Murder My Sweet to show the difference between film noir and other films based on the same material. This one was notably more upbeat, despite the murders. It also featured characters who could only be included for comedy relief. It reminded me of some sitcoms on television, the ones that make you laugh, but you can't remember any of the jokes an hour later.
