Only the music and effects of the action sequences. The narration of this documentary is gone after 26 minutes.  Please re-do this file if you can. It is otherwise good but we need to know the whole history of Vlad."

I have looked at this file again and it is fine. I thoroughly check all my uploads before they enter the public domain and this was no different.

It always makes me chuckle when people just assume that it is a problem with someone else. It never seems to occur to them that it might be a problem down there end!

Oh well, such is life!

PS. GOM player is now reckoned to be the best computer based application for viewing files. It can handle a couple more formats than vlc player and also has the benefit of allowing you to watch a file before it has been fully downloaded. 

Therefore you can download, say, 25% of this file and then check it. Obviously there will be gaps but it helps to look at quality before you download the whole file.

Just google GOM, it is a free application!"
