Indie 69 Rock Pop Playlist August 2009.

The Saintly Edition.

I was really rushed at the end there, so if I got any dupes, so VERY
sorry for it. I ran into some technical problems and at the end had to replace
several tracks I loved due to potential issues with the tracks themselves.
It wasn't DRM, but it was odd. Files unprotected but unchangeable, not read
only yet I could not alter the id tags. Very strange. Fixed, more tracks added
and here it is for your listening pleasures.

There are some leftovers from last month that would not fit but I really liked
(about 5 or 6) and STILL it was a hard month for finding new music, at least
for me. In the end it all worked out.

For the love of the music, if you fall in love with a track, seek out the
album or track and purchase it. Or go see a show. FUN. is on tour!! That
should be a fun, sing-along show. Look for me in the front singing along.
(if I leave the cave long enough.. and I can find SPF-5200 sunblock)

Summer has come, and it feels like it's almost over. This one went by far
too fast. Enjoy what's left of it and I hope you don't hear the circus music
in your sleep.

No bonus tracks, no videos this month. But if youthe artists here,
I know for sure you'll find some pretty amazing stuff.

For those who I have been in touch with over the past few months, sorry for
being such a hermit. And thanks for the suggestions, invitations, tracks.

And BIG thanks to all the others who do playlists, I download and I listen
and I love them all. (when will we get our Criznittle back????)

I love comments, suggestions, rants and criticisms. Leave them at your
favorite torrent site under my torrents and I'll be sure to read and 
respond.

Until September, keep your feet off the ground and keep reaching for the
cookie jar.
