In the near future, eight astronauts from five countries (four women and four men) undertake a mysterious six-year international space mission covering thirteen billion kilometres. With the eyes of the world upon them - everything they do is monitored, and every emotion they feel, scrutinized - they soon discover that their real assignment is not at all what they thought. "

,greylion,2009-08-03T20:15Z,Isn't this b0rken at 36:22?
,sumdumnam,2009-08-03T23:17Z,"indeed, glitched at 36:22 for ~10 seconds.  video & sound seem fine after 36:35 or so."
,zen-TAO,2009-08-04T12:55Z,"Thanks.
I Know its a Pilot. But today there
are so many shows that it must
grab me hard right from the start.
It doesnt.
If I want a show that goes: bla, bla, bla,
bla, bla, bla...
I watch the news or something.. Not a brand new sci-fi show.

Exellent Sfi-fi for me is for example Star Trek, Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica, where the humans fight a superior enemy like the Borg, Cylons or the Shadows.

Where the action is, if you understand what I mean?

Peace and Love!"

,DozyB,2009-08-10T12:21Z,"A little too much Grey's Anatomy-ish bullshit romance drama for a sci-fi series!  What can you expect from the dude who helped create that piece of shit ""Medical"" drama, anyway.

Hurry up, Caprica!!!!  Let's get some Cylon ass-kicking goin' on!  I don't need ""Grey's Anatomy In Space.""
