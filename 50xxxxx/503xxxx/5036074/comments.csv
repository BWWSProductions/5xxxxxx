,WatermanInk,2010-09-02T20:19Z,Great quality! Too bad there's not more spoken languages though.
,ZeRaWaKH,2010-09-13T18:27Z,Great release but multiple RARs->ISO->VOBs seems a little unnecessary. Why not just spread the VOB files as they are? Lots of burner programs are capable of burning a DVD-video compliant disc from the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS folders. The error correction in the BitTorrent protocol will ensure the files get to their destination error-free.
