,p5yk0tik,2009-08-10T06:32Z,"I had problems with this release. The sound randomly comes and goes during levels, and the tutorial pages skip thru to the end at each bunch of them, and it will not let you reverse through the pages - weird stuff.
This PC easily meets required specs.
Will be checking out :
