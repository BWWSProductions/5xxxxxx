Storyline: ALIENS IN THE ATTIC, co-scripted by one of the writers of 
"Madagascar" and the Academy AwardÂ®-winning "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit," is an 
adventure/comedy about kids on a family vacation who must fight off an attack by knee-high alien 
invaders with world-destroying ambitions. At the same time, the youngsters work hard to keep their 
parents in the dark about the battle upstairs.It's the Pearsons versus the aliens who "came from upstairs," 
in an all-out battle that will decide the fate of the Earth - and kick-off the ultimate summer vacation.
It all starts as a meteor shower rockets across the dark galaxy. Four glowing pods sparkle and crackle 
while hiding behind the meteor show. A mysterious force makes the meteor shower turn a hard right 
towards a bright blue ball in the distance - planet Earth.
In a comfortable suburban house in Michigan, Stuart Pearson (Kevin Nealon) and his wife Nina (Gillian Vigman)
head a family that includes adorable seven-year-old Hannah (Ashley Boettcher); 15-year-old Tom 
(Carter Jenkins), a techno-geek whose grades have gone south; and big sister Bethany (Ashley Tisdale), 
who's just returned from a secret outing with boyfriend Ricky Dillman (Robert Hoffman).
Deciding the family needs some good old-fashioned togetherness, Tom packs up the clan and heads 
to a three-story holiday house in the middle of nowhere. Joining them is Uncle Nate (Andy Richter), 
Nate's son Jake (Austin Butler), dear old Nana Rose (Doris Roberts), and identical 12-year-old twins 
Art (Henri Young) and Lee (Regan Young). An unexpected arrival is Bethany's beau Ricky, who wrangles 
an overnight visit with the extended family.
