spoken language: Russian
subtitles: English (.srt)


Lev Atamanov's masterpiece remains a classic of Soviet animation and one of the most beautiful animated fairy tales of all times. Hayao Miyazaki has stated that this movie is one of his inspirations to work in animation.

This is the *original Russian language* restored version DVDRip of the edition:

Krupnyy Plan, September 13, 2004 (R5, PAL)("full restoration of image and sound").
Included films: "The Snow Queen", "New Years' Eve" (1948).

This is not my rip. I have included English subtitles (.srt) for "The Snow Queen" but the 10-minute animated short "New Years' Eve" is without subtitles.
