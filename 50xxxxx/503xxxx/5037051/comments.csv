STAY CLEAR!"
,aniaki,2010-02-21T09:53Z,"There is nothing wrong with the MKV files. I've been watching season 2 with these files and they are perfectly watchable with good sound quality. The files are 128mb, instead of the usual 350mb. That is great for those of us that don't have a huge download limit or are watching faster than the episodes can be downloaded (like me).

MKV files may work on VLC player. If not, then you can download MKV player from here: http://www.vsevensoft.com/mkv-player.html"

,rayxofxsunshine,2010-06-08T02:11Z,"Good quality vids. The audio is off by a little bit on most videos - changing the track sync to +0.2 or +0.3 seems to fix it (On VLC player, go to Tools, Track Synchronization, and then hit the up arrow 2 or 3 times under Audio/Video)"

,Aimar55555,2011-03-13T20:32Z,"MKV are best played on the Media Player Classic with the MKV Codec.

MPC is lightweight portable player that uses external codec which can be found inside your own system. This means that when ever you have a file that you cant play with a Player you could just download the codecs, Im using MPC for all video files. Theere hasnt been a file that I couldnt play with it. ;-)"
