Hey everyone,

Just wanted to thank everyone so far who has signed up at http://www.BlalocksIRP.com Already 300+ members there and the users are posting good music in the forums everyday so if some of you guys haven't checked it out yet be sure to do that. 

Also, we just started http://blalocksindierockplaylist.tumblr.com where any of you guys can add music or videos to it. Be sure to go there, it post's the submitted comment every two hours so there is always something new there.  

Just received a couple more mixes recently! Thanks to everyone who has sent them. Also sent a couple more out within the last week, hope you guys enjoy them.  I'm still trading so if anyones interested in trading mixes please email me at joshblalock@gmail.com 

A little larger list than normal this time around but there just so much to choose from. I'm sure you guys don't mind. :) 

I guess I'll quit typing now so you guys can stop reading and start listening to some music.

Hope you guys enjoy the list.

And as always thanks to: Ag3mo, Conrad Duncker, Outroversion
