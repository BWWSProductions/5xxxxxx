,bhvn52,2009-08-18T16:37Z,"Thanks for the reply!
You put me on the right track:
I had to find out that the burning wasn't the problem, but the reading of the burned disk. After installing UDF 2.5 driver now I can read the movie.
So it's NOT a fake :)."
,WillisCross,2009-09-01T02:51Z,Any help on what to do with the ISO? I can't open it/mount it or do anything with it with power ISO or extract the files...
