,dastar101,2009-07-31T16:22Z,I'm having problems with this. I follow the readme and everything appears to be fine as when I access the music store it says all songs are purchased but when I go to download them again it says I do not have enough memory on the wii system or SD card when I know for a fact I do as there is hardly anything else on the Wii memory apart from the save game and the SD card is 2GB and only has your apps on it. Do you know how to fix this? BTW Im using a backup copy of rock band 2 if that helps.
,cf2007a,2009-07-31T19:33Z,"As far as i know this is only for nstc consoles

PAL users, here is what you need to do, this has been confirmed to work


1. Delete your Account in the Wii Shop Channel
2. Using Any Region Changer, change your Wii Shop Code to U.S.
3. Load up the shop channel at least once
4. Proceed to install the hack

IMPORTANT: You will lose all previous content that you have bought (wiiware/virtual console/dlc)

This has been reported as working, but this is not recommended unless you know what you are doing.
Do this at your own risk, if you know what you are doing, you should be fine, and able to download.
PAL users have an answer!

,dastar101,2009-07-31T22:44Z,Thank you very much this works brilliantly :D
,unacquaintedtodownload,2009-08-03T03:00Z,"Thanks, I believe I mentioned the 'Wii Memory' issue in the last version, I didn't get chance to see the answer though.

Much appreciated, Will try the technique.

Will the sotre bought content be re-available if you change the region back to E?"
,ddrsensation,2009-08-03T21:16Z,"Completely confused by step 2 in the readme. (There might be an error, but that's normal).
Do we keep trying the wads until they DON'T get an error, or just go on. (I'm assuming just keep trying cuz it only purchased the newest dlc in the store as of 8/04/09 (rise against pack)), so idunnolol."
,HairyBallsagna,2009-08-06T06:25Z,If u get error 1017 while installing its fine continue on to install the other wads.
,unacquaintedtodownload,2009-08-07T00:47Z,"I've tried the method for PAL users.
Anyregion changer
changed shop channel to ""49""
read the eula

Loaded the shop channel and it said that it was usa channel, that I'd lost my old stuff and that it was  a new account, but it couldn't connect to the internet, so I tried RB2 and it also said there was no internet conncetion."
,unacquaintedtodownload,2009-08-07T20:39Z,"I skipped step #1
Ignore me"
,LunaticHigh,2009-08-08T10:24Z,"Thanks!

I just installed this and works great, but just one question. I only got about half the songs; is that expected or did I mess up installing the one of the wads?"
,shorza,2009-08-10T16:57Z,"Great!

Worked for my PAL console."
,sickmusick,2009-09-06T09:29Z,"I run IOS37 patcher and everything's fine, it says system has been patched. But then I run WAD installer and after pressing ""load"" the screen just goes blank. Tried this a couple of times and it just does the same. Can you help? My Wii is NTSC. Tx."
,sickmusick,2009-09-08T06:30Z,"Update: I replaced the WAD installer with Waninkoko's latest WAD manager and everything worked great.

LunaticHigh, I also ran into the problem you mention (only part of the songs appeared as purchased). The key is, you need to NOT have any downloaded songs in your SD card, otherwise it will not work. Delete the songs you have in the card (you may backup them to your HD) along with the folders (which are named same as the WADs), uninstall the WADs and reinstall them and voilรก! All songs appear as purchased!

Hope this helps. Cheers."
,regtek,2009-12-30T04:42Z,I have a modified Wii that cannot connect to the Internet. What do I have to download/install in order to use your RB2 DLCs? Thanks!
,NDesaster,2010-01-12T06:02Z,"Thank you so much! Works perfectly and quickly and unlocks the vast majority of the library, including the Breaking Benjamin songs, which is what I was really hoping for.  Thanks for the awesome crack and torrent!"
,NDesaster,2010-01-12T06:03Z,"Also, @regtek, this isn't the DLC songs, this is a crack that makes them available.  You have to have internet to download them."

,frizkie8,2010-04-21T02:07Z,README says that it doesn't work with USB loaders but mine works fine with Wiiflow on 4.2U NTSC.
