,SPPeaR,2011-06-11T11:57Z,"people, do NOT download this, all he did is download the songs videos and convert to mp3, resulting in quality equal to 128 kbps or worse(i own some of these tracks and there is a significant quality difference);
 to get 320s, use mp3drug.com"
,SPPeaR,2011-06-11T11:59Z,"player says theyre in 320 kbps, but the real quality is FAR below that"
,LiamTorrents,2011-08-03T15:55Z,bad quality!...
