Ok shipmates, here's the deal.

I have a ton (about 6-8) of brand new, never posted - hence the reason I bought them - GGW videos, but my upload speed is slower than Hitler on an accounting exam.

Here's my plan: I'll upload one at a time.. but to hopefully speed things up, I've posted the files on a site that "Shares Rapidly".

I'll post the links in a comment. If anyone with faster upload speed can download the video and unrar (pwd is ggw), then place the avi in your torrent folder - just the file, not the folder, that would be awesome.

After you put the file in your torrent folder, download the torrent file from here, and utorrent will say that you have the file already, and it'll ask you if you want to use existing file information - say yes - and the status should jump to 100% right away.

If some people can help me out with that, it'll greatly decrease the time it takes to seed a video... as soon as there are 5 or so seeders for a video, I'll go ahead and put the next one up.

Sorry to make this so complicated, but I promise that it'll be worth it!

Btw, if you don't trust my uploads, feel free to check out my previous ups at

I forgot my password to that account so I had to create this one.
