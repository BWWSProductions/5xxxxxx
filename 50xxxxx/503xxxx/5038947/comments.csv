[T],insinuendo,2009-08-22T22:51Z,"can any of the 67 seeders comment on quality. is this bluray quality 720p?

please."
,tango4717,2009-08-25T20:28Z,"The are HDTV rips.  They've been down-converted to 624x352.  They use xvid and mp3 for codecs.   

The reason the file size is higher than average is because the playtime is around 50 mins + per episode, as compared to 40 mins for a network show.

Blu-ray rips are usually MKV files, and would run around 1.5 gigs per episode.

This torrent is mis-labeled and shouldn't be called 'high-res.'  The quality is fine, it's just not high-res."

Displays on my tv as some zoomed smaller ratio of the widescreen, and then after watching for a bit the scene just cut to the next abruptly.. Still watchable but if you're looking for perfect, this isn't it. But still fine. Just pointing out what it's like."
,dlldmn,2009-10-30T22:23Z,"Oh yeah and it wouldn't adjust to fit the widescreen properly.. Could only leave it zoomed to semi-fit the screen, but meh, free is free."
,dlldmn,2009-11-01T08:18Z,"Scratch that being snappy from scene to scene.. that's just how the episode was, sorry uploader..

but I do still stand by the odd display on my tv.. messed up. Still watchable!!"
