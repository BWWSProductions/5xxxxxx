W.C. Fields and Me (1976) 

The Universal Pictures release begins in 1924 in New York City, where W.C. Fields is a Ziegfeld Follies headliner, and ends with his 1946 death in California at the age of 66. In between, it dramatizes his life and career with emphasis on the latter part of both, when the Me of the title played a prominent role, with a number of fictionalized events added for dramatic impact.
