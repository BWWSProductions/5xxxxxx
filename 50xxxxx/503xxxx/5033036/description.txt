Yuda (Anthony Wong) is a Chinese expatriate living in Sao Paulo, Brazil with his adopted son Kirin (Joe Odagiri). Yuda is the head of a profitable but illegal business enterprise, selling cheap counterfeit versions of popular consumer products, and Kirin is one of his right-hand men. Yuda has used his contacts with the police and the local mafia to stay one step ahead of the law, but most of his alliances are fickle and Yudaâ€™s underground empire begins to falter when heâ€™s betrayed by a rival and ends up in jail. Kirin steps up to take control of Yudaâ€™s business and ruthlessly sets out to eliminate those who turned against them, but Yuda is unhappy with the violence and corruption that has come to dominate his life and wonâ€™t support Kirin when heâ€™s back on the street.
