iRipDVD (v1.0b7) is an high-quality easy to use (3-pass) direct DVD (or VOB-file) to MPEG4 (DivX5 compatible, MP3 ABR audio track) ripper/converter/encoder based on mplayer/mencoder.

You can't find this tool in the net, nor on version tracker or macupdate.com.
The developer was forced to take it from the net.

that's the lastest beta-version avalaible for Mac (it should also work on Leo, Tiger etc.)

your chance to download it from piratebay yet.

best wishes
