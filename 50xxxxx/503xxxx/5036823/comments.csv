Wodehouse's humor will never ever get old.
Been a great admirer of his works since I could read, almost!
Are there any other Wodehouse works in video around?"
,ee9,2010-04-11T15:05Z,cool thing!
[V],rambam1776,2010-05-06T12:33Z,brilliant - thank you
,mattyg05,2010-05-07T21:01Z,"Been watching the re-runs of this on tv. Love it. Thought I would try and find te collection, and I have. Thank you. Will let you know quality once downloaded. Will seed for as long as possible too. 
Definitly a good intro into the works of Wodehouse."
,antininja,2010-05-21T21:21Z,"This is one of the great overlooked comedies of Britsh television.  Fry and Laurie at their finest, with a PG Wodehouse script that could have been written specifically for them.  So great to see it again."
,RALSTON8358,2010-07-06T05:34Z,Many thanks!
,OrpheusDude,2010-10-02T02:10Z,These are in .mkv format.  You should let people know.  Thanks anyway.

,zoffenaa,2011-09-10T04:36Z,"Looking forward to get this downloaded! Thanks!!!

,00sweeney,2011-11-18T02:41Z,"CONTAINS ENGLISH SUBTITLES. 

Other than that, it's a great feed but the description is wrong. "
,00sweeney,2011-11-18T02:46Z,"Ten minutes after making my last comment--and after downloading another torrent with subtitles, deleting it, then downloading this one--I discovered they can be turned off using VLC player, under the Video menu.

So there you have it. This torrent rocks without reservation."

fyi

HARDsubs are enmeshed in pixels

SUBS are optional

you might prefer XBMC to VLC"

,muddy900,2012-06-28T17:27Z,thank you! :D
,Mmatthew,2012-06-30T20:39Z,"Steven Fry AND Hugh Laurie!
What a novel idea for a comedy duo, they really work well together, shame they didn't do more work as a pair."
,JDM_DSM,2012-07-20T10:43Z,"Thanks for the collection.

@Mmatthew
Have you checked out ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie""?

,Saki33,2012-07-20T16:18Z,"Subtitles are embedded, but not hard-coded, so they can be removed with mkvmerge. If you do want subtitles you can get better ones from Addic7ed.com. I did not like the font and position of the embedded subs."
