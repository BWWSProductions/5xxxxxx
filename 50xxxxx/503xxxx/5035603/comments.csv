DON'T BOTHER - you have to register for endless consumer ""offers"" which are aimed at sending endless SPAM through emails, phone calls and post!!

PLUS - your personal details WILL be sold on to other companies!!

PLUS PLUS - the fcuking ""offers"" NEVER arrive anyway!!!!

You've been warned!!

*** Or, take revenge on spammers, complete the offers with all sorts of fake shit information - give them a taste of their own medicine (and cost them some expenses)!!!"
