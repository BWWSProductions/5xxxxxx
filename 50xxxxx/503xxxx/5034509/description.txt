It is not surprised Attenborough produced a perfect planned documentary in the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin birthday in 2009. As a Biologist, i can easily say that every word was diligently selected in the speech.

Attenborugh ascribed all of the controversial subjects related to Evolution and Darwin's ideas at those years.

The visual expression is very strong as well as the narration.
