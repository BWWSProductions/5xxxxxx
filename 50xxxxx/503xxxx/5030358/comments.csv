,ftales,2009-07-31T11:40Z,"I had SF 1.5.2 and it worked perfectly, with this torrent I updated to 1.5.4 and I have a few problems, not sure why or if I did something wrong.

When I open it for the first time it takes a long time to open. I get the spinning pinwheel.

I always get the dialog box, SF is an app downloaded from the internet do you want to open it.

I click yes, more pinwheel, then I get the same dialog box, click yes, more pinwheel and then finally it opens.

Can not figure out how to fix this. It also crashes more often than 1.5.2.

Any suggestions?"
