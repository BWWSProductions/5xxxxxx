"You Belong with Me" is the title of a single by American singer Taylor Swift. It is the third single from her second album, 2008's Fearless. The song was originally released as a digital single, peaking at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 based on downloads. In April 2009, it was officially released to radio, debuting at #32 on the Hot Country Songs charts on the chart week of May 2, 2009. The song is Swift's eighth Top 20 country hit.

Swift plays the nerdy neighbor of a high school football star (Lucas Till), having presumably grown up together communicating through their bedroom windows that are across from each other. At the very beginning Swift tells him she loves him, but he has already closed the curtains. Later they are at a street bench talking when the boys popular girlfriend (also played by Swift) pulls up and kisses him and then pushes him, showing their unpleasant relationship. At a football game Swift watches as he wins the game and he walks to his girlfriend as she is flirting with his teammate saying "You were awesome." The Video just shows most likely prom night where Swift's character has a Cinderella moment and her neighbor picks her over his girlfriend, both of them saying "I love you".

"You Belong with Me" first charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and Pop 100 charts in 2008 based on downloads after its release as a digital single. Upon the song's release to country radio in April 2009, it debuted at #32 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated for May 2, 2009. It re-entered the Hot 100 at #87 on the chart week of May 16.
