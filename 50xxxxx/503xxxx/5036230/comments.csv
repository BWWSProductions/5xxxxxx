,darkmatter314,2009-10-31T23:58Z,Thank you for this torrent! The recordings seem to be really echoey. Do you know anyway to get rid of the echos?
,MT343,2010-05-25T04:40Z,"THANK YOU !!!
Great recording ! well done ! A real public benefit !
I even managed to buy the old book :-) 
Recommended download for assimil fans; But NB raw WAV from '78' records so you may have to modify sound ! 
I converted WAV with Audacity to pseudo-stereo MP3, perhaps also try equalisation (modern records apply freq filters), and compress volume peaks. (I've tried, unsucsessfully, to digitize a Linguaphone 1961 German so I know some of the problems; 'Anonymous' has done a difficult job well)."

""assimil_france.djvu"" and ""FRANCAIS_-_Assimil.rar"". password: www.legionetrangere.ru"
