Repo! The Genetic Opera

Not 100% sure about the quality, on my laptop it looks a little grainy, but on my work computer it looks a lot better, so it might be the aspect ratio, either way its pretty good quality and definitely a good movie.

EDIT: Double checked quality on my ps3, it definitely was my laptop, looks great on the ps3.

Encoded with Handbrake

Plays well with VLC, haven't tested others (that's all I use)
