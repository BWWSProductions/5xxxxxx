Vol.1 Cd2:
\\Mylo - In My Arms => My Chemical Romance - Song 2//
\\My Chemical Romance - Song 2 => The Coral - Dreaming of You//
\\The Coral - Dreaming of You => Mylo - In My Arms//
\\15Gone Missing => Max誰mo Park - Gone Missing//
\\Max誰mo Park - Gone Missing => The Bravery - Honest Mistake//
I think thats it."
