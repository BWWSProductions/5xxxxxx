Mixing equal parts bone-crushing volume, catatonic tempos, and ominous
pronouncements of gloom and doom delivered in Ozzy Osbournes keening
voice, Black Sabbath was the heavy-metal king of the 1970s. Often despised
by mainstream rock critics and ignored by radio programmers, the group still
managed to sell over 8 million albums before Osbourne departed for a solo
career in 1979. The bands original lineup reunited for a two-year tour in
1997.

The four original members, schoolmates from a working-class district of
industrial Birmingham, England first joined forces as the Polka Tulk Blues
Company, a blues band. They quickly changed their name to Earth, then, in
1969, to Black Sabbath; the name came from the title of a song written by
bassist Geezer Butler, a fan of occult novelist Dennis Wheatley. It may also
have been an homage to a Boris Karloff film. The quartets eponymously titled
1970 debut, recorded in two days, went to Number Eight in England and
Number 23 in the U.S. A single, Paranoid, released in advance of the album
of the same name, reached Number 4 in the U.K. later that year; it was the
groups only Top 20 hit.

The single didnt make the U.S. Top 40, but Paranoid, issued in early 1971,
sold four million copies with virtually no radio airplay. Beginning in December
1970 Sabbath toured the States relentlessly. Despite the band members
intense drug and alcohol abuse, the constant road work paid off, and by
1974 Black Sabbath was considered peerless among heavy-metal acts, its
first five LPs all having sold at least a million copies apiece in America alone.

In spite of their name, the crosses erected onstage, and songs dealing with
apocalypse, death, and destruction, the band members insisted their interest
in the black arts was nothing more than innocuous curiosity (the sort that led
Ozzy Osbourne to sit through eight showings of The Exorcist), and in time
Black Sabbaths princes-of-darkness image faded. Eventually, so did its
record sales. Aside from a platinum best-of, We Sold Our Soul for Rock n Roll
(1976), not one of three LPs from 1975 to 1978 went gold. Osbourne, racked
by drug use and excessive drinking, quit the band briefly in late 1977 (ex
Savoy Brown and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Dave Walker filled his shoes for
some live dates). In January 1979 he was fired. Ronnie James Dio, formerly
of Ritchie Blackmores Rainbow, replaced Osbourne.

Although Dio could belt with the best of them, Sabbath would never be the
same. Its first album with Dio, Heaven and Hell (1980), went platinum; its
second, Mob Rules (1981), gold. But thereafter, the groups LPs sold fewer
and fewer copies, as Black Sabbath went through one personnel change
after another. Ill health forced Bill Ward out of the band in 1980; Carmine
Appices brother Vinnie took his place. Friction between Iommi and Dio led the
singer to quit angrily in 1982; he took Appice with him to start his own band,
Dio. Vocalists over the years have included Dave Donato; Deep Purple singer
Ian Gillan; Glenn Hughes, another ex-member of Purple; Tony Martin; and Dio
again.

By 1986s Seventh Star, only Iommi remained from the original lineup. He had
to wince when Geezer Butler teamed up with the phenomenally successful
Osbourne in 1988, though the bassist did return to the fold three years later.
Despite bitterness expressed in the press between Osbourne and Iommi, the
original foursome reunited in 1985 at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, and
again in 1992, at the end of what was supposedly Osbournes last tour.
Throughout 1993 word had it that Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, and Ward would
tour, but by years end Osbourne had backed out, allegedly over money. The
indefatigable Tony Iommi went right back to work with Butler, rehiring vocalist
Tony Martin and adding former Rainbow drummer Rob Rondinelli. That lineup
proved as unstable as the previous one, with drummers coming, going, and
returning over the following years. Despite hiring Body Counts Ernie C to
produce 1995s Forbidden (and inviting guest vocalist Ice-T to sing on a
track), Black Sabbath seemed increasingly out of touch with the times, and at
the end of the Forbidden Tour, the band unofficially went on hiatus.

But not for long, as Iommi, Butler, and Osbourne reunited to headline 1997s
Ozzfest. Ward was not invited (he was replaced by Faith No Mores Mike
Bordin), but he did participate in two shows in the bands hometown of
Birmingham, England, in December 1997. The resulting live album, Reunion
(Number 11, 1998), also featured two new studio tracks, including the single
Psycho Man. The album went platinum in the U.S., and the live version of
Iron Man earned the band its first Grammy for Best Metal Performance
nearly 30 years after the song was originally released. The ensuing tour
lasted two years and ended in December 1999. Tony Iommi released his first
solo album in 2000; a prestigious roster of guest singers (Osbourne, Billy
Corgan, Henry Rollins, Dave Grohl) handled the vocals. Among metalheads,
Iommi is something of a guitar god, due in part to the fact that he plays
spectacularly despite having lost the tips of two right fingers in a welding
accident at age 17. His hero was the great jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt,
who also lost two fingers and yet continued to play. In mid-2001 it was
announced that all original members were writing material for a new Black
Sabbath album.

In mid-2001 it was announced that all four original members were writing
material for a new Black Sabbath album to be produced by Rick Rubin. The
band scrapped all the material and the album never materialized, although
Sabbath performed one new song, Scary Dreams, on that years Ozzfest.
The band was put on hold throughout 2002 as Osbourne refocused on his
solo music and new MTV reality show, The Osbournes, in which his family was
portrayed as a sort of real-life Munsters. The band came back together for
the 2004 and 2005 Ozzfest tours. In 2005, Black Sabbath was inducted into
the UK Music Hall of Fame, and the following year, after many years of
eligibility, the band made it into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2007,
Iommi and Butler reunited with Appice and Dio to record new material for the
compilation Black Sabbath: The Dio Years (Number 54); that configuration of
the group toured as Heaven and Hell (to avoid being confused with the
Osbourne-fronted Black Sabbath) into the year 2008. A new Heaven and Hell
album is slated for 2009.
