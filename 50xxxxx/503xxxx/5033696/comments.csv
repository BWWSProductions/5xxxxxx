,cam6389,2009-11-27T02:52Z,"Ah can I jsut say.
I discovered theres something wrong with this torrent.

with the Vol 4 album
there a pretty big screw up.

'Tomorrow's Dream' is in there twice (2). Once under its actually track title, and again under 'Changes'.

'Laguna Sunrise' is also in there twice (2). Once under its track name and again under 'st. Vitus's Dance'

So altogether with the Vol. 4 album. Theres 2 tracks missing. 
""Cornucopia""
""Under the Sun"""
