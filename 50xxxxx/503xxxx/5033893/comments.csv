There is a ?beta hack? which is to allow constant update for a month (that is 30 days) by making Kaspersky as a TRIAL over and over again. I don?t condemn the use of this exploit, in-fact I appreciate the work done of the person who has discovered this. The registry based hack may or may not allow the user to experience the complete Kaspersky experience (i.e in updating, detection and removal), I don?t and will not use it as I do not feel satisfied with a product as sensitive as an Antivirus (AV) working on trial basis. I would again like to emphasis on the fact that I don?t know whether with the ?beta hack? one can get all the functions of Kaspersky working as they should with registration.
Kaspersky Co, itself is responsible for the leak of the keys you and I use. This may be for multiple reasons. They don?t want to loose market to AV?s such as AVG and Avast because there permanent hacks and cracks are available. They are aware of which keys and torrents should be black listed, they allow the user 2-15 days before they black list the key. They don?t black list their keys every day because, such a practice would lead people to switch to other AV?s. "
