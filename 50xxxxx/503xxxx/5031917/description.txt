Hosts : Robert Llewellyn and Lisa Rogers.

With 6 weeks and a budget of 1,500 pounds, four teams must build SVA-approved cars and traverse the UK, altering their cars as they go, to complete a series of challenges along the way.

The four teams : "The Knuckleheadz", "The Cops 'N' Bodgers", "The Tartan Starlets" and season one winners "The Chaos Crew". 

Today's challenge is an agility test similar to the series one test. (With a few differences).

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. So please, do your part.
