,floatablepie,2009-08-01T07:40Z,"Is there any way to play these games on a wiikey moded wii? I tried to copy it over on an sd card, but I can't figure it out."
,o0joshua0o,2009-08-01T15:20Z,"@floatablepie:
Do you have the homebrew channel installed yet?  There are instructions for installing it on a chipped Wii.  You'll need that and wad manager.  "
,floatablepie,2009-08-01T16:51Z,"Thanks, I'll look into those."
,floatablepie,2009-08-01T19:20Z,"I've installed homebrew channel, and tried to follow online guides, but I either end up with no result on the homebrew channel, a ""not a valid wii application"" error, or an install wad! (ret = -2011) error from all the scenarios I tried. Anyone have time to write specific instructions for wiikey?"
,floatablepie,2009-08-01T19:47Z,"Also, I use 3.4U, which I read a bunch of places as being a problem, or not a problem, so I'm confused."
,floatablepie,2009-08-01T21:19Z,"Nevermind, figured it out."
,inAcrysis,2009-08-08T12:46Z,I know it says (USA NTSC) but has anyone got these to work on PAL?
,hart37,2009-08-28T05:13Z,I know for a fact that all wiiware is region free. Haven't tried the games yet
,NuBiXx,2009-09-06T09:35Z,If people still want this I am going to seed this on my 50/50mbps connection for tonight only so get it while you can. I see so many leechers and hardly any seeders and the ones who are seeding are not very fast :)
,NuBiXx,2009-09-06T09:40Z,"@floatablepie, that error comes from Trucha Bug not there anymore, follow this guild If you still are having problems.

,DylanHD,2009-10-14T06:52Z,"only for people with firmware v4.2, this guide is very easy to follow so just upgrade!"
,imagodei1,2009-12-14T19:02Z,I havnt gotten up to date with the USB files and have been burning everything to a disk. Am i wrong to assume that I can not use this unless I use a hardrive because of the size?
,thunderc8,2009-12-21T17:54Z,"The games doesnt work on pal version opnly half wiiware and some mega drive and neo geo games.
I have converted all games with wad region converter to pal and i just got some games to work i cant really remember how many games works after the region change but i can confirm you all that about 40% of the games works on pal wii and you can have them on a usb stick and install them with wad manager 1.4."
,smaurice2001,2009-12-25T20:26Z,thanks
,Stattlich,2009-12-26T03:08Z,"Badass. Now I can have all of my old classic games on my Wii, with no need to rebuy them.

,siborg69,2010-01-01T18:39Z,i dont have usb loader....is burning to a dual layer ok? or just splitting the files up over 2 DVDs?  cheers

,dariian,2010-01-31T06:02Z,How use this ?
,morphirr,2010-02-05T02:58Z,"Don't upgrade to 4.2 it's not a good idea!!
Can these run on a PAL System? Only wanted to try some of them don't want to get Bricked. Is hart37 correct is wiiware region free?"
,arod1990,2010-02-17T20:31Z,"Great torrent, I have 4.2u and I have heard people have been having issues with the firmware, I wouldnt know I bought my wii with 4.2. been installing wads with wad manager then moving them to sd card and running them from there no issue beside running out of space! havent figured out how to get usb loader or backup loader(neogamma) to run yet. 

thank you very much mario kart 64 is reason enough to download this."
,arod1990,2010-02-17T20:36Z,"also definitly read up on wii homebrew, do your home work, make sure to install priiloader and bootmii as IOS if you have to like i did, I have been living in constant fear of bricking my system so be careful.

does anyone know if a more current pack of wii ware is out on torrent?"
,Pyatin,2010-02-19T22:52Z,"I have 4.2U softmod.  This works great.  I got my system at 3.4U and softmodded originally with Twilight Hack.  I have issues with reading burn discs after upgrading to 4.2U, but I don't use burn discs anymore.  I use USB Loader GX.  I have it installed both as a channel and access on my SD card through HBC.  Some games give me an Error 002 using the channel.  Going through the HBC seems to clear that up. Not sure why, but it works.  "
,Destoroyah,2010-03-14T14:41Z,"in the WadManager, what IOS do i have to use to install the WADs?"
,Destoroyah,2010-03-14T15:04Z,nvm found it after a long google search. its 259
,Destoroyah,2010-03-14T15:04Z,249* sorry for the typo
,Destoroyah,2010-03-14T18:01Z,"PAL testing results:
-N64 games work, region converted to PAL, not to region free. but SLOW as hell
-FEW wiiware games work, including megaman 9 and 10, world of goo
-other wiiware, like sudoku challenge, dont work in any region format (tested NTSC, PAL and region free)
-NeoGeo games work like a dream (tested with metal slug 2)
-internet channel seems to work at first, but freezes after a few seconds
-NES, SNES games DONT work

-> get a couple of wiiware games, and metal slug for sure
please someone make a PAL torrent of this"
,Destoroyah,2010-03-14T19:09Z,"currently trying the PAL releases from wehackwii.com
probably should have looked there in the first first place"
,Destoroyah,2010-03-20T23:04Z,"those from that page work perfectly, with no slowdowns or anything at all. some download links are down though.
""Rock N Roll Climber"" PAL is the only game that didnt work so far"
,mb_webguy,2010-04-13T01:48Z,"For those who are having problems modding their Wii, get Barnitos softmod v8 from HackMyWii (you'll need to download the hackmii installer from BootMii if you don't already have the Homebrew Channel installed, and NeoGamma from HackMyWii if you want a disc loader).  I used it to (re)mod my Wii, including upgrading from 4.1 to 4.2, and am not having any problems at all.  Just make sure to follow Barnito's instructions carefully, and you should be fine no matter which version of the Wii you have.

Oh, and nice torrent, btw."
,Mattsasa,2010-04-27T05:59Z,"Okay normally I am too lazy, to comment on torrents, 

but Oh my Gosh. This is quite a collection, did you buy many of these your selves?!

GREAT TORRENT!!! Will help seed 4ever! well not quite.
