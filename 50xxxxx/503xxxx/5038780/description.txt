Although some otaku (hardcore fans) have complained about the editing of the English dub of the popular ninja fantasy-adventure Naruto, the Uncut Box Set reveals the edits were quite minor. There's a little more blood in some of the fight scenes, and the opening and closing titles are the Japanese originals. In episode 3, Naruto's stomach problems are presented more vividly, and Kakashi delivers a more explicit jab to Naruto's butt in episode 4. More revealing differences turn up in the subtitles: In the English dub, Naruto declares he wants to become a great ninja so the whole village "will start treating me like somebody important"; in the original, it's "will acknowledge my existence." The three-disc Uncut Box, which includes the bound storyboards for Episode 8 (in Japanese), is a good buy. The first 13 episodes include Naruto's graduation from the Ninja Academy and his assignment to a team with Sakura (on whom he nurtures a crush) and Sasuke, his arch-rival. The reluctant trio begins to learn how to work as a team on their first mission under the supervision of Kakashi. The exotic jutsu (ninja techniques), stylized fights and slapstick comedy will keep any Naruto fan happy. (Unrated, suitable for ages 12 and older: violence, tobacco use, risquÃ© and toilet humor) --Charles Solomon
