,MEvsEVERYBODY,2010-01-15T04:30Z,"Works okay and is a legit download. My only problem is with the software. Once installed properly and connected to your ipod, if you want to transfer a specific band/title, you have to manually scroll through all the songs OR hit the 'track filter' from the pulldown and it'll give you a sub-list of artists. It will NOT alphabetize your songs or artists. A minor inconvenience. thanks for the torrent!"
,MEvsEVERYBODY,2010-01-15T04:48Z,"Also, when you transfer to PC, it will not automatically make a folder for the transferred songs. So for example, you were to backup your entire ipod, you would have to manually make a folder on your harddrive for EVERY band and EVERY album and you'd have to do it one album at a time. Otherwise it'll just do a straight dump into one folder, all songs mixed together."
