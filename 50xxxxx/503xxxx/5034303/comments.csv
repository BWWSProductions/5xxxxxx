IÂ´ve been wating for about 26 years to get this soundtrack!

I didnÂ´t have the money to buy the vinyl back then.

When I finally could afford to buy it, I could not find it in my country's music stores anymore.

Now I can play GOOD MAN IN A BAD TIME over and over.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
