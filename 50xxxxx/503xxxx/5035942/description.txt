All of the books have been fully OCR'ed (meaning all of the text can be copied and searched), the pages have been properly numbered to match those of the print edition and in most bookmarks have been put at the start of chapters for easy reference.

Note that I have uploaded two similar books on Excel but they are different (one is a full reference the other is just a quick one).

Feel free to use selective download to download only the ones you want but PLEASE seed as much as possible as this is bigger than most of my other uploads and I will have serious trouble seeding it properly because my Internet is very slow.

If you liked my upload don't forget to say thank you :).
