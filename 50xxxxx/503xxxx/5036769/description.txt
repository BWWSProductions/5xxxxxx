LANDy is Adam Goldberg, with the likes of Steven Drozd of Flaming Lips, Aaron Espinoza of Earlimart, a host of others, and often times Goldberg very much alone.
 
LANDyâ€™s are songs of love and loss. Renditions of contrition. If youâ€™ve ever been jilted or are generally antipathetic youâ€™ll get a kick out of LANDy! LANDyâ€™s debut album, â€œEros and Omissions,â€ was recorded in Los Angeles, New York, and Norman, Oklahoma, in studios, living rooms, and truck stops (not really). 

It began in earnest in 2002 and was completed bombastically in 2008, clocking in with 18 tunesâ€”a little something for everyone. Or a lot of something for someone. Itâ€™s a Best Of! Itâ€™s a debut! Itâ€™s whatever you want it to be! This LANDy is your LANDy, this LANDy is my LANDy. Itâ€™s the music youâ€™ve been waiting forâ€¦and waiting forâ€¦
