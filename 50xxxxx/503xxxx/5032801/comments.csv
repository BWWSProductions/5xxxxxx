,jeasuz,2009-11-16T03:42Z,"I don't understand, i have been downloading this torrent for days but am still at 0.0% 

uTorrent tells me i am using 3 seeds of 0 connected and 73 in swarm, but these numbers don't make sense (3 of 0 connected??? what the fuck?)

I want this tasty FLAC, anyone have a solution?"
,jeasuz,2009-11-16T04:15Z,"Ah nevermind, I just fixed it.  

see the problem was I downloaded this torrent using the ""magnet link""... i don't even fucking know why i did, but oh well, it fucked up the download"
