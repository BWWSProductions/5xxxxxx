 Paul Blart is a mild-mannered, dutiful family man who works as a security    
 guard in a New Jersey mall. For years, he has applied to become a cop, but   
 he always fails the physical exam because he is overweight. One day, a gang  
 of organized criminals put the mall under siege and take hostages. Blart     
 becomes trapped inside, and because of his sense of duty, refuses to leave.  
 He thus becomes the police department's eyes on the inside and attempts to   
 stop the criminals on his own.
