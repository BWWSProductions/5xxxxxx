This is a digital age, one in which a wealth of accessible information empowers you, but where is the information coming from? How accurate and unprocessed is it? How empowered do you feel debating a television screen or a newspaper? The task is to move the discussion away from talking heads and talking points, and give it back to you. That is Big Think's mission.
