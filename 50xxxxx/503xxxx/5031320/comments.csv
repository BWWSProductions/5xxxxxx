,revolvit22,2009-07-30T05:03Z,are you just using the 10.6 beta?
,jfreed09,2009-07-30T06:05Z,I still can't get these patches to run?  Any help would be most appreciated... I have 10.5.7 if that helps.  They don't do anything after I double click.

Yeah, it's still in beta. Working nicely though :)

@jfreed09
Someone kindly posted a serial over in the other thread, so I suggest you perhaps try that instead of the patches. Hopefully you still have an unedited copy of the Logic disk image :)

,samarudge,2009-10-11T01:02Z,"IMPORTANT
This Torrent DOES work if you update!!!
When Apple detect a serial posted online the pull it so when you update your serial becomes invalid
HOWEVER
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5119114/Logic_Pro_Volume_Licencing_Crack
This crack removes the need for a serial and replaces your licence type with a Volume Licence which doesn't use a serial so you can update to 9.0.1 or whatever update you want. I have used this and it works in everything (Even Mainstage)
Hope this helps you all

P.S. Don't thank me my music tech teacher gave it 2 me but I'm not going to tell you who he is else you might sue him :P but he knows I love him lol 
P.P.S. Caixa I'm sorry for posting on both your torrents but I thought people might want to use this :P If you would like to upload it to your own account be my guest (I'm not exactly going to sue you for copyright lol)"
