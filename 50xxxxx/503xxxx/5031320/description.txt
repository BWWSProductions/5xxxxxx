If you've had problems running the patches included with the torrent I uploaded to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5030372/Logic_Studio_9_Install_DVD then these might help. I was trying to install on 10.6 and the patchers weren't working and I found a fix for them from someone who was having the same problem on 10.5.7 and it worked for me too!!

Good luck and all the best

abraÃ§os, caixa






***BEGIN UPDATE***

OK folks, I don't think we need to worry about these  patches anymore. Thanks to TPB user L3ntil we have a working serial and here it is:

E-330-DOX-030-NJB-265-AKZ-414-BVZ-M2E-41HX

This torrent may die soon. RIP!
