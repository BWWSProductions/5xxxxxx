jimi hendrix tribute concert - live at the warfield in san francisco - 2-26-2004

i'm not sure if any other recordings exist.

my friend and i stood in the back of the mainfloor dead center, recorded on mini disc with a pair of mics.

until now, there are only 4 people who have a copy of this recording (including joe satriani, whom i spoke to at the house of blues in chicago and personally verified that he had and enjoyed this recording).

i have included both FLAC and 128k MP3's in this torrent - if you're an audiophile like me, you'll choose the FLAC's (which are compressed at level 6 from the original WAV files).   the setlist and list of performers is included in the text file.

one funny note - during hoochie coochie man, the dude next to me passed out - i guess a mix of the heat, alcohol and whatever drugs he had in him took their toll - the guy was all sweaty, fell against me, spilled my beer and slid down to the floor - security came and took him away - you can hear me comment about it on the recording - was funny, hope he was alright though.

enjoy!!
