Loving sons always do what their mothers tell them to...even if it's to kill. Directed by Charles Kaufman (brother of Troma President Lloyd Kaufman), the classic Motherâ€™s Day delivers laughs and chills with liberal doses of nail-biting suspense. When three college buddies decide to rekindle their comraderie with a camping trip, they become the unwitting prey of a very dysfunctional family. As unforgettable as Deliverance, as terrifying as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a twisted statirical humor in the Kaufman vein, this Mother's Day will leave you feeling frightened and amazed!
