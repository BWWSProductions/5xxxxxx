Having built their vehicles and passed the SVA roadworthiness test "The Barley Pickers", "The Green Goddesses", "The Boat Boys", "The Megalomaniacs" and "The Chaos Crew" must now drive 300 miles to Pendine Sands in South Wales to compete in a flat-out speed challenge.

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. So please, do your part.
