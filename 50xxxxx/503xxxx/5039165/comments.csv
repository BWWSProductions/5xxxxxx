Thank U!

But: Can the usual
people who do english
subtitles regularly
please be so kind
to do them as fast as possible?
(That is for both Part 1 and 2.)

I have some hearing-
difficulties, and the
english subs really
help me to understand
what they say.

Many thanks in advance.

Peace and Love!"

,sonofdog,2009-08-05T16:28Z,quality ok but the film cuts off during the (presumably) final scene. If you made it to that point without quitting due to the lousy script and feeble storyline your disappointment should be complete. Rubbish tv movie.
,CABLE999,2009-08-05T17:09Z,Does this really cut off at final scene????

in this 2-part mini-series.
But now i Q U I T..!

( I will erase the episodes
from my computor!)

No english subs fow weeks,
aparently cut before the end,

bad seed,

and much wasted time.

As said before: Dont bother!
