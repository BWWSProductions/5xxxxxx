,xforcer,2009-07-31T03:08Z,"I guess geoffsee can't read ""open source"", ""free of cost"".  As far as creationists being dumbasses Einstien and my quantum mechanics professor would beg to differ.  Thanks"

,pomandrew,2009-07-31T12:53Z,Who is Einstien?.. I think I just found a 'half-ape' .. Why would God let you appear to be illiterate?..?...?
,xforcer,2009-08-01T11:02Z,"No there on TPB making dumbass comments about things they don't have a clue about and supporting the murder of babys.  You are pathetic, but GOD still loves you."

,jimk770i,2009-08-29T22:18Z,"to those who are anti-Christian, what the hell are u doing in this download page anyway - if u hate this thing what are u doing here?
the comments should be based on the material being downloaded. If u want ur beliefs to be discussed, why not go to some discussion sites and wrestle ur thoughts with other people...
btw, thanks fjeyar for uploading this file - it's really helpful for the Church...
FREELY YOU RECEIVE...FREELY YOU GIVE...
this torrent is actually for free use in the churches and it's a free download....so, this is not stealing!"
