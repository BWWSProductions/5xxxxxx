Alex Loynaz is excellent as Pedro, if not the magnetic personality of his true counterpart, and his scenes with Justina Machado are particularly profound and deeply touching. The entire cast is well selected and offers different insights to the life of Pedro Zamora. There won't be a dry eye after watching this tender film. It is well worth spending time getting to know another unsung hero.
