Biography:

It started with Me (Drew) just making songs with a drum program and a guitar and now I realize that I want my own band so thats what i'm working on.

(as of 1/8/200)

The main members of the band are

Drew - Guitar, vox, drum prog, synth, Producer, Manager, Coordinator

Seth - Vox, Silly stuff.

We are going to have our first album finished by the end of 2009 we planned by the end of August but that seemed to constrictive on giving us time to listen and be able to go back and edit songs and everything to make it the best possible Spazzcore to come out of Michigan.

There are going to be 10 or 11 song in all for Destroying the Infrastructure
