This is about as close to dance music as I will ever listen to, but the first song "Myth Takes" is really good (and so are a few of the others). For some reason I'm reminded of The Clash on a few of the songs. I'm upping this because I know there are people who want it, and it happens to be on my hard drive. So, enjoy.
