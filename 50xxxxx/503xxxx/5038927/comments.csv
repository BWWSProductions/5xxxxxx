,xXENDGAMEXx,2009-08-14T10:57Z,"Ok now lets clarify things here Titel of torrent says ""Imdb.Top.250.Movie.Pack.(100).MULTISubs.BRRips.DVDRips.2009-MojB "" now even tho (100) is in the title i still have a problem with this 1.There nothing near 250 movies here. 2. Theres not even 100 movies in this torrent. So wtf is up with the way you label your torrent uploads bro?"
,iCom1337,2009-08-15T19:42Z,"There are 2 parts of this huge pack, so my problem is that TPB does not support 150Gb torrents."
