,dragkhar,2011-08-22T07:55Z,"NTSC = Only plays on Xboxs Released in the USA, There coded diffrently. While PAL only plays the rest. Simply put, If your american, and in the usa. ALWAYS look for the NTSC, And if your unsure, there's always someone bitching about if its pal or ntsc in the comments lol. Hope to help!"
