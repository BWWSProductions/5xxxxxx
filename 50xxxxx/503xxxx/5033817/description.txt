Invincible [SE] - Five [1999]


Amazon.Co.Uk Review - Invincible Is The Second Album By British Boy Band Group Five, Released In 1999 (See 1999 In Music). The Album Was Re-Packaged And Re-Released In 2000 With Bonus Tracks And A Second CD Featuring Five Tracks Performed Live During Their World Tour In Early 2000. The Album Sold Over 2.5 Million Copies Worldwide.
Featuring The Utterly Magnificent Top-Three Single "If Ya Gettin' Down" (Based Around The Hook From Indeep's Hip Disco Classic "Last Night A DJ Saved My Life"), The Band's Only Number One, The Motownesque "Keep On Movin'"(Ironically One Of Their Weakest Singles), The Odd Cheesy Ballad ("Invincible") As Well As A Smattering Of Pure Pop Genius--"Mr Z" And The Faux Sci-Fi Theme Tune "Battlestar". In Today's World Of Throwaway Pop Music, Five Have Earned Themselves The Accolade Of Being The Boy Band That Even Boys And The Hip Music Crowd Like, Largely Due To Their Winning Combination Of Stomp-Pop, Tough Image And Camaraderie.
