,monkeyface766,2010-03-28T05:00Z,is it really that bad?
,aniaki,2010-04-02T06:20Z,"The first 4 seasons from this person were fine and perfectly watchable, but the audio at the end of episode 5 is missing from this season :("
,aniaki,2010-04-03T12:10Z,"The audio at the end of episode 7 is missing as well.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!!"
,noskinnychicks,2010-04-18T07:24Z,"Thanks for the torrents - I've downloaded previous seasons from the same user and they have been perfect - however at 40:00 of each episode of this torrent, audio cuts out until the end of the episode. It is very frustrating."
,softofff,2011-06-16T23:41Z,SEED PLEASSEEEE! :) stuck at 85% :l
,TheNewra16,2011-12-26T12:47Z,Upload season 6 and 7 please! Your Grey's Anatomy torrents aren't so big and work perfectly!
,youngforcers,2012-01-12T01:16Z,all the episodes worked perfectly for me idk what the rest of y'all are talking about 
,kmx21,2012-03-11T11:11Z,"Just downloaded season five, quickly went through every episode all working perfect.

Thanks rustyjerk."
,kinamaste,2012-05-01T03:22Z,Great except in some episodes audio cuts out in the final minute or 2. Otherwise solid.
,oscas,2012-06-01T21:15Z,Never left a comment before but just had to let ppl know that the audio problems with this download are not worth it - I'm at episode 23 and audio is dropping out sporadically. Find a better quality torrent
