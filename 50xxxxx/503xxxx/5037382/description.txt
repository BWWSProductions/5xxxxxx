CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - JULY 2009
       ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

More older tracks than usual on this one; great not-new songs by Beck,
Teddybears, Ben Folds, Air, Draytones... and many more! New songs by
Green Go, Kasabian, Simian Mobile Disco, Apostle of Hustle, Eels, Rural
Alberta Advantage... and many more! Leaked songs by Friendly Fires and
Arctic Monkeys... and, well, that's it. But it' cool to listen to tracks
that no one was ever supposed to hear, isn't it? I hope everyone's summer
(or winter, haha Australia) is still going well. Only 30 tracks on this
one, but it took me extra long to compile for some reason, hence being
late by a day. Woops. Cheers and enjoy!
