back BEFORE trent offered up the entire master files of ONLY for scrudnuts like me to remix and share with the world to judge as to who could make the better remix - i recorded my own version of ONLY - 2 weeks later i downloaded the individual lossless quality files and realized, i had the right BPM of trents version, so add them into what i had already recorded.    i mixed in some of the actual files to my version, and vuala (or however the fuck you say it), this track was born.   love it or hate it, i don't fuckin' care, you're gettin' this shit for free so fuck you if you hate it.   my bass, my guitar...   trents vocals and some random keyboards by nin.

there is no fucking you there is only me...

download this shit, snort a line, spark a pipe and dig it...
