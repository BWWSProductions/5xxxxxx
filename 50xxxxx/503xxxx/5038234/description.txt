I couldn't find any decent torrent with the Wipeout HD music, so I made one myself. I put my own order on this tracklist, which made the most sense to me.

01. DJ Fresh - X-Project (Wipeout Mix)
02. Noisia - Seven Stitches
03. Stanton Warriors - Tokyo
04. Ed Rush - Optical & Matrix - Frontline
05. Move Ya! & Steve Lavers - Chemical
06. Mason - Exceeder (Special Mix)
07. Mist - Smart Systems
08. Booka Shade - Steady Rush
09. Kraftwerk - Areo Dynamik

Enjoy.
