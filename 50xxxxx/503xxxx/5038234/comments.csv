,Gamebuster,2009-12-09T01:23Z,"You also got the fury-expension songs?

Btw, the order is incorrect. The order is:
01_steady_rush.mp3
02_x-project.mp3
03_optical.mp3
04_aero_dynamik.mp3
05_exceeder.mp3
06_seven_stitches.mp3
07_smart_systems.mp3
08_tokyo.mp3
09_chemical.mp3

Put ""http://www.wipeouthd.com/media/mp3/"" in front of it, and you can download the song directly from the original website. 

Too bad they only got 30-sec samples of the songs from fury...

Anyone got the full-length songs?"
