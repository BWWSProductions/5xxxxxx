"Cold & Kind is another helping of smallpox-catchy hysteria, a full-length that eclipses the orchestral pop maneuvers found on its predecessor. When Plume Delivery was cut, the band had yet to play a live gig; in the EPâ€™s wake, the 1900s did countless shows in Chicago and Champaign, Ill., as well as festivals like SXSW and Lollapalooza. All the gig hours logged show in the songwriting, which is more cohesive, more aware of which pop constructs work (and which donâ€™t), and more thematic without the effort of laying on added instrumentation (the tunes are pretty cottony thick to begin with)."
