This is an avi capture from VHS of the aussie comedy buddies. Quite a good australian comedy/drama movie from the 80's. Anyone who likes The Matrix Trilogy will recognise "The Trainman" as "Ted", the always-drunk, never-helping guy lol.

Hope you enjoy. If anyone finds a DVD copy please post in comments. I cannot find it at any of my normal stores Ezydvd or Dstore.

Pretty good quality for VHS. I provide this as currently I know of no way to buy this movie, and they haven't shown it on television as rerun for probably 10 years.
