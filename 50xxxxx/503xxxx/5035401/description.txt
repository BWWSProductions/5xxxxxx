ItÂ´s quite all right to leave a comment and let me know what you think.

I have a collection of eight boxes - 3 CDs in each - published by Reader's Digest. As you can see from some of my previously posted torrents they are not the only boxes in my classic collection. One might think that it is a problem with compilations where some works appear very often. I think, as I stated in previous descriptions, itâ€™s the opposite. Good music can be even better when you can choose the interpretation of the orchestra or the artist that appeals most to you. Box 6
