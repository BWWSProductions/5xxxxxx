,closetmonsterrr,2010-01-31T03:59Z,"for subtitles and support, all tht good stuff, even customizable options for vid/audio sync, blah-zay-blah, try cccp-project.com.
if thts not it, google it.
its a combined codec pack for use in windows media player, n just about anything else. runs everything, works great, even bluray.

just a helpful tip."

@closetmonsterrr: the cccp-project.net worked perfectly. Thanks!"
