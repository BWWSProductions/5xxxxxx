,scottyscum,2009-08-03T12:56Z,"I'll be fucking damned, a comment before anyone even has downloaded it! Sorry, I've been making negative comments on as many Phish torrents as possible, because they DO NOT ever say thanks, EVER. I don't hate hippies, hell I'm kind of one myself (kind of). It's just I live here in Portland, Oregon, and there are SO many Phish Heads around right now BUMMING AND BEGGING off of people that it makes me fucking sick. I know this has absolutely NOTHING to do with Fugazi, it's just that state I'm in right now. Enjoy the upload, whether you say ""thanks"" or not. "
