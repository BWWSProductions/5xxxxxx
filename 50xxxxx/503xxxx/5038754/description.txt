RESIDENT EVIL 2:

Raccoon City has somehow fallen victim to a zombie outbreak and it's up to you as either police officer Leon Kennedy, or Claire Redfield (sister to Chris Redfield from RE1), to find out what's going on. The adventure, which takes place in 3D using pre-rendered backgrounds, drags you through spooky crash sites, abandoned buildings, experiments gone wrong and more -- all the while battling undead monstrosities, solving puzzles and, most of all, trying to stay alive. Lots of weapons and other gadgetry allow for some truly disgusting mayhem. It's an incredibly frightening game that delivers a light back-story and lots of slasher movie, jump-out-and-go-boo scares.

Have you been looking for that classic PSX game but just can't seem to find it anywhere? How about those "rare" titles that were only released in certain regions? Better yet, would you like to be able to have those games playable on your PSP so you can play them anywhere you want? Want to get those conversions directly from the source instead of through "unsafe" torrent browsers? Come and request them at
