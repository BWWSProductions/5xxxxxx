This is a small folder containing what I think are the best games for the Nintendo 64. They're not compressed, allowing you to pick and choose which ones you'd like to include. There's also 2 joystick configurations which are great for USB gamepads.

A few are in their own folders and a few are just files, no big deal.

Games in this package:

Zelda: Ocarina of Time 
Zelda: Majora's Mask
Mystical Ninja 2 Starring Goemon
Goldeneye 007
Banjo Kazooie
Starfox 64
Super Mario 64
Super Smash Bros.
Donkey Kong 64
