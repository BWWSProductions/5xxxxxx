Looks like some sort of cult propaganda nonsense..."

,Bombardem,2009-07-30T22:57Z,"I didnt say occult, I said cult. As in quasi-religious nonsense that sucks in the gullible. Dont drink the kool-aid kids..."
[T],jmb2012,2009-07-31T01:47Z,"I see you've had your fair share of ""kool-aid"".

If you have not seen don't comment.

If you want to believe the bullshit you've been fed since birth so be it, don't put these type of things down because your to dumb to get it."
,31Romulus,2009-08-01T11:45Z,Is this some sort of Zeitgeist style of movie? Another conspiracy theory for the kids? Let's see it...
,bunksteve,2009-09-28T15:50Z,"I watched the first ten minutes or so on the website, so while it wouldn't be fair to comment on the whole thing, from what I can gather it's basically trying to say that the only true God is the universe, which is a living organism. I'm just summarizing what I saw, but... I dunno. I have no problem with it. Everybody is free to their opinions on what God is. I'm still looking for more answers, personal. Less speculation."
,jjalienhunter,2009-12-08T06:44Z,"Excellent work(the film), happy to see you had torrent.  Downloaded and burned to dvd.  Some people will never ´´get it´´ .   THANKS!!!!!"
,TrashCompaqtor,2009-12-31T03:41Z,"Thanks for the torrent!  It's the only actual dvdrip of it that I've found... I might not be able to seed it for long, but I will upload it to a file hosting site and spread it around that way - I'll give credit to you, jmb2012"
