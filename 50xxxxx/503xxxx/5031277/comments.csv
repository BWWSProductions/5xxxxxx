[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-07-31T21:07Z,"You know, you get the feeling, reading this book, that all of the degrees that a Mason goes through are so similar to Judaism. And just like in the Talmud, a Mason is not permitted to act unfavourably to a fellow Mason but is to non-Masons. A Jew, likewise, must act favourably to a fellow Jew but is not olbigated, and is in fact encouraged to act unfavourably to a non-Jew."

[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-08-06T03:56Z,"""As luck has it from time to time, people working for the 'other' side, for various personal reasons , turn coat on their own kind and bring forth the light of truth to the public as to what they have seen or have been involved in.

One such person was Dennis Brunnell, a 33rd degree Mason and a Grandmaster in the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). In Brunnell's case he became disillusioned by the Illuminati's present activities. Originally believing that the Illuminati was a mystic lodge designed to illuminate one into mystical heights of ascended awareness, he eventually learned that such metaphysical talk was just a smoke screen designed to gain the willing assistance of lower-ranking ""lodge"" members, who were unknowingly being manipulated into serving the self-serving imperialistic goals of a relatively small inner circle of ""illumined"" members.

Another man by the name of John Todd, a member of a family who were high-level and generational members of a druidic witchcraft cult, alleged that through his occult contacts, he was chosen to be initiated into a deep-level Illuminati lodge. He claimed that in doing so he had to ""unlearn"" much of the wiccan philosophies he had been taught at a young age.

Just as 33rd degree Mason Brunnell learned, Todd also came out knowing and claiming their teaching of the occult , again was used merely as a means of this inner circle of initiates to control the lower ranks of the lodge. Todd further claimed that this inner circle consisted of 13 individuals,who were both the 'leaders' of all the large wiccan/witchcraft organizations 'as well' as the leaders of World Freemasonry. These men controlled not only both movements from their high positions, but much of the world's drug trafficking, and had powerful influence in world economic and political movements.

Todd soon learned that this inner core were continuously fearful that the lower-ranking members of the occult societies would turn against ""them"" if the lower members ever found out that this inner council were merely using these ""lower pawns"" to increase their own wealth and their god-like power and authority over the rest of humanity. The Rothschilds of London, he also learned, were at the very heart of this conspiracy, along with the Jesuits in Rome. The Rothschilds were considered to be ""human gods"" by many occultists and, according to Todd, were in constant communication with The 'Illuminated one, ..Lucifer, who they themselves considered to be god.
