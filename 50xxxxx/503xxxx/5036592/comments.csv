,NuclearFistMonkey,2009-08-02T13:12Z,"seed, it will make it even faster!"
,Piglet666,2009-08-02T20:27Z,"Didn't work on my comp, just got a black screen. so I deleted it without getting into what the problem was!"
,maikel1986,2009-08-02T22:53Z,"thanks fast download it downloaded in 10 minutes
but the game sucks"
,Coaslip,2009-08-02T22:58Z,"I usally dont bothering commenting, but this game is really NOT worth the bandwith. The Grapichs would maybe impressed me 10 years ago , and the driving physics.... whom am i kidding.. ? There are noe driving physics. Even as java game on my mobile phone i'd excpect more.. dont bother."
,Brizz,2009-08-03T08:36Z,"Thanks for the upload, 
the game is awful though, not even worth downloading. "
,Nick_017,2009-08-03T15:31Z,"To everyone who says its an awful game: This simulator is never made to be a game or to be fun, its just something people use to practice for their drivers license and stuff.

so if you are looking for a fun racer, keep looking..."
,peter8823,2009-08-03T18:52Z,"Great torrent, crap game. Don't waste your time downloading this."
,0x0000,2009-08-03T23:39Z,"not work, black screen =("
,jojonne,2009-08-05T22:39Z,nice :>
,sherby19,2009-08-07T01:53Z,"Thanks Groo This Should Help Me Polish up For My Testt

and just so all you faggots know... a simulator is a representation of normal real life... which isnt fun =P,

 it's not a game... it's a simulator.

thanks again xD"
,MoviemMRZ,2009-08-08T01:45Z,"Terrible simulator!

Ty for the release! Now I know how bad this game is!"
[V],lan3y,2009-08-08T14:39Z,"as said above, its a simulator you ever like it or you dont :P

it can be fun, but dont expect it to be a game

lan3y"
,PirateEcho,2009-08-10T15:59Z,"This isn't a simulator idiot, that's just the name. It has no real physics."
,kulawend,2009-08-22T10:30Z,Crap Simulator 2009! Now with 25% extra crap!
,Gamer370ZYX,2009-09-10T15:35Z,"For everyone's information, this game is maked to be realistic. To it to be realistic, you need a driving wheel, such as the Logitech G25/G27. So, with keyboard, this game sucks! But on Driving wheel, this is the best driving simulator ever!"
,Harrewho,2009-10-04T19:15Z,"@ Coaslip
Sounds just like euro truck xD sucky gfx and physics"
,Harrewho,2009-10-05T00:09Z,"this is a buggy game, for instance: Sometimes/Anytime a car that drives ahead of you will just jump off the road in to the air.
Otherwise this game was pretty good. With my expectations I was surprised actually. The graphics ain't so bad and the gameplay/stearing/controls ain't so bad either. I mean, it could be ALOT worse :P

The game gotta be porly written, because it laggs alot on high gfx settings. And my comp isn't bad.
GFX 2x Radeon HD 4850  2.2gb vram
CPU E8400 (Core 2 Duo) 3GHz
RAM 4gb
Might lagg because I have Vista :P yh I think that's why x)"
,South19,2009-11-01T10:03Z,"When i opened it i got 19 files, what do i need to do next?"
,Erick131,2009-11-28T20:46Z,how do you Mount image or burn it?
,mixwhite,2009-12-29T18:04Z,the graphic is quite dissappointing...
,copavi_gubavac,2010-01-22T01:36Z,"i read comments & was convinced that they were wrong...
well, they were right
steer clear... crap..."
,whiteland,2010-04-02T04:47Z,"this is the best game EVER!! only one prob. 
BLACK SCREEN!!!"
,PHHN,2011-04-10T23:18Z,"Why so many files? Cant u just put it into one?... GOD
So for all of you guys who wanna download games off here. Try youtube-ing gameplay footage and see if u like the game. Under my opinion. This game sucks. But Ill still donwload. IDK why.

It's not a GAME, its a SIMULATOR used to practice your driving skills. Like pros, this aint a game.

More seeders!"
,rawf5943,2011-06-26T22:56Z,its not a game lmao can you guys seriously read
