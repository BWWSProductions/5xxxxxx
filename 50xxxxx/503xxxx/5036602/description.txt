This is not the complete concert. It is the pre-fm source (Westwood One) I have. It`s an upgrade to earlier 

versions. It exists a bootleg called "A Night Up The Chimney" with following setlist:

01. Now I'm Here
02. Ogre Battle
03. White Queen (As It Began)
04. Queen Medley:
   Bohemian Rhapsody
   Killer Queen
   March Of The Black Queen
   Bohemian Rhapsody reprise
05. Bring Back That Leroy Brown
06. Brighton Rock / Son And Daughter reprise
07. Keep Yourself Alive
08. Liar
09. In The Lap Of The Gods... revisited
10. * Rock'n'roll medley:
   Big Spender!
   Jailhouse Rock
   Stupid Cupid
   Be Bop A Lula
   Jailhouse Rock reprise
   Shake Rattle & Roll
11. Seven Seas Of Rhye
12. ** See What A Fool I've Been
13. *** God Save The Queen

This seems to be the complete concert. But it`s fm sourced and the quality is inferior. Also tracks 10 up to 

13 are lossy, because these tracks were never broadcasted.

Enjoy
