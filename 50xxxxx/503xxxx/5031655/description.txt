What is Action Essentials 2?
Action Essentials 2 is a collection of stock footage elements for compositing. Ideal for visual effects & motion graphics.


720p High Definition: [ 1280 X 720 ] The 720p Version is ideal for SD and 720p work but many of the elements work great with 1080i projects as well. Especially effects like muzzle flashes and bullet holes, which are generally smaller in the frame.
