Hey, if you upload every folder in it's own torrent, it doesn't count as 14GB.
So, technicly, you could upload all of it that way... (A)"

Plus I love this idea of you putting it in seperate parts. Makes it much easier to decide which things i want to download and what things i dont need.


Great job!"
