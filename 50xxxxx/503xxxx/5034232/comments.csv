I am interested, what has made you to start ripping in AVI/XVID format instead of MPG?
And why do you do now the picture's relosution less then 720 pixels (horizontal)? Is there some special reason for that?"

[V],2nafish,2009-08-01T13:21Z,I switched to AVI/XVID format because the files are smaller and the quality is the same. I tried several resolutions and 640 X 480 looked the best on my computer.
