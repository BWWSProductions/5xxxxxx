Question: Does downloading or opening the file requere a special program?
In that case: what program 
Best regards from L"

,mob77,2009-08-04T23:38Z,"This did not work for me....like the last three activators i've tried!!! 

Have Vista Ultimate installed and this was the third activator i've tried where it looks like it's gonna work, till it auto restarts, then while rebooting i'm left with nothing more than a black screen with a blinking cursor bar (and the OS doesn't load).

Am I doing something wrong? Or have I just not yet found a working activator???
"
[T],zingooo,2009-08-04T23:44Z,"the activator worked for me,u try to install the file exe again"
,kasubhat,2009-08-05T02:32Z,try one click activator by clony
,ktarbox,2009-08-16T04:57Z,Will this make it so vista won't expire after x amount of days?
,ragingbull1968,2009-08-16T20:13Z,Thanks man good torrent :-)
,salami91280,2009-08-26T13:46Z,Thank you so much !
,mtracker_2009,2009-08-30T17:10Z,"how do I make this work? I opened the exe file and selected my version of Vista then hit ok. after that, nothing happened. is that supposed to happen? :\"
,sapien52,2009-09-02T00:52Z,"WORKED! I tried a few before this with no luck. I downloaded this one today, ran it, waited a bit for it to add the key, then waited a bit more to tell me it's activated, and then restarted. Upon restart Vista said it was activated. So far, so good."
,hosted2008,2009-10-04T06:08Z,"greit, this one worked for me, and passed thru kaspersky! thank you"
,LarryH,2009-10-08T04:43Z,"Excellent Job!

I started getting the WGA ""Not Genuine"" messages and nags about a month ago.

I first attempted with the ""run"" command (right click > run) and it did not work.

I then right clicked on the file and chose ""Run As Administrator"".  It asked the Vista version then after I selected it, nothing happened for a minute or two then it started downloading updates then rebooted.  After reboot, all of the nags and warnings were GONE!    "

,perrlock,2010-01-20T02:04Z,works like a charm thanks
,lucib,2010-01-24T17:52Z,"Vista Crack works fine, but you should not use in dual boot when you will not be able to RESTART your PC, it sort of crashes because the crack may have something to do with the MBR section of Vista. You can only POWER OFF PC and only after that you can boot in either OS you may have installed.

Tried to fix the MBR in the usual way, and the genuine vista activation dissapears and you get the 30 day trial version back. 

It is excellent crack because it is working fine but it still needs work to be done. Thank you for the upload. Bye!"
,XiaKangli,2010-02-08T01:07Z,I love you..... ?
,BostonRippah,2010-02-09T05:49Z,"Worked great, just run as administrator and you should be all set. It took a while to execute and i thought i wasnt responding at times but if you just wait it works great. Also i got quite a few error dialouge boxes while i was running it but i just clicked through those for a while and when i restarted i was all activated. Great upload!

,rob2170,2010-04-30T12:43Z,"I joined as a member just to leave f/b about this. Some stuff on PB is a load of crap, but this is PERFECT. Turned off updates, just in case, but it now says that ""Windows has been activated"". Zingooo, you're a top, top man. Thanks."
,jweasel,2010-05-04T03:45Z,did not work for Vista Home Premium Service Pack 1 (64 bit)
,elwood111,2010-07-16T08:07Z,"worked great,  I downloaded a torrent of vista, burned it to a disk, installed it not filling in the activation code, then pluged in the flash drive with this crack on it, ran it, now i have activated vista with an oem #.  THANK YOU!!!"
,nirgoen,2010-08-26T06:54Z,Thanks for the upload
,Marcholt,2010-09-02T22:19Z,Attemption of running it under vista 64 home premium resulted with real mess and as a result: re-installation  of whole OS....beware. 
,vivatpb5776,2010-09-27T01:35Z,"Attempted Ultimate activation twice. Both times, I received a Windows Script Host message indicating, ""Installed Product Key 6F2D7-2PCG6-YQQTB-FWK9V-932CC successfully."" However, after the restart, I am still prompted that I have 30 days to activate Windows. The only thing I noticed is that this torrent references, ""...work on every version of Vista with or not SP1."" However, my installation has SP2. Since this is a new installation, I will reinstall Ultimate and attempt to activate before I do any Windows Updates."
,vivatpb5776,2010-09-27T02:58Z,"No dice. I reinstalled Ultimate and, without applying any Windows Updates, I ran the patch. I still get the 30 day prompt."
,jayden2013,2010-10-25T01:12Z,Works Great
,shanyie,2010-11-09T10:11Z,"This works with SP2 to or just SP1?

Thanks a lot!"
,nym_eveningfall,2010-11-18T16:49Z,I just used this and it works great. It's been extremely frustrating trying to find an activation for my PC and Microsoft support hasn't been much help. The best advice I can give is when buying a used PC be certain the operating system installed is the original or you may end up having several issues. My OS is back to it's original settings of Vista Home Premium with both service pack 1 & 2.
,haguey666,2011-01-26T16:58Z,"Brilliant, the most straight forward crack ive ever used, for you lot who it didnt work for.....haha get a new pc tight twats"
