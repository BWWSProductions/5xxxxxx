"Why R U?" is a song performed by American R&B singer Amerie. The song was recorded for her fourth studio album, In Love & War, and serves as the lead single from the album. It will be Amerie's first buzz single under the Island Def Jam Music Group.

The song samples Ultramagnetic MCs' "Ego Trippin" from their 1988 release Critical Beatdown (which also samples Melvin Bliss' "Synthetic Substitution").

"'Why R U?' is about being in a relationship and hating that youâ€™re so attached to this person,â€ explains Amerie. â€œA lot of the songs on this album deal with wanting to be done with a relationship but youâ€™re just not really ready to leave, so you hang around and wait for a person to change. I really wanted the lyrical content to be real conversation. I didnâ€™t want anything to be sugar-coated.â€

A official remix premiered on Hot 97 on July 21, it features Nas, Jadakiss, Rick Ross and Kain. The remix samples Whodini's "One Love."

The video for "Why R U?" was shot during the second week of May in Los Angeles with director Ray Kay, who directed videos like Christina Milian's "Us Against the World" and Enrique Iglesias' "Takin' Back My Love". Amerie's idea behind the video, "I wanted to go with something really abstract but not too far out there, something that would look graphic." The video premiered on 106 & Park on BET on June 8.
