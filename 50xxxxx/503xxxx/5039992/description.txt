A great show from Whitley Bay's TYGERS OF PAN TANG recorded live at London's Paris Theatre in March of 1981, on the "Spellbound" Tour.
Tygers Of Pan Tang were one of the classic NWOBHM bands, with their first two albums (the raw, simplistic but effective Wild Cat and the more polished Spellbound) being two of the better albums of the era. (See also First Kill, released in '86 but featuring the debut album lineup and consists of various then-unreleased early tracks). Spellbound is also notable for including a young John Sykes on guitar, who would later go on to fame and fortune with Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, and Blue Murder. The band's decision to move to a more mainstream, pop-metal sound on their subsequent releases was in retrospect a questionable move, as fans of the early material were turned off and the anticipated new audience never really materialized. Amidst lineup changes and poor reviews, the band finally called it a day after the release of Burning In The Shade.
