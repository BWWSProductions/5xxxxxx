,ctnyboi,2009-08-04T07:25Z,Sweet!  I've been looking for this!
,grobe262,2009-08-20T22:52Z,"It's out of synch, so annoying, i been looking for this for ages, thanks anyway to the OP at least i got to watch some."
,Klundyke,2009-08-26T04:41Z,"Is the synching issue something that can be fixed using VLC player? If not, is there a chance that you can re-rip and re-up this? I've been searching high and low for this documentary since October. This is the first time I've seen it anywhere. Thanks!"
,grobe262,2009-08-26T20:22Z,"I use vlc and it don't synch up, i too have been looking for this for months and have only found it here, really disapointing, if anyone fixes it let me know. cheers."
,Klundyke,2009-08-27T05:09Z,"Wait, so does it go in and out of synch, or does it just go out of synch once? If it just happens once, I might be able to fix it. However, if it keeps going in and out of synch, then it just needs to re-ripped. "
,grobe262,2009-08-29T00:16Z,"It goes out of synch for a couple hours then back in sych i believe. if you can fix it, please tell me how."
,Klundyke,2009-08-29T03:44Z,"Depends. Does that just happen once? Or is it a frequent in and out, in and out? I might be able to extract the audio, and adjust the framerate of the video to match the audio. But that's only if the video is pure. Are there any moments were the video skips, freezes or does anything abnormal? How about the audio? are there any moments where it pauses or does something weird?"
,Klundyke,2009-08-31T11:49Z,"Yeah, this is fucked. There's a chunk of the video missing, and that's what is throwing it off by a lot. I'd say 3 minutes are missing of the video."
,DcGamer05,2009-09-15T22:29Z,Im sorry guys Im going to try to fix this soon Ill post a new torrent. Sorry it didnt work out I was in a rush the first time to get it out since no one has posted it. 
,Klundyke,2009-09-16T00:21Z,"Yes, please reupload! You have no idea how long I've been trying to track this down. I was so surprised to see this one here, only to be utterly disappointed by the audio, haha. But yeah, please, please, please re-rip and re-up. It would be supremely appreciated, and I will seed for a long time. "
,litz2010,2009-10-09T05:30Z,is there still going to be a re-up?
