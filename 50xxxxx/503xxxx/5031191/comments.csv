,Green_Banana,2009-08-03T19:12Z,"Maybe people wouldn't think it was a virus if you didn't get all anti-Semitic about it?  As Freud said, sometimes a program crack is just a program crack.  But then who's worse in the end, a bunch of lunatics who tried to genocide all of Europe, or a bunch of prepubescents who don't know how to spell genocide?  By the way, Satan and the Nazis don't really go together, and I'd know about Satan.  "
