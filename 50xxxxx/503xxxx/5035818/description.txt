The Yardbirds - Ultimate!
"They were the first great guitar supergroup of rock 'n' roll. Important and influential, they were the forerunners of heavy metal, psychedelic music, the extended guitar solo, and that staple of rock improvisation, the "jam." As one of the first of the early British blues bands, they honed their chops backing such visiting American blues legends as Sonny Boy Williamson. They also expanded the possibilities of what could be done in the confines of a three-minute pop single and made some grand, glorious noise in the process"
