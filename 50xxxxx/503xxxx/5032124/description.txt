They lived for 150 million years but, as big a force as pterosaurs were in the history of life, they have largely remained a mystery to scientists. Now, with the help of amazing special effects and engineering, learn about remarkable new discoveries that have shed light on the lives of these creatures. Witness as a team of engineers reconstruct and fly a mechanized pterosaur to illustrate how an animal that large could have ever flown. Journey back in time as National Geographic recreates the prehistoric world of these winged giants through animation and cutting-edge CGI for a glimpse into the life and death of these fascinating creatures.
