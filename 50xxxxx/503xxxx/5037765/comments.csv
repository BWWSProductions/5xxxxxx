You say it, Joe.
Only FLAC is the real deal for classical music or any other kind of music that needs to me listened at highest qualitiy - but i'll load it anyway.
Just for sure ... ;-)

Will seed as long as i can. :-)

--------------------------------------------------------
Smart - any uploads i do are mp3 players. there are lots of different kinds of players out thiere, So the highest bit rate (i think) they will all play is 320kbps.
I know apple do a lossless but i dont its compatible with other mp3 players.
I would think over the next few years you will see a new portable player(s) been able to play flac.

I dont think there is too much wrong with this torrent otherwise you would not still have 280 people still seeding this.
Turn off your anti virus and download this again.
