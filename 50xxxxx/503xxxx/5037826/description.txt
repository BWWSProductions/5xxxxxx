Storyline: Does good necessarily follow good intentions? Barry B. 
Benson, a bee who's just finished his education and hates the idea of picking a life-long vocation, 
meets a human, florist Vanessa Bloom, while buzzing about Manhattan. She takes him to a supermarket 
where Barry discovers shelves and shelves of honey. Realizing it has been taken from bees - who work 
tirelessly and exhaust themselves for their two cups a year - he follows the delivery truck back to 
the honey farm, gathers evidence, and files suit against humanity. But what if Barry wins and the 
honey is returned to the bees, who can then slack off? An ecological cataclysm?
