Application description
Episode 21: Flipping the Bird (for real this time)

The island has a new visitor, a flying Dodo bird with gastrointestinal troubles. Poke the bird to drop bird bombs on the pygmies. See how many you can hit consecutively without missing! The bird will go after caught fish (but look out if a pygmy is holding the fish!) Try grabbing the bird and cooking him! Or striking him with lightning!

Achievements are now recorded on Feint where you can unlock icons of achievement levels: Minion, Shaman, Demi-God, God.

We are continuing the update but more complex updates are forcing us to take more time to get them right. Remember, your purchases keep us updating so spread the word! And updates are always FREE. For reviews and other info check out the Pocket Blog:


What kind of god would you be? Benevolent or vengeful? Play Pocket God and discover the answer within yourself. On a remote island, you are the all-powerful god that rules over the primitive islanders. You can bring new life, and then take it away just as quickly. Exercise your powers on the islanders. Lift them in the air, alter gravity, hit them with lightning...you're the island god! All god powers are demonstrated in Pocket God's help menu.

Pocket God is an episodic microgame for you to explore, show your friends and have fun with. We have been growing the game with the help of player suggestions! What sort of godly powers would you like to see added?
