,Ling_Fu,2010-02-20T23:34Z,"How do I get this to run on my comp? I put it into magic disc (as it's an ISO file), but all it does it open it up for me to explore."
,inoksvere,2010-02-26T09:59Z,"@Ling_Fu this is the ps2 version so you need to download a ps2 emulator, get bios and .dll files and crap for it to run. unless of course you have a modded ps2 and want to burn it to a disc and play it on your ps2"
,Water-lily,2010-03-02T11:16Z,"Hi. I've burned the image, but my ps 2 (modded) isn't play it. Is anybody know why? What about burning speed or burning settings?"
,Ling_Fu,2010-03-24T23:57Z,"inoksvere

Cheers. Would you give me a good link to get a ps2 em (so I can play it on my laptop), and briefly walk me through what I have to do? I downloaded an emulator, but have no idea what to do as it comes with no instructions."
,bmanfx,2010-10-24T08:32Z,this does not work in pcsx2. i think its a bad rip. 
,algieba78,2011-01-02T13:29Z,"This didn't work for me either. I believe the file isn't complete, other uploads of this game (not seeded, unfortunately) are over 300MB"
,Seksiboi,2011-09-29T04:43Z,not working for me either
,EugeneBrandon,2012-01-21T20:42Z,same here...not working...
,inoksvere,2012-06-19T10:44Z,"Ling Fu, sorry. I know this is a super late reply. However, if you still don't know and you happen to take a glance at this here:

My favorite (and the best PS2 Emulator) is PCSX2. You should be able to find one on TPB with everything you need. If not, google the emulator.

Then you'll need PS2 BIOS files. They are located on TPB. Search ""ps2 bios"" and after you download them put them in the bios folder which is in the emulator install area (where ever you put it)

After that you just mess with the settings to fit your PC to where it runs smooth. Personally, I turn on blend (the 2nd one) and makes the thing just look great and runs super smooth. 

With ISO and BIN files just open the program, file, open iso, find the file. if you have the ps2 disc you can use it too but you have to select your disc drive (don't go down the ISO path for this. Just normal CD stuff.)"
