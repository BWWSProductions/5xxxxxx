A COOKING CLASS WITH ZEN PRIEST AND CHEF EDWARD ESPE BROWN
Move over â€œZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance!â€ Here comes Zen and the Art of a Good Meal! Filmmaker Doris DÃ¶rrie turns her attention to Buddhism and that age-old saying, you are what you eat. In How To Cook Your Life, DÃ¶rrie enlists the help of the charismatic Zen Master Edward Espe Brown to explain the guiding principles of Zen Buddhism as they apply to the preparation of food as well as life itself. â€œHow a person goes about dealing with the ingredients for his mealsâ€ explains DÃ¶rrie â€œsays a lot about him. How To Cook Your Life teaches us to be attentive in our everyday dealings with the most mundane things and also open our eyes to one of the most beautiful occupations: cooking.â€
