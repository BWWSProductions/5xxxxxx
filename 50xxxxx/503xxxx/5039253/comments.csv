If you like the artists music buy the cd in stores and get the artwork and help support them in putting out new music. "
,g8aso,2009-08-03T10:12Z,"What a great effort wasted by using lousy JOINT stereo.

Joint stereo shares the data between the left and right channels lowering the high frequency sound and channel separation.
Proper stereo is much better, but still shares some data, but restores high frequencies and separation.
The only true MP3 stereo is Dual Channel when the left and right are totally separated and no loss of frquency responce occurs.
Only a very small increase in disk space for a vastly different sound quality.

Thanks for the effort though..........."
[T],EvilTSAngel,2009-08-19T20:21Z,Hold on i'll whip out my $5k stereo and see if we can hear a real difference........wait....dont' have one so unless your trying to put out studio quality sound on your home system who really cares....the disc sounds great
