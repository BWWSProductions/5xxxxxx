Hmm, but the title says CS4! Also, why on earth would anyone download the trial when they get it from Adobe directly?

They can even get a cracked version of CS4 from TPB easily. I suspect this torrent to be full of trojans."

You have the right to be suspisous. There are a lot of people out there who think it's fun to destroy for other people.

I won't encourage anyone to download this if you are unsure about it.
But I can asure you that I have put no Trojans, Spyware, Adware or Viruses in this torrent.


""Also, why on earth would anyone download the trial when they get it from Adobe directly?""
I have to disagree.
If you want to download this trial at Adobe-com, you have to register at their website. Most people do not have the time, or donì±„t just see the point, in registering.

I think it is important to have a legal alternative, for those who want this, without going through a bunch of registration-pages and that kind of crap. I know, I just hate that. :P


Further more, I've also uploaded the Photoshop CS3 software. And that... that's not so easy to get, since Adobe seems to throw their older versions in the carbage can when the new one arrives.


Additionally, I had som problems with the .torrent-size. It took me 14 tries and about 6 hours to figure it out ( WITH help ).

That's no time I have to spare for messing with people. Especially since I know what a kick in the nuts an infected computer can be...


Well, as I told you before: I have NOT added ANY kind of ""unwanted software"" into this, or any of my other torrents ( currently just 1 other ).
This only contains Adobe Photoshop CS4."
