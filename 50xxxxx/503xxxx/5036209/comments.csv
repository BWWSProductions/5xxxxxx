 How did you get rid of the hiss??
Also how did you divide into chapters?
What program do you use?
and when I experimented with VBR I found it produced files nearly 3x the size of CBR.

NOTE:
I also chose CBR because of its universal compatibility with hand held players. I found that quite a few of the older players will not decode VBR."

Thanks, I'm glad you're not mad. I originally just did it for myself, but I put so much effort into it that I thought I could re-release it. :)

For the hiss, I used Sound Forge 5 with the Noise Reduction plugin. It's terrific for cleaning up cassette and vinyl records, but its MP3 encoders suck.

Dividing the whole thing into chapters took me a while, but in Sound Forge I could actually ""see"" where the guy says ""chapter blahblah"" and I was able to chop it up (using SF again) in just 4 hours. If I did by ear, it would take me far longer.

I agree that CBR is probably a better choice for torrent, if you're looking for compatibility. I use VBR myself because I'm a fanatic about small sizes and originally I was just doing it for myself. The SF encoders suck, and I prefer the LAME encoder that comes built-in with Foobar 2000 for Windows. I did some experiments and decided that the VBR (V7 level which corresponds roughly to 100kbps CBR) produces the best quality for the smallest size, at least as far as speech goes. Foobar is also multithreaded, so if your PC has quad-core CPU, it can actually encoded 4 files at the same time. The only problem is that I was re-encoding your MP3 files so there was a slight quality loss, but for speech this isn't very noticable."

BTW, just out of curiosity, where did you find this book? I love personally. I'm a bit of a philosophy buff myself. You can sometimes catch me on Undernet's #philosophy channel. See you there. :)"
,tufgong,2009-08-18T04:52Z,Very Nice!  Thank you!
,hrmitcrb,2009-08-23T19:03Z,"I hereby nominate both tonytiger01 and renumeratedfrog for the Pirate Bay Nobel Prize.  Outstanding effort by you both!
Thank you!"
,scl52,2009-09-02T08:41Z,"has anyone else had problems with the mp3s cutting out midsentence on an ipod?
generally with about 2 seconds left on my ipods counter, he'll cut out midsentence and the next chapter plays, but on itunes each chapter will play in full"
,renumeratedfrog,2009-09-06T23:08Z,scl52: Some older MP3 players might not be able to handle VBR properly. I have a similar problem with iAudio which is about 4 years old. The first MP3 will get cut off about 30-60 seconds from the end and I will just listen to silence. But all the next MP3's after that play fine. 
,carlosjrincon,2009-10-13T22:06Z,big THANKS!!!!!!!
,gasman364,2009-10-31T18:40Z,"I've not yet listened, but I am so impressed with the care, time and effort apparently put into creating this torrent of a classic work.  Renumeratedfrog . . . you are to be commended.  Thank you so much."
,tstanley,2009-11-10T01:05Z,Very well done. Do you know the name of the narrator?
,renumeratedfrog,2009-11-29T09:44Z,He says his name at the end  of the book and it sounds like Jeffrey (possibly Geoffrey) Sherman.
,olphus3,2009-12-03T07:58Z,It's great that the seeders outnumber the leechers - which is unusual.
,phish1999,2009-12-13T05:14Z,"Thanks for Russell material. Loved his ""Why I Am Not A Christian"" speech. I hope this is just as logical and brilliant."
,joyfreak,2010-01-24T17:53Z,Thanks Tonytiger01 and renumeratedfrog for all your hard work.  Brings a tear to my eye... just beautiful
,Gport,2010-02-11T16:04Z,wow!  thanks so much.  these are the types of torrents I love to run into :)
,Evg222,2010-03-22T08:49Z,"As for the audio cutters, I myself tried lots of them and the only one I found which provides a single -second precision is EASY AUDIO CONVERTER - small in size, highly recommended.
The narrator' name is defitely Geoffrey Sherman.
Check out my uploads and you will find more cutted by chapters by me audiobooks."
,Croix1979,2010-10-31T14:56Z,This is awesome. So glad I found this. I appreciate all your hard work. you guys are great.
