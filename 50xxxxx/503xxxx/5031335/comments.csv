,cacarot,2009-07-31T15:18Z,"thank you ... have you seen Murray Carter's video (do you have it?).  If so how does this compare?  I heard this is a good solid guide.

Thanks again"

No I don't have them 
(there are two,  Intro to and Advanced) 

If anyone has them I would love to add them to my collection"
,majtymicke,2009-08-02T23:30Z,Is the Swedish Chef in this one? ;)
,cacarot,2009-08-05T07:13Z,If I get a hold of either I will be sure to share ... thanks for this one it is a good basic guide.  Heard Murray's advanced goes into some more detail but has a lot of stuff you could do without.  He's got that weird humor you either like or don't like.  Thanks KnifemakerC ... I would like to make a knife one day when I can afford (time and money) to learn.

,salo99,2010-03-30T01:07Z,"Yeah, I've been trying to find that Murray Carter knife sharpening video too. That dude knows sharpening. As he says, 99% is technique and he proves it by using a brick to sharpen a machete, stropping with a newspaper and then giving himself a perfect shave with it! His prices are crazy though. Somebody needs to rip that vid :)"
,rustydog47,2010-05-29T16:43Z,"+1 for Murray Carter, I would like to have his videos."
,brianxxx,2010-08-10T22:42Z,"Very nice! Thanks!

Yeah, the Murray Carter series would be a nice addition. Come on rich bastards...buy them and upload them! lol"
