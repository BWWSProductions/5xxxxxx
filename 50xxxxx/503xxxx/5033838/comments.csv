,coco135,2009-08-04T22:12Z,"tmemphis thank you your comment helped me getting my office 08 up and running again!

And thanx to coco38's for the original post"
,Lunabomber,2009-08-10T20:19Z,"there is no key? i am not upgrading, so what the hell? anyone got a key?"
,tinglethefairy,2009-08-13T23:00Z,Thanks so much for this! Great torrent; works fine. and I averaged around 250 kb/s. Great work.
,hornsfan2112,2009-08-14T05:39Z,"Thanks to jedego and tmemphis. Key worked great, and didn't have to reinstall or download anything.

Shame on me for leaving auto-updates turned on. First time I've ever had problem with an install, but following these instructions and using the indicated key worked fine for me. Thanks! "
,hesselden,2009-08-17T23:33Z,"i have tried, as to the blogs and still nothing working. HELP"
,snowtahoe,2009-08-29T07:54Z,"@tmemphis 

that what i did and it worked 
""""""""  As per COCO38's instructions

If you have updated, you need to remove the file 

/Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Office/OfficePID.plist

and also this file if it exists Remove it as well:

your_username/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/Office 2008/Microsoft Office 2008 settings.plist

then openM$ Word and enter this key (thanks jedego) :
W339P-JRCPB-XX8XD-YK49M-7DYCW 

This worked for me like a treat
Enjoy Office 2008    """""""""""""
,vimal007,2009-08-30T07:12Z,i have downloaded the file but it does not run
,DoctorX101,2009-09-13T14:47Z,"Thanks!  Great seeding!

To save some headaches, learn from my stupidity!  If you click ""Get Info"" on the individual Applications like Word AFTER the update to 12.2.1 they will say ""12.2.0"" leading you to believe 12.2.1 did not update.  You will cry, throw things, waste time.

Check the ""About"" of the product after you open after a restart: it will say ""Latest Installed Update: 12.2.1"""
,tbluge,2009-09-30T02:27Z,I have latest updates on office 08 and tmephis's instructions worked great!  Thanks!
,MrHaroHaro,2009-10-13T09:56Z,Just a quick and probably dumb question. I followed tmephis' instructions (thanks!!) and everything works fine. Would I have any issues if someone on the same network is using the same serial number?
,Dermbet,2009-12-23T19:16Z,"Seems to work fine with the code provided below.

thanks for upload - appreciated"
,bnasak,2009-12-30T19:47Z,Note that you can use fk87c-mf3dm-6b4hc-mxrtp-xt4db in case you have issues after 12.2.3
,wsender,2010-01-29T15:24Z,Any particular reason why this disk image won't mount? The image tries to mount and I get a 'not recognized' error. Do I need 10.5.x?

,jmactacular,2010-04-07T04:11Z,"If anyone tries to update this version and gets the error:

""There is a problem with the office data base"" dialogue box every time office opens.  Here is the solution:

Delete the ""Main Identity"" and ""Main Identity Backup"" folders located in

Empty trash, restart and that's it.
