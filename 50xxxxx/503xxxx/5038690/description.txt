[taken from the description on the Wikileaks page]
This confidential 210 page file presents an exposure analysis of 205 companies or groups from around the world each owing the Icelandic bank Kaupthing 45 million to 1250 million euros. Not long after producing this internal report, the bank collapsed.

Kaupthing's borrowers have or had operations in most countries.

Kaupthing previously operated in at least 13 countries, including all the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The bank's motto, prominently displayed in this report is Think Beyond.

Within 24 hours of releasing the document, WikiLeaks received a legal threat from Kaupthing's lawyers.

At 18:55 GMT Sat Aug 1, Iceland's national broadcaster, RÃšV, had its 19:00 nightly newscast enjoyed to prevent reporting the document. Instead RÃšV showed a link to this page.

According to the popular Iceland Weather Report site, the injunction was ordered by the ReykjavÃ­k District Commissioner, one RÃºnar GuÃ°jÃ³nsson. As it happens, the son of the ReykjavÃ­k District Commissioner, GuÃ°jÃ³n RÃºnarsson, is head of the Icelandic Financial Services Association and one of the top spokesmen for the failed banks. Among other things, he has fought to have the stateâ€™s Housing Financing Fund [which supplies the general public with affordable mortgages] abolished so that the banks could have exclusive dibs on the mortgage market.

Another son of the District Commissioner is Frosti Reyr RÃºnarsson, who just happens to be the former head of Kaupthingâ€™s securities brokerage division and one of the recipients of Kaupthingâ€™s infamous bullet loans.[1]

An article in Visir based on this document revealed that loans made to the core investors of Kaupthing [the brothers ÃgÃºst and LÃ½Ã°ur GuÃ°mundsson], and companies owned by them, amounted to some ISK 300 billion [USD 2.3 bn / EUR 1.6 bn].

Robert Tchenguiz, a member of the board of Exista [owned by the brothers] received loans of some ISK 330 billion.

Ã“lafur Ã“lafsson, he who once flew in Elton John to perform at his birthday bash [and who is associated with shipping company Samskip], received a loan of some ISK 140 billion.

Companies associated with the Baugur family received a loan amounting to some ISK 320 billion at the current rate of exchange.
