GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Top-seed North Carolina beat 16th-seed Radford 101-58 today in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The Highlanders, who won the Big South and were playing in the NCAAs for the second time, were trying to become the first No. 16 seed to beat a No. 1 seed since the tournament expanded to 65 teams in 1985.

Amir Johnson and Joey Lynch-Flohr each scored 12 points for Radford. Wayne Ellington scored 25 for Carolina, which played without junior point guard Ty Lawson, who sat out his third consecutive game with a jammed right big toe. -- Darryl Slater
