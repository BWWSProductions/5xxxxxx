Thanks for the sample!"

One of the main characters is a little deaf girl, and there are several key sequences in the movie where she's speaking sign language. There are subs (you can see pixels at the very bottom of the screen) but almost completely cropped off and totally unreadble.

I guess the cammer/loader wanted to make it looks w-i-d-e-s-c-r-e-e-n.  Thanks, dumbass. "
