,psptina,2010-04-05T01:09Z,Thank you for this! Been looking all over for it. Will seed back 2x at least! Keep this one alive!! It's a rare bird.   Thanks!
,psptina,2010-04-05T19:58Z,Thank you u/l & seeders! Works as good as my orig disc (that had a very bad accident). Much appreciated!

,sbmkd,2011-03-19T22:09Z,"Nevermind, used different burning software and it burned and plays great. THANKS NOOBISH"
