,OverZOcean,2009-08-17T09:40Z," Hello everybody, Rosetta Stone V3 is a perfect program for learning languages- I'll be grateful for having Rosetta Stone V3 TURKISH here. If smb. has it please upload to thepiratebay.org TNX :)"
,afgjas19,2009-08-19T05:17Z,anyone have rosetta for hindi all leveles of v3?
,ChazInMT,2009-10-17T08:53Z,"For what it's worth, I got this to work by extracting the 4 files on this and placing them on a DVD.  I made 2 coasters by trying to put the .iso file on a cd and using it.  I had earlier downloaded the core Rosetta by deselecting all the languages on one of the more popular V3 Rosetta torrents and only downloaded the core, working good so far."
,vwilk,2010-01-13T08:25Z,Do you guys think you could give me the name of the original Rosetta Stone that you guys downloaded so that my program will work? I'm just not 100% sure what to do next with it though. Once I d/l it will this Torrent work?
