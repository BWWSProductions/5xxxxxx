Series one host Robert Llewellyn is joined by co-host Cathy Rogers.

(As I missed recording - 2x01 - Flying Machine, I have 2x02 onward)

This series the teams are a tad more sophisticated-looking in their appearance having been given new 'uniforms'.

In the red overalls are "The Chemical Brothers" consisting of Pat Westlake, Paul Hoff and Rob Flint. They're joined by expert David Rainer.

In the purple overalls are "Brothers In Arms" consisting of (now) Colonel Dick Strawbridge and his 2 brothers Major David Strawbridge & Captain Bobby Strawbridge. They're joined by expert Dr. Derek Alsop.

The challenge : build a cannon and fire 3 shots at a target on a military firing range. The team who scores the most hits goes through to the finals.

(The video doesn't run 'true' for unknown reasons, apologies).

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 1.5) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. So please, do your part.
