I love his voice! If I was rish Id pay him to walk with me and narrate my life or read the telephone book. I am SEEDING! THANK YOU!!!!"

,sgzelle016,2011-06-08T05:20Z,please help to download this torrent.. i really dont know how to download it.. pls! thanks!
,ppetty,2011-07-08T01:39Z,"i am hesitant to download this due to my experience with audiobook torrents.  its seems to be pretty common for chunks to be missing.  ends of chapters, entire ones even, random bits, etc.  can anyone confirm wether there is any missing audio?  i cant afford the time, let alone the bandwidth, to get something incomplete"
,pyro126,2011-07-08T02:17Z,Jim dale is wonderful and so are you! Thank you very much for this amazing UL!
