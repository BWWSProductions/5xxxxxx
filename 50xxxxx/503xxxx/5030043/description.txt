Second solo album, following 2007's Are You Listening, from former frontwoman of the phenomenally successful 90s Irish alternative band The Cranberries. Expanding on the indie rock sound of her debut, this album sees O'Riordan exploring a range of styles including a funky, bluesy hard rock feel as exemplified by lead track The Journey. The free download Stupid and a re-recorded version of Apple Of My Eye from Are You Listening are also included.
