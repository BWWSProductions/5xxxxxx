From GetRightMusic.com:

The Cheech and Chong of the new class release a brand new mixtape together featuring all new music that the duo recorded together over the past few months. How Fly showcases Curren$y and Wiz Khalifaâ€™s love for the stoned life, but it maybe my favorite music from these two so far. They each have had their own mixtapes in the past (search the site) but together they seem to bring out the best. So break out some big bambuâ€™s, put it in the air and lay back to the fly sounds of Curren$y and Wiz.
