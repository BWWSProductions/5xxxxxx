Seriously A VERY GOOD book.......


Who Is This Book For?

This book is valuable to all Windows XP users. Even users of Windows NT 4 and 2000 and
Windows 95/98/Me may find good information in this book, though it is primarily oriented
toward Windows XP.

    This book is intended for:

 â€¢ General users who use Windows XP at their desks and are responsible for their own
computer(s). Typically, these users don't have responsibility for other users'
computers, though they may help their friends out from time to time.

 â€¢ System administrators who are responsible for an organization's computers (and
perhaps thousands of Windows XP installations). Administrators will be presented
with virtually every conceivable problem over a given period of time. Whatever can
go wrong will; Murphy's Law is applied double to system administrators.

 â€¢ Help desk staff who support users, even if they don't usually administer the system.
Help desk staff roam throughout the organization, providing help and assistance as
needed. All help desk people are going to find this book very useful.
If you are a user who wants to get the most out of your Windows XP installation (either Home
Edition, Professional, or one of the upcoming .NET Server versions), this book is a very good
starting point. Think of it this way: If you are a system administrator, this book is one of the
tools that you will need to manage and administer your Windows XP network. Manning the
help desk? If so, having this book close at hand can save you lots of time and effort.
