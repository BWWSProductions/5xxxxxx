Emergency Medicine is not divided into specific areas of practice. Emergency room visitors come in all shapes and sizes, at any time of day or night, with a wide range of maladies. Emergency physicians need to become experts in diverse areas of medicine and to be able to make quick and informed decisions about patient care. A cornerstone of emergency medicine training is the constant drilling and re-drilling of simulated cases and clinical scenarios. This book offers a unique yet underutilized strategy for learning: a case-based approach from real patients and actual events. Each case provides the opportunity for learning essential clinical concepts. Focused exclusively on the needs of in-training emergency physicians and nurses, the book covers more than 100 common and unusual cases in emergency medicine. The procedures have been class-tested by the Stanford/Kaiser Emergency Medicine Residency Program.
