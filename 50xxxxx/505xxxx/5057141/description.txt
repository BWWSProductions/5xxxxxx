This is another fine quality release from my hands, two guaranteed clean ISOs that comprise Visual Studio 2005 Disc 1 and Disc 2.

These do not include the MSDN library, so if you want that or need it, you'll need the DVD release which has been uploaded here a ton of times beforehand.

Other than that, no CD key is needed, they are just straight ISOs from Microsoft.

Just burn and play, burn and play. Daemon Tools works really well for this too.

I downloaded these from DreamSpark (www.dreamspark.com) if anyone has a question as to their source.
