,jaireth,2009-08-18T07:38Z,AVIs are sooo 2008. :P
[T],netviper,2009-08-18T07:38Z,"there has not been a low res version of s5e11 posted to usenet. I was suprised to see the 720p version out there so early. I posted this same thing 20 min before EZTV and people were claiming it was fake DRM needed. 

I doubt there will be a low-res version till later tonight. It's good to see that the newsgroups are still the first place things get released, then the torrent sites pick them up and spread them."
