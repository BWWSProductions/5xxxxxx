,Ichigo0Soul,2011-01-17T10:48Z,Japanese Audio w/ English Subs. It says it in the torrent description at the top of the page.
,HonruDios,2011-06-01T04:05Z,"Fantastic upload, 10/10 Audio and video. One oddity though, the episode titled 24 is in fact episode 15. Might just be me, but the episode starts with Sephiria pointing her sword at Train. If that's the case, it's epsiode 15."
,Ichigo0Soul,2011-06-06T00:12Z,It's technically episode 14.5. An episode in between 14 and 15. I probably should have named it that instead of 24.
