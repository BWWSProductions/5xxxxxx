,Sunseeker908,2009-08-15T16:43Z,"Before I jump on this one, does anyone have this in 1080p DTS?  File size doesn't matter.  I like the quality."
,Lightmanone,2009-08-15T17:05Z,"I agree with sunseeker908, can anyone upload the 1080p version? thnx already!"
,IronBars,2009-08-15T20:15Z,"Yeah...great upload, but 1080p is always best"
,verbose2,2009-08-17T07:59Z,"nice to see an unrarred version of a film right up here with the shitty rarred version!

People are finally realizing just how retarded it is wasting 2x the disk space"
,bulletcowboy,2009-08-18T22:12Z,there isn't that much difference in 1080p & 720p blu-ray rips unless you have 20/20 vision... Jeez if you want it perfect hire the fucking movie
,Harutik_11,2009-08-19T00:40Z,"Awesome rip, incredible movie +1"
,Daiemio,2009-08-20T23:15Z,What kind of Player shuld a person use to play Blueray material in computer?
,koolaid09,2009-08-21T18:11Z,"Definitely a Blu-Ray player unless you have at least a dual core with a high end video card and of course all the proper codecs, (i recommend Klite mega codec pack), PS3 has been workin great for me just use a program like mkv2vob to transcode DTS if you dont have a DTS soundsystem (I use AC3)  and split it into 4 GB files cuz of good ol FAT32 lol. Hope I helped

Koolaid "
,caliwillbemine,2009-08-21T23:27Z,"Great rip!

,Ares-The-Wreckless,2009-09-09T04:21Z,lol i cant believe you r not satisfied with 720p i mean damn ur gettin this for free when ppl r buyin at 30 bucks quit acting spoiled
,jockepocke0,2009-09-10T11:30Z,"Koolaid 
ur a little wrong there :P u do not need a high end comp to play high qualtiy movies.
i can even play it with my 6 year old laptop xD
its just to keep all the crap out of ur comp and use a good medie player :P VLC with CCCP codex will run anything and everything.
im watching it on my 10 year old server comp xD so much for high end stuff ey?"
,vassago419,2009-09-12T21:31Z,whats with the subtitles? can they be turned off?
,matthensley,2009-11-08T15:29Z,"i can see everyting in hd after watchin ass traffic at 1980/1280 pic resolution. fk sake these uploads are better than the shit you hire at the shop, fukin respect due dude nice 1."
,matthensley,2009-11-08T15:31Z,"vlc is fukin shite it wont play mp4s, media player classic will though, safe"
[V],-jonny-,2010-03-25T20:49Z,Get the original trilogy here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5463698/X-Men.Trilogy.2000-2006.720p.BluRay.x264-TLF
,faaaaq,2011-07-10T16:00Z,"jockepocke0, your laptop and server computer are highly, HIGHLY unlikely actually playing it at full bitrate in full quality.  your old laptop obviously doesnt have a high quality screen, and it would be stuid to have a nice monitor for a 10 year old server comp unless you were loaded.  which you arent, otherwise you wouldnt have a 4 y/o laptop and 10 y/o server"
,JellyFaceJade93No1,2011-08-20T22:11Z,"Thanks dude this is the best :) I mean I have been looking for this for a very long time. If I don't download this now I will in the morning :D Thanks again dude :)
JellyFaceJadeTaylor :P"
