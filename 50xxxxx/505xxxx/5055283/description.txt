TV : Documentary : Other quality : English


This ground-breaking TV documentary follows the speedy destruction of the native Indian tribes as the Europeans lust for more land changed the face of the North Americas for ever.

Unfortunately this fascinating documentary which was made in the 1980s has not been released on DVD and therefore I have had to convert from VHS video tape. This means the quality is not brilliant, but this is more than made up for by the quality of the documentary.


Enjoy and Seed!!
