,comairis,2009-08-16T05:46Z,I have to comment...Content was the best and more then I expected. Even included all elements. Install prefers Windows SP3 installed do you have to install first. Any negative comments to CandyCoatedDrugz is bull. Thanks CandyCoatedDrugz for one of your best.
,silverkey131,2009-08-16T13:31Z,"It would help if someone seeded. For pity sake; It's SHARING, not TAKING!"
,Jeanette614,2009-08-16T15:51Z,"When I add this to UTorrent, it says that it exceeds the file limit. I know there's a way to change that. Do you know what it is?"
,Mukwa,2009-08-16T19:49Z,"Hi there all, Im pretty new to all of this but just like to say TWO THUMBS UP to Candycoated for this ""just-what-I-needed"" torrent! I'll be seeding it for a long time!

,neverme23,2009-08-31T00:10Z,"Look people. If you like to download, then YOU MUST upload!!!!   I use utorrent and I'm downloading this file @ 1.1 MB/s. This is how you get the speeds you are looking for. Go to about tab on the utorrent window. Go to show statistics. My total ratio is 12.552. I leave the computer on and unlimited speed of uploads. Yes, it's painful of the first 2 weeks. After that, I get what I want. FAST!!!!!!!!"
,neverme23,2009-08-31T00:16Z,"forgot to mention. When I started downloading this torrent, Seeders 1 /    Leechers 346.   So I'll get it before at least 300 others will. Go figure."
,the_Masq,2009-09-06T03:05Z,"Does the activation disabler work on windows 7?
Does anyone know which URLs/IPs to block to stop CS4 from calling home?"
