Acronis True Image Home 2009 v12.0.9788

Acronis True Image Home 2009 complete PC protection: back up your entire PC, including the OS plus your data, applications, pictures, video, financial documents, settings and everything!

Acronis True Image Home 2009 is an award-winning backup and recovery solution for a good reason: it protects your PC after just one click and allows you to recover from viruses, unstable software downloads, and failed hard drives. Create an exact copy of your PC and restore it from a major failure in minutes, or back up important files and recover them even faster.

Full Feature Listing
New!One-clickâ„¢ protection
Initially, you decide what, where and when to back up. After that, backups occur automatically or with just one click.
New!Full text search
You will be able to search for files through multiple archives by name or by a part of the name and then restore individual files easily and quickly. You can also perform searches of the files content.
New!Zip archive format support available
In addition to Acronis' powerful TIB data compression backup format, one of the most densely compressed backup file types available to consumers, Acronis True Image Home 2009 also supports the popular ZIPÂ® format.
New!Windows VistaÂ® -style interface
The new, sleek interface of this product works on MicrosoftÂ® Windows XP and Vista operating systems.
New!Auto backup based on destination availability
Users can decide to back up automatically or as soon as a destination drive is available. Works jointly with existing scheduling.
New!Automatic computer shutdown after backup or restoration finishes
You can now perform a backup at night and go to sleep without bothering about turning off the computer. The PC will shut down when the back up is complete.
New!Archive to various places
You can save full, incremental and differential backups almost anywhere. You now you have ultimate flexibility in choosing a place to store from the same data series: on a network share, CD/DVD, USB stick, FTP-server, any local internal or external hard drive. You can now also give meaningful names to incremental and differential backups, for example, "C-drive-before-repartitioning".
Making reserve copies of your backups
You can make reserve copies of your backups and save them on a network drive, or a USB storage device. You have a choice of making a reserve copy as regular (flat) files, a zip compressed file, and a tib file.
Consolidation
You can define rules for consolidating your archives to reduce storage space. Merge an older full backup with several incremental backups to quickly create a new full backup; subsequent backups are based on the newly-created full backup.
Exclude Files and Folders
Back up only the data you want to keep and save disk space.
Migration tools
Make upgrades easier with built-in PC cloning and migration tools.
Migration tools make upgrades easier
PC cloning or adding a new disk is simple with Acronis True Image Home 2009's built-in migration tools. No longer must you reinstall the operating system, applications, or re-key user settings when you clone your PC or increase its storage capacity.
Security, performance and privacy tools
When you replace a hard drive on your PC, Acronis ensures you don't inadvertently give personal or organizational data to cyber thieves. Acronis Drive Cleanser, a $50 value is included at no charge. It protects sensitive data from view by wiping a disk clean of all data. If you don't need to erase the entire disk, File Shredder safely destroys individual files so they can't be resurrected. A System clean-up utility restores system efficiency.
