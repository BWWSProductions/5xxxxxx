Series of unique concerts featuring musicians from around the world. P J
Harvey brings some real rock and roll to the intimate venue of LSO St Luke's in
London, following the release of her solo album Uh Huh Her. She performs a
set that includes hits such as Big Exit, Dress, The Letter and Shame.

Polly Jean Harvey (born 9 October 1969) is an English musician and singersongwriter.
Raised in Corscombe, Dorset, Harvey formed the band (calling it
PJ Harvey) as a teenager with drummer Rob Ellis and bassist Ian Olliver, who
was replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio released their first album Dry in
1992. Ellis and Vaughan left the band after the release of Rid of Me (1993), and
Harvey continued as a solo artist.

Among the accolades she has received have been the 2001 Mercury Music
Prize, seven BRIT Award nominations, five Grammy Award nominations and
two further Mercury Music Prize nominations. Rolling Stone named her 1992's
Best New Artist and Best Singer Songwriter and 1995's Artist of the Year, and
placed two of her albums on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. She was also
rated the number one female rock artist by Q magazine in a 2002 reader poll.
Harvey has said that she enjoys performing more than writing and recording
because performing is when the music "makes more sense".
