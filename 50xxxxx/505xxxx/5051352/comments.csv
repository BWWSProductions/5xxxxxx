,neoriddler,2010-06-09T12:49Z,"Ok, from first glance it looks like this was a duplicate of Ep 139. Just double checked and it looks like they are different episodes that were just labeled wrong. The correct name for Ep 140 is ""Ulquiorra's Scheme, the Moment when the Sun Sets!"" not sure if 139 the right one or not, haven't watched that far yet. Thanks for the uploads though soagg, only thing I have run into as of yet is varying audio levels, video is almost perfect so keep up the good work."
