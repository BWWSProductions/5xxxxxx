Philip Jodidio, "Valode & Pistre Architects"
BirkhÃ¤user Basel | 2006 | ISBN: 3764372001 | PDF | 240 pages 

The firm of Denis Valode and Jean Pistre, which has been practicing for 25 years, entered upon a new phase of its career in 1992, when the architects â€” in cooperation with the landscape architect Kathryn Gustafson â€” received the Equerre dâ€™argent prize of the journal Le Moniteur for the Lâ€™OrÃ©al corporate headquarters outside Paris. Their predominantly large-scale projects are distinguished by their high degree of diversity. For some years, Valode & Pistre have not only been practicing in France, their native country, but also maintain offices in Germany, Italy, Great Britain, Russia, Mexico, China, and elsewhere.

This book contains detailed presentations of 18 projects by Valode & Pistre, with documentation focusing on the specific working and design methods of the architects. Projects presented include the Renault Technocentre in Guyancourt, France; the Las Mercedes business park in Madrid, Spain; a group of office and hotel towers in Beijing, China; and the Hyatt Hotel in Ekaterinburg, Russia.
