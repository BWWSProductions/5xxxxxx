,bobazonski,2011-04-17T08:32Z,"Thanks. Downloaded in just a couple days and I plan to seed to over 2.0 ratio.

Very clear video... only problem I had is it seems voices are much quieter than effects and music... I guess this isn't your fault but it's a huge difference; this could use some good loudness equalization. Voices are almost inaudible while I feel afraid the effects will disturb people sleeping across the house."
