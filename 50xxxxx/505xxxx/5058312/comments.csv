I'm just happy i can get all this stuff for free, and there are so many generous uploaders and seeders out there.  So shut the fuck up and go buy it if you cant wait a little while to download it."

,white-hot,2010-01-08T18:16Z,"Yeah, some folks like the brain dead Shade_Michael just don't have a clue. Hey dipshit! You're getting this for free, moron, so shut the fuck up and enjoy the fruits of someone elses labor. You think 3 days is bad you idiot, I downloaded the DVDR versions of a 7 year series, 48 DVD-DLs, and it took months but it was free so I was happy. Grow a brain and STFU.

Thanks for the up and for combining these for the rest of us! Nice work!"
