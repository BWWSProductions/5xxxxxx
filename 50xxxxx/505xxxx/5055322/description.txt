Aha Shake Heartbreak - Kings Of Leon [2004]
	
Aha Shake Heartbreak is the second studio album by American rock band Kings of Leon. It was released in November 2004 in the UK and February 2005 in the US.
The album was met with critical acclaim and was widely appreciated among Kings of Leon fans. Notable songs include "Milk", an acoustic track accentuating Caleb Followill's vocals, "King of the Rodeo", which high-lights the twin guitar playing, and the Latin-style coda to the opening track "Slow Night, So Long". When speaking about the album, the band remarked "if Youth and Young Manhood was the party, Aha Shake Heartbreak is the hangover."
"The Bucket", "Four Kicks" and "King of the Rodeo" were released as singles in the UK.
The original version of the album featured a white background and an orchid, the second featured a black cover with a different kind of orchid. The second also contained the bonus track "Where Nobody Knows", and on both albums the flower is positioned in a suggestively sexual position.
The title of the album comes from the third track, "Taper Jean Girl".
There is also a photo, hidden underneath the white plastic of the second black cover, of the band as children
The band's popularity exploded in Australia during the weeks of the 22nd and 29th of September, 2008, when they had all 4 of their studio albums in the top 50, with Aha Shake Heartbreak peaking at its highest position yet, number 25, and attaining Platinum sales. The album was certified 2x Platinum in Australia on the 12th of January, 2009. They have sold more than 910,000 copies worldwide.
