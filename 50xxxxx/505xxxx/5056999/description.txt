A tribute to one of my favorite TV shows. This contains some of the best clips from the shows that I have downloaded.

If you like the show you should love this. If you haven't ever seen it, you should check this out to see if it might be for you.

The video is nothing fancy and since most of the clips are from older shows, the quality isn't great. It's basically just clip after clip, about 40 clips in all, from about 10 different episodes.

Enjoy!

You can watch entire clips on my u toob channel here:

apparently TPB has blocked u toob links so just go there and my channel is /user/village1diot
