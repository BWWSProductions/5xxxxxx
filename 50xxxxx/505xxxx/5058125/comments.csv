,loopy89,2009-08-19T20:52Z,I downloaded it but how do i install it to my iphone? my phone is jailbroken
,biggda,2009-08-20T03:25Z,Does this only work on jailbroken iPhones? Thanks in advance!
,bav43,2009-08-20T05:17Z,"To those who have made this app work, how did you do it? 

I understand most of the steps but not 100%
1) Jailbreak the iphone- Easy
2) DL Hackulous, Installous, OpenSSH, and Appsync 3.0- Done
3) Unrar- the files... I do this and end up with just 1 file titled ""TomTom_US-Canada-v1.0-"" that is about 1.2gigs. Does not matter if I extract a single of the 13 files or all the files I get the same result used multiple programs for unrar-ing ... If I try and extract multiple files of the 13 to same destination at once they are all apparently consolidated to 1 file titled the same""TomTom_US-Canada-v1.0-"" and still the same 1.2 gigs... weird. "
,bav43,2009-08-20T05:21Z,"^^^ Contd
Ya I understand the rest of the steps using WinSCP and installing with installous, but end result is it doesnt install, so I am making a mistake. 

I am using a new 3g Iphone running FW 3.0.1 

Could it be I am running 3.0.1 and not everything is caught up?"
,instrance,2009-08-20T17:34Z,Anyone else getting Problem connecting to tracker type udp error?
,hafatash,2009-08-20T22:15Z,Does the iPhone need to be jailbroken to install this? 
,jahmed80,2009-08-23T14:33Z,"DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME GUYS, THIS SOFTWIRE IS MASSED UP. THE UPLOAD IS FINE. TOM TOM DID A VERY BAD JOB DESIGNING. I TRIED COUPLE OF ADDRESSES GAVE ME FUCKED ROUTE.

,frd420,2009-11-29T19:31Z,"two questions...

can it work on itouch and does it need to be jailbreaked? thanks"
,nix1016,2009-12-02T18:29Z,"No it doesn't work with iTouch as the iTouch does not have built in GPS and yes you need to JB your iphone.

A separate question, does anyone know if this will work with the TomTom car kit? Will it recognise that the software is installed?"
