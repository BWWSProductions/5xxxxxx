This mixtape was made to compare the two styles of two totally different artist that sound the same. Insult or Tribute showcases some of biggie's and Guerilla Black's classics and some never released freestyles. In my opinion the two can not be compared Biggie is hands down an artist that no one but Pac could be compared to lyrically.
This is my first torrent so please feel free to tell me if and where I screwed up. the criticism will be much appreciated. enjoy I will seed for a week.
