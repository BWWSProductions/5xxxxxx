At last it's here, the long awaited album from the swedish rockband WrongBay is  officially released and published.

And here we give it to you for free :>

The album was recorded in the spring of 2009 and this time we can hear some own-written songs and a new kickass cover of The white stripe's "Seven Nation Army".

Hope you enjoy the music and help with the seeding :)
