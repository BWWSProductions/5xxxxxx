,Makeswell,2010-03-09T06:40Z,"@enspasser I had to left-click the .001 file and then select WinRAR to extract, for some reason the context menu option didn't work like normal."
,i_c_c,2010-04-14T18:58Z,"@theone_nr  ""Only?""  700MB is enormous.  You sound like a modern paranoid bloatware whore..or someone who doesn't understand how installers work.  I'll bet you drive an American Hummer too."

I kept trying to mount it w/ power iso, but when I cliked on cd drive G: hoyle in my computer, It kept saying application not found. If this happens to anyone else just right click the mounted cd and  EXPLORE, then youll see the install app. "
