The french subtitles are very bad. I will send new french subtitles to the site Allsub for this release next week. I'm buzy with the last corrections (about 2 weeks work)."

When played the progress slider quickly skips through to about halfway (no audio or video) and then stops.
I haven't had any other problems with any other video. Anyone else?"
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2009-11-22T01:13Z,Disregard above... started working for no apparent reason. Great movie!
