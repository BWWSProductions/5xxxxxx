[V],McTav,2009-08-15T20:10Z,"hey man thanks for all your work, as far as a mpeg editor the other one i posted is much better then this, in the sense ill pass on this one. when it encodes as mpeg it just owns the quality.

basically im trying to rip a lot of my anime dvds and they way they are actually written on the dvd i need to edit the video, and i always rip the original mpeg2 and render that down for the best quality. and the Able mpeg Editor does it the fastest and with the best quality as it dosnt de-code the original file so its really nice. 

either way thanks again this DL does work great but not exactly what i was looking for, lemme know about the other program whenever you can ;P"
,SakuraBurma,2009-08-16T04:26Z,"Great job, it works, thanks man ."
,FQU,2009-08-17T00:07Z,"Thank you so much RobbingHood!
 I have been using version 4.1.1.109 of this editor for a long time now and have created all kinds of cool things with it.
 It looks like in this version that there are a lot of new transitions and title screens and text features like the ones in Cyberlink Powerdirector etc. I owe you big time for this! 
 Thank you again!"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-17T05:03Z,"@All of you: enjoy this. :)

@McTav 
Able MPEG2 Editor is nowhere to find, which usually means it's not worth the time of cracking.
To me it also looks like there must be something better. Let me know if you have another choice and request."
,Blitz187,2009-08-17T05:55Z,Thanks RH For Your Uploads... I've Been Grabbed Most Of Your Work... I Have A Favor To Ask Tho... Can You Get Me An Invitation On Demonoid?... I Really Would Love To Browse The Line Ups On There... Someone Please PM Me At Stoicblade@aim.com
[V],McTav,2009-08-17T07:36Z,"@RobbingHood

you would think so eh? :P

ive tried, ive lost count at how many programs. im not looking to edit and render the videos just cut parts out, and this by far does it the fastest with the best quality. anyways thanks for the effort!

i might just, *gulp* buy it =["

,ManixP,2009-09-03T15:01Z,"Thank you very much RH! Good job on this, perfectly working and 100% without virus ;-)

If I can make a request, I would ask for FixTunes software to be cracked! It's by far the best MP3 automatic tagging software that collects informations over the internet to find the most matching tags. However, the cracked version on the internet is a old one and it doesn't update anymore(update information, so it's useless) and I would love to have the new version(and I'm far from being the only one!).

However, I know that I'm asking a lot since it looks like a software mostly complicated to crack, I guess that it's mainly because of the internet used to make software to work.... Anyway, if you feel like taking a big challenge, take this one please ;-)

Thanks again!"

,dhvyse,2009-09-22T04:37Z,"@spy_vs_spy

I literally search google for hours looking for a solution, I suppose the program isn't used by many, because I can't find anything.   And what advanced tab?  The one to change resolution and FPS and all that?  Can't find it anywhere in there.  If you could just be totally fucking awesome right now and tell me how to do it exactly I would love you forever.  "
[V],RobbingHood,2009-09-26T01:23Z,"@dhvyse 

Besides installing the program did you do anything else, like reading the install notes?"
,dhvyse,2009-09-28T01:35Z,"@RobbingHood 

Obviously since I'm USING the program, I've read the install notes and have it working.

The problem I'm describing has nothing to do with how it was installed.  Get a clue."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-09-29T08:13Z,"@dhvyse 

Obviously you did not get the hint, which was: did you copy the crack file into the install directory of AVS? Go figure."
,dhvyse,2009-10-01T05:12Z,"@RobbingHood

I know there are a lot of idiots on here, I'm not one of them.  I know how to copy a crack into the install folder.  Yeah, I did."

1) Extract files
2) Install program 
3) copy the contents in the cracked folder to your hard drive in the respectable folders 
4) to get here go to ""start menu"" 
5) now click ""computer""
6) double click ur hard drive ""local disc (C:)""
7) now double click ""Program Files""
8) Look for ""AVS4YOU"" folder and double click
9) there will be a folder named: AVSVideoRecorder and AVSVideoEditor; copy and replace with the crack folder contents found in the downloads folder.
10) Voila!



I am running Windows Vista Home Premium with Norton Internet Security 2008 protecting my computer, some virus programs pick up cracks as a virus, but do not be alarmed, they will not damage your computer if your protection is active.  I don't know why some people have problems it's very simple.

Note for the apparently unwise: Of course cracks will be seen as malware, because technically they are. They alter software, which is the definition of malware."
,captainchao999,2010-02-23T00:58Z,"@RobbingHood
I'm very new to cracks and things like this. I don't usually do this. Truth is, I would buy a license, but I just had to throw together a video, and I had a deadline, and I didn't want their annoying watermark ruining my video. Anyways, I usually am suspicious on downloading things like this, but you seem very trustworthy. I'm putting on the crack tomorrow. If you can reply by then, could you answer me this? Do I have to uninstall my 4.2.1.167 before I put on the .166 crack? Can I put the crack on .167? Any instruction would be helpful, but I could find out myself if not (I may be a crack noob, but I'm not a computer noob).

[V],RobbingHood,2010-02-28T23:56Z,"@captainchao999 

Usually always uninstall a previous version before installing a new version. Cracks usually are version specific and won't work for another version."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-02-28T23:57Z,"Important note:
*************

Recently Kaspersky detects AVSVideoEditor.exe as Win32.Vilsel.okt (Trojan) and AVSVideoRecorder.exe as 
Win32.Vilsel.ofu (Trojan). Probably some signatures of a known virus are added to Kaspersky's virus definitions 
database which contain some of the same signatures used for the cracked files. However, the cracked files are 
100% clean, and the detection(s) by Kaspersky (and McAfee) are just false positives."
