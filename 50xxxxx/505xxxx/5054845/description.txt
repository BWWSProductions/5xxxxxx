The Debut album from Muse "Showbiz" was released on October 4th 1999 in the uk.The band had already gained a fan base in france,long before the uk public would hear of them.This is a brilliant album,and i saw them play most of these songs at T- in The Park,and it was an experience I'll never forget.Matthew bellemy is one of the most talented muscians around,and muse are now known all over the world.Hope you enjoy!!
