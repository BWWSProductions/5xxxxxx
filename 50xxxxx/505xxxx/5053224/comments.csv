Unfortunately it is a RARed file. Wich means people will download it, unrar it and delete the useless (for them) RAR files = no more seed.

It is always better to cater to lazyness and convenience rather than technical reasons.

RARs are nice in theory, but falls short when it meets human egoism and lazyness.

Unrared= You download it, immediatly watch it probably without bothering to remove it from your torrent program = you keep seeding.


Unrared files work with our bad sides rather than against them. People are lazy and egoistical so why not exploit those sides and seed unrared files?

If we all were technoidealists we would all have had laserdisks rather than VHS back in the days. But convenience won over quality. So learn from history and dont RAR stuff!"
,eevee,2009-08-15T00:16Z,"btw, what are the reasons for rared files?"
,FlyingCar,2009-08-15T01:02Z,"@eevee

Compression, in theory smaller file --> fast download"
[T],movieFOX,2009-08-15T02:06Z,The reason for rar is if you get a corrupt d/load you can d/load just that part file rather than whole file.

,toofan,2009-08-15T03:23Z,thanks
,Lightmanone,2009-08-15T04:10Z,will wait for unrared 1080p version. but still: good work AiTB ;)
,nspot,2009-08-15T05:29Z,"I thought the reason for RARing was for FAT32 drives, not for corrupt files. Doesn't a BT client's hash function suffice?"
,verbose2,2009-08-15T06:27Z,"Yes, files being distributed using bittorrent are already broken into chucks. Any good client will also compare already downloaded chunks with hash data provided in the .torrent file.

Hence, there is no reason to keep torrents rarred. So do us all a favor and UNRAR before you seed!!!"
,funkyDL,2009-08-15T12:28Z,"USAE WINRAR, EXTRACT THE FILES, WATCH THE MOVIE.

Who cares if the files are rars.? This is for free u stupid cunts. U dont like it, go spend some cash in the store."
,HHH973,2009-08-15T16:38Z,why is Highres - Movies always so bad seeded?? 
,vuzman,2009-08-15T18:51Z,"Rar-files are a fucking hassle. I download on a Networked Media Tank so I can play my downloaded videos directly on my HDTV. If I download a rar-file I have to copy it to my computer, un-rar it, then copy it back. Realize that more and more devices (NMTs, NASs, media players, etc) have built-in torrent clients and often support for films, but rarely, if ever, for rars."

,Metroidn1f,2009-08-16T00:57Z,"What program do you use to burn to a blu ray disk?  So like the samething as Blu ray disk quality.  What program do I use to produce Blu Ray Movies, you know like how you would make regualr DVD with DVD Flick.  I am not a noob, but I have never burned a Blu Ray disk before and I just want to know how."
,UKSalami,2009-08-16T01:02Z,"Lolz..

Content to wait for hours on end to DL the thing (top man, AiTB.  Good work), then complain about another 10 mins to unrar."

yup"
,ezquared,2009-08-16T19:10Z,"excuse my ignorance but im new to hi-res movie downloads.
What will i get when i unrar this?
1-just the movie 
2-the whole blue-ray image  "
,Firedog747,2009-08-17T03:28Z,"@ ezquared, you will get an .mkv file that you can either watch through your PC or you can convert it to DVD to play on a stand alone player. See post 4 up to see what software to convert with."
,Lexiconic,2009-08-18T00:10Z,"Oh, don't go on about egotists (that T definitely IS supposed to be there).
Everyone picks on egotists, and it's real easy in a place like this, but if you didn't want it for yourself, you probably wouldn't be downloading it. There is no motive other than a personal motive. There are only those who understand that they're selfish, and those who fight it and end up losing themselves in a collective BLAH.
Anyway, on to my real point for the comment. Don't put this on a DVD. If that's your plan, you're wasting time downloading a huge file for a tiny DVD where you'll lose the extra quality anyway, and the DVD rips will look better put on a DVD too, for that matter. Just keep it on the computer or burn it to blu-ray. If you don't understand media players, use VLC, and hope you have videocard decoding."
,ezquared,2009-08-18T09:22Z,"my question is if this is the whole blue-ray content with extras and other stuff or just the movie.

Im kind of confused by the diferent sizes of high ress movies, I see some of them are 4.5Gig uncompressed and other like this one are 4.4Gig rared.

Could someone explain the difference in these cause i dont wanna download something thats not really 720p.

Whats the right file size for a proper 720p blue ray movie?"
,ezquared,2009-08-18T09:25Z,BTW im not planning burn it to a DVD just watched on my PC wich has a prietty good graphics card
,Lexiconic,2009-08-19T01:26Z,"The file size depends on the length, bitrate, and several other things. This size is probably about average.
As to what's included, pretty much just the video. (as well as subtitles, maybe alternate audio, don't know. Just started unpacking.) The video file is a .mkv file, which is capable of containing multiple tracks for just about anything.
Don't worry about this not being the 720p movie, AiTB is not only a trusted uploader, AiTB is ""VIP"". (You can tell by the green skull, where the trusted people are pink, and other members have no skull.)"
,verbose2,2009-08-19T06:19Z,I trust none whom upload rars!
,agent1su,2009-08-30T23:55Z,"great job aitb, i would like to request for la confidential 720p please i love that movie to death"
,Horus Scorpion,2009-10-21T08:40Z,"Win32:Alureon-CO found in m-ox-720p.r90 with Avast!

I suggest no one downloads this"
,bendoveru,2010-05-08T04:17Z,"I very much disagree with people that dislike rar's..  It can save alot of time downloading and take strain off the initial seeder. However in the case of a mkv file.. there is no reason to do it, your looking at MAYBE 3% compression tops!! but i'm by no means complaining,, its fucking free! thx for the ul "
,inmartie,2011-03-16T17:57Z,"Good quality of movie, thank you!"
