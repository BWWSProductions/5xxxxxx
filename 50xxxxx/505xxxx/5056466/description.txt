In this edition of the railroad simulation series, game conductors can design rail systems using over 7,500 scenery objects and drive more than 150 types of locomotives over hundreds of miles of stunning 3D terrain. One of the most anticipated features of Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006 is Content Manager Plus, a new asset management utility that lets players easily access and organize files, download new content from the Download Station (which has over 50,000 assets), and even edit existing components. The Trainz tools and rules systems have been greatly improved to give players more flexibility than ever before in creating a personalized railroad adventure, and enhancements to the physics engine have significantly enhanced the driving experience.
