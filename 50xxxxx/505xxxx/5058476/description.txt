Ignivomous is a death metal band from Melbourne, Australia.

Formed in 2006, the band quickly issued a cassette version of the demo â€œPath of Attritionâ€, which quickly sold out. This led to them signing with cult US label Nuclear War Now! and re-issuing the demo on 12â€ vinyl with a bonus track (a cover of ancient Australian band Necrotomy).

2008 saw the release of the â€œEroded void of salvationâ€ 7â€, followed up by gigs throughout Australia. Later on during the year a split 7â€ with fellow Australians Tzun Tzu was issued as well. In 2009, the band released their first full length album, â€˜Death Transmutationâ€™, through Nuclear War Now! Productions.

Ignivomous exists to procreate dark Death Metal, nothing more, nothing less.
 
Born out of the various members desire to see a resurgence of a dissonant, heavy style of Death Metal devoid of influences from grind, slam, gore, etc, but leaning towards the claustrophobic style of such albums as "Onward to Golgotha", "Dawn of Possesion", "Ritual of Infinity", etc: a time when Death Metal had not sunk into self-parody, gore-obsessed retardation and cretinous gimmicks. A time when Death Metal meant DEATH. 

While the members of Ignivomous have for all played in other bands and projects ranging as far afield as Doom, Industrial/Neo-classical, Black-thrash and Grind, there has been a concious decicion to maintain a purity of focus and avoid genre cross-pollination.
