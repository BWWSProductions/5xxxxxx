What Is C?


C is a programming language. The C language was first developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs.
Ritchie called his newly developed language C simply because there was a B programming language already. (As a
matter of fact, the B language led to the development of C.)
C is a high-level programming language. In fact, C is one of the most popular general-purpose programming
languages.
In the computer world, the further a programming language is from the computer architecture, the higher the
language's level. You can imagine that the lowest-level languages are machine languages that computers understand
directly. The high-level programming languages, on the other hand, are closer to our human languages.
