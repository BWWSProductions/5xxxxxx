,cj1404,2010-03-27T22:52Z,"These are in .divx format and the quality is the same as a movie copied to a VHS tape in 6 hour mode.  Very low quality.  

The sound only comes from the left speaker and is not very good but you can hear what is going on.

If you never say the second season it is better than nothing. 

I could not find this done in .avi format of greater quality.
You get what you didn't pay for.

Video=3
Audio=4"
