,casagemas,2009-08-16T16:55Z,how about seeding?
,COLBERTNOTION,2009-08-16T17:41Z,I'm more than happy to seed otherwise I wouldn't have posted it but I'm not going to do it alone.  Initial seeding session was five hours...I'll go for a few more.  If others are not going to start helping keep this torrent alive why should I waste my time?

I watched & recorded this back in the 80s on my 10KG VCR (yes, they were massive!) but that tape has been lost to the destruction of time, but this is a wonderful insight to the making of the trilogy & a must for any die hard (pre prequel!) fan. Agree with the Uploader when he says ""before Lucas went insane and began destroying both his masterpiece and my childhood"". Too true!!!! 
Now picture this: Jules & Vincent in Pulp Fiction with Jar Jar Binks in the back seat!!! ""Aww Shit! I just shot Jar Jar in the face""!!!!!!"
