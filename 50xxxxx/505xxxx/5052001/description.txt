''BARRAVENTO'' (''The Turning Wind''), opening today at the Public Theater, is the first feature by the highly regarded Brazilian director Glauber Rocha, who died at the age of 42 in 1981. The film, made in 1961, is about the efforts of Firmino, part revolutionary, part devil, to free the fishermen in his native Bahian village from capitalist exploitation and the religious superstition that prevents social 
change.

''Barravento'' is an exceptionally beautiful work, shot in the dramatically filtered, black-and-white photography associated with Eisenstein's ''Que Viva Mexico!'' and Flaherty's ''Moana.'' In its use of dance and song within - and as comment on - the narrative, it parallels a number of films by Rocha's associates in Brazil's CinemaMNovo movement. Even the fights are choreographed as if they were ballets.

It's also a far more tidy, far less flamboyant work than Rocha's later films, including ''Antonio das Mortes'' (1968). These are so lavish in their use of legend, left-wing politics and obscure mysticism that they tend to be more popular at film festivals than with ordinary audiences.

There's nothing obscure about ''Barravento.'' It's poetic but also completely straightforward in its revolutionary concerns. Antonio Sampaio cuts a striking, sinuous figure as the comparatively sophisticated Firmino, who moves through the film as if he were a politically committed Sportin' Life. Nelson Pereira dos Santos, another notable Cinema Novo director (''Vidas Secas,'' ''Amulet of Ogum''), acted as film editor for Rocha on ''Barravento.''
