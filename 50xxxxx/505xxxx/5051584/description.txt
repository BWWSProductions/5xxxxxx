Thomas Sowell - The Housing Boom and Bust

Unabridged Audio Book


While Sowell is clearly brilliant, he is also able to effectively communicate the whole story of the boom and bust in an interesting manner that is still rooted in his perspective as an economist.

Read this and you will better understand what lead directly to the attempt to make us into a Marxist nation that we are facing today.




This is a plain-English explanation of how we got into the current economic disaster that developed out of the economics and politics of the housing boom and bust. The "creative" financing of home mortgages and the even more "creative" marketing of financial securities based on American mortgages to countries around the world, are part of the story of how a financial house of cards was built up-and then suddenly collapsed.

The politics behind all this is another story full of strange twists. No punches are pulled when discussing politicians of either party, the financial dangers they created, or the distractions they created later to escape their own responsibility for what happened when the financial house of cards in the financial markets collapsed.

What to do, now that we are in the midst of an economic disaster, is yet another story-one whose ending we do not yet know, but one whose outlines and implications are explored to reveal some surprising and sobering lessons.
