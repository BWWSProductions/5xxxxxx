,elax666,2009-09-21T23:22Z,"Well, duh!?! I think most people know that eztv is not one person, (singular), but take me 4 an example, I like 2 give thanks 2 an imaginary person rather than a group. In that way they could all take credit as one. :P So, thanks eztv, your the best! And 4 all those in doubt about eztv being a person or a group check out eztv.it."
