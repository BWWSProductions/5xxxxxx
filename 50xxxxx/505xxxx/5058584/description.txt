Hi to you all!    

    Here are some great quality portraits for your favourite good old games. There's really no need for instructions, but here you are:

    The easiest way to accesss the portraits is to open the "index.html", then choose a category and the person you want to see as yourself (or you find pretty).

    The following window will show you tree zip files, one version for each game of the selected star. 
    For example, for Angelina Jolie in Icewind Dale, choose "jolie_iwd", and so on. You need to unzip these files to the specified folder in the install directory by each game, they may have different names.

    After that: launch the game, and you will see the portraits among the others when creating a character.

    It's now ready and should work.
    If you have any problems, write, and we will try to find a solution.

                         Thanks for downloading and seeding!
