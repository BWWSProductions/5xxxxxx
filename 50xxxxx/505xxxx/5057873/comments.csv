,dsteinmetz,2009-10-26T04:16Z,"After extracting with 7z and launching AlienShooter.exe, error message appears: ""Unable to Locate Component. This application failed to start because d3dx9_27.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."" Same message appeared after extracting and launching again. I am running XP SP3 and meet hardware requirements described in Readme.txt. Any suggestions? "
