,piratebay-vpn-user,2009-08-28T09:12Z,Thanks! Just found out that it does not work on mine but its becasue I need the AUDI MMI version - thats a different one. But will keep on seeding this now for quite a while.

,Watsinator,2009-09-17T22:14Z,My handbook says I need the RNS-E but when I switch on the Sat Nav it comes up MMI (dont know if they are all the same). I hav downloaded this and all it did was update the software but when that was finished 10 mins later it asked me to insert the Navigation DVD. How do I get this to work?? Its a 2003 Audi A3
