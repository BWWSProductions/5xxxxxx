,Leechless,2011-02-26T01:52Z,"PS Tray Factory is a software that can minimize your applications to the System Tray.
This torrent comes with the install file, the patch (crack), and instructions, but it's pretty self explanatory.
Totally epic, definitely did what I needed it to do."

,jadawgkss,2012-04-06T21:53Z,"Just wanted to let people know that this works for version 3.2 as well. Just kill PSTrayFactory.exe from the taskmanager, copy/paste the patch in, and the next time you restart you are listed as registered."
