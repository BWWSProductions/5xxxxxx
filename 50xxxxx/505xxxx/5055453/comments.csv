i have core 2 duo 2.66 Ghz intel processor,2 GB RAM,1 GB geforce 9400 graphic card,free space in installation directory of 10 GB.

1.i downloaded the game.
2.extracted the iso image using magic iso.
3.i double click on install.exe .
4.the install wizard starts the installation process.
but after 3 seconds,this appears up out of the blue:

1628:failed to complete installation.
