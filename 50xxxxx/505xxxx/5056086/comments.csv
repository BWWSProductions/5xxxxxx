Its not possible to explain to a blind person the difference between  R5DVDRIP and DVDRIP 
if you can not see the title posted R5 DVDRIP.

To refresh your mind for example R5DVDRIP it means the DVD picture from non english DVD and audio from english DVD Screener.
thank you for waisting my time.  "

Thank you for your screenshot but it is the wrong screenshot, DUQa put 2 black strip lines to cover the non english substitle, so you must got the wrong screenshot from another source.
thanks you for waisting my time."

,LordOrwell,2009-10-23T18:01Z,"only thing wrong with ""use nero's player"" is it's bloatware and the nero suite fills your system full of BS.  Media player plays this just fine with the proper codec.  Nero on the other hand comes with it's own codecs (and you can't change them)  If you really want to recommend a decent alternative to media player, recommend VideoLan."
