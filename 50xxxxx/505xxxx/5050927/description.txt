Absolutely immense DVD package from acclaimed Berlin design house Pfadfinderei, 
the people responsible for Bpitch Controlâ€™s graphic design and, in particular, 
working closely with the unstoppable Modeselektor. â€˜Lablandâ€™ features over an 
hour of completely exclusive music from Modeselektor - a visual music album 
pioneering a tight combination of music, film & graphic design in mindboggling 
ways. The emphasis here, of course, is on tight edits â€“ both in terms of visual 
and audio editing, squashed rhythms, bass, shapes & colours, inventing a new 
kind of synchronicity. Pfadfinderei distort, twist and warp space in response to 
Modeselektorâ€™s mashed-up samples and low-end heavy backdrops, an absolutely 
deadly mix. Easily the best DVD weâ€™ve seen of its kind â€“ for all intents and 
purposes a brand new Modeselektor album given an extra dimension or two, all 
recorded in beautifully crisp 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound. A massive 
recommendation!!!!
