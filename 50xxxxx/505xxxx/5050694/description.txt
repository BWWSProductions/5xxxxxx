Are you Jewish? So what does it mean to be Jewish? These are questions posed in a film, Gentleman's Agreement, starring Gregory Peck (who was not Jewish, neither in the film or real life) and they are the basis of Jamie Kastner's entertaining enquiry into the nature of contemporary Jewishness.

Kastner was born and educated in one of the few places in the world where it doesn't matter if you are Jewish or not - a plush suburb of Toronto. In the provocatively-titled Kike Like Me, Kastner treks around Israel and Europe investigating contemporary attitudes to Jewishness. He also goes to Washington where he meets the redoubtable Patrick Buchanan.

Kastner's take is that if you are Jewish - and he leaves it to the viewers to deduce whether he is or not - this will dominate your life, whether you like it or not. But for Kastner, Jewishness doesn't appear to be a burden - at least when you consider the utter stupidity of many of the anti-Semites he meets
