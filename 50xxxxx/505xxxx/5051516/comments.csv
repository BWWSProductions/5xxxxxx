Indie fans will be thankful to you!!!"
,fanciz,2009-09-18T16:56Z,"which album do U want?
Btw, U will have to click several times on the link I provided above. It seems that gmail wants viewers to become members but they give up after a few clicks and the page then opens."
,teddydiaz,2009-10-25T12:49Z,"hey fanciz, i have a feeling we're kababayans.

anyways, i love your collection.  and i was wondering if you could post the following (if you have time that is).  i've been looking for these albums for a long long looooooooong time.
1.  colourfields - deception
2.  noiseworks - rouch
3.  sheila and the insects
4.  the best of the silencers
5.  WXB - best of the 80s (dear lord, i hope this is good).
6.  any compilation with I-Level's - our song

i'm not sure which modern english album carries the newer songs (eg. the border), but would appreciate your posting this just the same.

cheers"
