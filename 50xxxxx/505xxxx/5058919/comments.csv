,zcold,2009-08-18T05:46Z,"actually, if you look at all the uploads, they only include the program, this is the actual disc, with crack. The Suite, whole shabang. Discs 3-4 to follow, I only have so much upstream ;)
200-300meg, vs 1gig."
,zcold,2009-08-18T05:47Z,"also, not sure, but im sure you can use the latest 7 version program with the other discs, just install everything and then update your program to like 7.0.whatever it is now.. Be nice to have 8.."

,abrampanhead,2010-03-15T07:35Z,"I've been having some issues with this. I just installed this on my powerbook G4, running OS 10.4.11, 2gigs of ram, 80 gig HD. Now, the program and all the packs are installed and working fine and it even opens my old files perfectly but after working in the program for about 2-7 minutes it'll freeze up. I know that the other torrent of Live! 7 that I attempted to work was also a dynamic hack and it was prone to crashing so I had to resort back to my older version. But that one would completely shut down with out warning, this one just freezes up and I can't do anything. can anyone help me out?"
