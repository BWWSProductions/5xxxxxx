A musical documentary and tribute about "choro", an older style of playing that forms the foundation of all Brazilian composition, including samba and bossa nova. Original audio in Portuguese. English Hard Subs.

My opinion abou this documentary:
Before seeing this film I didn't even know that choro music existed and I was surprised how much I enjoyed hearing and seeing this film. Few of the guitarist were simply amazing!

This movie showed to me how relaxed the Brazilian people are and how much they love their music. The scene in theater where the whole audience was singing (with Yamandu), that really was a chilling scene, in a highly positive way! Also it was interesting to hear the viewpoint from the older musicians as well as the younger generation.

That Yamandu guy is a brilliant brilliant guitarist. I didn't even know this kind of guy existed previously. You should really see this film and his guitar work, it's amazing.

I can really recommend this film if you like Brazilian way of life and their music.
