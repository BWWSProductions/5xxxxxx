,Lucentio,2009-08-14T12:40Z,wah wah wah shutup and be thankful or go record it your damn self
,Wuffy,2009-08-14T12:46Z,"Splitting files with zips like that is something we did back in the day when internet was crappy and unreliable and download anything over 3 megs was near impossible.

The fact is torrented already breaks the damn file up into pieces for you.

There's no damn point."
,Lucentio,2009-08-14T13:50Z,"I know and I agree. It's just the way the scene works. Just like 700mb (size of CD - who cares?) DVDrips or 2x700mb files for 1 DVDrip. I too wish that they'd change the rules, but until they do I'll continue to unrar archives with one right click and use VirtualDub to combine files. I appreciate everything the scene does, even if I'm not really the intended consumer of their releases. props! "
,Wuffy,2009-08-14T13:55Z,"Thanks enough to reply.
It's nice when I do find the single solid files quite a few torrents have.

And believe me I am VERY greatful for the torrents, I just had a moment of frustration waiting for this one to come out only to find a Multi rar.
If It wasn't for these great sites and communities I wouldn't be able to see any of these shows since they don't broadcast out my way."
,ikoni,2009-08-14T13:55Z,"I think the hole point is to be able to share these files in places like rapid_share etc.

Thx for torrent."
,Minerva7101,2009-08-14T15:17Z,"I agree with Wuffy, stop with the stupid rar-files."
,Peatythedog,2009-08-15T04:40Z,"Thanks, I'm not worried about rar, I know the source is credible.  "
,Bshroom,2009-09-21T17:42Z,"RARed files makes for less seeds.

When people are done downloading they unpack the movie file and delete the now useless RAR files. And since the RARs are gone the torrent client cannot seed anymore.


If it werent RARed then people would just watch it right away when finished DLing and leave it seeding out of pure lazyness. Wich is a good thing.


And that reason exceedes any technical reason for RARing files."
,Bshroom,2009-09-21T17:44Z,Pen and Teller ought to make a Bullshit episode about RAR files. ;-)
