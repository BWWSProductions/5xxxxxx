The album has received generally positive reviews and has appeared in numerous Top-10 lists for "Album of the Year. 
The album became the band's first number one album in the Republic of Ireland and United Kingdom. 

NME announced the band were working on a new album in March 2006. Lead singer Caleb Followill said, "These songs are so much bigger, this band is so much better. There was a growth that people thought they heard on Aha Shake Heartbreak from Youth & Young Manhood, but there's no comparison this time out. I think it's pretty evident when people hear it." The title refers to a large UPC ministers conference held in Alexandria, Louisiana that the brothers attended often.  Moreover, lead singer Caleb Followill has said the title comes from the saying that "if an album does well it's 'because of the times' or if it bombs, it's 'because of the times'."

The album debuted at number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 42,000 copies in its first week. As of the 20th of December 2007, the album has sold over 362,000 copies in the UK.
