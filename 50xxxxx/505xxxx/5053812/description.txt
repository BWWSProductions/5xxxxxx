The founder and leader of Zap Mama is Marie Daulne. She was born in Congo and grew up in Belgia. Her Mission is to make a brigde between African and European cultures through her music.

THe music is a mixture of African and Western music where some songs are pure hip hop, some are clearly ispired by R&B and in some songs they use African Instruments. 

The lady appears very warm hearted, and she has a special talent of finding band members with strong personalities. They clearly have a lot of fun on the stage and love both their music and their audience. When Zap Mama is on the stage, she is the goddess of music and she will make you laugh and  dance and give you an experience you will never forget.
