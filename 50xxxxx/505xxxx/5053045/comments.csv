[V],rambam1776,2009-12-10T08:35Z,"This is fantastic! People in the forums at various UK sites are always telling Yanks to watch this, but it can be a ratio killer on private trackers. DL here saves me from THAT nonsense. You have my deep thanks."
,kneebutt,2009-12-19T01:39Z,Thanks from Australia man!  Love this show.
,argh523,2009-12-29T08:56Z,"Thanks man! 

Saw that show years ago, loved it, but lost it, couldn't find it for a while, slowly forgot about it.. Now, out of nowhere, i remembered, seconds later I'm here.. all hail my weird brain and your torrent!"
,Faikus,2010-01-03T01:55Z,"Thanks, lost 1 gig of data a few days ago. this was part of it."
,synchro_w,2010-03-05T20:24Z,"y'see.. this is why brit comedy is BETTER than US comedy. we have surreality and strange quirky behaviour in such  an astoundingly bizarre way that william burroughs must be so sad that amerixca has bhcome so wank when it comes to modrn comedic culture.[i know, burroughs was never a comdey writer but still...] 
i mean.. 'friends'? [vomit], 'sex in the shitty'? [puke] and so many other awful 'comedy' 'shows""?""'"

,option_30,2010-05-13T23:21Z,You even put in extras for each season! big thankyou! I just returned from Ireland and found out about the show there. I introduced Trailer Park Boys to the Irish though. Good trade off
,newmouse,2010-06-02T05:40Z,The only USA Sit-Com that comes close is Big Bang Theory .....But then again we must never forget Cheers @@@@

,harigata,2011-11-02T16:22Z,"I've watched 8 minutes of this show, felt like an hour. The horror, the horror..... at least Benny Hill had good looking chicks in bikinis to go with his lame ass humor. And Hill's humor war far superior to that of this show....  I find it very hard to describe just how crappy this show is. People with brains, be warned."
,FatAdZ,2011-12-06T11:28Z,"@Harigata

I often hear Black Books described as 'intelligent comedy', so you'll probably need a brain to enjoy it.

Good quality rip, thanks for the upload!"
,sazworks,2012-01-21T14:37Z,OMG! thanks for this! been looking for it for ages after I lost mine!! thanks!!
,tekkichan,2012-03-23T15:24Z,thank you soo much for this 
,SkeebleDouble,2012-04-28T08:13Z,"im from the u.s. and i have recently seen this show for the first time, i watched the first season in one sitting (thanks to HULU). I also watched all seasons of Peep Show in 2 weeks! I like our american style of comedy quite a bit also. UK style of comedy might be alittle too much on the nose for some americans and maybe too slapsticky. Its too bad that you can only see these shows on hulu or piratebay around here, but atleast we get Dr.Who wich is awesome. goodluck all"
