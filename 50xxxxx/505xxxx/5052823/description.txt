Today, English composer William Byrd (1540-1623) is mostly remembered for his vocal works, but his keyboard output--a vast array of pavans, galliards, plainsong interpretations, preludes, and popular-song arrangements--is just as noteworthy. Indeed, as Byrd sought to find his voice in writing music for the (relatively) new instrumental genre, he employed experimentation, creativity, and virtuosity that still sound fresh today. This ambitious set features virtually all Byrd's keyboard music, performed by Davitt Maroney on a handful of replica instruments. Spread over seven CDs (and with a solid 100 pages of liner notes dissecting the works), it's an impressive set for keyboard buffs and people curious about what music in Elizabethan England sounded like. Throughout, Maroney plays these challenging pieces impeccably, whether on harpsichord, church organ, clavichord, or muselar virginal (a type of plucked keyboard instrument). Sometimes musical labors of love don't translate to good listening, but in the case of William Byrd: The Complete Keyboard Music, we should all be thankful for Maroney's efforts. --Jason Verlinde 



NOTE: I originally got this collection from Mininova. However, when I tried to download the 7th CD, the torrent suddenly ceased to work as there wasn't a single seeder for a certain period of time. I got most of it, including 6 of the CDs and the booklet, but the only thing missing was CD7. Lucky for me that I found CD7 on eMule. And now this amazing collection is back! Make sure to seed this torrent after you're done!
