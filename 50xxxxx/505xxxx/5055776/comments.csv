[V],McTav,2009-08-18T00:11Z,"also as a heads up, since this is the last of the southparks out on dvd atm the next show i will be uploading is 30 Rock, which if you havnt seen it is probably the best show on tv right now!

expect it near the end of the month

only 2 seasons out right now 3rd is out next month"
,infuriated_rain,2009-10-08T20:00Z,"excellent quality, thanks!"
,Sumsonfire,2009-10-14T12:18Z,hi Mctav i greatly appreciate the work u do but i was wondering if it is possible for you to create torrents of all south parks in compressed rar format because they are alot easier to download and they are quicker and for someone like me whos internet isnt very fast it would make a real difference thank you for all your work
,nty1907fb,2009-11-24T21:54Z,thanks man!!
,reeceyboy,2010-01-01T06:16Z,Good Upload but a little bit slow :(
,lingpanda01,2010-01-13T06:19Z,Anybody know where to get subtitles for these McTav rips?
,reeceyboy,2010-01-13T15:52Z,Please seed :)
,Texmo,2010-03-10T23:10Z,"McTav is to TV Shows, what Axxo, FXM, FXG are to movies! Brilliant! Keep up the GREAT work!!! Thanks for all your time!"
,X1NE,2010-03-17T01:16Z,McTav what avi player did u use? coz i tried it with win media player 12 and it says 'The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.' can anybody help????
,Realeyes,2010-04-08T00:57Z,"A ""warning"" to those trying to download McTav's southpark stuff. The later seasons, I believe 10 and up, are in fact dvd-rips. The earlier ones down to the first season are just TV rips, censored. 
The titles should be changed to TVrips, since a DVDrip implies that the mentioned video comes from a manufactured DVD, not a home burned one. That would be a TV/Xvid rip. You can't record TV on a DVD and call it a DVD-rip. The earlier ones actually have the ""comedy central"" stuff on it. 
Don't get me wrong, McTav, I love your shit, and I am thankful for what you throw out, but I just got my hopes up for the uncensored DVDs.
Avast ye, Mateys! Arrrgghh!"
,ABuSD,2010-06-08T13:14Z,"@ Realeyes: The 1st 3 seasons are the first mcTav files ive D/L'ed and they are definately NOT TVRip, they are superb quality.
If its a censorship thing Ive heard alot of older shows are still censored with their DVDRips :(

Thanks McTav!!"
,Lorddeth,2010-08-19T11:33Z,As always your royal work is like sooo sweet. 
,SatansRancidButthole,2010-08-30T16:37Z,"Thank you so much! I have always wanted my SP dvds on my computer because it makes the 190+ eps easier to jump randomly than the DVDs. The quality is amazing and the size is surprisingly small.

and @X1NE I usually use VLC but I hear DivX works too"
,SatansRancidButthole,2010-08-30T16:45Z,"and @Realeyes The first uncensored DVD is 11. However, there is a torrent containing season 9 and 10 uncensored, and in HD. I do not know how they got a hold of the HD uncensored eps but its legit."
,LittleXel,2010-09-04T01:47Z,IDK much bout companies tracking torrents but i just received a letter from my internet provider stating that I downloaded this torrent and if I don't delete it off my computer and show proof (blah blah blah) than I am getting sued for copyright infringement. Just a heads up to all you fellow pirates! LONG LIVE TPB!!!!!!!! 
,thrasher610,2010-10-08T05:53Z,hey dude just wanted to say thanks so much for the quality and trustworthy uploads. these sights need more people like you
,Blink182FanNo1,2010-10-11T16:56Z,thx mctav .. u  r the best :) excelent quality videos.... 10/10 a n v
,ilovemycomputer,2010-10-13T22:29Z,"BEWARE: This may or may not be mctav's fault, but warning everybody for future references!!! 
THE TRACKER ""http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce"" has been found in multiple southpark seasons from MCTav and upon research on google, the second result I found from this was
""denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969 is operated by MediaDefender and this blog is a ploy to trick people into using the tracker"". That said, that mediadefender is the one running this tracker, make sure you delete it before you do ANY sharing. Praise mctav for hosting these, but warning your fans!"
,ilovemycomputer,2010-10-14T00:18Z,"By the way the blog I was talking about in my previous comments on mctav's other torrents was: 
http://opentracker.blog.h3q.com/
This is a fake site, and even advises to using the tracker, which is operated by MediaDefender to track if you upload any of the torrents it's in, so they can nail you for it. Thats why you've gotten that stupid notice to cease and desist asap."
,snorronl1,2010-12-09T19:51Z,"ey guys thnx for the seeds, but a question is there a season 14 of South Park?:P"
