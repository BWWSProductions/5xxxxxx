It's about a group of American athletes competing in Eastern Europe and they're supposed to get on a train to continue the competition. And our group of people miss the train 'cause they went partying the night before. They get on a different train to catch up with their teammates and horror ensues. I researched real crimes that happen here in Eastern Europe and based it on that. The way I describe this is as an intelligent horror film. It's got gore and it's got the stuff that makes it a horror movie, but it's also go a clever story people will enjoy.
