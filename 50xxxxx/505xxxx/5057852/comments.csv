Are my uploads good enough. Do i need to improve a little{leave the encoding to me}. Just suggest me regarding the video and audio. Do you all like the idea of having 5.1 audio. I have also increased the bitrate of audio when compared to my previous releases.
Do you want me up the bitrate of video aswell .
Have any one compared my releases with any dvdrips. 
How do you like the idea of styled subs which i have provided. 
Im a great fan of .mkv container. And all my future releases will be in that format only.
Im also considering providing integrated subtitles with out the need of that extra subtitle file. That could be great becoz there is no chance of loosing the subtitles as long as you have the movie file in .mkv container.

Have any one tried my previous releases. ""The House OF Flyingdaggers"" - known for exceptional surround sound and also for beautifully vivid video. Dont worry of the language coz i enjoyed it more with the original audio than the dubbed english{which i found in a dvdrip with 2ch mp3}
Also check ""Sword Of The Stranger"" which is my favorite movie. Check the reviews on imdb.

Thanx for the comment. As far as seeding is concerned My speed is actually limited. But when im seeding i will stop all other torrents. The real problem is majority of the people are not willing to actually share the love. 
If i got the same craze like axxo{legend} then this wont be a problem. More downloads will make the torrent alive for more time period.
Friends do seed.seed.seed.seed.&.seed"
