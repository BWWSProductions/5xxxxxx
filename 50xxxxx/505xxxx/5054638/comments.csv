thanks!"
,virgilaug,2009-08-15T15:21Z,"Anyone install these in windows. Do these include enhancements for windows xp, or just support for windows 7."
,ssn637,2009-08-15T15:26Z,"These drivers are compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7...as indicated in the torrent description.  I installed them last night in a Windows 7 RTM Ultimate Boot Camp partition and they worked just fine.  I'd recommend updating the NVidia graphics drivers, however, with the latest version available at their web site.  The RealTek Audio driver can also be updated manually using the latest available (V2.30)."
,lazerbeak83,2009-08-17T23:57Z,"WOW

these drivers are awsome
the included nvidia drivers are awsome as well

ive had bootcamp 2.1 with xp sp3 and I have
Macbookpro 2.2 ghz 8600m gt 128 ddr3 ram

just installed windows 7 over xp sp3 and installed 2.1 after that
and graphics fps was poor...so i downloaded newest nvidia win 7 drivers from laptopvideo2g0
and still poor

so I d/l bootcamp 3.0 installed over 2.1 in win 7
just extracted the iso with winrar
ran setup.exe
it uninstalled 2.1 and installed 3.0

but it said a few drivers didnt work

so i ran bootcamp 3.0 agin after restart and clicked repair option then restarted again(i suggest run this twice if you already have bootcamp 2.1 installed)

now it runs as smooth as ive ever had my macbookpro running graphics fps most ever had and and audio in windows at least ...barley use osx unless im audio engineering or mobileing it

^not shure wat dude above was talking bout but nvidia drivers in this 3.0 are big improvement also i think these 3.0 drivers also update intel chip or something for win 7 and nvidia

anyways

1 word for these drivers ==>  PWNT

can't wait till i get snow leopard and do a full bootcamp 3.0 install from leopard then win 7 but for now = Rock solid

snow leopard and win 7 = Epic win

just thought id post this cause finally running like it should :)

,thecolorabove,2009-10-01T06:52Z,"HELP!!!

Anyone else having this problem installing Windows 7 via bootcamp 3.0?

Upon windows setup I go to choose a partition, and of course since Mac doesn't deal w/ NTFS, and win. 7 can't install on a FAT file system, I have no compatible partition to install it on.

Google has provided me with MacFuse + NTFS-3G. These would be awesome if they worked with SNOW LEOPARD. Disk Utitlity won't allow that formatting option in 10.6.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. "

,R0B0T1C,2009-12-26T12:27Z,"Boot Camp Windows 7 x64 on Macbook Problem Installing Drivers 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello. I have installed Windows 7 on my early 2009 Macbook via boot camp. The windows OS is 64 bit. I am having trouble installing the drivers. From what I read on the internet, to install drivers, I must insert the Leopard Install Disk, and follow the instructions to install drivers. However, when I insert the disk, first, W7 asks me permission to allow the program to run, so I say Allow. Then an error comes up, saying that the 64bit is not compatible with this model computer. What do I do? Is there any other way to install the boot camp drivers? "
,rcguy,2009-12-28T18:18Z,Thank you! My new macbookpro was not recognizing my OSX disks so I could not install the bootcamp drivers. Your disk did the trick. Everything now great here running Windows XP SP3 connecting over wireless network.

Djandyw ripped and upped the Boot Camp folder from a 2011 iMac install DVD. It is the all-in-one v.3.1 build 2551 (= 3.0 base + 3.1 update integrated) compiled Oct. 2010 which Apple does NOT supply as download.

  â€¢ for XP/Vista/7, 32 and 64bit
  â€¢ created to work on any Boot Camp 3.0 compatible Intel-based Mac
  â€¢ contains all Nvidia and ATI GPU drivers as of Sep. 2010

Decompress with 7zip, WinRar etc. (780MB).

After reboot, run 'Apple Software Update' and install any Boot Camp update(s). Alternatively you can check at http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp"
,BLZD1,2011-06-29T11:32Z,"There seems to be a lot of confusion due to people not doing any research and saying the first thing that pops into their head...

These are DRIVERS for WINDOWS already installed using bootcamp on a mac.

I am currently downloading them and will post back as soon as i've tried them out :) 

as for those who have no idea what they're even doing on this very page here's how to go about using this torrent...

(given that you do not have the original snow leopard disc that came with your mac or for whatever reason are unable to use the disc)


start bootcamp.app 

make a partition that will be used for your windows installation

when prompted click 'i already downloaded the support software or have the original discs' (not exactly what it says but u catch my drift ;D)

insert your windows installation disc and proceed to install

(this is only for those who say 'how can i use the partition if win7 needs nfat')

when u choose the bootcamp partition to install win click advanced or whatever and click on 'format'... you should now be able to proceed installation :)


once it's all done... you may THEN download this torrent from ur windows installation :)

cheers"
