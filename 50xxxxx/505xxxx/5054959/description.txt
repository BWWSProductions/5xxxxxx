The is the 5th disc of a 6 disc limited edition set. I have scanned the cover which is the same for

front and back of the box and this is contained in the first disc torrent. I have omitted the 80 page

book that is included with the set because it would take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad

enough then buy the box set. This set is a combination of the soundtrack and follow up album with the

exception Ten Years After.

Pease note that some of these tracks were unissued and some are complete versions that were unissued.

If you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.

Please help seed these torrents. Enjoy.
