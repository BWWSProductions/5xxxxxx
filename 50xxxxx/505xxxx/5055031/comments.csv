When I restart the game, I can't hear anybody, not even Itsuki or the King of Devils in the beginning."
,CEDR777,2009-12-01T12:15Z,SUCCESS! thank you!
,kevinhermosa,2010-03-20T23:45Z,"THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THE GAME IS 100% WORKING!

I rate this torrent 5 star.

I also recommend all people who wants to play Shuffle! to download this torrent because it is WORTH THE WAIT!

If you are having problems regarding the sound, probably your data04000.arc is damaged.

The data04000.arc is the main file used to produce the voice of the characters and many other things.

All arcs must be 100% working for the game to work 100%.

But the most important arcs are the data04000.arc and data02000.arc"
