And anyway, printing these 9 pdfs would cost you more than just buying the paper books so there is really no point downloading them..."

,theguguy,2009-08-22T18:13Z,"Secret_Smile-> Well, you must be a masochist to read these nine books on a crt or lcd screen."

,mieveditz,2010-02-08T22:43Z,"Who tell you we want to print it guguy? Printing it's a waste of time, money and detroying our environnement. 

But, PDF format is good if I want to read it on my Ipod. I don't know if I can put epub, mobi, lrf on it, but I know that I can't with the .Lit so I have to convert it.. so... if I can have it directly in PDF I'm please!!! So Thank You MISH!  "
,clublavelapc,2010-03-02T04:13Z,"Thank you SO much! This works GREAT on my reader.
