Try the Fluctuation meditation.
Play any Osho discourse using the VLC or other player
and play Osho music at the same time using the Winamp player,
playing a song list.

Set volume for music much quieter than for discourse.
Discourse voice level should overshadow the volume of music when voice gets loud.

What happens is your consciousness is going to fluctuate between hearing a discourse and music
and pretty soon you will be able to see how your mind flickers.

Plus, when you listen to discourses with quiet music background,
it is much harder to get totally distracted by the mind trips
because music in the background brings your attention to it.

Just don't play any aggressive or complicated music. Ethnic music works also.

To play .mp4 videos use VLC player.

He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his 'teachings' are the same - dangerous and insane."
