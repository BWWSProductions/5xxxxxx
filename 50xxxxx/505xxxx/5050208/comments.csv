,demlokiseinfan,2009-08-13T21:07Z,Thank you for all the great comics you upload here. But: have you cancelled scanlating the Valhalla comics or can we expect further scanlations soon?
[T],data9724,2009-08-13T22:17Z,"They are coming, but it takes time. #7 is in retexting at the moment, so are The Snow Queen and Inspector Canardo 4 :)
And will go on scanning Valhalla 8 and so on as soon as i get #7 back."
