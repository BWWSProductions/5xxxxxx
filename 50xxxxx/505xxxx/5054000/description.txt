REPOST. Creator: CL8 / Demonoid. demonoid.[com]/users/CL8
When I ripped book 1 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4930444 there were good seeds for the other books out there. 
Now there seem to be none seeded on TPB or Mini.
Here is a torrent by CL8 that's complete and well seeded (at the moment).
Original description below. Cheers, FerraBit

-------------Complete Jean M. Auel Audio Collection-------------

The Earth's Children books are some of the most innovative adventures ever written. I have therefore, naturally, ripped the whole series though I have not yet listened to them all.  I have processed all these unabridged books in the following ways:

1. All of these books were ripped BY ME. I did this a few years ago and have posted the unchapterized versions before, but again, even if you downloaded these copies before, I highly recommend updating to these copies as there have been volume corrections as well the chapterization. All the rips are from high quality library CDs.

2. Equalized volume. Several of these audio books had volume discontinuities. I have equalized volumes so there shouldn't be any sudden jumps.

3. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.

4. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took a several days. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "end of side one, please turn over this cassette") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.

5. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

6. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.

And so this torrent represents a 100% complete collection of Auel's fictional works. She has thus far written 5 Earth's Children novels and no other fiction.

Please leave any comments or questions -- as always all compliments and suggestions are HIGHLY APPRECIATED. If you like you may also email me at richard.fannon@gmail.com.

Enjoy!
