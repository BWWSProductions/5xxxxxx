System Requirements:

Microsoft Windows 98SE/ME/2000/XP
500 MHz CPU (600 MHz recommended)
128 MB RAM
1.3 MB Free drive space
Windows Media Player 9 or 10
Multichannel sound card (except Turtle Beach)
A minimum of 4 speakers
Note: It is important that you set-up your system to play back in the
appropriate configuration. For example, if for any reason the 5.1
sound card is configured as stereo in the control panel, then no
sound will be delivered to the rear channels at any time, even with
the Circle Surround II Plug-in.
