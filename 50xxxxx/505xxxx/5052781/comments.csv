,dr_mason,2011-06-07T05:23Z,"both the keygen *AND* the QuickTime install in this torrent are malware. I registered specifically to call BlackTroy an ASSHOLE. 
Take the name 'Troy' to heart - this thing has two major Trojan Horse pieces of malware. MalwareBites cleaned it all off but it took over 8 hours and found 300 self-spawning malware pieces. fuck you, asshole. Use the codes above and Quark XPress itself works fine. What a *douche.* Do *not* use the keygen and do NOT install QuickTime within the install."
,mybmdub,2011-08-23T23:44Z,"My security software ended up cleaning the key generator file, but I used the keys posted by 36gerard and it worked perfectly on Windows 7 :)

Thank you BlackTroy!"
,c2h5oh,2011-09-01T13:38Z,"Anyone who has access to version 9 for opplode

Thanks in advance"
,cedders,2011-11-23T04:04Z,"c2h5oh (ethanol)
You can obtain version 9.1 from the Quark website or from torrent 6800434. Beware that the keygen in THIS upload works ONLY with version 8."
