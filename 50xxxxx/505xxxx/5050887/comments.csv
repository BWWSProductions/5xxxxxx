Shout out to the PRISM V2 for the starting source.[/b]

**NOTE** This still has the ""tinty"" sound! .. I removed some of the ""fuzzyness"" from the picture and enhanced some colors. It was already a rather good source as it was.

""DO NOT"" put that info on my up-loads as it is INCORRECT .. I gave credit to PRISM for the ""starting source"" ..but I changed EVERYTHING else completly.. all the info you put there is WRONG. I suggest you look at thing a little better before you start posting on other peoples torrents. Please Don't let it happen again.
