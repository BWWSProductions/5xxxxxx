I made shortcut to desktop and start the game. All the adverstisement movies come up, but as soon as the game has to go into menu (i gues) it crashes and give me this message in a window:

- RB_SwitchRenderTarget: Image Is Not A Render Target. Under it i get a a lot of text in the window about everything that has been loaded ..

Anyone has the same problem ??

Im on Windows Vista 64bit. Everything is updated on my machine and play all games without any probs ..."
