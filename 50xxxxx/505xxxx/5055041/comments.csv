,heynow07,2009-08-16T10:39Z,what is a trp file anyway?
,modmania,2009-08-16T20:19Z,"its a recording off a dvd type box. 

I wasnt able to grab time to get a converter for it. 

But if u burn it to a disc u dont really need to convert it anyway. as long as u use convert x to dvd, it converts it for you."

Category 	Video Files
File Description 	High definition video file saved in the MPEG-2 Part 1 transport format; used for multiplexing digital video and audio streams and synchronizing the output; includes features for error correction and is often used in digital video broadcasting (DVB).

TRP files often contain H.264 video and AC3 audio data; they can be played with various video playback programs.

Video transport themes may also be saved as .TS files."
,heynow07,2009-08-16T21:26Z,I just finished downloading the file. I can confirm that it's real. The only downside I can see is that the movie is not in widescreen ratio. But the image and sound quality are great.
,SchoolyardKiller,2009-08-16T22:32Z,Will it play on VLC Media Player?
