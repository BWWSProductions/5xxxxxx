,jeff9559,2009-08-21T04:59Z,Damn i didnt know this was fucking audio i thought it was video cuz it was in AVi format
,item9,2009-08-23T15:59Z,If you want a real fight watch Boxing. Instead of a couple Pansie's half naked holding each other in a cage. Seriously They should just film bar fights MMA my ass. Nothing mixed about it lol just pure old fashioned ass grabbing.
,shivman,2009-08-24T04:08Z,"Jeff, sounds like you need to install the proper codecs. do a search for a good codec pack and you'll see the video after install. Good fights too."
,jeff9559,2009-08-24T07:20Z,"@shivman turns out when i download a movie from a torrent and open the avi in windows media player its just audia but when i convert it to mp4 so it works with itunes it work perfect

@item9 Boxing is old gay and has a really bad rep UFC is new and is better cuz there not as many rules and its MMA not just punching and grappleing"

,NiallMofo,2011-07-08T06:17Z,"@item9 They put a boxer and a ufc fighter in the ring together......The boxer got tapped out in the first round, what a disappointment of a fighter. Boxing is shit."
