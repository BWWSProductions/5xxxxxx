This is an interesting documentary/reality show which the BBC produced.

They sent a guy into a few countries on Bush's "Axis of Evil" list to see how things really were inside each one. 

The series begins with North Korea, which is fascinating in and of itself, but the list also includes Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and Cuba. 




Enjoy and Seed!!
