Release Title: Fighting Unrated 2009 BRRip H264 AAC-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)
Release Date: 16 August 2009
Release Length: 01:47:20
Storyline: In director Dito Montiels 2009 drama, FIGHTING, Channing Tatum 
(G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA) portrays Shawn, a young man from the South trying to make a living on the 
streets of New York City. When Shawn gets into an altercation ... Full Descriptionwhile selling bootleg 
CDs and DVDs, a con man (Terrence Howard) who witnesses the brawl takes him under his wing and introduces 
Shawn to NYCs underground street-fighting circuit. In these bare-knuckle battles, Shawn has a chance to 
win significant money--and also the heart of the beautiful Zulay (Zulay Henao). A film that goes beyond 
its deceptively simple title and premise, FIGHTING is elevated by the keen eye of Montiel, who also co-wrote 
the script with Robert Munic, and the charismatic presence of Tatum, who previously had a minor role in 
the writer-directors cinematic debut, A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS. Although the film goes through 
the standard up-by-the-bootstraps dramatic cycle, the performances of Tatum, Howard, and Henao make the 
story surprisingly compelling, and the fight sequences are exceptionally fierce, giving the movie considerable 
added zest. Though less high-profile than combat classics such as ROCKY and THE KARATE KID, FIGHTING fits 
well into the category of revered movies of the boxing/martial-arts subgenre.
