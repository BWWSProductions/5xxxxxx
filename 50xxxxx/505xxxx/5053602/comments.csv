,Bombardem,2009-08-14T23:54Z,"If you check out http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/district9 it's getting a large number of 100 scores, and the critics who dont like it are still giving it 50's, which most films dream of getting."

,zlloyd1,2009-08-15T05:01Z,How come every time I try to find the torrent for this movie it's either in a foreign language or it requires you to get a code from a website that wants you to sign up for advertisements. Does anyone know where I can get an English version of this torrent without having to buy a bunch of useless crap?? Please!!!! :D

,D3vo666,2009-08-15T13:51Z,Word is there is going to be an English version uploaded sometime today! Just wait a lil longer..
,dae-rhyme,2009-08-15T15:11Z,"i need this movie in english asap, my veins r pulsating............"
,dae-rhyme,2009-08-15T15:14Z,any word on the goods yet?
,D3vo666,2009-08-15T15:35Z,"Shitty deal, that's the talk on Demonoid... if im wrong so be it just given ppl a lil hope. But like you said 2 - 4 days aint bad at all. I think I'll survive :)"
,tomoxicillin,2009-08-15T15:50Z,If you bunch of crying cheap bastards want english then go spend the 7 to 10 dollars and go watch the fucking movie in the theater. for gods sake you people waste more time tring to to get something for free. if you put a doolar amount on your time you have spent tring to get this movie you hve lost more money and time then if you just went and paid to see it. for ghods sake just go support the film makers or good movie like this wont come along very offten.
,Roberts_The_Vile,2009-08-15T17:52Z,"Good quality cam capture with moderately adequate audio quality. All-in-all, damn nice seeing it actually make it up on the same day the film was released.

This version is entirely in Russian and also subed in Russian (for alien dialogue.)

There is no English cam available at the moment (and not just at PB, but everywhere,) but typical waiting time on majorly hyped, heavily protected films like this one is around 10 days or so. So, it's really a matter of patience.

People may be lucky enough today to catch an english version upload, and with it numerous seeds within a reasonable amount of time. However, that is VERY unlikely.

So, hang tight.

This is a movie good enough to wait a few days, seriously. I would rank it and Dark Knight as two of the greatest motion pictures in the past decade, hands down. Mind-blowing..."
,djbiggins,2009-08-15T19:05Z,"seen the trailers and this looks fucking wicked if jacksons directing then its got to be good, btw folks the hobbit has got the go-ahead and guess what, jacksons directing couple or three years away though, worth the wait me thinks!!"
,crawman,2009-08-15T21:19Z,":tomoxicillin
Too many this has NOTHING to do with being cheap and not spending the few measly dollars for this movie. It has to do with people who are the same shoes as myself, in my case Iam currently living in Thailand and its not slated for release here for over a month from now (which is BS)  I downloaded wolverine the 2nd day it was on torrent but still paid and went and saw it in the theater. After all the reviews this movie has been getting I am pissed that I cant see it just because I am not residing in the f*cking studios ""de$ired"" region.  This whole region locking/controlling is why I SO support torrents..."
,D3vo666,2009-08-15T23:21Z,"English audio has been uploaded, now to sync"
,ticalboss,2009-08-16T00:19Z,Go to torrent portal and search District 9 for a dvdscreener and in english
,DirtyBoots71,2009-08-16T00:36Z,Video15 is full of shit. Its not at dakmovies.com. 
,RockIntoMordor,2009-08-16T03:25Z,"Excellent movie. I saw it opening night and was blown away. I hope the English gets uploaded soon, I'm dying to see it again."
,DirtyBoots71,2009-08-16T04:23Z,"Why do people gotta put up these bogus sites for veiwing? All they do is make you keep answering questions, trying to get you to subscribe to something and you never get to see the movie. So masod89as9 and all your ilk, go fuck off."
,LordOrwell,2009-08-16T06:34Z,i think it is obvious why some countries get movies sooner than others.  It is released as the translations are ready.  And i would suppose china would be last due to their propensity to pirate everything.
,danteferret,2009-08-16T07:47Z,"Download this torrent, then search google for the ""District 9 English audio"".

Play them side by side!

That's what I did, worked great.

And yes I plan on seeing this again in theaters!"
,Tehmulletman,2009-08-16T11:13Z,"ignore these douchbags you have to join by credit card in one of those damn loop things...
found one in english but Russian alien subtitles
at mininova pretty much same thing danteferret did except its done for you still cant wait to see the real thing when i have some time..."
,Tehmulletman,2009-08-16T11:14Z,"*WISH I COULD EDIT* 
wrong torrent lol although it seems it is spreading to this one as well videohit is full of balogna"
,hurgab,2009-08-16T16:28Z,"@tomoxicillin

I would actually gladly pay to see this movie in  the theatre. But with a 3 year old? I have to hire a nanny for 3-4 hours to see a movie like this. So, it's not 7-10 dollars for me - it's more like 60-80$. 
C'mon movie industry - wake up! There's a market out there: I would gladly pay 20$ so the family gets to see this movie (minus the 3 year old). "
,Roberts_The_Vile,2009-08-16T18:12Z,"Even if these horse-shit, fly by night streaming sites actually told the TRUTH, how many of you would get depressed to know how stupid the average person can be to think that streaming anything is ""better?""

Streaming video? Are you fucking kidding me? What the Hell is wrong with the people who are making you spam torrent sites with bogus links all day?

...just go find the nearest convenient fire and DIE IN IT."
,semismoker,2009-08-16T19:46Z,there is an english version at mininova. and also eng. audio-torrent there.....cheers.... ;-)

,MauriceBerne,2009-08-19T23:10Z,"Excellent film, Russian subs could have done without but got the idea.  Niel Bromkamp and Peter Jackson are a fantastic team!"
