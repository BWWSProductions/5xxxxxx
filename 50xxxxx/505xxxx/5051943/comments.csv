You are screwing up the search results. I was searching for Watchmen and the first page is FLOODED with videos that DO NOT match Watchmen, nor are they related to it in any way... and all those unrelated search results are your torrents.

It's really making a mess of things, so PLEASE change the way you are promoting yourself."

,dlarrym,2009-08-15T04:16Z,"Just to stand up extremezone!!! I have been coming to this site for several years.. I am certain that ""extremezone"" knows the policy and I have no doubt this was an oversite and wasn't done on purpose. Definitely not done with the intent to screw up peoples searches on purpose. We have all been guilty of quickly highlghting a gruop of text or other info and then pasting it and later realizing that some or part of what you highlighted to copy and paste was info you didn't mean to highlight.With Extremezones record of always being within the guidelines of this site, I am very sure it was a simple mistake... No disrespect to Mr. Blue skull, I know you have to enforce the rules and that you wouldn't do so if there wasn't a good reason too. SO... having said all that.... lets all resume being civil to one another and move on.   One las thing, MR HONEY2MEAT is a total liar... his link is too a site that is only trying to trick anyone who goes there into giving up info about them selves including your cell number and other things... To view this supposed FREE movie, you have to give them your cell number and if you don't then you will nevere get the password to view the FREE movie... IT IS A SCAM!!!!! NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR CELL NUMBER.....!!!!!!!!!!!!! HONEY2MEAT...move the fuck on to another site that is not like this one and has morons visiting it because your phishing for numbers won't go on here..... BY BY any one with any ability to do this that I am about to suggest, should BLOCK this HONEY2MEAT username... he is trying to take advantage of TPB's loyal patrons.... THANKS..... TPB's gaurdain Angel.... dlarrym (delerium)"
