,Megapoop4,2010-01-29T01:56Z,"If emulating on epsxe 1.7.0 use the following settings for your (""legal"") backups :

Video:  ""Pete's OpenGL2 2.9
Audio:  ""ePSXe SPU core 1.7.0
CD:  ""ePSXe CDR WNT/W2K cor 1.7.0""
BIOS:  NTSC

These settings have been tested and work well for Legend of the Dragoon.

P.S.  ePSXe 1.7 has a known CD change issue.  When you get to a part where you have to change CD's, create cue files for all your .bin's (http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/881/how-do-i-open-or-mount-a-bin-file-without-a-cue-file/) then mount them with alcohol 52% free version (tested and working, poweriso does not work)

This game is epic so i'm gonna try to make sure this torrent does not die.  If you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them

I will stop seeding in 1 week if this thing doesn't get at least 5 seeders (currently it has 1 seeder and 65 leechers, the stats on the site are wrong)"
,thetankdude,2010-05-24T16:48Z,ok there are about 5 seeders and it will take about 2 hours but it worth it
