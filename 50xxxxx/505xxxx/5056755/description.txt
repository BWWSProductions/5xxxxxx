Feel That Fire is the fourth studio album by American country music singer Dierks Bentley. It was released on February 3, 2009 (see 2009 in country music) on Capitol Records Nashville. Its lead-off single is its title track, which reached Number One on the Billboard country charts. The second single is "Sideways", which also went to number one. A third single, "I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes", was released in July 2009.

As with all of his previous recordings for Capitol Records, Bentley co-produced the album with Brett Beavers. Bentley co-wrote most of the album's songs along with both Brett and Jim Beavers, the latter of whom is Brett's brother. "I Can't Forget Her", one of only two songs on this album which Bentley did not co-write, was previously recorded by Clay Walker on his 2003 album A Few Questions.
The title track, which Bentley and Brett Beavers co-wrote with The Warren Brothers (Brad and Brett Warren), was also the first release from the album. This song became Bentley's sixth Number One hit on the Billboard country charts in early 2009. Following it was "Sideways", a Jim Beavers co-write which became Bentley's seventh Number One hit in July 2009.
