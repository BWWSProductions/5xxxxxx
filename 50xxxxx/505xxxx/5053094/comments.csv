[V],Kuthumi,2009-08-14T18:33Z,"Dear Verifire,
Thank you for doing something you believe in, and for having faith. Today, I think you are a little paranoid, because PirateBay's statistics is showing ""ghost seeders"" for almost all new torrents, including mine. Please keep up your good work!"
[T],verifire,2009-08-14T19:39Z,"@""Kuthumi "": Thank you for your support. Even so; ""ghost seeders"" are not normal. And it's not TPB that gives me these statistics, it's uTorrent itself. TPB often show that there are no seeders at all, while uTorrent after some minutes shows three. Anyway, ""paranoid"" means ""fear of the supernatural"" and I have no such. I just state facts before my very eyes, and when it comes to the upload speed that are constantly being hindered, like I say, to the extremest of low (and there's nothing wrong with my provider. I've checked thoroughly), there's nothing to explain it but deliberate hindering me in spreading the stuff I do. When I shange port, it picks up again, but then suddenly, I'm down to a maximum 1-5 kbps.. :-)"
[T],verifire,2009-08-14T19:42Z,"@""Kuthumi "": PS. I really like your upload from the 2nd of March this year.. :-)"
