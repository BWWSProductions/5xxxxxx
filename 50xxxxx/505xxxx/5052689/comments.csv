You might find things that are inconvenient like, you know, facts.  And then you might figure out that it is the facts themselves that have a liberal bias.  We don't want that.  It is much better for you to submit to a brainless lunatic who contradicts himself so often his critics don't even bother to keep count.  Heaven forbid you pick up a book by Noam Chomsky and actually learn how your elite fellow citizens exploit you and treat you like you are nothing all the while lying straight to your face how much they love their country and their countrymen.  If you are really a patriot you will at least entertain the idea that maybe you have been deceived.  Think about it.  All of the people who give you information are millionaires.  ALL OF THEM.  What do you have in common with them?  What do they really have in common with you?  Rich Americans have more in common with rich people in other countries than they do with their fellow countrymen.  That is why we are still selling out our jobs and our industrial base.  Weakening the country in this way doesn't hurt the rich, ""The World Is Flat"" for them (Billionaire Thomas Friedman wrote that book).  You all need to start to think for yourselves otherwise it will be too late for all of us who are not rich."

Acorn
Tides Foundation
Apollo Group
Green Jobs Czar (Van Jones)
Science Czar (John Holdren)
Zeke Emanuel
