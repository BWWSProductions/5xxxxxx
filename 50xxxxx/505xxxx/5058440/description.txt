I looked everywhere to find a copy of this movie for years and finally I got hold of this. You don't want to know where its coming from. Bottom line: Its super rare and somewhat of a cult film. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.

Description: La Belle Verte is written and directed by Colline Serreau, a woman film maker from France. Her film is probably the only French film of recent times that talks of nature, environment and importance of greenery in our daily existence. In La Belle Verte, we see how an alien lady (played by Colline Serreau herself) from a green planet (La Belle Verte - the Beautiful Green) descend on French capital Paris in order to gather information about the status of greenery on Earth. What follows is absolutely shocking for this alien as she learns that earth's inhabitants have almost no respect for nature,greenery and environment. Apart from its pro nature stance, La Belle Verte is also a searing attack on consumerist society where modern human beings have no idea of nature's power. This forces them to eat meat, and listen to music which is nothing but rubish.

Supposedly there exist a DVD box set of Colline Serreau's films with "La Belle Verte" on it. If you have it please do a better job of me and republish this. This one was made from a Betamax tape but is acceptable quality. Could probably be much smaller but I am not a encoder guru.

Hope you enjoy it. Leave a comment if you do.
