Sartre
by Neil Levy (Oneworld Publishing)


"Combining information with an entertaining style, this concise guide to the life and work of the great philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre focuses uniquely on his life as a whole, not simply on his theories of existentialism. Covering everything from Sartreâ€™s concept of human freedom to his espousal of Marxism and his impact on twentieth-century thought, this is an authoritative work that will challenge undergraduates and general readers alike to think again about human freedom and moral choice."
