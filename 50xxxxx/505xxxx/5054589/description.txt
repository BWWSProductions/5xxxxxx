The roots of GÃ¡yan Uttejak Orchestra (GUO) date back to the end of the 19th Century, as the â€œGÃ¡yan Uttejak Mandalâ€, archetype of GUOâ€™s establisher, the â€œGÃ¡yan Uttejak Societyâ€ (founded in Hungary, 1981), was operated by Navraojji Kabraji and V.N. Bhatkhande, between 1870 and 1917, in Mumbai. The Society was expanded in 1984 with the â€œArchive of Oriental Musicâ€, to be considered unique and unrivalled in Eastern Europe, the â€œGÃ¡yan Uttejak Studioâ€ and the â€œGÃ¡yan Uttejak Orchestraâ€, composed of musicians of the most diverse nationality and being the direct progenitor of the current GUO.
 
Music of GUO combines music of non-existing mythological worlds and Extra-European high music cultures with creative techniques aimed at a possible, global still virtual language of music that nevertheless differs fundamentally from the realized world music.
 
GUOâ€™s futuristic compositions have been published by Dutch, German, American, Greek, Indian, French, British and Hungarian record companies. Besides the more than 50 published records, GUO has been recognized a lot of different awards: German Grand Prize for reinterpretation of Hungarian folk music; the Album of the Year (repeatedly) in New-Zealand; Margen Award in Spain; 19th place in the Backroads World Music chart, Octopus award in France etc.
 
In concert, the traditional Hindu-Islamic and classical Asian musical textures are performed by GUO in the original orchestration, effectuating simultaneously a live-electronic sound synthesis controlled by the traditional instruments, in complete conformity with 21st Century traditions of GUO.
