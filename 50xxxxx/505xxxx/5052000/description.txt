Description**:Commando is a 1985 American action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The film's use of humor in an action film context became a distinctive element in Schwarzenegger's later roles.
John Matrix is a retired special operations operator who once led an elite unit. He left the service to live in a secluded mountain home with his daughter Jenny. Unbeknownst to Matrix, the members of his former unit are being killed one by one. Even though Matrix's friend Major General Franklin Kirby gives Matrix armed guards, attackers manage to kidnap Matrix and Jenny. Matrix learns that Bennett, a former disgraced member of his unit who was presumed dead, is still alive. Bennett has kidnapped his daughter to try to force Matrix to commit a political assassination for a man called Arius (who calls himself "El Presidente") and his gang of other disgraced U.S. soldiers. Arius is a warlord formerly bested by Matrix during a previous revolution attempt; he now wishes to lead a military coup in his home country, Val Verde. Since Arius will have Jenny killed if Matrix refuses, Matrix reluctantly accepts the demand.
