Just changed the cover art. If you want it, take it.

This compilation of current 'summer songs' & other eclectic offerings, paired with excerpts from Ken Russell's film, Song of Summer (1968), was inspired by Kate Bush's very modern 1980 song of almost the same name, 'Delius (Song Of Summer)', which of course was inspired by the film.

This updated telling of the story of English composer Frederick Delius, his wife and his amanuensis, Eric Fenby, focuses on the latter-Fenby.

Songs.Of.Summer[Fenby] includes songs from these artists; Kate Bush, Bon Iver, Air France, Wax Tailor, Flying Lotus, Elbow, Sia, Hot Chip, Fantomas, Empire Of The Sun, Busdriver, PJ Harvey, Metric, Cut Copy, Friendly Fires, Lost Tribe, The Avalanches, Peter Gabriel, Interpol and The Knife.

Songs.Of.Summer[Fenby] is 98min, split into 'Four Sides', created in Peak and sent to iTunes w/AAC compression.

Oh, um - Complete track listings for each side can be found under the information tab in the comments of the torrent and in the DL'd file when put into iTunes using 'apple I' when file is highlighted under the lyrics tab.

The only difference btwn this & my other torrents of the same name is a slightly more accurate track listing.
