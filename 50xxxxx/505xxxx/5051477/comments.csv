,devilsgamer,2009-08-17T23:59Z,YOU ARE THE MAN... 
,Rang3r187,2009-08-19T23:40Z,"The ridiculous thing here is you people bitching about updates when Astra was still beta. Of fuking course they are going to have new builds. I'm also a beta tester. If you think pushing new builds is a waste of bandwidth, maybe you should get off your dialup account. LOL.

This should be the final release provided there are no security patches from now until 4.1 Alpha starts."
,4RM0,2009-08-20T17:34Z,Thanks again for the crack.
,oogabubchub,2009-08-28T16:49Z,"Thanks for the torrent. I'm downloading trillian for the first time now that it has launched a final version. It's asking me for a confirmation code that was sent to me through email. Is there any way to get around this? I didn't have a beta account, and you can't sign up for an account on the website for the Windows version anymore."
,oogabubchub,2009-08-28T17:15Z,"Nevermind, I'm an idiot."
,Riyukko,2009-08-28T23:41Z,Thanks so much for this torrent. :] A total lifesaver.
