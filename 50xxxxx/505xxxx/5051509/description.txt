Description:

Breathe Better and Easier.
Swim Better and Easier.

Nothing is more essential to a swimmer than air. Yet few swimmers truly understand how to breathe efficiently. Not just to get air, but to integrate breathing seamlessly with the stroke. Breathing is sometimes viewed as a liability or inconvenience, but when you do it right, breathing can actually make your stroke better. This video shows you how.
