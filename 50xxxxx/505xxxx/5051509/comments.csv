Do you also have the other vids previewed at the end of this one?


Thanks again!"
,MrMooManC,2009-08-15T11:06Z,"I don't have the ones at the end ""Better Fly For Every Body"" and ""Breatstroke For Every Body"" unfortunately.

I do have the ""Total Immersion - Freestyle Made Easy"" which I will upload soon. You can find an old version on torrent but I have the latest one just ripped from DVD. I just need to bookmark the chapters first before uploading it. It is the best freestyle swimming instruction DVD out there.

Another good one is ""Total Immersion - 4 Strokes made easy"". I don't have the DVD of this, but someone has put it up:
