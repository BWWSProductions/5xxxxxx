---------------------------------------
At the end of this week I am stepping down from the gordsmash title and giving it to my pal. I want to thank everyone for supporting gordsmash and uploading my torrents to keep them alive! I hoped that everyone of you has enjoyed my torrents! I want to thank all of you for supporting me! Thank you all and goodbye!"
,kuttunni,2010-05-27T08:41Z,thanks nice one
,fede184,2010-06-19T17:01Z,"In the intro Dori Smith boasts about her qualifications, but personally I'm not impressed by her teaching skills. Content is OK, presentation is not."
,fede184,2010-06-20T17:48Z,"OK, I sat through about half the course now, and I must say I seriously can't recommend it. Dori Smith has a very poor programming style, with bad programs as a result. Also she forgets to explain half of the stuff she uses.
If you want to learn JavaScript I'd recommend a book instead. There's loads of them here on TPB.

All in all, about the worst Lynda.com title I've watched so far."
,ameer71,2010-07-22T10:18Z,"is this the complete one?
because i've downloaded this from some where else 3 times and it only has first two chapters :(:(:("

,wave1077,2011-02-20T15:23Z,Thank you very much
,rockbox3,2011-02-25T12:55Z,Gordsmash is legendary. So many good torrents for learning. Thanks more than millions
,blokeymate87,2011-08-22T16:38Z,"Don't download this unless you want to listen to hour upon hour of Dori Smith's annoying voice as she incessantly rambles, largely about things that are totally irrelevant to the process of actually learning JavaScript.

Thanks anyway gordsmash, you saved me from a Lynda.com subscription!"
,w00tbie,2012-06-03T09:14Z,thanks FatFreddy756 !!!
,AguaChile,2012-06-05T15:40Z,"You guys who are complaining are lightweights.  True, Dori does not have the smooth, warm, ultra friendly ""that's kinda cool"" voice of other Lynda instructors, but this woman is a true expert, and if you put your nose to the grinding wheel, you can learn very fast with her.  Obviously, she is used to talking at the professional conference level.  I don't mind.  Thanks to FatFreddy, Dori, and the folks at Lynda."
