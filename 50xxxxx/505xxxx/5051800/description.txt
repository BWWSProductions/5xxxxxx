The Burning Man Festival (1997)

This documentary was shot in the summer of 1995, back when the Burning Man Festival attracted "only" 4,000 participants. Back then it was possible to actually see the entire event and visit most all of the artists in the four days it lasted. Ten years later, the spirit of the event is much the same, despite its rapid growth - although the organizers, for obvious safety reasons, no longer permit the fast driving and sport-shooting of automatic weapons depicted in this film.
