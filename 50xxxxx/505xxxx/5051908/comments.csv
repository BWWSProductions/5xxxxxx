,scottyscum,2009-08-14T03:45Z,"Here we go again!! I upped this at Demonoid close to 20 hours ago, and nothing. So, I figured I'd try it here, and nothing. What the hell is wrong I wish I knew. Please don't leave a shitty comment or message me ""seed please"" or whatever. I've now tried to share this on 2 different trackers and am getting really pissed off. I guess for some reason I can't upload anymore?? If someone REALLY WANTS THIS BAD, and I mean REALLY BAD, I could add it to my share on Soulseek and you could get it there. If this doesn't start downloading pretty soon, I'm just going to have to assume it's never going to, and I'm going to have to forget it alltogether. The Soulseek option is only a last ditch effort, and if you do ask me to do that, please have a decent download speed. Hey, I'm trying, don't know what else I can do. "
