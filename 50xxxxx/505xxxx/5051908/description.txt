An unusual Italian spaghetti western from director Mario Bava, most known for his horror films. Watch for the scene with the gunfighter walking into a saloon, it will have you laughing, or just scratching your head thinking "what?" It's a cartoonish scene that can't really be explained, you have to see it for yourself.
