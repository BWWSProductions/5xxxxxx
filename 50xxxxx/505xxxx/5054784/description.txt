Plate Tectonics is a music album constructed from Sci-Fi synthesizers, modified animal calls, metallic sounds, & the human voice (often distorted beyond recognition & used as a rhythm instrument). It is either unusually smooth industrial or unusually abrasive ambient music (with occasional side stops in 80s-inspired Synthpop), with songs acting as soundtracks to non-existent films about intergalactic tunnel worms, Moon Fish, & cannibalistic swamp hermits. Listen to it & you will never be unhappy again. This is a guarantee (this is not a guarantee).
