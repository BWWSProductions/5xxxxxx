I haven't heard this for a long time so i thought i would put this up
first off it's comedy by rodney rude.. if not australia's most well known fouled mouth comedian.. have a listen if you have a few megabytes to spare

with impersonations of bruce springsteen, johnny cash, clint eastwood, slim dusty and
Queen Elizabeth II..
anyway i thought you'd be the judge of this one.. can't stop laughing myself

If you like rodney rude i will end up putting the best of of which this came from
but there is some on piratebay for sure somewhere, Bubanee
