it's not like were out ruining the new episodes of lazytown for you.

can someone ( a mod maybe) just ban this person's IP address.  problem solved.

p.s. stephanie plays soccer with sportagus and learns a lesson about sharing. haha just ruined this week's Lazytown for you!!!"
,Cooldude_SS,2009-08-19T07:26Z,"lol.....i look forward to the spoiler, i still watch it anyways. "
,Lyttan,2009-08-19T10:25Z,IsnÂ´t there someone who can delete that idiots comments?
,Dr_Science,2009-08-19T18:10Z,"blocking your ip address would at least slow you down.  blocking your username would also slow you down.  I know what a proxy is.  I would say that the only thing in this world that you know that I don't is how cock tastes.

lazytown is a show for kids and dumbass adults- google it.

I don't know why I am bothering....the whole reason this guy does this is to make people angry and read their angry comments.  its pathetic and I pity you.  My roommate who is going to grad school to be a headshrink (psychiatrist) says you do it because you have abandonment issues and your parents didn't show you attention...possibly the product of a broken home where the remaining parent abused or neglected you. attention starved. Racist. sad.  

you escape to the internet where you can hide your true identity and have a feeling of power over people and at the same time announce ""I've seen this episode!"".  This feeling is a high for you releasing dopamine in your brain- and you can forget your real life problems for a while.

This is pathetic, childish and no one is impressed, not even your midget asian boyfriend.  so let's hear your next dumbass comeback. or do I have to wait until next week for the pleasure of your conversation?"
,Dr_Science,2009-08-19T18:32Z,Can't wait.  and with every post one step closer to a trace.
,Dr_Science,2009-08-19T18:38Z,"and p.s. I could care what You say, Hells Kitchen ( I don't even watch it my wife does), Lazy Town ( my kid watches).  I watch real shows jackass not a show about some brit yelling at americans about how shit the are.  I don't even have a roommate.  and it looks like I've pissed you off.  but I'll talk to ya next week.  I love having fun with people half my intelligence.

and just so were clear---i meant block you when the torrent posts so at least the first handful of leachers will be spared your ignorance.  I bet when you were a kid you ran around screaming ""look at me, look at me!"" ( when you wern't being sodomized by your uncle that is.)"

,Dr_Science,2009-08-20T17:22Z,are people yelling at me or at spoilers.  Cause I'm the one with the wife and kids.  not this assclown spoilers.
,white-hot,2009-08-22T00:03Z,Nice to see the Moron_Spoilers got his ass booted. Personally I don't see why you others comment on what that idot says. He obviously has no life and gets off when you scream back at him. And who cares if we know who goes home? I don't really care: I just want to see the action and almost always the best one makes it in the end.
