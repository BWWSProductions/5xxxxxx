Who could ever forget this one? With just seventeen ticks of the clock left at Carmichael Auditorium in the final game of the '73-'74 regular season against rival Duke, the Tar Heels trailed 86-78. Also, this was before the three point shot which makes it even that much more incredible that they were able to pull it off. It began innocently enough with a pair of free throws by Bobby Jones. A Duke turnover led to a John Kuester bucket with 13 seconds left. The Tar Heels then stole the Blue Devil inbounds pass which led to a Jones layup and it was down to just a two point lead with six seconds to go. Duke was finally able to get the ball inbounds to Pete Kramer this time but after he was fouled with four seconds left he missed a free throw that would have clinched the game for Duke. UNC rebounded and called timeout with three seconds to go to setup the final shot. It went to Walter Davis near midcourt who took two dribbles and then sank a 30 footer to tie the game as the buzzer sounded. The overtime was anti-climactic as the Heels finished off the greatest comeback in NCAA history.
