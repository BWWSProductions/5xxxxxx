,secretss,2009-08-20T19:36Z,"Awesome! Download was really fast and it works perfectly. 

I got a dialogue box when I clicked on PhotoshopCS4.exe; it said something about the previous PhotoshopPortable session not saving local settings or something like that. It also asked if I want to try and load settings. I clicked on OK. 

Then there was a big wait between clicking on the PhotoshopCS4.exe file and when the Photoshop splash screen finally popped up. At first I thought the download was a dud since nothing happened, but I gave it a couple minutes and a window appeared, and all I had to do was click on ""Agree"" and the blue photoshop splash screen came up. Waited a bit more for the plugins to load and stuff and Photoshop Portable was ready to go! Thank you! This is great!

Here are the instructions:
1. Move the folder ""Portable Adobe Photoshop CS4 - Uploaded by _PathOfMySelf_"" to where you want Photoshop to be located and run PhotoshopCS4.exe.

That's it! No installation! The PhotoshopCS4.exe is the actual application, NOT an installation file."
