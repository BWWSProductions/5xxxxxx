This 1964 recording was Hampton Hawesâ€™s first in more than five years.  It radiates the sense of freedom the pianist felt after John F.  Kennedy granted him a presidential pardon halfway through a ten-year sentence for substantial indiscretion.  The session made it plain that Hawes was still one of the most important pianists in jazz, as inventive as ever and with added richness in his harmonic structures.  Hawes heard special qualities in Dmitri Tiomkinâ€™s â€œThe Green Leaves of Summer,â€ gave it one of his loveliest introductions, and made it a memorable jazz waltz.  The album has special treatments of pieces by Davis, Rollins, Arlen, and Berlin, and includes one of Hawesâ€™s custom-tailored blues.

I have had this album for years on vinyl and it is good to have it on CD, a fine addition to excellent 1955/56 trio sessions and the all night quartet session of 1956.  The usual selection of standards, jazz standards and blues.  Great.  ~ bothamsmith
