And, the Bible really shouldn't be synonymous with the so called ""Christians"" who do the opposite of what Jesus teaches, you think? You know: ""Love your enemies, do good agains those who hate you, pray for those that persecute you.."" and so on..?

But that's just me reasoning.."

So I'm glad to be able to tell you that you're perfectly right when it comes to your comments on the politicians and world government. But you'd rather take a deeper dive into the occult to get the actual BIG picture.. You know.. to see things from a higher altitude..

Again; only my research and humble opinion..

But what about the e-book on electric timers to set off fires you've uploaded.. Creepy.. But that's probably another story.. Oh well.."
