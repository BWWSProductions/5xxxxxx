,bearcy,2009-10-10T16:08Z,"These drivers are XP-drivers, and they are dated 2006 October 29.

This means that this DVD contains more than a 100 thousand drivers for WinXP, but none for WinVista, Win7, or any other Operating Systems.

So the statement that you'll never need any more drivers beyond this DVD, is a bit exaggerated.

But as long as you are satisfied with only using WinXP, I guess it will be a handy tool."
