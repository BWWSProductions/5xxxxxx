Did that ringing noise on "Julia" bother anyone else? It bothered me. Sounds to me like somebody had the TV on during the recording. It's a narrow ringing noise from around 15.25 to 16.2 kilocycles. I took it out. Your ears will thank me, those of you that haven't lost your high-frequency hearing.

And for the sake of convenience, the Purple Chick version of "Piggies", which combined their source with the Anthology version, is here as well. I prefer to listen to it than the Complete Home Recordings version, personally.
