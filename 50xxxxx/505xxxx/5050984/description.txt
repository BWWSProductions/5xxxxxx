Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s.

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them.

It's a team effort. Please do your part.

Until I see enough seeding of previous episodes, I won't be allowing anyone to get 100% of the rest of this season, nor uploading seasons 4 - 10. No apologies.
