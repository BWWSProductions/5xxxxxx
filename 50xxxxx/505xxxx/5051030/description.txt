Neat Records was arguably the main label instrumental in the revival of heavy metal in the early 80's in the UK. 
The movement was known as the "New Wave Of British Heavy Metal" or NWOBHM for short.
The "One Take No Dubs (Live In The Studio)" EP, marked the first vinyl appearances of four bands : Avenger, Hellanbach and Black Rose, all of whom went on to release product on Neat, as well as the lesser known Alien. 
Recorded live in Neat's Wellness Studio, the EP proved a great showcase for the bands and, like much of Neat's early catalogue, has become very collectable nowadays.
