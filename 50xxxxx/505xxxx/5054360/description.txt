Compressed with WinRar, game was tested on a sega dc console and works.

Try 7zip its free google it, if don't have WinRar.

Note: Some later versions of Sega dreamcast consoles supposedly won't allow utopia or copies of games, not sure if this is true but to be on the safe side try to use a console manufactured before october 2000.  You can find the manfacture date on the bottom of the console on the sticker in fine print just look for it. 


Game Description:

Get ready for a new and improved kick in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 for dc edited with Michael Jackson's hit songs, and other features. Fun if your looking for something a little different. 

COVER ART AND AUDIO EDITED by z
CHARACTER ART EDITED by DJ FAT and Silent H

All songs have been replaced with various hits by none other than Michael Jackson, and have been edited to loop as seemlessly as possible. Surely (especially) if you get wrapped up in the fast action, you probably won't even notice when songs repeat! I feel there isn't even any need to spoil which tracks are in the game, but there's bound to be at least a few of your favorites!

All buttons (with the exception of LP) have had their colors edited. Even projectiles and other related particle effects match the character's color theme.
