See, when we search for a specific movie title that you included in one of your info links, (unrelated though it may be to the torrent itself) -- all your unrelated shit turns up when we search for that specific title.

So, no... I'm NOT pleased to see ""District 9"" in the search results when I was looking for ""Ice Age"".

You fucktard, STOP ADVERTISING YOUR TORRENTS!! If your vids are good, your reputation will be spread by ""word of mouth"". Let axxo be your guide.

People like you are turning Pirate Bay into a fucking spammy advertisement center for your other torrents."
,timleary,2009-08-21T07:05Z,Seriously fuck your torrents. They are screwing up the search. I searched for this specific movie and I have to sift through all your other bullshit. Fuck you.
