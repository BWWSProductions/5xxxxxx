Turnaround - Westlife (Back) [2003]
	

Turnaround was the fifth album by Irish boy band Westlife and it was released on 24 November 2003.

The first single released was the upbeat track, "Hey Whatever". The song is essentially a cover of Irish rock band Relish's Rainbow Zephyr but with a slightly changed set of lyrics and a different song title.

The next single was a cover of the Barry Manilow hit, "Mandy". The band's version was an instant hit, earning them their 12th UK number one and an Irish record of the year award.

"Obvious", an original song, was the third and final single released from this album.

"Turnaround" was the last album to feature former band member Bryan McFadden.

The album was the 23rd best selling of 2003 in the UK.
