As I came to power peacefully, so shall I keep it. That is my contract with my people and my commitment to God.
Cory Aquino, 1933-2009


Akoâ€™y nagpapasalamat sa inyong lahat at lalong-lalo na sa Panginoong Diyos, na ginawa niya akong isang Pilipino. Talagang karangalan ko iyon, na maging katulad niyo at maraming salamat sa lahat ng tulong na ibinigay niyo sa akin.

(I am very thankful to you and especially to God Almighty that He made me a Filipino. It is really an honor, to be in the same race as you, and thank you for all aid and help you gave to me.)

â€”Cory Aquino, September 3, 2008
