AIC still fucking great!"
,chorse27,2009-08-30T19:59Z,anybody know where i can get the whole album?
,fuzzypig,2009-09-04T06:01Z,"AIC! Man, I saw them 6 times in '92/'93 with Layne still out front, killer act! Jerry Cantrell still one of the most original rock guitarists ever!

There is a dodgy copy of the album trying to get seeded out there on other boards, it's a malware scam, avoid it!"
,frogs_snails,2009-09-04T12:32Z,"No album released as of yet, just the single."
