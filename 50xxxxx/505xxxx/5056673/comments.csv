,memo_juentes,2009-12-18T03:54Z,"hey i have an original starcraft cd but when i try to play online with this expansion it says that theres a problem with my cd key, i think thats because my key was made for my starcraft (no expansion) cd and not for a broodwar one. so every time i try to access battlenet it pops up that message and is not even letting me log in into my account.

is there a way to play on battlenet??"

its called choas launcher. it runs it in windowed mode."
,altamash,2010-12-11T16:05Z,using chaos launcher fixes the color issue but the windowed mode is too small and double mode lags the game. And opening the screen resolution page or personalize page in windows 7 doesnt seem to fix the color issue for me.
,altamash,2010-12-11T16:18Z,"nvr mind found the solution. for 32bit (X86) pc, copy the following in notepad and save as colorfix.reg. Then double click this file to add to registry and it should fix the color problem.

Add this:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00



[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DirectDraw\Compatibility\Starcraft116]

""Flags""=hex:00,08,00,00

""Name""=""Starcraft.exe""

,saintpaul,2011-01-09T07:47Z,i'll be dnmed.. opening the Screen Resolution panel in W7 solves the color issue.
,Mitzos,2011-01-14T04:22Z,"SOLUTION FOR RUNNING UNDER WINDOWS 7

Download Affinity.exe (game doesn't like dual core)
create a Starcraft.bat (create a *.txt and rename it to *.bat)
put the affinity.exe and the Starcraft.bat in your Starcraft folder (in this example i will use C:\Starcraft)
type the following text into the Starcraft.bat file:

affinity starcraft.exe (If your starcraft.exe has another name, you have to rename this entry too of course)

Start the game with the *.bat file

tested under win 7 64x

taskkill /f /IM explorer.exe
StarCraft.exe
pause
start explorer.exe 

then go to file then save as then rename it StarCraftStartup.bat and set the save type to all files and congrats you just made your first batch file be proud ;D put that in the starcraft No install folder and make a shortcut of it for your desktop it will play full screen with no problems after you exit there will be DOS command window open but just press any key and that will vanish :)"
