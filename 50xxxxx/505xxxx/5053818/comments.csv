,cncfrost,2009-08-15T18:32Z,I have Neogamma r7 and have been getting dvd error 1101 lately. Will this help?..Any help please.
,inAcrysis,2009-08-15T21:25Z,"Hey up Victory. I'm still on 3.2e & was 'thinking' of upping to 4.x but still VERY unsure.
Been on wiibrew forum & been advised to install Bootmii - backup NAND - update to 4.1 - backup NAND - install & use dop-IOS on all IOS's to trucha bug them. at least I think that's what they were getting at? not too sure. 
Does any of this make any sense to you mate?
ANY help appreciated."

Yes this can help ....
If you get an error at the installation precess..then you have to use Trucha Bug Restorer (done by WiiPower)..then install this !

Hello ...
If you will use the SD Channel Menu, transfer channel to SD etc ...So you can upgrade. If not I do not recommend to upgrade for 4.x ...

Upgrade :
1. BootMii as Bootv2 (Optional)
1.a Backup Nand 
1.b Save the Nand's Backup on computer...
2. Upgrade from Wii Servers ..From menu option.
3. Install this cIOS. If cant > Use Trucha Bug Restore
4. Patch IOS60 if you will transfer channels to SD (Optional)

If you like give me your Live Messenger !"
,inAcrysis,2009-08-17T02:51Z,"Thanks for reply. If I don't update to 4.x then is it worth just installing Bootmii & backing up the nand?
I've got no real reason to update really. Just want to be able to use bigger than 2gb SD cards.
Also would like to be able to save my save games like Mario Kart won't save to SD but read that you can save it on 4.x. is this true?
v-coke@hotmail.co.uk but not on messenger :-( not got time! "
[T],victory144,2009-08-18T04:57Z,Ok ..ill contact you !
,inAcrysis,2009-09-04T10:37Z," Quick question - why does it say wad file? I got a dol file. Is that the installer? But where is the IOS38-64-v3610.wad? It says exact same in the readme. Also, is this for 4.1 or 3.2 or any firmware?

HOW TO INSTALL IT ]:

  WAD Installation:

- Copy ""IOS38-64-v3610.wad"" file to the root of a SD card.
- Insert the SD card on your Wii.
- Run the installer and select ""WAD Installation"".


  Network Installation:

- Run the installer and select ""Network Installation"".

This just contain the .dol installer ... if you want to install that without Internet you must search or create that wad with ""NUSD"" (Simple PC Program that can download and pack wad) ...if you have Internet in the console > You must select Network Installation ..and it will download the necessary files from NUS automatically ...

Good Luck..."
,ShahrukhDX,2009-11-13T12:46Z,"1. yo sorry for the stupid question. will this make my new super mario bros. wii stop coming up with the error 002.

2. where do the files go. whats the layout."
,WGC,2009-11-21T00:22Z,"I installed the IOS38-64-v3610.wad and ran the cios38 rev installer. It code dumped and didnt work.

4.1E ios 249"
,WGC,2009-11-21T01:01Z,"CORRECTION:
After I obtained the IOS38-64-v3610.wad from google then was able to instal Rev 14 via homebrew however I think the rev 14 I used came from either
thepiratebay.org/torrent/5053818/cIOS38_Rev14_Custom_IOS_38_(_For_DVD_USB_Loader_)_[Victory]
or here .. 
thepiratebay.org/torrent/5169866/How_to_play_New_Super_Mario_Bros._Wii 

 I put them both on my SD and tried them after the IOS38-64-v3610.wad was installed
 Rev 14 installed via homebrew where previously it had failed due to annoying ios249 .
 New Mario now loads in without green screening on a scrubbed version if the USB stick is in the port nearest the edge (as instructed) with no fiddling on neogamer/usb loader.
  THANKS!"
,flantratten,2010-05-02T18:02Z,Hello there! I just ordered a nintendo wii and saw this torrent so i was thinking: Can i play games on my wii with an external HDD (USB 2.x) if i use this program? I'm totally new to nintendo wii programs and flash so i really wanna know this before i do it on my wii.. I'm very grateful for any answer i get
,flantratten,2010-05-02T18:43Z,"i downloaded one of your other torrent's: ""SD USB Loader v1.5 Run Wii Games From USB or SD [Victory]"" & i guess that's the one i need to be able to boot from a USB HDD so all i wanna know now is: Nothing at all :P Thanks for the other torrent anyways. You rock!"
