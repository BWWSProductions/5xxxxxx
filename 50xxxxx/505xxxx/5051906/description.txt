This is the soundtrack CD for an old PC game called "Myth: The Fallen Lords" by Bungie.  This game was popular long before they were acquired by Microsoft and long before the "Halo" series of games.  If you enjoyed the game, or ambient/newage music in general, you'll probably dig this.

This soundtrack CD was available from the Bungie website while the Myth games were popular, but is no longer available anywhere.  It is very much out of print and a rare find.  Enjoy!

Music by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori.  1997.
