,arkhanrj,2011-05-16T19:35Z,do you have subs for the russian parts??
,MrCyberdude,2011-06-12T12:51Z,"For the English subtitles these had the same internal titles so they should be in sync, the wording also looks correct.

,flamegreenthroats,2011-12-16T01:48Z,"The subtitles mentioned at http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3666677/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy-en don't have text for the parts in Czech. I'm assuming they don't have the Russian as well, but I haven't watched that far yet. Has anyone located subtitles for the non-English portions of the series?"
