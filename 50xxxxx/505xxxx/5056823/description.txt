Nelson Demille
The Gold Coast

Welcome to the fabled Gold Coast, that stretch on the North Shore of Long Island that once held the greatest concentration of wealth and power in America. Here two men are destined for an explosive collision: 
John Sutter, Wall Street lawyer, holding fast to a fading aristocratic legacy; and Frank Bellarosa, the Mafia don who seizes his piece of the staid and unprepared Gold Coast like a latter-day barbarian chief and draws Sutter and his regally beautiful wife, Susan, into his violent world. Told from Sutter's sardonic-and often hilarious-point of view, and laced with sexual passion and suspense, "The Gold Coast" is Nelson DeMille's acclaimed story of friendship and seduction, love and betrayal.

NELSON DeMILLE is the author of fourteen acclaimed novels. including the "New York Times" bestsellers "Night Fall", "Plum Island", "Wild Fire", "The Lion's Game", "The Gold Coast" and "The General's Daughter".
