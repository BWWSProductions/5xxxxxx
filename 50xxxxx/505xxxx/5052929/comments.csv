Have a nice day! :)"
,ShomanKnig,2009-08-16T16:18Z,"Oops, i've allready uploaded 25Gb (mistaken, because first seeded with KTorrent, then switched to utorrent with it's' superseed feature).
Ok, seeding for 10.0, then stop. :)"
,ShomanKnig,2009-08-16T16:22Z,"And, almost forgot, if you do not plan to share/seed this to ratio >=2.0 (more is better ;)), please do not download - you are wasting my bandwidth and my time.
Cheers! ;)"
,artemon85,2009-08-17T09:24Z,"Seed, please, come back!!!"
,ShomanKnig,2009-08-17T12:44Z,"@Seed, please, come back!!!@
Looks like this torrent is dead - nobody wants to seed. Almost everyone (9 out of 10) d/load and get off, churlish people. I'll seed a little, to help finish your downloads, maybe will switch down speed to 20KBps, cutting people with low %, but i promise nothing."
,artemon85,2009-08-20T18:24Z,"Only 800 megs left, please? I`ll seed till ratio 10!!!"
