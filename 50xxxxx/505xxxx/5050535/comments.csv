,oliepwnz,2010-05-26T06:51Z,Just to clarify for most stuff i download i never usually go below 700kB/s. Im at like 10 right now... :(
,classic-only,2010-06-21T23:25Z,"Very good quality...The audio issue with the first ep is just mono vs stereo and a lot quieter. Unless there is something else being said in the other channel, you aren't missing a thing. Just turn up the volume, lol."
,kwgtha,2010-10-17T14:58Z,most of this doesnt play there is only a few eps that actually play
,HellsGayngel,2010-11-17T17:21Z,Might be that you don't have the right codecs. Download VLC Media Player. http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
