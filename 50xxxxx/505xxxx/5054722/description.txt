Chapter 11: Input Devices
Exam Objectives
Identifying common input devices 

Defining input device terms, concepts, and functions 

Cleaning and caring for input devices 

Troubleshooting common symptoms and problems 

Input devices are included on the A+ Core Hardware exam primarily under installing, configuring, and upgrading field-replaceable modules (FRMs). You may also run into preventive maintenance and troubleshooting questions about input devices. Donâ€™t expect to find many questions like â€œHow many keys are on the keyboard?â€ or â€œHow does a mouse work?â€ The keyboard and mouse, the major input devices, are essentially throwaway technology. Itâ€™s a lot cheaper, in terms of both labor and parts, to simply replace a problem keyboard or mouse with a new module than to waste the time needed to repair one.

I canâ€™t quote statistics as proof (and I looked for them), but I bet that after power problems (â€œIt worked fine this morning before the power failureâ€) and printer problems (â€œWhat does online mean?â€), the most common service problem involves a keyboard (â€œI spilled my Mountain Dew on it and for some reason it stopped workingâ€) or mouse (â€œThe foot pedal doesnâ€™t seem to work anymoreâ€). If Iâ€™m right, and I canâ€™t be too wrong on this, then as a certified PC repair technician, you should understand how input devices work, connect, and fail. You especially need to know how to plug in the replacement unit.
