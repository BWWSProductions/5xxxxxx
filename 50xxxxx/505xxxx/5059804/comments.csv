,strawberryJAMM,2009-08-21T07:20Z,"@The Soft Touch: No, it's correctly identified as the eight episode of the first season because the first episode was a two hour pilot and is thus identified as the first two one-hour episodes.

In other words, the first show was both S01E01 and S01E02, making this, the seventh show, S01E08."
