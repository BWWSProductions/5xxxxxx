After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

John Renbourn is an English guitarist and songwriter. He is possibly best known for his collaboration with guitarist Bert Jansch as well as his work with the folk group Pentangle, although he maintained a solo career both before, during and after that band's existence (1967-1973).

While most commonly labelled a folk musician, Renbourn's musical tastes and interests take in early music, classical music, blues and world music.
