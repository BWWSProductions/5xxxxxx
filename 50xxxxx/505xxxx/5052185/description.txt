Unconventional Warfare Area of Operations (UWAO) JAZZ."

Urban Assault
"A coalition convoy was raided and the cargo was stolen. It has

Technical Notes
=======================================================

********************************************
** IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SERVER HOSTS/ADMINS **
********************************************

NOTE: The cooperative missions will take significantly more CPU resources to run during normal gameplay
due to the additional AI processing load (shared between the server & client). Server hosts planning to run
Co-Op servers should plan accordingly. In addition, players running a Co-Op server and client on the same
machine will experience heavy CPU demand.

It is recommended that server rotations switch only from Co-Op level to Co-Op level, or MP to MP level for
best performance.
