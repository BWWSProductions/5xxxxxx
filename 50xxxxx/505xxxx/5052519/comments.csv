,ricardo000,2009-08-17T19:05Z,PLEASE SEED!!!
,spacey123,2009-08-20T22:41Z,"The original seeder seems to be slow and only around for part of the day.  It was going to take weeks if not months to download this torrent at that rate.

So, I went and found all of the this torrent's files from other source torrents.  I then imported them into this torrent.  Now I'm seeding.  I've got a slow upload, but at least I'm around 24/7 so it should help out."

,chatting,2010-01-25T23:42Z,I WOULD LOVE TO WATCH THIS SERIES.....IF ONLY PEOPLE WOULD SEED.......PLEASE
,AnotherStranger,2010-05-28T18:07Z,"Beware - the quality is CRAP, at least on season 1 (US TV rip), won't even bother with season 2.

Thankfully I found a high quality UK TV rip of season 1 elsewhere, not possible to post any links here but it's currently no 4 on Google ;)"
,AnotherStranger,2010-05-28T20:46Z,Better get this DVD-rip of season 1: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5049978/Mad_Men_S01_Complete_DVDRiP_XviD
