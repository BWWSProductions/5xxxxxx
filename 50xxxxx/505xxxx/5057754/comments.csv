Thanks again."

TTrie donpcs x2 a ndfou ntha tt hein -gamet ex ts

Not sure if it's because of the emulator or not. Did anyone has encountered this before?"
,OnePiecePirate,2012-03-24T20:09Z,Oops! I was gonna say: Has any of you encountered this before? That was funny...
,OnePiecePirate,2012-03-28T15:29Z,Tested it with a different emulator and it worked perfectly! I hope it does the same with my ps2 though.
