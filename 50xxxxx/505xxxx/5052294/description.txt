Fraser Island, World Heritage listed natural wonder - is the world's largest sand island, with the purest fresh water lakes in the world, the only tropical rainforest that grows on sand, and the purest dingoes (Asian wolf).

Once described as paradise, Fraser Island has been riddled with controversy over the protection of its natural resources. This documentary follows the battles the island has faced in a journey that has made it one of Queensland's greatest icons.
