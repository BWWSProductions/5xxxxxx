Unique double album by Isao Tomita, released only in Japan, never on CD as far 
as I know. He deconstructs his musical pieces down to individual sounds to demonstrate how he makes his music. 

Included are high-res scans of a seven page booklet that features writing 
(in Japanese) and diagrams of his working methods -- in the hope that some kind
and intrepid soul out there might translate and post it somewhere, someday...

Enjoy!
