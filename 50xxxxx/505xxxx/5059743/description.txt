RELEASE NOTES

Wolfenstein brings the Nazis dark obsession with the occult to life
with epic action and harrowing shooter combat. Use a powerful arsenal
of both definitive and occult-enhanced Axis & Allied weapons to beat
back a supernatural Nazi force that is full of surprises. You play as
BJ Blazkowicz, a highly decorated member of the Office of Secret
Actions (OSA). You are sent on a special mission into the heart of the
Reich to investigate evidence that the Nazis may possess a new and
mysterious power. While behind enemy lines, you discover the Nazis
have done much more than develop a new toy. The Nazis are harnessing
the power of the Black Sun through a dark parallel dimension called
The Veil; in order to create a weapon of war-ending mass destruction.
You are the only one that can stop them and save the world from their
perverse domination.
