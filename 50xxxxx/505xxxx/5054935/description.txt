Get Some is the debut album of Snot. Released on May 27, 1997, it is the only album to feature original vocalist Lynn Strait, who was killed in a car accident on December 11, 1998 when a truck struck his car, killing him and his boxer, Dobbs.[1][2] In his review of the album, Allmusic's Chris Slawecki wrote "even with production guidance by T-Ray (who has worked with Helmet and House of Pain), most of the music on Get Some is not quite as memorable as that name."[3]
