but the video quality is not as good as the other versions out. 

The uploader asked in a reply post if anyone skilled can use his english subs and attach them to a better quality video like the one here. the title of his upload is ""District 9 English Audio/Subtitles[MKV][400MB]"". check it out on warez .One of you that knows how to do this can be the first with eng subs.

There are none for some of the human (which really doesnt matter) and a few lines are missing for the aliens.  Also some of the subtitles lay over the russian ones making it hard to see.  As for the movie, I thought it was pretty damn good, I liked the racial undertone.  I'd recommend seeing it in theaters if I didn't think they were extremely overly priced."

,Zenman1976,2009-08-18T16:51Z,"Demonoid should be holding open invite sessions soon (I think they will be on Friday's) so keep your eyes open if your seeking an account. 

I mean what with all the spamming assholes on here you aint got much chance of someone sending you an invite code, it just aint worth the risk. Also, on Demonoid if you leech/flame/troll too much then the person who sent you the invite code can potentially be banned also. 

Its a shame there is no real function for people to club together to rid TPB of these spamming parasites and trolling scum. After all they have the top100 function here which is simply fantastic (demonoid should take note) 

I'm almost risking sounding like a spammer myself but I just someone could take this site and demonoid then combine the best of both. It would truly rule the cyberwaves. 

At least over there spammers and fake uploaders actually do get banned. They also have what is by and large a much more respectful community. 

Peace to all decent torrenteers and uploaders."

Very nice, thanks.

YOU are a DUMBASS.  This has bad FLICKER for most of the movie, making it excruciating to watch.  Maybe you're watching on your iPod..? Anything bigger than that, the flicker will induce a siezure. "
,michaelrwatson,2009-08-20T22:30Z,"Btw:  Kingdom/Secretmyth, crap like this IS NOT APPRECIATED. All you do is waste everyone's bandwidth and cheapen what is probably a really good move. "

,MJLC09,2009-08-25T15:20Z,"the version on hilkoo . com is much better, its streamed but you can download it free. quick before it gets taken down"
,wayneking,2009-08-25T20:04Z,"Watchable cam, not as bad as some are making out at all imho.  

I'd say about Audio 7 and Video 7 FOR A CAM!  So watchable at worst.  However there are only Russian subs, whicg ain't so helpful for the Alien language translation.  Still watchable, but better to wait for a version with English subs imo."
,Tumzoli,2009-08-28T21:03Z,This is the best film to have come from south africa? Ive seen the trailer and it looks brilliant i think im going to pay the price at the cinema! the whole cinamatic atmosphere will really make it good i think
,BILL6HESS,2009-08-30T09:27Z,"A GREAT MOVIE! worth seeing in theaters, but also i had to have it on my comp, i couldnt get the alien subs to work though... i went to the site everone has been posting... any help would be greatly appriciated, thanks secret so much anyways! "
,almostaquad,2009-09-01T02:26Z,I am disappointed. I downloaded this movie 4 times before I found a copy with English subs for the aliens. Still disappointed I thought that would make it a better movie. It didn't!
