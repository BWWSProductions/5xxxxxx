Half Life 2 for linux.
To play just Extract the archive to a random directory on your hard drive and run hl2.exe in Wine or Crossover.
I have tested the game in Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04, runs well with the free and proprietary Ati Radeon drivers.
If you have trouble starting it, disable Wine`s pixel shading support and all should be well.
Enjoy =)
