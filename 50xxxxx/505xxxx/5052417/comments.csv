Half life-Change Game-Counter Strike?"
,Disinfo,2009-08-15T06:41Z,"I havent tested this, not sure if it contains counter strike, but you can download counter strike seperately and add it to the HL2 folder, it should work (also episode 1 and 2 should be possible to be added this way)"
,Pepino14,2010-01-26T05:02Z,"This does not work! 

You'll get the message: 

""(...) 'hl2.exe_hl2' missing!""

when running hl2.exe with wine."
