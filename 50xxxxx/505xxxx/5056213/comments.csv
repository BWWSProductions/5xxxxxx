Common, Use descriptions! 

Good upload though."
,dirtyfucklad22,2009-08-17T15:25Z,"PLEASE RESEED!!!

everybody seeding this torrent only have about 5% of it!  "
,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-08-18T09:19Z,"Alas, I too am stuck at 5% - so somebody please seed this..."
,ras_yo,2009-08-18T18:50Z,"seems to be a fake, No seeder with the complete file around"
,mac.the.ripper,2009-08-19T14:15Z,"Still 113 stupid macintosh leechers on this fake torrent. The actual Sibelius 6 app is only 106 Mb. Do u really belive that the upgrade + crack weights inn at 4.6 gigabyte ?????.

Fuckin Anonymous motherfucker....

LOL"
,mac.the.ripper,2009-08-20T01:36Z,"....110 leechers still on this fake torrent....? 
Sibelius is 106 MB - this torrent is 4.78 GIB.
DonÂ´t u read the comments?????
"
,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-08-21T09:37Z,"mac.the.ripper - you are not as clever as you think - while there is clearly no-one seeding this torrent, if you read the description it says Sibelius + Update - presumably the reason it's 4.6GB is because it's an iso image of the Hybrid install DVD - although we'll never know if nobody seeds this...
I do have this iso from another source, and can upload it if anyone's interested..."
,mac.the.ripper,2009-08-21T11:32Z,"Fine TGDraka. Your clever than me. I have downloaded Sibelius 6 from sibelius.com and the real app is only 106 Megabyte.

So, please explain why this fake torrent is 4.79 Gb?"
,thongkrus,2010-02-07T18:44Z,"mac.the.ripper...this is 4.78gb  because this is the full iso image of the program which includes versions for mac and pc at 2.4 gb each. Now you might ask again why 2.4 gb when sibeius.com has the program just for 108 mb? that's because you've downloaded just the demo version which don't save files. and the demo version doesn't include all the add ons and features... such as sound essentials, scorch or photoscore lite etc...so if you think this file is too big for you then just use the demo version from sibelius.com. Just be thankful someone has uploaded this very useful program."
,djmatsa,2010-02-10T13:49Z,ALL THE LEECHERS ARE STUCK ON 16.8%... 
,N0B0d7kn0Ze,2010-04-30T06:19Z,"This torrent cannot be downloaded.

I'm getting the following error message:

""Stopped [The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect]

???????? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ????????"
,andkja,2010-07-12T21:14Z,"Tarkus1975: I followed your instructions (tnx!) but seemed to have a problem with running the program. I get an error and a message which says something like: \""you have to run sibelius as administrator the first time\"" or something. can you help me? or anyone else?...."
,doniemac,2010-07-16T23:36Z,"doesn\'t work for me either. same message. all the torrents for this program for mac are the same. if anybody knows a way around this, I\'d really appreciate it."
,Adamcyk,2010-10-07T05:05Z,does anyone seeding ?   please~~~
,MPuppets,2011-06-23T17:42Z,"I downloaded in 4 hours, great seeding!
But I followed the instructions and it just dont work. I installed, I replaced the Sibeliu file in the package content with the one provided and it just doesnt open or anything. Can somebody help me?"
,MPuppets,2011-06-23T18:11Z,"FOR MAC:

OK dudes this works like a DREAM, with photoscore, with audioscore!
BUT: this crack isn't working, my computer doesn't recognize the delivered Sibelius 6 file as an executing document. But you can solve that problem by downloading this crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5072492/Sibelius_6.0.1_Upgrade_and_Crack.zip
which works perfectly. You first have to install sibelius, than you replace the file. Afterwards you update and you install the photoscore and audioscore and than you'll have to replace the file AGAIN!

Njoy!"
