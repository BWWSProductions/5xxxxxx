I am pretty sure that whoever has the movie rights to this lame, boring, repetitive, derivative soap opera is attempting to use TPB as a free viral advertising source (did they check with their lawyers?) for their upcoming project
And if you are advertising for a company affiliated with the MPAA, make sure to deduct the ad fee from that suck-ass lawsuit meant to hobble a superior distribution service. We will not buy your overpriced plastic disks anymore, and if we enjoy your art we will show it with to our neighbours. Drop in on Johnny Depp and Tim Burton at one of their mansions and ask how much time they spend in dvd rental stores. Oh yeah, spammers and ad scum eat rat crotch."
,Lechesia,2009-08-24T04:03Z,Otto-Did you write this on Ed's torrents too?  What is it...you don't want upload anything to TPB?  What org are you with?  Why would you care if it was whatever you said?
,Lechesia,2009-08-24T04:23Z,Let me rephase that comment.  Don't you want torrents uploaded to TPB?  
,LadyIzce,2009-08-24T07:35Z,Leshesia ignore him hes one of those people who has no life and nothing better to do than insult people and hes not worth the time or effort to ask him anything
,Lechesia,2009-09-06T09:36Z,I agree with you LadyIzce.  I will add more DK soon.
,zywiecbear,2009-10-06T21:04Z,"A lot of us are stuck on 90 odd percent, and have been for ages. So I have uploaded an alternative (seeded) vol 14 - and also vol 12, so everything up to the end of vol 14 is intact.

What happenned? Did everyone get invites to Demonoid and then not bother to keep up the good cause here on TPB?

Thanks Lechesia. Its a shame your efforts were rewarded only by Otto's weirdness. Hope you're not put off."
,Nansidhe,2009-10-14T00:12Z,"I have 95% downloaded and I am seeding what I have, but can someone please seed the final 5% for me--I usually seed at least 100 times over when I'm done, I'll do the same here for anyone else who needs it.  Thank you."
,skzb,2009-10-15T12:32Z,"I'm also at 95%, and also seeding what I have.  Is there anything I can do to get the remainder?"
,LiterateDead,2009-12-24T03:59Z,"Merry Christmas, all you DS fans!

I found a finished version of this volume, and am uploading it as we speak. Christmas miracles do happen, even for vampires... or witches, if you prefer Angelique ;)"
