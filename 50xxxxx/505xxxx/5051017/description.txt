A very rare masterpiece never on CD ! 

Some amazing solo piano music from criminally underrated jazz giant Hampton Hawes.  We'll try to remedy this with this vinyl rip offering that for some mysterious reason never made it to CD. 

Although it does not say it anywhere on this LP (originally recorded in Japan for RCA), the "challenge" was that this was Hampton Hawes' first set of unaccompanied piano solos.  Although based in bop, Hawes was always much more than a one-handed pianist, and he proves up to the challenge.  The repertoire includes jazz standards, three originals, and the current pop tune "Who Can I Turn To."  Throughout the date, the pianist shows that he could create stirring music without the assistance of a rhythm section. Unfortunately, this music (last put out on a Storyville LP) has yet to be reissued on CD. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide
