,mattydv,2011-06-14T00:30Z,"Glitchy video, still watchable but annoying. Good quality sound + resolution."
,lord.thom,2011-08-18T11:18Z,"When I mount the image, it refuses to run like a normal DVD - I can only open one video clip at a time, without the whole 'interactive' menu.

Does anyone know how to fix this??"
,lord.thom,2011-08-18T11:40Z,"Hang on, don't worry - I worked it out. You just have to open the VIDEO_TS.ifo file, and the whole interactive thing works. Now I feel like an idiot haha!

Good quality, but a little glitchy in parts. Great upload, thanks!"
