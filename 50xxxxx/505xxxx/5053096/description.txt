Note: Enjoy this in True HD 720p Xvid in 5.1 sound that can be streamed or played on Xbox 360 or PS3and some newer upscaling DVD players. We love the new BR (Xvid) rips that are out, but don't like how they make them 720x400...So We have been making our own in ture HD.We wanted the great sound and video that comes with BR, and keep the higher video size.So here is our version, Check out sample and decide for yourself!Half Baked (1998) BRRip XvidHD 720p-NPW
