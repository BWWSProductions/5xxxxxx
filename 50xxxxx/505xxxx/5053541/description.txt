Corruption was rampant in the Royal Hong Kong Police Force before the establishment of ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption) in 1974. It is believed that between 1963 and 1973, the money that went into policemen pockets through bribery amounted to HK$10 billion, which translates to roughly HK$500 billion in 2009 value! Prolific filmmaker Wong Jing's new drama film about the birth of ICAC, ironically titled I Corrupt All Cops, has five years of research and development put into it, making it a realistic portrayal of that era while also packing a dramatic punch. In the film, Wong Jing directs a star-studded cast that includes Tony Leung Ka Fai, Anthony Wong, Eason Chan, Alex Fong, Bowie Lam, Kate Tsui, Liu Yang, Natalie Meng, recently crowned Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actress Paw Hee Ching, and Wong Jing himself. Powerful Chief Inspector Lak (Tony Leung) and his cohorts Lun (Anthony Wong), Gau (Eason Chan), and Chu (Wong Jing) have practically turned half of Hong Kong into their corruption empire. This prompts the Hong Kong Governor to set up an anti-corruption arm to fight them. Idealistic university graduate Han (Alex Fong) joins the newly formed ICAC headed by Yim (Bowie Lam), and their war against corruption will prove decisive for the fate of Hong Kong.
