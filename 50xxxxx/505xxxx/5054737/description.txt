Challenge to Rome

I retired voluntarily, gladly, from the priesthood of
Rome, after a vain attempt, in combination with other
priests, to secure a reform of Humanistic abuses from
within (see "Romanism A Menace to the Nation"). This
failing, no other course was open but to quit the accursed
System forever.

I will give TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS to any person
who can prove that I was EXCOMMUNICATED and that the
STATEMENTS and CHARGES against priests, prelates, and
popes, in my books, "THE POPE-CHIEF OF WHITE
SLAVERS, HIGH PRIEST OF INTRIGUE," and
"ROMANISM A MENACE TO THE NATION," are
untrue; and, furthermore, I will agree to hand over the
plates of these books and stop their publication forever.
Will Rome accept this Challenge?
If not, Why not?

JEREMIAH J. CROWLEY,
A ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST FOR TWENTY-ONE YEARS,
AUTHOR, LECTURER, AND PUBLICIST.

The obstinate refusal of Rome, for several
years, to accept my challenge, is proof, positive
and irrefutable, that its cowardly, wine-soaked,
Venus-worshipping, and grafting prelates, priests
and editors have no other reply for adversary,
but vituperation and assassination.
