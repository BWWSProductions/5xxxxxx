Eurotika is a Channel 4 (UK) documentary series on European exploitation cinema. 

During the 1960s and 1970s, European low-budget films went kinky, emerging as a new type of cinema that blended eroticism, surrealism, horror, and over-the-top atmospherics. 

This series covers European exploitation cinema and sexploitation before the introduction of home video. It has profiles of JesÃºs Franco, JosÃ© Larraz, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jean Rollin, Walerian Borowczyk and Jose BÃ©nazÃ©raf.
