,pgirl04,2009-08-17T09:15Z,"Argh, please don't stop seeding after d/l! And btw, don't buy those spam comments. I'm 99.9999% sure this file is *fine*. I wouldn't d/l it if I didn't think so. The ""notv"" part of the file name just means it's formatted for comps not tv's; I have all previous 8 files on my HD right now, same extension. All great quality both sound and vid. 

I will update (promise!) if I *ever* get it d/l (12 peers right now?!? really?!?)..."
