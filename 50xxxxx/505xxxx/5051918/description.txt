Once they lock the bar up they start dropping like flies. They soon notice though that not everything is what it seems and not all people are who you think they are.

OC Babes and the Slasher of Zombietown is a low budget horror/comedy that is full of horror pop culture. the film is intercut with George Romero's Night of the Living Dead to help tell the story. This movie is an exercise is low-budget film making in that it was shot in less than 24 hours. It is good, old-fashioned exploitation film making at its finest.
