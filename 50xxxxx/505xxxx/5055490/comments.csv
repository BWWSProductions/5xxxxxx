,aeonfast,2009-08-16T02:06Z,Why is everyone downloading this? I even dont know what game it is and i didnt found something of it on Google. So why is it so polulair?
,iampko33,2009-08-16T08:50Z,"yahoooooo here it finally comes.

...it is not well known beacause of lack of ad..."
,wehat,2009-08-16T21:08Z,"MASTER.DAT not found.

Even after I've pointed it to C:\FALLOUT\master.dat in the config. Oh well."
,blyfoten_,2009-08-17T01:20Z,you need the Fallout2 master.dat not the first I guess
,GriwMF,2009-08-17T14:07Z,"Also do not forget to connect DAT files from original Fallout 2 (copy them to client's folder or select their location in configuration utility FOConfig.exe) and to copy music in folder client\data\sound\music.

,greyres,2009-08-21T00:03Z,"to play thus you need install original F2 and copy master.dat and critter.dat from there into the client directory.
well...looks like Fallout...acts like Fallout...sounds like Fallout. We should supose it's Fallout =)
have a nice travel and be prepared to meet numerous PK's..."
,SegFaultOfDoom,2009-09-01T03:58Z,"Hate to say it, but right now it is garbage. 

COmbat doesn't feel like original fallout, there is no balance at all, game has ridiculously long timeouts for simple actions. 

It doesn't even feel like ""beta"", more like ""alpha"".

Making fallout online is a great idea, but right now implementation is horrible and I can't think about any reasonable excuse for that."

,De_loused,2009-12-15T05:42Z,"Aeonfast... It is not a game it is an Independent adaptation of Fallout 1 and 2 into a MMORPG. Using the old game engine and some feature from Fallout tactics engine...

It is the most rude and harsh MMORPG i've ever played... People just have no mercy xD

This is actually the 3rd time I emoragequit and delete it and then re-download it lol"
,De_loused,2009-12-15T05:46Z,the trick is to stay in the wasteland until you reach level 8 or 10 xD Avoid Cities and poulation... Live like a hermit
,cocainecripin,2010-02-01T16:17Z,"hahaha u dumb fuck u dont know what fallout is? where the fuck have u people been living the past 15 years? fuckin kids

,lareth,2010-04-23T06:16Z,"I've lost my fallout cd's somewhere, will a torrent copy of fallout 2 work if I cant find em? All I need is the master and critter files of the original right?"
