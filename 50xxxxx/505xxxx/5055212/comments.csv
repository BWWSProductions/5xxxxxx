,BobbyLaurel,2009-08-27T20:57Z,Wow! I was looking for this series! Thank you!
,Pastafarian101,2009-09-02T15:48Z,Thank you so much for this :)
,ball_head,2009-10-07T22:59Z,"i was skeptical of watching this as it's almost 30 years old and science is moving forth with great pace, but it's really a testament to Carl Sagan that it's still very watchable and has aged ""like a fine wine"" so-to-speak, as he presents the science so brilliantly along with a plethora of fantastic artwork and animations.  *Absolutely* worth the download if you were wondering :)  I'd never heard of Sagan before i watched this, and was saddened to hear he died at only 62 :(  Thanks for the upload!"
,dropit987,2009-12-08T03:46Z,Is there anything special I have to do to download this? I'm getting less than 3-4kb/s. Usually I get at least 100 or more. I'm not even sure anything is downloading at the moment because it isn't getting any pieces.
,dropit987,2009-12-08T03:48Z,"Nevermind I got it. For some reason the magnet link wasn't giving utorrent any of the file names so there was nothing for it to download. Also ty uploader, CARL SAGAN ROCKS!"
,australopithecus,2010-01-03T14:05Z,Great serie. Thanks.
,australopithecus,2010-01-03T14:06Z,Great. Thanks!
,australopithecus,2010-01-09T15:01Z,"@Zardes:

Drop the subtitle file into video directory and then rename it as the name of chapter.

Regards,"
