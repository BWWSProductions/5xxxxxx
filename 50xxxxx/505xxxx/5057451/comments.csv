,krspies,2010-02-01T00:56Z,I just downloaded it so I'll let you know if it's safe.
,krspies,2010-02-01T01:03Z,wow! I love this.  This one worked like a charm.  It's safe to download and the serial # is included.  You don't even have to mount an ISO with this torrent.  Good job Busaho. Thanks for the torrent.

,CherokeePlaza,2010-12-01T21:44Z,"Does ANYONE know where I could find some good reference/how-to books for DAZ Studio?  Whenever I download new software, I always try to find a good assortment of books to help me learn it.  I've never had any problems finding at least a couple, but I haven't found the first one for DAZ Studio.  Any ideas?"
