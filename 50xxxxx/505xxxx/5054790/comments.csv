,kithylin,2009-11-21T22:51Z,"Nothing needs to be ""restricted"" to 4 gigs any more, 99% of people use windows vista or 7 and thus use NTFS. I've downloaded several this week that are over 12gb, not a hassle and if it means better quality and bitrate, then Yay for quality, size is irrelevant!"
,enritnt,2009-12-29T00:47Z,"read the descriptions before posting, it clearly states that this file is meant for playback on PS3 consoles, and it only take FAT32 external HDs, Thats the reason, if you where encoding for PC use you can go as big as you like (altough anithing over 3gigs per hour is overkill) so yes sometimes quality suffers a little because of size limitation but  you have to agree that putting over a hundred full HD movies in a single 500gigs xternal HD, and have them ALL available whenever you want at the push if a button is extremely convenient"
