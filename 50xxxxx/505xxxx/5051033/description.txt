About the Film

WIDE ANGLE gains intimate access to the Havana Boxing Academy on the outskirts of Cubaâ€™s capital. There, from the tender age of nine, boys hand-picked as future Olympians are molded into soldiers of the ring. They live and train at the academy with a single purpose: to bring home Olympic gold. Victory Is Your Duty follows the boysâ€™ dramatic path over eight months of training, schooling and boarding as they build up to the biggest event of their lives â€” the annual National Boxing Championships.

For the summer 2009 re-broadcast, WIDE ANGLE host Aaron Brown travels to Miami, Florida, to tell the story of what happens when graduates of Havanaâ€™s boxing academies grow up â€“ and defect to the United States. The boxers tell of the triumphs and obstacles they faced in Cuba and continue to face as they pursue a professional career in the rough-and-tumble world of American boxing.

This episode of WIDE ANGLE is the U.S. television version of the theatrical film Sons of Cuba.
