GUNS AND BUTTER radio show with BONNIE FAULKNER
2009.05.27 interview with Dmitry Orlov
Guns and Butter - "The Collapse Gap"

MP3, 57.27 minutes

"The Collapse Gap" with Dmitry Orlov, author of "Reinventing Collapse - The Soviet Example and American Prospects". Dmitry Orlov's repeated travels to Russia throughout the early nineties allowed him to observe the aftermath of the Soviet collapse first-hand. Being both a Russian and an American, Dmitry was able to appreciate both the differences and the similarities between the two superpowers. Eventually he came to the conclusion that the United States is going the way of the Soviet Union.  His emphasis is on all the things that can still be made to work, and he advocates simply ignoring all that will fall by the wayside.
