   - Summary -

   Planetary Emergency is an environmental documentary that raises awareness 
   to Earth's deteriorating condition caused by harmful human lifestyles, and 
   explains how lifestyle changes such as converting to a vegan diet is
   urgently needed to effectively reverse climate change and improve living 
   conditions on our planet.

   Interviews with many prominent politicians, scientists, professors, etc. 
   bring about environmental perspective to the viewer.


   In addition to exploring the environmental causes and preventative measures
   that can be taken, the author also explores the topic of animal cruelty, 
   and explains how being compassionate towards animals brings an 
   interconnected benefit to the environment as well. Footage of various farm 
   animals is shown, portraying shocking yet standard and common factory farm 
   conditions. This gives motivation to go vegan not only for the environment,
   but also to help end unnecessary suffering. Health benefits are also 
   presented.

   Gary L. Francione
     |.. Professor of Law, Rutgers University Law School, USA, Author & vegan.
         Pioneer of the modern 'abolitionist' movement, philosopher, anti-PETA
         crusader, philosophical advocate of his self-proclaimed "Abolitionist
         Approach" which effectively divides animal rights groups into those 
         who support tactics that are pure and limited (ie, trying 
         quixotically to lawfully end the property status of animals) to those
         that are effective and understandably (to most people) compromising, 
         (ie, naked peta protest campaigns that catch peoples' attention yet 
         come at the cost of subjectifying women in an anti-feminist manner).
 
         The incremental approach Francione preaches in his writings does not 
         involve compromise, therefore is not really incremental but rather 
         preaches to a more receptive animal liberation organisation, than a 
         divided collective animal rights organisation.
         Francione remains controversial and may effectively encourage some 
         animal rights activists to engage in more extreme (animal liberation) 
         approaches, given an uncompromising and therefore arguably unbalanced
         position.
