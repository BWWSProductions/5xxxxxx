Anyway, enough of the excuses. I will have another torrent uploaded this weekend for you all. Please continue to download and share these torrents. We are definitely living in interesting times. I, for one believe that we are living in truly historic times. Things are changing and people are waking up to what is going on around them. This time in history will be remembered! For what, I believe that is up to us all! Search for the truth in everything, especially yourselves. Coast to Coast will help us all along our individual paths of evolution. Wake up, the paradigm is changing!"
