,mikeeee62,2009-08-18T14:19Z,is it just dts
,BOMM2,2009-08-20T01:21Z,"Thank You for sharing!

Audio is not dts, it is AC3/6 EN (Dolby Surround).
2 audio tracks: English and English descriptive for blind people.
If you strip the descriptive audio track & the Blu-ray commercials & the FBI Warnings & two of the subtitles, then it will fit on a DVD5 without transcoding the video. ;-)"
