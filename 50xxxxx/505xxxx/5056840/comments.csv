Why didn't you include the dwg files?  This torrent is a dime a dozen because for some reason I haven't yet figured out, the masses want to torrent this without the critical dwg files.  

With the dwg files this would be pure gold and exceptional.  Without them, this is nothing but BS.  It's the same with Finkelstein's Autocad Bible.  You can't use it unless you got the exercise files.  Or maybe you can but the dl is extremely devalued.  

Both the Mastering Autocad and Autocad Bible 2010 series are non-existent as far as the PDF and the dwg files together.  In '11 you might want to keep that in mind. 

Why do countless people like you torrent this without the dwg files?"
,BloFish,2010-03-16T18:28Z,"@Lutefisker  till you start uploading torrents you have no right to criticize anyone that does ULed!

@malestrom I thank you deeply for your Ups. Your ULs have broaden my horizons and left me with the desire to absorb all the knowledge there is to have. Again I thank you. (makes me think your an American) hahahaha (pun intended, just a joke peeps)"
