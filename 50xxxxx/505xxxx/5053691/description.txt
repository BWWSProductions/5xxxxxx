Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine is an adventure game created by Himalaya Studios for the PC. It utilizes hand-painted backgrounds and pre-rendered 3D character animation frames. The game is designed to be a homage to the classic Sierra and Lucasarts style point and click classic adventure games of the 1980s and 1990s.

This game is the first original and commercial game created by Himalaya Studios, although the same team is also responsible for designing the King's Quest 1 and 2 remakes at AGD Interactive, and drew upon this experience to create Al Emmo. The game runs on the popular Adventure Game Studio engine, and shows off some of the engine's more versatile features such as fully lipsynched dialogue portraits and its ability to handle complex animations. The plot is based loosely around a well-known legend in Arizona, the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine. 

"Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine" is a classic-style graphical adventure game for the PC. In pursuit of unrequited love and inconceivable fortune, a feeble, middle-aged easterner named Al Emmo embarks on a perilous journey into the untamed desert valley of Anozira. Unprepared for the harsh elements (and even harsher residents) that await him, Al's only respite comes in the form of a beautiful local woman, Rita Peralto, who is also the object of every other man's affections. Al soon discovers that Rita is inexplicably linked to a centuries-old mystery involving an ancient gold mine--the location of which has been lost to the ages! There are also rumours of a horrific curse lingering within the mine's dank depths, waiting to lay claim to any mortal foolish enough to venture inside in search of its riches... 

With imaginative and memorable characters, laugh-out-loud dialogue, a captivating storyline, and a breathtaking illustrated world, "Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine" will enchant anyone longing for an adventure game reminiscent of the celebrated classics of yesteryear. We hope you enjoy it!
