The story focuses primarily on the efforts of Starfleet to acquire the three orbs of the Pah-wraiths, which could potentially be used as powerful weapons of apocalyptic scale. In doing so, they are competing against the Cult of the Pah-wraiths, Prophet-following fanatics, a rogue Cardassian anti-Dominion group, and the Dominion itself.

The game can be played from the perspectives of Sisko, Kira or Worf.
