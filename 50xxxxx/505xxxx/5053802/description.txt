Blowup (as shown in the screen credits, also rendered as Blow-Up on promotional and packaging materials) is a 1966 British-Italian film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, that director's first English language film. It tells the story of a photographer's accidental and incidental involvement with a murder. The film was inspired by the 1959 short story "Las babas del diablo" (i.e. "The devil's drool/drivel") by Argentinian writer Julio CortÃ¡zar[1], and by the work, habits, and mannerisms of Swinging London photographer David Bailey. The film was scored by jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, although the music is mimetic as it is played on a record by the main character. Nominated for several awards at the Cannes Film Festival, Blowup won the Grand Prix.
