IMDb Description.....: After their wedding, newspaper writers John and Jennifer Grogan move to Florida. In an attempt to stall Jennifer's "biological clock", John gives her a puppy. While the puppy Marley grows into a 100 pound dog, he loses none of his puppy energy or rambunctiousness. Meanwhile, Marley gains no self-discipline. Marley's antics give John rich material for his newspaper column. As the Grogans mature and have children of their own, Marley continues to test everyone's patience by acting like the world's most impulsive dog.

Any dog lover will both laugh and cry with this film.  That's basically all you have to say for this flick.  Based on the best-selling novel by John Grogan, which is in fact ... better than the film, this movie is about a couple who have never owned a dog and all the things that go wrong.  The novel is based on true events and the film is based on the novel, so I'd guess the film has a GLIMMER of the truth in it, but mostly it's just a great film to sit down and laugh at.

For trivia fans ... here are the two bits of trivia I actually know about this film:
1.  Owen Wilson's real parents play his parents
2.  John Grogan (the book's author) is in the Dog Training Class scene ... he's the guy with the Cocker Spaniel.
