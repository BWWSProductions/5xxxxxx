The is the 4th disc of a 6 disc limited edition set. I have scanned the cover which is the same for front and back of the box and this is contained in the first disc torrent. I have omitted the 80 page book that is included with the set because it would take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad enough then buy the box set. This set is a combination of the soundtrack and follow up album with the exception Ten Years After and Rock and Soul Music by Country Joe and the Fish.

Pease note that some of these tracks were unissued and some are complete versions that were unissued.

If you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.

Please help seed these torrents. Enjoy.
