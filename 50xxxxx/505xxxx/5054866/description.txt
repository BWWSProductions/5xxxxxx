This is the new studio album from Marty & Elayne of the Dresden Room in LA.  They were featured in the movie Swingers. http://www.thedresden.com/lounge.html 

The torrent has the new Album "if you believe" plus Stayin' Alive that I recorded on my iPhone while I was at the Dresden.

Also Song Tags were hand typed and song 22 doesn't have a listing on the CD case so it's just track 22.  

Ripped with iTunes.

Enjoy
