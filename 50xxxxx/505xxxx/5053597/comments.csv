Mr Jones turned out to be Omaha for an example."

Wonderful torrent and all.  I can confirm that ""Mr. Jones"" from ""August and Everything After"" is actually ""Omaha,"" while ""Omaha"" from ""Films About Ghosts"" is actually ""Mrs. Potter's Lullaby.""

For ""August and Everything After Deluxe,"" Banshee on Ubuntu didn't pick up the CD set tags (i.e. they weren't separated as CD1, CD2).  

Again, wonderful job (as usual), keep em coming."
,disimagery2,2009-12-25T10:09Z,cd1 for August and everything after is NOT right- wrong tracks and yet tracks are labeled as if it were the real thing??? wazzup wid dis ere ting yo pakistan!
,disimagery2,2009-12-25T10:14Z,"dude, really!  should redo this- their 1st and most remembered album you screwed up?
all the tracks are mixed around and mislabled and wrong and just f*KK'd!!!
shame on you for not fixin this sooner!"
,NoWayy,2010-01-08T01:33Z,Thanks for the torrent but if you don't feel like renaming most of the songs don't download this one!
,r3tr0,2010-03-03T10:58Z,"You, good sir, are a saint.  I have lots of this on CD from the past, oh, two decades or so?  This saves me lots of time, just click and walk away versus standing there while the computer does all sorts of stupidity to burn each album separately.  My wife will thank you more than I do even.  And my processor will be angry with you for the next week probably.  Bardzo dzekuje."
,AngryNucleus,2010-04-29T20:05Z,August and Everything After Disc 1 is actually just This Desert Life again.  Super bummer.
,brianboyle,2010-05-21T13:59Z,"Nah .. can't be doin wi this ... 
I only wanted to download certain tracks .. upon downloading them, they were completely different tracks ???  ... that was a waste of time with ma very low bandwidth ... 

Shoddy job mate ... cant beleive this counting crows torrent has most seeders .. its also the worst ...."

,KAG8893,2011-03-15T02:24Z,yeah pretty much all the ID3 tags are fucked up. usually you have no problems but this one is no good.
