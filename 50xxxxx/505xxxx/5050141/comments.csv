,Neuro_Belmont,2009-08-13T10:58Z,Also been waiting impatiently for this. You're the first. You seem to be reputable and so this should work. Will comment once finished.
,AugustusXXII,2009-08-13T11:36Z,pls do
,AugustusXXII,2009-08-13T11:39Z,"btw, is this a remake of Return to castle Wolfenstein from 7-8 years ago?"
,ninjanutta,2009-08-13T13:45Z,"Yes it works,no its not a remake, new game and the first hour ive played seems like its gonna rock,unplug live connection as it fails stealth at the moment"
[M],chkin,2009-08-13T15:11Z,"Sorry, but unplugging Xbox 360 won't help because the console scans the SS/DMI/PFI sectors, stores them to NVRAM and sends them to Live when you connect.

This release should work but it hasn't been verified by ABGX because the game isn't officially released yet"
,lam4747,2009-08-13T17:47Z,"There is no proof that the 360 saves said information to the nvram then sends it to Microsoft when you connect to live.
It is simply a theory. 
You should not state such things as fact. Though it is of course sensible not to go on live at all if you have used the game before the launch date.

Anyway. Thanks for the upload. "

Is this true? Weird.. I've been downloading pretty much ALL the games only caring about if they work in the single player. Never played ANY live matches with the xbox 360. Only go to live to download patches, gamedemo's and Live Arcade games (that, yes, I pay for. Sam 'n' Max Save the world, Monkey Island, Bionic Commando Rearmed.. etc. all the golden games :)) and I've yet to be banned. 

I mean yeah, I know about the ""ban waves"" but there's already been several of those in the news and I'm still kicking. 

If it'd send the info of all the illegal discs that's been in my drive, I'd be 100% busted. 

Maybe it'll hit me one of these days while fetching an update or so. (I only go to live like once a month or so.. if a game ""needs"" a patch) 

I wonder, if I was to get banned, where would I get my gameupdates/patches?

I do have another xbox 360 in the household, but switching my HDD to that one in order to upload patches really wouldn't work since the burnt discs that I need the patches for, wouldn't play. And I couldn't download XBLA games to play with my modded box, coz the license would stay on the non modded box if I dload it with that one...

Man, microsoft sure knows how to make this tricky.

I better not be banned man. I have like 30 BOUGHT games, 120gb harddrive, 4 controllers 2 xbox 360 consoles and even the fucking extra fan that sounds like a jet engine in the middle of a typhoon. I've paid my share and now I'm enjoying some ""backups"".. I think I've deserved it. 

You know and there's one weird thing about your theory.. If they only ban the console each time, not the gamerprofile or the harddrive(d'uh), how come it'd store all the ""banning evidence"" on a HDD that can be moved around from a console to console? Couldn't it ban an un-modded console from live, if the HDD had the info of the illegal games on it? OR would it just register my illegal console banned from the HDD that's connected to an un-modded console, leaving the un-modded one totally unharmed...?

Oh well, won't be playing this on live anyway. 

And thanks for the warning.. I didn't know it stores actual disc info to the HDD for banning purposes... damn that's bastardly. :("
,Sarkasmi,2009-08-14T08:05Z,"Oh yeah and to back up "" I've paid my share and now I'm enjoying some ""backups"".. I think I've deserved it."" - I still gotta say;

The straw that broke the camels back was the third time my Xbox 360 broke down. 10 minutes in GTA4. 

Man that sucked. Waited for the game for SO LONG and Red Ring of Death after just 10 minutes of playing it.
Got pissed off. Marched in the store. Bought another 360. Played GTA4 all I wanted.

My broken 360 arrived... they said they replaced it with a new one, but it was still an old console. Just another one. 

So I firmware flashed my DVD drive, bought some DL discs and told microsoft; If you piss in my eye, I'll piss in yours :D 

They're so still winning, though. :|"
,Neuro_Belmont,2009-08-14T08:30Z,"^ Cool story, bro."
,xgodmode,2009-08-14T10:40Z,Horrible game. Just finished playing a few multiplayer matches and lets just say im not too impressed... Just another generic shooter. I wouldnt bother.
[M],chkin,2009-08-14T13:05Z,"Storing sectors to NVRAM (not HDD) was said to be part of the NXE update, which was released 2008-11-19. The previous ban wave was on November 2008. (and before that, November 2007)

Until this game is officially released and this .iso confirmed by ABGX360, I'm not putting the disk anywhere near my console.

And yes, I'm not sure if anyone has any proof of that ""theory"" or not, but I don't really care. I won't underestimate Microsoft's evilness. Play this release all you want, just don't tell me I didn't warn you.

And thanks to Morck22 for the release, the speeds are nice"
[M],chkin,2009-08-14T17:20Z,Update: Verified by ABGX
,alex_maurya,2009-08-14T23:54Z,Could somebody please write something about how the game is?
,lam4747,2009-08-15T13:24Z,"I thought the game was awful. Its like COD3 with some super natural elements.
It looks very rough. Game play is very dull and for me is just a big disappointment.
"
,Vader--,2009-08-15T17:22Z,"I use the NME 2 chip and have 0 coasters and o Problems all around. I have 1 360 unmodded for live play and the other 360 for modded play- BUT NOT ONLINE!!
 Anyway , everywhere I read , you people who have modified your firmware, your questions, your fears, your problems, screw ups and so on, are repeated and repeated and repeated!

Don't be a DUMBASS!! 
get NME 2 and a second box.

Meanwhile I will keep on laughing at all the funny shit you keep putting yourselves through.   LOL."
,vik071,2009-08-15T20:38Z,"@Vader

How 'bout you shut your pie hole and crawl back under the rock you came from, you slimy little bastard?"
,Neuro_Belmont,2009-08-16T05:48Z,"Don't listen to the haters. I think it's very enjoyable. The controls are tight, and it feels like a classic FPS. Definitely better than those crappy Resistance games, and other FPS IMO. I don't know about online since I don't ever go online with my 360."
,ninjanutta,2009-08-16T06:55Z," unconfirmed theories,about banning and mod chips etc......if u worry about a ban dont flash the box and people with mod chips have been banned too so its all just luck of the draw.Everyones a fucking expert NOT!!!!!!!Oh yeah loads of peole with unmodded x360s get banned aswell so work that out.By the way this game is good if you like fps than you will enjoy this.also abgx verifies stealth and did from day1 so i dont think you have to worry anyway!!I didnt....  "
,ninjanutta,2009-08-16T06:59Z,OH yeah vader what u gonna do if you xbox redrings? or worse? you cant send it to M.S for repair with a chip soldered on u dipshit!!! whos laughing now dumbass!
,Bjorkved,2009-08-16T12:02Z,Thanks for the upload!
,thegamer80,2009-08-16T17:59Z,"The game is not bad but it stops saving the process after several missions. this makes the game unplayable because no matter how much you play it doesnt save
if anyone can help me out here or has a solution for this (((game does show the saving checkpoint, saving game,, etc but it doesnt save)))"
,thegamer80,2009-08-16T20:25Z,I found the problem. Thank u uploader
,qumahlin,2009-08-17T06:02Z,"@thegamer80

That sounds like either your save game is corrupt or something is wrong with the HD.  I'm almost finished the game and it has saved fine the whole way throughout."
,thegamer80,2009-08-17T16:50Z,"qumahlin
you could be right about the HD but gladly the problem wasn?t so serious. My console date wasn?t set correctly. Once I changed the settings to 2009 I was able to save the progress. Now I have completed around 51% of the game:)"
,WeD@,2009-08-17T18:00Z,When is pc version due ?
,patraikos,2009-08-18T08:36Z,"Have played the multiplayer version on Pc, the game sucks dick, hope it fails just like quake wars

all of you expecting something related to the gold old enemy territory, you will get disappointed."
,ShineEyes,2009-08-18T18:19Z,"I know this is verified on abgx, but when I check it with the program it can't verify stealth :-\ I don't want to burn this and have it not work.  Anyone else get this issue?"
,Neuro_Belmont,2009-08-19T12:55Z,"The game is so far scoring an average of 8/10 from 7 different reviews so far. An 8 is pretty good, so don't listen to the trolls who are spouting crap.

,lDunKs,2009-10-08T17:42Z,VADER-- you're an idiot.  Why are you so proud of having to spend 80 bucks for a modchip and another 200 for a second xbox just to play burnt games?... 
,Vader--,2009-11-13T17:20Z,"Thanks morck22 I finally finished 5 games this week and this was one-good game.

And to Idunks, vik071 and ninjanutta- the 3 of you are obviously Poor, stupid and Ignorant, did I mention STUPID omg... I bet Right now you are all banned from LIVE.....lololololololololol..not me....wonder why dumbasses- because I am not stupid,poor or ignorant and what I said is what a smart modder would have done....Have fun catching up with your second box for live and none of your ripped saved game data that is now corrupt.
I hear a white one is going for $199.99...lol
just ask for IDunks.!"
,Bujaaa,2009-11-23T20:08Z,vader: why don't you just go and fuck yourself you little spoiled piece of shit!!!
,Bujaaa,2009-11-24T09:39Z,Do you know why Microsoft loves to ban people from xbox live? Because then imbecils with too much money and not much brain ( vader ) go out and buy another XBOX360 and then they buy original games to play on live with unmoded console. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !!!!! Ohhhh..... yeeesssss vader.... yusa smart.... yusa sure showed Microsoft  who is the boss! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !!!!! lollollollollollololololololol....motherfucker!!!!!
,Vader--,2010-01-12T04:56Z,"Soooooo, Bujaaa  your in the poor class TFB for you. Just for free though I 'm going to toss you in with the idiots.
 Like I said ....Now the bannees will buy box 2....and they will . They could have done it sooner and kept games saves from being corrupted and kept functionality of the HDD. 
It's a simple lesson learned during xbox 1 

2 BOXES!!!.....lol"
,Vader--,2010-01-12T05:10Z,"IDunks........really man  is this your email?
    thephams91@yahoo.com

Really! then you ask me, why am I so proud of my paultry expense in order to play my 268 -360 titles that ran me $1.25 each.......Hmmm  gee I can't figure it out???....You got balls or diareha of the mouth."
