movie 7"
,acer99,2009-08-18T00:45Z,"The film opens with a documentary-style series of interviews that introduce the situation. Twenty years before, an alien ship is seen coming towards Earth and arrives above Johannesburg, South Africa. It hovers above the city for three months without any contact; eventually humans take the initiative and cut into the ship. They discover a large group of aliens who are malnourished and sick. The aliens are later assessed as apparently being all ""workers"", with their leadership mysteriously missing (it is hypothesized that a plague may have wiped out all of the leadership-caste). Grainy footage shows part of the ship (supposed to be a command module) falling to Earth, but nobody has been able to find it, leaving the ship inoperable.

The creatures, called ""prawns"" as a derogatory reference to the sea creature which they resemble, are housed in a government camp. The alien race's true name is never learned they are primarily referred to as ""prawns"" or, more rarely, ""non-humans"". Overcrowding and militarization eventually turn the area into a slum known as District 9. A massive black market is set up between the aliens and a group of Nigerians primarily led by Mumbo, a paralyzed warlord. In addition to inter-species prostitution, the Nigerians exchange canned cat food for alien weapons, of which the cat food has a similar effect to catnip on the aliens.

The movie takes place in 2010. Patience over the alien situation has run out and control over them has been contracted to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company that shows little regard for the aliens' welfare. MNU is interested in using the aliens' advanced weaponry, but its integration with alien biology makes it useless for humans.

An MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), is set with a task to move 1.8 million aliens to a new District 10 camp located 240 km from Johannesburg, with help from private security forces working for MNU. While inspecting a suspicious alien residence, Wikus handles an alien device which squirts a dark liquid into his face. He becomes very sick and collects the device as evidence.

A rapid transformation begins to occur, and shortly after exposure to the liquid, Wikus's left arm mutates into a claw exactly like that of a prawn. After collapsing at a surprise party in his house, and a doctor at a local hospital discovers his alien left arm, Wikus is taken into custody and a series of tests and experiments are performed on him; these reveal that his alien DNA allows him to operate alien weapons. The scientists discover that his DNA is currently ""in balance"" with the alien DNA, which is gradually taking over. They decide to harvest his body for biological material at this critical point, to have the greatest chance of replicating his ability to use alien technology in other humans later. To reduce any side-effects, no anesthetic was used. However, during the attempted vivisection Wikus escapes after overpowering his captors, and flees from MNU.

Wikus seeks refuge in the run-down shack of an alien called Christopher Johnson, the same alien who Wikus attempted to evict earlier, who created the alien device that infected Wikus. The device contains fuel that Christopher scavenged from various alien parts scattered around District 9. It is hinted that Christopher might be a surviving member of the prawn leadership caste, as he shows much more knowledge of how alien technology works, possesses or at least found the command module, and interacts with MNU officials more articulately than other aliens. Although initially hostile towards Wikus, Christopher eventually agrees to help him reverse the transformation if Wikus will retrieve the fuel from MNU labs. Christopher promises to undo the mutation by getting Wikus aboard the mother ship hovering over Johannesburg, and shows Wikus the ship's command module, which has been hidden under his shack.

Wikus steals some alien weaponry from Mumbo and his gang, with Mumbo vowing to capture Wikus and eat his mutated arm (his witch doctor believes this will"

Okay if we wanted a summary of the movie we would Google it. Actually you can't even call that a summary. It's like you're trying to describe the movie to a blind person that's sitting next to you. If you want people to read your review/summary/useless shit, try putting it on a site for movie reviews/retarded niggers and not on a torrent site. "

,wontgetfooledagain1,2009-08-20T07:17Z,"^GGF's takeover will send TPB straight into the shitter. Here's how:

1: The people who actually bother paying for music/movies/porn/games/other shit already use things like the iTunes store and Amazon.com, where files are downloaded that have been pre-approved by the copyright holders and are guaranteed to not contain viruses or ripping errors. How could TPB compete with them while still keeping the RIAA satisfied with cash?

2: You don't need a fucking PhD to figure out that the TPB community that keeps the site alive likes getting their stuff for free. And the uploaders? Well, the uploaders might just decide to jump ship after they realize that the RIAA WILL NEED TO APPROVE OF EVERY TORRENT UPPED BEFORE IT IS POSTED. Think about it...the RIAA might just decide to track your ass down and rape you with the cock of copyright if you try to up something they don't approve of...say, a leaked album.

3: The RIAA will eventually notice that the whole deal really isn't worth it and pull out their ultimate weapon...DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING. Yep, that's right...the final solution. Which they will totally have the power to do under GGF's rule.

4: The TPB will slowly fade into obscurity and internet oblivion.

The above video details illegal surveillance and optical torture hardware technology actively being used by the Canadian Government on innocent citizens with no criminal history or association. Really cool stuff.

This is an entire section of wall in a home office that has been replaced with one that contains sophisticated black (not commercially available) surveillance technology.

The domestic police and intelligence agencies use quasi-private secrecy legislation to circumvent the criminal code of Canada and human rights treaties to violate the rights of net active citizens.

Don't be fooled. There is a high probability, if an intelligent individual that your residence or office is similarly modified by your local goons.

Yet they have one huge mothership who took them another 20 years to operate.20 years. wow. What a pathetic attempt for Hollywood to come up with a new fresh idea.

1) The link in the top of the description, the supposed DvDRip, can you provide a link to the actual Pirate Bay listing of the torrent, and not just the torrent file? After a few minutes of downloading, it returns a tracker error and refers me to some weird site. My settings are correct.

2) Will you please stop putting all your torrents in the description. It messes with the search engine, and it is actually keyword spamming. If people want to download more shit from you, they can click on your name."

For a cam, I'd give this;

V - 8/10 (very watchable)
A - 9/10 (voices are of amazing quality despite the booming in some parts)

Thanks extremezone. :)"
