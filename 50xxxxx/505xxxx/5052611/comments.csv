,ninjanutta,2009-08-14T14:17Z,Ive got the dev tools
,ninjanutta,2009-08-14T14:21Z,"Those emulators were not meant to be leaked or the dev tools,,this could bring uneccesary heat to the hacking scene...i will respect the authors wishes until then..this uploader should of too."
,snatchuro,2009-08-14T18:45Z,"is it possible to upload the dev tools?

Thx"
,qumahlin,2009-08-15T01:47Z,"MS isn't really going to care because in order for the upcoming ""hack"" to even work you need to use an older version of Dashboard and will be unable to use Xbox live...

So yeah, if you want to trade xbox live, for running linux on your xbox this is good shit.  Otherwise its pretty much useless unless your a developer who wants to use the 360 as a middleware box."
,mdlp,2009-08-16T17:00Z,I'd trade Live to be able to use homebrew any day of the week. 
,abletonlive05,2009-08-23T06:11Z,"you know if your boy puts it down then your boy puts it down, im looking for that fatal but deadly beta of splinter cell convinction, but back when you lads were puppies people did this crap with genesis and all kinds of other systems. i have a 360, my pc probably would not run any of these."
,Sundive101,2009-08-24T04:26Z,"I find this ironic doesn't any one else?

It's okay for us to rip a company's work.  But when it comes to a fellow pirate, that's where we draw the line?  Give me a break."

,kleptoscope,2009-11-19T23:48Z,"hi guys..i'm hoping you can shed some light on something for me. I'm looking for an emulator for pc that plays 360 games....i'm not interested in live or any of that, i just really wanna play halo 3.. as it's exclusive to 360, i'm stumped, i dont want to buy a console just for that one measly game...i have a pretty hectic rig, 9800GTX tri-sli, 16GB 1333MHz ram, Q9550 CPU...so i definately have the power...do these emulate 360 games on pc? i've been seeing threads about this coding never gonna happen, but they are OLD ass threads...so was wondering if anyone can help? a link perhaps? a download? i know nothing about 360's, but i do know a little about pcs...any help would be nice:) thanks, here's an email i've just openned:

I'm not much into game, but find the details are excellent...."

I hate to tell you but you dont have the power.
What you  have there would just BARELY emulate a PS2's hardware.

Just an FYI for future reference, it takes 10x more CPU to emulate what you want.

35mhz SNES needed 350mhz for example
XBOX1 needed like, 1.5ghz with dual core for smooth play
What makes you think that ""not even top end machine"" will emulate a 360 even above 2-3 FPS?

Your video card is pure shit ""3 way sli means nothing 90% of the time, upgrade to something better"", your CPU is junk. 1.3ghz memory on that cpu is only getting choked on your fronst side bus btw, and isnt being read/write at that speed.

,omniTed,2011-08-06T02:27Z,Anyone knows how these files work? How to load them onto the computer? What's the use of uploading these files without a set of instructions:P If anyone can give me a tip here and there that would be great. Cheers
,MiniHP,2011-09-12T00:11Z,is this too play xbox 360games on USB?
,d.lee,2011-09-20T04:16Z,@samljer quit being a fuckin hater.  i cant stand dickheads who go off on people that just ask a question.  dont be a fukin douchebag and just give an answer that not laced with insults.  its easy to be hard on a PC. people have lives believe it or not and dont have time to read about computer hardware all day. get a fucking life you loser.
,azuziel,2011-09-23T23:46Z,"@qumahlin 

You're a meatbag. You don't need to run an older dashboard with the new hack, that's the whole &*^ing point!! Go read about the reset hack, and then take your head out of your ass and stop spreading BS. "
,nna2,2011-10-11T04:15Z,@d.lee its kinda funny that he has no clue wtf he's talking about either lol

There are no xbox360 emulators to date, but two guys are working on them so lets hold our thumbs :)"
