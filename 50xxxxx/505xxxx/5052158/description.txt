"'Fallin' For You" is a song by the American pop singer-songwriter Colbie Caillat from her upcoming sophomore album "Breakthrough" set for August 25 release. The song was released in June 29, 2009 in the United States.

The song is a pop-ballad and was written by Caillat and Rick Nowels, and was produced by Nowels, John Shanks, and Ken Caillat.

Caillat explained to Elle that the song is â€œabout falling for a guy I was friends with. We went out on a date and I realized that there was no one else in the room. The room was silent, and I was on this high from it the next day and wrote this song.â€ 

The song debuted at #12 and was Caillat's highest debut ever on the Billboard Hot 100, the hot shot debut of the week and her best song on the U.S. charts since her debut single Bubbly. With 118,000 first-week downloads, it's also her first top 10 on the Hot Digital Songs chart since debut single "Bubbly" peaked at No. 4 in November 2007. However, it fell to #35 in its second week. On the Canadian Hot 100, the song was the hot shot of the week, debuting at #55.
