Rome has won the day, the Huns have been massacred and Attila has been defeated at the hands of the Roman girl Flavia Aetia. However, for fear of having to face the Gods that may reside within Flavia and Attila, the Roman emperor has thrown them into the very heart of the sun. But if they are gods, will even this fate destroy them? In this critical moment, Flavia and Attila will discover the truth about their pasts and the manipulations of those who made them gods will be revealed. Only now does the size and scope of the conspiracy to destroy the galactic Roman Empire finally come into focus.
