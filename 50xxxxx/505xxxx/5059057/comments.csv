[T],netviper,2009-08-18T06:22Z,I snagged this from usenet. I was suprised to see it out before the low-res version. I'm watching it right now and it's the real deal.

[T],netviper,2009-08-18T06:41Z,"umm if I was asled to download some DRM then how am I watching it on Windows Media Player on Win7? All I have installed is K-lite standard codec pack.

Plays on VLC and WMP without anything asking about DRM. seeding at 2.0MB/s so hopefully someone soon will have a copy and can confirm what I am saying. course there aren't any completed copies yet so I don't see how pax00 can claim DRM"
,Homicidal,2009-08-18T07:18Z,"Just finished downloading and i can confirm that its the real deal, thanks once more netviper :) "
[T],ct420,2009-08-18T08:16Z,confirmed that this is REAL!
[T],ct420,2009-08-18T08:28Z,"pax00:  You are obviously a clueless newb.  It's OK... We were all in that boat once.

If you are using WMP to watch vids, then you will always be frustrated with the codec blues.  Do yourself a favor, and get a GOOD player.  This one is a good choice:  kmplayer - http://kmplayer.en.softonic.com/"
