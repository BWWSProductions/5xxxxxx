Storyline: "The Boat That Rocked" is an ensemble comedy in which the 
romance takes place between the young people of the '60s and pop music. It's about a band of rogue 
DJs that captivated Britain, playing the music that defined a generation and standing up to a government 
that, incomprehensibly, preferred jazz. The Count, a big, brash, American god of the airwaves; Quentin, 
the boss of Radio Rock -- a pirate radio station in the middle of the North Sea that's populated by an 
eclectic crew of rock and roll DJs; Gavin, the greatest DJ in Britain who has just returned from his 
drug tour of America to reclaim his rightful position; Dave, an ironic, intelligent and cruelly funny 
co-broadcaster; and a fearsome British government official out for blood against the drug takers and 
lawbreakers of a once-great nation.
