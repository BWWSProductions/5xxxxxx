Original Title: Black Moon Rising (1986)
IMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090735/

Please, can you be more explicit about
""survivalofmisa.altervista"" ?

Is it a web site? If so, the full url, please! [Google couldn't enlighten me about this, too many unrelated results...]

What is the spoken language? Any subtitles ?

Thank you very much.

Best regards

robs
