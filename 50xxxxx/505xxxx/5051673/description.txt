You might get a message from your firewall asking if you want to allow a "Bon Jour Service" to acccess the internet (mdnsresponder.exe). Installation will stop untill you allow access.

If anyone else has their doubts about this little thing, read more here:

If InDesign freezes or crashes at at start up (at Start Up Service Registry...) search for and delete the folder called "SING" - Located at C:Program FilesCommon FilesAdobe. 
You'll probably have to end the InDesign.exe process first.
(Ctrl+shift+Esc)

If you had previous versions of CS3 installed you need to uninstall these completely and remove EVERY trace of it. This might help you:
