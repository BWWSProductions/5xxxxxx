Death of a Porn Star.

An exploration into the disturbing mystery surrounding the death of international sex icon Lolo Ferrari.

Lolo Ferrari had the biggest breasts in the world and was an international sex icon with a successful film and pop career. But behind the faÃ§ade she was Eve Valois, a young woman with a desperate need for attention.

A tragic end to a tragic life came in March 2000 when Lolo was found dead, apparently of a drugs overdose. Suicide was blamed, but her mother refused to accept the verdict and two years later was granted a second autopsy.

The cause of death was under question; the autopsy suggested she may have died from suffocation. Her husband and manager Eric Vigne (the man responsible for redesigning her face and body) was consequently arrested on suspicion of murder.

Death of a Porn Star features candid interviews with her mother, Catherine, her plastic surgeon, Marc, and her husband, Eric Vigne. It is a story of fame, prostitution, hardcore pornography and, possibly, murder.

Contains nudity and coarse language but no pornographic content.
