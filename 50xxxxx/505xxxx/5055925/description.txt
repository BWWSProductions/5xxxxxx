I could only find a PDF of this book with really long lines, not suitable for reading on a small device. I found the TXT that the PDF was created from, removed the hard line breaks and made a new PDF with shorter lines and a serif font.

I also fixed some few OCR errors in the beginning that I noticed, but there are surely several still in there.
