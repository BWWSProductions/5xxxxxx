Is there a missing file (archive) for auto run?."
[T],neanderthal,2009-12-28T18:55Z,"That's the way the release group released it.  Many CBTs are released without the Autorun files.  For this reason, some people have made GUI creation guides.  

Personally, I think it is easy enough dragging and dropping the videos on my media player.  G o o g l e  Lynda GUI to find a guide."

This is from mid-2009 - Twitter has changed a LOT since then. Still handy videos nonetheless, since a lot of it focuses on the uses and ettiquete of Twitter. Thanks neanderthal. :)"
