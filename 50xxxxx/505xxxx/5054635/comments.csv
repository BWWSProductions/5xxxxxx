[T],bitpirate,2009-08-17T13:16Z,People would it be possible to seed a little bit??
,Uzone,2010-03-19T20:21Z,"I'm downloading this for days and still 31%.

Okay, it's huge. But please SEED. I guess you don't like it either when you try downloading something and if you get over 20 KB/s you call it a miracle.

People, SEED. Downloading and then deleting the torrent doesn't help. Don't do it!"
