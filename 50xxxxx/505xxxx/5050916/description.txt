This is all thirty-seven episodes of the Death Note series, as well as the three movies within the mini-saga.

The episodes are Anime.
The movies
are Live-Action.
* Both have Subtitles, Both are in Japanese.

They are in a DVD-player readable format. Meaning if you were to burn these to a DVD and pop it in any standard DVD player these days, it'd playback immediately, without any hassle. It's in the highest possible audio and visual quality, as if it were played from a legit DVD. Have fun with this fact.

I'd appreciate it if you all were to seed when you finish this so as to help others download such a large file. You should realize that downloading such a large file, and then not helping seed it will kill your ratio and there really won't be much hope of bringing it back up.

Enjoy, yall.
