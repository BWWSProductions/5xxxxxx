However, because this book was intended to be used for 2 semesters of G-Chem, the first half of this book is relatively useless for those students in G-Chem II. And this is where I find myself. I havent taken G-Chem I since high school, something like 5 years ago. If you know where/how to get your hands on the second half, I would be ever-fucking-thankful. Further, if you ripped these PDF.s from the publisher's website (which offers online access to the book for a fee), I would be more than willing to pay the fee and rip it myself in order to supplement your upload for others' benefit. If this is how you got your copy, I would love to know how, so I can do it too. Please reply."
