,De_loused,2009-09-28T17:32Z,"Nice Torrent but i must say I'm a little disapointed :(

Absolutely impossible to get a retail version in a store and it seems like i cant Patch nor Mod this version.

As there are thousands of awesome mods i feel like im missing a bit :D

-Is there a way to patch and MOD this version for more epicness or its impossible cuz its a warez
-IF NO... Does anyone know of a trustable place where i can buy it online and i wont hit the ''depleted stocks'' message
-Is Dominion wars actually worth downloading... i heard you get sick of it after the second mission."
,GhostGMX,2009-09-29T02:16Z,"I'm having the same problem as De_loused.

All the BC downloads seem to be unable to update, and therefore unable to mod."
,darth5ava63,2009-11-04T00:14Z,"guys this is pre patched and to mod bridge commander you need foundation (something this torrent does not have) so before you start bitching about someones hard work and something you got for free spend a few min with google and learn just like i did.

,silverkey131,2009-12-28T02:46Z,"Hi, great game, thanks. :).

I was wondering; can you install Mods onto this version? I'm a little confused as to how they would work since there's no actual install directory or whatever?

Thanks in advance."
