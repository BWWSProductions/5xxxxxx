Britain's comic genius, Stephen Fry, travels around each of America's states in his black London cab in order to discover, in his own inimitable style, what makes the country unique and to get under the skin of American life. 

His journey across the vast country takes him to a whiskey distillery in Kentucky, lava fields in Hawaii, an Amish community in Wisconsin and a brothel in Nevada, as well as hunting in New York State, sailing on an America's Cup boat in Rhode Island, basket weaving with Navajo Indians and meeting environmental activists in Oregon. 

Stephen is shown the country by its proud citizens as he drives across the continent uncovering the idiosyncrasies that makes each state individual and the similarities that make America distinct.
