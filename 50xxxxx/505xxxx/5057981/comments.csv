IĂÂ´m sure your other releases are super duper (since you are one of the chosen skulls), but with this one you failed like hell!

Nothing is slow about my computer, all needed codecs are installed, and VLC is customized for playing vobs.

Ps. A tip if you hesitate downloading entire dvd:s without knowing the quality: Select only ONE of the big vobs, let it download to about 40%. By that time you can open it in VLC and preview short sections, paus and take snapshots. Sometimes VLC shuts down doing so, but go for it again an push the search thingy to other areas."
