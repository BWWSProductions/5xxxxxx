EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Maurice Ager, Shannon Brown and Paul Davis combined for 61 points, and No. 4 Michigan State beat Lake Superior State 107-73 in an exhibition game Monday night.


Ager had 17 of his 21 points as the Spartans took a 63-35 lead. Brown scored 19 of his 20 points, including four 3-pointers, in the first 20 minutes as the Spartans shot 71 percent from the field.

Michigan State, which went 26-7 and reached the Final Four last season, got 20 points from Davis, 16 points and seven assists from Drew Neitzel and a game-high 10 rebounds from Drew Naymick.

Mike Rader was 10-for-14 from the field and had a game-high 24 points for the Lakers, who return just two players from a 9-19 team last season.

The Spartans didn't play anyone more than Ager's 27 minutes. Davis played 22 and Brown just 19 before he was shaken by a blow to the ribs early in the second half.

Michigan State had 26 assists, a 40-22 edge in rebounds and 37 points off turnovers. Running the court at every opportunity, Ager, Brown and Neitzel combined for 16 assists with just three turnovers on the perimeter.

Michigan State will host Northern Michigan, coach Tom Izzo's alma mater, in an exhibition game Saturday night before beginning the regular season at Hawaii on Nov. 19.
