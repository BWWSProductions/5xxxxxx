A parody of the famous TV series, starring Dan Aykroyd as the nephew of LA's most upstanding cop. The new Sergeant Friday tries valiantly to continue his uncle's untiring quest for law and order -- with an emphasis on order. But with wacky hipster Pep Streebek for a partner, that's not so easy. When the mismatched twosome try to crack a case involving a crazed TV evangelist and a slimy porn mogul, law and disorder is the name of the game.
