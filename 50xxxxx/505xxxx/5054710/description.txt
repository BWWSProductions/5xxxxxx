Stargate is a German-American military science fiction film released through
Metroâ€“Goldwynâ€“Mayer (MGM) and Carolco in 1994. Created by Dean Devlin and
Roland Emmerich, the film is the first release in the Stargate franchise. Directed
by Roland Emmerich, the film stars Kurt Russell, James Spader, Jaye Davidson,
John Diehl, Rae Allen and Alexis Cruz. The plot centers around the premise of a
"Stargate", a ring-shaped device that creates a wormhole enabling travel to a
similar device a galaxy away.

Plot

The film begins in 1928, where Professor Langford discovers a massive stone
ring in the sands of Giza, Egypt. In the present day, Langford's daughter
Catherine offers Egyptologist Daniel Jackson the chance to translate Ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs that may prove his controversial theory regarding the
Pyramid of Khufu. Jackson accepts and is taken to a US military installation
inside Creek Mountain, Colorado. Jackson translates the hieroglyphs on the
stone ring's coverstones, which read: "A million years into the sky is Ra, Sun
God. Sealed and buried for all time, his Stargate." Formerly retired Air Force
Colonel Jack O'Neil arrives to take command of the project and declares all
information regarding it classified.

Director's Cut

The Director's Cut had several scenes which were cut from the theatrical film
version. The first such scene took place immediately after the excavation of the
Stargate in 1928 and showed petrified Horus guards near the cover stones; the
producers had tried to introduce the idea that beings had attempted to come
through the Stargate after its burial, but they cut the scene for time concerns
