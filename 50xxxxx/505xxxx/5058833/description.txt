

Swarm Gold v1.0.66 - Complete


Swarm is a space shooter game that relies on quick reflexes
and fancy flying. Your mission is to fly a converted fighter
to retrieve precious EZT cargo behind enemy lines. Retrieve
enough and you will be allowed to offload the cargo and
venture to a new sector in space.

Along the way, collect homing missiles, plasma cannons, and
space mines to help you ward off the Clagnor, an alien race
also after EZT.

While fighting aliens and collecting EZT, you will need to
smoothly maneuver around the rather large space objects that
tend to smash your ship into oblivion.
