Are you having a bad day? Take it out on someone else plz.. I never attacked the uploader. if you read it that way, then you read it wrong.

Personally, I don't mind paying for Snow Leopard when it comes out. But it might be nice to get hands on it a month earlier.

Also, I don't think it is wise to bring in moral and decency as concepts into the ""torrent/warez community"". because there is no way you can actually morally justify piracy. It is merely a consequence of our modern society, and one that would be foolish to refuse taking advantage of for preventional reasons."

Partition 1 - download Snow Leopard disk image here
Partition 2 - restore disk image onto this partition
Partition 3 - partition to install Snow Leopard on 
(Partition 3 is optional, you can install onto Partition 1 if you only have 2 partitions)

Procedure:
1. Boot off partition 1, using Disk Utility, restore the Snow Leopard DVD Disk Image onto partition 2

2. Boot off partition 2 and install Snow Leopard onto partition 3
OR if you only have 2 partitions:
2. Boot off partition 2 and install Snow Leopard onto partition 1

2. opened the ""Mac OS X Install DVD"" which the small partition became

How do I make two new partitions without destroying my current Leopard install?

,cactusleaf,2009-08-14T08:11Z,"@lappe

You could update, but you'd still need 2 partitions.. your main one (currently Leopard) and a small one to mount the .dmg to.. Then install to your main one.

Partitioning is be easy with no risk to your data. Disk Utility has a great non-destructive partitioner built in. Just click the + button under the drive map for your drive, and resize the new partition to anywhere over 7 gig (as long as you do have enough free space to create a new partition with it). Make sure it'll be formatted for Mac OS Extended. It only takes a few minutes to do and requires no restart.

The only problem I had was that some of my 1+ gig files couldn't be moved efficiently by the partitioning program and caused it to think there wasn't enough free space to partition. Before you do it, move your large files onto an external or a flash drive or something, temporarily. "

Sounds to me like you're trying to install onto the same drive you restored the .dmg to. That's the only reason I can think that it would tell you you can't install to that drive. You'd have to install onto a partition on your internal.

When you run the installer and choose a drive with an existing OS X on it, it'll automatically ""update"" it, basically installing over it. No need to choose one or the other.

And yeah your Leopard stuff will be fine. I've had zero issues so far and I've been through like 6 installs of various versions of SL.

@everyone talking about this being GM

It's probably not. These rumors start from like one guy on one Mac site speculating about something, and then within minutes, hundreds of other articles spring up stating ""A source points to this being the Golden Master"" and then ""Several sources..."" but it's all speculation.

According to that article, in the past the GM was released to only a select few Apple employees, a few developers, etc. 10A432 was released to the entire community of developers.

I believe Apple wouldn't be so naive as to let their actual done-deal GM (with, reportedly, a few noticeable bugs) get loose and leak so easily. They're a smarter company than that. We've been duped by rumorists!

OMG stop the presses!! Better contact every Apple news blog in the internets so they can spread your unsubstantiated rumor!!

I'm so pissed that they still haven't written much better drivers, let alone 64-bit drivers, for the GMA X3100 gpu that should be screaming in Snow Leopard for the GUI animations.. which, to my effing chagrin, is still choppy in expose, spaces, etc. And stuck with a 32-bit kernel. F**k. Anyone else notice this?"
,L3ntil,2009-08-15T19:42Z,"im on a mini mac 2009 and its still 32bit kernel though performance is awesome, animations are very smooth, the whole OS is so much slicker amazing how much better performance it is"

,cactusleaf,2009-08-15T20:42Z,"I hear the GMA 950 is far superior to the x3100 due to better drivers! I'm jealous of your bro. What card does your mini have?

I have noticed a big improvement in SL so far in handling the reflective dock and a few other things, and definitely overall performance and quickness. But with the x3100 it's nothing like my old mini was with Tiger, at least for GUI animation. Expose is now actually choppier than Leopard's was."

I'd presume you can install right over it. Every build of Snow Leopard so far has allowed itself to install directly over the last build (and over Leopard also), as an update. This is generally how OS X works.. almost never requires a fresh install."

Thanks for your clarification. However, I have tried all ways (e.g. set nvram, boot.plist, and strip 32 bit  off from mach_kernel) to force it run at k64 but no luck.

If you read or know anything about Apple development, then you would know that Apple doesn't just up and release a revision without testing it with their supported developers first.  Since, 10A435 has not, and won't be released to developers, you can only put two and two together and figure out that it's simply a rumor.  Like all the other rumors out there about extended releases of SL.

You can make SL look like any revision you want with mere effort of opening a text file and changing some numbers.  Not too impressive.  I'm good at Photoshop, too -- want me to give you a 10.7 story?  More so, the official PR news about Aug. 28 release day just goes further in showing that the last stable build (432) will be what is shipped on DVDs.  There is simply no time to run another revision on developers.

Like every release of their OS in the past, you can expect 10.6.1 to roll out on the 28th or within the week to address any remaining issues.  There has already been updates available for this build which were requested by developers.  If it wasn't a final build, it would have been introduced in the next revision instead of a system update catch.  -ciao"

I'm not sure but I can tell you mine isn't downloading either"
,apteryx05,2009-08-27T06:43Z,"I'd gladly give Apple $29 for this, but instead they try to f*ck me for $60 because I live in NZ. This torrent isn't working for me either. Looks like I get to help pay for Steve's liver transplant."

,gunde85,2009-08-27T17:57Z,none of mine torrents are downloading... have they closed all traffic or something like that??
,Dr.Pepper,2009-08-27T18:33Z,All my torrents just died!
,andy72184,2009-08-27T23:24Z,Apple shut it down.  it's been 811/248 for a while now.  But doesn't matter it's all good.
,spankbot,2009-08-28T00:59Z,Apple has no power to shut it down.  Pirate Bay is probably having trouble with it's ISP.
,Lone2000,2009-08-28T08:09Z,"sup pirates, plz instruct me here on how to install. do i need to burn the dmg to a double layer disc? thanks mates."
,xxloverxx,2009-08-28T08:58Z,"@Lone2000, try opening the dmg and look for an 'install' icon or something similar"

,Viking_Fjord,2009-08-29T19:31Z,WOW no one is seedin.....
,hsusgusu,2009-08-30T03:17Z,"While I do admit I have a very fast internet connections and have downloaded torrents like this much faster, there's really no need to complain; it won't do anything. If it's that slow, $25 bucks isn't bad AT ALL.
100 Mbs to go then seeding for a few days.
I am buying this software because I think it's right to support Apple since it's dirt cheap and no shitty activation."
,pcdotc,2009-08-30T23:29Z,Indeed this is pretty pathetic. If you aren't willing to seed at a decent rate then don't bother. I joined the swarm and did what I could for a while but it's not worth the congestion. The OS is a Snow Leopard while folks here are making molasses. Lame.
,kahuna88,2009-08-31T06:57Z,"@n5ane
It reads:
Mac OS X
Version 10.6

@Lone2000
There is a RTF in it explaining how you can install it, and yes a DL DVD will work. If you have an 8gb or bigger flash drive, that also works really well."

finally, can anyone confirm:

1. if this is the gold master ?
2. if this can be upgraded ?
3. how is this usable if apple sells on package for 29 USD good for 2 computers, and a 59 USD for 5 computers."

"" This nor any MAC OS X has expiration dates. It's not like Microshit. ""
I'm downloading this torrent for a friend.
now for a person who is lazy get a MAC and you will enjoy a zero error system.
BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT ! ! !
i prefer PC because it crashes, it get's infections more than the local hocker and i get to manually troubleshoot it.
i can toss around the hardware overclock'm, softmode gpu's, upgrade'm.
in other words ""every day is an adventure"""
,nayalm,2009-09-07T07:11Z,i would like to thank the uploader in advance moucho grasias amigo who ever you are.
,nayalm,2009-09-08T17:56Z,"I burned the .dmg in vista with PoweISO on a DVD+R DL.
I used the lowest spead 2.4X , made clean install on macbook.
now my frind tells me that his battery life jumped from 4.29hours MAX to over 6.30 hours.
the gma X3100 works great,the update works and he kept on going on and on talking about how much he benefited.
In other words IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM.

,andresaic,2009-11-07T22:19Z,"an easy way to burn the snow leopard and make it work on the installation you need a mac and make the .dmg image to .iso and then you'll need to move the .iso to a pc computer, download imgburn and burn the .iso and it will work. You'll need a DVD DL to make it work. :D send me an email.
andresaic@hotmail.com"

,LakeOfSorrow,2010-01-25T02:16Z,"I burned it using Disk Utility but my iMac doesn't even recognize it (it tries to read it for about 3 or 4 times and then it ejects it). The image itself seems ok. What might be the problem and how can I solve it? I'm running Mac OSX 10.5.8 on a 2,66 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2Gb ram. One of the advantages of Snow Leopard is that it uses less space in the HD. If I update from Leopard will it happen or do I have to install it all over again?"
,LakeOfSorrow,2010-01-26T18:15Z,"weird... the dvd I burned from the dmg works perfectly in a MacBook of a friend of mine. I converted this dmg to an iso and burned it using disk utility. Same problem, won't even read it. Nevertheless, it reads any other cd/dvd. Can anyone help me?"
