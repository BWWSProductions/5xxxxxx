 Heading back to the streets where it all began, two men rejoin two women to  
 blast muscle, tuner and exotic cars across Los Angeles and floor through     
 the Mexican desert. When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con   
 Dom Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Connor. But as they are    
 forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an          
 uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And from convoy heists  
 to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find     
 the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the   
 wheel.
