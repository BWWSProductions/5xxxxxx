Something About The Artist N Album:

Finally Out Of P.E. is the debut album on Casablanca Records/Universal Records from Brie Larson, an American singer and actress. The album features 13 tracks, most of then were written by Brie, and focuses on the ups and down of being a teenager.

In an interview, she said

"I think that I write about stuff that others don't write about. I don't have a bunch of love songs cuz I don't really have much boy experience. I just write about what I am actually going through in my real life. That's where the title from my album comes from - Finally out of P.E. My P.E. teacher didn't like me at all, which was hard to deal with cuz I was usually such a teachers' pet. So when I found out I got my record deal, I was like, 'Yes, I'm finally out of P.E.'"
