After three months in a coma, Dr. Amanda Hollins has awakened and is eager to see her only son, John.  He is elated with the news and quickly rushes to his mother's bed-side.  Amanda asks that John visit her old house when she dies in order to terminate her old experiments and close her books.  When she dies he goes there with some friends and uncovers some gruesome scenes, for one of Amanda's most bizarre creations still lives inside the house... and he's not human!

(Note that even though this was ripped off an official DVD, the source appears to be from original VHS.  The picture quality is good considering it's age - this is a rare classic monster movie!)
