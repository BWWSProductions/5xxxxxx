I keep breaking my own word. Vol 70 was supposed to be the last chapter of these series. But again, what the heck? The ship is still sailing and so are we! Here are four more 80s records that I really love. Especially the Simon Byrne record which is pure magic and gold, however very obscure at the same time. In the meantime, I have noticed your requests. I will post those that I have tomorrow, of course if there's a tomorrow for tpb?
