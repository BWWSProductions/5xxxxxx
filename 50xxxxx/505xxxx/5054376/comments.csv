,JettBlack9,2009-08-15T20:27Z,"ONE MORE Question:  DO You have the first album by SORROWS? Teenage Heartbreak?
A really GREAT Power Pop band but I've never seen the first album."
,fanciz,2009-08-15T21:35Z,"Strange, it says invalid torrent file! Maybe it's because of a software that I've downloaded. I tried to download other torrents and they work. K, I will investigate. LOL"
,fanciz,2009-08-15T21:51Z,"K I cleaned the temporary Internet files and cookies and it works now. I guess it was because of Ultrasurf.
Thanx for the upload."
