Here's a wonderful gem I purchased about two years ago.  It contains all three of the Fallout games from our dearly departed Black Isle Studios.  This indludes:

Fallout
Fallout 2
Fallout Tactics (Brotherhood of Steel)

The DVD came completely DRM free, and this is a pure ISO of it.  I know I'm not known in the TPB community as a software uploader, but if there's a virus it came with the disc, and would encourage you to do a scan just in case (of course).

One thing of note about the installation of these games: The autorun appears to be completely *useless*.  Instead, just explore the disc, go to the individual folders, and install them that way.

Also: FO1 and FO2 should work completely without the disc if you do a full install.  If you run FO3, however, it will expect the disc to be in the drive.  I should note, however, that I just tested an install of FO3 from a mount of this ISO, and it appears to recognize that as the "disc" it needs.

Please seed this fairly large file for everyone else who wants to see these games.  Fallout 3 was a terrific game, but it lacked the depth and character of the originals, and a lot of the young folk are hearing this.  This is our way to spread the word.
