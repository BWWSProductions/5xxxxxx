As for the other two?  Yeah, you should get the patches for them, I guess, although I didn't notice any serious bugs playing through without them.  :)"
,SK234269,2009-08-17T00:34Z,"Yes, another comment: Vista x64 users, you're in luck.  I just tested loading all three of them into my Vista x64 rig, and they run just fine without any modifications or tweaks.

Once again, enjoy!  I see there's already almost a dozen leechers out there.  Let's keep this one going, folks."
,fracicone,2009-08-17T01:20Z,"Dude, don't confuse people. What you call FO3 is actuall FOT (Fallout TACTICS), which still was an excellent game but focused more on the strategic part over the RPG.
Thanks for the upload of course!"
,SK234269,2009-08-17T01:25Z,"Whoa!  Sorry about that, and thanks for pointing it out.  When I said in the comment text ""I just tested an install of FO3 from a mount of this ISO,"" I was, indeed, referring to Fallout: Tactics, and *not* the Bethesda release of FO3.

Again, I apologize for any confusion that may arise from this oversight."
,SD1000,2009-08-17T15:04Z,"awesome, thanks!"

That was exactly what I was looking for the whole week. Thanks a lot!!!"
,shinobiteno,2009-08-21T12:53Z,Forgot to add: this stuff runs nicely on linux via dosbox or wine.
,LightenLhar,2009-09-12T05:34Z,"I hate ISO files, can you upload each game individually in a .RAR file? I hate wasting all that space on three things when I only want one. Also ISO files suck."
