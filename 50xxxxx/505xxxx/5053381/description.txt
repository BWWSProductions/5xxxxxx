This is the last part 4 of a trainride from Salta to Mina Concordia in 
Argentina.

SADLY: 
1) Now the film is with music instead of driving noises.
2) As we had to face it already with my torrents about Switzerland, New 
Zealand, Scotland and Norway, the last sections of the last part of 
the trainrides were'nt broadcasted and are therefore missing.

The German TV (ARD) broadcasts once in while during nighttimes short section
of trainrides like this featuring the most beautiful tracks in the world. 

I catch as many sections as possible using Windows Media Center recording in 
its special format dvr-ms, cut and merge it with DVREdit. Afterwards the file 
is convertetd lossless to mpg (filesize is almost identical) since I think, it
is the most popular format everybody can handle.

Hope, you enjoy my CabRide-torrents.
