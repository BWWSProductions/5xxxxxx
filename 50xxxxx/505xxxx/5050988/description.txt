Hosts : Robert Llewellyn & Cathy Rogers.

This season Grand Finale sees 2000 SHC winners "Brothers In Arms" (Lt. Colonel Dick Strawbridge and his two younger brothers Major David Strawbridge and Captain Bobby Strawbridge along with their expert Andy Robinson) take on 1999 SHC winners "The Megalomaniacs" ('Nosher', 'Daz' and Kev along with their expert Brian Johnson) for the coveted Scrapheap Challenge Cup.

The challenge : build the fastest drag racing machine they can. The fastest over-all time from a series of 3 races wins.

(Although in sync, the video doesn't run 'true' for unknown reasons, apologies). V6/A10

Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s.

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them.

It's a team effort. Please do your part.

Until I see enough seeding of previous episodes, I won't be allowing anyone to get 100% of the rest of this season, nor uploading seasons 4 - 10. No apologies.
