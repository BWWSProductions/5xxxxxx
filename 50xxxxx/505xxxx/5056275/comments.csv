,jameater,2009-10-08T19:07Z,"@atl101: ""This is the beta version, and so will probably still contain some bugs and errors, and will only work until the 9th of September 09""

With that said, has anyone heard about the full version being cracked yet? I really want this program. I would go out and buy it, but then I'd have to buy reason too. Way too much money just to use this with my reason setup. "
,baberNeighbor,2009-10-10T22:42Z,So it's October 10th have any of your guys noticed if this version still works?
,Bassplant,2009-10-14T00:47Z,"yeah sorry about that, forgot to write that this is the beta, but i have it installed on 2 machines and it works. only restrictions are that it won't let you burn the audio and if u close the file ur workin on u can't re-open it. 
@jameater if u find a crack can u post a link on this page? ihaven't had any luck so far..."
,Bassplant,2009-10-14T00:55Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4615892/Replay.Music.v3.45.CRACKED-ViSUAL - this comes in handy for the audio :)
,atl101,2009-10-19T23:10Z,"if you can't burn audio or load songs then there is no difference between this and the demo, you might as well just download the demo straight from Propellerhead"
,pyromaster287,2009-11-02T00:04Z,I still can't get it to work. I must be retarted
