BEFORE YOU DONWLOAD - THIS IS THE BETA. 
RESTRICTIONS - 1. YOU CAN'T BURN AUDIO 
               2. YOU CAN'T RE-OPEN PROJECTS


Welcome to Record, Propellerhead Software's brand new recording software. Record gives you unlimited audio tracks, world class effects and mixing gear, and a whole new take on music recording. With an intuitive, straightforward interface and a hands-on approach to capturing performances, Record was designed for musicians - not audio engineers. This is recording done right.

Info:
This is the beta version, and so will probably still contain some bugs and errors, and will only work until the 9th of September 09. i have virus tested it with AVG 8, Malwarebytes and Spybot
