Of course, so is the rest of the internet.
But good work. Almost lost faith that I'd see this."
[T],Juan.Too,2009-08-15T05:20Z,"Another problem that arises due to no official checklist:
I realize that none of the X-titles in this month's list actually have Dark Reign banners on their covers.
However, Dark X-Men does start with the word ""Dark"".  If I'm including Dark X-Men then I figured I should include the rest of the books in the Utopia storyline.  Utopia features the Dark Avengers and Norman Osborn and fits into the overarching Dark Reign plot.  
It would seem stupid to me NOT to include Utopia with Dark Reign."
,indeldude,2009-08-15T05:24Z,"Yeah, from what I understand, all the Utopia and Exodus stuff from Dark/Uncanny X-Men is going into the ""Dark Reign: The List"" stuff for the X-Men issue."
[T],Juan.Too,2009-08-15T05:26Z,"@indeldude
I know it's missing Black Panther 006.
That's why I mentioned it in the torrent description.  ;)

Again, I apologize for the lateness.
It is unfortunate, but the timeliness of these torrents of mine are subject to the whims of the scanning gods."
,Lubbock,2009-08-15T08:12Z,Thanks Juan :)

,bucky_,2009-08-16T00:55Z,Thanks for the Whole run of Dark Reign Torrents: The link above if for Black Panther #6 but comments were a bit screwy.

[T],Juan.Too,2009-08-16T22:14Z,"Thanks for the links guys.
It figures that it would come out as soon as I cave in and decide to post an incomplete list.
I'll just include it next month."
,KevMovieMan,2009-08-16T23:45Z,The ppl responsible for uploading these Dark Reign titles by the month are doing a great job by simplifying the collection/reading order process this makes it much easier to understand and to ensure i got everything I need I say.... THANK U UPLOADER AND KEEP GOING UNTIL THE REIGN ENDS!!! (Whenever that will be)
,Tenuto,2009-08-17T07:06Z,"Thanks Juan, you're the best! "
,MAGIC_HATE_BALL,2009-09-08T06:33Z,"Juan, you doing the work of Jesus my man!  Are you working on Dark Reign August too?  "
,brega10,2009-09-14T00:59Z,Hey Juan... thanks for your Monthy Dark Reign torrents!  Looking forward to August and September's editions.
,Timmy.Ho,2009-09-14T05:52Z,"Juan!

Any news on Dark Reign - August 2009?"
[T],Juan.Too,2009-09-18T02:00Z,"Hey guys,
Sorry about how long it takes for me to get these out.  This tends be a lot more complicated and time-consuming than it looks.  It would be incredibly easy if Marvel had bothered with a checklist (see my Blackest Night torrents - much easier for me).  
Add to this the fact that there are already more Dark Reign comics than were in either Civil War or in Secret Invasion.
And now this month there appears to be comics that are part of the main storyline but don't have Dark Reign banners!  
Aarghh!

Anyway, I'm working on Dark Reign - August right now and I hope to get it out in the next day or two.
Thanks for your patience and for your seeding."
