Plot:
After tackling Tony Blair and David Frost, actor Michael Sheen turns to another driven historical figure: football manager Brian Clough. Talented but abrasive, Clough alienates some of those around him, including his rival, Don Revie. When Clough has the chance to coach Leeds, Revieâ€™s former team, he takes on the role of the manager of the countryâ€™s best soccer team. Also starring Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, and Colm Meaney, this film marks the fourth time screenwriter Peter Morgan has crafted a character for Sheen.

This has 2 flaws : a timer and a property message. Everything else is ok.
