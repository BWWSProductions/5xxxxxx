Director: Dennis Kirkland 
Rating: Unrated

Watch the Prime Minister of Comedy at the height of his career in Benny Hill: Complete And Unadulterated - Set Four (1978-1981) witnessed new producer Dennis Kirkland's raucous and rowdy influence on The Benny Hill Show, Benny's receipt of the "Funniest Man on Television" award, and the introduction of the beautiful and buxom Hill's Angels.
The Benny Hill Show's pioneering sketch comedy went straight for the gut (and often a bit below!)--and this fourth set of complete episodes doesn't disappoint! Chow Mein and Fred Scuttle return in new madcap moments and the debut of Benny's Aussie Digger Blue, film legend Michael Caine, and the Scarlet Pimple bring new hilarity to the program.
