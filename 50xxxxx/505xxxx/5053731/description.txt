  From Recorded Books:

Gorgeous widow Karen DiCilia finds out what it really means to be married to the mob when she reads her Mafia husbandâ€™s will. He left her millions in stocks and bonds, a Florida Gold Coast mansion, and priceless antiques. Of course, he also left orders that sheâ€™ll lose everything the minute she sleeps with another man. But Karenâ€™s husband didnâ€™t count on a sexy dolphin trainer from Detroit with a scam to get Karen and her moneyâ€”unless, of course, it gets her killed. Gold Coast is Leonard at his astonishing best: filled with crackling authentic dialogue, daring plot twists, and fresh, quirky characters.

   When he kicked off, Florida mob boss Frank DiCilia left his gorgeous widow Karen everything, but with strings attached. She loses the millions, the cars, the palatial Gold Coast mansion if she ever gets involved with another man. And there's a crazy cowboy-wannabe thug named Roland who's acting as Frank's eyes beyond the grave, making sure Karen doesn't dally, with serious muscle, if necessary. 
   But now Cal Maguire's come into the picture. A sexy, street-smart Detroit ex-con, Cal's got a line and a scam for every occasion. And he's got the perfect plan for getting Karen DiCilia her money and her freedom ... if it doesn't get them both killed first.
