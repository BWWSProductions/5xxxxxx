,donegalmick,2009-12-15T00:24Z,"If you or your parents or your grandparents were born between 1945 and 1960 you will LOVE this movie. If anyone else has an interest in how rock came to the UK and stayed, you too, will LOVE this movie. The movie captures the wonderful freedom of the '60's. I know... I was there. The songs are to die for...."

Its a good movie :) Thanks a lot!

But there is a thing: English subtitle is integrated into the movie-there is no option to turn it off :P
But everything else is great! :)
Keep up the good work"
