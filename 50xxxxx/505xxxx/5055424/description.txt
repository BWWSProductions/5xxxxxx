Conquest was a TV show on the History Channel hosted by Peter Woodward. In each 30 minute episode he (or occasionally an outside expert) teaches his small group of assistants a particular type of weapon, or a set of weapons from a particular time period, while demonstrating their function, describing their comparative advantages and disadvantages, and discussing their history.

Unfortunately Conquest never came out on DVD and is not currently playing on US TV so it is difficult to find.
