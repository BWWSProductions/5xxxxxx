,genocidefish,2009-10-21T13:53Z,This torrent currently contains no .iso files and as such is totally useless. Do not download it.
,fireblade80,2009-10-23T01:27Z,"genocidefish, stop adding malicious comments just because you are a stupid teenager. The torrents has all the ISO image content required."

,stesin,2009-11-22T17:27Z,"Thanks, friend! :)"
,Kneurosis,2009-12-13T22:04Z,"Thanks for the detailed instructions, but when I try to replace the exe file with the crack it says to ""please insert cd rom"".  I tried both methods, with daemon tools and with image burn.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.  I'm somewhat of a neanderthal when it comes to computers.  :)"

,StaticPulse.,2011-01-15T07:36Z,THANK YOU GUYS FOR SEEDING YOU GUYS ROCK!!
,mtorresm,2011-01-29T19:59Z,"Thank you, fireblade80. This is by far THE most organized Civ3 torrent I've ever seen. Kudos to you.

Some info for the newbies: the reason this one is so much lighter than other torrent compilations out there is because you DO NOT NEED the Play the World .iso, since the whole of the first expansion is already included in the second, i.e.: Conquests.

The instructions above work perfectly. I am goint to do this torrent some advertising! And seeding for at least a month, of course."
,littlesnacks,2011-02-12T14:01Z,"this torrent is by far the simplest out of all of the CIV 3 torrents on TBP, good looks fireblade."
,benimussus,2011-02-25T15:13Z,Thank you very much for this torrent. It's greatly organized.

,powuhass,2011-04-12T21:29Z,"Hi everyone. It doesen't seem to be working for me. I have followed the steps, but it's not working. When i press on Civilization.exe it just says it has stopped working. I tried compatibility modes but that doesen't help. I have installed, patched and cracked it.  Please help. Thank you."
,powuhass,2011-04-12T21:35Z,Fixed it.
,jo_si_a,2011-05-04T06:33Z,"Hey, thanks for the torrent, but I'm currently pretty frustrated. I don't tend to be very good at these sorts of things, and everything's worked fine however it still asks me to insert a CD when I go to play either version of the game. I've installed everything, following instructions to the letter, have the ISO files mounted on Daemon, and when the game opens it always asks me for the CD. Any help would be appreciated."
,corayay,2011-05-16T22:42Z,"Doesn't work. I spent 2 days trying to figure out how to get it to work, tried everything there is to try. If you encounter problems right away, don't bother with it. Buy the game, it'll save you time and frustration."
,altronlives,2011-06-13T16:59Z,"hey im actually having the same problem as Huskie02...follwed the instructions etc...but the program does not start. no errors, no nothing. and hey, how do some of you feel about actually helping or answering some of the questions from less knowledgable people who take the time to join your community, instead of just blasting them and using terms like 'noob'. some of you are in your 30's already. come on now...
thanks for an otherwise good torrrent though"
,killaghostman,2011-06-14T11:51Z,Anyone having an issue where once conquests has started the main menu buttons are out of working order...? this is the first time i have encountered this kinda thing 
,killaghostman,2011-06-14T12:16Z,nvm answered my own question... just needed to be patched
,antimaterial,2011-06-16T03:27Z,"dont try to mount it with PowerISO. it asks for 2 cd while searching for AncECFull.mp3 which doesnt show up exactly in the virtual drive. If you click the folder in it F:\...\ANCIENT it is actually ANCECFUL.mp3 missing the letter ""l"". i was on the edge of swearing to fireblade. still i didnt understand the problem with PowerISO."
,easytoforget,2011-06-27T18:32Z,"for those who are getting the ""please insert disc"" error, i also was getting that error. i then noticed i wasnt following the last instruction properly. each of the 3 files has to be copied indiviually to the ""specific"" folder (ie: when copying the PTW file, it must be copied to the PTW folder inside the civ 3 main file, same for conquests). you cannot just copy the whole ""crack"" folder. 

not sure if that helps, but the game works fine for me :D

another issue people may encounter tho, daemon tools must be installed before the process can begin."
,easytoforget,2011-06-30T02:28Z,"awesome dude! thank! best of luck to all who are having issues, i followed every step to a T and it works great (except the Mayans are currently kicking my butt!)"

Followed all the instructions to the letter, and when I go to open any version of the game, nothing happens. I mean, absolutely nothing.

,JarnoHKK3,2011-08-19T06:10Z,"Thought I'd thank you for such quality upload, includes everything you could possibly need. Not sure how so many are having issues, it's no different than installing most games from an ISO."

Good. Working on my Win sp3.
But cannot possible play from the iso's, need crack."

,hyperspaced,2011-10-26T07:59Z,works perfectly. all you have to do is follow instructions :D
,nickig83,2011-10-29T07:50Z,For those having issues with nothing happening when mounting the image.  I had the same problem.  I had to actually go into the image and click on the setup to install.  It would not autorun. I hope this helps.
,klopolo,2011-11-11T06:59Z,ok dude your the best and most well orginized torrent uploader ever :) super easy instructions and game plays great. but.... i have regular civ and PTW civ but every time i run the patch and try to copy the crack over the patch of the conquest folder it keeps telling me i need a CD??? can you please help i just need this game im feendin for some more civs and units
,klopolo,2011-11-12T10:18Z,ok i see what i did wrong im a dumb ass retard when it comes to the last direction. ok anyone that is having trouble with the PTW or Conquest game because you need a cd is because you need to COPY and Paste the CRACK files into the civ folder it belongs to. so PTW crack goes in the PTW folder copyed and pasted. thats what i did wrong and now it works great. just follow the instructions and you will have your self a perfect civ 3 game THANKS FIREBLADE80
,darkchaosdragon,2011-12-05T00:42Z,sorry though AVG picked up a virus
,kyrakuijpers,2011-12-18T01:50Z,"PLEASE HELP,

Okay so I'm trying to find the crack files to replace the old files, but I can't find them. Can someone please tell me where I can find them? I don't see any CRACK or PATCH folder? "
,kyrakuijpers,2011-12-18T01:52Z,"Sorry nevermind, I've found the crack files!"
,stOneskuL,2011-12-28T10:15Z,if nothing happens when you go to play it is probably windows 7.. don't autorun from the cd.. instead in the cd right-click setup.exe and choose properties. go to compatibility tab and choose windows xp and also tick run as administrator. good luck :)
,stOneskuL,2011-12-28T10:46Z,you want xp 2 compatibility.. and do the same with the patch files.. if still problems see the civfanatics forum

,veclawd,2012-05-29T08:16Z,"I just wanted to let everyone know who's having problems with this fucking torrent not starting up after following all the instructions is because the damn game is supposed to make a .ini configuration file but because certain screens on different pc configurations want to be homosexual about it the game won't start.

What you have to do is download a configuration file here http://forums.civfanatics.com/attachment.php?s=acb0037925313066872c26d1c58b12d4&attachmentid=214808&d=1242770492 and unzip it into the civ 3 directory and then god willing the game should start then. If not then go ape shit because it worked for me and I almost deleted this fucking shit. "
,NoxMortal,2012-06-16T18:23Z,"For Those People Installing under Windows 7
______________________________________
 I noticed something strange when installing Civ3 in Windows 7. The install appeared to work fine, but when I went to run the game, the shortcut didn't work. Investigation showed that the registry entries had been added, but the game had not actually installed on my hard drive (despite all indications to the contrary during the install).

 Anyway - the fix:
 1.) Don't use the autorun when the CD gets inserted.
 2.) Open windows explorer and use that to view the CD contents.
 3.) Right-click on ""setup.exe"", and choose ""properties"".
 4.) On the ""compatability"" tab, check the option to run in WIndows XP compatability mode.
 5.) Also check the ""run as administrator"" option.
 5.) Close the properties window.
 6.) Double-click on the setup.exe icon - it should now install properly.

 Note: If you already installed and it didn't work, then the first time you run setup like this, it will actually uninstall the game, and you need to run it a gain to install.

 Note 2: You should also do the same steps for any patches you install (compatability mode, run as administrator)."
,you_wont,2012-06-20T02:14Z,"Works beautifully. Excellent instructions and it runs just fine. Just a tip, if you only want the base game (CivIII), in your torrent client (I use uTorrent), cancel the download on everything except the CivIII iso (Civilization III.iso), the CivIII crack (Civilization3.exe), and the CivIII patch (Civ3vl129f.exe) for a faster download."
