,tingtong29,2009-08-16T02:43Z,"i am getting pissed of with people finishing download and then fucking of to let me seed alone i will seed for 2 more hours and that is it.
for the people that dont get this finished you can thank the wankers that stop seeding as soon as they have got it all "
,stonynylon,2009-08-16T09:01Z,"How do you determine that a new seeder has disconnected?
- they disconnect from you? this is natural, since they don't have anything to upload to you/download from you
- TPB's tracker still shows 1 seed? that value probably doesn't update quite in realtime.

Please also consider that people who have been downloading the torrent for >10 hours probably have well over 2,xx share ratios, and are somewhat justified to disconnect soon after finishing.


Furthermore, consider using the superseeding feature of your client. It's designed to minimise the upload needed by choking people who don't upload. (it only works during initial seeding when there is only one seed)




Thanks for the torrent! I like the girl, and don't mind the lack of sound (but the boy sure is ugly). Is there a part 3?"
,tingtong29,2009-08-16T12:16Z,there is sound but you need the right codecs
,stonynylon,2009-08-16T13:20Z,"I'm darn confused then, since my media player doesn't find an audio stream for the WMVs or the AVIs. If it were a codec issue, it would find a stream and mention that it can't play it.

Any hints on which players / codecs it should be working?"
,tingtong29,2009-08-16T17:24Z,nope sorry i am not clued up on this sort of shit but if you look on other torrent (part 1) some one is telling you about it there so you could ask him best i can think of
