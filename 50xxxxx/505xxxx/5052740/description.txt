BBC Four presents a special performance by Bruce Springsteen from LSO
St Luke's in London's East End, an intimate backdrop for a superstar rocker
more used to arena-sized venues. But fans of older works like Born to Run
will find the venue switch dovetails nicely with a change in musical style.

The Boss performs songs from his new album, We Shall Overcome: The
Seeger Sessions, which consists of folk standards and spirituals popularised
by the American folk legend, Pete Seeger. According to the bbc.co.uk/music
album review, it's 'a fine example of a contemporary artist taking great
delight in collaborating with crack musicians and mining his country's
songwriting past.'
