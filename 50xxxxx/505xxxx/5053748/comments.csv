,xXWolfyXx,2009-08-15T21:00Z,"We recommend that you do a clean installation. 

However you can dual-boot. "
,Jakka777,2009-08-17T14:24Z,Could you please seed? There's a handful of people stuck on 30.2% :(
,JGriswold,2009-08-19T14:16Z,"I just started seeding this again. Already did 20 gigs earlier. Should be able to stay on long enough to bump you all up. My upload speed hovers between 100 and 200 kb/s. So it may take a while. And if any others who have the whole thing would help out, that would be great.

You can thank me by seeding for a while after your d/l is done. Or I could use a demonoid invite, so I can see what all the fuss is about!

,earthnut,2009-08-19T17:44Z,how do i burn this. it's too big for a dvd
,JGriswold,2009-08-19T18:52Z,"It is made to be burned to a dual layer dvd.  They hold a lot more. Also, I havent tried it but I've read that you can install from a big thumbdrive or a portable hard drive.

Thanks
