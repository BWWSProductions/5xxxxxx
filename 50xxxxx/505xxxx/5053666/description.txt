I got this file from a friend of mine so I have no clue as to where he got it or what the original source is, he gave me this copy for my nephew whom loves Thomas. There is two audio streams in this file one is English, and I don't know what the other is, because I do not recognize the dialect. After Thomas goes off and the ending credits roll a cute little show called Roary the Racing Car comes on lasting about 10 mins. Never heard of this show but my nephew liked it so I left it in the file.

Enjoy
