Atomic Mail Sender v4.27 made Portable (Thinstalled).

No need to install it!
Or, if you want to, Setup and Crack are included.


Atomic MailSender (AMS) is a mass mailer with built-in e-mail campaign tracking facilities where you can create, send and track effectiveness of sent newsletters.

AMS is not just a secure bulk mailer, with AMS you can also control and compare the effectiveness of your email campaigns by monitoring who,from what country and when opens your email, clicks links or downloads files. Being integrated with Atomic Email Tracker (web-based newsletter monitoring system), the program can be set to create an invisible code and insert it into sent messages. Once you are registered with the Email Tracker service and the campaign name is created in AMS, our system starts monitoring the status of every email sent out under that email campaign name.

SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal
 
http://virusscan.jotti.org/
 
http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
