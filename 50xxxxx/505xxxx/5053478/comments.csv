I e-mailed him at his lame web-page asking for advice on setting up my 12 string guitar, but the motherfucker blew me off and tried to sell me his prick ""An American Band"" book.

Fucking loser is what Dan Peeks was.  Turned his back on Rock 'n' Roll 'cause he was an idiot that got suckered into drugs."
