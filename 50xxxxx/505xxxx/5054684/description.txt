1.- Intro:
Hello, ok here again on another tut for C4N, this time i am goin to talk about Time Trials
Even tough they are easy a lot of ppl still don't get it so this is why this tut is gone
(hopefully) teach you, also i will teach some of nag remove and bmp (splash) screens :-)
ok, the program had to be a time trial (of course) but we need it a not to big program but
one
that had some potencial in it or i could have used Rhino 3d wich is not small and does not
have any teaching potential (u changed one byte and it's cracked) so ok with the help of a
friend Griml0ck we decited to get this program is called WinTAR-Remote by SpiralCom
Communications Inc. what this program does is not important to us we wil crack it and
delted it for educational purpose ONLY :-).
In this tut i will asume u know how to use all of the tools i will use here else please get
other
tuts that do explain how to use them (TKC's, Edison's, josephCo's and others)
