Tummen upp!"
,somedude72,2009-08-18T02:01Z,"Be kind and seed the thing, since Cryptic's patch process is FUBAR for a lot of folks."
,Superbus,2009-08-18T05:12Z,"beware I had this preloaded from fileplanet, and loaded it this morning, it then tried to patch itself with a 3.2 gb patch, I had to delete as I am on limited Bandwidth and never would have done the 1.8 gb preload had I known. People w/o bandwidth concerns just carry on."
,huntgod,2009-08-18T05:42Z,"The actual patch is only around 400meg, the patch shows 3+gig but that is an error, the newer version of the DL shows correctly."
,farphignougen,2009-08-18T06:43Z,This is a damn site smoother than Fileplanet's shitty queue system.
,malibar1,2009-08-18T09:04Z,"i get an error when it trys to update 
idle to long with connection"
,deavsiri,2009-08-18T10:26Z,"ok... Anyone experiencing problems downloading the patch, should visit the Champions Online official website. The instructions say to download the new client, but this one torrent is the same one they ask for. However you should also Download the fix they list there. The Fix is a direct patch that eliminated having to apply the patch for hours and hours through the (obviously) broken launcher. hope this helps!!!"
