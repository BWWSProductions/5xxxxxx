,Hellman109,2009-08-16T05:56Z,"It worked fine for me.  But the game itself is pretty lame.  Graphics are very poor, and the voice acting is terrible.  Very basic gameplay too."

,Davey0070,2009-08-17T02:28Z,probably because its a game Wayne.
,SweRaider,2009-08-20T00:38Z,"pretty nice gameplay, but it doesnt seem finished in most ways, graphically, no story, no special features"
,mikels12,2009-08-26T14:09Z,anybody got past 17.attack of the flying dragon: or any tips i just cant seem to last long on this level
,BigSniff,2009-08-26T19:19Z,"Almost seemed like a demo, anyone else get that feeling? There was no story, no goals really either, just shoot everything and press esc.

There were only a few different scenarios with different mission names and different crappy mission dialog.
