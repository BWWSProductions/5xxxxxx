"most indeed it was a pleasure to play at such a well organised event..thank you for having us, we had a great time very, very special in more ways than one."
Roots Manuva

"Playing for EXIT this year was something of a very special party and the way all the DJâ€™s got to play back to back was absolutely amazing. It gave the crowd something completely unique and very special for the celebration of 10 years of EXIT. I had an amazing time and thought it was absolutely exceptional the way the crowd stayed with us until the morning and had a celebration. I felt honored and proud to be asked to do this and I hope that I can get to play at EXIT a few more times in the years to come." 
Carl Cox

"FUCK! That was fun..."  
Lee Burridge

Steve Lawler

"Once again Exit proves to be one of the best festivals in the world!!!"

"Playing the Exit Festival's 10th Birthday was an honour, especially given the social background of the event. I've always loved Exit and I had so much fun, much of which was provided by once more playing back to back with my close friend Yousef. Bravo!"
Paul Woolford

"Exit Festival has to be one of the most special festivals we have ever played. Just staring out from the stage to over 20,000 ravers was one of the pinnacle moments of our career.  The atmosphere was amazing and the festival organizers were the best yet! Its going to be hard to beat!!"
