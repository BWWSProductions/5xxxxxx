BIG GUNS

The platoon receives an exciting new toy in the shape of a 13 round Naval field gun. Mainwaring sets his sights on bulldozing everything in the town that stands in the weaponâ€™s firing line â€“ including the cricket score board and the ancient bandstand!!


THE DAY THE BALLON WENT UP

When the verger gets inexplicably caught up in the rope of a barrage balloon, the platoon rushes to his rescue. But events soon turn farcical when Mainwaring gets hoisted up too. The chase is on to bring the foolish Captain down before he meets his flighty end.


WAR DANCE

Pike has fallen in love with the rather common Violet Gibbons and is determined to announce his engagement at the Home Guard dance. Mainwaring asks Wilson to take responsibility for the boy, and tell him the errors of his ways.
