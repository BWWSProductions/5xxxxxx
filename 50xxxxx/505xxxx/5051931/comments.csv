,funkyDL,2009-08-14T14:12Z,"im waiting for a 700 mb...FXG, axxo might upload it..."
,WilliamSouthgate,2009-08-14T16:46Z,"I don't get it... Why does everyone always seem to be so turned off that it takes two ""CD's"" to burn it. Why don't you just burn it to a DVD and put it on the television?? Just wondering... "
,doubledge,2009-08-14T20:16Z,"@JBNyen:  
(and anyone else who doesn't know this):

The reason for the ""2 CD"" size is because of the AC3 - 5.1 Dolby Audio CODEC  that is used here - instead of an MP3 - 2 channel audio track.

If you've got a decent surround-sound setup, it makes a world of difference.
I used to seek smaller rips (1 CD size), but since acquiring ""Home Theater"" equipment, I now prefer the original 5.1 audio.
(AAC works ok, too - used on BluRay (MKV)rips)

in case you check back here there is an free open source live cd OS called geeXbox that turns an xbox into a mediacenter, so it can play pretty much any media file, it supports networking, so you can stream from your computer. You can try it from the cd or ram, if you like it-then install it."

,dougyphresh77,2009-08-16T06:20Z,"sorry to ask such a lame question, but how to i get subs to work with a movie?"
,OttoBismark,2009-08-16T07:12Z,"@dougyphresh-
If the subs in a rar file, you need to extract them first into the same folder that the movie is in.
I use VLC media player, which has a drop-down menu,(usually easier to find without a skin) that asks you to choose a file, that's it. Other media players should be similar. Check TPB's forum, suprbay.org, there is a link at the bottom of this page, for more info."
,OttoBismark,2009-08-16T07:15Z,"@dougyphresh-
I really recommend VLC, it's free, open source, very simple to use. "

,somadasa,2009-08-16T08:37Z,can any one tell me.. how to load the sub files?
,dmov287,2009-08-16T11:01Z,"audio is good, video is good (resolution could be higher for it's an 1,38GB) and an extra point for the subtitles (various languages included!)

movie is not so good, though :(
russell crowe looks most of the time very tired, but then he manages to escape from a killer 2 times.
quite unbelievable.
and i'm guessing that new blogging chick is just next to him because she's good looking (story could have totally gone without her, except for 1 clue or so). :P

btw, i hope those spammers will burn in hell!
who would copy, paste and edit their strange URLs anyway? no one!"

,equazcion,2009-08-16T19:47Z,Good quality. But the file is much larger than it needs to be. And it's a bad movie. Thanks again AiTB.
