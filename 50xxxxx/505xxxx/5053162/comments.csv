,Jourinho_10,2009-11-06T16:31Z,"Ok. I mounted the cd, were able to install the game. Then I copied the crack files to the COD file in program files. But when I try to open i it says: ""COD 4: Modern Warfare couldn't write a file. The hard drive is probably full.""

Can someone please tell me what to do because that's impossible, I have 6,64 GB left...

Please?

Thanks"

yes you can play multiplayer with this

you need tunngle,1.6 & 1.6-1.7 patch
install .6 then .7 patches

sign into tunngle.cod4 lobby

open game.dont try to join an internet game.u will always need a cd key
instead.change source to LOCAL
and you can play MP"

,Haawkings,2010-01-30T01:14Z,"I got me a problem, when I mount, my only option is to uninstall. If I press setup I get an msg telling me a package cannot be opened; \Cod4MW.msi

I'm using Win7, is there any way around this?"
,EZME,2010-02-05T22:33Z,"if you mount the .iso and then install the game. The two multiplayer patches (1.6 & 1.6-1.7 patch
install .6 then .7 patches) do not work.

The game requests the first install DVD to contuine.

I didn't burn a DVD, I installed the game from the mounted .iso

I haven't tried whether it does in fact work with a burned DVD however.


"
,EZME,2010-02-08T11:12Z,"Ok, here is what I did to use multiplayer with this

""you need tunngle,1.6 & 1.6-1.7 patch
install .6 then .7 patches""

...and once you do that you need to overwrite the ""iw3sp.exe"" with the cracked file again. File size should be 2947 KB.

It does work in multiplayer mode doing this."
