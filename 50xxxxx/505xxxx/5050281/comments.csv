,eliia,2009-10-31T09:48Z,Download and install C++ Runtime Libraries from microsoft site. That fixed the problem for me.
,MousePad,2009-11-16T01:57Z,And don't forget to patch it with the first service pack. It's so full of bugs it's hardly working at all.

,bexleyg21,2010-08-11T08:47Z,"Hi!  First off, thanks for the download!  Much appreciated...  But could I get your help?  I can't seem to get this to install!  lol.  Now, time for the dumb question.  There is an ISO image file that registers over 3g.  Do I need to burn that to a disc, then install from the disc?  If that's the case, is there a way to BYPASS that?  My computer's laser has burned out & I haven't had time (or money) to replace it.  Any help here would be appreciated.   Thanks in advance!!"
,SumeklamKidd,2011-09-03T07:42Z,"bexleyg21, try this. 

Download MagicDisc. Free program. If you are asked for cash, it's not the MagicDisc I'm referring to. Mount the disc virtually on your computer using MagicDisc. You can browse the ""CD"" and run it from your computer without a CD player. Hope that helps."
