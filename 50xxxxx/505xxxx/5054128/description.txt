The syllabus of Mechanical Science-II as designed by WBUT explains the important Chapters of Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. The book covers all the topics of the syllabus in a well explained and easily understandable manner to the students. In addition to this, many numerical examples have been worked out for each chapter. Multiple choice questions which are compulsory part of the final examination and also important for exhaustive knowledge of the chapters are included in the book. The book, therefore, is a one stop solution for all the requirements of its prospective readers.
