,pchell,2009-09-24T12:50Z,"cant not get the Fixed.exe to work 

anyone help please?"
,pchell,2009-09-24T18:39Z,its ok i managed to get it working without the fix :)
,nilloc93,2009-09-25T08:47Z,"this is in RUSSIAN

it has not had an english/other version made yet

if you want it in english you have to wait
the current official date is Q4 2009 so expect it around late october/november"
,pchell,2009-09-26T17:10Z,"i got this to work by doing the following

install the game

create two new folders, name them resource and mss

open the installation folder where you installed the game, now copy the two new folders into it

move the two folders called entity and interface into the folder resource

next cut mssds3d.flt, mssdsp.flt, msseax.flt and mssmp3.asi, paste them into the folder mss

then cut game.pak, music.pak, red_blood.pak, sound.pak, texture.pak and video_rus.pak and paste into the resource folder

then cut splash.bmp and paste into interface(might be already there cant remember)

load the crack into daemon tools and play 

if all goes well you might get a black screen during loading (i did), all i did was alt tab back to windows then went back to the game and i was it at the main menu "
