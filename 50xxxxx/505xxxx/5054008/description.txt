singer, songwriter and actress whose career spans over four decades. Her early
work in pop and rock music in the 1960s was overshadowed by her struggle with
drug abuse in the 1970s. During the first two-thirds of that decade, and with little
notice, only two studio albums were produced. After a long commercial absence,
she returned late in 1979 with the landmark album, Broken English. Faithfullâ€™s
subsequent solo work, often critically acclaimed, has at times been overshadowed
by her personal history.



1960's It Girl-turned-arthouse singer, Marianne Faithfull, exudes charm in a
performance in front of an intimate audience of friends and fans at LSO St Luke's
in east London.

A great band accompany her on an eclectic mix of songs from her criticallyacclaimed
covers album Easy Come Easy Go, including The Decemberists' The
Crane Wife 3, Morrissey's Dear God, Please Help Me, Dolly Parton's Down From
Dover and Randy Newman's chilling In Germany Before the War.

There are also dips into the past, with her first ever live performance of the original
1960s arrangement of As Tears Go By, plus the early Jagger-Richards song Sister
Morphine.
