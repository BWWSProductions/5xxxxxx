,The Dane,2009-08-17T15:50Z,"Hey Soagg 
i was wondering are u ever gonna upload the last  10 Episodes of Naruto (210-220) and maybe start uploading Shippuuden (witch thay have startet to english dub) i figured if i wrote it here there might a chance for u to see it 

Great Uploads btw "
[T],soagg,2009-08-17T18:59Z,Dane. I guess this is be a great place. But as I have said before they have currently stopped dubbing Naruto as other channels (excluding CN and adult swim) are way too behind. Thus we will have to wait and watch when they start the new series and finish of rest of it
,The Dane,2009-08-22T19:31Z,"Hey Soagg 
its not that i wanna be an ass .. i rly love the uploads u bring out :)
