Paris 36, also known as Faubourg 36, is a French film directed by Christophe Barratier. The film follows three unemployed friends in 1936 Paris as they decide to put on a musical to help a struggling community and to save a treasured theatre. Although their motives are sincere, the three non-performance artists struggle with the in's and outs of dealing with the local crime element and their inexperience in theater production.
