,VivaLaGaga,2011-10-06T17:15Z,"*PROBLEM* I followed instructions and done exactly as I should, but when I start the game, I watched the intro movies and I am guessing that when the game goes to start, I get an error ""Fatal Not Found Error - Can not find ""Placar Condensed"" in the ""Fonts"" list ***List Contains no items***""

It actually says those exaxt words with no spelling errors. I thought Placar was a typo but apparantly not... HELP!!"
