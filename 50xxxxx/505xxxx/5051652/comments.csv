,lucas22490,2009-08-16T05:18Z,it doesn't matter which version you can use any version you want because its the real key so just download the newest version out!!!
,Pierre26000,2009-08-16T10:47Z,"Thanks but your Key is not for HD version, however updates forever. I had an HD key but it has been blacklisted since 6.57.1 version. So you can share but closely if you bought it ...
Thanks again."
