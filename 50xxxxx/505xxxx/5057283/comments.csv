,groizer_x,2009-12-03T03:32Z,"sorry my poor english ...

1 - After downloading diablo.iso file you must open the iso with daemon tools program: http://www.baixaki.com.br/analise/Daemon-Tools.htm

2 - to install the daemon tools, click the right mouse button over the icon that represents the daemon tools in the task bar

3 - go to the option virtual cd / dvd-rom -> device 0: [...] the media -> mount image

4 - select diablo.iso

5 - that open the diablo setup and will appear 2 installation options (install diablo - complete game, and install diablo spawn - which is the shareware version of diablo

6 - enjoy!

simply one of the best games of all time"
,groizer_x,2009-12-03T22:13Z,"correction:

2 - AFTER YOU install the daemon tools, click the right mouse button over the icon that represents the daemon tools in the task bar



detail:

every time you play diablo, you'll have to mount the image (diablo.iso) in daemon tools so that the game thinks there is the original cd in cd drive"

,Anmaddox,2011-06-15T00:21Z,"If you are using a newer graphics card or os, that's why your colors are messed up. None of the new graphics cards support the older graphics, therefore screwing up the look of the game. Fortunately, I have an AGP graphics card, and it doesn't do that to me."
,F_morris,2011-10-10T16:49Z,"A link to the latest patch. The game don't ask to download it and just stalls at the connection to battle.net if i remember correct from last time I would go online to play. Got to find the patch myself.

,Illu5S5,2011-10-17T14:24Z,"After installing and playing... the colours are all messed up after first 5 mins.. 

VERY BAD :("
,powermad0,2012-05-15T00:57Z,"To the people with messed up colors, when you launch the game go into Task Manager and kill the ""explorer.exe"" process. Yes, sounds risky, but it's not. Same deal with Starcraft 1, the colors will be messed up but they'll be fine when the process is killed. I'm not sure if it works for this game, didn't download yet, but that's what I'd try first."
