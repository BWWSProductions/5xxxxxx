TV : Documentary : DVD quality : English



An intelligent, even nostalgic, introduction to the censorship issues that came to prominence in the 1980s, with a welcome mix of expert and eye witness talking heads to help explain the story.


Channel 4 television at its best.




Enjoy and Seed!!
