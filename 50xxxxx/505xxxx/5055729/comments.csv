,indeldude,2009-08-16T09:09Z,"Oh my god you are god.
You have Black Panther #6"
,ace_of_knaves,2009-08-16T12:45Z,"thanks for the upload. but can people please seed. 1 seeder and 481 leechers is not good enough. I'm uploading at 50 and downloading at something like 0.5, it's a disgrace."
,king_top,2009-08-16T13:24Z,ace_of_knaves: Have you understood how torrent work? Of course you will have to seed since their is only 2 seeders and 546 leechers...so either you wait a couple of days .. or your help share what you have .. no harder than that my friend
,disadventurer,2009-08-16T16:48Z,Anyone know where I can find Angel #24 (the one with Drusilla) and Angel: Only Human?
[T],Juan.Too,2009-08-17T00:55Z,"OK, I just wrote a several-paragraphs-long rant about how stupid it is to complain about the number of seeders on the first day of a large torrents release.
Then I decided not to bore you guys with that, so I deleted it.

I'll just say this: if you complain about seeds, especially in the comments section, you are an idiot.

Also, thanks for the comics Gilgamesh.  I've been looking for Black Panther 006 everywhere."
,lucky51470,2009-08-17T04:09Z,Hello I am kind of new to the site I did not know anything about seeding sorry if I have done wrong I promise to start seeding
,chris411,2009-08-20T21:35Z,"As I am writing this, Angel: Only Human has not been scanned, and I don't believe Angel #23 has been scanned either.  Unfortunately not everything gets scanned within a week."
