Amazon.co.uk - CD Description - Benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, thisdouble CD brings together some of the biggest names in several genres of music, from R.E.M to Aretha Franklin to Placido Domingo, who dedicate both well-known and brand new material to the memory of the Princess. Included among the classicpop hits are Eric Clapton's "Tears in Heaven", Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia", and Diana Ross's "MissingYou", all touching, melancholy ballads which underscore thetragedy of Diana's death and the depth of the loss felt by those who mourn. Some of the songs written especially for the album include Peter Gabriel's spare "In The Sun", Sinead O'Connor's soulful version of the hymn played at Diana's funeral, "Make Me A Channel of Your Peace", and a moving remake of the Eurythmics' "Angel" by Annie Lennox. A moment of uplift is provided by the Pretenders' hopeful "Hymn to Her:" "She will always carry on/Something is lost, but something is found/They will keep on speaking her name/Some things change,some stay the same".
