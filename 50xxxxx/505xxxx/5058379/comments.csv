Thanks jasper"
,Iliadfang,2009-08-18T01:41Z,"Hey every time I try to patch it says update error invalid file found and stops, help please : /"
,Iliadfang,2009-08-18T01:49Z,"I had the crack and 1.27 patch and I renamed the files, still wont let me patch : ("
,Iliadfang,2009-08-18T02:26Z,"I didn't make myself clear sorry, I had already installed the game from when he put it up previously but only had 1.27 patch up,  I installed the game and patched it then, but I apparently didn't rename the files then, I don't remember renaming the files to be part of his original instructions, and I didn't know to do it myself. The instructions have changed now so I don't know. 

Anyways I think you are right ill have to reinstall :p"
,Iliadfang,2009-08-18T02:28Z,"Except my girlfriend will kill me if the data is lost, so im kinda screwed unless I can fix it without reinstall.

Ill be first to admit I'm not the best at this, but I followed the original instructions and these to the letter, I don't know what went wrong."
,Iliadfang,2009-08-18T02:35Z,Tried replacing files with originals and still no luck.
,Jasper100,2009-08-18T13:25Z,"you can copy the game data and after that you can reinstall and then put the data back

so first go to my documents and open the ''electronic arts'' map and then copy the sims folder! now paste it on your desktop of whatever and uninstall the sims now reinstall the sims and now copy the sims dir on your desktop and open my documents again and then go again to ''electronic arts'' and then delete the sims dir now paste and you can patch the sims and copy the crack again Iliadfang
i hope it was clear enough!!

cheers"
,Iliadfang,2009-08-18T22:46Z,"Ill give that a shot, thank you so much jasper."
,Frchkn,2009-08-18T23:48Z,"Jasper.. 

 I would appreciate your input.. I have downloaded both needed torrent followed direction to a T.. It still tells me the CD is invalid.. I also cannot update. Gives me an error. I am running Vista 64 bit.. Would that have anything to do with it? "
,Jasper100,2009-08-19T10:39Z,"i guess not......about that 64bit thing!
you need to make sure that your firewall is blocking the sims (ts3.exe and simslauncher.exe)
and that you have copied the crack!
to patch you need the original ts3.exe and simslauncher.exe if you already copied the crack you need to delete the crack files(ts3.exe and simslauncher.exe) and rename ts3old.exe to ts3.exe and simslauncherold.exe to simslauncher.exe! and also make sure that your GameVersion in skuversion.exe that can be founded in the sims dir is exactly the number from the version that your sims is so if you never patched the sims it must be 1.0.631.00002
if it isn't change it and save! now run the patch again and look if it helped!
if your sims is patched to 1.3 it must be 1.3.24.00002 and if it is patched to 1.27 it must be 1.2.7.00002

give it a try"
,Iliadfang,2009-08-20T01:52Z,"Now it wont let me uninstall, when I try it says 

An error [-5005: -0x8000ffff] has occurred while running the setup.

Please make sure you have finished any previous setup and closed other applications. If the error still occurs please contact your vendor: EA- etc.. blah blah

Obviously I didn't have other apps or setups running, tried restarting, never works, can't uninstall. "
,Blackbyrd,2009-08-20T17:47Z,"Ok I did everything got the crack and the patch to work- but now I CAN NOT play the game. Every time I try I get this message: We are unable to verify that your disc is a valid copy of The Sims 3.
Please contact customer services. I am not connected to the internet when I get this message. I do not have a mac, the game seemed to work fine before I put the patch in. PLEASE some one tell me how to fix this. I am not a nobie so there is on need for condescending comments. I've been simming for a very long time and this is the first time I've had this problem. Any input you could give me would be greatly greatly appreciated PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP!!!!!"
,Blackbyrd,2009-08-20T17:48Z,Oh just two more things I am using DAEMON tools and I have Bitdefender virus protection. 
,Jasper100,2009-08-20T18:49Z,"did you patched to 1.4? and don't answer directly yes! look if you don't patched to 1.3 or 1.2.7


EA i support you but not in your fight against US."
,Cambromo,2009-08-21T00:32Z,"@ Iliand

When you uninstall the game it gives an option of ""Would you like to keep the sims save files and addons?""

So don't worry about fucking up"
,Iliadfang,2009-08-21T06:08Z,"Good to know, but I'm still having the problem where I just cant uninstall it period."
,Jasper100,2009-08-21T20:00Z,"if it doesn't remove do it this way (be careful with the register)

,corbinite,2009-08-22T05:06Z,"Alright, so I just downloaded this and when I clicked on the actual game to install, it's not doing anything. I've tried to open it and run it as adminstrator. It's not doing any of it. -sigh- Help?"
,corbinite,2009-08-22T05:18Z,"Haha. Wow. I'm a tard. It helps to actually get the game FIRST, right? Right. I'll go to DL that now. Thanks for being awesome and sharing. We poor kids appreciate it."
,xuss,2009-08-23T14:28Z,"The reason we cant get the patches to install is because we used his other torrent for the full game,which contains a crack itself,therefore we dont have an original.exe to use so we can load in the patches."
,hannahxxx,2009-08-23T16:12Z,"Made a clean installation of the Sims 3, tried to patch the game following your description, but I get the ""invalid file""-popup. WHYYY?"
,Jasper100,2009-08-23T18:06Z,"@xuss
you wan't the original files?

@hannahxxx 
you can try to Go to your Game>Bin folder
Locate the file ""skuversion.txt""
Open the file(with notepath)
Change the number in the line GameVersion to
""GameVersion = 1.0.631.00002"" so make sure that this number  ^^^^^^^^^ is there not any other number if it isn't this number then change it to this now try it again!

cheers"

,RhymesMatter,2009-08-27T11:37Z,"@Jasper100

First of all thanks for your great effort mate.Now i want to ask you is there a way to install the patch and your crack on 1.3.4 cracked version??I have already installed 1.3.4 and applied the crack so what do i need to do to install this new one?"
,Jasper100,2009-08-27T20:27Z,"@RhymesMatter maybe it is possible first try to install patch: Sims3_1.4.6.00002_from_1.3.24.00002.exe
if it does work: then copy the crack and past in it the sims/bin folder and replace and finished!
if the patch doesn't want to apple then you need to getter the original files FOR 1.3.2 (ts3.exe and simslauncher.exe so the UN-cracked files) and replace them with the cracked! and also make sure your GameVersion in skuversion.txt that can be founded in the sims dir is exactly the same number as the version that your sims is so in your case: 1.3.24.00002.

btw check your gameversion anyway!"
,Restless Heart,2009-08-29T12:17Z,I've got a mac and need the patches... can I use these? It only say that I don't have the Sims 3 installed - but I sure do!
,Jasper100,2009-08-31T19:16Z,i guess then that you can't solution: install ea download manager and let it update your sims!
,ro20895,2009-09-03T16:50Z,"Guys, The sims3_1.4.6.00002_from_1.0.631.00002 patch tells me that i have a wrong version???"
,ro20895,2009-09-03T17:24Z,By version i meant region
,Jasper100,2009-09-09T17:08Z,just look at my second comment try that and see!

I managed to find everything and added sims3launch.exe and the TS3.exe to the fire wall when i try and run it i get an error report message. I have reintsalled it all and did the same thing and it happened again...
However i did install new patches through the sims EA manager, would that of caused the problem?

ok so i downloaded the sims 3, the keygen, and after i put the code in it asks ""please insert disc 1 that contains file layout.bin."" So i looked through the comments on your original torrent  for the game and saw that you needed a crack and patches, so i downloaded this and i know that your steps are really easy to follow which is why i feel so dumb but i dont understand how to go about ""apply"" the patches. Also, I tried to rename the TS3.exe and the TSLHost.dll which is in sims>game>bin, correct? but it wont let me rename them, i also tried to copy and paste the crack into the bin but it says that there is not enough space :( I tried as much as i could to find the answers on my own but i just dont know what to do.
