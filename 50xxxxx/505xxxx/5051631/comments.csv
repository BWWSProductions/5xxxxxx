,joea13,2009-08-14T02:55Z,"Could someone please seed?  I'd really love to play this!  Also, do I need to already have GTA vice city installed for this to work?"
,Keko201,2009-08-27T02:06Z,"This is vice city, with the mod already installed. All you need to do is unzip and play."
,Keko201,2009-10-03T23:10Z,"For the people who have finished downloading it, what do you think?"
,kurt4991,2010-01-19T21:47Z,It doesn't work! After the intro it asks me to insert the cd! I tried to find a no-cd patch on the net but it still doesn't work!
,Keko201,2010-02-15T05:09Z,"hmmmm, idk what the problem is. it works for me and i gave it to some of my friends and it worked for them."
,Keko201,2010-02-15T05:14Z,"the file is a no-cd crack, so it should work. what os are you using?"
,headfcuk,2010-03-18T11:43Z,"please dude I am a Big fan of BTTF trilogy,coming to my problem i unzipped it and started playing after selecting the vc icon the game runs till the first Remote control tutorial after that it hangs.I tried it many times but still no success and second if i load the game from a saved game the whole game becomes non responsive and generates a error message.Please tell me what should i do because any how i want this game and why dont you make torrent of the setup file,please "
,Keko201,2010-03-28T00:41Z,"don't load any saved games, otherwise it will definitely crash. if you can't get it to work, try downloading the original vice city torrent, instal that, then go to the website provided in the torrent description, and instal it that way."
,headfcuk,2010-05-01T10:12Z,well dude i installed the original vice city and converted it into BTTF but it still has the same problem

,nosaj128,2011-06-06T22:16Z,I'm not sure if it's my graphics card or what (shouldn't be) but I've tried at least 6 different downloads of this game with crap for results. First the sound at the beginning skips until I change the quality settings in the options menu. Then the game only shows the video mode when interacting with characters not when actually playing. It will show the cursor and text but thats it. Anyone else bean having this same issue? i've tried everything.

What should I do to play?"
