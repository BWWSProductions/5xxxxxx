Plot: The third "Law and Order" series involves the criminal justice system from the criminal's point of view.

The addition of Jeff Goldblum brings a twisted intellectual dynamic to the eighth season.

I've enjoyed this show since the first season.

This torrent contains all 16 episodes of the eighth season.
