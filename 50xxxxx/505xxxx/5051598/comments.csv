,ceydee1,2009-08-28T17:54Z,I could not open this file  and it played as only audio file and when I tried to burn it to DVD it said only audio and no video that was the same when
,joel.westerlund,2009-12-25T17:32Z,"Works just fine. It's a regular divx/something, I didn't even check what format it is but it played fine in mplayer.

The sound was a bit unsynced at the start and I'm unsure if this is the actual lesson-discs because it seems to be almost entirely just a video of a ""zumba performance"" rather than instructions. In the end it looks more like some lesson except I saw no instructions, just a ""ok, now switch, now switch"" and some spanish talk (and english talk)

Unsure if it's supposed to be like that, just informing. :)
Not really what I was hoping it would be..
But thanks for sharing!"
