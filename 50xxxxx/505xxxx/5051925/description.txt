Amy Winehouse performs a one-off concert featuring songs from her album, Back to Black.


Amy Jade Winehouse (born 14 September 1983) is an English singer and
songwriter, known for her eclectic mix of various musical genres including R&B,
soul, jazz, rock & roll, and ska. Winehouse is best known for her soulful, powerful
contralto vocals.

Winehouse's 2003 debut album Frank was commercially and critically successful in
her native Britain. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Her 2006 follow-up
album Back to Black led to six Grammy Award nominations and five wins, tying the
record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night, and made Winehouse
the first British singer to win five Grammys, including three of the "Big Four": Best
New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year. On 14 February 2007, she
won a BRIT Award for Best British Female Artist; she had also been nominated for
Best British Album. She has won the Ivor Novello Award three times, one in 2004
for Best Contemporary Song (musically and lyrically) for "Stronger Than Me", one
in 2007 for Best Contemporary Song for "Rehab", and one in 2008 for Best Song
Musically and Lyrically for "Love Is a Losing Game", among other prestigious
distinctions.

Winehouse has been credited as being an influence in the rise in popularity of
female musicians and soul music.

Winehouse has received media attention apart from her singing. Her distinctive
style has been the muse for fashion designers such as Karl Lagerfeld. The singer's
problems with drug and alcohol addiction, as well as self-destructive behaviour,
have become regular tabloid news since 2007. She and her husband, Blake
Fielder-Civil, have been plagued by legal troubles that left him serving prison time
and a subsequent pending divorce. In 2008, Winehouse faced a series of health
complications that threatened both her career and her life.


Hot from her triumph at the Brits where she won Best British Female in a tough
field, Britain's best selling albums artist of 2007, Amy Winehouse, sashays into
Bayswater's illustrious Porchester Hall for a one-off concert featuring songs from
her hit album, Back to Black, including singles Rehab and You Know I'm No Good,
and 2003's Mercury Music Prize-nominated album, Frank.
