So without version info it is pretty annoying, not knowing is it the latest version they have now or an older one, I know it cant be latest version by your upload date if you still have access please upload newest version: I tried to download it and it wants me to register to some stupid site that I never heard of before it will let me. I don't do that for anyone just to download something its a complete waste of my time and I value my time more than that, if they wanted me to use their mod they would not require such ridiculous measures just to download it. My only hope is someone that has the time to register and go through all the crap will upload it on torrent site."
