A collection of wonderful choral music from across the centuries including music by Byrd, Tallis, Allegri, Tavener and Gorecki sung by the wonderful Sixteen conducted, as ever, by Harry Christophers.

PS. If you enjoy this then check out the Sacred Music (BBC) series I have uploaded as this also features Harry and the boys (and girls).



Enjoy and Seed!!
