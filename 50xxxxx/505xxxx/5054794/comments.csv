Please help"
[T],Harrharrr,2010-01-21T04:56Z,"If it keeps crashing u need to turn down the graphic settings. Its quite easy to see it was a low budget game when beeing made, iw seen better graphics on games from the early 2000's. Its really to bad a game like this along side the truck tycoon series whould be awesome."
,LukeT14,2010-02-17T02:12Z,works great. Thanks ez.
,BonQuiQui,2010-08-12T07:10Z,"This torrent is good. The game works, I'd suggest for Vista users you launch it in XP mode. That fixed the crashing for me.

However, the torrent aside, the game itself is horrible. The graphics are depressing and dull. The controls are overly simple. It feels more like an alpha test for a physics engine than a game."
