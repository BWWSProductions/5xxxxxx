,cfnow,2009-08-17T06:26Z,OK so i reinstalled the program and the application was working but there is defiantly something wrong with the crack. 
,cfnow,2009-08-17T06:49Z,never mind there is nothing wrong with the crack after i reinstalled it i went on Rosetta stone and i installed my language CD then i went to the program files and i added the crack. i started Rosetta stone up again and it prompted me for the action code of my language i clicked activate later and it worked all the 4 units for my language were unlocked. thank you very much for this torrent.
,OverZOcean,2009-08-17T09:40Z," Hello everybody, Rosetta Stone V3 is a perfect program for learning languages- I'll be grateful for having Rosetta Stone V3 TURKISH here. If smb. has it please upload to thepiratebay.org TNX :)"
,afgjas19,2009-08-19T05:34Z,does anyone have rosetta stone for hindi v3? 
,ivandrago293,2009-08-23T05:27Z,Works perfect no problem at all thanks!!
,Arg_the_pirate,2009-08-27T18:38Z,"Great upload, Penumbre! 

And to first time foreign language learners: Please use Rosetta Stone as a supplement only to learning. You will still have to combine that with self study and, if possible, tutoring classes so you can become more advanced and even reach fluency."
,froless,2009-09-01T21:18Z,"I can't seem to install it. I even tried to as admin, but every time, when the DOS looking window pops up, it gives me a message saying along the lines of:

 There was a program run part of the installation that did not work.

It gives me no clues as to why it won't work. No numbers, or any possible reason. Just that something isn't working. Is the file faulty?"
,jongas,2009-09-18T19:56Z,"he he its amazing, how people want everything here and now :-) and have little patience getting things working.

glad to see you got it working man!"

,niklopez98,2009-10-07T02:47Z,why is lesson 3 and 4 on disc 1 locked? I can't complete disc one??
,niklopez98,2009-10-07T03:06Z,actually all the rest of disc 1 is locked the only part that I was able to complete were the first 2 lessons in the core lesson 1? Anyone know why that might be? I opened a view of all lessons and they all have a lock on them....it won't let me continue and keeps asking me for a key even though I'm saying i'll activate later it still doesn't work.
,lumpy1975,2009-10-08T02:47Z,Thanks a million
,kamil7123,2009-10-14T04:54Z,"hey i installed the program , right after that i put in the pach, then i installed my language and when i start the program it just lags when i try to log in my username for the first time and does nothing.

,johnnyfortner,2009-10-27T19:23Z,"this does not work, if i got to prefrences on the top right the only option is activate(i should see install language file) and also the only thing i see on the screen is install language file and when i press it, it says theirs no cd(ive mounted and burned a language)"
,s0phie,2009-11-01T20:47Z,"Download was fast, installation was a breeze, and the program works great. Thanks for the torrent!"
,brig2009,2009-11-20T00:22Z,"If anyone gets annoyed with the update screen: (you will still have to skip the activation screen)

(I did this in XP but there should be a similar way to do this with other OS's)

In control panel > security center > windows firewall > exceptions (tab)

Deselect Rosetta Stone (both) from accessing the internet.

,meytipeyti,2010-09-03T22:19Z,The installer tries to put a trojan downloader in your temp folder ! All fatal errors and unexpected terminations are because of that because it interferes with normal installation .
