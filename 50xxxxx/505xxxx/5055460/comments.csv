  Due to a bug in all new NI Updaters The Standalone Versions MUST of been previously Install or the updater will fail installed.      

Does this mean you have to install the 32GB Komplete5 download first?"

,Reptile151,2011-01-22T08:35Z,"Works just fine for me, however, when I open Massive in FL Studio, I am unable to change the size of the plug-in window, or scroll down, and the plug-in window is so large that in goes off-screen halfway through, so I cannot access the lower half of the plug-in. I've tried everything I can think of, and this is driving me insane. Any ideas or solutions? "
,rybones,2011-02-14T01:17Z,"Do not download this file, the 1.1.4 update conatins the 'mministub.exe' trojan horse, DO NOT download."
,beezus_christ,2011-02-17T08:22Z,Can we get version 1.1.5?
,JudasX8792,2011-03-15T22:43Z,"I finally figured out how to get the exe working and how to fix the r00 issue. 

First download the torrent as you would. Then when all the littl rar files are finished you have to open each and every one of them and ""click and drag"" out the zip files. You can do this in the same folder if you want. Once you have r00 - r21 (I think that's the last one might be wrong) then click the 1.1.3. exe found in one of the files and install, then just click the 1.1.4. exe to update. Scan it into FL or whatever and there you go."

,ShapeBox,2011-09-13T01:07Z,Why the fuck is it zipped in such a spastic way?
,zvxxczz,2011-10-23T11:06Z,"Instructions:

1. Select all of the .zip files that were downloaded and then extract to one folder.
2. Open the first .r00 file and drag ""Massive 1.1.3 Setup.exe"" and ""Massive 1.1.4 Update.exe"" out to a folder.

,gorillabiscuits,2012-04-21T17:04Z,"Reptile151, i don't know what's wrong with the VST not being resizable, but a way around it would be to go into your computer's properties and change your screen resolution.  "
