i have core 2 duo 2.66 Ghz intel processor,2 GB RAM,1 GB geforce 9400 graphic card,free space in installation directory of 10 GB.

1.i downloaded the game.
2.extracted the iso image using magic iso.
3.i double click on install.exe .
4.the install wizard starts the installation process.
but after 3 seconds,this appears up out of the blue:

1628:failed to complete installation.

desperately want to play this game.

i also looked up on the error ""1628"" where it was said that i needed to delete my temp files,end task my another installation process going on without my knowing from the process tab in task manager."

,diseased7,2009-08-18T06:33Z,"This seems good to me. works on my computer. just seems a little bit slow to load. but other than that great game, thanks for upload :)"
,kok10,2009-08-18T16:10Z,"Alfonso9 may be u should try to install the game by exiting ur anti virus or security suite.

it worked for me.

my stupid kaspersky was the one which was stopping the installation on it's tracks.

and the game works perfectly."
,Alfonso9,2009-08-18T18:00Z,"Yep, Kaspersky was my culprit as well. "

,djflash5455,2009-08-19T23:15Z,i have tried xpadder before and cant get on with it. the only weird thing is that it works on all my other games and in the readme for the game it says the xbox 360 pad is plug and play.

,tomto,2009-09-12T13:27Z,it works perfectly but at the end of an innings when i swap from fielding to batting or vice versa it goes into sleep or hibernate on my laptop even plugged in and once i power back up and windows resumes i can hear the game running in the background with sound but its minimised and nothing on the desktop can be clicked only way out is to Ctrl Alt Delete but then all i get is game not responding in task manager. i have to kill process to get any other pc functionality back therefore crashing game :( i swear first time i ran game it let me do both innings fine..... wierd. ANY HELP????
,tomto,2009-09-18T00:03Z,@suvomania ...sounds like similar problem - i have hp pavillion laptop too 4gb ram and dedicated 1gig graphic card. runs all games like crysis at full tilt but this takes while to load then sends pc to sleep after roughly 5 overs......

,shinny24,2009-09-29T06:15Z,"dear AiTB, here my kindly request

Ashes Cricket 2009 patch 1.1 crack needed (link for patch here)

To avoid pirates, Codemasters and Transmission Games launched their patch at this link:

http://www.planetcricket.net/forums/ashe...http://www.planetcricket.net/forums/ashes-cricket-2009-forum/ac09-patch-open-beta-1-released-download-here-


It was launched last week as v1.1 and it fixes immense number of bugs such as:

1) Windows 7 long loading times
2) Anti aliasing support for PC
3) Improved AI with a lot of realism
4) Easier to take wickets through lbws and bowled outs
5)beta 2 also released last night with online features
Maybe big teams like razor1911 and reloaded did not know about this as it was exclusively launched at Planetcricket.net but this will help every single person who own Ashes Cricket 2009 in a MAJOR way.

*NOTE: Installing this patch will say not compatible with this version to ALL cracked versions, use the original exe you get with the dvd, then patch it, BUT no crack is available yet so someone please make a crack.

They are calling it beta but it's official patch they doing it to prevent it's piracy

PLEASE MAKE A CRACK FOR THIS PATCH"
,glasswings21,2009-09-29T20:05Z,Yes the patch crack is much awaited and though its very handy as well because it FIXES so many issues within the game itself so the crack for the patch would be amazing to get!
,Teflon_Don,2009-11-03T04:53Z,Can you upload 'Cricket Revolution'    plzz and Thank you
,jamesyyy,2009-12-24T11:30Z,"hey i cant seem to get mine working
when i open the file, all there is are a heap of files called rdl-ac09.r01 and then r02 and so on, does anyone know how to get the game started and working??
thank you"
,poppy20,2009-12-26T18:18Z,"jameyyy - what you have to do is burn each file onto an individual DVD (use 1x speed or it won't work) and then load them into your computer one after another. Then press Alt-F4 five times and hit Enter.

Alternatively, learn how to google."
,kvnr1991,2009-12-28T06:30Z,how t download this can any one help please!!!!!!

Use winrar (free) to open rdl-ac09.r01 and extract the contents into a folder, then run the setup from the extracted folder."

,baju23,2011-01-02T15:27Z,No need of install?????
,bellicov,2011-01-13T18:27Z,"The game works. But the crack seems to be pretty bad as the fps drops to as low as 11 during boundaries and replays. Avg fps is around 25. Res is 1280x1024, max settings. Hardware is Phenom II X4 965, HD 5770, 4GB RAM, which is way too good for this game. Demo runs fine at 60fps constant with vsync on."
,betonin,2011-02-28T18:08Z,damn my player runs only half the pitch whilst taking a single run....Is it a bug in the game shit some one help me plz....
,cricket4ever,2011-03-06T16:18Z,"This torrent does not come with a full liscense from the PCB. So I say keep downloading it from torrent sites then by your serial key and enter it in, till codemasters freaking learns to get the liscense from all the clubs. dammit!!!!!! although i think i should use someone elses game patch. i mean how does it go from 14 mb to 29 mb. Hunh??????"
,BADBOTTOM,2011-06-28T20:39Z,"One of the best cricket games to date. the online play is awesome.
BUT one stupid error Codemasters made!
There is no chat available at all !! :(
If you play online please e-mail me on ddbakewell33@gmail.com
We can arrange chat or calls with googleTalk.
My ashes username is slogger. thanks
Hope to get in touch with fellow cricket lovers "
