Willy is terrified about moving into the familyâ€™s new house. Heâ€™s convinced itâ€™s

filled with evil space aliens out to get him. In response to his wish for

someone to save him, Gooby comes to life as a loveable, full-size, scraggly,

orange, furry creature who in fact seems more frightened of the world than

Willy. The two have hair-raising adventures and learn something about the

power of friendship. In the end, Gooby fulfills Willyâ€™s initial wish by bringing

Willy and his dad together in a touching and exciting climax.
