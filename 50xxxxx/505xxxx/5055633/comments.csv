[T],verifire,2009-08-16T17:04Z,"@ sistromo: How can you say a thing like that. What do you know about it?
It just makes me sad when every Christian that doesn't wear sack-clothes and eat dog food automatically is branded a ""Bible-merchant"".
Too many are just that, but not everybody. Thankfully.

But it never fails: Nearly every Christian torrent is immediately branded and mocked.

And the Bible says it's a proof of the difference of a Christian and the world. That Christians do not belong to this world, but another Kingdom..

Thanks for being you, Indian."
,mximus,2009-08-16T18:05Z,I find it hypocritical that devout Christians post and download pirated media. Aren't you supposed to be afraid of hell?
[T],verifire,2009-08-17T14:46Z,"@mximus: I've given this matter quite a bit of thinking, being an uploader of such myself, and I found out that the Word of God says ""for nothing you've received it. Now freely give [it]"" (Meaning the teachings and gifts and Words of God).

And Peter says in Acts that ""We must obey God more than humans"".

So who are the lawbreakers? Is it the ones trying to make money on the Word of God, or is it those who use their money on spreading the very same Word?

And @ plaasjapie: There is a God. Deal with it. :-)"
[T],IndianChristian,2009-08-17T19:19Z,"As I mentioned in one of my earlier torrents, everyone is hungry for the grace of God. That is why people like sistromo keep coming back for more...truly truly it is amazing grace.....

don't worry sistromo...the bible says if you seach for him with all your heart, you will definitely find the God of the Bible, the creator of the Universe and everything in it."

[T],verifire,2009-09-02T12:42Z,"Hi, Indian. Yeah, of course the movie about Francisco de Assisi is a movie about a so called ""Catholic Saint"". But he did the opposite of what the ""Mother Church"" made practice, with making themselves rich and powerful through fear of the ""god"" they propagated. He went the other way, poor as the people he tried to help, and had to go to the ""pope"" to see if he could find any error in his approach to the Bible. The pope couldn't. Smart move by Fransisco, since they would've burned the ""Franciscans"" on the stake if he'd not, probably. What the Franciscans are doing today, though, I don't know, but I suggest reading the 2nd chapter in Romans, from verse 6-16. That should help to get us not to be so high and mighty in our judgment..

The Cross and the Switchblade is a Hollywood production, and as such it's not exactly like hearing Nicky Cruz telling his own story, which you can, online, at:

I'll tell you what it is, hell is all those pitiful dimbulbs that believe in virgin birth, walking on water, eternal din of harps and trumpets and damnation for strumpets along with all the other modes of blithering superstitious crap they say it's a virtue to 'believe' in. Them's the main occupants of hell. Ok, the secret is out. "

,theone-11,2010-04-30T19:47Z," This religion, cloaked in mystery and secrecy, has captivated the imaginations of scholars for generations.  Many facts discovered sheds vital light on the cultural dynamics that led to the rise of Christianity.  The National Geographic Society?s book ?Great Religions of the World,? page 309 writes; ?By Jesus? time, East and West had mingled here for three centuries.  Down columns of boulevards walked Roman soldiers loyal to the Persian god Mithras.? Mithras was a Persian deity.  He was also the most widely venerated god in the Roman Empire at the time of Jesus.  The Catholic Encyclopedia as well as the early Church Fathers found this religion of Mithras very disturbing, as there are so many similarities between the two religions, as follows: 



1)  Hundreds of years before Jesus, according to the Mithraic religion, three Wise Men of Persia came to visit the baby savior-god Mithra, bring him gifts of gold, myrrh and frankincense.

2)  Mithra was born on December 25 as told in the ?Great Religions of the World?, page 330; ??it was the winter solstice celebrated by ancients as the birthday of Mithraism?s sun god?.

3)  According to Mithraism, before Mithra died on a cross, he celebrated a ?Last Supper with his twelve disciples, who represented the twelve signs of the zodiac. 

4)  After the death of Mithra, his body was laid to rest in a rock tomb.

5)  Mithra had a celibate priesthood.

6)  Mithra ascended into heaven during the spring (Passover) equinox (the time when the sun crosses the equator making night and day of equal length). 



As you can now see, Christianity derived many of its essential elements from the ancient religion of Mithraism.   Mithraism became intertwined with the cult of Jesus to form what is known today as ?Christianity.? Although literary sources on this religion are sparse, an abundance of material evidence exists in the many Mithraic temples and artifacts that archaeologists have found scattered throughout the Roman Empire, from England in the north and west to Palestine in the south and east.  The temples were usually built underground in caves, which are filled with an extremely elaborate iconography (illustrating by pictures, figures and images).  There were many hundreds of Mithraic temples in the Roman Empire, the greatest concentrations have been found in the city of Rome itself.
This son of a god born of a virgin, was so commonly spread in those days that Philo of Alexandria (30 BCE - 45 CE), warned against this widespread superstitious belief in unions between male gods and human females. The offspring?s are known as demigods.



We often hear about how many of the traditions, rites and symbols of modern day ""Christian"" holidays have their roots in paganism. Have you ever wondered why December 25th was chosen to celebrate the birth of Jesus? Could it only be a consequence that ancient paganism and the story of Mithras' birth coincides with the Yule/Christmas season? If the accounts in the Bible are correct, the time of Jesus birth would have been closer to mid-summer, for this is when shepherds would have been ""tending their flocks in the field "" and the new lambs were born. Strange enough, the ancient pagan religion, Mithraism, which dates back over 4,000 years, also celebrated the birth of their ""saviour"" on December 25th. Franz Cumont, who is consider by many to be the leading research authority on Roman Paganism, explained the ancient religion called Mithraism. 

 Then Mithras returned to the earth to teach humanity His commandments and begin Mysteries and Rites which would help humans remember His acts on our behalf. Because of His actions, we can choose good without the overwhelming power of evil, even though evil's influence can still seem powerful because our minds believe it is. Because of His teachings, we know that the purpose of our lives is to serve others in the name of Mithras. The followers refer to Him as the ""Light of the World"" a phrase often used also in Christian faith when referring to Jesus."
