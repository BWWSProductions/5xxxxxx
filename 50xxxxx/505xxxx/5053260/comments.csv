,troy69,2009-08-14T21:15Z,"I don't get it, what is it this app does? It sounds like preview but I doubt it's just that?"
,chillin69x,2009-08-14T21:23Z,"I believe it's a program that takes a scanned document with text and turns the document into an editable document. 
Someone tell me if I'm correct.

Also, ""polisdavid"", you're one of the best Mac torrent providers. Thank you from the Lone Star State."
[V],polisdavid,2009-08-14T23:12Z,"Thank you chillin69x I really appreciate tat comment, and you're exactly right, this app takes scanned documents, locked PDFs, or photos and converts the text into editable formats.

And sorry about the photo, it's say's 9.0 Pro, but it's the best one I could find."
