,JGriswold,2009-08-17T04:48Z,"@wolfy -- Thank you for the torrent. Bens work is awesome. Could you please seed the act file and the readme again. I dont think anyone on this torrent had them. Thank you.

I just jump started this torrent. Everyone was stuck at 19.3% with no seeders. I have the whole iso , but not the readme or the activation files. So i dont show as a seeder. I will try and stay on long enough to get some people up higher. Everyone please seed for a while after your download is done.

Thanks

Unless someone re-ups the readme and activation files you will stay at 99.8 or 99.9 %. I didnt have them when I jump started this by seeding about 30gigs of the iso image. When you get to 99.8, you already have the full iso image. Just not the readme and act. check your files, its there.

Wolfy posted his activation in a separate torrent. Check Applications and search ""darker"" without quotation marks. Its the same one.

i have no idea what was in the readme. But I imagine it went something like this:
