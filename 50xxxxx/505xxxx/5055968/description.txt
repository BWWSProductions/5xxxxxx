Kite Liberator is the sequel to "KITE" (ã‚«ã‚¤ãƒˆ), though many prefer to call it a spin off as it doesn't really follow the continuing story of the characters from KITE.

PLOT: Years after the events that transpired in Kite, Sawa's whereabouts are a mystery. During this time, rumors of a new killer have begun to circulate the city. They call her the Angel of Death, an unfeeling assassin who eliminates her targets with grace and precision, leaving only a flurry of feathers as her calling card.
