I Miss The Hip Hop Shop by Proof.  Proof was a longtime friend of Marshall Mathers (Eminem) and an important member of D12.  He was shot in a club on April 11, 2006 R.I.P.

All tracks are pre-ordered and named, ready to put into iTunes or whatever program.  

I myself was looking to get this album, but there was only one on the whole torrenting network, and no seeds!  I got lucky and found a source, so I will share!

PLEASE don't let that happen again, and SEED as much as possible. I will seed this until I die, seriously.
