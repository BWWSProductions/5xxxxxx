The Rink (1916)


The Rink was Charlie Chaplin's 8th film for Mutual Films. It co-starred Edna Purviance, Eric Campbell, Henry Bergman and Albert Austin. It is best known for showcasing Chaplin's roller skating skills.

"The Rink" (Released December 4, 1916), the eighth Mutual comedy, was based on a Karno Company sketch called "Skating" that was written by Charlie's brother, Syd Chaplin. Chaplin was often inspired by the business of serving food and here he ends up a waiter who ends up in a rollerskating rink trying to keep upright. Of course, if you have aleady seen "Modern Times" you know that Chaplin in a vertuoso on wheels when it comes to rollerskating. This time around Edna Purviance is the Girl, while Eric Campell is one of her admirers, Mr. Stout, and Henry Bergman plays both Mrs. Stout and an angry diner (you can imagine what Charlie does to make a diner angry). In terms of the slapstick, "The Rink" is the most creative of the Mutual two-reelers.
