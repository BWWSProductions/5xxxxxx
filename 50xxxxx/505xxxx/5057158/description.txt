DESTROYER 112 - Brain Storm

Approximate Running Time: 6 hours


The computer world is always evolving, but now it logs on trouble for CURE. Dr. Harold Smithâ€™s own meticulously organized neural files are covertly copied, analyzed and downloaded by an amazing new interface system.

Soon all of CUREâ€™s deepest secrets are under control of a shadow force. Not only Remo but even the Master of Sinanju have been accessed and installed. Now they are virtual puppets on a hard drive, slicing and dicing for the enemy at the touch of a keystroke.

And in the next step, a supersecret organization begins experimenting with the Destroyer downloads to unleash an unimaginable threatâ€”the Fourth Reich.
