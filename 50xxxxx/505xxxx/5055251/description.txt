Description: In the final days of WWII, a seventeen-year-old boy wanders the countryside. He is captured by Soviet troops, then released, then captured once more - after he has donned a German uniform for warmth - and imprisoned at a remote barracks, where he strikes up an unlikely friendship with a young Russian soldier.

Directed in the beginnings of MiklÃ²s JancsÃ²â€™s carrier, this film has all the elements that will lead to his fame: incredible estheticism in sequence shots, perfect mastering of space-time organization, filled with the obsessing figure of a Hungarian plain that seems to annihilate mankind and, last but not least, a constant reflection on the absurdity of war and the changing balances of power between people.
