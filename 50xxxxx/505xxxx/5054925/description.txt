Phillip Roth's biting satire of middle-class Jewish life is brought to the screen in Larry Peerce's poignant dramedy. Richard Benjamin (who later went on to star in another Roth adaptation, PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT) makes his film debut as Neil Klugman, a poor librarian from the Bronx who falls in love with Jewish American Princess Brenda Patimkin (Ali MacGraw, also making her film debut). The cross-class love affair displeases Brenda's well-to-do Westchester family and Neil soon finds himself plunged into a maelstrom of class snobbery and elitism that threatens to overwhelm the relationship.
