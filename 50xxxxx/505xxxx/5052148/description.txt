Central coast bass urdan adventures, a segment I love because it reminds me of being a kid. Looking for any body of water to fish, going thru mud or trees to try and find water to fish. I will try for bass, but if I can't find them I will try and catch any species and teach how we caught them. To download all our shows in one place check out centralcoastbass.com, please seed for our fishing community, enjoy.
