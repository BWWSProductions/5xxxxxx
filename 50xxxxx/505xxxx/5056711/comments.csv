,invisibleninja,2009-10-07T21:44Z,"my only questions here are: is this dvdrip or hdtv captures? and why is episode 8 double sized? thanks, and great work!"
,bondoMaga,2011-04-10T21:44Z,"Is this the Region 1 or the Region 2 DVD release?

(Region 2 has the original uncut versions of episodes 1, 2, and 3--instead of the cut-down versions originally broadcast on BBC and released on the Region 1 DVD set).

Thanx... "
