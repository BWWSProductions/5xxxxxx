,wrick3000,2009-08-17T00:36Z,To your greatest surprise. YOU CAN PLAY ONLINE WITH THIS ONE in codies server. LOL.
,asif_opsori,2009-08-17T10:05Z,can u please seed...i m desperate to play this game
,wrick3000,2009-08-17T13:48Z,Sorry guys my net connection gone down for some times. It is back now.
,onikrulz,2009-08-17T17:28Z,"Each time I click on the game's .exe file it gives an error report. It only works when I connect internet and then click on it. Even the crack. I want a crack that lets me run the game with internet OFF, like every other game"
,wrick3000,2009-08-18T00:55Z,"@onikrulz
 GOD knows what are you talking about. I never faced that problem with my game. And another thing you are most probably not using my full uploaded game because i am the only seeder still now. So don't complain about another source in here. And if you only downloaded the crack from here maybe then your game got some problem."
,onikrulz,2009-08-18T09:05Z,"There's a nicer way of saying that, anyways, is this one the same reloaded crack that's 29mb when extracted? If not could you kindly give a separate link to your crack file no offence intended by my previous post I spoke generally about 2 reloaded cracks I tried from diff sourcesthat won't run unless my internet is connected. :-D"
,wrick3000,2009-08-18T12:57Z,Try out gamecopyworld. And ya this the reloaded crack that I found after mounting the image.
,onikrulz,2009-08-18T16:27Z,"I downloaded this one's torrent and only the crack folder from this page, same crack 29mb Reloaded one but I don't know why Ashes Cricket 2009 is the only game for me that gives error report unless I connect internet. Even with your crack it works only when internet is on can you tell me how I can fix that? Does your one work when internet is disconnected?"
,wrick3000,2009-08-18T20:13Z,For your sake I unplugged my modem wire from my PC and started the game it ran smooth. So it may be your copy problem. Download this version as a whole and then test.
,onikrulz,2009-08-19T04:21Z,"Thanks for checking and confirming bro. Strangely, even the official demo from Codemasters site gave error report on .exe without internet. :'("

,wrick3000,2009-08-20T04:22Z,"@onikrulz 
I think your firewall is blocking you."
,wrick3000,2009-08-20T04:26Z,"@utkursha
Unistall the game first then follow the step.
1. Download Daemon Tools
2. Mount the image with deamon tools.
3. Install the game in C or any other drive you wish.
4. Copy the crack from crack folder and paste it to installation directory and replace it.
5. Play the game.

If this doesn't work then download my version fully and then try."
