,enok1976,2009-09-13T23:00Z,If u install nortons u have no idea about computers. Norton is the most bloated program u could ever run on a computer. put free avg on your computer you can find that at download dot com and if u have xp make sure to download windows free windows defender. vista and 7 already comes with defender. these two programs will run fabulous on your system and wont slow ur computer down. nortons will. plus these two programs will give you all the protection u need.
