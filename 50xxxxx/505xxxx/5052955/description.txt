The is the 1st disc of a 6 disc limited edition set. I have scanned the cover which is the same for
front and back of the box. I have omitted the 80 page book that is included with the set because it
would take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad enough then buy the box set. I will upload one
disc a day. This set is a combination of the soundtrack and follow up album with the exception Ten
Years After and Rock and Soul Music by Country Joe and the Fish.

Although I was old enough to be at Woodstock, I was not there. However, I was lucky enough to see Janis
Joplin two months before she died. I saw a few other groups during that time period but stopped going
to concerts after a riot broke out when Sly and the Family Stone failed to appear for a free outdoor
performance in Chicago on August 9, 1970. I have some pics of the riot just as it started but I cannot
find them.

If you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.

Please help seed these torrents. Enjoy.

their time and bandwidth to bring you the finest quality rips in flac
