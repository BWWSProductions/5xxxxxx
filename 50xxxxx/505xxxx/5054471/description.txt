Amazing good quality movie

Zulu is one of the great movies, an epic adventure of courage in the face of 
incredible odds. 
Based on a true story it tells the amazing tale of 100 British soldiers who 
stood fast against an owerwhelming force of 4000 of the Zulu nation`s migthiest 
warriors in the deffence of Rorkes Drift in 1879.



On the January 22nd 1879 the British Army suffered one of its worst defeats when 
Zulu forces massacred 1,500 of its troops at Isandlhwana. A short time after the 
main battle a Zulu force numbering in excess of 4000 warriors advanced on a 
British hospital and supply dump guarded by 139 Welsh infantrymen. 
The film concentrates on this bloody 12 hour battle during which the British force, 
under their commander from the Royal Engineers who happened to be in the area
 building a bridge and happened to be senior to the infantry officer, won 11 Victoria Crosses. 
While taking some liberties with history the film follows reality fairly closely, 
including matching exactly the identities of the VC winners
