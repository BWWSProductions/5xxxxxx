,ryanspeck,2009-09-18T13:50Z,"The subtitles on this blow. If anyone tries to tell you that they're in ""English"", they're lying. One of the worst translations I've ever seen."
,DonDuracell,2009-12-05T16:51Z,"I agree to what ryanspeck said. The subtitles are terrible.
Audio and video quality are very good but that's it."
,brandsy,2010-02-02T18:11Z,"dont download this version the a and v are realy good and so is the movie but the dubbing totaly spoils it. if you want to watch this, watch it with subitles (which i wish i had done)"
