Jean-Michel Cousteau: Ocean Adventures
2008 1 of 2

A generation ago, Jacques-Yves Cousteau revealed the oceans' mysteries to millions of landlocked PBS television viewers, and inspired a groundswell of public awareness of the unique problems faced by the world's marine environments. Now, 30 years later, Jacques' son Jean-Michel Cousteau and his expedition team have set sail to explore dangerous and spectacular locales across the globe in the high-definition series, Jean-Michel Cousteau: Ocean Adventures, premiering with the film Voyage to Kure.


In this two-part episode, the Ocean Adventures team explores the Amazon, the most powerful of the world's rivers. Flowing through the world's largest tropical rainforest -- the most biodiverse region on the planet -- the Amazon is endangered, and it has the potential to alter global climate. Twenty-five years ago, Jean-Michel Cousteau explored the Amazon. Since that time, an area almost the size of Texas has been deforested. Cousteau and his team return to gather information on how this has affected the region and the planet and how it may continue to impact our world.
