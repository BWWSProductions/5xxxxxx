 "Watchmen" is set in an alternate 1985 America in which costumed             
 superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the "Doomsday    
 Clock" - which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union - is           
 permanently set at five minutes to midnight. When one of his former          
 colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked          
 vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all     
 past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former               
 crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of   
 whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing      
 conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences     
 for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity... but who is        
 watching the Watchmen?"
