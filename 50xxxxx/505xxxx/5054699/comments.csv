See, when we search for a specific movie title that you included in one of your info links, (unrelated though it may be to the torrent itself) -- all your unrelated shit turns up when we search for that specific title.

So, no... I'm NOT pleased to see ""District 9"" in the search results when I was looking for ""Ice Age"".

You fucktard, STOP ADVERTISING YOUR TORRENTS!! If your vids are good, your reputation will be spread by ""word of mouth"". Let axxo be your guide.

People like you are turning Pirate Bay into a fucking spammy advertisement center for your other torrents."

you stinkin, boob-shakin' sperm-sucker!!

extremezone was doing a good job for us and it would be very nice if you'd treat him with the respect he or she  deserves. If you're molested by the adds, fine, tell him on a friendly way!

Or just check the box ""search titles only"" when you're looking for a specific movie, you bump!"
