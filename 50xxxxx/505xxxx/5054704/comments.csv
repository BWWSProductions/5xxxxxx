[T],jmb2012,2009-08-15T16:37Z,"Lost 700 gigs of movies, music and pics, im pissed.
Now I need to make for it.:) downloading everything I see, fuck it."
,iShare4u,2009-08-17T05:00Z,"Your deliberate promotion of links to other movies that are TOTALLY unrelated to the movie on this page degrades the validity of The Pirate Bay's search engine.

See, when we search for a specific movie title that you included in one of your info links, (unrelated though it may be to the torrent itself) -- all your unrelated shit turns up when we search for that specific title.

So, no... I'm NOT pleased to see ""District 9"" in the search results when I was looking for ""Ice Age"".

You fucktard, STOP ADVERTISING YOUR TORRENTS!! If your vids are good, your reputation will be spread by ""word of mouth"". Let axxo be your guide.

People like you are turning Pirate Bay into a fucking spammy advertisement center for your other torrents."
,meikochan,2009-08-17T12:41Z,"Then just ""CHECK"" the (search titles only) i hate you people who are just too lazy to read ""1"" page to be able to GET FREE MOVIES, it's just too fucking annoying to not apreciate what the uploaders do, without uploaders you would not even be able to attain any of these movies ""FOR FREE"" fucking asshole !"
,meikochan,2009-08-17T12:43Z,"In short I FUCKING HATE YOUR KIND ""ISHARE4U"""
,bakalakaka,2009-08-19T01:48Z,"iShare4u you are just bitching to be bitching. most ""normal"" people would think ""hey, free movies, fucking score!"" but no not you just being a little girl ""aw, my hand hurts from the slight amount of scrolling"". what a bitch"
,The.Norse.Crown,2009-09-08T04:00Z,"Fuck that, I agree with Ishare4u. extremezone IS a fucktard who regurgitates other peoples work so he can feel like he has a purpose in life. If I am looking for a spanish copy of aliens in the attic what makes one think that I would care about these other movies? They are'nt even in spanish! It's one thing to be part of the scene, it's entirly another to think you ARE the scene!"
