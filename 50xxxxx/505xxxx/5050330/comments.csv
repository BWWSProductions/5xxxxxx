This cat has been making mp3 into !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4999926/Various_Artists_-_Greatest_Hits_Of_The_Millennium_-_VBR_V0% 5D% 5BMp3_"
,Mitch_Bainwol,2009-08-14T03:36Z,"This is a very strange list.

Rick Astley? Really?

#  Euson - Both Sides Now

One of the all time greatest songs. I think it involved Joni Mitch and Judy Collins.

Who the fuck is Euson?

# Captain Jack - Captain Jack

Billy Joel's song sung by whom?

etc. This is a torrent for picking out songs."
,Dutchman01,2009-09-21T17:15Z,"Nice torrent, where are seeders???"
,Mickey2Much,2009-09-26T11:47Z,"Please seed, I'm currently stuck at 99,2%. I will name my 1'st child to the one which seeds it to 100%"
,scott_ehm,2009-10-04T22:40Z,"If you can't seed, why bother posting a torrent? Nice fucking model!"
,mikeceder,2009-10-05T13:42Z,"What the fuck!"" I am stuck at 99,8....a few songs incomplete. Is there any chance to complete this?

If you seed an incomplete torrent than why you seed it anyway...?"
,TheBlackPirate,2009-10-11T02:35Z,Hey Anonymous it's a very nice list! Please try to seed somehow....... thx a lot!
,tmaxx666,2009-11-05T04:41Z,This fucker has been smoking some BAD weed.  What a load of drivel !
,torgman1,2009-11-14T07:21Z,"Wait a second--This is supposed to be about the greatest hits of the millennium, yet it only covers half a century...wtf?!"
,silverex,2009-11-14T13:48Z,Tack!
,DannyWolf,2010-02-11T08:09Z,"Millenium? In 50 years? Phsyea right.
Also, no Metallica? No Ozzy? ONE Sabbath? Etc.? WTF???

@Mitch_Bainwol: Actually, that song was a big hit, internet memes to the contrary."
,hammerhammer,2010-02-26T09:16Z,"Another MP3 to Flac numbskull.  All these files are FLACs converted from 160kbs mp3s.  Thankfully I'd only downloeded a few tracks to test the torrent out, I feel sorry for the suckers who have downloaded the entire torrent, 9 gig of absolute garbage.  Sorry guys to break the bad news.  The uploader can go and fuck himself and get off the pirate bay, he's just doing the rest of us a dis-service. :("
,starshine99,2011-09-06T09:59Z,"This is fantastic, what a treasure trove.

Thank you so very very much.

Will be enjoying this for a long time.

Your the best!!!"
