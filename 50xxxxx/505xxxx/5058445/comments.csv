,MtMCooLBG,2009-08-19T05:44Z,"If any1 want configuration for specific version of the game and PVPGN server post your wishes.

As i guess there may be a lot of different wishes, so as soon as possible i will make a tutorial how to configure the game as you want ;)"

,dirtchamber,2010-02-23T04:21Z,Hey man. How can I get in touch with you about a solution for a custom pvpgn server? Thanks.
,MtMCooLBG,2010-04-12T20:08Z,"Sorry, I cant provide the the real solltion atm, but you can try this one:

0.) Before you go, make sure you have the game files patched with your desired patch that the PVPGN server requires. The whole patching procedure must be done on Windows. Then replace the old game folder (Warcraft III Headoff 1.21a.app/Contents/SharedSupport/cxchromium/support/chromium/drive_c/Program Files/) with the new one (that you'v patched on Windows).

1.) Go to 
Warcraft III Headoff 1.21a.app/Contents/SharedSupport/cxchromium/support/chromium

and open ""user.reg"" with TextEdit.

2.) Locate ""war3.headoff.com"" and replace it with your desired PVPGN server adress, without the quotes. Save the file.

The whole key looks like this: 
""Battle.net Gateways""=str(7):""1009\00000\0war3.headoff.com\0-2\0Headoff G.I.\0""

""Headoff G.I."" is the name in the server list that you see inside the game.

3.) Delete the ""Warcraft III Headoff"" folder (if you have it) in ""your_home_directory/Library/Application Support""

4.) Run the game."
