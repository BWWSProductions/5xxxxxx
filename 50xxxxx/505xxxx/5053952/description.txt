Jo (Barnaby Metschurat), a young doctor, begins his internship at a Berlin hospital filled with optimism and ambition. He is determined to become a member of the team headed by the renowned Professor MÃ¼ller-LaRousse (Herbert Knaup), who is in charge of a spectacular research project at the hospital. Together with a group of ambitious young doctors, Jo throws himself into his work ? the development of artificial muscle strands.

To circumvent tiresome monitoring by medical control boards, the project is propelled forward with dangerous experiments involving the researchers themselves as subjects. Jo realizes what he has gotten himself into, but at that point it's too late. MÃ¼ller-LaRousse is a fanatical member of the secret society of the Antihippocrats, and the increasingly threatening project has already claimed more than one victim. Could Jo be the next one?
