,th-mach,2009-08-15T14:53Z,Authors?  Titles?  Formats?  Brit lit could mean anything from Harry Potter to Victorian erotica to Chaucer.
,jotembi,2009-08-15T16:38Z,"OMG hope it's neither Harry Potter nor Victorian erotica ;)
dowloading anyway but at least a short description would be nice "
,Auslegung,2009-08-15T19:48Z,"Feedback?  Well, for one, seed after you post something.  Second, tell us what we are downloading.  Third, don't use rar, just use folders.  I know some will disagree but I think most people like seeing everything laid out.  

Strange, I've downloaded all your World Lit torrents and this one looks like it's a first-time poster's."
,th-mach,2009-08-16T00:15Z,"Use Karen's directory printer, freeware, and print the contents of the folder to a text file.  Copy the file into TPB.  Problem solved.  (You can find Karen's by googling it.)"
,Pirumyan,2009-08-16T20:22Z,"Ok guys, thanks for the feedback, i just didn't post anything cause i told you i had no time. i will have the list soon."
,Pirumyan,2009-08-16T21:10Z,"Ok guys here are the names of the authors/folders. Please I do welcome criticism but note that I am doing the best I can considering that I am in a ass backwards country regarding internet. 1 MBPS costs here 1200$!

,Auslegung,2009-08-17T19:19Z,"I've got 6mpbs upload for about $35, just get me a copy of it and I'll upload for as long as you want.  I think my share ratio on your others was over 20."
,Pirumyan,2009-08-18T07:58Z,"Wow, your lucky. Sure but how?"
,Auslegung,2009-08-18T16:39Z,"I'm not really sure how to do a direct connect, it looks like everyone's at 92% now so it should be fine after the next time you upload.

Note to everyone who's waiting to get 100%: please don't cut and run after you get 100%, get your share ratio of AT LEAST 1.0, or a couple of days, depending on how often people are downing it."
