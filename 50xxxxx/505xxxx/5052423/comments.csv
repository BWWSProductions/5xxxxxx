,agustintorre,2009-10-04T18:57Z,"Im having some problems and I dont know were else to post em:
The game installs just fine with out burning it or mounting it, but I try to play the game with out the crack and it says wrong dvd, thats fine just testing it, I apply the crack to the installed directory and it starts up to a black screen and I get this error:
Fastfile for zone 'code_post_gfx_mp' is corrupt or unreadable.
I think its because the game has been updated and the crack mabye no longer works, idk, but I just want to play the single player.

Solo game doesn't start. I click on ""new game"", choose difficulty and it goes back to menu..
What should I do? Thanks!
ps: and one more thing. When I first run the game menu doesn't have any letters.. It's blank buttons. then I push ctrl+alt+del, return to the app and it's ok.
something's definitely wrong but I have no idea what. Please help! =)"
,cherep63,2010-02-09T14:11Z,Forget it. I have a very old PC. Maybe it is the problem for this game. Though they were sayin' WaW has the same engine as the CoD 4 does.
