  Building on the Call of Duty 4 engine, Call of Duty: World at War thrusts 
  players into the ruthless and gritty chaos of WWII combat like never been 
  before, and challenges them to band together to survive the most harrowing 
  and climactic battles of WWII that led to the demise of the Axis powers on 
  the European and South Pacific fronts. The title re-defines WWII games by 
  offering an uncensored experience with unique enemies and combat variety, 
  including Kamikaze fighters, ambush attacks, Banzai charges and cunning 
  cover tactics, as well as explosive on-screen action through all new 
  cooperative gameplay.
