The alternate install CD allows you to perform certain specialist installations of Ubuntu. It provides for the following situations:

    * setting up automated deployments;
    * upgrading from older installations without network access;
    * LVM and/or RAID partitioning;
    * installs on systems with less than about 256MB of RAM (although note that low-memory systems may not be able to run a full desktop environment reasonably). 

In the event that you encounter a bug using the alternate installer, please file a bug on the debian-installer package. 




This is the official Ubuntu torrent. If you do not trust it, get the .torrent off MIT's website.
