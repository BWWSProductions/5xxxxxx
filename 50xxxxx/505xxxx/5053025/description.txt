About this encyclopedia

This is the most comprehensive overview available anywhere on the broad, multi-faceted and complex topic of pain â€“ and the rapidly evolving scientific and medical disciplines that seek to understand, assess and treat pain.

The Encyclopedia of Pain includes more than 3,000 entries and provides clear, detailed and up-to-date coverage of the current state of research, and treatment of pain. In addition, detailed essays provide in-depth information on all aspects of nociception and pain, including substrates, causes, pathophysiology, symptoms and signs, diagnoses and treatment. A thousand color figures enhance understanding of this too-little-understood topic.

Solidly structured and inclusive, this three-volume reference is an invaluable tool for clinical scientists and practitioners in academia, health care and industry, as well as students, teachers and interested laypersons.
