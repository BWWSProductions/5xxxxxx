,waveswing,2009-09-07T17:24Z,"Getting error saying:
""Found Offsets, please restart loader""

Please help!"
,Gades,2009-09-17T11:29Z,"where exactly do I have to copy the loader?
I mean, do I just copy it at

C:\Program Files\Artisteer 2\bin

Thanks!"
,FakeBuster,2009-09-19T21:33Z,"Same problem as above. I run loader and it starts then flashes up ""Found Offsets, please restart loader""
After that nothing happens - any help with this???"
,mster,2009-09-20T15:30Z,"-Loader should be put in yhe ""bin"" directory.
-Run loader.
-When/If you get the message:
""Found Offsets, please restart loader"" - Do that! (run loader again)
-And now it should work."
,mb0789,2009-10-04T22:57Z,Also make sure (if you're using Vista) that you always run it as an administrator.
,aharrr,2009-10-10T23:24Z,"I had written to say that this ran well without any virus's.  However, my new version of Avast has picked up the 'loader' as a virus and will no longer let it run.  

Now I am not sure if it is a virus or not but I did have lots of trouble with my PC and had to reformat the HD so it could be.

Any commens on this guys??"
,bioceptic,2009-10-20T03:41Z,"I get the same problem...Virus found

Is this safe???"
,DigitalIsland,2009-10-21T20:26Z,"Thank you! I did everything mentioned here, except that I had to start the loader like 5 times, but is working fine.
Do I have to start it with loader?
Do I have to keep Loader?"
,emaya77,2009-12-12T04:33Z,"Do I have to start the loader every time in order to use it? Because I closed the program and when I restarted it, it told me it was a trial. So, I closed it and restarted it with the loader and it started normally.

Also, I select DNN but in the export options DNN isn't there so I don't have the option to select DNN 4 or 5. Do you know why it isn't there?"
,Navirio,2009-12-13T14:45Z,hey ciber can you do artisteer 3 please?
,palatinux,2009-12-28T05:44Z,"Hello everyone. There is a new Artisteer version (2.3.0.21098)  + loader available here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5245728/

It is working and virus free. Have fun!
"
,emaya77,2009-12-29T19:44Z,"I have been using this Artisteer for a couple weeks now, but when I just went to run to loader to open it a couple minutes ago, I got a TROJAN notice from my AVG software. The 'loader.exe' file has a TROJAN, so be careful!"
,bravo444,2010-01-02T02:37Z,"I am using AVG9 and found TROJAN out after using a couple of weeks.  I tried to check this out with other virus softwares like Norton, McAfee, Virus Busters, F-Secure, Kaspersky, etc.
All other softwares didn't recognize the Loader.exe was a virus.  I am not sure this loader.exe is a virus or not really.  You have any ideas??  I guess that it is better to buy the license to use??"
