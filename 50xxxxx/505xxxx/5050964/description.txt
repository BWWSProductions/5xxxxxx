Pacific Coast Highway
(2004)

The history of the Pacific Coast Highway, which runs from California to Washington, includes comments by historians and engineers; and examines the technology that maintains the road through floods, earthquakes and landslides.

For twenty-five years construction crews dug, blasted, tunneled and bridged their way up America's western edge to create one of the world's great roads: The Pacific Coast Highway. Its construction was a monumental saga of perseverance, primal machines, convict labor and engineering brilliance. Keeping it up and running in the face of floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, and deadly landslides is an endless battle.

MODERN MARVELSÂ® puts the top down for a ride along the spectacular road, with diversions into its past and glimpses of the future. See how a revolutionary technology using molten zinc and electricity is giving aging bridges a new lease on life. Hear from a landslide expert about the ongoing fight to keep the road on stable ground. And scores of photos and rare footage capture the drama and ambition of the Herculean task that created the ultimate seaside drive.
