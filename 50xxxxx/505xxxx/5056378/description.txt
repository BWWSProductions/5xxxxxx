Thanks for downloading Lego(r) Rock Raiders!! I hope you enjoy.

How to use:

1 - Make sure you have the programs 'PowerISO' and 'WinRAR'. Google them if you 
want to install, I don't need to hold your hand for this.
2 - Right-Click the file 'Lego RR' after you've finished downloading the torrent,
and select 'Extract Files...', then select where you want to have the iso file
(the one that runs the game, I would suggest the Desktop for where to put it).
3 - Open the new folder that is there, and you should find this readme again, 
way to go champ. You'll also find the iso file 'LegoRockRaiders'. Right click
that file and go to the PowerISO menu, then select 'Mount Image to Drive [ ]'.
4 - Open the file 'Setup' and follow the ridiculously easy instructions from there.

Side note: I can guarantee that this works on Windows XP SP3, with Dx 10 graphics card. Anything with at least Dx 6 (basically everything since '98 came out) will have this. If you use Vista, good luck getting this to work, I can't say if it will or not. Check out some of the other torrents here and see if they have any better solutions if you want to get it working.


The torrent, readme, and iso files were all created by yours truely...

Legal Crap and Info:

---This is simply the image file of the CD, which I do own, and only put on 
The Pirate Bay for those of you who also own this game and would like a back 
up of the CD for your own private use, and not to be shared with any other
users, either physically, digitally, or otherwise. I do not own, nor
claim to own anything LEGO(r) related, and certainly not the rights to this
game. ---

Also: don't be an asshole an upload this like it were your own. *IF* the original
torrent is not active on The Pirate Bay, you should totally upload it, and keep
this awesome game out there!!
