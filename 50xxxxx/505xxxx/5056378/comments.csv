Hello to all of you old fans on Lego Rock raiders :)

As many of you may have noticed, this game will not run on windows 7 or vista saying that it cannot find the designated file: ""d3drm.dll""

I google'd it a bit and found a solution!

the 7th. comment. a guy who fixed this issue. simply follow his instructions, and you will be running!

Hope it's helpful for any people out there.

btw, thanks for uploading

UPDATE ^

Just an important tip to mention that the guy forgot:
If it does not work when you put the d3drm.dll in C:/Windows/System32, then just put it in the C:/Windows/system folder.

Anyways, cheers, i'm out."""
