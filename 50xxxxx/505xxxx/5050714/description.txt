The Solomon Treasures tells the story of the fascinating investigations into the lucrative trade of fake artefacts that have stained biblical history and the discipline of archaeology.

In the last few years biblical history has been turned upside down by a series of scandals. Investigators reveal that some of the most revered objects in Israel, and around the world, are in fact sophisticated fakes. The police suspect it may be the world's biggest ever antiquity fraud.

In 2001 a tablet which appeared to come from the Temple of Solomon was offered for sale to the Israel Museum. Scholars and scientists declared it genuine, but an official investigation revealed that the tablet was an elaborate fake. Authorities discovered that a highly-skilled gang had been producing high quality, fake biblical artefacts for more than 20 years and many museum collections around the world may now be in doubt.

The artefacts at the centre of these enquiries are of enormous significance. They are the only archaeological evidence for the biblical story of David, his son Solomon, and the other early kings, and the empire over which they ruled. There are no known archaeological sites, just a few priceless seals, tablets, and lamps, which date from the right period and carry inscriptions that match the Bible stories. The authenticity of these artefacts is now in question.
