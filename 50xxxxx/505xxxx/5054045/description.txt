You may have seen the hubble ultra deep field photo before, its a photo of a clear patch of sky that shows over 10,000 galaxies. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra_Deep_Field It is often called the most important image ever taken because it allowed scientists to estimate that there are over a 100 billion to 1 trillion galaxies in the universe.

However you probably haven't seen this one before.

I got this rarely seen before image like the hubble ultra deep field from a astronomer friend who has worked for nasa. Unfortunately it was perhaps a hundred times larger (and more impressive) then the HUDF and thus not widely circulated. But i spent today making a composite using the same technique as google earth, so you can view it in your browser quickly and using little bandwidth.

Every point of light in the image is an entire galaxy with billions of stars like our own.

Let me know what you think. PS. If you can help me identify the images origins that would be wonderful.
