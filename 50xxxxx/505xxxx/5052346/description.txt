Air The Virgin Suicides (320kbps)

Encoded Straight from the FLAC Enjoy...

100% Authentic



























==============================BITRATE TUTORIAL=================================
Below I will show you how to easily determine if an mp3 is truely 320 or just a re-encode...

You will need the torrent listed below to start then follow my steps... 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE

1. Open adobe audition and click on edit

2. Drag and Drop (or add) a mp3 file into adobe audition

3. Click on "View" and then Spectral Frequency Display (Shift+F)


A true 320 source will be 20Hz or above..

128 Re-encodes or 192 re-encodes will be stuck @ 16Hz or 18Hz...

Hope this clears some things up...


NOTE: There is an exception for this rule; oldies,acoustics,piano songs,and low volume music Will have lower frequencies even if encoded with 320!
