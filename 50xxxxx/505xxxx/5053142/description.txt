Fun game but was tricky getting it to run here's what i did:

first of will not run with windows 7 tryed it unsure about vista too. lucky for me got xp on other drive.

To extract the files i used Winrar.

this will make a bin/cue files    either mount the image or burn to a cd.

install the game then explore the cd for the FLT folder copy the exe fix out of there and paste into the games dir.

but note if youve burned to disc it still needs the cd to run.

hope this was helpful?

just heard works on vista.
