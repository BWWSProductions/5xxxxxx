,CheesusTehLord,2009-09-16T00:20Z,"works perfectly, at least torrent wise.
the game itself, not so much; it crashes if you minimize it and sometimes upon returning from a skirmish victory
the game itself was fine, though the computers are given an unfair advantage (more resources, faster tech, etc) rather than just making them smarter
also, i didnt scan for viruses so idk"
