Sup all... Well it looks like we will have another ""unofficial"" Lil Wayne mixtape 
on the way... This upcoming tape is called ?The Leak Reloaded? and it looks like 
there will be some nice exclusives on there including that Omarion and Lil Wayne
single... Unfortunately there is a lot of old tracks on this mixtape, but I know a
lot of people who always like these ?Leak? tapes, Also i have added some trackz to
Make it a full tape... 


1. Soo-Woop
2. I Get It In featuring Omarion
3. We Like Cars
4. Salute featuring Fabolous
5. Play In My Band
6. Invasion
7. Million Dollar Baby featuring DJ Drama
8. I?m Feeling Myself
9. Sharp featuring Rick Ross
10. I?m Gone Get It
11. I Told Y?all
12. It?s Not Love
13. Southside featuring Birdman
14. Two Four
15. Let?s Chill featuring Young Money
16. A Week Long
17. From The Side
18. Feels So Right
19. Let Me Hit That
20. She Know What She Wants

Some songz could have also been renamed for example ?Let Me Hit That? could be ?Every
Girl?, ?Two Four? could be ?Kobe Bryant?, ?Soo-Woop? could be ?Major? and ?I?m Gone 
Get It? could be ?No Quitter, Go Getter?. Also, songs on the tape such as ?Soo-Woop?,
?I?m Feeling Myself?, ?It?s Not Love? and ?She Know What She Wants? might be the ful versions, as we only have snippets to them tracks currently."
