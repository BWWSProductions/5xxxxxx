New Age International | 2007 | ISBN: 9788122420289, 9788122428728 | 604 pages | PDF

The book is meant for students of engineering degree colleges all over India. The syllabi covers various topics on physical chemistry, organic chemistry, industrial chemistry, and inorganic chemistry. To cover a variety of topics in a single book, that too for beginners, is a very difficult task. We have tried to present the subject matter very lucidly so that the students can grasp it easily. Some portions of the subject matter have been highlighted so that the students can understand the important and salient features of the topics. The book covers the latest syllabi of West Bengal State Council of Technical Education. Short questions and answers are given in the book for the benefit of the students for semester exams.
