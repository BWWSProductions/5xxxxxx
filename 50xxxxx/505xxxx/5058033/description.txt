Description: MySecretFolder is a software utility that you can use
to hide your private folder from other users, hide it so that no one 
will even suspect that your secret folder exists! Yet the folder 
would be easily accessible to you, when you need it: just press the 
hot key,enter your password, and it will open in a window, just like 
a regular Windows folder. While the folder is unprotected, you can 
work with the files and documents it contains, just like with any 
other folder you have. When you are done, enter your password, and 
the folder will disappear again, until you need it next time.

MySecretFolder offers many ways of customizing its operation to suit your preferences:

* You can enable the stealth mode of operation to prevent other users from detecting the presence of MySecretFolder on your computer;

* You can set up a hot key to run the commands of MySecretFolder and quickly protect or unprotect your secret folder.

* You can configure MySecretFolder to display a taskbar icon for quick access to your secret folder, as well as as to serve as an indicator of the status of its protection.
