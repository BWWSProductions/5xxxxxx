,Crynsos,2009-08-19T01:57Z,"*Sigh*

I already dual-seed this from my two torrent clients to reach as many peers as possible, but I can't be online all day to seed either...

I'm doing my best, but my upload limit seems to be ~ 50kb/s at each of my clients, be patient, the first other seeds should be done soon..."
,zero721ms,2009-08-19T04:20Z,"Yeah, I guess we can give you a break there... I started 20 minutes after you posted this, and just hit 81%.  Hopefully, I'll be done by tomorrow."
,MrSumOne,2009-08-19T15:46Z,"Great collection. I'm on vacation in Japan and the speeds went at 7mb a second!!!! Until about the 97.3% mark, where only one seeder sits, then it slowed to a crawl. Gotta love that Japanese internet though! Thanks for the great collection."
,Crynsos,2009-08-19T23:38Z,"Nice to see that it finished overnight, hope you guys have fun... (I wonder why the majority of downloaders are always japanese though...)


Some info I got recently which might interest some of you. Since ""Unthinkable Natural Law"" is basically just an Add-On to ""Scarlet Weather Rhapsody"" with new characters (Meiling, Cirno, Sanae) and a wonderful new interface, here is a short guide on how to merge those two games:



First of all open configex123.ini in your 12.3 folder.
Once it is open you should see a line saying ""path=C:\Program Files\tasofro\th05""
Change that line to where your copy of SWR is, that will make you have all the characters from SWR.
BUT! Remember to keep the path= there, or it will not work.
Also, make a copy of yor score.dat from SWR and rename it score123.dat and copy it into your UNL folder to carry spellcards over. If you already have a score.dat for UNL, you're going to have to go over it, sorry!



I'll continue to seed my Touhou uploads for a good long time, hope you guys will too!"

,qwopgirp,2012-07-17T23:32Z,"Seemed fine, but was a little sketch. I dunno.
IaMP was deleted by AVG for identity security.
Perfect Cherry Blossom somehow accessed AVG.
Shoot the Bullet crashes sometimes when at full screen, and attempts to access Google Update."
