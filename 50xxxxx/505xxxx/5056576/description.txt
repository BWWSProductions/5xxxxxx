The Story Goes... - Craig David [2005]
	



The Story Goes... is the third album by British singer Craig David, released in 2005 via Warner Music in the UK. The album entered (and peaked) in the UK Albums Chart at #5 in late 2005. The album peaked at #9 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart in mid-2005. It was not released in USA. The reason being was because executives at Atlantic Records were not sure if the album was right material for America [1]. Ultimately, in 2007, the album was released digitally and as an import in American record stores.

Worldwide, the album has sold around 2,000,000 copies.
