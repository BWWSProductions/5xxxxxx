,airhugs,2009-09-23T15:33Z," Firstly, thanks for putting in the effort to get this up here. Unfortunately it seems every file terminates prematurely. Only by a couple seconds I think but enough to be flippin annoying. It just cuts out mid-sentence. Pity. Great book. Was looking forward to this."
,toruwatanabe1234,2011-01-22T23:46Z,"I've been scouring the net for a release of the film adaptation of this book.  If anyone has Norwegian Wood (2010) by director Tran Anh Hung, please please share it!"
,ticker,2011-02-19T07:59Z,"I have been looking for the movie version too, hopefully it will come out as a rental soon enough."
,f0xer,2012-03-13T03:58Z,"Every file does end prematurely, which does get quite annoying. There is another audiobook on this book (although it is for a different translation of this book) available on TPB here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6455431/Haruki_Murakami_-_Norwegian_wood"
