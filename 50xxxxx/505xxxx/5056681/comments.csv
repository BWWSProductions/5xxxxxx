The complexity of life, the fact that if the gravitational constant were off or if we were any closer or farther away from the sun there would be no life on Earth, the fact that 250 different proteins had to be present in a body in the right amount for life to survive is impossible, the fact that no human to date has offered a good idea of how life started... I don't see how God could not be real.

That, and I saw Christ when I was in a car accident at the age of 3 and my family didn't attend church that often, so I had no way of knowing what Christ looked like, no way of knowing about the crucifixion (most Protestant churches don't show pictures of His grisly death), and I had no way of knowing about his message. Thankfully He showed me all of that!"
