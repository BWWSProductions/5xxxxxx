This may be the best collection of The Beatles' Esher/Kinfauns demos out there. It certainly beats From Kinfauns to Chaos and the Acoustic Masterpieces. But is it better than the Purple Chick release? I think so. It's a little bit up to taste. Little more transparency on Purple Chick, less hiss on this one. They seem to come from the same analog source, but no, they don't cancel each other out. And the volume drop at the beginning of "Sour Milk Sea" is not present here (possibly fixed by the bootlegger.)

Note: Only the last four tracks are Anthology mixes. If you like the Anthology mixes of "Piggies," "Junk," and "Honey Pie," consider the Purple Chick or the Anthology your supplement. Because really, you should have the Purple Chick releases anyway; they're a blast!
