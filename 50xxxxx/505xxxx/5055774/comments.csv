,kehaak,2009-10-11T14:40Z,You're the best :)
,Sumsonfire,2009-10-24T08:11Z,"hi Mctav i greatly appreciate the work u do but i was wondering if it is possible for you to create torrents of all south parks in compressed rar format because they are alot easier to download and they are quicker and for someone like me whos internet isnt very fast it would make a real difference as it took me 5 or six days to download a single season 
thank you for all your work"
,nty1907fb,2009-11-24T00:21Z,yeahhh!! you r so good mctav.. god bless you!! :D:D
,BigDownUnder,2009-12-23T08:26Z,"sumsonfire* please leave, if you cant download fast piss off. You slow the rest of us down, you can ask and ask and ask but no one in their right mind uploads .rar files. Unless it is software or games, but most likely if you do download a .zip or .rar file your getting viruses and spyware. "

TV episodes uploaded in RAR format are typically fakes. There is no point to it, since AVI files are already fully compressed."

,ilovemycomputer,2010-10-13T22:28Z,"BEWARE: This may or may not be mctav's fault, but warning everybody for future references!!! 
THE TRACKER ""http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce"" has been found in multiple southpark seasons from MCTav and upon research on google, the second result I found from this was
""denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969 is operated by MediaDefender and this blog is a ploy to trick people into using the tracker"". That said, that mediadefender is the one running this tracker, make sure you delete it before you do ANY sharing. Praise mctav for hosting these, but warning your fans!"
,ilovemycomputer,2010-10-14T00:19Z,"By the way the blog I was talking about in my previous comments on mctav's other torrents was: 
http://opentracker.blog.h3q.com/
This is a fake site, and even advises to using the tracker, which is operated by MediaDefender to track if you upload any of the torrents it's in, so they can nail you for it. Thats why you've gotten that stupid notice to cease and desist asap."

@Sumsonfire:

.rar files arent all fakes only a small percentage and .avi can still be compressed in a .rar file especially when compressing a whole 14 .avi would speed up the download process slightly also seeing as torrents were originaly almost all .rar or .zip files to make lots of small parts instead of one big one ever wondered why some torrents with 2000 seeders dl slower than others with same number of seeders its becase the person that made the torrent used small pieces and multiple files instead of big ones
-----ive downloaded plenty of legit virus free .rar torrents sick of ppl marking good torrents fake just coz they are compressed "
,Dannoth,2011-03-13T17:47Z,Thanks man. Awesome torrent :D
