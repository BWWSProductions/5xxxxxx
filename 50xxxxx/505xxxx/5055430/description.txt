The Private Life of Plants is a BBC nature documentary series written and presented by David Attenborough, first transmitted in the UK from 5 January 1995.

A study of the growth, movement, reproduction and survival of plants, it was the second of Attenborough's specialised surveys following his major trilogy that began with Life on Earth. Each of the six 50-minute episodes discusses the aspects of a plant's life-cycle, using examples from around the world.
