Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. Please do your part.

Creating a torrent takes seconds, uploading them takes ages. I'm going to create all episodes of season 4 & seed 1 by 1, stopping at about 98% until a whole heap of you are ready to finish, saving me the hassle of constantly seeding.
