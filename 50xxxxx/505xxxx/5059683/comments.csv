,AlexHSH,2009-08-18T15:53Z,With crack? 
,the Dutchman,2009-08-18T16:14Z,Another useless upload......
,the Dutchman,2009-08-18T16:16Z,Do you even bother checking before you upload?
,bigturd,2009-08-18T16:45Z,"Worthless without a crack. The game requires you to register online, and be online at all times. Don't waste your time or bandwidth downloading this."
,AlexHSH,2009-08-18T16:52Z,"bigturd? Yes, this is true, if you dont have cdkey, game not activated, becouse need to regiter user on http://riseofflight.com/, and enter your key for activation your profile. I have key, i buy the game after release. 
sorry for my bad english :)"
,shark_808,2009-08-18T17:10Z,@ Dutchman.... I dunno exactly but the boxed version is to be out soon so a cracked version should be available pretty soon... probably this is one? and it should not be impossible to crack that f***in online check
,Marklar666,2009-08-18T20:11Z,"you have to activate box version in the same way as download one. sorry guys, you won't play this game for free"
,D0gmeat,2009-08-18T21:28Z,"All this bitchin'...

Dude, thanks for taking the time to share this. 

Peepz, treat this like a Cloned image. Download and wait for the crack. Or buy yourself an effin' account on-line and thank the man you didn't have to get the release from your gamestore. This ain't no freakin' Mickey D or Burger King."
,redhammer,2009-08-19T01:29Z,boxed version has been out for quite some time fyi...
,Abdallah9,2009-08-19T04:45Z,"Need crack to play without conection or register

,the Dutchman,2009-10-30T21:46Z,"dangerzone.il your remark is as useless as this torrent,you Fag!"
,soundmaster inc,2009-11-01T18:44Z,"huh,,this is not a good graphics game,pluss...cpu usage goes to 100%(amdx26400 3.2 ghz 4gb ram and geforce 9800gt 512 oc) windows 7.
this game reminds me microsoft flight simulator-crappy graphics and badly running game!!,
heroes over europe is pretty good sim in my opinion and of course masterpiece called h.a.w.x."
,Magerna,2009-11-06T19:49Z,"Uhm, you call HAWX and HoE ""simulations""??? That's so ridiculous it's funny again...these are very arcadish games...good air sims are IL2 Sturmovik, Falcon 4.0 and Locked On."
,saxon_x,2009-11-09T23:36Z,"useless upload, could at least have told us that theres no CRACK. Let us know if anyone has a sollution...."
,baab32,2009-12-01T07:13Z,heroes over europe good?....HAWX masterpeice.....holy crap some one is living in a box! GET A FUCKING CRACK FOR THIS FUCKER
,the Dutchman,2010-01-05T17:59Z,SILENCE............I KILL YOU!
,bajhoj,2010-04-27T00:22Z,"the game is worth the money. i bought it and i'm absolutely happy and satisfied with it. this can be downloaded off riseofflight.com, faster than off torrents. this is a demo. you need to buy the serial. the same demo is on the original dvd. but the serial is included in the box. buy it. regards."
,ZalHack,2010-11-27T00:04Z,"Yeah guys, same thing happened to me, I managed to run the game, but the fun ended fast after it said I need to play it as online at all times. Sucks, because its a good looking game.
Any cracks out yet?
Or kinda bypass it like with COH, that be awesome if it actually has offline mode, if not then this game would be worth shit."
,emash_ru,2011-02-23T19:54Z,please seed some more!
,emash_ru,2011-02-23T23:24Z,"shit! torrent is junk don't download, get distributive at official site"
,gnark1ll,2011-07-31T21:41Z,"If there are people out there looking to play Rise of Flight, like I was, its now free to play, with 2 planes included.

Looks like they have moved over to the micro payment model. Plenty of gameplay to be had in the 'unlimited demo' version"
,atorque79,2012-01-27T02:41Z,Has anyone tried this key?  Unlimited ROF Demo Key-Code: 77777-77777-77777-77777-77771
,FrankieForearm1,2012-03-29T01:34Z,@atorque79 yes that key works thanks.
,0rochimaru,2012-04-05T08:24Z,"The 'unlimited play' demo u can be downloaded at the official site for free now.

Extra stuff has to be bought... at an EXORBITANT price (x1 plane = $8~$15)  lol!

No wonder we pirate...  -_-"
,0rochimaru,2012-04-10T06:02Z,"Also, you will need to update the game to be able to activate it.  The update is a bigger file than the game here!

Still a good flight sim though.  Best of it's kind."
,TeapotTempest,2012-05-06T19:59Z,It's a shame that there are no hackers out there with enough skill to crack this -- it looks like a great game.
,joeshmowyaknow,2012-06-05T09:00Z,Its free online with limited features... check it out  http://riseofflight.com/tryrof/en
,ZalHack,2012-06-12T11:58Z,"Come on people... We need a crack for this a full version... It's been years now, I been searching like a mad man, and found nothing!

The entire game with everything costs around 78 Euros, thats fucking crazy!

Is there a way to bypass, a way to crack anything? I would be also cool with a offline crack with all unlocks.

Come on PLEASE!"
