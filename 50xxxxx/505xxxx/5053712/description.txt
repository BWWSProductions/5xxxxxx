This disc is not in the freedb for some strange reason. The tracks are untitled to protect the

integrity of the cue sheet.

The is the 3nd disc of a 6 disc limited edition set. I have scanned the cover which is the same for

front and back of the box and this is contained in the first disc torrent. I have omitted the 80 page

book that is included with the set because it would take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad

enough then buy the box set. I will upload one disc a day. This set is a combination of the soundtrack

and follow up album with the exception Ten Years After and Rock and Soul Music by Country Joe and the

Fish.

Pease note that some of these tracks were unissued and some are complete versions that were unissued.

If you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.

Please help seed these torrents. Enjoy.



Don't forget to thank all of the uploaders on the site who are donating
their time and bandwidth to bring you the finest quality rips in flac
format.
