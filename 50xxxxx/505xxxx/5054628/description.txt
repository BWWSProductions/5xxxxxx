The story of Mel and Edna (Jack Lemmon and Anne Bancroft), a middle-class, middle-aged, middle-happy couple living in a Manhattan high rise apartment building. Mel loses his job, the apartment is robbed, Edna gets a job, Mel loses his mind, Edna loses her job . . . to say nothing of the more minor tribulations of nosy neighbors, helpful relatives and exact bus fares. The couple suffers indignity after indignity (some self-inflicted) and when they seem on the verge of surrender, they thumb their noses defiantly and dig the trenches for battle. (imdb.com)

By the way, watch out for cameos by pre-fame Sylvester Stallone and F. Murray Abraham. And enjoy a sort of sophisticated intelligent comedy America has once given the world, now replaced by shallow idiocy.
