The story will continue the saga of the already classic BaldurÂ´s Gate where you are the son of the God of murder and together with a party of 5 members (maximum) you have to protect your immortality from an evil mage. This history sounds simple at a first sight but it will lead you to a large number of sub-quests which help to improve the RPG experience. The main story takes you to a linear way but the side-quests can make you feel deeper involved with the environment of Dungeons and Dragons. As you keep playing you will realize the different personalities of the characters and you can even have romance through the game.
