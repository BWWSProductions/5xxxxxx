make sure you DO NOT have Dynamic Drive on your machine, or you'll be screwed (loop restart)."
,blackasian,2009-08-20T11:10Z,this works folks. on the offical build 7200 OEM it worked on mine. also make sure your OS's is fresh install you can instal on the 30day then patch its safe no viruses at all.
,Smorgan,2009-08-20T19:59Z,There are other ways to activate Windows 7 cause the bios hack is not working since duh Microsoft black listed the lenovo master key 
,tomkins0226,2009-08-21T11:46Z,"For those who have trouble activating DELL computer, use BIOS mod.

I had trouble activating my Dell XPS 410.

Used the Dimension 9200(=XPS 410) bios mod to successfully activate."

,Smorgan,2009-08-27T07:16Z,AS I stated earlier there are easier ways to activate Windows 7 and I will hint that they involve the System Security Platform and spp
,blackasian,2009-08-28T20:57Z,this didnt work on my 64bit version anyone know how i can get the 64bit working thanks in advance.
,Smorgan,2009-08-28T21:03Z,uggh why doesnt anyone listen to me lol.  Ok I will stte the facts first: One Bios hacks are not working because in order to crack it these hacks were created from the Lenovo master key which hs been black listed.  Two I really don't know what they are trying these days but do a variant of the OOBE timer crack of Windows 7 this should work.
,Smorgan,2009-08-29T05:14Z,"For those of you like me that are running some sort of 64 bit of Windows 7 the first thing u need to do is download and install Timer Nuke.  This will get ride of the Notification part of 7 next time for the messy part go into run and type Regedit. Now navigate through Hkey local machine, Software, Microsoft NT, Current Verison and delete the SPP folder then Delete Software Protection Platform (all one word) and bingo you copy is semi activated.

PS tell me if this works after 30 days with NO REARMS.

My thanks to the timer nuke team"
,Smorgan,2009-08-29T05:15Z,Correction to last post its Windows NT not Microsoft NT
,blackasian,2009-08-30T08:02Z,"thanks man i will try this and let u know if it works, i sure do wish it was a easy way make it all just work ligit lol thanks again."
,Smorgan,2009-08-31T21:49Z,This should work with all versions of Windows 7 including the enterprise edition
,Smorgan,2009-09-08T05:11Z,Excellent job
,varinder_vari,2009-09-09T21:04Z,Pls invite me if someone has DEMNOID account. vkkv1 at hotmail  !!
,Smorgan,2009-09-13T07:29Z,This is my last comment to this thread.  Timer Nuke does not work with deleting the activation software so the software services etc are still on there.  I might upload a torrent to fix this issue but not today.
,Smorgan,2009-09-17T06:39Z,"well I lied here is the torrent I promised comment if you need any help.
