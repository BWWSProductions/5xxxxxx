"Jump" is the third official single taken from Flo Rida's second album R.O.O.T.S. Nelly Furtado makes an appearance on the song with an upbeat hook. Flo-Rida said: "I used a whole different delivery on this one. We're talking about different situations to get people hype in the club. 'Jump!' Whether you're an athlete running in the stadium or you're in the club. Get hype!" 

The song is currently being used to promote the Disney film G-Force, and an edited version has been added to Radio Disney's playlist.

The music video was filmed in May by Chris Robinson. The video premiered worldwide on July 11, 2009, featuring clips from G-Force. Nelly Furtado does not appear in the video because she was busy the dates they were shooting so she was animated instead.

"Jump" made a brief visit to the Canadian Hot 100 Chart for 3 weeks and The Billboard Hot 100 chart for 1 week. Since the song has not been released as a single or for airplay, the chart performance relied on only digital sales. The single has re-entered at number 76 on Billboard Hot 100, due to G-Force taking the #1 spot its opening week. So far the single has peaked at #57.
