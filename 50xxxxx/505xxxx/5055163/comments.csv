[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2009-11-14T20:50Z,Would anyone be interested in all the extras from Oliver Stone's film starring Val Kilmer The Doors? If so just let me know and I'll upload it. It's about 60 minutes of extra documentary interviews with the actors and members of the band still living and many people who knew Jim. Post here if you want it!
