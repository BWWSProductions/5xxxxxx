If you like this torrent then feel to +1 it, but the best way to show your support is to seed - that way I kno that people are liking the torrent plus your helping other people at the same time."
,PMartinez,2009-08-21T04:01Z,"weird, because i've been stuck at 99.01% for 2 days."
,mu57i11,2009-08-21T18:41Z,sorry about that; I've always been seeding so eventually your client should find me and grab the last few k - I get so annoyed when that happens to me.

Only Exogenesis 1 wont finish.  I will seed what I have for a week or so."
,PMartinez,2009-08-23T03:43Z,exogenesis 1 is the only one i can't get as well.
,bebster,2009-09-09T14:27Z,I have the full album uploaded (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5083137) - but I need people to help me seed it.
