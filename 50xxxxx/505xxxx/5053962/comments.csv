,yabba333,2009-08-18T16:28Z,not bad tho for first upload :)
,dj8765,2009-09-06T16:39Z,"Why does EA have to write in crappy cd checks, it looks like the drive letter is hard written in somewhere.  I can't figure out how to get it to work with the check, searched through the reg, and the directory.  CD was on the same drive letter it was installed on.... DL'ed a no cd crack, and it crashes in the same place... really wish I hadn't have installed that f'in 1.02 patch"
,dj8765,2009-09-07T04:25Z,"I don't know why it crashes so much, nothing I do seems to affect it and once it crashes at a spot it keeps crashing at that spot on the save game until I give up on it.  Sometimes it will crash randomly when I click on something, but always in the campaign map, never in the battle map.... Tried hardware acel, video settings, compatibility setting, even reinstalled with no luck.  Only thing I didn't try was re-downloading.  This is the only program in about the last 5-6 years that I couldn't make work.  Good luck to everyone else, my prob seems to be an isolated incident. "
,dj8765,2009-09-07T11:34Z,"Definitely not the download, different version, different torrent, same fucking crashes.... BTW warlord edition is way better then the plain version."
,yabba333,2009-09-11T17:21Z,"have answered your comment earlier but was away... to stop the game from crashing go into options and select video then choose ""software"" this should solve any crashes :D"
,dj8765,2009-09-13T22:52Z,"Yeah I tried that, it was just really slow and still crashed.  The thing was it repeated at the same point, so if I loaded from the autosave it still crashed at the same point, and I think always at the campaign map between turns, like the game was asking for a file that just wasn't there.  Medieval 1 works great, but still would rather play Shogun.  "
,dj8765,2009-09-19T10:37Z,"Found the answer while looking up something unrelated, the problem lies between the games mp3's and windows codecs, eliminate the mp3's and the game works without the crash... 

Seems all my problems were located in \voices\Throne\  a name change to the Throne dir solved all the crashes so far, however there are more mp3's in various places.  The only side effect to the solution is it asking me to put the cd 2 in the tray every time it tries to open one of the renamed files, canceling aborts it.  Ohh and it looks like the adviser chewing gum :)

Alternatively you could probably uncompress / recompress the affected mp3's, but living without them isn't bad."
,italian3034,2009-09-21T23:20Z,every time i strat to start a new campain it tells me sh_ccp has stop working and needs to close can anyone help me i tryed burning a cd mounting the img useing deamon tools and nothing works any ideas would be great thanks!
,yabba333,2009-09-28T16:18Z,you need to go to video oiptions within the game and change it to 'softwar' this is written in the support guide
,manix34,2009-10-20T11:29Z,tnx 4 the upload man it works perfectly!!! ^_^
,robertisaar,2009-10-23T06:01Z,"i had this back in the day....

thanks for bringing back the memories, i'm sure i'll be wasting quite a few hours on it."
,yabba333,2009-11-05T10:58Z,"ok i have found the solution to many of the problems, 

what you need to the is NOT INSTALL THE PATCH......"
,SeekAndDestroy08,2009-11-27T01:31Z,"When I try to run the setup, nothing happens.

I can get the launcher to pop up but then I click install, and I'm just left with another setup.exe running in my processes and nothing happening."
,yabba333,2009-11-29T15:47Z,"seek and destroy i have not found a solution to your problem.

,FeanorNoldor,2009-12-14T16:28Z,I can't understand how to mount the .bin/.cue archives.I have done it before but now it doesn't work.Btw i am using PowerIso
,mrskyhigh,2009-12-27T04:23Z,"I Mounted the cd's correctly, and then it worked fine... until I installed the patch. Then it asks for the cd again... I believe I need to crack the game now that there version of the game is updated by the patch. Anyone else have this?"
,kirk3rs,2009-12-31T04:25Z,"i'm new to this and i don't know how to get the keygen to work. I mount the relevant files using magicISO virtual, but when i come to install the game it asks me for the key code... if anyone could help me. i loved this game when it first came out and would love to play it again. 
Thank you, and great job with the upload"
,eddboy876,2010-01-26T12:23Z,I've been looking for this game everywhere. I hope it works :)
,DouglasNN,2010-01-29T04:50Z,Grande upload! Obrigado pelo Up!
,wqutob,2010-02-06T20:53Z,"first of all thank you yabba333
been looking for this for ages.
i guess EA just made a lot of mistakes making this game, when i had it (before my dad lost it) the campaign never worked for some odd reason.

to the point. i didn't install the patch and i played around in the video setting and it still crashes!!
someone help please."
,heiseyeandeyeamhim,2010-02-22T04:32Z,Not sure why but when I play the game I get up to about 7 turns and than the game shuts down and goes directly to my desktop. Does anyone know why it does that?.
,heiseyeandeyeamhim,2010-02-22T04:35Z,"Oh yeah, my OS is windows XP with Service pack 3. Maybe this game is not compatible with my OS??. I had this game a long time ago when my OS was Win 98 and it worked fine. Anyway if you guys know a way around this glitch please let me know...THANKS!!"
,jezzbanger,2010-02-25T14:22Z,The file size of the bin file seems to be larger than the Blank CD I'm writing to.  Can anyone help a n00b out and let me know how to get loaded up.  (I've got Alcohol 120% to work with btw)
,Lokiloki1995,2010-03-18T22:45Z,"Ok man, so i have seen a lot of the comments saying not to d/l the patch, i need you to confirm wether i should or not. Also will i need to use a crack or not?

Answer asap thanks ^^"

,jc_azrael,2010-06-12T09:43Z,Thanks to uploader
,Dudewtfsgoingon,2010-07-04T03:22Z,"What do you mean by turning off the support to fix the flickering? I've screwed around with all the settings to stop it, looked everywhere online and can't find a solution. 

I also get a shogun_CPP Error when I try to start up sometimes."
,Vince21,2010-07-09T23:55Z,Thank you so very much. I too have been hunting for it for the past 3 years. And now you bring it here. Thank you.
,danilo86,2010-09-06T16:54Z,"Thanks man, awesome game."
,yabba333,2010-09-15T12:05Z,"dudewtfsgoinon you need to make sure the video settings is set to ""software"" if you have then if you have installed the patch then you should uninstall and install but DO NOT install the patch..."
,RTWknight,2010-11-27T17:19Z,OK so im definitly not new at this but i don't understand the directions given on how to change the settings and it shows up the cpp or whatever it says as soon as I try to start the program

,sheepstealer1,2011-01-21T22:59Z,"Having great difficulty with this torrent , First of all i installed without patch and my menu was flashing enough to give a blind man a sieziure so i installed the patch in hope of fixation and now its asking for a disk? Need help asap"
,ghostpilots,2011-02-07T04:59Z,"my problem is the same as SeekAndDestroy08's in that when i press install STW warlord edition, nothing happens and i am left with a setup.exe running in the processes. what am i doing wrong?"
,xiIix,2011-02-15T20:43Z,"Just get the new one, it's fuckin sick dude. The graphics are out of this world."
,SweatyGremlins,2011-03-15T12:49Z,"To get this to work on newer graphics cards you have to disable Hardware Acceleration.

On XP you can do this in your normal Display settings, on Vista and i guess Windows 7 (don't have W7) you need to download Direct X control panel and disable it from the Direct Draw tab.

This fix works for a lot of old games inculding Planescape: Torment and Omikron."

,davyjones111,2012-05-30T22:32Z,"a simple solution for the flashing thing worked for me :

1. Download and install Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=7352
(You need ApplicationCompatibilityToolkitSetup.exe)
2. Go to Toolkit installation folder (by default C:/Program Files/Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit), then to 'Compatibility Administrator (32 bit)' (no matter what system you have) and run Compatadmin.exe as Admin.
3. Press button 'New' (if 'New Database(1)' currently exists in 'Custom Databases', you can skip this and go to p.4)
4. Right click on New Database. Select 'Create new -> application fix...'
5. Name your fix if you wish. Choose a path to Medieval_TW.exe or ShogunW.exe. Proceed to next window.
6. You'll see a window with operating system selection and other minor options. Nothing to change there, go next.
7. At last, a window named 'compatibility fix' Find and select an option 'ForceDirectDrawEmulation'.
8. Choose 'next' and 'finish'.
9. Save your fix by pressing 'Save' button.
10. Now, the most important stage. Right click on your database, then 'Install'.

No more seizure for blind men.

And there is a working NoCD 1.02 on the net.(SHOGUN.TOTAL.WAR.WE.V1.02B.ENG.CAPTAIN.SPARKY.NOCD.ZIP)

Hope it helps.
