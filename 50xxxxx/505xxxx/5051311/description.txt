Ever wonder where those great games of Polar Bowler and Polar Golfer went to? Here they are, in the original Polar Games format. ISO file created using the original Polar Games retail disk. This one predates the new console from Wild Tangent and includes the web driver to play.

Spybot will detect the Wild Tangent web driver, can set to ignore so as not to delete, games will not run without the web drivers which are harmless.

32bit only, will not load on a 64bit system, to play/install on 64bit must use a type of Virtual PC app running a 32bit OS.

Enjoy!!!
