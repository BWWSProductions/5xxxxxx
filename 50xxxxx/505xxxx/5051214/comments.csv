,TauTau154,2009-08-18T06:49Z,"FREAKING AMAZING!  Rupert77, you made my night/day good sir.  I love Breaking Benjamin and have all their albums.  I thought Breaking Benjamin broke up for good, but this has instilled my faith in them and their music.  Here's to you *raises beer*."
,tannerman,2009-08-30T09:47Z,"You're a real douche bag, kingwaffle.
Sometimes I wonder why these trolls are even allowed to comment. Thanks Rupert. The quality is just amazing. Keep it going."
,MarcFirewing,2009-08-31T12:04Z,"I'm here for quality, not what the little words say. I don't know who made that cover art but that's what the cover SHOULD be! Either way. Thanks Rupert! Say, when the full album comes out, wanna do us all a favor and jump at the chance? :P

Anyways, thanks again man! You rock!"
,whiskz,2009-09-02T22:34Z,"wow, you idiots arguing about bitrate, go buy a good audio card and some headphones, then come bring your crap. if you think 128 sounds the same as 320 your retarded. and as for something being ripped from myspace, i highly doubt it would be 320, maybe 128 tops. and up converting, ya it can be done so to speek, by just re-encoding at a higher bit rate will make the file bigger but will have the same original quality."
,whiskz,2009-09-05T03:35Z,"first off i misread your comment as 128 instead of 192 and secondly most people would just rip music as with a download helper, which suck extremely bad and i have come across a few albums like that. and dont such a dick man i was just commenting audio, i didnt know there was a high bitrate available, most of the time shit that isnt out yet gets labled as hq, but is just re-encoded or shit like that"
,whiskz,2009-09-07T19:22Z,"alright, i hope this ends your bitching, i got this and i got the demonoid one and here is what i see and hear. im no audiophile or audio eng. but im not an idoit either. i dont give a shit if its free because i dont even listen to them.

tpb- bass heavy and peaks resulting in clipping, cutoff point is around 16k, look at it in a spectrograph. now this could just be itunes as a pos encoder.

demonoid- sounds fine, peaks around 19k, not near as bass heavy.

this is what i can hear and see so feel free to piss and moan all you want, but those are the facts."
,Darth_Kalel,2009-09-12T08:15Z,"wow sorry rupert what a bunch of bitching ungrateful assholes, what the fuck are you downloading for if you don't listen to them, a proper ripper, distributor at least spend the little money on the song or disc you cheap fucking excuse for a pirate, get a life get laid and fucking stop bitching, i didn't even upload this and I want to kick your ass just for being a little bitch, I don't see you uploading anything quality is good not great but it's free and all i had to do was hit a button, stupid fucking faggots."
,whiskz,2009-09-12T22:39Z,"lol told you someone would get their panties in a wad XD get over yourself. all i wanted to do was set the record straight for what it was so go crawl off in a hole and die if you dont mind, ok. i have nothing against rupert. at first i didnt even dl this, only after getting bitched at did i to listen and provide facts if others wanted them, and what do i get? whined at by a little shit for trying to set people straight. so im the evil fucking stupid pirate? well this is tpb i guess so i shouldn't expect anything better."
,MarcFirewing,2009-09-13T11:30Z,"I fail to see kingwaffle and whiskz IQ in this situation... I came back to see if they were still bitching and moaning about the bitrate...It sounds perfectly fine to me. Sure the spectrum reads some weird crap but if it's music it's music ain't it? And so what if you think the quality isn't 320? It's not like pointing it out is going to change anything.

Really all you're doing is just trying to shout to the world ""HEY I'M SMART AND I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 128, 192, AND 320 KBPS BITRATE! SO I'LL GO PICK OUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT LABELED WRONG AND WASTE MY OWN TIME TO PROVE IT!' ...So what? Keep wasting time. Why didn't you guys just shut up and let him spread this torrent around? Sure it may not be what you guys are used to, but whatever.

You're going to get a lot of backlash from this so just leave it alone...If it sounds good, the people will love it. If it doesn't, we'll make that call.

I will laugh if you come back with saying something about this argument. Just stand down, this is a never-ending war."
,Daniyal,2009-09-17T17:50Z,"i heard the song and i completely agree with kingwaffle. its obvious that this was originally 128 kbps. but i do think that you're being extremely childish coming back here to keep arguing. you said what you wanted to and you even explained it to the douchebags (god knows i wouldn't have). so just let it go and let the listeners decide for themselves. their loss.

@rupert77
no hard feelings but this IS 128 kbps. try listening to kingwaffle's rips.

just to let you all know, i won't be returning here to check on what you deaf bastards say about me - so don't bother. just try listening to kingwaffle's rips."
,screamofan101,2009-09-23T23:11Z,"is there any of the new songs from dear agony have a torrent. I know you can listen to some of the new songs on here
