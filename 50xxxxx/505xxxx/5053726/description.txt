  From Recorded Books:

  Some of the most amazing teenage athletes youâ€™ll ever meet are waiting to talk to you. In six unforgettable stories, Chris Crutcher captures the real world of teenagers facing tough situations and doing their bestâ€”no matter what. Meet Lionel, a great swimmer who lost his parents in a boating accident; Angus Bethune, the fat kid who can dance the pants off anyone; Johnny, whose abusive father makes him do ten push-ups every time he hears a word he doesnâ€™t like; and Petey, who â€œvolunteersâ€ to wrestle the toughest girl around. Their stories are sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, and always entertaining. An ALA Best Book for Young Adults and a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, Athletic Shorts is rooted solidly in Chris Crutcherâ€™s experience as a child and family therapist. It tackles some of the grittiest issues facing teenagers todayâ€”racism, underage drinking, AIDSâ€”with superb sensitivity and humor.
