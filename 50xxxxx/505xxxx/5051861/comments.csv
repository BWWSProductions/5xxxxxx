I see that people are downloading it, so it's either something that has just happened, or something's wrong on my end (though I wouldn't know what, I've downloaded many things from Neo before with never a problem)."

,negative_ions,2011-03-30T18:42Z,"@Auslegung

Probably because Deluge sucks."
,Derfus,2011-05-25T01:51Z,"The only problem here is the Frances the Mute album. It's completely butchered! The song names are all wrong and in the wrong order, and a couple are nowhere to be found.
Other than that, couldn't be better!"
