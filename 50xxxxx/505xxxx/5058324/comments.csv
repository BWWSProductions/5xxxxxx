,patrioticparadox,2010-12-06T08:24Z,"I disagree. I heard no static and heard only crisp, clean music. Sounds great on my surround system."
,PrinceOfFools,2012-04-20T23:08Z,"I have heard some song from Sabaton now and then but this song called ""Carolus Rex"" realy got me. So Im downloading this torrent to see if the rest of the song are as great as that one.
If they are I will buy the albums."

,Necrokvnt,2012-04-30T20:00Z,Really need to get into this band. Heard a lot of praise for them so may aswell actually listen despite being mainly into Black Metal and Death Metal. Cheers for giving me this oppurtunity bro!
