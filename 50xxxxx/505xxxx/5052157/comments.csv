,fireblade80,2009-10-09T14:46Z,"hardi444, load the second image ""Gothic CD2.iso"" using Daemon Tools or put in the second CD, if you have burned the images to CDs."
,Vampirelle,2009-10-17T02:42Z,"Do you even know how great you are for sharing a save game like this one? I mean I've played this game a million times but that first chapter is always killing me. Now you've made everything so easy, I can just pick up the game from the point I really want to. Thanks a lot for this! Take care."
,hardi444,2009-10-24T17:20Z,but look irt doesnt stand anything about dameon tools i have damen tools and winrar should i delete winrar because it doesent stand anything about loading it whith another program.Should i uninstall winrar
,fireblade80,2009-10-25T00:57Z,"hardi444, WinRAR ""sees"" an ISO file as an archive, rather than as a disc image. You may keep WinRAR for managing ZIP and RAR archives, but use Daemon Tools to load ISO images.

Start Daemon Tools, right click on its tray icon, select Virtual CD/DVD-ROM -> Mount image and then choose the desired ISO file, in this case ""Gothic CD2.iso""."
,hardi444,2009-10-26T12:15Z,isnt there another way to download this maybe from a other site
,AlucFahhT,2009-12-20T13:46Z,"hardi its not hard,use demon tools, mount cd1.iso, install. when it asks for cd2, do exactly what u did with cd1 and then u can continue the installation.
