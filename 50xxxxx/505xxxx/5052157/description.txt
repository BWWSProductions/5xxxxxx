Hello!

This package contains the game Gothic. Installation instructions are provided below. Happy gaming!


Instructions:

Step 0: Burn the ISO images to CD's, using a CD writing program such as Nero or ImgBurn (supplied here as "Apps\ImgBurn\SetupImgBurn_2.4.4.0.exe"), burning them as images, NOT as files added to a compilation - requires 2 CD's
				OR 
Mount the images one at a time, as requested by the installation program, using an ISO mounting application, such as DAEMON Tools (which is provided here as "Apps\DAEMON Tools\daemon4304-lite.exe")

Step 1: Install Gothic - files "Gothic CD1.iso" and "Gothic CD2.iso" (2 ISO images / CD's)

Step 2: Play the game!

Thank you for paying attention reading these hints!


Yours sincerely,
