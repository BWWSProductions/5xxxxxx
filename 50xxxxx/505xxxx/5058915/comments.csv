,boredofbaloney,2009-08-19T09:31Z,"very nice, thanks.....

but any chance of the earlier collections at 320kbps?

you could do a kind of re-release thing with a huge ad campaign...

anyway thanks"

It would be awesome if the earlier versions came out on 320kpbs. Btw, are you from a town called Zuidlaren?"
