A hot, young and charming man with ulterior motives enters the lives of a tight-knit group of gay men in New York City and at first adds excitement and intrigue to their group, but events soon spiral out of control as he deliberately attempts to destroy their relationships. Both touching and funny, WHIRLWIND is a subtle and honest depiction of thirty-something gay men and the crossroads they must face.
