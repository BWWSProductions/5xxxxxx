   PLOT (Fin):
   Dokumentin nimi: Josef Fritzl - Kellaripeto

   Huhtikuussa 2008 itÃ¤valtalaisessa Amstettenin pikkukaupungissa paljastui
   poikkeuksellisen jÃ¤rkyttÃ¤vÃ¤ rikos. Suurperheen isÃ¤ Josef Fritzl oli vanginnut
   tyttÃ¤rensÃ¤ vuosikausiksi kellariin ja siittÃ¤nyt tÃ¤lle useita lapsia.
   ItÃ¤valtalaisessa dokumentissa kÃ¤ydÃ¤Ã¤n karmea tarina lÃ¤pi vaihe vaiheelta
   Fritzlin oikeudenkÃ¤yntiin saakka. Asiaa puivat muun muassa oikeuslaitoksen
   asiantuntijat ja psykologit. Ohjelmassa kerrotaan myÃ¶s, kuinka Fritzlin perhe
   on joutunut ennennÃ¤kemÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤n mediamyllytyksen kohteeksi. Fritzlin tapauksen
   ohella dokumentissa otetaan esille kaksi muuta vastaavanlaista tapausta.

   Kun lataatte nÃ¤itÃ¤ FTVDTn dokumentteja niin muistakaa myÃ¶s jakaa. Ratio olisi
   hyvÃ¤ olla suurempi kuin 1.5. Ei saa olla liian itsekÃ¤s, muuten tÃ¤mÃ¤ homma ei
   toimi.


   PLOT (Eng):
   Document name: Josef Fritzl - The Beast of Basement

   The Fritzl case emerged in April 2008 when a 42-year-old woman, Elisabeth
   Fritzl, (born 6 April 1966), stated to police in the town of Amstetten in
   Austria that she had been held captive for 24 years in a concealed part of
   the basement of the family home by her father, Josef Fritzl (born 9 April
   1935), and that he had physically assaulted, sexually abused, and raped her
   numerous times during her imprisonment. The incestuous relationship forced
   upon her by her father had resulted in the birth of seven children and one
   miscarriage. Three of the children had been imprisoned along with their
   mother for the whole of their lives: daughter Kerstin, aged 19, and sons
   Stefan, 18, and Felix, 5.
   One child, named Michael, had died of respiratory problems three days after
   birth, having been deprived of all medical help; his body was incinerated by
   Josef Fritzl on his property. The three other children were raised by Fritzl
   and his wife Rosemarie in the upstairs home. Fritzl had engineered the
   appearance of these children as foundlings discovered outside his house: Lisa
   at nine months in 1993, Monika at ten months in 1994, and Alexander at 15
   months in 1997. When the eldest daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill, Josef
   acceded to Elisabeth's pleas to take her to a hospital, triggering a series of
   events that eventually led to discovery. Josef Fritzl was arrested on 26 April
   2008, aged 73, on suspicion of serious crimes against family members and went
   on trial in Sankt PÃ¶lten, Austria on 16 March 2009.He was charged with incest,
   rape, coercion, false imprisonment, enslavement and the murder of the infant
   Michael.After a four day trial from which the public and the media were
   largely excluded, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

   NOTE: Audio is mainly Finnish and partially German.
         Only Finnish subtitles are included.

   When you downloading these FTVDTs documents, remember seed also. Ratio should
   be bigger than 1.5. Don't be selfish, else this torrent system won't work.
