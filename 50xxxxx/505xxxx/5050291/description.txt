WINDOWS user see 
http://www.itravel-tech.com/forum_SJ/ -but there are crazy much spammers!!!

-so a better forum anyone??

the producers(???-really???) site is here: 
http://www.sja.com.tw/prog/SJ-5286%28TH%29.htm (withit came v1.2.2)

(the last tagger i bought is this: 
http://polaris-gps.com/5.html (and withit came the hereby presented v1.2.3) 


some weeks ago there still WAS a direct access to 
http://59.124.170.198/download/

there was access to different releases of software of these brands, too: Blumax , Canmore , Directrac , Echowell , Haicom , HandH , Holux , Locosys , Mavin , NCSNavi , Nolan , Pentagram , Qstarz , SBS , SJA , SM , TSI , XRoad , iTravel ... -all as sub-directories ...
-here a site with links to these brands: 
http://bt747.free.fr/content/?q=compatible_gps
-though refering to another chip MTK/MTK II
-suppose its NOT compatible to skytraq Venus 5 or Skytraq Venus 6 low Power GPS Chipset ???

the small program GPS Viewer SkyTraq 0.4.453.exe ( from 2007/04/19 ) (-is there a younger one available??? -please give us its url / adress in the comments ...) allows direct access to the tagger:
some keywords (if all works i cant yet well write):
show the different satellites, their signal-strength : SNR , watch the dataflow NMEA 0183 v. 3.1, GGA , GSA , from receiver ..., update firmware (really? and: is there any? please post...)..., change baudrate (works!), com-port (works!), get and set ephemeris , get almanac , AGPS , (:= A-GPS ) , 1PPS, GPS protocols - default: NMEA-0183 V3.01 - GGA, GSA, GSV, RMC, VTG ) , WSG-84 , SBAS : WAAS / EGNOS , ...., ) : --well i read somewhere the data about the actual height were incorrect: just ellipsoid earth modell and thus with a bias ?! (-can be corrected by software?? -have no idea yet... plz comment!!)

ok folks, the delivered software GPS Photo Tagger v1.2.3 works well and allows export of logged data LATER at different extensions

(but MY problem, presently: i did NOT YET succeed to get it working LIVE with navigation-software: ok, i have tried seaclear only..., how about garmin...???)
 




try this key for GPS Photo Tagger v1.2.3 :
