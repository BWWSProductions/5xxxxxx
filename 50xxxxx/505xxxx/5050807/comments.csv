,x0myheart0x,2011-09-26T12:32Z,"The only thing is each video will play for about 30seconds to a minute, and it will either have no sound, and the picture freezes with parts here and there that play, or it will play, and then skip to the end.
It looks good, but I'm having problems with it playing.  As stated above, I see that you said to download a player for it.  Do you know if it will fix these problems?"
,x0myheart0x,2011-09-26T15:13Z,"Ok, well I downloaded what you said to, and it's still not working at 100%.  Still skipping, and having no sound )):"
