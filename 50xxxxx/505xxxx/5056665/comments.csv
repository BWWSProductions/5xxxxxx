,carnnage14,2009-08-18T22:33Z,"if you guys want to burn this movie, look up ""how to burn movies"" on demonoid"
,Timyoni,2009-08-21T04:27Z,"The one and only thing I don't like about secretmyth is that he never tells anyone what he uses to encode his movies. I have been able to get extremely good rips with Handbrake but it is a shame he don't share this info (and also stupid)

Thanks for all your cool uploads and I wait you tell others how to do it. It benefits all of us"

,batsof0,2009-09-05T15:29Z,"for who cant see the screenshots : click on one of the link and when it says its blocked, you mark the link and click enter and then click on refresh button, on ie its on the right side ;) glad to help..xD"
,black186,2009-09-17T18:04Z,"regarding the quality:

good as usual EXCEPT - bottom 20% of the screen is blurred in order to blur out the subs...

this can be seen in the screencaps...

to open the screencaps links posted by uploader, copy them to microsoft word (or other word processor) and click on them from there... (I have absolutely no idea what batsof0 above me is trying to say)...

I recommend to check the sample included first..."
