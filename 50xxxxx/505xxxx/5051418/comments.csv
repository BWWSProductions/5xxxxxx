Sorry guys!"
[T],justliketwobalOOns,2009-08-15T20:46Z,"Oh no!! 

Ok guys, get busy downloading the torrents! Yeah you!!

Site might shut down in a week from now! We should learn from IndectedPirates mistake that we need different people downloading all torrents to different places, so if one guy messes them up for whatever reason, we still got backup. Not many people has experience in handling this many files and this large databases, it's easy to fuck it all upp. Anyone can do that mistake!

Thanks InfectedPirate for your work, too bad you're going on vacation!"
,daftpunk,2009-08-16T20:18Z,"Shame you can no longer seed this :(

Any chance of a re-upload MINUS the torrent files? Surely that will not effect your bandwidth limit?"
,WednesdayAddams,2009-08-17T00:27Z,You can always download all the files minus torrents even when there are no seeders. Most leachers have them.

sure!

> ... we still got backup...

but:

as i understand the facts by now:

to have backup is just a pre-requisite...

what i ask me is:

does that implicate we can get these torrents WORKING (instantly!) elsewhere??

-arent they fixed to a certain ip at the time of building up??

thats the reason for putting down the dutch servers is so detriemendal for tpb

-and thats how i understand the idea of using eg TOR-server(s) and putting the REAL ip behind to avoid such incidents in future..."
,hbmaennchen,2009-08-17T12:13Z,"am giving me the answer (partly)
