Generation Islam
Aired: Aug 13, 2009

CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour gives viewers a look inside the battle for the hearts and minds of youth in the Muslim world in â€œAmanpour Reports: Generation Islamâ€™, a new documentary that premieres on CNN International on Friday, August 14 at 1930hrs and replays on Saturday, August 15 at 0030hrs IST. This special report airs just a month before Amanpour launches her highly-anticipated weekday program, â€œAmanpour.â€™


Fresh from her extraordinary reporting from inside Iran during the Iranian elections, Amanpour takes viewers across Afghanistan, Pakistan and Gaza for â€œGeneration Islamâ€™. The documentary, which premieres just one week before Afghanistanâ€™s national elections on August 20, comes as U.S. President Barack Obama seeks to forge new relationships with Muslim nations and intensify the U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan.
