Kampf um Norwegen - Feldzug 1940 (English: Battle for Norway - 1940 campaign) is a 80 minute-long Nazi propaganda film directed by Martin Rikli and Dr. Werner Buhre by orders from the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. Released in 1940, the movie follows the Invasion of Denmark and Norway in the spring 1940.
The film was never even shown in Germany, and nobody knows the reason why. The movie was for a long time considered lost in its entirety. The Bundesarchiv in Berlin held only a few clips from the film. But then a complete nitrate copy of the film surfaced on an Internet auction in 2005. The Norwegian college professor and media expert Jostein Saakvitne discovered this, and purchased the copy.
