Description:

The Ultimate Fighting ChampionshipÂ® makes its Philadelphia debut on Saturday, August 8th for UFCÂ® 101: Declaration. In the main event, the two best 155-pound fighters in the world finally meet when UFCÂ® lightweight champion BJ Penn looks to defend his crown against number one contender Kenny Florian. Penn has never lost at 155-pounds, and Florian is looking to change that stat this summer.

In the co-feature, the pound-for-pound king of mixed martial arts, middleweight champion Anderson "The Spider" Silva, tests the waters at 205 pounds once again when he battles former light heavyweight champ and Ultimate Fighter season one winner Forrest Griffin.
