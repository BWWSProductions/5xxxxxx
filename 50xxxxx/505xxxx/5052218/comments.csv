,Flying_Thor_II,2009-08-15T03:32Z,"kash you muppet, you shouldn't be commenting about things you've no clue about, piss off back to axxo's haunt.....and we all know it was you that gave the minus one, you small dick motherfucker...

,Flashcab,2009-08-15T04:49Z,"This is a Flashcab Comment !  In this comment list there are claims of Free Movie Downloads. ""TOTALLY FREE"" . ""BULLSHIT"". Anyone that thinks that, is stupid !! The both sites mentioned , both wants your email address , one wants a joining fee and the other wants you to sign up to receive promotional material and merchandise offers via your email. So if you do not buy anything they can sell off your email address to the highest bidding Spammer. Even the one that asks for a joining fee will do this to cover costs.  The only true free way to download your movies is P2P and yes if you are on a shaped ADSL plan , your cost is your bandwith when you exceed your allotted download threshold. There is a old saying , ""There is no free lunches in this world"" , but file sharing is the best way to go and costs the less. So wise up Brothers and Sisters beware of the too good to be true offers they are all too often a rip off ...... At your expense........."
,Flashcab,2009-08-15T04:58Z,"This is a Flashcab Comment! Good job BONE.  You have based your upload along the lines that AxxO has presented and this is all good. Why other up loaders cannot compress the files to 700 to 800 Mb instead of 1.3 Gb + I will never know, its not that hard to do.  Thanks a lot BONE......"
[V],.BONE.,2009-08-15T06:31Z,aXXo release great quality!!!!
[V],.BONE.,2009-08-15T06:32Z,he ment it is like an axxo rip
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2009-08-15T11:09Z,Thank you !!
,MerlinBiggs,2009-08-15T14:26Z,Bad rip. Aspect ration is fucked.
,parasites,2009-08-15T14:43Z,"Unfortunately the film is stretched, it makes there faces look long. Maybe there might be a way to fix it. any one know. Thanks BONE."
,djs187,2009-08-15T16:53Z,thanks bone
,jjdoctor,2009-08-15T19:29Z,"yeah there is a way to fix it, use km player, u can adjust width height of the movie as u like"
,andrew87,2009-08-16T02:18Z,Are you guys all kidding? The film is out of it's original aspect ratio? Its HORRIBLE! Heads and bodies are long and skinny. Check the Universal and Revolution Studios logos at the start. DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you appreciate quality films.
,sirac1925,2009-08-16T05:20Z,"yeah, all those movie sites stop after an hour & then u gotta register with your credit card....

no thank-u
rather spend an hour download and watch without interuptions"
,zurichch,2009-08-16T12:55Z,"The video and audio are clean, but unfortunately the video ratio is not right and the screen is shaved somehow. The film is watchable, and there are less fat people in this version. But there probably is a better torrent out there. Thanks anyway, better luck next time."
,markisthejob,2009-08-16T13:04Z,Ya good quality but the aspect ratio is a bit messed up.
,funkyDL,2009-08-16T21:19Z,"thanks alot, been waiting since Mai :)

,ShOrTy09,2009-08-17T00:11Z,this film is a mint 10/a 10/v aspect ratio nout wrong with it it perfect on my screen :)
,go4anand,2009-08-17T14:59Z,"Nice movie

"
,hitm4n-23,2009-08-17T20:51Z,"hey thank you for the torrent! , 
but it's a no go.. the video aspect ratio is misencoded.
Using Gom player to watch on pc is ok with ctrl-2and8 you can correct it , but not watchable on a standalone dvd or ps3...."
,megafan,2009-08-18T09:18Z,this is a gr8 film....russell crowe at his best!!!!
,Corgs,2009-08-19T00:11Z,Over 3000 and some seeding but no one is putting out any more them 1/kb come peep seed  share and share a like..............
,cice2,2009-08-28T07:14Z,"Yup aspect ration is off, everyone is slimmer in the movie, to the benefit of crowe.  The globe looks weird in the beginning."
