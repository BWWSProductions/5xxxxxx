,someone2323,2009-08-21T00:42Z,"I was wondering if you could post any kind of torrent on targeting military aircraft and vehicles. Like, where to shoot them and where their weak points are."
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-08-21T03:17Z,"Try David's Tool Kit: 2008-01-03 02:52:23 GMT uploaded, last page of my torrents."
,cherrypersonee,2009-08-24T09:23Z," ... Know your enemy.

 Thanks Patriot. "
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-09-01T02:04Z,"You don't know how many messages I have got from civilians, and members of our police and military, thanking me for my contributions.  You have the same mentality many do with firearms: ""But what if a criminal/terrorist obtains one?""  Following your logic further, we should also ban bookstores which sold books to bad people.  Hell, lets ban stairs, cars, ladders, and knives, do you have any idea how many people get killed with all of those?

In the time I have began uploading torrents, I have had at least one million downloads to people, where nothing has went wrong.  Who knows, maybe someday in the future an idiot will use my books for something bad, but that is the price I am willing to pay to educate tens (or hundreds) of thousands more.  Even if a few bad apples download my material, a 99.999% success rate is good enough for me.  I go to bed every night knowing I made a difference, and nothing will ever change that.

And besides, how often do babies/mothers/children drive tanks or fly military aircraft? :)"
,32ndmir,2009-09-01T04:03Z,"I do wish to add to DTOMs comment and say that no matter what some lunatic is going to do harm in one way or another.  Big saying here in America, shit happens.  When it does it's up to the person facing it to deal with it.  Also I'm sure a couple mothers drive tanks in Iraq or something but lets face it, they joined the military knowing the risks.  Also you're more likely to fall down stairs than get shot, let alone blown to hell by a terrorist.  "
,32ndmir,2009-09-01T04:04Z,"Ah, right thank you for the uploads DTOM.  "
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-09-01T17:38Z,"The things I release are not some top secret manuals I stole from an underground vault.  All of these are rips of material you could buy at online book or DVD selling websites.  If a bad person has the will to make poison gas, an IED, or a GPS scrambler, learn snipping techniques (taken from your message), what makes you think they wouldn't have the will power to spend $20 on the book, or use google (which is what I used to find a fair amount of my content).

Regardless of your fears, once I find/create a tracker to resume uploading on, I will resume my duties immediately, so you better learn to start coping.  I am not trying to stop you from complaining, everyone has the right to speak their mind, all I am saying is you are having no impact on what I am doing, that is all.  It is quite clear you have a lack of perspective on the issue.  And quite frankly, I could care less if you would be worried if you uploaded anything.

Please, just save yourself the time and stop arguing with me.  You are not going to change my mind, and you are not going to find many people here who will side with you.  Here, type in ""gun forum,"" and feel free to go over and and terrorists as well, I am sure they would enjoy you there.

I know I am wasting my time talking to you, I don't know why I spent the last few minutes doing so...

Here is to a million more downloads, I dedicate them to melly2222."
,8881881,2009-09-02T02:55Z,Don't worry Melly. I'm sure law enforcement agency are way advanced than us (and those little kiddies who want to be Rambo or Solid Snake).
,8881881,2009-09-02T02:55Z,I mean agencies.
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-09-02T04:02Z,"He makes a good point.  Every LE agency nationwide can afford gunships, spy drones, thermal vision, and Death Stars."
,evilcheesewhiz,2009-09-05T11:17Z,"You dont have to worry about small time torrents making it into the hands of terrorists out there, (no offense DTOM, and thanks much for the uploads!)  What you should lose sleep at night over is these terrorist organizations ability to gain access to full-blown US military aviation, urban warfare, and demolition manuals.  You know, the ones that have been FOUND, IN ORIGINAL PRINT, INSIDE terrorist hide outs?  That is what should paralyze you with a combination of fear, and the shits."
,OctopusCrime,2009-09-06T16:03Z,"To Melly2222:
Watch the movies 'Brazil' and 'Wag the Dog'.
Excerpts:
Brazil:""How many terrorists have you actually seen""?
Wag the Dog:""The war is over, I saw it on TV"".

The only terrorists are the governments who are fighting desperately to retain the power and control that they have.  No loss of life is too great to retain their illusion of control.
The only protection you have from 'the powers that be' is belief in Christ and your ability to circumvent the methods used by your governments to silence (permanently with extreme prejudice) and control the population.
If you don't know how they operate, how can you protect yourself?

Don't believe everything you see on TV, the more studying you do on 9/11 and terrorism, you may be surprised to find that the real terrorists are already ""dug in deeper than an Alabama tick"" (hunkered down).  You CANNOT remove or harm the governments, only Christ with his angels can do that.  You're only chance for prevailing on this 'physical' realm is accumulation of knowledge for defense, not attack.

MAT 24:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
MAT 24:31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

REV 19:19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.

What is ""The Beast"" and who is the ""False Prophet"".  Questions that shall soon be answered.  Do your homework.

2TI 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

JER 29:19 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending [them]; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.

ECC 1:18 For in much wisdom [is] much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

Matrix:""Ignorance is bliss"".

Peace and love to you all.
May God bless and keep all of you in the times to come.

To DTOM:  Many thanks for all the information you've provided so far.

Webster's take on Terrorism:
ter-ror-ism (ter'uh riz uhm)  n. 
1.  the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, esp. for political purposes.
2.  the state of fear and submission so produced.
3.  government or resistance to government by 
means of terror."

Peace."

Hope that was not a reply to me .. ie I hope you did not misunderstand me. We all know that most law enforcement agencies could some day be turned against the people to enforce unjust laws or even tyranny. More and more often I see police officers dressed in combat gear , combat boots and acting like they own us.  Better to be prepared and not need it than not being prepared and needing it . Right ?   "
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-09-11T01:05Z,"That was not a comment directed at you at all.  Not only that, I completely understand what you are saying.  The comment I was replying to (melly2222) is not showing up for some reason.  Anyway, not everyone will accept the scheme, and follow it.  I wish I could find it, there was a poll taken by members of the armed forces whether they would be able to kill American civilians if they were ordered to, and I believe the vast majority said no.  So all is not lost with our members of law enforcement and the armed forces, not by a long shot."
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-09-22T09:19Z,"You know if I could find a better copy I would post it, there is still a lot of information in here."
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-09-22T21:59Z,"Don't worry about it.  Trust me, it is pretty hard to find QUALITY information on the internet.  I purchase barely anything that I post here, 99% of the stuff here I find elsewhere online."
,philmccrevice,2009-09-26T06:47Z,"Quality info is easy,quality people on the other hand"
[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2009-09-27T07:55Z,"It is easy to an extent.  Try finding me an uncensored copy of this book then, and I will buy you torrent hosting for a year. ;)"
,lahara,2009-11-17T05:21Z,"One question, what is this information useful for? To counter DEA surveillance? I am not growing anything illegal, so would this be useful in future use in case of Codex Alumentarius or something like that?"
