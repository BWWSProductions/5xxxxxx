Technical details

This Trojan downloads other files via the Internet without the knowledge or consent of the user.

The Trojan itself is a Windows PE EXE file written in Delphi. It is not packed in any way. The file is 47616 bytes in size.
Payload

Once launched, the Trojan downloads a file from the following URL:
http://z10.***load.com/file.php?filepath=5855

It saves this file to the Windows system directory as %System%\cms.jpg. This file will be detected by Kaspersky Anti-Virus as Trojan-Spy.Win32.Banbra.df.

The Trojan will continue to run until the file has been successfully downloaded. The Trojan will then launch the file for execution and cease running.

The path to the file which is downloaded may vary according to the Trojan variant.


Here are the removal instructions:

   1. Use Task Manager to terminate the Trojan process.
   2. Delete the original Trojan file (its location will depend on how it originally penetrated the victim machine).
   3. Delete the file downloaded by the Trojan:

      %System%\cms.jpg

   4. Update your antivirus databases and perform a full scan of the computer (download a trial version of Kaspersky Anti-Virus)."
