,davkal2010,2009-08-17T05:36Z,Thanks man...freaking time lol.. maybe you can work on getting some better quality ones for us??????????? i would greatly appreciate it
,smellinitup,2009-09-17T23:59Z,FOUND THIS     http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5059302/Beachbody_-_Insanity_-_CUSTOM_DVD
,Mash4490,2009-10-03T12:41Z,What's wrong with the format? Why don't you guys stop complaining and get a free codec to read the format and burn the videos to a DVD? Thanks very much for the torrent because i was looking for the right program that was the shortest result time. P90X was good but everything that was required for it just seemed to be a hassle.
,halucin8,2009-10-08T15:24Z,Wow...it's amazing how much ppl complain and how ungrateful they can be! This download rocks. It looks great on my PS3. But of coarse just about everything looks good on that system. Thanks starvingstudent!
,ibtc972,2009-10-18T07:16Z,"Seriously...I downloaded it and to tell the truth, no, the quality isn't the best. But you can still tell what to do.

And it's not that big of a problem to change the format yourself.

Thanks for a great torrent! I'll be seeding past 1.00"
,biggauges85,2009-12-16T00:39Z,"boba-fett, what the fuck is your problem? you get it for free and complain? mp4 is not useless. just a different format for different purposes. if you really want AVI that bad then use format factory to convert it. or convertxtodvd to burn. fuckin' noobs."
,spartan45,2009-12-31T04:28Z,this is cool thanks for taking the time much appreciated. new years rez an all!
,dlbrody69,2009-12-31T22:28Z,"The other ""custom dvd"" torrent is good, just that the structure wont work on my DVD player..so thanks for these..I'll convert it myself."
,ufearus,2010-01-03T03:19Z,FUCKIN WANKERS.....STOP BITCHIN.....LEARN HOW TO USE A PC FUCKERS
,Don_casanova,2010-01-06T07:25Z,wow there are so many people downloading this vid n its taking me ages to do so but i did download the cardio one...can some one please please please show me how to make it a format that will play on my dvd player. I have the cardio one on dvd but it only plays in my laptop not dvd so if someone could help me out with a  step by step that would be awsom
,VagrantX,2010-01-09T08:42Z,"VLC PLayer will play the mp4 if you don't have the right media player/codec or multi format dvd player.  If you have a basic DVD player your going to have to go thru the hastle of formatting to DVD (mpeg-2 I believe)then burning the ISO to a disc.  I plug my laptop into my TV so, no problem here.  Thanks for the torrent!"
,mindtech1,2010-01-13T14:17Z,Thanks for getting this.... I hope it works
,Don_casanova,2010-01-14T20:58Z,Can some one please please please tell me how to convert the vid from MP4. I would like to play it on my basic dvd player but i cant. Can some one any one help me i have no clue what i am doing.
,Flummar,2010-01-16T12:16Z,"Don_casanova, read here: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=convert+mp4+to+avi
Not that hard, is it?"
,ts365108,2010-01-22T17:51Z,is this the p90x system?
,naossoan,2010-03-18T01:31Z,"No, it's the Insanity program. P90X is something else entirely."
,dhaa01,2010-03-19T08:40Z,Thanks man... this is INSANITY.... 60 days from now ... dude.
,puzzles,2010-04-06T22:07Z,"Thank you, sir. This is a nice download for those of us who know they are way too out of shape to make it through the full 60 days."
,thematt85,2010-04-29T14:49Z,"can i just watch these on my computer without

,Kolbath,2010-05-11T00:00Z,"Excellent UP. This is similar to what I used to condition as an Olympic tryout wrestler. Bodyweights FTW! 

Just turned 36 two weeks ago... If I can do it, YOU can do it! Stop making excuses and get your fat ass off the computer and away from the doritos!

If you're really out of shape and have a lot of excess body fat, you will struggle with this.
But keep at it and this will literally melt the fat off you.
To starvingstudent, thanks for the great torrent!"

,samljer,2011-03-30T08:32Z,"If you have been idle and lazy for awhile
and have excess fat, dont start here its gunna kill ya.
Go for P90, then after that, P90X they are almost as hardcore, but would suit you better.

Insanity can give you a heart attack if you have
underlaying obese issues, cholesterol, etc heres your fair warning.

IF you been idle for awhile, dont start here."
,Steeler025,2011-04-03T17:38Z,"only a few videos work, everytime i try to view a different one it says there was a bad movie atom found in them? and i tried to open it with a different media source and no go.... anyone have a player that plays all these so i can copy them to dvd?"

,digital3721,2011-12-28T18:40Z,Can someone please seed. Thank you!
,honkyjesuseternal,2012-02-18T18:53Z,"To the person or persons hyping up P90X, I like those DVD's but the problem with them is you need all these extras peripherals. For P90X2, they are literally doing push ups with three basketballs. Just about all the chest workouts for P90X involve push ups... instead of doing dumbell flyes they have you doing an alternate push up for it. Seems like half the back workouts involve a pull up bar. If you do not have a pull up bar, there really isn't any way to get the same motion.

Haven't tried this Insanity yet, but my wife has found P90X as a muscle gainer. It shouldn't be used as a cardio, or especially fat burner."
