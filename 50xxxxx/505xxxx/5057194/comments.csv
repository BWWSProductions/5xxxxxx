,arcdbrgd,2010-03-16T01:50Z,I'm having trouble burning the .iso... I burnt it at 2x and I did it the same way I burnt Mario Kart before which worked fine. Anything else I'm supposed to be doing with this?
,arcdbrgd,2010-03-16T01:53Z,"By the way, the problem usually occurs when it's verifying the disk at the end. I'm using Disk Utility on my Mac but tried other programs as well and I'm having the same problem all the way at the end of the process.

When I put it into my Wii it won't work, but as soon as I take the disc out I get a message saying ""Please insert your Super Mario Galaxy disc"" or whatever in the SMG font and everything."
,unknownMK,2010-03-18T13:33Z,This sin't working on my hard modded wii.
,i_reckoner,2010-05-03T05:05Z,"hey can somebody explain more about lagging games? ive download a lot of super mario galaxy copies but none has worked on my hardmodded wii, i mean, the game is lagging on the cutscenes! but it only happens w/ mario galaxy and mario kart! so frustrating =( i got a drivekey chip, all other games run well... can u help me? brazilian here =P"
,macmutt,2010-05-11T16:37Z,"Does this or any of the Wii game torrents work without a modded Wii, just a regular Wii ?"
,WJoh,2010-05-25T00:27Z,"@MacMutt
The short answer is no. You must mod your Wii for things to work. But it doesn't have to be a hard mod (mod chip). It can be a soft mod (software only) to get it to work.

My wii is a softmod and I run everything off a HDD. I don't bother with burning to discs. For me there's no point, as I only modded my wii because I got sick of swapping my discs all the time!"
