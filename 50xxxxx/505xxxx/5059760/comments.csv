Fuck the guy above who bitched about other uploads. With games being 6GB and bigger...you cannot have too many uploads. It helps spread the fun!!!"

And Activision didn't develop this, they're just a publisher. It was id and Raven."
,Medevila,2010-11-20T21:30Z,"@swebarb, This one seems to be the most complete, cracked, DVD quality one I've found so far. Thanks extremezone!"
