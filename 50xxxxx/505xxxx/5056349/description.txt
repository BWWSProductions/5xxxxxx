 In this highly anticipated next installment in the Age of Empires franchise
 from Ensemble Studios, Age of Empires III places players in the time period
 of roughly 1500ï¿½1850, picking up where Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings
 left off. As players work to establish their empire, they take on the role
 of a European power struggling to explore, colonize, and conquer North and
 South America.

 Age of Empires III introduces exciting new gameplay elements, including the
 all-new Home City and an incredible combat system. Players have new
 civilizations to discover, random maps to conquer, and a single-player
 campaign unlike any other. Players also find stunning graphics as a result
 of a revolutionary graphics engine that pushes the limits of PC graphics
 technology in an entirely new way.
