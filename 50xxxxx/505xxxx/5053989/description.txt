FreeBASIC is a 32-bit native code compiler whose tool chain currently targets GNU assembler, but a GCC emitter is in the works.

It can target win32, dos, linux, and albeit experimentally bsd and original xbox(xbox support is unsupported, but older versions may still work...)

In plain english, this can make exe and dll files from BASIC source!
Even though it is BASIC, it does support a lot of concepts from both
Visual BASIC
and C

some OO is now implemented!

Floating point Math can be x87, SSe, SSe2

ex: structs(C) -> udt (FB)
pointers
constructors/destructors
#pragma


additionally it can support C/C++ dlls
and it's dlls can likewise be used in C/C++

VB5/6 dlls can be used using DispHelper (or AxSuite for more umph,.. ie vtables..)
and FB's dlls can also be used in vb, just
declare them as you would a dll made in C.

Many libraries have been setup to work in FB:
OpenGL, DirectX, Allegro, SDL, sockets, HGE,
to name a few. I hear someone is also working on a
HAVOC wrapper for phys-X chips as well....

Even though you have to build your own message pump (like you would in C) you can build GUI programs in addition to standard console programs

The power of C/C++, but the flexibility of BASIC.. best combo ever!
