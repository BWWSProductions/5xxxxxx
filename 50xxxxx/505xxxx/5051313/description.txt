KIDS TODAY HEROES FOREER

Buckle up and prepare for a ride thatâ€™s out of this world!  when earth is threatened with imminent destruction, an out-of-shape, out-of-work and over-the-hill former superhero is called back into action to save the day.

That hero is Jack Shepard a.k.a.  â€œCaptain Zoomâ€ (Tim Allen).  The problem is heâ€™s lost all his powers.  And now, itâ€™s up to General Larraby (Rip Torn) and Dr. Grant (Chevy Chase) to coax him into taking on one more mission:  train a ragtag bunch of kids with amazing superpowers of their own.  With help from the brainy Marsha Holloway (Courteney Cox), theyâ€™ll learn to work as a team and harness their powers to battle an evil menace whoâ€™s determined to make one seriously huge mess of life as we know it.
