first off, there is Atheism is NOT logically connected to a lack of values.
you do not need a god to live a good life.
I owuld argue even that it is the opposite of atheist being connected to a lack of morals.
Theists follow a set of moral guidlines--there is no questioning whether it is right or wrong, simply blind faith. So they are more likley (and do) believe in things immoral, that to an atheist is seen as immoral.
Either way yu are right, it doesnt mean that religion is right, nor does it mean it is any better."
