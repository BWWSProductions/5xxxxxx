,nevarine,2009-08-15T10:23Z,"Penumbre, you are my new hero (My last one was Powdered toast man)"
,barvoet,2009-08-15T11:42Z,"Geweldig, lang op gewacht,
If someone from mars woulld get rosetta to research terrestrial speach, he would conclude that planet earth were the ultmate posh speaking planet of the universe.;)"
,barvoet,2009-08-15T11:54Z,"I will study this one and comment its content, and maybe add a short description of dutch constituent order, syntax to go with it; version 2 is rather weak in this aspect. (I am a teacher of dutch to foreigners)"
,nevarine,2009-08-15T22:25Z,"It doesn't work with Rosetta Stone v3.3.7. 
Doesn't recognize the CD. "
,tinspeed,2009-08-15T23:18Z,This is very helpful. Thanks.
,barvoet,2009-08-16T16:09Z,"@nevarine; try the deifeid version in his eleven language package, that application takes everything, he even made a tutorial about how to install, if you uninstall your current application rosetta seems to leave bugs which are going to clash whit your new app, i used revo uninstaller to sweep everything out. before reinstalling."

,Penumbre,2009-08-20T11:30Z,"@nevarine
I know for sure it works with the torrent I recommend in the description, V3.3.5

,246815243,2009-08-24T00:58Z,"Okay, so I'm having some trouble with this. I've tried looking up a solution, but nothing works. I have extracted and burned Level 1 onto a CD. But Rosetta Stone doesn't see that I have the Dutch language pack in there."
,Penumbre,2009-08-28T01:09Z,"@246815243 

As I understand Roseeta Stone V3.3.7 is having trouble reading these (no idea why). Version 3.3.5 DOES read them correctly."
,Haxs4Nubs,2009-09-12T00:35Z,Installs fine but it says it requires activation :S
,micky_henderson,2009-10-09T20:06Z,Any way to have this work for  V3.3.7. That is the one I have.
,johnnyfortner,2009-10-27T18:46Z,"these do not work with the rosetta you provided, it simply says cannot locate disc. ive mounted them on a virtual drive and ive also burnt it to a dvd, nothing works."
,UsmcKolo,2009-12-08T17:30Z,"Works fine for me except when I get to the 3rd chapter thing on part one it says it needs a serial number thing to continue
 how do I fix? anyone know the key?
Thanks"
,genuzz,2010-04-20T22:25Z,Guys! Seed it please it responds with no seeders all the time. ty cheers! Bedankt
,Relex4,2010-05-05T16:05Z,"Thank you for your share. Do you have its audio companion. or does someone know where I can download it?

Thanks a lot in advance!"
,trollking,2010-07-30T10:28Z,"For all who seem to be having trouble with the activation... once you have installed Rosetta Stone open the Crack file, copy the file contents and paste it to the Existing Rosetta Stone Version3.exe to overwrite the file. This should allow you to use the program without any problems."
,trollking,2010-07-30T10:34Z,"Also, a lot of the lessons have already been completed so I encourage anyone to do this step before using the program, otherwise you might lose you progress."
,Lomedin,2011-03-23T14:21Z,"Followed all your instructions Penumbre (downloaded and installed your cracked V3.3.5 and all that), the program doesn't locate the CD. It might be a problem with the burnt CD, although it seems fine, and I see that other people have the same problem. As far as I can tell right now, these don't work.
[Tried in Windows 7]"
,Lomedin,2011-03-24T02:32Z,"Follow up: I tried mounting the isos with Daemon Lite and it works fine without having to burn them into a CD.
I'm sure a bit of help in the description regarding this would help people who aren't familiar with those tools =)"
,mmtucker,2011-04-14T16:15Z,Please can someone help me after level 3 it wont let me do anything till i activate it. Please someone explain how to get around this! Thanks
,D3nn1s10,2011-07-02T02:55Z,"uh y is it that when i download it is just files -.- do i have to burn them on to a CD or DVD and if I do, should I burn each of the levels on separate disc?"
,KeeganS,2011-08-04T19:57Z,Does anyone know where to get the audio companion for the Dutch ones?
,BigBitGlen,2011-09-07T14:53Z,"Hi, new to all this. I have Rosetta application and have installed the 3 lang packs. But I can not use them until I have put an activation code to open the 3 lessons.

Am I missing something?

Cheers

,sasblack,2012-04-07T19:37Z,"I cant get it working either with the linked version of RS. Getting the no cd error. I have used DT and MagicDisc. Any help would be appreciated.
OS:Windows 7"
,sasblack,2012-04-07T19:42Z,EDIT: I had to change the device type in DT from the default to DVDROM appears to be working now.
,muveluvr,2012-04-12T00:03Z,hey all why don't you just load on to power iso then add to your language lesson?  works for me with other language packs.
