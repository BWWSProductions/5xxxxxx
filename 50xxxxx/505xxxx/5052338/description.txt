It's very good software to change any image file to ICON.
IRFAN VIEW is the software mainly designed to view the graphics and editing them.(Also it opens videos too)

But I feel it very easy to convert image file into icon.Just open image and save as .ico and your image is now convered into icon,So you can use such icon anywhere(either to represent any folder;or any hard drive or my computer etc.)

Irfan view is open source and you can download from its home page easily free of cost.I have just uploaded it becasue for those users who want to make their own icon files.Many people may bother to search ICON maker software which are not free)So for those it is best software WHOSE THOUGH MAIN IS NOT ICON MAKER BUT VERY EASILY MAKES ICON.


any types of bad or good comments are welcomed.

I had uploaded this torrent on demonoid too.I have uploaded here for those who are not getting chance to regester on demonoid.
