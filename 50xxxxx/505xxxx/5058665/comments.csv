@Stoney just wait, it's taking one moment."
,MtMCooLBG,2009-08-19T05:38Z,"It says Heroes III because the base port i used is from Heroes III. The game takes a litle long time to start for first time. If for some reason it don't start force quit it and try again, it should start.

About the buggy ground. I notice that sometimes when you start a misssion that bug may apply. It is a random bug and i have no idea why its happening. It happens to me at the ~10th time i started the game. Restarting the mission or the game fix the it but its a litle about luck :P 

Dont blame me too much its my first ported game :) any help, suggestions and advices are welcome."
,MtMCooLBG,2009-08-19T05:40Z,I also noticed that the shadows sometimes differs from the original objects. If that annoys you just turn the shadows off from the game options.
,MtMCooLBG,2009-08-19T12:59Z,"Yeah, its not tested on GMA, only on my machine. Thats why i need to know on what configuration there are problems. I i think i readed somewhere before that this kind of port dont run on GMA. 

For the others if you dont try it you will never know does it works ;)"
,DocRockIt,2009-08-20T15:21Z,"@MtMCooLBG: I have a MBP 2,4 Ghz, 4 GB Ram and also a 8600M GT card.
Shadows are messed up and there are grid lines in the outside ereas. Second Level has no Textures.

Do you have the same glitches?

And what is NVEnabler, you mentioned it in your ReadMe?

Thanks for the Up!"
,MtMCooLBG,2009-08-20T21:50Z,"Yes i have them, but on random start of the game. I mean that somotimes when i start the game everything is ok, but sometimes there are these glitches like missing terrain and/or gray ground like cluds or smoke.

At the moment im working on the network problems with the game and with another game im porting; and ill start looking for solution for these graphic bugs as soon as possible. I guess it may be from wrong/missing preferences/registry or from old dll rendering files like d3d9.dll or something else.

Also i need every possible configuration on wich the game was tested. I mean not only if there are bugs, but also if the game is working good. Just post your opinion and your config.

DocRockIt, 
Im not using a mac machine, im using a PC with MacOS(also known as OSx86) and NVEnabler is the video driver. I writed that because its important for th?se who dont have macs and use hackintoshes instead :P"
,DocRockIt,2009-08-21T17:33Z,"Please mention, next time, that you have encountered glitches and problems with the game, thx."
,MtMCooLBG,2009-08-22T00:24Z,"Sry about that, but when i created and tested the game i started it 4-5 times and played for few hours. At that time the only glitch that i found was with the shadows. I didnt enconter with the buggy terrain. So sorry about that. It happens at the nex day when i tried to play."
,DocRockIt,2009-08-22T17:16Z,"Nontheless, your uploads are much appreciated!

Thanks again and happy porting!  ;)"
