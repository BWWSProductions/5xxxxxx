,MrCabana,2009-08-14T08:19Z,"It works fine man, but for some reason it deactivates my Vista in another partition. I guess it messes up with the SLC info in my BIOS"

,Da_Man_1971,2009-08-18T03:03Z,"This works 100%. I've just install Windows 7 Version 6.1 (Build 7600) RTM version, no serial number neede :-) I then downloaded and ran this activation, it worked. It automatically installed a windows serial number for me and after a re-start of Windows 7, I was on Microsofts Windows update installing about 4 updates.

Thank you :-)"
,mike8519,2009-08-18T05:41Z,"Worked on my system.  Says the loader is not installed, but it is activated.

What about those who do not have win 7 installed on c:? friend of mine has it on a separate non c: partition and it keeps looking at c: anyway and fails obviously. Any runtime parameters to set?"

[T],budakrist,2009-08-20T13:02Z,"Used this with x86 version running on Virtualbox had a little trouble but i got it to work. Make sure you click on all the logos that apply to the computer your using and then ""install 7loader"" that seemed to work for me. I'm getting the x64 version to test installed on the computer instead of virtualbox. "

I had trouble activating my Dell XPS 410.

Used the Dimension 9200(=XPS 410) bios mod to successfully activate. "
,ryaxin,2009-09-03T15:34Z,"ok, so i have a fresh install with Windows 7 Ultimate OEM x64. I've disabled UAC and have also disabled the Windows updates. I've also disabled my internet connection just to be safe.

I've confirmed that my SLIC is v.2.0

All I need to do now is 'install 7Loader' and that is it?

And the executable is to be saved under c:/windows ?

Am I missing any other steps?

,ReeceRich,2009-09-06T23:47Z,"could i run this loader and successfully install and activate 7 on a hardrive that i have put on my current vista computer
