,PhatElvis,2009-08-14T08:04Z,"Very Tasty Teo, 
Worked like a charm with the gen key. Cheers!"
,TastyTeo,2009-08-14T18:07Z,The Mininova Users said the same to me:D
,tycowen,2009-08-21T11:57Z,"hey so i opened up the installer, then got to the screen where i needed to enter the given info in the .txt file. it keeps saying that i need a valid key, whats up?"
,tycowen,2009-08-21T11:58Z,"i forgot to mention i actually put the info in, and tried several times"
,vaderfet,2009-08-26T04:49Z,"This whole torrent looks suspicious to me. The text file serial number doesn't work and the keygen is setting off my AV software.

I say if you really want to risk executing the keygen, use sandboxie: 

http://www.sandboxie.com/

FYI, the old 6.0.1 ZWT keygen works fine with this release."
,vaderfet,2009-08-26T04:59Z,"Just as I thought, the keygen for this doesn't even work.

DO NOT ACTIVATE THIS KEYGEN, IT'S INFECTED WITH A VIRUS!

The old ZWT keygen works with this same installer."
,vaderfet,2009-08-26T05:19Z,"A little more research and I found that the old ZWT 6.0.1 keygen works for the 6.0.3 download from the techsmith site:

http://download.techsmith.com/camtasiastudio/enu/camtasiaup.msi 

and it will most likely work for all version 6's until techsmith changes their software protection."
,TastyTeo,2009-08-26T21:57Z,"Of Course, please seed my torrent, hope the keygen works to everyone"

Very Tasty Teo,
Worked like a charm with the gen key. Cheers!

LMFAO, theres a virus in the keygen 
get a viruskiller nooob"
,gabriel1475,2009-10-14T01:47Z,"The only noob is you.  Nearly all anti-virus programs recognize keygens as a ""virus""....nub."
,Metroidn1f,2009-11-01T18:51Z,"AVG Detected Key gen to be a virus, and it would not open, even tried to run as admin, and the Serial did not work as well."
,TastyTeo,2009-11-07T21:43Z,"All of you are so noobs, the keygen is a virus because it is a hacking tool! Feel it...
Right click the icon of your A/V and turn it off then open the keygen generate a key, copy it, then close the keygen, activate your A/V paste the key to Camtasia Studio, and then you are ready....

GET AVAST ANTIVIRUS... IT DETECTS EVERYTHING SUSPICIOUS!!! DAMMIT!!! AND EASY TO USE!"
,Koni3czk0,2010-01-01T21:25Z,works great thx.
[T],xxThugxx,2010-01-03T12:34Z,"keygens often set off av suit warnings, is becuase heuristics and the fact keygens have the ability to generate random code, that action would be seen as suspicious to an av suite, if you are concerned about infections just dont download it.............."
,Snakeyes88,2010-01-03T20:26Z,"I'm no noob at this, and know keygens set off false positives as viruses...

However, I DO run Avast, and this is the first time it's ever flagged a keygen I've d/l'ed as a virus.

Additionally, the keygen won't run.  And why do you need a keygen if there is a serial number (that no longer works) in the text file?"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-01-04T17:27Z,"i just downloaded this from another site, then this 1 to compare. size same, same key, same issue it is invalid, and Norton 2010 on windows 7 comes up trjan & so dooes spyweeper. & f.y.i.  Trjan is actually spyware, not a virus, but all the same, im not happy with this upload, if it worked in past, thats history today."
,StevenK08,2010-02-15T00:59Z,"Not safe. 

Keygen is reported as a virus, and the key provided in the text file is invalid."
,TastyTeo,2010-04-22T15:57Z,OMG NOT AGAIN!!!!!
