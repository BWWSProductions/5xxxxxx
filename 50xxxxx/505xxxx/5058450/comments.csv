Red popup stating key is invalid."
,swetlander2574,2009-08-19T03:42Z,"Do what I did and you
won't have to worry about the 
red popup saying your key is invalid
ever again.

1. Un-install avast

2- Re-install avast and set all updates
to manual. 

3- When you see the avast icon in 
the tray, right click it and go to 
program settings.

4- From there, make sure both the 
program and virus database updates
are set to manual.

5- And from then on, ONLY update
the virus databes, NEVER update the
program itself.

6- And now you don't have to worry 
about the red popup ever again."
