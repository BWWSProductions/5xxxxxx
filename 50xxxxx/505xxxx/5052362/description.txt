Burning Man: Just Add Couches (2001)

Finally, a sequel that surpasses the original: filmmaker Joe Winston and his pals return to participate in the Burning Man Festival. Packed with humor and surprises, "Burning Man: Just Add Couches" strips away all pretense and gets right down to the essence of what it's like to put on a desert freak show.

One year after "The Burning Man Festival," the same guys return to participate in the event. Seeking to create an average American living room in the harsh environment of the Black Rock Desert, they lug out couches, a tent, satellite TV, and a fridge full of cold beer. Not content to simply lounge, they also construct an untested invention called "The Minute of Fame Booth." An excellent companion piece to "The Burning Man Festival."
