Beowulf & Grendel is a 2005 film loosely based on the Anglo-Saxon epic poem
Beowulf. Filmed in Iceland and directed by Sturla Gunnarsson, it stars Gerard
Butler as Beowulf, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd as Hrothgar, Ingvar Sigurdsson as Grendel
and Sarah Polley as the witch Selma. The film is a cooperative effort between
Eurasia Motion Pictures (Canada) Spice Factory (UK), and Bjolfskvida (Iceland).
The screenplay was written by Andrew Rai Berzins. The soundtrack was
composed by Hilmar Ã–rn Hilmarsson. The story takes place sometime during the
early half of the sixth century A.D. in what is now Denmark, but the filming of the
movie in Iceland provided many panoramic views of that country's unique
landscape.

While some of the film remains true to the original poem, other plot elements
deviate from the original poem (three new characters, Grendel's father, the witch
Selma, and Grendel's son are introduced and several related plot points were
developed specifically for the film).

In 2006, a documentary of the making of Beowulf and Grendel called Wrath of
Gods was released and went on to win several European film awards.


The blood-soaked tale of a Norse warrior's battle against the great and murderous
troll, Grendel. Heads will roll. Out of allegiance to the King Hrothgar, the much
respected Lord of the Danes, Beowulf leads a troop of warriors across the sea to
rid a village of the marauding monster. The monster, Grendel, is not a creature of
mythic powers, but one of flesh and blood - immense flesh and raging blood, driven
by a vengeance from being wronged, while Beowulf, a victorious soldier in his own
right..
