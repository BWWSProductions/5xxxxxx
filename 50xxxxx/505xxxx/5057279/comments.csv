I am pretty sure that whoever has the movie rights to this lame, boring, repetitive, derivative soap opera is attempting to use TPB as a free viral advertising source (did they check with their lawyers?) for their upcoming project
And if you are advertising for a company affiliated with the MPAA, make sure to deduct the money from that suck-ass lawsuit meant to hobble a superior distribution service. Ask Johnny Depp and Tim Burton how much time they spend in dvd rental stores. Oh yeah, spammers and ad scum eat rat crotch.
If this comment offends mods, please accept my apology, I am only guessing that this is an advertisement, delete this post, not my account.
Thanks. "
