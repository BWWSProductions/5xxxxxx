Journey To The Flames: 8 Years of Burning Man (2006) 

For most of the year, the Black Rock Desert is a barren patch of sand, but for one week every summer, it's the site of one of the most unusual arts festivals on earth, Burning Man. This documentary follows several friends on their bohemian adventure. Director Doug Jacobson shows how roughly 38,000 revelers can create a city from scratch in this hostile terrain, dedicated to creativity and self-expression of all forms.
