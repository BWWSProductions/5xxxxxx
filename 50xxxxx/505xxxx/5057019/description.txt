Celtic Woman is one of the best the Celtic Woman have put out so far. It takes place at the Slane Castle in Ireland with the beautiful scenery of the Slane Castle and Ireland. Not only the scenery but the beautiful voice of the Celtic Woman take your breath away. I can watch this concert over and over and never get tired of it. You have Chloe who is only 18 years of age and such a beautiful voice that carries you away. Then you have MÃ¡irÃ©ad Nesbitt who plays the violin. She has such talent with the violin and she is so full of positive energy. Then you have Ã“rla Fallon, Lisa Kelly, and MÃ©av NÃ­ Mhaolchatha. They all have such beautiful voices that are truly the voices of Celtic Woman and most important the voice of Ireland. You have to get this DVD. You won't be disappointed at all.
