INTRO
Ever thought of having an Action Replay/Game Shark/Code Breaker for the Wii. Well now you can, by using the WAD MANAGER to install a channel. Works similarly to any Cheat Device known to man. AND YOU DONT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WII UPDATES that ruined the FREELOADER AFTER 3.3 BECAUSE IT STAYS ON YOUR MENU FOREVER (UNTIL YOU DELETE IT).


Description
This is an updated version of the Ocarina Channel. As always, I uploaded this to The Pirate Bay and Demonoid. The banner is better and looks nicer than the old pixelated one on my 1080i TV. The Old one is still included in the Old Pack. Overall, the old one lagged when entering it, but this one did not lag at all. It still works like the old one. Tested to work on my 4.0U Wii. 
*This has been tested to run backups of games with a HACK(as in if you can load a backup straight from the menu, then it will load from this channel), if you do not have a hack, it may not work. 
**Follow all instructions from www.wiibrew.org on how to install the codes and stuff
***Tested to work on Nintendo WiFi connection while playing an ORIGINAL MARIO KART WII. BUT DONT BE MEAN BECAUSE Geeks/Nerds/Losers/Assholes WORK VERY HARD TO ACHIEVE FIRST PLACE WHILE YOUR USING A STAR to pass everyone you think is gay
****I cannot be held responsible for bricks on the Wii. I tested it to work on my Wii with 4.0


WHY THE OCARINA CHANNEL IS A BETTER CHOICE THAN GECKO OS
-GECKO OS has screwed up my Wii when using the cheat function, in a way that i could not play the game i booted anymore through ANY METHOD POSSIBLE. This caused me to do the hacks all over again.
-Gecko OS loads from the HBC, NOT THE ACTUAL MENU
-You do not need a .dol file for the Ocarina Channel, as a Gecko OS channel would need one in the SD Card.
- Gecko OS may have unneeded features which are usualy from other .dol files
-IF U R COMFORTABLE WITH GECKO OS, USE IT EITHER THAN THIS

If you get banned online for the first time, you still can get unbanned (call Nintendo support and lie SAY that you will never do it again). That only works once (THE FIRST TIME) though. After that your only option is to get a new Wii and repeat the cheating process. I'm sure no one would cheat for a fourth time especially because that its mean . ALSO, IF YOU GET BANNED, I THINK UPDATING WILL UNBAN YOU
