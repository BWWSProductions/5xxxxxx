[T],torrentshredder,2009-08-19T09:30Z,"also get the (removed? why?) torrent from tpb that came with the packed rar files at:

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:VN55V6NLYT5Q3H4COYCDHCXZSPRNDICI

used to be here before:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5059786/Wolfenstein-Razor1911"
,jediuberknaft,2009-08-19T14:05Z,"For me, the game installed without any probs, then i applied the crack from Razor into the SP folder.

I made shortcut to desktop and start the game. All the adverstisement movies come up, but as soon as the game has to go into menu (i gues) it crashes and give me this message in a window:

- RB_SwitchRenderTarget: Image Is Not A Render Target. Under it i get a a lot of text in the window about everything that has been loaded ..

Anyone has the same problem ??

Im on Windows Vista 64bit. Everything is updated on my machine and play all games without any probs ..."
,0Evolve0,2009-08-20T02:44Z,Worked like a charm for me! Thanks
,jediuberknaft,2009-08-20T10:59Z,"Ok, i uninstalled the game. Then i installed the game again, exactly the same way as before. Then i downloaded the crack again from another site. Replaced the exe by this crack, and now the game works without any probs :-)

Its pretty ok game so far, graphics are ok too. Could be better, but it will do.

Thanks for the up :-)"
