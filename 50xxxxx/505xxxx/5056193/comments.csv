,JibbyJi,2009-08-17T03:14Z,Does this copy have English Subs?
,iShare4u,2009-08-17T04:59Z,"Your deliberate promotion of links to other movies that are TOTALLY unrelated to the movie on this page degrades the validity of The Pirate Bay's search engine.

See, when we search for a specific movie title that you included in one of your info links, (unrelated though it may be to the torrent itself) -- all your unrelated shit turns up when we search for that specific title.

So, no... I'm NOT pleased to see ""District 9"" in the search results when I was looking for ""Ice Age"".

You fucktard, STOP ADVERTISING YOUR TORRENTS!! If your vids are good, your reputation will be spread by ""word of mouth"". Let axxo be your guide.

People like you are turning Pirate Bay into a fucking spammy advertisement center for your other torrents."
,braesideboozas,2009-08-17T17:58Z,dont listen to CLOTANKLE...HE IS A CUNT....his site is shite...full of adware and viruses
,shade9912,2009-08-18T22:30Z,"@iShare4u 

dude shut  up.It's his torrent and he can do whatever he wants with it.

be grateful that extremezone actually uploads this stuff..if you dont like his torrents,then don't download them.wait for your trusted axxo to release the movie and then watch it.

thanks a lot extremezone."
,truhiphop,2009-08-20T05:46Z,"To the folks begging for invites to Demoniod:
Stop begging. It's annoying to see such lamers. It's not this place of mythical endless supply of torrents. You get the same stuff here... It's by invitation only for a reason...so evolve, gett enlightened and maybe you'll get an invite when you grow up :)"
,Phatfish,2009-08-23T18:09Z,"Audio is pretty descent, specialy for being TS.
But video is normal TS crap quality.
There is some TS that ima is watchable but I will pass on this one and wait."
,letmeon,2009-08-24T09:27Z,"video=7
audio=6

decent quality, 

@shade -all he did was ask him to stop advertising his other torrents in his description so the search engine would work better...."
,FULLMOON_1,2009-08-25T16:04Z,"It's Quality SUCKS! 

Don't wast ur time/internet!"
,eddiekav,2009-08-27T11:23Z,"anyone else having a problem with the tracker?, saying u have to sign up to zen7.?"
,darthnegate,2009-08-30T15:25Z,"Great quality
A: 8
V: 7(dark in the corners)
M: Only skipped through to make sure it all works and is aesthetically pleasing, so that means DNF.

Will Seed!"
,batsof0,2009-08-31T16:44Z,"secret_myth has the disctrict 9 version so far the best version, with english line. :))"
,almostaquad,2009-09-03T16:26Z,"A/7 V/8 started out with the audio out of sync and a blurry picture but that fixed itself. A little dark. 7 at the most! 
What's the deal with the The Pirate Bay? no new movies in a week.  Thanx Extremezone "
[T],dkent4000,2009-09-05T23:19Z,"Perfect torrent, thanks mate"
,saintchris23,2009-09-06T16:14Z,"Thanks for the upload but the audio and picture are both shocking. 

It's just a warning but unless you like watching movies in CAM format then I wouldn't waste your time downloadinng this turkey of a copy."
[T],dkent4000,2009-09-06T20:57Z,"I posted a positive comment without watching the video first... oops! Wish I never bothered downloading it, it's a load of crap - sorry! Picture is well dodgy."
,Windowz293,2009-09-13T04:04Z,SEEED PLEASE ONLY GET 25KB/S WANT TO WATCH IT TONIGHT PLEASE SEED
,redhare,2009-09-15T09:34Z,"Not bad.

But fell short of brilliant.

If the jokes had just been a bit funnier ...

They all need better writers.

Or maybe they all just couldn't be bothered really making an effort to make this a good film.

You seen the search titles only option?"
,axelmunthe,2009-09-24T22:25Z,"this is a CAM, quite bad and not viewable in my opinion..wasted 2 days of download..."
,ektakrome,2009-10-05T02:17Z,Man I have never found a movie that has taken this long to get a really good copy of it.
,Lucky13s,2009-10-10T08:45Z,"@axelmunthe

2 days of download? 2 days?! Jesus you have a super slow internet. High seeded downloads like this only take roughly 5 hours."
,avi_maxrisk,2009-10-13T20:05Z,when is dvd rip is gonna come..
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2009-11-08T01:44Z,"How about you guys keep your shit links that don't work and only ask you to fill out 6 surveys in order to watch a movie, out of this forum. No one needs it and I would hope that everyone by now would knows that the surveys are scams."
,lovedabay,2009-12-20T04:14Z,gee thanks for the santa logo
