NO IT ISN'T!
It's only in lousy Joint stereo, which isn't proper stereo at all, poor channel seperation and loss of high frequencies.
The ONLT true stereo with MP3 is Dual Channel (sometimes called dual stereo) where 2 seperate tracks are recorded, even stereo shares some data between left and right."
