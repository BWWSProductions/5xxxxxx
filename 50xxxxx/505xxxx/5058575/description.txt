Benny Hill pioneered new territory in broadcast television as he delighted--and often shocked--audiences all over the world with his brilliant sketch comedy. In the early 1980s, The Benny Hill Show hit new heights of hilarity with even more daring double entendres, tongue in chee ballads, and dance routines with the naughty and nubile Hill's Angels.
BENNY HILL: COMPLETE AND UNADULTERATED SET FIVE features new skits with Fred Scuttle and Chow Mein and includes the fan-favorite moments from "The Little Dimpton Street Party" and "The Hot Shoe Show." These nine episodes that originally aired between 1982 and 1985 deliver the same bold comedic kick-in-the-pants that first made the show a smash success.
