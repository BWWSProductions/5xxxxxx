The All Time Greatest Hits Of Dance 2 - Various Artists [1993]




I never had the first instalment of this album, but I will be on the lookout for it when out and about. And when did Annie Lennox become a dance act.  Anyway some classics here to look forward to, just download and pump up that mp3 player when on the go with the blasts from the pasts. And all this music for only 1Euro cant go wrong. Enjoy
