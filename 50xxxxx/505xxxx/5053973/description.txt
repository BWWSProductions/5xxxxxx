I got really bored and made a program sing and play
99 Bottles of Beer with regular ascii text and a midi-synth beer bottle being blown to the tune of .. You get the idea LOL

press any number key above qwertyuio (1 -> 9) to shorten the song to just
that many bottles of beer.

Alternately press Esc to quit.

This program is 100% Open source, Freeware, and CopyLeft.
If you want to print it out numerous times and wrap yourself up in the
print out (dotmatrix continuous feed works best for effect) and run around screaming I'm a mummy, I'm a mummy.. go right ahead.. :)
