Use your imagination and I'm sure you can come up with at least 200+ more excuses as to why your speeds suck.

Think about it, the ratio is 1/10, you're in competition with 10 other people to download off 1 person, and torrents upload on a first come first serve basis, so pretty much YOU have to wait for ""10"" people to fully download before you can start downloading off 1 seeder."

I had the same problem. What I did:
I use the program: ""Alcohol 100%"" insteed of ""Deamon Tools"" ro load the ISO. It tried many programs but Alcohol is the most stable program in my opinion. Sometimes the programs just stop with loading de ISO and then the game shutdown.
Also I big problem with the Razor games is my firewall! But when I turn it off when I play, I have no problem at all. So check you're Antivirus and Firewall."
,secretagent004,2009-09-07T09:20Z,"-------------


@ diablo : thanx for ur comments, those were encouraging..

but, (i hv KIS 2009 as my AV/Firewall) and i use PowerISO to mount the imgae and not Daemon (it sucks sumtimes..lol....)

also, i always disable my KIS2009 wenever i play any  game.. infact, i enable KIS2009 ONLY wen i want to go online (for emails or jus surfing)...
--------------------------


but still the problem is the same, but will giv ""Alcohol100%"" a try as u say adn then post it back here... :)
---------------------------

lets see.. :)

update: guys, i hv upped my upload speed from 2mbps to 3mbps..so enjoy the game and PLZ seed after u are done... (this goes for all the leechers as well who jus run away after getting the content...)

if (for those who are on a slower connection) u cant seed full 100% then plzx seed atleast 25% of wat u hv downloaded so tat u are NOT termed a total @$$ fcuker ...

and to joey, man you need to copy the cracked .exe file over the original game .exe i havent actually downloaded this torrent but sometimes they are packed in a folder on the iso file itself sometimes they are somewhere else.if you cant find the crack in the torrent i suggest you try gamecopyworld.com or some other place like that, maybe crackspider.net "
,Yakumo257,2009-12-08T01:28Z,"Great game, runs perfectly up to near the end in the castle mission. Everytime I try to go up the elevator to the inner keep it always crashes during the loading screen. Anyone know how to fix this or where I can find save files after this part? "

,drakosdarklata,2010-01-19T19:29Z,"It installs and loads great, but after a few minutes, it seems to flake out. After install, I went to gamecopyworld and dled the crack. What happens is that either immediately or after about 10 minutes, it will start to flash part of a previous screen in the left corner and occasionally there is no sound. It also seems to disable firing on my mp though all other weapons work. Finally, it tends to crash, like my whole pc, vertical purple 'alien' scipt seems to stream down the screen. I ran into this once before with NFSMW Black, but a good reset to dump the ram seemed to work, though not this time. 
I am running 3ghz CPU HT, NVidia GEForce 8500 GT with 1/2 gig ded ram, 2gig mb ram. I am running the game at mid-high settings with no lag and this machine can handle Crysis on low-mid, so I'm pretty sure it's not my hardware.
Any ideas?"

,drakosdarklata,2010-01-23T03:36Z,"Alright, the guy above me, annoying, really? Spamming on a forum? You suck, lol. Second, for those who bothered to read my previous comment about the game freezing and all that, I figured out the problem, of course I ended up reinstalling and all of that, but it was a simple fix. I change an option menu one at a time until it broke again and discovered something quite noobish on my part. I run 5.1 ssound. The game defaults to 7.1 when you select ssound. Translation=it breaks the game when you run 7.1 through 5.1 hardware. You can select the version of dolby you want, so, problem fixed, enjoy the game, it rocks balls."
,mega284,2010-01-27T21:04Z,"hi, im a noob t this so please help me, where is the crack? i installed the game successfully but the single player won't open it just says that it encountered a problem starting it and needed to close then asks me if i want to send an error report or not, please help"

,blahsington,2010-02-18T02:21Z,"Great torrent. Fun game and downloaded fast (I'm not one to usually complain about seeding). 

In the great tradition of torrenting games, i will break down this shit as simply as possible.

1. Once Downloaded, find where utorrent put the files and runs setup. 

2. Install the game with default settings.

3. Go to the Razor1911 folder and right click on the Wolfenstein.exe and clik copy.

4. Go to your program files, find the Activision folder, then go to wolfenstein, then go to the SP folder, then paste the file in here. Click copy and replace when asked.

Now your done. Just click on the wolfenstein.exe you pasted in this folder and wolfenstein should run. Also, you can play this game online a cracked server but I'm not telling how to do that. Just look it up."
