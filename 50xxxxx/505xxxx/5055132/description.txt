Ben Campbell is a young, highly intelligent, student at M.I.T.
in Boston who strives to succeed. Wanting a scholarship to
transfer to Harvard School of Medicine with the desire to 
become a doctor, Ben learns that he cannot afford the $300,000 
for the four to five years of schooling as he comes from a poor, 
working-class background. But one evening, Ben is introduced by 
his unorthodox math professor Micky Rosa into a small but 
secretive club of five. Students Jill, Choi, Kianna, and Fisher, 
who are being trained by Professor Rosa of the skill of card 
counting at blackjack. Intrigued by the desire to make money, 
Ben joins his new friends on secret weekend trips to Las Vegas 
where, using their skills of code talk and hand signals, they 
have Ben make hundreds of thousands of dollars in winning 
blackjack at casino after casino. Ben only wants to make 
enough money for the tuition to Harvard and then back out. 
But as fellow card counter, Jill Taylor, predicts, Ben 
becomes corrupted by greed and his arrogance at winning 
which lets his feelings get in the way, and it also puts 
Professor Rosa, as well as the group, on the radar of a 
brutal casino security enforcer, named Cole Williams, who 
holds a personal grudge of some kind against Rosa which 
threatens to undo everything the students have learned 
and earned.
