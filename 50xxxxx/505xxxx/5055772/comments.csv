,Sumsonfire,2009-10-24T08:14Z,"hi Mctav i greatly appreciate the work u do but i was wondering if it is possible for you to create torrents of all south parks in compressed rar format because they are alot easier to download and they are quicker and for someone like me whos internet isnt very fast it would make a real difference as it took me 5 or six days to download a single season 
thank you for all your work"
,SinWindow,2009-11-13T21:33Z,"Awesome downloads McTav, thanks a lot!


Hey sumsonfire, really? You're going to ask him to download rars on three different torrents like a damn spam artist?  Seriously thats weak, its not even 2 gigs, give me a break.  As from south park S13E12- shut up you fag!! "
,BigDownUnder,2009-12-23T08:19Z,"Sumsonfire*
Get faster internet or change your bittorrent software, Most people do not trust any file uploaded in .rar or .zip format. I am one of them people. "
,galdau88,2009-12-31T21:10Z,Thanks once again McTav.
,fredfredburgur69,2010-01-04T02:02Z,DId anyone else get this torrent as missing episode 10 Follow that Egg?

,paul_mc_uk,2010-02-22T15:05Z,"Just to repeat others, thanks a lot for these SP's, esp the early series, the ones before were of such poor quality elsewhere. Just found your rips today and will be getting lots of them. Thanks you very much for all the time and trouble you've taken just to benefit all us bitching downloaders!

Thanks again. "
,pure-krypton,2010-02-26T06:14Z,Pretty sure I have been busted downloading this torrent by http://www.baytsp.com/ who then sent an email to my isp. real cool.

,duressx,2010-05-30T00:30Z,Here's the missing episode: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5060003/South_Park_Season_9_Missing_Episode
,yorx22,2010-06-06T19:27Z,"mctav, as great as allways"
,AlbatronX,2010-09-21T21:33Z,u miss episode 10
,ilovemycomputer,2010-10-13T22:28Z,"BEWARE: This may or may not be mctav's fault, but warning everybody for future references!!! 
THE TRACKER ""http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce"" has been found in multiple southpark seasons from MCTav and upon research on google, the second result I found from this was
""denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969 is operated by MediaDefender and this blog is a ploy to trick people into using the tracker"". That said, that mediadefender is the one running this tracker, make sure you delete it before you do ANY sharing. Praise mctav for hosting these, but warning your fans!"
,ilovemycomputer,2010-10-14T00:19Z,"By the way the blog I was talking about in my previous comments on mctav's other torrents was: 
http://opentracker.blog.h3q.com/
This is a fake site, and even advises to using the tracker, which is operated by MediaDefender to track if you upload any of the torrents it's in, so they can nail you for it. Thats why you've gotten that stupid notice to cease and desist asap."
,Simon_p,2010-10-16T10:48Z,"Ur the greatest McTav, thx alot :D"
,omgkenny,2011-01-31T21:42Z,Thanks dude. :)
