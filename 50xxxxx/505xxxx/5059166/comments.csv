---------------------------------------
At the end of this week I am stepping down from the gordsmash title and giving it to my pal. I want to thank everyone for supporting gordsmash and uploading my torrents to keep them alive! I hoped that everyone of you has enjoyed my torrents! I want to thank all of you for supporting me! Thank you all and goodbye!"
,WhiteA9,2010-04-23T15:27Z,"Worst Tutorials ever. What a couple of twats these people are. Kudos to the uploader n all that but this was terrible to watch, these people whilst good in their field .. can't teach.
And the exercise files have been completed so they aren't much good unless you watch the tutorial, delete the changes that have been made then re-watch the tutorial and put back in what you've just deleted. 
Disappointing and old."

i have to agree they did not teach very well at all. I skimmed through some of the videos and all they were doing were talking with themselves. haha"

,asriel603,2012-07-24T11:02Z,"Thanks for the upload! I have the an issue though. When I try view the videos all I get is a white screen with the Lynda logo, though I can hear the audio just fine. Only some of the tutorial torrents I have downloaded do this. What's the reason for this?"
