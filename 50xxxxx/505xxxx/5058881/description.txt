this is the nokia 6220 classic service manual for people wanting to fix the handset yourself. you can buy parts from online mobile phone hardware stores. just google buy mobile phone parts with repair in it possibly.. something like that anyway!

i paid 3.50 for this manual which i am a bit peaved about as i found the manual just hours later online no cost!!! so im giving this back to the people.

take care
