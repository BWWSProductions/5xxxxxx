I've reuploaded Multiwinia because of the few other torrents having such low seed counts. 


Multiwinia is a simple strategy based game, in which you control unlimited armies in different game modes. The task is to become the victor, as with most RTS'. Multiplayer doesn't work with this version, and there's nothing I can do to fix it, sorry.


Directions:
-The torrent will automatically deposit the 'Multiwinia' folder to wherever you set as the completed directory. There's no zips.
-After it's there, and completed, just click, 'multiwinia.exe'. It'll start up the game. At the beginning, there'll be a serial code screen, just click 'Enter'. 
-That's it! You're done!

Have fun, and don't forget to seed!
