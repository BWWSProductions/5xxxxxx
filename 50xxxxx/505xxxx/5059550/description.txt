Plot summary for


The real world is knocking for college seniors Evan (Justin Isfeld, AMERICAN PIE) and 
Jake (comedian Joel Paul Reisig), but they dont want to answer the door. With graduation 
just a day away, the two frat boys enlist the help of an eighth-year senior who serves 
as a different kind of academic advisor and helps them earn a fifth year at their 
beloved school. FRATERNITY HOUSE takes place in one flash-filled, alcohol-fueled 
24-hour period.
