Life is Hot it Cracktown delves into the infiltration of crack cocaine in urban America and shows the gritty realities of street life, as well as the struggling, proud people who attempt to survive them everyday.

Highlighting four stories that come together in a climax of violence, depravity and salvation, Giovinazzoâ€™s Life is Hot in Cracktown may elevate itself to the ranks of Robert Altmanâ€™s Short Cuts and Paul Haggisâ€™ Crash. The film captures a realistic depiction of a modern day social epidemic- drug use and poverty.
