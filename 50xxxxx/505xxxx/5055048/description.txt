The is the 6th disc of a 6 disc limited edition set. I have scanned the cover which is the same for
front and back of the box and this is contained in the first disc torrent. I have omitted the 80 page
book that is included with the set because it would take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad
enough then buy the box set. This set is a combination of the soundtrack and follow up album with the
exception Ten Years After.

Pease note that some of these tracks were unissued and some are complete and original versions that
were unissued. Some of the tracks on the movie soundtrack are not original. Some of the bands that
played Woodstock refused to allow their music to be included in the collection. I hope in the future
these groups will issue their own Woodstock Experience album.


The Woodstock Project torrent is a collection of all the released original material as well as bootleg material but it has not been
updated as best as I can tell. In my spare time, I will try to update the set with the new material and
put it in proper chronological order.

If you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.

Please help seed these torrents. Enjoy.
