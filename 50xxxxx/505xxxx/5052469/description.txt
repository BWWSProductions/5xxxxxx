"Another Sad Love Song" is the first official single from Toni Braxton's self-titled debut album, Toni Braxton (1993). After the success of "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", Braxton followed up with this R&B mid-tempo single. The song proved to be a success, giving Braxton her first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 top ten hit (number seven) and her first Adult Contemporary hit (number eight), and narrowly missing the top position of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs by peaking at number two, being held from the summit by SWV's "Right Here/Human Nature"/"Downtown". Internationally, "Another Sad Love Song" reached number fifteen in the United Kingdom, number twenty-three in the Netherlands, and number sixty in Germany.

The music video was released in two different versions. The first version was filmed in black-and-white and featured the original music. The second version was filmed in color and was remixed to appeal to a wider audience. Both versions were successful and stayed in heavy rotation during the summer of 1993.

"Another Sad Love Song" earned Braxton her first Grammy Award, for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female in 1994.
