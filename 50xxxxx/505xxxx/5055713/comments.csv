,Jong5466,2009-08-18T16:22Z,Does it work on Vista 64x?
,nickakalilbj,2009-08-19T11:06Z,Yea Dude It Works
,petetheperkele,2009-08-19T23:49Z,"Works great, thanks!!!"
,Jong5466,2009-08-20T19:18Z,"Are you certain?
Perhaps you could state what sort of Vista you are using? If that happens to be a 32-bit OS, then the chances that it will work completely on 64x are minimal."

,askinkoc,2009-09-03T05:44Z,My question is about sound. i have dowloaded many times and all of those games do not have sound on videos. When i see the videos there is no any sound. Does it include all?
,Jong5466,2009-09-03T20:32Z,"Don't bother writing comments here.
The individual behind this torrent has a slightly limited vocabulary when it comes to the English language, therefore he intends to avoid our questions."
,Jong5466,2009-09-14T15:51Z,"Pardon me, but this version is far from compatible with the 64-bit version of Vista.

Which isn't at all what you claimed. You truly are an inferior for spreading an application that hasn't got a purpose, although it is similar to yourself.

I advice you to annihilate your filthy little self as soon as possible."

Im using Windows XP sp3, and this game works great! Great download and excellent trainer! I love going on shootouts! The only problem is that the radio loops the same songs and the same conversation on WCTR. But besides that, all is how it should be. Download and seed."
,FGras,2010-10-01T19:03Z,it doesnt even start downloading...
,FGras,2010-10-01T19:08Z,"i've said nothing, just had to start my PC up again."
,FGras,2010-10-01T19:26Z,"1,20 MB downloaded... and there are no P2P's"
,gamedawg33,2011-11-25T15:35Z,"its downloading relatively quickly. hopefuly it will work good on windows 7 home premium.
