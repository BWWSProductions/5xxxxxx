,doron_doritus,2010-11-29T05:05Z,"Ohhhhh this movie is so awesome.
As a kid I would ask my mom everytime she left the house on a weekend: ""MÈÅîe, aluga a torradeira valente pra mim? (Mom, would you rent the brave little toaster for me?)"".

I used to watch it over and over, and I JUST found out about the sequels, so I had to watch them. Thx so much xD"
