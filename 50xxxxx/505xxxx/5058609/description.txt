From last.fm:

"Brent Lee Regan (born 17th of May 1979 in Swindon, UK) is an alternative hip hop artist from the UK whose lyrical delivery and content is as varied as his musical style. 

Honest and inquisitive; cynical yet hopeful, Brent Lee Regans lyrics often unapologetically address the power struggles and paradigm shifts in the shady world of politics, religion and the human condition."

"Journeys In The Land of Midi, Free Samples and VSTis is a collection of material from 2001 - 2005 when Brent Lee Regan first was introduced to the world of computer music. 

Some of this material was co-produced by James Wooley of Foot & Mouth Productions, a hip hop group formed by Brent aka The Infidel and James aka cYn and also features tracks produced for cYns solo album: Intro-Deux-cYn and A.C. Adam Chalkley from Vendettas solo demo Hereditary Anarchy. This album only features two tracks with Brent on vocals, keeping his focus mainly on the production."
