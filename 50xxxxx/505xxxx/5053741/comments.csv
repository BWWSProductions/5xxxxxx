,greatsunrise,2009-08-15T02:11Z,"this is gonna make me sound like a chump but i never understood how the star wars saga should be watched. I am guessing you dont watch it based on the chronology of the numbers because star wars ep 4 was made in 1977 and ep 1 was made in 1999. Do you watch it based off the years? I have watched most of the new Stars wars, but I've always wanted to watch it from beginning to end in order to get the full story. Any star wars fans that can help me out? "

You're awesome."
,The_Reverend230,2010-10-17T21:33Z,If I convert this back to .avi will it be in HD? or at least really good?
,Blackout046,2011-05-19T18:41Z,No. You cannot convert SD to HD. It's like trying to put a 4 Gig movie on a 2 Gig Flash Drive; you cannot utilize something thats not even there.
