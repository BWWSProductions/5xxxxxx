S. Robert Hastings, Maria Wall, "Sustainable Solar Housing: Volume 1 - Strategies and Solutions"
Earthscan Publications Ltd. | 2009 | ISBN: 1844077993 | 320 pages | PDF 

Volume 1 of this two-volume set presents strategies and solutions for sustainable solar housing, offering the reader a solid platform for assessing environmental and economic concerns for housing projects, and offers guidance for implementing the most appropriate course of action in a variety of contexts. Topics include energy, economics, ecology and marketing.

The Sustainable Solar Housing set examines a range of potential solutions for low-energy building design, considering different strategies (energy conservation and renewable energy) and technologies (relating to the building envelope, ventilation, heat delivery, heat production, heat storage, electricity and control). Each volume assesses the potential of these options in a variety of contexts, covering different housing types (apartment, row and detached) and different climate types (cold, temperate and mild). The impressive list of expert authors from 14 countries includes a mix of internationally respected academics and practitioners, working under the auspices of a five-year International Energy Agency (IEA) research project.
