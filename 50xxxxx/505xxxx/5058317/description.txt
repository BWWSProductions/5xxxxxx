Even the least experienced user can easily remove junk files with this tool. Your hard disk is littered with junk files you don't need, taking up precious hard disk space, and potentially slowing down your PC's performance.

You'd be amazed at how much space these junk files take up.

You can choose to have the files permanently deleted, or else first moved to the Recycle Bin. And you can have the program do the cleanup automatically, or you can do it manually. You'll be amazed at how much hard disk space this program can gain for you, so automatically got back plenty of hard disk space. (For example: On my laptop, it found 872 MB of junk) The Professional Edition provides many advanced options. It lets you identify more junk files and old files. And for your safety, you can move these files to a designated folder, allowing you to restore them if needed.
