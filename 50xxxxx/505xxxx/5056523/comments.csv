,Hoblitygoodness,2011-10-11T01:31Z,Thanks. I've been complaining about school book history for years. I used to sort of nerd out and go to the library to elaborate on something I had just learned in history class back in high school only to find out it was all wrong! I can't believe I didn't already know about this book!
