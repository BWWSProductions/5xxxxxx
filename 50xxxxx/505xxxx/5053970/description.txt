[b][color=red]Game Description:[/color][/b]

[b][i]The single-player game is set approximately two years after the events of Mysteries of the Sith. As with the previous game in the series, the player controls the protagonist Kyle Katarn, a former Jedi who cut his link with The Force after almost succumbing to the Dark Side. At the start of the game he is a mercenary working for the New Republic.[6]

Kyle is joined by other characters throughout the game. Three of the most prominent are Jan Ors, a fellow mercenary and love interest; Lando Calrissian (voiced by Billy Dee Williams), the sophisticated baron-administrator of Cloud City seen in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi;[15] and Luke Skywalker, protagonist of the original film trilogy and leader of the Jedi Academy on Yavin IV. The player also receives help from Jedi and other New Republic soldiers.[16] Mon Mothma, Chief-of-State of the New Republic, gives Kyle and Jan objectives during the game.[17]
The primary antagonists of Jedi Outcast, Desann (right) and Tavion

There are four main antagonists: Desann, a former Jedi who killed a fellow student before leaving the Jedi Order;[18] Tavion, Desann's apprentice; Galak Fyyar, one of the leaders of the Imperial Remnant; and Reelo Baruk, a crime lord posing as a "respectable garbage collector" on Nar Shaddaa. They are supported by Imperial stormtroopers, numerous thugs and Dark Jedi.[19][/i][/b]
