,andy72184,2009-09-13T21:13Z,Whats different about motion 4 content 2?
,htd01,2009-09-17T09:18Z,"Guys, any programmer will tell you that they often have to break content files over multiple discs, and when one of those files gets split, there is some formatting that must be done to ensure it it properly reassembled.  When that formatting is erased or left out (like with toast images), the file is scanned and is called corrupted... ...unless you actually have the rest of the file ready to go!  Mount all content discs, and when the computer looks for the file it will find that one part actually searches for the other!  The OS will handle the linking of the file properly!  Just remember that you need a buttload of space to install, another buttload to download, and one more to actually do something with it.  I've seen this prob hundreds of times at the office, and PC crap is less sensitive, but it usually waits until you're neck deep in installation before it tells you something's wrong.  Mac runs a check at the front end to avoid that problem, enter new problem of proprietary formatting on a disc.  Good luck.  I'll DL, try and prove.  Then I'll holla back."

,MOVIEBOT,2009-09-24T17:38Z,"Hey KillerInstinctXOne, I Phoned the number that is listed under your domain registration details, another person answered as said to ship outside of USA it will cost $110 for Creative Suite 3, The whole reason for downloading this would be not to pay exuberant costs, I would rather download on my ISP's off-peak time than to pay $110 for Creative Suite 3!"

,KillerInstinctXOne,2009-09-30T07:01Z,MOVIEBOT - the reason it was quoted to you at $110 is because it costs $30 bucks alone to ship it to you since you are outside the united states. I ship express mail because its the cheapest way to get a tracking # that ships outside the USA with $100 dollar insurance in case of anything. Now for those in the USA its dirt cheap.

,123red1,2009-12-12T11:20Z,"svart.se:

It has to do with your connection, not how many seeders their are. I had 6 seeders and was still able to get  up to 700+kbs. Open all your ports if possible, then make sure your incoming port is between 6000 and 6500. Randomize your ports often if you're using uTorrent OS X version.

Also, depending on the time of day you're more likely to get more, or less seeders and faster or slower connection. Keep your upload at 100kbs and your download rate will fluctuate depending on time of day."

,aj944,2009-12-17T00:40Z,"Installed perfectly.

Once the programs are installed how do you installed the Motion Content.  They don't seem to mount."
,omnidecay,2009-12-18T00:15Z,"Ok, to everyone having issues with installing;

1. Locate folder of FCP 3
2. Select all .dmg files in the folder and select open. Verify windows open for all the .dmg files, I hit the ""skip"" button on all and went right to install. 
3. Follow the dialogue boxes and select your options. If you are upgrading to FCP the installer will automatically recognize this and upgrade. 
4. Enter serial that is provided in the FCP 3 folder.
5. The installer will run everything and FCP 3 will install. 
6. Whenever I am installing something like this I always mount (clicking open on a .dmg file automatically mounts the file) all of the .dmg files. This way whatever program you are installing will find all of the files automatically. 
7. Hope this helps and do not update unless you have a new serial. Mac disables serials with their updates.
8. Don't register. 
9. Someone please make a decent film so I wont want to kill myself every time Micheal Bay releases something. "

,mistermister1751,2009-12-31T00:39Z,"omnidecay said: "" Hope this helps and do not update unless you have a new serial. Mac disables serials with their updates.""

So what are we to do when we want an update? do we have to find an updated torrent and go through the download again?"
,m1ngaa,2009-12-31T17:38Z,"For those who's asking ""Why some get more speed""

Here's an answer. When you limit your Uploading Speed, your Downloading Speed gets low too. Say, you wanna Upload averaging 30kbs, then your download speed will be 50. But then when you give away Unlimited Uploading Speed, then you may get 300kbs on downloading. 

Please don't be funny saying you have more important stuff to do using your connection. Get your ass off MySpace and Facebook. Get a life. Specially when you have Mac, you don't really need to shut it down. So, maybe download when you're a sleep and quit the app when you're in need of checking your MySpace and stuff"

To anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about, do NOT download the update for FCP/ 'pro tools'/whatever apple updates calls it, because it is an anti-piracy measure. Delete the program and components from your computer, redownload the torrent files if you deleted it, and then reinstall. For me, I didn't even have to put the old serial in, it just kept my registration. I guess luckily the update was kept in one of the folders you delete when you uninstall. "

For those having issues download the final cut remover and run it. It will restart your computer. This will wipe all associated files from your computer from previously failed installs.

I will update if I can get the other programs to install separately. The only thing I needed was pro and color so we will see if it works."

,pookerella,2011-09-21T18:40Z,"Downloaded this torrent over a couple of days and when I initially opened it, some of the audio and motion content .dmgs wouldn't open. I was getting a message ""no mountable filesystems"" etc., but it was because Transmission didn't completely download all of the content, even though it said it was complete (don't know why). In past threads people were complaining that the DL was corrupt, etc., but I believe this was the issue they were having, because i was able to fix it.  I selected the torrent, in Transmission, clicked ""transfer"" in the menu bar and selected ""verify local data"" and it was able to find, download, and restore the missing parts of the .dmg files. That fixed the problem and I was able to mount all 7 .dmg files. 

I Used the the original serial number provided in the torrent and successfully installed the entire studio package on my brand new 17inch mac book pro thats running lion. If anyone wants to know, the laptop came with snow leopard installed, i then updated to lion, and then downloaded and installed this torrent-- i know there has been some talk about whether or not FCS3 would install on lion. it does.  

Also, the install comes with final cut 7.0 and  I have yet to update to final cut pro 7.0.3, so we will see what happens with the license ( I have gathered all of the serials mentioned in this thread and will give those a shot if there is an issue. hopefully there wont be, but that leads me to ask: Should I download and install little snitch before updating? should I even update at all?) 

Good luck to anyone else in the process of downloading and let me know if you have any questions. "
,pookerella,2011-09-21T18:56Z,"sorry I forgot to mention that I also installed the pro kit update thing too  before I installed anything with final cut. infact it may have been done before I even installed lion. Either way, I just wanted to mention that. "
