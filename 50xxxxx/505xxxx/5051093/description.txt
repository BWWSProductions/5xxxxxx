Hampton Hawes Quartet - All Night Session! CD 3 of 3
Orig Year:  1958

Quality: mp3 320 kbps

The amazing piano work of Hampton Hawes plus Jim Hallâ€™â€™s guitar magic in an extended and uninterrupted late-night session!  This 3 CD collection compiles the complete â€œAll Night Sessionâ€ which originally appeared on 3 LPs.

Recorded in just one night - from the late hours of November 12 to the early hours of November 13, 1956 - this session is more like a live date than a trip to the studios, with no repeated numbers and, consequently, no alternate takes.

While Hawes was most often heard in a trio format, this release showcases the pianist in a quartet.  A follower of Charlie Parker in both his music and lifestyle, Hawes waxed this recording nearly two years before being imprisoned for drug possession.  Although he was supposed to serve a five-year jail term, his sentence was revoked by President John F. Kennedy.  Hawes resumed his career after his release, playing and recording until suffering a fatal stroke in Los Angeles, on May 22, 1977.
