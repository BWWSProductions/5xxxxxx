MENACE FROM THE DEEP

The men are put in charge of the pierâ€™s machine gun post, but are soon left stranded when their boat slips away to sea, taking the telephone line down with it. Morse code doesnâ€™t bring a rescue tean â€“ only an angry warden Hodges and a lot more trouble!


BRANDED

Mainwaring refuses to accept Godfreyâ€™s resignation. After all his role as tea maker makes him integral to the platoon. But when the rest of the men find out he was a conscientious objector during WW1, Godfrey is immediately sent to Coventry. And even a slice of Cissyâ€™s upside down cake doesnâ€™t win them over.


MAN HUNT

Walker admits he found a downed parachute, but heâ€™s converted it into eight dozen pairs of ladies knickers. Determined to discover if the chute was German or British, Mainwaring bravely tries to get to the bottom of things â€“ in more ways than one.
