There's not much to say about this movie. Beside, most of you already know it.
I just want to tell you that absolutely you can not lose this release, cause it's amazing quality. For an R5 I'll give it an A 10 / V 10. 
I found it on Internet (not torrent#, downloaded and brought it here for you.
I dare to say it's the best release on Web, better even than Devise, Chupi etc.
Guys, it's a DVD Rip quality, I'm not lying, after all I never post FAKES.
So, I invite you all to download with trust.

No sample, just 8 snapshots to have a little preview for the quality. 
An .nfo file where you can read more details about the "VISION" release and...

SURPRISE, SURPRISE... 8 different subtitles : 

English, French, Spanish, Dutch, Brazilian-Portuguese, Danish, Turkish and Romanian (Terminator.4.Salvation.2009.R5.XviD.AC3-ViSiON.srt), 
 
[Now, who loves you more than I do ? (Joking)]. 

You know what I need in change of ? Many, many comments about quality and many, many thanks.
