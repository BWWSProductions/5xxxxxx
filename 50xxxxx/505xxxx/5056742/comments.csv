[T],cirip2006,2009-08-17T00:00Z,"PxSxWx, nothing personal, but everytime you watch a movie, do you clean your TV screen to eliminate any kind of dirt ? At cinema, if someone in front of you stands in a way that you can't see too well the screen, what you're doing ? You kick his a.s.s ? I don't think so.
It's true there was Russian subs and they had to blurred it out, but it's so insignificant that it didn't bothered me.
Until DVDRip, can say that this release it's more than anybody could ask for the moment."
,plinny1984,2009-08-17T11:50Z,"if it wasnt for the blurred out subs, this would be  perfect, but you get used to them after so long. overal sound and video is pertty much perfect. possibly one of the best, if not, the best copy of this floating around at the moment. many thanks cirip2006, great job!"
