,leeSally,2009-08-26T13:35Z,"Dear Sheila6: I am not a Mozard lover but I thank you for UL. Once ( 1998?) in Paris. I saw a recent (early 1990's?) re-recording of complete Bach's work by a french group. I remember reading an interview with the conductor of ths project.

Thanks to those made the recordings too."
