A software package that contains seven tools used to clean your registry

RegVac contains several tools that will clean your registry and fix any detected issues.

Why buy several programs to clean your registry when RegVac will do it all and more? Some of the tools in RegVac are not available anywhere else. The tools are listed below. RegVac has a Novice Mode which cleans the Registry with one button.

If you want to undo something, the Vac Bag allows you to restore all registry settings removed by RegVac. These Vac Bags may also be restored outside of RegVac. The RegVac can also delete Vac Bags that are over a week old.

Here are some key features of "RegVac Registry Cleaner":

Classes Vac:
* Similar to RegClean, Classes Vac cleans the Classes section of the registry.

Stash Vac:
* The registry is littered with history lists, recent lists, and tips. This tool removes 27 of the most common stashes and allows you to add the location of more stashes.

Software Vac:
* The largest part of the registry is the Software section. This tool searches through the Software section and finds keys that may be left over from long deleted files.

File Lists Vac:
* They abound all through the registry, references to files that no longer exist. This vac finds them and removes them.

Add/Remove Editor:
* This is actually the popular program, Add/Remove Pro. It checks your Add/Remove Programs list for programs that have already been deleted and allows you to uninstall programs, remove entries, and test entries.

System Configuration Utility:
* This is a neat little Windows utility otherwise known as msconfig.exe. RegVac will open it for you. One disadvantage of this utility is that it does not actually remove entries from the registry. It only disables them. RegVac will remove entries disabled by msconfig.
