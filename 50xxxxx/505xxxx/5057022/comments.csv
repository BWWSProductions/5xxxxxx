lol"
,Putz11,2009-08-17T04:21Z,1080p as in they work best with screens that are 16:9 1080p resolution
,tdatb,2009-08-17T06:50Z,"At last, someone posts wallpapers in the proper resolution/aspect ratio! 1920x1080 instead of the completely useless 1920x1200 shit most people post here as ""high-resolution widescreen wallpapers"". They may be both but since widescreen monitors are 16:9, 1920x1200 stuff DOESN'T FIT!

Thanks!"
,jotembi,2009-08-17T08:25Z,"that's right, they fit perfectly... and there are some gems among them, many thanks for the upload!"
,Putz11,2009-08-17T09:43Z,"Thanks, didn't know it would be this good!"
