,zhenyafan,2009-08-16T03:55Z,Actually hitler was a lefty socialist and was labled a right wing by the lefties. He was a socialist thru and thru. If you don't believe me look at his policies and you will find he would fit right in with the dummycrats.

,saxony2k,2010-06-25T23:31Z,"Wow - this book really brings the childishness out in people!

I wonder how old the age limit is when you go from bigoted to universally educated...? ;)

Personally, I've heard Adolf was a deep thinking - but that thinking was where his talents stayed.  It's good to read these things to understand how the minds of psychos work.  You're right though, this one's a bit... basic.  Saying that, a Jewish (Was he or was it his general who was Jewish?) brunette Austrian trying to create a perfect race out of brown haired christian Germans kind of demonstrates his thinking capacity!

Goatmaster - for future reference, I don't think you should be objective about American/world politics.  Americans aren't apparently great at taking criticism and revert to grasping at stereotypes...!"
,ElizabethBray,2012-01-26T23:30Z,"I wouldn't say Hitler was completely left-wing! He was a mix. Of course, he wasn't Nationalist (The German Workers Party DAP only became The German National Socialists Party NSDAP because he needed to win favour with Nationalist voters) well, not really anyway. However the notion that he wasn't really right wing I believe to be wrong, with someone so fascist who ran as a dictator, surely this is right wing? He was most definitely NOT a communist and in his 25 point policy of 1928, he clearly states that he loathes Communists. And Communists are left wing! I think many people mistakenly believe that Hitler was left wing because the political extremes (fascism and communism) can look very similar."
