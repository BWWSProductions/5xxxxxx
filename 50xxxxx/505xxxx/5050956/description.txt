Science of Cats
2008

More than 600 million claim residence in households across six continents ... and now they may have dethroned dogs as the most popular pet on earth. An exterminator, fierce hunter and favorite companion â€” aloof and affectionate at the same time â€” the cat leapt out of the wood and adopted us on its own terms thousands of years ago. But how did man and beast form their unconventional relationship? From mummified cats unearthed in Egypt to bizarre genetic mutations discovered around the globe, National Geographic presents the latest scientific evidence to reveal how cats and people set off on a journey along the same road.
