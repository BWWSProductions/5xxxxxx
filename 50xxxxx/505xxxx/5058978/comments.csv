,K_Ghost,2009-10-02T18:27Z,"I'm using powerISO to install the game, and I know that's not how you instructed to install, but the game installs and the key works fine. The problem comes after I copy the .exe and the .dat files into the game dir after I try to play the game I get an error message saying serious error occurred. 
Please let me know what I'm doing wrong. Do I actually have to burn it to a disk or what?"

,onlyseedgoodtorrents,2010-12-01T17:01Z,"I would like to thank DiviZero for this quality torrent.
I would also like to thank Sound-Bite for the serial code coz idk how to get it. Thanks ALOT dude!

For those of you who needs help: 
-open the bin file in the CD 1 folder with whatever you have. (I used PowerIso)
-Open the folder named 'crack'
-Replace that 'Generals Code' with the one given in the torrent.
-now, mount the torrent 
-Start the installation (you may need to use the setup exe thing)
-During installation, you will be prompt to type in the keygen.
-The keygen(thanks to Sound-Bite) is: 
1900-0448234-1633155-5025
-Halfway through installing, you will be prompt to insert the second CD thing.
-Simply mount the bin file in the second CD folder and your installation should resume.

Finally your game is installed BUT you still cannot play it. WHY you ask? Coz the 'No-CD Crack' is not given. Fortunately, I found the torrent containing it:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5236001/Command_and_Conquer_-_Generals_Hour_Zero_No_CD_crack_Key_gen

Remember to untick everything else 'cept the 'no-cd crack' folder.

FINALLY, replace BOTH the game.dat and the Generals with the ones provided.

Hope this helps ;)

,eEyePapa,2012-02-16T23:40Z,"Hello guys,

This isn't compatible with Win 7 x86?"
,eEyePapa,2012-02-17T12:10Z,"For those pirates who needs my help, just follow this instructions!

A.	Note: This torrent of DiviZero contains three folders.  The CD1, CD2, and Crack.
(1)	Open CCG1.bin file in CD1 of using any virtual drives.  In my case, I used MagicISO.
(2)	Go to the Crack Folder of CCG1.bin and then delete Generals_Code.exe file.  To do so, just right click the file and hit Delete.
(3)	Right click any files and hit Add Files.
(4)	Find the Generals_Code.exe file outside CD1.  It is located in Crack folder of this torrent.
(5)	Save the file by clicking File menu and then hit Save.

B.	Start with the installation.
(1)	Mount the edited CCG1.bin, I used MagicDisc, and execute by clicking AutoRun or the Setup inside the folder.
(2)	DONâ€™T USE THE KEYGEN posted in this forum.  Just generate another Keygen located at the torrent endorsed by onlyseedgoodtorrents, the one with the â€˜No-CD Crackâ€™.  Note: the keygen generator is located in Keygen folder.
(3)	When asked to insert the second CD, just mount the CCG2.bin file in CD2 of DiviZero.
(4)	Register using your name or you can pirate other names. ^_^



C.	Running the file.
(1)	Yes, the game wonâ€™t play because thereâ€™s no game.data and generals.exe in DiviZero crack.
(2)	This is why you must use another keygen via Keygen generator, so that the game.data and generals.exe file will be acknowledged by the program.
(3)	Just copy both files and paste in where you install the game.
(4)	There you go!  Just wait while loading and enjoy.

Special thanks to DiviZero and onlyseedgoodtorrents."
