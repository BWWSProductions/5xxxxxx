I wanted to upload this because it was just crazy how every single link for this turned up mainly in pal or a couple others were just plain dead & no one seemed to patch it for online play either. This is a great FPS game and the USA release needed to be shared properly in my opinion.

Compressed with WinRar, Game was tested and works.

Online notes: I haven't tested the game's online feature, but it should work as
              the Dnas Image was patched with the correct ID from the original
              disc with which this was ripped from. If it doesn't well...at least 
              you can still play the game.

You may or may not encounter some in-game cutscenes jitters, but as long as it doesn't freeze or anything you'll be fine and it doesn't effect main game play at all just make sure you save just in-case. It's really minor nothing to worry about game still runs fine. It could just be from me so I don't know.

If you don't have winrar you can use 7-zip to extract rar formats, 
7-zip is free google it.           

(You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

You will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with 

ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Tayio yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.
