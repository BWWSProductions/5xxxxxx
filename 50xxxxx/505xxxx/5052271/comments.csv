,kissarmy489,2009-08-18T06:28Z,Thank You So Much! Will Seed!!
,Kingspade805,2009-08-19T02:09Z,"thank you SO much for this! my favorite band.  i think ill be buying the CD soon too, but thanks for getting this out so quick.  i love this CD so much, THANK YOU!!!"
,thewindowisthedoor,2009-08-19T03:23Z,"No problem peeps. Yeah I pre-ordered the album, so I don't feel bad about listening early as I STILL haven't gotten it in the mail.  But if you do like this album, you should buy it.  Incredible band.  And if you haven't heard their older albums, step on it."
,megaquark,2009-08-20T18:53Z,"Yeah. I ""pre-ordered"" as well and don't know why Amazon is holding up. They show 5 ""in stock"" but a ship date of August 25? Makes no sense! 
For those who haven't paid for the album, I urge you to buy it if you like it. This is an ""organic"" band that doesn't have all the marketing from the label to promote sales. "
,megaquark,2009-08-20T19:04Z,So what's the deal on the seeds? I'm showing 0 availability
,megaquark,2009-08-20T19:13Z,Nevermind. some kind of IP blocking. Fixed it and now we're good. Downloaded already. Will seed to 200%. Thanks!
,megaquark,2009-08-20T19:31Z,"In case anyone wants to know, this torrent has the ""cleaner"" version of ""Don't believe a word"" where the ""you f****** Wh*** I'll Kill you"" is edited out to be some noise ending in ""kill you"""
