Unlike many other shows from this time that get uploaded this one nicely fills the screen. The idea for the series reportedly came from Bruce Lee who had planned to play Caine but Hollywood nicked his idea and stuck David Carradine in the lead role, or so the story goes. This has the pilot episode and a making of documentary. Thanks spotted jackal keep 'em comin'! :-)"
