"Strange" is the title of a song written by Wendell Mobley, Jason Sellers and Neil Thrasher. It was recorded by American country music artist Reba McEntire as her first release for the Valory label, a sister label of Big Machine Records. McEntire debuted the song on the Academy of Country Music awards the week before its release to country radio. It is the first single from her upcoming twenty-sixth studio album Keep On Loving You, set to be released on August 18, 2009.

A music video, directed by Trey Fanjoy, premiered on CMT on May 28, 2009. In the video, McEntire is shown in bed, surrounded by used tissues and chocolates while she talks on the phone. Later, she is shown looking through a rack of strapless black dresses. Throughout the video, scenes of her performing with her band and in front of a kaleidoscope background are included. This is also the first music video in which her road band appears.

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a favorable review, saying that McEntire sang the song strongly, and by doing so, sounded "renewed, refreshed and ready to conquer the charts once again." Billboard also gave the song a positive review, with ritic Deborah Evans Price saying McEntire delivers "the ultimate sassy anthem about a woman's resilience" and calling it a "delicious performance from one of country music's most gifted divas."

"Strange" was released to radio on April 6, 2009, one day after McEntire performed the song on the Academy of Country Music awards show. On the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated for April 25, 2009, the song debuted at #39, the highest chart debut of her career.
