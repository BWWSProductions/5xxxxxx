Thanks for this upload!

This movies' summary remembers me another movie: a bitter wealthy man unwillingly shares a hospital room with a poor guy, and they become best friends... Just can't remembert the title, but it's a VERY GOOD movie. Anyone that has seen this movie can tell its name?

Best regards to all!

,iShare4u,2009-08-17T04:59Z,"Your deliberate promotion of links to other movies that are TOTALLY unrelated to the movie on this page degrades the validity of The Pirate Bay's search engine.

See, when we search for a specific movie title that you included in one of your info links, (unrelated though it may be to the torrent itself) -- all your unrelated shit turns up when we search for that specific title.

So, no... I'm NOT pleased to see ""District 9"" in the search results when I was looking for ""Ice Age"".

You fucktard, STOP ADVERTISING YOUR TORRENTS!! If your vids are good, your reputation will be spread by ""word of mouth"". Let axxo be your guide.

People like you are turning Pirate Bay into a fucking spammy advertisement center for your other torrents."
