Westlife - Westlife [1999]

	


Westlife is the Irish boyband Westlife's debut studio album and was released on November 1, 1999 in the UK. The album was put out after releasing three singles, namely "Swear It Again", "If I Let You Go" and "Flying Without Wings", all of which were UK #1 singles. The album entered the UK chart at its number 2 peak, selling little over 83,000, 1,000 sales short of being number one, which was occupied by "Steptacular" by Steps. The album was the 8th best selling of 1999 in the UK.
Overseas, this was released on US in 2000 with different tracklisting and adding "My Private Movie" produced by Cutfather and Joe. It remains the only Westlife album to date to chart in the US, peaking at #129 on the Billboard 200. It also peaked at #15 in Australia.
More Than Words, an The Extreme original, has been a single released in Brazil and peaked at #2.
In December that same year, the double a-side single "I Have A Dream"/"Seasons In The Sun" became the Christmas #1 single of the year, and it remains as the most successful single of the band. In March 2000, the fifth and final single from the album, "Fool Again", was released and also debuted at #1.
With this, Westlife achieved five #1 singles from the same album in less than a year, a record that remains unbroken to date.
This said album was released into a boxed set with their album Turnaround on 25 January 2005. Nothing changes with the original tracklisting.
