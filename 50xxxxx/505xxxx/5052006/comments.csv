[V],only1joe,2009-08-16T23:46Z,"frackstarchick  - I have just clicked on where it says - Download This Torrent. When i do that it opens a memu box with 3 options - OPEN - SAVE - CANCEL -
I always click OPEN. It then opens in u-torrent for me.
So i am not getting any problems.
Anyone else having difficulties???
