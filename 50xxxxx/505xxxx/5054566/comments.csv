,Buc86,2011-01-12T14:23Z,How to install this game?
,koutsakis1,2011-02-18T03:36Z,VIRUS!!
,Levov,2011-02-25T22:26Z,"This is a virus free collection of mario fan made games. None of them are made by official developers. Some are pretty fun, and some are pretty stupid, and overall it is worth the download. My favorite game so far is Mario Moto. Thanks extremezone.

Also, I'm having a problem. When I try to launch some of the exe's, I get this:

The program can't start because CNCS232.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

Please and thank you for any assistance."
,eriklettenberg,2011-04-03T19:25Z,"@levov

just search on google how to download it, the n put that file in your game folder"
,Jinx7896,2011-07-29T23:56Z,"This is a trojan do not download!!!

Trojan.Gen.ML is a generic detection for many individual but varied Trojans for which specific definitions have not been created. A generic detection is used because it protects against many Trojans that share similar characteristics. "
,lupeenn,2011-08-18T00:48Z,"can't extract. shows this error 'no archives found'..
any idea??
i'm using winrar.."
,shrshgr8,2011-09-15T10:26Z,"Hey there are so many zip files and i dont have any winrar extracters new version......

@extremezone

you could have put all the games in a folder and zipped that folder"
,foxalot,2011-10-24T12:33Z,"viruses none detected with avast, busy downloading.....thanx EXTREMEZONE"

,zlo78,2012-01-29T10:49Z,thank you extremezone
,GaminPirate,2012-04-13T03:17Z,"@shrshgr8
or you could've just had a winrar extractor like every other responsible pirate that knows that you need: WinRar(or any other extractor for that matter) Daemon tools and a torrent downloader(and not whine about magnet links)
so maybe thats food for thought when commenting on another man's good job of uploading some material that we can have fun with, and not care about people that don't know how to be a proper pirate and don't have the basic software needed.
ps. excuse me when i sound agitated, i'm really not."
,GaminPirate,2012-04-13T03:18Z,"pps. how can people think EXTREMEZONE uploads viruses, thats like a monkey shitting chocolate"
,Zippergremlin,2012-04-24T21:08Z,"THIS IS NOT AN ISO! It is not a game disc of any sort!  The content and intallers that I've tried looked at so far are NOT English... but in fact French and other languages.  Deception in the title and vague description leads me to not trust this upload at all... This is simply a folder full of 45 independently zipped folders, each one containing a DIFFERENT variety of mystery game content.  Someone's collection of mixed and source unknown games, many needing different install/run activities in order to access the content or emulators to play properly.  How can this be called .ISO or imply that it's some type of plug and play game disc? Or being English content?  it's none!  I downloaded this in the thoughts it was an .ISO and could be used by my child.  I regret seeding..."
,demis1159,2012-06-25T19:52Z,Thankssssssssssssssssssssss
,01Ryan,2012-07-16T07:33Z,plz seed
