If you're into Bergman, as you posted ""The film music of Ingmar Bergman"", you shouldn't miss this:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5054461/SPARKS_-_Seduction_of_Ingemar_Bergman_2009

It's i a musical about Bergman, written by The Sparks for Swedish National Radio. It was broadcasted for the first time on the 14 of August, 2009.

It is justa as bizarre as it is wonderful."

Anyone have any idea if the movie's available somewhere?

Thanks for this.
