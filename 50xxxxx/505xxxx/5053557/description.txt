This is one of my favorite TV-series
The surround sound is worth mentionig
The quality is nice - both audio and video - It looked nice in my 720p LCD.
I played this in a Intel Pentium pocessor powered system with 256mb ram with klitemegacodecpack and coreavc
It played smoothly with out any problems. But i had some difficulties playing with vlc {vlc sucks with h264}
This is really compressed version you can find for this series anywhere.
This is a LEGENDARY SERIES for both exceptional video and exceptional surround sounds.

This includes both 3rd&4th episodes. I will upload the remaining episodes regularly. So be patient. This will be one of my best uploads. There are so many dvdrips floating around. Mine is definitely better than those due to source being bdrip. The audio is in 5.1 so that everyone can enjoy this show in the way it is meant to be. My bandwidth is very limited so i cant upload every episode continuously. I will upload the remaining episodes with one or two days gap. Even if there is any delay just bare with me. You will get all the episodes for sure. And remember - "there are no bad apples here".
