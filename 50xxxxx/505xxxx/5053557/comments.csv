,MGhannu,2009-08-29T17:56Z,How i can separate them? Do i need some video editor?
,kevukenn,2009-09-01T18:51Z,"Mghannu. You dont need any video editors to turnoff the subs. What ever the video player you are using, if it can display the subs, it can also turnoff the subs. The subs are provided as separate files. So they are not integrated in to the video file or hardsubbed. If you are unable to figure how to shut the subs, then just move the subfile to another location. i.e if both the videofile and subfile are not in the same folder, then the subs cant be displayed"
