THE STORY: 
Hope is lost. Literallyâ€”lost in time, with Cable stranded in the future, unable to travel back to save her. For the first time in Hopeâ€™s short life, the so-called â€œmutant messiahâ€ has to fend for herself... and now she's hiding out in a futuristic city born of the ashes of Cableâ€™s greatest enemy, Stryfe.
