,fivalo,2009-09-26T11:43Z,"super thanks!

works absolutly perfect, instructions are simple, NOT A VIRUS, for any clowns who still think false positive keygens are bad...maybe you should just BUY the programs instead, maybe like you BOUGHT your antivirus software (right?)

but all seriousness, thank you.

,Agon024,2009-11-15T22:47Z,"Doesn't work for me. Still pops up with activation windows saying "" Welcome! Please supply the information below to activate your copy of ObjectDock Plus"" Then it has a field for ""email"" and ""product serial number""

Tried to re-apply the patch and it says that it is already patched. Tried to paste the serial in manually but it didn't take either.

Probably cause I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit"
,SCFuZion,2009-11-25T07:51Z,"Yeah, I couldn't get it to ""drop"" in Win 7 Ult. x64 either.  Through VMWare workstation and Remote Desktop Client in Vista Ult. x64 it worked like a charm!  Then I put it in a Public share file and sent it trough to the Win 7 Ult. x64 >>> Cut it out>>> Pasted it in Prog. Files >>> It Works!  (merely a suggestion) !!!Thanks UL!!!  First EMBRACE Keygen for this I have found NOT to be a total flop!"

[V],bobo66,2010-01-16T12:48Z,"Ran Keygen sandboxed, app didn't go or do what it shouldn't and worked.

Keygen does generate many hits, but based upon the returns and the sandbox result, they are false and typical returns for a keygen and patcher.

,pritamassrani,2010-02-08T10:45Z,Sorry but the system tray feature does not work.Also if you want to uninstall it run unwise.exe located in the OD installation directory.Doing it from Control Panel will not work.Waiting for a better release.
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-12T19:49Z,This is a perfect torrent. Works exactly as expected.
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-12T19:50Z,The System Tray in the dock doesn't work for x64 OS'es. In my case Windows 7 Ultimate x64. They say will provide that in a future release of this program.

,unusednic,2010-05-02T21:47Z,"NO trojan or any virus found. I'm using the latest Avast 5 Free. Maybe it's your antivirus's definiton messed up.

All features except system tray's icons work perfectly. I'm running XP SP3 32-bit, and system tray does not work. I read an article that only the illegal copy experiences this error"

any ideas??"
,todydejaca,2010-05-23T20:03Z,"@Faitu, if you have an Anti-Virus, this can be the cause of your problem. Most of anti-virus, have an idle scanner, when you open or save a file, it scans it. On AVG it happens some times with me :D

On AVG, it's caled Resident Protection

Hoper i helped u ; Todydejaca"

,xxcherryliciousxx,2010-06-18T14:21Z,i don't know what 'reliable' sources you guys had but i scanned the archive on virustotal.com and found 27 threats.
,RoninWolfsBlood,2010-06-20T01:48Z,"Yeah thx for torrent haveing a bit of a prob with the x64bit but will work around it. Btw the peeps that have a prob with the crack probably have a resident shield with their Avg Internet security or something similar and that is what stops most patches and cracks from working. Good tip add a folder to the while list and put them in there and run it should do the trick.

Keep up the good work and share."
,munky261,2010-07-06T23:45Z,"Thanks for the up, this program is the shit! Running it on 7 Ultimate 32 bit with no issues. Any chance of getting the Pro version of Fences from stardock?"

,empah,2010-08-06T16:40Z,"I had to disable !Ad-watch live"" to make ""Keygen"" to work - otherwise it was just fine! Thanks!"
,WhiteMaverick,2010-08-09T06:49Z,"So I tried doing everything you guys have said in the comments but still not working. 

I'm using Vista 32 bit

I would love to use this but unless someone else can help me figure it out sucks to be me."
,sphiryx,2010-09-02T14:07Z,"For those ""epxerts"" here saying the Keygen will always be deteckted as a virus: Ever heard of a rootkit you fools? There are many ways to hide a process using special kits so no scanner would ever detect any malware installed on your machine. OK, some keygens are packed using specials compression techniques but they'll show up as heuristic packer or something like that but definately NOT AS TROJANS!!! Once you have launched the keygen they'll download more components from the net. Even if the actual keygen might not contain any code which can be used to take over your machine, the downloaded code and sofware CAN. Every thougth about how those script kiddies build up their bot-farm?"
,bluesweetsoul,2010-09-11T15:11Z,For those using Win7 64bit -> run the patch as administrator. Worked for me.
,bokkafa,2010-09-28T19:24Z,"When i run the crack nothing happens.It deosnt even show up.I can see it on the processes.

Anone got any idea ?"
