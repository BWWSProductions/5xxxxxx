One thing he did better than you is in the file name to state which tracks are the new entries this week, saves time having to double check with the Radio 1 chart each time I download it from you. If you could put (new) at the end of new entries that would be great, many thanks!"

[V],oldskoolscouse,2009-08-21T23:37Z,"@ Rated-R-Superstar , I will not be adding (new) to the end of tracks, I dont see the point in having anything other than the filename, and it will only be deleted upon download. 

however, I will start to put it in the description, hope this helps you out."
,Rated-R-Superstar,2009-08-31T04:05Z,"Saying the new tracks in the description is just as good for me, thanks.

Hunnicuddler, it takes what, 2 seconds to remove the (new) from the file, especially if you use iD3 Tag-It, brilliant problem, takes mere seconds to rename files from Tag information, just the way you want it. Since the (new) is in the file name and not the tag, a simple button click removes (new) from every file name."
