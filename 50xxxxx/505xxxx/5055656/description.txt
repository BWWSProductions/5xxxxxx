Here We Go Again is the title track and first single from singer Demi Lovato's second studio album. The song was released to Radio Disney on June 17, 2009 and as a digital download on June 23, 2009. It has peaked at #61 on the Canadian Hot 100 and #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States making it her most successful charting solo effort.

The music video (directed by The Malloys) was filmed on June 8, 2009, and premiered on June 26, and through her official sites fans were told they could participate in the making of the video. The video starts with Lovato in her dressing room talking to her boyfriend on the phone. It is assumed that the boyfriend has ended the relationship as she rips up a picture of him. However a few minutes later he calls back but Lovato ignores the phone and heads to the stage where she performs. Her boyfriend is shown visiting the concert, and after Lovato is finished the performance she heads back to her dressing room, where he meets her with a rose, thus beginning their relationship again, staying true to the theme of the song.

On July 3, 2009, the song debuted at number fifty-one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and number eighty-six on the Canadian Hot 100, eventually peaking at number sixty-one. For the Billboard issue date of August 1, 2009, the song reached number 15 on the Hot 100, becoming Lovato's first top 20 hit as a solo artist. Her duet with Joe Jonas, "This Is Me", peaked at number nine. After her song Don't Forget from her previous album, Demi Lovato had scored again with her latest single Here We Go Again which is now charting in the music channels particularly in the Philippines
