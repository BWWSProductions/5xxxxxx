,ez4u2sa67,2009-08-17T03:35Z,"it works, just load onto a thumb drive or something and launch it. Now if only more of my friends used mac."
,ratm4life,2009-08-17T04:11Z,Thanks so much ive been looking all over for this 
,itisme1,2009-08-17T06:41Z,"I'm going to stop seeding this, I ran over my bandwidth limit."
,chrisssssssss,2009-08-17T11:54Z,tried it... it's kinda cool... works like it says. I don't think that it has done any real harm. Read up on it. It's a cool little accelerometer based prank to play on a macbook... neat.
,shredtheibanez,2009-08-18T02:53Z,"PPC G5 Leopard.

Doesn't seem to work? any ideas...
Is this exclusive to macbooks and macbook pros? "
,janbananp,2009-08-18T16:27Z,this app works for every intel mac with tiger or leopard
,killerzip,2009-08-20T00:53Z,It relies on the hard drive motion sensors in macbooks and powerbooks.
,itisme1,2009-08-22T08:05Z,Actually it relies on the accelerometer that every Macbook / Macbook Pro has.
,acerferrari,2009-08-22T16:10Z,I just tried on my MBP intel and it works realy nice :-)

,anon197,2011-03-14T21:26Z,"OK, I know that this is a bit of an old torrent, but if we could have some new seeders I would be very grateful. I will download and seed - since it is such a cool app."
,Chocobopet,2011-04-04T12:26Z,My Entire High School has Mac and an open network. :D i could set this to run itself and watch as the teachers freak out.
,drumrobot,2011-05-07T01:49Z,"Only seems to work on OS X 10.4/Tiger (haven't tested earlier versions, though, so you're welcome to try); 10.5 and 10.6 did not work for me.
I don't want to re-download it and seed it (I downloaded/seeded/deleted it months ago), so I'll just throw up a compressed version here:

Thanks to the uploader for the great torrent, though... that's where the file above is coming from."
