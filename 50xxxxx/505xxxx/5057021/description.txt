This is a prank application called the Newton Virus.  Load it up on a USB key, and execute it on your friend's Mac when they are away.  When the come back, 30 seconds later after mouse detection is found, their whole desktop will fall and break and everything will go crazy for 1 - 2 minutes before it resets itself.
