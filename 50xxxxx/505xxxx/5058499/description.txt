Googoosh in Persian Ú¯ÙˆÚ¯ÙˆØ´ defined as Swanhawk (alternately spelled Gogosh, Googosh or Gougoush; Persian: , born Faegheh Atashin, Persian: ÙØ§Ø¦Ù‚Ù‡ Ø¢ØªØ´ÛŒÙ† , born May 5, 1950 in Tehran) is an Iranian pop singer and actress.

In the 1970s, Googoosh was considered the most celebrated recording artist in Iran. In addition to music, Googoosh was also an actress in many Persian films of the 1960s and 1970s. She is more widely known as a singer than as an actress. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979 she remained in Iran until 2000 but did not record or perform again due to the ban on solo female singers. Still, her following grew. Younger people have rediscovered her music via bootleg recordings. Outside of Iran, she has a significant following in many Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, and currently resides in Los Angeles, California and continues her career, albeit in a limited manner.
