,itix,2009-12-14T11:15Z,"If someone with a high seed capacity could stay on the torrent for a while, it wouldn't be so damn irregular.

I have a seed capacity of about 1 Mb/s and I will stay until at least a ratio of 10.. the data is on my 1TB external drive so I can't always seed unfortunately :("
