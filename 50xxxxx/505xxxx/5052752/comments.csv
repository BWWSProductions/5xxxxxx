,Vaz306,2009-10-31T14:32Z,"Hi guys. I have just finish testing it. First of all no viruses :) 
Installation is ok with keygen working just fine.
The only problem I have faced so far is that when I click on ""acess rights"" to make a few changes on the users the system shuts down without any warning. I have tried it many time and it won't work. Everything else is just fine. I will make a new post when I have something new.
Thanks a lot to the uploader. "
,Vaz306,2009-10-31T14:34Z,"Hi jsanderson045.
I did not have the problem you are saying.
Why don't you try uninstalling and reinstalling it again. "
,Vaz306,2009-10-31T14:36Z,"Hi jsanderson045
Why don't you try uninstalling it and the reinstall it."
,blobface,2010-01-26T22:59Z,"Thanks for the upload

I have installed this but for some reason when I load it up it says 'Sage Instant Accounts' on the top bar and not 'Sage 50 Accounts' is it supposed to do this or have I installed it wrong?"
,Hrock,2010-03-04T08:05Z,"Thank you, works great. No virus or suspicious files as far as i can tell."
,jwylie27,2010-03-13T03:46Z,Thanks for a great upload Blacktroy. Works like a charm!!
,cailin43,2010-03-25T10:05Z,"Help i cant get logged on to main Sage, only letting me into demo and practice with Manager? "
,Melonite,2010-04-19T17:53Z,"It is a Pre-Release demo version, and expires after several uses. The registration key will actually default to ""REVIEWER"" and you can't get back in to the program once it is expired. 

Quite good program, but pretty usless torrent."
,mws257,2010-06-16T01:34Z,"This is a PRE - RELEASE!

Doesn't work!"
,fpisti35,2010-09-30T22:25Z,"The login firs time ""Manager"" without password. Read help! After you can create any account :-)

It's works perfect. Thanks a lot."
,rcfc87,2010-11-06T11:27Z,Does this have a serial/keygen Blacktroy?
,MICR0S0FT,2011-01-28T04:25Z,"Clean! Kaspersky gave a ""false positive"" for the file
CRYPKEYS.EXE (it is used in many 'trial' progs).
Just allow this file, it will not affect installation.

I have not experienced this program being
un-responsive after multiple uses.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALL:

[1] Disconnect internet connection (not required
probably, but I do it for all torrents).

[2] HIGHLIGHT all files in the .rar. Click EXTRACT
TO > Click on DESKTOP > Press OK

[3] Now, open that folder on DESKTOP > Double
click the file ""SETUP.EXE"" Let it install.

[4] Pick NEW COMPANY (Fill in at least Company name).

[5] Pick whatever you think is right for the rest.
(You CAN change it later in the menus).

[6] When you get to ACTIVATION. Open the
folder named ""keygen + serial"" > ""special_serial"" > Pick ANY ONE of them for first
activation. (We'll be changing it later for the upgrade).

[7] Uncheck the box for ""RSS FEEDS"".

[8] When you get the LOGON SCREEN, the
username is: manager password is: has not
been set (just click on the OK button).

[9] Let us change the password first (or skip to
next step). Click on SETTINGS > CHANGE
PASSWORD. Enter new password 2 times.
NOTE: ACCESS RIGHTS does not crash prog.

[10] Let's UPGRADE the prog before actually
using it. Open the text file: ""special_serials"",
Use a DIFFERENT ""serial and key"" this time.
Click TOOLS > ACTIVATION > UPGRADE PROGRAM. Use the different serial and key.
Click OK button. (You will get an alert saying
close all windows before doing this.. click YES).
It will say to RESTART PROG, click OK/YES.
Open prog up again. We are not done yet.

[11] Turn internet back on. Time to UPDATE!!
(Yes, it works to update online). I have NOT
blocked this program in my firewall, as I don't
see the need to since it updates. I have updates
set to download but ask me if I want to install them.

[12] Click HELP > CHECK FOR UPDATES.
Follow the steps and click YES until you get the
update finished."
,dimon1980,2011-02-05T00:39Z,"great torrent, works perfectly.  does anyone know where to download ACT! Link for Sage 50 Accounts"
,whatever1941,2011-04-12T18:57Z,"Great download, after following the instructions by Microsoft the program worked perfectly. However after several uses the program has now stopped working, with the message ""Thanks for taking part in our pre-release test site program"".
It took me hours to enter all of my data and set up the program the way I wanted it, what a waste of time.
Last time I download anything from BLACKTROY, you fucking waster."
,antsmith7548,2011-04-29T14:13Z,"Complete waste of time for me also, all worked fine for 2 weeks then it said ""Thanx for using trial which expires in 10 days. totally fucked up my accounts as you cant back the data to the old version. DONT BOTHER WITH THIS CRAP."
,Salimbo,2011-06-02T22:11Z,AVG Anit Virus found a threat! Is that a false positive?
,G3rbik,2011-06-11T16:28Z,"Yes it will come up with the prebeta after a while, but just uninstall, copy your ACCDATA, delete your program files of sage and program data, reinstall and it'll work fine"
,minskin,2011-07-15T18:58Z,"So once the pre-release time's up and I've reinstalled, it won't need reinstalling every 2 weeks will it?"
,tylsiege,2011-09-07T11:12Z,Looks like a TRIAL
,Vaz306,2011-09-21T15:58Z,Hello guys. I get the same message that this is a pre-release test version. Has anyone solved this problem? I am stuck here. I cannot go back to 2009.
,Billy_Bob_2011,2012-01-06T16:48Z,"Still comes up with ""Thanks for taking part in our pre-release test site program"" after reinstall."
,laned130,2012-03-20T17:09Z,Any ideas BlackTroy?
