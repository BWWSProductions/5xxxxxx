,troy69,2009-08-14T16:09Z,Itis build 10A432 (Golden Master if the rumours are true)
,mc218,2009-08-14T17:02Z,I'd wait with it a bit: http://i725.photobucket.com/albums/ww260/BenedictMac/slnew.jpg
,jb510,2009-08-14T19:31Z,"Could we get an accurate description of this file please?

What build?  Ccomments say 10A423, but really should be up top and in the title.  

If it's 10a423 it is rumored to be GM/final, but I seriously doubt those rumors.

Is this the Install DVD Image, or image of an installation upgrade to 10a423? Why is it RAR'd?

At least it's a fast seed, I guess I'll answer all my own questions soon enough."

,imrabti,2009-08-16T15:45Z,@zuozas So I'm sure that this retail DVD Does have the 10A432 build.
,imrabti,2009-08-16T16:00Z,"IT""S NOT GM! 
From the MacRumors forums: ""I work for Apple in London & i can confirm that build 10a432 is not the Golden Master it has just been given to select devs to test a few expert issues. 10A433 is on it's way (for server at least) and with uncomplete features like no prefs for quicktime and no default 64-bit for capable machines (i mean that not even the extensions are 64-bit by default). The installation has been polished and is being tested by the chosen devs. As i have heard there will be 1 or 2 more builds before it gets to golden master. There is still a bit of testing going on with the new bootcamp drivers but other than that it's basically there. i hope this corrects a few things, i'm not sure how pretty much the entire internet has got this wrong but none the less mistakes happen."" 

It's not so important whether he speaks the truth, but one thing is fact: Quicktime has no preferences.. so.. not a GM.."
,ElCofresi,2009-08-16T17:03Z,"Whats the big ""blip"" deal with the GOLDEN MONKEY"" dudes. It works and that's it. OSX systems are ALWAYS being upgraded. Just wait after the release date and you will see upgrades almost monthly. Then you can have your GOLDEN CHIMP or GOLDEN GORILLA upgrade. The point is this .DMG got the complete and functional Snow Leopard 10.6, your Mac WILL RUN a lot faster, snappier Finder, etc, etc, with all the goodies you can read about here : http://www.apple.com/macosx/refinements/"

When you install this build, do you loose ur applications, settings and data?"
,ElCofresi,2009-08-18T04:13Z,"Nope, just like installing a normal system upgrade. I just notice that apps that i had eliminated from my app folder but kept the icon on the dock, where replaced on the dock with the ""?"" sign after installing OS X 10.6, which was correct because I already discarded the program it was supposed to open. So other than that everything is OK."
,acerferrari,2009-08-18T19:18Z,"I just uninstalled  because i think that was some bugs, it was not yet ready. The trash was sooo slowly and filcopi too. And i have the 2008 MB pro. But when u installed it keep everything you have before so it is very nice. I gone wait until it comes witout bugs."

No, your parents are rich. How do I know? Becuase we don't give money to retards--unless they can rap or play sports. You know how else I know? Becuase you're the idiot who thinks they are the only people in the world with an above-average amount of disposable income. 

It's also a time-killer / project to build a computer that could outrun your overpriced shitbox for half the price you paid (for your own records, read: difference between thousands and hundreds).

You, on the other hand, like to spew shit over the internet. Other hobbies and interests including jerking off the mailman until he shoots level 10 blinding semen at you, and watching your mother in the shower. 

If you're of any age above 13, you should re-think your entire life and revisit a place of education. 
My alternative (and recommended) solution is to just hang yourself, because you're a waste. "
,natogandalf,2009-09-03T00:48Z,"Retards, the reason you pay more for a Mac is the same reason you pay more for a Ferrari instead of buying a crappy Corvette made of plastic for a fifth of the price.

I know you PC-whores don't care anything for build quality and stuff like that so go ahead and build your own ""Mac"" from cheap bits and parts, and go ahead and post it on here over and over like a immature 13-yearold. Why should I give a fuck? I have a MacBook and I know for sure that it's a better computer than your pile of crap.

Why would you think anyone would get jealous of you? Anyone can build a PC running OS X if they want, it's just that some people like to pay more for quality and you're obviously not one of them. Go bug someone in a Prada shirt and tell them you got yours at Wall-mart for $10, I'm sure they care just as much as we do."
,theredux,2009-09-03T01:21Z,"@natogandalf 
It has nothing to do with parts. I'm buying top of the line shit here, 8core processors, high quality ram, hd, etc...the only thing apple has on PC's is software (winblows vs osx). The failure rate of parts will be all the same...I don't know what planet you're from if you think Apple makes all their own components?

Look man, I know where you're coming from. Naturally you're going to defend your position. You spent a lot of money on an overpriced computer, and you like it. Cool. Nobody can take that away from you.  You have every right to be upset. Chillax, smoke a bowl and enjoy your computer--whichever brand it may be. "

,mlcgruhlke,2009-09-05T00:07Z,"For all those Mac users who think they have better hardware than custom PC's, you're smoking or sniffing something illegal.  What to out distance my rig?  I didn't have to spend $$$ just to buy a good OS and so-so hardware.  It's ALWAYS been about the OS so get over it - you are paying way too much money for hardware and I'm sure that Jobs laughs all the way to the bank.  How about an Intel Core duo E7600 3.06 ghz processor with 4 Gig of Crucial 1066 DDR2 memory, along with one nVidia 9500GT with 1Gig of video ram, a WD 160 gig Sata2 hard drive?  Graphics???  My machine will toast most Mac's and I'm sure that there are custom builders here that are probably running the Intel Q9650 or one of the hot new Intel i7 processors.  Don't believe for a second that us custom PC builders don't believe in state of the art hardware, we LOVE it, and we LIVE it.  Go PC's!  "
,mlcgruhlke,2009-09-05T00:39Z,I forgot to mention that I am triple booting:  Windows 7 RC1 and XP-64 Bit on one hard drive with two partitions and Mac OSx86 10.5.8 on the other hard drive - using Easy BCD 2.0 Beta to help decide which OS to use.

,LoKi6922,2009-09-06T04:00Z,"I love all the Mac haters on the web. Sure the hardware is expensive, but as an IT guy who has spent 11 years designing and *mostly* repairing Windows networks and systems, I use a Mac at home. Why? Because most of the time spent using a Windows based computer is spent trying to make it do what you want. DLL's, registry problems, viruses and spyware, hardware made by any vendor and the coders have no access to the inner workings of M$ software to actually make it 'work'. 

The Mac is effortless. When I want to USE a computer and actually do something, not spend 3 days figuring out how, I go to my Macs. I don't care how good you think your hardware is, if you are limited to M$ for your software options *thanks to the government for allowing the monopoly all these years*, you'd be better off with ANY flavor of Linux and actually learning how a computer works. 

The only reason for mega bloated hardware is to play games anyway, and if you have that kind of time on your hands, you should just spend the cash on an Xbox or PS3. 

AiTB, thanks for the Up. I'll probably buy this anyway. It costs 1/16th of what 7 will cost."
,stopimalreadydead,2009-09-06T04:10Z,Everyone that thinks Macs are too expensive (including myself) should go to www.psystar.com for a PC-component built Hackintosh basically. Much cheaper and upgradable than a Mac.
,aoe3warchiefs,2009-09-09T01:11Z,"Hi guys.

Thanks for the download. I made a Xbench benchmark on my system before upgrading from 10.5.8 to 10.6.1 using this torrent and the easiest install ever. 
My score went from 64.54 to 84.54. A raise of 30% fucking nuts. I might buy this OSX legally, just because I now know it fucking rocks."

,BLkB0MBER,2009-09-11T21:46Z,"@ you fucking pc lovers
if you had both brands, mac and windows, like i do im sure would completely agree that pc's have way more customizable options hardware wise ... but thats not the point. 

you are customizing a shitty insecure unstable operating system. 

windows crashing, system errors, and viruses got really fucking annoying over the years.

i thought mac was expensive and hard 2 use until i tried it... it was expensive but worth it. way easier 2 use... 

of course finding programs for mac is the only problem... like modding xbox 360 harddrives.

but that is what boot camp or parallels is for."
