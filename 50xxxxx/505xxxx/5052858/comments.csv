,pompomboy,2010-03-19T15:56Z,One of the best compilation ever - Thanks
,casperboo,2010-05-17T00:23Z,"I appreciate your effort, but you are obviously a windows user... this is NOT the Time Life collection... you just went around and gathered up the same songs that are in the collection, which would have been fine if you weren't too damn lazy to actually edit the the mp3 metadata to match the Time Life collection... the metadata of these mp3's is all over the place... some mp3s have all the metadata info in the title field, some have absolutely nothing, others have the original album you apparently ripped them from.  Unacceptable.  If you submit compilation you need to do the extra work otherwise you might as well call this the ""Ultimate 70's Cluster F*** album"""
,needitbadly6972,2010-05-28T09:37Z,"Casperboo, I have only one thing to say, STOP YOUR BITCHING! You're getting all the same songs that are in the CD collection for FREE! Why does it matter to you, or anybody else for that matter, what the actual sources of the songs is? It would probably take you weeks if not months to find all of them one at a time on your own! So instead of bitching, do the right thing and thank whoever was kind enough to upload this file for giving this to you and the rest of us for free! From a quick click on your profile, I see that you have NEVER uploaded anything yourself for the rest of us, oh so typical. Bitch as loudly as you possibly can when all you are is a two bit LEECHER! "
,jdabbs5,2010-09-18T21:09Z,"No shit needitbadly6972, gonna have to agree with you on that one.  I'm more of a leecher than a seeder, but I'll never talk shit to someone who uploaded something I want...for free.  Casperboo, I got a big ""southern sausage"" waiting for you if you want it."
