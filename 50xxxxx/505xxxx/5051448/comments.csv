,Fox_Almighty,2009-08-13T19:21Z,ok... damn... I don't have BluRay. Can someone please make a normal dvdrip? I can't find it anywhere (I even looked at the 2 other competitor torrent sites (starts with D. and M.).
[T],budakrist,2009-08-13T19:24Z,"This is an AVI file, it is XviD. It will play just like a normal xvid dvdrip. The resolution is 624x336 its not HD itself but its ripped from an HD source (bluray disc)."

,kewiin,2009-08-14T22:24Z,Omg need 2 see!
,signalcorps,2009-08-15T15:58Z,"@blackpyro, @xHeliosx

Actually, at 624x336 resolution output to a very small 700mb file, quality isn't gonna be any different than a DVDrip, even though source is BlueRay."
