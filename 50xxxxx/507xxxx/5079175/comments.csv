[V],polifem2009,2009-09-05T12:10Z,"@lofasak: of course it is possible to expect the ones you have mentioned. but you could also expect some itami juzo, aoyama shinji, kore-eda hirokazu, ishii (teruo or sogo), or who knows, some shimizu hiroshi, fukasaku kinji, kawase naomi, shindo kaneto, teshigahara hiroshi, obayashi nobuhiko or, who knows, none of the above. wouldn't you say there is a lot to chose from?"

Maybe some straws or dices could solve this problem... But since the possibilities are almost infinite (?) perhaps a Tarot deck would be more appropriate..."
