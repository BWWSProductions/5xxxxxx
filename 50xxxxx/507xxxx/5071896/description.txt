As an internationally respected artist/producer/remixer/DJ, DAVID GUETTA's track record has been impeccable for nearly two decades. Now, in mid-2009, his career is reaching new peaks: 'When Love Takes Over' featuring the lead vocal of multi-platinum Pop/R&B songstress Kelly Rowland, is taking off as a world-wide smash, hitting #1 spot here in the U.K singles chart.

Significantly, it was Guetta's own defining and assured musical viewpoint as a DJ and producer that attracted the A-listers who make ONE LOVE one of 2009's most diverse and star-studded album projects. Kelly Rowland, for example, moved to tears at first hearing the instrumental work-in-progress that became 'When Love Takes Over' on the dance floor at Guetta's famed F*** Me I'm Famous party in Cannes, greeted him in the DJ booth, and was later given the track to write to. 

Will.I.Am, similarly, had first approached Guetta to contribute to a club-inspired album planned by Black Eyed Peas (the just-released Energy Never Dies) - and their collaboration snowballed to include two tracks on ONE LOVE: the out-of-control 'I Wanna Go Crazy,' and 'On the Dancefloor,' joined by apl.de.ap, a fresh evocation of the hip-hop/house fusions of the late 1980s.
