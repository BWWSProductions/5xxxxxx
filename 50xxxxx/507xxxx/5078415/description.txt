Review:

The 75-minute film is a rich tapestry of sacred sex symbolism from around the world. The narrative weaves various traditions into its account, including the Kabbala, Western Europeans alchemy symbols, Tantra, Mayan carvings, Tibetan Buddhism, and various Christian gospels. It is inspiring to see the parallels between these traditions, even if they have been interpreted radically differently over the years. --reuniting.info

Mission Statement: 

Let us Embrace The Razors Edge, for the begining of Wisdom is Knowing how little We Know, Ergo, there are many paths too Knowledge, but only one path that leads to Truth.

For The Matrix (The World) is a System (Our Enslavement)... As The Christ stated, If your Eye be Single (In Meditation), your body shall be filled with Light (One with Christ)... So get Unpluged (Be in the World not of It), for the Kingdom (Salvation) of God is Within You! (The Key to true Knowledge and Eturnal Life).... 

Understand, that We are the Ones we`ve been Waiting for too Save Us... With that Understanding, Let the Awakening begin
