,Ted_Sheckler,2009-09-04T18:12Z,Thanks MG as always. Sad to hear you're retiring. Hope we can find someone as dedicated as you to pick up where you left off.
,monkex,2009-09-04T19:53Z,Oh well. Thanks for all you've done Goose. Guess I'm gonna have to listen live now. Or I will have to. *hoping somebody fills your big shoes*
,comefly2,2009-09-05T04:25Z,"Goose, if you can give me an email address (just a made up gmail one is probably best, since posting an address here is an invite for spam!), I have some questions about how to easily capture/remove commercials/up. 

I wouldn't mind trying to throw the episodes online...but I don't have the slightest clue how to do it! 

Or, an even more anonymous way... could you just put the instructions in a notepad file and up it as a torrent/piggyback it with the next episode?

Thanks!"
