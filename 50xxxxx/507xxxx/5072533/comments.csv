No voiceovers."
,Sephiroth912,2009-08-30T05:46Z,"Leaves' Eyes is one of those rare bands I actually would buy the CD for...but it doesn't come out until next month here so this is as good a holdover as any for the time being -- and it has the bonus tracks too! Awesome, thanks a ton! 

You also wouldn't happen to have the ""My Destiny"" and ""Elegy"" EPs would you? I'd like the extras on those ones but can't seem to find them."

,jasonk_31,2010-05-25T16:52Z,"I've seen Leaves' Eyes every time they've been in Canada.  Liv and her husband Alex always join the crowd after their set for meet 'n greet.  Liv is a sweet woman with an amazing voice and a sort of purity about her.  Alex is a great guy, friendly, and gigantic.  I'm 6'3"" and 280 lbs.  He could destroy me.  lol!  And they are always happy to sign albums!!!  If you love their music, please, support the artist   =D"
