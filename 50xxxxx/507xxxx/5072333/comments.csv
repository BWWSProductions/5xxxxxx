It's interlacing. To solve that, use VLC media player, the option-- video-de-interlace-blend."
,greylion,2009-08-30T19:21Z,"@twilyt
8 for Video, are you kidding? It's totally blurry, the contrast and colours have been tampered with, the aspect ratio is wrong, and it's interlaced.
8 for Video, yeah, in some bizarre parallel universe.
V: 4
A: 8"
,twilyt,2009-08-31T18:59Z,"Interlacing I gave the solution. If you do as I said it's much better. And it's a ""TV rip"". Not a DVD. So the aspect ratio will be 4:3 only... Colors look fine !! You cannot expect better quality when it's been ripped from a Televsion..."
,greylion,2009-08-31T20:09Z,"@twilyt
So you're rating it relative to the source, and not as an absolute scale?"
,Hypozeus,2009-09-16T00:40Z,"Great quality for a tv rip.

6/10 for video
8/10 for audio

Play it on your tv and its near perfect."
