,AJNorth,2011-02-04T20:35Z,"Thank you for seeding this gem of a movie! Like so many films by ""The Archers"" (that are far too little-known in the U.S), AMOLAD is an absolute classic that defines truly great cinema.

One of Martin Scorsese's favorite films, he was instrumental in a partial restoration of the picture in 1995, and I was fortunate to have seen it on the big screen in its limited theatrical release; what a treat it would be to see the full restoration in a theater!

Stand-out performances all around, especially Roger Livesey (also in ""I Know Where I'm Going"" and ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"") and Marius Goring (also in ""The Red Shoes"").

As with virtually every film by P & P, writing, directing, production design, cinematography, musical score (and cast) are all impeccable - in this world, or the next. 10/10

,peterhump3,2011-12-03T21:30Z,Whoever was seeding this earlier today PLEASE come back!!!!
,peterhump3,2011-12-04T10:42Z,"THANK YOU!!! I never thought it would happen, I've had the torrent sat waiting for the best part of  a year!
There's a fair bit of visual compression artefacts but I've seen worse and the audio is very good. 
Though it's a must see - I love this film and will seed indefinitely! Hopefully I can pass it on :)"
