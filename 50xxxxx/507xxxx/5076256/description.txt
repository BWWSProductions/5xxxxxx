Call of the Killer Whale 1of2
Aired on April 22, 2009

In this two-part episode, the Ocean Adventures team explores our counterparts in the sea -- the orca, ruler of the ocean. Orcas, also called killer whales, are the most widely distributed marine mammal in the world, but number fewer than 100,000 worldwide. Jean-Michel Cousteau and his team travel to New Zealand and the Pacific Northwest and discover that people and orcas share surprising similarities, even similar needs, and they relate their findings to the captivity and release of Keiko, from Free Willy fame, who captured the world's imagination and whose survival depended on Cousteau's pioneering efforts to reintroduce Keiko into the wild.
