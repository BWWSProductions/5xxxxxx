If you know what this is then you do.  if not, I will not state it here. I only updated the tracker.  It's not a secret, like I said I only updated the tracker. I do not want to explain what it is, especially since it is not my torrent.  I am only reseeding it with an open tracker because all the trackers everywhere have been down lately (including TPB)  Since no one else would seed, this one became rare, and I was the only seed left.  this is not the case now. yay openbittorrent.com!  

so far showing 51 seeds

note:  TPB tracker is still in this torrent, not my fault it does not seem to connect.
