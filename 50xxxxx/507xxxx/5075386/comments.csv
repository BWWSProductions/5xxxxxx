You can't argue with facts and The Truth.

KNOW WHAT IS IN OUR WHITE HOUSE FOR REAL. This is NOT conspiracy crap. I HATE conspiracy crap as anyone who has ever read a post I made under a 9/11 conspiracy torrent would know. 
This SHIT is for real and we MUST ALL WAKE UP."
,booboo332,2009-09-02T00:38Z,Sometimes I wonder if the conspiracy oriented are being manipulated to be another Weapon of Mass Distraction to distract people from what is going on right in front of their eyes.  But that would be another conspiracy wouldn't it.  :)

If they get involved with this then the leftist socialists will OF COURSE bring it up and make it seem like we are all just a bunch of crazy internet nutfucks. NBC is already State Run Media in my opinion..VOLUNTARILY. Same with ABC and to a lesser(maybe) extent CBS. 

Truthfully I only see much truth and both sides on FOX network news these days. Glenn Beck has been asking the hard questions others won't touch..or will, but not go all the way. 

Even before Mr. Beck I knew this was going to be a travesty waiting to happen when Hussein got elected. Then again I already knew he was a boarderline communist(at the LEAST), so I could see no good of it. His fundamental change in the United States qoute before taking office was politicallly and governmentally terrifying to me. As was when he was actually elected. 

The socialists and communists are running the country now. They snuck in and fooled a bunch of fools. He didn't even have explain exactly what he was going to do. All he had to do was stand on his Greek God stage and spout pretty words that meant NOTHING.

It angers me greatly that people can be so easily dissauded from The Truth."
