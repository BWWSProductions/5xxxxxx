,luser01,2009-08-30T16:50Z,Thanks for the upload! 
,jammeke,2009-08-30T17:55Z,"Whats the diference between this 'family' pack and a single user?

I have a single user and use it on 2 iMac's, is this a problem?

thanks"
,golantrevize,2009-08-30T19:32Z,"Is this 10A436 version ?

Is this Family Pack coming from a box ?

However, thanks for sharing :)"
,luser01,2009-08-30T20:37Z,"I don't if there is any difference. I have 3 macs and bought this one. 

My computer says:
System Version:	 Mac OS X 10.6 (10A432)"
,mikexxxryan,2009-08-30T21:09Z,"The family pack offers five licenses for five different machines and sells for $44.  The single license pack sells for $29.  Thus, if you have 2 Macs and wanted to be legal, you could pay $60 for two separate licenses or $44 for 5 legal licenses.

Installed the family pack on four (home) Macs: 13"" MacBook Pro, 15"" MacBook Pro, 24"" iMac and 3.2Ghz Mac Pro.  Excellent OS, installs went as smooth as buddah.  Go for it!"
,m9o,2009-08-31T05:36Z,"@mmnz

there is no difference between a illegit OS and a legit one!!!!!  in terms of installation and running the OS (in a mac)
a copy is a copy!

is a shame how people just click and know absolutely nothing about computers, lucky for them apple makes it very simple"
,mac-freak,2009-08-31T07:34Z,"hey mate :P thanks for the upload but 1gb/s ^^ lol 

AprilSwift if you have leopard you can update from this but you cannot if you have tiger if that answers your question "
,mac-freak,2009-08-31T07:36Z,also there are 56 seeders atm and 347 peers thanks for sharing 
,golantrevize,2009-08-31T11:41Z,"Has anyone downloaded it entirely ?

If so, is it really snow leopard since the dmg file is called ""Mac OS X Install DVD"" ? From the name, no one can tell for sure^^

Don't want to download an earlier version (also  the size of the file is smaller than other SL copy on TPB... it make me doubtful even since it's compressed...). Thx"
,golantrevize,2009-08-31T12:18Z,"I've checked, it seems to be the good one :)"
,sundazed,2009-09-01T18:49Z,"Whilst you can't upgrade Tiger using the Snow Leopard upgrade pack you can do a clean install from it as it is the whole OS, not just upgrade parts."
,dvdtrac,2009-09-03T13:14Z,"Does not work
I downloaded the complete image, burn on dual disk,
restart the computer choosing Mac OS X Install disk but the installation does not start ! Signal appears, i can't instal on the HDD !! I tried on 3 different computers and optical drives, always the same signal!
I am running Mac os 10.5.8 on a Macpro quad-core.
If someone has complete this instal, please let us know ..."
,stef_u,2009-09-06T20:27Z,"Will someone please SEED this for God's sake?

Have been downloading @3k for 4 DAYS NOW, uploading a constant 30k. this is a joke.

Some of you blood sucking, leeching bastards start seeding a bit, or we might as well forget this torrent - it's gonna take a month."
,farewellic,2009-09-08T15:14Z,"For your information:

Snow Leopard Upgrade ($29)
Snow Leopard found in Mac Box Set ($169)
Snow Leopard Family Pack ($49) and
Snow Leopard that you can obtain by up-to-date program ($6.99)

ARE THE SAME DVD!
Nothing difference. No license check. No key required. All you can perform clean install from a blank, erased harddisk."
,stef_u,2009-09-08T19:27Z,"I'm getting so sick and tired of the FUCKING IGNORANT PIGS in this community with a SHIT share ratio.

SEED this fucking torrent rather than just leeching then turning off you bunch of selfish wankers, otherwise you can bet your bottom dollar nobody is going to give a FUCK about the remaining leeches when they are done and there are no seeds left - me included.

GIVE, as well as take you fucking pigs."
,DRWAM,2009-09-09T22:02Z,"You do not need a DVD burner or External drive. You can partition your hard drive into two, using the Disk Utility in the Utilities folder in the Application folder. In the Help section, learn to create a 2nd 12 GB partition, without deleting the old of course. Then use ""Restore"" to this disk image as the source and the new partition as the destination. Restart booting from the new partition and install Snow Leopard. That's what I did. Worked fine."
,thairan,2009-09-12T13:00Z,"Have tried on 2 macs....always get to 30% and it quits. I quit too......seeding, that is....."
[T],Apokarteron,2009-09-12T17:18Z,I think you ripped it badly and didn't get the Windows partition in with the Boot Camp drivers.
,bhunglow,2009-09-13T02:01Z,"Hey guys, would anyone be as kind to send me a invite code for Demenoid? I would cherish and greatly appreciate it.My email is bhunglow@aol.com  Thank you"
,thairan,2009-09-13T14:30Z,From now on...no downloads unless they have the little pirate cartoon after their name.....fuck 'em.....
,mac-freak,2009-09-26T04:03Z,"I have downloaded this and I will be installing it tomorrow but I really want to know if this is the ""Gold Master"" edition. also thank you to the seeders as i was downloading as fast as my airport would allow ^^"
,mac-freak,2009-09-26T04:06Z,"also the file will not have boot camp this is a bug with disc utility....

this can be fixed with getting boot camp from leopard."
,fd.villa,2009-10-29T20:40Z,"Simply doesn't work.... also installs up to 30% it restarts, but takes me back to my HD. Tried to boot from the dvd but gives me an alert and it never boots, just keeps spinning. same problem when i boot with option key and select the install dvd. if i try to boot to utilities takes me back to my hard dirve, must be a problem in the boot sector of the dmg. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!! IT JUST DOESN'T WORK!!"
