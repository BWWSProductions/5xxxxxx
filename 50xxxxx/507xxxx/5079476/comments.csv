,tore-up,2009-11-27T01:08Z,"seems to work okay but i cant get it to be the default pdf reader?????
i can manually select it to open any pdf by selecting from list of programs, etc.,etc... - but theres no file association and once i close it im back to square one????
this would've pretty nice otherwise. 
just dont wanna have to be launching it every time or going throught the whole""select program from computer"" thing all the time.
:( "
,LFXTrader,2009-12-05T00:46Z,"Useless. Does not work. There is no ""crack"" just an empy crack folder with a text file in it posing as the genuine serial number which has since EXPIRED. Don't waste anyones bandwidth with this crap."
,LFXTrader,2009-12-05T00:58Z,"Forget what I said above, it works now."

I really appreciate your great effort in bringing out such a fantastic software, please accept my congrats.
Keep up the amazing work."
,sparker781,2010-03-25T14:40Z,Thanks for the up.  Works flawlessly and its better in my opinion than having bloatware ADOBE on your system....Thanks AGAIN

,suckbox554,2010-08-08T13:45Z,Why does the installed program on desktop and the start menu not have an Icon for the shortcuts to the phantom exe?

,jaymovez,2010-12-03T16:41Z,"Thanks! Just made an account here to write that

By the way I found the key file does not register if you put the file in the folder. But it does work when you copy/paste contents when asked for registry key."
,loldude101,2010-12-22T19:33Z,Thank You.
,gruntworker,2011-01-28T15:20Z,"Excellent - thank you thank you thank you!

I had dl'd another with bad license file (or didn't work for me alas) - was really bummed because this is one sweet little program - 1/10 the size of the original Adobe bloatware!"
,gruntworker,2011-02-07T18:27Z,"Alas, after playing with it for a while I'm uninstalling it and going back to the bloatware - no provision for reducing file size, and it produces some big ass files.... I also tried Infix and have scrapped it as well."
[V],phatwarez,2011-08-25T20:07Z,"Cheers. Third time downloading this torrent, keeps working!"
,madmel,2011-11-20T19:23Z,It tells me the license key has expired.
,callbeer,2012-06-30T15:02Z,thanks bobo66 works perfect with that license file and IÂ´m glad to not have to deal with adobe acrobat anymore. foxit phantom are mutch better and faster pdf creator so thanks again for your great upload.
