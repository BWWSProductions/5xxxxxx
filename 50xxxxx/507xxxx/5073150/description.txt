This is a very extreme manga. The message of this work is "Do not mix the imaginary world with the real one". There are differences between imagining something and doing it in reality - that is what we want to show. To do this, we asked Mr. Waita Uziga to draw this work based on a crime that really happened. This work is not meant to justify the crime and the criminal. Whenever we find out the details of such a crime, we are frightened by the criminal's unbelievable egoism, and become angry. As you read this work, we want you to learn the bare facts, and feel anger at the atrocious crime.
