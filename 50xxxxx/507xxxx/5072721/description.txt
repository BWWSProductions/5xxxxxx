[RAW - (No Subtitles, Japanese Audio) / HIGH DEFINITION / COMPLETE]



PLOT: In the near future, a mysterious armed group called "Panther Claw" is terrorizing Tokyo and causing panick among it's citizens. Although the Police Force and the Riot Police led by Police Inspector Natsuko are on the case, they are unable to apprehend the members of Panther Claw or even stop their destruction of Tokyo. Gold Claw, one of Panther Claw's big four, takes over a television station and that's when a beautiful girl appears to save the day. She calls herself Cutie Honey, the fighter of love.

Cutie Honey is really Kisaragi Honey, an android made by Dr. Kisagagi who before his untimely death was the world leading scientist. Honey is normally a dull temporary girl, however, when she shouts "Honey Flash"ã€€and touches her heart shaped choker, she activates her "ai System"(love system) and turns into a super powered android. Cutie Honey is on a mission to fight against the evil Panther Claw organization and in the name of love and justice she vows to avenge her creators death.
