I love ALF and have been getting all the episodes, and want to thank Trotyl for the season 3 episodes. There are three ep. missing, 9, 15, and 24, so I found them and want to share them with you all. ALF is the best!!!

BTW, it is English, and no subs.

Please don't hit and run! Seed at least 100@ after downoading. I can't do it all by myself!!!! Thanks!!
