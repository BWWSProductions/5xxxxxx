Fabulous Spanish Baroque music
Al Ayre EspaÃ±ol;Eduardo LÃ³pez Banzo

The villancico, a religious genre dating from the 17th century and an early form of the 18th century cantata, makes novel use of arias and recitatives. Since it was based on popular images and made use of vernacular texts it enjoyed tremendous success. Eventually, a villancico could be either secular or sacred. 
The Church was the Minister of Culture at the time. All major musicians tried to work for the Church, and many were priests. The cathedrals had huge organs, choirs, lots of singers. Works for four choirs could be composed.
