Frustrated with his most recent film doing poorly, film director Able Whitman finds himself at a strip club where he meets and takes home one of the strippers, Gigi Stops. They have an accident on the road which kills Gigi leaving Able to figure out what to do with the body. He conveniently decides to "disguise" the body parts as set pieces to his new horror film. When this new design style is met with much praise, Able decides he needs more parts to fulfill his new "project"
