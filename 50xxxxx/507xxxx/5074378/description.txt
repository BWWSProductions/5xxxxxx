Hello All, 
	
	I hope you enjoy the Audio Book collection of Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark, by Alvin Schwartz. The drawings are all done by Stephen Gammell. I personally added all the pictures to this pack then reuploaded. It took literally forever to find all the damn art and match it. I also added some of the other tales from this collection that I could not find elsewhere. Either way, Keep and Share this pack and remember SEED SEED SEED!!

This is my first torrent, I don't have fancy syntax pictures, but I do think you will enjoy these scary stories. Seed To keep this alive.
