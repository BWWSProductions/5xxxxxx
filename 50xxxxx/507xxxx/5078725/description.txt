The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck is currently believed to be the very first comic book printed in America.

The series was written and drawn by Swiss cartoonist Rudolphe TÃ¶pffer (1799-1846), who, in his own language, named the character "M. Vieux Drink". It was first published in Europe, in several different languages, in 1837 (TÃ¶pffer, credited by many with the invention of the graphic novel, had started creating what he called "picture stories" ten years earlier). On September 14, 1842, a New York paper, Brother Jonathan, ran an English-language version of Oldbuck (published in Britain a year earlier) as a supplement

The story consists of Mr. Oldbuck trying to win the affection of his ladye-love.
