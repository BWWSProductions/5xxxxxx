Alright, so I'm aware that some files in this, past and probably future galleries are either backwards or "missing" files (ie. goes from 14 to 16) but all the pictures are there, they are just mislabeled from the SG website itself. I checked to make sure. I don't know why it is, but I don't rename them because that would just end up postponing the uploads further. Sorry if it's caused any confusion at all but I figured I'd just give everyone a heads up that nothing is actually missing. If I had more time I would fix it, but I would rather get these to you guys than worry about renaming a few files.


But alas, I digress. Enjoy another fine set and be assured that Part 2 of this will be coming shortly!
