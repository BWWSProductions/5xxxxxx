[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-03-07T02:03Z,"Thank You. Episode 20 has the Short Storey ""Button, Button"" which is what the movie ""The Box"" 2009 is based off of! +1"
,alehman,2010-03-12T06:12Z,Any idea why it is that the audio isn't working for me?
,photojoe3,2010-04-07T05:09Z,"This is great, the interview between Mike Wallace and Rod Sterling is really interesting.  The first episode is also incredible, I love how in true 1950 style (tv being the iPad of the day) networks basically had to beg and plead for advertising dollars.  It took a few days to download but was def worth it."
,cuffofizz,2010-06-09T02:52Z,Does anybody have any idea how many DVDs I'll need to burn these? (4.7 GB) I'm guessing around 7?
,cuffofizz,2010-06-09T23:08Z,"turns out I'm getting 3 eps. per disk. thats gonna be about 50 disks... Does anybody have an easier way? I guess I could hook my laptop up to the TV, but I'd rather not considering the amount of shit I already have on my laptop.

As for the files themselves, it's great quality. Audio is good, and the images are about as clear as you can get for a show made in the 50s. Thx rock."
,sirkolls,2010-07-21T21:56Z,"Thanks for the upload! This is awesome!!! You can get 11-12 episodes on 1 disc if you use DVD Flick, which you can download for free.  Google it.  "
,Hman242,2010-08-07T02:46Z,Man is this torrent going slow.... oh well. I appreciate you uploading it. I'll be sure to seed the shit out of it once I'm done.
,Cyber6678,2010-08-11T07:32Z,great torrent. Going kind of slow but oh well. This is by far the best show ever put on television. Quality is great too. Now i just need to find something to store these on lol.
,justregged,2010-09-20T19:42Z,dont suppose you will be uppin the blu-rays of the first 2 seasons?
,staringatangels,2010-11-21T16:21Z,"Great upload, thanks for putting all episodes in one torrent! Saves a lot of trouble trying to find each season individually. I remember watching a lot of these episodes on SyFy, but there's many I haven't seen.
@cuffofizz
Seems almost too obvious to say, but if you want to watch these on your DVD player but save discs, make sure you have a player able to play avi files, then make data discs. I did that with the X-Files and fit about 12 eps per disc. Depends on the size of the files."
,peterfarge,2011-03-21T12:34Z,"The subtitles are missing from the following parts:
Season 1
S03E14 Five Characters in Search of an Exit
S03E31 The Trade-Ins
S03E37 The Changing of the Guard
S05E21 Spur of the Moment

For the other parts you can find them in the web. For season 1 you'll find nothing. The subtitles of the last 4 films are also in the web, but they dont match the film in no way. (I have compared the dialogs.) They are wrong labeld. Maybe a copy paste error."
,Kanano,2011-04-23T22:12Z,"I LOVE YOU PEOPLE!! I was browsing online a few days or so ago, and remembered that old show, the Twilight Zone, I thought ""That was a good show, I think I want to watch it again."" 



So I search for a torrent of it, and what do I find? THE COMPLETE SERIES. DVD RIPPED. I LOVE YOU! :D"
,imnotminkus,2011-06-03T23:54Z,Is this going ridiculously slowly for anyone else?  81 seed/178 leach and I can't even get one episode.  I'd seed tons but I can't get anything!
,Seth01,2011-07-23T11:17Z,Huge thanks for this.
,Catastrophic_Failure,2011-08-03T02:09Z,"This show is really eerie and creepy. Imagine how terrifying this must have been to watch back in 1959/60. Nothing quite like it had been made on TV or cinema back then.

Great series and 10/10 for audio and video."
,brutal_product,2011-08-29T22:12Z,"will seed this epic epic torrent!!
Rocktookmehere +1 !!!"
,FigonaPetter2,2011-09-08T22:18Z,"@ JugzG0nn4G3tY4 

I can't thank you enough for saying that. My only reason for being here is to try to figure out which episode it is that ""The Box"" is based upon. Been trying to figure out for a while.

Many thanks!!"
,useitright,2011-09-29T10:58Z,"It says at the end of the movie The Box that the movie is based off of a short story by Richard Matheson.  I do not know if the episode was also based on the short story, but I do not think the short story and the episode are one in the same.  Great Job on the upload."
,useitright,2011-09-29T11:02Z,"I looked it up.....the episode is based off of the same short story.  So to give credit where it is rightfully due, both the episode and the movie were based on a short story named Button, Button."
,a_raccoon,2011-10-12T05:37Z,nobody seems to be capable of encoding every episode/season/disc with identical settings (bitrate).  this is another franken-collection(tm).
,j0nnyboy,2012-01-08T07:49Z,"Thanks alot, very cool torrent. Shame about the seeder / leecher ratio :("
,j0nnyboy,2012-01-08T07:53Z,fuck ill never get this... ETA: 3 yrs 24 weeks. fuck everyone who doesn't seed.
,Fopenplp,2012-02-18T04:10Z,"Why do the tags read ""Rod Sperling""?"
,elab247,2012-04-11T23:45Z,Wowser ! Thank you !
