RLSNOTES:


Warning! This synopsis contains spoilers:

The film follows Alex, Max, Justin and their parents on a trip to the Caribbean. Alex is upset that her
parents are telling her what to do despite being sixteen years old. When her parents confiscate her wand,
and she gets in a fight with her mother, she wishes her parents had never met. This in turn causes her
wish to come true, and her parents forget about each other and about their kids Alex, Max, and Justin.
Justin figures his father must still have his powers since his dad and mom had never met and asks his
father, who has no recollection of Justin and just regards him as a random tourist and wizard on what to
do about the situation, he tells him that they must find the Stone Of Dreams, a magical stone that can
reverse any spell and grant any wish. Justin and Alex then embark on a journey to find the Stone Of
Dreams. Meanwhile, Max scrambles to make his parents fall in love again.
