,tulsatrans,2009-09-16T03:58Z,"Christofascist, good word, if you really want to get scared watch exorcist, if you want to shit your pants and hide under your covers watch the documentary "" Jesus Camp"" that is some scary shit!!! you thought muslims are brainwashed, thats nothing compared to american christians"
,bezad,2009-10-06T23:07Z,"It's a shame that so many turn away from this stuff because some christians happen to be in the know about this.  This stuff about the fema camps is well documented, there are multiple documents and other legislation confirming.  While I can see why people would be turned off about a subject when it is presented in this manner, the threat is well documented and very real.  For the same information without a christian spin (ie this happening for turning away from god and welcoming damnation from satan etc etc), I'd recommend a movie like Camp Fema by the organization started by Aaron Russo who made the film From Freedom to Fascism detailing the scam that has plagued this nation since 1913, same year the unconstitutional federal reserve act began enslaving the nation with debt.

Please don't ignore irrefutable facts simply because christians bundle it with their religion.  Of course I don't expect my comment to change anyones mind.  We have become a complacent nation that seeks only to be entertained by shows like American Idol and to be lied to by a government long sold out to globalist bankers."
