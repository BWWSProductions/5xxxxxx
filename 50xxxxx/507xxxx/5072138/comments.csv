,segretto,2009-08-29T16:36Z,"@ titestef
Download speed is a bit slower, but it's certainly working for most of the people.
And I guess you should be more polite in your commentaries"
,tauffen,2009-08-29T22:49Z,"Some downloads are a mess indeed. But with some of them I simply deleted the torrent and downloaded again. Then the seeders and leechers became visible and active. But others are a little bit strange: there are days that work and days that don't.
Hey! Could be worse! At least the site is not completly down!"
