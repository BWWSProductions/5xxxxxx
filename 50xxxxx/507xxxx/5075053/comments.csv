,ricardo000,2009-09-02T02:15Z,"To ""nexia""  I have not downloaded this, but did from another torrent in June and it was the same size. Check your facts before you open your mouth, lest it be full of bullshit!"

I work with ppc G4 1.67Ghz and it work perfect, its not bullshit, its a real dvd install. I run it with Tiger and now with leopard. but for this dvd after burn work well on Tiger you need upgrade or downgrade it to 10.4.4, its the recommended version for Tiger. I had the 10.4.9 and i got some error that make it disable to install, so i downgrade and i could install with out problems. With leopard 10.5.5 you will install it with out problems. The problem i had was: i put the dvd and just appears the dialog box empty!! over the 10.4.4 and under i dont know why, i googled and i check was with much more users also the same problem.
 To burn the dmg on the dvd you need a double layer dvd and a super drive in mac that can support this format, i burn it with disk utility, but before burn check the permissions for the user with read&write, after in the disk utility you deselect verify burn data and burn it at the end will say it to you that was successful and its done. Or you use it on 10.4.4 and after you can upgrade your OS system or you use it in the leopard"

,Zephaniah,2011-01-08T14:39Z,@NoahMaori You do not need 10.4.4 to install this. Just installed it on 10.4.11 and it works fine. You also don't need to burn it to a DVD. Just mount the .dmg file (double click it) and run the installer straight from the hard disc.
