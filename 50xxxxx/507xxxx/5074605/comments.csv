    0

should there at least be one of either :("
,tdmk1,2009-08-31T21:44Z,"@crawman - Yep @Rikardov is absolutely spot on, the trackers at TPB are not very well at the moment - lots of discussions over at http://forum.suprbay.org/ if you're interested...

I have added multiple trackers to the torrent (and will with future ones too) to help circumvent the problem. As of yet I'm not sure why the seeders:leechers ratio doesn't get picked up on TPB listings, even though they do on the download client... anyone know? :)"
,Fast Glass,2009-09-02T03:29Z,"Thanks for another great upload.
Any chance for the 125 and 250 races... 
I didn't like the race either since it was a giveaway... but was nice to be there."
,tdmk1,2009-09-04T18:58Z,"@Fast Glass - 'nice to be there', I think we're all just a little bit jealous right now! ;)

There's a couple of problems stopping me from doing the 125 & 250 stuff too,

1. I can't record the Interactive Broadcast stuff automatically, and that how the BBC programme it.

2. I really don't have enough upload bandwidth to push it all out (I upload the F1GP races too).

3. I'm scared of my missus & this takes a fair chunk of my weekend time already... :)"

,dpance,2009-09-05T05:00Z,"tdmk1,

Many, MANY thanks for uploading these races.  I'm new to MotoGP and am digging the hell out of the sport.  That Yamaha Fiat team seems unstoppable!

I'm here in the States and usually record the big boys on SpeedTV.  I somehow missed Laguna Seca and caught the torrent you were kind enough to upload.  The British dudes who called the race are different from the commentators on Speed and I thought they did a grand job.  Plus, all the interviews at the end of the race and the glimpse at what happens on the podium were tasty.

Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!"
