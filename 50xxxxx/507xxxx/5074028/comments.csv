,borgenhaust,2009-09-18T07:37Z,"such a great movie, the last scene is missing!! the scene where they are married and sitting out by the pond is not in this!!"
,Kaowaii,2011-07-14T22:56Z,@borgenhaust: Oh thank you very much for spoiling everyone about the ending! Best thing ever when I'm about to watch a movie. FUCK YOU
,issha,2011-09-08T10:49Z,"hehe, well, it was based on a book so kinda hard to spoil the movie unless you've never read the book...however, there were no kissing scenes in the book.  @borgenhaust: this is the UK version w/o the alternate ending only released in the US and Canada."

Thank anyway."
