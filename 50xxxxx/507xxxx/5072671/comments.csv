,leeSally,2009-08-29T23:01Z,"Dear Sheila6:

I grew up in a culture of only eating animal products that the animals died only monutes before. Vegitables were purchased daily from the market ( 50years ago)

 Now with the need of transportation and sanitation, the food tastes like cardboard. That is why the seasoning is needed, especially salt. Then we all get high blood pressure and other deseases. "
,ricardo000,2009-09-18T04:45Z,"I also WAS a member of their ""community"". They cut me off even though I seeded back everything. A true bunch of jerks!"
,Whippet999,2009-10-17T17:38Z,Thank you so much for this. 
,anth303,2010-05-23T12:10Z,"Thank you sheila , theBOX is run full of C$%ts
