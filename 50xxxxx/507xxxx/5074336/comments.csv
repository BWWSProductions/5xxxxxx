,Kougake,2010-01-01T02:01Z,"I agree with nicolasgoddone, I hate it when its dubbed into english. It seems so fake and tainted.... Watch it in its original language like it was intended."

the voice actors weren't doing a good job in that copy of the movie, in my opinion."

I'm not going to dignify that site with a look or mention its name, but I say it here to those of you who are annoyed at this kind of behavior."
,Noisuf-X,2010-10-09T03:32Z,"Stop being such purist douchebags. If the english voice acting is good, then fuck it. It is great both ways."
,treeant23,2010-12-05T23:06Z,"@nicolasgoddone
No, it's not. Not when the dub is professional. It's sacrilege to put otaku snobbery of subtitles over the ability to look at the beautiful animation and art. I don't want to read the bottom of the screen and miss so much."
,Hillwalker,2011-01-11T17:16Z,"I prefer to watch any film in it's original language to get the intended feel of the film.

However, if some of the viewers are young children unable to read, then a dubbed version obviously would be beneficial - Thanks for the link, Makeswell."
,kornomanus,2011-05-23T18:19Z,I LOVE YOU FOR THIS UPLOAD!!
,sudamander,2011-06-25T19:17Z,"Nice balanced comment from Hillwalker. There are advantages to having both options. Which is why, I've just started the dowload of this movie from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6124605/Howl_s_Moving_castle_%5BHDTV_x264_720p_Ac3_Ita_Eng_Jap_SUB_Ita%5D_n"
