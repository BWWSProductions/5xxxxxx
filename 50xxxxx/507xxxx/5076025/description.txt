Since Dan "restructured" his website, one of his most popular songs,  "Lonely People", has  been almost completely inaccessible.  Reason being, the only way that you could obtain this CD is through ordering a vinyl record for $50, THEN buy a program + hardware (Spinitagain) for 35.99, THEN go through the trouble of setting it up, and transferring it to your computer, then burning it to a disk.

So, I'll upload the song here, and since I know most of you old Republicans today don't know how to operate a VCR, you can download it from the following link to your computer to add to a CD.

Don't forget to remove the spaces; the download will be faster and direct from the below links.  I upload slowly, so it may take a day or two for the dong to fully reach you.  For this reason, I need seeders.

REMOVE THE SPACES:

Enjoy!


I'll seed probably for a long time to come, so pickup on it only if you really want to.
