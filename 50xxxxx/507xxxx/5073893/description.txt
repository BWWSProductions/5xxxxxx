Superman 2 "The Richard Donner Cut" (1980)

As originally conceived and intended, The version you have never seen.

In Richard Donner's original vision of Superman II, the Man of Steel faces his greatest challenge yet! Three villainous outcasts, Non, Ursa, and their leader, General Zod, are freed from the Phantom Zone only to wreak havoc, devastation, and chaos unto Earth. While this occurs, Clark Kent and Superman, now revealed to Lois as one and the same, begins a forbidden romance with her that ends with the extinguishing of his powers as Earth's greatest savior for the woman he loves, all despite his father, Jor-El's warnings. Meanwhile, Superman's arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, has escaped from prison with the help of Miss Teschmacher. After discovering the Fortress of Solitude, and learning of the Three Deviant villains, Luthor rushes to aid them in their attempt at World Domination and revenge on Superman. It all boils down to an epic battle in which Revenge, Love, and a Legacy between Father and Son culminate.
