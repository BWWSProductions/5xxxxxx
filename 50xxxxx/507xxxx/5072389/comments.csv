Works perfectly."
,plsde1e,2009-08-30T16:16Z,"so that is the same as this one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4852693/Traktor_Pro_1.1_Mac_With_Crack

The tracker is down, so seeding and leeching info is meaningless at the moment...

This torrent works fine, although you may need to make the Traktor file (Contents > MacOS > Traktor) executable ( I had to do this, or the app wouldn't launch)"
,sam22278,2009-09-05T23:05Z,and this one is virus-free
,jafar2010,2010-01-05T15:37Z,"TGDr-aka-RG, how would one make the file executable? Cheers"
