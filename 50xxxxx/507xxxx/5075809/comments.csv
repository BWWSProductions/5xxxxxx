,El_Commi,2010-08-22T23:56Z,"This from the same guys who made ""League of Gentlemen"" if I heard correctly.
Very dark, and very twisted sense of humour. I love it.

Will seed for a while if its any good."
,Rapier_Wit,2010-08-23T15:34Z,"El_Commi you did hear correctly and it's a work of  dark, twisted genius just like the League. Thanks to the uploader."
,El_Commi,2010-08-23T23:11Z,"OK- 4 episodes in, and whilst it is still quite twisted, it seems to lack a lot of the humour that made League of gentlemen so good.
There's been a few chuckles here and there.
Perhaps it's just the laughter track I'm missing.

Either way, it is worth watch, it's certainly a lot more sophisticated than ""league.."" anyway. Will continue to seed, until I need HDD space ;p"
