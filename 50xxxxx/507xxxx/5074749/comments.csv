help???"
,ProfWaffles,2010-02-21T23:41Z,"Works fucking perfectly!!!!
Thank you!   +1

How I did it:
1.) Download (hurr durr)
2.) Mount With a Image Manager, (daemon tools, Alcohol 120) I personally used Alcohol 120.
3.) Install
4.) Place Crack that comes with download into the correct directory. 
ex. 
C:\Program Files (x86)\LucasArts\Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy\GameData

** note **
Program files (x86) may differ pending your what version of windows you are using (if using it at all)
5.)Then enjoy.
May the force be with you!"
,ProfWaffles,2010-02-21T23:42Z,"Sorry about the double the post, 

You will need to keep the first CD image mounted to play the game, If anyone finds a no CD crack that would be lovely."
,keepoffmyyard,2010-02-27T01:30Z,"The directories in the second CD are wrong. There are two ""Gamedata"" files when there should be only one. Because of this, I can't get the game to install."
,keepoffmyyard,2010-02-27T01:38Z,"Er, never mind. I tried it again, but this time I did a custom install. I don't know why, but it worked."

,tedi45,2010-04-27T12:51Z,does it work on WINDOWS 7 ????????
,Devster13,2010-05-02T03:22Z,Yes it works on Windows 7
,bellafibs,2010-05-03T02:46Z,"I got it working, for those wondering about it getting to 47% and not knowing what to do next because of the two gamedata folders, you have to mount the second desk and click the first gamedata there. Atleast, that's what I did.


But I was wondering why I can only play multiplayer. I mounted the first disc and it says the wrong disc is inserted, but when I mounted the second, it says that no disc is inserted. Help, anyone?"
,joveski,2010-05-10T00:00Z,"Windows 7 problem??


I installed it and when I run it, this message appears:

Tried installing the newest drivers and directx... Patched it and then cracked it again it still gives me that bloody message :)

,Romahx,2010-06-17T04:57Z,"Thanks Moir~ it worked!

Had problem to install the second CD at 47%.
But as Moir~ said, this is how you do:

Mount first CD, and when it asks for second cd, just unmount the game on the selected device, then chose the second CD and press ""OK"", without opening the ""browser"" button!"

Download poweriso.  Once that is done download this torrent.  After all that is done then mount the image jk1 to poweriso.  Then do jk2.  Once all of  that is done mount it back to jk1. 

MAKE SURE YOU MOUNT JK1 ALL THE TIME IF U WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER.

It does work fine and its a fun game.  If you have any other problems then you must update your video card.  I use to have a black screen when i first started and it didn't start anything.  I just did a simple update and now it works.  Good luck!"

Fortunately there are several things available for turning this format into our beloved ISO -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.nrg#Converting_nrg_files (used the no-install-needed command-line nrg2iso myself).

If you can't get the game to start up (only splash screen, or not even that), you might want to try the fix described at http://lucasforums.com/showthread.php?t=206018 . Should be a pretty universal one; at any rate, worked for me:-)"
