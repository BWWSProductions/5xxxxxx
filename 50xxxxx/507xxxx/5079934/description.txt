Lux-Pain (ãƒ«ã‚¯ã‚¹ãƒ»ãƒšã‚¤ãƒ³, Rukusuãƒ»Pein?) is a visual novel-type adventure video game developed by Killaware and published by Marvelous Entertainment for the Nintendo DS video game console

Lux-Pain is set in the historical Kisaragi City, a town plagued by mysteries from small mishaps to murders - with no logical explanation as to why these events occur. It seems "Silent", a worm born through hate and sadness, has infected humans and forced them to commit atrocious crimes. Atsuki's parents are the victim of such crimes. To avenge his parents, Atsuki goes through a dangerous operation to acquire Lux-Pain in his left arm, a power so strong that it turns his right eye golden when using it to seek and destroy Silent for good. In this game, however, there is a strong difference between Silent and worms. Worms are a sort of offspring created by Silent that are transferred to anyone who comes in contact with the host of the specific Silent. Worms are much weaker than Silent and are eliminated after simply finding them with the stylus and pressing on them for several seconds. Silent are considered the bosses of the game and though you face many smaller Silent they slowly show the larger Silent who is much stronger. After the first 10 "episodes" you face the first true Silent. This Silent is caused by the parents of a young terminally ill girl whom they left for dead in her room combined with her the girls own emotions. Though not mentioned specifically there are over 685 known Silent and you start with the 683rd.
