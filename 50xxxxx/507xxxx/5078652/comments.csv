,gbrown5940,2009-09-08T15:44Z,Does anyone know if this is the real remasters?
,baggies91mkp,2009-09-08T18:53Z,"im not sure, are the albums that were made in mono, supposed to be in mono on the remasters,
if they are real cannot hear any difference, but its certainly the beatles"
,cousintim,2009-09-09T03:54Z,"The inconsistent tagging and recording at 192 made me a bit suspicious.  That said, they sound good."
,dmoss74,2009-09-09T10:02Z,"these can't be the new remasters. if they are, then my old mfsl versions are ten times better. i smell bs. :D "
,dmoss74,2009-09-09T10:13Z,"definitely not the real deal. every song that is on love sounds better on that cd than these. 

not the real deal!"
,badlands,2009-09-10T09:47Z,"""The Betles""? Well, that surely boosts credibility to this torrent... As others here have stated, this is NOT the remastered versions. On top of that, the quality is even more crap than the 1987 cd's. Wait for the real stuff to get here and don't waste your time in downloading this. The uploader, some stupid smuck, obviously is brain damaged enough to devote time and space to put out the old cd's, claiming it's the new ones. Don't follow his example."
