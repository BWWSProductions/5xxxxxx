This is [as to my knowledge] all the music from the PC version of Dune video game sequel. It took me a couple of years to find this somewhere on the web. I don't remember if I have found this music already in mp3 or did I had to convert them from midi by myself. If you are concerned if they sound like in game I can tell you that they don't- and won't. In order to have Dune tracks sounding 100% like when you were playing the game 17 years ago you would need to have original MID banks taken out from game code and have them used with some old sound card. And that is nearly impossible. [Please correct me on this one if I am wrong]

The titles and order on the tracklist is propably as I have found it- I don't know if it was correct

I also have found back then what I thougt to be an Amiga version, but it came to be the Mega Drive one. Those tracks were was completely different from PC version - I only have kept the "Spice Trip", which sounds canna like those from PC [also credited to Frank Klepacki, Dwight K. Okahara & Paul S. Mudra]

I've remastered all of the tracks by adjusting the volume or making them lauder where it needed to be done without sound quality lost; I did not use some qucik automatic normalization option but instead of a that I used my eyes, ears and expierience. I also cleaned the tracks from any clicks / pops / pitches / glitches that would have been otherwise hearable on moderate volume on speakers [not headphones]

There will be more rare and remastered music coming up. I have a very low upload but I will keep seeding this torrent for months, propaby on nights [Central Europe time zone]
