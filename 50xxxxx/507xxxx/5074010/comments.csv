Stupid bastards if you didn't believe the 9/11 ""Conspiracy"" you might have made a valid film, but instead you look like and ARE a bunch of numbnut conspiracy fucks. Albeit correct about Obama on most points you destroyed your credibility...that's sad. Morons."

If you're going to call someone an insane moron, I think you skip Alex Jones, who's just a filmmaker. Why not attack 20-year Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer, the second-ranking civilian in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence, and former CIA clandestine services case officer, David Steele, who holds Cheney responsible for 9/11? You can do it in person if you are in New York City for the 9/11 Conference for Peace, Truth, and a New Economics. There will be some 9/11 family members there you can attack as well. Please report back on your experiences.

Citizen's End may wish to reflect that using unconvincing 'argument from authority' or emotional blackmail does not counter a lack of evidence or the question of impartiality, which a victim sadly (but obviously) may not be. 

Goodnight and good luck!"
