Muffins For Granny - Stories From Survivors Of The Canadian Residential School System (N. McLaren, 2007)-aNaRCHo

                      (FILM IN ENGLISH, FRENCH SUBS INCLUDED)


The sad history of the Canadian governmentâ€™s residential school program has had a profound effect on First Nations peoples across the country. For filmmaker Nadia McLaren itâ€™s personal history as well â€” her Ojibway grandmother was forced into a residential school and its repercussions have echoed through their family. Looking to understand her loving but troubled grandmother McLaren interviews seven First Nations elders about their experiences in residential schools. Mixing stark animated moments with human faces and home movie footage, this is a raw and honest documentary about a difficult chapter in Canadian history â€” a chapter that, for some, is not over. --Elan Mastai
