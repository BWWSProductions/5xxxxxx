,catamaranman,2011-05-09T14:26Z,"Ripped from a box set I highly doubt.  Movie 1 & 3 are fine.  Just what I'd expect for the file size.  Movie 2, however, is split into 2 700MB files and while, if you looked at any screenshot it might look like the other two quality-wise, when you watch it there are alot of dropped frames and skipping.  So keep #1 and #3, find a replacement for #2, it stinks. "

,four2wonyblaze,2012-02-27T05:03Z,"i dont know what your complaining about catamaranman but #2 played just fine, i could barely call that ""skipping"". it was totally watchable so, quit your bitchin or go fuck yourself."
