I found that to be slightly better quality."
,norskpar,2009-12-19T19:07Z,Thank you. 
,Naralli15,2010-03-18T03:15Z,"Thanks for the rip! This is the full length film (4 hours plus a minute or two)

A: 10
V: 8 (if you try to skip forward, the scene you were on and the scene you're skipping to kind of blend together. ONLY when you skip forward. Other than that the video was fine)"
,desertTPB,2010-05-08T04:24Z,"Whats the f.cking sound??? does it 5.1 or 2ch? its not seem to be 5.1  because its 4 hrs long movie and the size is only 2,09 gb ?!! so whats the deal?"
,hyeguy123,2010-05-10T22:06Z,"This is 4 hours, 2 minutes and 12 seconds exactly.

So, 242 minutes and 12 seconds."
,puppyup,2010-11-06T23:21Z,"Perfect rip! Excellent picture and sound quality at reasonable size.
Keep in mind that the total playtime is 242 minutes, i.e. over 4 hours!

,enkl0001,2011-07-20T13:20Z,DHT not allowed. All the trackers in the torrent have been down for the last 4 days. Any ideas?
