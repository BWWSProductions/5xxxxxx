Monique & Voodoo want to swing and swap and expand their sex lives. 

Being hot and young, there's no shortage of willing playmates. Add in a little jealousy and passion and you raise the stakes even higher.

Then add in the element of race, and you just might wind up with something incendiary, lascivious, and maybe even a little dangerous.

Paul Thomas and nasty little Monique explore all the erotic possibilities, in every color imaginable, in the wild new In Black & White. We think you'll find it very colorful... indeed.
