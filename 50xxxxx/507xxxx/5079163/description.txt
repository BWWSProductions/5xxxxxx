This torrent consists for all the dictionary files from: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4017231/

I have taken all the dictionary files originally combined them all into one file, then removed all entries that are less than 8 characters in length (since for WPA/WPA2 you must have at least 8 characters for a passphrase). Then I want through and made it so that each password is on each line (makes for easy import into aircrack-ng)

Here is the link to the post of both " -=Xploitz Pirates'=- Masters Password Collection #1! " and " -=Xploitz Pirates'=- Masters Password Collection #2 "
