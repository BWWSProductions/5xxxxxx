This is my first upload, please comment on any problems you may have, I will seed as much as possible, but internet is slow at my college.

This torrent is a direct iso copy made using imgburn of the game Stronghold Crusader Extreme.

You do not need the original to play.

Instructions:

1. Download, and unrar using a program like winace or winrar.

2. Mount the image using daemon tools, windows 7 users may find Virtual Clone Drive useful as DT is still not win7 compatible.

3. Install game as directed.

As far as i know, you will need to mount every time you want to play, because you need the disc in to play. I do not have a crack for this as like I said, this is a direct copy of the disc.

I love Katie and made this for her.
