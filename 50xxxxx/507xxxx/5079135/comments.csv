,Franklin54,2009-09-15T04:22Z,"tHIS IS NOT EPISODE 7, They canceled the show after episode 5 here in the states and this has already been seen, so it cant be episode 7"
,KengurBGD,2012-01-27T02:18Z,"@Franklin54 you are so wrong show was not canceled! They made 13 episodes and than show was concluded. Now you can also buy it on DVD. For all who like astronaut theme shows this is a must see...
And please seed ppl!"
