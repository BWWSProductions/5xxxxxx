,lochbuie,2009-09-05T21:03Z,You did not answer the virus complaint though.  I have not seen anyone banned on here???? Seen some real strong opinions.. I think a idle threat.
,Brashlight,2009-09-10T03:05Z,spotted_jackal you are a piece of shit. that crap you pawned off as a torrent is a big fucking virus. i only wish i could see you in real life cuz i would give you the beating you deserve. i hope you get what you got coming to you asshole!

In as much as I can see you have NEVER contributed anything here, so shut the F... Up; and in any event, nobody is forcing you to download any stuff from here !!! So...there you go I said my peace, BTW spotted_jackal ... Thanks"

go fuck yourself! how about you suck on my left nut. my comment wasn't directed at you. there are plenty of very reliable uploaders on this site i was simply making my point that this guy is not one of them. to put a torrent on here that is full of viruses is bullshit! i was just making that point. so again...you can suck on my left nut you little bitch. oh and you haven't contributed shit here either so you have absolutely no room to talk."

,thehack2002,2009-10-15T08:40Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! Spyware/Virus
,cdtext,2009-10-19T00:20Z,Why is this version only 327 MByte and the other one is 800 MByte. Where is the instructions on how to run it also?
,keksman,2009-11-14T20:40Z,DANGER!!! VIRUSES IN THIS TORRENT!!!
