,kerplunk,2009-09-03T11:30Z,Go through the file yourself...it's used to crack Kaspersky which is why it deletes it. (scan it with any other AV)

,table543,2009-09-03T17:43Z,"Instruction File says:

Kaspersky Patcher Instructions.

1. You must first have Kaspersky installed.
2. You MUST run PatchFix.exe before doing anything or this WILL NOT WORK!
3. After that open your Kaspersky and click ""Options"" and untick ""Enable Self-Defence"".
4. Run Kaspersky Patcher.exe
5. Choose if you have 32-bit or 64-bit OS and click Patch.

,McVilly,2009-10-11T15:00Z,"Most Antivirus will report hacks as trojans. That's why you have to disable self defence, as they'll report any tempering with their code as malicious intrusion.
But you can't crack something without changing original code, now, can you?"
,Guinelle1,2009-10-27T22:26Z,so can some 1 confirm this? or is it shit.
