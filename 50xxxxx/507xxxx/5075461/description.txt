   PLOT (Eng):
   Document name: Caught: The Ice Chest Murder

   In 1996 lawyer Tom Capano was accused of killing his ex-lover secretary Anne
   Marie Fahey. This documentary focuses on investigation of this murder and
   efforts to bring killer to justice. In June 1996 Tom Capano, a rich, powerful
   attorney from Delaware, murdered his ex-lover Anne Marie Fahey and disposed
   of the body. After a long and arduous investigation, police detectives knew
   Capano was responsible for Faheyâ€™s disappearance. But since they were unable
   to locate Faheyâ€™s body, they could not pin the crime on him. A year and
   a half later, a key piece of evidence would blow the case wide open. This is
   the story of the Anne Marie Fahey murder as told through the words of the
   investigators responsible for bringing her killer to justice.


   When you downloading these FTVDTs documents, remember seed also. Ratio should
   be bigger than 1.5. Don't be selfish, else this torrent system won't work.
