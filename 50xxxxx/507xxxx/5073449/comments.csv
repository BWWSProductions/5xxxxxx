,ex_pat3,2009-11-05T06:33Z,"Infected with what? I suspect nothing at all. AVG didn't report anything, and it did not make any registry changes.

Mrok, you've uploaded a lot of stuff here and I thank you for that and for this. However, I couldn't figure out how to block this program from Internet access (the license will be revoked) and still monitor streams. Must be a way, but I lost patience with it - not your fault!"

Thanks m8 I actually uninstalled ad-aware and AVG and went with Kaspersky just to get it to work and it worked like a charm. Cheers"

,dieselbuddy,2010-06-15T19:51Z,I really need this program and the licence file NO longer works!  Says it has been revoked.  Can you please share another working licence file?  
,nuckrah,2011-01-08T03:47Z,"It works fine.

1. block this ip with a firewall:

jaksta.com or 209.237.2.232

2. install app

3. register with license file"
