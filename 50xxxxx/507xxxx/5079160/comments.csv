[T],neanderthal,2010-01-08T23:12Z,"All of these DVD's were made from the 2004 videos, however they should be relevant for at least another century, since grammar changes very little, and vocabulary only increases slightly due to changes in culture and technology.  

Words like ""twitter"" and ""blackberry"" take on new meanings.  New words like ""netbook"" and ""googled"" are added.  These new words and meanings most likely would be universal to all languages anyway."
