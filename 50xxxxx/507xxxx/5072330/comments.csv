,ashman98,2009-10-07T00:31Z,thanx it works perfectly
,tomreedtoon,2011-06-12T03:42Z,"This version DOES work perfectly. The version 5.x versions have not had working keygens, and keys supplied with them are blacklisted when they go on line. Nobody has adequately hacked them. Why should they, when this version does everything you need and more?"
