And the picture above is taken at Roskilde Festival 2001 on the eurotour 2001 with Crazy Horse... I WAS THERE FRONT ROW!!! :-) The picture was sold at the festival the next day. It is hanging on my wall framed now.."

As a melancholy 18yo I fell in love with ""After The Goldrush"", and also bought ""Everybody Knows ..."" and a Crazy Horse bootleg (magical but terrible quality) from Richard Branson's first - & then only - record shop in 1971. We didn't even own a record player :)  "
