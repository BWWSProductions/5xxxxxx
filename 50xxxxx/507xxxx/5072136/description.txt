This slice-of-life story of an amoral drifter is an unusual product for the Yugoslavian film industry of its day, and it features a catchy title song. Having been imprisoned as a result of drug peddling, Mika manages to escape from a prison train and hooks up with a man who does horse-riding tricks in small-town fairgrounds. When she spies the police on her trail, she hitches a ride into Belgrade with a boy on a motorcycle. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide
