,Phavonic,2009-09-02T00:11Z,"Thanks again for all the great posts, discovering some real gems here. 80s was such and enjoyable decade for music.....what makes for a treasure is that it is hidden in obscurity.

Please people check out my torrent by an icelandic 80s group called *Bara Flokkurinn* before it dies. Marvelous synthpop there."

After a search of years i finally found the album here. I was forgotten the name of the album and the artist but a  search to the song dream boy led me to this album here. You have made me happy!!
I will going to look for your other uploads."
