How am I ripping off other peoples DL when I specifically said that I dont crack all the apps?

Ripping off would be claiming them as my own, I also crack apps using appcrack because I want to give back to the community that has helped me in many ways.

you need dictionary.com: 

rip off, Slang. a. to steal or pilfer. 
b. to rob or steal from. 
c. to swindle, cheat, or exploit; take advantage of: phony charity appeals that rip off a gullible public.
