This Torrent was created by HolyRooster, and the Files were converted by HolyRoses, i just batched them up and uploaded them. thanks HolyRoses for the star wars show you converted, cant wait for season 2!!!!
these are all fine working torrents with the jpg for youre psp.

but when you import all of the files into itunes the ifrst 11 will go into the movie section, all you have to do is go into youre movie category in itunes select genre, and then pick (Sci-Fi), and then go to get info and select options, and under the volume control just click from movie to, tv-show.
all of these torrents should work good enjoy

star wars the clone wars is a amazing show for those who have not seen it, give it a try you will not be dissapointed!!!!
thanks 
HolyRoses
stay Holy
