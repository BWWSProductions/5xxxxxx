,wolfrick1,2011-08-22T00:32Z,i desperately need the other albums form them plz help or i might have to commit that capitol sin of going to buy them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,rocknratm,2011-09-14T06:55Z,"bro, there is no sin in paying for an album like this. listen to the music, I would gladly pay $20 a pop for each of their three albums (as far as I know they have 3).
Check out 10 ft ganja plant and Rebelution . Those two along with soja are my three faves!!!! Peace and love"
