,[NTT],2009-09-06T00:06Z,Could someone please fix this file to put the tracks in the right order & remove the click/gap btwn USSR & Dear Prudence?.  I've tried on my end but cannot fix it.  Thx
,badlands,2009-09-12T15:33Z,NOT the 090909-released remaster: probably the flat 1987-issue and in pretty bad sound quality as well. The uploader couldn't even get the tracks in the real order...
