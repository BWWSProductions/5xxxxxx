,DikkatDeliVar,2009-09-09T14:00Z,"The warg crack from gamecopyworld enabled me to run the game, however the game crushes after 10 minutes of playing, when a smiling sun-face appears in the midst of the screen. I would assume that I have bad drivers, but the appearance of the strange face in the screen randomly makes me think its rather a bad crack as well :("
,DikkatDeliVar,2009-09-09T15:10Z,"Both cracks from gamecopyworld work fine, the game seems to have a bug which causes the crush."
,CancelForbat,2009-09-12T17:17Z,"""The application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect.""

Get that error message with both cracks"
