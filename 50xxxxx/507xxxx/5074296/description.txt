Slash Maraud was a DC Comics 1987 mini-series written by Doug Moench (Eerie, Batman) and illustrated by Paul Gulacy (Master of Kung Fu, Sabre).

Earth has been invaded and subjugated by The Shapers, fur-covered aliens with the ability to change their shapes, who have completely dismantled all armed resistance. In an attempt to make the world their own, they have undertaken to convert the Earthâ€™s atmosphere into one more to their liking--unfortunately, the result will be the death of all of humanity.  A lone wander, Slash Maraud is reluctantly caught up in a resistance movement to stop the conversion process and overthrow the alien invaders.
