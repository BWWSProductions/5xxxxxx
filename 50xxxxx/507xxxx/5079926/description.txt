The Belgrade Phantom (2009) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810089/

Plot: Using a stolen white Porsche, the Phantom performs daring stunts through the city streets. As rumors of his cat-and-mouse games with the police spread, people start gathering to watch him at night. Over the radio the daredevil publicly challenges the police to try and catch him. Such open opposition is unheard of and more than 10,000 people are in the streets supporting their hero. It is dangerous to eliminate him in front of the public and the police are forced into a chase where he sets the rules. It comes down to the driving, and the stakes are very high.
