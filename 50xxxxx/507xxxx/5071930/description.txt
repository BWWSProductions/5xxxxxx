Mount Fuji

Mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan at 3,776 m (12,388 ft). Along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku, it is one of Japan's "Three Holy Mountains" (Sanreizan). An active volcano that last erupted in 1707â€“08, Mount Fuji straddles the boundary of Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures just west of Tokyo, from which it can be seen on a clear day. 

It is located near the Pacific coast of central Honshu. Three small cities surround it: Gotemba (south), Fujiyoshida (north) and Fujinomiya (southwest). Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone is a well-known symbol of Japan and it is frequently 
depicted in art and photographs, as well as visited by sightseers and climbers.
