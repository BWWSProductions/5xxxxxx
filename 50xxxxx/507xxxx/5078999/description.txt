DJ Kentaro masterfully balances amazing skills on the turntables with a willingness to let the tracks presented to speak for themselves at times.  DJ Kentaro knows when to steamroll and when to coast, but it seems like he's always tweaking things a bit to great effect.  Cuts from these artists; DJ Kentaro, Cold Cut, DJ Food, Cornelius, Jaga Jazzist, Wagon Christ, Animals on Wheels, Clifford Gilberto Rhythm Combination, DJ Vadim, The Herbaliser, Pest, Happy Campers & Funki Porcini, help to bring to life a Hella 55 minute audio injection!

If you like this, you may also like this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5071439/ , as the track by DJ Vadim, 'The Terrorist', is used.

As always, Seed & Enjoy this or any of my other torrents.
