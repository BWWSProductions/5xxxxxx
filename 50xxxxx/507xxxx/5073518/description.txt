It's About Time - Christina Milian [2004]
	


It's About Time is the second studio album by American singer Christina Milian, released by Island Records on 13 July 2004 in the United States. The album served as Milian's debut album in the U.S., partly in due to the September 11 attacks, which occurred just two weeks before the release date of her debut album. For the production of the album, Milian worked with Bloodshy & Avant, Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, Cory Rooney, Warryn Campbell, Bryan Cox and Poli Paul.

The album peaked at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart and number 21 in the United Kingdom, selling a total of 382,000 and 63,708 copies respectively. The album achieved Silver certification in the UK, and received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album. The album's lead single, "Dip It Low", became Milian's most successful to date; peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart and number five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. The second single "Whatever U Want" was less successful, peaking on the UK singles chart at number nine.
