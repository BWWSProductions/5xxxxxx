UNTRUE!
Someone created this damn film, someone created the damn disc inside the box and all the packaging and everything else that goes with creating and distributing a film.
It COSTS some people something and it is not yours to say they deserve nothing for their work!
You are a christian and you are agreeing to this?!
Oh FUCK OFF...
Is this another christian trying to justify an act of apparent Un-christian behaviour>?
I assume that stealing is BAD in the bible. (Actually I KNOW it is, I have read it after all...)
It is funny that no matter how a christian behaves in their life, they will always find a way to justify it and make it sit OK with their beliefs.
The bible says it is wrong to steal. End of.
but the stealing christian will say it is ok for xxx reason. see above in the torrent description.
Sorry christian, you either believe your holy book and abide by it OR you are guilty of cherry picking the parts of the bible you like and can deal with and the other parts that do not fit to your life and the way you wish to live it, are disregarded, like the stealing part.
Hypocrite and thief.
And you call yourself a christian?
Jesus would be turning in his grave.
If he had one.
god will be spinning on his cloud.
If he has one."
