,yobba,2009-09-11T01:22Z,Worst movie EVER! and I made the mistake of beeing a good guy and saw it at the movies...
,twmyers,2009-09-11T01:54Z,"Lmao thanks so much for the rating of the upload extreme, please try EVER watching your own uploads if you are going to try to answer questions.
 There is a counter in the topleft that is blurred out but sound is fine. Another good quality regurgitation."
,kevver,2009-09-11T10:07Z,The AR looks messed up to me. Squashed -->
,Madd_Dowg,2009-09-11T16:14Z,"The aspect ratio is wrong!! Everything is ""squeezed"" together. No Thanks."
,whakapai,2009-09-12T16:42Z,"Worst movie ever?  That's a bit harsh.  You must have only seen 2 movies in your life, this and alien or something.  Have a sweet tea.  Get out more, you'll feel better for it."
,yoncenator,2009-09-13T06:02Z,"I appreciate the upload but why lie? This isn't a DVD screener.  If it has watermarks and screwed aspect ratio its probably a leaked workprint that was quickly (or poorly)  converted to 4:3.

Again thanks, but no thanks."
,Lsnake,2009-09-13T13:51Z,"The picture quality itself isn't bad at all, but the problem is the aspect ratio, which is wrong. It's watchable if you can tolerate it, but I'd recommend waiting. I'm anxious to see this one as well but meh..the aspect ratio ruins it. Otherwise it looks fair enough."
,imerebus,2009-09-13T18:22Z,"widescreen....

thanks max and to all the contributors :)"
,phatcat74,2009-09-14T10:55Z,"This film is a fuckin waste of a time

such a fuckin lame story.

I want my 1.5h wasted life back"
,HeadToe,2009-09-14T20:45Z,"This movie is great, cant speak for the rip, but anyone who says its a sucky movie either hasnt seen it, or is a smidge on the retarded side."
,HeadToe,2009-09-14T20:46Z,"BTW phatcat, try uploading something yourself u worthless leach"
,Lsnake,2009-09-14T21:57Z,"Hmm, I gotta try changing the AR in VLC. I'll see how that works and post another reply."
,Lsnake,2009-09-14T22:15Z,"Yeah, setting the aspect ratio worked wonders. Thanks, really didn't strike my mind."
,shade9912,2009-09-16T08:17Z,thx extremezone.

,Amialis,2009-09-18T12:04Z,If you dont like this movie then you're all movie illiterate. Its supposed to be half retarded...what do you expect from the creator of Evil Dead? This movie is genius.
,HarleenQuinzel,2009-09-25T08:31Z,"I couldn't get the sound to work right but after watching part of a scene involving a talking goat, i lost interest in watching it anyway."
,Esmad3,2009-09-26T19:29Z,@ Amialis: I agree. Some simpletons don't get it. They can go re-watch Spiderman 3. 
,ptv83,2009-12-13T20:50Z,"you can see this movie at an even better website than 'd]a]k]m]o]v]i]e]s]' at '[i][m][a][b][i][g][f][a][t][t][d][o][u][c][h][e][b][a][g]'' 'dot' ''com''
