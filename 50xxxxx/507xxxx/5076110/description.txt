Vulture's second release Easier To Lie is another piece of full-fledged thrashing in all aspects, even though a bit more on the usual side than the band's distinguishable debut. The sound of this album is slightly colder and more typical for the genre than Fatal Games, but it is obvious that the band still had an eye for characteristic songwriting which is supported again by a good stomping sound quality throughout. While the songs may not feature quite the same kind of hooks as on the previous album, Vulture certainly knew how to put enough energy even in basic riffs in such way that the outcome remains pretty effective. Easier To Lie may not be a masterpiece of thrash metal, but it pulls the right strings to eventually win you over.
