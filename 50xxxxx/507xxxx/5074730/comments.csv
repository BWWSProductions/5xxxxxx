,x_torian,2009-09-01T00:22Z,"people talking of viruses..as much as i like sandra, id rather hope a regular posts this...sorry cmpink...no trust here"
,Hydra25,2009-09-01T01:12Z,"jpg's don't have viruses. My Norton frequently dislikes jpg's in torrents while they are downloading, but it finds everything to be fine after they're done. My theory is that if you download a tiny part of the file (because it uses multiple parts) then Norton/AVG etc thinks it's a file that is too small to be real and gets hissyfits."
,tdatb,2009-09-01T09:03Z,"Actually, yes, .jpgs CAN have viruses but no one has really bothered with them for about a decade, now. I wouldn't worry about it."
,mjanes42,2009-09-01T09:30Z,"Thanks, cmpink.

This is probably the very best Sandra set I have ever seen.

Very sexy."
,mojoSS,2009-09-01T10:28Z,"i have never seen a virus in a jpg.....file size is to small.......I think this ia a smuck calling ""wolf"""
,SpanishJeff,2009-09-01T10:39Z,I have been a Sandra fan for many years now but it seems to me as shee gets older the more tame the photo shhots get! This has got to be one of her most boring!
,Theta_Sigma,2009-09-01T10:44Z,"Years ago, during the Windows 98 days, someone figured out how to embed viruses within JPEGs. However, as soon as they figured it out, Micro$oft released an update that made the viruses harmless and incapable of infecting the target machines. That update has been included with every version of Windows since. In other words, A/V scanners can yell JPEG virus all day and it doesn't matter a bit."
,darknessv,2009-09-01T22:56Z,i think she should get nude and show the cohonas
,oddmanoutgt,2009-09-04T06:54Z,Thank U!!!
,elbee1984,2009-09-04T09:44Z,"i think what happens, (not taking apart the anti virus software to confirm this) is that a torrent downloads in parts, creating a file directory (path to the future file) and sometimes header (this file is a jpg or mpg etc) before it fills in the file information (all of 1's and 0's that make the pixels that make the image in this case)  There are however 1's and 0's already in place from whatever file(s) may have existed on that particular piece of hard drive in the past.  So what happens is that there is a directory/header for a file that does not make sense for the format stated, and may be completely random, or may have executable code contained within.   Not only that, but the file is changing rapidly (as the actual file downloads) all of these things should look suspicious to your anti virus software if the software is worth a damn "
