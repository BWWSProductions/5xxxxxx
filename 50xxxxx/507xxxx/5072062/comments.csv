,gallonman,2010-10-24T05:26Z,99% of the clips are BLANK! Tried all types of software to view them. Why?
,clivegfx,2010-12-20T09:36Z,"The clips are not blank...some of the elements are just black instead of white so if you use After Effects just drop it on a background that is any other colour besides black and it will show up. If you want to make the element white just go to saturation and increase the lightness all the way up. Hope that helps! :-)

Thanks very much for the torrents MauiDude! :-)"
