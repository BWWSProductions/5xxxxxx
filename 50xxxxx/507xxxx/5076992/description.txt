In Search of Solid Ground is the second studio album by American rock band Saosin to be released on September 8, 2009. The recording sessions for In Search of Solid Ground saw Saosin recording with multiple producers such as Butch Walker (whom with they recorded five songs), John Feldman, and Lucas from Matt Squire's production team. Five songs off the album will be produced by Beau Burchell and Chris Sorenson of Saosin.

Three of the songs on the album are re-recordings of tracks from The Grey EP (released in late 2008). "I Keep My Secrets Safe" is a re-recording of "Keep Secrets", supposedly with an entirely new chorus. "Why Can't You See?" keeps the title of the song from the EP, and "The Worst of Me" is "Love Maker", the new name taken from a line in the chorus of the song.

The original album artwork was revealed on July 13, 2009 by Alternative Press.[1] The cover was immediately met with a negative reaction from fans causing Saosin to reevaluate their decision two days before the album was pressed. The band tried to create something "high concept" with the original art, but the negative reaction helped the band realize that they "always keep things simple and strong and let the music speak for itself."[2]

The two songs "On My Own" and "Is This Real?" were released as singles on iTunes August 4, 2009. The song "Changing" was released as a single August 11. The song "The Worst of Me" was released as a free song included in a Hurley Warped Tour pack. 30 second previews of each song are avilable on Amazon.com/iTunes.

PacSun is hosting a listening party at 5pm at every PacSun store, to hear the full album on September 7, 2009. The song "Why Can't You See?" was made available on Last.fm. The full album was released in Japan on September 1, 2009.
