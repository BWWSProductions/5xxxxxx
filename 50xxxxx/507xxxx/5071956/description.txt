So Many Ways is a 1996 album by The Braxtons. The Braxtons originally started out in 1989. The first signed as a fivesome to Arista Records which consisted of Toni Braxton and her 4 sisters, Tamar, Trina, Towanda and Traci. In 1990, they released their first single "Good Life". It would be their only single as a foursome. "Good Life" was not a hit and The Braxtons were dropped from Arista Records and even though It wasn't a hit, Toni Braxton's lead vocals caught the attention of Antonio "L.A." Reid and Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds who were in the process of forming LaFace Records and Toni signed as a solo artist. The Braxtons broke up. In 1996, 3 out of the 4 Braxtons, Trina, Tamar and Townada reunited and released their album So Many Ways. The fourth remaining Braxton sister, Traci was not allowed to sign with the group due to her pregnancy at the time. The Braxtons officially disbanded for good after So Many Ways when Tamar Braxton went solo.
