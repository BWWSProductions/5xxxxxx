,IceWolf1102,2009-10-21T21:51Z,"Hey all,

Just a quick explaining to all of those who don't understand on Username/Password thing like aftaab4u.

aftaab4u: in your example you used the site http://stars:planets@247femdom.com/members/ and you was wondering which is what.. well the easiest explanation is that the website is www.247femdom.com and the username is stars and password is planets. This was the old User/Pass system used in all browsers, but now IE has banned that old system and this is why...

On February 2nd, 2004, Microsoft released an update to its Internet Explorer web browser that was included in the Windows Auto-Update. This update effectively DISALLOWED THE INCLUSION OF A WEBSITE'S USERNAME AND PASSWORD in the linking URL. 

Example of Old Link: http://username:password@www.example.com/members/
Clicking on the above URL will now produce an ""INVALID SYNTAX ERROR"" in some versions of Internet Explorer. In other versions, you will not even be able to click on the link.

It is much simpler these days to use Firefox/Chrome/Netscape with these links, but if you use IE still there is a workaround registry patch available that works in re-enabling it: http://www.ultrapasswords.com/IEUserPassEnable.reg 

Hope this has helped some of you get on some sites in the list previously not available :)"
,Uberlegen0403,2009-10-27T19:56Z,"Thanks Harry!

I got to this a bit late since most of the better known sites have blocked the usernames, but I still got into some good sites."

,Jedichiphazard,2009-12-16T03:13Z,"Hi.

,TechnoBanana,2009-12-20T02:10Z,I type in the passwords CORRECTLY tried about 25 of them now but it just does not work and askes me to put them in again :( 
,TechnoBanana,2009-12-20T02:19Z,This is a load of fucking bullshit none of these even work 
,zogulusnig,2009-12-20T07:21Z,"These (a good portion of them, anyways) have worked pretty well for MONTHS.

In case you didn't notice, the file is labeled ""Sept. 5th"".

As such, assume the passwords will work less and less as time passes.  A TON of them still work (as of 12/20/09).  However, a few have been noticed and killed.

Move on to the next batch if these don't work for you.  This is FREE PORN.  I know a ton of you (not all) are pre-adolescent boys.  As such, GET WHAT EVER YOU CAN.  QUIT BITCHING.

When I was your age, I had to travel uphill for twelve miles, in snow 4 feet deep, walking on my hands to find a place to rest.

Enjoy FREE PORN at 10-20 MBbps!"
