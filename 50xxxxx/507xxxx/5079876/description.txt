From imdb.com: 
PompelPompel & Pilt are two unique characters developed for Norwegian television,
and they have scared thousands of innocent kids into their adolescence, 
and have without a shadow of a doubt left deep scars in many a young mind.
Yes, of course they are just dolls, but still ... they are infinitely weird and their surroundings extremely surreal. The point was to make children think for
themselves, and that was probably the result. That and countless nightmares
about the evil janitor, Gorgon! The plot is simple. Pompel & Pilt think of themselves as clever repairmen, like MacGyver, only not equally adept, and the result is always disaster.
