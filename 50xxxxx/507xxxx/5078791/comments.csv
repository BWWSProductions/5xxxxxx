The download version plays on my computer, but alas, when I tried to create a doublelayer DVD copy all I got was audio. I was getting errors from both Convert2DVD on my PC and VisualHub on my Mac. Somethings's screwed up. Perhaps my config, but I have been doing this stuff for over 2 years, ie downloading, converting to DVDs, etc., and this is the first for me. I would rather watch this kind of movie on my TV setup."
