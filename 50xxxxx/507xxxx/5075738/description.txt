Steppin' (2009) [Repost]

Comedy/Music

Unlike most films that chronicle contemporary African-American life which feature one or several recognizable actors 'Steppin' has a cast of 25 of the most popular, highly acclaimed, in demand stars in the industry with exceptional performances in this hilarious romp set on a university campus. The story line unfolds over a several month period in which the "Greeks" (fraternities and sororities) prepare for the culminating event; the step show competition. Against this backdrop there are numerous sub plots involving the meeting and maturation of a love relationship, a kidnapping, an avenging abused co-ed (women in various test audiences actually applauded this scene) fraternity initiation rites, great step scenes, an off the chain sound track and an overall funny take on the antics of students and faculty alike.
