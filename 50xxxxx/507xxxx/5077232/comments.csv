,booboo332,2009-09-04T00:17Z,"Thanks Sig.  I have studied NLP and I am eager to check out the first hour.  While I am not an expert on the topic, I did use related techniques to quit smoking so I have some understanding of their power.

What Tony Robbins is capable of doing to individuals and large crowds with his techniques based on NLP is down right terrifying.  It is brings together what has been learned from sources like Milton Erickson, Noam Chomsky's  ""transformational vocabulary"" and Gestalt therapy.  The first thing that came to mind when I first heard President Obama speak was how much it reminded me of how Robbins addresses his audiences.

This is truly terrifying stuff, especially when you look at the economically fascist moves the government has been making and the cult of personality it is using to get things done.

Educate! Organize! Resist!  ;)

[T],sig_garrett,2009-09-04T19:46Z,"Excellent observations. 

I've been calling the Big O a Hypnotist. Mesmerizing. Simply captivating. I've watched many a friend and family member fall under the spell of confident, eloquent language, calculated pauses and body movement. 

What I keep underscoring is ""equivocation"". What is Said, and how people as individuals internalize it or project upon it are two very different things. People should develop a critical discernment between what is said and what is actually meant. 

People should also strive to understand the origins of things and understand the terms, words, phrases and symbols being used (which requires a little homework). Even watching a hand shake or simple gesture can speak volumes to the initiated, a symbol can speak to the unconcious, etc. 

The listeners here are pretty well clued in and get decent guidance - so we just need to keep spreading the word to reach a basic critical mass for effective change - not the change planned by the financial elite and occult ""hidden hand"" forces."
