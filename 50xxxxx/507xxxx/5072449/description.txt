Get the control of your karaoke show! Siglos Karaoke Pro is a KJ assistant that 
will make your shows better and easier to run. Here is how Siglos Karaoke Pro can 
help you with running your karaoke show:


Use you computer to run your karaoke show. Stop carrying hundreds of discs, 
risking their damage and loss.

Two-screen display with preview window will make running your shows a pleasure, 
and advanced display features will make lyrics look better 

Powerful song database allows to find any song in a matter of seconds 

Automatic singer rotation management keeps singers queue in order; you may add 
new song requests while singers are on stage 

Singer announcement will save you from 'Who is next' questions, and time guide 
will allow to answer 'When will I sing?' questions without thinking about it 

Singer history will save you from typing songs for regulars, and venue filter 
helps when running shows in various places 

Song silence detector automatically removes silence from the beginning and the 
end of the CD+G song, allowing you to squeeze more songs in the show 

Use Key changer to change the key of the song when adding request or when singer 
is already singing 

Use Tempo changer to slow down or speed up the song 

Have your show run in Automatic mode if you are unable to operate the computer 

Play CD+G discs -- if a singer brings his own CD+G disc, just place it in the 
queue and insert when prompted -- the show will go on. 

You do not have to start other players when nobody is singing. Fill-in playlist 
kicks in automatically when the song is stopped and fades away when its time for 
next performance 

If you cannot see the singer's display, use Preview window to see what singer sees 

Use Playlist view to check the actual songs in the queue, instead of seeing the 
rotation order 

Export songs from the database and use it in songbook software, or use a 
spreadsheet program and create the books yourself 

Use rotation presets to preload rotations for frequent singers 



* Siglos Karaoke Professional feature list: 

Advanced karaoke player 
Siglos uses high-quality karaoke player engine that allows to replace solid 
background with images.

Support for various karaoke formats 
Allows to play various karaoke formats, including MP3+G, ZIP, BIN, MIDI Karaoke 
(MID and KAR), KMA. 

Also supports video formats (AVI and MPEG). 
To convert CD+G discs from your collection into digital format you need to use 
Power CD+G Burner 

External screen support 
If your computer supports dual display (most laptop computers do), the program 
window is displayed on your laptop screen, and the karaoke lyrics on the external 
TV screen. You may work with the program while lyrics are being displayed. 

Song database 
Siglos Karaoke Professional has a powerful database build-in. It will scan your 
hard disc, index karaoke songs, and then will provide you with search interface 
to find songs in a matter of seconds.

Singer rotation management 
To run the show in fair way you need to make sure that one person does not sing
more often than the other. To do this Siglos places the singer in the queue, and 
first play one song for each singer before allowing the second round. The order 
of the singers is displayed in the list on the left of the rotation window. 

Singer announcements 
When a singer is about to sing, Siglos displays an introduction screen that shows 
the name of the singer and chosen song.
It also displays a fully customizable scrolling reminder during the performance 
with the name of the next singer. 

Song silence detector 
Many karaoke songs have silence at the beginning and at the end (used usually to 
display CD+G maker's logo). Siglos automatically skips these silent parts, so you 
can play more songs. 

Singer history 
Siglos keeps singer names and songs they sung in the database. So if you have 
regulars on your shows, adding their requests is a matter of several mouse clicks 

Key and tempo changer 
High-quality key changer allows you to adjust the pitch of the song to better suit 
the singer. You may also slow down or speed up the music. Even better, Siglos 
remembers which singer uses which key and tempo modification. 

Fill-in Playlist 
Songs placed in the fill-in playlist are played when nobody is singing. You no 
longer have to switch to CD player or play MP3 using other software -- Siglos 
will do this automatically, fading the music in and out when necessary. 

Preview window 
If singers' screen is placed in a position that you cannot see it, you can use 
Preview window to monitor the lyrics. 

Venue manager 
Siglos allows to tag the singers by the venue name. If you are running shows in 
various places it allows you to filter the singers and songs. 

Automatic mode 
If for some reason you have to leave the show for couple of minutes, Siglos allows 
to put the show on autopilot. It will display singer announcement for defined 
amount of time, and then will start the song. 

Time information 
Rotation list displays when the singer will sing the next time. This information 
is constantly updated. 

Playlist view 
If rotation view does not give you all the information you need, or if you are 
used to work with list of songs rather than the list of singers, you may switch 
to playlist view. 

Promo message 
You may add your message to the scrolling reminder -- it may be used to promote 
your next show, or display other informations. 

CD+G disc playback 
If a singer asks you to play a song from his CD+G disc, simply select Add CD+G 
disc track, choose the number of the track, and you will be prompted to insert 
the disc at the appropriate time.
Siglos does not copy the songs from customer's discs to the hard disc, as it is 
illegal. 

Export song list 
You may export the songs from the database to CSV or XML file, and then use it to 
create a songbook.
You may use a dedicated songbook software, or use a spreadsheed program (like free 
Calc from OpenOffice) to create the songbook yourself. 

Siglos Karaoke Professional comes with per-user license. It does not have 
activation dongles nor requires internet connection. If you own two computers 
you may install it on both, providing you are the only user of the program.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of 
    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting 
    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz
    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!
  
08- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

10- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by 
   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
