Meet a fashion junkie who spends over $1 million on clothes â€” a year! And even more 

spectacular than his wardrobe? A house that's dangerously designed. Joan also meets 

a man with money up the wazooâ€¦ from an invention unappealingly called Butt Paste. 

Next up is the show's youngest millionaire, who snuggles up with the money he made 

from putting arms on a blanket and calling itâ€¦ The Slanket. Snuggie whaaa? Plus: a 

couple so broke they served pizza at their wedding. Now theyâ€™re worth billions. 

BILLIONS! How did they get so rich?!
