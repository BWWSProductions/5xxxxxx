,Kookie1985,2010-11-03T19:59Z,"I need a bit of help concerning the software. 

It installed perfectly.... the serial generator works and all but a message pops up every now and then and I dunno what to do about it.

""FontTool.exe stopped working""

I uninstalled the software (and deleted all preferences left on window) and re-installed it but the same problem occurs.

Does someone has an idea how to get rid of this ?

,Kookie1985,2010-11-03T20:03Z,"Got a problem with this software. Keygen and software installed ok but I keep getting the warning ""FontTool.exe stopped working"" and dunno what to do with it.

I've re-installed the software and all but so far no change. It allows me to use the thing, don't know if it blocks any function yet, but it's annoying as hell.

Anyone has an idea what to do with this ?
