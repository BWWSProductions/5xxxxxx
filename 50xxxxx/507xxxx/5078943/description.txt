    * Greg debates the viciousness of the Stern Fan Network and questions
      why the most hateful people spew their venom on a website dedicated
      to everything Howard Stern.  It's the typical Fitz show with many
      topics.

      G4's Chris Hardwick stops by whom you may know from his most recent

      both air on the G4 network.  Chris also is a stand up comedian and has
      many stories from his life.
