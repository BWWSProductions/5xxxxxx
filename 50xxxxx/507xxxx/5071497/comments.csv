I tried to watch it, but the counter and popups were too distracting. I'm going to try to hold out for an R5.

Of course none of that is your fault. Its a good screener rip that has unfortunately been dicked up by the studio so that people like me can't properly enjoy it. The fucked up part is I gladly would have paid to see this but it never opened around here..."
