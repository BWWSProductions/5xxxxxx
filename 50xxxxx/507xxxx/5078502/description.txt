Ever since Sony and Crackle decided to be total assholes and to block Penn Says from the entire world (except the USA), people have been having trouble accessing the videos. So I did something about it.

This is all the Penn Says You.Tube videos, painstakingly downloaded by me from You.Tube through a proxy, and numbered for your convenience. It is up-to-date as of September 4, 2009. Now you can get ALL the past videos at once, without any hassle. Or you can get only the specific ones you want. Enjoy!

Note: This has only the Penn Says videos from the You.Tube channel. There are more on crackle dot com, but they are not in this torrent. I don't know how to download/sort through those.

I tried uploading this before, but I didn't realize how crippled my internet connection was at the time. And yes, I did add the videos that came between then and now. Please seed after you download! Thanks! 

By the way, what the FUCK is up with the censoring of the word "You.Tube" (if entered without the dot in the middle). That is fucking retarded.
