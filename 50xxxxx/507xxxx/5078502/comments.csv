[T],skJGZV6z,2009-11-16T22:07Z,"hamstur, found out that crackle.com allows limited downloading of video content for PSP devices. It seems Penn Says is eligible:

feed URL:
http://crackle.com/rss/psp.ashx?fx=&fcx=120&fp=1&fc=52

portal URL:
http://www.crackle.com/psp

Perhaps this may help with a follow-up torrent. "
