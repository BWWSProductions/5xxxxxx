Perhaps the most respected voice in the world of sports broadcasting, Jim Rome is the leading opinion-maker of his generation. As host of the nationâ€™s premiere sports radio talk show, Rome is known for his aggressive, informed, rapid-fire dialogue. Jim has established himself as the top choice of athletes and fans when it is time to know what is going on beyond the scoreboard.

Romeâ€™s nationally syndicated radio program, The Jim Rome Show, a.k.a. The Jungle, airs on more than 200 radio stations each weekday and boasts more than two million listeners. But these are no ordinary listeners; they are a legion of fans known as the clones who live and breathe for Jim Romeâ€™s â€œtakeâ€ on the dayâ€™s larger issues of sport. It is his departure from conventional sports commentary that has resulted in Romeâ€™s unique dialogue with his listeners.

In addition to his daily radio grind, Rome returned to ESPN to host Jim Rome Is Burning, a daily, provocative sports talk show airing at 4:30p.m. EST. The program originates from Los Angeles and features opinion, Romeâ€™s â€œrants,â€ debate and guest appearances by some of the biggest name in sports.

Rome has made a cameo appearances along side Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey in Two For The Money, with Adam Sandler in The Longest Yard and opposite Michael Jordan in Space Jam; appeared in Blink 182â€™s music video; appeared on HBOâ€™s â€œArliss;â€ and released a CD, Welcome to the Jungle, which features memorable sound bites from frequent callers and the hip music regularly used on the radio show.

Rome previously served as host of the popular program The Last Word with Jim Rome, broadcast nightly on Fox Sports Net, for five years. Prior to The Last Word with Jim Rome, Jim spent a two-year stint hosting ESPN2â€™s Talk2, a nightly one-hour interview show. Rome began his radio career at KTMS, Santa Barbara as the â€œ$5 dollar-an-hourâ€ traffic reporter and covered UC Santa Barbaraâ€™s sports. He left KTMS for San Diegoâ€™s all-sports station, XTRA Sports 690. It was during a temporary stint on a late-night show for the station that Rome debuted his â€œsmackâ€ (Jungle Glossary term meaning sports talk in a gloating, uninhibited or unbridled manner). The style yielded high ratings, and, by acclimation of his listeners, The Jungle was born. In 1996, to further keep up with demand, Premiere Radio Networks acquired exclusive syndication rights and the program continues to pick-up affiliates throughout the country.
