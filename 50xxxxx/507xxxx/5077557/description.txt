Once in awhile an album comes along that blows your mind and this for me is one of those. This is Cal Tjader Live and at his best. Each performance is a Master Class. ~ Ed Bogas

A 1972 live set, Live at the Funky Quarters is every bit of its time: Cal Tjader's vibraphone is supported by Al Zulaica's electric piano and John Heard's Jaco Pastorious-style bass-as-lead-instrument, giving the whole thing a fusiony sheen that will be the dealbreaker for many listeners. Those not constitutionally averse to early-'70s fusion will find much to enjoy here, however, as Tjader plays with his usual grace and fluidity, and Zulaica's electric piano solos are refreshingly free of Chick Corea-style overplaying. The jazz-rock-inflected reworkings of earlier Tjader favorites like "Manteca" and "Soul Sauce III" -- which features an amazing extended percussion breakdown section buoyed by Heard's rubbery bassline -- work surprisingly well, and newer material like "Philly Mambo" and the delicate allad "Mother and Child" is well-suited to the players' strengths. Most of this album can be found on the CD two-fer Descarga, but that release deletes a funky version of Tjader's tune "Theme," so true fans will want to search for the original vinyl. ~ Mog.Com
