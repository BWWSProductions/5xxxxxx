Sorry."
[M],DeeLee,2009-10-09T23:23Z,"And start SEEDING after download, I have uploaded 1 TB of this torrent now and I wont keep it alive much longer. Its still quite badly seeded.

Its YOUR loss if you cant download it anymore."
,ElDonBarto,2009-10-17T10:46Z,"Thx, I've been waiting for this torrent... unfortunately I live in Belgium where there is no unlimited download ( I only get 25gigs a month) so I can't really seed a lot.

Hopefully some people can enjoy the stupid adventures of these girls and see the beauty of this series as a antropologic, social experiment. 

Keep an open mind..."
,cabbagesprouts,2010-01-16T09:15Z,"Well I live in Romania, so I'll seed this thing FOREVER once I download it.  Hat tip to ElDonBarto, I love this show precisely for the same reason!"
,frankieconrad,2010-12-22T23:21Z,Is there a way to get this on your iPod??
,argonunya,2011-05-19T04:28Z,"Many thanks.  I can't believe that I like this show, but I do."
,xtyrasage,2011-06-01T10:45Z,"This downloaded pretty quickly, I'm seeding now and will continue. I try to to seed to a ratio of 2 for everything I download. 

This show is so funny!"
,imanson,2011-06-25T20:41Z,Is there a reason why I can't watch the season 1 ?
,tompea123,2011-08-17T03:35Z,"Thank you so much for upload. I was wondering if you could help me, when I play the second episode of the first series it says 'your player is broken or cannot play due to unexpected error'. Also, when I play the episodes the image sometimes freezes but the audio doesn't, this happens at 10 second intervals every 1-2 minutes. "
,tompea123,2011-08-17T13:41Z,Nevermind all problems are fixed :)
