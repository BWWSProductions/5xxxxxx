[T],eddie1969,2009-08-29T21:30Z,"All of the pirate bay trackers are playing up at the moment. This is why, as I write, there are no seeders/leachers showing up at all on any newer uploads.

If you use utorrent as you torrent client application then make sure that DHT, Peer Exchange and Local Peer Discovery are all enabled and that way you should have no troubles.

I have edited some of the torrents by going to torrenteditor.com to replace the piratebay trackers with others which are actually working so this may help."
