This is in handheld only because it will play on iPod devices.  This is however of the highest quality and at the same resolution as NTSC DVD.  Do not skip over this because it is labeled iPod.  This is as good as it gets in Standard Definition.

Notes:

* Tested on Xbox 360 (jpg is included because Xbox 360 display these).

* This is encoded in Apple's iPod NTSC DVD format (720x480).  Believed to work on these models: iPod Nano (3rd & 4th gen), iPod touch (1st & 2nd gen), iPhone (1st gen, 3g, 3gs) and iPod classic.  I have only personally tested on iPod Classic and iPod touch 1st and 2nd gen.  So basically this "should" work on all iPods but the 5th gen and 5.5 gen.

Want to watch on the big screen?

Here are few ways to do that:


1) Use an Apple AV cable with your iPod device.  Check the description to make sure the cable works with your iPod.  I don't recommend the old iPod photo cable as it doesn't come with a charger device also.  The other 2 cables let you charge your iPod while watching TV so that your battery doesn't die midway ;-)

4) Play using your Xbox 360 or PS3 either by hooking a USB device to your console or streaming the media to it using software such as TVersity or uShare for Linux.
