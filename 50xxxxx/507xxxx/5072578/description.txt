With Michael Cretu as soul inspiring, Seven Lives Many Faces is their seventh album and a new chapter in their particular creative universe. There are 12 songs that surpass the boundaries of the known sound spectrum, broadening the horizon to create a world acoustic sound omnicultural. The album's first single, the song Seven Lives, was the official theme song of Germany in the last Summer Olympics.
