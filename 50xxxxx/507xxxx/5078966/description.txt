"Dogon is Paul Godwin and Miguel Noya. They are master manipulators and sound designers. The Sirius Expeditions (1998) is a set of playful and eclectic sound constructions. Godwin and Noya use many methods of sound creation and several unidentifiable vocal samples. They surround those samples with a heavy bassline, hi-tech rhythms, and spacious atmospheres to forge a unique sound. This totally original e-music is way out beyond the beyond. Their cover version of Pink Floyd's 'Fat Old Sun' defies description. This disc will appeal to serious e-music collectors; casual fans will like it, but it is not essential." ~ Jim Brenholts, All Music Guide 

This exists elsewhere on TPB, but it is not seeded.  If you like this, you may also like this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5071439/ , as the track 'Pah' is used in it.

Apologies for the cover art, but I have not found a better copy and do not possess a scanner.  If you can share better cover art w/me, that would be grand.

As always, Seed & Enjoy this or any of my other torrents,
