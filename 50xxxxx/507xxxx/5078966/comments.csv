,Xerok80,2009-11-18T22:59Z,"Oh no - what is an M4A file?? (Sorry if that's a stupid question, it's just that I've never encountered it before and have nothing in my arsenal of toys that wants to work with it.)
Do you have any suggestions about how I might convert this to either MP3 or OGG format?"
,Xerok80,2009-11-20T08:57Z,"Nevermind. I've done some reading and found out that Foobar2000 and LAME (both of which I already have) can be used to convert this format to MP3 - I didn't know Foobar could even do that - Duh!! M4A is okay (IF you do the iPod/iTunes thing) but those of us with real MP3/OGG players need the more standard format(s). Sadly, converting from one lossy format to another kind of sucks. BUT these tunes are awesome, dude, and I'm happy as heck to have found them. THANK YOU for sharing this!! You can count on me seeding for quite some time. =)"

Glad you found a way to convert & enjoy."
