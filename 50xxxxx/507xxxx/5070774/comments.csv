[T],netviper,2009-08-30T00:41Z,"@big_dad_e - I spoke with the source of these GB caps, and he only has time to do Beck each night. Seems like it takes him a couple of hours to edit, convert, and package (for usenet) these shows. I'm hoping to work something out with him to take some of the load off him, possibly to have him ftp me raw DVR'd shows and I can do the capping, editing, and AVI conversion. That way perhaps we could get a couple other shows. 

I'd do it all myself but I refuse to pay Time Warner for one TV channel that I would watch :-("
