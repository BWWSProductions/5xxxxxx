[T],bitpirate,2009-08-30T13:33Z,downloaded from the net and rebuild into a blueray file
,540p,2009-08-30T22:51Z,"Do you know what the original source is? Is this from a European H.264 broadcast? How is the video bitrate so high, and where is the 1536 Kb/s DTS track from?"
,540p,2009-08-30T22:53Z,"Also, if this is as good as the description implies, please seed! :)"
,fatmanskoo,2009-08-31T00:51Z,please tell me it's not the special edition
,540p,2009-08-31T04:37Z,It will always be the 2004 special edition if it's in HD. (aka the 3rd version for the DVD) The best version of the original is the letterbox-format laserdisc (or the DVD ripped from it)
[T],bitpirate,2009-08-31T15:32Z,No more info then written into this post buddy. I got it from a private tracker.
,540p,2009-10-05T04:26Z,"WARNING: This is a modified version of the film. It is not the same as any of the 3 official releases of ""A New Hope"" (the 1977, 1997, and 2004 editions). It seems that the editor decided to take a new 20th Century Fox logo sequence from another 1080p movie (not even a newer Star Wars movie) and also replaced the opening crawl music with that from one of the prequels (most likely ""Revenge of the Sith""). There could be other changes as well. The audio has been re-encoded at a higher bit-rate than the best known source, probably to preserve the new Fox logo sequence's audio taken from another film. The video quality is only slightly better than the ~9 GB 23.976 fps versions which are more true to the original film. Until the creators of this version step forward to explain themselves, steer clear of this release."

We have some anal motherfuckers up in here. These are simply here to hold us over until the real blurays hit. Seriously, who fucking cares?"
