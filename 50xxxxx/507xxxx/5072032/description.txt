This is Episode #2 of the A-Game.US podcast series. A-game focuses on dating/pickup advice and has started to release a bunch of free podcasts that should give anyone good tips on how to improve their game.

What I really like about this is the fact that it is broken down into details while at the same time leaving out all the bullshit the other guys are doing on their podcasts to make it artificially longer.

Oh and well, if you have ever heard of a Skype program or COC, well then I hope you did not waste your hard earned cash on this shit because these A-Game podcasts are free and offer better information than the one you get from the other rip-off companies!

Oh, and well, you just can't beat free :D
