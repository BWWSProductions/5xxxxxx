,Dreamtz,2011-02-01T17:17Z,Why do all your fucking torrents have foreign hardcoded subtitles and you don't say anything about it in the title or the description? FUCK YOU. 
,hakuna_matata,2011-02-13T15:44Z,"Atleast someone did a good work at ripping. There are stupid 7.5gb torents where as this one is such a nice rip. small and great.

i wish someone has done same thing for Season 4 & 5 as well.. I hope Riddler do it.

@Dreamtz  you can just look around .. just press a few keys and clicks. the subtitles are available everywhere. dont be stupid. if you write bad things then why dont you do it urself.
as for ur stupid subtitles here. http://subscene.com/english/alias--third-season/subtitle-113279.aspx But give a try Ripping one DVD, try to put it under that size limit with a better quality and uploading it for 4 years first then start judging people. Jerk!"
