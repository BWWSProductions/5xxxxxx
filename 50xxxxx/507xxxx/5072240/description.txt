Whether you want to optimize your system performance or cleanse fragmentation collected in your system with as little effort as possible, Magic Memory Optimizer is the tool of choice. No other program is as feature-rich, yet as easy to use as Magic Memory Optimizer.

Magic Memory Optimizer is designed to tackle difficult but crucial problems of memory management. Memory is the most precious resource in your computer; when it becomes low, your computer will slow down severely or crash. Windows doesn't handle your memory properly by itself. Over time, no matter how much memory you have, Windows will slowly lose memory, bringing you to a critical state. Magic Memory Optimizer solves these problems by reclaiming lost memory for your programs.
