,Masterhunter,2009-08-31T06:44Z,took some time !! seed pleas !!!
,niyo331,2009-08-31T06:47Z,Thank You!
,Lone2000,2009-08-31T06:49Z,"why mp4? avi is the way to go... whatever, thanks for finally coming through."
,Bullbits,2009-08-31T06:50Z,"I'll give it a whirl, but I gotta express my skepticism. Despite VIP status... First TB torrent, MP4 format. Feels Fishy, gotta wonder whats holding up xsaimex or eztv who've been like clockwork for the last 3 months."
,Goblin77,2009-08-31T06:54Z,MP4 Sucks. Definitely waiting for EZTV. 
,pistacio,2009-08-31T06:55Z,@Bullbits my thoughts exactly. i'm taking a chance though. the streams for this show are always choppy & lag like crazy. the one i watched this week cut off with damn near 10 minutes left in the show.
,ahalheru,2009-08-31T06:56Z,"ya, I'll wait for ez-tv"
,Lone2000,2009-08-31T06:59Z,"downloading now at 1Mb/s, piss poor slow. i will let you freaks know how it is when I finish."
,Bullbits,2009-08-31T07:00Z,Little more hopeful as I did a little research and it looks like a possible source is a very good uploader on another site (37+ratio).
,Lone2000,2009-08-31T07:03Z,@bullbits: so who is it man ? give up the info.
,pistacio,2009-08-31T07:08Z,no seeds and 355/1148 (and counting) peers. lovely
,thadarkfigure315,2009-08-31T07:08Z,who cares true blood aired hrs ago EZTV usually has it posted by now i'll down load this til Eztv get his head outta his ass
[S],B.S.O.D,2009-08-31T07:08Z,"the scene never pre'd it, this is an amature rip from some p2p kiddie off demonoid"
,Masterhunter,2009-08-31T07:14Z,So is this torrent good or bad?
,mattfca,2009-08-31T07:15Z,no seeds and 2500 peers. i'd say its fake
,Procrasturbate,2009-08-31T07:17Z,"by the time you fucks write your little bitchpost and wait for a response, you could have downloaded the thing and see for yourself. lazy pirate = butt pirate. "
,Bullbits,2009-08-31T07:22Z,"@Lone, The Mod hit the nail on the head. I wasn't trying to hide anything just didn't wanna advertise a competitor outta respect. The guy on Demonoid has a rip for each episode in MP4 and a great seed ratio. That's all I know for sure, as for quality... no telling till it finishes."
,Goblin77,2009-08-31T07:23Z,"""no seeds and 2500 peers. i'd say its fake"" - mattfca 

the reason it shows 0 seeders is because the tracker is down and it's not registering the people who are seeding. check the forums, there's a couple threads about it."
,laurfer,2009-08-31T07:28Z,fake!  don't do it!
,ludedude,2009-08-31T07:54Z,"I saw this comment re: this torrent on demonoid:


""is it me or is this actually grateful Dead clip...just tried to play and saw Jerry on my VLC player...go figure....True Dead""

Who knows..."
,shup_ho,2009-08-31T07:57Z,lude your lan player associated it with another file you've downloaded so thats why you saw the dead vid. this is stuck at 2 hrs at 150kb/s it better be real. f@#k i need a damn television
,ludedude,2009-08-31T08:02Z,"@ shup_ho

That wasn't my comment. I cut/pasted it from the message thread from demonoid where this was originally posted.

FWIW the OP at demonoid has lots of True Blood episodes posted, mostly in mp4 format. I'd say this is legit...just in a shitty format.

That said, no disrespect intended to the ripper/poster. I appreciate the effort."
,Lone2000,2009-08-31T08:02Z,"@Bullbits, no worries man, i thought you were saying you knew of another source, i didnt know you were talking about this guy. and as for not mentioning someone out of respect, we are one for all and all for one, no need to hold back some intel. arghhhh. 

and i didnt understand the mod anyway... was he endorsing the Up, or demeaning Poophead5... ?? 

im at like 50% and creeping at 10Kb/s to 1Mb/s. this could take hours. come on open up the bandwidth matey.

anyone use VLC to bootleg pay per view ? Im looking for good streams for UFC fights. anyone have a good library of VLC streams for a fellow Apple Mac user?"
,Psychokinesis,2009-08-31T08:16Z,Works fine. Thanks.
,Elohim99,2009-08-31T08:37Z,"Works fine, just use VLC retards"
,shup_ho,2009-08-31T09:26Z,"thx poophead5, perfecto"
,Sirreal420,2009-08-31T09:47Z,stuck at 97.7%
,TridenTBoy,2009-08-31T09:50Z,"Well, it's the real deal... The quality isn't superb though for the resolution... It's really high res, but not that great."
,TridenTBoy,2009-08-31T09:56Z,That took WAY TOO LONG.
,Lone2000,2009-08-31T09:59Z,"i can confirm this is good !

A=10
V=10

will seed unlimited for 2 hours starting now.

thanks poophead5"
,vag_of_doom,2009-08-31T10:14Z,buahahaha! ze true blood OF DOOM is MINE! thanks poophead5.
,niyo331,2009-08-31T10:15Z,Damn! didnt know it was high res. My comp couldnt take it. I'll just wait till the crappier version comes out. Thanks again!
,KatushkaK,2009-08-31T10:17Z,"OK guys, I get the sound but I'm stuck with ""HBO entertainment"" the whole 52 minutes... Used VLC to play it, tried even Quick time and WMP... Can someone help me please?"
,felixkry,2009-08-31T10:21Z,"This is the real deal. HD though, it stutters on my netbook if I don't use Plex so I'll pop it in my PS3.

A=10
V=10
Playability on sucky hardware=1"
,wabstar,2009-08-31T11:57Z,"Poophead, thank you very much for your terrific upload!!
Downloaded the torrent in about 60 minutes, and played perfectly on VLC :)"
,Mauiwowi,2009-09-04T21:49Z,"Hey guys, this torrent has 0 seeders and I'd love to see it.  Somebody help?"
,Neeros,2010-07-08T23:10Z,How can this be real when the episode doesn\'t even air till the 11th?
,Grimm2840,2011-09-05T03:43Z,Is this the newest episode that was on tonight?
