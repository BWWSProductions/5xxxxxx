SOS_Tokyo_Metro_Explorers_The_Next_(2007)
Even though I am an anime fan, I have to admit that I was initially wary of a 40 minute film with a bizarre title like 'SOS! Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next'. From the plot summary on the back cover, I expected a typically trite fantasy in which a group of children stumble across whatever magical kingdom, mythical world, or incredible creatures the filmmakers could toss on the screen. The confusing title alone was enough to stir up some serious doubt. The only thing that really gave me pause was the involvement of legendary writer/director Katsuhiro Otomo ('Akira,' 'Steamboy'). Loosely based on a short manga by Otomo himself, this pseudo-sequel follows the misadventures of a ragtag band of young explorers in the sewers of Tokyo.

Dont worry about the file size. The quality of video is astonishing. It is crystal clear. The audio is definite plus for this movie.Surround sound is excellently used.
Commentary track is also provided. But it is just use less cause it is not supported by any subs. But still its given.
Do remember "there are no bad apples here"
