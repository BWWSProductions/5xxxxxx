Check http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0831888/ for details of this anime. It got a rating of 7.6/10.
I liked the video of this movie very much. There are very few movies with this kind of colour pallet. Check the included pics to get an idea of the video.
The audio is very much impressive. You will surely like this.
As far as story is concerned, you just cant imagine such a story unless in this movie. The most impressive movie which really supports the story which i think is 6/10
{STORY : Black and White are two orphans who roam the streets of Treasure Town, beating down any thug or yakuza who gets in their way. When mysterious foreign entrepreneurs appear with the intention of tearing down Treasure Town and replacing it with an amusement park, Black and White face their greatest adversaries yet. It is up to the destructive Black to save the fate of the city and up to the gentle White to save Black from his own dark nature}
As far as video and audio goes : Very Impressive
After watching the highly detailed video, you will sigh with satisfaction.
Most important : This movie is highly compressed cause there really is no need to increase size as long as the result is impressive
