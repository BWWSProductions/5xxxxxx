,Bleamix,2009-09-07T06:13Z,Thanks uploader. I don't see why this game is that great. But I'll add it to my collection.
,Neuro_Belmont,2009-09-09T09:54Z,"How can a Wii game be compressed down to 600MB?
Can someone please confirm this works?"

,fab80,2010-01-03T00:38Z,"If it doesn't work and you didn't use imgburn to burn the DVD, give it  try. It solved my problem. I was burning with Nero btw. Also use Verbatim DVD-R for burning (well, I guess you know that)"
,trom2004,2010-01-11T17:17Z,Works great on Hardmod Wii! NTSC
,Edi2k10,2010-01-14T16:04Z,THX!!!!!
,timothycharran,2010-02-10T19:01Z,I burnt this twice using Imgburn at 2x and normally other isos work but this one for some reason isn't and I have a hard mod for NTSC...it's so frustrating
,GohdaMotohide,2010-04-10T16:57Z,"Doesn't work for me, I've burned it like 3 different times now, each time the Wii BSoDs."

Now seeding. ;)"
,TheFesta,2011-06-16T10:25Z,"Wow, a 4.6gb file compressed to under 650mb and it all un-zipped/rar'd fine, if this is possible why dont more people do it? it seems like it would make things easier for all parties involved! uploaders please take note : )"
,aeoLo,2012-07-20T16:44Z,"It worked perfectly!
Even better than my original (which stopped working).
I looked in several stores but found none, the solution was to download here!
I love you guys!"
