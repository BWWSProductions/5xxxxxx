I mean.. there were a couple of teens in here who should consider cutting down on porn, and some that really should reconsider their entire view on sex and porn.. but some of the examples they have here are really.. inverted extremes.. teens are SUPPOSED to have an extreme curiosity for sex, and if they DIDN'T feel a pull towards watching sexuality it would be evidence of an unhealthy fear..

Also it's only when you take the result from surveys you could find out that women/girls are less interrested in porn.. the only survey I have heard that actually CHECKED the conditions rather than ASK for them it was proven that there were (slightly) more females looking on internet porn than men.. females are trained from young age to hide their sexuality so OFCOURSE when asked they say they wouldn't have any interrest in porn."

Are you serious? Have you been to England?"

(XD>  I absolutely LOVE BBC documentaries!  This is worth the DL just for the entertainment value!"
