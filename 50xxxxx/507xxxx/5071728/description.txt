Miss Universe Pageant 2009

This was originally posted on Usenet, alt.binaries.multimedia.chinese, though it is in English. This is a 720x480 60 Hz (NTSC) DVD encoding in ISO format, apparently from a TS HDTV master. Also included is a DVD cover image. After downloading, either burn to DVD-5 or mount the ISO and play. I spot checked it and video and sound quality seems very good (for DVD.)
