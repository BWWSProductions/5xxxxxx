,omegaviper,2009-09-04T17:23Z,why are there no seeds for this or any other torrent on here? will there be seeds later? why are people uploading torrents if there is constantly no seeds? and I tried to search on Google for the reason behind this and nothing of significance comes up.
,Sheeps42,2009-09-04T17:45Z,yea i was wondering the same thing the past couple weeks have been like this but it will still let you dl it fast
,phil286,2009-09-05T09:11Z,"piratebay is hosting torrent files, but not monitoring trackers to avoid further prosecution would be my guess"
,samkatta,2009-09-05T21:24Z,"I'm not able to download this torrent or any of the torrent files. It gives me ""file not found"".
Is pirate bay down?"
