,Packyman,2009-09-03T20:02Z,awesome. thanks for this post!
,AdamKski,2009-09-12T05:00Z,"This version has pops and clicks as does the other 320 version here. This one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5080425/Porcupine_Tree_-_The_Incident_(2009)_(without_clicks) appears clean.

Can't wait to see them next week here in Seattle!"
,givrix,2009-09-24T23:57Z,"This version doesn't have only clicks but the first track of the second disc has the four tracks of the cd in this order : 04 - 01 - 02 - 03
Flicker should be only 3:42 long.
I advise everyone the flac version then convert it tho mp3 if you like or buy ;)
It's a great album by the way !"
,GubbenIGruvan,2009-09-25T19:14Z,"Bad version, loads of clicks (Not too bad but still a bit irritating)
and as said earlier, failure on Flicker. It's a lot shorter, this version contains all the other songs on the disc for some reason."
,GubbenIGruvan,2009-09-25T19:15Z,"There's a better version wich it says ""(Without clicks)"" on that works just fine."
,bluecar5556,2011-06-10T02:37Z,"that is totally digital distortion, please remove this torrent.  Audiophiles will almost pay you to."
