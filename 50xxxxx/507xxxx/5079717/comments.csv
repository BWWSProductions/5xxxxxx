In some cases it's not good enough legibility to read but may be useful for reference if you don't mind straining your eyes a bit. I suppose it has archival value too because many of these books may never be available in hardcopy print again. There's also a lot that is NOT here, of importance, so this isn't a panacea for chess book lovers - just another possible alternate source."

I was searching for a DjVu reader but was impressed to see that you've included it in the torrent itself.

More thanks.. :D"
