A Huge Collection Of Over 500 Chess Books

Own the most complete chess library on the net.

The collection is in PDF and DJVU formats

I have included Foxit (way better than adobe) and DJVU viewers. (You can download your own versions of these programs if you don't trust these. They are free)

I have included a text index.

5 or 6 of the books are in Russian.

This is a worthwhile torrent to keep alive considering it can all fit on a single DVD, and one needn't spend ages finding individual books. 

......so PLEASE SEED UNTIL 2019!
