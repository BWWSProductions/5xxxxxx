Seeds 0 (0)

Availability: 0,799... "
,Profoss,2009-09-02T14:02Z,"Still stuck at 79%. Are you planning on coming back, like ever? "
,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-09-04T02:34Z,"Sorry, I'm getting my other computer repaired. That should be done very soon, so keep on the lookout for me."
,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-09-04T03:37Z,"O.K. I got my computer fixed, now I'm seeding at 100kb/s+."
,Profoss,2009-09-04T17:17Z,"..but apperently left again? Stuck at 91% now with no seeders and 16 (41) peers, heh.. this is getting rather tedious."
,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-09-04T22:29Z,I'm sorry. My Internet is used by over 10 computers so if i seed for too long my internet crashes for some strange reason... I'm going to have to limit it to 30-50kb/s...
,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-09-05T01:57Z,"Tracker Update:

12 Seeds
12 Peers
Currently nobody is downloading from my connection, so no kb/s reading at the moment."
,Profoss,2009-09-15T17:25Z,"Hello again, I hope you still read these comments, 'cause I have a question: 

Following your install instructions, the game should just be started as normal after you have installed it and restarted the comp once. However, after I have done exactly that, when clicking the .exe the game just searches for the CD in my acutal CD-drive and not the deamon tools drive emulated play disc. 

Is there some way I can ""tell"" the game to look for the play disc in another drive or will it always assume that D: is the CD-drive?"
,Profoss,2009-09-15T17:29Z,"I think I may have been to hasty with my last comment, apperently the game is not only looking in the D: cd-drive, it only did the first time around. Now that I click the exe-file, I get a little icon of a spinning CD-disc, and the nothing happens. Exactly nothing. I can hear my HDD spinning for a while, and then it stops and the game is not started. "
,Profoss,2009-09-15T17:33Z,"Hehe, sorry for spamming comments, but after a few more tries, this warning poped up:

""Unable to authenticate original disc within time limit""

The mouse pointer is now stuck as a 'spinning CD-disc'. "
,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-09-16T18:22Z,"Well then, try these two methods:

Go to My Computer\CD Drive (PowerISO): TOEE_PLAY double click on that CD Image and it should work.

OR

Burn to a RW disc."
,RaitoKunRyuk,2009-09-24T23:36Z,You are posting a link to your torrent on mine WHY?
,nickguyatt,2009-10-12T09:41Z,"I get the same problem as Profoss. I get the spinning disc and then nothing! And I tried going to my computer hitting the cd image there, same problem :("
,nickguyatt,2009-10-12T12:01Z,Right I've solved that problem. For anyone with the same problem the solution is to simply get a No-CD hack. Game then works perfectly. You can google the hack or simply go here: http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=3054
