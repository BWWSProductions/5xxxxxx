FYI - For some reason TPB does not seem to report the seeders/leechers right from the tracker I am using (tracker.publicbt.com). So when you see 0 seeders there are seeders they just aren't showing up in the stats here.

The 08-26-09 episode has 76 right now and shows that correctly on mininova. 

anyhow just wanted to give that little update.
