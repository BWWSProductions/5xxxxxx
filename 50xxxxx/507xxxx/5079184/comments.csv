Please seed. I see this is not your first torrent, but I haven't seen a seed since you first upped it. You know you have to download the torrent from here, right? 

Thanks again."

,KuriousG,2011-01-18T14:31Z,"My ESET antivirus kept deleting it after trying to download twice. Since this has never ever happened with a video file in the past, I don't trust it.

Download at your own discretion."
,korpen,2012-03-24T10:03Z,"thanks, just a pity this isn't deinterlaced, which means it really looks crap in scenes with sudden movements :("
