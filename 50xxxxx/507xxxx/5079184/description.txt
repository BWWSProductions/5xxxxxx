Cries and Whispers (Swedish: Viskningar och rop, literally "Whispers and Cries") is a 1973 Swedish film about two sisters who watch over their third sister on her deathbed, torn between fearing she might die and hoping that she will. The film was written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. It stars Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann.

Unlike most of Bergman's films, Cries and Whispers uses saturated colour, especially crimson. For his work on this film, Sven Nykvist won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and the film was also nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Director, and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced. Unusually for a foreign language film, it was also nominated for Best Picture, not for Best Foreign Language Film.
