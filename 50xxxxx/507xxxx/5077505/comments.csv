I couldn't find it.

Other than that you have made a great torrent. Thanks"
,Mister_Fabulous,2009-09-13T10:46Z,"Yeah, sorry dude. That was tucked away in another folder and didn't make it into the torrent. I can just put it in a later release I guess."
,nickguyatt,2011-08-01T15:08Z,"Good torrent, good content."

,voraxith,2011-10-22T12:57Z,"Nice collection. Thanks for uploading.

As an aside, I have been searching everywhere for a free download of the new Vampire the Masquerade 20th anniversary edition, but I cannot find one ANYWHERE! Does anyone know where I can get a free copy of the V20 pdf, or have one they'd be willing to upload here at TPB? I'd seed that fucker for the next six months if they did. Thanks. "
