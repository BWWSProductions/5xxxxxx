Irish Driver Theory Test 3rd Edition - SafeDisk copy protection REMOVED.

This is the same version as http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4869364/Irish_Driving_Theory_Test_2009 but I've replaced the copy protection files with clean ones.

Download the ISO, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a CD and never be bothered by "Please insert correct CDROM" messages again :)

Now, if only someone would upload the 4th edition...

And remember to seed when you're done!


UPDATE: The Piratebay tracker seems to be inaccessible from my ISP. Please replace the trackers in this torrent with the ones below. Leave the blank lines between entries.
