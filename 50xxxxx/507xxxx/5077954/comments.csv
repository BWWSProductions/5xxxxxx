Er, you have just extracted the ISO from the RAR. What bit is causing confusion?"

Driver_Theory_Test_2008.rar extracts to Driver_Theory_Test_2008.iso

I'm really struggling to figure out why this is so hard for people; first loops_of_fury, now you. :-/"
,marblewhite,2009-12-31T20:32Z,"The new ""Irish Driver Theory Test 4th Edition"" is out where did u get the files to replace the original in the ""3rd edition"" to make the cd workable and can u do the same for the 4th edition. 
Plz respond A.S.A.P

P.S. Most Scanners say the 4th edition have no or unknown protection but after a copy using ""blindwrite"" the cd comes up as illegal."
,magic_phil,2010-03-22T03:07Z,ok ive just managed to bypass the protection on the 4th edition will upload it in the next few days. Thanks for this!
,magic_phil,2010-03-26T09:47Z,Just uploaded the 4th edition http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5465208
