International superstar and multi-media mogul, JAY-Z confirms the most highly speculated date in recent music history. Friday, September 11, 2009 is the official release date for the eagerly anticipated BLUEPRINT III. The follow up to JAY-Z's instant classic BLUEPRINT (2001) and the critically acclaimed BLUEPRINT II (2002); BLUEPRINT III is the final installment in the BLUEPRINT series.

BLUEPRINT III is a Roc Nation / Live Nation release distributed through Atlantic Records. The album's first single "D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)" has exploded since it's June release. Performed live on the BET Awards on June 28th, the song's video premiered immediately following the show to great acclaim. Second single "Run This Town" with Rihanna and Kanye West was just serviced to radio. 

Since 1995, Jay-Z has dominated the rap industry and set the trends for a generation. Over his career, he has sold more than 40 million albums and sold out arenas worldwide. Winner of 7 Grammy Awards, his 10 No. 1 albums tie him with Elvis Presley and place him behind only The Beatles for the most of all-time. He is the founder and chairman of Rocawear, co-owner of the NJ Nets, 40/40 Sports Clubs and co-owner of the skin care and beauty line Carol's Daughter. Jay-Z became the first non-athlete to enter into a major footwear coventure with his S. Carter line for Reebok and in addition, continues his philanthropic work through his Water For LIfe initiative and Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. In 2008, JAY-Z entered into a partnership with Live Nation forming Roc Nation.
