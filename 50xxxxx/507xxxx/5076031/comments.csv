,lastjedi,2009-12-28T02:39Z,"its funny that jay-z has just been passed in sales for the most sales by a music artist this decade,guess who beat him,the beatles haha.not only are the beatles the all time selling music artists of all time led zeppelin is second all time,but now the beatles have outsold all artists for this decade!jay-z is nopw ranked second and will finish second for this decade now that this decade is over,just goes to show the beatles can beat all new artists haha."
,iwilleatu,2010-01-01T18:07Z,"beatles are good, but the only reason they sold more is bcuz they put out every single album they made and remastered them, of course you're gonna sell more than any artist when you put out over 15 albums in one year, and all the old school peeps jumped on it!"
,lastjedi,2010-01-02T06:01Z,"iwilleatyou thats only an excuse for this year 2009 what about the other 9 years for this decade,the beatles outsold all artists for this decade not just this year,it all adds up."
,iwilleatu,2010-01-05T19:12Z,"@ lastjedi-i'm really sorry, i didn't realize you said a decade bro,i got hung up on 2009 when i was reading,lol, yeah ur right, a decade! that is a hell of an acheivement. my apoligies "
