,t0adman,2009-09-17T06:49Z,"That is weird but it might explain why the sound is way, way off.  My version skips and the sound it off by a second or more.  I guess I need to download it again once you get it completely uploaded.  Anyone else having this issue?"
,mechee304,2009-09-27T21:04Z,"i had issues w/ episode 1's sound but only when i streamed it to my xbox. otherwise the computer's sound caught up after the beginning credits.  haven't checked after ep.5 tho but 2-5 are good 
:P thanx! i "
,rancidguy,2009-11-02T13:06Z,"Ya no problem! I didn't have any problem with the sound when I watched them, so not sure why...are you using VLC? Also follow kraker666's advice & turn off anything you dont need, I personally run with 3 gigs of ram so I dont get the lag..."
