Thanks a load to the uploader!"
,Zgrougno,2009-12-28T17:03Z,"It Doesn't work for me. When I try to install it, a message pops and says this: Can't be installed because there is a conflict with:
- Adobe Indesign C3... 

Non-sens for me. I do not have any inDesign C3 versions on my computer. I've Indesign CS1.

I use a Mac Running with Snow leopard.

Thanks for reading."
