today i tried to open InDesign CS3 for the first time since installing Leopard (archive and install) on my PowerBook G4. it did not work. found out this is a very common problem. managed to fix it after a lot of faffing about. figured others would like to know what to do and have everything to do it in one torrent. so here it is! (things from other torrents in here so thanks to those that created them...)

how to...

1. uninstall existing InDesign fully at -
Applications > Utilities > Adobe Installers

2. install trial version (ADBEIDSNCS3_WWE.dmg)

3. unzip and open AdobeÂ® Design Suite PremiumÂ® CS3 US [k] (Universal)

4. drag application icon from
Applications > Adobe InDesign CS3 into 'drop zone'

now you should have working version of InDesign on leopard!


if you want to update it -

1. run the updater in indesign_5_0_4.dmg

2. open InDesign, it will now ask you for a serial

3. !!!DISCONNECT FROM INTERNET!!!

4. input one of the following serials -
1037-0492-8457-6162-8042-0859
1037-0889-1489-0734-6508-4161

5. a screen will come up saying how you are not connected to the internet. good! click on 'Never Register' down the bottom.

now you will have an updated working InDesign 5.0.4 on leopard, wooohooo!
