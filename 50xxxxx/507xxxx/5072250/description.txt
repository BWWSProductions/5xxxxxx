Two quirky, lonely sisters searching desperately for excitement in their outback backwater burg are delighted when a mysterious, much-older Brisbane disc jockey moves in the house next door. While he spins Barry White over the feeble 50-watt airwaves, the two sisters scheme to seduce him; both succeed, but their unctuous quarry is clearly calling the emotional shots.
