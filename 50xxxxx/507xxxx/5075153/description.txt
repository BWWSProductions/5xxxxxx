In Los Angeles' musically incestuous post-Eighties' rock scene, the "supergroup" tag can apply whenever two or more musicians whose names possess the tiniest bit of marquee value couple and spawn a project. That said, meet Col. Parker, the offspring of ex-Guns N' Roses guitar-slinger Gilby Clarke, Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom, one-time L.A. Guns bassist Muddy Stardust and keyboard mercenary, Teddy Andreadis. Rock 'n' Roll Music offers an upbeat mix of blues-based rockers and ballads punctuated with Clarke's inspiring attempts to squeeze every Keith Richards guitar riff into one album, and spiked with humorous odes to decadent lifestyles long-abandoned ("Can't Get that Stuff," "Pushing 40 Blues". The disc, which belies the band's bar-band roots, contains zero percent threats to the status quo or insights to the meaning of life. It's only Rock 'n' Roll, but I like it.
