,mcmenace1,2009-09-02T15:23Z,"Try several DAYS
c'mon why are you doing this??"
,sundazed,2009-09-02T19:14Z,"Yawn. I'm out of here. Time to get a life. The two incomplete tracks are 'Uncle Jack' and 'Girl In Your Eye' which I can pull from a compilation. Incidentally, 'Fresh Garbage' seems to have a nasty glitch at the end, unless it's something to do with the partial download."

Should be O.K. now. "
,sundazed,2009-09-02T23:28Z,"I knew if I hung on that little bit longer...

Thanks."
,sundazed,2009-09-02T23:33Z,"@ecolo
You said you weren't getting any statistics: well a lot of people will have this one now as we were all stuck on 99.88% and there were 89 of us so..."
[T],ecolo,2009-09-02T23:53Z,"Thanks sundazed
My problems are not solved yet so bear with me for the other uploads"
,sundazed,2009-09-06T08:44Z,"Incidentally, that glitch at the end of Fresh Garbage disappeared once I had the full download."
