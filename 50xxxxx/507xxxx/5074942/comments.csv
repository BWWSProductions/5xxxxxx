[V],room101bellboy,2009-09-17T16:17Z,"Does it claim anywhere in the description to be a 720 p BRRip (1280Ă720)? 

Read the description before posting: Resolution = 688 x 288. And I believe it's BRRip --and not a DVDRip-- if VLiS says so. 

Keep up the good work VLiS.   "

That file works ok with this vlis download.

Shame on vlis for not including a proper subtitles file."
