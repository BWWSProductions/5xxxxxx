Cyrano De Bergerac (1990, French, cokor) gets a 7.5 star,
 and  Cyrano De Bergerac (1950, US, B&W) also get a 7.5.

  Steve Martin's Roxanne (1987, US. Color) gets a 6.6 points.

Anyone wants to put ther own rating?

Mine is  Jose Ferrer > Steve martin> GĂŠrard Depardieu"

,eremite,2011-01-09T07:36Z,"leeSally, I would also add Janeane Garofolo.  The Truth About Cats and Dogs was a clumsy take on the story who's main failing, in my mind, was that I was expected to think Uma Thurman is beautiful. :p

Having trouble getting a Depardieu version with decent subs, but so far I agree Jose Ferrer is untouchable."
,schnitzelburger,2012-02-05T19:26Z,Very bad quality! Must be from a very fucked up DVD. The HDTV rip is MUCH better.
,pjmoney,2012-02-20T09:17Z,The video/sound quality sure takes me back to the 90's.
