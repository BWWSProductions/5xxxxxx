Mum and Dad, and their â€˜adoptedâ€™ children, Birdie & Elbie, work at the airport. The family live off whatever they scavenge from cargo holds, offices and hotels â€“ including a steady stream of transient workers who populate the airportâ€™s soulless hub. When Lena, a young Polish office cleaner, is befriended by Birdie, she gets drawn into a nightmarish world of torture, murder and perversity. Imprisoned in a suburban House of Horrors and designated a â€˜Mummyâ€™s Girlâ€™, Lenaâ€™s only options appear to be to become part of the family â€“ and join them in their insanity â€“ or die.
