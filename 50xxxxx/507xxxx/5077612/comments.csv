,Infinitee44,2009-09-05T14:22Z,"Even though the TPB listing says 0 leachers and seeders, the torrent has (atm) 4 seeders and over a hundred leachers.

Have a crack! Can't imagine this torrent being without a seed over the next year or two!!
Thnx cdbz."
,Crusader66,2009-09-17T02:55Z,"Why, oh why would you put anything in RealMedia format. RM has been crap since it came out and it hasnt gotten much better.
To make it worse I can't find the episodes elsewhere. Weep, sob.

Thank you but no thank you."
