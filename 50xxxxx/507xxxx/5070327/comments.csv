Hopefully the trackers will be up sometime soon so they don't keep showing up as no seeds or leechers (hopefully it's not just on my end). Let's see if we can't keep these torrents alive and kicking while we're at it. No one likes a dead torrent. We don't want that on our consciences do we? I think not. I'll upload as long as I can but the more I add the more strain it's putting on my bandwidth. I'm going to have to start limiting the upload on some of these to probably 15kb/s so the new ones can get seeds faster.

Again, I'd like to thank you all. It's a pleasure serving you kind folks."
