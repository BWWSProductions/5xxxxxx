thanks"
[T],liluser,2011-06-12T17:14Z,"@ vlatko21  all my releases are clean..

and i use eset smart security with settings on max..

kaspersky is one of the worst to use"
,avrumi,2011-07-10T21:44Z,"i don't agree with that - kaspersky is not a bad antivirus at all - yes true not the best - i did not download these, but i guess when you make these its probably a good torrent  so thanks for the torrent - but you probably now by now, i have my own torrent  @liluser "
