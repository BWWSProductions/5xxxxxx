Skin is the story of a young thalidomide skinhead in 1970s London, and his attempts to deal with his disability and the world in general. 

The 48-page graphic novel was due to feature in Crisis in 1990 but the publishers, Fleetway were worried by the controversial subject matter, plus they were concerned with the explicit use of language in the story. The printers refused to print it, blaming the graphic language and controversial subject matter as a reason. The story remained in limbo until eventually being published as a graphic novel by Tundra with little, or no controversy. 

Written by Peter Milligan, created and drawn by Brendan McCarthy and colored by Carol Swain.  Milligan has said the story partially addresses "universal themes of major companies shafting people, and corruption in terms of drugs and mass marketing."  It remains one of Milligan's most powerful and acclaimed works.

Hardcore band Modern Life Is War based their song "Martin Atchet" on the comic.


Due to the adult themes, language and violence this comes with an ADULT rating.
