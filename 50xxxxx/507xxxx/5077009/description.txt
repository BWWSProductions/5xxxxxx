This is the only album released by American emo/indie band Cap'n Jazz, being long out of print, and extremely difficult to find even on the internet, it almost faced being a lost record.
I upload it in the hopes that we may salvage this gem of music.

Don't even think about turning the comments section into an emo bashing flamewar or arguing about genre etc.
