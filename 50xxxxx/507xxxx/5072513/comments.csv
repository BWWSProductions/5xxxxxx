I just looked it up on discogs.com, and it is indeed he same EG Daily that's been in TV and movies and cartoon voiceover for as long as I can remember.  I'll always remember her best as uber-cute val chick Loryn in the movie Valley Girl in 1983.  Gotta check it out...

Plus, more Jet Black Berries, awesome.

PS - I think you just posted the same GE Smith album in your last 80s albums torrent #73.  Was something funky about the last one?  There weren't any corrupt files for me when I downloaded it."
,JonYo,2009-08-29T11:06Z,"Oh, a quick note:
On the GE Smith album, the tracks 6 and 7 are both labeled ""Powerman"", but track 7 is actually ""Sad About Girls""."
,8675309,2009-08-29T16:18Z,Thank you! Do you have The Arrows - Stand Back? 
,erikphnx,2009-08-29T16:50Z,Oh yes ! Thanks. 
,erikphnx,2009-08-29T16:52Z,Just had to thank you twice!
[V],80zforever,2009-08-29T16:59Z,"JonYo ooops sorry man. G.E. Smith is indeed duplicate due to a glitch in my system  (uploading while being drunk lol). anyhow count this as 7 rare 80s records hahaha. also not many people knew E.G. Daily had released a record and it's not bad at all. 

8675309 I have only the best of Arrows not this lp.


and erikphnx you're welcome twice lol"
,tkm0718,2009-08-29T17:24Z,Glad to see you're still kicking around the bay!!  Thanks 80zforever!!!   u r simply the best!  Better than all the rest!
,sparksie,2009-08-29T18:29Z,"80z forever, man to have both Darkroom albums good on you and thanks man, have any NEOA4 or any other Edmonton area bands? Really looking for Cafe Jacques. Thanks again Cheers!!"
,erikphnx,2009-08-29T18:31Z,"If I were a manipulative guy I would say that due to the G.E. Smith glitch you technically owe me at least one more rare 80 album... That is if I were manipulative  :)
Jokes aside I think it's great you have continued to post. I don't think we will ever have another decade like the 80s when it comes to music and thanks to you I now know just how great it was! So Thank you thrice!"
[V],80zforever,2009-08-29T18:44Z,"Sparksie, I have all three Neo A4 records. which one are you interested in? I think Ohama was from Edmonton too, but he's more into minimal synth."
[T],inchboots,2009-08-29T20:06Z,"thanks

do you have  Annabel lamb The Flame?
best regards

"
,8675309,2009-08-30T01:40Z,The best of The Arrows would be awesome if you could!!
,sparksie,2009-08-30T02:11Z,80'zforever your pick on the NEOA4

,the808,2011-04-17T06:39Z,"so glad I decided to write them as I go, lol. great stuff here, these comments are all kinda old, so tpb is still kicking, contrary to everyone's fears when these posts originally ummm posted, lol. maybe not forever, but I'm working my way from 100 down, not keeping all of them, but I'm trying to keep some on my torrent, I guess that's what you mean by seed, dunno, but this has been a real revelation for sure! 80zforever you are something else.
