[V],only1joe,2009-08-28T10:25Z,"Im using multi-trackers. All you have to do is download the torrent to your bit torrent client and it will still pick up all the other trackers.

The piratebay trackers are not working at the moment and showing no seeds or leeches

To find out the number of seeds check you torrent client
