Dancing On Tables Barefoot - Tara Blaise [2005]
	


Dancing on Tables Barefoot is the debut solo album by Irish singer Tara Blaise. The album came about when she was working with the Corrs manager, John Hughes, and he offered her an album deal on his own Spokes label, and sent her to Los Angeles to work with Corrs producer Olle Romo, resulting in her debut album Dancing On Tables Barefoot. The first Tara Blaise solo single was "Fool for Love", featuring only Tara's voice and a string quartet. Both "Fool for Love" and follow up "Paperback ClichÃ©" were playlisted by BBC Radio 2 in the UK and Tara covered much ground with a tour of UK regional radio stations, perform with Corrsâ€™ guitarist Anthony Drennan.
