,Jcateau,2010-06-23T22:39Z,Good rip 9/9
,qwertzik,2010-10-28T22:50Z,"Audio syncing problem, transcoded for AppleTV via iTunes, once with Visual Hub (d/l with Transmissions), once directly through Vuze, both out of sync."
,nammoor,2010-11-04T14:11Z,"Thank you

My Kids loved it

Great Rip"
,SpiritNRG,2011-03-14T06:52Z,"Wow, there's some serious audio sync issues here. Tested on PC, works fine. PS3 streaming has 2 - 3 second audial delay.

I could always recode the thing, but in that case, I may as well download a different one. This should have been done right the first time. Maybe if people would take time to rip em right instead of trying to upload as much as possible, there wouldn't be so much crap."
,notUSA,2011-03-24T13:31Z,"recieved notice of Copyright Infringement? come to portugal and u can download a nice movie while u smoke a green one on a park bench.. nice hu? Not quite like fascist USA where u can´t even fart, you´ll get arrested. Not peoples fault though, just a corrupt government"
