Revolted Masses were formed in Spring 2008, while the group took its final form at the end of the same year.

This self-titled demo, is our first work, which was released in June 2009.

Our music approaches the area of extreme metal, without restricting ourselves, with influences from the general rock/metal area and a touch of oriental elements. The lyrics are mainly of a radical political nature.

At the moment, we try to give as many concerts as possible, in order to gain experience as a band, while a long-range aim is to present a full-length album.

Revolted Masses are:

George Triantafyllidis: Vocals
Vaggelis Theodorakis: Guitars
Kostas Karvounis-Zoumpos: Guitars
George Stathopoulos: Bass Guitar
Foivos Andriopoulos: Drums

Tracklist:
