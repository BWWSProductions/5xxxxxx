,toflyde,2009-09-05T20:09Z,Are these really the ones?? Disappointed. But will buy them anyway... Compelled to.
,[NTT],2009-09-05T20:55Z,"WOW! Hard to believe this is here four days early.  This is the real deal, people - crystal clear.  So, so Happy.  Thank you twenty times, syndre!

Looking forward to the mini documentaries showing up."
,[NTT],2009-09-06T00:09Z,Could someone please fix the clic/gap btwn USSR & Dear Prudence & put Julia back in the proper order.  I've tried on my end but cannot fix it no matter what I try.  Thx
,jimmel,2009-09-06T19:17Z,Let it Be...Naked isn't being remastered?
,cborgman,2009-09-08T01:45Z,this sounds just like the files i already had. i don't think these SiRE torrents are the actual remasters
,poiuytman,2009-09-09T14:04Z,Let It Be... Naked was released in 2003 and is already an extensive remastering job. It doesn't need to be remastered *again*.
,germiman,2009-09-09T17:25Z,"they are in then mp3, the quality of sound is not the optimal... or not?"
,johan34370,2009-09-09T20:19Z,many thanks! even if it isn't 320Kbits the quality is excellent!!!
,looooongjohnsilver,2009-09-09T23:05Z,What are these encoded at?
[T],budakrist,2009-09-10T04:39Z,These are probably -V2 VBR
,phedboi,2009-09-10T05:07Z,"I get different info from different apps -- Quicktime reports they're CBR with tracks encoded at rates varying anywhere from 180-200 kb/s. VLC, however, says they're all around 192. So maybe 192 VBR?"

,fredfan,2009-09-10T20:34Z,"LOL...why would someone bother to rip--in half-quality lossy compressed version-- 40 year old music available elsewhere in spades, when the only reason for having it is the pristine quality?

Folks, even if this is from the real thing, you likely already own it in better quality than this."
,[NTT],2009-09-11T00:48Z,"Ignorant LEECHERS W/O ONE G*DDAMN F*KIN' UL!  I'm talking to the little sh*ts cborgman, bladik8, fredfan, you don't know what yer talking about.

These are the real remasters.  Stop taking it in the ear & use them to listen.  I compared these files w/bubanee's and these are the real deal.

For all of those complaining or wondering about encoding, this is the best out there.  If you want better, make it & share it.  Otherwise STFU.  I'm so sick of LEECHERS snobbing about encoding & then they have not UL sh*t.

,[NTT],2009-09-11T00:50Z,"On a lighter note, if you want all of the Remastered Documentary in one file, you'll find it here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5084773 ."
,matty427,2009-09-11T02:34Z,Anyone know if this is the stereo or mono mix?
,[NTT],2009-09-11T02:43Z,"matty427, these are stereo.  When I saw this UL a few days ago, I DL 1 file from 'Please Please Me', which was not available in stereo B4, listened to it & then I knew."

,VinYl_RiPPa,2009-09-11T21:54Z,"By the way folks, this ain't the 2009 remasters; it's just needle-dropped stereo LPs."
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-09-11T22:35Z,"Talk about diggin up dirt again?!?!  I mean is there any point in bothering to listen to all this Beatles stuff again?  I did that years ago, will it be really any more better than it was years ago.  I don't see much point in bothering to be honest..."
,drgonz1,2009-09-12T14:02Z,People please! If these were the remastered versions then why tha fuck would you want them as MP3s? The compression would fuck it all up. Wait for the .flac versions instead!
,johnfranklyn,2009-09-12T15:00Z,"Thankyou for this DL. I've downloaded and am listening to it. Great quality, enjoyable music that reminds of times and friends past.

Keep it up, thank you."

,badlands,2009-09-13T16:10Z,"These are NOT the remastered albums, which is very obvious. They're all the 1987-issues with very flat production which becomes even worse in mp3. Signature songs on the 2009-remasters, where the production is vastly improved, are f.i ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Tomorrow never knows""Â¨, ""Rocky Raccoon"""", and ""Girl"" (to mention a few). DL those and listen to them, then you'll realize if it's the real thing. That anyone, like this uploader, would devote so much time and space to upload the same old productionwise-rubbish is very hard to understand. Obviously the medication didn't work or he was out of it."
[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-09-14T02:28Z,"Badlands:

I would agree with you, but i'm not shure about the ""real deal"" anymore since we haven't found any torrent with the production quality we once expected.
To justify our presumptions we must have at least one opportunity to hear the right tracks.
Is there anybody out there who is able to confirm our doubts???"
,TaoBaba1008,2009-09-14T07:57Z,"Sounds allright for me, thanks for the upload!!!!!!!!!!"
[T],lonesomecowboy,2009-09-14T13:14Z,"Here is my final conclusion:

I am not an American, nor am I a Limey Bastard like you.  I usually do not make comments, but on this one I had to.  You claim that the Americans should prepare to speak Chinese in 20 years.... maybe so... maybe not.  You English however and your communist ways need to realize how bad your country is.  I recently flow through London and on a long layover decided to exit the airport.  Out of 19 people at the Immigration Passport Control, 2 of these people were REAL Englishmen.  The other 17 barely spoke any English and were Islamic Immigrants.  Only God knows what will happen in the USA in 20 years... you however have about 6 months to become Muslim or lose your country, because it is not yours any more.  It should say in Heathrow airport  ""Welcome to Londonistan.""  

Then again, you Limey Bastards deserve it.  Worse than Stalin, Hitler, Mao Tse Tong, Bin LAdens and all combined is the English Government and English Royal family.

2. Rhodesia - Zimbabwe
3. Croatians in Bleiburg Austria

[T],SpandauBaby,2009-09-15T21:19Z,"OMG!! That's like some of the funniest shit I've ever seen on here, just sitting and reading you both slagging the hell outta each other makes my eyes sore from laughing fits.  It's funny what you're saying and you both have an exceptional way with words.  My theory on life and the world or earth rather is that we don't live in a perfect world, everywhere you go things are fucked up in all kinds of weird and wonderful ways.

It's only different countries when you divide it up like through political power and money or ownership.  If you have a passport you can go anywhere you want really unless you do something that somebody doesn't agree with.  This planet is just one big ball and us as humans just 'scratch' around on the outside like as if we actually put it here in the first place.

As far as religion goes, that's just there to brain wash people into believing in some kind of higher power when really things go beyond anything that humans have ever had to say on this planet.  Just an interesting thought hehe now carry on please.... :-)"

,gnubeest,2009-11-03T22:13Z,"The documentaries in the track listings you'll see around are actually videos.  The videos are on the individual albums, except in the boxed sets where they're on a separate disc.

If anyone is confused about track order, keep in mind that ever since the first CD issues in the 80s, the ""official"" and only Beatles releases are from the UK albums (with the exception, if I remember correctly, of the US MMT LP being used vs. the UK EP).  All other singles or US album tracks are to be found on the Past Masters discs.

If you're worried about torrent quality, I can confirm that the FLAC release here of the stereo remaster set is complete, genuine, and sounds great, so you can quit yer bitchin' and compress them yourself."
