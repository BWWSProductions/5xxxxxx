,necr0god,2011-01-06T17:33Z,"Whats with the 1080p crap?

Info says: ""Resolution .........:1920 x816""

""1080p is the shorthand identification for a set of HDTV video modes that are characterised by 1,080 lines of vertical resolution""

So a proper 1080p video would be 1920x1080"
,zxcvbnm6000,2011-01-30T08:16Z,"@necr0god 

This is 1080p. The BD source is 1920x1080, but after you crop off the black bars on top and bottom you get 1920 x816. If the encoder didn't do this, those black bars would add to a large file size."
,oxbladder,2011-02-02T17:12Z,Hello. Can anyone tell me if the subs are hard or soft coded for this movie?
,flg8rfan,2011-12-30T01:08Z,"Bleh, why the .rar files?  Usually your releases are free of that bullshit.

That means if I want to keep this torrent to re-share (like you should) AND watch, I have to maintain 22GB worth of this movie on my hard drive.

Lame."
,Rahzar2012,2012-02-13T14:10Z,for all those people who bitch about the resolution you need to get a fucking clue and learn about a little something called aspect ratio.  Not every movie is shot using the same aspect ratio so therefore the resolution is going to be different for each film.  1920x816 would appear to be 2.35:1 so what that mean is for every 1 unit tall the picture is 2.35 units tall.
