Note about virus warnings: If you get a trojan or virus warning then it's a false positive! - I've added nothing!!
You get exactly the same warning when you download and install the trial version because it's the same setup.
I only removed & modified some files to disable MoovieLive, MovieRemix + RichVideo & to make it pre-activated.

Here's how to check the Digital Signatures:

â€¢ Extract Setup.exe with 7-zip and open the directory where you extracted the files
â€¢ Right click on any exe file, select properties and click on the Digital Signatures tab
â€¢ Double click on the Signature and read the line below "Digital Signature Information"
â€¢ If it says that the Digital Signature is OK, it means that the file isn't altered.
â€¢ Click on the "View Certificate" button for more information
