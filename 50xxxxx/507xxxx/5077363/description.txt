I know that many are waiting on the official release, This is however the official soundtrack that will be released. Starkid may be adding/improving it or have run into legality issues but i can not comment. 
A Very Potter Musical is a fabulous musical spoof of the Harry Potter books/movies.  It was written and performed, including original music, by a group of current and former students of the University of Michigan. All credit for this non-profit media goes to Star Kid Potter. The videos of the performance can be seen on Star Kid Potterschannel:
Also the music can be listened to at www.imeem.com 
I made this for the convenience of those people waiting desperately for the soundtrack.
