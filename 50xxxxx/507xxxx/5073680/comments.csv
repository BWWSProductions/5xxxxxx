,bloodhungry7,2009-08-31T07:42Z,"im not sure which garbage should be burnt first this pile of steaming dung or the new halloween? These are the reasons why ppl pirate because these movies holloywood makes isnt even worth the toilet-paper i wipe my ass with! This and the new halloween are the 2 worst movies of this year so far! I hope that the actors directors and any indaviduals involved in the making of these are burned at a stake, so as to never tarnish my eyes with such crap movies ever again. I never bitch but seriously i wish these 2 movies were bannished from the film vaults and lock in a dungeon with Bin Ladin! GOD AWFUL PREDICTABLE JUNK AND AS BORING AS THEY COME! i give this film a -100 on all scales kill the ppl involved in the making!"
,airbiskit,2009-08-31T17:44Z,"Ok so the film may not have been the best but was very watchable for a cam which makes a change.
So thanks for the upload DragonLord721.

V=7 bit dark in places but you see the bloody horrific ends to the various people.
A=8 no problems with it on the whole.

Much respect and thanks again :)"
