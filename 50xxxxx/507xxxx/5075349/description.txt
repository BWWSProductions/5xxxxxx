A trainee spy races from a powerful vampire mage, in a bid to stop the 
world being plunged into eternal darkness. 

Before his untimely death two hundred years ago, the evil sorcerer, 
Mordred Darkthrop, created two opposing magical orbs - the Orb of 
Darkness, and the Orb of Light. 

Unwittingly stolen by Mel, a young thief, and placed into the hands of 
Gyendal, a vampire who calls himself the Lord of Twilight, the Orb of 
Darkness is about to be used to plunge mankind into eternal night and 
slavery. Mel, a descendant of Darkthrop, is the only one who can 
activate the orb. 

She is also the only one able to stop the Lord of Twilight's evil plan. 

Mel's life has been turned upside down. She has joined forces with an 
unusual band of friends, as she races to find the Orb of Light before 
the vampire lord succeeds in fulfilling the Darkthrop prophecy.
