Perfect Guy For My Girlfriend - Idealny facet dla mojej dziewczyny (2009) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1346281/

Plot: A light hearted, tongue-in-cheek comedy mocking Poland's number one catholic radio station which has played a significant role in shaping Polish political scene. The film reflects an ongoing battle of liberal vs conservative norms of behavior in a society. Sexual revolution is the key element of this film and taboo is broken in every single scene. The caricatures are vivid and the irony is biting which some pious catholics might find disrespectful. Nevertheless, it was not in the authors' minds to ridicule the entire group of believers but only the most radical group that crosses some boundaries of what's acceptable and what is not.
