,Pimpinsince88,2009-09-12T02:18Z,"Ok so this is the hottest album out right now and could possibly be a grammy winning album and I'm thankful for the torrent but a lot of people like myself are gonna be upset with this torrent when they try to edit it in their itunes when they discover that you can't edit it, nos1977 put some kind of editing security that is frustrating as fuck. You can't edit the tags, please don't do this with anymore torrents I know you're trying to get your name out there and all but please don't do this anymore."

,vivatpb5776,2010-12-12T06:28Z,"First, let me say thank you to the uploader. The quality is excellent.

Now, Pimpinsince88, I am not sure exactly how you edit ID3 tags but I had no problem editing the tags. I use Winamp but there are numerous third party apps out there that can do it with no issue. Also, Windows Vista and Windows 7 have built-in ID3 tag editors within Windows Explorer. Granted, your comment is over a year old but I wanted to post this so that others aren't deterred from downloading this .torrent.

Again, NoFS, thank you."
