Strange because the WiKi is inset 8gb (720p)"
[V],sailo,2009-08-29T07:46Z,"AC3 = 450mb (DTS=1.6GB),  my $100 - 5.1 can't tell the difference, can you?

BITRATE = 4000Kbps = plenty enough for anything below 50"" screen. 
bitrate overkill, only if you have a 100"" projector."
,darthsidious,2009-08-29T09:26Z,"sailo...

but I do have a 100"" projector.. :D

Any chance for a 1080p rip???"
[V],sailo,2009-08-29T09:47Z,":D,  @12gb, nah not me, wait for a scene release, or someone else to upload, Angels & Demons 2009 Extended Cut BluRay 1080p x264 DTS-WiKi"
,dusna,2009-08-29T14:03Z,"To iafpups:
I can see no seeders and leechers on piratebay but if I put torrent in Vuze they show up so I can download without any problem.


Torrent is real. I tried sample and it looked great. I can't wait to see it. I need only 1,5 % to download :)

Thanks for upload.

,fire321,2009-10-03T02:58Z,"hi sailo,

i'm a big fan of all your release. honestly, you are the only person who uploads movies with chinese subtitles .. and i truly appreciate that ...  :)

sailo, i really .. really wish to watch this movie .. but i don't have a bluray player.  :(

any chance of you uploading a dvd-r version of this movie? i really wish you could kindly consider. your kind effort would be very much appreciated ...  :)

thanks in advance,

alvin"
