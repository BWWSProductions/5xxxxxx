Taylor Hicks - Taylor Hicks [2006]



Taylor Hicks is the eponymous major label debut album by the American Idol fifth-season winner of the same name. The album was released on 12 December  2006 in the United States by Arista Records in association with 19 Recordings Limited, nearly seven months after Hicks won the reality-talent competition in May. Hicks coined the phrase "modern whomp" to describe the album's soundâ€”an amalgam of soul, blues, funk, and Cajun influences with a contemporary twist. The first single from the album was the ballad "Just to Feel That Way".

The album debuted at the number two spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 298,000 copies in its first week. Within one month of its release, Taylor Hicks was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping over one million copies. However, over a year later it had reached sales of only about 700,000 copies, making it the lowest selling debut album by an American Idol winner. The album has sold approximately 809,000 copies worldwide
