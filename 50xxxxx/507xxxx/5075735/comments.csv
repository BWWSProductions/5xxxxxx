Also if you are going to CREATE a file for public download, then use the normal format that 99% of the public uses, or at least a format that VLC uses.  Making a file that other people have to download and install more software on thier computer to clutter it up isn't a great help.  If you are doing this for your enjoyment then don't share it if you can't upload a format that doesn't require excess installations."

Coming to the other side of the comment, I just want to give content which i deem to be fit. I have my interest in h264,aac,ass,.mkv. So my ups are supposed to be in the provided formats only(I made my research on them, so no blind and impulsive decision)
I suppose that you just have expressed your views relating to ass subs. But what is the point in providing good audio and video with just awkward looking .srt subs. I can select the font,size,colour etc of the words to be displayed as subs if i select ass.
Regarding additional software required to be installed - You can have your very best interest in VLC. But that doesn't mean it is the Best. And remaining is up to you. Decide your self whether to accept the change or not. "
,Tektool,2009-09-04T01:14Z,Ok I was able to finally download the file and view it.  It played in VLC with very good video and audio quaility and the subs came through alright.  I apologise for jumping the gun.
,kevukenn,2009-09-05T07:33Z,"No need for any apologies Tektool.
I must thank you for your vote of acceptance."
