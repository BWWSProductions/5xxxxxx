Dont worry about the file size. The quality of video is astonishing. It is crystal clear. There is some defect at some point in the video. But it lasts for 2 seconds. The audio is definite plus for this movie. You will feel the nativity of japanese. Surround sound is excellently used. And as far as the story is concerned the title describes all.
.

Watch this movie more than once. You will surely enjoy the movie for the second and subsequent times.
