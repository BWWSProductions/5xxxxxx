Gruver has just gotten out of the joint after serving a five-year sentence for drug-dealing but has no intention of going straight. Driven by greed, ego, and the only life he has ever known, Gruver is hell-bent on taking back his city from the gangsters who moved in on his drug business while he was locked up. With a crew that fell apart while he was gone, a ruthless detective who will stop at nothing to put away the city's hustlers, and four new drug kingpins not about to give up their rule, Gruver will have to risk it all in his climb back to the top. Will the double threat of more prison time or assassination by his enemies derail his plans? Or will the promise of a new relationship with the sensual and seductive Erica - who is captivating his time and attention like no woman ever has - help him see the possibilities of a different life ahead?
