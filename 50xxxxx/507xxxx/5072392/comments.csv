,ciresiuol,2009-08-29T04:51Z,why did you upload and not seed...ass
,Bombardem,2009-08-29T05:54Z,"Just a guess, but since TPB's hosting was moved to a different company this last week there is a huge lag in the seed/leech data. Just look at the first couple pages of films, all zeroes. Ignore it.

Fuck the RIAA bitches!"

,lie2me,2009-09-25T04:57Z,"Not that great - looking for a better copy. Lots of screen flicker and english subs over russian subs through much of it.

At best it's a 7/7 on video/ audio.  Looks like a cam.

thanks, though!"
