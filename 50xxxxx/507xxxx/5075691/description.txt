First 37 episodes of 'Burn Notice' encoded for PSP and hardsubbed in English. Specially for those who want to catch up with this quite good series and either watches tv in noisy environment or have a hard time understanding what americans say.
The pilot is not subbed: could not find subtitles for extended R2 version.

Source: Season 1 - R2 DVD, Seasons 2 and 3 - HDTV rips.

480x272, 630+120 kbps.
Tested on PSP, but probably should work with iPhone/Zune.
Encoded with MeGUI/x264/neroAac
