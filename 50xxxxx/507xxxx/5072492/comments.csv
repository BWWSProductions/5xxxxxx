Then, by all means replace the installed installations use the sibelius exec file with the one provided in this excellent crack!

Use this serial to install: SWEP401493174220592"
,fadoze,2009-08-31T13:00Z,"This is working here with a G5 2X1800. But the save function wil work for 14 days only if sibelius is not registered. Does anyone have a trick have a full working version without registering ? ank you, anyway, TGDr-aka-RG"
,fadoze,2009-08-31T13:01Z,I wanted to write 'Thank you' TGDr-aka-RG
,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-09-01T15:18Z,"fadoze

Did you use the Crack file?  This should give you the full working (registered) version."
,fadoze,2009-09-02T13:46Z,"Yes; I did. Can you please re-explain the complete process, many thanks !"
,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-09-02T16:34Z,"fadoze
Launch the Sibelius app, when it asks to register, click on 'Register with another computer' (or similar, I can't remember exactly!)

Then enter your regisration details, using the serial above.

Enter anything in the 'Registration Number' field
(ie R 09813723 04442674)

It will tell you that this is invalid.

Quit and then:

Ctrl-click on the Sibelius app, select 'Show Package Contents'.  Go to Contents > MacOS > Sibelius 6
Ctrl-click on 'Sibelius 6' and select 'Move to Trash'.
Then copy the 'Sibelius 6' crack file to the 'MacOS' folder.  That should be it. Let me know how you get on!"
,pianoman_1,2009-09-15T15:31Z,"No man, some very, very important bugfixes are fixed in that 6.0.3 update, that will not work with the old cracked file... It will run, and it says itÂ´s 6.0.3 build 2, but it aint! 
I will just have to hope than in 15 days, a crack will pop up... "
,apple23,2009-11-08T06:20Z,"what if we have already registered and there is a ""helper tool"" and ""Install tool"" folder in the MACOS folder? When i launch sibelius it says unregistered. Would the same rules apply? because i tried replacing that file and sibelius wouldnt open. and which file are you supposed to replace it with? the zip file? or the files in the zip file?"
,imclean,2009-12-05T14:38Z,"If you want to upgrade to version 6.1 for Snow Leopard, then go to the sibelius website and download the upgrade and install, follow the instruction below and add the serial, then start the program unregistered. Close it. Overwrite the Sibelius ^ program with the crack and restart, done."

,dhouse99,2009-12-09T23:26Z,Is this just an update if you already have sibelius version 6?   is there the full version 6 anywhwere??
,pt_edge1953,2009-12-17T01:05Z,i have got windows so i do i complete the registration process?
,jhghton3,2009-12-18T01:45Z,is anyone having issues with 'b' (flat) key signatures in the 6.1.0 no.14 build??  or this issue in general? has anyone resolved it?
,jhghton3,2009-12-18T13:50Z,"Actually, if you have had this problem, restarting your computer should do the trick (at least, it did with 6.1.0 build 14)."
,Luddekuddekudde,2010-01-02T14:31Z,"Thank you so much! Works perfectly.

Im on a Macbook Pro, had to Upgrade to 6.0.3 first (thanks dinodrums) and then simply replaced the crack. No need to worry about serials etc."
,datisit,2010-01-02T14:40Z,"@Luddekuddekudde
By ""simply replaced the crack"" do you mean you ran the crack installer or just replaced the file that's in the MacOs folder?"
,mstrswrd06,2010-01-21T08:34Z,"Any news on a working keygen yet? Mission critical preference windows don't work with the crack (Audio Engine Options specifically) under any version, OSX 10.6.2."
,rathbon3,2010-02-09T16:12Z,"ok so I had version 6.0.1, downloaded the 6.1 version for snow leopard, then tried using this crack  but to no avail. I get all the registration palaver still but even if i sort that out Sibelius then quits unexpectedly every time without fail. I've tried restarting which I think someone suggested but still no luck. Anyone know the answer??? "
,drake1000,2010-02-13T03:13Z,"The whole thing is pretty confusing, but complete step by step instructions for Snow Leopard are now here:

Good luck!"
,tnana,2010-03-11T10:25Z,"hey there thanks for the upload. i have tried almost everything mentioned, including installing the 6.0.3 update. doesnt seem to accept the crack file. it still shows as a txt file instead of an executable in the mac os folder. uninstalled reinstalled, no luck. even tried to figure out how to change preferences in terminal, but couldnt find a way to do it. i have osx 10.4, so please can someone come up with a crack?



For Mac Users:
If you want to reset yhe 15 days limit you should erase the next invisible files:

1. T4 at /Library/Preferences/

2. Manuscript paper list,Plugin list,T2,UWx Notifier at /Library/Application Support/Sibelius Software/Siblius 6/ _manuscript/

3. STLL Notifier at /Application/

4. T3 at /Users/youraccount/Library/Application Support/Sibelius Software/Sibelius 6/_manuscript/

I know this is a partial solution but it could help in the mean time, while te keygen is out.

(i was browsing through other forums and i found out the information mentioned above, so cheers to the dude who put up the info)"
