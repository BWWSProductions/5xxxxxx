,FlankerB1,2009-12-27T17:46Z,Isn't this movie originally almost 2 hours long?
,FlankerB1,2009-12-27T17:47Z,edit: 124 mins - a bit over 2 hours

,frankburnz,2010-09-30T17:20Z,"This is stupid, there is like 10 minutes of Russian or Ukrainian dialog.  No subtitles is crap. "
,sinctykid,2010-12-16T06:26Z,I became a member JUST so I could let Akamaru know that this is a GREAT upload. I saw that there were supposed to be embedded subs during the non-English parts but was not present in the final result. This is one of my FAVORITE movies...could you please re-upload with the subs in tow?
,ro4eva,2010-12-18T01:43Z,"I had to take the time to make and release proper subs for this torrent (english and foreign parts).

You can download it here - http://subscene.com/english/the-sum-of-all-fears/subtitle-361243.aspx"
,ro4eva,2010-12-18T01:51Z,"Also, this release is 124 minutes (the length of the theatrical release) and not 82 minutes as the notes say.

You'll be able to properly enjoy this film in its entirety by downloading the subtitles which I posted to the link to in my previous post.

I was quite frustrated myself after downloading this release when I found out that the foreign dialogue subtitles were not included.

Then I became even more frustrated when I couldn't find proper subtitles.  Alas, I took some time to create proper subs and really enjoyed the film after I understood more than half of it."
