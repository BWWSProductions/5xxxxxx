,lg1991,2009-10-22T22:08Z,"Thanks mate. 
I think  cracks made for about version 0.751 and above work on all versions, but this is one ive never had any problems with. "
,darklordofspawn,2009-11-21T10:14Z,"i wonder who made the crack, cuz warband will eventually come out and i wonder if the same guy will crack it again "
,borgboy0,2009-11-28T01:13Z,"when I try to start the uniloader it says ""Found Offsets. Please restart loader"" it never works  please help"
,trunkki,2009-11-28T17:14Z,"IT doesnt say ""file already exists do you want to replace it?"" when I copy and paste that uniloader to my mount & blade folder. Shoud it do that? Or what do you mean by that step 3: Click the option ""Copy and replace""? And that serial AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA is not working. It says the serial is inactive. Please help :)"
,lg1991,2009-11-28T23:05Z,"Strange. Are you using XP or Vista/

Try right clicking and run as administrator

Step 3,may not be necessary. 

The serial, make sure you dont enter it into the first serial box, go to manual activation, then enter it. If it doesnt work, try turning caps lock on/off.

Let me know how you get on."
,trunkki,2009-11-29T03:08Z,"I'm using XP. I have Mount&Blade version 1.011, it looks like they have removed that manual activation button from it:

Is there any way to do this then? :("
,trunkki,2009-11-29T03:09Z,EDIT: Yeah first I entered the serial in the first box. Thats why it didn't work :)
,lg1991,2009-11-29T14:49Z,"Cool, is it working now then?"
,darklordofspawn,2009-12-17T03:03Z,"@trunkki
they said they removed the manual activation from the ""retail version of M&B 1.00""
the download if different there is only 1.003 and 1.011
this crack should still work im gonna test it out"

,asuperfatguy,2010-12-09T04:25Z,"I start the game with the uniloader, the start menu pops up, I hit play and an error comes up saying ""get_object failed for texture:""   Anyway to fix this?"
