,Bjorkved,2009-08-31T11:23Z,As sammy6nips said: i think the bay is just a little fucked up at the moment and show no seeders on alot of torrents. 
,icecoldcanadian7,2009-09-07T03:18Z,"I've wasted 4 CDs on this game and got the ""disc is unreadable"" screen. First 3 discs were DL memorex (worked for me in the past) then tried DL verbatim, and still no luck. abgx doesn't pick up any corruption and passes the stealth test. I burnt the .dvd file at 2.4x speed using imgburn. So wtf is wrong?! "
,dildosaur,2009-09-11T20:13Z,icecoldcanadian7: Are you sure your verbatims are 2-2.4x ? and not 8x?

THANX!"
,Smuggles,2010-01-09T13:04Z,"Hey guys if you're having problems burning, here:


First extract the files you get, then download abgx360 and run it with the iso/stealth file in that folder.
when that's done open up imgburn and burn your disk at either 2.4x or 4x, no more or no less at first unless you feel confident your burner can handle it.
use verbatim dual layer dvds, others may work just as fine but its better to be sure than waste money.
Also remember, your burner may be old and may be the one doing the damage, not the dvd's.
I burn games at 4X and they work perfectly."
,360USER,2010-03-15T18:27Z,"all you people having problems should learn more about your hacked xbox. your getting the unreadable message BECAUSE YOUR FIRMWARE IS OUT OF DATE. NOTHING TO DO WITH BURN SPEED DISCS BLAH BLAH. ALL NEW GAMES WILL NEED EITHER AN OLD UNSTEALTH FIRMWARE WHICH YOU CANNOT PLAY ON LIVE WITH OR THE NEW IEXTREME 1.5 IF YOU HAVE A HITACHI DRIVE, 1.6 FOR SAMMY'S AND BENQ AND FOR LITEONS YOU NEED IEXTREME LT. if you dont know what i mean take it back to whoever flashed it for you and give them more cash to update it. you might also want to try the activation disc too but dont go on live unless you want banning "
,JTAGpope,2010-03-20T02:56Z,ur a bunch of leeching fucks. the xbox community here is such ballz. You all just download then deleat the torrent. I have uploaded 7.5Gigs and have only downloaded 33%. I dont care cause im using my school internet so I seed the shit out of it. But some of you fucks make it near impossible to download games.
