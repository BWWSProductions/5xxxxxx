You can find a B744 CBT in Emule.
That's a Atlas Cargo B744 Cbt.
Do you have any CBT or Training manual about B737-200 "

,drownzak,2009-09-12T05:01Z,What is this used for?? :O
,b737-500,2009-09-12T11:24Z,"It is used during the ground training for learning the airplane systems, before you go to your simulator training"

Maybe, we could see each other at Stockholm,
at simulator.
By the way, any information about JJ1809?"
,b737-500,2009-09-13T04:11Z,"Velibor
I am not due for a proficiency check for some time, so I won't be going to simulator any time soon.
I have no idea about new jeppview updates. They come irregulary lately"

You need to change the parameter startdir in the Run737_500.ini

default is d: but if your cd has a different drive letter you need to change it to that. >Run the cbt from the file Run737_500.exe.

It only works in 32 bit windows.

-> B737-500 I am looking for the B737 NG from Lufthansa, you don't happen to have that one ?"
,pilot320200,2011-02-12T05:37Z,"2 ps767:

Just mount the image. Then open it and copy 737-500 folder to your hard drive and try to run executable file from there. I think it should help."
,Acer5738ZG,2012-06-06T10:21Z,Does this only work with in 32 bit windows?
