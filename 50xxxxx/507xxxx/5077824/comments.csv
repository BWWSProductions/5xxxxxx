Thank you very much.

So, this is the SACD version, right ?

""...files bitrate at 1024 kBit/s""

I guess you don't understand how FLAC encodes a file. Because you select 1024 kBit/s does not mean the tracks will have 1024 kBit/s.

Here's a capture of your album in foobar2000, none of the tracks have the same kBit/s and none of them have 1024 kBit/s by the way.

I had the same discussion here with a user, I can't remember his name but I hope you're not that user...

Take care,

,THEIRLAW,2012-06-28T06:53Z,"Hello.  Many thanks for the fantastic share.  I was curious, does anyone have the updated remasters?
According to wikipedia:
Re-releases
In 1998, Love You Live was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and in 2010, was re-released with an updated remastering by Universal Records. In 2011 it was released on a single SHM-SACD by Universal Music Enterprises Japan.


Best regards"
