Live-album.

Love You Live is a double live album by The Rolling Stones, released in 1977. The album is drawn from Tour of the Americas shows in the United States in the summer of 1975, Tour of Europe shows in 1976 and performances from the infamous El Mocambo nightclub concert venue in Toronto in 1977. It is the band's third official full-length live release.

The album was overdubbed and mixed from late May to mid-June 1977; it features Billy Preston and Ian Stewart on piano. Love You Live's artwork was prepared by Andy Warhol, and the pencil smears seen across the front were added to Warhol's dismay by Mick Jagger. Released in September 1977, the album was well-received and managed to reach #3 in the UK and #5 in the US, where it went gold.

In 1998, Love You Live was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records.

Live-album.

Still Life" (American Concert 1981) is a live album by The Rolling Stones and was released in 1982. Recorded during the band's American Tour 1981 in the latter portion of that year, it was released in time for their European Tour 1982 continuation the following summer.

The album was preceded by their cover of The Miracles' "Going to a Go-Go", which became a Top 30 hit in the UK and US, while follow-up single, "Time Is on My Side" managed to reach the lower part of the UK charts.

Still Life (American Concert 1981) was a commercial success, reaching #4 in the UK and #5 in the US, going platinum there, but was not critically well-received, being admonished for sounding too slick and lacking any rough edges expected in a Rolling Stones performance. Of particular chagrin to Rolling Stones fans was the fact that nearly half of the Hampton Coliseum rendition of "Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)" was edited out for the release.

In 1998, "Still Life" (American Concert 1981) was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records.

CD â€˜Flashpointâ€™ (Rolling Stones Records 468135 2).

Live-album (most songs were edited and overdubbed) and two additional studio tracks.

Flashpoint is a live album by British rock band The Rolling Stones. It was released in 1991, having been recorded throughout 1989 and 1990 on the mammoth Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour. It was the first live album by the group since 1982's "Still Life" (American Concert 1981).

Flashpoint was recorded across North America, Europe and Japan, Flashpoint is also the first Rolling Stones release of the 1990s and, unlike previous live sets, is bolstered by the appearance of two exclusive new studio tracks: "Highwire" and "Sex Drive"; the former was released as a single earlier in 1991 and was a comment on the Gulf War.

Although the live selections are mostly familiar hits mixed in with new tracks from Steel Wheels, Flashpoint does offer up a few obscure songs: "Factory Girl" from 1968's Beggars Banquet and "Little Red Rooster", originally a #1 UK hit single in 1964 featured here with special guest Eric Clapton on guitar.

Flashpoint was also The Rolling Stones' final release under their Sony Music contract, with the band signing a long-term and lucrative worldwide deal with Virgin Records in 1991â€”where they remain presentlyâ€”all, that is, but Bill Wyman. After thirty years with the band, the 55-year-old Wyman decided that he had other interests he wanted to pursue and felt that the size of the Steel Wheels project and tour was fitting to bow out with. Although he would not officially announce his departure until January 1993 during which time the rest of the band repeatedly asked him to reconsiderâ€”he had talked about leaving the band for at least ten years. After his departure, Ronnie Wood was finally taken off salary and made a full member of the Rolling Stones partnership, 18 years after he joined the band.

Flashpoint was released in April 1991 and was generally well-receivedâ€”with "Highwire" becoming a rock radio hitâ€”and managed to reach #6 in the UK[citation needed] and #16 in the US[citation needed] where it went gold.

Two songsâ€”"Rock and a Hard Place" and "Can't Be Seen"â€”were only included on the CD version.

In 1998, Flashpoint was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records.
