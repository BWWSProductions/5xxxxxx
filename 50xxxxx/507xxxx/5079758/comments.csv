,Grifter02,2010-01-08T21:04Z,"You start by saying ""It is untouched Xp sp3"" and then you go on to say all the ways you altered it. I'm not sure what your definition of ""untouched"" is, but it's certainly not the same as the rest of the world. :P

un?touched
?adjective
remaining in a pristine state; unchanged."
