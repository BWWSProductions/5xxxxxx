Shanna the She-Devil is a jungle adventuress in the Marvel Comics universe. Created by writers Carole Seuling and Steve Gerber and penciler George Tuska, she made her first appearance in Shanna the She-Devil #1 (Dec. 1972).

Shanna O'Hara Plunder is the daughter of a diamond miner named Gerald O'Hara. Born in Africa, she spent the majority of her childhood growing up in the jungles of Zaire. She then moves back to the United States and grows up to become an accomplished Olympic athlete, specializing in competitive swimming and track and field. She then became a licensed veterinarian.  Shanna then moves to the Dahomey Reserve in Africa.
While in Africa, Shanna becomes more attuned to nature, patrolling the jungle and living freely in the wild lands.  In the jungle, Shanna becomes more and more at home with herself and her new native element, all the while protecting the reserve from poachers as Shanna the She-Devil.

This initial series ran five issues (Dec. 1972 - Aug. 1973), with Jim Steranko drawing the covers of #1-2.  Shanna then starred in a solo feature in the black-and-white adventure-comics magazine Savage Tales #9-10 (March & May 1975), in stories by writers Gerry Conway and Carla Conway, with art by the collective pseudonym The Tribe for the first story, and by the former series' team of Andru & Colletta for the second. She also appeared in a backup story in The Rampaging Hulk by Steve Gerber that introduced her psychologist. It was the lead-in to a story that went unpublished and partially uncompleted until the penultimate four issues of Marvel Fanfare in the early 1990s.
