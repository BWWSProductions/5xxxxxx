Plot:
After a teen's premonition of a deadly race-car crash helps saves the lives of his peers,
Death sets out to collect those who evaded their end.

Notes:
Combined the The.Final.Destination.CAM2009.THS vid with the very nice FaTaL Direct audio.
I adjusted the colors abit sharpened pic a touch, and removed a
very light hiss from the audio, raised the db's and added a bit of bass.
