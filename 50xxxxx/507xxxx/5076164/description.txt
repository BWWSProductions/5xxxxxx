Are you a database administrator who wants to add design and development skills to your toolkit? Then this CBT Nuggets SQL Server 2008 Exam-Pack 70-450 training pack is for you.

SQL Server 2008 brings you lots of terrific features. Shared server-wide management capability allows you to automate processes, schedule tasks and set performance alerts. Plus you can edit and insert code and run reports.

Trainer Don Jones begins his video series with the basics: SQL terminology, how relational databases work, how they store and retrieve data and the fundamentals of the T-SQL language. Then he teaches you how to install, migrate, upgrade and consolidate your data from previous SQL versions to 2008 SQL Server. Plus, he shows you how some of the â€œhandyâ€ tips and tricks you may have used in earlier versions of SQL can trip you up in SQL Server 2008.

Donâ€™s training covers SQL Server management studio â€” SQL Server 2008â€™s all-in-one interface â€” and SQL Server Configuration Manager â€” which gives you complete control over all SQL Server 2008 Services. It also covers plenty of other advanced features, including:

* Installation, verifying and launching Server Management tools

* Instance and Object Security Authentication

* Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

* High Availability Overview, clustering, failover and replication

* Backup, restore and testing recovery models

Once youâ€™ve finished the series, youâ€™ll be installing and managing SQL Server 2008 in a variety of situations. As a result of this training youâ€™ll:

* increase your database reliability

* optimize your database security

* enhance the overall performance of your databases
