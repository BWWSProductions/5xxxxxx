UpdatePatrol is a tool that works invisibly on your PC, quietly monitoring the Internet for you. When changes to your tracked sites are detected, you are politely notified that websites that interest you have been updated. You can view the updated pages with changes highlighted in UpdatePatrol's built-in web browser - see an example here. UpdatePatrol has a user friendly interface but still plenty of advanced features that will satisfy both novice and power users. UpdatePatrol supports HTML, XML, RSS, RDF, Atom and text files and can access them both using normal HTTP and HTTPS (SSL).
