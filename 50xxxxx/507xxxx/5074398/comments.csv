,kmacabre,2009-09-01T04:09Z,"This film is pretty much Hostel meets Ernest goes to camp! Don't waste your time! It's a carbon copy of hostel but on a passenger train. I wonder what the film makers of this will tackle next? The grudge on an airplane? The texas chainsaw massacre on a vegan commune?
The acting is a joke. The DP/directer/editer are sub amateur. The dialogue is stiff, uninventive, and poorly executed. The hook of the film which was somewhat shocking in hostel is actually more based in reality but bizarrely less believable in Train. What else can I say except that the film-maker must have been infatuated with Hostel which to me is sort of sad. You'd be better off laying in bed and smelling your own farts all night..."
