The Maya of Eternal Time. 2012 and Beyond
Live Interactive Webcast from Hungary July 29, 2009

Hosted by Drunvalo Melchizedek

The Maya have not spoken a single word of prophecy in 527 years, and on this day, July 29th, I have been allowed to directly report from the National Mayan Council of Elders of Guatemala and the head of the Mayan Nation Don Alejandro Cirilo Perez Oxlaj on their beliefs of the Mayan Calendar around the date of December 21, 2012, which is different than what the world has been reporting.

I will also be reporting on the Mayan Prophecy of the beginning of the Mayan people to reclaim their knowledge, experiences, wisdom, and memories from the last 13,000 years and the stories of this experience. The Maya lost a great deal of their knowledge when the Spanish Conquistadors ravaged the Mayan nation. But the Maya had a secret way of returning this knowledge to fulfill their prophecy.

We are less than three and a half years away from this great Mayan Prophecy, and what is about to be reported is extraordinary and something that everyone on Earth needs to know for it is going to effect every last man, woman and child on Earth if the Mayan Prophecy is correct.

The Mayan Calendar predicts a window of time around this date of December 21, 2012 called THE END OF TIME, and so you know, we are now inside of this window of time. We are living now inside THE END OF TIME.

I will be reporting from Hungary on the internet, and it will be live and interactive, so you will be able to ask questions and hear and see my reply. There will be three broadcasts to fit the times of the world and the web cast will be in several languages. Please go to www.onelotus.net if you wish to sign up for this web cast.

May your heart reconnect with the Heart of the Earth, the Heart of the Sun and the Heart of the Universe, for this is the Mayan way to survive what is about to happen.
