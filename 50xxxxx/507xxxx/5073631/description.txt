Storyline: BrÃ¼no is a gay Austrian fashion guru. He has his own fashion based television show, 
Funkyzeit, the most popular German-language show of its kind outside of Germany. After he disgraces himself in front of his Funkyzeit 
fan base, he is ruined in German speaking Europe. He decides that in his quest for worldwide fame, he will move to Los Angeles and 
reinvent himself. Accompanying him to the US is Lutz, his former assistant's assistant. Lutz is the only person left in his circle 
that still believes in BrÃ¼no's greatness. BrÃ¼no goes through one reinvention of himself after another, ultimately straying to areas 
far removed from his own self. Perhaps when BrÃ¼no finds an activity that he truly does love, he will also find that Ã¼ber-fame he so 
desperately desires.
