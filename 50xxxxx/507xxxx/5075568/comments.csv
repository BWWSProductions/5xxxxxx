,andycham3000,2009-09-07T13:08Z,"all keygen for xyplorer v8.20 and upward no longer work, they have lengthened the serial by 4 bytes. 
There is however a working patch that will enable you to use any username and serial. 
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/andy.chambers/xyplorer-patch.exe created by me, thanks to PGTeam for the original patch for 8.30.0000, my patch works for both 8.30.0000 and 8.30.0002 and should work for newer versions as they come out, or until a working keygen is written. "
,Killbill21,2009-09-07T17:57Z,"I tested this on my Trash and bash PC.  Installed some AntiVirus scam crap.  Not sure if it was the Keygen or the app itself?  It disabled my Melwarebytes AntiVirus software, Firefox and other Windows apps.  I had to restore the PC to get it off.  

Did you test this by installing it yourself?"
,JPeterson,2009-09-20T15:43Z,"Thanks for the crack andycham3000. It seems to work. I scanned it with the latest Microsoft Security Essentials and it found no threats in it. It seems legit. andycham3000, is there a forum that you visit sometimes where I could possibly pm you about future versions of this program?"
