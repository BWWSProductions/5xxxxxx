Christina Milian stars as sassy cheer captain Lina Cruz, whose 

world is turned upside-down when her family moves from the 

urban streets of East Los Angeles to the sunny beach town of 

Malibu. At her new school, Lina clashes with Avery, the ultra-

competitive all-star cheer captain, while also falling for 

Avery's super-cute brother, Evan. Lina's always been able to 

rise to a challenge, but can she create a new all-star squad, 

beat Avery at the Spirit Championships, and still keep her 

romance with Evan?
