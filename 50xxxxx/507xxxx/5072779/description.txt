Artist: Mirrored Theory ( Jakeos2 from yuotube)



Just recently stumbled upon this guys' music and it's actually quite awesome! The only versions of the songs were on yuotube, however I did try to search elsewhere. I decided to "rip" them from yuotube as best I could and they turned out great imho. I recommend the songs "The Cleansing" and "Girls in Neon". :)


"The Cleansing"

"Girls in Neon"

"This winter's almost over"
