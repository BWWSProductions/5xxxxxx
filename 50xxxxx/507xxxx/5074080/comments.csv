,willygofar,2009-09-29T23:04Z,"Came as a shock that film is a silent movie, should have realised based on 1922 date, however it is a rarity and depicts the 'real-life' of 'unfortunates' based on Dickens' experience within the Rochester & Medway area.
A must for die-hard fans, however if you just want a family film for you and the kids then it's not for you.
Thankyou for uploading Sheila6
