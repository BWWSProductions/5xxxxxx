[V],Kuthumi,2009-08-28T20:05Z,"Because PirateBay's tracker has been down for several days, I uploaded this torrent first at Demonoid. It is already well established with several seeders and an average swarm speed of 80 kB/sek.
Tip: If your settings were working OK before the tracker went down, you should NOT start to mess around with your settings even if most of your torrents show red; it will not help. All of them will turn green again as soon as the tracker is working. Azureus/Vuze may have to be restarted to re-establish the connections."

[V],Kuthumi,2009-09-08T11:35Z,"Thanks, 'gellpad'. I have to take back my advice on the tracker. PirateBay has made it clear that the old trackers with address to thepiratebay.org will NOT be reinstated. Instead, they have added 
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce
to all their torrents, and this is working.
If you have older torrents, you check (in Azureus) by right-clicking it, then Advanced>Tracker>Edit and check if the new tracker is there. If not, choose ""Add tracker"" with the same option."
