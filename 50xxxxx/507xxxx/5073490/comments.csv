During that time, I read comments from encouragement to comments of people telling me I was a sinner.  It was both a sad and tragic realization for me to accept that those people didn't know the love of Christ, and as often is the case, lashed out against a beliver such as myself.

Here on Pirate Bay, I call myself ""Torrent Tracts"" for a reason.  Even if just one of these many songs touches your heart, and makes you think of God for a brief moment in your sometimes way too busy day, then glory falls where glory always belongs - On our precious Lord.

Blessed are those that are able to reach out to others in the name of Christ Jesus, and not be afraid to do so.  I consider myself extremely blessed to be able to do that, even just a little bit, here on Pirate Bay.  So I decided to come back and share a few more albums this weekend, three months after my hiatus."

I'll ty to upload some of mine....music is for free just like grace :)

stay blessed
