,icecoldcanadian7,2009-09-06T19:57Z,"Can anybody confirm if this works? I've wasted 4 CDs on this game and got the ""disc is unreadable screen"". First 3 discs were memorex (worked for me in the past) then tried verbatim, and still no luck. abgx also doesn't pick up at corruption and passes the stealth test. So wtf is wrong?!"
