,SD-B,2009-11-26T02:37Z,"Can anyone suggest what to do if after installing APERTURE a few days later i am told it has an update? Best to ignore it? Or if I do update it will i likely be locked out and unable to use it??
Thanks....."
,roskruge,2010-01-09T19:50Z,"My experience is if you get an app' to work with a 'pirate' serial No. and you are then 'offered' an update, update works with same serial No. you are not asked to put in serial No. again. But if you go to web site and get update you will be asked for serial No."
