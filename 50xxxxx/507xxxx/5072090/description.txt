Follow these simple instructions.



- Disconnect from internet (until activation is finished)
- Start the setup (Download a trial Corel Draw x4 from corel.com or other way)
- At installation choose "I have a serial number" and generate a key with the keygen
- At the setup click on "Options" and deselect "Product updates"

  copy the hardware code to keygen and paste the unlockcode from keygen back to
  the app - voila!


NOTE: When install is running, keep keygen open and dont press generate a new serial,
      because the hardwarecode depends on the installation serial.
      Copy the hardwarecode without "-" to the keygen.
      For example, if your hardwarecode is: XXDW-IXV1-RN0I-3EUH-2U48 then copy
                                            XXDWIXV1RN0I3EUH2U48 to the keygen
