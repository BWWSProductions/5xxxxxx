,Acswaggr,2011-02-26T11:43Z,Awesooome! What is the bitrate on this??
,neuroxik,2011-03-31T03:32Z,"@Acswaggr : The bitrate, it's hard to say exactly cuz it's VBR, but it sticks pretty much between 192-320 kbs VBR. As for the old songs, they didn't have hi-fi systems at the time so often 192 kbs suffices. I usually download 320kbs or FLAC but this is pretty good for the content"
