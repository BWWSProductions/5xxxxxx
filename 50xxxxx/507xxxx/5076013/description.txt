This is a 1:1 rip of the 1999 PC Game Civilization: Call to Power. 

It was produced by Activision who had licenced the Civilization name - aside from that its development was independent of the traditional Civilization series.

Newer Operating Systems:

I've run this game on Windows XP, XP 64-bit, Vista 64-bit, and 7 64-bit without any issues on several desktop computers of mine - however for whatever reason on two of my laptops running Windows XP the game refuses to start unless it is run in Windows 95 or 98 compadibility mode. Try this if the game gives you trouble.

Widescreen Support:

The game has native support for widescreen resolutions - I've tested 1280 x 720 and 1680 x 1050 personally. The UI simply stays the same size regardless of resolution and more is shown on the gameplay area in higher resolutions. 

Unfortunately, if run in 95/98 compadibility mode on XP/Vista/7, the widescreen resolutions no longer appear as options. 

Dual Monitor Problems:

I've read some postings that mention game will refuse to start if dual monitors are enabled. I can't confirm this personally, but if this seems to be the case for you, try enabling only one. 

Enjoy!
