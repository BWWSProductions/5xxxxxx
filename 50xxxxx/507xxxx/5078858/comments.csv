,jmillay,2009-09-11T05:16Z,No response to that comment?
,biddaddy,2009-10-19T13:48Z,"Thanks for the info. I was interested in this until I saw the virus warning. If it is a virus why does he have a pink skull? why has he not commented? Why is it still available for download?

I always leave positive comments when the uploader has done good work. This download seems a great concern."
