,LokeAs,2009-09-05T23:11Z,"Nice efford, but forgive me, I can't help myself, saying that this guy to me is the ""archtype"" of selfabsorbed and shallow ""conmen"" - sweet and pretentious to his victims, and closeminded gossipal to his audiences. - Disgusted of him acting like he is an actual intellectual, but showing nothing but sleaziness, stupidity and utterly moronic POVs.

Pass me the sickness-bag, please.  "
,SplinterFaction,2009-09-07T10:28Z,"I think he generally comes to a subject very open minded and makes friends with people who are normally considered too weird or undesirable to tolerate.
His themes are all about popular perception of what is 'weird', why people feel that way and exploring what makes these people be weird in the first place.

I can see how he can be seen as a conman, but to call him shallow, particularly in the face of such subjects that other documentarians dare not touch with a 20yeard pole, and closeminded are so far of the mark I fear that you are completely missing the value and point of his cinema vĂŠritĂŠ approach.

I know he is not for everyone but personally, as a fellow documentary producer, I admire him very much."
,JoakimCh,2009-09-23T23:48Z,"Thanks! 
I love this guy and I do not agree with LokeAs... Louis Theroux really knows how to make interesting documentaries."
,lostboy69,2009-09-24T14:31Z,"Hey LokeAs, get a life or get laid, your sounding like an asshole."
,GlobalPunditOrg,2009-12-12T01:00Z,"awesome job and thanks, as always, for sharing the documentary goodness!

,Alex79uk,2010-01-19T12:22Z,Thanks for the upload! Been looking for a collection of all his stuff for ages! Nice one :)
,nagelfar77,2010-01-24T07:10Z,"Thanks a lot for the good work mate! 

Though I do have to say that I don't encourage journalists like Louis that are travelling around criticising people with ideologies other than or opposing to their own world view instead of just portraying them in a neutral and objective way so viewers can form their own opinion about it."
,redox1,2010-03-04T11:22Z,"I like that in his documentaries you get to see his natural reactions: In effect he and his culture are under the microscope as much as his subjects.
He is quite strange himself and its fun to see how people react to him, an apparently 'normal' person. It'd be hilarious taking him on a tour of my world.

Many thanks for the compilation"
,antmartain,2010-03-12T10:55Z,Good compilation. Lots of skipping VHS tape nostalgia....I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
,SplinterFaction,2010-04-19T15:35Z,"Ladys and gents, thank you all so much for your interest in this torrent but I am putting it to bed now.

I will never be seeding this torrent again as there is now a NEW LOUIS THEROUX DOCUMENTARY to add to the collection.

The new complete collection, with latest episode 'America's Medicated Kids', can be found here:

Thanks so much, enjoy and SEED!"

,paprika69,2011-01-30T11:27Z,"its incredable or amazing how few people know that the jewish control the media in Europe BBC as well as in america. The rewrite slowly but surely the history by Hollywood and media. People wake up, they own the media. If you dont believe that based on conditionized colonized learning, do some serious research.
Its starts early in scool already. "
,paprika69,2011-01-30T11:32Z,"and yes Louis Theroux is Jewish. And yes only they get freepass to some delicate matters that other journalists dont get. I really wonder if Mr. Theroux actually have a degree r even background in journalistics or just those strong connections :mentioned"" above."
,drewsberry,2011-03-04T02:15Z,"@paprika69
Well, Louis has a first class degree in modern history from Oxford and has been a write for ""Spy"" magazine, a writer for a Californian newspaper and a correspondent on ""TV Nation"", so... Yeah.

Great torrent, just downloading now
Thank you SplinterFaction!"
,paprika69,2011-03-21T18:24Z,"Hahahaha Very substansive. Just what we need. People who look the other way.
Be Lived my friend!"
,kezwar,2011-04-04T20:43Z,"@Paprika, he's an Atheist and comes from a Catholic family you deluded fool."
,SCBacon,2011-04-26T18:56Z,"@LokeAs
He asks the questions that no-one else dares to.

He pokes his stick in the uncomfortableness and waits for the other person to break and show a weakness, no matter how small.

He is honest."
,PiraatBae,2011-08-29T06:13Z,"Great collection, but unfortunately woefully out of order.  Theroux's work is comprised of three series of Weird Weekends, two series of When Louis Met (these are in order except for Living with Louis which you have listed elsewhere) and 8 years of BBC Two Specials.  For those interested in viewing these documentaries in order, consult:

,hckrwolf,2011-09-19T02:37Z,"great pack, but it needs to be updated.

the only problem ive run into so far is that ""Infomercials"" seems to be a VHS rip and has alot of audio and video skipping. I suppose its still watchable, but it can get pretty annoying."
,charliebrowne,2012-05-06T11:22Z,seed you cunts
,bigwigg,2012-05-12T10:05Z,Thx a lot.
