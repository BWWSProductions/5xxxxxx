,lazyjay702,2010-02-01T15:31Z,"THIS ISNT THE FIRM!! ('88 movie about crazy football fans) 

I downloaded this and it turned out to be ""give em hell malone"", but a messed up version. 
It froze and kept skipping huge chunks until the end. I tried different players but all the same result. I believe the file was broken. 

Anyway, my computer was running real slow and now I can't do anything with it until my friend comes over to check it out. (on my laptop)
DO NOT DOWNLOAD"

is a lying cunt. It is The Firm from 1988 with Gary Oldman. "
