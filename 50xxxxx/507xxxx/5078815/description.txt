In his final masterpiece Alan Clarke, of Scum and Made in Britain fame, tackles the subject of football hooliganism both deftly and precisely and exposes the unique structures of the hooligan fraternity. 

If Made in Britain is Clarke's finest and Scum is Clarke's most infamous, this has to be his most underrated. Totally convincing, Clarke shows a true understanding of both his subject matter and of the medium in general. Using the documentary style to a devastated effect, the film has a feeling of utter truth. Gary Oldman in particular conveys an extraordinary performance of raw power as the chief hooligan. 



Enjoy and Seed!!
