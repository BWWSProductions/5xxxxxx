This is the 2005 movie Batman Begins (staring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Morgan Freeman, etc.) ripped from a Blu Ray and converted down to 720p (since 1080p movies are hella big.)  This was ripped from a disc in the USA, for what that's worth.  Included are all the audio and subtitle tracks found on the disc which are...

Audio (all of which should be full 5.1 surround sound):

Subtitles:
English
French (FranÃ§ais)

This was converted using RipBot264, tsMuxeR GUI, BDSuptoSub, and other tools.

Since this is a huge file, I ask that you please help me seed it (at least seed to 1.0 ratio!)
