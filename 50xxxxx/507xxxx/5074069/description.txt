Plot: Mum & Dad, the impressive debut feature by writer-director Steven Sheil, is one of the most disturbing Brit-shockers to emerge in recent years. When Lena, a young Polish immigrant working as an office cleaner at Heathrow Airport, misses her last bus home, she accepts an offer of help from friendly co-worker Birdie, who lives nearby with her â€˜adoptiveâ€™ parents. Knocked unconscious after arriving at the house, Lena soon finds herself imprisoned in a suburban House of Horrors, a living nightmare of abuse, torture and murder. Designated a â€˜Mummyâ€™s Girlâ€™, Lenaâ€™s only options appear to be to become part of the family - and join Mum and Dad in their insanity - or die.
