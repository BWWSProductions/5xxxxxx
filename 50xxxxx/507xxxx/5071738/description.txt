Synopsis
The work of Luciano Pavarotti has delighted music fans across the globe, with his unique vocal style crossing over to attract listeners from outside the usual opera crowd. This release combines three works from the inimitable singer, including...
PAVAROTTI IN CENTRAL PARK - One of the three most famous tenors in the world, Luciano Pavarotti had a voice that could shake all of New York City. And it surely shook all of Central Park on the night that the star performed in 1993. Pavarotti was ably backed by members of the New York Philharmonic as he belts out dozens of classical and traditional tunes ranging from Verdi's LA TRAVIATA to Duke Ellington's 'It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)'.
PAVAROTTI 30TH ANNIVERSARY GALA CONCERT - On April 29, 1991, Pavarotti celebrated the 30th anniversary of his stage debut with a concert at the Teatro Valli in Reggio Emilia. Includes arias from 'Tosca', 'Don Giovanni', 'L'Elisir D'Amore', 'La Boheme', 'La Favorita' and others.
PAVAROTTI AND LEVINE IN RECITAL - Accompanied by Metropolitan Opera maestro James Levine on grand piano, Pavarotti performs operatic arias and popular art songs, including works by Rossini, Bellini and his signature song from the World Cup, Puccini's 'Nessun Dorma' from Turandot.
