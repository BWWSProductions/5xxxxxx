,erikphnx,2009-09-04T19:20Z,I do not remember the band Roman Holiday but I do remember seeing that album cover displayed in a record store.  I am looking forwards to checking this out. Thank you.
,erikphnx,2009-09-04T19:22Z,"Would anyone by any chance have their hands on a copy of the Marlon Jackson album ""Baby Tonight"" ? It was released 1987 I believe. I can not find it anywhere and it is excessively priced on used retail sites."
[V],neon,2009-09-04T20:21Z,"thanks very much,i have to hand it to you man your 80s torrents are second to none."
,Phavonic,2009-09-04T20:40Z,"Nice that you have what is requested...

But do you have anything else by Spoons, CCCP and Shoc Corridor that you haven't already posted? 

Also---Its a long shot but so many people are after 10cc Graham Gouldmans' ""Animalympics"" soundtrack as well (1980), ever come by it? The Rupert Hine tracks from ""Better Off Dead"" would be nice too. Tah"
[V],neon,2009-09-05T04:40Z,hello 80zforever have you any albums by young marble giants ?
[V],80zforever,2009-09-05T05:35Z,"catsout, see this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4440748/4_Rare_80s_Albums_[Part_19]_Post_Punk_Bands

phavonic, I have all Spoons records and some more shoc corridor. any specific record out of these you're looking for?"
[V],neon,2009-09-05T11:35Z,"thanks very much,i must have missed that one somehow... im working my way thru your rare hits of the 80s at the moment along with some of your rare albums..what a fantastic collection,truly one of the best uploaders on any site...and im not just sucking up,i mean it.  "
,Phavonic,2009-09-05T13:37Z,"Hi 80z,

The early stuff is the best, Stick Figure Neighbourhood, Arias and Symphonies, Talkback, Listen to the City. I don't know Shoc's discography so anything would be nice when you have the time. (I remember your two other uploads were best-ofs).

I'll look forward to anything you have with great thanks...I've gone though all the rest !! :)"
,JonYo,2009-09-06T13:00Z,"Neat, Oxo AND Roman Holliday!  I only know ""Whirly Girl"" by Oxo and ""Stand By"" by Roman Holliday, but they are definitely similar neo-swing things going on there.  Never knew why Roman Holliday spelled their name that way with 2 L's, hmm.

On a dorky personal note: I have a friend I occasionally call ""Whirly Girl"" even though she was born the same year it came out and isn't at all familiar with the song.

On a techy note: Hey meeester 80s, is it me or is Pirate Bay sort of falling apart now?  I didn't notice until just now that all my TPB RSS feeds have died which usually let me know when you drop a torrent, as rss.thepiratebay.org doesn't responds anymore.  Also, and more importantly to preserving the 80s awesomeness for everyone, when seeding back your torrents lately I often get errors saying things like ""torrent is not registered"" or other things which cause my seeding to totally stop.  I manually restart them when I notice they've stopped, but often they crap out again, maybe right away, or maybe after a few hours.  If others are having these problems (are they?  is it just me?) with seeding, I have to assume that your torrents will die and disappear muuuchmuch sooner than they ued to.  These problems have been popping with increasing frequency for me since around Part 71.  (I try to seed the last 10 or so most recent torrents of your ""4 are 80s Albums"" series continuously 24/7.)

So, I guess the bottom line is: Is it time to abandon TBP for greener pastures/trackers?  Or am I just talking out of my bum?"
[V],80zforever,2009-09-07T23:56Z,"JonYo, tpb trackers are offline. I used different trackers for the seed. same goes with tpb rss feed as their server is down. (the major isp provider of tpb was forced to pull the plug)."
,rendeveuz,2009-09-08T13:05Z,"Hi 80zForever.... Thanks for all your uploads.

I reaaly need your or other 80s freaks help!!!

I am looking for a song and artist I can't find the name of... you see a very big problem. BUT the song is so remarkable, for it's a kind of synth with a hole choir of cows who are yelling/sing the chorus... muuuhhhh.... First I thought it was Alan Parson... But know I have listen to all his songs without success. I really hope you can help me.

Let me know and please post it here, if anyone knows this song..."
,sparksie,2009-09-09T05:33Z,"80'z Thanks for the NEO A4, the OXO is great as well used to have the album (the red one). Still looking for Cafe Jacques if you have it  Cheers"
[V],80zforever,2009-09-11T02:50Z,"rendeveuz, I am sorry i have no clue to this song. "

Here you go:

,yuppefish,2009-10-05T01:53Z,"80z you rock! I said it once today but I mean it. You have opened up a whole world of music for me which I would have never been able to experience. Most of this stuff is just too obscure and hard to find for the average person who is just starting out - and only avail. on secondary markets.

you pretty much prove why file sharing is awesome."
,fizdude,2009-11-26T15:35Z,"I almost fainted with joy when I found this ... we LOVE Red 7 - you rock!! Thanks so much, you do an awesome job and please keep 'em coming."
,smurphyzeke,2011-03-05T01:16Z,Thanks
