 * An infamous day in the history of the Howard Stern show was the coverage
   of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City.  It started out
   as a normal day where Howard and the crew were discussing his sexual close
   encounter with Pamela Anderson.  The mood of the show goes from a fun time
   in the studio to a complete disaster of terrorist attacks and mass panic.
   Howard stayed on the air throughout the entire incident to give a real
   look and opinion on the attacks as well as raw emotion from those calling
   in to the show such as Crazy Cabby, Zolar, and Joey Boots.

   No other coverage compared to the extremely real emotion that was invoked
   by the cast and callers.  The crew was able to speculate and try and peice
   together the events to form some sort of opinion on what exactly was going
   on.  I remember this show very clearly as I am a New Yorker and was tuned 
   in this entire day.  The anger I felt was leveled by the true anger that
   Howard and the crew showed.  It was really a place to vent and feel more
   safe knowing that others were feeling the same way.
             
   This is a true testament to the importance of the Howard Stern Show and
   is probably one of the most drama filled days in the history of it.  No
   other show compared to the craziness that went on that day.  I remember
   that it took awhile before they actually aired this Howard TV episode
   because they certainly did not air it anytime soon after the actual day
   it all occured.  It's a great special and well put together and definitely
   is something all Stern fan's would love to see again.  If you never heard
   or saw this at all then you really need to see it!
