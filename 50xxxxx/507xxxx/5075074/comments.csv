,indiaman,2011-03-14T17:18Z,"Thanks for this collection as I am a Poirot fan.But I have to admit,I did not enjoy them as much as I hoped to.Maybe it's because I've seen the TV series  starring David Suchet, who has portrayed that role so perfectly that I don't think anybody is going to surpass that(very much like Jeremy Brett who has played Sherlock Holmes).Ironically ,David Suchet has played the role of Inspector Japp in ""Thirteen at Dinner"" in the above collection(which also has a young Bill Nighy of ""Underworld"" and ""Love Actually"" fame)."
