[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-02T17:32Z,"Heads up on 09-02-09: Two sources crapped out today - I already started my rip to encode to 128k VBR mp3 so I'm leaving it that way. If I rush I can get the 128k up by prolly 2:30 pm est - I'll do my best.

If I see a good source for the 64k around I'll up it before the 128k - if anyone else has it post it. Thanks people... "
