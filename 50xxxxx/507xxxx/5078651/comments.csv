,EnemyDrone,2009-09-04T20:55Z,Looked at the sample and it had a few line flickers going through it. .not sure if this is a screener or not. Will comment after d/l
,K1ller187,2009-09-04T21:25Z,"judging by the sample it looks more like a vhs screener or a good telesync!
V5 for a screener/V8 for a telesync
A7"

,Noppersz,2009-09-18T13:44Z,dont click koitesers' links. 
,bildivarian,2009-09-25T04:43Z,Might as well be a TS...
,rikoothekoop,2009-09-25T18:46Z,"Don't click koistesers links, they contain viruses. Mods please delete his links please."
,xiIix,2009-10-04T00:47Z,"Why can't someone take the fucking spanish screener and audio from a TS and give us a decent rip? I mean jesus, it's been forever since that spanish screener has been out, and noone has joined it with a TS yet?"
,PirateMario,2009-10-04T00:59Z,DON'T CLICK KOISTESERS LINKS

It's too long...we are waiting."
,TauTau154,2009-10-10T11:56Z,"I found a version of UP and everything, and to primal and jimmy, I watch it and the thing is: I think the book's in Swedish or Russian, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference (there's a book in the movie).  The thing is, the book plays a BIG part in the movie, but you can't read it if you're from the US basically. I WANT ENGLISH UP!  THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE FEW MOVIES I BUY! LOL."
,bigporch,2009-10-13T08:36Z,"Yeah they're doing something weird with the DVDrip of this. On Mininova there's a DVD rip (which you think would be out by now) that has 5000+ seeders, but the link's down, and is stayin down. They must be going all out to get this off all major torrent sites... But the stats were still live so 5000 people are seeding it, but from where / which tracker?? Probably something you need an invite to... BOO"
,Demosthenes928,2009-10-15T06:22Z,"@bigporch
Ummmm.... No?

The movie hasn't even been released on DVD yet, so I don't know where you're getting the idea that it has hit torrents yet. What you most likely saw a FAKE, sorta like when the DVDRip version of Watchmen by Axxo was released on Mininova a week after the movie came out. That torrent had over 1 million seeds before it got removed. The DVD of Up won't be released in the US until November 10th; the most we can hope for atm is an R5."
