Anyone has  SPIRIT - Clear 1969 rem

Thanks!"
,sundazed,2009-09-01T10:05Z,You've probably seen thewall68's upload at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5067095/Spirit-Clear(1969)(2006_SPV_Rem.)[EAC-FLAC]. It looks like the remaster too. It's extracted at level 8. Are you looking for zero compression?
[T],ecolo,2009-09-01T13:57Z,"Hum! sorry about that sundazed, I shoud have searched first (had a long day a bit tired) but yes if I have a choice always level 0.

Thanks!"
