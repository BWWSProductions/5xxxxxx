Plot: On what should have been a fun-filled day at the races, Nick Oâ€™Bannon has a horrific premonition in which a bizarre sequence of events causes multiple race cars to crash, sending flaming debris into the stands, brutally killing his friends and causing the upper deck of the stands to collapse on him. When he comes out of this grisly nightmare Nick panics, persuading his girlfriend, Lori, and their friends, Janet and Hunt, to leaveâ€¦escaping seconds before Nickâ€™s frightening vision becomes a terrible reality. Thinking theyâ€™ve cheated death, the group has a new lease on life, but unfortunately for Nick and Lori, it is only the beginning. As his premonitions continue and the crash survivors begin to die one-by-oneâ€“in increasingly gruesome waysâ€“Nick must figure out how to cheat death once and for all before he, too, reaches his final destination. The film marks the latest in the highly popular â€œFinal Destinationâ€ series, and its first 3D installment, giving horror fans an especially visceral thrill ride.
