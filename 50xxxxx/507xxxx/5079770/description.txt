A comedy about middle-aged Eddie and Joy, who are on day 8,743 of their marriage and have the battle scars to prove it. Their new next-door neighbors are young newlyweds Steph and Jeff - idealistic, passionate, adorable and married for all of 12 days.

It's a show about new marriage versus old marriage, about keeping the romance alive - or at least staying together so you have someone to drive you to the hospital for your operations. Eddie is a cynical realist who considers himself an expert on most topics. A high school history teacher, he's learned well the lessons of history and applies the basic principles to his marriage: all fights are about power, land and resources - and women love to kill fun.
