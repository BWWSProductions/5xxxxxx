Oh, and what is the password?
I had to guess and it seems to be:

trueblood"
,Sporkula,2009-09-04T21:18Z,"I was wrong, its one of those lame ""go to our web site to get the password"" piles of crap.
Don't waste your time on this one."
,Logostar,2009-09-04T22:18Z,"This ight be a stupid question, but how do u seed? Is it automatic or do u have 2 do something first?"
,GanjaTaz,2009-09-05T22:10Z,"Why bother with password protected shit that links to your shitty password sites when the real torrent will be up and seeded properly, idiot..."

,auguststaaf,2009-09-08T20:21Z,"hey, can someone help how to change to .rar?
I follow the steps but i canÂ´t find anything that says ""folder options""?"
,mia1968,2009-09-10T09:06Z,"#auguststaaf: If the file ending is already showing (that is, the name of the downloaded file ends with "".avi"") you do not have to go through this step. Just click on the file name and change "".avi"" to "".rar"". If the file ending is not showing, change the settings under Tools (in the window menu)/Folder options. There are several tabs, choose View. Uncheck ""Hide extensions for unknown file types"". Then the file ending will show, allowing you to change it."
