,haggisman,2009-09-30T19:42Z,"Works fine thanks M8 if yer ever in Scotland i'll show you how to hunt sabre toothed Haggis and cook it free of charge.
As for virus alerts i scanned if with McAfee and it passed which is good enough for me.
It took me quite some time to learn and trust that most keygens give false positives and i passed up some good software.
Sometimes in life you just have to cover yer balls, take a chance and dive in."
