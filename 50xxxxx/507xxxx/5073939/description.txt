Description:

Inside PINK FLOYD is the first complete independent critical guide to the music and 
images of Pink Floyd and draws upon rare interviews with the band including their own 
candid opinions on their music and their career.

Every album and significant film of Pink Floyd from 1975-1996 is examined, reviewed
and critically assessed by a specially selected team of leading music critics,
musicians and musicologists to discover how the music worked and why; and sometimes
why it didn't. You can be sure no punches are pulled on this full-blooded critical
journey.

Big thanks to t3hfan for this one.
