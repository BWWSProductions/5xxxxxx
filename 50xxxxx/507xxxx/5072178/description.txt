I've gathered these tracks from various places through the years and here they are in one piece. You can visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_from_the_Black_Hole, read the plot, split, mix and arrange the songs in a way that makes most sense to you.

At the time of writing, "What Is This I Find?" is the only one we don't know anything about. 


Tracklist:

01 Blast Off!
02 Who You Callin' Bitch?
03 Oh Jonas (Maria's Theme)
04 Please Remember
05 Come To My Pod
06 Oh No This Is Not For Me
07 Tired of Sex [demo]
08 She's Had a Girl [some guy onwith original sheet music]
09 Dude, We're Finally Landing (Good News)
10 Superfriend
   Now I Finally See is probably similar to no.8

12 I Just Threw Out The Love Of My Dreams
13 Superfriend (pre-Alone I soundclip)
14 No Other One
15 Devotion
16 You Won't Get With Me Tonight
