,Procrasturbate,2009-09-03T23:39Z,"Dont make the mistake of connecting to XBLive with this game in play, they are automatically deleting accounts and banning 360 Serial numbers for pirated ODST.  http://www.gamersspot.com/interceptor.php?op=getnews&news_id=8970"

,Cerealki11er15,2009-09-05T01:39Z,about 2 hours til im done downloading and burning all together. Ill let you guys all know if this is english or not
,Parajunk,2009-09-05T14:13Z,windows is banning players of this game
,Cerealki11er15,2009-09-05T19:03Z,"Ok, im done downloading and currently seeding this game.  Yes it is real and you can play campaign and firefight.  The game is in FRENCH... but the menus are all in English.  The subtitles are on so even if they are speaking French, you can still understand what they are saying.  Overall a very good torrent.  Just remember not to be on xbox live while playing this, just a suggestion.  The English NTCS version of this hasn't been leaked yet and MS said they won't be banning people playing this, but think, because this game is in diff language so if you're playing this, they will most likely find out one way or another."
,Itsara,2009-09-05T22:02Z,Thanx a lot Cerealki11er15 !!

,Fred-Inge,2009-09-12T20:05Z,"Okay, gonna make this clear.
The audio is French,
the language (subtitles) is English,
and the menu is in English,
So the only thing that is french is the Audio, but it`s still playable (Dunno Live) and it`s out 2-3 weeks before public realase, so be happy :D

Thx fo this,
FIS"

Dude that is a load of horse shit. I Have been playing the game since 09/05/09 and the game does not come out til the 22nd. Xbox Live cannot ban you because with the 1.6 firmware they cannot tell weather you bought the game or burned it and they are not willing to take a risk of banning someone who actually bought the game and being in legal problems for it. So you can play the game even before the game comes out, just do not get in a habit of it and play too many games early or Xbox live will get suspicious. "
,netuholoda,2009-09-14T00:42Z,"Yes I also played this game online trying to fuck with the developers but unfortunately nobody is online at all not even the developers. So out of all the copies that were downloaded plus the copies that were leaked, not one person has enough balls to go online."
,omyghosh1212,2009-09-14T02:43Z,"how did u already put this up on thepiratebay.com i thought the release date was September 22, 2009. Please answer this becuase i dont wanna download it and play it before i know if its the full game and if its safe to play online. "
,bobrocks95,2009-09-14T05:43Z,"@ netuholoda

We have reason to suspect that Microsoft can get the data from you, especially if you play online, that you've played a game before its release date.  It's always a bad idea to play one before its release date and Microsoft will often not ban you until months later.  Don't say I didn't warn you if you ever get banned."
,xsmassi,2009-09-14T17:26Z,"My xbox does not read the dvd. I burned it 2 times. The console keeps on loading the dvd but no way to play...
I guess that I'll wait for the release date to play it! I already wasted 2 dvd DL..."
,Gnomeking98,2009-09-25T11:21Z,"How do you burn this and play it? i dont understand the files. Im not too good with this stuff, at least with this many files. lol.

could someone break it down for me?"
,Bujaaa,2009-11-24T23:30Z,The game is in FRENCH!!!! Audio + subtitles. Only ingame text is in english! Shit!!!! Is there no pal or region free version completly in english? 
,jojajaja1,2010-03-02T19:46Z,"this iso file is more than 7 GB ... how to burn it into 2 CDs ?
