I've just uploaded the J10.0 Domgle Emulator we already know, but I decided not to include any JAWS version, since this can be gotten from the web, and there are other language versions out now, so everyone can choose their coresponding language version.
Installation instructions are also contained.
Should anyone know of a way to use JAWS 11.0, I would be very grateful.
This does not seem to be possible with the dongle enymore.
Have a nice day, and seed, seed, seed!!!"

,christer.26,2010-04-18T22:03Z,Hi. Have tested the dongle emu with 32 bit version of Jaws)v10). Can't get it to work on Vista 64 bit... On Vista 64 bit I've used Jaws v10(64 bit) and the dongle emu from this download. Strange that it worked on xpsp3 32 bit and not Vista 64 bit. I of cource used version 10 of Jaws all the time. Someone else with a solution? Thanks for a great upload!
