,barkerbob26,2010-09-06T02:59Z,"For EVERYONE with a notebook, and everyone with a PC that does NOT use a USB mouse+keyboard this is the ONLY version of OSX that you can use, other versions ONLY support USB keyboard and mice, which sucks, so download THIS ONE. The majority of notebook keyboards and trackpads will NOT be recognized as USB, and you'll spend a ton of time installing other copies of osx only to find you have no keyboard or mouse, so save yourself the time and hassel and download THIS ONE, it's the reason there's still people seeding an older copy, the new intel/amd/universal editions WILL NOT WORK."
,AngelxBites,2011-06-13T00:43Z,Does this work on a imac g4 running tiger? and if so do i just burn it to a blank dvd-r and it boots fine? please reply asap:) Thanks in advance
,templarvisonz,2011-10-02T08:28Z,"Good work thanks. i've search tpb.org for mac os that works with amd. this is the only one i could get to work. others i've found did not recognize my drives even after i diskparted them in windows and left them raw drives. but THIS one did that shit.   i have a Dell Inspiron 1501. it's installing right now but i booted to dvd with switch -v and saw that most of everything loaded. systems that are almost 80% compatible with os x can be found at

 hackintosh.com

for those who are searching for compatible systems. 

easiest install is to back up your pc or laptop, and at the same time get ur mac os x pc or laptop ready by following the instructions. then as ur mac os x is done , load ur backups on ur PC or laptop MAC. 

windows is a since. i really love windows, but i would like to learn how to work on macs, this will be my first step in doing such. good night everyone from california"
,vivatpb5776,2011-10-13T04:51Z,"I bought an older G4 on eBay to get my hands dirty in Mac. It does not have an OS so I figured this OS would be as good as any.

.torrent downloaded with no issue. However, the .iso file is non-bootable meaning the system will not recognize the disc before the OS.

- Do Mac computers have a BIOS?
- If so, can I access the BIOS to confirm that the optical drive is set at a higher priority than the hard drive?
- Shouldn't the .iso be bootable?
- Is this even the correct OS for this computer? If not, can someone point me to the correct .torrent?"
