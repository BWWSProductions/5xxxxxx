:::...> About
:
Batman: Arkham Asylum is a third-person action game casting you as -- you guessed 
it, chum -- the Dark Knight himself. The title opens with Batman racing back to 
Arkham, Gotham's home for the criminally insane, with the Joker in tow. Seems the 
Clown Prince of Crime broke out a few weeks ago, but Batman was able to track him 
down and re-apprehend the baddie. However, things are never what they seem with the 
Joker, so after getting the wiry maniac back into the building -- a building stocked 
with hundreds of the Joker's goons after a "mysterious" fire at their prison -- 
Mr. J breaks free with the help of Harley Quinn, takes control of the penitentiary, 
and releases all the inmates.
