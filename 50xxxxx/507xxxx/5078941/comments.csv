,Vonzom,2009-09-05T01:50Z,"Are saves, autosaves, checkpoints, and gliding working in this rip?"
,abhishekdaniel5,2009-09-05T05:29Z,is this in working condition?
,_Metal_Guitar_,2009-09-05T09:07Z,"Thanks guys...I get all TPTB rips because they all ways work great...but this one I will have to pass, at least untill the videos get released as well. 

This game is too story driven not to have them.

Thanks anyway though, you guys do an awesome job."
,_Metal_Guitar_,2009-09-05T09:26Z,"Yes, do the PhysX, Glide and Save work?

Also, do all the grapple points and stuff work.

+Please, please, please, PLEASE make video add-on.

,onikrulz,2009-09-05T09:59Z,"Well which version is this? Retail version hasn't been pirated yet and it's on 15th, the only pirated version is the D2D one. I would like to know if this is a diff version and if there are hidden check errors like gliding, save issues etc. "

thx"
,PUREL,2009-09-06T17:18Z,seed please.  84% ...thanks!
,MutilatedMessiah,2009-09-07T09:37Z,"Works Fine, 

BUT

Glide Bug is there and Doesn't seem to save ether :/

Video's are removed both the more Rendered looking as well as full blown FMV's

Due to the bugs I couldn't seem to progress much into the game I was stuck in the gas chamber trying to get to the extractor controls.

I'll be looking around for a way to fix the save/glide bugs although I think it has something to do with the NVIDIA PhysX, Being im on a ATi HD4870 I Dont think I can enable the Hardware version to try and overcome it."
,Kuyohashi,2009-09-07T10:54Z,"This works fine for me, saves and gliding and everything is alright, all there. But I keep having this glitch whenever I beat Bane. Right where I assume the cinematic would be, the game just crashes and gives me a rather lengthily-written error. Is anyone else having this same problem, and has anyone any idea how to fix it? It's kind of aggrivating to beat Bane, only to have the game crash right after."
,MutilatedMessiah,2009-09-07T11:32Z,"OK I found a fix that at least worked for me

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5079896/Batman_Arkham_Asylum_CRACK

Scanned with latest Avast! Clean :)

Fixed my gliding and save bug.

For those of interest my hardware

Core 2 Duo E4600 @ 2.80ghz
4Gb Ram DDR2 800
ATi HD4870
MSI P43 Motherboard

Maybe the Nvidia Graphics cards work ok with this release outta the box with there intergrated PhysX, maybe the ones with glide issues are ATi users?

Well yea grab the item above it fixes saves n gliding and grappling is fine too"

,hypn0t1c,2009-09-08T01:27Z,"Don't bother with this one, it crashes after the Bane fight every time, not worth downloading if you don't get the videos AND you can only play about 1/3 of the game."
,sus2912,2009-09-08T15:48Z,"@ir2pid
this game is ripped by dopeman for ur information and dopeman is a part of tptb"
,MutilatedMessiah,2009-09-08T22:05Z,"@sus2912 

Actually its ripped by: ""Freeman G Ripper"" (See near bottom of nfo) but yea Dopeman, Sculptura, toed and Freeman G Ripper are members of ""The Powers That Be"""
,MutilatedMessiah,2009-09-08T22:07Z,"well maybe Sculptura im not sure,

Side note game constantly crashes for me in the catacombs area not long after fighting bane for the 1st time (not sure if its last time)"
,sus2912,2009-09-09T12:54Z,"@all
this rip is not good one it keep crashing so dont download it and
now it is officially confirmed by shroo that there is going to be a new release by tptb for this game with no bugs and vids so plz wait for that"
,Arkyfox,2009-09-09T18:42Z,"
If your having trouble in the game with grapple or anything in general. There is a trainer on Gamecopyworld that will let you use the number pad to move on the X Y and Z axis.

Here is the link http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2009&f=Batman_Arkham_Asylum_V1.0_Plus_4_Trainer_By_KelSat!rar

listen you little prick, this is not you business. we bitched on skull coz, he is a barefaced liar, and deserved that, now he crawl back to the hole he has left before, so if he doesnt has the balls to be here, and stating facts, its HIS problem!.

about dopeman: once for all, HE IS member of
TPTB unlike Skullptura!, dopeman will sure show up here, he is atm without computer, and has lots work to do, he has HIS RESERVED place in our team!. therefor ThePowersThatBe 
are: Synergy , Freeman, ToeD, Dopeman... all others who claim to be part of the team. are wanna be's and liar's!.

It will only works for 20% of who have the game ""BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM"".....This is a collection of comments/complates over net  



 1.  Extract Batman.Arkham.Asylum.FullRip-KaOs

 2.  Install Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs (I think it not necessary)

 3.  You need .Net Frame Work1 Service Pack 1 (I think it not necessary)

 4.  You need .Net Frame Work2 Service Pack 1

 5.  You need .Net Frame Work3 Service Pack 1 

 6.  You need .Net Frame Work3.5 Service Pack 1

 7.  Update your directx

 8.  Move ""My Documents"" from C:\Dcuments and settings\.... to D:\Documents.

 9.  Install Games for windows by ""gfwlivesetupmin.exe""

 10. Copy ""msvcr70.dll"" to C:\windows\system\ and make the file into hidden and read-only.Some times its virus.

 12. Update your video card driver (I think it not necessary)

 13. If you want to enable PhysX, Change the ""PhysXLevel=0"" to ""PhysXLevel=1"" in the 
     file E:\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\BmEngine.ini

 14. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT! (Even, I am not garantee about working)

 15. If you installed PowerDvD, its process may will affect the game (I think it not necessary)

 And enjoy you're game !
