      Section 8 is an intense first-person shooter that gives players
      unprecedented strategic control over the battlefield, employing
      tactical assets and on-demand vehicle deliveries to dynamically
      alter the flow of combat. Set at the crossroads of a growing
      insurrection among its colonies, Earth dispatches the elite 8th
      Armored Infantry to turn the tide.
      Utilizing advanced powered armor suits, these brave volunteers
      are the only ones crazy enough to smash through enemy defenses
      and drop directly into the battlefield from 15,000 feet, earning
      them the nickname â€œSection 8.â€
