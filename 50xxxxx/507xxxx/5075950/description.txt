Well, chew on this tasty treat: Readers of 'Cracking the Code- The Fascinating Truth About Taxation In America' (CtC), the exclusive presentation of the complete and accurate truth about the tax, have already retained or taken back well over 
$10,000,000
from the federal and state governments-- including Social Security and Medicare 'contributions'-- and kept it in their own pockets where it belongs, simply by knowing what the law actually says and how it actually works.  These Americans have gotten back every penny they've paid or had withheld from them during the year in connection with the "income tax", many of them year after year after year.
