,MarkSeif,2009-09-05T19:52Z,Your Uploads Are ALWAYS Top Notch.  Did You Put Hard Coded Subs In This Release?  I Heard Some Releases Are Missing Subs.
,loonatick,2009-09-05T19:55Z,This one has the subs.

,DVDguy,2009-09-06T16:25Z,Hard Coded Subs or not?
,jstnryan,2009-09-10T11:44Z,"Great quality. Subtitles are not hard coded. The subs included are only for non-English parts, however the timing is off. The subs in xgp_alex28's link are for everything, including English parts."
,patchiethepirate1,2009-09-11T02:48Z,"wow,what a great r-5.
thanks cgaurav007."
,thearches,2009-09-11T21:15Z,Excellent video quality. Very good audio quality.  Only negative is out-of-sync alien subtitles in the 2nd half.  A bit disorienting because the subtitle appears before the action.  For some reason that's harder to process than the sub coming a bit late (at least for me).  But it doesn't happen often enough to be a big deal.
