,ccdemon,2010-01-04T07:26Z,"I haven't quite finished downloading episodes 59 to 65 yet but I can watch parts of them and they're just the chapters of the movie ""Hot Fuzz"". What gives!?"
,ccdemon,2010-01-05T13:20Z,"Sorry, forget about the previous comment.
I've completely downloaded a few of those episodes and they are the real deal.
The only thing I can think of is that my computer got the file pointers wrong and pointed to to the movie I have in another location on my HDD. Weird..."
