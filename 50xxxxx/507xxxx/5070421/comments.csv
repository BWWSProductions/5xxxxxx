,raindr0ps,2009-08-28T06:08Z,"Evidently, kluelos, you've never had kangaroo tail soup or wallabe fritters or koala steaks wraped in eucalypts leaves or even dingo bites grilled on a bamboo skewer with wombat sauce (I won't even mention the many things done with the kookaburra) or any of the other delicious Australian cuisine!"

,migikion,2009-10-08T16:30Z,raindrops...all the dishes u said are from the aborigines.not australians.i love australia but u dont have cuisine
,raindr0ps,2009-10-13T07:26Z,"migikion, all the fine dishes I mentioned in my previous comment where strictly a figment of my imagination, something I made up on a moments notice. If I mentioned something that might resemble an actual recipe it was purely by accident. They did sound pretty good though, don't you think?  Still not sure about kookaburra...you got any ideas?"

Excellent beer, loose women, and lots of space+nothing can kill you with the exception of bears. Australia may look better at a glance but thats until that funnel spider or brown snake or box jelly has a go at your testes krike! I'll stay here."
