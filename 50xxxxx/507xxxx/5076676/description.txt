Reservoir Dogs is the 1992 debut feature film of director and writer Quentin Tarantino.(Famous for his cult flicks Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill & Hostel)

This film portrays what happened before and after a botched jewel heist, but not the heist itself. Reservoir Dogs stars an ensemble cast with Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi and Lawrence Tierney.

Tarantino also has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker. It incorporates many themes and aesthetics that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, memorable dialogue with excessive profanity and a nonlinear storyline.

The film has become a classic of independent film and was named "Greatest Independent Film of all Time" by Empire. Reservoir Dogs was generally well received and the cast was praised by many critics, though it never became a major box office success, becoming mostly popular after the success of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. It is also often criticized for its amount of violence, and audience members reportedly walked out during the "ear-cutting scene".
