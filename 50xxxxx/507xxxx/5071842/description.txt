Calabrese: One of those bands you've never heard of, from a genre you've never heard of (Horrorpunk).

They're actually a fairly underground band from Arizona, small enough not to have a Wikipedia page yet.

Here is a link to their "About Us" section of their website: http://www.calabreserock.com/about.html

This is their first three Albums:

 	
The Traveling Vampire Show

13 Halloweens

Midnight Spook Show

These albums are a little on the difficult side to find, so I put them together and uploaded them to the interwebs for all you pirates. This is a relatively small band, so seriously, if you like their stuff, go to http://www.calabreserock.com/store/index.html and buy the albums. Support the band, or they won't make more music.
