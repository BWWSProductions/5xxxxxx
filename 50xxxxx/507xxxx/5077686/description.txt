Other Comments:This is an older recitation from abdullah basfar that has not been released not on CD it was used at qurancomplex.org very very rare for downloading but maybe not hearing cause you can a lower quality version at reciter.org but the only you download this was Quran complex well not until now.please seed.

but this one here is a new that i converted from .ra files from qurancomplex.org
cause there mp3's actually don't work they were cut off at near the end of the audio but this new torrent I'm uploading i converted and tested it and works the files are no longer cut and they now have clear 24kbps VBR Quality.

i used this converter
