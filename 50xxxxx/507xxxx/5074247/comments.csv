,maxigawa,2009-09-01T09:59Z,one thing you can try is-run the ios downgrader then repeat the instructions.i'm assuming you have softmii installed? 
,Deathplay,2009-09-02T11:10Z,"Softmod yes followed the read me yes 
but NTSC system and running wiigator and doesnt have any newer updates from 07/08 to now "
,Deathplay,2009-09-02T11:28Z,instead of using iso 37 to 249 use iso 37 to 232
,Deathplay,2009-09-02T11:51Z,and run as 232 it fixes the error message for ntsc systems with 002 and fake iso enabled
[T],victory144,2009-09-02T19:08Z,"Install cIOS38 rev14 Waninkoko
Install IOS56-64-v5146.wad via wad manager Waninkoko

Optional :
Install cios55bugfix from softmii 3.0 Pack

Run Latest Softchip
Change IOS to 55 if installed the cios55bugfix if not change to 232 or maybe others will work....
Active 002 protection...
Run the game ..enjoy"
,Coolepeter,2009-11-17T21:04Z,"Thanks for the fix, but still I can't play guitar hero.
When I'm trying to start GH from the SoftChip I get an error: DI_read_ID.

I've turned the 002 protection on, I also installed the IOS37 2070, but I installed it with wad manager because I don't have wifi.

plz help, I really want to play GH5!!"
