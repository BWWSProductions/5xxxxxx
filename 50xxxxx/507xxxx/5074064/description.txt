Salem's Lot is a town which a new member, Mr. Straker, has taken as his new "home", and has a mysterious partner, namely Mr. Barlow. 

Not too long after Straker arrives in Salem's Lot, people start disappearing from sight and dying from odd causes, and no one is sure why, including Ben Mears who is in town to write a new book on the town's rumoured haunted house called the Marsten House, which overlooks the town and hides a terrible secret about to be unleashed.
