,honunetcti,2010-08-26T05:17Z,"FAKE!!!!!!!!! This is bullshit.  Its not Salems Lot, its the Return to Salems Lot.  Huge difference.  Thanks for a days wasted downloading"
,santana,2011-11-20T16:32Z,"You are wrong, it is the correct Salems Lot. I think you might have commented on the wrong torrent. "
,Mentaltown72,2011-12-16T23:37Z,"I downloaded your torrent and unzipped it with uTorrent no problem. I wanted to preview it before using ConvertXtoDVD to burn it, but my Windows 7 will not play it. Just curious why that is?"
