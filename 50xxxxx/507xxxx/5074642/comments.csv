Kudos!"

,Quarlo,2009-09-01T08:47Z,"Pardon my newbyness, but how are you downloading this? I keep getting ""Locating Sources..."" forever in Limewire. What's the magic?? Thx"
,dj8765,2009-09-02T09:58Z,"If you name yourself techfella shouldn't you be able to tell?  Perhaps you should use a good video player instead of WMP.   

Quarlo you probably need to enable DHT, the PB trackers have been down a while now.  Try a google search for Limewire DHT for instructions."

,tomjo,2009-09-08T00:45Z,"Can some one confirm this is not a scam as the other two above.
Since those where not season 2 episode 11.

,dacarlo,2009-09-10T20:06Z,Episode 12 is a week later than usual. Should be Sunday 13th September. Anything out already = fake!
,charles338,2009-09-11T11:01Z,Thank you for the upload!!!
,max2562,2009-09-12T01:38Z,"@ dacarlo
thanks for the info. I was wondering why nothing has been uploaded for ep12 yet. I don't watch tv but I love these shows so I didn't realize the episode was scheduled a week later. 
I noticed that some of the same actors in this show were also in Deadwood, which is also an excellent show."
,shasham,2010-01-03T19:34Z,"Thanks for all of these, eztv! :) Will seed as always."
