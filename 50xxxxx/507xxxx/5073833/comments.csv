It might have something to do with that i have European Wii version and this is US torrent. I dont know if its true, but just so you know:

 4.1E, EU Wii + This torrent = Black and White game."
,busterthefox,2011-10-18T14:43Z,"@Yoursupply: European Wiis are of the PAL region, while USA Wiis are of the NTSC regions. Trying to play one region of the game on another region will cause that black and white thing. Try setting ""force PAL"" in your USB Loader if you're using one, or simply download the PAL version. There is a PAL version on this site with double the seeders, so you would be better off there, I think. :)"
