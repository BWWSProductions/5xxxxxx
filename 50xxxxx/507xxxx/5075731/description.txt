Tech Jacket was a six issue American comic book created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist E.J. Su, published monthly by Image Comics in November 2002 to April 2003.

A High School kid named Zack Thompson finds a dying alien from a race of incredibly intelligent but physically weak beings called the Geldarians. To make up for this they have invented the Tech Jacket, a vest that every Geldarian is equipped with upon birth. Seeing the human and knowing his crashed spaceship is going to blow up and kill them both, the alien fits him with the Tech Jacket saving his life. But now the Tech Jacket can't be removed and gives Zack, "the most powerful weapons in the universe".  A Geldarians show up, thinking Zack killed the previous wearer and stole the Tech Jacket.  They take him back to Geldaria to stand trial, but on the way they are attacked.

Originally 12 issues were planned, but due to low sales the series stopped at #6.
