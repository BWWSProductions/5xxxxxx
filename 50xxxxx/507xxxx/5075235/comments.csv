[V],Kitlope,2009-09-01T02:14Z,"The admins on the forum were douchebags about it too. I asked nicely if they could remove it and they denied.

This will be my last flac upload here TPB. Such a shame - with almost 300 FLAC uploads to be treated second rate doesn't cut it for me. Thats one thing about TPB - they treat their uploaders like shit. No wonder axxo quit using the tracker

Even mininova deleted the torrent. An index site.

Oh, and Spotted Jackal, FUCK YOU.
