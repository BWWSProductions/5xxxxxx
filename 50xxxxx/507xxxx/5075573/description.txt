RELEASE NOTES

Guards your front door C stopping hackers and other intruders in their
tracks
PC Security
Operating System Firewall (OSFirewallâ„¢)
No anti-virus or anti-spyware product is 100% effective, so ZoneAlarm invented the OS Firewall. The OS Firewall monitors behaviors within your computer to spot and stop even the most sophisticated new attacks that bypass traditional anti-virus and security suites.

   * Advanced Access Protection New â€“ specifically defeats new, advanced attacks that other firewalls miss like raw data access, timing, SCM and COM attacks.
   * 0-Hour Protection â€“ prevents silent outbreaks from gaining system access even before the threat is known by other security programs
   * Program Control â€“ restricts programs from malicious activities, blocking attacks that by-pass other defenses.
   * Early Boot Protection â€“ Uniquely protects your operating system during start-up before most security products have even loaded.

2-Way Firewall
Stops Internet attacks at the front door and even catches thieves on their way out. Our 2-way firewall proactively protects against inbound and outbound attacks while making you invisible to hackers.

   * Inbound & Outbound â€“ monitors and blocks threat traffic in or out.
   * Full Stealth Mode â€“ makes you invisible to hackers.
   * Kill Controls â€“ instantly disable malicious programs.
   * Passes Independent Leak Tests* â€“ passes 100% of tests compared to an industry average of 40%. See test results.

Wireless PC Protection
Connecting to an unsecured network leaves you vulnerable to hackers, identity thieves, and other online threats. Automatic Wireless Network Security detects wireless networks and automatically applies the most secure firewall protection setting.
SmartDefenseâ„¢ Service
provides real-time security updates, quick response to breaking threats, and leverages threat data from millions of users to protect your PC from the latest attacks.
Identity Theft Protection
Identity Protection Services
Identity theft can happen to anyone, anywhere. ZoneAlarm delivers superior PC based protection and exclusive data encryption, and also offers offline ID protection services.

   * Daily Credit Monitoring and Fraud Alerts â€“ monitors your credit reports daily with email alerts and reports, and notifies you if there have been changes, which is often an indication of identity theft (US only).
   * Victim Recovery Service â€“ provides free telephone counseling to guide ID theft victims through resolution and recovery (US only).

Browser Security
Advanced Download Protection New
Automatically analyzes your downloads to determine if they are safe or malicious. Includes an advanced security check that runs and analyzes the download in a protected environment.

   * Instant Security Check â€“ Automatically checks programs you download through your web browser with a list of known dangerous downloads and intelligently analyzes the program itself.
   * Deep Security Check â€“ Provides an option to run the download in a virtual protected environment to more deeply analyze it for malicious behavior.

Dangerous Web Site Detection
Blocks spyware distribution sites and fraudulent "phishing" websites that trick you into revealing personal data.

   * Anti-phishing â€“ Warns you and blocks fraudulent "phishing" websites that trick you into revealing personal data. Advanced heuristics detect brand new phishing sites created seconds ago that standard anti-phishing security misses.
   * Spy-site Blocking â€“ Warns you and blocks web sites that are known to distribute spyware.
   * Site Authentication â€“ One-click tells you when a site was registered, where, and if it is known to be dangerous.

Ease of Use
Automatic Operation
Focus on what you want to do, we take care of the rest.

   * Quiet Security â€“ Reduced the number of program alerts users see by over 90%.
