This collection of thirteen animated films covers thirty years of experiments with form, pictorial representation and playful storytelling. One name is common to them all: Georges Schwizgebel, one of the most influential and respected directors of contemporary animation. The Swiss filmmaker's style is very much his own: a few deft brushstrokes suffice to depict a character, create an atmosphere or construct a world. Schwizgebel is a meticulous craftsman who also possesses a remarkable feeling for the dramatic, suggesting grandeur with minimal means and an extraordinary economy of lines. His films, often inspired by musical structures, embrace all the arts - architecture, theatre, dance, literature, painting - and form a unique, coherent body of work with the imprint of the artist's wide-ranging mind.
