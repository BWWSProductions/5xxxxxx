After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
  
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	  
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	  
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce  
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce  
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce  
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce  
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce  
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

All of the Screaming Trees albums, including the unreleased 1999 album, three EPs, a greatest hits albums, and 25 rarities (which include covers, unreleased tracks, and live versions). Although the may ver well be "forgotten" Seattle band, these guys are just as brilliant if not more so than anything being released at this time. The greatest hits album, Ocean of Confusion, is perhaps the best album to start with if you are new to the band. If you would rather try an album first, however, I would start with Sweet Oblivion then work my way back or forward. These folks deserve your everlasting respect, along with your money.

(1985) Other World (EP)
