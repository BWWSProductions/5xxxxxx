,Jdog9000,2009-09-03T22:38Z,"Fascism has taken over, we need to kill it. Let's start with Bill Maher. "
,booboo332,2009-09-03T23:27Z,Maher should give up the political and anti-theistic evangelism and stick to telling jokes.  He is still milking his hatred of Bush and it is getting pathetic.
,ItBitTorrent,2009-09-04T04:48Z,"If it weren't for his team of writers, Bill Maher would not have an original thought in his head. Like booboo said he should stick to telling jokes(written by others).

Carry on sistromo(stuck on stupid), you misery and discontent is my happiness. "

Sistromo - grab your mop and bucket"
,aftac,2009-09-04T15:20Z,"Thanks.
I'm all for change, but not without first knowing what is going to be changed, why, and how, and a generous application of common sense."
,HapPsy,2009-09-04T20:35Z,"Maher says that Americans are stupid, and when you look at sistromo we have proff that at least some are. And, as long as Maher has viewers we will have proof that at least some Americans are stupid..

So, sistromo, for once you are correct, fascism is not dead, it is alive and well, and you are following your fascist friends right into slavery. As for myself, i will choose the ""underground railroad"" route."
