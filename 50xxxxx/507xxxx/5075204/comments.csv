,Foursticks,2009-09-01T09:30Z,The end of this movie led the viewer to believe there would be a R E 4... It's not over yet... I hope M J does another one... 4s..

Many others like myself use it as a main viewing source for videos since it has such high quality. Anyways I was hoping you could figure out what was wrong and fix it for your future rips. I think your doing a great job just cant watch any of your movies which is a shame. Anyways thanks for your time and understanding and gl with all your future rips and thank you for all your current ones."

Dawn Of The Dead (1978) Directors Cut - (AC-3) [akhiugo]
ripped in 1978 then? From a DVD? I don't think so... Nobody cares when you ripped the thing, you're supposed to label the year when the movie was made.."
