,baronjohn,2009-09-03T13:04Z,"It's real, but gliding is broken."
,Flummig_Badboll,2009-09-03T13:04Z,"i wonder the same thing, is this real?"
,some_j,2009-09-03T13:48Z,"this is almost 100 % real i guess, there is a p2p version out ""Batman Arkham Asylum D2D READNFO"", so....."
[T],Knaster,2009-09-03T14:04Z,rmj13 well there is a crack directory so......worth a try
[T],Beebe85,2009-09-03T16:24Z,"the read me text:

Update: if you start the game again
reload it new..it will start from checkpoint 1. IT DOESNT SAVE..
u can minimize the game..and it will keep it saved..as soon
as u close it..it loses all info

Thanks to ilhan for the working crack! I have taken time for the TL users to make
sure this game works without any glitches and hence have added numerous screenshots to prove
that We can finally Enjoy this game! No worries No tensions == Just have fun









Minor Warnings. You create an offline profile but for some reason it does not recognize that you
are indeed logged in. So it asks do you want to continue playing the game. It won't be saved. JUST go for it.

U can pause the game. Come out of full screen. Minimize it do your other stuff

OR The game itself keeps on self saving at various checkpoints. U will continue the story no matter what.

Screenshots to show you what i mean"
,doddsie,2009-09-03T17:12Z,"well looks legit to me, also there is a savegame fix, not tried yet though..

,some_j,2009-09-03T17:26Z,"keep on seeding pls, thx"
,_beta_,2009-09-03T18:45Z,"If you want to enable Physx download the ""Demo with Physx"", copy ""BmLauncher.exe"" from the demo install directory to the full game install directory and run it... Physx settings will now show at the bottom... setting High recommends using a 9800gtx+ for dedicated Physx... ran fine on my GTX280 1920x1200 "
[T],Knaster,2009-09-03T20:58Z,"You can also fix the Glide/run issue. 

Find the BaseInput.ini file right click it and in properties remove write protection press apply.

In the file find the word ""SpaceBar"" and change it to the key of your choosing i chosed ""RightShift"" (notice the big letter of the word.) 

Then save the file and close, now  right click it again and in properties reapply write protection.

Now in the game the glide issue is solved VOILA!!!"
,ramishka,2009-09-04T07:27Z,"For PhysX to work properly i think you need a physx enabled vga card as well as latest physx system software (even if you force it via config file)

This could be a possible reason for crashes."
,Flummig_Badboll,2009-09-04T23:28Z,Yeah it's working but you can't save the game...

,Arkyfox,2009-09-09T21:50Z,"
If your having trouble in the game with grapple or anything in general. There is a trainer on Gamecopyworld that will let you use the number pad to move on the X Y and Z axis.

Here is the link http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2009&f=Batman_Arkham_Asylum_V1.0_Plus_4_Trainer_By_KelSat!rar

Enjoy ^_^"
,xXShinigami-KenchiXx,2009-09-10T20:11Z,"If you would've even bothered checking the official site all the ""Bugs"" yo are having with Gliding. Grapple, etc... Are programmed in to Screw with Pirates. It's actually quite ingenious and I have to give them props for bothering to actually mess with our heads but anyway, make a working crack that fixes the errors and you will make alot of people very happy."

It will only works for 20% of who have the game ""BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM"".....This is a collection of comments/complates over net  



 1.  Extract Batman.Arkham.Asylum.FullRip-KaOs

 2.  Install Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs (I think it not necessary)

 3.  You need .Net Frame Work1 Service Pack 1 (I think it not necessary)

 4.  You need .Net Frame Work2 Service Pack 1

 5.  You need .Net Frame Work3 Service Pack 1 

 6.  You need .Net Frame Work3.5 Service Pack 1

 7.  Update your directx

 8.  Move ""My Documents"" from C:\Dcuments and settings\.... to D:\Documents.

 9.  Install Games for windows by ""gfwlivesetupmin.exe""

 10. Copy ""msvcr70.dll"" to C:\windows\system\ and make the file into hidden and read-only.Some times its virus.

 12. Update your video card driver (I think it not necessary)

 13. If you want to enable PhysX, Change the ""PhysXLevel=0"" to ""PhysXLevel=1"" in the 
     file E:\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\BmEngine.ini

 14. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT! (Even, I am not garantee about working)

 15. If you installed PowerDvD, its process may will affect the game (I think it not necessary)

 And enjoy you're game !
