"Session Thing" was initially believed to be part of the Jam with Traffic at Electric Lady Studios 15.06.70, but has later been determined to come from TTG Studios 29.10.68. It has now also been suggested that the flute may have been played by Lowell George, not Jim Horn, and the keyboards by Graham Bond, not Lee Michaels.
- This album has later been reissued as "Lover Man" (Oil Well 123 CD)
