I haven't listened to the show today as i'm backed up on older shows and R&F but i was reading WB and they said something about a saturday show with nothing but wrestler interviews with matt striker. If that's the case could you possibly get it up here? If you can't i understand but i would greatly appreciate it as i'm a wrestling fan and would love to have that show. "

,08millerj,2009-09-04T06:34Z,"Do you ever call in to the show, and if so, what name do you go by? "
,RonFez12to3,2009-09-04T15:25Z,Well i'm not sure if it's the worst of the week this saturday or the SNV. I'll try and find out by tonight but they've been playing promos for it apparently. 
[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-04T18:05Z,I've been on air once or twice a few years back with just a goofy name but I'm not a regular caller.
