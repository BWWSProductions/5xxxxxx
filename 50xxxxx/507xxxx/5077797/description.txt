Oderus from GWAR (in costume) in-studio. The boys went to 
break and never came back, plus I left the live read in
at the end as there was still a show going on sort of. 

Note: I plan on having the shows up a smidge earlier 
tomorrow, I figured out some tricks to speed things up
a bit. I'm also doing some infrastructure upgrades in 
the next few weeks which should also lead to earlier 
ups. That's the good news. The bad news is I'm planning 
on "retiring" from posting O&A (it's simply a logistics
thing) in December of this year. That's plenty of notice
to find another reliable daily uploader of O&A.
