,Aestuo,2009-09-02T21:38Z,"No seeders, no comments?

This seems a little fishy."
,Delfistyaosani,2009-09-14T14:59Z,"AVG 8.5 says CLEAN, fixed EXE works fine :)

10x man ;)

and at least FRAPS 32 and 64 bit codecs are supported, have fun gamers ;)"
,diesel93,2009-09-18T00:49Z,win7 x86. dont work. while starting encoding it adds profile name to file name and says it cant open it
,conbatu,2009-09-22T20:29Z,"Do i have to install Cuda before or what? Anyone give more infos please, thanks anyway mrpras"
,happypills,2009-10-05T03:45Z,Works great! Nod 32 Smart security says CLEAN!
,PokerCrow,2009-10-08T09:24Z,"100% clean according to NOD32, and works great."
,volcomhackzor,2009-10-20T01:14Z,works ! :) and safe
,mrpras,2009-10-24T03:54Z,"Yeah you need Cuda

This basically means having Nvidia drivers installed and a 8600 or better Nvidia card..

Google cuda and google badaboom if you want to find tech support. This is a torrent site after all :)"
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2010-03-28T18:55Z,no downlaod thx anyway i use a free opensource solution named mediacoder which also use gpu acceleration to accelerate h.264 encoding and the most hot thing about is that it offers a lot of options
,bunnymaster3000,2010-04-10T10:13Z,"thanks youssef, works way better than this."
,mrpras,2010-04-24T13:32Z,"thanks youssef

I couldn't find mediacoder with gpu support, got a link? their site doesn't mention gpu at all.

There are more apps now encoding with gpu (better than this one) 

Cyberlink powerdirector for example"
,mrpras,2010-04-30T13:39Z,"I checked out Mediacoder - not opensource (free though) and no GPU encoder.

Cyberlink Powerdirector is a good choice to convert using the hardware. It's also got some great functions made easy like video denoise, enhanced upscale, motion stabiliser etc."
,Whit3_Addict,2010-05-22T17:15Z,shit man isent it cracked?
,mrpras,2010-06-27T22:03Z,The crack is included in there (you have to replace the exe)
,RDx274,2010-09-10T21:13Z,"THIS SOFTWARE WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY WITH THE LATEST NVIDIA DRIVERS. TRY AT YOUR RISK!

The Badaboom System Check reads Drivers wrongly. For example, the current latest NV drivers are 258.96. SysCheck reads it as 158.96 and Badaboom requires drivers above 177.xx.

As a result, I had trouble converting a movie to my PSP, it failed thrice before converting successfully. I'm yet to test whether the movie is playable though.

The Badaboom team has already fixed this in their latest version. So either-

A) Wait for the latest version to release.
B) Roll back your graphic card drivers to anything below 200.00."
