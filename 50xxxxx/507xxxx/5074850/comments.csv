Thanks!"
,TheBlondeReaper,2009-10-08T22:39Z,"Hi, I can verify that this is indeed the latest version, and a full game, no viruses, straightforward install.

ONly question is does anybody know where the Save files are stored on this particular copy of the game? I can't find them anywhere, and copying the install dir doesnt copy any saves, just the game. Thanks :)"
