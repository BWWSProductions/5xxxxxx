@godlessgirl tweeted, â€œI want to be a card-carrying Atheist. Maybe I should make my own cardsâ€¦â€ and I started to think about it. I came up with thisâ€¦



Iâ€™ve often wondered what I would do if, by some unfortunate turn of events, I was no longer capable of expressing my wishes, perhaps following an accident or illness. What would I do if, one day, Father Friggety turned up at my bedside with his worry beads and started grovelling before his own externalised ego, begging to be forgiven on my behalf?

Hopefully, theyâ€™ll find a copy of this handy print-out-and-keep, â€œstick your religion up your arseâ€ card in my things, before they start praying, and concentrate more of their efforts on doing something thatâ€™ll actually help me recover instead.
