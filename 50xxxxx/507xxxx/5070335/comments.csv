[T],Valdo_PT,2009-08-27T03:55Z,"Well I think that anonymous uploads don't show on searches, I have tried once and also I didn't find something that was posted just days before."
[T],ecolo,2009-08-27T08:40Z,gonzalo76 I'm not sure but TPB should know who the thief is and delete the darn thing so you could upload your original torrent
[T],ecolo,2009-08-27T09:03Z,If not could You trick the idiot by splitting & uploading part one in  2 parts  (let say part 1A & 1B) that would probably work.
,gonzalo76,2009-08-27T13:26Z,"You could download part 1 from Mininova: 

www.m.i.n.i.n.o.v.a.org/tor/2889099 

(delete the dots please)


Take care,
Gonzalo"
,gonzalo76,2009-08-27T19:15Z,"ATTENTION !!!

[b]For some reason, EAC did not detect the times correct in the ""corrected gaps"" cuesheet. I burned Voodoo Lounge with Nero using 'corrected gaps' cuesheet and the tracks did NOT start from the begining.

""Noncompliant"" cuesheets are fine, I burned 'Voodoo Lounge' with Burrrn and the times were correct this time.

You'll have to use 'Burrrn"" to burn ALL the albums because I think Voodoo Lounge is not the only one with problems.

'Burrrn' is more simple than Nero (and free), you'll only have to drag and drop the noncompliant cuesheet in the main window and Burn will detect all the tracks and times.

Sorry but I really don't know what happened.  ???

,mahut,2009-12-29T15:57Z,These show up as mp3 ?
,agonzz,2010-02-27T02:33Z,Very effin' cool.  Thanks!
,Yinyuekuang,2011-04-02T01:15Z,"Now that Mininova is not working, does anyone know where to find the torrent link?

Or, is Gonzalo76 kind enough to re-try the upload perhaps using a different file name to avoid duplication rejections from the system here?"
,Yinyuekuang,2011-04-02T15:58Z,"Sorry, forgot to specify above that the link I refer to at Mininova is Part 1 of the UMG Remasters.

BTW, Gonzalo76 rocks for doing such good work and whoever the knoblicker is who hijacked the original upload is a flippin tool!!!"
