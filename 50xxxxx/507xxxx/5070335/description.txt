ATTENTION !!!

For some reason, EAC did not detect the times correct in the "corrected gaps" cuesheet. I burned Voodoo Lounge with Nero using 'corrected gaps' cuesheet and the tracks did NOT start from the begining.

"Noncompliant" cuesheets are fine, I burned 'Voodoo Lounge' with Burrrn and the times were correct this time.

You'll have to use 'Burrrn" to burn ALL the albums because I think Voodoo Lounge is not the only one with problems.

'Burrrn' is more simple than Nero (and free), you'll only have to drag and drop the noncompliant cuesheet in the main window and Burn will detect all the tracks and times.

Sorry but I really don't know what happened.  ???

DIRTY WORK

Dirty Work is The Rolling Stones' 18th studio album (or the 21st, counting their US releases). It was released on 24 March 1986 on the Rolling Stones label by CBS Records. Produced by Steve Lillywhite, the album was recorded during a period when relations between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards soured considerably,[citation needed] and is often regarded as a low point for the band.

The album produced a hit for the Rolling Stones â€” their cover of "Harlem Shuffle" â€” and features a number of guest appearances, including contributions by Tom Waits, Patti Scialfa, Bobby Womack, and Jimmy Page on "One Hit (To the Body)."

In 1994 Dirty Work was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music.

STEEL WHEELS

Steel Wheels is an album by The Rolling Stones and was released in 1989. Heralded as a major comeback upon its release, the project is notable for the patching up of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards' relationship, a reversion to a more classic style of music and the launching of the band's biggest world tour at the time. It is also founding bassist Bill Wyman's final studio album with The Rolling Stones, preceding the announcement of his departure in January 1993.

The album was the Rolling Stones' first digital recording. In 1994, Steel Wheels was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music.

VOODOO LOUNGE

Voodoo Lounge is an album by The Rolling Stones and was released in 1994. As their first new release under their new alliance with Virgin Records, it ended a five-year gap since their last studio album, Steel Wheels in 1989. Voodoo Lounge is also The Rolling Stones' first album without founding bassist Bill Wyman, who departed the line-up in early 1993.

Released in July 1994, Voodoo Lounge received strong reviews and debuted at #1 in the UK (their first chart-topper there since 1980's Emotional Rescue) and #2 in the US where it went double platinum.

In early 1995, while the Voodoo Lounge Tour was still in full force (not finishing until August that year) Voodoo Lounge won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album.

In 2009, Voodoo Lounge was remastered and reissued by Universal Music.

BRIDGES TO BABYLON

Bridges to Babylon is an album by The Rolling Stones and was released in 1997. It would prove to be their final studio album of the 1990s and their last full-length release of new songs until 2005. The album was supported by a massive year-long worldwide tour that met with much success.

The Stones had become a touring phenomenon by this point. The Bridges to Babylon Tour in 1997 consisted of 108 shows, making it the second largest grossing North American tour of all time.

In 2009, Bridges to Babylon was remastered and reissued by Universal Music.

A BIGGER BANG

A Bigger Bang is the twenty-second studio album by The Rolling Stones. It is a follow-up to their previous full-length studio album, 1997's Bridges to Babylon, and like Bridges to Babylon and its 1994 predecessor Voodoo Lounge, the album was again produced by Don Was and The Glimmer Twins.

The album features a more basic, stripped-down style reminiscent of Some Girls, but with a harder, more contemporary edge. Many of these songs were recorded with just the core band of Richards, Jagger, and Watts. Ronnie Wood was absent from some of the sessions, playing on only ten of the sixteen tracks, with only very occasional contributions from outside musicians comprising the recording of the album.

The album is the first on which Jagger also plays bass on some tracks. This results from Ronnie Wood's lesser participation.

In 2009, A Bigger Bang was reissued by Universal Music.

Track listing

01. Rough Justice â€“ 3:12
02. Let Me Down Slow â€“ 4:16
03. It Won't Take Long â€“ 3:55

05. Streets of Love â€“ 5:10
06. Back of My Hand â€“ 3:33
07. She Saw Me Coming â€“ 3:13
08. Biggest Mistake â€“ 4:06
09. This Place Is Empty â€“ 3:17

UMG Remasters Series 2009 were divided by UMG in 4 parts:

Part 1 - May 4: Sticky Fingers, Goat's Head Soup, It's Only Rock 'n Roll, Black And Blue
Part 2 - June 9: Some Girls, Emotional Rescue, Tattoo You, Undercover
Part 3 - July 14: Dirty Work, Steel Wheels, Voodoo Lounge, Bridges to Babylon, A Bigger Bang
Part 4 - 2010: Exile On Main St. (maybe late 2009)


04.02.09 The Rolling Stones Announce Post-1971 Catalogue Re-master Plans

Beginning on May 5th, fans of The Rolling Stones will have much to rejoice about with the arrival of re-mastered versions of "Sticky Fingers," "Goats Head Soup," "It's Only Rock 'n' Roll" and "Black And Blue."

And it doesn't end there. The band will continue their reissue campaign with Universal Music Group with the reissue of "Some Girls," "Emotional Rescue," "Tattoo You" and "Undercover," out on June 9th in the US and June 8th worldwide.

The third round of reissues will follow soon thereafter with "Dirty Work," "Steel Wheels," "Voodoo Lounge," "Bridges To Babylon" and their most recent album of all new material, "A Bigger Bang."

Astute fans will notice the absence of the masterful "Exile On Main St." from the release schedule. Hailed by Rolling Stone magazine, where "Exile On Main St." was rated the 7th Greatest Album Of All Time, as "Jagger and Richards' definitive songwriting statement of outlaw pride and dedication to grit," no one has forgotten about the marquee album, least of all The Rolling Stones. A late 2009 reissue of "Exile On Main St." is being planned as part of a wider celebration that will accompany its release.

In a nod to the band's diehard fans, UMG will also be releasing a collector's box in which to house all 14 post-1971 studio albums, as well as making the catalogue newly available digitally.

THE ROLLING STONES - UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP REMASTERS SERIES 2009 - Part 1

'Anonymous', (NOT ME) stole my torrent from Demonoid and shared it here. The torrent is not available here and I don't know why. I tried to upload the part 1 torrent myself but I got a message saying "the torrent is already on the system", but it's not, or at least, I couldn't find it. Thank you very much 'Anonymous' for stealing my torrent without permission.

Because I can't share it here, you could download part 1 from Mininova.
