Should be required reading in all our shcools."
,asc11,2009-09-04T05:28Z,"Your efforts are appreciated, of course. But my reward for my torrents is NOT ""Thanks!"" from people, but rather their downloading, reading or watching (as the case may be), AND passing the material on -- by seeding, using other p2p means, and in person. Yours, too, I imagine."
,brianxxx,2009-09-04T23:18Z,"Cool! I dig Ron Paul. Many of his ideas would never work, some are just plain nuts..but at least the guy is thinking outside the box and voicing it. That takes balls! More than I can say for the other conservatives hiding behind Rush Limbaugh's stupidity."
,4lib3rty,2009-09-05T00:43Z,"^^^ Proof that if you tell a lie long enough, no matter how stupid and contrary to common sense it is, people will actually buy into it."
,ruthlessrl,2009-09-15T11:03Z,"wow that was quick thanks for the up!!!

and brainxxx I'm not going to bash you but you are just parrotting Glenn Beck or somebody.

Everything Paul has been pushing for has gotten this country to where it is today."
,flick22,2009-09-20T04:44Z,"I can't wait to 'read' this one!
MUCH thanks to - 4lib3rty!"
,Ardeet,2009-10-31T08:37Z,"Thanks 4lib3rty.
I know I shouldn't bite at LenninistStalinist but to base a refutation of capitalism on a flawed premise that deaths attributable to communism and fascism are quantifiable certainly gave me a chuckle."
[V],big_dad_e,2009-11-16T08:52Z,Ron Paul 2012!  Thanks m8!
,jdogg412,2009-12-04T20:58Z,"Please don't insult Dr. Ron Paul by calling him a conservative brianxxx. His ideas to end the warfare /welfare state will work, starting by ending fed powers to inflate. Thanks for the upload!"
,Shawntay,2009-12-17T16:36Z,"Ron Paul was great in Borat.  He's so brave to come out of the closet, given his conservative base.  Good for him!"
,Saveno,2009-12-22T00:05Z,thank you good book
,waleyejim,2010-06-09T13:46Z,Thank you 4lib3rty and all those who appreciate freedom and understand what the loss would mean...

,sunman11,2011-08-21T03:27Z,"A great book people would be interested in would be the book,
Basic Training For Revolutionaries. It was once in hard copy format and then it was banned. You can read more about it here.
