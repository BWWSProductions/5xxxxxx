This is my VERY FIRST upload of a TV-cap ever, so I can't guarantee quality or compatibility. If you download it, please comment on that. BTW, this file is the same content as part 6 (out of 7) from (it won't let me include the m*i*n*i*n*o*v*a torrent #2660549 here) My version has a very narrow band of barcode-looking stripes at the top, and sometimes freezes at the beginning of play or when seeking using the VLC player, but when I hit the restart button it always playes through well and has higher def than that other torrent.
