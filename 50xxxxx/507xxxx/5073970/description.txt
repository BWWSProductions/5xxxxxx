The Mighty Isis was the comic book adaptation of The Secrets of Isis TV Series produced by Filmation in the 1970s.  Although Isis is often cited as a DC creation, the series is one of the very few Filmation originals.  The character was created specifically for the television series and was only later adapted for comics.  A considerably reworked version of the character (though still connected with Captain Marvel and given the name Adrianna Tomaz in honor of the television character's secret identity) was introduced in the 2006 comic series 52 and its novelization by Greg Cox.

Andrea Thomas, a high school science teacher finds an ancient mystical amulet on an archeological dig in Egypt. The amulet belonged to Hatshepsut, an ancient Egyptian Queen and it gives the wearer the powers of Isis.  Andrea, by virtue of being able to open the casing in which the amulet rested, was recognized as an heir to Isis's secrets. Whenever Isis was needed, Andrea would reveal the amulet and incite the incantation "Oh, mighty Isis!" and she would be transformed into the goddess Isis.
