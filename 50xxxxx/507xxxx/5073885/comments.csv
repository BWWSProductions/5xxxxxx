""tpb will be a legal site within a monthWe knew the Pirate Bay was crossing itself, spouting off a Hail Mary or five and turning into a legal filesharing site soon, but know we know when. The turbulent buyout is going through, with the deal to be closed inside a month. 
TorrentFreak reports that the Pirate Bay?s soon to be owner, Swedish company GGF, successfuly pushed the buy?s approval through with its shareholders, meaning transfer of ownership of the infamous site will take place within a month.
So what happens when the Pirate Bay as we know it scuttles the ship? The GGF has some unusual plans: as well as letting the entertainment indystry remove illegal files, they include paying the biggest filesharers for all that time and data they?ve sent to others.""

,bloodhungry7,2009-08-31T07:41Z,"im not sure which garbage should be burnt first this pile of steaming dung or the new halloween? These are the reasons why ppl pirate because these movies holloywood makes isnt even worth the toilet-paper i wipe my ass with! This and the new halloween are the 2 worst movies of this year so far! I hope that the actors directors and any indaviduals involved in the making of these are burned at a stake, so as to never tarnish my eyes with such crap movies ever again. I never bitch but seriously i wish these 2 movies were bannished from the film vaults and lock in a dungeon with Bin Ladin! GOD AWFUL PREDICTABLE JUNK AND AS BORING AS THEY COME! i give this film a -100 on all scales kill the ppl involved in the making!"
