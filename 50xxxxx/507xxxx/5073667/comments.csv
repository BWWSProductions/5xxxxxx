,theone_nr,2009-08-30T15:08Z,Allready downloaded from another place ! First after download load the 2 parts in VirtualDub and resave using direct stream copy option.After that runs perfect ! PS. For burning and play in stand alone divx players you must unpack the bitstream and/or demux-remux audio stream witch is VBR and not CBR ! ;-) Enjoy this release !
