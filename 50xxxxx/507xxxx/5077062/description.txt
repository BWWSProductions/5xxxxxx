Into the Groove: Beautiful Small Machines are undoubtedly one of my favourite discoveries of 2009 so far. Check out all the songs on their MySpace, because there's not one track on there that I can't say I absolutely love!.

The Fleshy Fresh: They've created a refreshing, crisp sound that indie-lovers will enjoy as much as anyone who just listens for the hook.

Battery in your leg: It's a bit like Grandaddy, The Postal Service and The Ting Tings forming a super band.
