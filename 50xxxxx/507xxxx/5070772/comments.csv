I recorded this show at 1am and FOX interrupted the show because of Ted Kennedy, and my dad was disappointed that we couldn't see it, and I said ""that's okay, I'll just download it off BitTorrent.""

If I had recorded this at 6:00, I could have used my capture card to upload it myself.  Oh well..."
