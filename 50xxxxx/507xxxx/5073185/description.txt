Approaching Normal - Blue October [2009]
	

Blue October continue their postâ€“grunge whinefest on Approaching Normal, which actually approaches intolerable. Singer Justin Furstenfeld packs enough melodrama into "Weight of the World" to shame Bono and Meat Loaf combined. Over a spare martial beat, Furstenfeld's clenchedâ€“teeth vocals might make for decent tragicomedy if not for selfâ€“indulgent pathos like "I stole the pillowcase to clean this mess I've made of someone's dream." He growls out a torture fantasy in "Dirt Room" and gets sensitive on "My Never." But even Furstenfeld's pleas for redemption in "Blue Skies" can't stop this downward spiral. Mark Kemp, Rolling Stone
