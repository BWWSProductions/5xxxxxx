,rebkean,2009-09-05T11:47Z,"It's like it hasen't been cleaned or something.
I don't know how to explain it, nobody else with a problem? Or has it worked for everyone else?"

,Gdubble,2009-09-06T11:47Z,"worked for me. ran update, no probs.

am ruunng pal wii, with wiikey."
,Gdubble,2009-09-06T11:55Z,"you cannot brickblock or try to bypass the update. both this and beatles need some Wad installed to work or else u will get black screen.

am running a pal wii w/- wiikey - ran the update off pal Beatles RB & GH5 worked straight away. "
,Gdubble,2009-09-06T11:59Z,above comment from Markuf GH5 torrent. I would d/l the GH5 from ur region (ntsc OR pal) then run the update and the pal beatles might work then...
,rebkean,2009-09-06T12:29Z,"I'm a little scared to push the button, since I don't know what chip is installed. Perhaps it's completely safe, but how can I know that...."
,gekwataru,2009-09-10T15:43Z,"Working on softmodded NTSC wii with NeoGamma loader, no update necesssary."
,rebkean,2009-09-10T22:15Z,"Didn't get that either, but I don't even know what chip is in it, so maybe I should open it up and check it out first..."
,BluCrayon,2009-09-14T01:30Z,"im using neogamma to launch the game, but tis completely in black and white. anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it."
,Dare2share,2009-09-15T14:57Z,"Works for me. Didn't do the update but I started the game with Gecko OS from the homebrew-channel. Same works for GH5.
Great game by the way, the first Rockband game that works with my GH3-guitar :-)
Thanks for the upload!"
,rebkean,2009-09-20T23:13Z,"So, finally I jumped into the unknown,
pushed the button to to the update,
and what do you know, IT WORKED!!!!
No problems what so ever, hah. =)
Thanks Gdubble!!!"
