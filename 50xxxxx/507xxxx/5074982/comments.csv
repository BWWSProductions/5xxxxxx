I mean, things have moved on in the last 7 years. I was downloading 700mb DVD rips literally over 7 years ago.

It would seem that me and Sensitive Sid are the only ones who've evolved with the times. I can't get down to 400mb for 2 hours, but I can damn well get less than 700.

Good job man. Keep it up, I'm going to download everything you releases."
