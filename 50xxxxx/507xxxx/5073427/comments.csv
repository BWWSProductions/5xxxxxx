,aarque,2009-08-31T09:16Z,"matdua, you just have to leave your computer connected to the internet with your bit torrent client open until you see there are several seeders. After that your files will continue to be shared without you having to remain connected."
,madasahatter,2009-08-31T11:07Z,"tbh i dont think he`s got a problem of seeding as such....i think he`s not putting the .torrent file in his download directory.
Once you create your torrent you need to upload to TPB .   then  you need to right click on "" Download this torrent""  and select save Target as , then save it into the directory you are uploading the file from."
