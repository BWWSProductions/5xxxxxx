This program can be used to automatically shutdown, restart, log off, disconnect or hibernate your computer. There are four triggers that can be used: at a certain time, after a certain time, when the CPU usage goes down or when you get disconnected from the internet. This means that your computer doesn't have to be on any longer then necessary. The program hides in the system tray when running so it can be easily aborted and gives the option of a 5-60 second countdown. You can also set the program with the command line for use at the end of a batch file or if you frequently use the same settings.

works on:
