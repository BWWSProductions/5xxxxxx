,RonFez12to3,2009-09-04T23:07Z,"Oh yeah, Goose, what i wanted was the worst of the week (wrestling interviews). It comes on at 9am and goes for 5 hours. If you can't do it i suppose i'll sign up for the free trail of xm. "
[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-05T00:22Z,Alright I scheduled it to record. I'll edit it and get it up Sat or Sun when I have time. 
,RonFez12to3,2009-09-05T01:42Z,Dude you are the absolute best. I can't thank you enough. 
,comefly2,2009-09-05T04:25Z,"Goose, if you can give me an email address (just a made up gmail one is probably best, since posting an address here is an invite for spam!), I have some questions about how to easily capture/remove commercials/up. 

I wouldn't mind trying to throw the episodes online...but I don't have the slightest clue how to do it! 

Or, an even more anonymous way... could you just put the instructions in a notepad file and up it as a torrent/piggyback it with the next episode?

Thanks!"
