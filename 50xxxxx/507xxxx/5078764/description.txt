Patrice Oneal in-studio. 

Note: I'm doing some infrastructure upgrades in 
the next few weeks which should lead to earlier 
ups. That's the good news. The bad news is I'm planning 
on "retiring" from posting O&A (it's simply a logistics
thing) in December of this year. No point in upping
when someone else could be doing it faster. That's 3 
months to find a reliable O&A upper to serve the pests.
