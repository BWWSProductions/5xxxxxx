,probizzle,2009-09-03T01:29Z,is this real? Odst doesnt come out till the 22 of sept
,Magicmilk,2009-09-03T11:56Z,yes this is the real ODST but it is in French spoken language. It leaked from some retail store in france and now MS is punishing the players for playing this game too early when MS should be taking it out on that retail store that doesnt know how to keep inventory in the box until the release date!
,MQFPLO,2009-09-03T12:34Z,"Yes, it's real, but it's in French language and have english and spanish subs... maybe more"
,Procrasturbate,2009-09-03T23:40Z,"Dont make the mistake of connecting to XBLive with this game in play, they are automatically deleting accounts and banning 360 Serial numbers for pirated ODST.  http://www.gamersspot.com/interceptor.php?op=getnews&news_id=8970"

,Pro_Pirate_,2009-09-07T00:11Z,please people do not play this unless you never intend to use xbox live again. The is not good rip. It may past stralth checks but as mentioned alot before: it had 1 missing rar file casing the iso to have missing data causing your xbox to get caught and banned.
,Pro_Pirate_,2009-09-07T00:12Z,i meant stealth checks
