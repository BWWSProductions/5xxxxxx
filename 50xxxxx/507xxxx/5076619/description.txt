Halo 3: ODSTâ€™s tale focuses on the legendary ODSTs or â€œOrbital Drop Shock Troopersâ€ as they drop into the ruined city of New Mombasa, looking for clues behind the Covenantâ€™s catastrophic attack on the city.
The new campaign chapter predates the events that unfold in â€œHalo 3â€³ and gives players a new perspective through the eyes of a new hero in the â€œHaloâ€ universe. New multiplayer maps ensure that the award-winning Xbox LIVE experience of â€œHalo 3â€³ continues to thrive.
