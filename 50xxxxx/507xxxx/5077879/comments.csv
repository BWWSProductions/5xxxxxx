,projectrico,2009-09-07T08:32Z,WHy is this so slow been downloading for a day and its only at 50%
,bonzaixx1,2009-10-11T06:08Z,"I know chuchunesme already said it doesn't pass stealth, but does that mean that it's not safe to buy DLC for the game, or does it only mean that it's not safe to play online?"
