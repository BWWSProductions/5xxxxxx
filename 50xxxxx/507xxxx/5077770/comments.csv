,markj1871,2009-10-03T04:04Z,Thanx for the season. My jaw was dropped for 30 minutes after the season finale. The worst cancellation of a show in my life!

Also, even though I was going to still watch these until I downloaded another set, I quickly found-out the files wouldn't play latter, even though they had when I gave them a trial run when the torrent finished. The search continues..."

Although, when you think about it, the whole Sarah Connor story has a serious flaw as a concept for a series - if the good guys win, there's no story."
