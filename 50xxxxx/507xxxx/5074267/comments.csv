Yeah, sorry about that. I never knew about that 12th track at the time because it was a special edition version. You're going to have to find it somewhere else on TPB now. :("

It's a nice album. Heard Smashing The Opponent (Tap Tap Revenge 4) and Project 100 and those song are amazing. I noticed that they are both from this album. Gonna download this... Thanks for the upload :)"
