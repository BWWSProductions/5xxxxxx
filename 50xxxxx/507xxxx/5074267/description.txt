The legendary Psy Trance act, hailing from Kiryat Yam, Israel have always been recognized for their solid rythms and their continuous success with every single album. Their most recent album, Vicious Delicious (2007; BNE), saw IM adding guitars into the mix. Vicious Delicious had an airy blend of Psychedelic rock, Heavy Metal, Trance and Electronica. Some songs such as Artillery even had Rap/Nu Metal influences.

Legend Of The Black Shawarma is said to have a similiar sound, IM stating in a interview a few months back, that this album would be a combination of Progressive Metal and Psychedelic Trance. Long live!
