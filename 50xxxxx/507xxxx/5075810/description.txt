Hello folks,

I didn't had too much time for the playlist from this month.
Was pretty busy in real life and some projects.

The bitrate is much higher compared to the previous list.
A few older tracks in it. Most stuff is new. I was rather picky this time.

The bad news are, I can't come up with Part II of my Albums of the year
right now.
1. My cam doesn't work
2. Most of the albums are still on their way to me

But I will include a big amount of album pics & text in the next month.
Sorry for that.

Also thanks to blalock for the cover (really had no time for that :))

Thanks for reading...
Enjoy!
