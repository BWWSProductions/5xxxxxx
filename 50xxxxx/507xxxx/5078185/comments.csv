,TDG,2009-11-13T01:14Z,"**Warning**

This torrent has viruses kids, and no it's not ""false positives"" there are none to do that. This has trojans deep in the files.

Darksides is clean and I've used it for years!
This and the uniblue 2010 have viruses.


Just use the serial and download legit from website!!"

,bman09,2009-12-10T01:05Z,Make sure you have .net 3.5 runtimes installed I kept running into problems installing it on machines without .net.  Took me a bit to figure out because it didn't actually warn you that it needed to be installed first and would crash during install.
