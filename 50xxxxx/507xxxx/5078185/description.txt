Speed, stability and system updates delivered in one simple package.

Uniblueâ€™s PowerSuite 2009 combines RegistryBooster, SpeedUpMyPC and DriverScanner, creating the ultimate solution for updating your PC and delivering improved system stability and increased computer speeds.

The problem
Your PC is a complex combination of advanced technologies which needs managing to get the best from it. Without regular updates, the drivers your PC uses to run all of its hardware, can become obsolete. Unless cleaned, your systemâ€™s registry will become disordered and bloated. And there are a whole range of other system changes, network boosts and disk cleanups which you need to run regularly, to keep your computer running optimally.

The solution
Anti-virus products are important, but alone wonâ€™t guarantee your PCâ€™s privacy and performance. Combining three powerful Uniblue utilities in one package PowerSuite helps ensure total system speed and security. DriverScanner updates drivers to improve network and hardware functionality. RegistryBooster scans and defrags your PCâ€™s registry removing harmful entries. Finally SpeedUpMyPC wipes sensitive files and implements various performance enhancements.

   * Maximize your computerâ€™s processing power
   * Accelerate data download speeds
   * Scan, backup and update your PC drivers
   * Scan and optimize your PCâ€™s registry, improving system stability
