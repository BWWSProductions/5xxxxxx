Where can I get Google earth pro,...?"
,mnfesq,2009-09-06T00:51Z,"The good news is that this is actually Google Earth Pro and it appears to be totally clean.  The bad news is that it's version 4.2 from November 2007.  I still have yet to find a clean, legit version of Google Earth Pro 5.x.  This is still a very good app."

,Valknude,2009-12-02T06:41Z,"STUPID STUPID people...
Software companys PAY AntiVirus developers to detect keygens at patch programs and announce/repport 'em as trojans,worms,hijackers and other harmful programs to prevent rookies from downloading an installing pirated software.
Got the warning with patch, keygen and cracks every time i downloaded a program needed online reg and guess what? NO VIRUS OR OTHER HARMFULL SOFTWARE FOUND.
Ever....
Allow the patch or program by the actual filename in your antivir software.... Then scan...or unpack and scan."

,Lonepup,2010-06-17T04:53Z,"That was exactly my thought - anyone sharing a virus free torrent with a ""Pink Skull"" is trusted and knows what the hell he/she is doing!

I just installed this on my windows 7.

Here were my usual steps:

1) Disabled NAV to scan compressed files while 
    d/l this.

2) Disabled NAV (offline) for 15 mins duration.

3) Ran the google.......exe prog in Admin mode.
4)  Ran the patch in Admin mod.
5) Started google;  ran the update feature.

Everything works. Enabled NAV and as I was writing this, NAV detected and deleted the patch.exe.

NOTE: NAV has grown more powerful over the years, and I have found it beneficial to have the NAV Compressed File Check disabled, otherwise a lot of my torrent files will get deleted.

If there is some question, then a full virus scan should be done after installing a program.

I noticed S.J. did not reply to the lamers and newbies complaining about viruses and I wouldn't waste my time either. Again - having a Pink Skull says enough about the integrity of the torrent contents. "
