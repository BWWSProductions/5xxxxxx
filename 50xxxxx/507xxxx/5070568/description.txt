To resolve "system cannot find the path specified" uncheck files in Girls AloudSingles(2007) Sexy! No No No folder causes this torrent to fail.

Utorrent: On following problem files!! After d/l is completed, individually right click, select download priority of file include again then select "relocate" say download to desktop, right click start torrent. Will recheck all contents & commence. You can then move them back into their respected folder once done.

This will then give you the torrent in its entirety:
