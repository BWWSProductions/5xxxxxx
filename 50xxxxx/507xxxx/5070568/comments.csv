Problem: One Single is named '(2007) Sexy! No No No...'. I use Windows 2000 with ÂľTorrent 1.8.3. The download always stops when files from this folder are starting to download because Windows can't handle it's name. It creates '(2007) Sexy! No No No' without the points at the end, ÂľTorrent can't find the expected folder, the download stops.
What can I do?
Thanks for any help."
