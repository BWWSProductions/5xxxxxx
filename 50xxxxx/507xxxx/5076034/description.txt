This is the copy from the original disk, which is only accessible to Microsoft's technicians. This version of Microsoft Office 2007 will never appear for sale, since this is the only version where there is no need for a serial. This version also doesnâ€™t need an activation. The installer is very simple, undetailed and handy. The interface of application is completely changed, it is modernized and practically reminds in no way to the previous versions.
