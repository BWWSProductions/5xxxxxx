,Carnefex,2009-09-17T17:26Z,"DVD:\\tinyiso\tinyiso.exe 
Is a self extracting trojan that will unpack and attempt to mount itself inside your temp files and proceed to attempt to create a backdoor to your system. 
After you've downloaded the .iso, use MagicIso to open the image, remove tinyiso.exe, then resave the image. This will allow you to keep a clean image. 
The no-dvd .exe can be gotten from GCW if you don't trust the one on file. The update is clean. 

Cheers extreme, for the good upload."

,JonnyBigPotatoes,2009-11-03T14:22Z,"Hi Guys

Now I don't want to offend anyone, but I am Mac user...

I've just got hold of a fairly decent PC and really want to play this game (as anyone knows, games aren't exactly Mac's strong point).

However...

I've downloaded all files, mounted the ISO file, installed the app, run the update and....have got stuck at the 'copy crack' bit...

I have created a disc image of the game, but when I try and play, it just ignores this and asks me to insert the X3 DVD. I know I'm missing - well probably a lot, but any advice would be much appreciated - the game looks awesome!"
,White_Flare,2009-11-14T05:33Z,"@JonnyBigPotatoes
Try download a NO-CD crack. normally places like gamecopyworld will have them(its what i use) hope that helps and cheers on picking up a PC =D"
,freemmaann,2009-11-29T22:02Z,40 KB/s pff.. i know that you have already heard this like million times but SEED! :) ill seed it also (atleast once i have atleast 1% of it) -.-
,fallenre,2009-12-01T05:52Z,"I downloaded and installed as Carnefex had said, but when i finally get to play it on my system a window will pop up that says ""Insufficient Priveledges:  You must be an admin when you run this program for the first time.""  So, i right-click and run as admin but it still doesnt work.   Ideas?"
,squirr3lly,2010-01-15T02:55Z,i tried the no-cd crack from gcw but it is still asking me for the original dvd need help
,Mrtvacina,2010-02-22T17:58Z,"dont go tinyiso\tinyiso.exe it have troyan.
Just download latest patch to 2.5 and all is ok"
,sps2000,2010-03-03T16:36Z,Dont download takes ages and dosen' work.
,Sp4ztic,2010-03-27T07:22Z,"No need to crack it. Just tell it to update, the most recent version (2.5) removes the protection.

Thanks extremezone, works perfectly and it is a wonderful game. So much to do, so much to learn."

,natureman,2010-06-14T23:51Z,"Works great.  If you like buy it.  Lot of effort  put into this.  Im going to buy it.  

Thanks for the download.  Keep up the Good work!!"
,Jewlion23,2010-07-22T02:19Z,"Installs fine, the update is okay. I didn't use the crack because comodo kept saying that a trojan was trying to auto install every time I opened the folder it was in. So fuck that.

But I'm having an issue where the keyboard doesn't work at all. I'm not sure what's causing this, but I'm sure that this game would suck to play with a mouse."
,Ridman,2011-02-05T18:50Z,guys please seed im stuck on 30%
,captainginu,2011-03-06T07:27Z,"could some1 post a tutorial on how to install cant seem to get it to work keep geting the same error message, im pretty new at this so its probably me doing something wrong"
,DiscoPony,2011-03-26T20:52Z,"Forget about using the crack, just install the game and then install the official 1.01 to 3.00 patch from the Egosoft website.  They removed copy protection so no crack needed at all."
