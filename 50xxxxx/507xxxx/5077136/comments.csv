,megatoto,2009-09-08T05:11Z,This release is broken : only MP1 & MP2 work. MP3 is corrupted due to bad dump. Other release work 100% MP3 run fine if you get the right release not this one.

All 3 works Great!! Thanks Markuf!! Keep up the good work.
Also For those who cant get it to work.. You will have to install cIOS38_rev17(google it) and use any version of Neogamma set alt.dol to disc, force NTSC480i and use main dol to launch the game so you can create a save file using your Mii(keep in mind you will not be able to launch any of the games here). Then restart your Wii use your Neogamma(any Version) and select individual disc.dol for the respective game you want to play.
Good luck!! and CHEERS WiiSOS. You are the BEST!!!!!!"
