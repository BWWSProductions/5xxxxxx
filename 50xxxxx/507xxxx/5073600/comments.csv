,Pennyforth,2009-09-07T02:28Z,"The scan of Wonder Woman #35 needs to be fixed--the image of the second-to-last page won't load in CDisplay.  I've re-downloaded the file several times, and it's the same flaw each time.

But hey, it's free, right?  And much love to all the folks out there who take the time to scan these books for the rest of us.  I can only make it to my ""local"" shop every 2-3 weeks (the ""local"" shop being about 40 miles away), and scans help tide me over until I can get my hands on the physical copies.  Thanks, everyone!"
