,jiveclive,2009-09-01T07:18Z,"Erm, well, what about the Russian Mafia? I read somewhere they formented the revolution so they could exploit the aftermant of confusion. But they didn't anticipate Stalin, a mofo with a mean streak 4 kilometers wide and all of it downhill. So then the Russian mafia did a deal with the masons and the illuminati and the Sicilian mafia, and got permission to move to Brooklyn, NY. 

There they basturds laid low for two point something generations, but when Ronnie Ray-gun became POTUS, they struck a deal with him that he would snuff out communism and the Mafioso basturds could move back to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other outlying areas and basically continue where they left off two point something generations earlier. They ran the whores, the booze, the blow, the hashish, and the porn biz. 

They have an anthem song, also, the Beatles, Revolution. And they all on a first name relationship with Vladimir Putin. They call him ""Vladdy Boy' and make jokes about how Bush looked into his soul, then they fall all over their asses laughing, ""What soul? You ain't got no soul, Vladdy Boy. That Dubya is something else. We got to send him pretzels for Christmas."" 

The really daring fellas like to put on Red Hot Chili Peppers when Vladdy Boy is around, so they can get all up in his face singing, ""What I got you got ta get it Putin it in you.. . ."" It's the only time they ever see Putin smile. Sometimes he gets his grove on, does some thug moves on the floor and shouts, ""Damn straight, aight!"" Then it's vodka for everyone. "
