Someone seed please!!"
,Bandelero1,2009-09-06T23:14Z,"loads of us stuck at 86.3-86.4, please seed if you've got it! Gone nowhere for a couple of days now, you can't just upload a huge torrent like this and leave it before enough people have it to ensure proper seeding. 

ajneseri I'm confident it's the real deal, it's not a new film and the sample is definitely HD and the right film. "
