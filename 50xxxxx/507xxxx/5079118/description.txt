================================================================================
The Legion of Doom consists of Chad Blinman and Trever Keith (of the California punk band Face to Face). The two formed The Legion of Doom in 2004 to focus on a series of unique creative projects.

The first of these projects was Incorporated, a mash-up album featuring mixes of various punk and hardcore bands. The album was completed in 2006, but due to some of the artists unwilling to allow the album to be released,[1] the group intentionally leaked the album onto the P2P Networks.[2] On March 6, 2007 the album was released in physical format through Illegal Art.[3]

The Legion of Doom has also contributed remixes and original music to film soundtracks such as Underworld: Evolution, Saw II and TV Show[4]. Other projects in the works include the original score and music supervision for independent film "Eyes Front", an album of original material, and drum and sample sets.

During several The Legion Of Doom songs, a male and a female voice can be heard speaking at certain points. These are the voices of Ken and Winnie from the 1950 movie "This Charming Couple". On the song "Lolita's Medicine" on the album "Incorporated", the male voice is from a 1967 anti-drug PSA called "Narcotics: Pit of Despair."
