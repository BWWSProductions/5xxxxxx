Physx settings will now show at the bottom... setting High recommends using a 9800gtx+ for dedicated Physx... ran fine on my GTX280 1920x1200"

,GamerDude76,2009-09-07T07:33Z,Is it possible to enable Physx by adding a -DX10 command to the original Startup .EXE? Without having to download the demo just to get that 1 file?

If your having trouble in the game with grapple or anything in general. There is a trainer on Gamecopyworld that will let you use the number pad to move on the X Y and Z axis.

Here is the link http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2009&f=Batman_Arkham_Asylum_V1.0_Plus_4_Trainer_By_KelSat!rar

Enjoy ^_^"
