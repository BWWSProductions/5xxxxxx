On your piratebay upload torrent page
goto --> Image tag from bayimg - - - click on the bayimg link which will open a new page.

Click the browse button to find your image on your computer.
Goto --> Removal Code and enter a password [one that you will remember]
Goto --> Tags, I dont bother with tags [i just put only1joe in there.]
Goto --> Settings and click on it. A sub menu opens. Click on Resize image, and highlight --> 300 x 300 TPB - Image Torrent

Now click UPLOAD

After a minute or less, your image will be uploaded.

Here is an example of what you should see

http://bayimg.com/oADpmaacI

all you need is the last 9 letters/numbers on the image [just double click them, and copy them]

--> oADpmaacI

Now go back to your piratebay torrent upload page and paste in Image tag from bayimg box

When you have finished making your torrent and uploaded it, you should have a picture on your uploaded page.
