,rumsfeld69,2009-12-22T08:59Z,"Quality is actually on the shitty side of mediocre. It should look a hell of a lot better for 1.37GB DVD rip. Resolution is only 640 x 272, and the picture is dark and lacking detail. For me it was a nuke."
,rumsfeld69,2009-12-22T09:03Z,"This is a cam, albeit a high-quality one."
,mamou50,2010-01-02T20:22Z,"Excellent quality and great movie.
