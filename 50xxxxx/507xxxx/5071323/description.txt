"In 2001, Brigham Young Universityâ€™s Continuing Education Department, the Religious Education Department, and the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History held a conference at BYU to commemorate the second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Brigham Young (1801-1877), his legacy, and his influence on the LDS Church and its pioneer history. Several scholars spoke about various aspects of Brigham Young's life and his philosophy to celebrate his birth two hundred years ago."
