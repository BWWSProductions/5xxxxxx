,Xel6000,2009-09-03T21:32Z,How about saves and glide? does they both work here?
,IronBars,2009-09-03T21:49Z,I sure would like my save and glide yes.... :)
[T],Knaster,2009-09-03T22:36Z,"Here's a glide fix i posted on another torrent

You can fix the Glide/run issue by doin this:

Find the BaseInput.ini file right click it and in properties remove write protection press apply.

In the file find the word ""SpaceBar"" and change it to the key of your choosing i chosed ""RightShift"" (notice the big letter of the word.)

Then save the file and close, now right click it again and in properties reapply write protection.

Now in the game the glide issue is solved VOILA!!!"
,IronBars,2009-09-03T22:43Z,sounds great guyes...will try it out :)

I even switched the entire Demo pack with the retail.  

As of now, I've canceled my PC based pre-order given these issues.  I simply have zero faith that these issues won't carry over to the the paying customers!

Good going dumbasses!   In order to combat piracy, you're killing sales too!  Especially from me, since I'm a 100% try before buy type guy (and I will definitely buy, I have multiple versions of games on my shelf - especially when they're released on separate platforms)."

,StefanGavrila,2009-09-04T11:45Z,"I think the game has another ""security point"" in the second Scarecrow level. When I reach the small tower with the 2 spinning wheels on it a grappling gun target should appear so I can get to the top, but it doesn't.  Does anyone else have this problem?"
,_Metal_Guitar_,2009-09-04T14:41Z,"@nagumo, you're an idiot. You can't say this game has all these faults, because it hasn't even been released yet. Its got two weeks before it hits the stores. I highly doubt this leaked, buggy version is representative of the final product, as the demo ran without any flaws what so ever.

If you can't live with the problems, just wait for the final release."
,n-t0wn,2009-09-04T21:00Z,"@StefanGavrila:

I got the exact same problem! It's not possible to finish the game this way... it needs to be fixed"

its actually the third scarecrow level"
,johnniebrasco,2009-09-04T21:41Z,"Just download the updated crackfix. I haven't had any problems. at least so far, played for an hour or so. The problem is not the game but the crack"
,n-t0wn,2009-09-04T21:49Z,i've been playing for several hours now. finished 39% of the game and im in the 3rd scarecrow level but it's bugged. cant finish the game.
,333def,2009-09-05T03:11Z,so are people having the issue with the scarecrow level with the updated crack?
,n-t0wn,2009-09-05T03:39Z,"yea seems like theres some more work to do... 
there are some other glitches i didnt mention yet: there are some platforms outside of the map which u grapple by accident. by doing so u get stuck on one of these platforms and ur not able to get back into the map. only solution is to load a checkpoint but u can avoid these if ur careful.

but the 3rd scarecrow lvl definitely doesnt work for me. others reported similar bugs on the 2nd scarecrow lvl but i cant confirm that."

Thanks for those who help."
,AznBoy222,2009-09-05T19:16Z,Take the Setup and put it in the same location as the data files. Just take it out of that folder and put in where the Data files are.

I have done 11% of the game =)"
,lilipop,2009-09-05T22:18Z,"It works for me...sry...my english is not so good ^^
I just copy the crack and it works.
Perhaps you must try some things to get it to work.

And when it works, please write a comment =)"
,IronBars,2009-09-06T00:04Z,"I can just say: Great!!!
It all works..save, glide, physix as far as I can tell.....all good :)

I was worried that it was a fake link cause of the popup-site the crack was downloaded from.

Thanks alot!!"
,IronBars,2009-09-06T00:08Z,I run it on vista 64 btw. Game kicks ass! :P

,smm2k9,2009-09-08T21:58Z,"good people,

I heard there is a bad bug in the d2d version that prevents you from going further in the game, namely you can't get into the botanical gardens due to blocked tree/plant at the entrance:

http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/batman-arkham-asylum-poison-ivy-savegame-499782/


I am going to try this now. Hopefully it lets me keep going to finish the game.

cheers."
,Italiano83,2009-09-09T06:53Z,i won the game already .. and i had the d2d version.. i didnt had that invisble wall problem.. but i did had that one when fighting ivy.. you somehow get into a endless falling animation with all teh screen black.. but it was easily solved by restarting the checkpoint....
,Arkyfox,2009-09-09T18:57Z,"
If your having trouble in the game with grapple or anything in general. There is a trainer on Gamecopyworld that will let you use the number pad to move on the X Y and Z axis.

Here is the link http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2009&f=Batman_Arkham_Asylum_V1.0_Plus_4_Trainer_By_KelSat!rar

,Realmjumper,2009-09-13T09:11Z,Finally finished the d/l and applied the crack from another torrent. Works great ppl. 
[T],dramacore,2009-09-15T04:11Z,when i try to run setup it says not enough hard drive space.. before i'm even given an option to pick what drive i want to install it to. that's kind of shitty.  are all d2d games like that?  i don't use my OS drive to play games. maybe it's trying to install there.  bah
,Wakko551,2009-09-15T06:49Z,when i try to play it says for me to sign into windows live then when i do it asks for the key production code or something like that and i dont have one so it wont let me save my game is there a way around this?

It will only works for 20% of who have the game ""BATMAN ARKHAM ASYLUM"".....This is a collection of comments/complates over net  



 1.  Extract Batman.Arkham.Asylum.FullRip-KaOs

 2.  Install Batman.Arkham.Asylum.UpDate.V1.1Fix-KaOs (I think it not necessary)

 3.  You need .Net Frame Work1 Service Pack 1 (I think it not necessary)

 4.  You need .Net Frame Work2 Service Pack 1

 5.  You need .Net Frame Work3 Service Pack 1 

 6.  You need .Net Frame Work3.5 Service Pack 1

 7.  Update your directx

 8.  Move ""My Documents"" from C:\Dcuments and settings\.... to D:\Documents.

 9.  Install Games for windows by ""gfwlivesetupmin.exe""

 10. Copy ""msvcr70.dll"" to C:\windows\system\ and make the file into hidden and read-only.Some times its virus.

 12. Update your video card driver (I think it not necessary)

 13. If you want to enable PhysX, Change the ""PhysXLevel=0"" to ""PhysXLevel=1"" in the 
     file E:\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config\BmEngine.ini

 14. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT! (Even, I am not garantee about working)

 15. If you installed PowerDvD, its process may will affect the game (I think it not necessary)

 And enjoy you're game !
