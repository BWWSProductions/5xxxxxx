  From Recorded Books:

There is no more decorated American writer living today than Philip Roth, the New York Times best-selling author of American Pastoral, The Human Stain, and The Plot Against America. He has won a Pulitzer Prize, two National Book Awards, two National Book Critics Circle Awards, two PEN/Faulkner Awards, and numerous other distinctions. The hero of Everyman is obsessed with mortality. As he reminds himself at one point, â€œIâ€™m thirty-four! Worry about oblivion when youâ€™re seventy-five.â€ But he cannot help himself. He is the ex-husband in three marriages gone wrong. He is the father of two sons who detest him, despite a daughter who adores him. And as his health worsens, he is the envious brother of a much fitter man. A masterful portrait of one manâ€™s inner struggles, Everyman is a brilliant showcase for one of the worldâ€™s most distinguished novelists.

  From AudioFileMagazine.com:

Philip Roth's extraordinary book examines the decline and death of a Jewish advertising executive. Though its subject matter--human deterioration and death--may not seem like the first choice for the morning commute, the narrative is compelling and, in the hands of narrator George Guidall, thoroughly listenable. Guidall conveys the full spectrum of Roth's palette--fear, bewilderment, anger, humor, denial, and acceptance--with a transparency that's present in the best audiobooks. It's as if you are inside the author's mind. From the opening funeral scene to (some four hours later) the unsuccessful surgery at the end, this is great literature that seems to become more universal in spoken-word format
