[T],Knaster,2009-09-03T23:25Z,thx Swebarb. You're right it was the PhysX
,_Metal_Guitar_,2009-09-04T10:04Z,"I think the PhysX just isn't working in this game version, On the B:AA forums they claim the Sep 15th release date was to properly implement things like PhysX. So I'm not toooo surprised a 2 week early release is flawed. "
,1x3,2009-09-04T14:53Z,"Update: How to enable PhysX

If the option to turn on PhysX is missing from the in game menu, try the following.

1. Browse to directory C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config
2. Open UserEngine.ini file with a text editor such as Notepad.
3. Change the line PhysXLevel=0 so that it reads PhysXLevel=1
4. Save and close the file. Run the game

Note: Forcing PhysX on a non-PhysX supported video card is not recommended. Also please make sure you have the latest PhysX system software installed on your machine.

EDIT: Some users on several gaming forums have reported crashes after enabling PhysX. We don?t know if this was due to forcing PhysX on an unsupported card, not having the latest system software installed, or is caused by a glitch in the release. If you notice lots of crashes after enabling PhysX, turn it off by setting PhysXLevel=0 using the same method above."

If your having trouble in the game with grapple or anything in general. There is a trainer on Gamecopyworld that will let you use the number pad to move on the X Y and Z axis.

Here is the link http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2009&f=Batman_Arkham_Asylum_V1.0_Plus_4_Trainer_By_KelSat!rar

Enjoy ^_^"
