I'd anyway really like to extend my thanks for this one, it was a pleasure through and through.

""....thanks for your uploads.........my bandwidth is limited and I have to pay for every MB of download.......could you please tell me which ones are the good christian movies so I could only download those..............""

In my opinion, all are good. So would request all down-loaders to please put your comments regarding three aspects 
1. Quality
2. Overall movie ratings &
3. Relevance to Christianity.

And please continue seeding. Thanks. May God bless you all."
