POR LO VISTO NO TIENES NADA MAS QUE HACER QUE J0DERTE A TU PUTISIM@ PROGENITORA!!!!!!!

ESTAS NO SON LAS VERSIONES REMASTERIZADAS!!!!!

THIS AREN'T THE REMASTERED SONGS!!!!!!"
,fredfan,2009-09-10T20:38Z,"LOL...why would someone bother to rip--in half-quality lossy compressed version-- 40 year old music available elsewhere in spades, when the only reason for having it is the pristine quality? FLAC it and forget it!

Folks, even if this is from the real thing, you likely already own it in better quality than this."
[V],bubanee,2009-09-12T00:15Z,"or you can go buy the new boxset
flac this and FLAC that!
buddy alot of people don't mind MP3 either
remember before you shoot ya mouth off..
why don't you collect the 41 songs here from different Flac torrents and put the FLACin' thing up!
yourself

PROBLEM SOLVED hehe!"
,ransley13,2009-09-12T20:49Z,"Awesome torrent, downloaded in 6 minutes.
great sound quality! sure if you want the old sounding music then get it but if you want quality then get this! A-10"
,dtstuff9,2009-09-15T03:35Z,The entire discography is considered a greatest hits. Plus this torrent doesn't have In My Life which is one of their best.
[V],bubanee,2009-09-15T03:55Z,@ ^ mate there is plenty missing.. could you imagine everyone picking their favourite 40 beatles songs... what an argument that would create..
,martian_neighbour,2009-09-15T05:09Z,no hard day's night?... WTF?!!
[V],bubanee,2009-09-15T05:39Z,"I have an idea.. how about someone make a part2 to this and up it!
yeah i might just do that myself what a good idea!!!
hehe.. or make a AC3 version of it...
the brain is rattlin' for another bubanee release!
ah well whatever the outcome thanks for the supporters and you cynical bastards too. Oops did i say that.. hehe cheers! "
,pigsikk,2009-09-19T22:27Z,bubanee you the man!!!!!!!!
,tmaun,2009-09-20T23:50Z,"You guys, some developers remastered only 42 songs, I dont think somone can just ""make"" a part 2, i mean im just glad they did any in the first part, remastering a song cant be easy work and probably takes one hell of an ear, just apreciate the beatles in all their awesomeness, great torrent, ill seed for idk ....forever, so get it if you love em, but dont wish for what you cant have when your being given what you dont have yet"
,demiks,2009-09-21T03:30Z,"THANK YOU FOR THIS BRO UR THE BESTTTT..... lol @ why don't you collect the 41 songs here from different Flac torrents and put the FLACin' thing up!

,newbrownshoe,2009-11-03T08:04Z,"Thx for creating in MP3. It works easily on all equipment. Sounds great on all equipment. Don't care if I miss some infinitesimal difference from all those 'large-hard to use on all equipment' alternatives that need converters to use.
Youre the man."

Of course it's not. Beatles made over 150 songs (in their 7 years).
This is only a 'playlist' with some songs.

you can get all songs here : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5097161/The_Beatles_-_discography_%282009_Remastered%29"
