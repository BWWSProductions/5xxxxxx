,LazyTown,2009-10-03T08:08Z,Nitrus fucking seed you ass... all of us are stuck at 81.6%......
,sorcgsdf,2009-10-14T22:33Z,Hm I think that Nitrus0x deserves to die in hell for not seeding...
,nitrus0x,2009-10-29T05:43Z,My apologies for it not finishing seeding. Power supply blew up a while back and fried my mobo/cpu. Finally got the spare $ to replace it. Luckily my hd was ok (so far anyway) so soon as everything's set up and installed again this should be able to finish seeding x.x (upping it to a 100mbit seedbox at the moment just in case)
,Khunter12,2009-10-30T04:19Z,I had it download successfully.
,nitrus0x,2009-10-30T14:07Z,"Should be well seeded now, I'll leave it running on the box for a good bit to make sure. I also uploaded his first album which you can get here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5139556/Ronald_Jenkees_-_Ronald_Jenkees  (seeding on the same box)"
