An extended mix of New Divide by Linkin Park. For those who just wish the original song was longer. It's not a remix, but a natural extension with a few remixed parts. Edited in Adobe Premiere, which is a pain in the butt, but it got the job done.

Contains the original for those who want it as well. And contains multiple versions of the extended mix, so you can pretty much customize which one you end up "keeping".

A good method to find which one you end up picking: Listen to the DZXxXtended mix first. From there, you can decide what you liked or didn't like about it, and can pick a version that gets rid of the aspects you felt were too much. Or keep it if you liked it. Consult the ReadMe for a summary of each version.

Original song length: 4:29
Quality: 320 kbps
Mix lengths: Either 5:18 or 5:50
Mix quality: 224 kbps

Enjoy! Feel free to let me know what you think of this; I worked hard on it and feedback is appreciated. I've done some other mixes before and plan to do more in the future.
