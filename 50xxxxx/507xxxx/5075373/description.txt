A group of inept amateur superheroes must try to save the day when a supervillian threatens to destroy a major superhero and the city.

This is one of those movies with stupid funny quotes that you will always remember like "I don't need a compass to tell me which way the wind shines"

Sorry about the quality its not too amazing 640x360

This is also my first torrent so comments and suggestions are welcomed!

Enjoy!
