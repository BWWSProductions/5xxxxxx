Still no Blueray-rip though and not even a decent rip with subs.

So please re-seed!!

cheers/MK

PS. Thanks for all you-re uploads. Elephant was another great uplad. Keep up the good work!!"

I uploaded this years ago- uncompressed and has english subs. If that torrent is not working I can create a new one-hope that helps."

@ -jonny-

What is the POINT of having BLU-RAY if the thing is compressed???  Answer is NONE, so be kind to jack-the-tab.  Be kind."
