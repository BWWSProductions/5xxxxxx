          Yo Soy La Juani (aka My Name Is Juani) (B. Luna, 2006)-aNaRCHo


               (FILM IS IN SPANISH, ENGLISH SUBTITLES INCLUDED)


Ok, so this isn't a film i'd typically up, but i haven't seen it around. Apparently Spanish Director Bigas Lunas is reknown for "discovering new talent", and seems he's done it again with VerÃ³nica Echegui the main character who plays Juani in this film. She won a bunch of best actress awards in Spain, and is super fucking sexy, so here ya go....


"Juani, a vivacious girl from the Spanish provinces, is sick of her small town life, dead-end job and deadbeat boyfriend. After her best friend is abused by her boyfriend, and Juani finds her boyfriend in bed with another woman, the two the decide to pack their bags and head to Madrid to seek fame, fortune, and most importantly ....fun. But is the big city all they dreamed it would be?.."


PLEASE SEED AND ENJOY!!!
