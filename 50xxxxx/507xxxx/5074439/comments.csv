,MystiQo,2009-09-11T12:19Z,"Ok, so I went through the trouble of change filetype to .rar istead of .avi as ReadMe said. But then what. A password for unrar? So I thought I was just being logic when I typed Entourage. Bittersweet. It started to extract, finished about 20% then WinRAR-error. And even WinRAR was not sure. It says (Wrong password?).. Fucking WinRAR is not even sure!

To hell with this fucked up torrent!"
