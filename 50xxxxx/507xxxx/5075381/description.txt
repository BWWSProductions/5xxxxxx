         CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - AUGUST 2009
        ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This month: new stuff, old stuff, a few remixes and covers, you know how
it is. BUT I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT NEWS! I went to my millionth (approx.)
Kidstreet concert last night and it was the easily the best, most energetic
one I've ever attended. Just before I was about to leave, Edna, the lead
singer, comes up to me and asks me if I'm the guy who makes Cut The Crap
Playlists. Turns out they recognized the design on the shirt I wore to a previous concert as the ex-logo of my website and put two and two together. They also
got an interview with a staff member of an Australian magazine who downloads
CTC Playlists. To that interviewer: THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME SEEM MORE AWESOME
THAN I ACTUALLY AM! And thank you to Kidstreet for being really awesome about
me sharing their music on the internet.

Kidstreet's album will drop next spring, with singles released prior to
that date. Expect tracks to appear on iTunes and be re-recorded in the
near future as well.

Cheers, and I hope everyone enjoyed summer as much as I did. Enjoy this
ridiculously huge playlist (by CTC standards, anyway)!

-Josh

PS: This playlist is best listened to in order, but not all at once. Let
the songs sink in! You have an entire month until the next one, after all.
