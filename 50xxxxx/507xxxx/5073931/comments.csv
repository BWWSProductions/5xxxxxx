I swear... literally.. probably less then 45 sconds, you see the porno type ""behind the ball CAM"" action.... I totally swear... Then your thinking it cannot get any worse... the actor William Defoe.... which is what gives this film creedence.... gets his balls smashed with a huge oiece of OAK fire wood!!!! i do mean his scrotum,, his testeies, his male extrnal glands.... then he lays there passed out from the pain and this wajed out psyco bitch he was fucking moments before the log incident... jerks his limp body and he is still passed oout but has a hard on since less then2 minutes ago they were screwing,, so his dick is hard enought even with smashed nuts... so she jerks him off till he EJACKULATES FUCKING BLOOD..... then you sa to your self... it can't get any worse... ...glad thats over... the the waked out bitch takes a huge drill. A hand crdank type drill with a 3/4"" bit on it and drills a huge ass hole in his legs then bolts a huge granding stone off a huge grinder,,... the kind you see some mideavil executioner use to sharpen an AXE... and bults this huge as weight to to his leg... The takes some hedge shears and cuts off her own clit and pussy lips.... ... Sorrry to be so gross but it actuaally gets worse... in the aspect of abslute shock / bloody-Horrorific/ highly disturbed subject matter, this film takes the cake.. If you though Hostel I or II or any saw film or WOLF creek or house of WAX or the house 10,000 dead, or the hanibal lecture series or steven king movies or anyting you can name.... is gross, horrific, they HAVE NOTHING on this film... ONLY the first alien movie and maybe a couple oothers come close... JAWS for people sacred of water I  have heard tale of bringing people tp sobbig tears.... but Not much else is close... I'd post it but it is on this site... I wish i could tll you where as I got it over a month ago..???sorry... Trust me I didn't even begin to  spoil this flick.... when you see it, you'll see what I mean (OH  THE ETHING by john carpenter is really scary... I saw t when I was like 13 yrs old I guess the age has a factor.... I went home scared shitless.... me and a few buddies snuck in.... did the same for ALIEN... That movie scared my ass so bad.... man I cannot begin to explain... I'm pushing 40 now... so... ANYWAY.... L8R"
