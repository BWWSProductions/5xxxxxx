I have a PAL 360 and have tried the demo on CD and on the HDD. The console just says it couldn't launch the game.
Anyone else have this? Could it be region locking? (though Multi5 would probably mean it's PAL to begin with...)"

,[TR],2009-09-01T14:12Z,"My guess would be it's locked to the console or XBL account it was downloaded with.
My console recognizes it just fine whether on CD or on the HDD, but it ""can't launch"" it.
Kinda strange for a demo, but it could happen."
