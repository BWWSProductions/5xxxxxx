Year: 1971
Label:Fantasy
Ripped from LP
Quality: 320 kbps

Agua Dulce is another record crossed off my long time want list. The Latin title track is highlighted by the work of Coke Escovedo on the timbales, and thereâ€™s a big bass line that opens Descarga before going into another Latin number. The upbeat Gimme Shelter and Morning are the two best songs. The latter has light vocals in the beginning setting the mood for the catchy melody.
