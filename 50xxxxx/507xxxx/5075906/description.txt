This is a rip of the 1997 PC Game: War Planets - Age of Chaos. It was produced by Trendmasters. 

This game is directly based on the old Trendmaster's War Planets toy line. Surprisingly, it isn't all that bad. 

A free demo disc, called "Armageddon at Rock", was given out with the purchase of any War Planet's toy in Toys'R'Us and KB Toys - the demo disc had the entire Planet Rock Campaign on it - one of four or five (I forget) in this full game.

This game has nothing to do with the later War Planets based computer animated TV show.

Media is one CD-ROM Disc: 700MB in .bin/.cue format

PC DOS Game:

Please note that this game is DOS based - probably one of the last major commerical ones -  therefore it probably will not run correctly on any of the Windows NT line ( 2000, XP, Vista, 7). While there is a Windows based setup program, the game itself is totally DOS based.

Unless you have a DOS or Windows 9x machine to play on you will probably want to run this using a virtual machine. 

If you select the full install option when you install the game you will not need to have the disc inserted/mounted when you play the game. 

Enjoy!
