If I ignore the message it seems to work OK, although I did get a hung note once.  I downloaded the other v2.3 torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4363373/PianoTeq_v2.3___Addons___Presets and experienced the same error. I've now installed v2.2 http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4270650/PianoTeq.2.2_Addons_Presets and get no error message. I suspect this has more to do with my set up than the software. This is a great piece of kit. Thanks for the upload."
