Falling in Love Again (1980)

Michelle Pfeiffer
Susannah York
Elliot Gould


Harry (Elliott Gould) and Sue (Susannah York) Lewis met in the 40es as teenagers living in the Bronx. He was an aspiring architect, she was the most beautiful girl (played by Michelle Pfeiffer in her film debut) in school, and both had a fondness for bran muffins. They fell in love, got married, moved to Los Angeles, and had two kids. While struggling with his midlife crisis, Harry receives an invitation for his high school's reunion back so he takes Sue and their teenage kids on a cross-country car trip back to the Big Apple. Will they see in the Bronx what they expected? Will the good memories from their past help rekindle their fading love? Is it too late to dream? Written by Dragomir R. Radev
