multi ALWAYS means MULTIple languages, RF or REG FREE means region free. it has multiple languages, and unless it says so, assume it is not region free. of course you can always download it and run it through ABGX360, and see if it says ""region free!"" if there are only a few torrents, this one for the 360 has got the most seeders, but a LOT of leechers to. gl!"
