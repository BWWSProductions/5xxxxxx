,ThankYouAll,2009-09-03T10:24Z,Does anyone know why the tracker remains at zero regardless of the fact that three people have downloaded this and are seeding? I triple checked this one for spaces before saving my torrent file. I used uTorrent to make it.

Is the male vocal on this Andy LeMaster?

I have Savannah Drive. If I can figure out how to create & upload a torrent, will do so."
