    * "Max" written by Max Richter                                              The album also includes two songs they recorded under the name Amorphous Androgynous.[1][2][3] Despite favourable reviews in the press, the album has been unpopular with fans, who have criticised its tracklist as being lazy, drawing largely from Dead Cities, and with tracks simply fading in and out rather than being properly mixed.[4] However in an interview with "Barcodezine" (who found it favourable) Cobain states:
â€œ 	...well in our mind we tried to make it a nice balance of light and dark, feminine/masculine â€“ all these qualities. Thereâ€™s quite a few different sides to FSOL, there is the very, very abstract, what we term the more male, machine music. We tried to not go too extreme into that but keep it melodic, experimental, involving, yes the hits, but in maybe edited or slightly remixed form â€“ thereâ€™s an edit of the Liz Fraser (Cocteau Twins) single on there. But actually, from our point of view, what we consider to be the most long-standing tracks, and try to get the balance right, which I think weâ€™ve done quite well.
