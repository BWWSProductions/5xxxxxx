Release Title: The End - Confessions Of A Cockney Gangster [2009](A UKB-KvCD By BINGOWINGZ)

Release Date: 8 June 2009
RunTime: 1 Hour 17 Minutes
Genre: Gangster

Plot: Against the backdrop of the East End of London, first time filmmaker Nicola Collins (Snatch) explores the fascinating complexity of the lives of her father and his friends; infamous criminals that shaped their war torn environment into a violent underworld.

The End is a story never before been told of a group of men with a common bond. All born in the East End of London into poverty, striving for a better life and all found that life in crime. Unashamed and unapologetic, these men live their lives defined by a code of terror.

Old school gangsters who followed the code and still had respect for others and made sure you respected them. I have known some scary people in my time but what is brilliant about this it it captures the person within the criminals. I rate it as one of best documentaries I have seen the ending is superb in how it shows multi cultural Britain and the loss of British identity.



Enjoy and Seed!
