,DjAndy_P,2009-12-13T20:27Z,"Before I even got around to open the archive, avast anti-virus beat me to it, and detected the whole thing as virus.
I'm not saying it is a real virus all though, cause I know some programs might be detected as virus whilst they're really not, espacially with avast.
It's a shame though... Now I'm gonna have to find an alternative download....
Thx though for taking the time and effort of uploaing!"

,cclloyd,2010-05-04T23:07Z,Licence key invalid.
,chuy1306,2010-05-19T05:42Z,"dont download
installation is custom made
shady ""scan"" button on installator is just a jpeg that opens up in windows gallery
serial key works..
BUT 3 min after i installed a warning came up and said that this is a cracked version and you should buy...
options were buy now-buy later
could be that its accessed through the internet,
after installation it asked if i wanted to update so it is communicating with the web
i uninstalled and will restart my pc a couple of times to make sure that shits ok...
will post again"
