,Dakenz,2009-09-03T02:34Z,"O.K., and so your still a misleading person who attempts to falsify his product, my but you should get into advertising, no wait, you'd be sued, better yet become a politician. You can say whatever you want, your ""fine print"" defense is BS, you know most peeps won't bother to read all the details, or even click on anything other then the download arrow. Don't lie and say you are just different, your a budding, future, ruthless capitalist suckling at the teat of your idol satan...and that's cool man, cause that's you ;)"
,jamsa,2009-09-03T19:45Z,why would anyone be interested in what year you ripped it?? Just post the release date retard!
,mrsillyx11,2009-09-03T20:49Z,"And they give this guy a 'trusted"" rating ?  If you put rip date you may as well use your birthday or something else totally useless. 
Rip date can go in the info file, not the title of the movie. The reason you put the year the movie was released to aid in searching. Helpful when there more then 1 movies in the series.

,aju186,2009-12-28T01:05Z,I got your point. I think it would be better to write: Resident Evil ApocalypseDvDrip[2009]-LW-[Bit-Byte].. just sayin' :).  Thanks for the upload.
,neodubbz,2010-01-27T23:25Z,"you fucking jew hypoctrites..cant u just say thanx for the free stuff instead of arguying and opening your fucking assholes with stupid comments?! it says FUCKAPOCALYPSE u fags.


and thanx for the Up dude,dont listen to them."
,noona72,2010-02-02T04:30Z,"WOW! Some people are pretty picky over the details of wonderful, free downloads that you took your time on.  I didn't even notice the 2009.  I was looking for Resident Evil - Apocalypse that would download fast and XoLWoX delivered.

Thanks for the download!!"
,stamina72,2010-03-31T17:53Z,Who gives a f**k about the year? Morons. Thanks for uploading!
,xxbassplayerxx,2010-04-10T00:31Z,"I don't agree with the misleading title (though it didn't throw me off because I was looking for this specific movie), but I do thank you for the rip.

Great quality and a quick download."
