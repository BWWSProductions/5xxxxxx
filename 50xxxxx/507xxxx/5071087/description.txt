Introduction 

A failed coup attemptâ€¦a British mercenary in a notorious African prisonâ€¦a dictator suspicious of Western powersâ€¦and beneath it all, a spectacular underwater oil reserve that the worldâ€™s major powers would love to get their hands on.

It may sound like the latest John LeCarrÃ© bestseller, but in fact itâ€™s the real-life intrigue of Once Upon a Coup, WIDE ANGLEâ€™s penetrating look at the mysterious goings-on in Equatorial Guinea, a tiny West African nation newly rich with oil and infamous for corruption. The story begins in 2004, when a group of mercenaries, including a British ex-special forces officer named Simon Mann, is arrested in Zimbabwe. Equatorial Guineaâ€™s president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, accuses them of plotting a coup against him. When Mann is sentenced to 34 years in Equatorial Guineaâ€™s notorious Black Beach prison, he claims to be only one piece of an international plot to control the countryâ€™s vast oil resources. Once Upon a Coup travels the globe to unravel that plot, which stretches from Africa to the U.K., from a prime ministerâ€™s son to Zimbabwean arms dealers, from South Africa to Spain.

But as this all plays out, another actor is bidding for a share of the oil: China. The Chinese government has showered the country with glittering new buildings and a new administrative capital. If President Obiang has grown skeptical of Western intentions, he has welcomed China as a new business partner. Starting with a small West African nation and stretching around the globe, Once Upon a Coup sheds light on the uncomfortable realities of oil politics in the 21st century.
