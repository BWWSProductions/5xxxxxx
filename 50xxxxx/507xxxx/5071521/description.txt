Alchemy Mindworks Animation Workshop v2.0a25

Description

Build professional banners, advertisements and other commercial animations in minutes, with an impressively short learning curve. Animation Workshop handles the elements of its animations as objects, eliminating the need to understand how animation files are structured.

Animation Workshop will assemble your animations from still images, text and other animations. It brings an inexhaustible library of graphic effects to the table. It maintains its text as editable text objects, rather than graphics â€” the text content of your animations will be editable after they're created.

Export Animation Workshop's animations to GIF, MNG, AVI, MOV and SWF (Macromedia Flashâ„¢).

Whether you need really quick web page banner advertisements, eye-catching graphics for a PowerPointâ„¢ presentation, video titles that are hard to ignore or animations for Presentation Wizard or Screen Saver Construction Set documents, Animation Workshop will make it happen in minutes, and make it look like you have a complete graphic design house on speed-dial.
