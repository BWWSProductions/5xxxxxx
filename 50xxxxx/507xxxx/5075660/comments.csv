Kaspersky 2010 Fix:

1. Download Kaspersky Trial version from http://esd.element5.com/demoreg.html?productid=300324330.
Install it.
Get all the updates.

2. Go to Kaspersky's settings, click Options, and untick Enable Self-Defence.

3. Exit Kaspersky by right-clicking its icon in the Tray, and choose EXIT at the bottom.

4. Go to Start, run, then type regedit and press enter.

5. Press CTRL+F to serach for    ProductStatus    and hit enter, or go directly to:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\KasperskyLab\protected\AVP9\environment
where      ProductStatus    is located in the right window.

6. Double click     ProductStatus    and change the word:
 Release
(it may say Trial instead of Release)

to:
 Beta


7. Press OK. Close Registry Editor, start Kaspersky.

Kaspersky will complain your key is invalid.  Click the red message.
Now License Manager is open.  Click ""Activate New Licens"".


8. Tick Activate beta license then press Next and Finish, it will now contact the Server to activate the Beta-key.

9. Re-enable Self-Defence if it hasn't already done that by itself.		

10. This can be done over and over again when the 30-days Trial ends."
