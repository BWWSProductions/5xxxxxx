Inspired by the Spinervals series and bored with the same old routines and boring classroom
workouts, BtBoP Productions
created a wonderful first person virtual reality cycling training program 
http://www.CyclingVideosOnline.com has several of these first person perspective virtual training videos
that range in discipline from race pace to recovery. Each video targets a specific discipline
designed to keep you entertained while working to your potential.

Visit http://www.CyclingVideosOnline.com to watch videos on how to use these training programs. Also
available for download are the gps and google
files for each ride. Video previews are available
for each ride.

Enjoy and share!
