,roxo13,2009-11-06T23:39Z,"Hey guys.. it's a very nice game. If only I could play it. It seems I have the problem some of you have. The game wants me to contact customer service because it couldn't find out if it is a legal copy or not. I might add that I have disabled the windows firewall and I even unplugged my internet cable. 
If I have to turn off the antivirus firewall, how do I do this from Norton?

Thanks, please reply soon."

,theesammalamma,2009-11-09T19:42Z,"The reason it says that no disc is inserted is because you need to either write the .iso file to a DVD or you need to virtually mount the .iso using Daemon Tools Lite or similar.

,nakreb,2009-11-24T22:00Z,"@Zalona
When you mount the ISO.
Go to your keyboard and press; Start + E
Windows Explorer. And when you mounted it. It will be a virtual drive. And then you will see the Crack folder. Sorry if you couldnt understand."
,Zalona,2009-11-25T01:29Z,"I mounted it with deamontools before, I mean, I installed the game and seen the intro of the game, it's loading but then it's sayning it's unable to verify..

,Blackbyrd,2010-01-27T20:33Z,"People you need to copy the both the TSL and the TS3 files to the Game Bin file, or else you will get the verify message every time. Copy and replace the original files, then when your done hit sort by name, the game will get confused if you don't have all the folder and files in the original order.  If you want to update the game then manually change ( do not try and use a patch) the version. Go to your game folder (where you put your crack) the game folder will be found under program files (x86 if you have windows seven or vista) and change the version in both default.ini (with the little cog wheel) and skuversion.txt  if you have vista or windows 7 you'll have put move these files to your desktop in order to save the changes.
