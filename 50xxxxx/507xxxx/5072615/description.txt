L'armata Brancaleone (1966)


L'armata Brancaleone (known in English-speaking countries as For Love and Gold or The Incredible Army of Brancaleone) is an Italian comedy movie released in 1966, written by the famous duo Age & Scarpelli and directed by Mario Monicelli. It features Vittorio Gassman in the main role. It was entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival.

The term Armata Brancaleone is still used today in Italian to define a group of people which are badly assembled. Brancaleone is a historical name, meaning the paw of lions in heraldry jargon. Brancaleone degli AndalÃ² was an effective governor of the Middle Ages Rome.

A group of rogues steal a scroll granting its bearer the property of the land of Aurocastro in Apulia (south of Italy). They elect a shaggy knight, Brancaleone from Norcia, as their leader, and decide to get possession of this supposedly wealthy land. Many adventures will occurr during the journey.
