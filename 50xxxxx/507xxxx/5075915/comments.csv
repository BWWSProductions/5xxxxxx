Oh god....... this movie is so cheesy! The acting is mediocre, the story is just nutty, and for some reason, I know it's a bad movie but I don't hate it, and I actually had a good laugh or two. The ending is really good when the true identity of the narrator is revealed.

So, in conclusion, it's a bad movie, but it's good."
