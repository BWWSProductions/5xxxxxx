[T],sig_garrett,2009-09-01T07:56Z,"booboo332 - thanks for the input and worthy of consideration. May depend on your audience. I say most definately if that works best for your strategy. One of many great mentors, the late Dr. Hans Leder, in his final days instructed the phrase with a spirit of revolution as well as homage to the 60's. 

Was also thinking of begining with ""free beer""  ;-)

Let me know when you get something posted. I'm excited to see how it will read."

As for ""ORGANIZE EDUCATE RESIST"", I can see that if taken as synergistic factors with each relying on the presence of the others, the motto has merit but all too often people tend to leave one (or more!!) out.  

A good example of this is how most of the ""conscientious objectors"" during the Vietnam war were well organized and resistant but very few had well informed and thought out foundations to their actions.  Many were just caught up in the spirit of the movement and I think this is something no movement is immune to and is even used intentionally in some cases.   (""Yes we can"", anyone?  yeah, yeah I know - preaching to the choir on that one)

Another is the lovable Libertarians who are often very well read and thoroughly dedicated to resistance but are hopelessly disorganized.  The metaphor of herding cats is overused but still very applicable.

My goals are mainly to provoke thought and to encourage people to not take themselves too seriously which usually is at the expense of the truth and effectiveness.  I guess that is why I focused on education but I freely admit that without the other two, it is as insubstantial as a fart in a hurricane. 

I am just beginning to look into Alex Jones stuff, though I have seen ""The Obama Deception.""  Thanks for making it available on the Bay."
[T],sig_garrett,2009-09-02T09:25Z,"booboo332 - enjoyed your post. All points well taken. 

I have found that Alex Jones & company have the best track record for socio-political-economic analysis, hence my effort to make available (mostly) commercial free while promoting him and his business. Quick homage: I picked up the torch from former AJS torrent guru Chakra71 who still checks in from time to time.

Welcome to the infowar. I hope you continue to enjoy and enlighten."
