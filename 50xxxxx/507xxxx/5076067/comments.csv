It stops asking for activation but it doesn´t upgrade to full version.
Content pack´s doesn´t install, ceeps saying:
""No supported software for MAGIX Content pack # found"""
,jaxtastic,2009-09-19T21:22Z,Same thing happening to me as user Grande66... it stopped asking me for installation but it won't give me any new soundpools and won't install the content packages... I did manage to get the chillout and techno/trance soundpools though.

,DRvicktor,2009-11-13T14:34Z,"SORRY FOR PREVIOUS POST but this was the matter: WINDOWS 7. If Your OPSYS is win 7 then you have to: follow the unzip instructions BUT : A) Run installation in compatibility Vista service pack2, SHUT DOWN the program after installation, thencrack it. At first run follow again compatibility with VISTA servie pack 2. After thet's all is fine. "

,WeLoveMusic,2009-11-20T02:48Z,Can anyone tell me how to install content pack because ever time i install it installs as temporary and file and after installation the file is gone.

,applepieisawesome,2009-12-02T00:49Z,"Um sorry I am a newbie, I don't know what you mean by 'crack', is this a file that is supposed to be included in the download, or is it something that is generated by a programme i should have?  is its the former, then i can't find it in my download :( but if its the latter, then what do i do to get this?  Thank you :)"
,applepieisawesome,2009-12-02T02:04Z,"i'm sorry, i worked out the whole crack shizzle by downloading one, but i'm stuck on the activation bit.  i can't just enter anything i want, it keeps rejecting me from it.  is there a number i can use that anyone knows of, please?"
,blank_stairs,2009-12-04T01:49Z,"If you cant figure out how to use this file...U R A Retard...Its clean and works great. thanks alot Shiela. Because of people like you, i get to try full versions of things before i purchase them.Instead of thos crappy trials that let you see 1% of the program. Thanks again."
,blank_stairs,2009-12-04T01:51Z,You dont even need a serial. DISCONNECT from the net. And just hit activate.(leave it blank) try following directions.

,thojen,2010-02-17T16:44Z,"I use Windows7 and after following the instructions I get a message about ""use another operative system"" or something similar to that when I activate and go to update to full version. What do I do about that? What was the comment about Vista service pack 2 compatibility about? What do I need to do to get it right? Thanks for a great upload and great instructions."

,ricande,2010-04-25T14:05Z,"Ok. Here is my problem with this:

After install and cracked, and activated... No sounds are working. I do a soundpool cleanup, and all instruments are gone. 

I install the contentpacks without any problems, but no sounds are showing up int music maker... Tried it 3 times now..."
,ricande,2010-04-25T14:13Z,Ok. I might have found the problem with Firebird sql-server... Needs to uninstall it..
,ricande,2010-04-25T14:35Z,Nope.. Did not solve anything... It's useless.
,LH-TAIMI,2010-06-28T16:09Z,"i had this verision earlier, but went to 16, when i got the 16 i couldnt install the soundpacks, btw dont use the soundpacks from this torrent, use another ^^"
,Flukerence,2010-07-31T05:13Z,"Great torrent, thanks

If anyones having issues activating this on windows 7, before you enter the activation code you need to right click the icon on your desktop and troubleshoot compatibility then select troubleshoot programme. select the programme worked on an earlier operating system but wont install or run now. then select windows xp sp3, start the programme then close it, then select, yes save these settings to this programme. when its finished checking again it will say incompatible application but ignore that and close the window. open the programme, enter an activation code and voila, it upgrades fully. i hope this helps."
