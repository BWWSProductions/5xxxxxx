,kingoftheplanet,2009-09-03T01:21Z,Just got a VIRUS - DONT' DOWNLOAD.
,Syddistic,2009-09-25T20:44Z,"I highly doubt that, as I scanned it after I got it, and  it was clean, and I didn't add any extra files to it. So theres four things that could of happened.
A. Your stupid and got a virus from something else
B. It was a false positive
C. Somehow there is a virus, and my anti virus systems didn't detect it, and nobody elses anti virus systems detected it.

Or my personal favorite, and the most likely occurrence

D. Your a troll and you can get the fuck off my torrent and stop spreading lies. "

,cjm5,2010-09-18T04:35Z,"i created a username just so i could comment this even though ive been torrenting off TPB for years.

Thank you for seeding and leaching this! Im a new producer and i have paid for some of prime loops stuff, but its very expensive for a college student. A pack like this is a nice addition for me! I appreciate the seeders and the original poster. 

I dont know if i would agree about posting all of their packs, like their DnB combo packs, but these extra ones i dont think matter much. That being said, i have three of the DnB packs that i would be looking to trade if anyone has the electro house ones."
,Bonds007,2010-10-26T19:23Z,Can i use some of these loops in my studeo?
