A mix/mash-up between two different songs. "Sky is Over" by Serj Tankian, and "Ð¯ Ñ‚Ð²Ð¾Ñ Ð½Ðµ Ð¿ÐµÑ€Ð²Ð°Ñ (Ya Tvoya Ne Pervaya)" or "I'm Not Your First" by t.A.T.u. of Russia. It was more commonly known among English-speakers as the Russian version of "Show Me Love".

I sped up "Ya Tvoya" by about 5% but left the pitch the same, as it was already in the same key. Created in Adobe Premiere Pro (It was a pain in the butt to work with!)

It's pretty dramatic, kind of a dark but high-energy piece. Hope you enjoy it. Feel free to drop by the forum at http://www.dzxproductions.com for Anime Music Videos, other music mixes, or just to have fun and hang out. I'd love to hear if you enjoyed this mix. :3
