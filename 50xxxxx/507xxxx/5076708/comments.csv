,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-09-09T10:08Z,"This torrent is for real, just be patient - I've had serious grief with my internet, but it's all back up now, with ports open, so fill your boots chaps!"
,teladoy,2009-09-11T12:38Z,"I am sorry I forget to write a guide but it does work
1) take it to windows and decompress (winnrar)
2) bring back to mac and one folder will be still compress  i believe (33) decompress 
3) install.
Thank you TGDr-aka-RG you are not a republican. "
,giwdul,2009-09-12T11:14Z,"You donÂ´t need Win for Rar-Files. Use UnRarX on a Mac or use StuffitExpander should do it too.

If you have to join files, use Split&Concat.

Other question: is this QXP Passport? "
,TGDr-aka-RG,2009-09-12T17:35Z,"@giwdul

This is QuarkXPress 8.1 (Full version) which is Snow Leopard compatible. More info:

,teladoy,2009-10-20T12:04Z,"@giwdul
stuffit did not work in my hackintosh with this file 
that is why I have the courtesy to write this instruction I am glad you don't need it.
Anyway I have allready have problems with the serial maybe you can fix that too giwdul."
,brovius,2009-10-21T11:38Z,"On 10.6.1 on an early-2009 low-end 24"" iMac the NoPE doesn't work. Extracted it, replaced the original one, and Quark doesn't start. Yes I am sure I did everything alright."
,brovius,2009-10-21T12:54Z,"Ok, I figured out by myself that OS X recognized as a Document, because it has been edited (HFS+ knows that). Simple solution: copy the zip in the NoPE folder to a FAT/FAT32 partition. Then extract, and copy it into the app. I did that, and now it runs, but it's asking for an activation. Hmm. "
,Jeepster1,2010-06-14T23:56Z,"All unzipped and installed BUT does not work even after following instructions and overwriting the appropriate file from the one that's included within the crack folder (within the NoPE folder). 

Shame! Just hope a working crack is released soon."
,fynnlei,2010-09-06T04:52Z,where can i find a crack for this? the 'trial time' has expired...
,goldtooth1,2010-09-22T23:40Z,dont know if it works yet but 500+ kbs download average
