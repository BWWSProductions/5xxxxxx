From Wiki:



Loreena Isabel Irene McKennitt, CM, OM, (born February 17, 1957) is a Canadian singer, composer, harpist and pianist most famous for writing, recording and performing world music with Celtic and Middle Eastern themes. McKennitt is known for her refined, warbling soprano vocals.


McKennitt was born in Morden, Manitoba of Irish and Scottish descent to parents Jack and Irene McKennitt (a livestock dealer and a nurse). She moved to Stratford, Ontario in 1981, where she lives.

When Loreena was young she wanted to become a veterinarian but she found that music chose her rather than she it.[3] Developing a passion for Celtic music, she learned to play the Celtic harp and began busking at various places, one well known place being St. Lawrence Market in Toronto in order to earn money needed for publishing her first album.

Her first album, Elemental, was released in 1985, followed by To Drive the Cold Winter Away (1987), Parallel Dreams (1989), The Visit (1991), The Mask and Mirror (1994), A Winter Garden (1995), The Book of Secrets (1997), An Ancient Muse (2006) and A Midwinter Nightâ€™s Dream (2008). All of her work is released under her own label, Quinlan Road.

In 1993, her music became known to a wider audience when she toured Europe supporting Mike Oldfield. In 1995, her version of the traditional Irish song "Bonny Portmore" was prominently featured in the film Highlander 3, causing a large increase of album sales among fans of the films. McKennitt's single "The Mummers' Dance" was a widespread success, receiving considerable airplay in North American markets during the spring of 1997, and was used as the theme song for the short-lived TV series, Legacy.

Her music appeared in the movies The Santa Clause, Soldier, Jade, Holy Man, The Mists of Avalon, Tinkerbell, and in the television series Roar and Due South.

In 1998, McKennitt's fiancÃ©, Ronald Rees; his brother Richard; and their close friend Gregory Cook, drowned during a boating incident on Georgian Bay. She was deeply affected by the event and subsequently founded the Cook-Rees Memorial Fund for Water Search and Safety in the same year.

At the time of the incident, she was working on an album of two live performances called Live in Paris and Toronto. The proceeds from the sales of that album were donated to the newly created fund, totaling some three million dollars. [5] After the release of the live album, McKennitt decided to substantially reduce the number of public performances and did not release any new recordings until the studio album An Ancient Muse in 2006.

McKennitt's music has generally been classified as World / Celtic music even though it contains aspects and characteristics of music from around the globe and is sometimes classified as Folk music in record stores.

Before McKennitt composes any music, she engages in considerable research on a specific subject which then forms the general concept of the album. Before creating Elemental and Parallel Dreams, she traveled to Ireland for inspiration from the country's history, folklore, geography and culture. The album The Mask and Mirror was preceded by research in Spain where she engaged in studying Galicia, a Celtic section of Spain, along with its abundant Arabic roots. The result was an album including elements of Celtic and Arabic music. According to the notes of her latest album, An Ancient Muse was inspired primarily by travels among and reading about the various cultures along the Silk Road.

McKennitt is compared to Enya, but McKennitt's music is more grounded in traditional and classical invocations, using literary works as sources of lyrics and springboards for interpretation such as "The Lady of Shalott" by Lord Tennyson, "Prospero's Speech" (the final soliloquy in William Shakespeare's The Tempest), "Snow" by Archibald Lampman, "Dark Night of the Soul" by St. John of the Cross, William Blake's "Lullaby", Yeats' "The Stolen Child", and "The Highwayman" by Alfred Noyes.

In 2005, McKennitt was involved in an acrimonious court case in England when her former friend and employee, Niema Ash, published a book which contained intimate details of their friendship. McKennitt argued that much of the book contained confidential personal information, which Ash had no right to publish. The English courts found that there had indeed been a breach of confidence and a misuse of McKennitt's private information, and the case is likely to set important precedents in English law on the privacy of celebrities.[6] The House of Lords affirmed the lower court's decisions in 2007.


In September 2006, McKennitt performed live at the Alhambra. The performance premiered on PBS and in August 2007 was released on a three-disc DVD/CD set entitled Nights from the Alhambra.

In 2008, McKennitt composed the song entitled To The Fairies They Draw Near as the theme song for Disney's direct to video animated film Tinker Bell. The film makers were so impressed with her, that they asked her to do the narration for the film.[8]

In the Spring of that same year, she returned to Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios to record A Midwinter Nightâ€™s Dream, an extended version of A Winter Garden (1995). The album was released on October 28.[9]

Since the release of An Ancient Muse Loreena has toured consistently, with a European and North American tour in the Spring of 2007, an extensive cross Canada and United States tour in the fall of 2007, a summer tour of Europe in 2008 and a Mediterranean tour in the summer of 2009, with stops in Greece (concerts were postponed, but finally held in late June)[10], Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Hungary and Italy.

The Mask and Mirror 1994 (remastered 2004)


The Mask and Mirror is an album by Loreena McKennitt released in 1994.


Like most of Loreena McKennitt's albums, The Mask and Mirror is heavily influenced by her travels. Her experiences in Spain and Morocco specifically, serve as the inspiration for this album.

"I looked back and forth through the window of 15th century Spain, through the hues of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, and was drawn into a fascinating world: history, religion, cross-cultural fertilization... For some medieval minds the mirror "was the door through which the soul frees itself by passing"... for others the pursuit of personal refinement was likened to "polishing the mirror of the soul." From the more familiar turf of the west coast of Ireland, through the troubadours of France, crossing over the Pyrenees and then to the west through Galicia, down through Andalusia and past Gibraltar to Morocco... The Crusades, the pilgrimage to Santiago, Cathars, the Knights Templar, the Sufis from Egypt, One Thousand and One Nights in Arabia, the Celtic imagery of trees, the Gnostic Gospels... who was God? and what is religion, what spirituality? What was revealed and what was concealed... and what was the mask and what the mirror?" -- Loreena McKennitt, Introduction to The Mask and Mirror

Live in San Francisco at the Palace of Fine Arts  1994  Promotional Copy


Live in San Francisco at the Palace of Fine Arts is an EP of the Canadian singer, songwriter, accordionist, harpist, and pianist, Loreena McKennitt. It was recorded live in San Francisco during a concert at the Palace of Fine Arts, on the 19th of May 1994 and released 1 year later.


Loreena McKennitt
Live in San Francisco at The Palace of Fine Arts
PRO-CD-7255 Warner Bros.


Promo-only CD that was sold exclusively through Loreena's website (www.quinlanroad.com). There are two versions of this disc, both for sale only through her website. There was a first version with full artwork but only 6 tracks, and then there's this one that was made only for radio stations and other promotional stuff. This is a more complete version of the same concert with 10 tracks. I think that these extra tracks appeared scattered as b-sides in some of her cd-singles, and at some point I thought of making a compilation of all of them myself, until I learned about this promo cd and wrote to Ms McKennitt for my copy.


I've included both the artwork of the shorter version (it's so beautiful that I'm sure you'll love to have it) and then the artwork (only back cover) that came with the promo.
