Mouse Guard is an Eisner Award-winning bi-monthly comic book series published by Archaia Studios Press. The comic is noted to stand out on the shelves due to its odd size - a square (8" Ã— 8") as opposed to the standard comic size (6Â½" Ã— 10"). Mouse Guard is written and illustrated by David Petersen.

The story focuses on a colony of intelligent mice, who live in a medieval era, paralleling the same age in human history, though in their world there are no humans.

Series one is collected in a single volume entitled Mouse Guard: Fall 1152.  Mouse Guard Series two started in July 2007 and was entitled Winter 1152 and ran for six issues.  David Petersen has also stated plans for further Mouse Guard stories.
