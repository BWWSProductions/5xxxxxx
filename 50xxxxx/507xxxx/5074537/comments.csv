Great work though, eXP. Cred."
[T],eXPer1ence,2009-08-31T13:31Z,Paint has its uses. Screenshots for example.
,maru_tips,2009-08-31T14:03Z,Paint  are Old but  it is  very usefull....also the calculator it never dies.....thats the  only program that i will  never let  go......very very  handy... fast and  handy...

my opinion is  there  is a  missing FONTS in tiny7. coz when i used it  in  my microXP chat txt are visible. i do have 2 OS by the way...

any idea where to get  those missing  FONTS and where to  put  it or what causes my RANonline chat txt not visible

,vibe666,2009-09-02T00:14Z,"thanks for the hard work yet again, it's appreciated.  not that you'd know it from all the bitching and moaning.

if you don't like something in  eXPeriences releases then either don't use them or figure out how to fix them yourself.  most of what everyone has asked here so far takes 5 minutes of googling to fix.

there are thousands of different software combinations that eXPerience could have put in this build if he'd wanted to and I bet not a single one would have been good enough for everyone.

don't like paint?  then don't use it and find and install something else.

missing font for some obscure game?  google it and find out where to get it and how to install it yourself.

don't like any of it?  then wait for MS to release the unmodified software and buy it from them instead of getting it here for free before it's even out in the shops and then you can call them and bitch about it.

or you could just show a bit of gratitude for all the hard work and hours of time that has gone into putting this together and say ""thanks"".

Thanks. :o)"

So I ask again, someone who might know: Is the activation by hazar updated in Rev01, or/and is it still reliable and good?"
,ntoskrnl,2009-09-02T16:33Z,"The activation used on this is exactly the same as on the original one, and it's still reliably working."

Sadly, gadgets and sidebar do not work in this edition. With some luck it might simply be cuz of turned off processes conflicting it? Otherwise a truly great build."
,vibe666,2009-09-04T01:02Z,"google (or pretty much any other search engine) is as reliable and effective as the person using it.

,oralmud,2009-09-04T20:13Z,"per details in rev01 the sidebar package was removed, but why is the sidebar folder and its contents in program files was left intact? Also, the Run entry in hkcu is still there aside from the rightclick desktop menu item [and start menu, damned things are quite misleading, shouldve been removed].

tried running th exe file to no effect.

So can one can delete the the sidebar program folder without affecting anything else in the system?

Reportedly, this can be fixed by creating the following entry under ?Settings? in the registry-entry that isn't there :) 
-> New -> DWORD (32-bit) value -> Name it ?AllowElevatedProcess? -> Set it to 1

So, I guess we just need the complete reg-entry

If you've got 4GBs or more you'll just have to make the jump to x64, which is actually not too bad nowadays.

,ptiger,2009-11-01T17:25Z,"Great torrent eXPer1ence - a nice, fast OS with all of the unnecessary crap which comes with windows 7 removed.  I've been having some problems with it though:

My biggest problem is that it appears Tiny7 REV01 failed to activate on my Lenovo 3000 Series N500. On first boot, the activation window came up, and it seemed to work (it didn't return any errors). Later, under Start>Computer>Properties, the ""Windows Activation"" area says ""30 days to activate. Activate Windows now"". However a product key is there - ""00456-OEM-8992662-00497"". When trying to insert ANY correctly-formateed product key, I get ""A problem ocurred when Windows tried to activate. Error Code 0xC004E003"". The only way I found to fix the activation problem with Hazar's RemoveWAT.

On a clean imnstall of Tiny7 REV01, Windows Update worked fine. After installing a few simple applications, it is no longer working. When preparing to download 3 updates for example, the loading text says ""Downloading 3 Updates (0 KB total, 0% complete)"". The loading then stops, and gives an unknown error (code 800F081F). For this reason I can no longer download any updates.

When you open the start menu, type something in and press the return key, you get a window saying:
""search:query=something
Class not registered""
You get a similar message when using Win+F, as mentioned by Kreon22.

If you set a password for the Administrator account which Tiny7 comes with, on boot a message saying ""The user name or password was incorrect."" is displayed without entering anything into the password field.

There's no glow on the Min/Max/Close buttons on mouse-over.

Some of the above issues are pretty serious, and I'd be grateful if you had a look at them, eXPer1ence. I had none of these problems with the build 7127 original ISO.

Loviiisa's way (Vistalizator) indeed works, but you need to make sure you have a language pack for Win7 Build 7600.
And you HAVE to install it via express mode, or it will fail! You have to change the mode by clicking on the mode before installing.. it took a while for me to find out..

,Naraku77,2010-02-11T08:58Z,"Works well on the PCs I've used it with.  Unfortunately, that's not many, because most of the ones I've installed 7 on had a 64-bit CPU, and it really is hard to justify putting the 32-bit version on a 64-bit machine now.  Not only have most of the compatibility issues in WOW64 been smoothed out, there's also the ""XP Mode"" that has been made available in 7.  Add to that the fact that many of these people will probably be wanting to upgrade their RAM to 8 GB (or more) in the near future, and I'd be having to install the x64 version then anyway.  So for the most part I've been using the bloated retail x64 disc.  This would have been so much more useful if it had been x64.  I've supported your choice to stick with x86 in the past, because x64's time had not yet come.  But now, clearly the tide has turned.  I can't even use your releases as the primary OSes on any of my machines anymore (all of them that were old enough to have less than 4 GB of RAM have been wiped out by the capacitor plague).

I know you don't seem to like x64 versions (you've only ever released one disc with x64 versions of XP and 2003, a great DVD I might add).  Look at the stats though, the 64-bit version of 7 is outselling the 32-bit version 2 to 1, according to a report from Steam (and 7 has already surpassed Vista's adoption levels in this short amount of time since it's release).  Maybe it's time to reconsider your decision?

Also, I think it would be an interesting thing if you could look into Server 2008 R2, especially the Core installs.  I'd love to see something like ""TinyCore Gamers Edition"" released eventually.  There's no Explorer to waste resources, so that leaves more for the games ;)  Seems to me the only tricky part would be adding DirectX and full .NET support (though it does have some .NET functionality and that may be enough to run most apps that need it).  For the lazy wankers who won't spend the 15 minutes it would take to learn basic DOS commands, you could have Total Commander run at startup, (or include a batch file that runs it when you type ""tc"" at the prompt, that should be easy enough).  Actually, I'm thinking TC UP would be perfect for a Core mod, because it not only includes many useful apps, it includes menu entries for running them.  You could probably even customize it further and add/remove apps to your liking (every app included is portable)."

,Naraku77,2010-02-27T13:31Z,"bogas04, if you had looked closer at the question, you might have realized the poster asked how to install this TO a USB stick, not FROM a USB stick.  There's a difference.  Installing from a USB stick is just going to make the installation go faster.  Installing to a USB stick creates a portable desktop the user can take anywhere.

I'm surprised no additional drivers were included as well.  Stick drives always showed up in Tiny XP (I formatted one by accident that way, lol).  I've had a similar problem.  A friend's machine wasn't able to install this because they apparently have an older SATA controller that 7 does not support by default.  Maybe MS decided it was too outdated.  Maybe there's a firmware update it needs.  For now, that thing's using 2003 (experience's latest release of it, actually, from that DVD that has x64 versions, though the machine itself is x86 so I wasn't able to use those).

I wasn't playing when I said I need an x64 version either.  I deal with the kind of people who buy whatever hype they see on TV and ""just have to have"" 7 when they don't really have the resources it needs.

Case in point, I had this guy's machine that only has 512 MB of RAM (the e-machines trademark -- pathetically low RAM) running just fine with Superior XP x64, even with Windowblinds going.  But no, he can't just be happy that it works (and looks every bit as good as 7, if not better).  So now he's running 7 Ult. x64, and it's sluggish, and he's wondering why.  Not that I plan to use any version of Windows on his system ever again now.  He had my friend (grudgingly) remove all virus protection from his system because he found it annoying (after essentially using torture tactics by complaining over and over until he gave in).  Since I don't want to format his PC once a week or more because he refuses to run an AV, he can take my offer to install Kubuntu + LXDE or take it to Best Buy (which I know he's way too cheap to actually do)."

2.) try installing... u will get a error message... keep the error message on the screen - dont close it down.
3.) go into control panel, and ""Programs and Features"" category... now click ""Turn windows features on or off""... now ACTIVATE/TICK both boxes that reffers to Framework 3.5.1 and click ok
4.) after install, try rebooting and try installing google chrome to see if you were succesful.
5.) if not... try to install dotnetfx35 again... and restart again... if it still dont work try doing these stuff simultaneously with ""Turn windows features on or off"" and the box inside framework 3.5.1 and installing framework 3.5

For those interested, you can find it here. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6203191"

great news! I followed your steps and I managed to get Paint.NET running.
So.. That sounds like a success.
But still I get strange errors, like:
- Security Update for .NET Framework 3.5.1 on Windows 7 x86 (KB983590) won't install.
- can't install Windows Explorer 9.
- In Windows Features I can't enable Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1.

Thanks tough, Paint.NET running must count for something.
(I'm hoping to see rev2 in the near future)"

livesevil, FKoops. Could you please post a full step-by step instructions for .NET Framework 3.5? I tried to install it but it failed anyhow..."
,FKoops,2011-03-11T21:17Z,"@PymblH
I followed the steps from livesevil.
As followed:
- Download dotnetfx35.exe(sp1)(231MB) form Microsoft website.
-  Open regedit.exe, go to ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\"", back up v3.0, then delete Folder ""3.5"" and ""3.0"".
- Run dotnetfx35.exe in Windows Server 2008 compatibility mode and install => Failed.
- Restore the v3.0 registry.
- Run dotnetfx35.exe in Windows Server 2008 compatibility mode and install => Success.
- Delete folder "" C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5"".
-  Run dotnetfx35.exe again, this time in Windows Server 2003 compatibility mode, and choose repair.  => Failed.

Optional:
- Download Paint.NET to confirm if its running.

Nevertheless I still get errors here and there.
(rev2 is overdue)"

- This .NET installation is not supposed to used for Windows 7. I think any updates related to .NET 3.5 won't work.
- Enabling Microsoft .NET 3.5.1 in Windows Features is not possible either since you install .NET 3.5 as an independent apps, not a windows features.
- Haven't try installing IE9 though, I prefer Firefox much better. I'll try when I have some time."

Thank you SOOOOOO much. It finally works! I tested it on 3ds max 2011 - and it started! Everything is running. No errors."
,webrabbit,2011-03-14T14:08Z,"Dear all,
I have been busy for days to get this .net thing working and finally it worked using a German! install program. Even the 3.5.1 updates installed after that. You can imagine I was very happy.
I wanted to share the news with you but tested my findings first by doing a fresh Tiny7 install and try it again and at the same time write a ""how to"".
Unfortunately I could not get it done a second time!!! Very frustrating! After 5 fresh installs and trying to install .NET I gave up.
The only thing I managed is to let it install all other updates. It doesn't do that from start.

I learned that Windows 7 comes with pre installed .NET 2.0 3.0 & 3.5 (you will not see it in add/remove programs) and that you are unable to uninstall using the usual methods.
Dotnetfx cleanup programs also do not work.
Probably and unfortunately eXer1ence removed too much and files from 2.0 3.0 & 3.5 .NET making them not functioning anymore.
I found methods to ""repair"" those installations but the program came back with a lot of errors and missing files. It is unrepairable.

I have a complete Windows 7 running to compare and .NET works on that one (2.0 3.0 & 3.5) even all the security updates SP1 and 3.5.1 are installed.

Basically what I did to install .NET in Tiny7 was remove the 3.0 and 3.5 data from the registry and removed the .NET Framework folders from c:\, run a registry cleaner (Eusing) and used the ""AiO-Runtimes-x86-v1.6.1"" program to install them again after using the dotnetfx programs in different modes. If you want to try it look it up in google it works very conveniently. its from sereby.org.

This program installs a lot more and if you want to try it out, run it, press the ""pause"" button (it will automatically start installing after 30 sec) and deselect what you don't want it to install. At least deselect the german language files. You don't need them. The rest is OK.

Without the correct .NET installed Tiny7 is still amazing!! My wife use it on her older DELL laptop for her job and I installed several programs without any problems including Office 2010 Proffesional, Adobe Acrobat X etc"

,barzefutz,2011-03-19T16:12Z,"Read this if you want to enable UAC prompts:

On this system, UAC is enabled and running, but since it uses the default Administrator account, the UAC prompts are disabled. This is not a tweak, it's a windows default setting, but you normally don't notice it because you are not using the default admin account. To change this behavior:

- Start / gpedit.msc
- Go to: Computer Configuration > Windows settings > Security settings > Local policies > Security settings
- Set ""Admin confirm mode for integrated admin account"" to ""enabled"" (may be named different)

Note: The options may have different names, I'm using a different system language and I tried to translate to english."

,silvioster,2011-04-12T16:35Z,"To anyone having problems with the dotNET installs, just install the latest version (4.0 currently) and set the OnlyUseLatestCLR string to ""1"" in the .NETFramework key, or use this .reg:

--fix.reg--
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework]
""OnlyUseLatestCLR""=""1""
--fix.reg--

This will make all .net apps use the latest .net CLR installed."

guys. wake up. dotnet 4 has been out for a while now. it installs just fine to Tiny 7. 

Can someone please tell me if there is a way to run a repair program to restore certain corrupted files to how they were when tiny 7 was first installed? sfc doesnt work. I don't know if that is intentional, or if it will screw up experience's work. "

Hello, I just register to give feedback:

1. Outpost Firewall fail to start (the best firewall on earth) maybe because security center removed or failed in searching installed applications. (This are my biggest disappointment).

2. Add Remove Windows Components (Uninstall IE8) does not have any effects.

3. Does not have System Restore (not big problem)

4. Men of War Assault Squad fail to start (not big problem)




If you plan future release. Please stay clean without any program installed. First because to save space to burn into CD, and because we have better software (SumatraPDF better faster than FoxitReader, 7Zip better than WinRAR). I hope you know what I mean. That's all.

Thanks and keep sharing! :)
