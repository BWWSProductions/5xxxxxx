Del 18 av 23.

TAPS visits Hilary Hodgman's home in New Jersey and tries to find the shadowy figure she and her husband have seen. Also, the guys visit the Hartford Conservatory and attempt to explain why students have heard music playing in an empty school, why lights flicker on and off, and why doors slam shut.
