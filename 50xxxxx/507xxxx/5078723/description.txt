Description

This film pulls a very difficult trick.It's fiction about recognizable people with believable worries, without ever sliding off into Serious Problem Film territory. At the end of it, I realized I had been watching a story about a problem family with some seriously troubled members. But while watching, I didn't bother about that and was just curious about the successes and failures of the sexual exploits of the children of this family. The light-hearted, matter-of-fact tone of the movie never allowed me to judge the characters or see them merely as comic objects. Their troubles were my troubles, as far as it went. What more would a film have to offer?
