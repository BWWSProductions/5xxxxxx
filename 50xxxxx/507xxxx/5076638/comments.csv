,SystemFolder,2009-09-19T22:18Z,Great CD. It's pretty much The Immaculate Collection minus Rescue Me with the addition of her newer stuff.
[T],GPATRS,2009-09-19T23:06Z,"FAKE!

Revolver has not Madonna's vocals (there is another version).

ALL other tracks are from original albums (tracks from 82-95 not remastered) 

Express yourself is the album version, not the video version (as supposed)...

FAKE!

All other tracks are not fake (from 1999-2009, these will not be remastered because already good on original album)"
