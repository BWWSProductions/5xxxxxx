,gogubbe213,2009-11-12T20:33Z,why doesn't it work in itunes?
,inb4_SEED,2009-12-01T17:27Z,"It won't import into iTunes because the ID3 tags are corrupted. I just downloaded ID3 Kill to remove the tags, and once that's done, you can add the files to iTunes just fine. It's less than 200Kb, and it doesn't need to be installed. Either Google it or just download it from here:

Or if you were skilled you could just change the songs file format to match itunes and than import"
