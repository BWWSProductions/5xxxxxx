,kenokube,2009-10-10T15:11Z,"Hey guys - this is the first time I've had a problem burning any of the Wii iso's. Using NTSC Wii with 1st edition D2CKey and have the latest Wii firmware (I believe it's 4.2).  I've tried burning this iso twice but each time I get the ""white"" screen saying ""invalid disk - consult Wii troubleshooting guide"" or something like that. I did not try patching the iso before either burn. I used ImgBurn & set the layer break at 2084960. The dvd I used was a good quality HP DVD+R double layer disk & the burn speed was 2.4x. I used the same software, disk, & settings when burning SSBB & didn't have any problems. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions? Should I patch the iso before burning? Thanx."
,coleix,2010-01-15T07:39Z,Is this for dual layer disc? or for different ISOs?
,wiirex04,2010-01-19T02:45Z,"This did not work for me. Game loads until you are about to play and then returns back to the main menu. I am using 4.2 and running the latest sofmod with USB loader gx.

If anyone gets this game running please advise and let me know if there were any tricks to get it going."
,xx21playerxx,2010-02-03T18:34Z,"Yes it works like a charm......
All 3 works Great!!  Keep up the good work.
Also For those who cant get it to work.. You will have to install cIOS38_rev17(google it) and use any version of Neogamma set alt.dol to disc, force NTSC480i and use main dol to launch the game so you can create a save file using your Mii(keep in mind you will not be able to launch any of the games here). Then restart your Wii use your Neogamma(any Version) and select individual disc.dol for the respective game you want to play.
Good luck!! and CHEERS!!!!!!"

,dielaughing,2010-09-24T20:24Z,"in case you didn't either know you MUST separate every tracker by a vacant line or else only the first tracker will work.. I just lost my copy of this so I went hunting and bam! yer it.. so we'll see if you did it properly under torrent properties.. otherwise you scrood the pooch, so to speak."
,cayo1,2010-12-23T10:37Z,"works fine, if you are using usb loader the last version( with the last version of cios for it... ver 20), only change the follow parameters at the begining...force video NTSC  and main dol DISK  later press A and everything will be fine, you have to load every saga separetly at the begining willl appear the menu: menu, metroid 1, metroid 2, metroid 3 if you choose menu only wil load the preview and get back to the HMBCHNEL, but if you choose the 1,2 or 3 you will play.......enyoy"
,red608,2011-11-05T19:13Z,seed please i need this game very bad please waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah :(
,mikeysama,2012-06-25T00:24Z,"ALL 3 GAMES AND MULTIPLAYER COMFIRMED TO START ON THIS RIP WITH CONFIGURABLE USB LOADER.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD HOBBITGAMEZ RIP, EVEN IF IT IS BETTER SEEDED ATM. METROID PRIME 3 DOES NOT WORK ON THAT RIP.

If your homebrew apps and cIOS are all up to date, you should be able to launch all the games from the menu screen without any boot.dol dickery."
