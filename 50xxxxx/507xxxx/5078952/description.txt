THE ALEX JONES SHOW
2009.09.04 Friday

Alex talks with documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger, the creator of such films as Paradise Lost, Brother's Keeper, and Some Kind of Monster. Berlinger's latest film is Crude, described by The New York Times as a "forceful, often infuriating story about Big Oil and little people." Additional guests include Russell Blaylock, a former board certified neurosurgeon, health practitioner, author, lecturer, and newsletter editor, and Leonard Horowitz, a former dentist, a health industry entrepreneur, and the author of a number of books, pamphlets, DVDs, CDs and articles on public health issues including the dangers of vaccinations. Alex covers the latest news and takes your calls.
