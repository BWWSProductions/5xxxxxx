George Guidall is another of the great readers (650+ books).

Leonard has written many well known books, with several made into film/tv:
Gold Coast, The Big Bounce, Bandits, Fifty-two Pickup, Killshot, Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Be Cool, 3:10 to Yuma, etc.
"He has been commended by critics for his gritty realism and strong dialogue. His writing style sometimes takes liberties with grammar in the interest of speeding along the story."

Thanks for sharing & caring.

  From Recorded Books:

In this hard-boiled adventure, a wealthy young playboy decides that money can buy him everythingâ€”including the right to murder. Veteran narrator George Guidall adds a smooth resonance to Elmore Leonardâ€™s sharp-edged narrative.
