Christina Milian - Christina Milian [2001]
	


Christina Milian is the self-titled debut album of American singer Christina Milian, released by Def Soul Records on October 9, 2001. The album's domestic release was delayed partly due to the September 11 attacks, which occurred just two weeks before the intended release date. Milian decided not to release the album domestically; however, it was ultimately released three years later.

Milian made her first professional musical appearance on Ja Rule's single "Between Me And You", which led to a record deal with Def Jam and the release of her debut album. Production took place in Sweden, where Milian worked with several producers. It was during the production of the album that Milian first started to write songs, and received writing credit for nine tracks on the album. Milian was displeased by Def Jam's portrayal of her image, which she felt was constantly changing and confusing the audience.

The critical response to Christina Milian was mixed; critics who gave a positive review enjoyed the catchy tracks and lead single "AM to PM", while others found that it needed original ideas. The album peaked at number 23 in the UK, selling a total of 101,986 copies and achieving Silver certification. The album spawned two singles, which charted worldwide. The track, "Get Away", was supposed to the third single, but was not officially released.
