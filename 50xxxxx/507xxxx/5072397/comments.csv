,saada245,2009-08-31T07:14Z,Nice it works and it downloaded fast!!! The game is the same old guitar hero nuthin special. Some good songs and new features but not worth to buy. 
,m0p13p,2009-08-31T22:56Z,"well, the graphics are better, drop-in-drop-out stuff, four guitarists, drummers, or wathever at once, and Kurt Cobain finally playable :D"
,Technojunk,2009-09-05T17:06Z,"When I try to burn with CloneCD I get this error:
Error trying opening file: layerbreak=1913760"
,Technojunk,2009-09-05T18:53Z,"Downloaded new version of CloneCD, and now it burns..
When i put the DVD in the xbox it says: Play DVD, but the game don't start..
What is the problem?"
,icecoldcanadian7,2009-09-07T03:19Z,"I've wasted 4 CDs on this game and got the ""disc is unreadable"" screen. First 3 discs were DL memorex (worked for me in the past) then tried DL verbatim, and still no luck. abgx doesn't pick up any corruption and passes the stealth test. I burnt the .dvd file at 2.4x speed using imgburn. So wtf is wrong?!"
