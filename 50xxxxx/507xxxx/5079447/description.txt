F.E.A.R.2.Reborn.READNFO-CPY


The official expansion pack to F.E.A.R. 2, the Reborn pack immerses gamers in the chaos of Almaâ€™s aftermath in an entirely new role: that of Replica Soldier Foxtrot 813. Gamers begin the mission as part of an orbital Powered Armor drop to reinforce their squad, and the ruined city of Auburn emanates supernatural events and familiar voices, beckoning Foxtrot813 to go against orders from Replica command. Be careful, not everything is as it seems...
