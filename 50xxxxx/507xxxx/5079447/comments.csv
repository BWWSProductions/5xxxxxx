,garthbartin,2009-09-18T07:53Z,"I installed exactly as instructed (except using the torrent suggested). now when I try to run FEAR2.exe it gives me an error. This torrent corrupted my FEAR installation, if anyone might know the answer to this could you please help. "
,apparentsymmetry,2009-10-11T14:37Z,"same thing happened to me... replaced FEAR2.exe, and it wouldn't work, then tried to revert back to the previous FEAR2.exe and Project Origin couldn't load... what a fucking waste..."
[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-13T13:44Z,"Which one's real???

,PistolSlap,2011-11-01T05:29Z,"same issue, any resolution anyone?"
,bssite,2012-02-10T01:53Z,"*** SOLUTION ***
1. Install F.E.A.R 2 (DIE edition)
2. Install F.E.A.R 2 Reborn (CPY, this edition).
3 Copy the FEAR2.EXE crack into the installed directory.
4. Download and install ""http://nadolaboratories.com/fear2reborn.zip"" into the F.E.A.R 2 Reborn folder.

Thanks to the team that provided a proper cracked Steam (F.E.A.R. 3)"
