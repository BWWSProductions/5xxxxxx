The Odyssey is the fantastic sea-farer's tale of Odysseus (the mastermind of the Trojan Horse) and his struggle to get back to Ithaca, to reclaim his kingdom and his wife, Penelope. 

We join him in the last month of his journey, after 20 years away - ten fighting at Troy and then ten buffeted around the seas by a vengeful God, Poseidon. 

En route he has many adventures involving sexy enchantresses, the ghosts of his dead war comrades, man-eating giants, six-headed monsters, whirlpools, cannibals, sea nymphs and the enticing Sirens.
