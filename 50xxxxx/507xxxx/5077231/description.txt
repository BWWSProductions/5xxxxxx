Can parents of spoilt teenagers and twenty-somethings reverse the years of 
over-indulging and mollycoddling?

Thanks to them their kids have become bone idle, workshy and devoid of life skills. 
Now these parents have had enough.  They want to fast-track their overprotected 
brats into fully functioning, independent adults using real life challenges in just 
four weeks.

With the prize of a round-the-world trip on offer, these eight 17- to 25-year-olds give up their home comforts for a house in south-east London where they must fend for themselves for the very first time - cooking, cleaning and, worst of all for 
them, working. Each episode, the most useless kid is ejected by the people who made them what they are - their parents.

Life alone gets off to a cold start when a lack of hot water sends the housemates into a spin, and they endure their first ever day of hard graft running a hotel in central London.

After watching the first episode, let me know if you want to see more of these horrible people and I'll upload it.
