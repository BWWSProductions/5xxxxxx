,jace007,2010-03-17T22:14Z,"Hi there,

I have an mkv file that's 8.70GIG - all I want to do is shrink it as a smaller mkv to fit on a dual layer DVD?"
,comicus80,2010-04-10T19:45Z,"They've figured out that this is a crack... halfway through your first conversion you'll get a little message saying ""You're using a cracked version, please buy.""  Your video will come out fine (at least the first time), so this may just be an annoyance.  YMMV"
,BeyZ,2010-11-06T00:50Z,"hey Prodvd, do you think you could get Xilisoft Blu-ray to MKV Converter??? thanks"
