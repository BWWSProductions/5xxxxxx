A BBC Masterpiece Contemporary Production (Drama/Thriller).

When the reclusive Stephen Ezard returns to London for the funeral of his brother Michael, an aid worker killed by a landmine, he feels like a stranger in his own country. 

He finds a world that has changed subtly but significantly from the one he left - biometric ID cards are compulsory, passenger profiling at all major transport hubs is common practice, public spaces are monitored 24 hours a day by digital cameras and armed police patrol the streets.
