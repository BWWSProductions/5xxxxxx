You can always open it with WinRAR, extract the .ini file, modify and reinject it in the exe file. WinRAR is great for such things... :-)"

You can always extract the files in a Dir, modify them, and rebuild from this one a new SFX. Or get the Patched version of old WinRAR 3.80 that allows to modify also the locked archives. Unfortunately there isn't such Patch for v3.90 yet."
