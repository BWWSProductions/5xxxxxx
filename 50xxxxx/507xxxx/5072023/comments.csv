 Deznaj, if Truth is good for a laugh, then I laugh harder at the lame deceptions you've been subject to your entire life. It is ok to look around and change your beliefs as new information is aquired. Or do you just care that much about what your friends think. Think about this... why trade your soul for the adoration of your friends who MIGHT die for you? Why not have faith in your one true friend Jesus who DID die for you? That's ""worldly"" logic, you know, the stuff I laugh at?
No offense meant... but if you are offended, ask yourself why because that's kind of weird."
