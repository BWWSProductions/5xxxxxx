,SPHiXiON,2009-09-26T17:24Z,when you extract it is 2.6Gb
,HotStuff2,2010-01-30T19:03Z,"@SPHiXiON: Bullsh*t, this torrent is only 250mb, for a single .iso, and when I extracted the ISO it's only 250 MB (262,215,949 bytes), not ""2.6gb"" :rolleyes: There's no freakin' way any compression out there, much less ISO (which is supposed to be an exact replica of a disc) can compress 2.6gb down to 250mb."
,snowonweb,2010-05-06T00:17Z,so if .iso doesn't compress why can it be open by winrar and other compresssion software.

facepalm

ugh... asking these questions what on earth could you conceivably need with this software? Maybe you're confused and I can save you some time by telling you that this isn't a video game or a 'studio to express' your love of vampires, hatred of daylight and love of people who hate cheerleaders.

Carry on."
