Elizabeth Canterbury is a defense attorney living in Providence, Rhode Island who is willing to bend the law to protect wrongly accused people. Running a very small law firm with her two loyal but long-suffering colleagues, Chester Grant and Molly McConnell, and her current employer Russell Krause, Elizabeth takes the case of an accused child murderer, named Ethan Foster, accused of murdering a young teenage boy. When Elizabeth suspects that the murder victim's father had something to do with the killing, she will do everything in her power to successfully defend him... even if it means breaking the rules.
