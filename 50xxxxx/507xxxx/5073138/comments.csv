,jasonphos,2009-10-18T12:36Z,Hi all - is there anyone who can seed this? We are stuck at 98% :)
,jasonphos,2009-10-18T22:56Z,"Nevermind. Once again, I downloaded via another source and am now seeding. Everyone who was stuck at 98% can than me later ;)"
,Stack0verflow000za,2010-03-19T23:39Z,"same here unfortunately :( however i did seed after i found the same file thru other means because we were all stuck on 95.5% for a very long time... I am sorry i dont seed much past the ratio of 1:1, bandwidth is seriously overpriced and we suffer a tiny 3gB monthly (up+downstream) hardcap in this part of the  world"
