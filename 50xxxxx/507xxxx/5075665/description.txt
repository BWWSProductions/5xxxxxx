In this final episode, Tony examines the huge escalation in the amount of law making with the rise of industrialised society in the 18th century. And with thinkers such as Voltaire, Locke and especially Jeremy Bentham - the man who called for a proper democracy - the modern ideas of prison reform and rehabilitation for offenders begin to emerge.

Tony relives the theatre of public executions, explains how shocking factory conditions brought the UK to the brink of anarchy until the law stepped in, and how men and women finally won the right to vote.

And he tells us about the introduction of the Metropolitan Police Act in 1829 which established London's police force - the world's first professional police force.
