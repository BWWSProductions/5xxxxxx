MP3 V0

Ever wanted to know what happens after the edit on the storming Asbury Park or the fade out on that contemplative solo on Easy Money? Well now you can find out! Presented uncut for the very first time using unreleased mixes from the multitracks without Eddie Jobson overdubs (as on USA), the power of this gig is tangible. Despite the internal politics and tensions of the period, the band taps into a ferocious energy that never stops burning. Wetton is especially inventive, infusing the material with a brutal force. At the other end of the sonic spectrum FrippÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sparkling clarity produces a consistently powerful performance that must rank amongst his very best. From the grumbling rasp of LTIApt2 through to the ecstatic demands for an encore, this is a classic Crimson show in every respect. Indispensable.
