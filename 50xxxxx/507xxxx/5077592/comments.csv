Try the Fluctuation meditation.
Play any Osho discourse using the VLC or other player
and play Osho music at the same time using the Winamp player,
playing a song list.

Set volume for music much quieter than for discourse.
Discourse voice level should overshadow the volume of music when voice gets loud.

What happens is your consciousness is going to fluctuate between hearing a discourse and music
and pretty soon you will be able to see how your mind flickers.

Plus, when you listen to discourses with quiet music background,
it is much harder to get totally distracted by the mind trips
because music in the background brings your attention to it.

Just don't play any aggressive or complicated music. Ethnic music works also.

To play .mp4 videos use VLC player.

Now I realize there will never be such a place, and in fact there shouldnt be. Only the internet can serve everyone equally, refusing no one, and it is indeed the great Institute. Praise and thanks to all who contribute to it. "
,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-10T21:42Z,"Osho was formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his teachings led members of his cult to poison over 700 people in The Dalles, OR in 1984.  He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his 'teachings' are the same - dangerous and insane.  "
,billybob45,2010-12-05T03:12Z," uploaders thanks for your efforts but please always test burn your uploads ! keep titles for each file under 106 characters so popular dvd burning software like roxio works, we need to be able to burn everything we download to dvd's so we have back ups of everything as harddrives can fail or get virus's etc...keep each files name to the point eg 

0521002508.Cambridge.University.Press.Remembering.Partition.Violence.Nationalism.and.History.in.India.Jan.2002.pdf

is too long edit it to say 

Remembering.Partition.Violence.Nationalism.and.History.in.India.Jan.2002.pdf

we dont need to be told who published each book in every file name and explain any numbering system you give , if you dont do this it can take every person hours to edit file names so their dvd burning software can work !"
