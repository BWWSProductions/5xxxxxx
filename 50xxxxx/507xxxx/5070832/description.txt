Help me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. 

The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

It's a team effort. Please do your part. 

Until I see enough seeding of previous episodes, I won't be allowing anyone to get more than 98% of these episodes. No apologies.
