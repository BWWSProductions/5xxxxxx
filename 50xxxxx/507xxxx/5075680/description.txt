Tweaked Ammo Loadouts, (GL no longer has 12 203's + More)

Made all rockets More Deadly, (a rocket can take out a APC 1 hit, and a Chopper 2 hits) for realistic purposes. Rockets also take down infantry now.

Sniper Rifles are more Accurate now, and M82A1 Is VERY accurate and has a longer hit range, can also damage/take down light armor, helos, and aircraft with the appropriate amount of shots.

Adjusted Zoom properties on M82A1 and other Sniper Rifles, m82 has a much better scope zoom now, other was too much zoom.

Adjusted Ticket Ratio so Rounds dont last so long.

Adjusted view distance on some maps for Long-Range-Sniping.

V 3.0
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
added a ton of more new maps for SP.

fixed pistol damage so their deadly now, no more 6 shot kills with pistol.

instead of Bizon AT wep MEC now gets AK101.

Added Smoke grenades to assault and support classes.

Tweaked Support Ammo kit number, now instead of 10 boxes of ammo there is only 2 for more realistic purposes.

Made all original maps thier largest size (except Dragon Valley, wouldnt work), 
64 Size original maps now for "total war"  ! Be sure to Adjust your Bot Slider to ALOT of bots for these huge maps! hopefully your comp can run it!

Added a Anti-Personell .50 Cal rifle to US Snipers loadout, antitank rifle was kind of silly for hitting people with, but now he has both.

Added PKM to MEC Support Class Loudout.

Replaced China Ak-47 Medic Gun with G36e.

Edited the medkits to heal a less rapidly for a more realistic effect.

Edited the Ammo kits to not replinish, they only get 2 ammo kits now, make them last.

Greatly Increased .50 Cal AT M82A1's damage against helicopters/jets and other small vehicles. (for christ sake its an exploding round!)

Greatly tweaked the damage on the weapons, now they will most always be a 2 shot kill, or when placed right 1 shot
(AK is still slightly more powerful than the M16, LMG's are more powerful than both of these).

Had to take out the Rotating Maplist, for some reason its not compatible with the new 64 size maps. 
But, I did edit the map tickets to be larger (600) for large scale longer single battles.


V 4.0
-----------------------------------------------------------

Made Opposing AI (MEC/China) better AI strategies, which means they are on the same pace with USMC. (Smarter AI)

Added 1 more smoke grenade to smoke grenade loadout.

Lowered ak74u and ak47 recoil just a tid bit. Before recoil was so much you
could not hit anything on full auto..

Adjusted Scar-L recoil to be a bit higher, before it was hardly no recoil, China G-Series rifles still have little recoil.

Made all rifle ammo loadouts the standard rifle loadout for infantry (6 clips of 30) what effected this was the M4

Fixed the zoom factor for the m95 barret, no longer will it have no zoom.
