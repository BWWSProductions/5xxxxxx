,erikphnx,2009-08-30T22:14Z,Thank you.  I love that when you can you include Album covers. I think a lot more effort went into making interesting album covers in the 80 then now

Hi 80zforever! First of all I want to thank you for your tremendous effort when it comes to these torrents. Thanks to you, I have many new favorite artists to listen to. 

Anyway, I have a question: Do you have any of the two albums released by a obscure 80s band called Red 7? Their song ""Heartbeat"" was featured in Miami Vice and the Michael Mann film Manhunter back in the day, and I've been on the lookout for these albums ever since.

Thanks"
