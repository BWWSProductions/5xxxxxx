[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-03T17:07Z,"Here's the plan - seeing as I'm apparently the only source for O&A atm - I'm encoding todays (09-03-09)  rip in 64k mono (like a few months back) as it encodes faster. I then need to move those encoded files to my local machine for editing. I do not have an eta as this is a new procedure for me - but it won't be 11:30 - thats for sure. Maybe 1pm est? I guess we'll find out. Hopefully it goes quick enough for me to also get the 128k encode up or there will not be a 128k until later tonight. 

Thank you for your co-operation. "
