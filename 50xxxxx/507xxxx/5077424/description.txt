Appearing during all 4 hours of the show, prophecy scholar and expert on Nostradamus, John Hogue discussed his predictions for 2009, the future of the economy and the Obama presidency, and also touched on Nostradamus' writings about the Antichrist. In reviewing some of his previously published predictions for 2009, Hogue reported that he'd been accurate about foreseeing Obama handling three international crises by the early spring, and that the new Republican party chairman would be an African American. 

Obama will be a two-term president, but he won't come into his own until his second term, when he'll evolve from being an agent of compromise to fighting to change the system, Hogue stated. New healthcare legislation will be passed in 2009, but it will be muddled and take years to straighten out, he said. The war in Afghanistan will turn into a quagmire, like Iraq was to the Bush administration, and the US will disengage from the conflict sometime between 2010 - 2013, he predicted.

On the horizon for 2010, Hogue sees a slight economic recovery, but the number of jobs will still be going down, and unemployment will hover at around 10%. A motto for 2010 might be "you can't have your past and your future too," he mused, adding that America was shifting from color to class discrimination. He suggested that a program modeled after Cash for Clunkers, giving stimulus money to fund half of the price of electric/hybrid cars, could serve to revitalize the auto industry. 

He believes a Uranus/Saturn opposition just around the corner on September 15, 2009 is significant, and predicted a possible natural or economic disaster in India, China, or Southern California. For more on Hogue's predictions, see his Prophecy Bulletins blog.
