,BeoX,2009-12-28T19:13Z,"I have to say this is an amazing band. A style unlike anything I've heard before, the male vocals remind me of Isaac Slade (vocals of The Fray). I'm contemplating buying this."

,Vampir8,2012-05-20T15:41Z,"udai21 wtf what?  the idea is if everyone gives back more than they get, then torrents are faster for all of us, and uploaders can free up their bandwidth for new ups.  Pull your finger out you leeching fucktard.

On another note. Great up, thanks. "
