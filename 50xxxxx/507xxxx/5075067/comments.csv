Hello suavecito195782,

I Do Not Know Much About PS3TEAM.
So Please Do Not Mind.
I Have A Question.
As You And Other PS3 Members Do Not Mention Sources, 
Are These Releases UPSCALED From Any Lower Source Like 720p Or You All Always Maintain 1080p Source/Bluray Disc?
Please Clearify This.
I Would Be Thankful.

P.S. Sorry For Such Mad Query.
I Am Hearing Lots Of Laugh Already!!!!!!

P.P.S. Thanks A Lot For All Hard Works.

,ArcImpulse,2010-01-02T19:37Z,"I think I read somewhere that the cameras used in making this film produced source quality than Blu-Ray video, and the movie release is just upscaled? Can anyone make some screens?"

,osriccc,2010-11-26T18:25Z,"ALWAYS download this user's movies if you're looking for perfect 1080p rips in acceptable sizes (3.99 Gb). If you want subtitles working on the movies (as they're M2TS you won't be able to have subtitles while watching in PC) you can download:

-TSMUXER
-MKVMERGE

Demux movie with the first and then merge both demuxed tracks (audio and video) with MKVMERGE. You'll have a lightly smaller file (like 3.80 Gb) without any quality lose and in MKV format so you can use subtitles."
,sabretooth1,2011-05-17T05:14Z,"SUBTITLES:

great quality thanks.
however post from osriccc not true. I tried subtitles from here:

http://subscene.com/english/28-Weeks-Later/subtitle-123981.aspx

worked fine on pc, using mpc player, just drag and drop after unzipping. No one really wants to waste time changing MPEG-TS file formats just for subs. My way easier, sorry but it's true. I'm sure you meant well though! :) 

Again thanks to uploader"
,mokaey,2011-08-09T07:58Z,"if you are worried about the quality because of the size like i was.
i can assure you that this is infact 1080p"
