,b0dyrem0ver,2009-09-16T06:41Z,"marcco's stuff is fine, maru_tips has been swallowing too much after sucking daddy off."
,MasterSzz,2009-09-28T17:05Z,"I have checked this torrent out and seems to be ok, however maru_tips is correct, marcco has indeed used Winzix in the past this is a link to 1 of his files, its rar'd and inside the rar is the winzix progam and windows iso is compressed with winzix, so he wasnt lying, i have found at least 1 more that he posted this way as well, it was a microsoft office 2007 rared and then inside is a winzix'd office iso, with winzix include to unzip it. To make it simple winzix is spyware.
this is a link to a rar'd file that is winzix inside by Marco.

,mrmajorna,2009-10-24T01:24Z,"I can start mini win XP and find my CD rom, but there I don't find Partition Magic.

From boot menu I can choose P. Magic.

But then it doesn't found any CD-ROM driver that fits.

I have a BlueRay on SATA.

HP HDX18-1100eo computer.
New, with Vista64 and I have made one more partition with Superior winXP pro x64 =)
Really great OS.

How Do I start DOS with CD-ROM support
