,Bob__Dole,2011-11-30T03:05Z,"WTF?  Dude you made a torrent with all individual files instead of a zip or rar?  lol

To those who can't get it to work - I did not get this game here but I have it.   In the regedit file there is a path like C:\\ElectronicArts\\RoadRash

You need to put the files in that path or edit the reg file to point to where you put the files instead.

It looks like someone has already played this because ""level5.RRS"" is a saved game profile that you can use, or ignore.
