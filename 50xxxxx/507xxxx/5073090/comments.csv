In the past few weeks, 0 seeders on torrents at TPB (with comments about the upload like here) give me 0 seeders. 
It's 0 seeders, so, What's going on here? "

,PXT0R0,2009-08-30T20:40Z,"Its zero seeders because the tracker is down and will stay down due to the recent legal actions. Just be grateful the site is still up and running and we could share through DHT or opentorrent. Pay no mind to the seeds and leeches, its always going to show zero."
