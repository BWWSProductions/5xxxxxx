Storyline: Despite his notorious relationship with the Church, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is once again 
called upon to decipher the clues to a catastrophic conspiracy. The Pope has died, and before conclave can begin to determine his successor, 
the four preferitti (primary hopefuls for the papacy) are kidnapped. An ominous threat of their hourly demise, along with the complete 
annihilation of Vatican City, is issued as an elaborate revenge scheme for a persecuted group known as the Illuminati. With their meager time 
limit steadily counting down, Langdon, accompanied by beautiful physicist Vittoria Vetra, must travel throughout Rome to unravel the carefully 
hidden signs that will lead them to a terrifying adversary, a harrowing discovery, and the shocking truth.
