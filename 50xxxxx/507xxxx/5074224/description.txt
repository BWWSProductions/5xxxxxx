Adela Quested, a young Englishwoman, travels to India in the late 1920s to visit her fiancÃ©, a British magistrate posted in a small town; her traveling companion is his mother Mrs Moore. 

They want to see something of the country and to meet everyday Indians, but are frustrated by the British community's insistence that relations with the locals are best experienced from a distance. 

Finally, a friend introduces them to a Muslim doctor whom Mrs Moore had seen briefly on her visit to a mosque. He takes them on an outing to the nearby caverns (a local attraction), but what happens there threatens to destroy any civility between the British and Indian societies.
