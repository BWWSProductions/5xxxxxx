,mausertech,2011-05-17T15:15Z,"""a human mind is a puzzle and its up to oneself to search for the remaining pieces""

This quote is simply true. This mind and minds like it have many pieces missing or taken over by magic and fantasy. Get a grip on the real world. Live for today and not some sky god that will NEVER come. Ask yourself one question. WHERE did you learn the myths and folk tales that are your religion? From mom & dad and those they trust. Where did THEY learn it? From mom & dad and so on and so on etc.......
they are no more qualified to know this to be true than my cat. Come out into the sun and enjoy your life!"
