Since it's a Russian release, they cut out a small scene in which they make a remark about the Russians (still censorship in the 21st century!?!?) Any attempt to get an external subtitle to run in sync will be a complete hell if you don't know this detail! Besides that, it requires Russian 101 to navigate through the DVD menu."
