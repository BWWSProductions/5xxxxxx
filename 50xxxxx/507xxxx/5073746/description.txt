Well,these guys have created a very important and profound album: Subsonic 2. 


All so called heavy shit from any band can take an example of this kind of "heavyness". Some people can get frightened when listening to this album. 

I suggest you listen to this album on a good stereo and/or with headphones and play it several times. Then judge. 

Enjoy!!! AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED!!!!!
