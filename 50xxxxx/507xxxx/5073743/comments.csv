,Cain303,2009-11-14T02:04Z,Great stuff. Thanks!
,phish1999,2009-12-13T05:15Z,This was a very enlightening book. Thanks to you and Dawkins
,BlindSummit,2010-02-26T11:17Z,"Haha, can you believe there is actually an advert for an audio bible at the bottom of this page as I am reading it. Comical"

,kitnoman,2010-06-15T15:36Z,"Mmmm, I'm downloading it now...I'm just really curious about what this book would add to the great argument...
I'm a philosophy major, but my least favorite subject was the philo of religion...
frankly, I hate it... I mean I believe that there is a God, but to say that religion(any religion) has an access to this God...I f***ing doubt it...
but you know in my observation of todays society, I think this argument is obsolete and useless... I mean seriously, what would change if one someone completely prove that there is no God...(well this is my opinion...no offence to the absolute believers and faithfuls) "
,lareth,2010-07-03T22:32Z,Jesus is the shit! Too bad christians suck at being like him XI
,penisfucker,2010-10-26T13:14Z,Fuck all Jesus freaks.
,bogdanxxx2007,2011-01-18T17:45Z,"Dawkins is a charlatan freak. In fact he has no argument than philosophy. Wich is very interpretable by anone from Mobutu to Heinrich and Jean Pierre.
Let us be serious folks, there is no argument for the inexistence of God , as there is no argument for the existence of God. Everyone belive what he wants to belive.
Yet there are many misteries to be explained, and Dawking is very quiet. If you think you have an answer for every thing and every piece of particle than you are an idiot.
Dont download this trash, it will make you think that you know everything when in fact, you are blind."
,padbeat,2011-01-27T01:24Z,"""In fact he has no argument than philosophy.""

Hahahahaha!

You're a fucking moron - theology is a sub-branch of philosophy dealing with religious belief. If you don't have anything intelligent to add to the discussion, then STFU."
,dsgjsd2,2011-02-02T19:55Z,One more profane mystery is why they install lighting-conductors on churches. Do they suspect they are  worshiping the wrong god? Is Thor still alive and kicking or do they suspect that  god is more like a head of a mexican drug cartell and gonna send a hitsquad anydays?  
,Luzzu,2011-02-12T21:43Z,"bogdanxxx2007, your eloquent and well-reflected arguments have completely changed my opinion of Dawkins.. I mean Dawking, that damn charlatan! "
,Tamarind777,2011-02-13T04:19Z,"Anyone who thinks Duh-kins is a scientist knows science even less than he does. This man is a fraud. He knows nothing at all about Biology and is just hell-bent on spreading HIS religion, evolution. He is simply a priest for the religion. I know fifth-grade creationists who know more science than he does. Hitchens? He is simply a disgruntled Christian. He simply gave up on God when his mother killed herself in Venice many years ago. She was unable to reach him by telephone, which, he believes, would have save her life had he spoken with her that day. So, he gave up on God and set out to ""hurt"" God with his idiocy. Even still, I think he is more sincere than Duh-kins. Duh-kins is simply a liar and a fraud. I am only a nursing student and Iâ€™d love to debate him and put him to shame.

I don't honestly think either of these men actually believe what they preach, and you sheep who follow behind their foolishness and nonsense aren't even smart enough to see that bashing God is their LIVELIHOOD. This is how they pay their bills. Even if they had a change of heart or didnâ€™t believe that junk, they still would not tell you anyway! â€œThe fool has said in his heart that there is no Godâ€ (Ps. 14: 1)."

,mitchells00,2011-02-18T17:59Z,"Tamarind777: Wow, you are seriously resorting to personal attacks rather than intellectual refutations? That very well shows how you are intellectually superior with your belief in an invisible supernatural entity. Please, kindly smash your head against a wall until your brain falls out."
,Sepideh,2011-03-06T13:24Z,"I am now a member of the Bay, so I can now comment. :)

My first comment will be a question to you all; How much is okay to insult someone in a comment? (Like pointing out a believers' intelligence to them)"
,Sepideh,2011-03-06T13:34Z,"@Tamarind777

First of all, what doesn't Dawkins know about biology?

Secondly, evolution is not a religion. Just wanted to make that clear.

Third and last, what would happen if a space ship was going at the speed of light (let's say God is the one making the space ship go) and the tail-lights would be turned on?"

You are a blind fool. The Church is the biggest money gatherer that has ever been! Have you ever put money in the plate? Have you ever seen the loud mouthed preachers on T.V? Cleaning up all the way."
,ashen77,2011-04-02T02:23Z,"hmmm should i be brain washed in to not believing or believing...

fuck it, think i'll just stick to believing in belief and call it a life.

The answers we're searching for depends entirely on the questions we're asking"
,Sick3r,2011-04-05T12:42Z,"Hahaha I love how creatards just CAN NOT help themselves from attacking atheism wherever they find it. It's quite pathetic really, but entertaining.

Thanks for the up! =)"
,bathcolin,2011-04-22T17:09Z,"Creationists and religious types make me sick. god doesn't exist, and jesus and his 'story' was made up by foolish men a very long time ago.

If you believe god or jesus or any of that mumbo jumbo exists then prove it. Us non believers have nothing to prove, it is you who have to convince us that something exists, not for us to prove to you that nothing exists. How can anyone prove the existence of nothing? You prove the existence of whatever it is you say exists or shut the fuck up!

Mindless brainwashed, week willed, single braincelled fools!"

,euphile,2011-10-18T05:23Z,can't you guys smell a troll?....what devout theist would honestly come to this page (the existence of which is to download two books subscribing to atheist and anti-theist ideology).  Ignore them...there won't be many theist left soon enough.
,brianxxx,2011-12-03T16:48Z,"I wish I could shoot hot cum in every wound on jesus's body, then take a shit right in his mouth....

But I can't. No one can because he does not exist, he is a fairy tale...like morals and values are make believe in Republican politicians."
