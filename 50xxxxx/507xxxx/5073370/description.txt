Story : 

In this fist-flying, laugh-aloud, stunt-action adventure, four bumbling foreigners who are sick of being broke in Bangkok kidnap the daughter of a rich businessman to solve their financial woes. The adrenaline increases and the action intensifies when the boys learn that the businessman may not be as legitimate as they thought and is in fact using the kidnapping to further his own twisted ends. 

Pursued throughout Bangkok by goons and henchmen, the boys find themselves as reluctant heroes as they try to save themselves and the girl.
