,BkkCity,2009-08-30T16:28Z,"Most of the new releases has no subs.
if there are subs then it is mostly custom subs.

Amazingbits has some Thai DVD movies with subs,
if you like Thai movies."

But.......this ain't exactly ""Silence of the lambs"" or ow't.

Not too many subtle sub-plots to follow, so even I get it.

Thanks for the upload."
