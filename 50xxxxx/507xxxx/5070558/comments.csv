,sistromo,2009-08-27T15:17Z,Proof? You obviously have no inkling what a proof and critical thinking are all about. Nothing to see here except more pathetic fundamentalist nonsense.
,ssopus,2009-08-27T18:58Z,"Thanks for the post. I don't know if I completely believe all of the facts on his web site, but I find it very interesting and was compelled to read the articles. Don't pay attention to sistromo(sister homo). Some people are closed minded and unable to play nice (he's probably out of prozac). Thanks again."
[T],verifire,2009-08-28T10:16Z,"@'sistromo': You should ask yourself, and perhaps consider to answer in public, WHY you are so antagonistic against Christian torrents, or ANYTHING that confirms or promotes Biblical truth.

I can only ponder on whether you've been
1) seeing and hearing people exploiting and destroying the good Name of Jesus, or that
2) someone has mistreated you or pushed you around in His Name, or that
3) you're a worshiper of other ""gods"", or that
4) you think that you are so educated and wise because of the many things you've read and seen, or
5) that you're really just afraid that if this Bible-thing is true, it would have an impact on the way you perceive things, and therefore need to change your ways, even though you know it would have to be for the better. Both for you and everybody else. 

And besides; nobody can take your comment seriously, since nobody has yet seen the footage in this upload. I know. I watch my peers and their percentage of the file-sharing.

Stop, both for your own and other people's sake, your spamming. Grow up..

Jesus still loves you, no matter what you think. And especially if you come to the conclusion that you are not worthy of being loved by Him..
Then He's drawn to you like a shepherd to a wounded sheep.. Precious..

And you know what: I'm not writing this to destroy you, just to try to get you on a real and truthful level with yourself and God..

The Spirit that dwells in me, drives me with immense force to meet you, and I actually feel love for you, even if you, presumably, hate me..
Is that pathetic, fundamentalist nonsense and dilutional too..? If so, I'd rather be dilutional and filled with love than the opposite.. :-)

and at 'ssopus': No, some of the things he writes about are hard to believe, but try out for instance ""Dead Men's Secrets"". That one alone is totally mind-blowing. Archaeology isn't ehat it used to be after reading that one.. :-) And thanks for the support and for saying thanks..

and las, but not least, @'zmacdaddy8': Yes, that is exactly the truth, and what this movie shows actual footage from': The expeditions to the spot, and also there's a little extra they found on each side of the crossing spot (this is a little spoiler, but  can't help it): They found two large pillars of stone. Theses have Hebrew carvings on them, mentioning Pharaoh, Moses, Miriam etc.. They were erected to commemorate the spot where God led His people across. And they were found! Right there.. That's cool.. This is a good documentary. The footage is a few years old, but so few have access to actually see it..
Hence: I upload.. :-) Maybe I'll upload a few more.. I said maybe.. :-))

In the meantime: http://www.arkdiscovery.com/red_sea_crossing.htm could be a nice place to start..? R.I.P. Ron Wyatt..

[T],verifire,2009-09-04T15:50Z,"@lithlo: Kinda like pouring oil on stirred water that comment.. I kinda liked it.. And being fundamental is actually a lot better to have clinging to your name than having no firm foundation at all to build your house on.. ..or temple.. ..or straw-hut.. But that's just my opinion.. No, wait: There are lots of people who think that!
Phew.. Even though there's little or no safety in numbers, it feels a little comforting, now and then.. :-) Cheers!"
,fan666inhell,2009-11-05T16:51Z,"thanx a lot! 
i like mr. gray's stuff. one of the few who dares to break free from the dogmatic sphere that calls it self scientific. "
[T],FaeGiN,2009-11-19T12:34Z,"sistromo is the only one here who is actually talking sense.
I looked at that pathetic website you keep hawking verifire and it is so stupid and full of nonsense that I am amazed anyone would be going on about it as much as you do."
[T],verifire,2009-11-20T00:34Z,"@Faegin: And I'm amazed at your persistence in spamming my uploads. You haven't even SEEN this documentary. If you had, and probability, archeology and truth meant anything at all to you, you'd shut your big yap.

Get off my back, spammer.. You tire and bore me."
[T],FaeGiN,2009-11-20T15:08Z,"verifire: How the hell do you know what I have or haven't seen?
Spamming your torrents?
I CHOSE to download or comment on about 5 of your uploads and you go on about me being on your back and hounding you.
Boy have you got a fucking persecution complex or what?
Go fuck yourself with a banana."
[T],verifire,2009-11-20T19:55Z,@Faegin: No thanks. Just go away. :-)
[T],FaeGiN,2009-12-01T18:12Z,"You have absolutely NO IDEA do you?
Carry on posting your 'proof' films which are no more proof of anything than my arsehole is proof of the existence of black holes..."
[T],verifire,2009-12-17T03:18Z,"@Faegin: Tempting to answer, but I will refrain.. LOL"
[T],verifire,2009-12-17T03:25Z,"And dude.. That comment actually really proves you either:
A) Haven't watched this movie, nor done any research on the subject so there's no reason what so ever to listen to you, you just hate me and what I stand for, or
B) You are one of the most narrow minded, demanding, angry and confused persons I've had to deal with on this site.

In either case; I hope God shows you the truth, and that you'll have a good life. But I think that you'll have to stop, think and then change a few things before that is reality. But that's just what I think. God might have other plans.. Bless you, man.."
,tj2jayson,2010-10-05T15:58Z,hey to all of you who say all sorts of negative things against the uploader...you just wait and see for yourself till you get there...you probably say He's after all.
