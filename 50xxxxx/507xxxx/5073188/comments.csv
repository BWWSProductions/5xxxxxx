I Love the scene where the evil Nazi's dump the old man out of his wheelchair over the balcony from the fifth floor of the apartment building. Then an officer drops a Jew attempting to escape by climbing a wall with a luger from 300 meters, then as the evil Nazi's drive away, they run over every dead Jew laying in the street.

It almost makes Ilsa - She Wolf of the SS look like a PBS documentary."

it's 700MB what the fuck else do you want?"
,corazzom,2010-01-30T21:45Z,"Bilderbooger: Obviously you have not read a lot about the holocaust (or any other holocaust for that matter). 

How absurd that kind of violence seems it happened, and has happened after on nearly every continent. 

Your comment is sickening. "
,camarPL,2010-02-09T10:11Z,"Very good, I'm interested in movies about WW and for sure this is one of the best i've seen. If you are also interested in movies of this kind you should see Der Untergang (last days of Hitler), but if you prefer movies like Pearl Harbor then this are not movies for you, because you are not intelligent enough to understand them ^^
