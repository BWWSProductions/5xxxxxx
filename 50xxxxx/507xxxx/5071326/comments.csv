I was wondering if you had Temple and the Cosmos by Hugh Nibley, man  have been looking for these e-books everywhere! I found them once on Demonoid, but I couldn't download it because I am not a member (even though I have been trying to get in for 2 years!) anyway, can you e-mail me if you have more info on those books? or if you can invite me to demonoid? (lol if you have one anyway) my e-mail is snick_mail@yahoo.com"
