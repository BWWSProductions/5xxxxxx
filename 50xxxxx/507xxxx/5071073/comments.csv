,demonicterran,2009-09-19T18:56Z,"This is as fake as it can get. 4 trojans detected, plus 2 unknown viruses."
,Artymonn,2009-09-22T19:34Z,"For all of you who keep posting complaints that all these  programs have viruses and trojans, please go buy the damn program and stop coming here. Most all reverse engineered programs, cracks and keygens are going to be detected by virus programs. That's the way it is so take a hike down to Best Buy and crack that wallet open or stay here and SHUT THE FUCK UP !!!!"
