An unpopular high school teacher finds himself the primary suspect in the case of a missing student when news gets out that he was the last person to see her in this dark comedy starring Tim Daly and Hayden Panettiere. Mr. Gibb (Daly) is reviled among the student body as quite possibly the worst teacher ever to stand at the head of the class. He's infatuated with Ally (Panittiere), a popular teen and local celebrity. When Ally suddenly goes missing, the entire suburban town descends into panic. Could Mr. Gibb have something to do with her disappearance? When a police investigation reveals that Mr. Gibb gave Ally a ride home mere moments before she vanished without a trace, the teacher who was universally despised discovers that his troubles have only just begun.
