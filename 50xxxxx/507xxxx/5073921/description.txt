Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 is the second solo album from British pop star George Michael (on this album, it is spelled as George MichÃ¦l), released in September 1990. Following the massive worldwide commercial success of his first album, Faith, this album found Michael trying to create a new image for himself as a serious-minded artist, while still generating sales. The title is a clear indication of his desire to be taken more seriously as a songwriter. However, the effort was considered by many as a commercial disappointment but critical acclaim of the album was generally good.
The album won Best British Album at the 1991 BRIT Awards.
