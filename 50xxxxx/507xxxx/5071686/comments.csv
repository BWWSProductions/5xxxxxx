,MaTiSrAw,2009-09-11T01:13Z,so do we need this patch to work the original Garry's Mod game?
,WebLiam,2009-09-19T05:33Z,hey thanks for this mate. thanks for getting back before. but i was thinking if you could upload an addon for day of defeat source because youve got every valve game for garrys mod except this. and its a pitty. so i was wondering if you could please upload it so we can add it to our garrys mod. im making videos for machinima and i sort of need it. thanks for the help again. Liam. 
,WebLiam,2009-09-19T05:34Z,"sorry, i ment just the game. i said addon for day of defeat source. cheers."
,Anthony817,2009-09-27T08:06Z,"Ya, what about the Zeno Clash content also?

I loved that game, it was so encentric!"
,Anthony817,2009-10-01T01:33Z,"Hey, I will make a hamachi network so we can play this over lan.

After we establish a network connection we can direct connect via typing the host IP address in the console.


Hamachi network: GMOD=11

,TRlCKY69,2010-03-09T04:52Z,"WTF this is confusing!

It says to ""Copy the content of it (the GCFs only) to the GMOD 11 2.0, CONTENT_GCFs folder."" but I can't find a CONTENT_GCFs folder.

Can someone help me please???"

,jimmeister,2010-07-02T23:40Z,"I've got a problem, the game worked fine before I updated but then I did and now nothing happens when I try to launch with the shortcut. Nothing happens at all, no error message or anything. Why is that?"
,Homebake,2011-04-12T11:51Z,Hey just4fun49. the ep2 or tf2 content didn't go in. i put the gcf files in garrys mod\ CONTENT_GCFs. didn't work.
