Music Videos : Classical : DVD quality



This torrent contains all seven episodes of Bernstein's Omnibus series of lectures:

Beethoven, Conducting, Grand Opera, J.S. Bach, Jazz, Modern Music and Musical Comedy.

Thanks to the original uploader of the DVD VOB files (Bolonais). I have encoded them to high-quality H.264 MP4 files that will play with QuickTime or VLC. The combined size is a fraction of the original source files, so it will be more manageable to store, download and watch.

I think these videos are priceless and hugely educational.




Enjoy and Seed!!
