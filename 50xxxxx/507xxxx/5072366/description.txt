"1980" Album from Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson

Ripped from Vinyl to MP3 at 320 kbps - some crackles but otherwise 
pretty decent sound - I think this one has not been released on CD.

I uploaded this one before, but somehow the tracks were not all correct in relation to the titles, so I had to re-do it.  I think all is well now - sorry!

Tracks as follows:

1)  Shut 'Um Down
2)  Alien (Hold On To Your Dreams)
3)  Willing
4)  Corners
5)  1980
6)  Push Comes to Shove
7)  Shah Mot (The Shah is Dead/Checkmate)
8)  Late Last Night

Please Seed if you Enjoy - thanks!
