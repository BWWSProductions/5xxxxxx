how can i follow you if we face piratebay.org is dead ? 

i cant imagine my days without you"
,spoogleman,2009-08-28T15:04Z,"Hello malestrom_HH, I'm also curious as to how I will be able to follow your awesome uploads, is there another tracker that you like to frequent?

My life will suck without the rare books and obscure stuff that you provide.

If the death of this tracker marks the end then I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you've shared with the community thus far, truly amazing stuff dude!"
[V],malestrom_HH,2009-08-28T16:12Z,"I also post on Mininova.Just enter malestrom on the search and you can find my torrents there.I cannot use piratebay's tracker because it is ""offline""

Thanks again!"
,spoogleman,2009-08-29T17:51Z,"I'm afraid that thanks to a recent court order Mininova is about to go down alongside TPB, any other trackers that you like to use?"
[V],malestrom_HH,2009-08-29T18:14Z,I also post on Demonoid but stopped because just to post a torrent I have to insert a password and a captcha and that pisses me off a little...I 'll get back as to where I could post!
,Thucydides,2009-08-31T01:23Z,"I agree, and am interested to know where I'll be able to find your books. 

In a related thought, how hard is it to get a Demonoid invite? "
,x2rob,2009-09-10T21:46Z,"Thank you very much! 

I, also, don't want to lose contact with you in the probable event of TPB death.

I have already seen your torrents on Demonoid, and now you say you upload also on Mininova, and thats good!

Best regards and take care!
