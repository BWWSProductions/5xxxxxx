,LastBoyScout,2011-01-17T03:47Z,Please Seed! I am really looking forward to seeing all these movies! I have seen the main miniseries but none of the rest! Bottom line I have been stuck on 0% for 2 days now. I don't care if it takes 3 weeks to download from one peer! I just want these films! Can't even find them in stores! Someone seed this please!!!!!! It says 18 seeders but none are online!!!!!!

,Wiskyeye,2011-04-07T09:43Z,"Thanks for the UL. Lonesome Dove seems to be missing some of the story line? The TV series had 4 parts and this UL only has 2. When 2nd part starts part of the story seems to be missing. Still a great UL, but I suggest to the DL's to find the Lonesome Dove parts elsewhere. I hope the rest is intact. [em crosses fingers] "
,Wiskyeye,2011-04-07T12:55Z,I retract my post. Lonesome Dove part is full story! Instead of explaining my mistake I will simply apologize! I'm sorry!!!

,TheNicePirate91,2012-02-23T03:49Z,"im at 70%, so close. plz seed as i will seed after.!!!!!!"
,insane_goofball,2012-07-08T15:00Z,"14 seeds. 6 leeches. I have been d/l for 2 hours. sitting at 0% and get bursts up to 3k.  There may be people sharing, but they are throttling their bandwidth so low as to make it pointless to share. Can we please seed this? most of these episodes are from before they sold VHS versions and before DVDs were invented. was just like recording cheers or magnum P.I on your VCR when you could program it not to flash 12:00. People, there is no need to worry about getting letters for sharing this one."
