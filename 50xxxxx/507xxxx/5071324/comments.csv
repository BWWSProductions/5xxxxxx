,SuiChiDae,2009-08-29T22:05Z,"Don't worry, there are plenty of seeds. They just don't show up on the site for some reason."
,LCNCC,2009-08-30T15:57Z,"yeah, that`s true. thanks"
,SuiChiDae,2009-08-31T00:37Z,I'm not sure what to put up next - any requests?
,SuiChiDae,2009-09-01T17:59Z,That really narrows it down. >_>
,peachyrocks,2009-09-13T03:07Z,"if you want a challenge, you can ul Kindred, a tv serie based on the rpg Vampire; The Masquerade ;) I found it here, but nooneÂ´s seeding, at all. Too bad, cuz itÂ´s a great serie and with the vampireloving flow of ppl that seems to expand, it would be a good one to spread around again. :)
 I was completely hooked on it when it came, like a century ago, lol. "
,SuiChiDae,2009-09-16T06:00Z,"peachyrocks: done. Enjoy the series, short as it is - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5090266"
