I will seed for at least a month."

IÂ´m seeding your torrents for 2 or 3 months."

,seamus_shite,2010-01-12T17:54Z,"thanks a lot bricktophd,
what a great movie, I actually own the trilogy on DVD, but the quality on this one is even better...
Looking forward for part 3, in the meantime I'll keep seeding this one...
Cheers

Any chance you could do Part 3 of the Godfather to finish off the triology?

Been searching for it but can't see any PS3-TEAM releases

Your a Legend!

,Anjalena,2010-06-22T21:23Z,"Brick, you're amazing. I don't have a PS3 yet, or an HDTV, but I'm hoping my KMPlayer will play it. It has the m2ts extension listed. We'll see. But I hope to one day have both the PS3 and an HDTV, and I'm so grateful that you're here with these amazing movies. The Godfather series is legend and one of my absolute favorites. But I can't find Godfather 3. Did I miss it somehow? My brain is kinda mushy. *giggle* Again, thank you for the incredible contributions."
