I found this during an Internet trawl, they purport to be unabridged readings of fairy stories as written by the brothers Grimm, do not expect them to be same as the currently accepted stories, in fact they can be a little bit gruesome, contents as per file list.


The author

The Brothers Grimm (German: Die BrÃ¼der Grimm or Die GebrÃ¼der Grimm), Jacob (January 4, 1785 - September 20, 1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (February 24, 1786 - December 16, 1859), were German academics who were best known for publishing collections of folk tales and fairy tales and for their work in linguistics, relating to how the sounds in words shift over time (Grimm's law).

They are among the best known story tellers of novellas from Europe, allowing the widespread knowledge of such tales as Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, and The Frog Prince.
