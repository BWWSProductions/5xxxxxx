Welcome to the September Indie 69 Indie Rock Pop playlist, the 
Blank To School edition.

Not much to say this time because if I don't finish this thing now, it'll
be late. 

Can you believe I've been putting together a "Best of 2009" already?
It's been that long. I will not be taking January off, it'll just be
a nice bonus, 100 track torrent. I'm sure my opinion of the best will
differ from other's, but we all have to agree that it's turning out
to be a great year for music in spite of all the hand-wringing paranoid
ramblings of frightened men in suits.

Thanks to p-duke on Flickr for this month's cover. It's a great picture.
Find the original here and included in the playlist folder.
