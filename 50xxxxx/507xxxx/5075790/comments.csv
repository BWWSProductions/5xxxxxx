,rzwablume,2009-12-21T01:31Z,Please seed.. 
,jenotron,2010-03-11T23:38Z,"separate subtitles, useless to me. i convert all mkvs into m4v."
[V],-jonny-,2010-06-21T12:41Z,Separate subtitles are not useless. You can still do your thing...
,danny_angeles,2010-06-27T08:37Z,"jenotron, you are an idiot and i hate you... you can mux the subs using mkvmerge!"
,climberism,2010-08-22T17:33Z,how come every time I mux this I get a green screen over the movie? All i was is to get rid of the german subtitles
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-02T23:59Z,You're doing something wrong. But there's no need to do that anyway because they're softsubs...
