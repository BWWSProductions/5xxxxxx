I've been looking for PLUS version for so long and because this didn't say on title or description I dismissed it.

Will seed this amazing thing now!"

,Alexdeite,2012-05-24T04:08Z,I'm confused of how little feature this has despite been the PLUS...How to backup? You can't?!
,Alexdeite,2012-05-24T05:12Z,"I was limited feature because I used the NORMAL x64 serial instead of the PLUS x64 serial on my x64 OS. this was not my fault but the person that uploaded this is since he/she didn't stated that this was the PLUS to begin with. I only noticed it was the PLUS because of the icon after installation that said PLUS in it. Now everything is working fine...all features, thanks."
