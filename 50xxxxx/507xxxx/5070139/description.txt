Description : "â€œTHE PRINCEâ€â€”Daken has proven himself capable of wearing many masks, but who's the real man underneath? As one of Norman Osbornâ€™s Avengers, he has it all: power, fame, access...but what if it's not enough? Could Wolverine's son have a heart after allâ€”and if so, will it be the Fantastic Four who help him discover it? Or will they find themselves on the receiving end of a betrayal so huge it will put them at war with the Dark Avengers?"
