Guitar Hero 3 ISO with different songs.
You need a modded Wii to play this.

ID6 has been changed to XNWE52, So it can co-reside of a WBFS drive with other GH3 ISOs. It will also make its own save.

I'm not sure if this is the complete discography of Nightwish, but its damn close. When I prepped the original ISO, I ended up with 2 extra places for songs, so I stuffed some Paramore in there to keep in with the chick rock theme.

PLEASE MAKE NOTE- I take no credit whatsoever for putting this collection together or arranging the note charts. The lovely people at the FoF forums did all the heavy lifting. All I did was put their work into a Wii game. The original thread can be found here

with links to videos of most of these songs.

Also, there are a few other things done like all songs (besides bonus) are available right away. The cheat codes have been simplified, so just go to the cheat screen and start mashing buttons and you'll unlock crap. Maybe I made the store free. I don't recall.

A couple things I missed, there still is the original music (paint it black and what-not) for the menus. The album art and details in the song store are not changed from the original.

thanks to the FoF forum and teamGhost for making this possible.

And don't let the seeder/leacher count fool you.  There are more than just TPB trackers in this torrent.  So even though it says 0/0, the torrent is (probably) still going strong.
