More Than A Woman - Toni Braxton [2002]
	

***********************************************************************************
First off I donâ€™t know what the story is with this album is. The track listings is showing 18 songs. It should only be showing 12 songs. I have tried to number the tracks as best as I can from tracks 13-18, but I donâ€™t know if they are remixâ€™s / radio edits etc. These are effectively bonus tracks.
The CD came with only a front cover (no booklet or back cover), so I am thinking this was some kind of promo CD Album. 
On Track 4 the song finishes about 2 seconds early.
***********************************************************************************
