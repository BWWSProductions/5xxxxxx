,Morno,2009-08-28T22:58Z,Looks good Downloading
,Phanamine,2010-03-11T08:17Z,I have downloaded several Torrents now. I guess I had better start Commenting.. First off.. This is a 100% CLEAN Version. This game is excellent on quality.. Of course.. I have downloaded several games from Extreme Zone and all have been Top Notch Keep em Comming good friend.. 
[T],Ton56,2010-06-09T23:24Z,"I've installed the game with Deamon, but I don't have any ""skidrow"" in the installed directory.
Maybe that's why the game don't start. It says : VALIDATION FAILED. UNABLE TO START THE GAME. I guess I did something wrong, only good writings and my earlier downloads from EXTREME always worked.
Please help !"
[T],Ton56,2010-06-16T23:01Z,"Stupid me ! ! ! ! 
Just had to copy the two prgr in the directory on C:
Sorry, the game is running, perfectly
Thanks for the upload."
,stilldirrty,2010-07-27T19:18Z,I dont understand how to install the game?
,CrazyJB,2010-10-04T01:50Z,"Okay, before anyone else blow a gasket, I'd like to help.

This can be very easy to overlook even if you have experience with rar and daemon like me.

For those of you who just found out about torrents, go get WinRar and Daemon Tools Lite.

Now, in the folder for COTN, the rar files should turn to a stack of books after you install Winrar. Double click on ANY of them and it will compile it together.

Now you will have a couple of files in this new folder: one will be very large, the other very small. Mount that large file into Daemon and it will run like you put in a disc.

IN THAT FILE THAT IS MOUNTED IS THE SKIDROW FOLDER WITH THE COTN.EXE CRACK!!!!!!!!!!!"
,robot_toast,2010-11-29T18:14Z,"sorry i don't have that much experience with this but i have hit a problem, i got daemon tools to mount an image but it won't run the game because the file d3dx9_33.dll is missing from my computer. i've tried re-decompressing the files, uninstalling and reinstalling but i still get that message. any suggestions?"
,robot_toast,2010-12-09T18:05Z,ok i threw the entire game off and tried downloading t again but i still get the error so i'm thinking i'm doing something wrong
,farcehorde,2010-12-10T22:27Z,So... I can't seem to get this to work at all... I'm also utterly inept... so can someone give me a step/by/step?
,robot_toast,2010-12-28T20:36Z,it will start like it is goin to run and then take me to the loading screen but it freezes somewhere around 92% :(
,PikeyBoo,2011-03-07T03:05Z,"Another torrent that works no faults, great job again extremezones and thanks!"
,RynnB1983,2011-04-28T04:53Z,i have the same problem...i keep getting validation error.  what am i supposed to load in steam to get the game to run?
,RynnB1983,2011-04-28T05:14Z,sorry for double posting but do you need steam to run the game?
,Rwhunited,2011-06-05T22:35Z,"I facepalmed when i realised what to do, you need to right click and open the mounted image in there you will see Skidrow, open that, copy and paste the 2 files within that and paste it into the CotN folder in program files :) Really does work if your wondering"
,Exmortu,2011-06-12T20:08Z,"Excellent upload.

Thank you !"
,ArmutAsil,2012-05-25T22:36Z,"I fear from this torrent...but after i see ""extremezone"" , and i'm calm down. So be it, let see this game:)"
