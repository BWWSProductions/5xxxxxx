fuck them.. yeah.. let them learn that they are responsible for all the piracy around the net...
"
,amazlng,2009-09-12T11:31Z,i think they all works on max 8 and 2009 too.. i saw it on their site.. what are your thoughts on this?
,vector415,2009-09-13T16:11Z,"Sorry, I haven't tried these plugins on earlier versions.  I really cannot answer authoratively on that.  I hope so :)  Someone let us know would you?

Thankfully TPB picked this up from other trackers.  The TPB tracker is apparently offline indefinitely at least from where I am."
,Superfestlig,2009-09-20T19:03Z,"I tried it on max 09, it didn't work... anyone else who have tried it? "
,vector415,2009-09-23T17:58Z," Bummer, but the plugin API changes quite a bit from one version to the next with Autodesk, with little emphasis on backward compatibility.  It really doesn't surprise me.  I think its a marketing ploy, artificial incompatibility to generate revenue by selling 'new' versions of everything you rely on.  At the same time though, if 100% compatibility was retained, then few of these software publishers would exist anymore I think.  Sort of a necessary evil I think.

 Others, like Apple, who modify their products purely for the sake of monopolizing the aftermarket without adding any value or additional QA, can go choke on a bowl of dick."
,Superfestlig,2009-09-26T22:06Z,"Works perfectly on max 2010, but i get error with FumeFx. ""Could not open file FumeFx.ini for writing. Global preferences will not be saved."" What to do???"
,Superfestlig,2009-10-09T23:29Z,And why is not the tutorials included with these files? and the gradients colors...? 
,daperdo,2009-10-14T18:08Z,"I have tried all the serials for afterburn 4.0b and made sure that the DCP tools where running and the port settings correlated. But still no activation. I have searched the web for other serials and cracks to no avail. Any suggestions, links or help would be life changing! "
,Hakri,2009-10-17T18:10Z,"I have a problem with EnLight 14...

I don't have the same authorization window than the others Sitni Sati plugins, I don't have any choice...

So I have multiple text-zone, First Name, Last Name, and on, and on, and on...

I copy ""User ID"" and paste it in the Keygen, I click Generate, I paste the serial code in ""CD SR#"" and the Authorization code in the text-zone with the same name, but I always have an error of serial, WTF ? I don't understand, somebody can help me please ? ='("
,-Ares-89,2009-11-14T12:08Z,"works fine to me! for those who think you have to copy 1 serial number, you're doing it wrong.. You have to PASTE ALL THE SERIALS IN THE SERIAL FIELD, NOT 1 OF THEM. Then paste the activation code (making sure you've chosen the right plugin in the crack program). 
Thx for this one, nice torrent!!"
,seanee,2009-11-18T01:08Z,the 2009 versions work on max 10 been using em a while especialy fumefx so easy to use
,Hellsing777,2009-12-11T20:15Z,frankvallecillo THANK YOU BROTHER!!!
,zmaj00,2010-01-13T12:58Z,"Thanks for the upload, great stuff

And thanks Ares for the pro tip, remember folks, paste ALL of the serials, don't just leave one, and delete the rest like I kept doing.

I just wanted to add for the guy whining how there is no tut files. There are, you need to choose custom install and check the box for tutorial files, which is turned off at typical (default) install."
,Exodus666,2010-02-18T07:21Z,"None of these work for me.

,shizoma,2011-01-28T01:29Z,"@amazlng Dood you are full of shit, they allow students to learn by selling them for next to nothing through education retailers which by the way are basically identical to the commercial version so man till you know what the hell you are talking about keep the ol cocksucker shut.....3ds max entire brand new version with mudbox 350 bucks on journeyed.......same with maya same with ALL this software there is a difference between your bullshit opinion and the truth maybe do some research, you did enough to find it this way why not buy the educational version if you really are a student.....i know these things from experience i bought the educational version, but i do think this is imprtant for those who dont have the means and ARENT in school and want to up their skill set being an artist is a 24/7 job and thanks to you for helping us out"
