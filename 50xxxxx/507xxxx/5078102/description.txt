Again, read the instructions for each, keygens are provided by X-FORCE, to whom I am in no way affiliated.  Gripe to them if it doesn't work.  If you like the software enough to use it all the time, and *especially* if you're profiting from it, buy a damned copy.  These guys put a lot of work into their software and it shows in the end results.



A note to Sitni Sati: You guys make some awesome fluid dynamics simulators but there are no versions available in an affordable price range for casual users.  I, for one, would buy a copy of each if you offered a casual licensing option.  And apparently you need to work on your licensing mechanism, it looks like once you've cracked one, you've cracked them all :)
