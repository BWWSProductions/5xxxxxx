What is this ; a multi installer or what ??? Get with it."
,PROTEOUS271158,2009-09-12T08:24Z,"First I'd feel Imust say , Hannibal99 you need to mellow out man. Just download it and try it.

IT ALWAYS WORKS GREAT....NEVER FAILED ME EVER.
THIS IS THE BEST OS I'VE EVER USED!!!!
I've got a lot of computers and fix even more.
I've also got every apple and windows operating system you can imagine right up to win 7
Over the past 4 years I've collected and tried over 50 modded OS's on many different computers from crap to the latest desktop ,laptop and virtual pc.
THIS HAS NEVER FAILED ON ANY OF THEM. 
It's the all around favourite with everyone I know,and JOHNNY's the onlyone that the sidebar works flawlessly in.
GREAT GOOGLY WOOGELIES JOHNNY, YOU DA KING!!!!
OH,and yes burn on slow speed for best results."
,rainagain777,2009-09-13T00:07Z,"I want to try this, but why cant 'johnny' put out a stripped down version? 4 gigs? And all the bloatware? Nero, etc?
I'd snap that up in a hot second!"
,trackBenzer,2009-09-19T00:48Z,"because he doesn't want to! it's his creation! he does it as he most likes it.

i personally like the choice of programs integrated.
anyone that doesn't like the programs should just get another xp... there's so many of them around here!"
,Focus88,2009-09-20T21:28Z,"I say, why not? It is almost free (electricity to your computor and the cost for Internet) and Windows XP clean is pretty naked, like a car without anything but the engine.

And, Johnny 78, big thanks!"
,wrocnrob,2009-09-26T08:58Z,Mere words can not express my gratitude...but thanks anyway.  Very impressive skills.
,doc76,2009-09-26T12:20Z,"Last one was ok,dont see would anyone shit about it if he didnt try it,right Hannibal99?
Thanks Johnny..."
,Hannibal99,2009-09-26T18:35Z,"OK. Tried it and not too bad. I was having bad day when I wrote this last comment.Do not like that Nero full install is auto,this has always seemed bloated to me. Everything else seems to be O.K. but for a little prob w/ IRQ settings;I cant change them because of conflict w/ Vid card (nVidia)system won't let me??. Am posting on Winxp.form for help too,but if you have answer would be helpful."
,shotsan,2009-10-04T10:41Z,Please seeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
,hanzo777,2009-10-07T14:05Z,is this a fast windows??
,skaushik92,2009-10-11T02:56Z,"Thanks a lot Johnny!

I installed this on my mac for some programs I needed! I am really pleased with it!

I think though that MS Messenger might have been not installed originally, along with Windows Movie Maker, but other than that I was very very pleased!

Thank you so much! Definitely 5/5 for how it works, and its improvements.

If it works too slow, it may be because of drivers that are needed. I installed the drivers and everything works beautifully!

Once again, Thanks!"
,shotsan,2009-10-12T18:18Z,"is it bootable or clean instalation
