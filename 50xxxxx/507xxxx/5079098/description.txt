A man learns a powerful lesson about the price of immortality in this thriller from Thailand. The Opapatikas are a special breed of people who have died only to be resurrected and given special powers; they are invincible in combat, cannot be killed, and gain unique super-human skills. Detective Techit (Putthipong Sriwat) is a police investigator who has learned the secrets of the Opapatikas, and wants to join their underground fraternity; he approaches Opapatika master Mr. Sadok (Nirut Sirichanya) in hopes of turning this dream into reality. Sadok allows Techit to become a Opapatika after the detective takes his own life, but as Techit gains the ability to see into the future, he begins to gradually lose his mortal senses as he does ritual battle with others. Opapatika also stars Somchai Khemglad, Shahkrit Yamnarm and Ray MacDonald.
