Behind Enemy Lines Blu-ray

20th Century Fox | 2001 | 106 mins | Rated PG-13 | Nov 14, 2006

Fighter navigator Chris Burnett wants out of the Navy: he was looking for something more than boring recon missions he's been flying. He finds himself the lone Christmas day mission over war-torn Bosnia. But, when he talks pilot Stackhouse into flying slightly off-course to check out an interesting target, the two get shot down. Burnett is soon alone, trying to outrun a pursuing army, while commanding officer Reigert finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics, forcing Burnett to run far out of his way.
