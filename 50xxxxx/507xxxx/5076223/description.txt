Complete and fully patched World of Warcraft 1.12.1 client, build 5875, locale enUS. 


This is the Windows (PC) client ONLY. Completely clean; no add-ons, patches, cache files or configs are included (besides realmlist.wtf; running WoW.exe will generate a new config.wtf.) Feel free to use it with whatever private server you want, or patch it to a later version.


Patched from a base 1.11 client. Using the repair utility included will only bring it as far back as 1.11.
