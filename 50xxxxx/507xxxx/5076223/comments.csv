,ClassicGaming,2011-09-11T06:07Z,"ClassicGaming is a brand new 1.12.1 server that has been in testing phase for several weeks and it's now time to go live.

http://classicgaming.servegame.org/accountcreation


Server information:

- Instant level 60
- Working spells and talents
- Working honor system, battlegrounds and scripted instances
- Dungeon 1 starting gear with equivalent weapons and off-pieces.
- Dungeon 1 drops has been replaced by dungeon 2. (Bosses/trash mobs that dropped dungeon one now drops dungeon two gear instead, at the same rates)
- The amount of players needed for raids has been tuned down to make space for more guilds, please note that this does not mean that it's easier. (40 man -> 20/25 man and 20 man-> 10/15 man)

and much, much more - come see for yourself! All we lack is the players"
