There is no need for 320MiB to answer: There is nothing great at all...
This book is a weak and stupid try to justify the cruelties and perverted laws of the christian community. It tells many 'adapted' truths and lies to make people forgive the past of christians.

Another try of the christian sect to make people join them ..."

Just what past are you referring to? If you're talking about Catholicism, them you need to do more reading. Yes, they murdered over 50 million innocent folks, but since when do they represent all of Christianity. In fact, they're not even Christian at all. All Catholicism is is a mixture of Roman and Babylonian paganism with a Christian disguise. Catholicism began as a Roman political movement to stamp out Sabbath keeping Christians. Why do you think they introduced Sunday keeping, the day of the sun god they used to honor up to the second century? True Christians keep the Sabbath according to the Bible and the Ten Commandments, NOT Sunday according to the Church of Rome. Even Jesus was a Sabbath keeper. Again, that's not Christian. 

So, if you're speaking about the ""past"" of Christianity, meaning all the killings, then let me ask you this: Just who has the Seventh-day Adventists killed? What about the Baptists? Pentecostals? Should I continue? Do you get the picture? Look at all the good Christianity does today. Look at all the charities. Do you know of any atheist, Muslim, Hindu, or Jewish charities that even come close to those of Christians? In fact, I can't even think of one worldwide charity from any of those groups.

If you're an atheist, then what about the over 200 million people killed by your compatriots, Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin, etc? They all killed and were urged on to do so by an atheist and evolutionary belief system. What about ALL of the school shooters? I am not exaggerating, EVERY SINGLE ONE of the school shooters were evolutionists and they all used it's philosophy to murder. In fact, Columbine happened on Hitler's birthday, April 20th. Also, what about Jeffery Dahmer? He said with his own lips that the evolution religion/lie (it's certainly NOT science!) deluded him to murder and eat his victims.

Clearly you're either ignorant, deluded, or you just don't read much. If it were not for Christianity, this world would be a living hell."

So, truth is relevant where evolution is concerned? Saying that carrots and humans sharing a common ancestor is truth? That life originated from rocks 4.5 billion yrs. ago? That life came from non-life? Organic from inorganic? That's truth/science? Saying that a big bang occurred 15 bya and ?nothing? exploded? That disorder brings about order? Using the rock layers to date the fossils then using the fossils to date the rock layers? Ever heard of circular reasoning? Lol?That?s what you believe! Lol..Try looking up the definition of science. It means to ""know"" through using the five senses. Which sense do you use to ""know"" evolution? NONsense? That's the only one you CAN use. Your religion is neither observable, testable, predictable, nor repeatable. It's a faith-based propaganda and outright lie. It?s a religion.

Let me ask you this: why don't you see lots of lawyers who are evolutionists? Do you know why? Because lawyers are critical thinkers, they use logic. I know tons of lawyers and NONE of them believes that junk. In fact, most of them are not even Christians, and they still don't believe it. Even further, one of them is an atheist and STILL does not believe that lie. Evolution simply lacks common sense. The only sense it makes is nonsense. Oh, and please don't say ""lawyers are not scientists so they wouldn't know."" Well, Darwin was not a scientist either. He had a religion degree! Anyone can study and become an expert in evolution. Know why? Because there is NO specific academic scientific discipline that is called evolution. You can't get a degree in it. It's a layman's field. In fact, I have degrees in English and Psychology, NOT science and I?d love to debate Richard Dawkins! I?d put him to shame. I?ve debated biology professors at my school and at the end you can see that they know deep inside their heart that evolution is simply an impossibility. There?s only so far you can take a lie before it begins to fall apart, and you don?t need to go very far with evolution for that to happen. The problem that they (and you) have is the alternative to evolution. You see, there is not a third option. Either God did it, or it evolved, and you all have a problem with a God Who will one day judge you. Since there is an impending judgment, you can?t live just any way you want, which is your problem."

Now go away and d/l Dawkins ""God Delusion"" (which refutes your every feeble-minded point) and learn something before you come on here spouting off! "
,chuzzlewit,2009-09-07T17:07Z,"The author is obviously involved in apologetics.  Many people have a misimpression of what apologetics is, thinking it's about convincing the skeptic that he's in the wrong; however, the primary purpose of apologetics is the keep the already-believer in the fold.  It's a multi-billion dollar business so the question becomes, ""if the bible is inerrant and Christians are so convinced that they're right, why is there a need for this billion dollar business to insure believers keep believing?""  The majority of Christians have no idea what the bible really says and the Church wants to keep it that way."
,Blue-Sun,2009-10-03T19:20Z,"tamarind777, you must read real history instead of christian apologetics.  

Hitler was a Catholic who never gave up his faith.  In the last few years of the Third Reich, he turned against the Church (but not religion) as a rival for power.  In addressing the SA (Sturmabteilung), Hitler's brownshirt storm troopers, Hitler instructed:

""Let us pray in this hour that nothing can divide us, and that God will help us against the Devil! Almighty Lord, bless our fight!""

Hitler's hatred of the Jews was the direct result of centuries of of the German church's anti-Semitic teachings, which enacted a 'passion play' every year in which Germans were taught that the Jews killed Christ.   Hitler's youth and young adulthood in the German Catholic Church inculcated him with his hatred of the Jews.

Stalin, interesting enough, was training to be a Georgian Orthodox monk on scholarship to a seminary. When his scholarship ran out, he was discharged for inability to pay his tuition fees.  He was attracted to Marxism precisely because it was a similar hierarchical belief-dependent community which promised absolute truth as revealed in Marx's 'holy' scriptures.

Communism has far more in common with religion than with atheism, despite their claims to be atheists.  They have merely substituted the State for the God.  They have their primary prophet, Karl Marx, an equivalent role to Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, as well as a pantheon of lesser prophets, Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Engels, and so on.  They have their equivalent of the holy book, the Communist Manifesto.  Interestingly, many of Marx's essays and poems were written in theological language.

And, unlike atheism, which is grounded in reality and the scientific method, Communism demanded complete and unquestioning faith in the tenets of its pseudo-religion.  The true Communist was just as much a member of the faith-based community as was the true Christian. Communism was a religion in everything but name.


Pol Pot (real name Saloth Sar) was also educated in the Christian religion, attending the Ăcole Miche, a Catholic school in Phnom Penh. As with Marx, Lenin, et al., he created a faith-based movement based on the 'absolute truths' handed down by Marx and Lenin.  

The regimes of Hitler, Marx and Lenin, Mao, and Pol Pot were twisted versions of Christianity in which the all-powerful 'parent' was the State in place of God and the holy writs (Mein Kampf, The Communist Manifesto, and Mao's Red Book were accepted as revealed truth, the analogs of the Jewish and Christian bibles and the Islamic Qur'an.

The message here is that the worst atrocities in world history arise from absolutist systems that require unquestioning belief and unquestioning adherence to 'revealed truth' handed down by charismatic prophets - whether the systems are called Christianity, Islam, Marxism, Nazism, or whatever.

The best quote I can offer on the the difference of Christians and true atheists is from the works of philosopher Eric Hoffer:

""The opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical atheist but the gentle cynic who cares not whether there is a god or not.""
