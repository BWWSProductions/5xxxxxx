"Lalee's Kin: The Legacy of Cotton" was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Documentary Feature category in 2001 and that was well-deserved. This film shows the trials and tribulations of one African-American family that tries to overcome 100 plus years of past slavery in Mississippi. The titled character, an elderly woman with many kin-folks that live with or near her, tells a heart-breaking story of life, loss and future uncertainties. A wonderful and important slice of life from film-makers Susan Fromke and Deborah Dickson paints a picture of a southern state in the U.S. that still seems to be reeling from old mistakes this nation has made.
