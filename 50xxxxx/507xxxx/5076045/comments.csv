,TheChoZen1,2010-08-14T19:17Z,How come after the scan it ask for registry key!?!?!?
,gwp1234,2010-11-05T07:46Z,"This is an incomplete work as patch does not stop RegAce from asking for Rego number after scan.
Of no use am deleting it & moving on."
,sandramarie,2011-03-10T13:59Z,"I just wish when people put programs on here that they would take the time to explain how to install it..Not that I donâ€™t appreciate it..Because I do.
Now it is working for me and here is how I did it. 
I am running windows 7 (64)bit..
unzip
Right click on regace.exe  and run as administrator â€¦.   Follow instructions...at the end of installation it asks if you would like to run the program â€¦untick the box .and DO NOT CLOSE IT YET.
Now go to the patch.exe right click and copy it toâ€¦ (C;) ===program files (x86)=== RegAceâ€¦paste it in there. now right click on the patch and run as administrator..
Wala your done .."
