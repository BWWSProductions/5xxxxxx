A really hard-hitting set from Cal Tjader and one that's done with a good dose of 60s Latin Soul as well! The album was recorded in the early 70s, but it's really got a late 60s New York flavor thanks to arrangers Charlie Palmieri and Tito Puente who cook up a groove that's sockingly soulful, and much more outta site than some of Tjader's other work from the time!  The style here is more Fania than Fantasy Records and Cal jumps right in with some great work on vibes ringing out in a tight, Joe Cuba-esque mode on cuts that include great covers of "El Watusi" and "Bang Bang" plus "Gringo City", "Vibe Mambo", and "Mambo Show".  Proof that Latin Soul was alive and well in the 70s if you knew where to look! ~ Dusty Groove

This lp brings back one of Cal Tjader's best late-period recordings and finds the vibraphonist adapting his 1950s Latin jazz concept to the 1970s without losing any vitality.  Tjader is joined by four horns, the legendary keyboardist Charlie Palmieri, electric bassist Bobby Rodriguez, and six percussionists; Tito Puente (who plays timbales on Mario Bauza's "Tanga" ) and Palmieri provided the heated arrangements.  Highly recommended to collectors of Latin jazz. ~ Scott Yanow
