Sometimes peoples minds are just so fataly dumb! ..
Flame me ..whatever ..just go figure, that you could try to find out for yourself if this will work on Xp or not!
Cant be that damn hard to download it ..and run it to see ..My GUESS is that it is NOT gonna work .And if so, I guess its not gonna work that good like on Win 7 ..
And for the record CAPS sucks balls, when its used all the way in a sentence ...go figure why ..."

,Oreo2996,2010-03-17T23:40Z,"When I enter my e-mail, and then my country, and then click next, it doesn't work. It has a check next to ""Connecting."", a check next to ""Sending data to server."", but the last thing""Waiting for a reply from the server"", has a red ""X"" beside it. I then click next and it says ""An error occurred during product activation"", and it recommends activating it again, but it doesn't work, I've even tried it with several e-mails, please help."

[ Waiting for a reply from the server"", has a red ""X"" beside it. ] Happens to me too no matter how many different versions of Panda I install, they don't work as of Jan 2010 using any torrent anymore.

It must be the Panda company blocking updates or the ability to activate for known doubles of subscriptions like these. Only explanation.  People are going to have to buy the product from now on.  "
