Acland's DVD of Human Anatomy


The six DVDs in this remarkable and beautifully produced DVD anatomy atlas explore the fundamental structures of the Musculoskeletal System, the Head and Neck, and the Internal Organs.

DVD 1: The Upper Extremity
DVD 2: The Lower Extremity
DVD 3: The Trunk
DVDs 4 and 5: The Head and Neck, Parts 1 and 2
DVD 6: The Internal Organs

These DVDs show you true images of real, exquisitely dissected human anatomical specimens, in three dimensions. As the camera moves from one viewpoint to another, the specimen appears to rotate in space, letting the viewer experience it as a three-dimensional object. Acland's DVD Atlas uses fresh, un-embalmed specimens that retain the color, texture, mobilityâ€”and beautyâ€”of the living human body.

A concise synchronized narration runs throughout the program. As each new structure is shown, its name appears on the screen. There is a self-testing feature at the end of each section. Specific content can be accessed through detailed searches of the index and table of contents.

For students, Acland's DVD Atlas is a time-saving aid to first-time learning, an effective way to relearn anatomy for clinical rotations, and a time-efficient tool for review. For clinicians in training and in practice, it assures a swift renewal of anatomic knowledge. For teachers, Acland's DVD Atlas shortens the time needed to provide immediate, satisfying explanations of three-dimensional structure.
