,Fwteinos,2009-09-27T09:52Z,"I seriously doubt that any of the creators are satanists, but they know very little of ancient mythology and they not only leave out many many important facts of Christianity, but they also change some of the facts. Example: common knowledge that Christ was not truly born Dec. 25, but sometime in Spring. We only celebrate it in Dec because it was originally a pagan holiday and it made the shift to Christianity easier for Romans. Nowhere is it indicated that he began his work at 30. He was born 6 BC, not 4 BC. The Greek word ?????? (aeon) means eternity, and is written ??? ???? ?????? ??? ??????, literally; to the eternities of eternities (used in the same sense as King of Kings)."
,Fwteinos,2009-09-27T09:55Z,TPB doesn't like my Greek. The 1st word is aiwnas (aeonas) and the following string is eis toys aiwnas twn aiwnwn (is tus aeonas ton aeonon)
