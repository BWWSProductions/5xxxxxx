,dragonzer0,2011-01-20T21:27Z,Where's the ISO? What do you do with add-rdst files? States extract files. You can't.

   There is probably an easier way but this is how I had to do it. Yuo need Win RAR. Copy the files to RAR archive. Open the archive and with the convert tool check the rar box and convert. This takes a while but you will end up with an add-rdst ISO. open ISO unpack the files to new folder click set up to install. I hate rar files anyway but this rar format really sucks. 
Thanks for the up, but thumbs down to the original file splitter."
