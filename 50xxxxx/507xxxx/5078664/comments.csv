,Kagura,2009-09-04T19:22Z,yes im seeding this as we speak. :-)
[T],Knaster,2009-09-04T19:29Z,Slow? It's not like its a huge sized patch is it? it only takes 10 mins max jeez lol
,Kagura,2009-09-04T19:31Z,gamersgate is slooooow for people in the US. It took me an HOUR to download these stupid 43 megabytes from Paradox's server!
,Kagura,2009-09-04T21:46Z,"A month ago when HoI3 first came out, I paid for and downloaded it from gamersgate the SECOND it was available... I was getting 5kb/sec download and about three hours later I just grabbed the torrent... sigh."
,telesien,2009-09-04T22:11Z,I don't mean to be ungrateful... but will someone seed or what?
,Kagura,2009-09-04T22:21Z,I have been seeding nonstop. Be patient and we'll connect.
,telesien,2009-09-04T22:35Z,"Sorry, my bad. TPB page shows 0 seeders, but when I tried it a lot showed up. Please desregard my previous statement"
,atta_trol,2009-09-04T23:58Z,i'm going for Pax Sovetica just now!
[T],Knaster,2009-09-05T13:04Z,Kagura you are  not a true paradox fan. :(
,Kagura,2009-09-05T13:24Z,"I wouldn't have even *considered* uploading this torrent if the gamersgate servers could provide the necessary bandwidth. They couldn't, so I decided to upload this torrent to give everyone the proper bandwidth.

I'm an active, helpful forum contributor and I actively strive towards helping the community. I don't mind giving the path to warezers if it means a large portion of the community in general can get the patch more conveniently."
,Mesenion,2009-09-05T17:13Z,Thanks
,DikkatDeliVar,2009-09-06T01:35Z,Thank you a lot :) You saved us from waiting for many hours.
,Superbus,2009-09-08T06:54Z,"This patch hardly matters, I bought the legit ""alpha"" version and its still broken 3 patches later, wait on 1.3 or 1.4, too many broken things not working as intended still, though you its fun for a few years till the bugs break your back.

I suggest HOI2 Armageddon and 1.3 b2 and C.O.R.E 4.0 with GIP .9 and SKIF icons, it looks great and plays much better, also just use the res-changer to up the old hoi2 graphics. 

Then wait 6 months for hoi3 to be fixed."
,GrazieRoma,2009-11-14T15:34Z,Does this patch fix the horrible game speed?
,Amaximus,2009-11-30T02:32Z,Any chance someone making a 1.3 crack? 
,Major Cocaine,2009-12-23T23:13Z,"Even their forums are totally bugged up. Don't even download the game, the game is totally broken!"
,svecenik,2010-07-29T22:49Z,You can find new beta updates here!hoi.comule.com!(with out !) No need for game key or some other stupidities!
