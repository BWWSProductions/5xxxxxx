After searching the net for a bittorrent client thats runs on U3 USB-Stick, I ended up packaging Bitlord for U3.

If you run U3, choose Install from Computer, and select the file.

You can now carry Bitlord with you, downloading files wherever you are.  You can download a part on your home computer, take it to work and continue, or why not when you travel??
