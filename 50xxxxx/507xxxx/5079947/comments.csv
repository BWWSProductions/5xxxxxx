Try next time checking Initial Seeding when setting up a torrent."
,JiveTurkeyJones,2009-09-09T17:58Z,"Yeah peladi30, appreciate the u/l, but It seems like initial seeding was left off maybe, because everyone has been stuck at about 95 to 96 percent for the last 2-3 days, I've made about 1 percent progress in the last 48 hours, and that is steadily slowing. "
