,Kroyon,2009-09-04T00:13Z,"Yeah I've downloaded this waste of space to then realize it was compressed with this piece of shit winzix. I did google it and everyone says its a scam software. So I downloaded a freeware that let you view inside winzix files and the compressed file inside is named SP3.daa.
Do not download this, save your bandwidth."
,nootyguy,2009-09-05T09:49Z,"I added some detailed comments to the bitcomet about this torrent.. 
01. THIS OS NOT A BAD OS AT ALL [Windows XP Professional SP3 2002 and its Genuine]
02. THE SOFTWARE WHICH USE TO ZIP THIS OS IS A SHIT [Kaspersky 2010 doesn't even allow to download this software. some says WINZIX is a TROJAN, MALWARE, SPYWARE. *as i know its very hard to unstall WINZIX after install it]

so.... I took a risk to unzip this cause i thought its XP PRO SP3 2009 with all latest updates but.... 

* DOWNLOAD THIS BUT BE CAREFUL ABOUT WINZIX SOFTWARE... still you have 2 options left 
I. Install WINZIX to the machine you gonna format and UNZIP this [dont forget to format the machine after that]
II. create a System Restore Point n restore your system after UNZIP this OS...."

,madmaniac58,2009-09-06T16:58Z,marcco is a dumbass why use winzix?
,megaman951,2009-09-19T19:45Z,where is the serial number??
,shinOUU,2009-09-20T17:58Z,"IT""S A TRAP!!! AVOID this POS, and fuck you marcco for wasting our time."
,brandone,2009-11-01T13:10Z,"Oh comeon, folks! This is not by chance. I consider 'marcco' himself as being part of those, who try to spread malware! Because this seed contains a 'compressed' file inside a 'compressed' file and this procedure does not make any sense at all, the whole thing is just to get people to 'install' the 'winzix'-trojan, nothing else. Why didn't he just post an .iso-file?!? I really wonder why there are still seeders and leechers on this post, don't they read anything that's written here? "
,sivathedon,2010-06-27T04:34Z,thank q... and  seed me please...........
