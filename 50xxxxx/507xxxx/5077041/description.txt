From Wiki:



Ani DiFranco (pronounced /ËˆÉ‘ËniË/) (born Angela Maria DiFranco on September 23, 1970) is an American Grammy Award-winning [1] singer, guitarist, and songwriter. She is a prolific artist, having released over twenty albums[2] and is widely celebrated as a feminist icon.


DiFranco was born in Buffalo, New York, to mother Elizabeth and father Dante, who both attended and met at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[6][7][8] She started playing Beatles covers at local bars and busking with her guitar teacher, Michael Meldrum,[9] at the age of nine.

In 1989, DiFranco started her own record company, Righteous Records (renamed Righteous Babe Records in 1994).[2] Prior to the renaming of Righteous Records to Righteous Babe Records, DiFranco worked with manager Dale Anderson, a writer for the Buffalo News, who later started another record label called Hot Wings Records when the two parted ways. Hot Wings released the work of Buffalo area female musical performers with styles similar to that of DiFranco. Early releases of her CDs produced prior to 1994 are labeled with the original Righteous Records label. Her self-titled debut album was issued on the label in the winter of 1990. Later, she relocated to New York City, where she took poetry classes at The New School and toured vigorously.

DiFranco identifies herself as bisexual,[10][11] and has written songs about love and sex with both genders. She addressed the controversy about her sexuality with the song "In or Out". In 1998, she married sound engineer Andrew Gilchrist in a Unitarian Universalist service in Canada, overseen by U.U. minister Utah Phillips[citation needed]. Numerous media sources reported that her fans felt betrayed by her union with a man.[12] DiFranco and Gilchrist divorced five years later.

In 1998, DiFranco's drummer, Andy Stochansky, left the band to pursue a solo career as a singer-songwriter. Their rapport during live shows is showcased on the 1997 album Living in Clip.

DiFranco's father died early in the summer of 2004.[13] In July 2005, DiFranco developed tendinitis and took a hiatus from touring. DiFranco had toured almost continuously in the preceding fifteen years, only taking brief breaks to record studio albums. Her 2005 tour concluded with an appearance at the FloydFest World Music and Genre Crossover festival in Floyd, Virginia. DiFranco returned to touring in late April 2006, including a performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival on April 28 and a performance at the renowned Calgary Folk Music Festival on July 30, 2006.

DiFranco gave birth to a daughter, Petah Lucia DiFranco Napolitano,[14] at her Buffalo home on January 20, 2007. The child's father is DiFranco's new husband, Mike Napolitano,[15] the co-producer of DiFranco's 2006 release Reprieve. Essentially a full-time resident of New Orleans, DiFranco is heavily influenced by the city's post-Katrina plight.[16][17]

She has continued touring into 2008 with a backing band consisting of Todd Sickafoose on upright bass, Allison Miller on drums, and Mike Dillon on percussion and vibes. DiFranco returned to the Calgary Folk Music Festival in July 2008.

Napolitano and DiFranco wed in January 2009 in Hawaii.
