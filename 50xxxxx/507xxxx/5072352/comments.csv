[V],neon,2009-08-29T08:52Z,thanks only1joe....can you tell me how to put a picture on my torrents please.
[V],only1joe,2009-08-29T10:51Z,"I usually have a folder on my desktop so i can put my image sinto that i want to upload, just so they are easy to find.

On your piratebay upload torrent page
goto --> Image tag from bayimg - - - click on the bayimg link which will open a new page.

Click the browse button to find your image on your computer.
Goto --> Removal Code and enter a password [one that you will remember]
Goto --> Tags, I dont bother with tags [i just put only1joe in there.]
Goto --> Settings and click on it. A sub menu opens. Click on Resize image, and highlight --> 300 x 300 TPB - Image Torrent

Now click UPLOAD

After a minute or less, your image will be uploaded.

Here is an example of what you should see

http://bayimg.com/oADpmaacI

all you need is the last 9 letters/numbers on the image [just double click them, and copy them]

--> oADpmaacI

Now go back to your piratebay torrent upload page and paste in Image tag from bayimg box

When you have finished making your torrent and uploaded it, you should have  a picture on your uploaded page.

,mdgtusc,2009-10-10T21:30Z,"I'm not sure if this is my fault, but I downloaded this torrent and have more than a few skips or skip like activity.  Maybe this is my fault because I kept changing the download and upload parameters as I downloaded the torrent.  What do you guys think?"
[V],only1joe,2009-11-13T23:15Z,"mdgtusc - 

Sorry dude, i a have been having problems logging into my account.

I have listened to the album but (maybe my ears are bad) I am not picking any skips.
Is there any specific track(s) that this skipping is occuring on.
Anyone else having any similar issues, please comment.
