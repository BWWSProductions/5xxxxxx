,snowbirds,2009-11-18T07:47Z,"I don't get it.  Can't find any mention of a 154 min version anywhere.  Also, when I look at the cover for this one, it says 127 mins...  So I'm confused about which version this is.  

I want the US theatrical cut, which is Romero's self-proclaimed directors cut...

,mariusjr,2009-12-08T08:08Z,"Because, like the 156 minutes version, the 154 minutes version is not official. Made by fans, and it is a compilation of several versions.

The German (Krekel's) version is badly remixed.
The 154 minutes version is much better.

I uploaded this same movie, only with dutch subtitles:

,Jenna_PT,2010-05-19T07:30Z,"Dude, the cover pic u have posted says that this is the theatrical version and that it's 127 minutes long"
,Simon_p,2011-04-28T09:09Z,"I'm looking for the uncensored version, but it's so many versions of this movie, so i'm a little confused. Is this the uncensored version?"
,Simon_p,2011-04-28T09:16Z,i mean if this version is not censored
