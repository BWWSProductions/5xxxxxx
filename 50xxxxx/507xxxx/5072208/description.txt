The 49th Star - Creating Alaska
(2006)

Fifty years ago, a dedicated group of Alaskans took their first major step toward self-government. THE 49TH STAR: CREATING ALASKA is an inspiring account of democracy in action, chronicling Alaskaâ€™s journey from Russian territory to America's largest state. Seventy-five days and nights of discussion, argument and passionate debate, along with creativity, compromise and consensus, produced a state constitution widely regarded as one of the best ever written. THE 49TH STAR weaves interviews with original convention delegates and staff, historians and Alaskan leaders to reveal the behind-the-scenes struggles for statehood.
