We Are Always Searching - I Am Ghost [2005]
	


We Are Always Searching is the debut EP by the post-hardcore band I Am Ghost, released by Epitaph Records in October 2005. A shorter, 6-track version of the EP was originally given out for free by the band.

Two songs were changed upon the release of their debut album Lovers' Requiem: the early versions of "Pretty People Never Lie, Vampires Never Really Die" and "We Are Always Searching". The bridge of the final version of "Pretty People Never Lie, Vampires Never Really Die" was altered with Kerith Telestai's vocals taking a main part.
The song "Lady Madeline in Her Coffin" is in reference to the short story by Edgar Allan Poe entitled "The Fall of the House of Usher"
