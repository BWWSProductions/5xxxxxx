Jerry and his siblings, Kelbo and Megan (Jerry revealed to the kids they have an aunt), need to retake the Wizard test that, in their teen years, determined who got to keep their powers. When Alex, Justin and Max see how competitive the contest gets, they realize the same test could eventually tear their family apart as well. Through the entire episode each one of them gets compared to a relative. Max to Kelbo, Alex to Megan, Justin to their dad, and Harper to their Mom. In the end Justin says Alex is nothing like Megan because she apologized and that's something Megan never learned to do.
