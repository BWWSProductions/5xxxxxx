,drjacko,2010-04-25T14:39Z,The game works. But where is the controller configuration?
,drjacko,2010-04-28T20:01Z,I couldn't find a way to change the controls and graphic settings. But the rest is OK. Can't say much about the game's content. I have hardly played. One thing that I can say is that I prefer the third-person-shooter of the first three HP games.
,PinkiTady,2010-05-07T21:57Z,"Used the first code, installation proceeded without problem. 
Here's the problem: I made a virtual drive, mounted the image, but when I wanna launch it tells me to put in the right CD/DVD and try again.

Anybody got any ideas? Most welcomed, dontcha know =D"
