Larkin threatens Frazer with a dossier marked 'Wolfman' and next day is murdered, seemingly by a wild animal, the legendary Beast of Midsomer. Frazer's drunkard son Nicky, another ex-spy ,is killed in identical fashion but Barnaby realizes that the 'Beast' is but a cover. The true murderer is seeking revenge for betrayal back in Berlin two decades earlier when they were involved with secrets and spies. Written by don @ minifie-1
