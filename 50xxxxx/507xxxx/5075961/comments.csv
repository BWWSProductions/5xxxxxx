Guess the mistake was made because IMDB is a bit confused as to what is the s12e03 for midsomer murders.
Here's a copy paste of the plot from wikipedia since it's a bit more extensive than the one on www.tv.com:
69	""The Black Book""	Nicholas Martin	Peter Smith	5 August 2009
A newly discovered masterpiece by landscape artist Henry Hogson causes a stir when it is auctioned for ÂŁ400,000 - just hours before its former owner is tortured and killed. When another Hogson is stolen, Barnaby decides to become an expert on the Midsomer painter, with the help of art teacher Matilda Simms (Susannah Harker). He soon realises the paintings are not what they seem ? but the death toll is rising.
So thanks Anonymous although the wrong plot summary made me wait until another one said it was ok.
Quality is great!"

,Tari1977,2012-06-01T09:30Z,"Just to clarify, IMDB and Wikipedia use:
Season 12, Episode 2: The Black Book
Season 12, Episode 3: Secrets and Spies"
