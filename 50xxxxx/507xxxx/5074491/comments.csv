These are the reasons why ppl pirate because these movies holloywood makes isnt even worth the toilet-paper i wipe my ass with! This and the new halloween are the 2 worst movies of this year so far! I hope that the actors directors and any indaviduals involved in the making of these are burned at a stake, so as to never tarnish my eyes with such crap movies ever again. I never bitch but seriously i wish these 2 movies were bannished from the film vaults and lock in a dungeon with Bin Ladin! GOD AWFUL PREDICTABLE JUNK AND AS BORING AS THEY COME! i give this film a -100 on all scales kill the ppl involved in the making!"

maybe it's your pc that's giving you problems.
a virus,worm, check your computer first for problems.
it's not TPB.
the only thing is that all torrents are showing 0'z for the last couple of days.
I hope this helps :)"
