how does this work online?GTA race maybe?"
,123king,2009-08-31T11:17Z,"It works in all GTA IV online modes. Free Mode, Race, GTA Race, etc."
,m0p13p,2009-08-31T13:12Z,"won't this get you banned from xbox live, because it's modded??"
,RaabHimself,2009-08-31T14:21Z,Does all this work for normal story mode ?
,Vader--,2009-08-31T17:10Z,"If Ms looks into your account for whatever reason, (Complaints ect.) and all 0's and 1's are not in the proper order your fracked , otherwise enjoy.   lol"
,m0p13p,2009-08-31T20:19Z,"@ Vader--, tnx for the info ;)"
,siwrath,2009-08-31T23:09Z,surly this game carries the same risk as any other xbox back up game playing on live
,qumahlin,2009-09-01T01:40Z,"""surly this game carries the same risk as any other xbox back up game playing on live""

No, it carries a much higher risk the CRC of this disk does not match any of the official CRC's"
,chuchunesme,2009-09-01T06:49Z,"It still passes stealth check but I'm not chancing playing it on line, just playing for fun."
,chuchunesme,2009-09-01T07:54Z,"Ok, confirmed a working game but it's UNPLAYABLE!!! Every single car goes so fast you can't control it at all. I tried to figure out a way to change the setting to slow them down but it doesn't work. Thanks for the effort though."
,ShineEyes,2009-09-01T18:39Z,"Sounds like a waste of a game to me.  Half those mods sound really fucking stupid...oh, and it's also not worth getting banned for playing a MODIFIED GAME WHICH THEY CAN EASILY CATCH."
,xflbret,2009-09-30T16:54Z,"THis downloaded for me (thank you by the way, so many people don't see so many torrents), but when I ran it through ABGX it warned me that live doesnt take kindly to modded games. So, I got concerned and didn't burn it. I'll vouch for the download completion though..."

,samljer,2010-03-05T20:43Z,"This game got my cousin banned for
""Modifications"", i was smart enough to NOT USE IT
and HE NEVER WENT ONLINE WITH IT!!!!!!!!!
they never gave more details.

he got complained about for trash talking in
modern warfare 2 ""LOLOL""

but the xbox keeps records, i wouldnt use this at all.

All people who mod should know that every game you put into your console has certain numbers recorded, which are put in a dbase when you go online next time.
ive actually SNIFFED this activity through a proxy."
