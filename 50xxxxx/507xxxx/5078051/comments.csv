,jpbonadio,2009-09-10T00:22Z,Thanks bricktop.
,Harutik_11,2009-09-19T07:09Z,"sorry, but its terrible quality compared to my original 720p rip"
,newguy69,2009-10-02T17:15Z,thanks bricktop. Good quality. Great Film.
,23cowhorn,2009-10-03T10:54Z,"I can't get this to play on the PS3.  Plays fine using WMP 11 with Vista Codec pack on my PC running Vista 64, but PS3 sees it as an unsupported file type when I try to stream it via my wired network connection.

I've also tried putting the .mt2s file on a USB drive to connect directly to the PS3, but the PS3 doesn't recognize the file on the USB drive. 

Anybody have any ideas?  PS3 firmware is 2.80.

Thanks for the up bricktop!"
,23cowhorn,2009-10-04T09:38Z,"Figured out how to navigate my USB drive on the PS3, and file plays great as is!  Great movie."
,MuSickFinder,2009-10-04T11:44Z,Why not make 720p rip if file size limitation is 4gb? Higher resolution with undersized bitrate kills detail. 720p with 5-6 mbits would look much better. Thanks anyway.
,duncanidahotpf,2009-10-06T23:28Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!!

Cox Com. in Phoenix blocked my internet and made me call them and delete this file...

I have been torrenting for YEARS downloading at least a terabyte worth of movies / games / music and NEVER have gotten caught.

This is the only .m2ts movie with that file extension that I have ever dled. And I get caught the next day."
,Harutik_11,2009-10-07T23:32Z,Am I the only one that thinks we need a PS3 	Shawshank Redemption Rip?

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6127451/Gladiator.2000.EXTENDED.REMASTERED.1080p.BluRay.x264-CHD"
[V],FiNEHD,2011-01-25T22:30Z,plus the bitrate on this one is way too low
,Sunilra,2011-04-05T15:05Z,"Ps3 Rockzzz

,skullknt,2011-04-21T07:57Z,Great movies brick! Enjoy everything from you. I would like to make a request for The Patriot Extended Cut. Not a demand...just a request :)
,Shiznaggles,2011-05-26T15:39Z,"I actually prefer the PS3-TEAM rips over a 4.7 gig 720p rip. Bitrate too low my ass. I can understand you wanting to push your 20 gigabyte (lol) 1080p rips, but that's just overkill bro."
