,ad123b,2009-08-29T03:56Z,is this an image of the legitimate retail version released today or is it just build 10A432 from a while ago re-posted?
,virgilaug,2009-08-29T04:14Z,"@ad123b

Yep. I would also like to know if this is the retail version released today. Unfortunately I dont know how that could be done since build 10A432 is the Goldmaster. I tried to see if SL 10A432 had an expiration time by setting the clock to 2011 and nothing happened so i guess 10A432 = Retail released today."
,hitekalex,2009-08-29T04:21Z,"""is this an image of the legitimate retail version released today or is it just build 10A432 from a while ago re-posted?""

@ad123b - the two are one and the same.  I don't know why people keep reposting this, as if somehow ""retail disk"" is miraculously different from 10a432."
,ad123b,2009-08-29T04:26Z,"@hitekalex-
I may be wrong, but i thought that there were certain things in the dev. preview version of 10A432 like certain preferences and plugins that were going to be added later to the retail version. Just wanted to double check if this is the absolute final release and not just the developer preview, because i believe there is a difference."

,Jack_Napier,2009-08-30T00:48Z,"!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!
The computer you are going to install Snow Leopard on MUST be setup with the GUID partitioning scheme. The external HDD can be anything as this is just booting for the install, but the actual drive in which you are installing Snow Leopard onto must be setup with the GUID partitioning scheme.



!! Instructions External HDD Method !!
Tested and Works

* On your external USB or Firewire HDD, create a 10GB Mac OS X Extended partition, format this partition and leave it blank. You will need this later on.


* Mount the .DMG file
* Using Disk Utility, Select the RESTORE Tab
* Right Click on the ""Mac OS X Install DVD"" and select it as the SOURCE
* Right Click on your USB/Firewire 10GB Partition and select it as DESTINAION
* Check off ""Erase Destination""
* Click Restore
* Wait for Restore to complete
* Once restore is complete, you will notice that your 10GB Partition name is called ""Mac OS X Install DVD""
* Unmount the Disk Image
* LEAVE THE USB/FIREWIRE DRIVE CONNECTED
* Restart your Mac and hold the Option Key to get the startup disk menu
* Select the External HDD, Labelled ""Mac OS X Install DVD""
* Booting from the External HDD works and it's fast!! Anytime you want to install Snow Leopard on any Intel Mac Computer, all you need to do is bring your External Drive, connect it, reboot and install."

To all. You do not need a DVD burner or External drive. You can partition your hard drive into two, using the Disk Utility in the Utilities folder in the Application folder. In the Help section, learn to create a 2nd 12 GB partition, without deleting the old of course. Then use ""Restore"" to this disk image as the source and the new partition as the destination. Restart booting from the new partition and install Snow Leopard. That's what I did. Worked fine."

I've had this copy installed for a week now and just noticed Software Update isn't working properly, it takes a long time to analyze if it needs to update and then does't come up with anything. And this is when I KNOW there are updates available. So it's be pretty cautious with this copy, at the same time it *could* be fine. 
In any case, I've done a trojan scan and came up with nothing. but who knows.. we need someone who's not biased and can really check this out. 
Until then, get a fucking life ""Crackin85""  "

Thanks for this great upload, works like a charm, installed from an external hd, 30 minutes later snow leopard was installed on my intel macbook. Nothing wrong with this, in this precise moment I'm downloading a few updates so no problems there neither. All my files and dozens of programs like adobe cs3, filemaker,merlin,transit,office 08, iwork 09,aperture, parallels still work with no issues.
Thanks a lot men.

Cheers from Tijuana, MĂŠxico!!!"

,doth3dew,2011-10-20T15:25Z,"WOW OK the majority of people downloading and trying to install this have no idea how MAC OS X works let alone are computer dumbasses. I work for Apple, I have worked for Apple for over 6 years and I use this image on a thumb drive, two external hard drives, created an image to distribute amongst my Mac Server and BURNED IT TO A DVD-R DL!

You are an even bigger idiot. If you are having issues with updates from mac or the operating system then you have other software related issues either from the install or you are one of the idiots trying to run this on a PC. To the guy who asked about LOGIN-KEYCHAIN WHENEVER YOU INSTALL SOFTWARE ESPECIALLY OPERATING SYSTEMS IT ASKS YOU FOR A PASSWORD BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE SYSTEM. HE DIDN'T MAGICALLY PUT A KEYLOGGER TO SPOOF KEYCHAINACCESS! Wow what will you people think of next. Fuck the majority of you are the retards I have to listen to every day because their computer won't boot up and they don't know where the power button is. If you don't know how to use DIsk Utility, boot up into single-user mode and run fsck to check for any system file corruption or do an inplace OS reinstall to fix various OS issues... HELL GO OUT AND BUY THE SNOW LEOPARD UPGRADE FOR $29.99 YOU POOR FUCKING RETARDS. Then I suggest you stop bitching and whining about something you know NOTHING ABOUT.

And to that mental retard bigquest who did a trojan scan... he would have to be a pretty fucking good coder to install a trojan into a MAC OS X Installer and have the ""trojan"" install into the entire Mac OS which has a unix kernel and all your data is SECURE is so many different ways. Idiots whining about a bad OS install and saying the tooth fairy let a Unicorn infect their computer but no it was the gnomes.

People this download is clean, I have it working in so many ways just to support a guy trying to help you guys out. You can purchase this upgrade from http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573Z/A but god forbid you spend $29.99 on software that you know will be virus and malware free but who knows MAYBE Bill Gates knew when he was going to die and installed a beyond the grave trojan putting his ghost in the machine! WOOOOOO idiots"
,doth3dew,2011-10-20T15:39Z,"Oh by the way thanks crack for uploading this, got a nasty scratch on my OEM disc and was unreadable this was perfect. Anyways I am willing to help people who are not self-righteous retards...

10.6 can only be installed on certain computers and certain models of MacBook computers. The system requirements are for:
Any Mac with an Intel Processor (if you have a PowerPC computer or PowerPC processor this will NOT WORK)
Minimum of 1GB of RAM
An optical drive that can read a dual-layer DVD
9 GB of hard drive space

If you try to install it on a PC because you have an Intel processor it's not that simple because Apple used only SELECT Intel processors that it will only install on without any modification to the actual installer or installing it another way. So if this doesn't work on your PC, it's not supposed to. If you are having any issues with the OS after the install take this into consideration:
Did you go to Disk utility - > Erase - > Reformat the disk and the reinstall Snow Leopard? Snow Leopard does an ""in-place"" install which installs ontop of Leopard. Leopard could be working just fine but something can get corrupted by upgrading. If you have any previous issues with the OS they will appear in Snow Leopard because you didn't reformat the drive and the problems get worse. If you do not have important data or if you have a Time Machine backup it is highly advised to erase your hard drive with Disk Utility (When installing click on the utilities menu option on the top of the screen then click on ""Disk Utility"" -> Click on the top hard drive not the volume and click on the ""Erase"" tab -> select OS X (extended journaled), name your volume and erase)."
,rubycanoe,2011-10-31T04:00Z,"How easy is it to install updates, or is there anything different I should be doing when I install them? I'm one of those computer morons, sorry guys."
,Bolerophon,2012-02-29T01:28Z,"I'm on a pc and have no acces to Disk Utility so i have to convert this dmg to iso with ultraiso. But i can't, when i select the file and try to start the conversion i get the error: Invalid or unknown image format.. WTF? I've done it before with the same sorta *.dmg file and it went ok. 

Anyone?"
