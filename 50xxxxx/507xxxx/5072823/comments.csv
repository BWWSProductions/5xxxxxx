,julesdr,2009-11-04T02:35Z,"Nvmd, Had to run as admin..."
,Gigatol,2009-11-23T02:48Z,"thank you so much, i spent a rediculous amount of time messing with the normal Photoshop CS4 garbage and i couldnt get it to install, still dont know why, but this worked perfectly"
,traxstar7,2010-02-19T05:33Z,"This is exactly the same as Photoshop CS4 Micro(precracked) [ kentuckykiid ]

Anyway, it works great."
,noonespecial5555,2010-05-27T22:33Z,"If nothing happens when you start it (in windows 7) try this:

1. Rightclick the exe and select compability mode with windows xp sp3.
2. Run it. It should work. Then close it.
3. Rightclick the exe and select compability mode with windows vista sp2.

It seems it does something on first run which needs XP compability mode. And the third step is to make it faster (which it is in vista mode)"
