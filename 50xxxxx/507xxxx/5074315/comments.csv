Please seed this."
,skankinjerk,2009-09-07T23:21Z,"please seed, this game kicks ass!!!"
,syndre,2009-09-08T21:27Z,"you have to use a blank dual layer dvd to burn this game, or just use a USB loader

I have written out a guide to getting this game to work with a USB loader, 
I uploaded the text file here: 
http://www.snapdrive.net/files/405430/metroid_prime_trilogy_guide.txt

good luck!"
,skankinjerk,2009-09-11T22:14Z,"none of the games will load?
can anyone relate or help me?"
,MarcusIronfist,2009-09-17T23:07Z,"syndre are you telling me i wasted my time burning it to a single layer disc yesterday?

Well, that explains why it freaks when I click to load MP 1 or MP 2..."
,MarcusIronfist,2009-09-17T23:07Z,"(I downloaded the torrent over a week ago, so I didn't see your comment before then...)"
,MarcusIronfist,2009-09-19T16:09Z,"I got it working...

Use the NeoGamma r8 backup loader (needs cIOS249 r14), and use the config option ""use alternate .dol"" set to ""disc"".

When you start the dvd, neogamma will ask you which .dol file to use.  There are separate loader .dol files on the disc for mp1, mp2, and mp3...  just select the file to play either mp1 or mp2 and it will go right into the game itself."
,skankinjerk,2009-09-21T23:03Z,"thanks alot marcusironfist!
i burned mine on a single layer dvd-r
and used ur method and got it to work
thanks again!"
,furtherdown,2009-10-25T13:00Z,"I burned it to a single-layer Verbatim DVD+R with ImgBurn as always.  I'm using D2PRO9 v2.3 and it didn't work.  Says that ""my Wii files are corrupted"" when I try to boot it.  I take out the disc and the Wii works again.  This is the first time a burnt Wii game hasn't worked for me and I have more than 30 games."
,cruden1106,2009-11-01T00:27Z,"Works perfectly, even when burned at maximum speed with imgburn. Thanks."
,Johnnystarship,2009-11-17T03:47Z,@MarcusIronfist Thanks for the tip. I was worried for a minute there. :) Works fine now.
,naztec,2009-12-06T20:56Z,"It didn't work for me 'cause it's not 4.7 GB, every time I try to load it my Wii shows me a black screen with an error."
,lilstroker2000,2009-12-19T00:12Z,The MarcusIronfist method works but I think that it automatically boots you into Veteran mode instead of the Normal difficulty mode. I assume this because that's what it shows when you boot to the normal menu. Can anyone confirm?
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-25T00:30Z,could someone please upload a pal version?
,danger83,2010-02-10T04:09Z,"The game loads, and every time I try to start either 1 or 2 on either difficulty it green screens and loads back to the Wii menu. Any suggestions? I'm using neogamma r8 b17 and this is the first game of many i've had a problem with."
,danger83,2010-02-10T04:16Z,"5 minutes later... after understanding what he meant, I did what marcus suggested and i'm now in the game. Not Ideal, but it works."
,Orel82,2010-02-10T14:38Z,"Please help, I can't get MarcusIronfist's way to work, I try it and whenever I pick a dol file it reboots the wii. I have cIOs 249 r14.."
,gamesplit,2010-06-27T01:11Z,please seed !!!!!!
,KoukisTheBest,2010-09-14T14:14Z,I burned at 2x with imgburn dvd-r it works until it says normal-veteran whatever i choose it loading and in some sec it shows me a green screen and return me at the WII menu.My wii is pal.Maybe this is the problem. I am using  R8 Beta 7 Ios249 Rev 14.I tried MarcusIronfist's method and again green screen:/
,ShinSonJazrin,2010-12-17T02:31Z,So how can it still be called a Trilogy with only TWO games?
,goldcaps,2011-02-16T02:43Z,"MarcusIronfist's method works, but since it boots directly into the game, you're not able to create a save file, so I'm not sure how saving is going to work, if it even will work.

I guess you could play this on a USB loader, but I haven't tried it yet."
,goldcaps,2011-02-16T04:14Z,"My bad.

..you can load the main.dol, create a save file, reboot the wii and when you use MarcusIronFist's method and reach the save file later in the game, it will save and you can go back to it each time you boot the alternate .dol file.

But to clarify, it DOES boot you into Veteran Mode automatically. So hopefully you're good at Metroid. :3

Sorry for the double posting."
