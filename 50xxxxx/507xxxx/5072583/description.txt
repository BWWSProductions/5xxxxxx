In war-torn planets of tomorrow, the most important struggle of humanity is about to begin. With its frontier colonies destroyed as a result of a growing insurrection, Earth sends the 8th Army Infantry (nicknamed Section 8), an elite commando with the task of repelling the slaughter ever closer. The nickname refers to an old U.S. military regulation in which a soldier would be relieved of their duties for being mentally unfit for service. 
Almost suicidal missions for which it is offered the 8th Infantry Navy puts the eyes of other units as a division made up of men mentally disturbed. Section 8 is depliega "burning" from their spacecraft's orbital launch thousands of feet of the battlefield, using the most advanced combat arsenal that military technology is capable of providing.
