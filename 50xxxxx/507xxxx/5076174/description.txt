NOTE: A big THANK YOU to the tapers that shared these recordings. The only thing I've done is convert these files to mp3 format  (320 KB, 44100 KZ, Stereo) so the quality varies based on the recording's source. If you like these performances. please pass them freely along to anyone else you think might enjoy them. I encourage you to seek out the uncompressed (.flac & .shin) concerts these are from and go see these musicians perform, if they come to your neighborhood.
