Intended to complement the material typically taught in high school biology and introductory college biology courses, "Encyclopedia of Life Science" is a new, two-volume reference set that reflects the fundamental concepts and principles identified by the National Committee on Science Education Standards. More than 200 comprehensive entries are arranged by topic or theme and cover concepts, theories, sub-disciplines, biographies, common methods, and techniques relevant to modern science. 

The definitive reference in the area of life science, this accessible full-color resource provides historical perspectives, portrays science as a human endeavor, and gives insight into the process of scientific inquiry by incorporating biographical profiles of people who have contributed significantly to the development of the life sciences. Processes that shape the natural world and life within it are also discussed in this in-depth encyclopedia. 

Instruments and methodology-related entries focus on the tools and procedures used by scientists to gather information, conduct experiments, and perform analyses. Other entries summarize the major branches and sub-disciplines of life science and describe selected applications of the information and technology gleaned from life science research.
