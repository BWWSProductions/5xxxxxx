***INSTALL TIPS***

BE SURE TO UNINSTALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF FRIEND BLASTER PRO. ALSO REMOVE REGISTRY ENTRIES JUST TO ENSURE A CLEAN INSTALL!

Simply install friendblasterpro_v10_6_4.exe and once installed copy and past the cracked friendblasterpro.exe over the existing one located in C:Program FilesFriendBlasterPro

If you happen to get the message saying that you can not add yourself as a friend, simply go to that part of Gather ID's and delete the first ID in the list. This should fix the problem.

ALWAYS scan your torrents before ever installing them! Even though I scan them before posting, not everyone is as kind! You can never be too safe!


ENJOY!
