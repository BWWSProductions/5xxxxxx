,LoonyJ,2009-09-24T21:36Z,"Does anyone have the patch that will prevent FBP from the automatic update? I have had FBP for quite some time now, and at one point, I needed an update, but no one had up'd it yet. FBP started popping up a window saying that I needed to update, and would not let me use the program until I did so. I used to have a patch that took care of that, but I no longer have it. Can anyone help?"
,sweettongued1,2009-10-05T00:32Z,Can you explain to me how to delete old versions of this in detail?  It won't let me delete the files from my programs list after uninstall.
,Kouartise,2009-10-22T16:41Z,"Download/patching etc is perfect, craked with no problems at all.
But, the program doesn't seem to be working as the previous versions. It jumps a lot, skips a few profiles and adds people very slowly even with the time delay set between a 0 - 0 seconds duration.
I keep having to press the 'forward' button located at the top next to the address bar to 'remind' it (if you will) to proceed to the next add/profile.
Since they have altered and modified the captcha bypass images/settings, the program never makes a 'blip' noise to indicate that the captcha is required for that add. I just guessed that around 12-15 adds, it shall require this implementation.
It used to be an efficient and quick program. Now it just seems slow, sloppy and somewhat defected.
Have i done something incorrectly? Suggestions?
Thanks for uploading though. Much appreciated."
,Kouartise,2009-10-22T16:51Z,"Additionally, could this be something to do with the version? According to the official website, the latest is v10.6.8.
Could someone crack the latest version? Might rectify some problems."
,Kouartise,2009-10-22T17:03Z,Correction *v10.7.1
,pieszbob1,2009-10-31T05:10Z,I have the latest version cracked...just not at home right now to upload it.  Check back Saturday/Sunday!
,T-D-D,2009-11-02T02:40Z,Have you had a chance to upload 10.7.1 yet? THANKS!
,pieszbob1,2009-11-03T15:50Z,"Just Uploaded 10.7.3.
