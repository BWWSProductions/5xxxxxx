The Prisoner is a 17-episode British television series broadcast in the UK from 29 September 1967 to 1 February 1968.

Starring and co-created by Patrick McGoohan, it combined spy fiction with elements of science fiction, allegory, and psychological drama.


The series follows a British former secret agent who is held prisoner in a mysterious seaside village where his captors try to find out why he abruptly resigned from his job. Although sold as a thriller in the mould of McGoohan's previous series, Danger Man (called Secret Agent in its U.S. release), the show's combination of 1960s countercultural themes and surreal setting had a far-reaching effect on science fiction/fantasy programming, and on popular culture in general.


A TV mini-series remake is slated to air on AMC in 2009, and Christopher Nolan has been widely reported to be considering a film version.
