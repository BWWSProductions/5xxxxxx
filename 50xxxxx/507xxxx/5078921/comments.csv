,DaFlak,2009-11-17T05:41Z,This will be seriously seeded. Just watched the 2009 version which just left me wanting the original that much more. Thanks!
,4365nokb6,2009-11-17T09:47Z,thank you
,bertrandb,2009-11-21T08:19Z,I see a big white balloon in my future.
,NickIkon,2009-12-22T17:02Z,"Thank you so much for this torrent! I'm 6 episodes in and it is SO good! For the first bit it has that Cowboy Bebop style where despite all of his Clint Eastwood-style badassery (and Patrick McGoohan is great at this), he can never quite win. Great series with a great plot and twists that keep you guessing."
,cmdrkeen86,2010-01-08T04:04Z,What are the audio and video codecs for the files?  I different torrent that I got (quite quickly too for torrent) they were encoded with DX50 with mono audio and VLC crashes.
,cmdrkeen86,2010-01-08T04:05Z,"Nevermind, this is the exact same one I downloaded.  Same upload as a different one with the same tech specs for the codecs."
,OT1972,2010-04-26T00:18Z,"Thanks for adding this. People, be patient. You are getting this for free. If you can't wait... buy it..."
,Exogenesis,2010-05-15T00:02Z,One of the greatest TV Series ever
,bbbbbs,2010-06-11T22:25Z,"Thanks for that ..

Quite mediocre quality though, was captured from a tape (as it looks)

Is there a DVD version?
I'd buy it (and so should you) :)"
,bbbbbs,2010-07-09T19:54Z,"I have to correct myself!nOnly episode one seems to come off a VHS tape, the rest is actually off DVD and good quality!"
,declan66,2010-08-04T16:05Z,"Sheila, take a bow!"

,Herkimer,2011-01-25T21:05Z,"Me and my old man watched this back in the 70's for a summer in Canada. I thought it was pretty cool, then caught it again in the 80's as a kid in University taking a film class. Very avant guarde!

Now, sitting down on a Saturday evening, blazing away, it's pretty cool TV, even for today. A real classic.

Much better than say, my old reminicing about the Man from Atlantis or the 6 Million Doll-hair Man. Even Miami Vice doesn't hold up. Dreck.

Herk."
,AJNorth,2011-10-28T11:10Z,"From the remarkable and fertile mind of Patrick McGoohan, who created & produced the series, as well as writing and directing most of episodes (some under pseudonyms) -- not to mention starring in them. (His major in school: mathematics.) We will not see his likes again."
,AJNorth,2011-10-28T13:05Z,Almost forgot to add special mention of the sensational Main Title / End Credits music by Australian composer Ron Grainer (and the surrealistic and whimsical illustrations during the End Credits).
,pelph,2011-11-07T11:17Z,This is a direct copy of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3565524/The_Prisoner
,sickboy_xl,2012-03-11T05:24Z,"@AJNorth: I agree. The genius of Patrick McGoohan was accentuated by the brilliant score by Ron Grainer (also famous for the score and Main Theme of the original Dr. Who? series). As for the Opening, Closing titles sequences, there is nothing of it's kind quite as compelling and intriguing."
