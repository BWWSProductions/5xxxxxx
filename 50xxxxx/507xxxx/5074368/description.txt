Sin City was released as a full-length feature film in April of 2005. Directed by Robert Rodriguez it is a film adaptation of The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard. The film duplicates with uncanny accuracy the look of the original stories, right down to the use of black and white with color highlights. In fact, Rodriguez lists Miller as co-director, since he worked so closely with the original comics, treating them as his story boards. In addition, Rodriguez has stated he intend to film all of the Sin City stories. At the time of this writing, Rodriguez is working on Sin City II, which is due out in 2009, and looks to follow the plot of A Dame To Kill For.
