,evr,2009-10-13T13:00Z,"RecycleBin32: It seems to be all the albums, so (imo) it's a complete discography.

I don't really care much for b-sides, eps, singles, live recordings, etc."
,smurfy216,2009-11-01T22:15Z,Thanx mate but this isnt there full.. I found about another 10 albums that isnt here which arnt Live.
,Olumvolum,2009-11-03T23:23Z,"This is the complete discography of their studio albums. I haven't included lives, EPs, compilation etc. The reason I didn't include this is because you would've had a lot of duplicates if I did.

The 14 albums listed in the info box is all the studio albums. If there's some albums I've forgot, please telle meg, 'cause I think you'd be wrong ;)"
,xSHINKx,2009-11-15T10:18Z,"For some reason with uTorrent when I try to open this torrent file to start the download, it says it's an invalid file.  Any idea why or what I can do?"
,Admz,2009-12-21T00:31Z,"Popping noises present in many of the songs, very annoying. I recommend a different discography or downloading the albums seperately. Thanks anyway uploader."
