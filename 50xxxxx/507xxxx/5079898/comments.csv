,samebandit,2009-10-03T02:32Z,"Let me be another member to congratulate you on a great upload here... well done lp2k9!!!

I tried 8, didn't like it. Not sure about 9, but something many may not know is when burning Audio CDs with Nero7, it retains all the information of track title & artists, which Nero8 did not. CD should show up with all the info as it would w/ a retail cd, but showed up instead as ""unknown track"" or title. 

So big thanks. I lost my copy, this will do nicely. THANKS AGAIN!"

[T],FatFreddy69,2010-06-14T04:33Z,"Thx a lot. I hope the dts decoder is in it, I need it for eac3 to encode those huge blue-ray DTS tracks (3-5 GB) down to 768 KB/s Dts. I downloaded the Nero 10 Multimedia Suite RETAIL + Keyz torrent but it wasn't good. cheers.

,spursxspurs,2010-08-09T23:45Z,"Nero 7 is great that I agree, I lost my copy due to a virus, Just D/L this and Avast reports that there is a virus/Trojan hidden with the Keygen once you un-pack the RAR file. GUTTED cos I really wanted this one to be a good one :("
,mojobaby27,2010-08-23T03:30Z,"great torrent thanks lp2k9

works no prob."
,vivatpb5776,2010-10-16T08:35Z,"To spursxspurs (and all who view this): Antivirus software commonly report keygens as viruses. That being said, I have SAS (SuperAntiSpyware) with the latest  definitions and all was clean for me. I will comment on the torrent itself shortly."
,vivatpb5776,2010-10-16T09:25Z,"The installation was flawless. I only want Nero 7 for Wave Editor. I disabled all other applications and installed the editor. I used the Nero 7 Ultimate key. lp2k9, thank you. Much appreciated."
