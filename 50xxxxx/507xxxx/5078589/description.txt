Texas Moon contains every song that Tommy Duncan recorded for Capitol Records in 1949, including the Top 10 hit "Gambling Polka Dot Blues," as well as his lone single on Natural, his first two sessions for Intro, and two singles that his brother Glynn recorded with Tommy's band, the Western All-Stars. Much of this material is in the vein of Duncan's classic work with Bob Wills, though the quality of the music is slightly inconsistent. Nevertheless, Texas Moon and its companion volume Beneath a Neon Star in a Honk Tonk, are necessary for hardcore collectors of western swing in general and Duncan in particular.
