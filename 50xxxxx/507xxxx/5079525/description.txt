"Soul Bird" is great from start to finish so it's hard to choose highlights. There are the irresistible grooves of "Tin Tin Deo" and the curiously titled "Whiffenpoof Song". The former is a different arrangement of Dizzy's original. Tjader originals "Daddy Wong Legs" and "Soul Motion" will get your fingers snapping too. An additional Tjader original, the straight ahead jazz of "The Prophet" shows just how much Tjader could swing. Finally, the exquisite mid tempo "Reza" will put you in a romantic mood. Discover the other gems with open ears. Like other geniuses, Cal Tjader made the very difficult appear easy. Composing, arranging and interpreting at a very high level throughout his legendary career, Tjader is a true one of a kind. Accompanied by his usual cast of stellar musicians including Johnny Rae, Armando Peraza and Terry Hilliard, this record only gets better with listening. Long Live Cal Tjader! ~ James W. Goetsch
