,ryaneli,2009-11-17T18:41Z,"The only talent on this track is M&M. What has rap come to? sounds like something I'd hear on the radio.

Thanks Emin3m for keeping rap alive!!

somebody edit this song so its only eminem please. I'm sure I won't be the only one appreciating the effort. 

Thanks for the Up. I've never heard Em rap like this."
,nielsjj,2009-11-30T09:52Z,"haha, it's said that eminem even disses the other 3 IN THEIR OWN TRACK. I think that's genial :)
I defenitly like lil wayne and kanye west, but I hate lil wayne when he raps like this (which he does way too much lately...). can't even call it rapping."

I love his line ""understand nothing was done for me"".  The douchebag was on Degrassi, a super lame Canadian teen drama."
