A Place to Bury Strangers - Exploding Head [2009] [Dodecahedron]


A Place to Bury Strangers is a New Yorkâ€“based indie rock band composed of Oliver Ackermann (guitar/vocals), Jono MOFO (bass) and Jay Space (drums).  The band plays a heavy, atmospheric wall of sound-influenced blend of  
psychedelic rock, shoegaze and space rock. The band is commonly known by  the initials APTBS.

A Place to Bury Strangers has been affectionately lauded as New York  City's "loudest band" by various indie reviewers and bloggers throughout  the course of their live music career, as well as "the most  ear-shatteringly loud garage/shoegaze band you'll ever hear" by The  Washington Post. The New York Times applauded their revival of "the  ominous, feedback-drenched drones of the 1980s.

In August 2007 the band suddenly gained national attention after a  favorable Pitchfork review of their debut release A Place to Bury  Strangers on the Killer Pimp label.

In early 2009 APTBS signed to Mute Records. The band also announced  another European Tour and appearances at the Coachella Valley Music and  Arts Festival and Siren Music Festival.
