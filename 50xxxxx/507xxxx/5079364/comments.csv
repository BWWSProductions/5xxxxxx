,Jooooona,2009-11-16T15:20Z,Can you upload band hero plz?
,jragnar,2009-11-19T13:54Z,"You don`t need an expensive dual layer disc to burn this game. Because when you use magic iso or isobuster to convert those mdf files, the iso-file was compressed to around 4 Gb. Maybe with a little less good quality.....but hey....it`s worth it."
,RecycleBin32,2009-12-13T08:54Z,"hey..can u help me please.??

remove every ""_"" and put . into (dot)

Link for dvd5 ripkit by drakia =)"
,fanapathy,2009-12-28T20:33Z,"I use swapmagic. I used isobuster to create iso for dvd5. Works fine, except; only 50% of the songs have sound.
The dvd5 ntsc on this site doesn't work either.
Drakia's ripkit didn't work on, dvd doesn't boot.
Thoughts are welcome"
,NobiteR,2010-04-10T16:38Z,merci beaucoup ^^

,00101010,2010-10-03T20:58Z,"3.86 GB?  Can you not build to DVD-5?
I'll do that if I have time.  It's so easy, why up a DVD-9 that so many people cant' or won't use?"
,wendigoproxy,2011-04-14T21:01Z,"gamerguuy, your torrent is bullshit. Your .mdf file mounts and opens up into more files rather then playing. When trying to burn it to a disk, it's too large for the disk. The main .wad file doesn't open with anything existing. You are an epic failure, stop posting bullshit torrents please."
,wendigoproxy,2011-04-14T21:05Z,Instructions might have been helpful ass hole.
