- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   "Bay of Pigs" is the longest of Destroyer songs, and Destroyer's first foray
   into ambient disco. The song was recorded throughout the winter of 2009 with
   Destroyer collaborators/members John Collins and David Carswell at JCDC
   Studio in Vancouver. "Bay of Pigs" is an account of the 1961 American
   invasion of Cuba. The music for "Ravers" was played entirely on analogue
   synthesizer, and recorded in April 2009. It explores some of the more
   meditative realms of 20th Century classical composition. The song is a casual
   rumination on parties, political parties, madness and suffering (for one's
   art).
