If I had it would be posted. Besides, the program sucks so look for something else."

Most audio/video converters can also resize files. A good and small converter is Total Video Converter: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5030170/EffectMatrix_Total_Video_Converter_3.50.9.729___Patch_[RH]

Take some time and look for what you need by using Google or so. There are many good converters, but I can't make a choice for anyone about software."
,ManixP,2009-09-08T14:29Z,"Thank you very much RH! Good job on this, perfectly working and 100% without virus ;-)

If I can make a request, I would ask for FixTunes software to be cracked! It's by far the best MP3 automatic tagging software that collects informations over the internet to find the most matching tags. However, the cracked version on the internet is a old one and it doesn't update anymore(update information, so it's useless) and I would love to have the new version(and I'm far from being the only one!).

However, I know that I'm asking a lot since it looks like a software mostly complicated to crack, I guess that it's mainly because of the internet used to make software to work.... Anyway, if you feel like taking a big challenge, take this one please ;-)

Thanks again! "
[V],big_dad_e,2009-09-09T07:46Z,"Downloaded, installed, runs great, clean, (of course), and it's a nice little utility.

If YOU put some booty on the table I'm sure Pirates would be happy to accommodate your requests, until then you're just another leecher. "

Which version do you have and which version are you looking for?"
,ManixP,2009-09-12T20:13Z,"I don't have it anymore since it was useless without updates, but I had version 4.6. Now I need version 4.82(Without iTunes) or version 5.4(With iTunes)! If you could do this for me and the others, you'd be a god! xD"

The website installer of FixTunes v4.82 (Non-iTunes Version) is detected by Norton as a virus (Trojan Horse): http://www.fixtunes.com/
Before posting it (incl. a crack) I'll do some further research first.

So far the website installer of FixTunes v4.82 (Non-iTunes Version) seems to be ok, 
even though Norton detects the installer as a virus (Trojan Horse):
