               Security Task Manager v1.6f incl. Spy Protector + Key
 


Security Task Manager shows comprehensible information about programs & processes 
running on the computer (applications, DLLs, BHOs, and services).  

For each process, it improves on Windows Task Manager, it's providing a security 
risk rating, a process description, file path, CPU usage graph, start time, 
embedded hidden functions (for example keyboard monitoring, autostart entry, and 
browser supervision or manipulation), and process type, such as visible window, 
systray program, DLL, and IE plug-in. 

The security risk rating indicates the likelihood of the process being potential 
spyware, malware, a Trojan, or keylogger.

The Security Task Manager detects unknown malware and rootkits hidden from your 
antivirus software.

It also deletes traces of your Internet and computer activity, prevents keyboard 
input monitoring, and warns you when the registry is changed. This process viewer 
also recognizes stealth processes and virtual driver software hidden from the 
Windows Task Manager.



Some features of Security Task Manager:

- Unique security risk rating 
- The security risk rating indicates the likelihood of a process being potential 
  spyware, malware or a Trojan. The rating is purely based on behaviour and code 
  analysis, and does not use any signature files. 
- Full directory path and file name 
- Process description 
- CPU usage graph 
- Embedded hidden functions (e.g. keyboard monitoring, browser supervision or 
  manipulation) 
- Process type (e.g. visible window, systray program, DLL, IE-plugin, startup 
  service) 
 


* The full version of Security Task Manager also contains SpyProtector for 
  protecting your computer and Internet privacy:

- Prevents keyboard and mouse monitoring 
That stops keylogger or other hacker tools

- Warns when registry is changed 
That protects you from Trojans that surreptitiously add an autostart key

- Eliminates the traces of your internet activity 
e.g. cookies, cache, history, typed URLs and temporary files

- Eliminates the traces of your work on computer 
e.g. recent used file list of programs (Word, ACDSee, PDF, WinZip, Media player)



System requirements:

- Windows Vista, XP, 2000, 2003, NT, ME, 95, 98 
- On Windows Vista, program's help file needs Microsoft WinHlp32 
- 2 MB free disk space

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of 
    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting 
    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz
    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!
  
08- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

10- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by 
   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
