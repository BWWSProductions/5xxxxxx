Battle At Kruger: Caught On Safari
(2007)

In the Spring of 2007 what would become one ofhottest videos was posted, â€˜The Battle at Krugerâ€™. The clip, seen 35 million times and counting, captures an amazing predator encounter as lions and a crocodile fight over a buffalo calf in South Africaâ€™s Kruger National Park. 

The dramatic eight-minute clip that enthralled the world was filmed by an amateur whilst on safari. Itâ€™s the type of encounter that National Geographic filmmakers spend years trying to capture, with unexpected twists and turns of nature. In Autumn 2004, David Budzinski, a supply manager working for Chevron on a safari in Kruger National Park with friend Jason Schlosberg, filmed what could be some of the wildest footage ever seen. We take the men back to Kruger to recount the attack they witnessed. 

A herd of buffalo slowly graze unknowingly into the sites of crouching lions. Suddenly, the lead buffalo freezes, aware of danger, and quickly spins around in retreat. The pride of lions unleash a three-pronged attack against the buffalo and a young calf is tackled, plunging both lion and buffalo calf into the water. Just when it looks as though the lions will easily devour the calf, a 270-kilogram crocodile erupts from the water and sinks his teeth into their prey, pitting predator against predator in a grisly tug-of-war. The lions tear the calf away, nearly ensuring victory, until a vengeful buffalo herd unites for a final showdown to reclaim its own. 

Enlisting the help of wildlife experts, we take a closer look at this battle, revealing how lions and crocodiles hunt and how buffalos may survive â€“ against all odds.
