First its the saving issue this solved by downloading http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5077443
Second its the glide problem.No Glide in this release.
Take it or leave it."
,_Metal_Guitar_,2009-09-03T17:04Z,"Will the glide problem be fixed with a future crack?

Thanks for the upload Groo, been waiting like a year for this game! :)"
,Rick78,2009-09-03T18:28Z,"Thanks for this one m8 

il download and wait for the crack :)"
,_beta_,2009-09-03T18:50Z,"If you want to enable Physx download the ""Demo with Physx"", copy ""BmLauncher.exe"" from the demo install directory to the full game install directory and run it... Physx settings will now show at the bottom... setting High recommends using a 9800gtx+ for dedicated Physx... ran fine on my GTX280 1920x1200"
,Groo_The_Wanderer,2009-09-03T19:29Z,"Another way to turn on physx as the ingame menu option isnt there simply go to my documents and settings/eidos/batman etc and
find the files:
BmEngine.ini & UserEngine.ini with notepad and search for: PhysXLevel=0
Change that to either a 1 or 2 & save. (1=low 2=high ) "
[T],Knaster,2009-09-03T20:58Z,"You can also fix the Glide/run issue. 

Find the BaseInput.ini file right click it and in properties remove write protection press apply.

In the file find the word ""SpaceBar"" and change it to the key of your choosing i chosed ""RightShift"" (notice the big letter of the word.) 

Then save the file and close, now  right click it again and in properties reapply write protection.

Now in the game the glide issue is solved VOILA!!!
"
[T],Knaster,2009-09-03T21:03Z,btw the save issue should be helped if you have windows LIVE! installed as from games like GTAVI
,StefanGavrila,2009-09-03T21:23Z,"Eidos must have spent a lot of money on the security for this game and you can just bypass it by editing a file. ROFL.

Will finish the download soon and see if this works."

[T],Knaster,2009-09-03T22:51Z,"I get an CTD after the first ""boss"" that Joker releases. I encounter 2 goons thats talking and bam CTD. Always at that point :("
[T],Knaster,2009-09-03T23:26Z,"Solved it, had to turn off physX. (thx Swebarb)"
,franky98,2009-09-04T00:40Z,"Just to be clear, this works right? "
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-09-04T02:11Z,"Franky, the game fully works.
After installing, use this crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5077443
To fix the gliding do this: 
Find the BaseInput.ini file right click it and in properties remove write protection press apply.

,_Metal_Guitar_,2009-09-04T09:25Z,Does anyone know if the physx crashes are beacuse of the game or the crack?
,StefanGavrila,2009-09-04T11:45Z,"I think the game has another ""security point"" in the second Scarecrow level. When I reach the small tower with the 2 spinning wheels on it a grappling gun target should appear so I can get to the top, but it doesn't. Does anyone else have this problem?"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2009-09-04T15:29Z,"Stefan look for a walkthrough, I haven't reached that yet (I'd help you), but I'm busy playing Crysis Warhead :)"
[T],Knaster,2009-09-04T17:56Z,StefanGavrila doesnt sound like the second scarecrow level at all. So dont know what you're talking about.

Doesn't work, Batman dies if goes there. "
[T],Knaster,2009-09-05T17:58Z,Ub3rdude lol well ppl trusting walkthroughs and not themselves sometimes end up not seei9ng the true path. 
,AznBoy222,2009-09-05T19:13Z,"I can't seem to get the glide to work. I dechecked the write protection on BaseInput.ini, then changed ""SpaceBar"". Then i put the write protection back on. I went in the game and i still couldn't glide. Any help on this. BTW I use Vista."

[T],Knaster,2009-09-06T14:36Z,AznBoy222 its the crack thtas wrong try another and the glide will work. It happened to me too cant remember which crack that ws correct though. Sorry. Just try another crack.
[T],Knaster,2009-09-06T14:37Z,you still need to change the baseinput.ini like you did. 
,Italiano83,2009-09-08T04:11Z,"Everyone with the Second Scarecrow level Gripling issue.. i did what budakrist wrote.. the gravity method.. beleive me its very hard to control batman in air.. with gravity but after 40 minutes of trying.. i actually could get close enough to the other side.. and the checkpoint sign started to load.. then i just click restart from checkpoint and i was already in the other side.. and was able to finish the level.. with no problems.. ive not being playing longer through the game so i dont know if later i will find antoher problem.. but so far.. ive passed that second scarecrow level..

Quoted from Budakrist:
Gravity Method:

Go into the \BmGame\Config\DefaultGame.ini file, right click it and go to properties then unchek the read only option.. now go inside the file and change the gravity from -1000.0 to something like -50.0 gonna take a lot of tries, It's very hard to control batman when floating but it does work..(after you passed that part. remember to put the gravity back as it was..)

PD. If anybody needs a more detailed way of how I did it to cross over that part.. feel free to email me.. at ilragazzo83@hotmail.com.. I will try to help you the most I can.."
,Arkyfox,2009-09-09T21:49Z,"
If your having trouble in the game with grapple or anything in general. There is a trainer on Gamecopyworld that will let you use the number pad to move on the X Y and Z axis.

Here is the link http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2009&f=Batman_Arkham_Asylum_V1.0_Plus_4_Trainer_By_KelSat!rar

Enjoy ^_^"
,aapb,2009-09-10T00:04Z,"@Arkyfox i've tried that trainer and i CRASH coz of some shitty xlive protection shit, im stuck 15% in the game at the mansion of akrham.. i also got stuck at 9% before that and had to redo it.

if any1 got a save at 15% or close, or know why my game crashes everytime i use Kelsats trainer that b great "
,Arkyfox,2009-09-10T01:40Z,"@aapb

Run the trainer as administrator. Make sure your running with the ORIGINAL game's BmStartApp.exe

Don't use any function of the trainer until you are in the game and at what you need to bypass. Then quickly Bypass the object or wall. then alt tab and close the trainer. Then rush rush to a checkpoint ^^; I've made it 60% through the game using this trick and trainer."

And i did all this:
