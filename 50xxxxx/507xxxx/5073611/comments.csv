There is currently an uploader providing the file in 0.6KB bursts every couple minutes or so, and I did finish downloading the Ryu mix with the rest still going. I'm rather bummed now upon finding the entire album is in 128kbps bit rate, a download which I already had. That being said, the album scans are not easily available elsewhere and are hi-res."
