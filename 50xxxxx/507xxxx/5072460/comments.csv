,LFC_SL,2009-08-29T15:45Z,"Why are you guys wasting DL-DVD,
you can burn(mount) the image onto a external Hard drive,
roughly need 8/9GB,

its quick and easy,
use disk ultility,
click on restore,
point to the snow leopard image,
then in the 2nd box point to which external drive you want to mount onto,
and click erase and restore,
once done shut down your mac,

hold 'ALT'
at the boot option click on snow leopard your external hard drive,
and install..."

,SpudsBM,2009-09-08T23:57Z,do you have to use an external drive or cd?
,DRWAM,2009-09-09T16:20Z,"You can partition your hard drive into two, using the Disk Utility in the Utilities folder in the Application folder. In the Help section, learn to create a 2nd 12 GB partition, without deleting the old of course. Then use ""Restore"" to this disk image as the source and the new partition as the destination. Restart booting from the new partition and install Snow Leopard. That's what I did. Worked fine. No need to buy an external drive or blank DL DVD."
,SpudsBM,2009-09-19T00:13Z,"ok i trye psrtition for a week now but its not working, looks like im buying a dl dvd"
