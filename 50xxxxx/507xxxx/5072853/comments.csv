,xybersurfer,2010-10-24T23:54Z,"good upload but something is wrong with this song:
""Matrix Reloaded"" Suite - Don Davis

it's only 10 seconds! (the file size is really small too) and it's listed everywhere else as 17min+ (i have re-checked my download and it still says ""finished"")"
,PartyNerd,2011-04-07T22:34Z,Top speed! Thanks!

IF you are in the hand of the ""original"" WAV files and you did the encoding work  - I have to call you a dumb ass. They are all TRASH 


If this is a collection of the tracks picked up from the Inet  - I call you a dumb ass coz you do not know how to filter quality work- they are all TRASH (even a 128 can sound fine but your doesnt on 187 - 220)



NOT WORTH SHARING
NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING"
