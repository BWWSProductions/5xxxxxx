,SnowBob,2010-01-08T14:16Z,"Howdy people. First of all, I may assume that these lectures were shared only for good reasons. But after downloading them (I'd like to underline ? after downloading 11 Gb!!!), I found out that your videos had weird formats that are not supported by any of the media players I use. i'm just shocked "
,captanJ,2010-01-15T18:44Z,"SnowBob, I have the same problem. The files may be damaged or viruses affected. Could you please, mr Anonymous uploader, check your videos. Hope you understand that such kind of joke is not funny at all as we waste our time and traffic!"
