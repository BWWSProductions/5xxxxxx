200-ton rocks are hauled across vast distances to build colossal monuments.

Gothic cathedrals are secretly encoded with information by Knights Templars.

Mysterious crop circles that microscopically alter plants, water and soil.

What secret technology lies behind these sacred spaces?

And for what purpose?

This exhilarating documentary leads you through the spiritual technology of the ancients, and how its application in sacred spaces, temples, and Gothic cathedrals has influenced humanityâ€™s states of awareness for millennia.

With breathtaking sites filmed across the British Isles, you will be led on a 8000-year journey into a practical magic whose principles are alive - a legacy for our times, when all systems of understanding, structure and environment lie in a state of transformation and upheaval.

Including the human body.
