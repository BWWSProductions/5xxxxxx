I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

*** PLEASE NOTE - I CAN ONLY SEED OVERNIGHT (USA EASTERN TIME - AFTER MIDNIGHT) - REGARDLESS OF WHAT TIME I UP'D THE TORRENT - PLEASE BE PATIENT - I WILL ALWAYS SEED UNTIL COMPLETED BY 25-50 PEOPLE ***

just an FYI - this is a multi-tracker torrent and the total seed/leech numbers noted on TPB are not accurate - open in your bit torrent client to see 'real' numbers - enjoy brothers & sisters "

,l214l,2010-06-27T08:49Z,"G'day smb, another wonderful up, thanks.  Either through your offerings, or other torrents, I've found there are excellent photographers who ""shoot"" bands.

The images attached to this torrent are very enjoyable.  I've logged into Dino Perrucci's photography, his name is watermarked into the images here.  After a quick look, I'll check his site out better later on."
[V],smbdownload,2010-06-27T22:51Z,hey elvis - I have no idea what happened with that torrent - it just disappeared from my torrent list on TPB - it showed complete on my end [in uTorrent] with over 50 complete downloads - I'll reup it later this week ?????
,l214l,2010-07-27T09:13Z,Just a test to see if comments still working - weren't yesterday?
,l214l,2010-09-25T02:17Z,"Hello smb, hope you are well?  Is it any chance you'll do torrents here again, or if you've moved to another site, could you let us know where to?
Thanks for your contributions, from l214l"
