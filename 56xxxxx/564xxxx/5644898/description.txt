Arnej - The Strings That Bind Us

************************************************************************


Fallacy was  reigning supreme when Arnej made  up the first notes of his 
new  A State of Trance release.  There's no way around it.  'The Strings
That Bind Us' has such a strong,  eerie ambience,  that its 9 minutes of
pure  delusion will  send you off to an  outside world where nothing but
the  music matters.  Not that Arnej's trying to delude anyone,  creating
new sounds and worlds within them, is part of his nature. Thousands - if
not  millions  -  of  souls  have  gone  lost  in  the world of  Arnej's 
productions, with 'They Always Come Back', 'Dust In The Wind', 'Tomorrow
Never Comes'  and 'Beginning of the End' taking soul by soul.  After the 
more uplifting, anti-Arnej track 'They Need Us', the Canadian mastermind
returns to his deep and dark prog-trance with 'The Strings That Bind Us'.

Intense,  deep-rooted synths swirl  inside a maze of strings,  intricate
vocals effects and the surroundings of melodrama. With 'The Strings That
Bind Us', Arnej's back doing the thing he's best in: creating new worlds
with unforgettable, timeless productions.

You'll  find  'The Strings That Bind Us'  not only on your  mp3  player,
rocking your stereo or down the clubs,  but  also on  Armin van Buuren's
'A State of Trance 2010'.
