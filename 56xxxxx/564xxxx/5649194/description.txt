Lange

************************************************************************


Ranked 31 in the world  (2009 DJ Mag Top 100 Poll),  Lange is recognised 
as one  of  the most influential dance artists of the past decade.  A DJ 
who has  remained  at  the forefront of the scene throughout his  career 
and a producer that continues to push all boundaries.

After an exhausting list of achievements,  counting among them 20 UK top 
40s,  featuring  on a film soundtrack,  and remixing  mainstream artists 
such as the Pet  Shop  Boys,  Lange  remains  one  of  the  leading  EDM 
producers.  His modern day anthem â€œOut of the Skyâ€ catapulted to the top 
of the trance charts,  making him one of  the top selling trance artists 
in 2008 and it still remains a  â€˜never failsâ€™ track for djs and clubbers 
alike.
