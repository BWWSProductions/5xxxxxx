Rating:        T (Teen)
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


Release Notes: The Game has an online feature but I don't believe the dnas was 
               patched, and I didn't have the original disc to patch it. But even
               so I don't know if the servers are still running for this game 
               anyhow.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

EA's Fight Night returns in its second installment. Once again, you can create a new boxer and start a career that begins as an amateur in a shady gym somewhere in Queens, NY and fight your way up to the top. Alternatively, you could relive the careers of some legendary boxers.

Round 2 offers many new features, like fancy particle effects that show blood and sweat spraying into the camera in ultra slow-motion. The "Total Boxer Control", which lets you throw punches by making certain movements with the analog stick, has been improved. There are also many ways to customize the appearance of your character, up to the shaping of the cranium and ears.

The soundtrack consists of a dozen contemporary (but unfortunately edited) hip-hop tracks.


Features:

* The EA SPORTSâ„¢ Haymaker: Unleash the power of the punch. One crushing blow will 
  knock your opponent straight to the canvas, but miss and you're in trouble. 

* Total Boxing Control: You now have total control of your boxer with 360Â° 
  Sticking and Moving and the ability to punch and block while dancing around the 
  ring. 

* Create a Champ: Using the analog sticks for total precision, create and train 
  the ultimate champion by transforming his skills and physique. 

* EA SPORTSâ„¢ Cut-Man: You take an active role in recovering from a beating by
  tending to a swollen eye in the corner between rounds. 

* Dynamic Punch Impacts: Each punch pays off with stunning visuals that reflect 
  the effect of each blow. Your fists have never felt so powerful as injuries 
  affect your fighting abilitiesâ€”a swollen eye prevents you from blocking, and a 
  broken rib impairs your punching ability and mobility.
