This is the bonus dvd that was released with the PAL and NTSC-J version of Final Fantasy X but not the NTSC-U version. Tested and verified as working on all regions under VLC Media player. Enjoy.

*REMEMBER*: When burning to a DVD you are still required to add an empty AUDIO_TS file as it is mandatory for the DVD to be read correctly when inserted into a DVD Player.
