[T],Zoey_Redbird,2010-08-06T20:04Z,This isn't complete. What about Save The Rave? What about Siq With A Q? What about Suicide Club?
,themistyrainable27,2010-08-08T07:10Z,Theyre in there. It's for iTunes that's why they are m4a's
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2010-08-09T05:25Z,"No, I did not re-up your torrent. 

The differences:

Mine's .mp3, you'r is .m4a
Mine has Save The Rave, Siq With A Q, and a lot of stuff your was missing.
3. Mine has more people seeding it.


But I did, however, get a few (and I mean a few. Like, 6 of them) from you. So, thank you. +1 for you, just because you're a pirate. :D"
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2010-08-09T05:31Z,"No. I got a few songs from you though.

As soon is editing starts working again, I'll go ahead and give you credit. Sorry I didn't in the first place. :/"
