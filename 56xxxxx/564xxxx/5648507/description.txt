   High school senior Derek (Drew Seeley) was adjusting to life in a new
 town when he discovered an overgrown path leading into the woods. According 
 to his classmates, the local kids used to use it as a shortcut before a 
 malevolent farmer began chasing them away with a shovel. Eventually, a few 
 of the local kids went missing under mysterious circumstances. Rumor has it 
 that the old man got them. Now years have passed, and no one dares go near 
 the path. The townspeople have simply accepted the fact that it's off limits.
 But Derek suspects that the old man is hiding something, and he's determined 
 to find out what it is. Once he uncovers the sinister secret that lies just
 beyond the trees, however, he may not live to reveal the awful truth.
