[V],TheExecutive,2010-06-25T20:40Z,"Thanks for uploading this -- not sure why you sued ASF instead of MP3,  but that's OK.   If the converter doesn't work for Mac, then I'll use VLC Player to listen to these.

By the way, could you do me a favor, please? I noticed you're a trusted uploader.

I've been uploading TV shows to Pirate Bay for 2 years, and the mods won't promote me to VIP status.  TPB currently isn't allowing uploads by anyone other that VIPs because the captcha code system isn't working for 2 days now.

If you or anyone else could post on my behalf on the SuprBay forum I'd really appreciate it!

Just ask them to let Executive have his long overdue Green Skull. I have lots more to offer and I'm falling behind -- my classic TV fan downloaders want what I have to offer, and most of them don't use other torrent sites!

Thanks."
