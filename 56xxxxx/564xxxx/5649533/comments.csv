[V],globeplus,2010-06-27T21:49Z,to kadamba : you need close 1 gb ram to make the extraction beside that reeinstall the frearc program and restart the computer before making the extraction to don´t have possible interferences from background applications that can interfere with the extraction .

for anyone having this issue:
the program cant start because d3dx9_39.dll is missing

solution to this seems to be to create a new profile (i know its hard to see) then log in, i was able to see options, then video and managed to change the resolution to something lower using the arrow keys - took a bit of messing, but working now :)"

,adpanzerlover,2011-09-29T21:01Z,godammit cant extract arc file tried 2-3 extractors supporting arc file but they arent able to extract arc file:((( even cant find globarc extractor :(( can you pls upload it in zip format!!
,marcus.ei,2011-09-30T09:47Z,"@adpanzerlover

I was able to extract with the first arc extractor I found, I believe it's simply called ARC. lol.

Anyways the globe extractor is found in the first file your suppsed to extract.

The issue I am having so far is that at the end of the extraction of the ""Sniper_x86.exe"" file it starts to load the game but then it says ""ghost warrior has stopped working"" and windows closes the program.

Any ideas anyone?"
,marcus.ei,2011-09-30T09:49Z,"Actually its called ""FreeARC"""
,marcus.ei,2011-09-30T11:47Z,"Got it working, everything is great!

Only issue I see is it is VERY slow, but I heard that goes away later (at least thats what im hoping)

Only other thing is there seems to be no voice audio from anyone..

Thanks globe!"
