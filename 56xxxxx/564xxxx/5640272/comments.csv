Christianity -The belief that some cosmic Jewish zombie can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present because some rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree."

Remember that phrases like that are the kind that people used to only be able to express as bumper stickers, and only people near their car would see it. But this is the Internet! What was once a bumper sticker is now the kind of thing that 'rebelious' 16-year olds who live with their parents find online, and ache to find somewhere to repeat. Eventually they land somewhere, like TPB, which is also online, ergo, relevance. TAKE THAT. MOM AND DAD!!!"
