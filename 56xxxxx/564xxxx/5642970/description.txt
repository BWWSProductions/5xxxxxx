         This is the story of the Earths greatest gift to              
         humanity, and how it has shaped the development of our        
         civilization. That gift is fire. From the earliest hearth     
         fires have kept us warm, cooked our food, and provided        
         light. Today we have found a few more uses for fire. Our      
          ability to master fire has driven human history.
