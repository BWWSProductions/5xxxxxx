Rx Notes
-----------------
Video Source: RelizLab [THANKS!]
Audio Source: PrisM and IMAGiNE [THANKS!]

Lowered the red quite alot and then adjusted the other colors. Lowered the chroma and saturation. Added a little contrast, denoised, sharpened and a few other things. Not to bad for a cam, however it does have a slight flicker and some camera movement at times. Now for the audio we used PrisM's audio that IMAGiNE had cleaned up, so thanks to both of them for their work on the audio and to whomever recorded it.

UPLOADER NOTES
IMHO...Rx has a little better audio than PrisM & Rx video is a little brighter than IMAGiNE...PLEASE COMMENT :)
