,ReliableTorrent,2010-06-22T09:29Z,"Hi lavato,

I tested it myself and it worked.
You must block application by a FireWall (For example : littlesnitch) before you enter serial number."
,lavato,2010-06-23T06:12Z,"Hello Reliabletorrent

I had try what you said refure acces to any conenction abd it saud the software key is a pirate number then it bring me to the web site to buy the software. I can't see how......The only other way will be for you to do a patch and be able to pacht it."
,ReliableTorrent,2010-06-23T12:47Z,"Unfortunately in most case it's too late to block application from accessing to internet when it detect serial number is illegal.

You must block application by a firewall in first use before you enter serial number which you did not.

as you mentioned i think the only other way is a patch for you."
