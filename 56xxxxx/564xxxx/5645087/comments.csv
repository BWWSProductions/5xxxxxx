raymondhome I'm sure it's top quality."

[V],IndexTrance,2010-06-23T12:37Z,I don't need a sample to know this is spot on quality. 'DiAMOND' release group is the best when it comes to dvdrips so i'm just gonna download and enjoy the movie. Thanks for putting all these fine releases from all kind of groups here. I can honestly say that we are all greatful for that. Take Care.

,Xionitsu,2010-07-07T05:25Z,"So it's unfortunate that the first post I ever have to make on TPB is one of disapproval. After having downloaded this torrent, I just got a notice from my ISP for this exact torrent, filename and all. :) Seeing as I've downloaded so much from TPB, I can't imagine it's me, my machine, or anything else. So disappointed.."
,dorikin_pirate,2010-07-07T10:16Z,"Thanks raymondhome for uploading BUT...

Same as Xionitsu, this is being tracked by the big wigs. I'm in Australia and was served a warning from my ISP for downloading this torrent so beware.

RE: the movie. it's not bad but is definately not a must-see IMHO
