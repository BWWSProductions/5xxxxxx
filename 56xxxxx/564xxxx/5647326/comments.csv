[V],room101bellboy,2010-06-24T23:45Z,"The other two westerns belonging to ""The Man with No Name Trilogy"" were already encoded by Kingdom-Release in BRRip quality. 

I don't see the point of doing again ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"". 

Use the search function. :)"
,satfilez,2010-06-25T00:07Z,"Thanks, i've found them :)"
,satfilez,2010-06-25T00:14Z,"I don't think there is a blu ray version of :  ""my name is nobody ""

[V],room101bellboy,2010-06-27T02:05Z,"""My Name Is Nobody"" had a limited Blu-Ray release (only Italian audio I think and not yet in major resellers catalogues, Amazon for instance). Maybe that's the reason it's not been encoded by the Scene or a P2P group yet.

Info link:  http://forum.blu-ray.com/italy/137906-my-name-nobody-il-mio-nome-e-nessuno-terence-hill.html 

I've found a 720p encode with a low bitrate in a private tracker but it's not a source good enough for me to encode from (I need 1080p at least). 

I might do it in the future. :)"

,rg769vc,2011-11-29T00:28Z,"Audio 10/10
Video 10/10

however there is something i can't deal with, it's the sync. it's a bit laggy between audio and footage. I face the same issue many times. it would be appreciated if anyone one let me know what to do, and what's the reason for this.

Please take in consideration i'm a newbie. Thanks "
