Jefferson Airplane FLY 
Released Sept 21, 2004

"Fly Jefferson Airplane" is a musical documentary recommended easily to fans of the beloved San Francisco acid-rock group. Vintage performance footage of their best-known songs are presented in surprisingly-clean footage with good sound fidelity and in their entirety -- rare for most "nostalgia" videos. The performances span the classic "hits" of the 1966-1970 era.

The interviews, interspersed between the songs, show the band members (Grace Slick, Marty Balin, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Cassidy, Spencer Dryden) fondly, insightfully, and humorously recalling what made Jefferson Airplane tick.
