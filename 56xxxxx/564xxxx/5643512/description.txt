2nd Edition
By Sally Adams, Tim Holmes, Harriett Gilbert, Wynford Hicks


Praise for the first edition:
-----------------------------

'There are books that are badly written, books that are well written and books that you wish you'd written. This is one of the latter. Hicks and his co-writers produce a book that is a joy to read and is packed full of helpful advice.' - Chris Frost, Journalist

'You don't have to be a journalist to read this book. Anyone with an interest in improving their writing skills and developing a sense of good style will find it useful Wynford Hicks takes a no-nonsense, sleeves rolled up approach to writing which has no time for preciousness.' - Roy Johnson, Mantex

'Writing for Journalists neatly fills a gap in the market for a no-nonsense book for trainees written by trainers who genuinely understand the industry and who have moved with the times.' - Sharon Wheeler, Journalism Studies Writing for Journalists is about the craft of journalistic writing: how to put one word after another so that the reader gets the message â€“ or the joke â€“ goes on reading and comes back for more. It is a practical guide for all those who write for newspapers, periodicals and websites, whether students, trainees or professionals.
