,SergioKool,2010-06-27T15:49Z,seed seed seeeeeeeeeeddddddd guys 6 people 100% and no seeding aff seed  :/
[V],globeplus,2010-06-27T21:39Z,"To titikab : ok i explain , this game in not convencional videos in the way that have the sound separatdly from the video , in many videos that was possible i reformulate the video files incorporating the sound on the main video with a nice work but some of them wasn´t possible and they pass a kind of quick anyway and with the subtitles you certainly understand what´s going on , my decision was absolutly corrected under the circunstances and i maded an effort to keep the videos more ok as possible making reformulations from the videos that was possible , well the game ius complete and is nothing missing for a real nice size . thank you ."
,PRboy1,2010-06-28T19:37Z,seed more pls 
[V],globeplus,2010-06-30T03:23Z,"I am transtornated with the help on this file , if it is because a few videos that pass quickly are without sound it is ridiculous and i worked the videos that was possible putting integrated sound , 3.18 gb for this file is a excelent work and the users get 100% of the gameplay , sometimes i am ashamed like in this file to do lot of work to upload nice game files for a nice size , maybe it is possible to criticize me but all ofyou like to have nice help at the moment of the download . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-02T06:13Z,"The help on this game file improved a little bit and thank god for that and i hope still that way , the users have to believe me that asking for seeds is a thing that really don´t pleased me in anyway and i normaly don´t ask but i am still saying that each one of you like to see seeds at the moment of the download .

Thank you for understanding and happy gaming ."
,sizons,2010-07-02T08:16Z,does this work online?
,kosmaverik,2010-07-02T14:08Z,"@sizons Why don't you just read the description? 3rd line ;)!
""FILE INFO : few videos without sound but the subtitles do the trick and no multiplayer""
Downloading now at good speed :D! Thx globe+ and nice work ;)!!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-07-02T17:42Z,"To sizons :  the users need to have in mind that the multiplayers are complicate to use in the torrent files and even for real buyers of the game with a valid key is needed nice servers working fine that don´t kick you out or having lot of multiplayers friends , so no matter what it is never easy the use of the multiplayers basically , you can say , it is many multiplayers out there that you can use but for new multiplayers is never easy specially if you don´t have a valid key ."
,kosmaverik,2010-07-03T14:22Z,It works :D! Thx globeplus & keep up the good work!
,thedarko,2010-07-05T01:27Z,tell me how to extract the file ARC cant extract... who program or extractor to use???
,SolidOptimus83,2010-07-05T20:24Z,"Hey globe, thanks for uploading this game for the PC.

I'm stuck, can you please help?

Everytime I try to start the game by clicking the on TWFC.exe red transformer icon I get a small window message pop up saying 

""An instance of the game is already running.""

But the game isn't running, nothing else happens.
What do I do to get the game to work?

I've got Batman Arkham Asylum on my laptop and it works fine.

And for those who need to extract the ARC file of this downloaded game, download this program and you can extract the ARC file.

http://freearc.org/Download.aspx

Any help would be much appreciated."
