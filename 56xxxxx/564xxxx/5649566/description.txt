* The plot of Transformers: War for Cybertron is set long before the events of the Transformers: Prime television series. It begins with the Decepticon campaign, though players can choose to begin with the Autobot campaign and return to the Decepticon campaign later. In the Decepticon campaign Megatron is fighting to return Cybertron to his version of the "golden age", using means he considers necessary. He discovers a source of all-powerful dark energon guarded by Starscream in his research station. Megatron obtains it after a battle with Starscream and immerses himself in the dark energon. Starscream asks Megatron to teach him how to use dark energon in return for his service to Megatron. Shocked by his betrayal, Starscream's colleague Jetfire escapes the space station.
Starscream offers to send Thundercracker and Skywarp after him, but Megatron sends the trio to reactivate the energon bridge connecting Starscream's space station and Cybertron. Megatron then develops a plan to infect the core of Cybertron with dark energon, destroying the Autobots. For this plan to succeed, Megatron launches a full-scale assault on Iacon, looking for an item called the Omega Key. The Decepticons learn that Zeta Prime has placed the key under his personal guard. Megatron's forces enter the chambers of Zeta Prime and defeat him in battle, taking him prisoner. Zeta Prime tells Megatron that the Omega Key is not actually the key, but is the means to activate the true key, a transformer known as Omega Supreme. Omega Supreme chases and attacks Megatron and his minions relentlessly. Megatron, realizing his impending peril, hatches a plan to lure Omega Supreme to a rooftop defended with turrets, where Omega Supreme is ambushed. Omega Supreme sustains heavy damage and plummets into Cybertron's lower levels.
In the Autobot campaign, the Autobot leader, Zeta Prime, has been reported dead and Optimus temporarily takes up the mantle of leadership. He begins recruiting new Transformers to the Autobot cause in order to fight Megatron and the Decepticons. The Autobot campaign begins with Optimus, Bumblebee and Ratchet defending their 
home city of Iacon. Optimus, Ratchet and Bumblebee then proceed to defend Iacon by activating the planetary guns. Afterward they reactivate the communication grid and defend the Decagon from Decepticons. After reaching the Decagon, the Autobots fight Starscream and are successful in driving him into a cowardly retreat.
