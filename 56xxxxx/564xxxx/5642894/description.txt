Whilst working as a hustler and pimp in Soho's sex industry for Stanley (Danny Dyer - Dead Man Running), Woody (Robert Cavanah) agrees to be filmed by a documentary camera crew for one week. However, it s no ordinary week; his latest porn shoot is behind schedule, he loses his apartment and he is beaten up by a rival gang of Chinese thugs. These are the least of his problems though, when one of his girls, Petra (Barbara Nedeljakova - Hostel), goes missing. During his frantic search for her through the seductive Soho underworld Woody soon finds himself starting to question his whole life - a life he now finds spiraling brutally out of control... Featuring an explosive cast (including Billy Boyd, Scarlett Alice Johnson, Martin Compston, Robert Fucilla and Susie Amy), Pimp is a sexy, exciting and action-packed look at the darker side of London's glamorous and dangerous nightlife.
