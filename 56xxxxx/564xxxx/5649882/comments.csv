,Torrent_Meister,2010-06-28T22:14Z,"I do sincerely apologize. I actually turned uTorrent off so that I could watch Top Gear on iPlayer without it buffering every 2 seconds. Other than that there are 2 seeds, and it has been seeding from the moment I uploaded, on both a netbook and desktop. I have seeded for 2 days straight even though I needed my netbook today. Show a lil gratitude okay?

kthxbye."

,sgt_schultz,2011-10-18T11:11Z,why do so many ppl get this wrong - this is Series 5.  Season 5 ran in 1967-68 and all but a few episodes have been lost by the BBC.
