Desc: Wanderer John Liu and angry young man Tino Wong
are direct descendants of the "Strike Rock Fist"
masters, who began as the best of friends but ended 
as the worst of enemies. The legacy of hate and 
revenge continues until the two feuding warriors 
discover that they have a mutual enemy in Phillip Kao,
a perverse master of the dangerous art of Sun Ta. Our
heroes must forget the past and unite to fight as a 
solid rock that will crush this evil menace.

Notes: The 5th of the 9 bootleg kungfu dubs. I found
these in an old box of VHS tapes cleaning up my 
basement. If you're into poorly dubbed wacko kungfu
movies, where a punch makes a high snapping noise,
and lip movements don't match the dialog, these are
for you. If you know the original movie, please 
enlighten the rest of us. As for this one, I'm glad
they kept this one letterboxed instead of pan&scan. 
Too bad they had to cut stuff off the sides (just
look at the opening credits)
