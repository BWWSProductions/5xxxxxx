For your information: before torrents are posted at TPB they've been tested by many people. Also ""Umbrella tears"" and "" arulkarthik"" reported no problems, and they're considered as reliable TPB users.

So I'm sorry to hear about your pc. As stated at the bottom of my torrent descriptions:

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the ""United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users""!"

i need ur help
i want to know the best converter to convert most video file formats to MPEG-II for my LCD TV.
I have tried ANY VIDEO CONVERTER, TVC & 
many other converters, they can convert but i cannot watch in full screen mode, even if it does play in full screen the quality becomes very poor.
So suggest me a good MPEG-II converter which can convert and change the resolution without quality loss.
i want to convert a movies from 700x320 to 1280x720 in good quality.
which is the best and easy converter for me."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-29T13:43Z,"@hiest 

You could try AVS Video Converter, which is one of the better video converters:

,ioannisarc,2010-07-02T13:03Z,"Hi!
I dont know if you accept any request but I will ask you the same.
There is a small but powerful program called DEVFUS at http://www.devcad.com/eng/devfus.htm that can take a 2D design of an airplane fuselage and make automaically a 3D design of it and also can export various sections of it.
There are many rc modelers out there that dont have the money for a program like this, so if it is posible and if it is easy, a crack for thiw program would be nice.
Thank you and sorry for the request if you wrote somewhere you dont accept requests."
,oXXoBio,2010-07-02T16:22Z,"hi, RH.. can you tell me how to hide real IP address while uploading torrents?

I tried TOR but its slow. Can I rely on HSS anchorfree? Could you please suggest any other reliable and free way to hide our ip while uploading torrents?
Thanks. "
[V],hiest,2010-07-04T17:10Z,"AVS Video Converter worked great....., Thanks..."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-06T01:28Z,"@ioannisarc 
When making requests, always try to provide the name and version of the program. It's in your own benefit, since some people (uploaders) don't have the time left to figure that all out.
For requests you can also use the forum, so that more people can take note of the request. Search for the right section at the SB forum: http://forum.suprbay.org/


@oXXoBio 
There's no 100% anonimity on the web. However, a VPN servise is a good option for up/downloading. More help/info at the  SB forum: http://forum.suprbay.org/

You're welcome. :)"
