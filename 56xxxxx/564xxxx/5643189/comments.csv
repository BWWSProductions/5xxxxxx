from where did u got the cd so that i can also import it!!!!!"
[V],bubanee,2010-06-22T09:52Z,"i can't tell you that J... lol
and besides if you import it chances it will be released before you get the import over your way! :))"
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-22T09:56Z,I don't care of that i didn't asked bcoz i wanted to upload u already did bt i just wanted to support the artists!!!

[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-22T12:43Z,"ooooooh man.  now THIS is an upload!!!!!!!

thank you VERY much Bubs!"
,CJamR,2010-06-22T13:14Z,"Wow. Bubanee you were my favorite and now you're my super favorite.

You're hella legit, will seed a long time. Thanks for this great upload."
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-22T13:18Z,i just sawn the log file and it shows some pre track gap of 1.74 why is that so?????
[V],bubanee,2010-06-22T14:29Z,"Thanks Z, C and AAA.. :)))
I thought i would be the Bubanee of old for this one and smash it out early.. lol

J.. pre-gap length is really for 100% Scoring Flac.. Same for the Log when you do a 2 - pass Flac with non- compliant Gaps.. the 1.74 is good it's actually 0:00:01.74 where the normal range is 0:00:02.00 so it's under anyway... None of this is necessary for MP3.. but i do it anyway except the 2-pass which you don't need either because EAC will soon jam up a fault if it finds one... and pre-gaps does not interfere with the quality.. :))"
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-22T15:06Z,Thanks!!!!!!...........
,AllTheFun,2010-06-22T15:16Z,still on the search for a 320 version  good up though
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-22T16:31Z,"@pizzano23 :-
VBR is the bets settings for mp3s go search it in google and thats what bubanee has given you so ""320 Version"" - ""The Worst!!!!"""

[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-28T18:41Z,Bubanee is the ultimate audio uploader.  the best of the best hands down.
,xTheBlackBirdx,2010-06-29T08:43Z,this isnt the deluxe
,mth978,2010-06-29T18:36Z,"This is not the deluxe version. It's missing two bonus tracks, which is the only this differentiating the two versions."
,wayawesomer,2010-06-30T03:48Z,"mth978, you don't know what you're talking about! The original edition has 14 tracks. You sir, are retarded. This one has 16 tracks including the bonus tracks ""Don't Trust Me"" and ""Starstrukk ft. Katy Perry""

THANK YOU SO MUCH BUBANEE FOR THIS AMAZING UPLOAD"
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-30T16:22Z,"Hey B.....

u are active ?? aren't you???

a little worried!!! no release in sum days"
[V],bubanee,2010-07-01T06:21Z,"Cheers all for the Kind Words.. :))))
J.. Don't worry about me, I come and go buddy i ain't leaving just Busy in other areas thats all.. :))"
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-01T07:50Z,"kk......

good to hear from you!!!!......."
,jay2125,2010-07-01T20:48Z,this is not the real deluxe version. its missing the correct bonus tracks (My First Kiss Remix and House Party Remix). makes sense because this was uploaded before the album released officially. 
,hasitleaked,2010-07-02T06:11Z,"Hey bubanee, if you would like to work with me and my website hasitleaked.com shoot me an email through the tips link on the page!"
[V],bubanee,2010-07-02T08:02Z,"@jay, since your obvisiously new to this i'll explain..
Different Countries - Different Deluxe Versions..
and if you must know buddy Don't Ever Believe In A Release Date.. it'll #### you up everytime... 
CDRip my friend.. :))"
[V],bubanee,2010-07-02T08:04Z,"@ hasitleaked
To busy for now but feel free to take the .torrent file and do whatever you like with it. :))"
,jay2125,2010-07-03T03:29Z,"@bubanee
since youre a fail at this i'll explain. 3oh!3 did NOT release the cd you claim to have yet. so figure that one out jackass"
,jay2125,2010-07-03T03:36Z,"youre a fail. this is so easy to fake as the deluxe because the cd you are faking wont be released for another 17 days and hasnt been available on cd any earlier yet get you shit straight. simple to fake tho since the two ""bogus"" tracks you include came off their old album. "
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-03T08:57Z,"@jay2125 :-
If You Dont Know Every Release Out There Of This Album Is A Source Of Bubanee's This torrent.this has an avg bitrate of 244 kbps and every release out there also has the same. so admire bubanee for providing soo soo soo early!!!!!!...... and if you want the remaining 2 bonus tracks download it from my torrent "
[V],bubanee,2010-07-03T14:06Z,"jbhifionline.c*m.*u/music/pop-rock/streets-of-gold/526241

Jay don't even bother with your rubbish.. you know nothing i KNOW EVERYTHING!"
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-03T14:17Z,Lol..... I thought you were saying that to me...ha ha ha
[V],bubanee,2010-07-03T14:42Z,"No J.. lol the other Jay...
i had a giggle what he'd wrote.. reminds me when i first started with all the bullshit i used to get.. thats what a lot of people don't understand.. release dates.. regardless of what country your in there's always a way to get it earlier.. i got this on a tuesday when it was meant to be released on a friday.. but some places don't give a f#ck about charts or itune releases if they have it out back in a box they rip it open and throw it on the shelf... so i'm hopin' jay2125 wants to go on with it..  "
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-03T15:17Z,Rightly Said!!!!
,jay2125,2010-07-04T02:57Z,"thanks for sayin that every one of these out there comes from bubane because thats not true. i dont need to download anyone elses because i downloaded it correct the first time. true 320 kbps too btw. the american version (since you cant get it in italy) which is the one i was looking for since i already have their album ""want"" so why would i need two old songs as bonus tracks. "
[V],bubanee,2010-07-04T03:45Z,"fair enough Jay, so now you know different versions come out different countries... aus/jap/ger.. usually get things first and some do differ from the usa versions... even i have waited for other countries versions just to grab those few extra songs to add to my own collection at home... 
have a good day.. :))"
[T],ctang,2010-07-06T14:56Z,"@bubanee: you way nicer than i would have been i sure know that, especially after some of the comments directed towards you"
[V],bubanee,2010-07-06T17:42Z,"Cheers ctang.. this time last year i would of been the most abusive f#cker going.. these days i sought of control myself and now i know why i have almost left and gone to private sites.. at least the folks there know what a CDRip is!!!...
on my next CDRip i'm just going to write in the first comment box.. 'Thanks in advance' and never come back until next up and let the debaters argue amongst themselves.. :)) "

Rightly Said b.... people here dont know the real meaning of a CDRip they think 320 cbr is everything!!!!"
