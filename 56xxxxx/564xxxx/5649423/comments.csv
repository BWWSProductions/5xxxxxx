Don't convert it to lower then 448 KB/s."

,LPScorp,2011-08-23T13:45Z,Hi I can't use or don't know how to change the subtitles can you explain how can I do it?
[T],FaeGiN,2011-09-25T15:13Z,"Thank you so much for a GREAT upload my friend. Much appreciated.
About the subs...an easy way is to use the tools already mentioned in the description, for demuxing, and demux the subs from the MKV file, leaving the subs you want only. Or remove them all if they are displaying in your TV, like my Samsung, ~I cannot choose to disable mkv subs so I need to remove them all first. It is simple! Go to videohelp.com and learn learn learn!"
