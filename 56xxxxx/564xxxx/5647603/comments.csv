,Gimcrackery,2010-06-29T01:24Z,"Hello there!
First of all, many thanks to TPTB for the torrent, lotsa love from France :)
I installed and got the game to work, but I've encountered a very odd bug;
My mouse seems to be blocked, forcing any contextual menu or the game itself to spin/or slide to the right uncontrollably, making it impossible to play or change options involving slide bars.
I'm using windows Vista 32 bits home edition, any suggestions would be very welcome."
,r2007uk,2010-06-29T14:39Z,I know it's much to ask for multiplayer in pirated games but any info on that? I noticed 3 profiles already included but obviously they (or the key code) is constantly in use. Does this mean that any key will work i.e a Gen or was the code the game came installed with already legit to begin with?
,r2007uk,2010-06-29T16:28Z,Yeah I have been playing the singple player for the past few hours this game is an EPIC WIN.

Thanks shroo for the game and thanks hasimird for making the game work!"
[T],Vitamin_X,2010-06-30T01:38Z,"@Gimcrackery
Are you sure its not the problem of your mouse itself?
Unplug your mouse and start the game using just your keyboard (arrow keys to select and enter to confirm selection to get the game started). And find out if the problem persists."

,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-04T08:11Z,"Does anyone have this problem?

The game freezes for about 3 secs after every 10-15 secs. This also happens in the menu. For me it runs at 50-60 fps but i have the freezing problem.

My specs are the following - 
Processor - Intel Core 2 Quad Q8400
RAM - 2GB
Graphics Card - Geforce 9400GT, 1GB
Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit.

Is it because the 9400GT is not supported. If not then why it runs at 50+ fps?
Please help. I have all the latest drivers."

,PaulAl,2010-07-06T01:05Z,"@NarutoNamikaze
If the game freezes every minute (or so) for about 5 seconds, then reconfigure your firewall to give the game 'local' access to your network (internet access is not needed).
Apparently it needs to have at least regular network access; hence the apparent freezing as it tries to get ""connected""...
In my case, I reconfigured Zonealarm to give ""singularity.exe"" full 'Trusted Access'.

,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-12T15:06Z,"@ PaulAl nnThanks a lot. Your method worked. I made it trusted in KIS 2010 but it didn\'t work. Then i played with internet connection on and it worked flawlessly. Do you play with the internet connection on? If yes, is there any exchange of data?"
,SteXDudE,2010-07-12T19:26Z,On my PC i dont have internet connection and my game still freezes.In Firewall i give it full access and no changes.Can someone help?
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-13T15:48Z,"@ SteXDudEnI think you need internet connection to play it properly. But you can try this method (if you have a nvidia graphics card) and see if it works or not.nGo to nvidia control panel , then 3d settingsnin the 3d settings for singularity  override game settings and set evrything to maximum , specially filtering. Try FIDDLING WITH GAME SETTINGS IN NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL to see if the problem gets solved. I don\'t know if this works or not. This solution was provided by someone else in AiTB\'s comments. But later he said that it was a net problem. But another one told that this worked for him."
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-13T16:19Z,FREEZING PROBLEM SOLUTION:nProblem - The game freezes for 2-3 secs after every 10-15 secs.nCause - Every time the game starts it tries to access the internet. This is what cause the freezes.nSolution - First connet to the internet. Then start the game and select Start Game. Then select New Game/ Continue. After the game loads pause it and press Alt + Tab. Disconnect from the internet if you want to. Then click on the game on the taskbar and play without any freezes. (you can keep the internet connection on if you want to)nYou have to do this every time you start the game.
