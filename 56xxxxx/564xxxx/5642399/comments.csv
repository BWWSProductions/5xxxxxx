,Tamarind777,2010-06-24T02:04Z,"Family guy used to be funny at one time, now it's just a platform for Seth Macfarlane's political crap. I think perhaps he wanted to be a politician and never got to, so he is using the show to get his issues out. What a shame. I think this show will do it for me. I am burning ALL of my DVD's. He has gone too far now. It's ok to make a political statement that's funny once in a while. For example, in the episode The Road to Germany, Brian and Stewie beat up to SS soldiers and took their uniforms. On Stewie's uniform was a pin that said ""McCain Palin."" I thought that was just hilarious. But in this episode, they bantered back and forth why an embryo is not a life and presented ""their"" side. Brian seemed to suggest that all abortions are done on embryos the size of a pinhead. This is just bull. How come they never mentioned late term abortion? There are many arguments that show that an embryo is still a life. In fact, fetuses are also aborted too, not just embryos.

They threw out all the old tired arguments such as it's the woman's body and she can do what she wants with it. Well, an ambryo/fetus is NOT the woman's body, but a separate entity. It's being NOURISHED by her body, but it's NOT a part of it like her toe of hand. That is just bull. Also, they said what if a woman is raped, or what about incest? So what? Why should the baby be killed because you got raped? What kill the rapist if you want to kill someone.

This show has really gone to the dogs now."
,Jlas2h,2010-06-24T04:47Z,"get the fuck over yourself man. the show wasn't made for your liking. what? just because they hit one subject that your touchy on your gonna stop watchin it. i love family guy, when south park dissed and made fun of that do you think i stopped watchin south park. No. You Have to use you brain. "
,Tamarind777,2010-06-24T21:41Z,"Jlas2h, I understand what you're saying, but the show sucks now-a-days. Since they've begun using it as a political machine, it's been going down the tubes. It's not just one thing, but a trend that drives entire shows. They seem to have an agenda now, and that's to push political positions. I hate South Park. Simpson's still rocks too. I still maintain my point."
,Tamarind777,2010-06-24T21:42Z,"BTW, thanks for the UP."
,hotojucie,2010-06-27T00:30Z,"@Tamarind777
I totally agree with you.  As for me, I have been sick of the shows liberal bias for years now.  My favorite episode is the one where Brian takes Quagmire out to find out why he doesn't like him.  Quagmire just lets him have it, and shows Brian what a hypocritical idiot he is.  The pin on a Nasi uniform could be funny no matter who's name was on it, someone would agree and laugh.  It could have said ""Obama Biden"" and I would have laughed my ass off.  The only ""change"" you are getting is an escalation.  Still in Iraq, escalating in Afghanistan, and US and Israeli war ships have just passed through the Suez Canal on their way to Iran.  How can you get more ""Nasi"" than that?  Where is all of the anti-war rhetoric and protests now that you have YOUR man in?  Hmm?  People absolutely make me sick.  They are all fake.  Politics are simply evil no matter the side you are on and it is sad to see them so prevalent in television.  Put that in your pipe.  Thanks for the up:) "
,kukrunk,2010-06-28T04:47Z,As long as they make fun of jews I'm ok with it. :)
,Foz660,2010-06-29T05:24Z,"Wow, Tamarind777, you have missed the point about the episode completely. They are making fun of people like you. You blindly follow one side of the argument, and dismiss the other, they are mocking the fact that people on both sides don?t weigh up all the factors of an issue. Also your arguments against abortion are very misinformed, and I suggest you read up on the subject matter, with a non biased approach before arguing about it. In short, a) would you want to tell a child you care for that his dads a rapist?, b) the show never claimed all abortion was to undeveloped foetuses, and finally c) the child is genetically 50% of the mother, and is carried by her for 9 months, to say they are 2 very separate things is quite misguided.  I am neither for nor against abortion, but I can safely say I know the issues surrounding it, and can make a well informed decision about the subject. And yes Family Guy has political issues in it, but the whole premise of the show is to make fun of the issues, not force one idea onto the viewer. Also use a spell checker next time you comment. Happy torrenting. Thanks for the upload Jlas2h."
,Saerain,2010-06-29T22:07Z,"Hate to break it to you, guys, but the best comedy has always pissed people like you off for being right and making people laugh at you, and it's precisely because beer-brained men and uneducated housewives say certain things are 'off limits' that comedy tells them to go fuck themselves.

Whatever people don't want you to talk about, humorously or not, is exactly what needs to be discussed most. No exceptions. How in the name of sanity can ignorance ever be a virtue?"
,jtata,2010-06-30T18:10Z,"It's just poking fun. Don't be ignorant and take it personally. It's all in good fun. That's why family guy is for adults and not for children. If you can't appreciate it then don't watch it, but don't ruin it for everyone else. The whole point of family guy is to provide satire that is controversial whether it is political or religious. If it wasn't then it would be on the cartoon network during the day after Sesame Street. lol. Lighten up, if it touches on a topic you don't like just skip that episode, no ones forcing you to watch."
,Jlas2h,2010-07-03T23:33Z,thank all you guys for the seeds and comments. all much appreciated
,Tamarind777,2010-07-05T04:59Z,"Foz660: It seems YOU have missed the point entirely. Family Guy began being a funny show, but has not morphed into a political propaganda tool to push Macfarlane's liberal agendas. How could someone joke about having sex with kids? Is that funny? Do you find that funny? I don't, and kids who have been abused sexually I am sure don't either. If you don't know, Macfarlane has jokes about this on other shows too, not just Family Guy.

If I'd want to tell a child that his father is a rapist? Listen to your lack of logic: So, instead of breaking that ""horrible news"" to him, your idea is, ""Junior, I'll spare you the trouble of finding out that your dad is a rapist by murdering you!"" What an idiotic reasoning. So what? What if a child was already born and his dad rapes someone and is in jail for it? Won't you still have to tell him one day? Or, would you say to kill that child too in order to spare him that bad news? I can tell you're not much of a thinker."
,Tamarind777,2010-07-05T05:06Z,"Foz660"" Use a spell checker? Get off your high horse. I was an English major, but I am NOT writing a professional paper here, if you didn't know. So what, I made a few mistakes that I didn't catch. I know how to write, but I am not trying to impress you with mechanics. What I am trying to do is expose your illogical reasoning."

,obfuscate,2010-07-14T04:26Z,"OK.  It is his liberal agenda.  So what?  So it isn\'t the same show it was when it started.  So it isn\'t what you think it should be.  So you don\'t think the jokes are funny.  So what?nnI don\'t think everything that is Said on Fox is funny either.  Or what Rush & Glenn Beck says and their obvious CONSERVATIVE agenda.  All LIES!!  And you know what?  So what?nnGet over yourself.  This site and these shows don\'t have to be all about you.  And stop bring up some BS about \""it\'s all about the kids\"". Boo hoo.   So what!!nnAnd if you disagree you are obviously wrong.  :)nn"
,silvan9145,2010-07-30T11:56Z,everyone just stfu and enjoy jeez
,Charbis,2010-08-03T02:00Z,"Amazing episode, all you assholes who want to tell a woman what to do with her unborn child can shut it. If she wants it she can have it, if not then who are you to fuckin judge. "
,sean7787,2010-08-09T15:28Z,"great upload. the episode is nothing more than just trying to be funny. thanks Jlas2h, been looking for this for a while. fox did not show it here in the United States cause Fox has to censor certain things and this is considered too risky by them...."
,Slayer488,2010-09-10T08:13Z,"what makes you think we give a crap about what you think about family guy? if you dont like, then dont complain to us cause we dont give a damn"
,jmcbride1983,2010-09-11T00:35Z,"Thanks. Looks great. And to all of you complaining, get over it. It's called comedy."
,hootieman,2010-09-26T15:40Z,"supposedly I saw a DVD promo for this exact same episode, on sale 9/28 wonder if its the same thing. It says ""Banned from TV"". "
,blueboy7948,2010-09-27T10:07Z,"Isn't the whole point of family guy to push a point as far as it can go or at last as far as the network will let them? race, religion, sexual abuse and guess what tamarind - politics seems to there as well. perhaps you never really got it at all. Maybe Peter should just fight a giant chicken in an extended fight sequence every week."
,cavspawn904,2010-09-28T01:39Z,how but all you mother fuckers just go to a blog site or sumthing and just fucken comment on the quality no one fucken cares wut you personally think of family guy download it or get the fuck off the page
,Orionsbel,2010-09-30T05:19Z,"Seriously if you don't want to download than don't, no one cares bout your politics you want that then go somewhere else. "
,sctehking,2010-09-30T22:24Z,"I don't care about the issue of abortion in this episode, I care for the humor, which there was none to be found here. Thats why this show sucks, because it's not funny anymore. I don't care why its not funny, just that it isn't. Thanks for the upload though dude, your work is very much appreciated. "
,monstermah9,2010-10-03T02:03Z,"I wish Tamarind777's mom believed in abortion.  She probably does now, although hindsight is 20/20.  Doesn't Tamarind777 have a Glenn Beck rally to go to or something?  I'm surprised he didn't call Seth a Nazi, socialist, communist, fascist, something, blah blah blah....  Oh, by the way, taking a composition 101 class at your local community college doesn't make you an ""English major,"" let alone a graduate.  Nice try though.  I'll leave you now to shovel Rush's ignorant based propaganda into your tiny, feeble, and mostly empty skull.  You've got to fill it with something, right (since it won't be knowledge)?  Stupid Teapublitarians...."
,Agent365,2010-10-04T06:36Z,"A agree completely with Orionsbel. This is a TORRENT site, not an open forum for debates on the politically correctness of cartoons. Has anyone even given an A/V rating yet? I want to know about the quality of this file, not about whether or not you agree with abortion or like a certain television show anymore.

Go somewhere else if you want to shove that self-serving B.S. down unwilling throats.

And sex with children = hilarious."
,chennyg,2010-10-10T13:55Z,this is a torrent about family guy. It does not have a sign that tells people to type essays in the comments
,firestarterxx7,2010-10-28T03:27Z,Thx for the upload.
,mongoliv,2010-11-02T10:02Z,"OMG so many retards have moralissues with this show... DONT WATCH IT THEN U MORON....
since some people use religion as a wiewpoint not many shows can be funny...

,referhead,2010-11-15T00:29Z,this show is fuckin halarious. every week. ofcourse some episodes better than others but still one of the funniest shows on tv. period

er uh LMFAO @ Just Everything!

AV Quality = Normal, Average = Just Fine!

Thanks!"
,Stiff_123,2011-01-01T22:09Z,"Oh, BTW, I wasn't going to say anything but am still laughing at some of the shit people say on here sometimes... So what the hell, I just gotta think maybe some of you sensitive types need one of two things, More Desensitizing or Stop Watching the Fucking TV!
Either way your choices are Conform or Feel Bad.
Just pick one and do it by your fucking self, nobody really cares anymore, don't you get it yet? 
 Life is so much easier when you stop feeling anything. Why do ya think we have Drugs, Alcohol & Comedy? Maybe you should try one or both of the first two because it doesn't sound like the third is your bag... Still Laughing..."
,demonicterran,2011-05-14T14:46Z,"Family Guys main guide line is to make fun of every day living, and that's the end of this discussion."
,lavaflav,2011-05-23T22:17Z,"I kind of agree with tamarind777.  Before you start raging all over the place, let me finish that statement.  Sure, I don't believe in abortion.  I believe it's a terrible thing that just adds to the massive pile of issues irreparably damaging  the moral code of ethics that the world was founded on, yada yada yada. 

But that's not why I wrote in.  I wrote in because family guy really has become a podium for Seth M. to stand on.  I did find some aspects of the episode funny.  After all this is family guy.

My main complaint is that people will use this as an example of showing how brave the guy is because he tackled a touchy subject with a biased opinion, something that does take some braze to do.  But don't forget one thing.

This is a man who will no longer make fun of actions taken by the president of the united states that later turn out to have been mistakes. 

  BECAUSE HE'S BLACK.  "
,hondacity2010,2011-07-26T03:25Z,what's the deal with the download? A/V Quality? this is indeed a torrent site not a FOX TV Forum!
,Me.,2012-01-26T01:29Z,"While a lot of what Tamarind777 says is true, it's just a show. Lots of people enjoy watching family guy. It is ment for comedy, not to start a debate."
