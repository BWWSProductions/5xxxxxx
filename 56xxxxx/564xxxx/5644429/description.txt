Based on the book (under both the names The Northern Lights and in some countries, The Golden Compass) and movie, players assume the role of Lyra Belacqua and Iorek Byrnison in Lyra's attempt to get the golden compass (alethiometer) to her uncle, Lord Asriel which she presumes is what the master of Jordan college wanted her to do, and to save her friend, Roger from the General Oblation Board.
