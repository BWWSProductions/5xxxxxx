[T],ctang,2010-06-24T23:53Z,sorry everyone but i cant seed this for the next few days...gotta take my laptop on the road and chances are that the internet connection wont let me do any type of p2p as they usually dont
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-26T01:50Z,"just needed to let you know this was downloading @ 1.5MBs for me.  that is retard fast.  i am seeding this but it shows no seeders.  i am confused.

i always seed my dvd-r's to 150GBs before i stop seeding.

TPB has some weird little issues to sort out."
[T],ctang,2010-06-26T02:38Z,im not seeding right now until sometime sunday afternoon bc my current location prohibits any p2p connections...thats freaking awesome that you can upload at that speed...lucky

could you type some old movies like from 1980-2000 in txt with your new movie upload? so u can still update .txt file so everyone will know what movies u currently have in your collection.  let me know when u made your profile on moovielive.com so i can check out which movies u have.  it u can't find movies on site then u can have opportunity to add movies to database."
