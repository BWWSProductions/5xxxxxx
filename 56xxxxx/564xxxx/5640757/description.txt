At the lobby, they ask what she is doing here, & Jordin Sparks says she is working on a song with Gustavo, and the guys are warned by Gustavo to keep their distance from her so they won't bring her bad luck. Gustavo & Kelly are also trying to drag a skunk away from Rocque Records, after Hawk Records deliever it as a so-called present, when it is actually a plan to drag Jordin away from there due to smell, & come to Hawk Records to peform the song there instead. Carlos & Logan realize they can't be near her, but they must protect her, but plans to protect her backfires as she tripped on a banana, got attacked by a cat, & fell onto a wishing well, & James & Kendall are seen around her accidentally. At first, Gustavo was blaming them for causing her bad luck, but didn't kill them for saving the studio from the skunk, But then, Jordin said they're not bad luck & she said because without them, she wouldnt figure out the song, & decides that the song shouldn't be a solo song, it should be a duet with the boys, & then they proceed to sing Count On You  feat. Jordin Sparks. Also, Bitters is trying to take embarrasing pictures of Jordin. Meanwhile, Jo is seeing Kendall and Jordin doing things and thinks that Kendall is cheating on her since he and Jo are a couple.

Afterwards, they went back to the lobby to say good-bye & she hugs the guys, & Kendall, but as they are doing so, Jo appears, shocked & still mad at Kendall, she said he might need flowers to give to her.
