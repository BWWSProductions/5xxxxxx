    When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully    
    decides to take his place in a mission on the distant world of           
    Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker           
    Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in     
    order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their       
    rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix his      
    legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military unit               
    spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously            
    attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar"    
    identity. While Jake begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly    
    falls in love with the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel     
    moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the       
    soldier to take a stand - and fight back in an epic battle for the       
    fate of Pandora.
