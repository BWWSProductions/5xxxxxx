,Timmmm,2010-08-22T17:05Z,"Wow, the characters in this show are retarded. 

They're defeated by a microwave pain gun? Wtf? All you need to do is use a sheet of metal (or probably anything) as a shield...

And they're getting gassed in a building with massive windows? If only there was some way to break them and walk outside...

*Sigh*, it's an average hybrid of Cube and The Prisoner (the original one)."
