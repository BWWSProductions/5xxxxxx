 dXb                         Release Notes                         dXb
 dXb                                                               dXb
 dXb     after the nice release of versatile (french label,        dXb
 dXb     running by gilber of chateau flight), stuart li aka       dXb
 dXb     basic soul unit release new single on mule. his sound     dXb
 dXb     is always deep and hypnotic and reminded classic          dXb
 dXb     techno sound. "dancing in my mind" is a beautiful mid     dXb
 dXb     tempo house with strings & piano and the title track      dXb
 dXb     "tunnels" is 90's classic style electro sound. the        dXb
 dXb     highlight of this release "sebo k" remix is more deep     dXb
 dXb     house sound, it's simple but enough for dancefloor.       dXb
 dXb                                                               dXb
 dXb     profile: Stuart Li aka Basic Soul Unit was born in        dXb
 dXb     Hong Kong, China and raised in Toronto, Canada. His       dXb
 dXb     interest in club music started as a teenager in the       dXb
 dXb     late 80's listening to Toronto's independent radio        dXb
 dXb     stations and hanging out in the multicultural city's      dXb
 dXb     thriving after hours warehouse parties where DJ's         dXb
 dXb     were playing New York, Chicago and Detroit based          dXb
 dXb     house music. Working at Cosmos Records store during       dXb
 dXb     the late 90's led Stuart to dig further into disco,       dXb
 dXb     jazz, soul, funk, Latin, Brazilian. During the late       dXb
 dXb     90's, Stuart started Djing various musical styles at      dXb
 dXb     various lounges, bars and clubs in Toronto. With this     dXb
 dXb     wide spectrum of interest in music, Stuart's strength     dXb
 dXb     as a DJ is his versatility.                               dXb
 dXb     Depending on the night and the crowd, he can throw        dXb
 dXb     down Detroit influenced techno, Jacking Chicago style     dXb
 dXb     sounds, Soulful NYC house, minimal European tracks,       dXb
 dXb     disco, jazz, funk, Latin, Brazilian, broken beat and      dXb
 dXb     sometimes even a combination of all these. Currently,     dXb
 dXb     Stuart is resident (alongside Patrick Paredes & Jason     dXb
 dXb     Ulrich) at the house & techno based "Vintage!"            dXb
 dXb     Saturday nights at TOI Bar in Toronto, as well as a       dXb
 dXb     jazz, funk & crossover monthly event called               dXb
 dXb     "Footprints" (with Jason Palma & General Eclectic).       dXb
 dXb     His travels have taken him to various spots like          dXb
 dXb     Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, San Francisco, Frankfurt     dXb
 dXb     and Montreal. Stuart started producing as Basic Soul      dXb
 dXb     Unit in 2003 with his first song "Basic Soul" on          dXb
 dXb     Toronto's Iwanai Music. As with his Djing style,          dXb
 dXb     Stuart's music can swing from lush and soulful            dXb
 dXb     Detroit inspired numbers to jacking minimal beats         dXb
 dXb     (all with hints of above aforementioned influences).      dXb
 dXb     Subsequently he has released music on Left Of The         dXb
 dXb     Dial (Canada), Versatile Records (France) and his         dXb
 dXb     music has been included on a compilation from Compost     dXb
 dXb     Records (Germany). Basic Soul Unit has been getting       dXb
 dXb     played and charted across a spectrum of music             dXb
 dXb     enthusiasts from the nujazz and broken beat crowd to      dXb
 dXb     deep house heads and techno aficionados from the          dXb
 dXb     likes of Ame, Deetron, The Get Physical camp              dXb

 dXb     much more yet to come from Basic Soul Unit. Stuart        dXb
