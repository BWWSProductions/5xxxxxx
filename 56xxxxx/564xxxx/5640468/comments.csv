,r3m0t3lycr15,2011-01-14T13:23Z,dont download this the movies freeze up and all you can hear is the background sounds A4/V1
,zethaaron,2011-07-16T13:33Z,"the quality is great but, I've found in toy story 2 there are several parts that always lag when I try to play them, I'm not sure if this is because they are hard spots to decode, or if the rip is fucked up. CAn someone confirm one or the other for me? Did anyone else get consistent lag in a certain spot? My computer shouln't be doing that, windows 7, dual core 2.1 ghz processor, 3 gb of ram and an nvidia graphics card optimized for h264 hd playback..."
