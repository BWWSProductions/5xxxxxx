[V],Mbb15,2010-06-27T02:08Z,"Keep in mind for the next ubisoft game:

""To clear the minds of the individuals who think: ""Game x was
done fast and this one taking ages"" etc.  The way the Ubisoft
DRM works, makes it so that every game is like a brand new
challenge. What it does do, is offload certain parts of the
game to a server, game then requests those things at runtime.
These parts can be anything that the developer wants."""

Maybe i am not as far ahead as most of you people are and which it won't take that long to even get anywhere in the game since the speed seems too fast.

I liked prince of persia the sands of time and warrior within and prince of persia and which the speed was just right to notice alot without the fast speed.

I wasn't sure why i couldn't get the 3 files to work just yet and i didn't have to put any user name or password in yet.

If you're not familiar with this sort of process you may be better off waiting for the crack fix

When i run the game, the logo comes and there is sound and everything, but after that it's just black screen and i can see only the PoP mouse pointer. I searched google and some guy posted this:

""Open regedit, search for ?AlternateVerticalSyncThreshold?. Unless you have multiple Ubi games installed, it should immediately give you PoP?s registry key. It should look something like Software->Ubisoft->Prince of Persia ? The Forgotten Sands->1.000000000->Engine

Right-click the folder called 1.000000000 and rename it to 1.0.""

1. Start it
2. Start the game and start playing
3. Play the game and get to the closed door with no enemies left
4. Stand next to the door.
5. Enable the trainer with ?Insert? button, and save your position with ?NUMPAD6?
6. From the menu load the last checkpoint
7. Right when the animation starts with the 3 summoners load your position with ?NUMPAD7?

 -Located to the right of the door with the three sand statues is a button; do a wall run up the wall to touch it. This will trigger the wall that it is built in to move forward. Once it moves as far forward as it can, perform another wall run before quickly jumping across to the other wall and doing a wall run up this wall to get to the top.

-Perform a wall run on the right side of the wall before jumping out to the wood column on your left.

-Rotate and jump to the next column before jumping to the wood plank. Jump from here towards the ledge in front of you, remembering to do a wall run as soon as you hit it to pull yourself up.

-Perform a wall run against the wall and then jump out to the golden lever on your right. Swing and jump across several poles before landing on the other side.

-Go through the entryway and wait for swinging beam of spikes to swing all the way back, giving you just enough clearance to roll under it.

if anyone can help with a savegame or tell me how to make that damn door open (i tried the trainer thing it didn't work) I'd be grateful I really don't want to start it all from the beginning :|

I dont know what to tell you...it worked for me and other players who had that problem.I get to the door and press Insert and you hear female sound says activated or something then you save it.Load last checkpoint and while that movie is going you load it and you are on the other side of those doors.Thats what I did."

Can you torrent that please, as I can't got that thing to the site."
,Furious1964,2010-06-28T17:58Z,"AxelHUN's trick with the trainer worked. I saved my position just hanging from the secret and loaded the checkpoint again. Then I hit Numpad 7 and rolled under the door, which was still closed btw. And I was able to get that secret."
,him80us,2010-06-28T17:59Z,"either the game is buggy(THAT IS A FACT)...either the crack.....or both.....during the game i pause and make backups of save files very often.....


at some point...something was missing(a rotating handle)...and i couldnt do anything to fix it.....restart...lower difiulty....and so on......

i just restored the latest backup i made....and start playin (lost 20 mins or so) and 2nd time the rotating handle was on its place....

my point is.....maybe we have different iso files....and some r buggy some arent...."
