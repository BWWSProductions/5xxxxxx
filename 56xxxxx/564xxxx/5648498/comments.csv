,PhilLesh12,2010-06-26T12:55Z,"TvTeam is screwed up.  It lookis like they are using a members only tracker.

Either way, just ignore all torrents from TvTeam, they obviously want to use TPB as their private scene site for their little group of elites."
,asagud12,2010-06-26T13:22Z,"I have uploaded 4.53 gb, and still havent gotten past 99.8% So now im going to stop seeding, and wait and see if someone else uploads this episode."
,JrBirdie,2010-06-26T13:49Z,Im tryin to upload a new one but I cannot load my images from pirate bay for some reason so cannot see the verification code :(
,PhilLesh12,2010-06-26T14:21Z,"@JrBirdie

I don't know if this will work or not, but it's worth trying -- view source and find the img src location for the CAPTCHA image, then load it in a new window, and go back to the original upload page tab or window and type in what you see.

Only problem is, it might reload a new image when you manually download it. But it's the only idea I have for working around the broken captcha."
,topdawg89,2010-06-26T14:43Z,"TvTeam should loose their green skull, if they keep doing shit like this.   This is almost as bad as a spammer in my opinion.  "
,Fred8540,2010-06-26T14:58Z,ASSS!!!!!
,Dutchforce007,2010-06-26T16:05Z,"Try this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5648637/Whale.Wars.S03E04.720p.HDTV.x264-MOMENTUM
