,dixy100,2010-06-23T14:26Z,"22-Jun-10 3:08:16 PM	My Protection	Detected: HackTool.Win32.Kiser.hv (analysis according to the base of suspicious web addresses)	Kaspersky PURE		 Year Key with anti-blacklist crack\Kaspersky Blacklist Crack.exe/clldr.dll

this i found inside the download,
so be very carefull.
please let me know how a keynumber that is already known by kaspersky can be protected by anti blacklistcrack,
please think twice.
just go to 	http://webtrickz.com/how-to-use-kaspersky-free-after-30-days-trial-period/ and yo u can do the same without getting a virus inside that turns your computer into a zombie	
GOOD LUCK	"
,soulman0011,2010-06-23T15:48Z,dixy there is no virus. To those who say there is virus i would say that even kaspersky itself finds it clean. Even if there is virus yet it is worth using cause it enables u to use one of the best internet security products in world. Crack has a system whick cracks kaspersky pure and 2010.
,soulman0011,2010-06-23T15:49Z,Crack has a system which hacks kaspersky 2010 and pure and prevents it from blocking the key
,soulman0011,2010-06-23T15:52Z,I would recommend to all of u to download a fresh copy of kaspersky from kaspersky.com and install it after the complete removal of existing product. This would make ur success certain.
,sandipani,2010-06-25T16:59Z,"thats true soulman it works fine... kaspersky doesn't even blacklist the used key after using the crack but there is no way u can use the bully 
kaspersky for 1 yr after multiple activations kaspersky blocks the updates. The update task takes too long and shows update task failed..
so the best option is to use the kaspersky trial reset crack running the crack every month.
thats the only way u can beat kaspersky thats it."
,iboga,2010-06-25T17:06Z,"hi soulman0011
good job,work perfect...tnx ......"
,mxrswow92,2010-06-25T18:43Z,"works perfectly, I even tried a key that was outdated and it worked no questions asked, well see how this holds up in the next update but i doubt it will fail, great job soulman0011!

5/5           ?????"
,mxrswow92,2010-06-25T18:44Z,"those ????? are supposed to be stars, idk why it came out that way lol"
,soulman0011,2010-06-26T06:20Z,sandipani I think this crack makes pure very convienient i have had no problems ever since i used this crack trial and cracked works the same for me rather i m more at ease with crack and update has never failed.
,sandipani,2010-06-26T16:49Z,"yaa soulman i have followed all the instructions..
and the  crack worked like a charm
but afer 3-4 days the updated takes too much time to complete and sometimes throw the message ""Update task Failed"". after listening u i have applied the blacklist crack again and its working pretty well since last 2 days ..lets see what happens. by the way what about kaspersky pure updates .shall i put the automatic update from kaspersky lab on?
thanks anyway seeking ur help...
i think pure is the best security solution till date.... "
,zax922,2010-06-27T11:18Z,does it work for Kaspersky 2011
,soulman0011,2010-06-28T11:29Z,Unfortunately the crack does not support 2011 but pure is better so u shud b happy
,soulman0011,2010-06-28T11:32Z,Sandipani u can turn on automatic updates without any tension after all kaspersky is always incomplete without updates. It isnt a risk at all to turn on automatic updates.
,sandipani,2010-07-05T12:46Z,"yaa soulman its working flawlessly since last week . i am having no problems with automaticupdates .. but kaspersky detected malware/hacktool in the foem of kiser.exe which i have added to exclusion 
now everything is working fine thanks ..."
,davcutty,2010-07-09T16:57Z,Soulman001 - Thank you for your efforts. I downloaded a fresh copy of pure after using Kaspersky uninstall program to delete KIS 2010. Installed trial version then installed crack. Then deleted trial licence and attempted to install one of the two keys from torrrent - message indicating cant use key with Pure. Any suggestions as my trial license only has 10 days remaining. With thanks!
,DRAGON1001,2010-07-10T00:43Z,Work perfectly.
,soulman0011,2010-08-02T23:24Z,dav u havent followed the instructions carefully do as the crack says and it will be fine
