[T],bitstreeem,2010-06-21T21:31Z,"WOW!  Impressive request list!

EPIC fail on my part except for Project Moonbase  (will load today)...   Let me see what I can dig up on the others...especially The Projected Man. Forgot all about that gem.

Cheers!!"

Sorry!!"

[T],bitstreeem,2010-06-22T05:25Z,"Please let me know how reloading these that are still seeded will help them play better on a set top DvD box...?

some dvd players will not play pirate discs properly,especially the expensive ones..buy a cheap one for $20 bucks they play everything"
[T],bitstreeem,2010-06-22T18:17Z,"Thanks neonrainbow..

There has been an attempt to explain this a couple weeks ago...=)

Ship_Modeler..

I downloaded this a few days back and I never could get it to play in my DVD player. Played fine on the computer, but I was out of luck with my new DVD player.
 I'll give it another try. This is one of my favorites.


bitstreeem..

I would not be surprised if many of these old coded flicks will not play on a set top DvD player. I have only checked them with a computer with a boat load of codecs to choose from. If you really want to play them through a hardware DvD player you might try AVS Converter (available right here on The Bay) and recode the movie using the updated codecs in the converter.

..in addition, this method has worked for me in the past to get some of these ancient rips to play on a set top. 

 neonrainbow is correct in that often the cheaper the player the better chances.  My best player was a $50.00 Apex from Walmart.
