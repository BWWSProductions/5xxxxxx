,fiddlefaddle01,2010-06-30T21:30Z,"Is anyone else having a problem with the 360 reading the disk? I have tried both versions on TPB and they both end up just not reading and giving the open up tray option. I have iXtreme 6.1 I believe, the one right before LT came out. I thought maybe it's a wave issue and I read that LT stops all of those but I used my activator disk which bypasses the wave check and still it won't read. I burn at 2.4x on verbatim DL DVD+R. This is the first time I have encountered this problem."
,fiddlefaddle01,2010-06-30T21:32Z,Sorry it's iXtreme 1.61 not 6.1 as that does not exist.
