,Snapperman032,2010-06-25T17:45Z,"is this a demo?
im pretty tired of downloading demos"
,MarcoAjax1,2010-06-25T18:07Z,which language is this???
,Snapperman032,2010-06-26T18:42Z,"this is a demo!!!
do not fall for it"
,Markolie,2010-06-27T18:31Z,"Works perfectly. 7hour download. Not a demo, not a virus. THANKS!"
,mattest999,2010-06-29T01:43Z,"Ugh. WTH Markolie?!?!   yea, i should have listened to Snapperman.  This appeared to be legit, and all was going well.  It wasn't until 8+ hrs of downloading finished, a grueling, mount/install, and over 10+ gigs of my hard drive space gone did I finally realize I picked a lemon.  Here is what I saw. http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/4875/lemonk.png

I am NOT a happy camper."
,6legcat,2010-06-29T04:31Z,"Damnn I was hoping this was not a demo. Why do people keep uploading demos? I mean you waste bandwidth, space and time for a game that last only for 1 or 2 levels. Logically, that doesn't make sense.    Thanks but i think i'll pass on this; better luck next time. "
,moonpie009,2010-06-29T11:08Z,"hello, can anyone tell me why this won't burn correctly? I'm using Imgburn and it keeps telling that I have a CRC error after 65% was burnt. I've wasted 2 dual layered discs for this."
,Markolie,2010-06-29T15:49Z,"WTF. I'm 100% sure this is not a demo, as I'm currently playing it ().

Downloaded it
Opened it with UltraISO
Selected the big 5gig file
Unpacked it in a folder
Copied all other files over to that folder
Installed the game using installer
Copied over the launcher from crackedcontent into GameFiles map
And then double clicked the crackedlauncher (I renamed the old launcher in GameFiles to LEGOHarryPotter2 and launched LEGOHarryPotter)
It worked. "
,Markolie,2010-06-29T15:53Z,"Btw, my download was called ""Lego Harry Potter"" with 279 seeders and 1425 peers."
,matthupp,2010-06-29T16:55Z,WTF! Demo! thanks for nothing Markolie!
,Markolie,2010-06-29T17:11Z,Matth: Are you doing what I did?
,Markolie,2010-06-29T17:14Z,"Here's what I downloaded, magnet: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:Q7CU7R3CON36GR4PNGFFC4YN4VRRRR3S"
,mattest999,2010-06-29T20:10Z,"Well no wonder it's not working.  We don't have the same download.  The magnet for this starts with 87c5, and yours starts with q7cu  Your commenting on the wrong torrent, this one is a f*cking Demo!  My earlier lemon screenshot doesn't lie!!!"
,Markolie,2010-06-29T20:42Z,"Wth. Anyways, my apologies for that. I hope you understand that was not my goal... The above magnet link should work perfectly. Again, sorry."
,tro1809,2010-06-30T10:16Z,waoooo nada mas a ustedes se les ocurre que va a ser un Demo de 6 GB !!!!!BARBARO!!!!!

,wwebay,2010-07-11T22:01Z,"Great upload, but I got a question, after the Christmas scene the game shut off and gave me a error, please help me?"

,The_Dark,2010-10-05T04:58Z,wait? how do i get the full version of this game?
,megasus37,2010-11-28T02:59Z,"I just wanted to post a comment here to state that I downloaded this torrent, and it is THE FULL VERSION -- just follow the instructions and remember to transfer the cracked content over before you run the game, and be sure to use the correct launcher. It does work, it is not a trial if you follow the steps. Just wanted to backup Markolie on this one since he's gotten a lot of grief for this. It works perfectly, and I enjoy it and will definitely be buying it!"
,lgbagabuyo,2010-11-29T10:37Z,"are the instructions are with this downloads?
coz im downloading it now and i dont want demos
"
,davey25511,2010-12-10T23:51Z,ok im lost somebody please help me i did everything but i dnt know how the crack thing works idk what i have to do when i try to play it says i need a the right cd helpp
,davey25511,2010-12-10T23:59Z,help
,Toxin07,2010-12-18T22:17Z,You know you all should b using Daemon Tools because I used UltraIso and I had to re format my pc because my disk drive stopped working after i used it and i couldn't get it to work. I spent days trying to find an answer but everything i tried didn't work.Anyway this is a full game because im pretty sure that there is no demo this big. and if it is it just means that some assholes went and modded the damn file so that people waste their time downloading the huge file for a few hours because they're fucking retarded and think it's funny.
,gamestoolittle,2010-12-19T01:52Z,"have this downloaded, didnt get a cracked file, was there suppose to be one?"
,galome,2011-01-26T12:30Z,"I don't know is this because of this crack, but when I was playing Year 4 -2 Dragons, the third dragon didn't hit the purple ring as shown in utube wallthrough. Now I am stopped by that stupid dragon. Hope you guys have fun."
,galome,2011-01-26T12:32Z,"I don't know is this because of this crack, but when I was playing Year 4-2 Dragons, the third dragon didn't hit the purple ring as shown in utube wallthrough. Now I am stopped by that stupid dragon. Hope you guys have fun."
,subcage69,2011-02-05T17:48Z,ok so i downloaded this and played it. the quality is awesome and i haven't had a problem until i got to the prisoner of azkaban sequence (year 3). the game freezes up about 5 minutes into the 6th level and becomes unresponsive. i would advise anyone wanting to play the last year (year 4) not to download this torrent.
,fabzn,2011-02-17T22:15Z,totally works!! 100% dnt forget to copy the crack!!! 
,jessemcfan,2011-02-28T06:45Z,"Downloaded! Works fine for me. I have one issue though; some of the lego hair doesn't show up. Like Harry is completely bald and I find that the cats legs are see through, why is this? :|"
,kokosak24,2011-03-02T22:04Z,"Hi, the game works fine but i have one problem on my win xp. When I press F2 in game to turn on the second player the game menu opens and everything freezes so I must press CTRL + ALT + DEL to kill the app."
,amberrae,2011-06-27T16:51Z,"Hey, I seem to have problems after I download this game. How do you burn or mount the image exactly because I'm clueless and then how do you crack it? Oh, and when I install, it says something about the directx or whatever missing....what am I doing wrong?"
,amberrae,2011-06-27T16:54Z,"I may see if Markolie info helps, so if you haven't responded to my last comment by then, I'll try it her/his way."
,amberrae,2011-07-03T19:00Z,"Do you mind explaining your instructions better .Bone? Which part of the game do you mount?

* DirectX
* Docs
* GameFiles
* autorun
* Launcher
* LegoHarryPotter

when I go to download it says unable to find dsetup.dll

Can anyone help me at all?

,GuyB1,2011-07-16T19:02Z,Is there a PS2 version?
,Imagicbear,2011-07-21T20:21Z,"what am i supposed to be mounting?  i downloaded a folder with the crack, a MDS file, a SQL server data thing and a system information.  i have no idea what the hell i should mount."
,amberrae,2011-07-22T15:53Z,Exactly what  magicbear said? How the hell are we supposed to do this? Nobody is answering my help!

,azwtf,2011-09-03T06:01Z,"Whatever happened to game rips where you could just install it, apply the crack, and be done with it? I'm tired of crap like this with instructions that don't make any sense. "
,Naridar,2011-10-19T18:37Z,"I've encountered a problem: when loading a game, it crashes to the desktop saying ""LEGO Harry Potter main executable has stopped working"". New game works fine. I'm using Win7 with a computer that meets system requirements, game works fine other than that (after setting audio to 44100 Hz to avoid instant crashing)."
,sbob1024,2011-11-03T18:33Z,@gamestoolittle check the directory of the disk if not heres one http://m0002.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_lego_harry_potter_years_1-4.shtml

,cutecat42,2012-02-10T16:30Z,"I hope someone replies to this ASAP (or at all). I spent 8 hrs downloading this, and then another 1 trying to figure out how to set it up. Finally I could play, yay! But not for long. In ""The Magic Begins"", you have to follow Headless Nick to the classroom by sending Scabbers up a pipe to have Fluffy scare the Wizard and then you wave to the wizard for him to move the stairs. No matter what I do, the stairs stay still. I made sure I did everything correctly by watching youtube and reading walkthrough's-I even restarted the game. How do I get past this?? Or did I waste 8 hours of my time? 0_o"
,blakishh,2012-02-12T13:45Z,What program should I use to mount or burn the image? The trial for Ultra Iso is limited to 600mb or something. This is almost 6 gb. I'm not paying 30 dollars for something ill use once.
,blakishh,2012-02-12T13:48Z,Duh. Just download it from Pirate Bay. Ultra Iso Premium that is. Fuck..
,Carochinha,2012-04-04T00:21Z,"Ok, guys, I'm feeling especially nice today, so I'm going to tell you what you should do: 

a) Download the freaking torrent;

b) In the main folder, you should see a file named ""avd-lhp.mdf"";

c) Download Ultra Iso or a similar program if you don't have one ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6368410/Ultra_ISO_Premium_Edition_v9.3.6_(Registered__Install__amp__Enjoy) )

d) On Ultra Iso, open this file. 

e) Now, this is the tricky part: In that file, there will be a file named ""LEGOHarryPotter"". Delete it. Now go to the folder named ""Lego Harry Potter"" again and enter the folder named ""Crack-Reloaded"". Copy the only file there and paste it on the UltraIso/similar program. 

f) Save that UltraIso file on the ""Lego Harry Potter"" folder. 

g) Using a program like Daemon Tools, mount the file you just created. 

h) Go to ""My Computer"" and install it normally. 

i) Click ""Play"" and have fun!"
,Carochinha,2012-04-05T19:41Z,"Actually, forget that last point about clicking ""Play""
If it works, great, if the doesn't, click ""Open"" on the game file on ""My Computer"", enter the ""GameFiles"" folder and click on the application there. Sorry. "
,flyerskt,2012-04-12T17:12Z,The Sound does not work on this game other then that it works pretty good
,marcum18,2012-04-25T18:09Z,Quick question everyone. I am receiving an error message saying that I must insert the original disk instead of a backup. Does anyone know how to fix this?
