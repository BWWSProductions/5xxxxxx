,statusx,2010-07-02T13:40Z,Thanks for the upload
,nlzwerver,2010-07-06T09:34Z,does anybody manage to get the maps working. Just like acidas putting the download into sdcard>copilot>maps doesn't work for me.
,dw79,2010-07-11T11:09Z,Just modify the config file (in the copilot directory on your sd card) by replacing all the paths containing NA with by the corresponding path with NA replaced by maps\\Europe.nnWorked for me
,kallekula33,2010-07-14T21:47Z,"Hi, are these the latest maps available for Europe ?"
,tonytoff,2010-07-25T03:03Z,"dw79 please speak english and tell me how to make this work properly.
Your comments dont make sense at all.......

please give me a more precise guide.

thanks"
,maagrapu,2010-07-26T16:44Z,"You will have to run the application once for the user.cfg file to generate. Once it is generated, you can edit it and change the /NA/ to /maps/Europe/. This is how I got it working."
,birutex,2010-08-06T16:21Z,"I've just put the ""Europe"" folder inside the ""copilot"" folder, and renamed it ""EU"". And it worked. 
But i'm using Galaxy S, so i've got space in the phone memory. 

Should work the same way in the Sdcard."

If your prepared to upload something for others to use for free, it might be an idea to include some instructions that make sense all the way through!  

I've spent three days on and off trying to get this fuckin' cunt to work but to no avail!

DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS SHIT, THE UP-LOADER IS COMPLETELY IMPCOMPETENT IN CRACKING PROGRAMS.

Details:

Copilot installs fine, loads fine the first time and you are then able to download a voice for navigation.

The problems start with the maps (the system doesn't recognise them wherever you put them then all other sorts of errors occur; app won't load, displays error codes etc.etc.!

Complete shit! "

,14U,2011-10-05T14:18Z,"I have no problem at all, with this program. I'm using v.8.2.2 .apk on my SG s2, SE X8 and SG S5660. Update and download works great ( even speed cam files)."
