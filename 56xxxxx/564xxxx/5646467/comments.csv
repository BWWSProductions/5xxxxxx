,DrPepper92,2012-06-07T07:00Z,"I'm downloading right now..Old torrent I see.
In that case you might now be active any longer.
If you are and have the time to so though, I'm interested in Ghost in the shell - Solid State Society.
You can put it in the smallest size too or either way I'll download and seed it."
