,FosterVS,2010-11-21T16:31Z,"WARNING!
This ""documentary"" is propaganda by THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY!
The ""Citizens Commission on Human Rights"" is a FRONT ORGANIZATION OF SCIENTOLOGY.
A quote from CCHR.ORG: ""CCHR was co-founded in 1969 by the Church of Scientology""
Why is the Church of Scientologu so down on psychiatrists? Because they believe they can cure any mental problems by joining their cult!
Please, research it yourself!"

They had no choice and I want to see what this video has to say about the medicines and the practice of psychiatry.  While I've seen medicines do good, they can certainly be used for really horrible things.  Thanks _blindly"
,xiIix,2011-03-07T22:54Z,"Damnit why does this have to be affiliated with Scientology? Seriously, this documentary is spot on and now it's going to be discredited because of those crazy fuckers in scientology. This is a case of the broken clock being right twice a day, because this shit is real. I was on meds for a long time, they robbed me of my childhood, and completely fucked my life up. I was a suicidal loser for so long. I stopped taking the meds and instantly it was like I WOKE UP from a slumber and could breathe again. I lost 100lbs, got a job, got a girl, got a new car, got out of my moms house and into my own. I had a life again. 

Seriously, most people don't need to be on fucking meds. It's ludicrous. All you need is to process your feelings and stop repressing them with meds and ignorance. People don't WANT to deal with their feelings because it hurts, so they would rather go numb. I woke up, and it saved my life. Scientology is complete and utter bullshit, but this documentary is the real deal."
,readthestars,2011-04-06T21:58Z,"A lot of the methods and opinions advocated by Scientology are in fact very useful.  The big problem is that people inside the church are brainwashed into believing they need to fork out more and more cash in order to get more and more 'enlightened', or 'clear', as they call it. So take what you need and leave the rest, and stay the f*ck away from organised religion.

If you are bipolar or schizo, this doccie will make you want to quit your meds.  I would never advocate that anyone quit their medication cold turkey, I did it repeatedly with disastrous consequences.  You have to reduce the dosage over weeks and months and watch how you are coping.  I'm on a very low dosage now, but my medication got me through a very rough patch in life and helped to stabilise me to the point where I could work my way back to normal."
