Strange and alarming activities have recently been detected at a top-secret Russian military research base on a remote island off the coast of Siberia. Fearing another Chernobyl disaster, your job as a U.S. Special Forces Operative, is to learn the truth behind the island of Katorga-12, the site of Soviet experimentation in the 1950â€™s that led to a catastrophic SINGULARITY, an event that fractured time itself. Youâ€™ll soon discover this island is at the center of a massive Russian cover-up that threatens the world as we know it. Armed with powerful advanced weapons from the island and the experimental Time Manipulation Device, youâ€™ll fight enemies from the past, the future, and abominations caught somewhere between time and reality. Fight the past to save the future, and Stop the SINGULARITY.
