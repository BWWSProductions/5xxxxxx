thanks brother :)"
,japitad,2010-06-21T07:27Z,Anyone else getting  alot of noise in the audio? I tried the sample and I am getting alot of static in it.
,kmum82,2010-06-21T20:19Z,"Mine was brilliant :) Perfect Audio and perfect sound, no probs at all, thanks :) Good film too!!"
,Freeizgood,2010-06-22T03:18Z,I thought it was great.....ESPECIALLY FOR FREE...I don't understand why some people complain about the fact most of these are not DVD quality....what do you expect when the film is still in the theaters????I thought it looked and sounded great while watching it on my wide screen pc monitor. The writing on things is in Russian but who cares as the dialogue is in English. Except when Buzz gets reset and speaks Spanish (with Russian subs) HA! Great flick ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S FREE!
,JAGACE,2010-06-23T11:28Z,"Cheers mate for the Up, downloading now and i wont bother on A/V coment later because i know it will be fair quality considering its just been released and also its raymondhome.

Thanks :o)"
