,spankdaddyprime,2010-07-02T21:21Z,Do you need the panel themes manager to have these themes work? Would you have that also? Great upload by the way!
,wristband,2010-07-09T03:36Z,"No, you don\'t need the panel themes manager."

,Sagres80,2010-12-08T09:41Z,"the themes doesn't work, do I need to install a specific theme first?"
,Mackolacko,2011-02-08T04:01Z,"Rather late comment but for those who still has the problem with missing stylesheets, do this -

1) Download your theme
2) Extract the folder to your desktop
3) Find the folder the contains just the theme files
4) Move this folder to your wp-installation at wp-content/themes (via FTP) (Or create a zip file of that folder and then use the wordpress installation function)"
,niceworkbuddy,2011-08-17T22:09Z,The Style Sheets are missing on the files. A big waste of time. :o(
,coiboi,2011-08-18T16:35Z,Style sheet isn't missing. You have to go deeper in the map structure to see the real Theme Files.
,jaksmif,2011-09-07T16:32Z,AMAZING THANK-YOU!!! xxx
,JasonTrevor,2011-10-30T09:03Z,"Same problem ... unzip ta single theme into it's own folder but get the ""The following themes are installed but incomplete. Themes must have a stylesheet and a template.""  Can someone explain it a bit more simply? "
