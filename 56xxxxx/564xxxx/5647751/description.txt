Plot: In the spring of 1971 the Rolling Stones departed the UK to take up residence in France as tax exiles. Keith Richards settled at a villa called NellcÃ´te in Villefranche-sur-Mer and this became the venue for the recording of much of the band s masterpiece Exile On Main Street . Stones In Exile tells the story in the band s own words and through extensive archive footage of their time away from England and the creation of this extraordinary double album, which many regard as the Rolling Stones finest achievement.

Bonus Features: Extensive additional footage including interviews with all the band members, footage from Câ€¦sucker Blues and Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts returning to Olympic Studios and Jagger s country house Stargroves where a lot of the early work on the album was done.
