This is a repost of a torrent created by DownWorLD that's on other torrent sites. I did not create it, i'm just sharing it because it's a great tool and great release.

This is a the full install version 6, it works better then the portable v6. Major changes over ImToo v5 are mp3 VBR encoding and nvidia CUDA technology for faster encoding.
