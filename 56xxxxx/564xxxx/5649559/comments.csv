76.74.159.82
208.43.79.148
208.43.79.147"
,Jaymie1989,2010-08-29T02:34Z,"Thanks.

This works perfect.

For those who need to find the file location to block the IP's is here

use the 'Run' command to find it
%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\ 

or locate this file
C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc and edit the 'hosts' file in notepad or something else. But make sure you save it correctly.

Thanks Phatwarez :D"
,gugarl2,2010-09-27T14:25Z,Hello. I didn't understand how to block these ip's. Tnahk you.
,JCass3383,2010-10-23T19:23Z,Or just disable your network connection before installing. Wrks too.
,JonMcGuirk,2010-11-02T03:13Z,"yeah, doesn't work for me either way.  oh well, nice try."
,heroin99,2010-11-02T12:50Z,"To block these ip's (or any ip for that matter) with the HOSTS file method, do this:

Step 1: Click the Start button and select Run. Now type the following text in that Run box:

notepad c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

Step 2: You will see a new notepad window on your screen containing some cryptic information. Goto the last line of the file, hit the enter key and type the following:

127.0.0.1 76.74.159.82
127.0.0.1 208.43.79.148
127.0.0.1 208.43.79.147

Save the file and exit. Thatâ€™s it.

If you later want to enable access to these ip's again, just delete those 3 lines. It worked for me on Windows XP SP3, should work on other Windows too. 

Basically, you have to open the HOSTS file in notepad and add those 3 lines at the end."
,JonMcGuirk,2010-11-03T23:18Z,No idea how you guys are getting this to work - I had already edited the HOSTS file a long time ago and have tried disconnecting from the net.  I run the reg tool but it still shows as Unregistered.  Guess this just wont work for me..  I'm on Win 7 x64 if that has anything to do with it. 
,Originalrider,2011-01-08T22:32Z,"to block the ips go to ""run"". if u have windows 7 search it in the start menu. then type in ""cmd"" on run. from there type in ""ping -f and the ip. make sure theres a space between ping and -f and a space between -f and the ip. once everything is typed in press enter and ur good."
,link4o,2011-01-27T03:31Z,there must be more ip's it still phones home
,xdirc,2011-05-31T13:58Z,"Just for everyone that still hasnt figured it out. If you're running 64bit Windows Vista or Windows 7. you will need to put C:\Program Files (x86)\ImTOO\Video Converter Ultimate 6

In the registration tool. Because its default is C:\Program Files\ImTOO\Video Converter Ultimate 6

Which wont work, because thats the program files that are 64 bit, where as ImTOO is 32bit, and its installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\ImTOO\Video Converter Ultimate 6"
,CirusVirus,2011-08-31T12:13Z,"do this and it will work
OK people Very Very easy to solve the problem!!
first in program folder their is vc.exe program
on win7 create block rule for this inbound and outbound
first step done
second step is to change some reg key
open regedit and navigate to
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\{0BB6C95A-CE6C-425a-84F2-EB211CD1A90A}]
change values for those as you can see
""440D54AA8AF58E3D""=""1A""
""580950B697F5823D87""=""194D31F5CEB1D37DD187""
""481244AA97E58A29""=""1B""
""5E0E54A082F8883F97D844""=""1B""
""5918569797E09F35""=""1A""
and delete all the other keys
start imtoo and see the unregistered is gone!!!!!!!!!!
now if you blocked the vc.exe via fire wall it cant check if the serial is ok so it will not chnage the state of the program back to unregistered
Enjoy:)"
,neoXank,2012-01-03T10:31Z,"D/ling..
Will post 'bout the result"
,neoXank,2012-01-05T16:03Z,"The reg tool didn't worked for me (Win 7) but editing the registry as posted by @CirusVirus worked flawless..
:)"
