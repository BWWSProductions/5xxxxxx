Hi all,

I finally managed to update my latest themes: iTunes, World Cup 2010, Lake, Pure, Nokia Theme.

I corrected the bug at the top part of the Browser, that makes the web addresses imposible to read. Special :thumbsup: to bro ind190 for help.

For the lake theme, I added a iBox icons version, I hope you will like it.

Please be sure to remove the previous theme first, and then install the update version.

Enjoy!

Larsson
