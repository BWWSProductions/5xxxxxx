When Carol (Kate Beckinsale) suddenly finds that her boyfriend's brother (Gary Oldman) is a "little person" -- and so, too, possibly her unborn child -- she goes through some changes. Oldman plays a little person convincingly, alongside some bona-fide little people, with the help of some amazing special effects.
