The great American master of irony, singer-songwriter Randy Newman
graces the stage at LSO St Luke's in London for an intimate concert.
Balancing songs of scathing wit with affecting romantic ballads, he is
joined by the strings of the BBC Concert Orchestra under the baton of
Robert Ziegler.

There is a selection from his critically-acclaimed album Harps and
Angels, including the critique of the Bush administration A Few Words in
Defence of Our Country, and Newman also cherrypicks songs such as
Short People, I Think It's Going to Rain Today, Political Science and
Marie from his impressive back catalogue.
