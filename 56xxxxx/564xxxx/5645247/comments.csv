Use daemon tools or another image mounting program, i prefer daemon but i hear alcoholic 120% is good.. Use Nero Recode and make sure the ""shrink to fit"" is selected. I uploaded it full quality so thats why the file is so big. 

The next uploads will be: Arlington Road, Shawshank redemption. I do take request on stuff i have, so if you have something you want uploaded (2 years or older) and i have it ill be happy to upload it.

For those of you downloading, seriously comment about quality as it will help your fellow pirates discern crap from gold. Cmon it takes 2 seconds.
