,yogaflo,2012-02-27T00:43Z,"Thanks so much Thingy. I appreciate all your efforts. But, I'm new to this and have a lot of downloads that say ""error"". Does anyone know why?

I try re-downloading them and then it asked if I want to add the torrent files to what I have already. I say yes, but this doesn't seem too help much.

Thanks for your help!"
