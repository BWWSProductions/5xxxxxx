,tripplesix,2010-06-27T21:45Z,"Hi thethingy.

I have a few of your cs4s but i guess because i didn't get a production premium or a master collection, i can't seem to use dynamic link.  however, i already have projects saved uder cs4.

question is: if i download this cs5 production premium, will the cs5 applications be able to open my cs4 projects??? please, let me know."

[V],thethingy,2010-07-05T17:59Z,"mohdhadinur the exe is a self extracting rar with instructions serials and power iso, you need the 4 dvd's to install, it asks for 1 then 2 then 3 then support if you need it"

,gjsmoney,2010-07-18T06:22Z,I am in the process of uploading and the install process is asking for Disc #2. How to i get it to load since there isn't really a disc? I'm obviously new at this stuff.  The file is over 6 gigs and I've tried to burn it to disc but no luck. Need some help. Any suggestions? Thanks!

,gjsmoney,2010-07-19T16:42Z,"Hey thingy, thanks for the help. The issue I'm running into is the Iso link & serials you provided only asks for the user and register code which I tried several different ways and can't seem to get passed. I was able to burn 2,3 & 4 onto DVD9s but when it asked for DVD 2, it doesn't recognize there is a disc in my drive. I'll play around with it more and hopefully get it to load."
[V],thethingy,2010-07-19T19:41Z,"gjsmoney, install power iso as a trial or use the free majic iso to mount and it will def work "
,gjsmoney,2010-07-20T05:43Z,"Man, just when I thought I was home free....everything loaded fine using one of the serials. I started up Photoshop and it asks for a serial. I entered one and it didn't work. I opened it with the trial version, closed it and then re-opened and it took a serial. I then closed it and  re-opened the program and it is saying the serial I entered is invalid. Did I miss a step? "
[V],thethingy,2010-07-20T19:17Z,"gjsmoney, you most likley didnt copy/change the hosts file, open the hosts with notepad and check its been edited"
,gjsmoney,2010-07-21T05:11Z,"Well, I changed the hosts as directed, saved it and verified it was changed. I deleted the Premium Program from my system, verified it was deleted, re-started my computer, checked the host - verified it was still changed. Then I mounted disc 1 - uploaded the program with one of the serials and then continued through mounting discs 2 & 3 until completion. Once the program was successfully uploaded and clicked ""done"", I restared my computer, clicked on Illustrator and it asked for a serial. I entered the same one I started with and it failed to take the serial. I tried the same thing with Photoshop & Flash and got the same results. Also tried the different serials and no go. 

I rechecked the hosts and it is still changed. So, something here is not clicking. 

Thanks a bunch for all your suggestions!"
,HumbleCitizen,2010-07-22T03:54Z,"TheThingy can you please tell me if it is safe to download the updates for the adobe CS5 torrents? They are being offered to my via ""Adobe Application Updates"" which I assume came with any of the CS5 torrents. So is it safe to install these updates?"

,Daiquirii,2010-07-24T18:34Z,"Hey thethingy,

I'm glad I have such a great uploader for all of my Adobe needs all the time and I'd like to thank you.  It's like having a trusted car mechanic, except it's for Adobe.

Oh, and if anyone could seed it would be GREAT.

Also thethingy, is there any chance you might upload the full master collection for cs5?  If I could get that I could probably hold out instead of downloading this one."

,Lennyoh,2010-07-26T20:11Z,"Hey thethingy, I was wondering if I need to switch the hosts file I got from your CS4 programs, the file still worked when I switched to CS5 so I was wondering if it would still work with this one."

,asininity,2010-11-22T22:45Z,"Alright, I'm sorry to have to throw in such a a blatantly stupid question: how do I do this? Checked the instructions, but man, I'm totally lost. Sorry, I'm learning how to do this, but man, have I not gotten there yet.

First, if anybody has written up a more in depth for people who don't know what they're doing, like me, that would be awesome! If not, my question:

When it tells me to ""mount the ISO files with poweriso"" what ISO file? Or, more specifically where?

I believe I understand how to do the host files. If someone could answer my first question that'd be great! Thanks for the upload Thingy, and I'll be seeding for a few days.

,SaltSlasher,2010-11-27T17:28Z,"Well i got CS4 from the thingy a long time ago like a year or two, so I came back to see about CS5, cause I got a new rig.
But I checked and if you download this, you can go and get indesign, acrobar X, dreamweaver, and Fireworks from him if you seach his name. The only two things I couldn't find were Contribute and Flash builder. But I have been waiting for his Master release but I am thinking of just getting this for now!"

Q: did CS Live work for anyone??"
,hazardose,2011-06-10T08:33Z,"@TA16 ...your problem can be easily solved. Just

1) copy the ""Adobe CS4"" folder from DVD4 to your HDD
2) remove the ""read-only"" attribute from all the files in it
3) Run Setup.exe and follow the instructions in ACTIVATION & INSTALLATION/INSTRUCTIONS.txt."

You also have a link for adobe clean install...so to resolve the serial number situation when it keeps asking for valid one...I have to change DLL file?

First off, your stuff is amazing! Thank you! 
Okay, so the serials work in the beginning, but when I get to the end of the installation it says ""we are unable to start your subscription for production premium"". I also tried opening say premiere pro I can enter the serial and it works but then when I enter my adobe ID and try to activate it returns that same message. 
Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? "

,kitesarefun,2012-06-26T18:59Z,"Thingy!  I can always install your apps, but this one is not working for me.  I'm running win7 64bit.  As per your instructions  I changed my HOSTS file, then when I start Disc One the serial works but it wants an Adobe ID.  What am I missing?  I uninstalled all my Adobe apps previously for a clean install.  Do I need to install a DLL file somewhere? 

Hope you can help.  And thanks for all you've given us!"
,kitesarefun,2012-06-27T17:27Z,"Ok Thingy!  I got passed the Adobe ID thing.  But now when it got to the final part it said ""We cannot start your Adobe subscription at this time"" or something like that.  Do I need to replace the amtlib.dll files?  If so, where?  I can't  find them on my PC anywhere.  Has anyone else had this problem???"
