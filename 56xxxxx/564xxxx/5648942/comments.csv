,Watatsumi,2010-06-27T09:38Z,bad tv rip. The signal drops out very often and since it's a digital broadcast the whole image turns black with sprayed residual pixelation errors
,Aikousha,2010-06-28T01:00Z,"This is AWFUL, there was no QC whatsoever with BIA's encode.  It is full of unencoded blocks (black blocks) at almost every area where there is bright light or flashes.
My suggestion, go get the HANNIBAL encode.
Shame on you, BIA for letting this propagate like a virus!"
