,uefacup,2010-06-20T21:59Z,hey globeplus give or make a fix so the x32 version can be used
[V],globeplus,2010-06-20T22:49Z,"to the last comments , i only read this now , the true is that i worked the x32 based on the normal pressuposts in the work that i make for the 64bit , because i have 64bits in my computers and that version i really tested and the 32 bits was for the logic , i will go now give a better analysis on the 32 bits and try to understand if is something to be changed .
i will say something in some time , just wait ."

[V],globeplus,2010-06-21T09:40Z,"To coolouf : install the latest directx and for xp use the directx9 plugin , the x11 plugin is more aprropriated for vista and 7 .
With me i can be for days playing with the emulator and nothing wrong happen , the 32 bits it is true that needs a small fix already available ."
,uefacup,2010-06-21T09:52Z,it crashes all the time and i am with the latest DirectX 9
,popitetsuo,2010-06-21T14:17Z,On Win 7 emulator starts but dont load plugins.

Happy gaming and thank you for helping me finding the correct way for this 32 version ."
,coolouf,2010-06-21T21:44Z,i can't find the plugin where i can choose the xbox 360 gampad !!! there was one in the previous versions.
,popitetsuo,2010-06-21T22:01Z,Works very well now. Thanks.
[V],globeplus,2010-06-22T13:15Z,"To popitetsuo : sorry for the before version , i really i nice research work about the normal funcionality of the emulator but i play in the 64 bits version and i didn´t tested too much the 32 bits version but with the comments observating the inconveniences on the version i needed to opt for a more safe version for the 32 bit but not meaning with that that all the new nice things included to give more stability specially to the framerate of the running games wasn´t included , they are included in this new version but protecting possible dlls conflicts that can originate crashes .

Happy gaming !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-22T13:18Z,"To coolouf : i understand , all the plugins for the gamepad wasn´t included , just the more old traditional one but this one works anyway ...
Ok , you think a new 64 bits version with all the gamepad plugins is a good idea ?
You have to forgive me because it was lot of work in the researc that little things like that i didn´t remember to check and was working new games files and everything , well , sorry .
Say something if you want a version with all the gamepad plugins , i will check what i can do in the meantime ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-22T15:36Z,"I analised better the gamepad plugins and the deal is like this : or tyou have all the the gamepad plugins but withou directx11 plugin working or you have only the gamepad plugin you have already but the directx11 works fine , well i think we have to opt for the second option ."
,coolouf,2010-06-22T23:02Z,man i do apritiate the great job you do and blieve me i'm a big fun of your work and i downloaded  many of your games. it just idon't like the configuration of wiimot on keyboard and i find it easier to play with my xbox 360 pad for pc. if it was possible to have dx 11 & the pad plugin it would awsome .
,JMftw,2010-06-28T16:13Z,"Globe, is there a way to configure the GBA controller so that the zelda: four swords would work to play with a friend? "
