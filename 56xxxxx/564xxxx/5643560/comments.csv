This is a porn.

Not a bad porn.

Gracie Glam in:  Calendar Girls 4
This is just her scene.
I'd also suggest getting the Asa Akira scene from the same movie."
,maniac_pro,2010-06-22T14:26Z,That bullshit! I've just downloaded the episode - fully functional...
,zaephyrrus,2010-06-22T15:29Z,This is real deal!
,EbilPhish,2010-06-22T15:43Z,"VLC and some other mediaplayers can play partially downloaded files so its easy to check for fakes without getting the whole thing (although you often need the first chunk).

Some bittorrent clients can also prioritize start pieces of torrents.

In any case ignore afkuser, I suspect antipiracy groups are posting fake comments (although in this case he is probably just an idiot).

I'm watching the ep now (well actually I grabbed it from demonoid, but the filename/size it the same)."
,durwen,2010-06-22T20:11Z,"Have to be fake, Episode 1 of season 6 will be aired 24th of July"
,kristerson,2010-06-22T21:13Z,Legit.
,cooterbrown000,2010-06-22T21:13Z,it's legit. ignore afkuser.
,nyskelo,2010-06-22T21:54Z,"Thanks! It's not a fake, a new shiny episode of Futurama. Enjoy& seed! :)"
,Tecliz,2010-06-22T22:17Z,Thanks!
[T],Pfennig,2010-06-22T23:00Z,"Thank you, anonymous uploader!
Looking forward to episode 2 which also turned up today. B-)

@afkuser: STFU, this is just fine."
[T],Pfennig,2010-06-22T23:04Z,"Also, someone was kind enough to put this on his/her dedicated server, so downloading was ç«¯berfast.
A word on the image quality: That was quite awful with all the tearing known from DVDs. I hope that the ripper will do a better job with the next episodes.
Thank you very much for publishing these. Ahead of time.

,afkuser,2010-06-23T19:53Z,"Sorry... NOT a fake.

I was using VLC Player to view the partial download, and it came up with a porno.

Naturally, I thought it was a fake Futurama episode, seeing how it won't show for another 2 days.

The porno was pretty good too.

I bet it was empty space in the file left over from a previous download"
,mrpras,2010-06-26T18:33Z,"Also
Launch date is June 24"
,mrpras,2010-06-26T18:45Z,"@Pfenigg

It's called interlacing, the encoded quality is actually very decent, you just need to use an app that does bob de-interlacing."
,afrogook,2011-11-22T07:21Z,"I'm going to be posting links to all episodes via my youtube videos. here's season 1
