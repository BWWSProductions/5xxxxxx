Sonic Heroes initially sees Sonic off running around the world looking for 

adventure. Joining up with his friends Tails and Knuckles, who give him a message 

from Dr. Eggman stating that he will take over the world in three days, Team Sonic

 is formed and the classic trio head off to stop Eggman's latest plan. But they 

are not alone on this endeavor, as other characters from the series form their own 

teams to find Eggman first. The Chaotix detective agency has been hired by an 

unknown client to find the Doctor, and they take on the name Team Chaotix. Rouge 

finds Shadow (who was presumably dead) and awakes Omega unknowingly; after a short 

fight, Rouge decides they should team up to find Eggman and become Team Dark. Amy 

Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Big the Cat team up to find Cream's Chao Chocola, 

Big's Froggy, and Sonic, believing this all to be connected with Eggman. The 

player must control their chosen team to complete each stage, defeat Eggman's 

robots, and complete boss battles against Eggman himself, as well as defeat the 

other teams that have formed and stand in their way of finding Eggman first.
