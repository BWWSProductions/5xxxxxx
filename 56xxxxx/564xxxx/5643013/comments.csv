,CarnageHeart,2011-11-09T06:20Z,"@finisher489 - Again with horrible comments I see. Like I said before, actually try the game to see if it works and is real before you go off spouting random crap."
,CarnageHeart,2011-11-09T06:21Z,"Also this is regular Sonic Heroes. There is no ""DX"" ver. of this game as of yet."
