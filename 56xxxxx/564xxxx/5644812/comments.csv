God people need to find more productive things to do than to waste their lives trolling on the pirate bay. 'course, those that do probably don't have anything better to do.

Not going to download this though because I already downloaded off demonoid, so I can't confirm one way or another."

the season premiere was supposed to be a double-episode so this just confused me a bit, i guess they are just 2 totally different episodes"

,Ocegues,2010-06-23T12:57Z,Yeah i liked that we got x2 episodes for the wait the movies were basicly like an extended episode that didn't do anything more for me then what the new episodes we got now did not always length but also quality ^^
