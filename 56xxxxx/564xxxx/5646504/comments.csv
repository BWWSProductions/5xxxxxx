,micool1972,2010-07-01T17:57Z,"neinnum (do you speak swedish?), how did you get it to work on your X10. It won't work on mine. It asks me to, ""Ange ditt google checkout-beställningsnr""
If I push ""hoppa över"" it asks me to ""skapa nytt copilot-ID"", or, ""använd befintligt copilot-ID""

Need some help over here!"
,BePeSon,2010-07-02T10:54Z,"I have an HTC Desire. How do i do for getting the maps into the phone??

The copilotprogram says that i should use a free program on their side.

Thank for help"
,BePeSon,2010-07-02T10:55Z,Can yoy pic some maps or must you download them all?
,woodyuk,2010-07-06T11:21Z,"Many thanks to the uploader,excellent torrent.I have a rooted G1 running Eclair 2.1 and this program runs perfectly on it.To get the maps I wanted I just followed the instructions to download them.All you need to do is connect your phone to your wifi,select which maps you want and leave it to download them.To get the complete UK & Ireland map to less than 10 mins so if you're unsure how to ad maps manually to your sd card,don't bother,just download them."
,knighton,2010-07-06T19:43Z,"It works!!!  Perfectly too.  Not sure what went wrong for everyone else but this is what I did.

Firstly I'm using an HTC Legend running 2.1

I installed copilot on to my memory card as the instructions say and opened it using File Manager (from the Market).  It installed fine.

I opened the program by selecting it from the menu and during the set-up it asked all the usual questions (country, which voice to use etc) and it all went well.  At the end it said there weren't any maps installed and to choose which ones I wanted, I chose UK and Ireland.  I chose the option to download to my phone but as the file was 180mb I used wifi.

It took about 5 minutes and the maps set up perfectly.  I then set up a location and the navigation worked perfectly.

Sorry for the long-winded reply but I'm hoping it might help someone else who had trouble with it."
,dr1chert,2010-07-07T04:21Z,"Just uploaded it to my rooted HTC Aria running Android 2.1. Works flawlessly!
     THANKS rooba10!
       YOU ROCK!"
,dr1chert,2010-07-07T04:50Z,You Sold Me! I'm buying it!
,ninja_rider,2010-07-19T10:25Z,"Installed easily and working on my Desire (2.1) Only question I do have is I had an earlier version on my 1.5 Hero and it gave me Live Traffic and all the other Live features.  On this on I can get Live Search and Live Weather but Live Traffic is grey so I cant select it

Anyone know how to fix this?"
,nator123,2010-07-23T12:49Z,"i can confirm that this version does _not_ work on Android 2.2. It gets a library error.

Testet on a HTC Desire with the leaked froyo (fr91) ROM."
,CederX,2010-07-27T20:54Z,"I installed it om my X10 and it runns, but i cant type in any letters (when i search for adreses). Numbers and symbols works fine but i can?t write letters.

Another stupid thing is when i search for postal code 89242 (Sweden) it doesn?t contain any streets or anything, the only thing that i find is a street on a nother postal code. It doesnt work specealy good with other postal codes ider."
,gorvetka,2010-08-01T08:43Z,will i able to get US maps with this  app?

,sneakypete49,2010-09-08T05:59Z,Droid Incredible. Worked great on 2.1. Will not run under 2.2.
,tgcleader,2010-09-14T11:21Z,Could you please crack the newest copilot cause this worked fine on my drod X then when i upgraded to froyo 2.2 it wouldnt work cause you need the latest version of Copilot which is 8.2.0.280 cause this version eather says code cannot be loaded into the system or it just closes right at the boot screen i cant remember.
,tgcleader,2010-09-14T11:29Z,Update I just checked and what its actually saying is ''Invalid Library'' ''Copilot's code cannot be loaded by the system. I know that is the version not the file its self cause I downloaded a version off of copilot's website but it was EU not North america and  it worked fine but I needed to enter a key so could you please update to the later version thanks and thanks for this one when I had android 2.1 it worked great. But I really need a newer version fast if you can for im going to cali in October and dont know my way around and need this gps thanks.
