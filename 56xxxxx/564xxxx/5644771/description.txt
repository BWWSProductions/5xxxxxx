BBC R3 - Aldo Nicolaj's 'The Ironclads'
Translated and adapted by Carlo Ardito
Directed by Glyn Dearman
Broadcast 1982
Coded at 128/48 from a tape of an AM broadcast
Sound quality is harsh, but speech is quite audible.
I think that the play could have been produced out of doors.

1974. A suburban park in a large Italian city.

A man joins another already sitting on a park bench.
They introduce themselves and converse illogically.
A woman joins in the conversation.

They meet again on other days. Conversation continues
to take illogical turns.

Quite funny at times.
