Yeah ..... there is a difference in resolution

Different resolutions of my uploads are :

720 x 480 ---->  480p 
1280 x 528  ----> m720p
1280 x 544  --- > m720p
1280 x 720  ----> 720p
960 x 540  -----> m-HD or h-HD

Hope it clears things up

,mikecj,2011-01-26T14:09Z,"beware! i don't know what you lot are watching this guys uploads on?! I am watching off of a LaCinema Classic HD, through HDMI to a 37"" Sony TV. With these i am getting poor quality! Pixelated blacks and over-sharpened edges. I will stick to the 1GB+ file sizes, until someone can actually deliver on this kind of promise! Nice try, thanks for sharing, it's close but it's not quite there yet. If only you didn't over-sharpen and lower the export size so much!
let the onslaught commence!"
,stonelesscutter,2011-02-06T17:06Z,I don't understand why anyone would upload a movie in such poor quality these days. Especially with a movie like this that demands top notch.
