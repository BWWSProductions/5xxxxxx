,kdallas2010,2010-06-28T03:24Z,"Can confirm works perfectly on DS Lite running AKAIO v1.7

Also, FYI the US release from SweetnDs did not work for me and it did not appear legit as the icon was a plain white controller icon, not the game itself.  So just grab this release instead."

,hubertoneandonly,2010-06-28T18:54Z,"Works on R4i-SDHC V1.4 (V1.23b)
But not yet on the original R4 (Wood V1.09)
Has anyone made it work on the R4 ?"
,hubertoneandonly,2010-06-28T20:18Z,"It DID work on an original R4 with Wood V1.09, but you have to:

Highlight the game (without starting it) and pick on ""START"" on the bottom right of the screen and then ""File Info"" and ""Settings"".

Press the arrow next to the top bar to get onto the ""Features"" menu and then change the ""Reset in Game"" option to ""off"".

Press ""ok"" three times and you can start the game !"
,cortez_h,2010-06-29T11:25Z,Esto no es parcheado correctamente. Se congela en el arranque con mi R4.
,hubertoneandonly,2010-06-29T13:38Z,"Está trabajando correctamente en el R4. 
Si usted sigue mi instrucción arriba. 
Usted necesitará la madera V.1.09:

,anelvik,2010-07-06T08:58Z,Does it work on R4 v 1.18????
,hubertoneandonly,2010-07-08T18:52Z,"No, it does not work on the old 1.18.nThat original R4 system has been unsupported for more than two years now and many new games do not run on it.nSwitch to the new system made by The Yellow Wood Goblin instead. V.1.10 is now modified for Lego Harry Potter, so it is just \""load n\' play\"""
