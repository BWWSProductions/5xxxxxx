,NoCode0680,2010-10-01T10:13Z,"What is this from?  Pearl Jam hasn't played anywhere in Texas in 2010.  The last time they were here was the Austin City Limits festival and television show in 2009, but this setlist does not appear to be from either of those performances, or at least not a complete version.  Full versions of both performances are floating around out there though, each one was over 25 song setlists."
