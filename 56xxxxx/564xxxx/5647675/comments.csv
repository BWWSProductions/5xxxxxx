,storman_norm,2010-06-24T23:48Z,hey i got a steam account for mw2 will this screw with it or give me a ban or anything thanks in advance
,waistland,2010-06-26T21:21Z,This did not work for me when I tried to move the steam_appid wound not move it even after a reboot and tried again!
,Halosrenz,2010-06-27T07:49Z,i cannot run the game! i can't copy the steamclient.dll from the SKIDROW folder. pls help! :(
,OSiRASE,2010-06-27T13:07Z,"The reason you guys can't move the steamclient.dll from the skidrow folder is because of your anti virus. I believe it is a false positive and your anti virus prevents this. Then again don't take my word for it, it might be a real virus! :D

I can't seem to fully unlock my deck to edit it, anyone know what to do?"
,hygraed,2010-06-27T23:19Z,This release contains a real trojan. Search your hard drive for a file called xxxyyyzzz.dat (it should be in the Temp folder in Application Data or AppData) and open it in Notepad. It contains your email passwords. This is the last time I download a Skidrow release.
,Phaedrus_x,2010-06-29T13:11Z,"hygraed: After installing the game, I did a search for the file you mentioned, and did a deep scan of the hard drive with my anti-virus; both turned up nothing. However you got infected, it had nothing to do with this release."

,SwordS_to_PlowShareS,2010-07-19T11:33Z,"I also had problems with this release.. But after some researching, i finally made it to work on my vista..

Here's what i did.

1. unpack files using winrar.
2. mount image using daemon tools
3. install.
4. since im using vista.. i needed to manually install the direct x. for me to do this. i open my Wizards installation folder, open prereqs folder, open directx folder then run the .exe file
note: you need to find the .exe file
5. explore your mounted cd. then copy all the content from the skidrow folder and paste it to your wizards installation directory and overwrite.
6. launch first the magic launcher.
7. if the launcher was successful then you can play your game now.

if you were using xp with sp3 ( minimum requirement ), you probably dont need to run directx manually and just install it automatically after you install the game by checking the direct x box

hope this helps. "

,doggfatheroli,2010-07-24T06:21Z,"for all those who can't run this game.

,Jazaren,2010-07-24T12:47Z,"The fix basically requires PowerISO. Instead of downloading PowerISO, just do the following:

1. Open Notepad.
2. Type in ""49400"" without the quotes.
3. Save file as ""steam_appid.txt"" without the quotes.
4. Move that file to your Magic The Gathering directory.

You still need to copy the other files over. This probably requires Steam, but it's worth it."

1- am i the only one to have Skidrow as the players name? can i change it? how? (wont cry if not, just to know it)
2- Is it possible when one is playing with a multi color deck to choose the manas to cast a spell? (because the pc chooses them for me when i click on the spell and dont let me divide my manas however i need them to cast others)
Thanks"
,hotojucie,2010-08-12T07:27Z,"@dwarf314
I have SKIDROW as my name also, and all CAPS, haven't tried to change it, though I doubt you can.  Do not know about selecting mana manually either, sorry.
Here is a problem I had.  The first 6 opponents in Campaign mode did nothing but play land.  Also, sometimes the game freezes.  And I cannot do anything.  The first time I tried to get out of full screen mode for a half hour.  Alt-f4, Ctrl-Alt-Del, Ctrl-Esc, middle finger, two middle fingers and a fuck you!  Nothing would work.  Just had to shut the comp off.  BTW, installation was straight forward, no problems whatsoever.  Extract, mount .cue with daemon tools, install, close, copy SKIDROW file contents, paste SKIDROW file contents in mtg directory, run.  Win XP sp3.  Thanks. "
,dwarf314,2010-08-12T19:47Z,"hotojuicie
Thanks, at least i know its not me. for now i havent had freezes nor crashes but im still at the third battle cuz im been focusing on challenge mode, so cannot confirm that. Maybe you could start all over but use the clean crack that i used, the one i commented before"
,hotojucie,2010-08-14T00:37Z,"Talk about finicky.  I erased and installed again, but same thing.  I found that every time I play a match, whether I win or lose, I have to close the application and start again, or the next opponent will only play land.  Also, I turned the in-game volume down to '0' to listen to a radio show and the same thing happened.  Even though I shut down the app the next opponent would only play land.  I closed the app and reopened 5 times with no change.  Then I turned the volume up to 1 and tried.  That solved the problem.  Weird.  @dwarf314, I will try the link.  Thanks. And doggfatheroli, thanks."

,kolayhe,2010-09-01T14:58Z,"Cool thing is, mine worked perfectly fine on Win XP 32 bit
for those of you getting an error, you need to remember to copy over the stuff in the SKIDROW folder from the CD into your MTG directory

for those of you with ""to run this you gotta have steam dll"" you should be getting that from the SKIDROW foler aswell, HOWEVER, most antiviruses pick it up as a false negative, so just go into your AV settings and set your MTG directory as an exception, and E:\SKIDROW\steamclient.dll as an exception too (provided E: is the virtual drive you're using)
once thats done, try copying over the dll again and run MTG-launcher.

if that dont work, you're either fucked, or fuckin stupid"

this is the method I used to install MTG2010:

turn off AV(s).

extract .rar files.

mount the second image, which is .cue

install it in default location
(C:\programfiles\ect..)

open skidrow folder in mounted drive and copy all the cracks.

paste it in MTG directory. replace.

set the compatibility to run as administrator.

re-enabled the AV(s).

and play.
