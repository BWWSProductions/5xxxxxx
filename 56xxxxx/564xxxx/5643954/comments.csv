a iso is a file that works as a virtual disc. You need a program like daemon tools lite to ""mount"" it and use it as a normal DVD. Just google iso."

or you can use VLC Player, just drag and drop the Video-ISO or any DVD-ISO to it in it will run it for you :) ~ http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"

,cristiancaga,2010-11-13T01:52Z,"I don't think VLC is capable of playing this file...bummer it says: ""VLC does not support the audio or video format ""undf"". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this file""

=( is there any otherway I can watch this?"
