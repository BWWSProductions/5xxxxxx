,Guyana82,2010-12-18T01:54Z,"@jrncraig

to covert avi into an iso image, download a program called ImgBurn. Simple to use and very effective."
,Freakstone,2011-02-09T17:26Z,"imgburn isn't going to be much use unless your DVD player plays avis directly. Try avi2dvd or Nero Vision demo, as these can convert avis to dvd format."
,enjoy52,2011-02-26T09:32Z,"C'mon people, AVI>ISO is easy, install ConvertXtoDVD from TPB drag and drop AVI files press burn and out comes an ISO/DVD thats ready to play."
,McNuttig,2011-03-17T07:30Z,DVDFlick is a decent and free way to make and customize your .avi into DVDs and you can make your own custom menus pretty simply and whatnot.
