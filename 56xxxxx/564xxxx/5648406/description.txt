        Oscar  nominees Sam  Waterston and  Tess Harper,  and veteran
        actress  Gail  Strickland  (Norma  Rae)  join  three  talented
        newcomers in this "deeply moving film" about coming of age and
        sexual  discovery  in  rural,  1950s  Louisiana.   Brilliantly
        directed by Robert Mulligan (To Kill A Mockingbird, The Summer
        of '42),  The Man  In The  Moon is  a poignant and bittersweet
        tale Roger Ebert  calls "a wonderful  movie... a victory...  a
        meticulously prepared masterpiece."

        Fourteen-year-old  Dani  (Reese  Witherspoon)  and  her  older
        sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) have always shared everything.
        But when Court Foster (Jason  London) moves in next door,  the
        sisters become rivals as  Dani experiences her first  feelings
        of affection and Maureen finds the true love she's longed for.
        But with love  comes heartache, and  the sisters soon  learn a
        tough life lesson when  tragedy strikes and strength  of their
        bond  is  the only  thing  that will  keep  their hearts  from
        breaking.
