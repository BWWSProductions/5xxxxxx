The final chapter.

This is a high quality, full resolution, high profile h264 dvd rip of Stargate SG-1 - Season 10.  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.

Please seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!!


p.s. I ripped many of the subtitles myself, but also used subtitles that I found online.  I did re-sync and perform spot checks and they seem fine.  However I can't guarantee the accuracy of the subs since I didn't rip all of them myself.  Thanks to those who did.

p.s.s. ATT PS3 MEDIA SERVER (which I use for these) USERS: These files may not work properly with TSMuxer...use the MEncoder engine(default) instead. Also if using MEncoder, if you have problems with audio sync, try unchecking AV/Sync Alternative Method.
