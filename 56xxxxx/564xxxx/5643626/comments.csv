,mercu3,2010-06-22T15:22Z,"thank u!
still seeding season 1-9"
,teqno,2010-06-22T22:38Z,"really sweet to finally get all 10 seasons of SG-1 in good quality, wanna thank you again for this ;D. Just hope that you continue with atlantis as well :D"
[V],meech,2010-06-23T13:02Z,"Wow mercu3, thanks for all of your help seeding!  Glad you enjoy.  I am currently watching Stargate for the first time.  (I ripped these for myself and thought others might enjoy).  I'm up to the end of season 7.  It's a great show!  I'm so glad I discovered it."
,SorrowExe,2010-06-27T17:01Z,"Thanks for these great quality rips, thinking of uploading Stargate Atlantis?"
,ears90,2010-07-30T18:37Z,Note me down for interest in Atlantis too! It's hard to find decent rips out there for that.
[V],meech,2010-07-31T04:10Z,"It does seem that there is a decent amount of interest in Atlantis.  I didn't think there would be since there are hd rips available.  However, 550-600mb high quality dvd rips might be a good intermediary between the 350 low bitrate ones and the large 1.4gb bluray rips.  Right now I am doing Star Trek - Deep Space Nine (posting season 1 this weekend).  But perhaps I will do Atlantis after that."
,ears90,2010-08-01T00:28Z,"There certainly are others, but nothing like the kind of quality you release. I'm replacing my SG-1 rips with yours. Excellent work you've been doing."
,GYpRr,2010-08-27T04:29Z,"thanks, I will seed when done downloading"
,Lars_83,2010-10-08T22:14Z,Please seed!
,Skram0,2010-10-14T06:48Z,"They're grrrrrreat!

Nice quality. Just what I was looking for. Those other TV rips just suck. Thank you very much for this download.

Do you have plans to release Voyager? Even the 70GB+ rips out there aren't as good as what you can do. :) Definitely grabbing Star Trek TNG next. What happened to your Atlantis idea? Do you have access to SGU S1? ;)

Thanks again for your time and effort."
,CakeMonster,2010-11-01T20:09Z,"Mr meech if you could please upload season 2 of atlantis with commentaries it would make my day

There is a big torrent of season 1-5 of âgood qualityâ of atlantis but in that torrent only season 3-5 works and there are no directors commentaries

So please upload atlantis and especially season 2 with commentaries please :)"
[V],meech,2010-11-02T14:08Z,"To view some of my other torrents, goto my piratebay page http://thepiratebay.org/user/meech

Some of my other sci-fi torrents include high quality complete series of: Star Trek Next Generation, Star Trek DS-9, Farscape, and Space Above and Beyond.

Star Trek Voyager is currently being ripped.  The first season should be up soon."
,CakeMonster,2010-11-03T03:00Z,"I understand that you have many torrents yes

But I am interested in Stargate atlantis with directors commentaries especially season 2

If you could upload that I would be very happy"
[V],meech,2010-11-03T12:26Z,"Sorry CakeMonster.  I didn't mean to direct my last comment at you.  It was just a general announcement that I put in some of my torrents.  It just happened to be right after your request.

Atlantis is on my radar, but just not in the immediate future.  I'm sure some day I will put it out.  I just have a couple other shows I want to do first.  Thanks"
,CakeMonster,2010-11-04T04:27Z,"I see and thanks for the quick reply :)

Lets hope the future comes soon then ;)"
,sammaful,2011-03-21T11:03Z,"any chance of a rip of stagate arc of truth and continuum just to finish of the stargate sg-1 series? 
thanks for your rips meech there top class "
,BrentacoN,2011-04-11T05:54Z,"MEECH I created an account finally after about 4years of use, just so I could say how bloody GREAT your Rips are mate, 600ish mb size is just right in my books sweet ass quality and ac-3 audio is mint. Bray rips are arount 1.5gb 3 times the size and you dont really gain anything unless you have a 55in tv and shit eye sight.
anywayz thanks alot bud much apreciated gonna up my monthly internet so I can seed 1-10 for ya for afew months."
,ili2882,2011-06-08T02:24Z,"First of all I need to say tank you for your great Rips.
Second I'd like to make a request.
I noticed you Ripped Farscape's STV PC Wars, so can you Rip the Stargate STV movies
Stargate: Continuum - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929629/ and

Stargate: The Ark of Truth - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0942903/"
,brod,2011-06-08T19:22Z,Thanks for uploading all seasons of this great show!
,history_boy_,2011-06-19T11:42Z,"Beauty - Thanks very meech! Haha. I've had old copies of SG-1 SE1-10 for years and they were pretty terrible in comparison. Watchable, but you know how it is. Better quality IS better. 

I will get the files on the UL as much as possible but I can't promise permanent connection.
Thanks to everyone who seeded, even those who limited their UL rate. It doesn't matter, just means you have to be more patient. (Those who whine about it, please just think how much time and effort it takes to get these series UP on the service)

Thanks again guys 

   (   :"
,ili2882,2011-06-20T17:37Z,"To round up the show I found the STV movies here on tpb
Stargate Continuum
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5833824
this is a great rip 800x450 AVC with 640kb/s 5+1 AC3

not as good but watchable
Stargate - The Ark Of Truth
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4678005
a good rip 720x576 AVC, but only stereo 160 kb/s AAC"
,wraithkelso,2011-07-27T05:42Z,"can we get more seeders right now, the site says there are 40 seeders, but my program says there are only 21 others with this torrent."

I second this."
,katamari94,2011-08-01T03:54Z,"please excuse the double post.
pirate bay doesn't have an ""edit"".

It would be nice to have the sga's in mp4 or avi format the mkv prevents me from burning them directly to a DVD/CD. I have to download a converter to reconvert them and I'm sure I'm not the only person"
,jaffa_baby,2011-09-28T09:09Z,"Could we get some more seeders only running about 1kbs where as the previous season i got running up to 1mbs.. would be good, and thanks to the uploader much appreciated."
,FavouriteX,2011-10-16T08:57Z,Thanks for this!
,thespike,2011-12-28T22:44Z,what they all said..Very good..Thank you
,aylomen,2012-02-15T09:19Z,"@ meech

thanks for great uploads of stargate sg-1, it have been fantastic quality and included subs is nice too.
I see that you in 2010 was thinking about doing Atlantis too. Now all i can find around here is either poor quality, problems with sync or just to big to download (no seeders on the big ones)

Hope you would do this for Atlantis too!"
,illi777,2012-03-23T00:45Z,"Hi!
If someone need SG-1 The Ark of truth.
I share it
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7124109

 And of course all of SG-1 seasons 1-10, made by meech.
 ;)"
,bart1988,2012-07-11T14:47Z,"Meech, many thanks for sharing this. Loved the series!!"
