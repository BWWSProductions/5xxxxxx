This is the self-titled debut album from Clap Your Hands Say Yeah (CYHSY). 
If you don't know them, they're an interesting indie band from Brooklyn, with a sound reminiscent of Talking Heads, among others.

I tried to find it here on TPB, but only saw an M4A version, so I thought I'd make this my first try at posting torrents. Hope it works.

MP3, 128-192 kbps.
