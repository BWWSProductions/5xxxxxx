loaded avs script into vdubmod, tweaked the colors lowering the red, increasing the blue a little also, then slightly tweaked
the green also, lowered the saturation as it was pretty heavy, then was onto the hue slight touch of the made it look a touch
better, then was onto brightness and contrast, slightly changed the brightness, then i increased the contrast to get the black
back to black...i used couple more filters....audio was from a really nice person emailing us it...Many thanks really good job ;)
