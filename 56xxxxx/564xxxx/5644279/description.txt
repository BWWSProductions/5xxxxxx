The server is a legend on Polish scene. The first edition of the work a few years, attracting many hundreds to monitor players. Have an impact on the setting, but above all the climate, which is always on the Apocalypse MU appointed a very high level of play. It is no different in the case of the second edition, which is based on season 2 of the game. Although the server is not new, still come to his players. If you count the 1000 exp arrange everything you're wrong, a little mobs curling, curling a golden monsters make it soon does not unleash the Apocalypse magic MU. Let the server by the fact that he was standing just a few months, some players is up to uphold the interests of a few hundreds, and still no one sets +13 exc. If you're a wimp and prefer x9999, it's not what you find here. Do not be discouraged by the fact that we started earlier - try to play judge and he is like here. Additional trump is that we still have many players online, especially in the evenings. Still thinking whether to try? I do not lose, welcome. Server has a good forum with support EN players.
