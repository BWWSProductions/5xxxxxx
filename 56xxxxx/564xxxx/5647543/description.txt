PLOT
A shortcut through the woods saved a lot of time getting to school, but no kids
growing up in a suburban neighborhood dared to take it. The trail ran within
sight of a scary house with an eerie old man who would accost its travelers with
an ominous message to stay away. Town legend said he was involved in the
disappearances of some kids long ago. Now that some of those same kids are in
their late teens, they decide to find out the truth...
