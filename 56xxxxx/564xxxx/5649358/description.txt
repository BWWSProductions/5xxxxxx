Here Comes the Bride tells the hilarious story of five different people who, while en route to a beach wedding, swap souls after an accident occur coinciding with a solar eclipse. A whole lot of confusion follows when the virginal bride (Angelica Panganiban) wakes up in her godmotherâ€™s body, the godmother (Eugene Domingo) finds herself in the body of the ring bearerâ€™s yaya, the promdi nanny (Tuesday Vargas) finds herself in the old family patriarchâ€™s body, the grandfather (Jaime Fabregas) wakes up in the g a y image stylistâ€™s body and the g a y beautician (John Lapus) finds himself in the body of the pretty and young bride. As each person starts to get comfortable (or uncomfortable) in their new bodies, personal needs surface and desires are realized. Only time will tell if they will go back to normal or if all five of them are even willing to return to the way things were.
