,xlos_crudos4x,2011-10-13T00:22Z,"I have wiiflow,configurable usb loader,usb loader gx. and all of them run this on black and white. I don't mind it. But the video display is some what bad. The lower part of the display is kind of cut off. It doesn't really fit the screen properly..anyway to adjust it?"
,LymphN0de,2011-12-24T11:06Z,I can never understand why pal is so popular... But thanks man. If it black screens on me I'll try patching and let you guys know if it worked for me cause using uloader to force pal to ntsc doesn't seem to work for me. I have an Sanyo HD tv so I guess that's the reason.
,LymphN0de,2011-12-25T03:55Z,"Doesn't work for me, Forcing ntsc just freeses the wii and the remote doesn't respond. Am I missing a cios? Anyways even though it don't work I'll still seed it for you guys, I'm sure I can find a way somehow. Or maybe a ntsc version ;)"

You need component cable(Wii HD cable) for your Wii

1. Google 'Region Frii' and download
2. Convert 'pikmin2.wbfs' to iso (google WBFS to ISO)
3. Launch Region Frii
4. Load pikmin2.iso (not wbfs!)
5. Change region to USA and apply.
6. Burn/Load on USB
