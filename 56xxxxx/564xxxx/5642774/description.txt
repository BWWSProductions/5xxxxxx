About this game:
Part of Nintendo's New Play Control! series of titles of classic Nintendo games remade for the unique control systems of the Wii, this game brings back the first in the Pikmin series with controls designed around the Wii Remote. This second game in the Pikmin franchise improves and expands on the real-time fun offered in the first. In Pikmin 2, Captain Olimar returns to the planet he was originally stranded on, to collect trinkets for his failing company to sell back at home. A new two-character play mechanic has been added, which allows players to switch between two spacemen while collecting items. Along with the new playable character, two new Pikmin types have been included-- large hulking purple Pikmin, and small and feisty white Pikmin. Two-player co-op challenge missions and a competitive mode are also available.
