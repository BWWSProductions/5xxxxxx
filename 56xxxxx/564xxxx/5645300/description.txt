This all-out racer has no rules, no penalties, and a six-word instruction manual: put the pedal to the metal. No speedometer is safe in the super-fast races of Speed! Start off in the amateur series, where you'll learn how to control your race car, take corners, jockey for position, and handle all that acceleration. Prove yourself and move on to the big time, where the action somehow gets even faster on the pro circuit. With no rules of the road, each race is as ruthless as it is fast. But small mistakes can have big consequences. One wrong move could wreck your car and your career along with it.
