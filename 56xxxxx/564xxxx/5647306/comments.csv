,pickleman9686,2010-07-02T00:30Z,the cannot find PhysXLoader.dll problem is solved by running as administrator on Vista(SUCKS) and 7... If that doesnt solve it then you probably downt have physicalX installed(its a graphics program like DirectX) on XP you probably eed to install it

I never really optimized mt uTorrent to work before then after seeing what Skeelz said i did. Before i did i was downloading at 10-15 KB/s and uploading at 100-150 KB/s now after i did im downloading at 1-1.5 MB/s and uploading at 800KB/s-1MB/s  go learn how it works and then you can do this!!!

,SpockNL,2010-07-05T02:12Z,"for me it works all fine. installation when flawless.

for the peeps wanting multiplayer: there is no MP crack. i searched like the hole TPB but found nothing.

game is very decent but the level build is almost the same as the ever old concept gamemakers use: walk trough hallways and shit, shoot creepy monters and after 5 levels u have to beat the boss and then do the next 5 levels and so on.

what i like are the graphics and being able to transform into a vehicle (animation of that is very smooth and good looking)
they even made a space level: be a transformer who can turn into a yet and have a battle in space near a space station.

for more comments: google for a review (tweakers has a good 1 is saw)"
,SpockNL,2010-07-05T02:16Z,"forgot 2 things:
the reason MP isnt working for me is because i c a list of 4 (random?) account names, i cant delete them (the button is gray), i cant make a new 1 (reached max amount of allowed accounts) and cant sign in on any of them (sais invalid username).

the account info is stored on servers of gamemakers or activision so cant delete files myself but i also didnt found any webpage where u can manage them too.

2e thing: sry for my english if u c any mistakes. english isnt my 1e language"

,coreoveride02,2010-07-16T19:34Z,"@desperadoamfrnrntry updating your windows installer, that is what causes 99 percent of all windows installer errors.  this seems to be the case with you since it seems the reloaded teams installer is causing errors for you, most people ignore windows updates and this is the result, of course your windows installer could be corrupted too i have had that happen alot myself.  hope this helps!"
,desperadoamf,2010-07-16T21:29Z,@coreoveride02 tnx for the reply... but nothing :S ndid every upd but didn\'t help :(
,coreoveride02,2010-07-16T21:46Z,sorry for lackluster answer lol i meant reinstall your windows installer with newest network install (offline installer) version. i find this fixes most of probs with installer.  sorry for wrong meaning lol i had just woke up lol
,coreoveride02,2010-07-16T22:35Z,"there is one other possibility, Internet Explorer is linked directly to teh core of windows explorer, you have to have uncorrupted and updated IE to have windows function proper (i am not sure about vista and win7 on this) you could try reinstalling IE or updating it though you should have IE 8 already it might have been corrupted.  oh and make sure you defrag too, alot of my strange probs are caused by frag and registry trash. Eusing is a great open sourse reg scanner."

download x padder and it will emulate a 360 controller...I do recommend buying a cheap 360 wired controller at least for 20 bucks at gamestop

""anyone with video problems with this need to obviously do some updates and if that doesnt work then your computer isnt good enough...set the settings to low and go from there.  If you have an ati 3450 your not in luck you would need a 3850 or 3870 for ok performance, I use 2 4800's in crossfire but before that I upgraded from a 3870 and it still played games on high.  The questions to first ask yourself are..do I have a dual core..can I overclock it?  do I have at least 2 gigs of ddr2 800mhz memory?  if its good I can probly overclock it..do I have a good video card?  if not search on newegg and get a 5770 at the minimum...you can do dx11 and its just over a 100 bucks.  130 or so I think.  Its not that much faster than my 4800 and I have 2 of them..so I can compete both my cards with the new gfx cards..every game exept with max aa or max af but 1080p none the less.  4 gigs of memory is recommended.  try to aim for recommended game settings not minimum..because with minimum your going to have problems."
