,daveandy0,2010-07-01T10:38Z,"It's good quality and only thing that bugs me is the canal tv thing on the top side corner. But, anyways free is a good price, so thanks. "
,hemantstar,2010-07-05T12:03Z,"thanks for share
i like your all post 
Special thanks for great quality"
,umarnawazkhan,2010-08-19T18:37Z,"please check your torrents B4 uploading..
some of them seem out of sync

best video quality for a small file size...
u just need to fix the sync (Audio) on some torrents.. re-check ur torrents

V = 10
A = sounds good but need to fix the time
M = 8
File size = 10"
,RedKing13_ca,2010-09-13T22:35Z,so i guess this is just an upscale?
,bobdevis,2010-09-20T19:50Z,"No its no upscale, it's genuine resolution. Quality is good for this size. But indeed misses a lot of detail en has severe artifacts.
IMHO low-bandwidth HD movies need at least about 2mbit/sec (1Gig per hour) to benefit the high res."
,teirwin,2010-11-19T22:15Z,"Quality is watchable but not HD, fast action doesn't look flawless. 700mb or 1 gig file size would be better, but its 720p which is nice. Too bad its a tv rip which means it lost quality compared to disc rip. It is definitely watchable on 42 inch at 1080p output. Thanks for the good work."
,farcry2,2010-11-21T06:39Z,"thanx............
plz upload I Am Legend......Original Version..............Not the alternate ending............"
,yopepoy,2010-11-29T20:38Z,hey dude. where did you get this. JP series hasn't released on blu ray yet. and dvd can't be a 720p.
,zandre2,2011-01-15T17:43Z,"wow have not watched this movie in ages. Thanks RiddlerA i loved it< im seeding this as of now, thanks again!"
,mikecj,2011-01-26T14:08Z,"beware! i don't know what you lot are watching this guys uploads on?! I am watching off of a LaCinema Classic HD, through HDMI to a 37"" Sony TV. With these i am getting poor quality! Pixelated blacks and over-sharpened edges. I will stick to the 1GB+ file sizes, until someone can actually deliver on this kind of promise! Nice try, thanks for sharing, it's close but it's not quite there yet. If only you didn't over-sharpen and lower the export size so much!
let the onslaught commence!"
,daboblin,2011-08-27T09:57Z,"The quality of the video is appalling. It's worse than many DVD rips. Seriously, don't download this and expect HD quality because you won't get it."
,yusufcool,2012-02-08T09:08Z,"RiddlerA can u upload the 2nd and 3rd part also please

and thanx for this one "
