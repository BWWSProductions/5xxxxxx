[T],ctang,2010-06-23T18:55Z,"@MM: sorry to bother you but i have been following djfred's tutorial that you sent me and i am running into a problem when i hit encode in CCE...it keeps saying ""c:\user\chris\desktop\d2vas\item01.ecl is not for cce sp trial version""...then gives me an error in dvd rebuilder saying ""the encoder doesnt appear functional. aborting...""

you ever run into this error...if not, could you direct me to where you got CCE at, as it appears that it is the problem and i need to get the non trial version

thanks man
