NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Marmaduke

First off sources used.....first 15mins and audio our off a special friend ....thank you , the rest is made up of
russian cam that was missing mins.
The video on the first 15mins is 100x better but contains a major flicker.....the rest is overcropped and looked a little
washed out and has a few issues.
The audio is not too shabby for cam audio...heard alot worse,but hey it's cam so
Worked done......shit loads.The first 15mins needed the angles corrected and resized ..along with all the normal filtering.
The rest of the video ...well needed alot of TLC just to get it watchable
Audio we decided not to filter and just synced  to our encoded video......there maybe be some oos but it ain't easy syncing audio
to a talking dog ;-)

Enjoy
