[T],PeteSapai,2010-07-05T05:06Z,"Hey djsforfun, what's up with this release group SOM? It looks like a normal scene release group (well, the naming scheme does), but they use so many different encoding settings (128k, 256k, using ""--alt-preset-standard"" aka ""-V2"", while the standard has been ""-V2 --vbr-new"" for quite a while -  or just -V2, using lame3.98).
They (and you) do release some quality bands, though, big thumbs up for that! (Except the 128k releases  ;p)"
