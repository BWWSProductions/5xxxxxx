[T],RedHatcc,2010-06-24T20:15Z,"You know for the most part everyone is stuck at 99.8%

Is this in effort to ensure the initial release is seeded good? Since all 600 of us seeders will shortly have 100%, then you will have 600 seeders in about 25 seconds. 

Stuck at 98% guys...... so is 600 other people.

,bwoolverton,2010-07-16T19:57Z,"For some reason the sound plays for five seconds and then cuts out in Win Media Player. I updated Divx with no luck. Does play in MediaPlayer classic. Acts weird in Divx Player, stops after a few frames to show ads."
