Benefits:

 Safety on the Internet 
The bidirectional firewall (network filter for inbound and outbound data) stops inappropriate or malicious access to your computer from both internal (LAN) and external (Internet) sources. As a frontline defense, it prevents malware from spreading or silently transmitting personal data, providing protection against hackers, ID theft, unknown viruses, and unauthorized program activity. It will also guard your wired and wireless networks against eavesdropping and internal breaches. 
 
 
 Preemptive protection against threats 
As a measure of preemptive defense in Outpost software, the Proactive Protection module monitors how programs interact and blocks illegal activity to protect your system against high-level security breach techniques employed in undetectable malware. Certified by all well-known "leak" simulation tests, it will greatly reinforce your systemâ€™s ability to resist zero-day attacks. New! In the latest version of Outpost software, users can define a list of protected items such as Windows and typical web applicationsâ€™ files and configuration settings. Those elements will then be protected against inappropriate access or malicious hijacking, thus bolstering the security and integrity of local data. 
 
 
 360-degree protection against malware 
The lightweight, highly-effective scanning engine combines anti-virus and anti-spyware capabilities to detect, disinfect and remove malicious programs automatically. The technology has been credited with multiple VB100 awards, meaning the software is well-equipped to detect and remove in-the-wild malware. The on-access monitor is constantly on guard against malicious programs attempting to enter or activate on your PC, the on-demand scanner will inoculate dormant threats in specified locations, and the anti-malware will check your incoming and outgoing email, as well as scan USB drives for potential malware threats. 
 
 
 Secure web experience 
The versatile Web Control module safeguards you against the Internetâ€™s darker side. It steers you away from predatory websites infesting visitors with hidden malware and practicing financial fraud (e.g., phishing), prevents inadvertent disclosure of personal information, limits your exposure to unsafe web properties and superfluous elements such as pop-ups, animations and ad banners, plus it keeps your identity private. 
 
 
 Hide your personal files against others 
New! You can set up an access password to your protected information, making files and folders inaccessible to other users on a shared computer. This feature is especially handy to conceal private photos and videos, as well as other sensitive data such as financial reports or installed game folder locations. 
 
 
 Bulletproof self-defense 
In a typical attack scenario, malware or hackers seek to first shut down active security protection in order to proceed with the targeted attack. Outpost makes it impossible to terminate protective functions by "sandboxing", or shielding, all its critical components and making them invincible to tampering. This ensures continuity of protection. 
 
 
 Personalized antispam 
Outpost anti-spam incorporates both traditional spam filtering criteria such as white/blacklists and keyword filtering, and more sophisticated spam analysis techniques based on Bayesian statistical probabilities. It can be trained to recognize what you define as spam, saving you significant time in dealing with incoming spam. Agnitum antispam is compatible with most popular email clients. 
 
 
 Manage activities and events 
You can track past events and monitor your system activity as it happens thanks to Outpostâ€™s Events Log and Activity Monitoring features. Plus you can edit any network or local activity policy "on the fly" or quickly close down any unwanted program or connection. New! As a bonus for advanced users, the new 7.0 version adds the ability to trace registry and system modifications relating to any running program in real-time, so you can collect as much data on its behavior as you need. 
 
 
 Performance-driven operation 
Outpost protection is lightweight and doesnâ€™t slow down your computer; it is even suitable for netbook and low-end PCs. The new version has been improved performance-wise, so you can focus on using your computer productively, not worrying about security issues. The SmartScan optimization greatly boosts subsequent scan speed and overall system responsiveness. New! The new data filtering optimizations yield increased performance of the firewall module, cutting down on usage of processing resources. 
 
 
 Power without complexity 
Whether youâ€™re a security novice or expert, you can easily configure Outpost Security Suite to meet your needs. Thanks to automatically-applied security policies, the user-collaborated ImproveNet platform with constantly expanding knowledge base, the no-alerts Game mode, using a program will be easy and effective, with no additional hassles so you can focus on what you want to do, and leave the security to Outpost!
