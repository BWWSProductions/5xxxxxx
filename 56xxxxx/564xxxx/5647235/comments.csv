Yet I'd prefer to study Mr. ?obaczewskis work in original language. There are some 80 million Polish speakers out there, and at least dozens of thousands of scholars, who are able to work with the language. I do, and I enjoy it a lot.

Will you please give us the Polish original? Will you?

Gute Arbeit. Bitte Sie der Ăbersetzung nun das Original folgen zu lassen."
