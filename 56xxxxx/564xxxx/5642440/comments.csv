,mrluckyman,2010-06-22T04:08Z,"i have a idea why don't u set up your movies collection with site and starting to add movies that u currently have on site so you can link your profile here so anyone can request.  it's moovielive.com :)  i already got my profile with moovielive since like last year or this year im not sure when i signed up so here's my profile but it is not completely cuz i updated my profile rarely, depending on my availability ;)

,Xiam10,2010-06-22T20:19Z,"Hi, since you are taking requests, I would like to ask you if you can share (if you have it) ""When Harry Met Sally"" in latin spanish and ""The Player""? I can't find the first one in my borne language (spanish from America, not Europe) and the 2nd one, I can't find it in any DVD format (just DVDrip).

I'd appreciate it a lot!"
[T],ctang,2010-06-22T21:24Z,@Xiam10: unfortunately i dont have either of them but am looking around...i am thinking of putting up a list of dvd-r's that i have that way it would be easier on people making requests...got a lot of movies so it will be a little while til i get that up and running but its a work in progress
