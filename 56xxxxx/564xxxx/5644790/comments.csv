,EpicAaron,2010-06-23T02:40Z,@DrStoooopid added link to description of torrent showing a video explaining it along with the 200+ people who have viewed it.
,proxide,2010-06-23T03:22Z,thanks
,EpicAaron,2010-06-23T04:15Z,"@Proxide No problem, work for you?"
,patrice_evra,2010-06-23T14:05Z,"Sorry for a stupid comment, but whats the difference between non-hacktivated and hactivated? I have a jailbroken 3gs.
Thanks!"
,DrStoooopid,2010-06-23T19:20Z,"@EpicAaron I appreciate the work, but ""I added a link"" is not an acceptable answer for a simple yes or no question. Self promotion is the cancer that is killing sites like this. Just saying."
,DrStoooopid,2010-06-23T20:21Z,"Might also want to add, that you need to install ultrasn0w to get it to work, even if you're on AT&T. Just installed it. Works 100%. Cydia had to be run a couple times before it would work properly."
,yagbadoodles,2010-06-23T20:55Z,"I will try this FW.. will let you know if this will work. 

Hacktivated vs. Non-Hacktivated
If you have a Official Carrier SIM, you may choose a Non-hacktivated version since you can activate the unit using your official sim, otherwise, use hactivated."
,yagbadoodles,2010-06-23T21:29Z,UPDATES: This FW is 100% working. Mine is now JB and Unlocked.
