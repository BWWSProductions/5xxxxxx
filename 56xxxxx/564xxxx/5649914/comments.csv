No Updates included since the original release.
This is Purely the original 7600.16385 version,
The un-updated Windows 7 x64 Ultimate edition.
Only it is slimmed down with all the unnecessary junk that fills up 11 GB of your disk space after Installation completes.

Kindly read the Description...

,Dflect,2010-06-27T13:42Z,"Thank you, did read the description, but must have missed that. I know when i used eXperience version of xp he did in-bedded (spelling?) updates at the time he made his releases, as he as did disable the windows update as well, but i have waited for a slimmed version of Win7 x64 so i will give it a try, thanks for nice work, hope i will see you do more as SP1 comes out :>"
,freakychokra,2010-06-27T16:47Z,"Note:
The day I made this slimmed version, The first beta of Windows 7 64 bit Service Pack 1 was leaked.
However, I never install any Beta software, ESPECIALLY from Microsoft!!! :P ;)

Hence, that Beta version update was not integrated.
Lastly, the automatic Windows Update was removed.
However, you can download the update packs or patches "".EXE"" files and install in this Windows 7 x64 Slimmed version.

Sorry but your problem is a bit funny!
I haven't even finished seeding it yet!
How could you install it?

My sincere apologies. I didn't realize that the upload of 1.70GB was completed. And that, now there are 15 seeders seeding this image.

However, I did not face that error. It is really strange! That there is some problem with the 2nd slimmed version too! :(
