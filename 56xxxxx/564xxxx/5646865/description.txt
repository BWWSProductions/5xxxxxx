These are ripped versions of the albums "Alchemy" (1985) and "Gone to Earth" (1986) by British artist David Sylvian. Both are encoded in lossless FLAC format. These versions have been ripped from the "Weatherbox" set that was manufactured in the UK in 1989. In the early 2000's Virgin Records issued some shitty remasters that were copy-protected and had mediocre artwork. Then these remasters were re-released in vinyl-replica versions, which did not contain copy-protection, but still were more sound-compressed than the original albums (they contained some unnecessary bonus tracks, as well). The Weatherbox versions are perhaps the best ever released in CD format, as they were marketed before the loudness war campaigns, so don't be foolish and grab them now. 


I am only sharing this material because I know it is very rare, otherwise I won't be doing it. And remember, if you really appreciate Sylvian's music, buy his original stuff as much as you can. He deserves it.

And please help me seed a little, this is a rare torrent and I don't know if many people will be downloading it. Thanks and enjoy.
