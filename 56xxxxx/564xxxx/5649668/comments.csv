[V],globeplus,2010-06-27T21:26Z,"I already played 7 chapters and passed the first boss without a single problem , i think the kittle problems with the launcher can happen but thats all ,next time i invite the critics to do the file for me ánd it was a long wait and the only way to play with normality is with the ubisoft game launcher help with the worked dll helping the main executable , i mean it is not a game that have a single executable that run the game , it is a executable that needs a complementary dll to work and the ubisoft game launcher it is not available on the main game , we get them from other games , i know can be a little borring but making little adjusts on the launcher , if necessary using the defaukt search for more help but knowing that the game is really playable and it is just a matter to find the correct way to use the launcher correctly that´s , that is certainly requesting too much and even using the cracks on the dlls still can be needed little adjusts , not only with my game file , the true is that we have a excelent work with a very pratical file 100% complete that can need like any ubisoft game with drm the correct support from the ubisoft launcher , so perfect executables for this games are not possible but with a little adjust on ubisoft launcher we get the correct complementarity to run the game , so in case of trouble with the launcher is get stuff that help the launcher , using the correct dll until we have the game running , the reality is this ubisoft games can have this little inconvenience but all of us knows that if we get the game running perfectly we are already with luck because is generaly tough to beat this online drms from ubisoft . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-27T21:34Z,"This new comment just to say that the reg file wrked with me in a  computer without any ubisoft game installed but the ubisoft game launcher needs to be in the Programs (x86) folder , with me really work , i wasn´t running the game with the ubisoft launcher missing when i was running the executable and with the reg file i get the executable running without indications anymore , this is true and if the users see possible supports files like this without anyone saying anything is because the uploader have the decence to help the users in anyway possible under the circunstances of the game , showing good intention to help . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-27T22:14Z, to resume the before comments it is just find a way to adjust the ubisoft game launcher folder with the correct dll with the main executable if necessary and then it is just the game to play with normality .
,sarthak11,2010-06-27T22:51Z,Hey I totally agree..I didnt try putting the files in the (x86) folder cuz i didnt have one (im on 32bit) the rip is fine and i love your work..sorry (I guess)
[V],globeplus,2010-06-27T23:27Z,"To sarthak11 : you are right , my reg file wor for 64 bits with the ubisoft game launcher in the programs (x86) , for 32 bits , open the reg file and in where is a wow6432node\ remove inside the reg because the 32 bits don´t have the wow6432node , so in the 6 lines inside the reg with the wow6432node , remove them with  one of the \ in front of the reference , for example the 1st line that is like this :  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Ubisoft] , after the remove will look like this : [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ubisoft]
and so on on the 6 lines with the reference then save as .reg file or just save after the changes then run again the reg but with the ubisoft game launcher in the Programs folder and then it is the same thing as for 64 bits , can´t see why not .  "

[V],globeplus,2010-06-29T14:42Z,"To hiteshbisht16 :  try my versionof the reg for 64 bits or edit the reg removing the wow6432node indications inside the lines with that to use the 32 bits , you need some patience on that but once you skip the problem of the launcher it is full game , i played already at least 12 chapters and no problem in anything , it is many new cracks available too now but i suggest the ubiorbitapi_r2.dll with 945 kb inside the launcher folder , this dll looks like really gives the correct stability , i am using the mentionated dll and it is perfect gameplay all the time , this drm online proteccion games are tough to work and the only way is with this fantastic dll support to the main worked executable to skip the online feature that will make the game crashes without a key , so playing this games can be a little bit more trouble to the afination of the launcher if it the case but what a great work on the dll that simply uses a drm online in a offline way with constant saves where is a checkpoint inside the game , in fact you are simply playing the game offline like any normal worked executable , the only difference is this worked exectable need an extra dll support , that´s all .

Happy gaming ."
,hiteshbisht16,2010-06-29T16:19Z,well i m playing this game now and its working fine thx globe for awesome rip :)
,Cssfreak133,2010-06-29T21:52Z,"@globeplus
Listen im downloading this now, and im not sure if i must download a other version, i always download ur rips and im a BIG fan!
But is this rip working, No Ubisoft launcher, No problems?
Thx!"
,Cssfreak133,2010-06-29T21:54Z,"Btw, i dont have ubisoft launcher installed.
Do i have to install it to play this rip?"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-29T23:35Z,"To cssfreak133 :  you may need depending if you have already configured the launcher with installations of precedents ubisoft games , to afinate or register the ubisoft launcher but if you need that and if you have the launcher correctly registered use the ubiorbitapi_r2.dll included in the file because this dll and i already comproved gives the correct stability to the worked executable , once you bypass the launcher inconvenience if it is the case it is just the normal game after that , i forget to say that the included ubisoft game launcher must be at Programs (x86) inside a created Ubisoft folder , thhen the reg will work , this for the 64 bits version ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-29T23:39Z,"This comment just to say to the 32bits or maybe 64 bits if it the case that is many cracks around or register files to the ubisoft game launcher but no matter what the user choose , i recommend to use the ubiorbitapi_r2.dll with 945 kb that comes with the file inside the ubisoft game launcher folder , for this game looks like a perfect option : absolute normal gameplay with the saves happening immediatly at the checkpoints inside the game ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-30T07:09Z,"IMPORTANT NEWS :  really close to the end confirmed a bug ina door in the chapter 27 but the crack fix from this torrent will solve the problem but only substitute the dll , the ubiorbitapi_r2.dll with 954 kb in launcher folder to be substituted for the dll in the next crackfix with 952 kb and the door bug disappear , i repeat only the dll , the main executable and the gu.exe can stay the same :

,hiteshbisht16,2010-06-30T10:26Z,"@globe

[V],globeplus,2010-06-30T15:32Z,"To hiteshbisht16 :  once you get the launcher working the dll that must be in the game launcher folder is the dll from the crackfix with 952 kb , just that ."

[V],globeplus,2010-06-30T21:34Z,"Ok then start using the 954 kb from my file it works for shore and only in chapter 26 or 27 change to the 952 kb dll , that dll you are using is not ok , can happen more bugs ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-01T02:41Z,"Just for say this comment that i finish the game without a problem with the dll with 952 kb in the crackfix and i reccomend the trainer for the last 2 chapters , they are really more difficult than the rest of the chapters beside some tough parts in the middle but the last 2 chapters have situations that is really no joke , so the trainer can be helpful .

Ok everyone , was a pleasure played this new Prince of Persia , i hope all of you do the same thing .

[V],globeplus,2010-07-01T02:49Z,"The last things that i read in the end was that after the sands was removed and everythin g back to normality that the prince have to return to Babylon to tell what happen in there (this game) ...

Can it be the gameplay of the next prince of Persia game at Babylon ?

Well , that we only know at the appropriate time , for me it is everything and get the launcher ok and the dll from the crackfix , after that it is really just play ."
,hiteshbisht16,2010-07-01T16:33Z,"ok i just finished the game and at the final climb there are some difficult jumps i had to try 4 to 5 times to get them done.
i don't know how trainer helps with jump?? never used a trainer before thou :)
i had to change the dll file coz one of the gates was not opening in the end.
during credits i pressed escape key so i guess i missed the Babylon video :)
the game may look boring in the beginning but in later stage its good."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-02T06:08Z,"To hiteshbisht16 : download the trainer from here (piratebay) or game copy world then run run the trainer and run the game , inside the menu click the F1 key that will activate the trainer then the keys at the numeric pad have special functions depending on the key you pressed , for example in this game the numeric1 key is unlimited health , now how the trainer help you with the jumps ? have a key for unlimited backing in time , so you can miss the jumps the times you want until you ot the coordination of the jumps correctly and that is a nice help in this final chapters , with a little practice with the get back in time key you will get soon or later the sequence of the jumps done without having to return to the before checkpoint that can be borring to execute a difficult sequence of jumps again , to deactivate the trainer just close the game and then close the traiber , that´s all .

I have installed Assasins Creed 2 on my pc, but i uninstalled it, and i uninstalled the Ubisoft Launcher aswell.
Do i have to install the Ubisoft launcher again, then run the Reg file, then it is registered. Right?
And what is this Dll file everyones talking about, should i copy that file, (included in the Crackfix folder) and the Ubisoft Game launcher, or in the POPFS folder?
Thx for everything, could u maybe post me a Step-By-Step instructions of how to run the game?
Thx so much!"
[V],globeplus,2010-07-02T17:35Z,"The basic game is ok , what you need is to have in a folder called ubisoft the ubisoft game launcher with the correct and this ubisoft folder in Programs (x86) or Programs folders , that are the common folders to install games on the computer depending if it is 32 or 64 bits , finally if you have a game with the ubisoft game launcher already installed you probably don´t have problems about the reg but if don´t you can use my reg for the 64 bits or search in the net for regs for 32 or 64 bits , what is important is to have the ubisoft game launcher regged ok and the correct dll in the ubisoft game launcher folder for this game , the game is the game and it is ok always , just a matter to use the gu.exe and the main executable that makes the correct intraction with the dll in the ubisoft game launcher .
