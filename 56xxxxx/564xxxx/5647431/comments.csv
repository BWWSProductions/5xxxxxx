,clasohlson88,2010-06-26T03:59Z,Death ! is not enough punishment for you ! UL old episodes  claiming they are new ones  should be punished by public stoning to death and then a army of donkeys should be forced to urinate on your corpse !

Second. It's a ""new"" episode, consisting of ""remastered"" tapes.
""Remastered"" in this case means you take half of the show called ""underwater car"" (2007-01-24) and remove the paper folding, and replace it with the Hollywood ""spectacular"" crashes from Demolition Derby Special (2009-04-08) & Car Remote Capers. (2007-08-15)

Apparently it was planed to also include Motorcycle Flip (the Flip scene 2008-10-29) but it isn't in the FQM version of the air cast... (Haven't been able to verify if this release has or hasn't that part in it) Perhaps edited for broadcast due to time constraints, and a longer edit will show up. But either way. If you've been watching Mythbusters, you probably haven't missed these when they aired the first times.
