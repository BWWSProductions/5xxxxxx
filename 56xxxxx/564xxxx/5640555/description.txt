With an intricate story mythology not seen since The Dark Crystal, Mark Hicksâ€™ Actium Maximus: War of the Alien Dinosaurs is an ambitious and truly independent sci-fi fantasy film ideal for genre fans, featuring some truly inventive animated special effects.

Turmoil rages in the colony of Actium, as assassination attempts, glitter riots and economic collapse all threaten to destroy the colonyâ€™s fragile government. The maniacal dictator of the planet, Grand-Automaton Polpox, ignores the looming crisis by indulging in the Actium Maximus Karnivale, a gruesome competition where alien dinosaurs fight to the death, much to the delight of the ignorant citizens. Meanwhile, space hunter Omni-Turor Axezun is sent by the Grand Automaton to the farthest ends of the universe on a mission to retrieve additional creatures for the Karnivale. Axezun and his band of poachers find an ancient crashed spaceship, which may be the remains of a dead god. Inside the bowels of the wreckage, they find an ancient riddle that will change life throughout the galaxy forever!
