Author Paul Perry and the team behind Jesus: the Lost Years joined forces to create this spiritually-themed documentary. The program investigates the circumstances belying various appearances of Mary, who has reportedly turned up in various locations throughout contemporary Egypt. Subtopics include: The Miracle of Samia, involving a young woman cured from cancer by the Blessed Mother, with the healed person emitting oil from her hand as proof of her supernatural encounter; The Martyrs of Akhmim, mummified remnants of people massacred by an evil Roman emperor, with the mummies allegedly still bleeding as a symbol of undying faith, and much more.
