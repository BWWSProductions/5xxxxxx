Because nothing says loving like a circular saw blade popping out of a woman's mouth, Machine Girl director Noboru Iguchi has once again teamed up with effects man Yoshihiro Nishimura for RoboGeisha. 

An unattractive girl Yoshie is forced to work like a slave as an assistant for her big sister Kikue, a beautiful geisha. One day, Hikaru Kageno, who is the scion of a steel company, approaches to Kikue in prospect of her high combat capability. And the sisters are abducted by a mysterious organization manipulated by him to be transformed into murderous cyborg assassins. . .
