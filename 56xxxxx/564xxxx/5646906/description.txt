Cead mile failte!  I received a great response from my last mix which made me start work on its follow-up immediately.  I know I've said this before but this is my best mix to date so maybe I should just stop saying that altogether?  I put a lot of time and effort into this one and I think you'll be pleased.  The N.I.N. theme was something I've wanted to do for a long time considering I'm a huge fans of theirs.  Some sick tracks mixed into this one so be sure to have a close listen to Koen Groeneveld, Pleasurekraft and Dennis Ferrer.  Really groovin' mix here people.   

Be sure to check my website every now and then for updates, pics, links and more house music mixes.  And remember to tell your friends! Enjoy the music and keep dancing......
