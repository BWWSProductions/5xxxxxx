,takalaiton,2010-07-04T23:09Z,"rengaard man yuo must be wise...
when i stopped uploading this torrent, there where few ppl at 100 and avail. was abt 10.
 is it really your opinion that uploader have to do all the work ???

 to others, who are there, ive deleted the torrent allready bcos i did some upgrade to my comp ( new mb, pros etc ) but i try to see if i can get it back."
,takalaiton,2010-07-06T05:56Z,".... yesterday i remade this torrent and seeded the missing 0.6% to 5 ppl. none of those seeded to others and dissapeared when they were ready.
im not online 24/7 and sometimes im out of town few days bcos of work, if that makes me idiot like rengaard seems to think, i can live with it. i also dont have hd space to keep these torrents very long, if i want to upload more i need to delete the old ones.

sunny summer to ( allmost ) all, theres world out there ive heard :)"
