Dope - American Apathy - 2 CD Limited Edition


Dope American Apathy (2CD) Limited Edition 2005

Another Brand new Original Torrent of the Kick Ass take
no names Band outta Chicago Illinois, Dope. This time
it's their somewhat rarer American Apathy 2 CD
Limited Edtion set. Some great hard edge rock with some 
new edge style to it I would say somewhere along the style 
of Korn, etc. As always peace out & Play it LOUD!
