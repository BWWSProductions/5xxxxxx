                      PLOT                       
                                               
                                                       
     

        In a  world concerned  over global  warming and  the future of
        humanity seemingly hanging in  the balance Whaledreamers is  a
        story  of  hope,  awakening  and  reconciliation.  It  is  the
        heartfelt story of the return of an aboriginal whale  dreaming
        tribe  from  the  edge of  extinction  and  the equally,  long
        journey of the  whales, not only  to survive the  slaughter by
        man, but to engage us all into waking up in time.

        Over fifteen years in  the making, across five  continents and
        oceans, this is a personal odyssey for British filmmaker,  Kim
        Kindersley in  his quest  to find  his spiritual  roots, while
        experiencing the  extraordinary connection,  both ancient  and
        modern, between  humanity and  the cetaceans.  In doing  so he
        unites four people from very  different cultures - a song  man
        from  a  dispossessed   aboriginal  tribe,  Bunna   Lawrie;  a
        filmmaker from  a distant  land, Kindersley  himself; musician
        and activist,  Julian Lennon;  and acclaimed  actor and  story
        teller, Jack Thompson.
