,jameslast905,2010-06-22T21:35Z,does this use the russian video with the flicker ?
,kepler42,2010-06-30T15:41Z,"TERRIBLE VIDEO !
  - Constant FLICKER ( Russian special..)
  - Image OUTRAGEOUSLY CROPPED ( for instance on the initial ""PIXAR"" animation with the lamp, the P is invisible, as well as 50% of the R
   - Constant blur, even for a TS.
STAY AWAY, this is just a WASTE OF BANDWITH !"

  - yes it has the infamous ""russian Flicker""
  - The frames are OUTRAGEOULSY CROPPED. For instance on the initial ""PIXAR"" scree, the P is invisible and 50% of the R are missing
   - Image blurred, not even a decent CAM

STAY AWAY, this is just a waste of Bandwith, unleess what you want is to grab the french audio to re-mix it with a decent encoding..."

La qualité d'image, mieux vaut ne pas regarder en plein écran. Mais y a pas de décalage son. En tout cas merci pour le partage ;)"
