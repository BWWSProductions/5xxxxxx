,selyo,2010-06-27T12:05Z,"Guys dont just use the ""ubiorbitapi2.dll"" and copy it on the UBIlancher 
this is what you should do.

1.Uninstall ubilanucher NO NEED FOR IT.

2.Copy all the files and i mean EVERY THING IN THE GAME DIR .
3. Enjoy no bugs and no crashes and no doors want open etc............... 



And 

Dont play in a Normal diffuclty

use Easy mode 

if you already use the normal diffculty mode and your stck can open a door ect....

just lower the diffculty 

press ESC and its the forth line 
that should make you game work smoothly 

Have fun "

,MaxCrisis,2010-06-27T16:34Z,"I don't want to sound like an ungrateful prick. But I've started the game over 3 times now, and I keep getting stuck each time. First it was at the baths, second was the baths again, third time is the palace, the place where you walk in with you're new sword and there's three spawner enemies doing some sort of ritual or whatever. You have to press two pressure plates on the walls, then swing from a level that comes down and 'dash' into the enemies ontop. The door never opens. Even when all the enemies are cleared. And yes, I am playing on 'easy'"
,arcdevil123,2010-06-27T17:29Z,"Thx Skidorow.
But i have still one question. Hope someone can help me.  I done everything right. i copyied crack and all.

When i run the game, the logo comes and there is sound and everything, but after that it's just black screen and i can see only the PoP mouse pointer. I searched google and some guy posted this: 

""Open regedit, search for ?AlternateVerticalSyncThreshold?. Unless you have multiple Ubi games installed, it should immediately give you PoP?s registry key. It should look something like Software->Ubisoft->Prince of Persia ? The Forgotten Sands->1.000000000->Engine

Right-click the folder called 1.000000000 and rename it to 1.0.""

,Maris666,2010-06-27T20:04Z,"Just finished it 

and it was amazing!

btw just a few tips:
1.
to change graphics go to the folder where you installed the game and open ""GameSettings.exe"" here u can change graphics

2.
choose easy as difficult or the doors not gonna open its a bug..

3.
you may notice strange framerate drops after you die if you have multipe cards or multi gpu card.. all you gotta do is alt+tab out of game then go back it will fix the problem

4.
for ATI 5xxx owners Must ENABLE VSYNC! or your card will overheat if overclocked"

Download the h4×0r trainer named:

1. Start it
2. Start the game and start playing
3. Play the game and get to the closed door with no enemies left
4. Stand next to the door.
5. Enable the trainer with ?Insert? button, and save your position with ?NUMPAD6?
6. From the menu load the last checkpoint
7. Right when the animation starts with the 3 summoners load your position with ?NUMPAD7?

I've tried it and it's working, I finished the game a while ago :mrgreen: . Btw: the final fight is really easy, It should be harder even on the easy difficulty level."

,real4xor,2010-06-30T15:28Z,"Judging by the comments... lol. Ubisoft really makes crap to crack. 

Not saying they make shitty games, but they just make the games shitty with all their bugs.

And additionally, sure, DRM seems wicked. But from what I read it should massively slow down your game and even cause bugs and glitches only online games are supposed to have. because the damn thing needs a server. 

whatever whatever, Ubisoft games, I will buy never.  They were much better to their clients in the DOS age."

Anyway, anytime you get enough xp for an upgrade, DON'T immediately add something - do the following:

1) wait until you reach a save point
2) add some upgrade
3) exit after saving your changes
4) immediately kill yourself somehow
5) you'll be back at the save point - go back into the upgrade screen and the old upgrade has saved, but the upgrade point you used for it is back! use it again!

Let me know if this worked for you too..."

Yeah, he same happened to me once or twice. Solution I found was to use the Quick Jump (press the direction you wanna go and the jump button at the same time). Sometimes it worked, sometimes don't, but I kept trying, rewinding when necessary, and got out eventually.
I think this is caused by the camera movement."

I have a door that won't open. Yes I'm playing on easy. Yes, I've copied the files to the game's directory.

Please help...

Specifics that probably won't help: It's in The Palace where you need to click a button on the wall on the left, then one on the right, then a lever appears from which you jump+ctrl to an upper platform where 3 monster generators are doing their thing. That room is sealed like a box, even after I kill everything."

,drzn,2010-07-29T19:37Z,"Works. Make sure you download the crackfix! Though it still has some errors. Some doors that are supposed to close don't close and some doors disappear, but they appear when they open so it isn't a big deal. There's some bugs regarding to grapping pillars and wallrunning solid water, but only in the end part of the game.

The crackfix never causes you to become stuck, but you may miss one the puzzless in the end because a big door doesnt close when it should close. It makes the game easier, but I would have liked to complete the puzzle."
,drzn,2010-07-29T19:39Z,One more thing: certain abilities (greater freeze time and double health from vases and fights) were not unlockable.

The problem is, when I ran FS the first time it updated ubisoft launcher, and wants me to sign in. While I have an account which i would register FS to, it also wants me to sign in for the non legit ACII. I reapplied your crack and ACII works again, but now I cant get onto FS, theres a quick message about it not connecting to ubisoft servers, and then it crashes out. Is it possible to run FS legit and ACII non legit without conflict? or perhaps I could get a refund from steam as ubisoft have pissed me off when I asked them for some help (about something else of course, dw), and then download this version and run them both without problems?
thanks for help
