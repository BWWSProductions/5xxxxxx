Synopsis:
Hung and Ann (Pauline Chan and Rena Murakami) are down-on-their luck prostitutes trapped in Hong Kong. Pauline's boyfriend, Sam, (Alex Fong) back in China, who is under the impression that she is away working at a factory, is double-crossed by Billy Chow, and while looking to escape; flees for Hong Kong and winds up at the Brothel where Pauline is employed. He is crushed when he finds out the truth, but by this point, everyone involved on all sides is too deeply involved to turn back. This is the type of movie that could only come from HK. It combines plenty of gory fighting, romance, violence, great rape scenes and comedy, all into one.
