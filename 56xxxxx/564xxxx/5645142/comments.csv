hope you guys like!

see ya!"
,deathbearer,2010-07-08T06:23Z,"anyway, every time you get a game that runs slow.. try first desabling shadows, anti-aliasing, v-sync and post process. if all this dont make it better then reduce resolution and start setting the quality to medium-low. this always worked for me ^^ "

,newmouse,2010-07-25T02:40Z,"I with ATI 5870 & all drivers up to date was going
mad trying everything to get this to run
It would start up & then crash at the 'New Game' Menu.
I have got it running OK by editing the USER,CFG
file in folder C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Local Settings\Application Data\4A Games\Metro 2033
and change the
r_quality_level 0 to 0 zero .
That's the Win XP location, in WIN Vista or Win 7 find it in USERS folder.
You might also want to edit the resolution in that USER.CFG @@@ "

,Tigerslay,2011-02-06T15:25Z,"Heey there i like that you did this but i run the game and than i get an error that says that i need to download the latest DirectX but i already download it 2 times, could you help me?"
,deathbearer,2011-03-27T05:33Z,"@Tigerslay
i think at this point you should have solved your problem, but if dont. try installing evereting from the folder ""extra"" inside the image (ISO). if that do not solve your problem maybe it is bigger than i thought. and you may need to reinstall directx or even your OS."
