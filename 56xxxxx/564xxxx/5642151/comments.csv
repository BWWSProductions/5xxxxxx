,Psythik,2011-06-30T03:11Z,"Doesn't seem to install on my 5230.  I click OK to all the license agreements on my phone, then... nothing.  The Application Installer on my PC just sits there at ""Finish the installation on the phone user interface, or click cancel"", so I have no choice but to cancel the install."
