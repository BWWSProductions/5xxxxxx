    Directed by Enzo G. Castellari (Inglorious Bastards) Cold Eyes Of        
    Fear is a stylish and extravagant Italian "giallo" thriller. Set in      
    swinging '60s London, this movie brings you a dark and decadent world    
    of corrupt cops, vengeful ex-cons, threats, betrayals, fist-fights       
    and feisty femme fatales.                                                
                                                                             
    Motivated by revenge, an ex-con abducts the son of the judge who put     
    him behind bars. The plot thickens as a deeper betrayal is revealed,     
    leading the story to erotic S&M scenes with scantily-clad women and      
    violent trysts in darkened, atmospheric nightclub settings. Cold Eyes    
    Of Fear is a most memorable movie of psychedelic effects, intriguing     
    plot twists, striking shots and stunning jazz score!
