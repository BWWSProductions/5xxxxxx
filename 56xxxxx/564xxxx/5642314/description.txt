Not forgetting PSP-1000 and PSP-2000 owners, Liquidzigong has released Custom Firmware 5.50 Prometheus for PSP-2000â€²s (TA88v2 or less) and all PSP-1000â€²s. So putting an end to all that patching to get 6.20 Firmware games to work. Its very easy to install. From Custom Firmware 5.50 GEN-D3, just extract the CFW 5.50 Prometheus folder from the winrar archive over to your PSP memory card PSP/GAME/ and run the installer.


-"On the release site it says that it was made using mostly Gen. it says to â€œthink of it as Gen-D4.â€ It's very similar."

-"Works for the last PSP game released, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3."

-"After installing prometheus, you donâ€™t need to use the switcher anymore." "All your saves should work."
