Blue Project SysTracer Pro v2.2: trace your system changes

SysTracer is a system utility tool that can scan and analyze your computer to find changed (added, modified or deleted) data into registry and files.

SysTracer can scan your system and record information about:
changed files and folders
modified registry entries
system services
system drivers
applications that are configured to run at computer startup
running processes
loaded dlls

Each scan operation performed with SysTracer generates a binary image file representing a snapshot of your system.

Recording the snapshot usually takes a few minutes depending on your system complexity. You can choose to scan only specific parts from folders or registry, in order to speed up the recording process.

By comparing snapshots from before and after a new program installation or execution, you can determine which files or registry entries were added, changed, or deleted.

You can create as many snapshots as you may want or need, and you can compare anytime any pair of them, having the possibility to export differences to HTML list.

Remote scanning - track changes from network computers

SysTracer have support for remote scanning, providing you an easy way to take snapshots of your network computers.
In order to allow scanning, each computer from your network will have a SysTracer executable installed as windows service.
The management of the entire process is done from a single computer (server) with a SysTracer instance running in normal desktop mode. From this server you will be able to control each SysTracer client by selecting scan targets, sending scan commands and receiving resulted snapshots.
