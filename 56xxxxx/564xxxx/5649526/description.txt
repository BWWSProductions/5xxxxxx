Note: Since this DVD video is interlaced, if you see the jagged lines, you need to de-interlace it. Most media players can do this for you with a click of the mouse. I recommend VLC media player. Using VLC, Video > Deinterlace > Blend (or pick what method you prefer)

I realize that the video quality of this DVD is not 100%. However, I am not the one responsible for making it. I wish I had the original footage to create the DVD from, but I don't. It is what it is.. This is the only one out there. It most likely was recorded from a broadcast and that may be why it is not perfect DVD quality.

Anyway, enjoy it.
