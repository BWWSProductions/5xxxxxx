XVX Unpace the Automatic PACE Unpacker OSX iNTEL - 6.62 MB


In the spirit of true STW, we have decided to release our automated PACE unpacker. Rather than attempt to keep up with minor updates and all requests as 

pertaining to PACE, we're gonna put the power to crack ANY PACE program right in your hands. The goal of this is to free up some time for our next big 

release... We've mentioned before that we wish to bring more than iLok to the community, and now we're going to. In the future, we will be just updating 

this program as needs require, i.e. PACE implements a new version, etc. 

Enjoy this guys!.

unpace is a command line program that will strip away the PACE protection from an executable. Just like any tool, you will need to learn how to use it. 

A complete description and documentation can be found in the man page; i.e. typing "man unpace" at the terminal after install.

We have used unpace for every single one of our releases. It is rock-stable, but not without personality. Take the time to get to know it, and you will 

come to love it.


As part of this package, minihost.app will be installed to your /Applications folder. This program is required for cracking some plugins that require 

external frameworks. Again, more details can be found in the man page by typing "man unpace" at the terminal prompt.


Remember that some apps include custom protection in addition to PACE. unpace will only strip away the PACE wrapper, which should make any custom prot 

you encounter crackable.

STYLUS RMXâ„¢ - REALTIME GROOVE MODULE

Featuring the Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine!

Stylus RMX is a completely new groove-based virtual instrument plug-in for Macintosh and Windows. Stylus RMX is the first product to offer the combined 
power of Groove Controlâ„¢ with Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine (S.A.G.E.â„¢) technology giving users dramatic new control over groove production and 
performance.

Spectrasonicsâ€™ in-house development team created the new instrument from the ground up, with dozens of new features including the ground-breaking Chaos 
Designerâ„¢, a completely redesigned multi-page user interface, a new core library of sounds, all with a focus on realtime groove creation and performance.

New Core library
The massive new 7.4 gigabyte core-library in Stylus RMX has thousands of cutting-edge grooves and sounds that were created by Spectrasonicsâ€™ international 
sound design team, and produced by Eric Persing. The new core library contains nearly triple the amount of sounds originally offered in the original Stylus,
and contains all the original material as well. The new sounds and grooves in Stylus RMX offer a much wider range of modern musical genres than the original
Stylus. 
Mixes of grooves are broken down into individual tracks called Elements for flexibility and infinite combinations.

Also new in Stylus RMX are thousands of new Kit modules, 250 Kit patches, as well as user Kit construction....Users can create their own customized 
multitrack remix grooves and kits, save them into the plug-in, and even share them with other Stylus RMX users on different platforms and hosts. 
RMX 1.5 even comes with 500 new Multi grooves!

â€œXpandableâ€
Stylus RMX marks Spectrasonicsâ€™ first expandable virtual instrument, with a series of five new â€œS.A.G.E. Xpandersâ€ for Stylus RMX at $99US retail each. 
Stylus RMX also can be expanded with existing Groove Control CD-ROM libraries and even REX files â€“ which opens the door for musicians to utilize their 
own audio loops within the powerful S.A.G.E. Environment.

Chaos Designerâ„¢


Of the many new capabilities in Stylus RMX, possibly the most innovative feature is the Chaos Designerâ„¢. 

With simple controls, the user can introduce musical Chaos into the groove, which allows it to have constantly evolving variationsâ€” giving the 

impression that the audio grooves are improvising. The results can be subtle or extreme by setting the simple to use controls. 

A Capture feature allows the spontaneous audio chaos patterns to be made into a MIDI file, dragged and dropped into the host sequencer, 

and played back again for further editing by the user.



Stylus RMX Features Overview:


    * First product using new S.A.G.E. technology (Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine)

    * Realtime auto-sync to the beat so grooves are always in time, even when performed live! Groove Control is always active for optimum sound 
      quality at virtually any tempo.

    * Massive cutting-edge 7.4gb Core Library, with nearly triple the sounds of the original Stylus.
      (the original Stylus core library also included)

    * Expandable!
      Add more grooves with new series of â€œS.A.G.E. Xpandersâ€

      Expandable with Groove ControlÂ® activated sample libraries
