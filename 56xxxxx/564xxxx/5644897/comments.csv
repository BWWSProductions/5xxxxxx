They claim you shouldn't drink tap water because of the chlorine in the water. Then they suggest you drink distilled water with ""supplements"". One of the supplements is a pH ""balancing"" liquid which is CHLORINE based! WTF?

Presumably you have to buy this chlorine based pH ""balancing"" liquid from them.

They claim you should eat as much raw vegetables as possible and stay away from processed foods which is fine. Then they tell you to mix the distilled water with this ""greens powder"". They don't tell you where to get it but presumably you have to buy it from them again. Also, there's no mentioned this ""greens powder"" is an OBVIOUSLY PROCESSED product, having been dried, powdered with additives to extend shelf life.

From their description of the effects of this ""greens powder"" you might as well drink green tea.

Then they say you should avoid all products made from microbial life like cheese, bread, etc.
Then they turn around and suggest you eat tofu which is filled with microbes!

And these examples are just off the top of my head.

That was a wasted 1.5 hours of my life I'll never get back.

According to my own testresults as a trained cell-biologist this is one diet where you have all to win, nothing to loose. And since you downloaded it for free you canÂ´t complain about the prize. "
