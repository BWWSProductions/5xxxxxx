The reason everyone in the tiny town of Ogden Marsh are turning into thick-veined, red-eyed lunatics is because of a major government screw-up of apocalyptic proportions. Seems a plane full of an unusable chemical weapon crashed on its way to disposal, right in the heart of Ogden Marsh's marsh. What starts as an isolated incident â€“ an otherwise peaceful man storms a baseball field with a shotgun during a high school game â€“ soon multiplies, transforming the town's rural residents into murderous sickos.....
