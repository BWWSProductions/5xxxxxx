               R.I.P DENNIS HOPPER (May 17, 1936 â€“ May 29, 2010)


Finding out there's a bomb on your bus (which will explode if the driver goes slower than 50 miles per hour, no less) is never a good thing -- but if your demolitions-expert-in-shining armor turns out to be Keanu Reeves, at least you'll have a fun ride. Jan De Bont's "Die Hard on a bus" thrill-fest has all the stunts, explosions and edge-of-your-seat moments an action fan could want -- plus Sandra Bullock in her breakthrough role.
