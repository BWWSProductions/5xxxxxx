,Barkingspyder,2010-06-24T03:44Z,The Truth About 911?  The truth is that planes crashed into the two towers and the heat from the fires weakened the steel beams causing them to collapse.  There is no conspiracy nor could there be one that would have to include thousands of people as the the nuts want us to believe.
,DieHard911,2010-06-25T23:43Z,"You don't have to bother to listen to the FBI-appointed shills. That is their job - to defend the notion that kerosene could 'melt' steel into fluffy microscopic dust. They get their monthly salary for that. Just got the movie, watch it and make conclusions of your own. Everyone shall be entitled to have their own, independent opinion after being acquainted with evidence. Don't let the shills to dominate your judgment. This movie shows something really unprecedented. Unless you watch it is not possible to explain. But you will not feel sorry for spending your precious time watching it, this is for sure. Just get it."
,Barkingspyder,2010-06-29T20:07Z,"Every claim made by the ""truthers"" has been investigated and found to be false, and based on bad science or misinterpretation of the facts.  I'm no fan of government, but at some point the evidence must speak for itself.  There are plenty of people with no axe to grind who have investigated the claims made by the conspiracy theorists and found they simply have no case."
,DieHard911,2010-07-10T14:10Z,"Yes, it is true that government-appointed shills who called themselves \""truthers\"" only made false claims absolutely ridiculous from the point of veiw of logic. Because they were so instructed by their masters who appointed them to the \""truthing\"" positions. But it does not really mean that if so-called \""nano-thermite\"" can not melt steel into fluffy microscopic dust it is the very proof that the steel was melted into fluffy microscopic dust by kerosene. Isn\'t it? This video was created not by a 9/11 \""truther\"" - so you don\'t have to worry. It was created by a specialist who knows what he says. Just get it and watch it. And you will get the point."
