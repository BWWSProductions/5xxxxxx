Glenn Morrison featuring Cathy Burton - Symptoms Of A Stranger EP

************************************************************************


Glenn Morrison's 'Odyssey', 'Satellite', 'No Sudden Moves' and 'Drone'
EP are still etched in memory, but a new EP is set for reminiscence.
After years of powerful instrumentals and loads of practice on several
top notch remixes, the Canadian producer now takes a deep dive into
vocals. 'Symptoms Of A Stranger' is set to fill your mind with
progressive rapture, guided by the voice of UK's vocalist Cathy Burton.
Fondling trance and progressive, 'Symptoms Of A Stranger' resounds
somewhere between the mesmerizing stars and the deep, dark ground 
trembling on its beat.

Spanish producer Henry Saiz, re-worker of tracks by Way Out West, John 
Digweed and TiÃ«sto, added a unique touch of warmth to 'Symptoms Of A 
Stranger' on his Space Oddity remix, that doesn't let itself be captured 
into the 'prog-house' genre only.

The cherry on top of all this, is 'Triangle & Strings'. An outstanding 
piece of music that takes you in at an instant, riding on a deep 
progressive-trance sound of strings, synths and tantalizing beats.
