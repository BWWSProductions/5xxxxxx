Pay no attention to them ladies and gentlemen. All they wanted to do is mislead you. Give you wrong info and turn you away from downloading stuffs. Use your diligence peeps. :)"

,KMOJR,2010-07-29T02:40Z,"EXTREMELY BAD VIRUS!!!!!!!!
DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!"
,flextm71,2010-07-30T05:12Z,"KMOJR is the only virus around here, don't listen to this idiot."
,Devil_Spawn,2010-07-30T15:41Z,"^^^^

dude that is completly bogus you have to complete a stupid survey"
,lowpriest,2010-08-01T15:48Z,Thank you for sharing! 
,KMOJR,2010-08-03T04:37Z,"So I'm a virus am I.  I downloaded this and it completly bricked my computer, so bad that I ended up having to do a complete reinstall and now am on liux and downloaded it again, so yes the movies here, and its of decent quality, but Ill tell you right now your running  a risk as when I downloaded it the first time this was the source file for a very bad infection, so if your on windows, dont touch it"
,Trammel,2010-08-13T01:01Z,"KMOJR is an idiot.

This download contains an avi file (no virus), some images that do not have any GDI exploits, etc either... and an NFO file that only contains text you can read in Notepad and is incapable of carrying a virus.

Speaking as a professional, KMOJR obviously knows f*ck-all about computers or is attempting to scaremonger people into not downloading a perfectly good movie."
,KMOJR,2010-08-13T07:48Z,"All I can base my comments on is the fact that I downloaded this torrent, and while downloading my virus scan went crazy.  Eventually I was able to get a handle on it, but not before irreprible damage was done to my system.   Again, after reading through the responses to my comments, I gave it another try, and yes, I didnt have any problems the second time, and the quality was quite decent for a cam.  I just felt it prudent to make the comment because of my bad experience, which I felt was likey due to this file, as it was among the infection sites, and it happened while I was downloading it."
,12scrappydappydo,2010-08-17T22:22Z,"Right this may be a stupid question but would it be possible to take 2 copys of any film, 1 with decent vid and the other with decent audio and use a program like flick to blend them togeather anyway thanks for the upload will coment shortly"
,12scrappydappydo,2010-08-18T20:13Z,I found it unwatchable but my wife said she could watch it would rate it about V5/A4 which is to be expected for a cam so if you dont mind lossing quality then Feel Free
,bpin85,2010-08-20T03:54Z,"@KMORJ

Virus or no virus...you may wanna look up the term ""bricked"". Bricking any hardware requires that piece of hardware to have firmware...which your computer does not. And generally hardware that is considered bricked is typically not recoverable especially not as easily as reinstalling software to it....Just a heads up!"
,KMOJR,2010-08-26T23:52Z,"Granted, bad choice of words.  It just came down to losing too many vital windows components and having to do a fresh install, which I didnt have a backup disc for.  Your right though, it was a bad choice of words, I appologize"
,webley,2010-09-13T13:01Z,"I downloaded this a week or so ago and I was told it it was a virus too Avast took it off my laptop without even letting me open it !
I'm not tring to scare anyone into not downloading it but it didn't work for me :o( "
,ableelephant,2010-09-15T20:36Z,"The video quality is great, for a cam at least.
But the sound quality is TERRIBLE. Echoing, high bass, washed-out audio. I got about 15 minutes in before I closed out smplayer because I couldn't hear half of what anyone was saying due to the audio. I tried playing around with some of the audio settings to see if there was someway to improve the audio, but it sill sucked.

As I said, the video quality is great, but unless you have some subtitle track for this... avoid.

V: 7 (for a cam)
A: 3 (for a cam... which is saying a LOT)"
