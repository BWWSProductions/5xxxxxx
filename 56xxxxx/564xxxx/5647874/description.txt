The 1999 release Universal Masters Collection is a generous collection of 20 Chuck Berry Chess sides, including all classics apart from the hit "My Ding-A-Ling." Apart from that, this is a virtual roll call of Berry's best, containing both hits and excellent singles that didn't go quite as far on the charts but were just as good. - All Music Guide
