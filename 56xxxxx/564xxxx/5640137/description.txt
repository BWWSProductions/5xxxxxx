'Red Dog Speaks' follows 2008's 'The Blues Rolls On, ' which earned him a Grammy nomination and four 2009 Blues Music Award nominations. 'Red Dog Speaks' features five new Bishop originals plus songs by Jimmy Cliff, Otis Spann, Leroy Carr, and others.

The title track tells the story of his '59 Gibson Stereo ES 345 guitar, nicknamed "Red Dog." The album proves full of hooks and humor as well, such as on Bishop's "Fat And Sassy." Buckwheat Zydeco lends his accordion to "Blues Cruise" which also features excellent guitar work by Tommy Castro and Ronnie Baker Brooks; the track was recorded live on the high seas. The traditional gospel tune "His Eye Is On The Sparrow" gets the Bishop slide treatment. He plays solo on "Clean Livin', " a reflection on his younger lifestyle and a highlight of the album.

Bishop is a slide guitar great with 45-years of blues under his belt. Rolling Stone has praised his "careening slide and razor-edged bursts, all delivered with unflagging enthusiasm and wit." He is a founding member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and recorded three groundbreaking albums with the group. After launching a solo career, Bishop's 1976 single "Fooled Around and Fell In Love, " still in heavy rotation on classic rock radio, reached number three on Billboard's Pop Singles chart, pushing the album 'Struttin' My Stuff' to number 18 on the Pop Albums chart. He has performed on recordings by John Lee Hooker, Bo Diddley, and The Allman Brothers Band, among many others. On stage, he's wielded his guitar to accompany the likes of John Lee Hooker, Jimi Hendrix, Big Joe Williams, Little Walter, Junior Wells, Albert Collins, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes and many others. Blues Revue has called Bishop "head and shoulders - and slide guitar - above the rest."
