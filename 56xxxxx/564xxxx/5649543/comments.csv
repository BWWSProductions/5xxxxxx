,p2pPirate,2010-06-27T18:20Z,FULL GAME (NO LANGUAGES/NO MULTIPLAYER) logicaly how can it be full game when you just said that you removed these files? ;DDD
,motley666,2010-06-27T20:25Z,"You couldn't play online anyway, so this is full game p2pPirate."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-27T21:45Z,"To p2ppirate : i  think that is omehing wrong with you , at least you are showing that you don´t have the correct analysis about what´s going on in the torrents games :  what you can expect in the torrent games is the single player mode in at least 1 language and everybody knows that the multiplayers in the games are very complicate to acced and play and many times without buying a real copy you simply don´t have a way to get a valid key to use the multiplayer part of the game , so a more ponderate observation about the games in the torrent files is reccomended before saying thongs like that , the single player mode of the game is complete and 1 language is available , why is not a full game then ? is anything that you need to play missing ? no , i don´t think so . thank you ."

,hiteshbisht16,2010-06-30T15:27Z,"ok i played the game on windows 7 32 bit and its working fine but there is only one problem that it is low sound.
its really hard to hear the sounds in the game sepically the voice.I don't know how to solve this problem :("

[V],globeplus,2010-06-30T16:02Z,"CONFIRMED !!! The presented fix in the before link really fix the sound issue .

Happy gaming ."
,hiteshbisht16,2010-06-30T19:23Z,"thx globe !!!
the sound problem is fixed now 
all i had to do was to go in mixer and increase singularity volume to 100% now sound is loud and clear.
funny thing is that winamp was on when i started the game and even its volume was decreased by around 80% :D"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-30T23:16Z,"To hiteshbisht16 : that is the particularity that makes the low sound happen , the game uses the regular mixer that have instructions in some circnstances originaly to reduce the sound in 80% ."
,ThuyDez,2010-07-01T11:22Z,We'll just have to hope that Garena or some other Through-LAN hosting program adds Singularity to its play-list some day :)
,vj-ulez,2010-07-01T13:11Z,"100% working, thanks.. I followed the procedure in instructions but i faced an issue of the game crashing before launch.I looked up at the instructions once again and did an update to the latest graphic card drivers & it worked! Thanks to uploader and seeders. Happy Gaming.. gonna buy the game soon.."
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-02T13:57Z,"@ globeplus

Thanks for the upload. The game works great but i am facing one problem. In the menu and the game, it runs fine for about 10 secs and then freezes for 3 secs and this happens throughout the game. In the link you had given to fix the errors the heading had freezing issue but in the contents there is no freezing issue. I have fully updated graphics card drivers, physx and directx. My specs are the following - 

Processor - Intel Core 2 Quad Q8400
RAM - 2GB
Graphics Card - Geforce 9400GT, 1GB

The geforce 9400 is not supported. but according to nvidia the 9400 and 9400GT are two different cards. The graphics are great but the game freezes. Is it because of my graphics card? Will increasing to 4GB RAM help?"
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-02T14:03Z,"^^^^^

I have WIndows 7 Ultimate 32-bit"

im having the same problem as him/her, i tried running the file as admin but it still didnt work.. anyone have any ideas?"
,vj-ulez,2010-07-02T16:48Z,"I mentioned in my earlier post that it worked fine after graphic driver updates (the pc was q8400,gtx260) but on my other pc (phenom2 and HD4890) it does not work. the .exe crashes right after clicking on it.. im using 10.6 Catalyst driver. any help any one? "
[V],globeplus,2010-07-02T17:45Z,"Search the net for tips for the specific mentionated errors , we all know that can be pages of errors for really nice games and that for buyers of real copys beside that i recommend to download the latest drivers ."
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-02T17:50Z,"@ notforlonger 

If your game crashes to desktop, update your graphic card drivers, reinstall DirectX and PhysX. If the problem persists, try running the game from the shortcut, not from the game folder executable.

If it doesn't work, then try running it in compatibility mode fow win XP SP2.

@ anyone
can anyone help me solve my problem (see above comments)"
,notforlonger,2010-07-02T17:55Z,"helo globeplus it's nice to see you here supporting us like this.. 

anyway, i've already tried checking all over the internet (which basically is just google), and found only 1 site talking about this error.. anyway, i checked the site and it says to run the game as admin, and run it using windows XP service pack 2 compatibility mode.. i did it, but the game still wont run.. im using the latest ATI driver, and latest DirectX installed.. so... any idea what's wrong?"
,notforlonger,2010-07-02T17:56Z,"@naruto: nope, the game doesnt even start.. it just loads for a while then nothing, no intro movie, no ""Activision logo"" etc etc.. nothing."
,notforlonger,2010-07-02T17:58Z,"@naruto: nope, the game doesnt even start.. no intro movie, no ""activision"" logo.. no anything.."
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-02T18:01Z,"@ notforlonger 
vj-ulez said that it didn't work on his amd rig. Maybe the game has some problem with ati drivers. I think nvidia's are working fine. If you are using windows 7 and have a dual boot configuration with xp, try in that.
I hope it works for you and for me. If not then maybe we have to download the full 6.62GB version of the game."
,notforlonger,2010-07-02T18:04Z,"haha yeah, though if this happens because im using ATI card i doubt the situation will change even if i download the proper release. "
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-02T18:17Z,"@ notforlonger 
well in AiTB's upload comments, it was working fine for people having ati cards.
One also has a problem like me.
Which card do you have exactly?"
,notforlonger,2010-07-02T18:35Z,"i read aitb's release comments too but didnt find anyone saying they have it working on ATI card.. i have found one guy saying to install the latest 
NVIDIA physX driver, maybe you can try that..

um.. i have ATI HD radeon 4570.."
,uni3que,2010-07-03T08:14Z,is it xbox360 controller compatible?
,vj-ulez,2010-07-03T09:29Z,damn people.. me too think the full release also wud have same probs with ati cards... searching for a work around... do post if ppl with ati cards get it working.. 
,xx1upxx,2010-07-03T19:03Z,"I got the reloaded game to work on a win 7 64bit with a ATI card, but was having trouble with it crashing when i died so i did some research and found to install the PhysX and now the game exe wont launch. So i reinstalled the game and got it working again but still the same prob with crashing when i die. Also if your having prob with sound load up the game and minimize the game and click on the sound icon on the desktop and make the vol higher then right click on the sound icon go to Sounds and click the communications tab and select ""do nothing"". "
,notforlonger,2010-07-04T09:05Z,"so if it's not ATI card, then what is it? damn.. i really want to play this game, but it seems this game does not want to be played by me.. T_T"
,ns82,2010-07-05T23:47Z,"Can someone please help me out here? The game simply won't start. It crashes as soon as I click on the damn icon. There's no load screen or any other sign of anything happening, just the goddamn crash note. Now I do have a Pentium D running at 2.5GHz, which is slighly below the minimum specs (2.8), but otherwise my PC is compatible (4GB memory, Ati HD4670 512MB). If that's the problem, is there any way to somehow trick the game to make it run, I mean I can OC the motherf*cker to 3,3 GHz even with stock cooling. Any help would be much appreciated. BTW, I got win7 64-bit, and the latest Ati driver."
,ns82,2010-07-06T01:49Z,"OK I helped myself. I downloaded the latest physx driver from nvidia and guess what, it works."

Yes nVidia is way to go

,notforlonger,2010-07-06T19:04Z,"so i finally decided to install the physX driver despite how ludicrous i think it is since it's an NVIDIA driver and im using an ATI card but you know what!? it actually didnt work!! awesome right? well what's more awesome is i lied!! it actually worked!! im playing it right now!! i cant believe something so unbelievably stupid would actually worked.. well if you guys were having trouble, try installing the latest PhysX driver.. perhaps that will help you like it help me.. btw, thanks globe for another great upload :D"

,swano21,2010-07-12T14:15Z,"The game works and installed fine, the only problem is there is no sound at all i dont no how to fix this problem Can some one please help me as i realy want to play the game with sound????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? any info would muchly be apprecaited"
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-07-13T16:19Z,FREEZING PROBLEM SOLUTION:nProblem - The game freezes for 2-3 secs after every 10-15 secs.nCause - Every time the game starts it tries to access the internet. This is what cause the freezes.nSolution - First connet to the internet. Then start the game and select Start Game. Then select New Game/ Continue. After the game loads pause it and press Alt + Tab. Disconnect from the internet if you want to. Then click on the game on the taskbar and play without any freezes. (you can keep the internet connection on if you want to)nYou have to do this every time you start the game.
