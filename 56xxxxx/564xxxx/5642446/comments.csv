This is a BRRip. The source is Memento.2000.1080p.Bluray.DTS.x264-CtrlHD (8.72 GB). 

Thanks for the heads up (I need to edit that mistake). "

,L0xias,2010-07-21T00:22Z,"Nice upload, but the voices sound very soft when I play it using Divx. Does anybody know how to fix this?"
,OleCph,2010-07-29T23:17Z,Thank you very much!
,S3nd41,2010-07-30T14:41Z,"So everyone is downloading this because of that pathetic sample of a movie called Inception? Well, at least this movie is actually good."
,xxxyyyzzzus,2010-08-25T19:26Z,All - think there is something wrong with this file..I mean not virus etc. But looks like the VLC player won't run it but crashes. And then the WD Live player doesn't stream voice after exactly a few mts. Like when Guy Pearce finds himself with a lady in the bed. Can some one help me?
,dullah711,2010-09-04T08:18Z,Amazing movie. Thanks.
,Mancunian10,2010-09-13T01:00Z,Why is this movie rated @ -21 !?

,midge218,2010-10-20T00:55Z,"sure the screenshots looks amazing, shame the bad quality of the trailer on IMDB put me off though, how awfully could they have done to a trailer which gonna sell the movie, thank by the way"
,Nightblade88,2010-10-27T08:44Z,"Good story, great acting on Guy Pearce's part.

Good quality too.
Thanks dude.

P.S. ~ I have no idea why the quality rating on this has 42 negative ratings - probably just some asshole screwing around."
,osriccc,2011-01-15T18:33Z,"Posting close shots as screenshots always mean that wide shots will look crappy. As I always say: upload wide shots screenshots too so we can see the actual quality (every close shot screenshot, even DVD, look this good). And S3nd41, don't be so angry because you didn't understand a simple and good movie like Inception or hate when you're favorite stuff becomes famous, emo kid."

,MongKP,2012-01-08T19:01Z,"So the reason that the quality score, is -12, was because of the wrong sample, right? That was a hugh mistake. By the way thanks for your share."
