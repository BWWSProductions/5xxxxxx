,U4r,2010-06-23T12:29Z,"Did anyone actually check what it is?
Is it really Puzzle Quest 2? I doubt it."
,Sylpheon,2010-06-23T22:11Z,"I haven't downloaded it but there is a game called ""PQ"" just PQ doesn't stand for anything. i don't know if there was a sequel though"
,Werxenum,2010-06-23T22:37Z,"I'm pretty sure Sylpheon is right, PQ and PQ2 are separate puzzle games for the PSP, not Puzzle Quest.  I haven't downloaded this either though.   Where is Puzzle Quest 2? :("
,Sylpheon,2010-06-24T21:51Z,It's to bad Puzzle Quest 2 is on the Xbox360 and DS only T-T
