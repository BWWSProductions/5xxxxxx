,some-young-guy,2010-06-26T21:22Z,"V=8.5
A=7.  Audio is a bit high in treble and the bass is scooped out, but very good quality.  Thnx 4 the u/l"
,michaelrwatson,2010-06-27T00:38Z,"This is CRAP. The reviewers above apparently rated it based on the sample, which seems to have undergone processing.

There is HORRIBLE flicker/brightness variation in all the bright, e.g. outdoor scenes--unlike the indoor scene in the sample. Audio sound like fingers on a chalkboard.

V 2
A 4
M ??"
,michaelrwatson,2010-06-27T00:56Z,"After another look, i have to say that this is fucking sick. Please don't upload crap like this in the future. Thanks."

,qweezum,2010-06-28T07:54Z,"O.K., let me get this straight...the movie just came out...it's a cam. ...you people are downloading this movie and you want it, what? to be dvd quality?  shut up and be grateful that people are even taking the time to upload...i sure would if i could.  the bottom line is, i downloaded, i watched the movie, i did not miss anything, and i saved ten bucks.  if anyone out there wants any more than that for free, or is complaining about the quality given to you by people that don't owe you SHIT, you are more than free to kick rocks, and go somewhere else.  your comments piss grateful people off."
,Yenrock7,2010-06-28T16:50Z,"I agree with [qweezum]
It won't hurt if people just rate the movie quality and stop complaining afterwards.

Thanks raymondhome"
,bellefleur,2010-06-29T01:35Z,"i just want to make a small remark on qweezum comment together with yenrock7.when any uploader make a comment he does that to help others when they gona download,you see it is not only raymondhome who upload ,there are more uploader out there,so when somebody make a comment he just help you to choose me personely if one or more say(a4/v5) and others say for the same video(a6/v6)guess what i gona choose.so don't get mad just try to give us you opinion and always i repeat always thank the uploader for his scharing and effort even after that you have given hem or her ...a/1.......v/1 kapisch........................by the way i didn't download this one yet i am looking for a beter one with a min..of A/7...V/7.and that is thanks to the comment make by downloaders.....comprende."
