Plot:
Robo-Geishaâ€™s got a typical family feud at its heart: two sisters who canâ€™t seem to get along and need to work out their differences. One, Kikue (Hitomi Hasebe), is a geisha vying for approval from wealthy men who will buy her company, the other, Yoshie (Aya Kiguchi), is the younger and clumsier of the two who gets no attention at all. When a successful businessman sees Yoshieâ€™s potential - a private athletic moment he witnesses secretly â€“ he transforms her into a geisha too, but not a normal ethereal being as is tradition. No, he wants to use Yoshie and Kikue as robo-geishaâ€™s alongside his deadly Tengu assassins for a megalomanic deed which threatens the whole of Japan. He uses their hatred for each other to achieve his aims, overseeing their transformation into efficient killers with blades springing from their armpits and napalm from their hair to defeat his enemies.
