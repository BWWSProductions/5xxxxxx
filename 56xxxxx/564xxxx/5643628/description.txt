- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   Enjoy the new full length from this awesome skate punk / ska band. Great
   summer record. Buy it Tuesday.

   "Mesa, AZ based punk rock royalty Authority Zero returns with the release of 
   their fourth studio album, Stories of Survival. Founded in the summer of 
   1994, the band has flourished for nearly two decades.

   Lava Records signed Authority Zero for the release of their iconic 2002 debut 
   album A Passage In Time . The album drew comparisons to Bad Religion and 
   Sublime and toured with Sum 41 and on the Warped Tour. They released their 
   sophomore effort Andiamo in 2004. The album embraced more ska and reggae 
   influences paired with Latin-flavored rhythms to create their most culturally 
   diverse record to date.

   Authority Zero then released two other well received releases, a live album 
   titled Rhythm and Booze and 2007 s 12:34 . Incredibly successful tours 
   alongside Regab, Pennywise and Pepper followed these releases before the 
   band returned to the studio to begin crafting this new release."
