,ThatRat,2010-08-01T22:06Z,If this is 720p I'm John Connor!  Excellent file size and good quality video but more like a DVD rip!  Thanks anyway.
,404_error,2010-08-04T10:54Z,sorry for my noob question ... it sint runnin on my WMP :( why is that?

,est1987,2010-11-29T17:31Z,Never seen Terminator before but my spouse says it's a great film so I'll take his word for it. Thanks!
,est1987,2010-11-30T16:23Z,"A:9/V:5

The quality was far less than what I expected it to be, same with Judgment Day and Terminator Salvation. Thanks all the same."
,danyrx8,2011-02-28T17:03Z,"Ty RiddlerA! Every1 gotta love this one! Schwarzenegger at is best, n perhaps the inspiration for the creators of Duke Nukem! No, that was Dolph Lundgren! Anw nice release! ;)"
,Qualanqui,2011-04-06T00:01Z,Use VLC and not WMP but you could also find the .mkv codec 
,swastikaha,2011-07-16T18:46Z,r u related to yify??? pardon my ignorance but u two seem very much alike but thanx for all ur rips..u r a godsend!!!
,FlashyVox,2011-07-29T23:00Z,"This is bullshit! You can't compress a 720P movie in 500mb no matter how hard you try. This is barely X264. 

A 720p 1,5hr movie will weight no less than 2 GB min!!!"
,miketheratguy,2011-08-10T19:18Z,Comments like that are the reason why everyone has been brainwashed into thinking that movies have to be a dozen gigabytes to be of acceptable quality anymore.
