This show shot in 4:3 format."
,Owltiger,2010-07-01T17:19Z,Thanks these are much appreciated
,BLORRY,2010-07-02T19:11Z,"Magnificent stuff.  Please ignore Athlonite; he is an idiot.  HDTV didn't exist in 1966, doooood.
Seeding as I type.  Could we be seeing Seasons 2 & 3 in the future?  That would only be logical.  And fascinating."
[V],reliant1,2010-07-04T09:29Z,"[Could we be seeing Seasons 2 & 3 in the future?]
It possible."
,Owltiger,2010-07-10T02:28Z,"For anyone considering downloading this 2 words - Don\'t Hesistate!rnrnThe quality of this goes beyond the 10/10 scale.  Multiple scenes have been deleted and then recreated with extreme attention to detail.  To give just one (of many examples) in the episode \""Tomorrow is Yesterday\"" where originally they used a poor quality model of the Enterprise in Earth\'s atmosphere they now use high quality CGI.  In other episodes the Enterprise and other ships have been recreated with details.  As a long time trekkie this is the mother load.  rnrnEAGERLY looking forward to Season 2 and Season 3.   Reliant1 you rock dude!!!!  Thank you.  My first post wasn\'t adequate once I watched these.  I will be seeding for weeks."

,tambuist,2011-09-20T02:34Z,Please seed! I'm getting less than 30 kB/s and I don't wanna wait 5 weeks. Thanks.
,dtbarry31,2011-09-29T18:39Z,Is anyone else having the problem with the audio not in sync with the video?
,LordHumungusNOS,2011-11-01T04:03Z,Has anyone seen TOS - S02E06 - The Doomday Machine. That was one of the best space battles in TOS. Was any goodies added?
,erroneus,2011-11-12T17:52Z,Anyone got subs for this?
,dwbeez,2012-03-23T21:48Z,Love the download and so much appreciated but it would have been nice to have had the Episode Titles in the File Name. So can I go in and edit all of them once downloaded without messing up the file where it will not play?
