[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
well....quality is far from great, and would say not very watchable....used the v2 version seemed to contain 2px top
and bottom more than previous release...not much but more the merrier :P, well tweaked the brightness quite a bit, 
but it really didn't do much at all...lowered contrast a touch, added a deflicker filter, didn't do much so still has
a heavy flicker. Changed the colours all around, lowering the red, boosting the green...slightly touching the blue.
added a sharpness filter slightly, and then a deblock script. overall didn't do much and its not that good. But take 
it or leave it... :P
