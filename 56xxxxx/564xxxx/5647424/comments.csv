,sharkbaby,2010-06-24T11:22Z,"As said, nothing in this episode is new.
All the stories/experiments are cut together from a few old episodes."

,PingPang,2010-06-24T18:18Z,Last week they made top 25 moments... and now this shit??! wtf is going on?!
,Tortured,2010-06-24T18:48Z,Seriously lame. I really hope they dont make a habit out of this - Discovery Channel is notorious for doing this with thier shows though. Dirty Jobs has like 20 episodes of rehashed shit. 
,Published,2010-06-25T13:53Z,"Not good! Damn Discovery... If shit lihe that continues, then... dont know. ItÂ´s weak!"
,bob14148,2010-06-25T16:10Z,"Thanks for the UL eztv!.                      Most of the discovery, history, nat geo and science/knowlege channels are guilty of re-mixing and re-packaging old footage, sometimes even whole series are re-made and ""modernised"" with up to date C.G.I. and then advertised as ""new shows"". This practice is getting more common lateley with some of these channels, however when the ""mythbusters"" themselves are involved in this it is worrying. Maybey one of their cathphrases ""stickin' it to the man!"" should be, ""stickin it to the viewer!"". Poor show mythbusters!"
,sparda1,2010-06-28T09:40Z,"""MythBusters is back with a re-conditioned, re-mastered episode featuring three of our most popular car conundrum myths of all time!""

Sigh..."
