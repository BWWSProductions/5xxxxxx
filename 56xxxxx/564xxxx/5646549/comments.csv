,wiltorn56,2010-06-23T16:56Z,"this has FAKE written all over it, whats with these clowns"
,makesadus,2010-06-23T16:58Z,"This downloaded super fast, and I had my hopes up when I saw the title screen, until everything went black. Norton didn't find anything but I don't trust it! I'm waiting for a legit copy!"
,paulpeepee,2010-06-23T17:02Z,I am confused!  I don't see Avenged on the torrent.  HUH? Reloaded?  Is this real or fake?  
,zazhie,2010-06-23T17:07Z,doesnt work - this is frustrating
,posmei,2010-06-23T17:09Z,"real? wont install, i keep getting system errors"

,2v5,2010-06-23T18:38Z,"why do people put fake sh!t on here?????
Cheap thrills??? Well get a life to all you useless pirates!!!!!"
,markoose,2010-06-23T19:40Z,"some of you guys need to get a grip, I hate using the word but some of you really are noobs. Look at how many uploads gamerguy has, why do you think he has a pink skull (meaning trusted, mouse over it). It's not fake it's a mistake, the iso might be corrupted or the crack may be wrong most of the uploads have a skull by their name. It's probably something wrong with the iso, besides your downloading it for free aren't you so don't complain."
[T],gamerguuy,2010-06-23T20:57Z,I am very sorry guys.I don't know whats wrong with it.I am gonna check it again.I apologize for any inconvenience i have caused you everybody.
,masterfaster2,2010-06-23T21:56Z,"The rar files of this torrent are identical to the scene release: LEGO.Harry.Potter.Years.1-4.CLONEDVD-AVENGED

So this torrent is genuine. Thus cut the crap.

Now if it works or not, that I cannot tell as I haven't unpacked and installed the release. The format of the image is mdf/mds. Use latest Alcohol 120% or Daemon Tools Lite/Pro to mount the image. To play, use the crack by RELOADED.

The release is not nuked, thus it means it is working."
,darklord94,2010-06-23T22:14Z,"@ masterfaster2
I trust gamerguuy and i cannot believe that the torrent is ''fake''. when you install the game,please let me know if it's working."
,spankinhotsauce,2010-06-23T22:28Z,"sorry I am a noob.  So  masterfaster2, what you're saying is that this is real but it's not going to work because you need to download something else to make it work?  Then is there another torrent that I can download and everything works? =(     "
,swilki33,2010-06-23T23:31Z,"I can't seem to get this one working either, and it's a little frustrating for me too... however, we need to cut gamerguuy some slack, he's done a lot for our community.  The fact that it doesn't work does not make it a fake, it's an honest mistake, or bug in one of the support files.  In the mean time, I'm trying this one  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5647218"
,hootieman,2010-06-24T12:36Z,"I agree, quit complaining, if ya don't like it go out and buy the fucking game... that is all"
