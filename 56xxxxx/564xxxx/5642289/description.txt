We Are Born is the fourth studio album by Sia Furler. The album is notably more upbeat than her previous work, which she partly attributes to her relationship with JD Samson as well as her childhood influences Cyndi Lauper and Madonna. The album's first single, "You've Changed" was released in December 2009 and the second, "Clap Your Hands", in April 2010.
