PMDGOPTIONS.DLL SHOULD BE PLACED IN: 

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\PMDG\dlls 

NOT the Modules folder. "
,michael63000,2010-06-22T20:28Z,"ALSO: USE THIS CRACK INSTEAD OF THE ONE PROVIDED IF YOU WANT 747-8X

,aca88_2k9,2010-06-22T23:21Z,"God Bless you Mike :) installation without a breeze until i reached the part where you said you got to add the ip address www...com under host/etc.. well i tried saving it but it said i did not have admin rights.. lol and i cant open that file with admin (no option too). so i continued my installation, did the update

Now i get black screens after few seconds on startup. i suppose it is with that IP that didnt work? can you say how to add it specifically to the host file? Jus randomly paste it in the end? :S

thanks
"

,Jens9515,2010-08-16T10:54Z,"Hello every one! I have downloaded this PMDG MD-11 cracked version thing, and I was wondering if any one of you maybe could answer me why the elevator gets stuck up and down depending on what way I move the stick after a while of flying, and that I cant control the thruttles(speeds) with my joystick.. I more likely have to use the keyboard to force it down.. Does anyone know the answer on how to fix it, just leave a responsive message, thank you! and by the way, how can i update the cracked md11 version to a newer version without the FSX to crash. I have tried to update it normal, but then FSX just crashed and i had to reinstall the whole game for just a little update.. off.. Please answer anyone..:"

,jayp94,2011-09-09T20:44Z,"Thanks! Great download.

For people who need help.

To shop the panels from disapearing after takeoff you must:

Follow the instructions but:

- RENAME the pmdgoptions.dll in the crack folder to PMDGOptions.dll (notice the capital letters)
- Place it in 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\PMDG\dlls' folder
- To get the enable button to work you must run it as administrator
- To edit the 'hosts' file, open it with notepad, save the edited file (after you have added the ip address) to your desktop, drag and drop the current 'hosts' file to the recycling bin, drag and drop the edited 'hosts' file from your desktop to the folder.

I felt like i need to contribute to the community so hope i helped."

See thru???? FUBAR!  Other than that it works fine as long as you don't mind a jet that is part wonder woman jet! I run FSX with sp1 only and wonder if I need sp2 or acceleration or something!
