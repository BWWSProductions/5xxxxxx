,beerpressure,2010-06-22T16:12Z,I would love 202 to put together a best of dave show for fourth of july.
,SeattleJen,2010-06-23T02:29Z,I love Ronnie B. and used to adore Fezzie.  I can hardly take Fez now that Dave is gone.  I'm glad he's silent - I just get angry at him now.  Maybe I need to take a break away for a while.
,LapisVery,2010-06-23T16:04Z,Thank you. I do want Dave back... maybe I should start a petition?
