When an oversized chunk of rock floats through space on a collision course with the planet Earth, the President of the United States approves the use of nuclear weapons in an attempt to save the planet. The nukes destroy most of the rock, but the strike creates a massive shower of meteorites that begin assaulting California and Nevada.

David Dematti (Joe Lando) is a Nevada-based research scientist whose life is thrust into chaos as he responds to an urgent late night call to return to the lab. Upon arrival he finds a fellow technician on the floor, apparently dying from drinking tap water, now contaminated by the space debris. The remaining security staff runs away as the building is destroyed by falling meteorites. David returns home in time to see his wife (Claudia Christian) and daughter placed in a government truck during an evacuation of his neighborhood.

While Las Vegas is destroyed by heavenly wrath, David is on a path to reunite with his family. His first stop is at a market to get more bottled water, but instead he finds an unconscious woman in the parking lot. He manages to revive her with a shot from a medical bag he carried from his lab. Her name is Lynn (Cooper Harris) and she joins him on his quest to find survivors of the occasional meteor showers.
