,acouvis,2011-09-18T20:47Z,"Was about to ask about to play the 2nd side of the discs... Finally figured out the title of this torrent (while correct) is a bit deceptive.

Basically while it says ""Complete"", it actually isn't... It is correct, it's just stupid marketing people made it somewhat deceptive.
I had thought it was like this collection http://movies.netflix.com/Movie/North-and-South-The-Complete-Collection/70006779 but actually it is not.   

Basically, this torrent contains the Complete North and South collection... FOR BOOKS 1 and 2 ONLY.

Thus (I could be mistaken with my numbering) - of the 15 episode series, the discs line up as follows:

Disc 1: Book 1, eps 1-2
Disc 2: Book 1, eps 3-4
Disc 3: Book 1, eps 5-6
Disc 4: Book 2, eps 1-2
Disc 5: Book 2, eps 3-4
Disc 6: Book 2: eps 5-6

BUT it does NOT contain book 3, and thus is missing the last 3 episodes.  Just an FYI. "
