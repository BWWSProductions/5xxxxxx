NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Toy story 3

Right this is just our cam version maded into a dvdr with a few more extra tweaks and prisms direct audio added.
So thanks to prism for the direct line and to Relizlab for the video
Like i said the video as had some extra work done too it......inc a antiflicker,slight change in rgb colours,toucj brighter and
more contrast added.
The audio we have remastered using noise and hiss removal filters and changing the EQ on it.
Also yes it has a flicker and no deflicker app will remove it totally.....you can make it better but not disappear
And finally yes we will  be doing a xvid of it aswell,but for that were trying a different method of deflickering to see if we can get it
even better,but taking a fair few hrs to encode so .....

Enjoy !
