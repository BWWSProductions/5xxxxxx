This is a tender and metaphoric story about one common tatar women Bibinur. At the end of her days she recalls the past as she observes the modern lifestyle intruding into a quiet life of their small settlement to destroy a centuries-old order. The authors show the fragile world which last inhabitants are trying to resist those featureless powers, that bereave any being of a true value - of a sacred memory.
