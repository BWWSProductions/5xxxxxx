,barrygateaux,2010-06-23T20:22Z,never thought i'd see this - thanks!
,anuskasvo,2010-06-23T20:40Z,"Great great show, must for everyone who likes classic british comedy."
,B3th56,2010-06-23T22:31Z,"Many thanks, I really enjoyed watching this in the eighties."
,txheartbeat,2010-06-23T23:26Z,"I'm surprised at the demand-- but I saved it, though. I'll continue to seed 'til there's 5 seeders, and hoping that the torrent will be self-viable by then...."
,11VXV11,2010-11-08T05:27Z,"This show is impossible to find!
Thx to the uploader!"
,torgman1,2011-01-03T02:18Z,Is this Series 1 or 2?
,rodricks,2011-03-13T07:23Z,"One of this shows writers is Victoria Pile, who 15 years later went on to create the greatest comedy show in the history of everything that natters, Green Wing.  

Thanks for the UL."
,slide9000,2011-06-14T17:57Z,These files are series 3 of NTNOCN from October - December 1980. Episode 8 is missing from this torrent. 
,Coolseed,2011-09-11T23:23Z,"Thanks for uploading this. It's pure gold - you can't find this anywhere.
I had a small issue with the archive but was able to get around it.
This is probably a problem unique to my system but just in case, here's how I got around it...
WinZip reports the archive as having an error and can't open it.
WinRar reports the archive as corrupt but you can still extract all of 'Part 1' and the first two files of 'Part 3'.
The corrupt file for me was '67-7_1980.avi'."
,betaville,2011-10-02T23:15Z,Nice upload.  Thankyou.  Didnt have any probelms with any of the files.  Pamela Stephenson was looking good in this series!  I really want to see the Pamela Stephenson special that was shown on TV in the 80s.
,Tsaparang,2012-01-08T23:44Z,"I downloaded this torrent today and was surprised to discover it contained a repacked copy of my original upload in 2006, generated from my old Betamax tapes.  In case you are interested, the names of the files e.g. 67-5_1980.AVI refer to the specific Betamax tape on which the episodes were stored, i.e. tape number 67.  I also converted several more tapes of the same show and posted them on TPB in 2006.

I stopped seeding the five torrents some time ago, because I have a very slow 24kbyte per second uplink speed on my ADSL connection and need the bandwidth for other things.

I've just checked TPB and discovered that two of my original 2006 Not the 9'oclock News torrents are still alive - just search for them using my user name Tsaparang.  

If anyone is really desperate, add a comment to the appropriate stuck torrents and I might be persuaded to reseed them again to get them going.

On a final note, I am pleased to that the work I performed converting from Betamax to AVI is still appreciated."
