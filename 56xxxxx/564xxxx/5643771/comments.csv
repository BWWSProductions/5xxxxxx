I'm a Canadian who found out he's got more in common with Texans than Canadians (I think there's nothing wrong with carrying a gun to protect oneself) and can't get GB here. This is huge for me. Keep up the great work!

The revolutions coming. I just hope it comes to Canada.

When Com(mie)cast lied and changed all their channels to digital last year, I lost GB for several months and depended on the torrents to get it. The well dried up last December, and I missed GB for several months. Now that I have access again, and seeing that nobody is posting the TV Hour, I figured I'll do what I can to fill the void.
As GB says himself, ""DVR this program - you need to know this stuff!"""
