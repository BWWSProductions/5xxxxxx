,PhilLesh12,2010-06-26T12:38Z,"I know, it's really frustrating.

For some reason, TvTeam is using members only trackers on a lot of their torrents.

The worse thing is when their crap shows up in RSS feeds first, and my downloader picks up their crap instead of viable torrents like from eztv or AiTB.

Between that and all the porn, TvTeam has become some sort of pariah."
,PhilLesh12,2010-06-26T12:39Z,"You have to just skip torrents from this group, and remove them from your RSS feeds. 

They're all screwed up right now."
