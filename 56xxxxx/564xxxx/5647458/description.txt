         Craig Ferguson hosts this star-studded 125th anniversary      
         celebration of the Boston Pops, telling the story of the      
         orchestra's transformation from summertime entertainment      
         for Bostonians to the national icon it is today. In the       
         past eight decades the Pops has been under the leadership     
         of just three conductors, Arthur Fiedler, John Williams       
         and Keith Lockhart. This special features their work and      
         interviews and/or performances by Audra McDonald, Kristin     
         Chenoweth, Josh Groban, James Taylor, Vanessa Williams,       
         Yo-Yo Ma, Wynton Marsalis, and Roberta Flack. Also featured   
         is rare footage of favorite artists past and present,         
         including Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Johnny Cash,        
         Benny Goodman, Tony Bennett, Sammy Davis, Jr., John Raitt,    
          k.d. lang, The Carpenters, and Patti LaBelle.
