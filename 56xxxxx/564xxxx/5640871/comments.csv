,FLiP21,2010-06-21T23:15Z,"Bought 2 copies of this album today.. Eminem collaborating with Just Blaze is the best thing that ever happened to Hip-Hop.

P.S. - Thanks for the Bonus tracks. They're pretty sweet too!"

,KevMovieMan,2010-06-22T17:57Z,"THANK U!!!! But how can I get the album art/digital artwork to show up on my ipod. Images are there but they don't match up, CAN'T GET COVER ART/BOOKLET to show on IPOD HELP?"
,jaycarl,2010-06-23T10:42Z,THIS IS ONE ARTIST WE MUST SUPPORT TO INSURE EMINEM CONTINUES TO CREATE REAL RAP THAT ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING.
,DarthzeroProductions,2010-06-23T13:03Z,"@Kev, The way you do it is to go to the folder where the .mp3 files for this are. Right click on one of them and go to properties, then ID-tags, and click on the ""Album Artwork"" button, and its easy from there."
,kliao93,2010-06-26T04:39Z,"is this version unprotected mp3? been dying to be able to have a torrent thats a cd rip (since wmp cant do it, and i forget the program i used to use to convert/rip protected stuff and make it unprotected)
and is unprotected so i can edit the audio in stuff like audacity, etc."
,Arctic0ne,2010-06-30T18:32Z,"@kliao93
Any audio off of iTunes is unprotected, they removed their DRM a few months back. The only problem is that songs now cost 1.29 instead of .99."
,gratefulforthis,2010-06-30T23:05Z,"Thanks for the upload.

As far as Eminem...his best days are definitely behind him."

i agree with you 100% ive said pretty much the exact same thing to ppl who say em has lost it and so on but nah you listen to his new stuff and he still goes hard and you can still tell he is passionate about his music. i was going to go on but really dont feel like it i wanna go to bed "
