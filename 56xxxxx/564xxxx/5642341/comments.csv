,danw16,2010-06-28T04:02Z,"Hi thenoobish,

Do you think you could make a torrent of the game ""NASCAR Thunder 2002"" for the PlayStation 2. I loved that game a lot but my disc for the game got damaged :'(

Thanks,

Dan"

,jdperez2003,2011-01-05T15:03Z,"i use iso tool 1.6 to patch the game and it works on my psp 1003 5.00 m33-6

google iso tool 1.6 and download it, put the iso tool folder in your memory stick [PSP/GAME folder] open the iso tool as a game, once open there are options, look for the ModNation.iso file highlight and press x, another options will come out and choose PATCH, under this select and try Kernal Library 0 first or Z, whichever will work, [it will say updated something like if the option works] exit iso tool [use Home or the triangle button] and play the game
hope it will work for you too!!"

I tried the patch thing that jdperez2006 suggested but it did nothing (it even didnt update or anything) And its weird because i got the game yesterday and it ran fine, then i wake up this morning, and BAM it doesnt work! then the patch only made it say ""Corrupt Data"". Any help?"
