,spockers,2010-06-26T23:11Z,"@pigletdude:
Since you obviously have it, how about seeding for the rest of us who are still downloading? There is only 1 seeder, and I presume that's the poster, not you."

,spockers,2010-06-27T02:51Z,"1046 peers, 4 seeders... about to change in a big way (yeah, I'm bored, can't watch the ep cuz the wife's asleep LOL)"
,spockers,2010-06-27T03:08Z,"OK over 100 seeders now and I seeded to a ratio of 1.4, so.... Spock out"
