To mark the 20th anniversary of his death, this documentary from 2008
celebrates the extraordinary talent of Roy Orbison and his relationship with
his most loyal fans, British musicians and the British public.

Through a combination of interview and archive, it charts Orbison's career in
Britain, from the sell-out tour with the Beatles that rocketed him to
superstardom to the collaboration with lifelong friend George Harrison on the
Travelling Wilburys project in the 1980's.
