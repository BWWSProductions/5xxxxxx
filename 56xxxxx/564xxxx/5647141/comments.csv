[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-07-01T05:03Z,"@ Mr. S. - It isn't too much to ask. In fact, I am glad that you requested those.

I will upload ""Psycho (1960)"" in the morning.

If I get ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith (1941)"" tonight, I will upload it a few hours after I upload ""Psycho"".

When I get ""The Birds 1963"", I will upload it.

I will be on vacation for a week starting June 4th, but I will try to leave a computer seeding 24/7 while I am gone. When I get back, expect some new stuff from me.
