If you dont agree with this then this torrent must not be for you! :)  To all the rest, thanks and enjoy!!!!!! "
,goMustango,2010-07-04T04:59Z,"i'm new, and i want to help community seeding... how can i do so?"
,Mocking_Markup,2010-07-20T12:40Z,"To be honest, I rarely seed anything. But because this is such a large file and has a lack of seeders..I will make an exception.
@goMustango to seed something, you let the download finish in uTorrent or whatever program you use; and you wait till the upload icon turns into a check mark."
