""Files are archived in 7z, LZMA2 compression.
For WinRAR or 7-Zip, you will need at least WinRAR 3.91, 7-Zip 9.04 to extract.""

if you don have the correct version it will say corrupted file.
if you are using some other archiver, make sure it supports LZMA2, or it will also say corrupted file."
