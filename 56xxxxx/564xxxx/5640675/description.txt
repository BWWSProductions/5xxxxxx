BBC R4 Drama - Anthony Price's 'The Labyrinth Makers'
Adapted by Nick McCarty
Directed by Hamish Wilson. 
Broadcast 1980 [can anyone help with the exact date?]
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

Discovery of a crashed WWII plane means that a botched
investigation and a search for missing ancient artefacts
come alive again.

Very plausible sub-plot about Stalin's pre-WWII purge of
many of the Red Army's officers.

This production is thirty years old, but it's still fresh
and almost undated. It's sound quality is good too.
