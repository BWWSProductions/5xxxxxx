Thanks for the Cars.  The individual albums sound
great - not all loud and compressed.

I've got some new rips to post but the PB capta thingee appears to be broken.  When PB gets it fixed I'll be posting some new rips.

I'm not on a lot of torrent sites so if anyone cares to share this or any of my other torrents elsewhere feel free to do so."
