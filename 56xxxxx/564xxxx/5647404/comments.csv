,loppan_48,2010-06-24T22:25Z,isn't this a old episode??? Just downloaded it and I have seen it before.
,Guffa42,2010-06-24T22:50Z,"@loppan_48: It's all reruns, but from different episodes. Underwater car is from early i season five for example."
,krist420,2010-06-25T16:29Z,"looks like mythbusters are running out of ideas because the last two episodes have just been repeats, shame really considering the season started so strong."
,clasohlson88,2010-06-26T03:58Z,Death ! is not enough punishment for you ! UL old episodes  claiming they are new ones  should be punished by public stoning to death and then a army of donkeys should be forced to urinate on your corpse !
