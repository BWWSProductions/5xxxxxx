,thunderx7,2010-06-26T19:21Z,"Enough with A/V comments. All 1.37 GiB rips by MAX are the same quality. 

How about commenting on a quality of the movie itself, not the rip!"

,DogNo7,2010-06-29T05:38Z,"The quality of the av on the file is fine.  The movie was as boring as an episode of Ghost Hunters, or watching paint dry, which are pretty close to identical experiences.

Most boring cop yarn I have ever seen."
,libertaswv,2010-07-01T05:54Z,"""as boring as an episode of Ghost Hunters""

,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-07-04T04:04Z,rip is fine but story is crap
,hippojoe,2010-07-07T03:11Z,"A/V great, but a warning, i have cox communications as in IP and i got an email about copyright infringment stuff from this particular video, not sure how all that works but though i should say it"
,rebellionnx,2010-07-07T16:31Z,Xtremezone is a beast! great up's man everything is always great quality and perfectly done! 
,rebellionnx,2010-07-07T16:32Z,oh and quality rating. . . . . . . its extremezone of course its gonna be 10:10 
,Groscurth,2010-07-11T14:07Z,"I\'ve never seen such a grand collection of cliches. Alcoholic street cop doing the 7-days-to-pension routine, dirty cop just doing what dirty cops do and so so romantically teetering on the edge of destruction (O God, what will happen to him?!) , the black nouveau riche pushers/dealers doing their you-feel-me routine. And of course the almost honest undercover cop feeling the allure of the dark side. What will he do! Join the ranks of his true buddies and amend his sins for being a cop or or or what...? Don\'t hold your breath, the answer\'s in the first ten minutes of this very emparrasing movie. I forgot to say, one of the bad guys once saved the undercover cop\'s life, so now the cop is eternally grateful to the bad guy. O mein gott that is soooo original."
,cres222222,2010-07-17T23:32Z,"Please, please people do not waste over two hours of your life watching this - tacke a crap for two hours - it would be time better spent and you would feel better after"
,Magickrider,2010-08-01T17:28Z,didnt like the movie. but the rip was great
,DigitalWarlord420,2010-08-02T11:07Z,Thanks for the heads up to those of you who said this was a crap flick. To the guy with the infringement issue I would blame you ISP more than this torrent or torrent downloading in particular. I would switch to TWC if possible they have always been cool to me.
,razzell2,2010-08-14T14:44Z,"You guys mentioning copywrite infringement warning letters from your ISP. 
Same thing with me, with extremezone, and with anything from NOIR. 

I use VerizonDSL, and they've got about 3 or 4 ""release groups"" tagged as infringment sharers.

All I can say it, Ive gotten 5 or 6 letters from my isp over these two sharers in the last year or so, but thats all, just the letters, never no action of any kind.

But, on the other hand, at some point your isp, if your getting these copywrite infrigment warnings, is gonna drop you. I asked, and thats what I was told.

I say if you know which release groups are getting you noticed by your isp, then go somewhere else.

Its not the uploader, its your isp who has them tagged.

Thats my two cents.

Long live p2p, and thanks for the share, extremezone!"
