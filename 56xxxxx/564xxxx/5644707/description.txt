Plot: Steven Russell is happily married to Debbie, and a member of the local police force
         when a car accident provokes a dramatic reassessment of his life. Steven realizes he's
         gay and decides to live life to the fullest - even if it means breaking the law. Steven's
         new, extravagant lifestyle involves cons and fraud and, eventually, a stay in the State
         Penitentiary where he meets sensitive, soft-spoken Phillip Morris. His devotion to
         freeing Phillip from jail and building the perfect life together prompts Steven to attempt
         and often succeed at one impossible con after another.
