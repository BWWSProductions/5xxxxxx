,freestuff12,2010-09-28T15:22Z,what program runs dvd 9 format
,loquorlicker,2010-10-27T07:06Z,"DVD9 is just a density thing, not a real format problem for you. When you burn it to a DVD and remove all the extras such as director's comments, subs, other languages, warnings, and so on, it may be small enough to fit or almost fit on a DVD5 disc, about 4.3 gigs. If your burning program won't let you degrade the quality enough to make that size limit, get another burning program, available at a pirate shop near you."
