,PhilLesh12,2010-06-21T11:07Z,"There are some audio problems, at least when played on a WDTV Live.

Sound cuts out at ~1:15:00 to the end on the WDTV Live.

In VLC, the subtitles appear to be out of sync, not that it matters since they are in some other language, and can easily be disabled.

Otherwise, the movie is very watchable for a CAM, even though I had to watch the last 15 minutes on my laptop instead of on my nice large plasma TV."
