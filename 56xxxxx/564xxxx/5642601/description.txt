IMAGiNE NOTES
Well first off thanks to prism for the audio and Relizlab for the video :)
Now heres our xvid like promised......same filtering done as our dvdr, however we have added some more deflicker on this, to try and get rid alot of the flicker.
Still has a pulse, but looks much better in our opinion now (then our cam video).
We have added two samples of where we think is the worse part of the video for the flicker, so you can see how
bad it gets ;-)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
