== Humanity's Last Hope ==
Earth is dead â€“ but in the last years before the catastrophe, the starship 
Unity was launched. The ship carried a few thousand colonists to the nearby 
Alpha Centauri system, where they were to build a new Earth on the world 
called simply "Planet."

Then disaster struck. The Unity was mortally wounded by space debris. 
In the ship's dying moments, mutiny split the crew into factions, 
each of which escaped in a landing pod, taking along its own plans for 
the new world. After landing, the colonists were plunged into a 
centuries-long struggle against a hostile planet, horrific alien life forms, 
and each other. Only one faction could win control over Planet and the 
destiny of humanity. . .

GURPS Alpha Centauri is based on the award-winning computer game Sid Meier's 
Alpha Centauri. It includes everything you need to recreate the history of 
humanity on Planet, from the desperate days after the landing to the edge of 
human transcendence.

Roleplay the colony leaders from the computer game, or create your own 
characters â€“ scouts and warriors on the new frontier.

Explore the alien landscapes and strange life forms of Planet, as well as 
the hidden landscapes of the human mind.
Build a civilization . . . develop technology and create an army . . . 
defend your colony and then strike at your foes!
Conquer your rivals and make your vision the one that shapes the future 
of humanity!

A new world. A second chance.
Who will control Planet?
