Gloomcookie is a goth soap opera set in the San Francisco club scene created and written by Serena Valentino (Nightmares & Fairy Tales) and co-created by Ted Naifeh (Courtney Crumrin), who also illustrated the comicâ€™s first 6 issues.  Each 6-issue run has featured a different artist, beginning with Ted Naifeh, followed by Jon Gebbia, Breehn Burns, Harley Sparx  and currently Vincent Batignole.  The series functions both as a social satire on real-life Gothic subculture and as a supernatural fantasy.

The last issue was #28.  Serena Valentino stated that she intended to end the individual issue release of the series, in favour of releasing a series of complete graphic novels at an undisclosed time.  Serena, and Gloomcookie's current artist Vincent Batignole, have chosen to focus their efforts on a new comic project instead, titled Enchanted.
