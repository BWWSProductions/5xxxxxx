i know the neck of the woods in which you live...'cause you told me previously...
...you didn't go to Oxbridge did you?
Are you some sort of deranged Professor Emeritus?
Please tell me you are not"
,fendermental,2010-06-30T11:45Z,"G'Day Night,

Nah, not a Professor Emeritus from Oxbridge. Just looney from Tottenham Tech. I am deranged though. I thought I used to be indecisive, but now I'm not so sure.
Thanks for all the great uploads, especially the recent James Cotton series."
