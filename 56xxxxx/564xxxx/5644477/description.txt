This Rip has been tested on Apple TV, PS3, IPad, WDTV and XBox 360 with successful results. For true Dolby Digital 5.1 use an optical cable (Toslink) connected to your PS3, WDTV or Apple TV and connect it to a receiver that can decode the Dolby Digital signal.

Finding out there's a bomb on your bus (which will explode if the driver goes slower than 50 miles per hour, no less) is never a good thing -- but if your demolitions-expert-in-shining armor turns out to be Keanu Reeves, at least you'll have a fun ride. Jan De Bont's "Die Hard on a bus" thrill-fest has all the stunts, explosions and edge-of-your-seat moments an action fan could want -- plus Sandra Bullock in her breakthrough role.
