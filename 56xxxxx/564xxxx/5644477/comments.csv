i was wondering, what would you use for an apple TV encode? (settings for WinX) with files not bigger than 1GB?"
,Kellso76,2010-06-24T05:03Z,"Let me ask this, are you trying to take an Ipod rip and make it compatible with Apple TV? If so, you shouldn't have to. An Ipod rip will play on an Apple TV already. Make sure you change the file extension if needed, from .MP4 to .M4V....."
,napptunes,2010-06-24T12:51Z,Well i'm using the Apple TV preset thats available on WinX and it looks great but i was wondering if i should switch to some better settings! It doens't have to be iPod anymore.
,Kellso76,2010-06-24T21:57Z,"I need to get this straight......What are u trying to get accomplished? it sounds like u want to convert your movies to an Apple TV preset and still have them under 1 gig. Whats the source of your movies? For example, are u gonna be ripping a DVD, a Bluray or a movie u got from TPB? Remember Napp, the key to a smaller file is adjusting the Video Quality on any setting used in WinX and most other programs. Remember the Iphone settings started at 1024 Kbps and u adjusted them down to 400 to get the size u wanted. Thats what has to be done on any other setting used in WinX. Hope this helps."
