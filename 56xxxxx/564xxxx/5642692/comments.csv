,SQN-,2011-03-10T00:00Z,"Thanks for the upload but have encountered the following problem and message when playing the movies:

'AVI CHUNK VIEWER
this avi file was not prepared for sequential reading, the alternative 'Avi Splitter ' will now let the default one handle it. The complete re-interleaving of this file is strongly recommended before burning it onto a slow media like a cd-rom.'

Movies still play but a re-upload would be appreciated, thanks for the compilation!"
