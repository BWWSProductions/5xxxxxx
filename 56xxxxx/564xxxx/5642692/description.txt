CLASS OF NUKE 'EM HIGH

Class of Nuke'Em High, the timeless classic of readin', writin' and radiation, is available for the first time ever in this unrated Director's Cut. When first released in theaters in 1986, Class of Nuke'Em High became an instant sensation. Its unique blend of horror and humor was cheered by audiences and celebrated by critics. The film spawned two sequels and legions of fans.

At Tromaville High School, located a stone's throw from the local Nuclear Power Plant, the students are getting brighter. In fact, they're beginning to develop a Troma-green glow. Innocent students mutate into sex-crazed psychos, the Honor Society's turned into carnivorous, kinky cretins, and the slimy monster stalking the hallways isn't the principal!

The Director's Cut of Class of Nuke 'Em High has been lovingly restored by co-director Lloyd Kaufman (who developed the film during detention) and the Troma Team. Never-before-seen footage (found in the Tromaville High School's girls' bathroom) has been added. The film includes a special introduction from the Tromaville CafÃ© featuring Toxie, Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D, The Tromettes, and Lloyd Kaufman.

Everyone will agree that Class Of Nuke'em High is the best movie about violent monster mutant morons of the decade!!
