[T],Pharos2001,2010-06-24T10:33Z,added several trackers to no avail. All leech is @ 0% Where are the seeders????
[T],Pharos2001,2010-06-24T10:47Z,OK now very slow but seeding!
,BudShiz,2010-06-24T17:05Z,"Mine says ""Cannot render the file"" so i guess its corrupted >=|"
,BudShiz,2010-06-24T17:21Z,"im sticking with 99,8% instead :/"
,sam_smooth,2010-06-24T18:37Z,i am stuck at 99.8%  what is up with the seeders??
,terrygush,2010-06-24T19:15Z,"Unusual to strugle with this, but I looked around the web found 160 seeders at KickAssTorrrents. The Torrent there is not corrupt. Just though you might like to know. Cheers Terry"
[T],Pharos2001,2010-06-24T19:47Z,"I released a fixed version of the file! on btjunkie. Captcha not working for me right now!
It is an AVI w/ the same name as this one but with 're' added to the end of the filename."
[T],Pharos2001,2010-06-25T00:03Z,DivFix++ will fix whatever you managed to DL. (.2% of 100%) Works for me!
,slickdipstick,2010-06-25T18:29Z,"Divfix tells me ""This is not an AVI file."" Problem is the .2% that's not being seeded is the very beginning of the file containing the headers. VLC plays incomplete files, but not if the very beginning is missing :("
,sonofdog,2010-06-25T19:03Z,"I too am stuck at 99.8%, where's this bloody seeder?"
