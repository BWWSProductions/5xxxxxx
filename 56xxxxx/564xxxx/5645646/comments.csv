[V],twentyforty,2010-06-23T09:26Z,"@zmacdaddy8: I have, like many others, sucked fake DVDSCR in March, I think.

These two today are supposedly real ones, not the cut-outs from the movie, as the ones in March.
As I have seen, even S7 is announced."

,seenoevil47,2010-06-23T11:41Z,"Hey nw this is confusing??!! Isnt this supos to be season 7.. I suppose there were 4 movies broadcasted as 16 episodes, which was th 6th season.. Isnt it ? or this is the 6th season..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-23T12:12Z,"Season 6 will air on Comedy Central. 26 episdoes will be made but only 12 of these will be counted as Season 6. The remaining ones will be Season 7.

Season 6 is the new season."
,seenoevil47,2010-06-23T15:15Z,Oh i see..!! Bt do u have th Futurama movies?? hv u uploaded that ?? 
,jjabrams,2010-06-23T17:14Z,20/40 are you going to do higher res versions once it screens on air tomorrow? This file size is quite small lol.
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-23T18:20Z,"@jjabrams: HighRes source is not available. DVD has 720x480 and qualifies for max. 480p.
In cases of animated shows I consider as stupid to upscale the source only for ""Pee""-sake... and it is - a SCREENER only. 320p is certainly most appropriate. If you NEED 32 pixels more - download XviD - 175 MB a piece... LOL."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-23T18:24Z,"@jjabrams: Oh, not to forget: I never encode the same episodes twice if airing follows DVDSCR version. I told you that regarding Party Down DVDSCR for eps 1. and 2."
,jjabrams,2010-06-23T18:54Z,ok np 20/40 - I assume you will be doing the rest of the season in 320p also?
,jon4fun,2010-06-24T00:01Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.
& for the explanation about S6 & S7 etc.

Cheers
Jon"
