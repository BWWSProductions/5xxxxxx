,JimmyJones123,2010-07-16T09:23Z,how can i remove the russian audio? nnthanx!
,grtdrgn,2010-07-16T17:39Z,"I may be a complete doofus, but I can not get these to play for the life of me. Using latest Divx Player. Also installed the CCCP from Jonny\'s link. Any suggestions/thoughts?"
,JimmyJones123,2010-07-17T00:34Z,"use VLC media player, works fine for me!!!"
,grtdrgn,2010-07-20T22:41Z,"Okay, figured out what I was doing wrong. Was trying to play them while I was still D/Ling.

Anyone else having problems with the episodes skipping forward? I'm not sure whether or not to try downloading again."
,Saki33,2010-08-15T21:08Z,"WTF?! The dialogue is dubbed Russian on top of the English. Didn't see that in the title. I guess I should have read the info a little closer. So after I quickly deleted it, I see there is a tool to remove an unwanted audio track. Sigh. Okay, don't worry; I restored it and the torrent from recycle bin and am now seeding it again. Tried mkvmerge. Audio tracks not identified as to language, and I hate reading instructions, so I guessed that logically the first track would be Eng so selected the mp4 and first audio track and muxed those, leaving the extra audio track unchecked. It worked, 166 seconds to complete. I was a little annoyed at first, but learning something new erased that. Thanks for the upload. Good quality."
,Saki33,2010-08-15T22:24Z,Can't find any subs that synch. 
,Saki33,2010-09-22T16:21Z,"Replying to the question about skipping forward: no problem for me. I didn't download every episode, but every one I did download (5, 7, 11, 13) is good."
,stedenfeldt9,2011-01-12T20:26Z,"No subs is in synch with this version. If somebody got link to subs that work please tell. quality is good, but without subs I have to go with this upload Leverage.S01E01-S01E12.720p.HDTV.x264-CTU "
,jarrks,2011-05-13T00:19Z,"Thank you GoodFilms!
There are 2 audiotracks:
[lavf] stream 1: audio (ac3), -aid 0, -alang eng
[lavf] stream 2: audio (ac3), -aid 1, -alang rus
So you have to choose which one you wanna hear. For instance in mplayer: 
mplayer Leverage.mkv -alang eng
That's it. No need to delete anything."
,normrpeters,2012-03-31T23:08Z,"I cant seem to download torrents these days. All I see it the ""GET THIS TORRENT"" link, clicking it in chrome does nothing. in IE i get a 404 error. I believe there used to be another link? anyone know what I'm doing wrong?"
