- 3 U.S. Soldiers Speak Out on McChrystalâ€™s Firing, Petraeusâ€™ Replacement and the Unending War in Afghanistan

President Obama says the Afghan war will continue as planned despite his firing of General Stanley McChrystal over disparaging comments made by McChrystal and his aides about top U.S. officials. Obama has named General David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command and architect of the surge in Iraq, as a successor. The firing of McChrystal comes at a perilous moment in the Afghan war, with June now the deadliest month for the NATO force since the 2001 invasion. We speak to three soldiers: Brock McIntosh, is an Afghan war vet who has filed for conscientious objector status;

Victor Agosto, who was jailed after refusing to deploy to Afghanistan after serving in Iraq; and Camilo Mejia, the first GI who served in Iraq to have publicly resisted the war.


- Detroit Urban Agriculture Movement Looks to Reclaim Motor City

In Detroit, demolition crews are planning to tear down 10,000 residential buildings over the next four years that the city has deemed dangerous. But as old structures are coming down, the city is redefining itself in other ways. An estimated 20 to 30 percent of the cityâ€™s lots are vacant and there is a growing urban agriculture movement that community groups are using to reclaim the city. Malik Yakini, chairman of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, gives us a tour of D-Town Farm, one of the biggest urban farms in Detroit.


- Detroit Summer: The Youth Program That Inspired Many Activists to Make Detroit a Movement City

To many longtime Detroit-based activists, urban farming and other community-based programs are a prime example of why they see Detroit not as Ground Zero for the recession but as a movement cityâ€“a place that uses crisis as an opportunity to nurture sustainability and community-building. When many of the Detroit-based activists and organizers are asked how they first got involved in their communities, they often mention Detroit Summer, a youth program started in 1992. We speak with Michelle Brown, who is sometimes called 'the mother of â€™Detroit Summer,' and a member of the Detroit Summer mural project.


- Detroit Hip-Hop Artist and Activist Invincible: Another Detroit Is Happening

Invincible performs an acapella version of her new "Detroit Summer" and talks about how youth organizing is transforming Detroit. She is releasing the song this summer on her own label Emergence, which is based on cooperative economics. The website TheTop13.com recently named Invincible the fifth best female MC ever behind Jean Grae, MC Lyte, Lauryn Hill and Queen Latifah.
