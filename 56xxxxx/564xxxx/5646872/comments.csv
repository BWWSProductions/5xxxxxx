,jonesy485,2010-06-24T03:45Z,Props on the heads up about futurama. Anyone going I up Ron and fez today. 
,jjmk1978,2010-06-24T12:38Z,"I'm very thankful that you're going through all the effort to upload these.  I have one question though, is there anyway to increase the volume level?

My current MP3 player setup (PSP and SONY MDR-XD200 DJ Headphones) puts out great sound.  With most songs and podcasts, I can keep the volume level between 50 and 70% without issue, but these recording I need to crank it to 100% and even then I have to struggle to hear what's being said if there is any ambient noise in my vicinity (road traffic, public transit being the main issue).

If there's no way to increase this on the encoding side, does anyone know how to increase the volume in some kind of post processing program?"
,killerz298,2010-06-24T14:22Z,jjmk I experience the same volume issue. If you want a free editing program download http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ and follow the guide here to increase the volume http://www.tothetech.com/blog/software/how-to-increase-volume-of-mp3-using-audacity.html

,LiTH75,2010-06-24T22:59Z,i'm sure shu will come through with today's show soon...

,tsk5565,2010-06-25T02:23Z,WCDMXNAS: Have you upl'd any R&F yet?  The last show I've found is 6-22.
,beerpressure,2010-06-25T02:49Z,thank you very much for providing the show.
,diablo_grande,2010-06-25T12:56Z,kickasstorrents is not coming up :(
[T],shuazien,2010-06-25T17:21Z,"Well, I could not upload yesterdays show here. One of the founding members of the pirate bay has died and the rest of them have decided to hang it up. So good luck to everyone. I have no idea how long the site will still be up, but I don't think anyone can post anymore. I am on Kick Ass Torrents, so you can follow me to there. I am also on Demonoid, but the registration is closed. Invitations are available, but who ever gives out the Invites is semi-responsible for those people whom they have invited and their  actions. I am sorry, but I don't really know anyone of you enough to vouch for you. Thank you WCDMXNAS for getting Ron & Fez out, I was just covering for MotherGoose56 while she was on Vaca. I am also going to take requests for a new site to post on. Let me know what sites you think would be good, and I'll choose one probably next week sometime.
Well... Its been an adventure... I'll see ya all out there.
The Pirate Bay is dead... Long Live the Pirates!!!!!!!
Arrrrrrrrrrr!!"
,diablo_grande,2010-06-25T18:21Z,"That sux balls. I keep trying to open kickasstorrents and I get the good ole ""Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage"". Is the site down too?"

After they finish grieving their friend the Pirate Bay may go back to normal though (hopes)"
[T],shuazien,2010-06-25T23:02Z,Here's hoping.
,Ted_Sheckler,2010-06-26T02:35Z,Thanks as always Shu for your hard work and diligence. I for one will be following you to kickasstorrents for my daily dose of O and A. Long live the interwebs.
,go_yukuri,2010-06-26T09:56Z,"Thanks for all the info. TPB my condolences.  You've brought me hours of TV and Radio.  MG, Shau, and all the fillers I look forward to a new start on KAT.

Thank you kind sirs and madams."
,Squallrm,2010-06-26T16:30Z,"Thanks for the bookmark JD.
I am fine with KAT being our new home.
Thanks to Shua and Mothergoose. My daily
commute wouldn't be the same."
,Tubebaum,2010-06-27T16:38Z,Could you please pick a torrent site that has an RSS feed for each individual uploader's torrents? That was the best thing about TPB because I would be immediately notified the second I could start downloading the newest O&A show. Thanks!
,charliedawg,2010-06-28T18:35Z,"thanks for all the good times TPC

MG56, I hope I can return the favor someday...somehow.

I guess I'll be following my new lord and savior, shuazien, over to kick ass.

,Ted_Sheckler,2010-06-28T19:29Z,"Sad times. Guess it's back to paying 80 bucks a year to audible.com. Thanks Shu, this was good while it lasted."
[T],shuazien,2010-06-28T20:50Z,"I am unable to post here Ted, that is interesting if others still can.  Whats wrong with Kick Ass torrents Ted?"
