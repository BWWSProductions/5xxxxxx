Lots of old-ass shows have talked about abortions... but whatever. Hate on America all you will, right after you download our content. LOL."

I don't hate on America.  That's where jingoistic simpletons fail. I hate on the stupid people in my country that believe they represent the principles this nation was founded upon, while discriminating against anyone and everyone who doesn't look like them or who doesn't believe in the same old man in the sky.

If you believe it is immoral, then don't do it.  In this country, ALL are allowed to choose their own belief system.  It's the assholes who seek to impose their particular beliefs who are ruining this country.

Fuckers probably even still believe that Iraq had WMD and planned 9/11.  Fucking simpletons."

Where exactly does Rupert Murdoch pay taxes, isn't he an Australian born British citizen?"
