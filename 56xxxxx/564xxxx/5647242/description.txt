Margaret Thatcher (PM 1979-90) â€“ was transformative in the history of both Britain and the Conservative (Tory) party. Staunchly anti-socialist, anti-union, and anti-Europe, she spoke long and often of returning Britain to strength and greatness. A divisive figure, often closely identified with Ronald Reagan, she broke the power of the unions and led the UK to victory in the Falklands War. Today, she is remembered with great nostalgia by the right, and is deeply scorned by the left. What is unquestioned, however, is the metamorphic effect she had on British politics; leading to the â€˜New Leftâ€™ of Tony Blair, and ultimately to the recent election of David Cameron.
