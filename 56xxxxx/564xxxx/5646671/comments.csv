[V],twentyforty,2010-06-24T16:51Z,Upload is currently VIP-only.
,lilars26,2010-06-24T17:19Z,You are a V.I.P. in my book.
[V],pluto999,2010-06-25T12:52Z,@lilars26: your book won't help him upload in TPB

[V],twentyforty,2010-06-25T15:15Z,"@pluto: I have loaded ""Kells"" few minutes ago - and have no peers but I see 2 seeders what is a surprise considering that torrent was uploaded on JANUARY 19th. I'll keep it loaded till TPB get up."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-25T15:18Z,"Not pluto, but sdcheeran. Sorry."
,sanyam123,2010-06-25T18:50Z,is there some place else...where we can find you?
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-25T19:52Z,Nope... sorry. Demonoid's name speaks for yourself.
,Stevc,2010-06-26T00:45Z,"Hi 20-40, I hope you are well, and that you have an amazing weekend.

@ everyone else
Hi guys and girls, I think we should try and get our good friend Mr 20-40 a green skull, so that when TPB is broken he will still be able to upload his amazing files, he works very hard to encode and upload these great quality files in such small size, in my country we have a saying "" Klein botteltie groot gif "" it translates to small bottle big/strong poison, it means that sometimes the smallest things are much more powerful then big ones. Small files with great quality, I only trust 20-40's small files.

I hope everyone has a great weekend, be safe and take care of yourselfs."
[V],pluto999,2010-06-26T09:32Z,@all: I agree with Stevc..please back him guys.
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-26T10:47Z,"I've uploaded 1027 torrents here - and I am on TPB six months and change... hit 9000 uploads altogether last week.
Well, I wasn't so smart to upload ONE torrent for EACH song on some CD rip (as some VIP members regularly do)... maybe I should cut a movie in 10 minutes pieces and post 12 torrents per movie?
I'm just kidding.
Guys - small-size is definitely NOT an issue. Titles I choose to upload too. Quality also is not the problem - in such case no one could ever upload a CAM or some shitty encoding - and we have seen lot of that on TPB, right?
So - that's I find extremely stupid all possible ""outbursts"" of haters, trolls and gremlins about this and that - I NEVER would be any different - I am too old, too sick and too long in all this shit.
Also, be aware that popularity and backing from fans never has been a real measure - just remember what happened to a.x.xo here..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-26T19:54Z,"@remy007in: Encoded:
Toy.Story.1995.BluRay.320p.H264.mp4 278 MB
Toy.Story.2.1999.BluRay.320p.H264.mp4 318 MB

Now, we should wait."
,remy007in,2010-06-27T10:48Z,"Hey 2040, when can i expect Toy story 1 & 2? Great to know you have encoded it already."
