,SkulblakaSama,2010-06-24T19:49Z,"Game works flawlessly, the graphics are outdated, year 2005 maybe? Game play is alright, it has the feel of Bioshock or the developers tried to make it like that. 

Overall, I don't really enjoy this game but I'll play this. No other game is out yet, so I don't have much of a choice. 

Graphics 6.5
Gameplay 7.0
Sound 7.5
Story 6.5

,SacredTanakh,2010-06-25T13:10Z,"Just finished the game in about 6 hours.
Ending is like bioshock 2, you get a choice whether to be good or evil, live or die.

I give the game a total of 9/10.

Graphics: 8/10 textures don't load sometimes during the end of the game.

Gameplay: 9/10 they could of added a few more fun features.

Story: 10/10 Story is almost perfect!

yeah DLed was about 14 hours finished it 6 hours later.  Great game! 

Don't listen to the other comments saying it sucks and the graphics are bad, they are great and the game is awesome. "

again don't listen to the people who say this game is shit, its one of Activision's best games.

Its kind of likeBioshock 2, Wolfenstein and Dead Space combined, and if you like even one of those game you will love this. "

BF2 or COD are better a lot. From me 5/10.
It is my opinion on this game... "
,CarlsJR.,2010-06-25T14:37Z,"It's a good game, honestly.

But something is off with the graphics quality.

You can tinker a little bit with it's settings in the registry, but it seems the client ignores settings sometimes. On an ATI I'm completely unable to force AA in any fashion. Textures do the super low LOD popout thing at times which annoys the shit out of me.

Probably dumbed the graphics down for some piece of shit console port.

Still worth playing though."

I ran the game on max and it worked without any issues. 

People who ask why this game isn't so good, the game's graphics are really outdated. Metro 2033 is actually better by a long shot. 
Also the game play can be a little boring. You can download this and try it out, but it is my opinion, but I'll finish the game. There isn't any other to play for the time being. "

Save your weapons upgrades for the chain gun.
Spend your e99 on maxing out your TMD and empowering your Deadlock.
Your equipment should be the one that regens TMD on kills and the one that regens health on kills. (after that blow E99 on health upgrades). Now all you do is throw down a deadlock and shoot everyone while they're frozen."

,infamymw2,2010-06-29T22:58Z,"great game but its to short... completed in 5 hours on normal difficulty. 

small review:

the graphics are great even for an old engine. The TMD is great, you many options in combat with it. Some enemy's are a bit to strong, especcially at the beginning when you only have the revolver, which is not very powerfull against the mutated people. When you are playing for 2/3 hours the game is going to be fun. you tmd is almost fully upgraded, same as your weapons, perks and other stuff you can update.
The boss fights are easy, you dont need a mastermind to bring them down.

only one thing that makes me not to give this game a 10/10 is the duration of the singleplayer its to short. "

i went to nvidia control panel , then 3d settings
in the 3d settings for singularity i overrided game settings
set evrything to maximum , specially filtering

,TRUE_DAT,2010-07-04T22:02Z,The reason it isnt working for half of you is because your computer is not qualified to run games like this. Post your specs first and let people determine. With windows 7 it recommends 2gbs of ram and at least 512 of video memory.
,FireSign,2010-07-05T00:39Z,"@mabencs

That error you get when installing could indicate that your Harddrive or RAM is begining to die out..

Although this probably isnt the case - seeing as this is a torrent download. Its very common that - on big downloads - when the torrent completes, a tiny percentage of it is lost (due to some settings in the torrent app).. The lost percentage leads to the errors during install..

You don't have to re-download the whole torrent. If the torrent is still inside your torrent program (which it should be cause ur seeding right? haha) and the complete torrent is still in the default directory for complete torrents.. Then simply right click the torrent (in utorrent) and click ""Force Re-Check"".

If it finishes checking, and says the torrent is 100% complete, then the error is in your HDD or RAM. 

This has happened to me MANY times with large torrent downloads. The solution was to re-check the torrent, and that usually showed the torrent 'only' downloaded to 99.98%, and the missin 0.02% is what causes the error.

Just recently it happened to FIFA 10 and Sniper Ghost Warrior, the fix was to simply download the uncomplete parts in the torrent."
,somedude.1001,2010-07-05T12:44Z,"The torrent works perfectly no problem at all, but Im using a quad core with 8GB ram.

The game is very easy so its fun even on Hard mode.

As soon as you get the minigun and the deadlock ability, upgrade them to the max, remember to save enough E99 and parts. Once you have these 2 things maxed out you will own anyone and anything come in your way. I also have the shotgun maxed out, very effective to use inside a deadlock (close range) and shotguns ammo is plentiful."

But then he commented that he was wrong and you gad to turn the modem on to make it work.nark123 got it to work through changing settings in nvidia control panel.nFor me i made the program completely trusted in my KIS 2010 firewall settings. Then i played with internet connection on and it worked flawlessly. On one other torrent one had commented that it game tries to access the internet and so the game freezes. I don\'t know whether the game requires internet access throught the game or just one time at the starting. I mean its recommended to disconnect internet before playing pirated games.

This is what cause the freezes.nSolution - First connet to the internet. Then start the game and select Start Game. Then select New Game/ Continue. After the game loads pause it and press Alt + Tab. Disconnect from the internet if you want to. Then click on the game on the taskbar and play without any freezes. (you can keep the internet connection on if you want to)nYou have to do this every time you start the game.

I am running Win7 64bit, ATI 5570, graphics are great, but no sound.

I get the same result  with every version that I Download.

What am I doing wrong here?"
,Tiucaner,2010-07-20T04:19Z,"Pretty damn good game. A mixture of Bioshock and Half- Life 2. Quite short, around 11 hours of gameplay. The graphics are great, however, in an efort to decrease loading to a minimum the gae got some texture streaming issues, u shoulf get a fix for it before u play it."

,a_of,2010-07-20T22:29Z,"So, are you telling me that to play this game I have to run it as administrator an allow internet access?
You are kidding, right?
That's a mayor security risk there.
Running it as administrator (that shouldn't be necessary) gives the executable absolute freedom. I trust Reloaded, but nothing assures me the is a real Reloaded release.
On the other hand, giving internet access is a little suicidal. You are letting the game go to an Activision site, give them your IP and tell them you are playing a pirated version?
No thanks.
Someone must have a better solution."

,Quad-K,2010-08-02T11:59Z,"This is REAL.

Works 100%, besides crashing my graphics card once. It sets up with little effort required, don't even need to change graphic settings, it auto-detects them very well. All you have to do is move the cracked .exe into the game folder, and your done =]

The game is similar in concept to Bioshock, but i find it more realistic in the sense of characters and setting. The graphics aren't mind blowing, but very decent. I experience no lag on a simple desktop set-up, which is an achievement these days. It starts off like a thriller, and is a lot more eventful and interesting then Bioshock in my opinion. Very diverse Weapons and enemies, and a lot of rewards for those that explore there surroundings. Really good game in my honest opinion.

Cheerz AiTB =]"

Welcome to the internet.

Download Daemon tools lite (free version) which allows you to mount the virtual disk. Crack is just copying the folder which is found on the disk which will let you play with no key. You overwrite the existing .exe file with the cracked file.

Any other questions use Google."

,Sinister181,2011-01-13T18:22Z,"For anyone unable to run the game.
1. Download and install the latest PhysX.
2. Go to Control Panel>Sound and make sure that desktop speakers are the only thing listed and set as default (and that there are no conflicts).

3. You could also try compatibility mode (Windows XP SP2), but this didn't work for me."

,ItsxTre,2011-02-21T00:36Z,"does it freeze up when anyone else dies?

,xenosaga01,2011-02-28T23:27Z,"What does it mean by Reloaded exactly? I want to download a clone of the cd, not a repack. Repacks freeze my computer during gameplay even though my computers specs are better than the requirements."

,jzenman,2011-03-30T18:15Z,For people having problems with the error message on Windows 7. Try going into Programs and Features > Turn Features on or off > Make sure NET Framework 3.5.1 is turned on. Don't try and download and install it. It won't install because you just have to turn it on.

,xshadowzz,2011-08-31T08:28Z,"@acidnave

I hardly doubt that your problem has anything to do with the game. Sounds like your processor and/or video card is overheating. "

,shipwreck1972,2011-10-13T07:55Z,Great game! But i'm stuck in a level with an half open garage door. You have to climb up there by using a metal box wich you can move. I guess this is a bug? Because I really can't find a way out. 
,Cleric21,2011-12-28T19:19Z,"Shipwreck>
Age the crate so that it's flat, place it under the garage door, and un-age it."
,blaymoric,2012-02-06T05:10Z,"Great download. If you can't find the Serial, open the NFO. If you don't know how to open an NFO, Delete system32 on windows or the /system folder on a mac/unix and Get off the internet."
