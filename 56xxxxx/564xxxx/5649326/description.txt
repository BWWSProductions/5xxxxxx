44,000 miles in 440 days

An infectious account of six blokes on a cheap and cheerful global circumnavigation via motorcycle. Audacious and seemingly a bit blithe in the best tradition of British Exploration, our crew hops astride their crappy DR 350â€™s and head out on a 44,000 mile journey around the earth and bring us along via imagery and narrative that at times is both hilarious and grave, depending on the climatic or mechanical dilemmas of the day. Whether itâ€™s disintegrating wheel bearings in Russia or Gerald going broke in Alaska and having to drop out of the ride, this is a fun and entertaining undertaking to witness. Great fun and possibly inspiring.
