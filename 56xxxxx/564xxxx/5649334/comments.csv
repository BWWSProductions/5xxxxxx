[T],ctang,2010-06-28T02:36Z,i will do training day and you can do taxi driver...is that ok
,omegafox84,2010-06-28T04:18Z,"sure, sounds good. i'll upload it after these previous three get more seeds."
,theneonraindrop,2010-08-17T08:44Z,so how do I burn this after downloading? thanks in advance
,Yaggy,2010-09-08T12:15Z,No director's commentary in the Director's Cut. Hehe...how intuitive!
,omegafox84,2010-09-18T11:25Z,"@Yaggy: nope, sorry. i only titled it director's cut to identify the exact version of the film itself. if i had included the director's commentary, the movie would have needed to be compressed even more since i don't upload dvd9."
,zerosk8a,2010-09-20T00:37Z,"Anybody have problems with nero 7 recode 2? I cant seem to burn this for some reason.. Great quality, and thanks for uploading; but i was wondering if anyone else experienced that problem?"
,omegafox84,2010-10-06T23:17Z,"@gambitz: sorry, if you want a perfect copy go buy it."
,Totallypirate,2011-07-21T12:12Z,"Hey man could you maybe seed this for a while? That would be great thanks :) this is the only reasonable torrent for this movie, I will seed."
