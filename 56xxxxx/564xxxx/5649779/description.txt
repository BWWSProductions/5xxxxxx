Update:

There's a new version of this sampler with 3 extra songs from 6/18/10 (Seven, Don't Drink The Water, and Tripping Billies).  Use that torrent instead.  I'll have it up here by tonight (Sunday).

===================================================================================


Nine Multicamera song mixes from Dave Matthews Band's recent Deer Creek concerts.  The dates of the concerts were 6/18/10 and 6/19/10.  The songs on this DVD are:

6/18/10:

JTR
Break For It
Lying in the Hands of God (partial/jam)

6/19/10:

Warehouse*
Grey Street
Stay Or Leave
(Recently)
Sweet Up and Down
Watchtower

*w/ Danny Barnes on Banjo


Each song was filtered and synced to taper audio.  Then mixed with other sources of the same song.  HD/720p sources were used where-ever possible.

From ChesterCopperPot5's YTube Master renders.

Enjoy and if you make a show this tour upload any camera/phone vids you take to YTube and perhaps you'll get credit in a future fan DVD.
