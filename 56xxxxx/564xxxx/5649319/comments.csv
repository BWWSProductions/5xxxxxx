But then i found scenetime, and since i started supporting them, i have grown faster. I am now about twice as tall as the cafeteria vending machine and noone dares to tease me anymore.
support scenetime to grow faster!! Guaranteed result."

And yes: Red/cyan glasses are needed but the 2d-version looks ten times better than this. Why did someone even bother?
