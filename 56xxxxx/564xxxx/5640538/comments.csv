A:6 - no bass, sounds like ac3 sound to me. 
M:10 loved it, great for the kids and parents alike."
,Cowboy4ya,2010-06-22T07:44Z,"Watchable, but not dvd quality by any means.  Do have to say though, it was a super fast download.  Like I said watchable (and free)  but since Ive become spoiled by users like fxg, I will wait for a better copy.  Good enough if you just have to see it.  "

Didn't watch more than a a couple of minutes. Will wait for a better release. Agree with previous comments, doubt this is really a screener. "
,atropine1,2010-06-22T17:26Z,"this is quite terrible for an advertised dvd screener. The audio is terrible.

I would not be so harsh if it was label'd a TS or CAM"
,tapper101,2010-06-22T18:48Z,"This is a very good copy, it's just like most screeners. See it, it's an amazing movie.

It's definitely worth the download! Thanks .BONE.!

considering that i watched this whole movie in 3dSCR i'd have to say this DVDSCR is extremely watchable :)


Thanks dude"

Well BONE, then it seems this IS NOT a DVDSCR as listed, if in fact (as you stated) release dates are not set.
You should edit your description to what this really is.

...And yes, I WILL leave it...)"
,mcjiralo,2010-06-27T19:34Z,thanks

,chewster,2010-08-05T16:37Z,definitely NOT dvd quality!
,Isperia,2010-08-22T16:58Z,"This is a TS (TeleSync) screener, not a DVD one. Not the first XviD-ViSiON torrent I've seen this same damn thing with. Don't bother it's a rather crappy quality."
,dlarrym,2010-08-25T06:55Z,"@perryl, You mentioned there was no BASS and that it must be ac3 (as if ac3 is a shitty AUDIO. What is your understanding of AC3??? Your comment that the sound was off due to ""no bass""?? Maybe you do not understand AC3, Is the TOP of THE LINE and is currently the BEST made movie audio format made. AC3 iBLOWS AWAY all prior AUDIO formats such as: DTS, DOLBY DIGITAL 2 and DLBY DIGITAL 1, THX, you name it, AC3 is FAR superior. If it is AC3 sound, IT WOULD HAVE BASS. (AC3 supports 9 channel surround sounds as well!!!) SO If it had AC3, the BASS would have been PERFECT. SO , You should have said:  ""If this HAD AC3 Audio, the Bass would have been MUCH MUCH better, NOT lacking at all so it must NOT BE AC3"", to make your comment make any since. Maybe I am misunderstanding your comment??? If I am not getting your point, and you do know that ac3/AC3 is the BEST and when used, AUDIO should be GREAT, then Pardon my error."
,nas3283,2010-09-08T07:27Z,Good movie.. Quality was also good but V was not up to the mark. Thanks though..

""best u are gonna get till bdrip or dvdrip and dvd release dates have not been set yet so take it or leave it :) ""  There is not ANY WORD in this statement that says it isn't a SCREENER. He only stated it was not a DVDrip or a BluRayDVDrip. A screener is not a DVDRip. It is copied from a DVD but a DVD that was meant for a movie critic or review by the movie academy members (you do know who the academy is. . . as in ACADEMY AWARDS. . . I feel I MUST make things clear because you apparently have some misunderstandings of what is what!) 

This means a screener is NOT a DVD release made for the public to view.

Just for you:
ON THIS SITE, IF IT IS LABELED A DVDRIP, THIS designation MEANS IT WAS COPIED FROM A PURCHASED OR RENTED RETAIL COPY. 

IF IT IS A BR-DVDrip, THIS TOO is a designation that MEANS IT IS A COPY OF A BLURAY THAT WAS RENTED OR PURCHASED.

LASTLY.... A SCREENER IS A DVD OF EQUAL QUALITY AS THE PUBLIC RELEASE WILL BE, BUT IS NOT A PUBLIC RELEASE AND WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN ONLY BY A MOVIE CRITIC OR A ACADEMY MEMBER (to decide if it deserves a vote for an ACADEMY AWARD) OR ANY OTHER PERSON(S) THAT HAVE PERMISSION TO VIEW IT.

So now that you feel stupid, go FUCK OFF!!!!!!! .BONE. did not contradict himself, your ignorance is what caused you to post a bunch of crap that didn't do any good unless your goal was for YOU to appear ignorant. (and you were successful) Oh. . . FUCK OFF again!!!!!!!!!"
,dlarrym1111,2010-09-15T03:29Z,"@perryl: Why did you say that it sounded like an AC3 because it had no bass. Are you an idiot??? AC3 is the most awesome audio you could hope to find used in a movie. You should have said, it must NOT be AC3, because if it was AC3, the bass would be incredible and perfect and great and the bass is lacking and since this is so, there is NO WAY on earth it could be AC3. isn't that what you meant to say??? AC3 is better then THX, DTS, DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1 /5.2 and any other audio format available for motion pictures at this time. I design Amplifiers and pre-amps for PIONEER. sir or mam, You really should speak of what YOU know, not comments left by other bittorrent downloaders. I have heard a similar remark from some other commenter a while back. I figure this is where you get your info. If you read up on audio formats used in modern motion pictures, you would know your comment is STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and is not based in fact but false rumors. It could also be that your sound system SUCKS as bad as your mind functions. Oh yeah. . . go FUCK OFF!!!!"
,dlarrym1111,2010-09-15T03:31Z,"Thanks .BONE. A great upload as usual. I thank you big time!! don't let idiots bring you down, your ARE the MAN!!!!! another good job!!!!
