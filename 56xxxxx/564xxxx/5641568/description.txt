IEEEXPLORE Most Downloaded papers from all of the IEEE published journals

This is a collection of the 'top 10' most commonly downloaded papers from the
IEEE website, ieeexplore.ieee.org, for each of 223 journals. The Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers has a huge range of journals, everything
from 'Antennas and Propagation Newsletter' to 'Evolutionary Computation',
'Fuzzy Systems' to 'Information Forensics and Security', 'Medical Imaging' to
'Robotics and Automation' and 'Space Electronics and Telemetry' to 
'Visualization and Computer Graphics'. There are roughly 2200 papers here,
which are hopefully the best of the best. We hope you can find something you
needed to learn, something you never knew you would be interested in, or
just something you plan to get into later.

Here is just a random selection of the papers we thought would be worth a read:
*Wireless Malware Propagation - A Reality Check
*Ant Colony Optimization for Routing and Load-balancing
*Analysis of a Nonlinear Control System for Stabilizing a Missile
*Stability Simulation Of Wind Turbine Systems
*The TerraSAR-X Satellite
*Computationally Efficient Sparse Bayesian Learning via Belief Propagation
*RFID System Management State-of-the-Art and Open Research Issues
*LEDs for Solid-State Lighting Performance Challenges and Recent Advances
*Real-Time Pedestrian Detection and Tracking at Nighttime
 for Driver-Assistance Systems
*Determination of Human Operator Functions in a Manned Space Vehicle
*Reputation-Based Resource Allocation in P2P Systems of Rational Users

The list of journals is in the file 'list_of_journals'. The list of every
single paper, in a text-based format which you can read or grep, is in the
file 'ieeex-documents.csv'. The papers for each journal are in an individual
zip file named for that journal. This is so you can download only the journals
you are interested in, while still not having too many files in the torrent.

You can browse the papers on the website http://ieee.ieeexplore.org/, whose
very useful top 10 feature inspired this collection. Note that this collection
is not of every journal on the site, but only those one which are published by
IEEE (most but not all). We retrieved and processed the papers automatically,
please let us know if you find any corrupt or misnamed files.

This is MYRIAD's 20th release on tpb. Thanks to all the seeders, everyone who
wrote to us to say thank you, and all the other people who help make tpb great
Infinite respect to tqw, aXXo and wildcherry508 for inspiring us. Love to the
admins, the irc channel and to Brad for starting all this madness. Props to
