,_Zotov_,2010-06-23T13:16Z,"Guys, seriously, ""cue""'s is not for mounting, there are for burning. I mounted ""bin""'s with Daemon Tools and everything went without a hitch.

I checked, and yes, DARKCONSPIRACY.CUE is a little fucked up. So, if, and ONLY IF you are going to burn, then open it in notepad and replace first with: 
FILE ""DARKCONSPIRACY.BIN"" BINARY

otherwise, DON'T TOUCH IT - we need all the seeds we can get."
