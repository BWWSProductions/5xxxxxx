1. Mount -> Install Gc_UK
2. Enter Serial and finish installation.
-  If You are going to install Dark Conspiracy, then:
   3. Mount -> Install DARKCONSPIRACY (.bin file) (in the same folder as GC)
   4. Replace gc.exe in the installation folder with noCD
-  If You only want to install Ground Control, then:
   3. Run Update
   4. Replace gc.exe in the installation folder with noCD
5. Enjoy! And please seed!

If you are going to burn, you should replace string "DARKCONS.BIN" with "DARKCONSPIRACY.BIN" in DARKCONSPIRACY.CUE, sorry for that, my bad.

tl;dr:
Update is not needed if you are going to install Dark Conspiracy.
