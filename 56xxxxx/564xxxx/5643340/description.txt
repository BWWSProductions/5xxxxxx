This is the very last iDump freeware available, it was released on 8th january 2010 but sadly it is not available in the CodersHole site anymore (well, actually it is still there but the link is not visible, try Softonic for it)

Anyway, it was released as freeware and it works perfect.

I wish I had the version history for this release, if you have it please share it.


It has english, german and spanish languages.


so small and so handy


Check it!!
