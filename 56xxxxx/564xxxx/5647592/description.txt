    Though director Michael Kriegsman's documentary has a vaguely            
    exploitational sounding title, AUTOPSY: THROUGH THE EYES OF DEATH'S      
    DETECTIVES is instead a scientific and emotionally harrowing look at     
    autopsies, how and why they are performed, and the pathologists who      
    perform them. Filmed in cooperation with the Los Angeles County          
    Coroner's Office and UCLA Medical Center, AUTOPSY sheds some             
    interesting light on how taboo autopsies have become and how valuable    
    they can be medically in addition to showing uncut and extremely         
    candid footage of actual autopsies, which in many cases are              
    emotionally draining. Perhaps the most moving sections of the film       
    are the interviews with the pathologists themselves, who explain the     
    toll their job takes on their psyche and their families. A revealing     
    and often disturbing look at a side of modern medicine that many         
    would prefer to gloss over, AUTOPSY is an amazing and invaluable         
    account of a world few have seen.
