,trapper7,2010-06-25T15:23Z,...and the SIXTH TvTeam torrent in my client that has never had even the first seed....something's horribly wrong....
,cyber365,2010-06-25T17:02Z,"Thank you TvTeam,Thank you KYR,Great quality video !"
,DeltaPan,2010-06-25T17:26Z,"The Rar'd version of this is  downloading at top whack, 116kbps on my 1.1Mb connection.

Hashcode is E262F4BD0C325C1116206FD7E7B15306AFD3CDAD 

Seed/peer = 10/47

Or Kickass has unRar'd with seed/peer at 02/522 with loads just about to complete to seeds any minute.

Sorry TV Team but people are wanting this and you're having connection issues.

Peace. : )"
,DeltaPan,2010-06-25T17:42Z,"Looks like the Kickass unRar'd version is not completing and stacking people at %99.9 complete without dropping to seeds.

This will be other files not finishing with the AVI finishing fine, just download as usual and keep as a peer instead of expecting it to finish, you'll be able to watch the full .avi so don't worry and you'll still be doing the same as seeding to others even though it's not dropping from peer to seed rank as stuck at %99.9.

This happens occasionally.

Peace. : )"
,trapper7,2010-06-25T19:09Z,"Actually, it's two pieces of the AVI that are missing, rendering it unplayable on the three players I tested it on."
,olleberg20,2010-06-25T20:38Z,"whats this 99,9% come on seed thanks"
,eversorgod,2010-06-25T20:49Z,even GOM player cant open it so this is a failed torrent
,olleberg20,2010-06-25T20:54Z,always this problem with Tv team but thanks anyway
,DeltaPan,2010-06-25T22:31Z,"I assumed it'd be a few kb's of the other files.

Try the latest VLC player.

If anybody says that doesn't play it, BS, i play films and TV shows at %70 complete with it."
,TheN9NJA,2010-06-25T23:48Z,"Actually, VLC -wont- play this file. I'm sure it's bogus at this point. TvTeam officially blows."
,rustedhalo,2010-06-26T00:21Z,TvTeam is top notch stuff. My #1 source for WWE and TNA. I'm sure if this is a junk file they will put a working one up soon. This just aired last night.
