Yes at F*$Â£ing last I had downloaded it not more than 5 mins before posting this I have Farm lessons issue 16 for all of you Guys and gals to enjoy.

I would ask all who love what I have done to post a reply its been nearly a month when it finished on Jabs site and it has taken me that long to find it. So I would like some thanks from some of you.

Before any one says there is a Virus I can say without a shadow of a doubt that there is none.

And as ever download faststone to enjoy each picture to its fullest.
