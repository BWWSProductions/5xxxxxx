Brand new mix album from one of L.A.'s finest Turntablist/Producers.

Just MATTER - Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, & Something...

A glitch, drum n' bass, dubstep, hip-hop, and pop odyssey through both original and "borrowed" songs, remixes, and mash-ups both "old" and "new."

One of the sickest mixes out there!
