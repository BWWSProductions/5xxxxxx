Wikipedia............: Sonny and Chad try to keep their relationship a secret from their fellow So Random! and Mackenzie Falls cast members. However, they keep slipping up and saying the words "Chad" and "Sonny" during their rehearsals. This makes the cast members of both shows suspicious. When they go on their first date, Chad messes up because he is nervous and ends up vomiting on Sonny. The cast of So Random!"  then finds out about their date when the incident is posted on the cover of "Tween Weekly" magazine. Chad blames Sonny for what happened and Sonny, infuriated, breaks up with him. He then climbs through her window into her house to apologize, and shows Sonny a billboard he had made that says he is a fool for her. They then restart their relationship and have a "second first date".
