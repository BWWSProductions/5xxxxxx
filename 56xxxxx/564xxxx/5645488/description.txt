         Geology has shaped human history, but humans are a force      
         of nature ourselves, and we have changed geology. We can      
         see this in action in Indonesia, where volcanoes spew         
         out boiling mud instead of lava, as a result of man-made      
         underground tunnels used to probe for natural gas. On the     
         other side of the planet, we'll travel to the Canadian        
         Rockies to peel back the historic record locked in ancient    
         ice to see how man's earliest agriculture may have sparked    
          global warming.
