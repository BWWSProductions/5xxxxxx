,trendszno,2010-06-25T00:00Z,"Home from Chicago is incomplete and I wanted to have one version complete (Toronto is complete) and I didn't want too much songs twice on the DVD.
If you watch at one go, it could get boring if you hear too much songs for a second time. No soundcheck show is complete on this compilation (on MTM(s) vol. 2 there will be one complete soundcheck).

The only song complete, twice, is Metal. From Clarkston there was also The Good Soldier and Home available but I edit them out as well. Metal had IMO the best atmosphere in Clarkston and I wanted at least one song from this soundcheck show because of good quality and also because of the incredible hat Robin was wearing :-)
With that said you are not the only one I didn't take everything.

However I know what you mean. 

I wanted to give more of a diversity, a varied overall picture than completeness."
