	NOTES:
	
	The episode listing for Cribs is fucked all over the 
	place. Some of the stuff they air now are cut together 
	with segments from different old episodes. Some segments
	are "stolen" from CMT Cribs. We will tag these with the
	names of the people featured as other groups started with
	after S12. 
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
