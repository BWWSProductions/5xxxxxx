,MasakiLHW,2010-06-27T07:50Z,"Thanks, but Xvid is not a good codec nowadays."
,Harry Q Hammer,2010-07-02T13:41Z,"@ MasakiLHW
Parrot that ignorance!"
,riotacey,2010-09-20T00:38Z,"dude...would it have killed you to get us a subtitles track? you do know there is dialogue in chinese right?...other than that, thanks"
,Demonicflair,2011-04-27T07:44Z,@riotacey The part that you are talking about is in cantonese. & look up the subtitles yourself you spoiled lazy fuck.
,Pyrotechnotron,2011-08-01T02:09Z,"Why the fuck complain, you're getting it for fucking free, be grateful!
@Raymondhome, THANKS! Just got back from an Iron Maiden concert and my cousin recommends I see this xD"
,unidiot2002,2011-09-09T01:16Z,"@Demonicflair Cantonese is a dialect of Chinese, dude.
@Masaki WTF are you talking about? xvid is fine. It's fairly small, the quality is normally near dvd, depending on the ripper. Oh, and it's fucking free. If you don't like the codec, grab a different torrent or go BUY the movie. That's like going to the library and bitching about the paperbacks."
,unidiot2002,2011-09-09T01:18Z,@raymondhome And thanks for the UL.
,tommyweiser,2011-10-11T11:13Z,Raymond instead of all that nonsense why not just say pay it forward
,Down-stream,2012-01-28T01:40Z,@pyrotechnorton Haha thats weird ive just been listening to iron maiden all night and for some reason i fancied watching these
