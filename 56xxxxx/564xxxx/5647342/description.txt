In a small town in the countryside, the teenager Amy is overprotected by her widower father John. When she meets the newcomer mechanic Dan, they immediately fall in love with each other. Dan discloses to her that he was cursed when he was a child and turns into a werewolf when the moon is full. Meanwhile the local sheriff, Sam, is investigating the slaughter of people and the murder of several farm animals apparently by a wolf. Out of the blue, the outsider sheriff Charles Thibodeaux arrives at her office and reveals who the murderer is. Bender calls Thibodeaux into the sheriff's office telling him that he had abducted Amy and scheduling an encounter in the city ruins with his old enemy.
