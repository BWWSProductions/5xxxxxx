what does that mean??"
,Airmanxon,2010-06-28T22:01Z,"To Play the Game.
(1) Mount and Open Total Immersion Racing.dmg
(2) Install TIR to your Mac
(3) Mount and Open your Total Immersion Racing    1.0 [k].dmg
(4) Click and Drag the Total Immersion Racing [k] (Car Icon) Into your TIR Folder the installation created.
(5) Place your two dmg's into the folder aswell
(6) Open your Total Immersion Racing [k] from the folder to play. Click Yes on the box that will pop up about updates.

Game should run, if your screen fades to black then comes back to your desktop but bigger, just click the dock icon.
Menu uses ARROW KEYS to navigate."
,Airmanxon,2010-06-28T22:03Z,"Correction, if there is no mouse or the menu screen, press Alt+tab to return to your desktop then click the icon to re enter the game, you should now have a mouse."
,Airmanxon,2010-06-28T22:04Z,"Another Correction: Mouse might not work, either way, use arrows keys.
the game should work, if not send me an email at tinkerxdork@hotmail.com
and ill do my best to answer your questions."
