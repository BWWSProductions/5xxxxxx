,vviivveekkk,2012-04-26T19:46Z,hey what about resolution? quality?
,bollotoral,2012-06-23T16:27Z,"what I still don't understand is why they keep using avi instead of mkv or mp4?? Instead of ripping 175mb avi files you should rip 175mb mkv or mp4 files! We could have much better quality in video and sound in a reasonable size!
People is already used to the 175mb size for a tv show, so please rip in mkv or mp4 in 175mb!! please!! and thanks!"
