,asasinator17,2010-06-22T02:11Z,"@RMJ13 you dont play it online, its just the nazi zombie mode, i got rid of all the online and campaign data except for the zombie mode to make the download as small as possibe

,Cobes26,2010-12-19T17:05Z,"Hey everyone,

Just like everyone else, I get the ""Error during Initialization: Unhandled Exception Caught"" error. This happens usually after it puts 1.13mb on the alloc.

I have switched to the 24bit, 48000Hz (System quality) for the sound, and that didn't work. I have tried running in different compatibility modes (such as Windows XP Service pack 2 and 3, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and I have set it to 640x480 resolution.

I have tried everything, and yet this error still pops up. 

One more thing, I am using **WINDOWS 7**!! I believe no one has posted a fix for windows 7 yet, so I might as well ask in case someone does know how to fix this for windows 7. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks."

,asasinator17,2010-12-27T21:22Z,"IF YOUR A WINDOWS 7 USER:
the path for the activision folder is the same for vista and windows 7, so use the vista path
TO ALL that have directx related problems such as:
Xinput1_3.dll missing
d3dx9_37.dll missing
or for this matter any other .dll file missing, DO NOT just randomly search for the file on google and download it, get the directx updater from microsoft as that is the REAL solution, this will also fix alot of other peoples problems that are being reported such as getting black screens and no sound, YOU NEED at least directx 9 to play this game so make sure you have it 
FOR EVERYONE else who is getting black screens MAKE SURE YOUR GRAPHICS CARD CAN HANDLE THE GAME
Processor:
- AMD 64 3200+/Intel Pentium 4 3.0GHz or better
Memory:
- 8 GB free hard drive space
- 512MB RAM (XP)/1GB RAM (VISTA)
Graphics:
- Shader 3.0 or better
- 256MB Nvidia Geforce 6600GT/ATI Radeon 1600XT or better
@scarabking117 notice the 512mb RAM requirement
they are the minimum requirements for this game, 512mb of RAM and at least a Nvidia Geforce 6600GT/ATI Radeon 1600XT graphics card
the game most likely will not play well with the minimum requirements, so make sure you are at least somewhat above them, if you don't have a graphics card, and are using the standard graphics adapter on your motherboard THIS WILL NOT WORK
@DiMarko make sure you have the console enabled in the options menu, once you have enabled it, try changing maps using the console and see if that works"

So I installed it and it seems to work fine, the only problem is when it loads, I cant see anything. Just a blank screen. I can hear the music for the main menu, and when I move the mouse around it does the clicking noise that it does when you highlight an option, but I can see the game. 
I'm on windows xp. "
