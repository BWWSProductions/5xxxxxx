,Jobo_Nozy,2010-08-12T12:55Z,"Hi! I downloaded this and mounted it using Deamon Tools. It is being recognized (icon is shown in (H:) station) but when i try to start the setup there is no further reaction. 

Does no one else experience this problem???

I cant imagine it doesnt work with Daemon Tools since it has allways worked out fine for me. But than it has to be the torrent or what??

Got any advice?"

,bizical,2010-08-26T17:28Z,"I joined this site just to say a few things.

1-This torrent would be awesome if the program didn't crash every 3 fucking minutes

2-You should install HALION VST Plugin because more than half of the factory sounds are in that plugin alone...

3-Can anybody help me out with my problem where Cubase crashes like 3 minutes after use EVERY fucking time???
I get a message:
Cubase 5 has stopped working, windows is looking for a solution...
a second later:
windows cannot find a solution; closing program

WTF?!?!?!?!?!?"
,bizical,2010-08-26T17:31Z,"Also, to the people who are asking, there is no viruses but it crashes ALOT!

Jobo_Nozy-
You may want to try a different mounting program. I used MagicISO and it worked fine.
Here is their download page:

,generation91,2010-10-01T15:18Z,This crashes so much that it's a pain. The Team Air Release is far superior. ( I'm not a team air fanboy :p )
,Phatsta,2011-04-16T02:40Z,"I've used Cubase 3, 4 and 5. All of them are the same, they crash every few minutes sometimes, then other times it can work perfectly for hours. As far as I can tell from some troubleshooting is that it's due to VST plugins. And considering there's just about nothing you can do without plugins it's just shit really. Also I've had loads of problems with channels. As soon as I've changed the settings for channels it's crashed like crazy. The only way to ever go forward is to save between every change and every new track, and when it crashes restart and load the project.

I've heard from other people that legit installations are just the same so that's not the issue. Just live with it, or get a Mac and go Logic!"
