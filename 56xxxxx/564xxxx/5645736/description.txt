Three unconnected Brooklyn cops wind up at the same deadly location after enduring vastly different career paths.

Tango is an undercover officer on a narcotics detail that forces him to choose between duty and friendship. Having been to hell and back, he wants out, but the powers that be won't let him quit.

Family-man Sal is a detective tempted by greed and corruption. He can barely make ends meet, and now his wife has an illness that threatens the life of their unborn twins. 

Eddie is nearing retirement age and has long since lost his dedication to his job as a cop. He wakes up every morning trying to come up with a reason to go on living... and he can't think of one.

Fate brings the three men to the same Brooklyn housing project as each takes the law into his own hands.
