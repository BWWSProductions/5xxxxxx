Thank You.. :))"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-23T12:06Z,"@seenoevil: 
- The Dreamers (Original Uncut NC-17 Version) is too long and too controversial. 1.34 GB.
- Franklyn (2008) is easy obtainable in 700MB version, as DVDrip.
OK?
In short - I can't in reasonable time. BUT - you can open some junk-email account and drop address here and I can send you a .dlc for jdownloader. If you don't know what I'm talking about, Google or you.tube it."

Thanks for the encode/upload.

Was going to give this a miss until I saw interview on CF Show. Looks like fun.
Hope it gets into the schedule.

Also wondering the 'The Gates', will that make it into schedule? Need to see more to find out if it is worth watching, so far it looks like it might be a bit different and therefore interesting.

Cheers
Jon"
