Music : Classical : Lossless
â€œEvery one of Paul Lewisâ€™s now-complete Beethoven Sonatas series has been selected as an Editorâ€™s Choice. Deservedly so. This final instalment boasts all the virtues of its predecessors â€“ a pianist nimble of mind and fingers, penetrating interpretations delivered with just the right lightness of touch and bold imaginative leaps that can leave the listener staggered.â€ (Gramophone Magazine)

â€œ At times in the towering final sonatas Lewis perhaps holds too much in reserve. Greater firepower could only enhance Beethovenâ€™s visionary thinking, even when the marking for No 30â€™s finale indicates â€œmezza voceâ€, a half-voice. But this reserve also leads to masterful moments. Thereâ€™s No 15â€™s balm and calm, plus the fluent grace in the Op 49 duo â€“ pedagogic trifles for which any overkill would be fatal...buy Lewisâ€™s Beethoven with confidence, and listen and explore for many years to come.â€ (The Times, 2nd May 2008)

â€œSomehow, Lewis's quiet and distinctive voice can lift even the most familiar phrase on to another sphere.â€ (Gramophone Magazine, June 2008)

â€œâ€¦appropriately enough this final volume ends with the last sonata triptych of Opp. 109-111. Lewis plays all three works with characteristic warmth and beauty of tone, and you're not likely to hear them more sensitively and intelligently done.â€ (BBC Music Magazine, June 2008)

â€œThese performances are a transparent act of musical love and devotion. Nothing is exaggerated yet virtually everything is included. Of all the modern versions of the sonatas (an there are many either complete or in progress), Lewis's is surely the most eloquent and persuasive.â€ (Gramophone Magazine, November 2007)

â€œThere isnâ€™t a bar in any of these sonatas that seem ill-considered or hastily characterised; if tempos are generally on the measured side, Lewisâ€™s sense of structure and constant awareness of what the harmonic rhythm is doing allows him to generate tension in the most subtle ways.â€ (The Guardian)

"Faced with such excellence a mere critic can only abandon paper and pencil and listen to this heroic but deeply moving young artist with awe and amazement. These are early days but Paul Lewis's superbly recorded and presented Beethoven may well turn out to be the most musicianly and ultimately satisfying of all recorded Beethoven piano sonata cycles." (Bryce Morrison, Gramophone)

â€œPaul Lewis is a serious artist, and the quality of his playing, beautifully captured by Harmonia Mundi's engineers, is of a very high standard throughout. Particularly fine is the Waldstein Sonataâ€¦ a performance that can stand comparison with the very best. His Hammerklavier is tremendously impressive, leaving us in no doubt of the music's weight and grandeur.â€ (BBC Music Magazine, November 2006 *****)
