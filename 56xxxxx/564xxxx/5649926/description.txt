Scientific studies maintain that eating more plant foods and less animal products can lead to years of better health: a diet which also results in less pollution and impact on the environment, too. For those who would still argue the facts, SIX ARGUMENTS draws more direct links between dietary choices and environmental and health issues, with chapters providing step-by-step proofs on how meat-loaded diets lead to ill health and environmental degradation. While the theme isn't new, it's the reasoned and exact, science-based point-by-point six arguments which are clearer than more general surveys of the issues involved.
