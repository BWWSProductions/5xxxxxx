,DirtyfaceDan,2010-06-25T19:05Z,"So how do i run this, and install it?"
,newguy1950,2010-06-25T20:05Z,Dan if you have win7 drop the files into a folder call garmin/maps. On mine it is c:/ProgramData/GARMIN/Maps
,newguy1950,2010-06-25T20:17Z,If you have win7 on your pc put the files in C:/ProgramData/GARMIN/Maps Make sure you have mapsource version 6137 installed first.
,thelillards,2010-06-27T21:00Z,What is the Map ID?
,newguy1950,2010-06-27T22:29Z,you do not need a map id just build your map with mapsource and send it to your unit or sd card
,zheads,2010-06-30T02:07Z,the maps are not unlocked
,knight8244,2010-07-12T23:09Z,If someone could put a step by step that would be great help.
