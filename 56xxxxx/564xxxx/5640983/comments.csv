,disinfotainment,2010-07-11T23:51Z,Why is the final song by Steve Earl cut off? The makers of Treme WANT you to hear that song. All of these Tremes are ruined by cutting out the final credits and the final song. Too bad.
,joozian,2010-07-19T05:59Z,"@disinfotainment - You are such a twat.  The makers of Treme WANT you to pay for HBO.  If you care so much about hearing the final song go pay for HBO instead of just bitching about it here.  If all these episodes are ruined in your opinion, then quit downloading them and stop your whining.  

Big thanks to eztv!"
