THE AMERICAN STANDARD VERSION of the HOLY BIBLE (1901) - PUBLIC DOMAIN

The American Standard Version (ASV) of the Holy Bible was first published in 1901. It has earned the reputation of being the Rock of Biblical Honesty. Although the English used in the ASV is somewhat archaic, it isn't nearly as hard to understand as some passages of the King James Version of nearly 3 centuries earlier. This translation of the Holy Bible is in the public domain, since its copyright has expired. You are encouraged to download, copy, publish, and use this translation freely.


Please note, this version of the ASV has been modified to remove all line breaks but retain paragraph breaks. - xKronix
