,HellsAngel,2010-08-18T00:40Z,"the serial works great.
but WOW what happened to AVG?????

what TERRIBLE SOFTWARE.

it takes over your computor, gives you no usefull control over how it acts, what  it scans, and it sticks 12 background processes into your system. it ha some kind of firewall but its totally innacessible.... this  is not for anyone that has a laptop or doesnt like having no say in what  happens to their pc."
,firstindianblue,2010-08-24T08:05Z,"The serial works! It worked with downloaded trial versions also. 

There's indeed a FIREWALL. Not sure how good the FIREWALL is - let's see. 

I found 14 processes running for the service! That's just stupendous :)"
