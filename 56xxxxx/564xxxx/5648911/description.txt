 Davis builds his dream house and presents it to Becky   
 with a proposal of marriage. She turns him down. He     
 leaves the house, still with a ribbon running around it 
 and returns to the city, terribly smitten with Becky.   
 He meets Gwen who has an interesting relationship with  
 the truth. He spends the night with her, but leaves     
 while she is sleeping. She takes his description of the 
 house, searches it out, and moves in. The residents of  
 Davis' home town become curious and she invents a       
 marriage, a courtship, and and an entire history.       
 Davis' parents meet Gwen and are immediately taken with 
 her. By the time Davis finds out what has happened, 2   
 things have happened, the whole town thinks he's        
 married, and Becky tells him that Gwen has made her see 
 him in a whole new light. Gwen and Davis agree that she 
 can pretend to be his wife and get free rent while      
 Davis works on Becky until they can announce a divorce. 
 The trouble is that no one in the town wants them to    
 separate and keep trying to help them reconcile.
