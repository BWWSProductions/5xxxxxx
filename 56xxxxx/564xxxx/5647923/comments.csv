,VonNegga,2010-08-17T14:31Z,"The quality of this video encode is awful.  This bitrate would be shabby for 480p SD material, never mind 720p HD.  There's macroblocking all over the place along with a slew of other blatantly obvious compression artifacts.  It completely defeats the benefit of a higher resolution when you starve the bitrate in this manner.  Thanks for the upload, but seriously consider using higher bitrates in the future, especially with movies that are 2 Â˝ hours long like this one."
,WeedPirate,2010-10-29T07:59Z,"quality not so great for 720p, looks like dvdrip"
,umarnawazkhan,2011-03-13T23:23Z,"very poor..don't even look like DVD rip
increase the video bit rate please
or burn from blu ray disk"

,dickles,2011-09-13T19:52Z,"@semipro

when  u  open  the  torrent  ur client should ask  wht files  you  want to  download (i use utorrent and  it  does)  simply uncheck the .srt file...deleting  it from  the  folder  once  its downoaded should work  as  well...all captions i've  ever  seen  are .srt

thanks to  the  uploader!!  and  all  the seeds,  i  will  seed as  well...gettin 1.7 MB/s  right  now  through wifi...woohoo..lol"
,TaZeRz,2012-03-30T12:36Z,its a 600mb rip of a BLURAY which is normally 50gb so if you want decent quality grab the 12gb one its very good.
