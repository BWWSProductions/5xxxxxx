This is not the whole album, just the songs (Once, Even Flow, Alive, Black, and Jeremy) to which people actually (still) listen.  All files 24-bit, 96kHz audio.  This may or may not stem from a digital source (on the original vinyl) but if it is, at least it's warmed up a bit by the tube stage (see below).
