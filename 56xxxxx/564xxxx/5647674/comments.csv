,rickyw89,2010-06-25T14:31Z,not a bad game at all. i personaly think sniping in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is very similar to this. but still the best game to be released in a while.

I have to disagree with you, the game is actually quite nicely made, sure.. It might not be the most appealing for todays standards, but I certainly had plenty of fun with this game.. Just few times got annoyed by how easily some guards spot you through bushes that you can't see through yourself...

Story haven't gotten very far, so no rating
Controls 9/10 standard fare.

Issues - 
The enemy AI sucks.  They can see you through cover, so being stealthy and whatnot (the point of the game) is absolutely useless.  If I can't see them through the brush, they shouldn't be able to see me.  Makes playing this very difficult. 

Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Conviction was a better ""stealthy"" game.

I think I'll try playing through a few more levels, but I'll probably end up deleting this one.  Glad I got to play before deciding to buy.

,sentientphil,2010-06-29T09:50Z,"Many thanks, worked perfectly!

The problem with the AI is that grass doesnt seem to register in their FOV.. it only seems to register 50% of the height kinda thing... also the areas are tiny! lots of distance between A and B, but nothing left and right.... way too narrow, and leaves no variation in getting through the level at all... go left of the map, kill all you see, go right of map, kill all you see, then walk right side and watch the middle... some levels the AI has super human sight and hearing, others they are walking zombies...

im about 50% of the way through, soon to delete... i cant believe i was a click away from buying this the other day!!! im so glad i didnt waste £30 on it! its like a PS1/2 game with makeup!  yeah the ""real"" world physics are ""realistic"" and visuals are great, but replayability and playability are what counts... "

installed very fine.. i just followed the instructions..

a good game actually if you're fond of sniping enemies from afar like me.. i also like the sniping system, which i guess is very frustrating from the start (you'll consider wind, distance etc).."

any way if u go to the game directory
City Interactive/Sniper Ghostwarrior/game
in there you should find 4 DataX.pak files

open up Data0.pak with winrar
scroll down until u find ai_config.scr
open that in notepad
scroll down to were it says Paramater AI (or something like that it's in polish) under there you ca change all sorts of things that can make the game easier for you to be stealthy"

At least that is in my case. After finishing the game in no sound, and 4 days of googling and testing!

The game does not output to your main sound device!
So if you got a second sound device in Dxdiag, usually a modem device, you must get rid of it!
Only one sound tab and it must not being emulated. So increase the hardware acceleration.

Disable your modem device in hardware management (better to remove it physically, like I did!), and remove any drivers from the configuration panel -> phone and modem options!

Game is way better with sound! With 5.1 surround, you can even locate your enemies just by turning!!!

Hopefully will help somebody out there."

,SiEGING,2010-07-06T12:57Z,"Great torrent, works perfectly, it's a shame the game itself is a steaming pile of shite, don't get me wrong, there are a few moments that are very fun (when you actually get to snipe).
The rest of the game consists of horrible stealth mechanics where enemy can see you from huge distance, and through dense foliage.
Once you have alerted enemies you are obliged to kill them, which is a lot easier than staying quiet.
You then get into some normal shooter action, which is absolutely awful, the guns are horrible, when looking down your sights your aim moves as fast as when firing from the hip (normally sights provide higher precision), also moving up stairs is broken when crouching or strafing.
The level design is dreadful,it's like there is no thought put into getting around the level (when trying to navigate a level, I found myself in awkward dead ends too often)
The sniping mechanics are easy on easy/med difficulty, but its too stressful trying to get a one hit kill from a long distance on hard difficulty because of the speed at which the wind changes intensity and direction.

This is my quick review for this game, the conculsion is, download it if you want a few rather fun moments of sniping action, some 'ultra realistic' stealth sections and a huge load of awful FPS action which is not fun at all.

Ok so google DAEMON tools and download the programme. Now the ISO file is the main Unzip file you will download when you open the torrent. Now, use Daemon tools to open this file. It will then install the game for you. Now, Daemon tools makes it seem like there is a Disk in your drive that it is reading the file off - so instead of running the disk right-click and open \'Explore\' - now in there is a file called \'Skidrow\' - open this file and copy the two items in there. Now - paste these files into the main directory of where you installed the game and it should ask if you want to replace a file as it is a duplicate you are about to paste in there. Accept this and overwrite it. Now when you start the game it should run fine :)"

This game's best feature would have to be it's Sniper Elite like feature of following the bullet. Sniper Elite should totally have a sequel on PS3. They would make a pissload of money of it. I mean look at all hype this game got and it's nothing special at all. It is somewhat entertaining tho. Sniping is fun in general. I use to enjoy sniping on Ghost Recon on PS2 back in the day.

I just started the setup, and when it was done, I copied the crack into the directory I installed the game in on my computer.

I mean that ur screen doesn't support the default resolution of the game installation.you have to go to c:/program files/sniper  e.ct. ,find a .cfg (that means configuration file) * (or sth like that) and open it with a notepad.
then,you will see the resolution.change it to match your screen res.
Hope this wiil help you."

What you'll have to do when you don't understand all that computer language, just do this:

you have to copy the sniper_x86.exe file from the skidrow folder, to the directory folder.
You can find the folder after installing, when you go to ""Program Files"" and open the folder named City Interactive.
Then open the folder Sniper Ghost Warrior.
Right there you have to paste the file in the map.
Then your pc asks you if you want to overwrite it.
Click yes and you have the game.

shortly:
1) install sniper ghost warrior
2) Copy sniper_x86.exe in the skidrow folder.
3) then go to Program Files
4) open the folder City Interactive and than Sniper Ghost warrior
5) when you opened the sniper ghost warrior folder, paste it and overwrite it.
6) have fun with playing!"

So I tried just installing the game and replacing the .exe with the ""cracked"" .exe from the SKIDROW folder. It doesn't work because I'm missing a d3dx9_39.dll in my system. I downloaded it and put it in the System32 folder, and the game still doesn't work.

So I tried the regular way that was said in the info box. The only problem is, how am I suppose to mount an icon/image? It's not an .iso, so I doubt there is any data in there...

I've also tried the different steps from other comments. None seem to work.

I have both Virtual Clone Drive and Daemon tools, if that says anything.

Someone please help, would be really great if I could play this game soon. Thanks! :D"

And question, my computer doesn't run fast enough to play this game on the highest graphics like it automatically sets itself to and every time I try to change the graphics and restart the game so they are on best performance it automatically goes back to best quality instead.

Game: 3/5
Tries to emulate CoD but doesn't come close, they even have the same hidden laptop that you try to find.
Aiming sniper rifles is easy but assault rifles is a pain. 
The bullet cam is cool for the first 10 times, then just becomes an unnecessary pause in the gameplay (you can't skip it). The last two chapters become significantly more challenging than the rest, to the point of frustrating.

,Sivos,2011-05-25T03:44Z,"@tussax Sounds like your computer can't handle this game.  Take note, if you don't have at least 8gigs of RAM, you can't play a game very well.  Some games crash when played on a computer that doesn't meet the requirements, and I think that's the problem you have.  I can play this game just fine, but when I put it on my girlfriend's laptop, it crashed when she started it because her computer didn't meet the requirements.  If you have Vista or 7, click Start and right click on Computer then go down to Properties and make sure you meet the requirements.  Also, there are some sites that will scan your computer for a certain game, try that too."

3. checkmark both boxes at the end of installation and hit finish
4. go to program files, citi interactive. open the direct x folder and run the setup for that.
5. now go to skidrow folder and cope ONLY the sniper_x86 file...do NOT copy the skidrow one.
6. go to program files, citi interactive, and paste sniper_x86
