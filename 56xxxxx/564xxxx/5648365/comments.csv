,sonews,2010-06-27T11:44Z,mp3DirectCut (freeware) http://mpesch3.de1.cc/
[V],TheExecutive,2010-06-27T17:09Z,"The commercials are OK, but please 
go back to Mp3.

It takes too long to convert formats,
particularly when I'm uploading a
TV show at the same time (slows down
the computer).

Why are you using ASF anyway?
It's a dead format."
,sonews,2010-06-28T03:54Z,I am not using asf.  That is the format the stream is.  I have to convert them over to mp3 to edit them just as everyone else has to.
,Bumpcityfunk,2010-07-13T05:40Z,Very cool. A lot easier program to edit audio than Adobe Audition. Less system resources and right down to the point. Thank you for the link.
