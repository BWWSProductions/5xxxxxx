Perhaps ""Warren The Ape""  
Warren The Ape is a parody of ""the life of a celebrity"" reality show, focused on the trials and tribulations of a D-grade celebrity puppet who is attempting to clean up his act, patch up his relationships and scramble his way back into the Hollywood limelight with the help of his doctor, Dr. Drew Pinsky.

[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-07-01T04:57Z,"@ Mr. S.  -  It isn't too much to ask. In fact, I am glad that you requested those.

I will upload ""Psycho (1960)"" in the morning.

If I get ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith (1941)""  tonight, I will upload it a few hours after I upload ""Psycho"".

When I get ""The Birds 1963"", I will upload it.

I will be on vacation for a week starting June 4th, but I will try to leave a computer seeding 24/7 while I am gone.  When I get back, expect some new stuff from me.
