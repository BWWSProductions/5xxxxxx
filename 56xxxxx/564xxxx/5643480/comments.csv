[T],extremezone,2010-06-22T13:54Z,"no good english worth downloading copy is out (only few ts mislabeled as dvdscr with big oos) , wait for a scene copy first then you will get a better maxspeed print after"
,angrymole,2010-06-22T23:52Z,"It would be great if someone would take the video from a source like this, and put the audio from the original TS ... even that is better, infact very good and stereo, sound than that on the present English 'dvdscr' ... until a real english dvdscr comes along anyway.

My laptop is proving too gutless to do it here. :("

Still, it's better than waiting til November for the DVD release."
