Video has A head that pops up and down randomly, used one of those sections for the sample. Also has a few spots where there is some camera movement. As for the video we adjusted the RGB, sharpened, denoised, etc. Audio we just muxed the audio from the prism release to our video.

We hard coded subs for the non English parts. Including the 2 scenes in the middle of the movie and all city locations that weren't in English. Enjoy!=]
