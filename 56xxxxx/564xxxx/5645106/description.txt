Mr. and Mrs. Fox live an idyllic home life with their son Ash and visiting young nephew Kristopherson.
But after 12 years, the bucolic existence proves too much for Mr Fox's wild animal instincts.
Soon he slips back into his old ways as a sneaky chicken thief and in doing so, endangers not only his beloved family, but the whole animal community.
Trapped underground and with not enough food to go around, the animals band together to fight against
