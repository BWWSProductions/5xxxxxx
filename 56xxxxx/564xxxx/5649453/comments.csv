,oogleman,2010-06-27T11:59Z,"Alright I will ask the dumb question,
do we need a 3D TV to watch this.??"
[V],catflap,2010-06-27T16:30Z,you need old-style red/blue 3D glasses for this one.
,Miki2,2010-06-27T22:49Z,"Some kind of 2d-3d conversion. Maybe just as simple as timeshifting left eye 1 frame from right eye. Awful 3d in other words.  :(
And yes: Red/cyan glasses are needed but the 2d-version looks ten times better than this. Why did someone even bother?
Crossposting just for knowledge."

,Miki2,2010-07-01T22:16Z,Look again.
