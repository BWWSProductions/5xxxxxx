What is this ? Why does it say DVDSCR if the title reefers to HDTV rip....i'll download it now and comment later

IMO its Season 6 new episode Called "" Rebirth"" and it was leaked since the release date is the 24th of june

Thanks eztv"
,jay3919,2010-06-23T06:39Z,Hell yeah... Comedy Central picked it up. The show was too smart for prime time. No one could understand the humor.
,Tortured,2010-06-23T06:46Z,"This seems legit. Downloading now but I have every episode and have seen them a 1000 times, and all the movies. The screenshot is showing me something ive never seen before. Thank you so much for the up, thank comedy central for bringing back in my opinion one of the great cartoons of all time. Futurama is back my friends! :)"

[T],Skymocker,2010-06-23T20:08Z,"awesome, these new episodes don't air on TV til thursday (6/24), how the hell did y'all get em?"
,paravole,2010-06-23T20:22Z,"Holy crap-on-a-stick I've been looking out for this for about 3 weeks. You sir, are a legend. I just registered entirely for the porpoises of writing this comment. Futurama is best cartoon ever and I have been literally wetting myself every day since I heard it was coming back. Not living in America, I was resigned to torrenting this anyway if I wanted to see it in any sort of reasonable time scale. Note to Comedy Central: sort out international licensing and maybe less people would be downloading your wares. Thank you."
,wilson1375,2010-06-23T22:34Z,Havn't dl this yet but im positive its fucking awesome! Thnx again eztv!!!
,Tatlin,2010-06-24T02:30Z,"Thx for the upload, great quality.. 10/10
That said the episode doesn't meet earlier standards.. In my opinion."
,Wopatoolie,2010-06-24T02:55Z,"i dont care if the quality is ok or not, the file size means its not as quality as the entire 5 seasons i just dloaded (this is 175.14mb and ea. ep i just got is 250mb), meaning tnx but i'll wait until the person i got the previous 5 seasons from ups the new ones"

WHOA WHOA

WHOA WHOA WHOA....

WHOA...

Futurama is back and It took me 3 weeks to find out!?!?!?!?"
,Lucky13s,2010-07-03T02:39Z,"Well that episode sucked, they just justified everything with the most random stupid bullshit.

But I suppose this episode is just a filler between the ending of the last movie and the start of the new series.

Still anticipating greatness from this season."
,Lucky13s,2010-07-03T03:02Z,"Nvm

New Futurama has gone the way of New Simpsons, random unexplainable plots and repetitive retarded jokes every 5 seconds..."

http://subscene.com/swedish/Futurama-Sixth-Season/subtitle-348921.aspx"
,nonukez,2010-09-20T22:31Z,"@ Clawedthecat That is because the DVDs go by the PRODUCTION seasons, not the TV aired seasons. There are 4 production season that spanned 5 seasons on TV. And since most people generally go by the TV aired seasons, this season would be season 6 (or, if some people count the movies as they were also aired on TV, this would be season 7)."
,mnkyby80,2010-09-26T22:13Z,"Has anyone else had any problems with the audio cutting out? I have downloaded the first 6 episodes and all of them have audio problems. Please understand that I am not saying the quality of this download is bad because it may just be my downloads, but I wanted to know if I'm the only one with this problem."
