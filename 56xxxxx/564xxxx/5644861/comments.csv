[V],globeplus,2010-06-23T00:48Z,"Shore . just go to the next folder inside the before emulator version used:

Note: Latest DirectX redist installer is needed to be installed (File Name:	directx_Jun2010_redist.exe

Date Published:	6/7/2010)"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-26T01:28Z,"To masterfaster 2 : ok , that is nice suggestions but you really canÂ´t stable the framerate in some games like in my emulator version and i already comproved in many tests that , so if you use the latest svn keep my lls and support inside the emulator with you , i really recommend that not because is my emulator version , i made many tests analising the emulator comportment i added the correct stuff to stabilize the framerate .

Happy gaming !!!"

pls reply to my comment"
,masterfaster2,2010-06-26T18:51Z,"@globeplus, I didn't say anything bad about your pack. On the contrary, I'm sure it is working great, as I can see that you have experience with this emulator and you have uploaded many Wii games.

Nevertheless, new versions of the emulator with improvements and fixes are out daily. Thus it is good for the users to test new versions. But as you said we can keep your settings and just update the main emulator files.

Thanks and keep up the good work :)"
,loma123,2010-06-27T03:33Z,hey Globe can you add red steel!!! please.

,murrambingi,2010-11-06T01:24Z,"Thx globe,

It seems to run a little slow with Super Mario Galaxy, i mean Mario runs like the million dollar man in slow motion, is this meant to happen? I downloaded the Mario game from you, so i guess what i am asking is that, could it be the game or the emulator doing this?

ps: i have directx11 3D plugin, and a pretty good gaming card for my computer.

Once again thanks for the upload, and keep up the great work. :)"
