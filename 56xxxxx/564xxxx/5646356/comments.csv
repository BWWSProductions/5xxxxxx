,anand86,2010-06-24T08:49Z,"Thank you for PoP Rival Swords. I am under impression that it is almost same (story, gameplay, etc.) as Two Thrones. Is it true? Even if it is thanks for uploading wii action games. Hoping to see more action games. Cheers."

,benoit1,2010-06-24T14:23Z,"can somebody tell me how i can ""iso can be decompressed in few minutes to be used in a reall wii console if it is the case . "" burn this so i can use it in my wii?? is there a specical procedure ?where can i find the instructions on the net?? thanks to whoever can help me"
,Sphaa,2010-06-24T16:06Z,"I'm sorry to say but this release is pointless. Rival swords is the same game as two thrones, except it uses the wiimote. 
If you want to play Rival swords on pc just download Two thrones for pc.

Uploader:
Try to make Wii's POP - Forgotten sands to work with the emulator instead. That would be useful:)"
,Sphaa,2010-06-24T16:10Z,"@benoit1
Your wii need a modchip or softmod to play copied games.

If you have that you can properly burn the ISO in your favorite burner-program. Just use the function ""Burn image file"""
,DEVILsARM,2010-06-24T16:40Z,Do you fight in Rival Swords the Dark Prince instead the Vizier

thanks thats what i thought but I was hopping that maybe something new might be out , as Iam not brave enough to take my WII appart , have tried homebrew .

thanks again for the info"

Just softmod your wii. As long as your not on the newest systemupdate v4.3 you can follow this guide, it's really easy. 
http://wiinewz.com/forums/index.php?/topic/8129-wii-softmodding-for-dummies-all-in-one-ftutorial-and-files/

After that you can install a ISOloader so you can play games from a USBdrive:)
Just read some on the forum I pointed you to, there is much fun to do with softmod:"
,veronika109,2010-06-26T01:43Z,"Hello globe how are you i hope everything is fine i have a suggestion if you have some spare time can you upload Persona 4 for the ps2 i played it in a friends pc and it works nice with 60fps its a pretty cool rpg and i didnt find good torrents here at TPB they are a few here but atr wayy too slow like 3to9 kb/s 
Take care of yourself and thanks again for all the great stuff youve been uploading especially mario galaxy 1 and 2 and just cause 2 i just love your realease as they are one of the best around here
I have another question its about POP forgotten sands crack do you have some contact with guys at skidrow cuz ppl starting to say it cant be cracked so if it is true ima just gonna buy the game"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-26T14:25Z,"I have the latest pc games for a real nice size for some reason in the next couple of days i  am getting an inconvenience with the image code to upload files , is any specific browser or something that is needed to the image code be corrected ? well , i have the latest pc games available at my blog . thank you .

note : i upload in here when it will be possible ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-26T15:14Z,"in the before comment i didn´t mean in the next but in last couple of days i can´t upload , my files are really excelent work but i canú upload them for the moment , still a borring image code indication with a x without the letters beeing showed and then i simply can´t upload , they are available at my blog . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-26T19:58Z,"Itlooks like the vip users can upload for the moment because they don´t need to input a image code ,  checking the last 30 torrents or something , only vip users maded uploads , so for the moment pirate bay is a torrent site only for vip regustrators of the torrents ."

thanks i have already installed homebrew on my wii will try the complete procedure . by isoloader, do you mean a program like isobuster or the actual program isoloader.

thanks for the info and that is a great website
much fun to be had in the next few weeks , finishing up metro and starting singularity and messing with my WII"
,Sphaa,2010-06-27T16:33Z,"benoit1

I mean a program for the Wii that's called USB loader, not ISO as I said earlier.

After that is installed on your wii you can use a program on your pc (wii game manager) to copy wii games on a USB drive, and then connect that USBdrive to your wii and play games without using DVDs

I have an 120Gb HD connected to my wii and I have not used a DVD in my wii for over a year:)"
