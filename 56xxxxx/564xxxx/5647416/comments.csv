,sybex2010,2010-06-25T22:47Z,305 leechers and not a single seeder TvTeam come on the torrent is just a day old. 
,VEGA83,2010-06-26T14:14Z,I'm at 99.9% too... but I'm gonna watch the episode even though a little block of information is missing.
,sybex2010,2010-06-26T15:46Z,99.9% is the whole file...meaning your download is completed.
