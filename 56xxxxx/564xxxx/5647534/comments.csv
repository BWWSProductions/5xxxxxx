,fatmacman,2010-06-24T22:38Z,"Dear encoder, aka Crunchyroll.... I will never download one of your subs again... your constant flashing of your website at the bottom of the encode was obnoxious and rude, and it totally ruined the watching experience for me... I say to everyone to avoid this DL and go find a better encode.  Peace"

,scavengeriel,2010-06-26T07:56Z,"i have a better idea fatmacman... why dont you do the translation, timing,uploading of the video yourself instead of complaining...
