,nsofast,2010-06-21T03:31Z,How the hell does BBC three get this before we do?????
,silver5517,2010-06-21T03:39Z,They're 4-5 hours ahead of the U.S.
,PhilLesh12,2010-06-21T04:42Z,"@nsofast,

they didn't get it before the US.  Fox refused to air this episode in America because lois has to decide between keeping or aborting the baby she was a surrogate for.

Apparently British people are more intelligent and mature than Americans, and can handle such a scary topic like abortion.

Fuck, america is being pulled into a ditch by its dumbest and simplest ""citizens""."
,macavity81,2010-06-21T04:44Z,"so umm, where's ep 20?"
,PhilLesh12,2010-06-21T04:50Z,"Ep 20 was released on DVD in December.  

You should be able to find the torrent by searching for ""Something, Something, Something, Dark Side"""

,PhilLesh12,2010-06-21T04:53Z,"I loved the PSA about abortion, with Ziggy the Zygote and the crazy beliefs of ultra-fundamentalist christians.

That was probably the part that really would have pissed off all the simpletons."
,PhilLesh12,2010-06-21T05:00Z,"@nsofast,

What truly baffles me is that all the morons that watch Fox News Channel and really buy into all that anti-democratic bullshit, and actually BELIEVE that they are pro-america.

All totalitarian regimes are built upon the foundations of mistrust of ""others"" and rampant fundamentalism.  I'm just surprised it's taking this long for Rupert to help convince Americans that the Unified World Government is great for America because, fuck yea!, we kick ass!"

Sorry that I touched a raw nerve with you.  Go shoot an abortion doctor and demand we deport anyone with brown skin."

,skweets,2010-06-21T09:24Z,Thanks for this. :0)
,PelTron,2010-06-21T11:05Z,"Thanks for this EZTV.

Got a question though, why was the word ""fuck"" bleeped out? On any channel in the UK if it's past 9 you can swear. So I assume the makers of Family Guy must sensor it, is this correct? I always assumed it was FOX hat sensored the content. Let us know guys.

PeaCe"
,arildus,2010-06-21T11:10Z,Thanx;)
,PhilLesh12,2010-06-21T11:17Z,"@peltron,

Either it airs on BBC 3 before 9pm, or Fox ships it out precensored.

Do they have crybabies who whine about dirty words over in England like we do here in America, or is it just the weak-minded drones who work for Fox being to eager to please their fundamentalist leader?

Interesting."
,ghosthud1,2010-06-21T11:31Z,"Great torrent eztv. Still seeding.
This episode is surely gunna get some sort of an uproar :D"
,Coxy_UK,2010-06-21T19:16Z,"@Phil
I'm surprised by what you guys aren't willing to air over there sometimes. I guess some of the channels are so uptight. If this isn't acceptable for the American public, I hate to think how they would react to a certain Brass Eye special (I think still the most complained about episode in British TV).

@Tool
Well done, spelling and punctuation all correct, what a clever boy."
,gsp8181,2010-06-21T22:16Z,"I didn't see anything wrong with the episode watching it in the uk, america land of the free eh?"

no the bbc bleep fuck and cunt 24/7 well most of the time anyway"

thanks for reminding me about that brass eye special, its outstanding! anyone who hasn't seen it, find it!  "
,PelTron,2010-06-23T00:29Z,"@PhilLesh12 It doesn't air before 9, after 9 usually stuff doesn't get sensored."
,PelTron,2010-06-23T00:30Z,"@manutdthug That's the thing though bud, I didn't think they did, I've watched plenty of stuff on the BBC that 'fuck' has not been sensored, 'cunt' on the other hand is a different matter, people get well arsey about that word, personaly I'm really not bothered."

,EastStandManc,2010-06-23T01:12Z,"@Hypomanic 

Well how about that? A Yank supporting the Limeys and a Limey (me) supporting the Yanks, all because of faux-patriot fundamentalists on their respective sides."
,djcreativ,2010-06-27T07:49Z,Is is just me or is the audio a little bit high pitched?
,zammysage22,2010-06-28T17:47Z,"Just think of it this way, If the tv channels allowed swear words and nudity the FCC would have them canceled in almost 10 minutes. So they don't put that stuff on the air because they are afraid.

Great Torrent! Great episode! been wanting to watch this for a while."
,SGAK,2010-06-28T20:45Z,How come American shows get censored in the first place? Don't you have freedom of speech in your country? 
,Tarzan1216,2010-07-04T19:13Z,"@SGAK 
yes but a bunch of whiny bitches complain that it offends the viewers by showin it so they decide not to show it or they will get sued and get the show off the air or cancelled (im not sure if theres a difference im a noob when it comes to my rights im only 15) "
,chris2881,2010-07-12T18:14Z,"I downloaded this last night and couldnt get online today. I had to click to agree before it would let me online. I called my ISP and they said it was family guy I downloaded that got flagged. I did d/l 2 other episodes so it may not be this exact one. Is there any software I can get to make sure this doesnt happen again?nnThanks for any help, I\'m fairly new. I browsed the forum and couldnt find anything."
,dinosaur58,2010-09-14T11:04Z,"Thanks for this! The unaired [in uptight USA] episode. I wish there was a 720p or even 480p version, but at least I get to watch it."
