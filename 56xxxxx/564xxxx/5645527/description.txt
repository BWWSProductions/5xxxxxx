After Patrick Northern lost his job, he and his family need motivation to get back on the right track. His wife, Kim, has taken on the role of sole 

breadwinner, causing a serious blow to Patrick's self-confidence. Meanwhile, his 14-year-old twins look to him for direction, and since Patrick lost his 

drive to get off the couch, so does his family. During Jillian's stay, the family gets active with a step competition, roller-skating, and they throw out a 

deep fryer that has attributed to their weight gain.
