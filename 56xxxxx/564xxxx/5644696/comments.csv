got it working on windows 7 and can't do anything. anti piracy I guess hahaa.. I will seed it, see if anyone there could help me."
,DoctorAbobo,2011-06-07T00:29Z,"I just tried it on a different computer, works perfectly.  Make sure you read the readme, the most important part is to change the compatibility to windows 95.  After that, just click on the shortcut on your desktop (not cool launcher!!) and voilÄ‚ , you get to play pokemon play it v2!"

,DoctorAbobo,2011-07-25T18:27Z,"JoNo013, what OS are you on, and have you followed all the instructions exactly?"
,twitchysinner213,2011-09-01T13:54Z,"I downloaded it great, was nice and fast. I open the game but when I choose the first game, aka basic the girl isn't on the TV on the middle of the right hand side telling me what you're suppose to do.
I remember that's what she did when I had the CD itself. That's why nobody can click on anything."
,Poohat,2011-10-19T16:42Z,"
I downloaded this torrent because my original CD is scratched badly. Thanks for it.

But.. I also have the same problem as the others: The program starts up and runs fine, but I cannot CLICK on anything. Anyone know how to fix this?"
,Poohat,2011-10-19T17:01Z,"Actually, I tried using my original CD in the D: drive, instead of the mounted one in F: and E: virtual drives... and it worked fine. 

I assume if you mount the image as your defualt drive, or burn it onto a cd and place it in your default drive, it will work. "
,Andras_99,2011-12-29T21:26Z,"Ok i found out how to get this thing running. 
Go to Resources->Movies in your image. Copy the Movies folder to your game in the Resources folder. For some reason the instalation skips it. Enjoy :D"
