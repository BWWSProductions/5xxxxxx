2. Open start menu, and then open computer.  

3. Right click the mounted image, and select open. 

4. Find the file that says "setup". (the .exe file)

5. Right click this file, and select properties. 

6. Open the compatibility tab, and from the dropdown menu, select windows 95.

7. After you have done this, now you may click on setup, and proceed from there.

I also take requests for old games that you may want to play again.
