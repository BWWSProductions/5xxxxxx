Thank you for your efforts and keep it coming ;)...
Installed the whole suit, by the way, and still works perfect! If one just forbids the programs to phone home (what they do try despite the modified hosts file), everything is fine.
Are you going to up the ""Total Training""-DVDs for the all the progs?"

I openend the .daa file in Power ISO, but it also tells me that there is no program associated to the file."
