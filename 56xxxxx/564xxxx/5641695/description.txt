We missed a few files essential to this addon in our release. It wasnt
noticed during testing, as this is also a bug that affects this game in
Windows 7, even when properly activated. The bug in question is caused by a
part of Securom which does not work in Windows 7. Thats right, the
publisher of this game implemented a feature to annoy the likes of us, while
leaving customers with a non-working game. Apologies for the messup, we
present you with a fix, which should also fix said bug in activated copies.

1. Unrar.
2. Copy over the cracked content to the install dir.
3. Play the game.
