Even if it is as stated it is the last version.

You should download before you comment."

The current rev. is available here...http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5664939/Cisco_Network_Magic_Pro_5.5.9195.0_TeaM_RCP

You are wrong about this being an Old Version.  The fact is it is just a different Revision.

Do you know what  the difference is Athlonite?

Good Luck and Please SEED!!!!"
