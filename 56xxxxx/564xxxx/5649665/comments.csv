,bigturd,2010-06-28T10:33Z,WARNING AVG detects Vundo virus in the crack.
,police01,2010-06-28T10:47Z,"Cool, hehehe, cant wait"
,VVolfman,2010-06-28T11:01Z,"@ Bigturd WARNING AVG detects yet another dumbass on TPB with their virus detector on a cracked .exe. There is no virus, the crack works just fine. Try running AVG on your skanky ass mother, I am sure all sorts of alerts will pop up!"

,bigturd,2010-06-28T15:15Z,"@ Wolfman  Yeah an anonymous uploader uploads a Vundo infected crack onto Pirate Bay before any other trusted uploader uploads a clean one... Hmm.. Standard defense is to say to ignore your anti-virus and run it anyway... Uh huh, exactly what they'd want you to do so you get infected...

Fuck it. If you guys want to risk getting infected with Vundo, go for it."

[T],Knaster,2010-06-29T00:44Z,"It's no vuirus in this one and i have had no problems playing. Apart from extremely long loading when ending the ""Coltan blues"" mission."
,mostwanted115,2010-06-29T01:02Z,"@Knaster 

Thanks. Have you installed the patch mentioned in the description (1.0.6)? is it an ARMA 2 patch or arrowhead patch?

and what are your system specs?"
,SweRaider,2010-06-29T01:02Z,"worked great, installed it over my old arma2 and enable the old mods in the game, campaign was shorter than I expected, but they only worked one year on it so, 15 tutorial missions and 9 campaign missions, think its supposed to be more noob friendly for some people"
,bigturd,2010-06-29T11:10Z,"Wolfman, I owe you an apology. I just bought Norton anti-virus, and the crack is clean.  Forgive my mistrust of anonymous uploaders. My piece of shit AVG has let me down. 

I ran AVG on my skany-bitch mom and got 42 infections found. Thankfully AVG is a piece of shit and they were all false positives.  I think."
,police01,2010-06-29T12:26Z,Installations is English or German?
,VVolfman,2010-06-29T22:00Z,"Don't worry about it, AVG has always given me false alarms on cracked .exe's saying trojan this and malware that so.

See, I told you alerts would pop up with her. :P
"
[T],Knaster,2010-06-29T23:48Z,mostwanted115 that is an arma 2 patch. But you dont need arma 2 toplay.
