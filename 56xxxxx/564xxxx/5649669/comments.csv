,D0gmeat,2010-06-27T10:21Z,I would imagine it is 3D (red/cyan glasses kind) as there was an R5 release the other day. Though I am holding out for the 3D BDRip... :)
,Miki2,2010-06-27T22:49Z,"Some kind of 2d-3d conversion. Maybe just as simple as timeshifting left eye 1 frame from right eye. Awful 3d in other words.  :(
And yes: Red/cyan glasses are needed but the 2d-version looks ten times better than this. Why did someone even bother?
