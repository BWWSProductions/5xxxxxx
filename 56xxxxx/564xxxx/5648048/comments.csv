I have already tried reinstalling but to no avail.
My system meets the system requirements.
system specs:dual core 3GHz,2 gb ram,9500 GT graphics card.I can run all the latest games at high graphics.
Is it because I am using a 32 bit machine(because when i try to use the uninstaller,it says only 64 bit machines are supported)???Plz help!"
