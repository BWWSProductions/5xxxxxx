    Ex-assassin, Dina Lo Bianca, receives an offer she cannot refuse,        
    thrusting her back into the world of hired guns, espionage and           
    surveillance. With the help of her young sexy protg and Dina's new     
    straight-laced love interest, the femme fatal uncovers a sinister        
    plot involving murder, terrorism and international intrigue. Dina's      
    intended target leads her directly into the line of fire and exposes     
    those around her to the dangers of dealing with terrorists and a         
    maniacal and deadly opponent. Hunters become the hunted, identities      
    become obscured and deception becomes as crucial as the truth.
