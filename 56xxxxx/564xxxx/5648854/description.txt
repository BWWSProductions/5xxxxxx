[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Knight And Day

Sources used are relizlab video and prisms audio .....thanks to both.
Well the video was ok not too bad for a cam but like all cams had issues ....camera movement,too strong on the chroma,looked
a bit washed out and the rgb colours off....specially the red.
Audio seems to be insync after scrolling through prisms release,so nice job guys.....the audio itself seemed ok for cam but a bit lifeless and
also had some noise to it and tinny.
Worked done well firstly we stripped prisms audio and remastered it in adobe audition ...using a hiss and noise filters and also changing the EQ,
adding more bass and adding some depth to the voices.Then it was a case of resaving and muxing to our encoded video.
The video .....well for this we messed with the rgb colours to try and balance them out also added more contrast and lowered the brightness a touch,also
needed to lower the chroma alot.....and finally used a smoother aswell.

Enjoy :)
