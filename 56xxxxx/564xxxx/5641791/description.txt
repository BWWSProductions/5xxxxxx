Hello.
There's a new season coming along with a new various music selection.
This time to some of you it may actually seem that there are too many songs that have something to do with love or "love-derived" stuff, well, that might be simply because, in most minds, summer is
considered to be the season of love making/giving/sharing and whatever else (Of course I don't mean that other seasons are supposed to be completely love-free, not at all).
Be careful not to let the love tear you apart though.
In the meantime you should be definetely thinking of visiting any of the summer music festivals if you have an opportunity to do so because such times are usually just unforgottable.
Also you may have already noticed the "side" project of me and daKradha called "Snipe The Hype", so expect its follow-up very soon as well.


I wish you would find love of your dreams/enjoy this playlist/be happy forever/ ...
