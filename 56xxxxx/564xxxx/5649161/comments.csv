Use daemon tools or another image mounting program, i prefer daemon but i hear alcoholic 120% is good.. Use Nero Recode and make sure the ""shrink to fit"" is selected. I uploaded it full quality so thats why the file is so big.

The next upload will be:  Shawshank redemption. I do take request on stuff i have, so if you have something you want uploaded (2 years or older) and i have it ill be happy to upload it. "
