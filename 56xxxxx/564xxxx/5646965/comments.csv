I have no fakes or shrinked uploads. 
The Scratzz have the real thing."
[T],TimemiT,2010-06-24T15:13Z,"@alderbaran&Scratzz!

Keep your stupid comments at Scratzz torrents, there is nothing wrong with the NeRoZ uploads other than your lame comments.
Thank you...

,Pugge93,2010-06-26T22:45Z,Tested to burn the file with Nero and ImgBurn and neither of them could recognize the file. Anyone got an idea how to burn the file?
,mirelurk,2010-06-27T01:12Z,"@Pugge93: Yeah, you need to rename it to .iso. Because the muppet who uploaded this thought it would be so awesome to not give it the proper file ending.

This is legit, as far as I can tell. I renamed it to .iso and loaded the file in VLC. It's a DVD, for sure."
,Pugge93,2010-06-30T11:57Z,"Thank you mirelurk. 

Yeah, this is legit. Just rename the file to .iso and it will work perfectly!"
