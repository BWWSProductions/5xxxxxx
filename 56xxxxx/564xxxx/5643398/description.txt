    Starting with The Wolf Man (in 1941), Universal Studios made five        
    movies featuring The Wolf Man, a character portrayed by Lon Chaney,      
    Jr. Monster by Moonlight! explores these movies. Rick Baker explains     
    how the make-up was done on Chaney's character. Screenwriter Curtis      
    Siodmak took very little from earlier werewolf legends, providing his    
    own story for some of the films. This documentary displays clips from    
    several other movies, including Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein      
    (1948) and House of Dracula (1945).
