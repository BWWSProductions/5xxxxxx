Review

See, the dogâ€™s got teeth like razors ? and he usses them to bite! On â€œDog Eat Dogâ€, the brand-new single from Mexican Hard-Electro-legend Hocico, shouter Erk Aicrag and sound wizard Racso Agroyam are as aggressive as never before. A catchy-as-hell hook line meets the most brutal vocal escapades and the hardest beats the duo has ever unleashed: a relentless aggro-fest with a distinctive hit-appeal. The new single also contains four bass-laden remixes from Solitary Experiments, Aesthetic Perfection, Diabolic Art and Arsch Dolls as well as the exclusive b-side-smasher â€œEscape The Spell.â€ â€œDog Eat Dogâ€ will also be released as a 7â€ white vinyl, limited to 666 copies and sporting the exclusive b-side â€œBreathe Me Tonight.â€ A massive appetizer for the upcoming album â€œTiempos De Furia!â€ Hocico will be touring in autumn!
