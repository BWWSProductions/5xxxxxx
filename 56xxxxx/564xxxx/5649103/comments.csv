,jdarl,2011-01-28T03:16Z,"Doctor Who: Season 5 Was Released In 2010 On DVD, But Good Torrent Anyway..."
[V],manOtor,2011-02-07T02:28Z,"Since the show started in the 60s, there were some seasons and then it was on hiatus for several years, before BBC revived the show for another run and so forth.
It says 2005, because this run of the ""Doctor Who""-Series started 2005.  This is Season 5 of the same run."
