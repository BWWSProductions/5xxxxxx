Doctor Who Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Complete Season 5

The Doctor is an alien adventurer called a 'Time Lord', seemingly the last of his race, who travels through time and space in his TARDIS battling evil where he finds it. In this season...
Heavily damaged, the TARDIS crash lands in a rural area of England. As it begins to replenish its energies, the newly regenerated Doctor settles within his surroundings, and meets a young, feisty Scot, Amy Pond. He's forced to leave briefly, but when he returns, he discovers that an alien is on the loose and Earth is 20 minutes from extinction.

This is the beginning of the fifth season Ã¢â‚¬â€œ staring a new doctor: Matt Smith.
I had to give him a chance, as he wouldn't convince me right away, but after telling myself over and over that his chaotic behavior is a result of his recent transformation into the youngest version of 'the doctor' yet, the series was quite watchable. And Karen Gillan (as Amy Pond) is the sexiest companion the doctor had so far, making up for Matt Smith trying to be a second David Tennant. But throughout the season he more and more finds his own way, which is why I'm even looking forward to season 6 (which is already confirmed to come in 2011), cause I hope the storytelling (what really convinced me to watch the whole season 5) will keep it's level.
No Trailer this time.
