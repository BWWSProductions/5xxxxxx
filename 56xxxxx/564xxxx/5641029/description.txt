OTI - Oil Treatment International 

This is from their website http://oti.ag :

"SOT 11 and LOT 11 are single application products, which promote rapid natural biodegradation. This means: â€œApply and walk away!â€ Combined with the fact that there no longer is any need for expensive disposal procedures and/or additional remediation associated with the application and handling of typical chemical products, the total cost of any oil spill cleanup is significantly reduced.

The cleaning of animals contaminated with oil, the cleaning of harbor walls and the cleaning of tanks are also single applications. To safely and effectively dispose of the resulting washings the application of SOT 11 is required.

OTIâ€™s products are long lasting when stored in a suitable environment. The advantage of this is that you do not need to replace the product as often!

Because OTIâ€™s products are entirely made of natural components there are some significant benefits: Neither OTIâ€™s products nor the resulting substances from biodegradation are toxic. Therefore there is no danger to fauna or flora at any time! There also is no risk since the neutralized oil is non-toxic, too.

OTIâ€™s products are the first products offered worldwide based on true biological degradation, the competitorâ€™s offerings are chemical, hazardous and more expensive.

A number of tests have been made with positive results. The tests of independent laboratories in various countries showed results that proved to be even better than the results of our own lab. All tests proved that neither OTIâ€™s products nor the resultant products of biodegradation are toxic. All tests also revealed high bioremediation effectiveness of our products.

All products are available. Although OTI consistently invests in R&D, the products presented on this website are available and work as designed.

End-users come from a widespread industries. In particular, oil spill fighting companies and organizations, and companies specializing in the cleaning of soils and disposal of oil."

Comment: This is a small but fascinating video-clip. There seems to be a solution to any problem. But then, those who were to stupid or corruptible to prevent a problem in the first place, aren't they also too stupid or corruptible to remedy it? These products seems to actually work, and were successfully tested and licensed in Great Britain. Watch this, especially if you're an American. After all, someone will have to save your country, why not YOU?
