Pinkerton 2.0

This is an unofficial release of Weezer's best unreleased pinkerton-era songs. The goal was to create a sequel to one of the greatest albums of all time. I've arranged these songs in a way so that they make a good listen that is cohesive and also tells a narrative. I've also created a new matching album cover.
Enjoy.
