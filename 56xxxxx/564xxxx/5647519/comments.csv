,impulseman37,2010-06-25T19:14Z,Well its cool but the default language is Chinese and you can't change it. Don't waste your time with this at all. Waite for someone to upload the English version. 
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-06-26T12:22Z,Guys stop crying and keep seeding.... its free!
,impulseman37,2010-06-27T03:47Z,"Hey its one thing that it free, but if the default language is locked to Chinese what good is it going to do anyone else. I followed the link and downloaded from Microsoft directly. Yeah its only good for 180 days but I can build it in my own language and test it right. "
