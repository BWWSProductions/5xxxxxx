It appears you're right. The Blu-Ray release will only be in November 2010. Therefore, this then has to be a DVD upscale, I've included it in the description, thanks. But the quality is pretty good.

But if you are picky and want TRUE 720p, then you will just have to wait until the official Blu-Ray release I guess. Sorry for any confusion/inconvenience. But like I mentioned in the description: this is only a convert of another rip out there. "
