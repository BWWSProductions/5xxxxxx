I take no credit or blame for the quality and the rip. I just wanted to share it in a more accessible format, since the above is the only high resolution version of this movie available out there, that I could find. The Blu-Ray release is only in November 2010, therefore this is most likely a DVD upscale, but the quality is decent. Screenshots in comment below.

My upload speed isnâ€™t great but I will stay online until there are enough seeds to carry this on, after that you are on your own. Youâ€™ve heard it all before, but..

PLEASE SEED WHEN DONE!

Enjoy!
:)
