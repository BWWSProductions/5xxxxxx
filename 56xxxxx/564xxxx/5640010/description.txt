Deth Red Sabaoth will be the first release of new Danzig studio material in six years, since 2004's Circle of Snakes. However, in these six years, frontman Glenn Danzig had released his second solo album, entitled Black Aria II, in 2006, while Danzig (the band) released a compilation of previously unreleased material, entitled The Lost Tracks of Danzig, in 2007.

Deth Red Sabaoth will be the first studio album to feature bassist Steve Zing (who joined in 2006) and drummer Johnny Kelly (who once joined Danzig during their 2002-2003 tour, but became a fulltime member in 2005). It is also the second Danzig album to feature Tommy Victor on guitar.
