,ellinaras,2010-06-22T05:46Z,why the file is so big and now the usually 350MB
,Thermo18,2010-06-22T06:10Z,"One fast dn, hit 1.5 mb/s, thanks for the upload will seed my share. 
A-10
V-10"
,SystemFolder,2010-06-22T06:54Z,"There's a few reasons why the file is bigger than most. For one, it's HD widescreen. Also, it's HBO. No commercials. So the hour long show is really an hour long; not 45 minutes.

BTW: True Blood is a must see. You will most likely love this show. I have been watching it on HBO since Season 1 Episode 1. Also don't forget to check out Snoop Dogg's video entitled ""Oh, Sookie."" HBO aired it just after the airing of this episode."
,citybybay,2010-06-22T11:40Z,Downloading great at 120 kB/s.  Thanks extv.  Keep up the good work.
,-Cortex-,2010-06-22T13:01Z,"@SystemFolder - It's widescreen, but it certainly isn't HD. The source is HD, by the resultant file is 624x352, just under half 720p resolution."
,moderaator,2010-06-22T18:41Z,"Yes, yes , yeeeeeeeeeees!"
,namxad,2010-06-22T20:50Z,"Be careful.. HBO is sending out ""copyright infringement"" email letters 1-2 days after you download their shows. Anybody else get one?"
,alish911,2010-06-23T01:05Z,enough vampires already
