,NitLions,2010-06-22T08:17Z,"1st time in the history of my torrent lifetime that TVTeam has had a faster download on a popular show! And that was after I was dl'n this for 3 hours, Im now dling both at the same time and will get the tvteam torrent over 2 hours sooner than this one, not including the 3 hour head start!! Thats a 5 hour difference man, Im just pointing that out in case its something u need to fix cuz I dunno what I'd do without you. U r ALWAYS the first person I check when I come on here. G""luck and thanks again for everything, hope u get it fixed "
