Its my favorite format, funny thing is i dont own psp or zune or nothing yet, just bought my first amv viewer off ebay lol and gonna use it as a storage/transfer device instead lol. Its official, not fake, watched it this afternoon after doing the reworkz's to it, and yeah this is actually impressive in my book (not to toot my own whistle) for a cam, thanks again PrisM if you didnt put it up i wouldnt have anything to work with."
