 * For The Twin Snakes, Metal Gear Solid's gameplay was altered to resemble that of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. While all of the original areas and enemies were kept, new ways for the player to combat them were introduced, such as the ability to shoot using first person view. Enemy AI was also improved, giving enemy soldiers the ability to communicate with each other and detect the player more intelligently.
