[V],twentyforty,2010-06-21T16:44Z,"@Stevc: If you've adopted my advices, namely ""Accept unencrypted connections "" to ""no"" (left unmarked), hard-set number of conn. per torrent at 16, max. num. of uploads to 8 per  torrent, have running PeerBlock and you've blocked within firewall all leeching addresses and addresses of all Gremlins - it should be like that. Do not worry - good peers still can connect to you.

@nicermog: LOL. Especially when Desperate Housewives visit Eastwick drinking canned True Blood and writing Diaries every night when moon just has Eclipsed."
,jon4fun,2010-06-21T17:02Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

I'll give this one a go, although have heard nothing about it but then I'm in Ireland and it may never make it to TV here.

I am hoping that this show is a cut above 'The Vampire Diaries' or [nicemog] may just be right. From what I read on TV Rage the first thing that comes to minid is a TV remake of 'The Lost Boys' just set in suburbia instead of a seaside town. Hope they are darker shows than VD anyway.

Cheers
Jon

@ALL - PEOPLE 'initial seed rules' Come ON!!!!!! I am seeing 64 peers and only 20-40 as a seed. IF you can NOT seed above 50Kbps then [stop & delete] this torrent (I don't care how much you've sucked off already, no pun intended). You are dragging everyone down. Just wait a couple of hours until 4 fast seeders are up and running and then START DL from scratch. Your existence will not end.

Please, common sense.
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-21T17:07Z,"@zazbzc: Your intentions were good, but - in the future AVOID posting links to sites of TV production houses. First, they generally ""read"" and collect addresses from where visitor came from AND visitor's address. If they ""link"" these two - it may cause big problems.
Second, I already have posted link to tvrage - even if it is inferior one - provides certain anonymity because of the volume of visitors and the nature of tvrage dot com."
