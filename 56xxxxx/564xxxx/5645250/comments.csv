Check the screenshots provided (the 2nd one). I already posted it above :/"
,champofchampions,2010-06-23T11:36Z,I am definitely trying this one... I'll post back results!

,ManOfAdventure,2010-06-23T13:11Z,"Did exactly as he said. Well at first it didn't seem to work. Opened MS Access, asked to activate, then asked to update and then said ""Not Activated"". The I opened MS Word and it said ""Activated"". Closing Access and reopening it and bam: Activated. After rebooting everything was still nicely activated. So be ware it might show ""Not Activated"" with the first program you open. This is the RTM 14.0.4760.1000 (32-bit). He says to open and close too. Except with me it asked to activate before asking to update. Result is the same however. Try this on my second computer now..."
,Baz2017,2010-06-23T14:02Z,"Thanks ManOfAdventure for your feedback, ManOfAdventure. :) Nice to hear it worked for you as well. Let us know about how the 2nd go went, as well. Thanks.

,Baz2017,2010-06-23T17:09Z,"It'll stay activated, don't worry, Deacon!

You mentioned problem..what kinda problem though? And how did you go around it? May be you could share with the rest of us. :)"
,ManOfAdventure,2010-06-23T17:11Z,"Worked like a charm on the second computer as well. Everything is neatly activated also after rebooting. Installed on two windows 7 pc's, but that shouldn't make any difference normally. This is the one guys... Thx Baz2017"

,Baz2017,2010-06-23T18:56Z,"You are welcome, avatar8 :)


chess000master, so you insist it's a volume edition? I have already posted the screenshot of Check Activation by using WZOR Mini-KMS Activator 1.051. Have a look at this agian: http://bayimg.com/OANmJaAce. Or even better, download the activator again from here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5513979/Microsoft_Office_2010_Activator_[_kk_]
AND SEE for yourself if it says retail licence or not. Do it for yourself.

There are plenty of RETAIL issues all over the internet but YOU NEED A KEY TO INSTALL THEM! This release made by some generous person lets you install Office RTM version and it's activated with little or no effort at all. What is so bad about that? :S

Those people who downloaded and installed successfully, please SEED the torrent afterwards! Thanks. (Y)"
,Deacon5748780,2010-06-23T18:59Z,"Baz2017... The problem was really minor. The product key window kept popping up. I only entered the key manually. This seems to work.{only time will tell} However, even if it's only active for one week, it's free. I'm not complaining. I'm sure a permanate fix will be here soon. Love this download...U Da Man!!"
,Baz2017,2010-06-23T19:07Z,"Oh I see. Okay, thanks Deacon5748780. I don't know if you watched it, but I mentioned about the possibility of the need to use the product key after installing from the file 'config.xml'."
,Deacon5748780,2010-06-23T19:19Z,NO...THANK YOU. Sorry I missed that video or post. Still sorta new to this. You and yours are apprceiated. Thanks again.

but dude plz tell me as we saw the script and in batch file... we saw there is OEM thing... what was that ??? what do the batch and Config.xml file do... during installation ........ ?
anyone plz explain this "
,Baz2017,2010-06-24T09:37Z,"chess000master, good you finally changed your views about the torrent. But man, I said it all along try and follow the instructions I posted (to my best), and you'll be fine. 

m2thedeep, glad it worked for you as well. :) No there's no need of that, if people give good feedback and do seed this torrent I'll not be able to help but upload the x64 version when available. Just have to be little patient.

onlyeuro, can't say much myself sorry, but just know that something has been integrated with the retail DVD downloaded from technet and this makes it possible all this possible. 

It's little disappointing for me how few people seeded after downloading the file when, I think, this is the only retail version which is pre-activated. I wish it was more distributed to ppl! :|"
,Baz2017,2010-06-24T10:04Z,Seeding at the best speed I can :(
,Baz2017,2010-06-24T13:32Z,"Close all the Office programs (perhaps restart your computer) and then open an Office program and check again.
Otherwise, you can enter your key manually from the file 'config.xml' in the folder 'Office14del'. Watch the video mentioned in the instructions above. Any problems, post back. :)

dante_91, I tried the genuine test also and I got the same thing that it wasn't sure about my Office. Well, this is good enough for me (as long as it just marks my copy as pirated, I'm happy with it). As of the Updates, I don't think Microsoft has released any updates for Office 2010 yet.

,Baz2017,2010-06-26T20:57Z,"@ Lacky5

Shouldn't have started the Setup with the .exe file. You have to run the bat file, for it to work properly. Plus, I am not sure if this makes difference, but as mentioned in the instructions you have to make a folder SWSetup and THEN paste the folder OFF2010PRO.rar in there. And, then you run the setup by running Setup.bat file. 

You might want to retry by uninstalling this install completely and re-install again. (Uninstall using ccleaner or some application like revo uninstaller so that no left-over registry entries are left)"
,dhamzici,2010-06-26T21:48Z,"@Lacky5: You have to follow the instruction. Main folder on C named SWSetup, Subfolder OFF2010PRO. Otherwise it won't work. I made a similar mistake and installation from the .bat file didn't want to start until I fixed the mistake."

Very easy to install,  I didn't even need any activation keys on my Win XP to activate this Office 2010. Just followed the instruction of creating a folder named SWSetup on C drive, copied the extracted file OFF2010PRO.rar to that folder, ran setup.bat and it was all done.

Checked the Help section under File in any app such as Words, Excel, it all said product has been activated permanently once installed and I didn't need to input any keys.

@ blueeyechica:
STOP posting external links on my upload. IF you have a x64 version of Office 2010 then upload it on thepiratebay.org (and we'll support you. BUT don't try to advertise your forum. Okay!! 

chess000master, if that's how you did it - and it worked for you, that's very good. But I thought that way if you do it's longer. But if it was the only way which worked for you, by all means thanks for sharing. But I have tested it on multiple PCs with the (simple) instructions given above in the torrent description, and I had no issues.

The openbittorrent tracker is in my list. But the reason not many people are seeding / being shown seeding is due to some technical bug in upload process, which implies that openbittorrent tracker is removed from torrent - and many people who download and seed are not announcing to that tracker.

(if you or someone else want to read the exact words of someone who, unlike me, actually knew what he was talking about on this matter, see here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=67841&pid=496373#pid496373). I added this question on SuperBay forum. 

That aside, thanks to all the seeders who are contributing to this torrent. Partially it was a mistake on my part (i.e. added some dead trackers), and I'll be more careful in future.

x64 bit version of this upload (which means activated office for 64-bit system) is available now; and I think I'll upload it after few days when I'd have seeded the Longman Dictionary well."

Could you please add a screenshot of that, if possible? :O

Thanks for your quick reply. "
,Baz2017,2010-07-02T21:45Z,"@ aztec321

Thanks for posting the screenshot.

I'll try to find more keys for Office then. For now, please try these and see if any of these works for you:
6QFDX-PYH2G-PPYFD-C7RJM-BBKQ8
BDD3G-XM7FB-BD2HM-YK63V-VQFDK
MD6VB-X9MVK-K94YP-JXBPJ-C2HGK"
,aztec321,2010-07-02T21:52Z,"Thanks, but those do not work. They aren't even validated when I copy and paste them. "
,60002,2010-07-03T01:08Z,"Just like to say a big thumbs up to Baz2017 for uploading this - I have got this working now on one of my home computers. Unfortunately, I have encountered the same error as aztec321 when trying to apply the torrent to another PC. While the product key is still valid, the actual number of licenses used appears to have reached its limit :-(. 

Does anyone have a working Product Key that is not only corect, but also with licenses 'to spare', so to speak??

Also, I would reccomend anyone that would like a custom install should follow chessmaster's post on page 4 - if you follow the video then Office is installed as standard, however if you want additional featured to be added/removed, the auto install is not useful here."
,Baz2017,2010-07-03T02:36Z,"Activation was working at the time of upload. I have not tried installing now, but if the activation key is really reached its limit - I think there is not much point of this torrent. I'm waiting for a friend's response about this copy of Office, and if/when he confirms that this MAK is gone I'll delete this torrent. 
100+ users already downoaded (and used) this. :) Am glad about that. :)

NOW,
I have RTM versions of Office 2010 which use similar bat files and I tested those also. Plus, Not dependent on some MAK. I'll upload those if enough people express their interest in them."
,ghostk,2010-07-03T07:50Z,me too!
,SriKolla,2010-07-03T13:29Z,Yep. Pls upload the RTM
,SriKolla,2010-07-03T13:47Z,Pls upload RTM :)
,splurgegun,2010-07-04T20:19Z,"yes please Baz matey, i'd be interested in getting a copy of the 64-bit version too if you have it. cheers"
,Baz2017,2010-07-05T02:59Z,"Sorry guys, no success with finding something similar which works 100%! :(  I have tried what I had on a couple of more machines and on mine multiple times - the results is that the activation works occassinoally (not good enough). So I won't be uploading that. I'll update the description if I come across some MAK key in future.

If you downloaded this torrent and now are stuck with the retail 'unactivated' version of Office then you can convert it into volume edition,
use this kit: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5669822/Office_2010_Activation_and_Conversion_Kit_1.3_by_Razor

I have tested it and it works. Choice is yours."
,PeachTree,2010-07-05T03:54Z,What is the difference between the retail edition and volume edition?
,Baz2017,2010-07-05T04:27Z,"Both essentially are same thing, except that if you have activated retail version it's activated for life and you can use it without worrying about anything, but if you have volume edition you have to activate it every 6 months."
,PeachTree,2010-07-05T13:04Z,"I have an activated version.  If I uninstall and re-install (on the same computer), will it be activated?"
,Baz2017,2010-07-05T13:24Z,It's unlikely that it'll stay activated when you re-install because I think MS don't normally retain activation information when you uninstall it. 
,wu0di1,2010-07-06T10:57Z,"Thank you Baz2017 for sharing. I followed the instruction to install and at the final stage, the key could not be activated as it exceeded its limit.  Is there any resolution for now?"
,Baz2017,2010-07-06T13:16Z,"No, wu0di1."
,onlyeuro,2010-07-07T00:37Z,"you have to activate it again when u install it again...
activation occurs wheneever u install it no matter you r installing it on same PC or different PC.... hope i answer ur question....
if u already activated copy of office 2010 then try to backup tokens.dat and pkeyconfig.xrm-ms files.... these 2 files stores ur activation information... if you backup these files and re-install office 2010 on same computer... then u just have to put this files in right location in this way you can skip activation."
,wu0di1,2010-07-07T07:47Z,"Thank you onlyeuro for your help and thank you 
mazigh for raising this question which I'll like to ask onlyeuro too. BTW mazigh, ALL those MAK are INVALID to VALIDATE.  "
,ruchirrathore,2010-07-07T20:46Z,"@Baz2017
I've just finished installing it. It's working and showing activated. Many Thanks!!! Just to be on safer side, I've Mini KMS activator ready, in Office 2010 starts acting up.. :-)
But as of now, I am happy that I got what I wanted.
@FOR NON BELIEVERS OUT THERE:
Guys.. This is the thing, if you are looking for x86 RTM copy of Office 2010 Pro. Absolutely clean and no drama with this. Installed in 1st attempt even when I had office 2010 RTM Escrow installed. (I used Revo Uninstaller Pro, to uninst that copy, deleted all the registry keys which revo could throw up, and deleted all the remaining files and folders, then I unrared this and launched the setup, and had a cup of coffee while it run, by the time my coffee was finished I had working office 2010 RTM running on my PC.
checked the version, checked the activation status, (with KMS as well) all good..."
,Baz2017,2010-07-07T23:01Z,"Quite fankly, that's unbelievable, ruchirrathore! :) Anyways if it worked for you, many congrats! Enjoy your new Office 2010!! :)

If they're leaked please post them here so activation problems all of us are experiencing about the key limit thingy can be solve."
,pirate-love,2010-08-19T06:42Z,"To everyone that could not activate this because the product key exceeded its activation limit, there is good news. According to Volume Activation Management Tool 2.0, the MAK provided in this torrent has more than 10,000 remaining activations (as of today.) About a month ago, it had zero remaining activations. So the company that purchased the key recently added more activations."
,supanut2000,2010-08-19T10:20Z,"Really? Is it true?
Well...if someone can give me a proof then...I'll download this again...!
But does that stays permanent? Or that 10,000 remaining activations will some day change back to 0!
But...If it will soon change back to 0 then...I'll wait for pirated keys...the number of activations on pirated keys is unlimited since the key is non genuine..."
,pirate-love,2010-08-19T21:19Z,"supanut2000, 
Yes, the activation count will once again go down to 0, but what happens after that will depend on whether the company requests more activations or not. But ultimately, the MAK will run out of activations."
