This is the RTM version, pre-activated.  

I am not the original maker but I found it and I am just trying to pass it on to you folks. Unfortunately, for now, only 32-bit version is available. 

Completely uninstall any beta versions or any other office installations (using ccleaner or revo uninstaller - there shouldn't be any left-over registry values cos they surely will mess up with your new install). Here is a list of steps, try to follow along:

â€¢ Make a folder in your C drive as SWSetup
â€¢ Copy the extracted file OFF2010PRO.rar to that folder
â€¢ Run Setup.bat
â€¢ Open any one of the Office programs, say, open Excel - you will be asked to Accept  the agreement and about your Updates settings (yes, you can update it safely)
â€¢ Close Excel and re-open; the activation wizard wizard will appear - choose to activate onlineÂ (please note internet connection needed)
....and then you will have a fully activated copy of Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus.

I have tested it on two PCs and it's working with no issues whatsoever!


Scanned with: Kaspersky PURE
Before installation, scan the downloaded RAR file with your favourite anti-virus software.

Remember, it's very important that you completely uninstall any previous trials or beta versions installed on your machine first.


Please give feedback if it works for you. Plus, I'll try and find x64 version and will upload it as soon as I can.
