 Dude if you can't figure this out, why are you even here? Just drag and drop exe file in crack directory into avs directory and overwrite trial version. Jeezus.

,slats649,2010-08-20T09:58Z,"I know this can not be hard the instructions are so simple. Install program, copy the crack into the Application directory and it is suppose to work. Then How do I come up with ""This is a non-actived version""? What's wrong with this picture?
Thanks for the help in advance"
