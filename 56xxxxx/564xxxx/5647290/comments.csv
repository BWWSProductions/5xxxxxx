There are very good splitting/joining/converting utilties readily available here on TPB, such as the Ultra Video programs (splitter, joiner and converter, all of which work great). Please try to use these, or please send me a reason why its a better idea (in this case or generally) to upload files in such half-finished condition.

Best regards, and thanks for this and all your other fine uploads! Cheers!"
