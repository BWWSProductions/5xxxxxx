Sorry if Im abit late on this, but just got a hold of Ip man 1, and just had to see the second. But, after adding the subs in VLC, its still not working. Im only getting subs from the movie in chinese (I think it is). Some help would be appriciated.
Regards, Mikayo"

,MykZkyM,2010-09-03T10:44Z,Can anyone help me.  The sub is in Chinese too.
,somstar,2010-09-04T20:51Z,"Thanx a lot raymondhome for bringing such a fantastic movie with an amazing print.
Really appreciate it........
As few others too have faced the same problem that the subtitles included in this torrent are in chinese  hence it is a big problem for us who can't understand the language.....
I'm enclosing a link from where the english subs can be downloaded for this movie torrent....

http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3693118/ip-man-2-en

Please seed and Enjoy......."
,RedMatrix,2010-09-20T06:53Z,"@somstar  :  Thanks for that link. The subs look like they match the time code nicely. 

However, I notice that this is a different English translation than the other 2 sub files I have. This one seems more...dumbed down; more simple way of saying things.

For example::around the 7 min mark::

YOUR LINK'S SUB:
-Hello!
--You teach Wing Chun?
-Master! Someone wants to learn martial arts!
-You want to learn martial arts?
-Just checking out.
-I don't know what Wing Chun is.
-Let me give you an introduction.
--As a matter of fact, Wing Chun...
--is a close combat style from the South...
-No need to tell me all these.
--Let's fiight. I'll pay you school fees if I lose.
-OK.

OTHERS SUBS:
-Hey, are you the one teaching Wing Chun?
-Master Yip! Someone's here to learn kung fu!
-You wish to learn Wing Chun?
-I don't even know what Wing Chun is
-Then let me tell you. Wing Chun is the Southern art of close combat...
-Enough! Spar with me. If I lose, I'll be your student
-Fine

They are very similar, yet different. I guess there's more than one way to say stuff, working with the time codes of speech in the movie.  I'll just watch the movie with subs that match the time code and shut up now.

,starcream,2010-11-04T09:49Z,"thank you raymondhome for the proper cantonese audio! i can't stand dubbed languages, no matter what it is"
,DaKidAwMe,2011-02-13T05:03Z,"I like the way this isn't the whole movie, it stops right after the last fight and skips about 5 more minutes of movie..."
,JaronLoch,2011-02-16T19:53Z,"Hi,

how come i only get the chinese subs?? when i open it on media player classic and right click it, the ""subtitle"" option is disabled. why?? i tried to download another srt file but the its unsynch. please help? 

I've been downloading this torrent very slow that it took me 4 days to complete it. I don't want to redownload another torrent again. 

Thanks for your help.

,067875369,2011-03-01T00:15Z,"thx. For me, the subtitles r sync and is pretty close in meaning to the Cantonese audio. "
,067875369,2011-03-01T02:05Z,"Tho There' 1 part where the subtitle is totally wrong and doesn't make sense. 

at 1:43:00 it's suppose to say ""looks like you"" not ""he takes after you"""
,Demosthenes928,2011-05-12T15:41Z,"^

Those essentially mean the same thing in English."
,DVDman09,2011-06-09T03:08Z,"I've downloaded the other versions. This one is the best. 

video: 9/10
audio: 9/10

The sound track is the original cantonese, which sounds best.  The mandarin version (Ip.Man.2.2010.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON) is overdubbed by other actors who sound silly.

The subtitle (.srt file) is English, and it's the correct English translation. There are a few minor differences between the English subtitles and the spoken Chinese, but that's because the original Chinese subtitles have those differences. The English subtitles file that's included here is as good as any other one out there, so you don't need to download another file.

This video contains the entire movie. This video ends abruptly in the middle of the closing credits. So, only some of the closing credits are missing. 

Ignore the comments that the subtitles are not working. They are idiots. "
,vhg,2011-07-04T15:10Z,thanx for the movie..
