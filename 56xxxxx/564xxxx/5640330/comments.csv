,EiNST3iN,2011-10-14T23:05Z,"@djzulu, How the hell do you survive on here while you know do little about technology.

First off you need a DVD not a CD!

Second, you get what is called a DUAL-LAYER DISC which holds 8.5GB. 

You can't choose your GB size like its a f*cking hard drive. Are you really that retarded?"

,TheMobb,2012-04-19T11:03Z,Is this game safe on xbox live i scanned it with abgx360 and it said dmi is unvalid
,Pur3v1l,2012-05-04T01:22Z,"To Burn this, download imgburn, go to settings>write and set the layer break to 1913760. Then go to write image file to disk, insert your DL disk and browse for the .dvd file (Do not select the .iso file) set the write speed to x2.4 if you have it. x3 will work just fine but has a slightly lower success rate. Then hit write and wait for it to finish. Hope this helped."
,xxtranno0,2012-05-19T20:19Z,"scanned it with abgx360 and got ""DMI unverified"" and ""Verification Failed"". Scanned it the 2nd time and it looks like abgx360 patched everything up. ENJOY!!"
,nautica22,2012-05-24T17:22Z,there HAS to be a faster way of downloading this game... maybe its just me but im going on 2 days now
