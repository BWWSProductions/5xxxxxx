         Empires have risen and fallen on the tide of changing         
         storm patterns and the turbulent relationship between         
         atmosphere, landscape and oceans. We'll learn about the       
         impact of the Himalayas on new wind patterns, then jet over   
         to Australia's Red Center, where a giant swirl of wind has    
         relentlessly stripped the land of its fertility, forcing      
         its Aboriginal people to survive as hunter-gatherers while    
          civilizations elsewhere developed agriculture.
