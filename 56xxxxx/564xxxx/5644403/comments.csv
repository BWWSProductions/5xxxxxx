I'm gonna be seeding this for a while, hope people follow the example -.-"
,Aezur,2010-06-24T22:38Z,"OMG i just tested it again and the game doesn't recognize rar files only zip -.-

This means that after you copy the assetsfix.rar you have to unrar it for the game to work properly...only unrar assetsfix.rar

I'm going to upload a correct version with a zip file..."
,blargx,2010-06-24T22:43Z,"Wait.. what assets fix? I thought this was the retail?

Why not just upload the retail install.exe?"
,Toshiya,2010-06-27T02:38Z,"The game is just 24$, and you get a 30 days guarantee, It's made by a INDIE Developer, Come on, just buy the thing if you really like it and want the full thing...


Jeez I'm suprised to see this over here.

P.S. I have the full thing, and it's really worth the price if you enjoy Hack & Slashing, Looting, Levelling and Questing + Co-Op option."
,Rzarekta,2010-09-27T16:23Z,"oh please, gamers are constantly ripped off by both developers and publishers, we simply like to ""get even"" with them (for lack of a better term).

but I understand where you're coming from Toshiya. I personally like to donate money to small time indie developers like these guys if they've made a quality game. I'll give them about ~75% of what they were charging for the game and I like to think of it as creating my own personal discount. :P

Furthermore, this ensure's that the money is actually given to the developer and the usually greedy publisher. I've done it to Tale Worlds (w/ their game Mount & Blade) after Paradox became their publisher.

So you can see, not everyone on TPB lacks morals. ;)"
