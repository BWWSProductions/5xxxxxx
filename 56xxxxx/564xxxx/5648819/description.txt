NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Marmaduke v2

Right sources used first ,the russian cam around 20secs.....3mins of a video off a special friend and finally
the bulk of the film is from anton studios video ....oh and the audio is taken from our first cam release.
Many thanks to all
Now the anton studio video is one of the best cams we've seen for a while,but had a few small issues and just
over 3mins of video missing,hence the reason for using to other sources so we can bring to you a FULL version ;-)
Work done....well firstly we had to check the anton video to see where the footage was missing and most was at the very begining
but there was two other spots .....one 3/4 into the video and one near the very end.
Once we found them all we had to cut them out of the other release and then resize to match the res of our main encode.....so AR might be
slightly off in parts,but not by much at all.
The main bulk of the video just needed a few tweaks here and there...mainly a change in the rgb colours,contrast,brightness and chroma.
Also there was some camera movement so we had to crop differently throughout the film and then resize them all to match.
Then onto the audio......well that was just off one video which had the full movie so it was a case of stripping it,filtering it and then syncing....
Think we did a pretty decent job on the sync,considering it ain't easy syncing to talking dogs so

Anyway the rating of this film is crap ...lowest we've seen :lol: but i'm sure the kids will love it so .......enjoy
