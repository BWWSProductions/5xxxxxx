The Grassroot Deviation is an Edmonton-based four-piece musical group that plays a diverse spectrum of roots, rock and funk. The Edmonton Journal describes the Grassroots Deviation as â€œdirect and rawâ€ and â€œmore party-driven than most of their folk counterpartsâ€. Their sound is vibrant explosive and energizing which couples nicely with expressive lyrics and smooth rhythm.
