[V],catflap,2010-06-27T16:31Z,you need old-style red/blue 3D glasses for this one.
,tracyhawk,2010-06-27T17:19Z,"Thanks for the answers. Now that i know i need regulars 3D glasses, can i watch it with my regular pc monitor? Thanks"
,Miki2,2010-06-27T22:49Z,"Some kind of 2d-3d conversion. Maybe just as simple as timeshifting left eye 1 frame from right eye. Awful 3d in other words.  :(
And yes: Red/cyan glasses are needed but the 2d-version looks ten times better than this. Why did someone even bother?
Crossposting just for knowledge."
