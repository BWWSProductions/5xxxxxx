	NOTES:
	
	The release by CHGRP is ivtc'd but it shouldn't be, 
	resulting in missing frames and jerky playback. Their 
	sample included in the Sample-dir as proof. 
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
