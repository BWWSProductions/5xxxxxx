,glasswings21,2010-06-23T00:10Z,is this also jailbroken  ? wht does it mean by no custom logos or no updates to baseband....you mean its a different OS then a non hacktivated one...as i also see its a bit smaller in size compared to the non hacktivated version....please explain im confused here i so wanna update my phone to OS4.
,EpicAaron,2010-06-23T01:23Z,"@glasswings21 This file is jailbroken, and is activated automatically, for carries that arnt official such as T-Mobile in the US, if you have AT&T you would use the non-hactivated version."
,Ravngard,2010-06-23T03:18Z,"So if I have a 3G iphone version 3.1 that was jailbroken with blackra1n, I just restore this with itunes and that's it?"
,EpicAaron,2010-06-23T04:14Z,"@Ravngard: Yes that is correct, the only jailbreak that wont allow you to use this is Spirit."
,glasswings21,2010-06-24T14:28Z,Thanks aaron will download and install......it now....:)!!!!!!!!!!!
,glasswings21,2010-06-24T14:36Z,"oh yeah and one last thing would it also include blackrain ,cydia or something like all the other previous OS's that we had for iphone? ? ?"
,Pro_Pirate_,2010-06-28T05:56Z,"ok, 1) this works great !! but u must have itunes 9.2+ for it to work. I ahd 9.1 and it put my phone in a restore loop, but I had to download 9.2, loaded firmware, was all good.

2) seems good until 'no service' problem. well I saw ultrasn0w already installed and was confused. You have to go further (cydia-->Managa-->Sources-->ultrasn0w--->click intall on topr right. let it install then reboot and voila!!

You now have a iphone 3g ios4 jailbroken + unlocked...good luck"
