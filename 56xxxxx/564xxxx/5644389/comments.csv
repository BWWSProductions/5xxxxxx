I'm gonna replace all my AT files with this guy's rips."
,Blazephlozard,2010-06-30T07:04Z,"Oh man, thank you so much for coming back and uploading the new eps!
Your torrents are seriously THE best quality I have ever seen. I'd say that since it's without commercials or logos, it's even better than on the television."
,dr.claw,2010-07-02T11:33Z,"Any idea when the new ep will be up, Chouonsoku?"
,Chouonsoku,2010-07-12T03:02Z,"When Wedding Bells Thaw aired June 28th, Dungeon Masters is airing tomorrow. So I should get it Tuesday or Wednesday."
,Buzzhead,2010-07-13T14:17Z,"These are awesome. Thanks for uploading. Out of curiosity, what are you using to convert from the source to mkv?"
,Chouonsoku,2010-07-14T07:20Z,Freeware software Requiem is used to decrypt the m4v to mp4. I then use mkvtoolnix to remux the video to MKV and remove any metadata.
,resrevni,2010-07-17T07:17Z,@ChouonsokunnThanks for taking the time to upload these! Waiting anxiously for the next EPs.
