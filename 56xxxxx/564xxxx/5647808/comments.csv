The film it self is very good. Just bad quality and no sound. In my opinion, you may like the quality. So don't go on my opinion.

Wish someone would get a ""dvd rip"" on this one. With sound!"
,riggorick51984,2011-05-13T16:03Z,"Don't listen to previous comment.  The film itself is terrible.  The video is ok, it's a VHS rip, so you can't complain.  And there is audio.  It's only in the right speaker, but it is there."

But i know its old and VHS so you cant complain much about the quality."
,Bauirjan,2011-08-01T09:25Z,"Hi, raymondhome. Dude, can you tell me what program you use for ""squeezing"" the size of videos and at the same time sustaining the quality? And where can I download it? Thanks, man. Appreciate."
