,ckersnikkers,2010-08-19T23:30Z,"got the same problem as fede184: both 32-bit and 64-bit version of Photoshop CS5 crashes when using Beauty Box. (Got both versions of plugin installed, 32- and 64-bit).
Photoshop CS4 doesn't see the plugin?
(crashes now too btw...)

Perhaps it's a specific problem for some systems only? (I do have an nVidia gpu.) Maybe I've got some f-ed up photoshop install... Thanks for the upload tough! :)"
