Agatha Christie 450 from Paddington 1.0.7

Thereâ€™s a new detective in town for I-playâ€™s next Agatha Christie hidden object game, and it ainâ€™t Hercule Poirot. Agatha Christie: 4:50 from Paddington, which will launch later this month, marks the debut of Miss Marple â€“ an elderly spinster with a knack for solving crimes.

While travelling through the English countryside, Miss Marpleâ€™s old friend Elspeth McGillicuddy witnesses a frightful even through the window of a passing train. Thankfully for Elspeth, Miss Marple is an expert sleuth. With little evidence to go on, Miss Marple must get to the bottom of the murder.
