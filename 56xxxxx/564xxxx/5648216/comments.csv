,famemon78,2010-07-12T14:26Z,Dude are u ever planning on coming back and finishing this upload? we r all stuck at 74.6% ! i really think we should stop handing out green or pink skulls before an uploader has shown he/she is truly serious about sharing .. more than half the newbies just run off half way once they ve got their colored skull!
