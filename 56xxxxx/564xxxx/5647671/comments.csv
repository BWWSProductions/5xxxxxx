,cncmasterw,2010-06-26T00:46Z,For those with windows 7 Problems I have been having the same problem.. I think microsoft is getting sneaky with how we download.. Because I have to Double check my torrent a few time. So Take out the torrent in the program and let it rescan to make sure it has everything downloaded and It will download the rest.
,nsakhare,2010-06-26T05:52Z,can anyone upload setup.exe of this iso i am getting error wen i click on the setup plzzzzz help
,[TR],2010-06-26T14:37Z,"I'm also getting that error on XP.
On Transformers and on Singularity.
The sfv checked out OK, so I don't think it's a bad download.
Still trying to find out what this is all about..."
,alban72,2010-06-26T22:03Z,Doesnt start at all in win home premium 64bit:(
,razi-o,2010-06-27T07:58Z,"guys, i'm using windows 7 home premium 64-bit and the game works just fine..there's absolutely no problem with it..

at first, i was also unable to start the game at all after i've finished installing and cracked it..

it won't start if you just single/double click on the icon..you have to run it as administrator..

1. right click on the icon
2. run as administrator

the game should run properly after that..

goodluck.."
,razi-o,2010-06-27T16:19Z,"mutad1, 

if that's the case, maybe you should try and download from this link :
http://1337x.org/torrent/82265/0/

just now i've finish downloading the game from there..and the game works just fine with no errors..

you just have to follow the step as i gave before..run it as administrator otherwise the game won't start at all.."
,dashn1,2010-06-29T02:42Z,I've just downloaded and installed.It ran just fine and the game is fantastic.Only one problem.The in-game sound is reaaly low.

,Sunny6666,2010-07-07T11:35Z,Has any1 got the cd key for Singularity reloaded.. Plz mail me the cd key at sunnygrao6666@gmail.com
,babastini123,2010-07-14T05:31Z,"So... Incridible slow dl speed, keylogger, hard time installing it, and it has no sound....... Don\'t bother."
,victor7103,2010-07-17T01:07Z,I found the solution to the sound problem. You have to configure your sound card to stereo mode. In the task bar open your sound administrator and look for the number of active speakers. I my case I had 4CH (quadraphonic) and I downgraded to 2CH (stereophonic) and the problem was solved. In fact I have only two speakers. Apart form that the game works great!!

,Ralph_rafael,2010-07-30T08:13Z,Maybe its because you didn't copy and paste the crack yet.
,Ralph_rafael,2010-07-30T08:14Z,Maybe it is because you didn't copy and paste the crack yet.

And thank you for this torrent MUCH LOVE!"

,shipwreck1972,2011-10-13T07:54Z,Great game! But i'm stuck in a level with an half open garage door. You have to climb up there by using a metal box wich you can move. I guess this is a bug? Because I really can't find a way out.
,Neverb0rn,2011-11-30T09:33Z,"Great DL. Thanks so much. torrent works fine on xp sp3. just unrar one of the many rars (like you do for a movie with several rars) and the .iso will be in the folder. mount the iso with daemon tools. install, then copy over crack. worked perfectly. awesome game too. oh and there is no glitch at the garage door blocking you level..you have to age the box so its flat then push it under the garage door and then unage it to make it force the door open. though im sure youve figured that out by now. anyways, cheers!"
