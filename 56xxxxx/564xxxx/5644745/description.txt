Artist info:


Hailed in 1997 as the new Prodigy -- mostly by their record label -- Cirrus was born in Los Angeles as the project of Aaron Carter and Stephen James Barry. The duo program acid and trance breakbeats for their material, but also added live guitar and bass to appeal to rock crowds at their frantic live shows. After the release of the hotly tipped single "Superstar DJ," Cirrus signed to Moonshine and released Drop the Break in April 1997. Back on a Mission followed one year later.
