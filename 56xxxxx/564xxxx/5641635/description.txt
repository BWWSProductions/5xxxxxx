        |   "Virtual Acorn allows you to run the Acorn operating system        |
        |   RISC OS on a Windows PC with Windows 2000, XP, Vista or            |
        |   Windows 7, and on a fast G4, G5 or Intel Mac with                  |
        |   Mac OS X 10.4 or later. Any RISC OS programs can then be           |
        |   run on the PC. VirtualAcorn can operate inside a window,           |
        |   just like any other Windows application, but can also run          |
        |   full screen. In full screen mode the PC looks and feels            |
        |   just like an Acorn computer. VirtualAcorn requires no              |
        |   extra hardware to be fitted in your PC and can be                  |
        |   installed in minutes."                                             |

        |   A comprehensive emulator of the Acorn RiscPC platform, including   |
        |   RISC OS 4.02 software with networking capability. The SA version   |
        |   is much more powerful than the SE version (released previously),   |
        |   as it includes more VCPU support as well as a higher-speed screen  |
        |   redraw, HostFS2, Windows clipboard support, and more.              |

        |   VirtualRPC-SA for Windows is a fully-activated version which also  |
        |   emulates StrongARM-based architecture.                             |
        |                                                                      |
