These are additions to an earlier torrent I posted, containing material for Arcanis: The World of Shattered Empires, a campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons, 3rd ed. Arcanis as a campaign setting is as much influenced by the Roman Empire, as the traditional D&D influences. It has a number of original races and classes, as well as putting a distinctive spin on a number of the familiar ones.
