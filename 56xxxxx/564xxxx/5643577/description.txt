A documentary that offers a woman's perspective of life on the modern streets, Gangstresses features interviews with a number of success stories, in which they tell harrowing tales of their lean years. Variously hustlers, dealers, rap stars, daughters, and mothers, these women have known both hardship and success, and their perspective on their roots is both enlightening and sobering.

In addition to a wide assortment of "regular people", Champagne, Ice-T, Lil' Kim, Mary J. Blige, Tupac Shakur, Vanessa Del Rio and plenty more make appearances. They do not lead the plot (if there is one), they just have opinions.. like everybody else in this movie.

To put it bluntly, this is not rapsploitation. It's life.
