It is really beautiful !!!! Live in concert, orchestrated, and with a mostly instrumental cadenza at the end, Wow !!!!

A real gem.

Thus, I wanted to know if you could provide me with any further info. 

a) What is the original source, concert venue or commercial release this adhan comes from? In the later case, do you have a front cover of it? Give any detail you might have, please.

Who's the muezzin, and who are the rest of the artist's crew?

Anything to properly insert your piece in my soon-to-be uploaded >1000 adhan torrent project.

Please, write me to my e-mail (even if you could not help me with the info), which is exactly:

""my nick, add, gmail, dot, com""

Thank you in advance for this amazing surprise, coming from here, I feel very lucky.

Much obliged, and my best regards."
