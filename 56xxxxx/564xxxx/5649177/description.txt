Norman Bergrun's "The Ringmakers of Saturn" is the inspiration for this video on the mysterious rings of Saturn. The big 3 amigo's on ATS (mikesingh, zorgon, and internos) have each added enormous effort of personal research on this subject, by gathering up to date Cassini satellite imagery that is showing some very interesting anomalies on and around the ringed planet.

Things have changed at ATS - so I have found myself reading over the last few years of some awesome threads to say the least.

This video is a tribute to some former ATS gurus that have contributed more than any other in such fields of interest as these...
