,greytscott,2011-01-16T20:25Z,"Is it possible to seed this video?  I've been at 97.3% for a couple of weeks, as well as several others.  Thanks!"
,greytscott,2011-01-21T03:18Z,"I scraped in two more MB download, now the group of us are sitting frozen at 97.6%.  It seems when someone with the whole file appeared it took several hours to download one MB."
,greytscott,2011-01-29T08:06Z,Six more MB downloaded last week.  The group of us are sitting frozen at 98.3% with 14MB remaining.  I don't know why when a seeder shows up it downloads at a crawl.
,greytscott,2011-02-11T15:42Z,Still stuck at 98.3% with 14 MB to go.  I will long-term seed this if I ever complete d/l.
[T],bitstreeem,2011-02-14T00:49Z,"I am jumpstarting this now.  Please seed...also, if you need seeding of any idle file, comment on the uploaders most recent file.  I don't scan all of my 100's of files often..I do see comments on recent files though.

Enjoy!"
