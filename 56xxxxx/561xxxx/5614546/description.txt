Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers will be releasing a new effort, "Mojo," via Reprise Records some time this spring. It marks the group's first studio set since 2002's "The Last DJ," though Petty released his third solo effort "Highway Companion" in 2006. 
Along with the album release, The Heartbreakers -- Petty, Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench, Ron Blair, Scott Thurston, Steve Ferrone -- are going on tour, naturally. Tapping My Morning Jacket, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Joe Cocker, ZZ Top and Drive-By Truckers as openers, the veteran rock group will step out on May 6 in Raleigh, N.C. and goes until at least Aug. 27 in North America.
