,impulseman37,2010-06-10T01:24Z,"This just goes to show that the Mac guys aren't as smart as they may seem. The Sims 3 is not a true Mac OS X  native game. It goes through a trans-code engine hence at the heart of the game lies the Windoze version. So yes going deep into the Sims 3 app contents you will find all sorts of .exe and .dll files, They are just really nicely hidden from the basic Mac user. So any hacked Windoze Sims 3 .exe files should work just find if you did deep enough to replace them. Do a little research next time before dropping the whole the are no .exe files in OS X, because there are quiter a few games that are ports of the Windoze versions and they too have .exe files in them."

instead of mocking, you should have said HOW the hell those ''oh so stupid Mac guyz'', could get this torrent to work, hum? o_O

Yap! :) You guys were correct. But there's a certain file (TS3.exe) in this Application, which is located in the Bin of the folder. You will replace that with the file TS3.exe :) Yes, its true that if you open the TS3.exe, codes will appear. But it is part of the application. So you will replace that :)"
