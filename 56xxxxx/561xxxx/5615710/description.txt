Instructions:

1. Download torrent.

2. Open the torrent in where ever it's saved.

3. Unzip the folder completely, there should only be an .app file.

4. Right click and click open.

5. Do NOT update it, if it exits when you say cancel, turn of your internet or get Little Snitch from the link below.

6. If it is still not working, copy the TS3.exe from the torrent and paste and replace in the following folder by right clicking and pressing show package contents.

Contents - Resources - transgaming - c_drive - Program Files - Electronic Arts - The Sims 3 - Game - Bin.
