,VampireMuffinMan,2012-03-25T13:15Z,"Hmmm...
Well so far I've only watched the first episode from this torrent and it's not a DVD rip, it's from TV.  Also, at around 37:11 [and through to the end], it changes from widescreen to having black bars on the sides.  Very strange...
Other than that, the episode is very good quality.  Hope the rest don't suffer from these issues."
,VampireMuffinMan,2012-03-25T22:56Z,"2nd Ep is also TV rip and at about 33:22 gets black bars on the sides...  3rd through 9th Ep are also TV rip, but doesn't suffer from the black bars...
I don't normally assume things, but the 2nd season appears to be TV rip as well, so I'm going to assume that the whole torrent is TV rips.
Anyone know where I can get a high quality DVD rip?"
