"We started out in a dimly lit, cinder-block basement, covering Blink 182 songs on the weekends and pissing off every neighbor in a one mile radius. Playing shows here and there around Lemoyne, Pa quickly became the next best thing to hitting the lottery. Meeting people and having our music find it's way to your ears and heart is all we can really ask for. Behind every song is us striving to get stuck in your head with catchy tunes and meaningful lyrics. What we truly want is to play shows and make music that means something to people. Forget the money and recognition if it means selling our souls and not being able to do what we love. We'd rather play shows in your aunt's backyard every 4th of July and never see a dime than create something that were not totally behind. Don't get me wrong, though. If the opportunity arrives one day, knocking on our door wanting to take us across the country, we'd do it in a heartbeat. 2010 would be rightfully called the wake-up year for Going Gone. For the first time we're serious about what we're doing and set on making things happen. 

Going Gone is made up of four studs that would love to be your friend 
Nate (Vocals/making lead guitar sound good)
Ian (Lead guitar and lookinâ€™ fly)
Brandon (Droppinâ€™ bass lines and ladies)
Jared (Hitting drums and having great hair)"
