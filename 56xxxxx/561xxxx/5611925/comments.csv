SEAON 5 has NOT aired yet.... the Squidbillies airing NOW are the remaining season 4 episodes. Season 5 will begin airing sometime in November of 2010. goto ADULT SWIM.com and check it out for yourself. DON""T get me wrong. I so GLAD the rest of season 4 episodes are being uploaded. I had scene them air, like the episode with WIDESPREAD PANIC as ""musical guest"", but only TODAY have I found these 11th and 12th, 13th, and 14th episodes for season 4 finally get posted somewhere. MANY THANKS!!!"
