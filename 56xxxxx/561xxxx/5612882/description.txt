Elvis singing "do you gaze at your bold head and wish you had hair" making himself laughing out loud while the band plays on.

I know: itÂ´s not nice to make fun of the King but the laughter is so much from the heart that I canÂ´t help laughing everytime I hear it.

sorry Elvis fans, no offence meant.

released in 1980
