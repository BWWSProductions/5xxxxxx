This is a wrapper to one of my favourite adventure game, The Last Express. In order to play it, you must follow these steps:

* get yourself a copy of the game (e.g. from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3514608/The_Last_Express_Win_Mac)
* download this very torrent
* unzip TLE.zip file
* right click on the unzipped TLE.app package
* show package contents
* navigate to Contents/Resources/tle
* copy CD1.HPF and DATA directory from the first CD, CD2.HPF from the second CD and CD3.HPF from the third CD to this (tle) directory
* enjoy the game

The know issue is that colours in full screen mode are broken but if you're a walkthrough junkie, you'll play in windowed mode anyway;)
