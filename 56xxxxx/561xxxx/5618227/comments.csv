[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-10T06:46Z,Please let me know if you want new releases uploaded as DVD9's so you can choose or DVD-5's. You will see more new releases from me. I will be uploading The Wolfman and Alice in Wonderland next. I will still continue to take all requests and continue with my classics. Enjoy.

,maxicastro,2010-06-10T23:48Z,"Hi and thanks a lot for this movie!

I would like to request any version of Der Rote Baron (The Red Baron) on DVD with at least Spanish subs (it would be great if it had Spanish audio too). It's a 2008 German movie I can't find anywhere on DVD with Spanish audio/subs. There are 2 DVD torrents here with Dutch subtitles, but I don't speak Dutch. I hope you can find anything, be it DVD9 or DVD5. Anything, at least English, but DVD. Thanks in advance :)"
