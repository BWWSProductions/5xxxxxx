,topherisher,2010-06-08T02:56Z,Is this the PS1 game? I never play this game before but the only closest Pokemon like game I played in the old playstation is Jade Cocoon.
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-08T05:33Z,"Yes, this is the ps1 version. It's already converted to PSP format. If you haven't, you should download it and try it out. Its a really good game. :)"
,FernFrond,2010-06-14T12:38Z,Thanks. Is it anything like Dragon Warrior Monsters? Monster breeding and such?
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-15T06:57Z,"Sort of, you can find eggs and hatch them then raise the monster but no interbreeding to make new monsters or anything. You can also upgrade the town like: adding a bowling alley (mini game) or a casino or library etc. you can also romance people in the game if you like."
,FernFrond,2010-06-21T01:31Z,Cool man. Thanks alot. Also All the games I torrented can no longer be seeded since i moved them all to a new folder For psp games. Is there a way that I can seed them from the new folder?
,FernFrond,2010-06-21T01:44Z,I am using Utorrent and I don't want to re-download it by changing the download location by right clicking it just to seed it. It kills the bandwidth but I want to seed because I know how annoying it is when people don't seed.
,FernFrond,2010-06-21T03:37Z,Ok delete the questions. I found out how to get it to seed now. I just need to right click and set download location. Select to view all files and just click on it and done.
,P-roy,2011-03-11T23:45Z,seeds anyone ?
,Rumudiez,2011-07-24T00:25Z,seeeeeeeeeeds man
