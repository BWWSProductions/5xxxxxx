An experimental play for radio, by Andrew Sachs, which attempts to tell a story with sound alone. 

A thriller with no speech.

Written and interpreted by Andrew Sachs, The Revenge was the world's first radio drama without words.

Andrew Sach's pioneering thriller featuring sound effects and 11 actors, but no written dialogue. From June 1978.

In 1978, after BBC Radio 4 broadcast The Revenge, a ground-breaking 30-minute play totally without dialogue (an experiment in binaural stereo recording), 'written' and performed by Sachs, playwright Jonathan Raban dismissed the work as a 'wordless sequence of noises' and 'a well-puffed curiosity'.
