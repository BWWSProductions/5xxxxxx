Alien Quadrilogy Boxset Feature DVD's, bonus material not included.
.iso images, I recommend Imgburn for burning these titles-it's free, and it works.

NTSC, DVD9, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, DTS Digital Surround.

Couldn't find these anywhere when I needed them, now you'll have better luck.
Comments, please!
