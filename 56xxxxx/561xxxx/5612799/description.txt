More or less 3 years after the debut-cd ï¿½Beyond the soulï¿½, Amï¿½Ganeshaï¿½n strikes back with the impressive ï¿½Somniaï¿½-opus. This project, which initially has been set up by a member of Rajna (cf. Gï¿½rard Chambellant) remains very close to the mystic ambiances of this other great French combo. ï¿½Somniaï¿½ for sure reinforce the link with Rajna and I even dare to say that after the newest Rajna-album (cf. ï¿½Hidden templeï¿½), both bands can be simply confused with each other. Just like for the Rajna writing process, Amï¿½Ganeshaï¿½s uses an impressive number of traditional instruments while female chants reinforced the tribal moods by enigmatic chants and lamentations. The main difference with Rajna, is that they here also inject male chants and still covers other cultural influences like Gregorian inspiration. Thereï¿½s a symbiosis between female and male vocals, which brings some diversity in the Eastern soundscapes. The only regret is that several songs are too short and that was already an aspect that I noticed on the debut album. The use of multiple and typical Eastern instruments reinforce the esoteric feeling and the unique sound of the project. Just like Rajna, they remind to the splendor of Dead Can Dance, but are definitely more authentic. The tracklist contains different great pieces like ï¿½Lumen mentisï¿½, ï¿½Procellaï¿½, the definitely Rajna sounding ï¿½Canticumï¿½, ï¿½Mesmerized mirrorï¿½, ï¿½Chimeraï¿½ that contains an impressive vocal performance and ï¿½Epitaphï¿½. Another attention grabber is for sure ï¿½Gloria in excelsisï¿½, which features a kind of merging between Gregorian chants and Eastern atmospheres. This is a very compact and coherent release, opening the gates of cultural fascination and sacred rites. This is a heavenly experience you canï¿½t miss!
