,pekerhed,2010-06-11T03:46Z,"I love MMA.....but the editing in this ""Best Of"" torrent was HORRIBLY ANNOYING!!!   You'll totally agree with me after the first five minutes of watching this.

They split the scenes with a quick 3-second break that includes a flying graphic and generic D'nB audio sample.....even when they cut to an interview, or a cage announcement, the clips are cut short, usually during mid-speech and in comes the same exact 3-second BREAK over and over again.   Seriously....I can't be the only one who was annoyed.  I really wanted to watch this....but those ""breaks"" really ruined it for me!"
