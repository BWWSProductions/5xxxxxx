AMG Review          by Stephen Thomas Erlewine

Polygram Special Markets' Takin' Care of Business is a ten-track budget-line collection that focuses on the hard-workin', "blue collar" side of BTO. That means there's no "You Ain't Seen Nothin'," but lots of driving, straight-ahead rock & roll with a real macho subtext to the lyrics -- "Welcome Home," "Sledgehammer," "Thank You for the Feelin'," "Four Wheel Drive," "Wild Spirit," "Take It Like a Man," "Not Fragile." In other words, it's for casual fans who don't really care about having all the hits; they just want genuine, manly hard rock.
