[V],poppedtart,2010-06-11T07:06Z,i wonder if this grit they put on some movies is on purpose or if they are using low quality cams?
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-11T18:36Z,it looks really real then...
,moshster,2010-06-14T16:13Z,"FYI, height is not exactly divisible by 8, PS3 Media Server and others have some trouble streaming this version to PS3."

[V],DibyaTPB,2010-06-16T09:07Z,thnx!
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-16T19:38Z,"not sure about the mod8 stuff, but you can simply copy the movie to your ps3 hard drive over the lan and it will be perfect."
,moshster,2010-06-16T22:27Z,"@poppedtart - I checked and compared other attributes with my other files (reference frames, profile level, etc) and the height mod8 was the only thing I could spot.  Am downloading the Secret Myth Kingdom release to compare as that one uses height of 528px."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-17T04:55Z,"that wont really prove much, everything is different in the encode.  just sync it to your ps3, it will be fine."
,moshster,2010-06-18T02:03Z,"The Secret Myth Kingdom release that is mod8 streams without any issues.  

I hear what you're saying; however, I want to stream rather than have to copy movies to the PS3 and also the PS3 is not my only client, I also have other DLNA clients.  

Anyway, it's not a big deal as I know have a version that streams.  Not seen this issues before, all other PT releases have been fine.  I can't be bothered to check if they were all mod8 :)"
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-18T02:27Z,they weren't.  I don't bother with that.  Whatever the AR calculates to based on the 1080p release is what it comes out to.
