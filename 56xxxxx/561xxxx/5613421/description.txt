Cry Of Love was an American rock  band formed in 1991 in Raleigh, North Carolina. The group released their debut album in 1993 (Brother), produced by John Custer before playing the Monsters of Rock festival the following year. They scored a number-one hit  on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart  with "Peace Pipe" in 1993. After this show, their frontman,Kelly Holland left the group.

Robert Mason was recruited as Holland's replacement some three years later. Together they recorded a new album in 1997 (Diamonds & Debris), but the band split shortly afterwards.

Former band member Audley Freed was recruited to the Black Crowes in 1998, and he played with the band until October of 2001. He also played on Crowes' lead singer Chris Robinson's second solo album in 2004, and on the subsequent tour.
