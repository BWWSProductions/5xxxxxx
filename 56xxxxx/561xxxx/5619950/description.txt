This CD was given to me by the drummer of the band We're Wolves today in the mall, he was a really cool guy and asked if we could give him a couple dollars for some gas money for their tour, me and my friend did and in turn, he gave us each a burned CD, this is a rip of the CD. Check them out here:

They are a screamo band, they're 320kbps files. They're independent and rely on their tour for money. See if they're coming to a place near you and check them out.
