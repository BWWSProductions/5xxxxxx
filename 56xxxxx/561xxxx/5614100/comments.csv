,ometiklon,2010-06-09T09:21Z,"There do seem to be some sync issues.  It didn't really freeze on me like it did for jclark81, but I did notice some occasional, slight video stuttering and after about the 16 minute mark (actually happened between about 16:00 and 16:30) there was noticeable stuttering and things went out of sync.
I had to re-watch a couple times to be sure of what I was experiencing, but I think the sync problem is actually with the audio, not the subs like jclark81 said.  The subs kept pace with the video (lines of dialogue were displayed when the appropriate character's mouth was moving).  It just seemed like it was all off because the audio didn't match the video or the subs.  The audio seems to be about 8-10  seconds off, based on the fact there there is no audio for the last 8-10 seconds of the video.

Definitely not the level of quality that Dattebayo always provided.  Hopefully this was a one time issue for the folks over at Crunchyroll, since they're taking over Bleach subs..."
