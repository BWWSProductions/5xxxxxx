[color=pink]Notes::::::::::::::::::[/color]
well, here we go with the hot tub CAMRip from russians,its a pretty nice cam except some video noise on every 3/4 frames, 
ive added a video denoise, but does not get rid 100% but to be honest, its not that much of a problem, color was quite high
lowered the coloring down, lowered the saturation, and slightly changed the hue balance, changed the background color slightly
and added slight sharpness...overall its a pretty nice TS...streamed to xbox, all in sync from what ive seen :D, did not want
to make it over a 1gb because runtime is only 1hr 31 and it has a nice bitrate anyway. Enjoy //prism
