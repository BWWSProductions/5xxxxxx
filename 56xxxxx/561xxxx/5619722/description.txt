Ambitious young New Yorker Beth wants it all: a good job, good friends and a good guy to share the city with. Of course that last one is trickiest of all, as Beth discovers when she falls hard for Tommy, a handsome, young Wall Street hotshot.

Just as everything seems to be falling into place, Beth meets Tommy's shy, clumsy co-worker Daniel â€“ and soon learns that the game of love in the big city is a lot like Wall Street â€“ high risk, high reward, and everybody has an angle...
