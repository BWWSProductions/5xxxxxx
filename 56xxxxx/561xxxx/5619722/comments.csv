[V],Kuthumi,2010-06-12T07:11Z,"Thank you, excellent rip! Subs are English and Spanish. If you want them to work, first unrar twice, then rename the two small files to have exactly the same name as the avi file, but with idx and sub extensions. Use copy and paste on the filenames to avoid typing errors.
Click my blue username above for more examples of how to use optional multisubs."
