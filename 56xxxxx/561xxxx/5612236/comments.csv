Anyways, despite the issues with the game (directx dll file issues and horrendous glitches regarding automatic camera rotation), what has been delivered here is a great service.  This is what the internet is for.  We should not tolerate digital bigotry from any source, be it any country on this planet.  Thank you for sharing this.  "

""This application has failed to start because d3dx9_42.dll was not found.Re-installing the app may fix this problem""

Is it because i'm on my netbook? any help?"
,Green_Banana,2010-06-12T21:57Z,"It's because you need to install the latest version of DirectX.  But it doesn't matter, because the game is unplayable due to inexplicable camera rotation.  Oh well.  "
