	NOTES:
	
	S01 had 8 episodes just like S02, however the last two 
	are not listed on mtv.com or in any tv-index. They aired
	as E07 and E08 on MTV Europe at least so that's where we
	found the episode numbers. There are also two subbed 
	releases out there named the same way. Here they are
	without subs for the fans and archives. 
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
