,wira020,2010-06-19T19:38Z,"Mr RiddlerA sir, I just signed a new account just to say thanks to you... I've been a fan of your small 720p mkv rips... very2 good quality... i wish i can rip like you also, but then I wouldnt be able to upload much since my ISP have data usage limit.. I'm very sorry if i cant seed much..

In my country, most of the mobile broadband only let us use 5GB upload/download per month.. it isnt so fast to begin with... so having uploaders like you made my life easier... since i cannot do much help seeding, i am now trying to get involve in translating subs to my mothertongue.. i do wish that there's something else i can do.. I am also determined to promote your rips.. you certainly deserve more appreciation sir...

Once again, thank you very much... this movie is great and no other rips can match its' quality at the size.. true 720p, clear audio and great movie... keep up the good work mister..."
