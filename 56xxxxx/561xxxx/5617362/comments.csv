1. Run the disk in a virtual cd drive (Daemon Tools/Alcohol 120%)

2. Click Install and open the .pdf - it contains the serial key

3. let the installation run and place the key in. the key is not invalid as i re-installed a couple of days ago.

4. finish installation. install 2.10 patch, and then install liveries. DONE!

5. For the -8i Expansion, run the installer, but for the key, just run enable_buttons.exe and click next. this will not cause problems! 

6. finish installation, install the patch, and install liveries! 

7. ENJOY!

NOTE: using enable_buttons for both will most likely corrupt the install. ONLY use it on the -8i expansion! using it on the -8i doesn't corrupt anything, as the SHA1 key used in the aircraft.cfg stays the same."

The installer is looking for an online resource which is blocked by hosts and as such crashes with the error: 0x800C0005 and the text: ""The system cannot locate the resource specified.""

Naturally it quits afterwards.
This is on Windows 7 X64."
