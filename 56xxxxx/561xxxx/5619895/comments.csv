I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

*** PLEASE NOTE - I CAN ONLY SEED OVERNIGHT (USA EASTERN TIME - AFTER MIDNIGHT) - REGARDLESS OF WHAT TIME I UP'D THE TORRENT - PLEASE BE PATIENT - I WILL ALWAYS SEED UNTIL COMPLETED BY 25-50 PEOPLE ***

just an FYI - this is a multi-tracker torrent and the total seed/leech numbers noted on TPB are not accurate - open in your bit torrent client to see 'real' numbers - enjoy brothers & sisters "

Winter has well and truly set in, so the camping tonight will be quite chilly.  The 3.5 hour drive will be made easier by having your music offerings rocking me along the highway.  Thanks muchly."
