Been seeding over 3:2 since i started the download.

I have installed AquaNox and started it up, I confirm that it works and the torrent is all good, I am now installing AquaNox 2: Revelation to.

Once again, Thanks a lot for this upload, very appreciated."
,esharoth,2010-06-11T15:08Z,"Yes, I read the request on the forum. I would have posted a link there, but the forum is down. You should give Archimedean Dynasty a try if you can stand the dated graphics."
,Dezzo90p,2010-06-11T16:17Z,"Ah, yes, I didn't even know of Archimedean Dynasty before you uploaded it. Might have to force myself to play it, I watched a Trailer and some Gameplay of it, didn't help much. So yeah, forcing myself is all that's left, best thing with it is that once I've forced myself to play it for an hour or so I'll no doubt be into it. 

Or I'll play AquaNox and AquaNox 2: Revelation and then play Archimedean Dynasty, if I really like AquaNox and AquaNox 2: Revelation I'll be wanting to play the first one to get a piece of the ""whole in-depth story"", curious about how it all started that is.

Didn't think it would get uploaded as fast as it did though, I appreciate it a lot. Before I made the request I waited for some time and checked in now and then if the English version(s) had been uploaded yet, in the end I couldn't wait no more so I joined up on the forum and made the request pretty much. Very easy to install the Games to, a real plus there, no complications at all whatsoever."
,rhshaffer,2010-09-05T05:53Z,Thanks for the upload. I have been looking for AQ for a while and geting AD and AQ2 on top of that just made my day. I got AQ with a graphics card I bought many years ago and lost the cd. So thanks for the upload again.
,domacleod,2011-06-15T16:01Z,"Nice torrent, but it could use more seeders :P"
,kriss13,2011-06-30T01:06Z,"is Archimedean Dynasty full iso (audio tracks too)?
Archimedean Dynasty is way better than what was done afterwards. IS OLD but still atractive, nice story, even graphics, considering 1996/486."
,kriss13,2011-06-30T21:50Z,"OMG:) AD has dosbox built in and runs in win7 with 0 conf.
THANKS!."
