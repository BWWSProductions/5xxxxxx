New in Thai cinemas this week is thriller-slasher-horror movie WHO ARE YOU?, telling the story about a mother who takes care of her weirdo son who has locked himself up in his room and only communicates via letters slipped back and forth under the door. Many details about the movie seem promising and we are expecting a horror film with a different twist. Hopefully WHO ARE YOU? can continue where some of the very good Thai horror films of 2009 have left off. The full review will follow shortly.
