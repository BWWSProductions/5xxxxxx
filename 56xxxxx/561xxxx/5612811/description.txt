Description from http://www.worldairroutes.com/SouthAfrican1.html

South African Airways recently became an Airbus A340 operator and one of the versions operated on busy long haul routes in the dash 600.

This dvd begins with a tour of the A340-600 from a maintenance perspective. This is followed by a typical flight in the cabin from Jo'burg to Frankfurt.

The next meeting place is Airbus' facility in Toulouse where our crew is about to take delivery of the last A340-600 for SAA. From the flight preparations we follow the pilots as we ferry the aircraft back to SAA's main base with a detour into British airspace.

This is my first time uploading so if I'm doing anything wrong stick a comment down there and let me know what it is!
