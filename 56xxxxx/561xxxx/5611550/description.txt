JÅdÅ (æ–é“:ã˜ã‚‡ã†ã©ã†?), meaning "the way of the jÅ", or jÅjutsu (æ–è¡“:ã˜ã‚‡ã†ã˜ã‚…ã¤?) is a Japanese martial art using short staffs called jÅ. The art is similar to bÅjutsu, and is strongly focused upon defense against the Japanese sword. The jÅ is a short staff, usually about 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) long. However, the art was not used, as one might expect, by travelers to ward off aggressive bandits or swordsmen. The martial art of jÅdÅ was the province of professional warriors.
