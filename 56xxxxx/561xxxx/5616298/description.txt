Further' is the seventh studio album from electronic production duo The Chemical Brothers. Each of the eight tracks on the album has a corresponding film clip, created by Adam Smith and Marcus Lyal, and designed specifically to match each song. Unlike most of the Chemical Brothers' previous output, this release does not feature any vocal collaborations. 'Further' contains the singles 'Escape Velocity' and 'Swoon'.
