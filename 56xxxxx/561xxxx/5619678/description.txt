Plot Summary: Max and Eddy are washed up pro snow
boarders who are reduced to constant partying and working as little at a mom 'n' pop operation called Stubby Peaks. 'Max and Eddy's 'Snowboard Camp' is
their scheme to find undiscovered kids with the
potential to turn pro. However, to make a go of the
school they also have to deal with Kingsley Brown
(Tom Green), the head of the National Snowboard
Association, who is determined to keep Max and Eddy
away from sanctioned events. Kingsley's
blackballing of the camp means that their only
candidates are a sorry lot of misfits - but they
are determined to discover one champion who will
help them to regain their former glory
