About this game:
In Boogie SuperStar, players don't just play along, they are the star of the game. Girls will have a blast belting their favorite tunes into the microphone, and performing real dance moves that are captured on screen using the Wii's motion-sensing technology. The journey to stardom doesn't have to be a solo, either. With two- and four-player modes, girls can play with their friends, sing and dance with their friends or against them in fun competitions that show-off their singing and dancing talent.
