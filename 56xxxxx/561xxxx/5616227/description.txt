
Joan Jett has been revolutionizing music for decades: from co-founding her

first major band, the pioneering all-girl punk quintet, the Runaways

("Cherry Bomb"), at only 15 years old to bringing the infectious music of

Joan Jett and the Blackhearts to the masses, her music has remained fresh

and culturally relevant. With such a continued interest in Jett's music,

the musician felt it was finally an appropriate time to release a

definitive Greatest Hits album. â€œFans have been asking me for years and

years for a new Greatest Hits album. There has always been interest,â€

said the musician. â€œBut, over the past few years I have been executive

producing a film about my first band, the Runaways. In the process, I

revisited the music and have really been living with it. It made me

realize that it would be great to get it back out into the market place

for the fans and for a new audience.â€



Just prior to the major motion picture The Runaways hits theatres, this 2

CD set and 2 LP set serves as both a new, definitive, Joan Jett Best Of

album and as a companion soundtrack the film. The album includes 7 songs

featured in the film, 1 previously unreleased track, all of the hits

re-mastered, and re-recordings of several Runaways favourites.
