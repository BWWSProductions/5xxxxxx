,beppe1987,2010-06-15T13:33Z,"can you really get 1080p res on a avi file? :S doubt it, why use mkv in that case?"
,flirtyguy10,2010-06-17T21:28Z,"lol @ akhilbayo
you are a noob!
its your computer which is too old to handle a full HD video..."
,flirtyguy10,2010-06-17T21:31Z,i first downloaded the 96mb version of this video which has almost the same quality as in this one but i later downloaded this one because it had a good audio bitrate of 320Kbps which sounds good in your home theater!

Yes, you can do 1080p on an .avi too. .avi or .mkv are nothing but just container formats, they contain the video(.h264, .divx etc...) and audio(mp3, AC3 etc...) and some extras(subtitles etc...) depending on the format. .mkv is a great container format with better features, that's the reason you see it being used for new releases, but that doesn't mean you can't use an .avi for containing 1080p video, but yeah the time of .avi is almost up as it is getting old. Hope that clears to whoever has this doubt :)"
