This is the only product that Microsoft has released that does not expire until Pro Plus is released for retail, which is not expected until September. Until then, it will remain activated. 

Pro plus is the only product that contains all MS Office programs.

Microsoft Office 2010 Pro plus BETA + Key

Includes:

Office 2010 executable file 32-bit BETA

Key inside a .txt file


Now you can either download this torrent or you can go to the microsoft website
and download it from there and enter this key to validate it.

This is good until Microsoft releases the retail version. You can use one of the many keygen's on TPB to validate it from there without downloading the entire office package again.
