,Daker9,2011-08-13T15:37Z,"LOL take it from a 55 year old Canadian. This band is very clever in capturing every guitar riff, cheesy keyboard and weak lyric and vocal of all those high school bands in all those North American towns in the late 60s and early 70s. The movie Almost Famous and The Onionâs Tee Shirt ""Your favorite band sucks"" comes to mind. 
It was fun for the first 20 minutes but back to my classic rock iPod originals. 
Thanks anyways and good luck guys cover ot the Rolling Stone ..lol"
