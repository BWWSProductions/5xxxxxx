Disappointing program, talks about the spill in the last 5 minutes only, the rest is typical NatGeo crap with sexy shots of helicopters that saved nobody & salvage crew that transports stuff to no avail as the rig sinks.

Trucks, boats, helicopters & burning rig, 5 minutes about the spill & zero ecology or political content. An American show typically superficial."
