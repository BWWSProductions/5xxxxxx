June (2004) (TV)

Plot:
Young, innocent, and quirky June, a violinist, spends her days working in an oddball Venice coffee shop, her nights rehearsing for a professional music career, and all-hours daydreaming about the beautiful man that's destined just for her. When she actually meets him in her own apartment building, she finds out Jack is engaged to the quintessential gorgeous bitch, Quinn. The conflict ensues and the romance is tested. Whether it's indulging her loony Grandma through rehearsals of her own funeral, or dealing with the overzealous video-store manager and his crush, June stumbles through her potential love life, her best friend Mary at her side.
