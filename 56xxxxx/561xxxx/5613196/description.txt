Review:
"The strength of the Ebbing and Gammon text is in its readability. Explanations are concise and nicely worded. Illustrations, pictures, and diagrams are very useable and useful. The special essays, 'A Chemist Looks At' and 'Instrumental Methods,' are well done and present students with a look at some of the chemistry they might miss in an ordinary text." -- Review --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
