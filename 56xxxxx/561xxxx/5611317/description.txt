Here it is, at last.  The original Unreal soundtrack.  Not the extended 2 disc version, unfortunately.  This is ripped straight from the CD that I've had for years.  As of now, there are no other seeded torrents for this that I could find.  Hopefully I can make someone as happy as I was when I found the cd..

Note: Towards the end of Chizra (Track 5) there are three audible clicks.  I'm guessing it's from a scratch on the cd or some other imperfection that I cannot see.  I'm not tech savvy enough to be able to fix it, but it really does not take anything away from the music.

All files are in .mp3 format.
