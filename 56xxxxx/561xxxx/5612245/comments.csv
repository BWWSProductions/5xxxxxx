,anna_bln,2010-10-12T13:54Z,"hi -- thanks for the upload! i am a little new to this and was wondering if this activation is good for all CS5 ME versions or is specific to only one version (extended, premium etc.)? should i just download it from the Adobe site and then run the activator or do i need to do some thing else? thanks!

Thanks"
