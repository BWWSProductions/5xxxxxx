,warloot24k,2010-06-21T05:57Z,"You need to install jeppview 3.5 and get the updates 0909 or earlier.... do not install the latest updates yet.... after installing jeppview 3.5, install the old updates (CD1 & 2)... from there.... you can use R00D-KCAB.  After activating it.... you can now install the latest updates.  Cheers!"
,Peace69,2010-06-22T13:24Z,"Guys, please someone seed Cycle 0109. This is the only one that will activate with R00D KCAB. Nothing else will do it. I had it but it got deleted!"
