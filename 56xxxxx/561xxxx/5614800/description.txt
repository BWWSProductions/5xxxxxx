Hidden Chambers at Giza

There is controversy swirling around recent activities on the Giza Plateau. Is there a new dig taking place in secret, and, if so, what is it for and why is it happening? Two years ago, Andrew Collins discovered a cave system under the plateau, the existence of which has been officially denied by Egyptian authorities.
