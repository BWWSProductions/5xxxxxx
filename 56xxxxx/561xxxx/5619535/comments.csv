So, HERE they are!!

my upload speed realy sucks
Its [Dial-up Modem (Nokia mobile-Airtel GPRS) 28kB/s]
BUT i will seed as much as possible


inform me (by comments) if ANYONE starts download. So that i can SEED  MORE!!"
,newprince,2010-06-10T21:59Z,"BTW, i have provided txt files bcoz they take less size (2MB) and are easily compressable (6.2MB to 2MB).
Compressed using ""PPmd mode 7-z""
OPEN it using WINRAR or 7-zip."
,newprince,2010-06-10T22:01Z,"i have the PDF and LIT versions of all these files too!
but they occupy so large size. hard to upload on my slow connection. 
but i will surely upload them one day!"
,newprince,2010-06-10T22:12Z,"wOw!
already 3 users downloaded my torrent while i was busy writing 3 comments here.

OK! Then Plz SEED

I will keep SEEDing as much as i can.

I have problems {15KB/s connection, high data charges cost (0.5Rs/1MB) (45Rs=1$), high electricity bill, etc}.
BUT still i am SEEDING this."
,newprince,2010-06-21T19:44Z,"BTW, I uploaded the "".txt"" files so that the size is less.

,slow09,2011-10-28T16:15Z,"Hey ... Just registered to comment.

Want to show my appreciation and thank you for this work within the torrent.

I'm wondering if you could perhaps convert all of these to PDF if you haven't already and possibly send them to me via e-mail?
Your blog link simply states you have run out of bandwidth, so maybe e-mail would be easier?

Get back to me when you can, and best of luck with future uploads!"
