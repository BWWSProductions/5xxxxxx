Dolby Digital of the Refused - Shape Of Punk to Come DVD-Audio 5.1

For those of you who didn't know it existed or were too cheap to buy it.

Currently on sale at the Epitaph webstore for $9 as part of a bundle or $12 by itself... total bargain.  If you dig it, go buy it.  http://www.kingsroadmerch.com/epitaph-records/artist/?id=84

For those with DVD-A capable players, there's the added bonus of the hi-res audio layer which sounds superior to the Dolby mix... but not here, just on the actual DVD-A.

Burn or mount, it's an ISO.

Enjoy,
