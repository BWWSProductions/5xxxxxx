[V],harry711,2010-06-17T20:21Z,"@rgmontejo: No, it is not HD, else I would have put it in that section. It is, however, the highest res I could find of this."
,syriaccjoseph,2010-06-18T04:34Z,why can't apple itunes use a torrent client for all the downloads?
[V],harry711,2010-06-19T05:56Z,"@syriaccjoseph: because ""torrents = piracy"", which is wrong. Don't ever expect a large company to use this nice open method of content distribution, due to their incorrect ideas on torrents. :("
