,mys23212,2010-06-07T04:56Z,will it work on 5.00 m33-6?
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-07T05:43Z,"Only been tested on GEN-D3. But you can try it on m33-6. If it doesn't work, you can always downgrade to GEN-D3."
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-07T16:11Z,Someone confirm it works and state the firmware you ran it on.
,tory12,2010-06-07T21:54Z,"Works on 5.03GEN-B.
Works even without KHBBS prx's(But i cant confirm there are no crashes without this).

So it should work on 5.50GEN-D and up also.

One useful tip: many games won't work on cfw and gives error or simple even don't start.
You must enable ""Use version txt"" option in recovery menu. Then many games work fine."
,badkiller2,2010-06-08T00:48Z,"here is the best firmware for 2000/1000-PHAT!.

Use 5.50 GEN-D2 for this game. It works perfect and smoothly. Enjoy your game ^^"
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-08T01:19Z,"Thank you tory12,

I have GEN-D3 but to lazy to change it to anything else to test it. :P"
,nyekker,2010-06-08T02:58Z,I'll try this one. Hope it's working. Thanks!
,dan_showbiz,2010-06-08T05:40Z,i want to know as well if it works on 5.00 m33-6
,Haseo21,2010-06-08T13:11Z,seed pls!
,Raziel_cz,2010-06-08T15:42Z,"I can confirm functionality on CFW 5.50 GEN?D3. You need KHBBS on the root of memory card (You can download here, from ArvenianQ: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5611152/KHBBS_prx__s).

It? best game i ever played. Thanks man. ;)"
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-06-08T18:20Z,"I am on gen d-3 without khbbs or what ever it is.  Been playing it for 4 hours never freezes or crashes, at least not yet. "
,jarrod111,2010-06-09T04:48Z,"Hi I originally did not use the KHBBS prx patch because it was working without it, but then I froze at a point in the first chapter where you come across your first prisoner.

Then i decided i should install the patch, i did and it froze at the same spot.

Does anyone know what my problem is?
I'm on GEN-D3"
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-09T05:29Z,"Did you change the game.txt to activate the prx's? If not, you should or the prx's are just idle. If you did, then i don't know whats wrong with yours. Mine works flawlessly(might be something else i did to my PSP). You can try keus123's freeze fix: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5615662/Metal_Gear_Solid_Peace_Walker_USA_5.50_Gen-D3_Freeze_Fix 
Hope I helped."
,dan_showbiz,2010-06-09T05:48Z,"no one has tested on 5.00 m33-6? 

i cant get it without being 100% sure that it works because my internet connection sucks donkey ass"
,HIggyBaby,2010-06-09T13:01Z,M33-6 5.00 anyone? please test and reply . I'm on a slow internet connection too
,solidamus,2010-06-09T14:37Z,"Tried with 5.00 m33-6, just getting a black screen. :"
,nyekker,2010-06-09T16:38Z,"I get black screen too, not loading. I'm using 5.03 M33-6. Don't know what's wrong. I tried Gen-C, still same problem."
,ocindm,2010-06-09T18:16Z,freezes on the 2nd tank boss when aiming or shooting.
,zeel_patelm,2010-06-09T21:55Z,"@nyekker, ocindm
try changin cpu speed and clock speed to default from ur VSH menu... it worked for me..."
,Bloodhound1227,2010-06-09T23:25Z,i tried this on my 5.03 m33-6 and it doesnt work all i see is a black screen and it crashes now i just hope someone will upload it only for m33-6 because i want this game so bad :( and all the torrents for peace walker they are just for gen d3 i think so no this game doesnt work on 5.00 m33-6
,nyekker,2010-06-10T02:57Z,"@zeel_patelm
Didn't work. I tried. I'll just wait for more fixes soon on this game. I have PS3 to play with anyway. Thanks, guys! I envy those who are now playing the game. LOL"
,kevin1366,2010-06-10T08:04Z,"works on gen-d3.
problem with killing soldiers on vehicle boss missions though.
even just shooting the soldiers freezes my game then shuts down my psp. any known fix for this?"
,brydavok,2010-06-10T16:03Z,got it working on my psp 3001 gen-c..what a badass game!! it's solid!!thanks uploader... keep it up!!!
,Haseo21,2010-06-10T19:17Z,good game! but crashes sometimes
,kevin1366,2010-06-11T03:39Z,"crap, when i got to the second chapter after the cutscene where snake hides from the flying thing, it suddenly hangs then shuts down at the loading screen. anyone else had this problem?"
,Holden_Makok,2010-06-12T03:36Z,yeah mine freezes  at the same spot making me all emo
,aieimeel,2010-06-12T07:50Z,"just use cfw 5.50 genD-2.. works great. the will never be freeze during aiming or shooting ( mostly happened while fighting boss- tank) ..
cfw can be change from  D2 to D3/ D3 to D2 using 
D2-D3 switcher.. here is the link http://www.psp-hacks.com/2010/06/11/5-50-gen-d2-d3-switcher-released/"

using home-brew above pay ATTENTION
KHBBS patch must be disabled or you will get a semi-brick psp"
,plor_en,2010-06-12T17:46Z,"I got the damn thing to work using ISOTOOL 1.52!

BUT FIRST OF ALL, you need:
1. unadultered/unpatched/fresh .iso file of the game (look for torrents containing file psy-mgspw.iso, I got mine from here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5607981/Metal_Gear_Solid_Peace_Walker_USA_PSP_%5Bwww.forodescargasdirectas

2. You need a unit with CFW 5.00 m33-6

My current FW is 5.00 m33-6 in a FAT-100?.

1. I just downloaded ISOTOOL 1.52 and the latest PROMETHEUS v0.3 from psp-hacks.com.

2. Then I overwritten the PROMETHEUS folder in ISOTOOL with the contents of the latest PROMETHEUS.

3. I then copied the whole ISOTOOL folder into the PSP's memory stick (under PSP/GAME folder)

4. Then I copied the iso file psy-mgspw.iso (downloaded from another torrent) to the ISO folder.

5. I just ran ISOTOOL in the PSP, DECRYPTED the .iso file (saying YES to the 3 questions), then PATCHED the .iso file using the PROMETHEUS option in ISOTOOL.

6. After that I was playing for an hour straight with no problems.

It's my first time to patch an .iso file and it was such a no brainer. I never thought I could do it.

Mabuhay ang mga Pinoy! Yeah! "
,pspaddict,2010-06-13T05:29Z,"If you have a PSP running GEN-D3 and want to play MGS: Peace Walker this is what you do. There's a program that allows you to change from D3 to D2 flawlessly. Peace Walker works fine on D2. Other games won't play so you'll have to switch from D2 to D3 but that shouldn't be that much trouble. Here's the D2 Switcher:

,strumtop,2010-06-13T06:28Z,Works for me .. I finished the game. :) I'm using Gen C with enabled KHBBS prx's and game.txt ... CIAO!! Hail to Chickhen R2 .HAHAHA :P no crashes dude!! tnx a lot!!
,Raziel_cz,2010-06-13T10:09Z,"Hi, I have a problem. Game works fine, but i am in level, in undegroudn base, after i defeated Cocoon and there are the doors, which iI can´t open. The game says, that I need to pressing one button, but it doesn´t work. Somebody who finished MGS PW, any advice?"
,manuel88,2010-06-13T19:32Z,"@ raziel 

Use the elevator.   "
,manuel88,2010-06-13T19:38Z,"when you start the mission make the first right, and on the right you will see a group of dudes saying to guard the elevator.  thats where you go and from the rest is go straight until you get to a door thats closed.  you used the action button ( depending on your settings ) up on the d - pad .  you then button mash the button to get the door open and get ready to play again the boss so to speak lol"
,Raziel_cz,2010-06-14T15:45Z,"I´am pressing like a bitch, but no reaction. Snake can´t open that door..."
,manuel88,2010-06-14T20:51Z,"dude knock out all the guards.  go to the control panel on the right side not the elevator its self.  the panel is right next to the elevator, and then you should go through.  don't go in alert mode either.  you have to be in a normal alert mode, like the one that it starts you off in that mission "
,JasonKun,2010-06-15T03:01Z,I switched from m33-6 to GEN D3 and it doesn't even work. I even tried D3 as well. It just freezes at black screen.
,Raziel_cz,2010-06-15T14:41Z,"I told about the door, maybe 2 maps next the room with elevator... But thanks for tips, I did it by myself at the end. This clicking situations are evil."
,Sylpheon,2010-06-26T20:27Z,Works perfect with KHBBS and game.txt updated
,ajdoms,2010-06-27T18:07Z,"to everyone,
i have a 3.71 M33-2 psp slim and i don't know if it is safe to update it to the latest network update. im scared that when i do that i won't be able to play downloaded games. i really want this MGS peace walker badly...and what is PRX's and KHBBS Patch? please someone explain this to me... thank you very much..."
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-28T20:04Z,Just click on my name to find the KHBBS
,Benjihad,2010-07-25T20:12Z,"Thanks, I don't know why but MGS was working fine for me (5.00 M33-6) and then I fucked up the flash0 with some raunchy coldboot and waves so I had to reinstall CFW and then the game wouldn't work, so I've been doing things and trying out different plugins and shit for a few hours but nothing helps.  So hopefully this will solve it, I got the downloads recommended as well and we'll see.  Thanks again man."
,Benjihad,2010-07-25T23:47Z,"It works!!! Perfectly in fact.  MGS and Tekken are both working for me, I'll try GT soon.  Thank you so much man.  The flashing 5.5 Gen and recovering to 5.00 m33 is genius and it works well except that my recovery mode settings get reset, but I'm sure I can back them up or something, anyway I like Gen a lot but I read that there's no 1.5 kernel so I can't play a lot of my favorite homebrew.  If it weren't for that than I'd just stay upgraded.  Thank you again a ton, I will seed all three torrents for a long long time. :D"
