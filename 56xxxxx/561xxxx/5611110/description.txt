@ Whoever wanted to know...

   Never update to an official firmware update or you will not be able to play your downloaded games. You can update to gen-d3 without losing everything just browse around on www.psp-hacks.com. KHBBS -Short for "Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep". It enables you to play Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. It also enables other games like the new Prince of Persia and Metal Gear Solid PW. All you have to do is download the KHBBS and put it in your main directory (Where it shows the folders PSP,Video,Music,ISO,SePlugins,etc) do not put it in your seplugins! Once the KHBBS folder is in your main directory the game will still not work without freezes until you go into the seplugins folder and open up the game.txt and type in something like this ms0:/(Folder name)/(file name) 1. The "1" means "activated".
Example: ms0:/KHBBS/KHBBS_Patch.prx 1
