I went to this movie hoping to just be entertained. Wow! This is a great movie.
I've seen other comedies this year but this by far has to be the funniest! Hilarity abounds at this funeral. It's a great time to be had by all. Laughs galore! 
Parents beware. There is a good reason for the R Rating. There are a few gags to that are not suitable for children: There are the gross out poop gags having to do with the character of Uncle Russell and some total-male-nudity gags that occur when one character gets high on dope. 
But aside from that it's 90% good-natured humor that comes from incidents that are described in other reviews.
What happens to Danny Glover's character (Uncle Russell) at the end you've just got to see!
