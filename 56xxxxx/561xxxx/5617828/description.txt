Alex talks with filmmaker Brain [sic] Kraft [and James Petula] in-studio. Kraft produced The Fall of America and the Western World, a 9 disc DVD series that makes the argument that America, Europe and the Western world are in serious trouble and poised for collapse. "The DVD box set offers families hundreds of actionable tips so they can learn how to buy precious metals, diversify their portfolios, protect themselves from economic crisis and martial law, get off the grid, fight the new world order and globalism, and protect the middle class," explains a press release on the documentary.

Alex also talks with Gerald Celente, renowned trend forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant and author who makes predictions about the global financial markets and other events of historical importance.
[come on about 8:00 in hour 3 and Alex says he'll be there until "the bottom of the hour." He is not heard, however, after 34:00 in hour 3.]

Alex takes a number of calls and covers the latest news.


Near the end of hour 4, Alex announces that he will be going into OverDrive for about 30 minutes.  It turns out to be closer to 75 minutes. Unfortunately the audio file for the OverDrive segment is at 32k bitrate rather than the usual 64K.


The later part of hour 4 and much of overdrive deals with "Rise of the New Right," a mini-documentary starring Chris Matthews and set to air tonight on MSNBC. I am including with today's torrent files a .pdf version of a script for this program, which was sent to Infowars by an anonymous source. It appears to be an early draft.

As overdrive approaches the end of its first hour, Alex goes into a rant accusing the Adult Swim [an adult-oriented cable television network that shares channel space with Cartoon Network from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM ET/PT in the US] show, Squidbillies of spreading lies, double-messages and brainwashing related to fluoride.  To be blunt, I don't think Alex really quite "gets" Squidbillies [which he calls a children's show].

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
