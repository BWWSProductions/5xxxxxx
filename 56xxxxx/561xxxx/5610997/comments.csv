@2040

I'm using BitTorrent 6.4. Just 3mb left to complete. VLC is not able to play. I will create an email account in the evening today. 

I tried uTorrent 2.0.2 but it is not giving stable performance as download rate fluctuates too much. S0 i downgraded

@D07792: Listen: uTorrent 2.0 and BitTorrent are - absolutely same (just named differently). Therefore, only differences could be the settings.
Pardon - not ""could "" but - are.
So, check the text from my answer I gave yesterday to sdcheeran on Stargate and maybe you can dig something out.

,D07792,2010-06-07T07:05Z,"I have tried all that is possible from my end. It seems i just can connect to you. So I give up on this.

Thanks "
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-07T09:25Z,"Nope, you haven't done anything. In fact, I have one peer from Netherlands but he left after 19.8%.

Your words were:

...""I will create an email account in the evening today.""

How in hell could I see or find whats going out?
I just needed 10 minutes of your cooperation, nothing else, to get your IP address - but not here, publicly, but as hundredths before - one simple mail from me and one simple one-liner from you.

I don't get it, sorry. Opening of gmail or yahoo mail account needs 6 minutes . at least twice as much of time is needed for writing three same messages in three days.
But... it's your call."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-07T09:36Z,"err.
going out = going on
(I guess I was thinking of sending chunks of bytes)
Sorry."
,riaa_sink,2010-06-07T16:07Z,hey i've downloaded this with utorrent to 100 percent. but when i play it it only plays audio with a black screen. i played it with quicktime player and realplayer. on both i have a completely black screen. I'm sure this is just something wrong with me twentyforty. help would be much appreciated :D
,sanyam123,2010-06-08T07:10Z,@riaa_sink: use K-lite codec player or VLC player for playing videos...
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-08T08:25Z,"@riaa_sink: Even theoretically QuickTime Player MUST play my files. I use QT player and it plays perfectly fine, only the sound quality is inferior, but that's old QT problem and the way he use DirectSound layer on Windows
For sake of god, Apple supports MP4 natively, from day one.
Only thing I can imagine as your ""problem"" is either your WRONG settings in QT player (look for ""Overlay"" use) or simply - you have really OLD and OBSOLETE QT version and you should upgrade.
RealTime player is for RealTime format, something I don't care about at all.
VLC is absolutely free (videolan.org) and available for all operating systems.
However, video quality is lower (blurrier) by 10-20% - therefore I have added "" The Note"" where you can find few things.

@sanyam: Thanks, my friend."
