After his foray into old school country with 2004's "Cut 'N Shoot", legendary singer/songwriter/guitarist/producer Morlix explores a darker, more rock-oriented vibe with this record. Recorded after a year in which he lost several people close to him, the theme of death and dying surfaces on several tracks. His trademark dark humor, however, tempers the sadness and makes "Diamonds And Dust" a unique listening experience. In addition to his originals, Morlix includes a cover of Dylan's "With God On Our Side", a song as timely today as it was when it was written 44 years ago. This is another unique and brilliant chapter in Morlix's uniquely brilliant career.
