Floor Thirteen is a Canadian rock band formed in Winnipeg in the late 1990s. The band has always classified their music as "rock and roll" and their '60s and '70s influenced yet modern sound have often been compared to bands such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e, Jet, and Wolfmother.


Floor Thirteen entered 441 Studios in Winnipeg with Brandon Friesen to produce their debut album Mmmm!. Brandon has won two Juno Awards and was previously nominated for a Grammy Award. Since its release, the LP debuted at number one in Winnipeg record sales for the week of August 10, 2008, outselling albums such as Miley Cyrus' Breakout, Coldplay's Viva La Vida, and Kid Rock's Rock N Roll Jesus.

Floor Thirteen's song, "Blame It On Me," was licensed to major video game company EA Games in August. Since then, EA Games has placed the song in the games Need For Speed: Undercover and The Sims 3. Since the summer release of their debut full length album Mmmm!, the band has been turning up in more than just games. In September, "Blame It On Me" popped up on George Stroumboulopoulos' The Strombo Show. The next month, the band headed to the UK to showcase for major industry bigwigs in London's MUSEXPO Europe. Floor Thirteen was also the featured artist on internationally syndicated import radio show, Passport Approved, which airs all over the US and has a presence in Germany and the U.K.
