Amos provides you with powerful and easy-to-use structuralequation modeling (SEM) software. Create more realistic models than if you used standard multivariate statistics or multiple regression models alone. Using Amos, you specify, estimate,   
 assess, and present your model in an intuitive path diagram to show hypothesized relationships among variables. This enables you to test and confirm the validity of claims such as "value drives loyalty" in minutes, not hours.
                        
Amos enables you to build models that more realistically reflect complex relationships with the ability to use observed variables such as survey data or latent variables like â€œsatisfactionâ€ to predict any other numeric variable.         
Structural equation modeling, sometimes called path analysis,helps you gain additional insight into causal models and the strength of variable relationships.
