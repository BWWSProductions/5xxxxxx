,nospam4rod,2011-09-23T20:53Z,"I am unable to start this app in my Windows 7 Professional (64 bit version).

I get a warning dialog box with the following:

==========================
C:\Program Files (x86)\SAS\JMP\8\jmp.exe
=========================
==========================
Unable to launch, JMP has not been installed properly
==========================

Then after clicking OK I get another dialog, this time for an ERROR:

==========================
Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library
==========================
==========================
Runtime Error!
Program: C:\Program Files (x86)\SAS\JMP\8\jmp.exe

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way.
Please contact the application's support team for more information.
==========================


Does anyone have any ideas? Is my OS missing some library? I think I have VC++ libraries for 2005, 2008, and 2010 installed...

(I have also tried to start the program as administrator and in WinXP compat. mode).

THANKS!

Thanks for the uploads pmp_2010. "
