[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T09:34Z,"The difference between an emulator iso and a wii iso is the size in the hard disk after extraction , while in emulator iso you only occupy the real siz eof the game , with the wii iso you need 4.37 gb even if the game have only 1gb and something , in a wii iso if you download a game with 1.5 gb for example after extraction , the game will be occupying 4.37 gb hard disk space beside the fact that was only 1.5 gb to download , so the emulator isos get nice sizes and only occupy the game real space , not the complete iso space that wii iso need to be ok ."
,anand1303,2010-06-10T10:36Z,Downloading now.... Thanks... I hope it works... I don't know I can request here but if you can upload the first one too that would be great. Cheers

,Fryyttus,2010-06-10T10:50Z,and one more thing that if we can play all wii games with it

,.schmu,2010-06-10T13:45Z,@globe could you get us an Okami .dolphin iso by any chance? looking for ages for that game...
,RMJ13,2010-06-10T13:45Z,error extracting file oh well
,ninjanutta,2010-06-10T16:53Z,"theres no pc poerful enough to emulate x360,maybe in about 5 years."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T17:33Z,"To fryytus : it is curious what you said , my ideal was the ps3 and xbox360 can be played too with nice mulators on the pc but that is not possible for the moment and i donÂ´t know how much time can take the possibility of that .
To catteyezz : i think is really obvious , you move the wii folder that is separetdly from the 32 or 64 bits emulator folders from where it is to the user folder of the choosed emulator bits folder , if you use 32 bits in your machine the wii folder go to the 32 bits emulator , if you use 64 bits the wii folder go to the user folder in the 64 bits emulator folder .
To schmu : i am a newbye on this wii games , iprobably lot of nice games out there but 2 of the best games for shore i have already available : prince of persia - the forgotten sands working 100% and this one , super mario galaxy 2 , only 1.29 gb including after the extraction .
Who have problems with extraction or system for any strange reason that i donÂ´t get that easily , restart the computer then try the extraction or the run of the game again ."

,PleaseDontBanMe,2010-06-11T08:07Z,Super fast download. Thank you very much globe :).  @RMJ13 if you had an error extracting make sure you're using WinRAR and if it's still not working re-download and try again.

,PleaseDontBanMe,2010-06-11T08:48Z,Is anyone else getting huge video lag once the game starts? I'm on windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit and everything is fine until the first scene when you start running and everything goes slow motion and Mario has no eyes. I have an HD 4870 running catalyst 10.5 and Phenom II X4 965 so I know hardware isn't an issue. I've messed around with lots of graphical and configuration settings without much luck. If anyone has a solution please let me know. Thanks
,anand1303,2010-06-11T12:11Z,How do I spin to break the crystal early in the game...? it shows spinning remote in the bottom but moving mouse doesn't help....
,AZkiller7,2010-06-11T12:21Z,"@PleaseDontBanMe

having mario without eyes and game running slow on your good machine reveals that Globeplus included and old revision of the emulator.

@Globeplus Please specify which revision you used.

@anand By default the shake button is assigned to the mouse wheel, just press it !"

Hey would you mind explaining how your wonderful torrent plays horribly on dolphin v2.0. If it requires an older version please specify this in the download info. KTHX"

,AZkiller7,2010-06-13T00:39Z,"@Veronika109
that's a known bug for Dolphin, however there's a workaround to bypass it.
before starting the game, go to Sound Plugin settings, Uncheck all the three options, and put volume to 1, and switch Dsound to Openal. now play the game, defeat the Boss, after the game saves, you can return everything to normal. anyway, you have to do this for every Boss"

Well in my pc i get 60fps all the time

Well if you fell like an upgrade i advise you a nvidia GTX280 its not that expencive plus it will run anything with good speed and enhancement like antialiasing and stuff"

If u have trouble running this game read following passage ...
1.If u got a message to connect 1 player's wiimote(if u have no real wiimote),& unable to play this game just open dolphin then click wiimote.Then select emulated wiimote.Then click configure,Now right side of window (Under shake option) u will see Extension.Under extetion select nunchuck then click configure.Now select ur key.Remape stick option for moving,remape button option for some power,Remap shake option for (Default is click 2) for shake move.Now u ready to go.
2.U can save [by pressing shift + f1,shift + f2....]& load [by pressing f1,f2,f3....] this game any time by the emulator.But sometime it will cause crash or some other bug & glitch.Alternatively the game will atomically save after some check point(when u get a star) so u have to play this game long enough to reach save point.So have patient.

I am now play this game in full screen with Resolution 1440x900 & 60fps with my keyboard & mouse."
