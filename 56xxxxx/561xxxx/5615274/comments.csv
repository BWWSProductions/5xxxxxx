,les907,2010-06-14T23:38Z,"5 Games: FandianDS (My firmware couldn't load it); Mazemania (A cursor-drag-your-hero kind of game from point A to B gradually getting harder, then after every 5th maze thasks you English grammar questions to make you feel stupid); StraycatDS (a very simple throwback to Atari, side-scrolling run-and-jump game with a song that's equal parts funny and annoying; Yetixmass (basic 1st person shooter. I wanted to figure out the story to why I'm in cave shooting endless supplies of Yeti but it couldn't keep my attention long enough); Scribble DS (pretty basic drawing etch-a-sketch game that entertained my 3 year old after I got his attention with the StrayCat DS song.

Overall score: 1.5/5. No disrespect to the authors - games are hard to make I know. And I love supporting new talent, but these aren't even NES worthy."
