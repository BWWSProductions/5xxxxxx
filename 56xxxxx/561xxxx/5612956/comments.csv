,-Leto-,2010-06-08T10:28Z,"Even though it's posted by Anonymous this is the real deal, fakes are extremely rare in the High res category."
,Manicle,2010-06-17T15:08Z,"Don't worry, this is the real deal.  ;)

Moreover, if -jonny- writes in here, giving an iMDB link, well ... you know can trust this torrent."
,maurfahr,2010-06-18T16:46Z,"How do you burn these files,is it posible to burn on a regular dvd disc?"
,Manicle,2010-06-19T23:08Z,"@maurfahr
Why would you want to do that ? To read the disc on a regular DVD player ?
You'll need a DivX+ HD player for these MKV HD files.
