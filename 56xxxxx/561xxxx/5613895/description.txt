BROWNIE  McGHEE  BACK HOME BLUES
Label: Past Perfect
CD Released: 2001 
Format: Mp3 @320



Although he is chiefly known for his long collaboration with blind harmonica player Sonny Terry, guitarist Brownie McGhee made scores of recordings under his own name, including the ones collected here, which are drawn from his three sessions in 1941 for OKeh Records. There is a lively, fun, and refreshing intimacy to these sides, as McGhee, accompanied by Bull City Red on washboard and occasional second guitar from Buddy Moss, delivers a set of folk blues filled with obvious joy. His first pairing with Terry on harmonica, "Workingman's Blues," is here, as well as tracks where Jordan Webb handles the harp duties. McGhee and company deliver a whole lot of whooping and stomping in an endearing street-corner style.
