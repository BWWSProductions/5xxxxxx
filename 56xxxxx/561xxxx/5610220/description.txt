it's an acoustic folk-rock band from russian far-eastern town Ussuriisk, called Zhivaya Shlyapa (alive hat).

it's kind of a private torrent, so I won't be seeding it after the person for whom I share it will download it all

but if you, for some reasons, want to check it out, and there's no seeds, leave a comment

p.s. how's my english? :)
