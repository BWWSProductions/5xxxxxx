
Although Kool & the Gang became pop superstars in the 1980s on the strength of J.T. Taylor's silky voice and several catchy arrangements, R&B fans regard their true glory days as the 1970s. 
The New Jersey-based ensemble patented a jazz-tinged funk approach keyed by Robert "Kool" Bell's basslines, red-hot horn lines, chunky keyboards and guitar riffs, and functional vocals. Although they seldom ventured beyond the R&B charts during this era, their music had far more bite than their later pop hits. 
These 16 cuts pay homage to Kool & the Gang's funk roots, and should be a revelation to those who only know them as the light ensemble behind J.T. Taylor. (AMG)
