,dobiebarns,2010-06-08T20:44Z,Why not a a criticism of your own society and then change it with love and good acts!
,billiewinkle,2010-06-09T04:23Z,What do you mean? Islamic society is perfect and we will kill your women and children if you complain. Islam is superior in all ways. As we speak a 10 story multimillion dollar mosque is going onto downtown New York near the Two Towers. The mosque will be named after a celebrated Muslim victory in Spain and will be built on the ashes of your dead women and children. Silly Americans you have no honor and don't even realize Islam will triumph over you as your own politicians sell you out. Led by an Islamic President of uncertain heritage you will fall and all of you will convert of die.
