Criticism of the Western Society & Civilization - A Collection:


We start with this upload a series that present critical views of the Western society and civilization. Although a separation between state and religion took place in many of the Western countries, but still Christianity is a major factor that influences the system of values and morals in the West. 

The last 100 years in the history of the West is stained by catastrophic events that caused considerable pain to humanity and destruction to planet Earth. We had 2 World Wars, the rise and fall of Nazism, the rise and fall of Communism, and major ecological disasters. The dominance of Capitalism in the last 30 years had caused one crisis after another; we had financial crises, failures of banks and investment institutions, and economic meltdowns. 

On the social side, the West is characterized by the wide spread of corruptions and frauds, of homeless people and poverty in rich societies, of pornography and prostitution, of broken homes and single-parent families, and of teenage sex and pregnancy
