I'm glad you have enjoyed the Stargate rips.  The final Season 10 should hopefully be up sometime this weekend.  I just have to add the subtitles.  As far as your questions go.  Sorry, but I don't plan on releasing the dvd extras.  And as far as Atlantis, I did think about doing that next.  However, there are already high quality rips of Atlantis out there.  I have just finished dowloading the bluray rips and they are fantastic.  I would always choose bluray over dvd rips.  So I don't think there would be much interest.

I plan on ripping ""Space Above and Beyond"" next.  It is only a one season show.  Then after that, I will probably rip Star Trek Deep Space Nine and/or Star Trek Voyager.  However, if there seems to be enough interest in Atlantis, I would consider that."

There is a big torrent of season 1-5 of â€œgood qualityâ€ of atlantis but in that torrent only season 3-5 works and there are no directors commentaries

So please upload atlantis and especially season 2 with commentaries please :)"
,history_boy_,2011-06-19T11:30Z,"Beauty - Thanks very meech! Haha. I've had old copies of SG-1 SE1-10 for years and they were pretty terrible in comparison. Watchable, but you know how it is. Better quality IS better. 

I will get the files on the UL as much as possible but I can't promise permanent connection.
Thanks to everyone who seeded, even those who limited their UL rate. It doesn't matter, just means you have to be more patient. (Those who whine about it, please just think how much time and effort it takes to get these series UP on the service)

Thanks again guys
