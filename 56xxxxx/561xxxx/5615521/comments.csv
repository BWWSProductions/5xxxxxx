[V],jainmehul,2010-06-12T07:35Z,plzzz help me bubanee i downloaded a .ape and a .cue file also came with it what do i do to split it in mp3 files????
[V],bubanee,2010-06-12T11:50Z,"Cheers All!!!

.ape... the trick here is to convert it back to WAV first... then to .mp3.. my only advice is use DBPoweramp, you may have to grab the codec for it or it may be already installed.. if you have not got DB just type the name and google it or get one from here at TPB, the reason why to convert to WAV is that APE is more or less like FLAC.. you should always go back to WAV then to MP3 with these no loss files.. and check the IDTAGs as well... afterwards.. let me know if you did sought it out.. "
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-12T12:25Z,"thanx bubs for ur info.
