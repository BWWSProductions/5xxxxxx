,bychance,2010-06-25T01:28Z,"fidoxx, download KMPlayer, it's perfect for these type of files. Great work SaM, thanks."
,eduardoumeoka,2010-08-10T07:06Z,"I downloaded it and it's works on my PC, but it dosen't works on my Samsung BD player C5500. Why?"
,eduardoumeoka,2010-08-10T07:10Z,"I downloaded it, and it works on my PC, but it dosen't works on my BD player (Samsung C5500). I can run others .mkv files well, but this one I can't. Why?"
,Balint01,2010-08-31T18:35Z,Please seed!!!
,Gh057man,2011-07-20T20:09Z,This is just a flatout bad conversion. Don't waste your time and dowload. It stutters in my Samsung C5500 as well. It also won't play/stutters on my PC and two other laptops including one with dedicated 1Gb of graphics. I used VLC and KMPlayer. Download from elsewhere! Stop seeding this shit!! :}
,vhiiska,2012-01-19T21:35Z,"The quality is impeccable. Interlaced 1920x1080 @ 29.970 HZ + DTS-HD MA lossless sounds.

If it stutters, it is because your wreck of a computer can't handle the quality. Either your computer is too slow or you don't know how to configure it. In either case, you are a n00b."
,red5goahead,2012-02-26T21:41Z,Imho bad conversion to 29.970 fps.vhiiska do not understand that duplicated frames that cause stutter is visible also viewing frames step by step. is not a cpu issue or bad refresh rate setting.
,abscorpy,2012-03-24T21:15Z,the quality is bad people
