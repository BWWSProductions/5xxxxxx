,dothackjhe,2010-06-10T11:25Z,"The uploader seems to be a big fan of truetoxic klown, if not him. I've tried klown's upload at !$0hunT but it didn't work for my PSP Slim CFW 5.50 GEN D3. I also tried patching it using Prometheus patch, but it didn't work still. Does this game really work on GEN D3? "
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-10T16:37Z,Thank you! I've been waiting for this. I agree m33 is dead it is time to upgrade.
,dothackjhe,2010-06-11T03:54Z,The game works for me now ^____^. The problem was caused by some plug-in. Thanks for the upload. ^____^

,FernFrond,2010-06-21T01:16Z,TYTYTY I have gen d3 and its so ez to get on. DISGAEA FUCK YEAH. I have long been awaiting this day. I have disgaea 2 for psp and have been playing it for a very long time. I even had disgaea 3 for ps3 but quit after I got laharl and etna at level 3000 without any reincarnation and spent $50 on addons that I didn't use because of how ANTi-life it would be for me to utilize it all. I would be a fat nerd if I fully used all of them. Finally a simple and fun disgaea for psp. WILL SEED.
,FernFrond,2010-06-28T02:50Z,"Played it for a while, and helps to understand some of the underlying sub-plots etc. of other disgaea games. Going through everything is like a nerdy way to connect with all Disgaea games at once without the grinding or leveling up. Torrent it but do not under any circumstances buy this game. IT will only encourage further shenanigans from NIS America. You will use the skip scene quick-key quite often. The Timeline is also quite annoying. The logs of items/characters is cool and more of an extension to say Disgaea 1 or 2 for psp. It could be useful for nerdy archiving goals. I laughed quite often, but that's only because I don't have much joy in my life. Save yourself the time and play an epic game like Phantasy star portable 2 which is very easy to play regardless of it being in Japanese. It's a smoother experience if you prefer to only play ad-hoc with a pal. If not, just wait a few months for the English release. It also helps to play Phantasty star 1 just to get the hang of things then switch over because 2 is so much better. It's a lot like MOnster Hunter but less impossible. We all know that dual Tigrexes can't be taken down without hacking in a small arena. That's complete BULLSHIT. "
