From Wiki:


Dangerous Minds (1995) is an American drama film based on the autobiography My Posse Don't Do Homework by former U.S. Marine LouAnne Johnson, who took up a teaching position at Carlmont High School in Belmont, California, where most of her students were African-American and Hispanic teenagers from East Palo Alto, a then-unincorporated town at the opposite end of the school district.

The film, starring Michelle Pfeiffer as LouAnne Johnson, was released to mixed critical reception, but became a surprise box office success in the summer of 1995, leading to the creation of a short-lived television series of the same name.
