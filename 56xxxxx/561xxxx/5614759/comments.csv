,gherheart,2010-09-02T05:31Z,"I've done what you said about disable the auto update and i have blocked it using my firewall program. Says it registers fine, but when i click start it says that the register code is wrong. I even tried doing it with my wireless turned off. I had used an older version for months. Then one day it said the same thing. Any ideas of what i may be doing wrong?"
,WillAlvers,2010-10-03T05:34Z,"Rip error!
Open VOBS (VTS_01_1.VOB) failed."
,duvasae,2010-10-23T20:26Z,"same problem as gherheart.
i entered the key and it registered fine. now when i open the programme it asks me for a product key and none of the ones from the text file are valid.
any solutions for this?"
,August18th1973,2010-10-28T00:50Z,"1) Open Regedit

2) Go to Edit -> Find and search for WZD (delete it and WXD) with or without ""Match whole strings only""

3) Also delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ALP\option

Enjoy!"
,August18th1973,2010-10-28T11:16Z,"If program happen to stop working again, open regedit and delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ALP\option again."
,August18th1973,2010-10-28T14:28Z,"In Windows 7, if you cant find ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ALP\option""

Go to Edit -> Find and mark ""Match whole string only"" or not, and then search for ""ALP"" and if it finds option, delete it."
,lentoSINa,2010-12-10T22:52Z,"Works great! Even with new DVDs!!!!!!!!

,LutinVert,2011-02-03T14:47Z,"Well I dont know what to do program stopped working, tried everything august said doesnt work you might want to leave notes that this torrent may only work for a period of time."
,LutinVert,2011-02-03T14:58Z,Garbage! program works great but keys will stop after a day and this is not worth the time in lookin through files and deleting them everyday after it stops working what a bunch of sh!t this program is.
,snip3rvip3r,2011-02-03T20:37Z,"Great Program. Serials worked great, no errors, completely perfect! Currently ripping chicken little lol!"

Will Seed For atleast 3 weeks "
,hdknock,2011-02-27T19:39Z,Kickass!  Works great.  Thanks!
,m2pt5,2011-02-28T22:15Z,The registry path for 64-bit versions of Windows is HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\VirtualStore\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\ALP and delete the 'option' entry
,Quaterman,2011-03-02T01:47Z,Same problem with registry key. Have blocked with ZoneAlarm firewall but it still won't work.
,igorstravin,2011-03-09T18:41Z,"m2pt5, after I reach 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes', there is no 'VirtualStore\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\ALP' after that in my W7 64-bit ."
,FireIsHot,2011-03-10T08:19Z,"Thanks Been Using For Weeks, Got the Reg code Error, Found and deleted the ""option"" thing and it works again:)

Hint: Those unhappy about the quality of their rip when using AVI, you can check the original bit-rate while playing it on PowerDVD9 or VLC and change the Bit-rate in the options for the profile.

It can make a large difference even if it's off just by a few hundred."
,duvasae,2011-03-13T13:34Z,"Thanks August18th1973, works fine now"
,aratron_x,2011-03-15T22:57Z,"deleting option from the registry worked, but you should also change the permissions on the key to deny all users from modifying it, so the software can't rewrite it.  Also, this software won't rip some new dvds."
,diesel_a2s,2011-03-23T07:03Z,thanks works fine
,IoAndTitan,2011-04-30T20:03Z,Magic DVD ripper is the best program for ripping dvd's. !!
,xchaser1031,2011-05-14T23:51Z,Worked perfectly for me!
,cityLife,2011-06-27T22:54Z,DO nOT DOWNLOAD!!! register will work at first.... then when you try and convert a dvd it will say it is invalid X0 P.o.S torrent
,ghandi253,2011-07-07T04:29Z,"Thanks, bigwimpie. Works like a charm. I have used Magic DVD Copier for quite some time, but I have never used this, which is their other product. It works excellently. I am working on uploading some TV shows from a ripped DVD and this program makes it easy as hell because you can tell it to split the AVI files by chapter. Kudos to you."

,cityLife,2011-08-19T02:38Z,"OK LISTEN UP PEOPLE!!!!!
will work only for 8 dvd rips.....

the only way you can get past this is if you rip or convert movies when NOT CONNECTED to the internet..... by dissconnecting internet you may rip or convert as many movies as you like without problems.......L.L TPB"
