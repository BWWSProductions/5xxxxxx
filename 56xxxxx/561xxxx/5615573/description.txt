Here's a pack of Nintendo DS ROMs properly re-named using the AdvanScene dats. All the ROMs from 4801 - 4900 are there and have been checked and verified against CRCs.


All the files are correctly renamed, even the ones inside the zip, just like they should be : )


Enjoy this release, I hope you like it.
