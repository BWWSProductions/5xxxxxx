*Don't worry about the low amount of seeders, topped 4 Mb/s for me with only 65 seeders. Awesome movie.

Prequel of this movie is coming out in 2012: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446714/ aka Prometheus. *"
,Metexie,2012-02-28T12:42Z,Prometheus IS NOT a prequel to Alien
,rondo_h,2012-05-27T05:59Z,Thanks. Never new there was a directors cut to this one!
