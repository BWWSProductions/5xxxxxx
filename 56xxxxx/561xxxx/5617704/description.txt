-- The Film: 116 mins (2003 Director's Cut), 117 mins (1979 Theatrical Release)
Fox approached Ridley Scott to digitally restore and remaster  Alien, and to 
restore several scenes which had been cut during the editing process for 
inclusion in an expanded version of the film. Upon viewing the expanded version, 
Scott felt that it was too long and chose to recut it into a more streamlined 
alternate version.
The "Director's Cut" restored roughly four minutes of deleted footage while 
cutting about five minutes of other material, leaving it actually about a 
minute shorter than the theatrical cut.

-- The Video: Alien has been given a new high-definition film transfer, and is
presented here in full anamorphic widescreen video.
Fox's 2.35:1 anamorphic-widescreen presentation is really something to savor. 
The depth and clarity of this image belie the film's age. Detail is exquisite, 
reaching well into backgrounds, and close-up detail is particularly impressive.
There's some noticeable film grain, but that is completely unavoidable: Ridley 
Scott points out that he was running the anamorphic lenses and film at the 
very edge of their capabilities on some shots, so some grain is inevitable.

-- The Audio: The film was originally made in Dolby Stereo but there was also a 
70MM 6 channel sound version created for the 'roadshow' presentations.
Both the new sound presentations offer a more immersive, rounded audio experience
than the soundtrack on the Alien Legacy set, although the original track was no 
slouch. Both the high and low ends are cleaner, and the surround channels are 
more aggressive. The score moves to the rears more frequently and ambient noise 
is much more interesting.
