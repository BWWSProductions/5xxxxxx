[V],poppedtart,2010-06-09T18:55Z,this supposed to be like hurt locker or something?
,CorE FreaK,2010-06-09T21:58Z,"Hmm, I think it's supposed to be more like Green Zone :OO"
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-10T06:48Z,sounds like something on nickelodeon
,Meuputo,2010-06-10T12:59Z,"Allways you aoloffline..the king
TANX"
,sentientphil,2010-06-12T10:47Z,"Sounds like a room for ""interesting"" plants!  downloading later, will let you know how it goes! although the 340/2823 - seeder/leecher value doesnt look too promising on speed! thats an average of 1g/8t (g)iving for every person (t)aking! if everyones connection was like mine and had 250kb/s'ish connection, 50kb/s for upload, that means the most anyone is going to get is 6.25kb/s!!! its nice when i get people downloading from me at max rates! and not 8 people @ 6.25kb/s each........... cos dont forget you get a limit on ""number of global connections"".. and if your ISP dont like p2p, and im sure large numbers of global connections is what they recognise and throttle??????

do the maths guys (properly and educated... i didnt :D) SEEEEEED GUYS!!!!!!!!! "
,Tortolini,2010-06-12T23:15Z,"Seen the trailer? this is another bourne whatever. 

@ sentientpill: wow, you're a genius! Not downloading because you don't like the seed numbers. Euhmm.. what comes first for a leecher? Downloading or uploading?hmm... i give up. And then you want to give a review when the seed/leech numbers are increased which probably means that everyone has seen it! wow! keep up the good work!"
,venomqman,2010-06-13T13:57Z,"yes you legend, 1080p mkv just under 8gb thats what i'm looking for. thanks"
,sentientphil,2010-06-14T07:23Z,"@ Tortolini

i said i was downloading it LATER... and surely everyone dl'ing should be ul'ing too? so the numbers should be equal at the start?????? i could be wrong, but even if someone has 10kb dl'ed, someone will want it..."
,patrioticparadox,2010-06-14T08:41Z,"i guess pointless dick face is spelled Tortolini.
anywho thanks for the up aoloffline."
,rodan_424,2010-06-14T13:00Z,Yey! I'm the 3000 leach xD
,rodan_424,2010-06-15T00:05Z,"Trust me this is the first time ever I complain about the speed. Seriously guys, I'm getting 16kb/s now if you don't mind helping people."
,denfriis1,2010-06-16T00:14Z,can anyone tell me why it isnt playing well with vlc player?? im using vista.. hope it playes well after convertxtodvd on my dvd player..best regards denfriis
,kpg1970,2010-06-18T08:12Z,just curious if this is in english? it says english subs..
,rodan_424,2010-06-18T13:48Z,"Great upload, took a while to download but worth it! It's in english =) will be seeding for long as I can. "
,Metroidn1f,2010-06-20T02:06Z,"Ya, there is a bit of play back errors, and that is just from scanning through it.  The beginning is fine as I have seen so far with BS Player Pro, but around the 30 min mark that I saw, it got really noisy Video wise, and it was off sync.  I have never complained about aoloffline uploads before, but this one was an okay upload, not as good as his normal ones.

Good work though man.
Thanks.

,the torrent.,2010-06-20T17:15Z,"gosh, unraring: ""bad file""


UÖÖÖ!

Ty anyway"
,venomqman,2010-06-23T12:56Z,"The mkv has soft english subs for the entire film, does it have hardcoded english subs for the non english parts?"
,Metroidn1f,2010-06-30T01:51Z,"Its possible.  It might also be that fact that my screen size is only 1440x900.  I have really never watched or previewed a 1080p video on this pc, I just got it so I can stream it to my 360 because my tv is 1080p.  Will report back."
,c_air_07,2010-07-14T20:52Z,Wish there were more seeds. :(
,KapteinFruit,2010-08-24T00:34Z,Seed please. It takes for every to download!
,nald_dloader,2010-12-26T11:30Z,Please active seeders..
,SuperArmy,2011-01-22T01:34Z,SOOO SLOW!!!! 
,azrash,2012-01-27T06:34Z,thanks for this! i have a seedbox so i would seed at 2MB/s after it has finished downloading for as long as i can
