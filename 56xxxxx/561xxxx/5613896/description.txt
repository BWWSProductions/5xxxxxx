"Makin' Me Fall in Love Again" is the title of a song written by Karyn Rochelle, James T. Slater, and Shane Stevens, and recorded by American country  artist Kellie Pickler. It was released in April 2010 as the fourth single from her self-titled second album.

The music video, which was directed by Roman White, was filmed in Los Angeles, California in April 2010, and premiered on GAC on May 14, 2010 and May 17, 2010 on CMT. In the video, Pickler is shown surrounded by members of the USO, and performing in various outfits that resemble fashions of the 1940s. The video's concept was chosen by Kellie Pickler, because she felt the 1940s celebrated the female figure: "I donâ€™t feel there was a pressure to be skinny and so deathly looking as what the pressure is now. The women were more â€˜womanlyâ€™-looking. They had curves. They had beautiful fair skin. It was just more natural."

"Makin' Me Fall in Love Again" debuted at #53 on the U.S. Billboard  Hot Country Songs chart for the week of May 8, 2010.

"Makin' Me Fall in Love Again" is an up-tempo song, featuring a production with prominent electric guitar. The song's female narrator describes being in love and despite being told that it will fade, she finds the love rejuvenating every moment she spends with him, as if he's "makin' [her] fall in love again" each time.

In an interview with The Boot, Kellie Pickler felt the song was a reflection of her current relationship. She also noted that the song was almost not included on the record: "We were ready to send [the album] off to be mastered and to get it ready to be packaged for the shelves, but ["Makin' Me Fall in Love Again"] just made it barely. I was actually surprised how it did make it on there. I'm glad it did ... It completed the record."

Kellie Pickler is the self-titled second studio album by country artist Kellie Pickler. The lead-off single, "Don't You Know You're Beautiful", was debuted at the 43rd Academy Of Country Music awards and was a Top 25 hit, peaking at #21. The album was released via BNA Records/19 Recordings on September 30, 2008. Since the albums' release, three more singles have charted, "Best Days of Your Life" at #9 (which she co-wrote with fellow country artist and friend Taylor Swift), "Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You" at #14 (a re-recording of Kellie's debut album Small Town Girl) and "Makin' Me Fall in Love Again", which was released to radio on April 19, 2010.
