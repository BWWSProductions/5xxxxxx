Windows 7 Loader v1.8.2 by Daz (x86 & x64)

.zip File Format (Loader)

***********************************************************************************

About:
=======
This is the loader application that's used by millions of people worldwide, well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. The application itself injects a SLIC (Software Licensing Description Table) into your system before Windows boots, this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.

Features:
==========
â€¢ Can be run as a standalone, just move the executable to wherever you like
â€¢ Maintain your own list of serials, future or current (comes with allot of preset keys)
â€¢ Add your own certificates and SLIC's
â€¢ Automatically finds an available drive letter (if required)
â€¢ Installer and uninstaller built in as standard
â€¢ Checks your Windows version and build before install
â€¢ Automatically finds your active boot partition
â€¢ Works on all languages
â€¢ Works alongside hidden partitions
â€¢ Works on Windows 7, Vista and Server 2008 editions
â€¢ Support for bios modded users
â€¢ Argument support for silent installs
â€¢ You can use this tool to activate your Windows 7/Vista ISO by editing setupcomplete.cmd
â€¢ Improves Windows 7 boot time on a Mac
â€¢ Encrypted SLIC support


Advantages:
============
â€¢ Encryption and randomization for your security
â€¢ Byte differences - Everyones GRLDR won't be byte for byte the same
â€¢ Profile matchups - SLIC, certificate and serial that best suits your system
â€¢ Arguments - Can be used to pre-activate your OS
â€¢ Uses custom error checking on near every function making the application much more reliable instead of spitting out files and failing
â€¢ Frankenbuild checking
â€¢ Integrity checking with useful info on screen so the user can verify it
â€¢ External Keys***i support for all OS versions
â€¢ External file support for both SLIC's and certificates
â€¢ Newer GRLDR versions before other applications, thus a greater chance of a successful activation


The rundown:
=============
-This will run on x86 and x64 systems âœ” check
-This can activate all Windows versions at the same time, just install it on each âœ” check
-No core system files get modified âœ” check
-No extra processes are run so you have nothing eating at your RAM âœ” check
-All key parts of the exploit are encrypted with a custom encryption âœ” check
-The exploit runs before Windows so it's harder for Microsoft to prevent âœ” check
-The exploit patches all necessary tables making activation look authentic âœ” check
-The application will select the best profile for your system during installation âœ” check
-Each and every user has a unique version of the exploit installed on his/her system âœ” check

Application integrity checking?
================================
Hover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.

Note: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.
