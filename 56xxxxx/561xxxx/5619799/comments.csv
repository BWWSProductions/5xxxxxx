Is there already a method out there to get this running?"
[V],r3dcat,2010-06-11T15:51Z,"@supagusti: Yes, there is a method now to run Sam&Max:Season1 as well as Sam&Max:Season2 using USB loader. Use Configurable USB Loader alternative .dol method using Disc Plus enhancement (.wdm file). For instructions refer to  http://gwht.wikidot.com/alternate-dol"
