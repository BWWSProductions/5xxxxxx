About this game:
It's a vile world out there. Get too complacent and all sorts of weirdos start coming out of the woodwork. Good thing Sam & Max are here to hose down the sleaze and keep some kind of peace. Violently, if possible. Who are these irreverent crime fighters? Sam's a six-foot tall canine shamus with a love of justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they're a team of freelance police officers, on a mission to take down a bizarre mind-control conspiracy. And they're bringing you along for the fun. Sam & Max are finally back with their hilarious and critically-acclaimed first season of the Sam & Max adventures -- and now, all six episodes of the first season are here in one box to own and enjoy. Experience why the game's bizarre humor, crazy characters, vivid 3D graphics, and exciting gameplay make Sam & Max: Season One the funniest game in years!
