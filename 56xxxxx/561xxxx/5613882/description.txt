"Coco Montoya is one of the reasons people mistakenly think blues is easy music to play. His fierce attack is so expert yet sounds so effortless that it makes you believe anyone armed with 12 bars and six strings can pull it off." -- Billboard. 

"Few blues guitarists performing today can top the intensity of former John Mayall sideman Coco Montoya's torrid, Albert Collins-inspired attack. Shards of shivering, 
feedback-enhanced blue notes fly off the Southern California picker's ax and cut deep into the rhythm section's grooves." -- San Francisco Chronicle. 

"Blistering contemporary blues ... piercing attack; funky, shivery guitar tones; and aggressive, soulful vocals." -- Blues Revue.
