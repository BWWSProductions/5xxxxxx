All arranged by Volume I, Volume II, Volume III: Showstoppers [Deluxe Edition], Power of Madonna, Journey to Regionals, "Other" (the singles that didn't quite fit anywhere else), and by each "back-9" episode title. I trust it's not too confusing.

If there's anything I missed, kindly let me know and I'll see if I can't fix it.





**Edit**

>> Thanks FAII for correcting me. The two Defying Gravity solos were released as iTunes singles and Leaving On A Jet Plane, I Could Have Danced All Night, and I Wanna Sex You Up were in fact Target Exclusive tracks for Glee, The Music: Volume I.

>> NOTE: The files are still organized as described, I only changed the text of the torrent description to better break down the origin of a few specific tracks.
