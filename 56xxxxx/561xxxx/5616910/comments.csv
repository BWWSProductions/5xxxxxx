,Slykwylie,2010-06-10T00:49Z,"Sorry LubeGuy, that was me. It should be up and running again.

And Hojo I feel your pain. I'll be seeding for at least a few weeks to keep the ball rolling. It doesn't help that there seems to be 276 leechers to the one seeder -___-"
,FAII,2010-06-13T09:19Z,"Several of the songs you've listed as ""never officially released"" were actually officially released. The two solo versions of ""Defying Gravity"" were released as iTunes singles IIRC and ""I Wanna Sex You Up"", ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" and ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" were released as tracks 18-20 on the Target Exclusive version of ""Glee: The Music, Volume 1""."
,Slykwylie,2010-06-14T08:42Z,"Thanks FAII, I'll update that right now"
,Joe17Pro,2010-06-16T17:25Z,The two 'Defying Gravity' solos and 'Leaving On A Jet Plane' played on vlc but not on itunes... what up with that?
