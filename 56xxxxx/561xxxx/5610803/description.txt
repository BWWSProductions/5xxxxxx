The inhabitants of the ocean include innumerable weird and wonderful species. Mankind also likes to dip its toes into the water on occasion, especially when war comes calling. Dr. Robert Ballad is an expert on the military occupancy of the ocean at wartime, having discovered the Titanic, and served as a naval intelligence officer.

Using a mixture of animation and old footage, Ballad illustrates how military operations have been carried out underseas. Cold War submarines, the SOSUS (a sound surveillance system deployed by the Navy), and many other aspects of the war underwater are discussed and illustrated throughout, making this a fascinating and informative insight into military operations that take place beneath the depths.
