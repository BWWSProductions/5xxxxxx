In the first volume of this gritty revenge saga written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, an assassin (Uma Thurman) is shot at the altar by her ruthless employer, Bill (David Carradine), and other members of their assassination circle. But "The Bride" lives to plot her vengeance. Setting out for some payback, she makes a death list and hunts down those who wronged her (including a one-eyed Daryl Hannah), saving Bill for last.
