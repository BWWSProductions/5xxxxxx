,Kellso76,2010-06-10T09:50Z,LOL....I didn't mean any disrespect to you PT. I figured you wouldn't mind since you gave me the trackers to use. 
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-10T18:41Z,"no, i just laughed ;-)  I plan on checking these out soon but I haven't gotten to it yet."
,Kellso76,2010-06-10T22:07Z,LOL LOL......Thx for the advice BTW. When you check em out let me know what you think. Maybe we can be fans of each other..... ;-)
,kingaza,2010-06-29T18:11Z,"sorry, when i use real player to play it the subtitles are cut off, and since ive seen KB before, they are very important, any help on this? no change in resolution helps, which is kind of frustrating, guess ill have to convert to dvd to watch on tv? brilliant quality and thanks for bringing my all time favourite movies back!"
,kingaza,2010-07-05T15:24Z,"its a serious issue and since i dont have any of the consoles u tested on cuz im a computer geek, and it doesnt work on DVD players, its super dissapointing."
,kingaza,2010-07-05T18:05Z,"ok i spent a good 2 hours converting to a DVD player compatible file, and the subtitles are STILL cut off. dont dl this incredibly high quality rip unless uve seen the movie before and dont care to see the japanese, chinese or french translations"
