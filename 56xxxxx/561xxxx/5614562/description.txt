Pamela and Mervyn are children of the sixties, frivolous and free. But the former lovers are now middle aged business partners trying to get with it and make a success of their vodka and veggie cyber cafe. 

Getting Nowhere Fast centres around the relationship between Pam and Merv. They run a cafe together and despite the fact that Pam has seemingly moved on in her life, she has re-married and left behind her free spirited days of love-ins and protesting for a better world with Merv there is obviously a part of her that still finds Merve optimism alluring.

She has a rich, albeit absent husband, yet yearns for the wild abandon that she and Merv once shared. Of course she would never admit this to Merv. The cafÃ© symbolises their relationship: a thing of the past that is in desperate need of being brought up to date and re-assessed. Hence their decision to try to attract a new breed of customers who are conversant with cyber technology. 

The cafe has a rather eclectic mix of regulars, from Dibden - the retired thespian who, much to the chagrin of those around him, quite literally believes all the worlds a stage - to Neville, possibly the most unstreetwise 28 year old you are likely to meet.
