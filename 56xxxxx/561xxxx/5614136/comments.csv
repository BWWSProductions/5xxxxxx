,Jahorse,2010-06-12T10:04Z,Seems to be the best sounding rip I have found
,tnas11,2010-06-13T11:05Z,"haha, its okay:
thats because all groups rip the cd at VBR (variable bit rate), each song varies in bit rate they dont have a constant rate but their average was 192 (this time it was lucky that it was 192kbps, like the CBR) u are talking about CBR where all songs are at a constant bit rate :D

these are the rules for the groups

and yeah this is the best rip, if you want proof:

,ZZraviZZ,2011-01-26T17:09Z,"This is a real good copy, Thanks for the Upload, Don't think about the bit rate too much, It creates only a small difference, It's not a difference if you use it for home purpose."
