,omegaalpha74,2010-06-09T13:36Z,"I see what you mean, these are english dub episodes though"
,omegaalpha74,2010-06-10T19:50Z,"Some people enjoy it in English as I do, I get tired of reading subtitles, lets try to be optimistic here, some of us just like an anime once in a while, we don't precisely have to be an Otaku to see anime. This torrent is for that type of audience and others, We have to upload something for the community every once in a while my friend, what have you have to give?"
,ThePalindorme,2010-06-10T22:32Z,"what the fuck are you talking about? ???? boring?????
jesus, this is fma here, the most well dubbed anime in history, yet you still dont want to watch it in english.
Ive seen many animes, and in most of them if there was a decent dubbing company, like funimation, watching the eng dub was way more better than watching the jap dub with subtitles"
,opiepies,2010-06-11T05:56Z,It would be great if you could through another 10 up! I have already watched them and really appreciate that you have put them up. i am currently seeding them at my max rate. :D
,omegaalpha74,2010-06-11T22:31Z,"@opiepies..thanks for the support, i will upload them by this weekend if I have time if not, dont worry they will be up by this upcoming week

@Palindorme - yes very well dubbed cartoon!"
,XHandHeld,2010-06-15T04:46Z,thanks for uploading this will seed for 2 weeks.
,LupinVII,2010-06-16T21:18Z,"I greatly appreciate this upload, as its hard to find some good anime in english dub, but would it be possible for you to increase the quality a bit? They look a little blurry on my 19 inch monitor, I shudder to think how they're going to look on my 40 inch lcd tv."
,XHandHeld,2010-06-17T23:19Z,"can you please upload episodes 11-20

will seed for a while"
,ilyXxStyLoxX,2010-06-22T22:58Z,"Upload the rest, please..."
,moondaughter72,2010-06-23T03:00Z,"Hi everyone!
I downloaded it, 
converted it for ""Home Theater"" using Visual Hub and saved it to DVD. 
It looks AWESOME on my HDTV! :-)"
,LupinVII,2010-06-26T10:58Z,"As it turns out it doesnt look too bad on my hdtv. Its not HD or anything, but its better quality than I expected with the file size. I stand corrected. Whens the next batch coming out?"
,haloddr,2010-07-04T04:53Z,thanks for these omega!  I like to watch with the english dubs and you're the only one that uploads them.  Please upload more episodes when you get a chance.
,faphappycat,2010-07-05T08:28Z,"Thanks so much for the upload! Looking forward to the next 10.

How fast are these being finished, by the way? I'd like to know when to check back, roughly."
,Zakuti,2010-07-13T00:33Z,"Hello! first of, i love you for uploading this. but i noticed this has become... dead? FMA is one of the very few animes i Actually watch after dubbed. Funimation does a good job! I\'m wondering if you gave up? :( happen to know where i can get the next 50 or so dubbed episodes? :D"
,Judwig,2010-07-30T07:40Z,"Thanks for uploading, please upload the next episodes!"
[T],MrDowntown,2010-08-05T21:40Z,Thank You so much :D Please upload the next batch as soon as possible and post link here
,MajorEliteKing,2010-08-06T16:43Z,"downloading now, ive been looking for the english dub for a couple days thank you"
,Ryrynz,2010-08-11T09:22Z,"Getting artifacts occasionally, seems to have encoding errors? Any chance of a higher resolution in the future release without the errors?"
,patriot76,2010-08-18T14:59Z,"I would appreciate it if you would upload the rest of the FMA Brotherhood series with English dubs.  I don't mind watching them with Jap dubs and English subs, but I grew up on the first series having English dubs.  I am sure the rest of your seeders agree that the rest should be posted and I am sure you would up your seed count a lot if you did so.

Thanks."
,bta72dolphins,2010-08-26T21:17Z,"Ok i have never seed before but i just finish FMA the one from 2003 and watch the movie i loved it i want to so badly watch all the brotherhood ones.

 So to seed you save and after it is complete you keep it up so other downloaders have a quicker time with it right. 

And also what are to file in the .rar are they avi? also how does the vid and audio like.. good?"
,bta72dolphins,2010-08-27T10:26Z,This works perfect.. Just watch it on my xbox. Finally figure out how to seed. Will be seed all your stuff untill you are finish and i hardly ever turn off my pc. Good work!
,OXTANE,2010-09-19T20:03Z,I TRULY DONT CARE... AS LONG AS I UNDERSTAND....... BUT MY BRO WANTS IT IN ENGLISH... SO I REALY REALY NEED THEM NEXT TEN OR 20 LOL..... THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD.... KEEP DOIN YO THANG.. FUCK THESE OTHER MOFO'S
,proseandpoetry,2010-09-26T05:48Z,"""then still... if you watch this in english as i tried to its boring. the whole concept about Japanese cartoons is taken away :) "" 

That is quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Seriously.  It's the SAME EXACT SHOW in English, you just have some misguided love for Japan like all of the over-obsessed anime kids.  Please, just fucking move there already and leave all of us alone. 

Thanks for the upload though, I watched the episode subbed as they were coming out and it gets pretty old."
,mokehaole,2010-10-09T04:12Z,"Hey I love FMA but I just can't watch the Japanese versions, my ADD or something makes it impossible to be able to focus on the plot and action of the film and read the subtitles at the same time. I had a very fast download at around .5mbps and I'll def seed as well, just hoping you could upload all the other episodes man!"
,omegaalpha74,2010-11-11T05:13Z,"im sorry about not posting the rest ive been extremely busy these past months, but i will now load the rest of the episodes all the way to the ending...thanks for the uploading! expect release by tonite"

,pingui09,2010-11-20T06:50Z,"i'd like to add smth to the discussion...
i loove anime, but this one in particular just SUCKS in jap audio, and they did a great job at the english 
dubbed version.. so i actually prefer it

and to those who say we who prefer it this way are stupid.. i just want to say that its a matter of taste
let people choose what they want, like we let you"
,The3vilM0nk3y,2011-01-17T00:33Z,i just extracted files and its not brotherhood. its just FMA. Y mislabel and mislead me like this.
,Deckard_Cain,2012-04-15T12:12Z,"Thanks alot dude. Would have been sweet if they weren't in a rar file so we could download them one at a time...
No worries though, thanks again!"
