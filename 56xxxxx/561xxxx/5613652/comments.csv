,midurix,2010-06-08T16:33Z,One of the best movies I have ever seen! Love james carrey anyway but in this he's fantastic!
,Twopenceworthless,2010-06-14T11:38Z,"Quality great for this medium. 
Movie? Definately a step backwards  for these actors. 
Story line? Even though based on a true story ... disappointing. "
,ptfg,2010-06-18T09:34Z,"Unwatchable on Flatscreen TV with Blu-Ray player,
horrible block-building. Plays fine on PC, but who wants to watch this on a small monitor? Not correctly encoded. Thanks anyway for your effort."

This is 10 times smaller than BluRay. Are you crazy? If you want I-see-hair-in-the-nose-of-the-actor quality, get the 40GB one!"

I just streamed this straight to my 50"" LED TV and it was great!
Like ""aand"" said before me its not going to be as good as an untouched Blu-Ray rip, if you want them you will have to wait a while as they are around 40GB and rarely have more than a few seeds so they can take over a week to completely download.
Its not unwatchable you either did something wrong when burning it to disc or your just WAY to pickie!!

""Based on the description I give it""
Video= 9/10
Audio= 9/10
Movie= 5/10

Cheers for another great upload :-)"
