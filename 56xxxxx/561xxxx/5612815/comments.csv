,tjack360,2010-06-08T07:01Z,Hey there. I use the (PiZ) encoding tool by HolyRoses and I was trying to figure out how to deinterlace my captured videos. I like using PiZ and I don't want to use anything else. Thanks.
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-08T07:08Z,"it automatically deinterlaces DVD source, but if its not detecting that you will have to browse through the source and find the correct 

$coder_line =

statement for your profile and add -deinterlace to it.

or modify the code to detect your specific type of video and set the $deinterlace variable correctly.  just search for deinterlace in the code and you should find it."
,tjack360,2010-06-08T09:54Z,Thanks dude. I appreciate it.

,tjack360,2010-06-09T02:23Z,"LMAO! I had no idea poppedtart was you, HR. Did you get a job yet? I hope so. I tried to get you on yahoo IM last night but I guess you were busy. I am staying away from the high res PSP encodes. I find it to be overkill. I love PiZ for Windows, btw. I made a copy of the PiZ_encode app and use one for progressive sources and one for interlaced (wintv caps) sources. Any plans for an update?"

[V],poppedtart,2010-06-15T21:17Z,thats what the zoom option on your psp is for.
,TwoLOUD,2010-09-13T02:53Z,"Zooms makes it worse then a vhs screener, but then again if I liked watching chopped off heads at the top you could zoom, NO, answer is NO you cannot zoom"
