does this game also work on Windows 7?"
,MitsEvX,2010-10-31T13:47Z,"Hey, I've tested this with XP without any problems. I don't know for sure, but I think it will work! Otherwise there are a lot of ways trying to run it:

* Right click on the Rayman 2 shortcut --> properties --> compatibility mode (try for example XP)
* I've also got some experience with changing resolutions. For example choose 800 x 600 or in the compatibility mode, choose 640 x 480.
* You may also choose for a minimum rather than a maximum installation.

I hope you can get it work with or without above options ;-)

If there aren't enough seeds, ask me! ;-) Good luck!"
