,tspike,2010-06-10T10:42Z,Any chance we can get this with split files please?
,nac30,2010-06-11T23:11Z,"You could split it yourself - with EAC, for example..."
,Eizo47,2011-02-13T16:01Z,Thx!!!!
,User897,2011-11-30T05:42Z,"This effort is much appreciated, but having to separate the tracks is a pain in the ass.  It doesn't take more effort on the ripper's part to separate them, so not doing so is just senseless."
,User897,2011-11-30T20:28Z,"Every attempt to open these in EAC has failed, stating that the format is not accepted.  So, I just downloaded 2.99GB of horseshit.

Very disappointing."
,User897,2011-11-30T22:46Z,"Okay, I figured out how to split these tracks.  It's a pain in the ass, but here goes:

Use dBPoweramp to convert the single FLAC file into a single WAV file.  You have to do this because EAC will not work otherwise.

Open EAC and go to Tools.  Select Split WAV by CUE Sheet.  Double click the single WAV file, then double click the WAV CUE file, NOT the FLAC CUE file.

It will then split the tracks into individual WAV files.  The ID tags will be blank so it is up to you to fill them.

I hope this helps some of you out there that might not have downloaded this otherwise.  To nac30, I am very grateful to you for sharing, but PLEASE don't rip a CD like this again!  :)"

my 2 cents..."
,MixedUpZombie,2012-03-09T18:01Z,"what the fuck man? no split FLAC files? LOL like what are we supposed to do, skip to our favorite song like animals? this isn't the 40's. "
