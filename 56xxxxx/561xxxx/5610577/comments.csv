This version of Peter Jackson?s Fellowship Of The Ring brings out the best of this awesome movie, trying to improve on something that?s already great.
The edit gives some more depth to the characters, in particular Aragorn and Boromir. It is not intended of bringing this closer to the books, but to build on what works in the movies themselves."
