Wikipedia............: Bob cuts a deal with Mrs. Dabney that if he chops down their tree that blocks her sunlight, she will stop her dog from barking. The tree, which houses PJ and Teddyâ€™s childhood treehouse, has sentimental value, so they stage a sit-in protest to prevent it from getting chopped down. When Bob does everything he can to get them out of the treehouse, Amy sides with her kids and joins their protest.
