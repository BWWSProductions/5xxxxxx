,Carl777,2010-06-14T14:41Z,"FAKE!!! FAKE !! Guys, Titanic has NOT been released on blu ray as yet...James Caremon himself has not released Titanic on blu ray, what is this shit???? Guys, please read on the internet, read what James Cameron himself has to say, read what Amazon also has to say...that the Titanic blu ray is one of the molst anticipated bluray releases, and a release is expected in 2011....this is at best an HDTV release, I've checked the print, its NOT BLU RAY AT ALL.."
,ahl07,2010-06-14T23:50Z,"@carl777
This is a HD Rip of titanic. This is not fake. it is proper and real and if u dont like it plz dont download. no one is begging u to download it."
,Torrentreporter,2010-06-15T04:46Z,"Great Torrent......
But size is toooo long....and seeders are only 1 .........

Quality is superb"
,Carl777,2010-06-15T09:48Z,"@ahl07...hi, I don't mean to be rude, but thats exactly what I'm saying. The rip is great, but is a HD rip ( maybe HDTV or HDDVD) but its NOT BLURAY...your topic post says Brrip, which is bluray rip...and the display picture shows the titanic poster aroun a blu ray disc, to give the impression that its blu ray...its a great ip, a great HD rip, but not a blu ray rip as the tpoci post suggests..Thanks"
