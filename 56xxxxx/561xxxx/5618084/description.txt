First published in August 1992, this book helps NA members focus on a new recovery principle every day. Each of the 366 daily entries open with an NA quote, examines the day's topic, and closes with a focusing thought or affirmation

I created this e-book using mobipocket creator.  My source files was a torrent of the Just for Today Meditations in .html file seperated by month.  I combined the files into one ebook.

Seed this torrent as long as possible, because "we can't keep what we have unless we give it away".
