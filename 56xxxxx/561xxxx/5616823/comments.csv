Video is great Audio is great, the subtitles sync up correctly and even though this is a dubbed version I honestly didn't mind that much (probably because Jackie Chan does his own voice rather than the usual annoying sounding white people that normally dub these kinds of movies lol xD)....anyway thank you very much uploader =) I definitely recommend this torrent!....I will seed for a while"
