The year is 1984, and on the rural East Coast of New Zealand â€œThrillerâ€ is changing kidsâ€™ lives. Inspired by the Oscar nominated "Two Cars, One Night", "Boy" is the hilarious and heartfelt coming-of-age tale about heroes, magic and Michael Jackson.

Boy is a dreamer who loves Michael Jackson. He lives with his brother Rocky, a tribe of deserted cousins and his Nan.

Boyâ€™s other hero, his father, Alamein, is the subject of Boyâ€™s fantasies, and he imagines him as a deep sea diver, war hero and a close relation of Michael Jackson (he can even dance like him). In reality heâ€™s â€œin the can for robberyâ€.

When Alamein returns home after 7 years away, Boy is forced to confront the man he thought he remembered, find his own potential and learn to get along without the hero he had been hoping for.
