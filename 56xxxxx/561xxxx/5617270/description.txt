In New York City in 1991, an 11-year-old girl named Ally Craig witnesses the murder of her mother on a New York City Subway platform, on the F Line at the 18th Avenue and McDonald Avenue elevated station in Brooklyn. She is shot in the chest by two muggers trying to rob her. Ten years later, Ally (Emilie de Ravin) is a student at New York University who lives at home with her overprotective detective father, Neil (Chris Cooper).

Tyler Hawkins (Robert Pattinson), a moody, directionless 21 year-old is auditing classes at NYU and working in a bookstore. He has had a strained relationship with his businessman father, Charles (Pierce Brosnan) since his brother Michael's suicide. Charles appears to lack concern for Tyler's younger sister, Caroline (Ruby Jerins), with whom Tyler is very close.
