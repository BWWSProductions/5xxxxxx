Uplifting and inspiring, Tom Butler-Bowdon is back with this much-anticipated third volume in the Nicholas Brealey line of "50 Classics". 50 Spiritual Classics continues the tradition of highlightingâ€”for the first time in one bookâ€”the most powerful life-changing ideas found in the very best spiritual works that have stood the test of time. From mega-bestsellers to 1st Century writings, stories of personal journeys to biographies of spiritual leaders through the ages, Butler-Bowdon places each work into its historical context and offers insightful commentary on how these classics can help spiritual seekers everywhere bring personal beliefs, values and practices squarely into the center of their every day lives.
