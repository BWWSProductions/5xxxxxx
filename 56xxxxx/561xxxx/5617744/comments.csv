[V],Mbb15,2010-06-10T00:52Z,globeplus are you gonna do mario galexy and other nintendo wii games? I would like that thanks :)
,r2007uk,2010-06-10T00:54Z,How does one emulate the use of a wii remote control using a keyboard? I know some wii games are not so reliant on movement of the control but I don't see how you could reproduce that with.. arrow keys?
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T01:18Z,"To Mbb15 : Thank you for your interpelation and i was deeply studing the wii games on the pc and i found marvellous all the nice work that is possible to do with the wii isos but not all the games can be easy to work even this one , only after applying a perfect patch on the emulator was possible to get the correct gameplay , this game have a totally appropriate emulator thinking in the gameplay on this particular game , in some other games the convencional emulator can be ok and in some others the work can be condicionated difficulting the work , the true is independtly of i can do a nice work or not i am depending a little bit in the original wii iso that i get and of course if it ok working on the emulator , the suggestion is interesting and i can take a look probably but let´s give at least a couple of days to this one that is certainly a very nice game and i get a real perfect work dropping the wii iso size for less than 3 gb and i included a 128 mb memory card for the emulator too , remember that is obrigatory having a 4.37 gb iso after extraction for a wii game , is really positive work drop the 3 gb with the compression work with an absolute correct work not changing anything and respecting 100% all the gameplay including information videos about the conception work of the game .
It was for me simply a lovely experience , getting deeply in the wii cene but i don´t regret a single minute of this experience ...
Thank you for your comment ."

I like you emulator work globe (wii/ps2) hope you will continue that and thanks for all your work :)"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T01:49Z,"To r2007 uk : 

My fellow user it is amazing the conception of this emulator , you can use the real thing or with the correct configuration play the game with normal keys of the keybord like you usually get for the pc games , the wii games have normal nice graphics and the way the game is available on the emulator absolutly sweet , just really nice playing wii isos with this emulator , maybe not the all the games is possible to play or work but certainly a positive percentage of wii games that you can use in this emulator .
playing this prince of persia game with this file :
ABSOLUTLY HIGHLY RECOMENDABLE WITHOUT ANY FAVOUR ON THAT !!! "
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-06-10T01:58Z,"Wow, dude you're truly amazing!
Are you doing this on your own?"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T02:05Z,"To Mbb15 : certainly is a nice site with lot of games but they are not exactly pratical to get , thank you for your suggestion .
The basic idea working thisgame was above of all to have this game with nice gameplay available soon as possible to the pc users because i really feel that the pc version is taken time and i already get in my blog a few comments asking when it will be possible to work the pc version of this game , so i decide to take a look and here i am with a fantastic and appropriate for this game , the true is that is nice to have 1 more nice option with the wii games to work games that the general pc users want to play soon as possible and preferencially in the more pratical way possible , when it justifies i can work for wii isos specially in periods without too many new nice pc games but of course that the games to be worked must be more interesting as possible and the work normal with thw wii iso to get the best pratical file as possible for everyone be happy getting the file ."
[V],Mbb15,2010-06-10T02:29Z,"globe, its an release site, you will find games moslty 2 hours later here on TPB or usenet :) it is just for showing which games you can download for Wii, PC etc."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T03:42Z,"To Mbb15 : i think i can get 1.29 gb for super mario galaxi 2 , you think it is a nice size for this game ? very pratical stuff , complete game but i can´t do better for the moment , what you think ?"
,Ramsay21,2010-06-10T05:26Z,"Thanks alot mate, could you also put prince of persia the forgotten sands actual pc game torrent here on TPB incase if it is released already.

Btw, I was wondering looking at the gameplay of prince of persia the forgotten sands wii version is totally different from prince of persia the forgotten sands xbox 360 version. What will be the prince of persia the forgotten sands pc version gameplay then. Also could u let us know how will we control movements in this modded version for pc = simply by keyboard and assigning the desired keys perhaps? Thanks alot once again. ^_^"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T07:25Z,"I have complete instructions inside the file but for curiosity i can say that one of the toughests things on the emulator that is very nice is really to find the correct configuration to the keys simulating wiimote and the nunchuk , the 2 wii tools together don´t make to the emulator user , the configuration of the keys an easy task and analising for this thinking we will get for the essencial keys in the way that i configurated the tradicional in pc games w,s,a,d keys for movement and the cursor keys for action keys basically , then it is only one or another suplementary key that a game can use that you can choose for yourself , so what happen here ? a tough configuration set of keys turned in a very simple set of keys even more easy mayby and that with the necessary respect than the reall wiimote and nunchuck that with pratical is ok but never simple as that .
I have to finish this comment saying that is OBRIGATORY for this particular game have the emulator the way i have on this file because i have a necessary patch correctly applied on the emulator , for example if you download the latest version of the emulator and you want to use the wii iso you get stucked on the loading screen never reaching the menu , so it is really obrigatory to play this game to have the emulator like i have to play with normality ."

[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T17:08Z,"To jls14 : i think you changed anything in the configuration , if you get any type of problem just extract again the emulator and try again because that is really not usual .
To everyone : if the pc version is ok i will try to do the correct work but i repeat this is a ubisoft game that can have a drm online .
To klicko94 : i already said in a before comment that the graphics are very nice , watching the wwii version of this game was a nice surprise to me : normal gameplay , nice graphics , sweet emulator ... no problems !!! Just the game .
To NarutoNamikaze : i don´t know if it is really needed the directx web installer , i didn´t realize that and everyone probably already have a directx ,9 ,10 ,11 but if necessary please download him and play ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T17:16Z,"Just to remember again that this is the only file with the game WORKING 100% WITHOUT A SINGLE PROBLEM , even in real nice concept files some guys of the concorrence in the pc files simply make an effort to don´t loose the bad habit , no matter how fantastic is the conception of the file is to put negative votes , i certainly don´t believe that any real user of this file in his conscience have a valid reason whatsoever to put a negative vote .
To play this game without beeing stucked at the menus the emulator is needed like i have in this file .
Please , enjoy your game everyone but i had to say something because this mentionated guys looks incorrigble ."

,jls_14,2010-06-10T17:37Z,globeplus it didn't work again. it says that the wiimote 1 has been disconnected and maybe this game doesn't support multi-wiimote. Any ideas???

,NarutoNamikaze,2010-06-10T18:59Z,"@ globeplus

Of course the lateset Direct X version is not required for this particular game. But it is required for some other games like Split Second. For me it showed the error that D3DX9_42.dll was missing and I had to updtae DX.

In most of the isoes direct x is automatically installed. But in Rips it has to be manually isntalled. The TPTB rip has included the installer in their rips and it updates direct x from the net.

Some users may not understand what the problem is. So it would be good to include the installer. Its below 500 KB.

Anyway its a suggestion."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T20:22Z,"To NarutoNamikaze : i had the feeling that the possible problems it is always something to do it with that guys , anything they do looks like a real intelligent thing or something , the only thing they can´t show is more competent work than me and that it is also true ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-10T20:33Z,"The PC russian version is available now to download for 5.52 gb but no crack !!! and we are talking about a ubisoft drm online that need to be worked and that can mean a undefined time to have the pc version ok to play or not , i remember that for assassin´s creed 2 was more than a month and with the server emulator , to the splinter cell conviction , looked tough for few days but finally a nice worked execuitable comes out skipping the use of the server emulator , the question is : what can happen now on this one ?"
,yudhistir,2010-06-10T21:52Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS , Yes I was able to make it work , Yes I was able to move using WSAD but NO I was NOT able to play the game since the controls are not fully configured , There is NO Key to Attack with your sword , if there is then I guess globeplus failed to specify it , tried going into the configurations and tried all the keys but no help , the prince just doesnt fight , he runs , jumps , runs on walls but does not fight"

i am only a little bit disappointed how a file with the correct work can decrease so much in number ofr seeds and with everything ok , this type of correct work with nice size is not appreciated anymore ? the file start the day with more 300 seeds and now if have 100 is luck or something but i repeat : working 100% ok immediatly and with the emulator prepared and configurated is no other file , at least my conscience is ok , but not treating ok nice work is not a great philosophy .
Sorry for this quick comment but i simply don´t get it , with so many new users of the file during the day and the file decreased more than 200 seeds in a day , i just ask to myself , what i did wrong for this happen , but it is ok ."

Actually i had downloaded your Split Second Rip and it had required a DX update. And man makes mistakes. So sometimes TPTB does make mistakes. If you don't include the installer then also its no problem (well at least for me)....
