,maxicastro,2010-06-10T01:06Z,"Hi and thanks a lot for everything!

I wonder if you have any version of Der Rote Baron (The Red Baron) on DVD with at least Spanish subs  (though it would be great if it had Spanish audio too). It's a 2008 German movie I can't find anywhere on DVD with Spanish audio/subs. There are 2 torrents here with Dutch subtitles, which would be great if I spoke Dutch, but I don't :D"

,maxicastro,2010-06-15T18:16Z,"@ tater44: It's fine for me, thanks so much. I will wait for it.

I've been also looking for Hidalgo and Dances with Wolves on DVD. In case anyone has them, it would be just wonderful, highly appreciated and seeded."
