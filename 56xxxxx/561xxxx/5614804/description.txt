RemoveWAT 2.2.5 - A safer activation solution.

WORKS ON ALL EDITIONS OF WINDOWS 7

NOT FOR VISTA/XP!!!!


This is a little tool I put together to remove WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, whilst still retaining genuine status and receiving all updates (optional as well). You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender.

There will be no windows activation section in control panel.

NOTE:It will remove the system properties page and the page will display the message "THE PAGE FAILED TO LOAD",but it wont affect ur pc n u can update windows easily without being caught from Microsoft.

In theory this should have a 100% success rate on all machines.

1:open setup file to use

Please Seed.

Thanks..

Enjoy!
