,noOrp,2010-06-10T20:25Z,"@ PT

I'm getting this error when re-muxing with MKV-Merge


this has never happened in any of your prev. rips....so thought I should let u know, incase u have changed ur encoding settings...



Warning: 'Remember.Me.BRRIP.MP4.x264.720p-PT\Remember Me (HD).m4v' track 1: The AVC video track is missing the 'CTTS' atom for frame timecode offsets. However, AVC/h.264 allows frames to have more than the traditional one (for P frames) or two (for B frames) references to other frames. The timecodes for such frames will be out-of-order, and the 'CTTS' atom is needed for getting the timecodes right. As it is missing the timecodes for this track might be wrong. You should watch the resulting file and make sure that it looks like you expected it to."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-10T20:44Z,nothing changed.  did you upgrade your mkvmerge?
[V],Team_xRG,2010-06-10T21:04Z,"havent downloaded this

[V],poppedtart,2010-06-10T21:08Z,"movie plays perfect in vlc, both audio tracks.  nothing changed on my end.  plays on my apple tv too, so I assume its ok.  That could be strange warning message."
,noOrp,2010-06-10T22:24Z,"@ PT

tried with both 3.3 & 4.0 ..the latest version....

same warning...

it's something to do with the P / B-frames number selected in Encoding Profile Settings....


Checked with VLC / K-Lite plays fine...no glitch...even a/v is in sync .... I hope it works well even on my WD HD Player...it mostly will....


although it's strange this has never happened...even the one right before this....'She's out of my league' muxed well..."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-10T23:10Z,"ok, well nothing changed here at all, i run exact same software for a long time and i just run the script, it doe the same crud over and over...  maybe something to do with this source or movie.  my software doesn't auto update as its very nonstandard, so i would have to go out of my way on purpose to make any change like that."
,noOrp,2010-06-10T23:40Z,"half-way thru on WD ...playing fine...

so as of now ...warning ignored...


Thanks, PT :)"
