,robinonley,2010-06-10T19:05Z,How do you take screenshots of a bootable iso? / windows xp setup.
,Flazhp0intX,2010-06-10T21:21Z,You can take a screenshot of your release by loading your *.iso image in to a virtual machine. For example Virtual Machine or VMWare. Then you can show your leechers what you're exactly releasing.
,erika12,2010-06-10T21:26Z,thank you will test it
,robinonley,2010-06-10T21:44Z,"I really cant be arsed to learn how to set up a virtual box . Its free it works well and does what it says if you dont want to download it then dont

If you want a screenshot go buy the product the original product has photos on the cd case :)"

,med8cal,2010-06-11T20:49Z,"Yeah, downloaded twice, burned twice won't load on two diff. systems,  really wanted this to work :("
,Badmana,2010-06-12T18:15Z,This ISO doesn't seem to have the setup executable in the root directory. Can't boot off the CD and can't start the install.
,brizzle198688,2010-06-13T03:09Z,"try recreating this iso with nlite, should fix the boot problem"
,brizzle198688,2010-06-13T04:44Z,i got it to work! just add the setup file on any xp pro install disk to directory of this and there you have it!
,robinonley,2010-06-14T12:51Z,Thanks brizzle198688 for the feedback. I will remake this and re upload. Iv stopped seeding this torrent
,mrcr0wley,2010-06-15T23:49Z,"Do you know when you will remake this torrent?
Thanks!"
,brizzle198688,2010-06-19T10:54Z,"glad i can help, thanx for this version of xp....its great"
,mald_guy,2010-06-20T18:48Z,"I downloaded it, but the ISO is still not bootable. Waste of bandwidth, which I have to pay for.  BTW it would be a good idea to include an MD5 checksum."
,robinonley,2010-08-17T14:30Z,"I apologize for the issue. This will be remade today and a new torrent added with a similar title
Thanks"
,Sakunne,2010-09-06T00:37Z,"robinonley, is it ok now - bootable ???"
,ZariusCorten,2010-12-10T10:02Z,"After copying the files in the .iso to a new folder, copying the Setup file from my personal windows XP disc into the file, and then rebuilding the folder into a new bootable .iso with nLite, the install works perfectly. If anyone's having issues with it not working, try that. Also, love the background during installation, far more entertaining than the regular XP install background :D"
