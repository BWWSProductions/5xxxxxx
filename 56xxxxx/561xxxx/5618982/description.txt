This is the best version of windows xp pro sp3 around.

It originally started when a backup disk of xp was brought and from there the untouched iso was stripped down "removed junk like messenger" error reporting ,tour
and added sp3.

Then we got our hands on a bulk install key which is licensed to to installed on as many machines as the company wanted.

I brought the product key and it is embedded in this download.

I have made this unattended so that you do not have to babysit the installation and you will not have to enter a product key "its already programed in"

Just download and burn the iso to cd using nero or ultraiso or droptocd
