,mickepicke63,2010-06-06T13:24Z,ingen som har denna med svenskt tal?  lägg gärna upp den i så fall. tack på förhand.
,gorgang,2010-06-16T21:12Z,"This is a beautiful copy. Unfortunately, Starchild666 hard coded the Swedish subs into the English speaking film, and this destroys the enjoyment for those who don't speak or want to read that noble language. Shame on you!"
,gorgang,2010-06-16T21:15Z,"In fact, Starchild666 has done this to all of his offerings. What a jerk."
[V],Starchild666,2010-06-17T19:51Z,"You have wrong, i have done it for swedish people to  enjoy the movie not for me...Thasts lot of versions whitout any subs... And i am a female"
,gorgang,2010-06-18T04:43Z,"Ok, starchild, sorry for the rant. Just know that when people take a bit of time to download a film, hardcoded subs are really not desired. Why couldn't you have putout the film as it comes on a dvd: with a user-selectable sub track."
[V],Starchild666,2010-08-16T11:06Z,"Because, i know theres MANY that steals both the movie and the subtitle and takes credits for the translation =/"
,grabb3r,2011-01-21T14:12Z,"Thanks for the movie! :)

gorgang: If other countries can hardsub a movie, why can´t swedish people do it? tsss..
pms."
,segaGman,2011-04-20T13:54Z,Starchild666 i don't care about subtitles. this is a great flick from my youth FTW!
,onlymeyana,2011-06-15T09:24Z,"Hardcoded subs destroys the possibility for using a sub in their own language, because sub on sub doesn't work. And starchild... what about tag'ing the release with ""hardcoded Swedish""? Instead of just Swedish/svensk? I do agree a little bit with gorgang in this... ""Just know that when people take a bit of time to download a film, hardcoded subs are really not desired"". You say ""Thats lot of versions without any subs..."" But that isn't true after a while... and when you with few seeders and peers take the time to download, and then can't use the movie... it's a little bit boring... What about sharing and credit... Is it that important with the credit?"

,missJiaLi,2011-08-24T14:39Z,"DAMN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
