The Alex Jones Show

A live show today!

The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.


On today's show, Alex talks with Deborah Cohen, the features editor of the British Medical Journal, an international peer reviewed medical journal. Ms. Cohen co-authored WHO and the pandemic flu "conspiracies," an article covering scientists advising the World Health Organization on planning for an influenza pandemic who had done paid work for pharmaceutical firms that stood to gain from the guidance they were preparing.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
