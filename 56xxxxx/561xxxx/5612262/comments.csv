Thanks for the encode/upload.

Only 1 episode to go in this season. However, what I have read so far at least indicates that the show is NOT being cancelled and there will be a S4, maybe an S5.
For one of the best shows on TV, I hope this is true.

Anyone with definite news from a respected source please share.

Cheers
Jon"

Only if you have time to do so...otherwise keep it coming with your rips, happy that you in comparison to other uploaders care to compress giant files into much smaller formats with little to no degradation in quality...
Regards, 
R.C"
