TOMMY BOLIN TEASER
Label Sony Music
Format:Mp3@320


Thomas Richard "Tommy" Bolin (August 1, 1951, Sioux City, Iowa - December 4, 1976) was an American-born guitarist who played with Zephyr (from 1969 to 1971), The James Gang (from 1973 through 1974), Deep Purple (from 1975 to 1976), and his solo work. He died of a drug overdose in 1976.

After performing in a variety of bands since the late '60s, Bolin finally released his first solo album in 1975. Teaser is an impressive display of the guitarist's prowess and range, and is a natural progression from the previous Bolin-dominated James Gang albums Bang and Miami and his work with drummer Billy Cobham. The album features heavy doses of jazz-rock fusion (furthered by guests Jan Hammer, Dave Sanborn, and Michael Walden) in the instrumentals "Homeward Strut" and "Marching Powder," and straight-ahead rock in tracks like "The Grind." Bolin was always equally adept at subtleties, and the ballad "Dreamer" and the exotic "Savannah Woman" (with percussion from Phil Collins) represent this stylistic range here. Overshadowed historically by his guitar dynamics, Bolin's understated yet strong vocals are another selling point. Teaser is a stronger album than its one successor, the uneven Private Eyes, and survives as Bolin's signature work.
