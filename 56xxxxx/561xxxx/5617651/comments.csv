,ffsihateu,2010-06-12T21:00Z,"Everybody resizes... you realise you're killing quality, right? If someone wanted to burn this into a DVD (not that I want to), they would have to resize this yet again... even more quality lost. What's wrong with 720x304?

Thanks for the effort, though."

,Video_Veg,2010-07-02T14:31Z,"Superfast Download and EXCELLENT movie. I strongly agree with petercontact that this documentary is a must see, and even left Michael Moore impressed !
If I didn't know better, I would swear it was filmed on location at the time it happened - totally realistic settings. I hope George Bush gets his face rubbed in it. Thanks to FXG team and all seeders."
