,NitLions,2010-06-08T10:02Z,"Word man, good looks on this film here! Haven't dl'd it yet but Im sure I would rate the quality high cuz this dude always puts out quality and Im not a whiney nerdbitch who thinks its cool to complain about other people's work. Waaaaah waaaaaah, this isn't 3D high def and the sound doesn't sound like Im in a recording studio...waaaaaah. Thats you, you know who you are. THANK YOU Raymond. Thats how you do it. A/V 10/10 cuz its free and its raymondhome so im sure its just fine. That was a pre-asswhooping to all you nerds who think you can do better but would never even try to, and u can have it and keep it for free...your welcome"

,iknowyoudont,2010-06-08T15:45Z,"@ald, R5 means the copy was digitized professionally even though it's missing post-processing by the studio these copies are usually as good as the final dvd product.  "

[V],TheExecutive,2010-06-08T17:24Z,"""Word up"" is a phrase from the 90s, not the 80s....not that it matters. :)"
,matttxxx,2010-06-08T17:26Z,"Can people please seed for a bit, im uploading at 300kb/s but only getting 100kb/s download speed :(, out of all the seeders only 4 are giving anything back, just increase your upload speed for a while and give something back, it doesnt cost anything :)."
,hatebreeder80,2010-06-08T18:05Z,"@matttxxx
it actaullay does cost money for bandwidth :p unless you have unlimited bandwidth.
but for me, and most people thats not a problem unless you only have about 10 gigs a month or something like that. in that case maybe you should upgrade your internet package if youre gonna be downloading movies.
fucking seed bitches.

oh and thanks for the ul raymond, been waiting a while."

,shifty420,2010-06-09T02:09Z,@ploppy dude u should stfu. you actually have nothing to say about this movie or uploader. just here to troll on other commentators. thanks raymond looks good from the images. i'll dl and seed like i always do. 
,libertaswv,2010-06-09T03:54Z,"@ TheExecutive ...No, it's not - it's from the eighties. Usage continues, but it came from the eighties (Cameo)

-- Thx for the up, RH - will seed."
,FileError420,2010-06-09T03:56Z,"Thanks! Good Quality.

And no, exec, Word Up is most certainly from the 80s. Cameo released the song in 86 :)"

,namxad,2010-06-09T17:26Z,"@ TheExecutive.. Um yeah.. you probably never heard that phrase until the 90's, but in NY we used it  ALL the time in the mid-80's along with ""fresh"" and ""def"". Listen to some 80's Hip-Hop (like Dana Dane & Doug E Fresh) and you'll hear it."

,darin_god,2010-06-10T13:10Z,"Okay, people have a problem because it says dvdrip? 

You see that little two character thing in the title of the torrent, it says ""R5""?  If it DIDN'T have that, then there's a reason to bitch.

Anyways, you always deliver Raymondhome. I see your name, I know it's worth it.

Great quality, perfect torrent, fast download.


But shitty movie. If you seen the trailers, then you've seen ALL the funny parts."

,AuRteam,2010-06-11T04:12Z,"Is the audio on this torrent that bad? Is it at least cam audio? Its a line so its gotta be decent...I'll run a review on video, audio and a bit on the movie when I finish downloading and watching."
,perryl,2010-06-11T07:42Z,"v:10 looks great
A:6, no bass at all, not that im complaining. 
m:10, awesome movie. very funny. loved it all. 

some comments...

r5's are not neccesarily from russia, go google it and learn more before telling others what something is that you know nothing about. 

r5's generally are not AS good as dvdrips, but their so damn close its not worth complaining about. 

word up as a phrase would date back to the late 70's. became popular in the 80's, and was noticed by white people in the 90's. 

raymondhome is one of the few trusted uploaders around here. dont knock his uploads. "
,AuRteam,2010-06-11T09:23Z,"Great movie, I absolutely loved the theme. Anybody into the 80s should see this. Also, the audio is not perfect, its good audio, really, but the bass is reduced. Everything else about the movie was great.
