Dave Brubeck - Two Generations of Brubeck
Year: Aug 1973
Label: Atlantic 63324
LP Rip
Quality: flac

This very interesting set features the pianist with three of his sons (Darius on keyboards, Chris doubling on trombone and bass and Danny on drums), and a wide variety of musicians including tenor-saxophonist Jerry Bergonzi, clarinetist Perry Robinson and Peter "Madcat" Ruth on harmonica. To hear such numbers as "Three to Get Ready," "Blue Rondo a la Turk" and "Unsquare Dance" (along with some newer pieces) performed by these younger players casts new light on the durability and flexibility of these classic Brubeck songs. ~ Scott Yanow
