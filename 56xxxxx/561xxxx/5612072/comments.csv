,iKlark,2010-06-07T15:33Z,"I messed up with the trackers, so that only the 1st one is working, go to the torrent's properties, edit the trackers, replace the original trackers with these, otherwise add spaces between them so that they work.

Sorry for the inconvenience... If i still couldn't seed, then i'll reupload it with the correct trackers."
,iKlark,2010-06-07T16:48Z,Hmm 9 seeders. Looks like this thing is working. I'd be glad if somebody who has downloaded it comment about it...
,Lestatdotnet,2010-06-08T02:00Z,"Thanks iKlark! Loved those in the 90's! Windows 7 won't encounter any problems, you say?"
,iKlark,2010-06-08T11:10Z,"^ I don't think so, even if it does, just set compatibility mode to XP and it'll definitely work then."
,motley666,2010-06-08T14:21Z,"Guys, you know that you could grab these old games from abandonware sites for free, right? No worries for seeders and combatibility problems because there is dosbox, an emulator that helps you run old games on all operating systems."
,iKlark,2010-06-11T13:30Z,"^ And then get viruses too right?

What i've uploaded here, is a complete virus-free pack, with a installer & uninstaller. Everything just the way anyone would want them to be... I guess users like you wouldn't get that."
,ITRUN,2010-06-14T18:07Z,Not really into seeding but I'll download.
,Minot13,2011-03-24T10:00Z,@iKlark: can u please upload RED SHARK with active seeders?
