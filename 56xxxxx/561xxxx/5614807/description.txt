Thanks a lot to XVX Team!!!



SEEDED BY CARRANCA (do Brasil)

if you are into audiowarez then you probably know about Digidesignâ€™s (now AVID) Pro Tools DAW. There are several editions of this app and one of those is ProTools HD which (unfortunately) requires additional hardware (soundcard) to use it. Well, guys from XVX came up with this cracked version of ProTools HD which enables you to use any soundcard you want with their own Hardware Emulator. Only â€œdownsideâ€ (if you are Windows user) is â€“ this is only for Mac OSX platform because XVX cracks OSX software exclusively.


AND JUST ONE RULE


NEVER USE WINDOWS AGAIN!!

KKKKKKKK
