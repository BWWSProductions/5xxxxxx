,mr.jun,2010-06-23T07:54Z,"hey carranca, there must be something going on with these last 3%...
not sure what to do about them, but maybe the torrent has any issue or so?
you can see there are a lot of ppl whod love to use and share it, just we need those friggin 3% lol
maybe you regenerate the torrent and put it up? not quite sure it would help, but maybe does...
we all would very yppreciate to get hands on this stuff... so pretty PLEASE...
could you hand out our last 3% pls?
thanks alot!"
,stopimalreadydead,2010-06-23T17:18Z,Also stuck w/ 2.78% to go :(

,CARRANCA,2010-06-23T20:58Z,"look people ...
I'm doing the best I can ..

I am currently in a connection of 10 mbps ...
a little patience and education are always welcome!"
,CARRANCA,2010-06-23T21:02Z,"hi mr.jun...

is possible that it is giving error .. also noticed this problem ... If this connection is not working fast'll remake the torrent!"

,oskeeno,2010-06-23T22:25Z,do u need a digidesign hardware to open up the protools
,CARRANCA,2010-06-23T22:35Z,"hey man...

READ THE STEP NUMBER ONE...

PLEEEEASE!!"
,mr.jun,2010-06-24T03:04Z,"well, i think we all should appreciate every torrent thats seriouly made for the  benefit of others, so give some credit to carranca instead of yelling at him...
finally i got it all 100%, seems the last 3% are tere hehe... didnt test it yet, but will do shortly.

so thanks for now, might write review laters!"
,mr.jun,2010-06-24T12:51Z,"yep, those 3% pretty much did the trick lol
its working great, its the only HD edition ive ever seen running without any specific hardware. 
and additionally routing the signal to other applications is a bit of a geious trick wich reminds a lil bit of the Radium-group in the earlier 90's...

so our regards go to the XVX-group for hacking this in the best way possible, 
and thanks to carras for putting this up.
its lots of fun being able to work on a laptop without the m-box even on a HD system.
have fun and take care, and remember:
showing respect is just like honoring yourself."
,oskeeno,2010-06-24T14:23Z,"thanks carranca, n team xvx. sorry for giving u a hard time, but it works perfect."
,RhymacidalManiac,2010-06-24T21:00Z,so heres my review.. it worked on its own but wouldnt with the digi003 at all... then it said n mon kext installed improperly and i needed to format my mac book... i did that and it was working fine this morning till i upgraded to 10.6.4 and now my computer wont even work... great.. thanks.
,mr.jun,2010-06-25T14:01Z,"ok, one step forward:
they released a v 1.3 for the panel/drivers @ 
http://mackingmusic.blogspot.com/2010/06/xvxdigidesignhardwareemulatorv13osxinte.html
but im unable to install it properly.
even in terminal as superuser its not poss.
i opened the install command and did copy/paste manually all the files, and did all the commands in terminal by hand, but it keeps saying the XVX-Device.kext is not authentic, i should check perms.
any idea what to do pls?"
,RhymacidalManiac,2010-06-25T17:54Z,i took my macbook pro to the apple store and they are fixing it for free they said the video card is blown... idk if it was a short from a surge cuz we had a storm or the result of using this software. most likely the storm but i just want everyone to know that this set me back big time... now 1 week without a studio... fuckin A man... the prog works on my hackintosh but i question if it has a virus or something...
,oskeeno,2010-06-25T19:36Z,how do u use super user in terminal
,stopimalreadydead,2010-06-26T01:54Z,"This works beautifully! Thank you! It's been too long w/o a hacked pro tools :)

@RhymacidalManiac:
If it's a late 2008-early 2009 model, that's what's been happening to the video cards. Mine's starting to go too."
,oskeeno,2010-06-26T16:49Z,is anybody having a delay when u r recording? 4 some strange reason every time irecord i have to change the buffer rate.. need help asap
,RhymacidalManiac,2010-06-27T20:35Z,"yea well apple is fixing my video card for free but if u are running a pro tools set up with a digi002 or 003 it wont work... ive tried it works independently without being plugged into anything... 

@oskeeno thats called latency and is normal if you are not running a professional set up... the best way to reduce latency is to go into setup>playback engine>then set it to 512 then lower the values like level 2 is good and that should reduce the latency.  If it doesnt then your computer just doesnt have the processing power to handle PT HD... and stopimalreadydead it works perfectly if you are not a SERIOUS protools user... i have Legit equipment that is not supported by this and considering I DLed for 4 weeks im pretty pissed to find that out... still happy XVX cracked the Waves 7 bundle tho... but this was a little dissapointing."
,bloodwashchild,2010-07-04T14:03Z,"Hey Guys i am new to this stuff but i have downloaded the prog but it first asked me for pace updated extensions.. download those now its asking be for authorised ilok....do i have to buy an authorized ilok to get this program work if not can u post installation instructions
Thanks"
,shuhr,2010-07-19T15:56Z,"RhymacidalManiac I also had the original problem with the N-mon  but then i reinstalled it wa sucessful but it still not open properly, mind sharing what you did after that point to fix it?"
,shuhr,2010-07-19T16:22Z,"Does anyone else keep getting ""pro tools hd quit unexpectedly"" when trying to open? any fixes?"
,sirceejxyz,2010-08-16T07:48Z,"pleaseeeee XVXTeam can you make a windows version . its not cool to discriminate 
PLEASEEEEEEEE"
,dookoodo,2010-08-19T12:31Z,"so I just finished downloading this, took about 4 hours or so, wasn't really paying attention, but it didn't take long.

great torrent"
,cvyogi,2010-08-19T23:06Z,has anyone got this to work with 002 ? can't seem to get it work with midi keyboard...
,rufio1945,2010-09-01T23:19Z,"Just follow the instructions on the setup screens and read the xvx read me file first, found that this explained installation, the xvx device and hardware emulator. 

Merci beaucoup pour le Upload!

Good luck with the install guys!"
,gw1zr1824,2010-09-03T20:37Z,"So  everything  installed  beautifully. I  open  up  ProTools  HD  and  when  I  click  play  it  says  ""access  violation"". Does  anyone  know  whats  up  with  that? I  can  fidget  with  the  mixer  and  windows  and  press  stop, rewind, forward  and  record  but  as  soon  as  I  hit  play  it  says  ""access  violation""."
,didii,2010-09-13T15:47Z,"@RhymacidalManiac: That is not because of protools, but because of the update. Does it says wrong version on startup? I had that fault just by updating my OSX."
,MacMoron,2010-10-04T00:26Z,"n-Mon driver not found
How to install it?
I have do it with kext helper with the same message.
Thanks"
,cheezebeast,2010-11-17T10:44Z,"I have a good setup, Focusrite LS56, an i7 Hackintosh with plenty of power. But I cannot seem to get the latency down to a managable level, using the xvx panel, the LS56 panel and the playback engine in protools itself, I have even selected 64ms and it is still quite delayed. Anybody had any similar problems with Latency?"
,nikoli92,2010-12-03T02:35Z,"Thanks CARRANCA and XVX Team!

Followed the instructions, and installed perfectly first time! Runs smoothly on my macbook with minimal latency issues! :)

Only thing im annoyed with is that you cant have protools LE on the same system. But still excellent upload!

10/10"
,blindash,2010-12-04T15:56Z,"Please some one help. Load everything fine but when i open it keeps shutting itself down. on osx 10.6.5 dont know if that makes a difference
