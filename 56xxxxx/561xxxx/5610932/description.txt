PrisM NOTES::::::::::::
Well, we synced imagine's audio to this, then everytime we selected output, and to render onto the video it kept going out of sync, we re installed codecs, kicked the computer, even shouted at it, no joy, so we used rx audio now.
Anyway to video, changed colors slightly as video was pretty damn nice, slightly changed the red and yellow, increased red slightly, lowered cyan, slightly touched the contrast and brightness, touch of sharpness, overall video looks pretty damn good, didn't want to oversharpen it, because tried to keep size little lower than normal, due to movie is only 1hr 30. anyway Enjoy //prism
check the sample, quality is nice:D
