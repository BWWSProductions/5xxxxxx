,deleder,2010-06-09T00:15Z,Will this update my 05.12 baseband from 3.1.2?
,EvanXTC,2010-06-09T00:19Z,"@deleder

No, it was made with Pwnagetool on Mac, meaning the baseband will be preserved :)"
,adolfopd,2010-06-09T05:48Z,"94.3% download It's  a fake?
"
,Pyrofallout,2010-06-09T06:30Z,"94.53% here. Prolly not faked, one can make this FW easily with a mac and PwnageTool. Guess the uploader stopped seeding. "
,smakmesily,2010-06-09T06:48Z,Does this require itunes 9.2? That's what I've read elsewhere.
,smakmesily,2010-06-09T07:03Z,94.6 and both seeds stopped. wtf
,yagbadoodles,2010-06-18T21:52Z,"Where are the seeders?

You said that your device must be Jailbroken using Redsnow, how about if using PwnageTool? "
