Des KÃ¶nigs FuÃŸball jÃ¼ngster Trabant, 1968
Au royaume du foot
The king's youngest football bodygard

Sometimes, not very often, you find a film that just captures your heart.
This is a short film of 11 minutes without an IMBD-rating! that I find just
fantastic. 
It is about a young boys love for football, about not belonging, about tradgedy
and finally about dreams and hope all in 11 minutes.
It does not matter if you are colorblind, the film is in black and white.
You do not need to know german, no words are spoken.

Enjoy!
