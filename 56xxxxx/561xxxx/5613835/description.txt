                      http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1264103                 
                                                                          
                                                    
                          
                             
                                 
                                                                          
           For hundreds of years, Africa has existed in a state of        
           despair. Famine, civil wars and rampant disease have left      
           the continent without hope, but for the efforts of             
           Western do-gooders. At first, they arrived with food,          
           bibles and the magic of penicillin; more recently they         
           have hosted rock concerts and sent plane loads of grain.       
           And in the last decade of the 20th century they arrived        
           and took babies home with them. First there was Angelina,      
           then Madonna, and now...Pauly Shore! The film builds its       
           comedy foundation on the international interest in             
           Celebrity Adoptions, and the debate that surrounds these       
           transactions on both sides of the Atlantic. Sometimes          
           politically incorrect and never scared to tread on             
           manicured toes.
