Alex Jones Quote of the Day ::

"If Big Oil wants to sponsor me, uh, because I mean I take sponsorship if I believe in it, I'm ready for Big Oil sponsorship.  We'll, we'll have adds publicly on the air and admit that we're financed by Big Oil. Give us the money!"

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
