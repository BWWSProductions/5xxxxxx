To call this movie fucked up is an understatement. Its one of the more fucked up movies I have seen for sure. Whether its THE most fucked up thing ever made is debatable and whether you are sober or not its probably not going to make sense so you might as well get good and fucked up when you watch it because it may actually help with comprehending this.

Enjoy.


This is a full untouched dvd ripped using anydvd. Please do your part and stop sharing 700mb and dvds ripped to fit on dvd5! This is 2010. People can learn how to shrink their own damn dvds and if you are still on dialup stop being a cheap fucker and get a job! If you dont own a dvd burner thats ridiculous.

Oh and someone let me know that apparently its the governments fault people have dialup still. While you could make that argument that the government does need to step in and break up these telco companies it still doesnt explain why the fuck someone would be trying to use peer to peer to download 700mb files using DIALUP!!!
