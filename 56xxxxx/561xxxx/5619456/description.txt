Plot:

Over the last year, more than 40 albinos have been murdered in Tanzania, some as young 
as six months old. Many more have been attacked with machetes and had their limbs cut 
off while alive. Their body parts are used by witchdoctors in potions and remedies. 
Oscar, a respected Tanzanian businessman, wants Tanzanians to recognise that albinos 
are human beings like everybody else. He decided that this message could best be spread 
by example and exposure - and in a world fuelled for so many by football, what better 
way than a football team with albino players?
