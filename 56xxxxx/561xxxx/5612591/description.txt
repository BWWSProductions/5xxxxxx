Album Info..:

From the swaggering frustration in the first song ("I only get my rocks off while I'm
sleeping," Mick Jagger sings in the hyper "Rocks Off"), the Stones speed through
familiar neighborhoods of country, blues, and R&B on Exile. They never even bother to
stop when they've crashed into something. They don't leap into new worlds so much as 
master the old ones, turning Slim Harpo's blues obscurity "Hip Shake" into a
harp-and-piano steamroller and setting spines a-cracking in "Ventilator Blues." Both 
"Tumbling Dice" and Keith Richards's "Happy" have become hits, but the 1972 album is 
most notable for its overall murky adrenaline. --Steve Knopper 

Regarded as one of the greatest albums in rock 'n' roll history and one of the most
defining of the Stones' catalogue. Upon its release more than three decades ago,
'Exile on Main Street' innovatively wove varying musical genres, instruments and even
artists into a compelling rhythmic masterpiece. The original 18-track double-album 
was recorded in various stages at multiple locations, including Olympic Studios in 
London, Keith Richard's mansion Nellcote in France, and in Los Angeles where the
literal "Main Street" influenced the album title. These atypical circumstances
surrounding the recording process greatly affected the album's outcome which was
highly reflective and influenced by the sociopolitical turbulence that marked the
late `60s and early `70s. The Stones nixed the influences of a flower-child era and
directed their creative process with the edgier, excessive, "more is more" approach
of the `70s. Exile reveals a sprawling mix of genres with undertones of blues,
country, R&B and gospel mixed with lyrics that fervently demand for release and 
liberation. The 2-CD version is a 3-panel digi-pak, 2xCDs with a 12 page booklet. The
Digipak is printed in reverse board double white to keep an 'uncoated' feel like the 
original LP release. The 2nd disc features 10 tracks originally recorded during the
Exile era including 'Plundered My Soul', 'Dancing in the Light', 'Following the 
River' and 'Pass The Wine' plus alternate versions of 'Soul Survivor' and 'Loving
Cup'.
