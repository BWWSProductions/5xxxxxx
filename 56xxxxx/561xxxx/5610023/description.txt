Stop Information Leakage: Web Server Anonymization
Obscure Headers, Cookies, & Error Messages
Remove Unnecessary HTTP Header & Response Data
Broadcasting your Web server's identity allows intruders to
complete their first task -- fingerprinting your technology.
ServerMask removes unnecessary HTTP header and response data
and camouflages your server by providing false signatures.

What ServerMask Does:
Contributes to PCI Compliance
ServerMask provides application-layer error suppression for PCI compliance.

Per-site Configuration
ServerMask allows for multiple default profiles and the ability to create custom profiles, allowing unique settings to be applied per domain.

Masks Server Name Header
ServerMask will mask the Server name header in a number of ways:
Remove altogether
Replace with one of 30 other Web server signatures
Replace with a custom server name you create
Select multiple false Web server signatures and randomize the response (you select how often a response is refreshed).

Rewrite Identifying Session Cookie Names
ServerMask will rewrite identifying session cookie names, such as ASPSessionID and ASP.NET_SessionId, using one or more alternative names and fabricate decoy cookies to further confuse attackers. ServerMask utilizes One-to-many cookie masking.

Rewrite 404 & Application-layer Errors
ServerMask suppresses info leakage by converting 500-range errors to 404 errors, then presenting custom 404 responses.

Remove Identifying File Extensions
ServerMask removes identifying file extensions, such as .asp, .aspx and other Microsoft technologies from source code and URL display.

Remove unnecessary HTTP headers
ServerMask removes unnecessary HTTP headers, such as PUBLIC, X-POWERED-BY and others.

Emulate Other Server Data
ServerMask will emulate the ETAG and ALLOW header formats of non-IIS servers. (As well as Apache's HTTP header order.)

Decoys & Error Messages
ServerMask provides Auto-generated decoy cookies and headers, and customizable HTTP error messages.

Diagnostics & Validation
Online diagnostic tool for checking page cacheability and validation tool provided for checking syntax of rule statements
