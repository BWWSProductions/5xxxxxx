The Ice Road Truckers return to Alaska, hauling their biggest loads ever across the most dangerous terrain they've faced. But this year, trucking critically needed cargo north to the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay is just the beginning. The drivers will tackle frozen rivers and swamps out beyond the Dalton Highway, hauling supplies to some of the most remote towns of the Great White North.
