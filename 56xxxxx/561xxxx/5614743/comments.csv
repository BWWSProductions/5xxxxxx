,Eywa,2010-06-09T03:31Z,"Contrast too high, colours very dark and compression artefacts more noticeable than in the version released last weekend. Thanks anyway."
,EnemyDrone,2010-06-09T13:55Z,^^^ Must be your television. This is perfect on my big screen. The colors were perfect. Fix your tv moron. Thanks for this up extremeperfect copy.
[V],Raider,2010-06-09T22:08Z,Thanks!
,NitLions,2010-06-10T05:22Z,"@Eywa... you are why people suck!! Who gives a damn if its not a PERFECT copy (which its seems it might be based on the next comment after yours), cuz you got it for nothing, no time, money, effort at all really. So shut your nerd mouth and go build a statue of your world of warcraft character out of paperclips like you usually do with your time. Don't forget to add your new +5 fire sword, 4 eyes!!!"
,crosbyfan,2010-06-10T07:59Z,"@nitlions first, love the name I'm from the area. second I have been using this site for a long time and just registered now just to say how much i love the comment toward eywa"
,Eywa,2010-06-10T21:19Z,"Just pointing out that there are several (not just one, but several) much better quality rips right here on The Pirate Bay. Cry me a river and choke on your hate, bitches."

,Eywa,2010-06-11T04:45Z,"Any of these is of superior quality:

Mr.Nobody.2009.R5.XviD.AC3-ViSiON
Mr.Nobody.2009.DVDRip.AC3.XviD-NoGRP
Mr.Nobody.2010.R5.XviD.AC3-Rx

etc."
,NitLions,2010-06-12T05:46Z,"Eywa just give up, you failed. Nobody wants to hear your tears of shame and lame attempts at sounding correct. I don't care if this was the worst copy of any movie in the history of the world, you bashed it using nerd language and thats unacceptable. Crosbyfan I appreciate the love"
,Eywa,2010-06-14T05:33Z,"Butthurt much? Here's some comparison screenshots with ViSiON's release (that's the only one I have left on my computer, but as I said earlier, pretty much ANY other release is better than IMAGiNE's shit):

IMAGiNE is pretty much the worst quality release group there is. But hey - whatever floats your boat."
,hpayns,2010-06-14T07:23Z,"I actually like good quality, so thx Eywa."
,nancy_boi,2010-06-19T17:11Z,thank u
,eater78,2010-07-06T13:41Z,Thanks
,mchkica,2010-07-09T20:14Z,"@NitLions - of course we care about the quality, the indulgence must be complete, and that\'s a beauty of a movie, full stop! It doesn?t have to be perfect, we have cinemas for that, but messed up image or sound latency are unforgiveable. :)  sure, you can call people names and express your primitivism as much as you like, but that says more about you then about them.rn@Eywa ? thanks for the suggestionsrn"
,florida777,2010-07-17T10:23Z,"I\'m VERY interested as to the type and quality of the drugs that Eywa is on. It seems that they must be quite good, and I must admit, that I\'m a bit jealous. Given my location, I have access to EXTREMELY good, uncut drugs of all types, but evidently they don\'t even come close to what he\'s getting. Either that or he just has good old mental impairment. :) Adios !!"
,davey62,2010-10-12T01:55Z,"big surprise that Eywa's never uploaded anything?

no i didn't think so."
,suade4life,2010-10-13T20:40Z,look good on trailer..thanks dude
,Muianescu,2011-04-03T22:22Z,"Thanks for the upload and by the way is a very good quality, maybe there are some better but this one is very good."
,drains,2011-08-15T23:32Z,thnx
