There's a lot of stuff that is long-winded and largely irrelevant. In places the XML doesn't meet specifications, and could be better written. And I've just discovered that I've been reading all about the Manifest XML and creating my file by hand, when I don't really need to because there's a Manifest Editor, but we don't get told that until half way through the chapter.
