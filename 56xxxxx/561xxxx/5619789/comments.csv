,DogNo7,2010-06-17T23:53Z,It is rumored that during the filming of episodes of Perry Mason and Ironsides that Raymond Burr would suffer bouts of PTSD as a result of a tragic accident involving coconuts and bananas that occurred during the filming of Bride of the Gorilla.
,DogNo7,2010-06-17T23:59Z,"Lon Chaney is rumored to have had secret unnatural urges related to gorillas, and sometimes, when he was desperate, monkeys.

Some film historians believe that Lon Chaney identified gorillas with his mother in law, who had above average body hair.

Grips on the film crew had to restrain Chaney to prevent him from habitually grooming the fur of the gorilla in the film.

It is uncertain if Chaney saw the extremely tragic accident that Burr witnessed, vis a vis the banana/coconut incident."
