,yesbos,2010-06-08T18:22Z,"ronit21 its true about KI, but i'm a collector. So looking for the best quality not really the movie.

Actually who can hide 3 idiots for about 6 months. I dont know, but i got a source that says it will be online (original copy) soon. 
Also,from another source , its going to be telecast on sirasa tv on 10th June 9 pm SL time. I don't know whether its original copy, but should be original. cos they telecast it for their anniversary. If they telecast, it should be in their online tv channel too.
I'm not sure yet, So check on following link @ 10th about 9 pm.

try google for more clear online sirasaTv."
,ronit21,2010-06-08T18:55Z,"okeys yessboss bro,

wants.. free movies rocks..pirate bay

,ronit21,2010-06-08T18:59Z,"i really believe that torrents , movie downloading 
is in its primary state this time in india, no body give 
comments , no thanks to ripper , they merely
seed and not many people have 2mbps BB, 
but m hopeful for future :-)"

,aks005,2010-06-13T03:51Z,"Anyone looking for BDrip of 3 Idiots, please know that that Vidhu Vinod Chopra takes hell lot of time (more than 1 year) to release dvd or BD in market.. remember DVD of Munna Bhai MBBS was release after 1 yr.

So I think we will have to wait a lot .."
