Hour One Guest: Kerry Kenney, President, RFK Center for Justice & Human Rights on the dangers of toxic oil dispersants.

Feds studying the flow say that the oil volcano could be spewing up to 100,000 barrels (4.2 million gallons) a day! That would mean at best only 11% of the oil is being captured by â€œCut & Capâ€.

Meanwhile, BP wonâ€™t come clean on what toxins are in the million plus gallons of dispersants used thus far, and the toxic stew of crude and dispersants is of grave concern to human reproductive health, both on the Gulf Coast and beyond.

BPâ€™s other spill: half a million pounds of benzene and other chemicals were released into the air in April and May from the same Texas refinery where 15 died in 2005. Not previously made public, BPâ€™s own internal investigations tell a shameful story of reckless disregard for safety. And Shell and ExxonMobil are said to be licking their chops at the prospect of a BP takeover.

Obama was on NBCâ€™s Today Show this morning, weâ€™ll bring you the highlights including the quest to find out â€œwhose ass needs to be kickedâ€ (video below). And is this the disaster in the Gulf â€œObamaâ€™s Katrina?â€ Sure, if by Obama you mean Cheney (more).

A study 25 years in the making suggests that children raised by lesbian parents have fewer behavioral problems. And what to look for on the new iPhone.
