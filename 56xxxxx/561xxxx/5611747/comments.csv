Avathoorugalai Muriadippom (Defending Defamations) is a collection of articles written by intellectuals against those rotten Leftists, Anti Liberation theologians like Aa.Marx, Ravikumar, Shoba Sakthi and others. 

It also has a translation of Ellyn Shander?s Speech throug Video Conferencing after she was refused visa by the so called greatest Democracy of the world India. Shander?s speech was translated by Tamilarasan and the initial few pages fine tuned by Thozhar Thiagu, who has translated Marx?s Das Capital to Tamil."
