This contains music by Ferrucio Busoni (1866-1924) from my personal collection. This isn't your retarded classical top 100 mozart collection, this is real repertoire.

This is a fairly comprehensive torrent, containing:

 * Piano Concerto, op. 39 (both by Ohlsson and Ogdon)
 * Fantasia Contrappuntistica (Madge, Harden and Ogdon)
 * Doktor Faust (Nagano)
 * Toccata
 * An die Jugend
 * Elegien for piano
 * Sonatinas for piano
 * Nocturne Symphonique
 * Concertino for Clarinet
 * Divertimento for flute and orch.
 * Many other lesser known works.

Dispersed among the various works is Geoffrey Douglas Madge's out-of-print box set. However, I don't sort by CD so you will have to search for them by the name of the piece you are looking for, or just search for "Madge".

Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.





**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"



If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
