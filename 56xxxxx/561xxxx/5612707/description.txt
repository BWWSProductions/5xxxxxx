Valora was just your average, all American girl; looking for love in an online world. Then she met Ridley. He was strong, good looking, and best of all, he listened. So she agreed to meet him. It was a public place after all. What could happen?

Ridley was just your average, all American psychopath; looking for love in an online world. Then he met Valora. She was strong, good looking, and best of all, she listened. So he arranged to meet her. It would be a public place; after all, he was careful.

Shortly after their meeting, Ridley kidnaps Valora and takes her on the date of a lifetime. She can stay and talk or she can run; her choice. He likes when they run. It becomes sport. Valora chooses not to run and the courtship begins.

Valora quickly learns that sheâ€™s not Ridleyâ€™s first victim and may not even be his last. He taunts her with his next victim if she doesnâ€™t play along. He goes on to show her his previous guests, buried out back, and then lets her in on his gardening tips: â€œBlood makes the flowers grow.â€

Over the next few days Valora is tortured, physically and mentally, but Ridley, oddly remains always the gentlemen. In his own perverse way, heâ€™s trying to woo her. In so doing, he kills a childhood friend of hers, another date, and finally her own grandfather.

But that was Ridleyâ€™s mistake. Having nothing left to lose, she puts her plan in motion to turn the tables. The hunted becomes the hunter. The victim becomes the victor, but only after putting Ridley through everything that he put her through first.
