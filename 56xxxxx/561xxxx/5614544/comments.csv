,BMessiah,2010-07-05T06:12Z,"Found a Trojan program Trojan-downloader.Win32.Exchanger.baz in the keygen. Detected by Kaspersky on separate machines. 

Too bad... I was looking forward to start using it :(

Jugz, if you don't believe me, upload the crack file to virustotal.com and check for yourself. Its definitely not a false negative. "
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-07-08T08:21Z,Kaspery is also one of the biggest jokes for an anti-virus program. Even Norton didn't cry on this one. Suck my butthole BMessiah.

,0112358132134,2010-10-17T16:52Z,"Thank you.....computers think keygens are Trojans but they not because they are not licensed programs by windows, so it's really ok...noobs....

,Endtrend,2010-12-28T05:18Z,The fucking keygen won't accept my computer ID!! Says it's not the right number of characters?? Buncha bullshit! 
,Endtrend,2010-12-28T06:26Z,"""6. =>"" 

What????"
,Endtrend,2010-12-28T06:49Z,"Fucking keygen is utterly worthless! I've tried every possible thing and it just says ""Invalid Computer id length..."" every time. So Goddamn frustrating!!! I'm in Windows 7 ultimate, if someone knows what is wrong, by all means, do tell...."
,seven7Up,2011-01-19T06:45Z,"Downloaded 8.0.7.38 straight from mediafour.com. The keygen seems to work perfectly. Seems like you found a virus in the keygen? Then, don't use it. Others who know better? You know who you are."
,shtool9,2011-02-13T23:53Z,"This really works, Yes the keygen reads as a generic trojan horse. Don't fear though, this is good shit!"

,smokerdalejash,2011-03-14T06:26Z,lemme try dis shit
,alexfr,2011-05-29T21:49Z,"Hi and thanks for this torrent. I am having the same prob as others though with the computer ID.

'invalid computer id length...'

I'm using the 'full computer name' as described by win 7 x64, when looking in the system settings (right click 'computer' in the start menu / properties). In my case this is a string of six letters spelling a name.

Is this the computer id you mean? Please help :)"
,alexfr,2011-05-29T22:31Z,"ok for those of you having my prob, i finally solved it (and feeling pretty stoopid) -->

the 'computer id' is a number of alphanumerics generated within the macdrive activation window, not anything to do with the computer name permanently linked to your computer. it's just a long string of digits. When you put the generated serial into the first box of the activation window, a computer id appears below it. you take this and put it back into the second window of the keygen.

duhhhh, easy when you know how........ was looking too hard for the wrong thing"
,lumichan,2011-09-01T21:22Z,Help! I used to be able to use it but now the CORE Keygen doesn't want to open up!! It gives me the error that it can't run or something like that D:
,lumichan,2011-09-01T21:31Z,"this is the error I got when I opened the keygen: ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item"""

,bromabull,2011-11-27T12:19Z,"@Geek999.. Dude!!when u dont know that keygens are trojans, dont call urself a geek.."
,boshesha,2011-12-03T18:01Z,"AAAAHHHHHGGGGG........ I really feel stup....!!! like alexfr sayd before... 
yes it works great.. with no problems.. but to put the comp. id... wow....

The keygen is like a conversation between the generator and the activator... and you are in the middle trying to send messages between them..

so you install the program, restart the computer, the activation windows appears you select the logical stuff like no internet. and then you open the key gen... so far so good. the this is the love story between them:

you: genrate the serial..
key gen says: this is the serial number for you activator.. jejeje
you paste that serial into the activator window.. and press enter... and other display appears with other info of course.
activator says: chezzz ty... this is your Computer  Id...
you copy/paste that computer id into the keygenator.
Keygen says: I dont want to c u again... this is your activation code....
then you copy/paste that act. code in the activator windows..
you can finish the process now... after that close all the windows.... and then you say.. fuckk that was easy... i feel like a dumm stup..d
like me... :("
,Endtrend,2012-02-19T22:36Z,It works! FOLLOW THE UPLOADER'S INSTRUCTIONS!!!
