,jocamero,2010-06-07T23:28Z,"Thanks!

The first serial didn't work for me.  I had to manually register each program with its corresponding serial."
,akinao,2010-06-08T08:19Z,"Where exactly did you find the serials? I tried the ones from the beta2 but they didn't work. 
Where is that nfo?"
,akinao,2010-06-08T08:25Z,"nvm. Due to certain actions I accidentaly deleted the nfo w/o knowing it. Works like a charm now!

On another note, I wish piratebay would incorporate the option to delete/edit previous comments."
,arquiTECH,2010-06-08T17:56Z,"yes!!!!

works perfect with me."
,balahir,2010-06-08T21:14Z,"Thanks, works great. I agree with jocamero, the first serial does not work. You have to start each of the programs and enter the corresponding serial in the nfo-file (open with Text editor). MS has finally improved start-up speed, they open in less than a second on my MBP core i5."
,willtard,2010-06-09T09:38Z,"Just a very boring bug : the key ""ì²«"" don't work in word and only in word. I often write in french so it's very complicated for me."
,vitordt,2010-06-09T18:08Z,"Thanks, works like a charm. Great work from Microsoft guys at least!
Just follow  JOCAMERO steps and all will be fine."
,mnfesq,2010-06-09T21:49Z,"For OSx86 users, this version requires 10.5.8 to run, not just to install.  I am able to run the Beta 2 on my Dell Inspiron 1720 running 10.5.7 after doing the ""change version"" trick to get it installed.  The Beta 4 checks the version every time it is opened.  I don't recommend keeping the version set at 10.5.8 if that is not the version you are running."
,ywamusicc,2010-06-14T23:29Z,"When I install..  Except Out look all the apps crash as bad command.  
I had re-insta  Beta 2.. because beta 3 and Beta 4 give me the same crash..   Any idea what to do with this?    Please advice anyone..."
,davidlt,2010-06-16T06:20Z,Beta 3 and Beta 4 has problems with language support. Anyone tried fixing/overcoming it?
,sh0nky,2010-07-22T12:53Z,Is anyone else having trouble with time limit on this version? I'm getting a message saying the beta release will expire in 3 days. Tried installing the patch for beta 2 but it didn't work. Has anyone got a beta 4 patch?
,mrmime,2010-07-22T23:43Z,esto sirve alguien ya lo probo?
,anglo1558,2010-07-26T02:59Z,"I am also having trouble with the expiration thing. It just expired today (25 July) and now I'm wondering if I should try to resolve this, or if I should just install the iWorks that I have in a box...? Help!"
,searles,2010-11-21T22:29Z,"Im getting, ""this beta release has expired, contact Microsfot for updated beta release"" on all the apps.

Anyone else encounter this and have a fix?"
