,Karlston,2010-06-09T23:44Z,Anyone want to seed this? A gazillion people are stuck at 68.1%. Thanks.
,Minerva7101,2010-06-13T18:39Z,Where are the seeders?
,55range,2010-06-19T09:10Z,"wow, 2 seeders a chance to finish maybe nxt year !"
,Karlston,2010-06-20T00:21Z,Forget it! The handful of seeders don't want to share this anymore :-(
,Autopia,2010-06-24T11:53Z,Stuck at 84% :-(
,newbie125,2010-07-02T04:34Z,stuck @ 99.3%..... care to seed....????
,Minerva7101,2010-07-02T16:28Z,Moving forward... extremely slowly... let's see how many weeks until we get the final 0.7%. :-)
,Karlston,2010-07-03T04:13Z,"At 99.3%, all 4 magazines are complete, that's good enough for me. All that's incomplete are some Crysis 2 images, which I care little about."
,Minerva7101,2010-07-03T16:28Z,"Ok, I didn't think to check that. I assumed that one of the magaines were incomplete. Then I'm outta here, why should anyone stay and help seed when the uploader can't even be bothered to seed the whole torrent?"
