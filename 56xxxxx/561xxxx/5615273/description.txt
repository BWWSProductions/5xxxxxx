Based on the 1978 George Romero gore classic, this horror remake takes place in the wake of a plague as the United States is overrun by millions of corpses who walk the earth as cannibalistic zombies. A small group of survivors, including a nurse (Sarah Polley) and a police officer (Ving Rhames), try to find shelter within a massive shopping mall. But the zombies have a kind of sense memory and start arriving -- in droves -- for a shopping spree. (Unrated Directors Cut)
