This was on the back cover, I felt it should be included:

"Here we are in the seventies. Vietnam, racial unrest, disagreeable dope laws. The release of the Pentagon Black Diaries, etc. So in light of the current Funny World Situation we live in and with our distinct longing for laughter in the face of disaster, may we offer you the Hard Rock Comedy of one Chicano (Cheech) and one Chinese(Chong) in hopes that laughing with tears in the eyes does not become the national passtime..."
