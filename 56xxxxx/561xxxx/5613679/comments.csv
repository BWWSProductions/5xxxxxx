[T],pmp_2010,2010-06-10T06:51Z,"I came across this book in '96
I wasn't consistent in following its principles and practices, but this book has always helped me out in my tough times(especially the chapters on Yoga Nidra). I have not been more influenced by anything else than by this.
Buy the hard copy (and read it)- you will be making a really good investment........
The techniques stated in this book require no particular belief or faith, only practice"
