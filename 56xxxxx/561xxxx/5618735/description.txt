THE VILTRUMITE WAR CONTINUES!
You all knew it was coming, so we might as well get it out of the way early: CONQUEST vs. INVINCIBLE -- the rematch! This time Invincible wonâ€™t have Atom Eve to help him, and Conquest wonâ€™t make the mistake of underestimating him. Can a galaxy-spanning all-out war contain this fight? This issue is not to be missed!
