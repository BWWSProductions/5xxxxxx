,paschkow,2011-08-18T05:26Z,"@ macacoveio when trying to install on windows vista or 7 the administrator account needs to be enabled, otherwise it will not allow files to be copied to the windows directory.
to enable the hidden admin account run the command prompt in admin mode (by right clicking and selecting ""run as administrator"") and type...

""net user administrator /active:yes""

then log out and log back in with the newly created administrator account. DONE.
now just run plate n sheet installation as normal."
,macacoveio,2011-10-21T15:58Z,"Now I get, ""the system cannot find the path specified""... on the command prompt window."
,macacoveio,2011-10-21T15:59Z,"Now I get, ""the system cannot find the path specified""... on the command prompt window.
It does the install but only trial version"
