Plants provide oxygen, food, shelter, and much more.  Your student can learn more about the plant kingdom with the 79-page Plants Project Pack from In the Hands of a Child.  This pack includes a 14-page Research Guide and 25 Hands-On Activities about plant classification, anatomy, reproduction, life cycles, photosynthesis, and plant uses.
