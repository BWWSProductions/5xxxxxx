It's August 8th, 2011."

,Night_Cat,2011-09-07T13:09Z,"Thank you to everyone who seeded this trolley video!

It took 3 weeks of trying! Finally I have the entire video. I love history documentaries, but this one is only available on a VHS cassette. Ahh, those boxy old tapes of yesteryear.

I do have a VCR sitting on a bookshelf, but I don't have a television, so even if I bought this one, I wouldn't be able to watch it.

Even with those torrent files with the low numbers, someone might be eagerly hunting for it!"
