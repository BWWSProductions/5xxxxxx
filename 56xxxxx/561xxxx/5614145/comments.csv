,Blumiere,2010-06-08T14:08Z,Legit PAL version or converted? Also seems a little suspicious since the file is larger than the NTSC versions.

,chrisjahn123,2010-06-10T16:54Z,Im kinda new to downloading torrents of games. Could someone please explain to me how to do this properly?
,mondo,2010-06-10T19:51Z,"""Could someone please explain to me how to do this properly?""

The only thing you have to do is unpack the files using winrar and then burn the .ISO file SLOWLY (X2) with for example igmburn.

If you don´t know how to unpack the files. Just download Winar and rightclick the first file in the folder (ws2gmsp.r00) and choose ""extract here""..

But that is of course if you have a chipped Wii. If you use USB-loader or some other way to play the games I unfortunately do´nt know how you should do to play the game... I have a chipped console myself I does´nt have a clue how to get the game to work on other consoles.. :P
But just do as I explained above to get the ISO-file. As for getting the programs needed for extracting/burning Google is your friend. :)"
,loolssons,2010-06-10T21:40Z,works fine... thanks..
,totomas,2010-06-12T19:25Z,"Works great with Wiikey. I updatet the system when asked, and it worked perfectly. Many thanks again, Markuf."
,neon_pirate,2010-06-13T16:09Z,"Works fine with wasabi chip, 4,2e. Just extracted and burnt using ubuntu 10.04. Thanks."
,zurichch,2010-06-13T22:08Z,"Worked great with wiikey 2, no update was needed for my wii. Burned with Nero 6. Thanks a lot!

@chrisjahn123: I found that Verbatim disks work much better than cheaper brands. Burn at 1x or 2x speeds for more reliable results."
,dognobs,2010-06-14T12:18Z,"Works with UK PAL Wii's drivekey v4 and Wasabi DX, Windows 7, IMG Burn v2.5.1.0 (http://www.imgburn.com/) It is free!, Verbatim burned at x4 (lowest recomended speed), Optiarc dvd-rw ad-7200s ata.
