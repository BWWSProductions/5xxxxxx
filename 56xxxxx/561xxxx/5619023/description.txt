Island Records/UMe will release the definitive career
retrospective of one of the all-time greats of rock `n roll
on June 8, 2010. Entitled Revolutions - The Very Best Of
Steve Winwood, it is a portrait of one of the most
influential musicians in rock history, a singer-songwriter,
peerless vocalist, guitarist and keyboard player.

With tracklistings personally selected by Steve Winwood from
his five decade career, Revolutions - The Very Best Of Steve
Winwood also includes a re-recorded version of Spanish
Dancer.

A child prodigy, Winwood first performed live on stage at the
tender age of 8 in his fathers traditional jazz band, and
joined the Spencer Davis Group at 14. His stunning vocal
style was compared to Ray Charles. He left Spencer Davis to
form Traffic then later teamed up with Eric Clapton in Blind
Faith at the tail-end of the Sixties. Arguably his biggest
successes came with his solo work from the Seventies on.
