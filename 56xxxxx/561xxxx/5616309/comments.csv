,chrisowen,2011-02-06T11:40Z,This is a brilliant film but impossible to get subs for.  I've been trying for months. I'm hoping that this is the one!!!
,chrisowen,2011-02-09T16:50Z,"YES!!! English subs! Humble thanks big time to you Tarja27 and I am on my way to contribute to 2 lions for their effort!
I can't see the film anywhere. I can't rent it and the only place I can buy it is amazon for ÂŁ20!!! For one showing! I'm only sorry I cant pay a reasonable amount to the director and actors etc who more than anyone deserves it the most."
