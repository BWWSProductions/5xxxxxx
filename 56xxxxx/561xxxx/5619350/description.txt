"This Is Why We Stay"

While the heat is on Tommy to find the elusive Magic 
Man, a skittishly fearful Rachel wants to flee 
Haplin because of her kidnapping experience. The 
pressure she gets from John Haplin to remember her 
ordeal upsets her even more. And in Merritt Grieves' 
quest to find out about Rachel's kidnapping, he 
reveals a long-kept secret to her. Meanwhile Det. 
Hobbs is convinced that Greggy Stiviletto knows who 
severed the hand that was found in a loaf of bread 
at the Our Daily bakery; Henley returns the goat-
handled hammer to Peggy Haplin for a large sum of 
money, but in the process gets a real feel for the 
reach of the town matriarch's overwhelming power; 
and Georgia and Andrew's blissful day in the woods 
takes a shocking turn.

Enjoy :)
