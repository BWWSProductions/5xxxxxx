Yes."
,jon4fun,2010-06-10T20:02Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Also, thanks again for the Giga PACK upload. I've gotten a couple of movies out of that I had been wanting to see.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-10T21:21Z,"@Jon: Be aware that this is Matroska container and not mp4 one. These are absolutely same video and audio tracks, with absolutely unchanged encoding - just muxing has been done to .mkv and not .mp4. Re-muxing (if needed) is simple procedure and needs ten seconds. It is my primary response to newest threats about moving my 272p movies to Handhelds 'cause I ""do not belong here"".
Well, I am not aware of any Matroska capable Handheld..."
,lilars26,2010-06-10T22:22Z,"Thanks 20-40.
Sounds like a good one."
,blu-momo,2010-06-11T05:38Z,"Why do they want your 272p encodings to be listed in Handhelds section? 

I watch your movie uploads in my 17 inch LCD monitor and is awesome. "
,jon4fun,2010-06-11T16:48Z,"Hi 20-40,
Not a problem with it being .mkv, I've got the apps to do the conversion easily.
If this is what you have to do to get around any [box] TPB wants to put you in then go for it.

Cheers
Jon"
,the_shroud,2010-06-11T17:09Z,"@blu-momo: I watch it on 37in LCD and 20-40's 272s are still awesome.

@20-40 I've heard amazing reviews about Unthinkable starring Sam L. Jackson. Saw some huge files on TPB claiming from BluRay. Will u consider encoding this one for us? 
Thx. U're awesome"
,jon4fun,2010-06-12T15:32Z,"@ the_shroud - 20-40 has already released Unthinkable. You have to go to his GIGA Pack and follow instructions. The movie you want is in the 'non-upped 272p section'

Cheers
Jon"
