[V],twentyforty,2010-06-08T12:24Z,"@hkoraddi: I don't know yet. I have PrisM 1.34 GB waiting from yesterday, but I've seen today Noir reencode of 700 MB.
I got Boy.2010 NZ 1.37 GB screener few minutes ago, something I have been looking for at least three months. Boy goes first.
I am in process of downloading first CAM of Get.Him.to.the.Greek 937 MB (Jonah Hill, Russel Brand) and even if it's 100% shitty, I am eager to watch it and see if something could be done.
So... busy-busy and I can promise nothing."
