Located in Eastern Turkey and considered as the eighth wonder of the ancient world, Mount Nemrud has been a source of mystery and debate for more than 2000 years; ever since Antiochos of Kommagene chose it as his burial sanctuary. With the use of never-before seen archival footage of excavations, on-site interviews with scholars, 3-D computer animations, and superb battle re-enactments, the film traces the history of the Mount Nemrud sanctuary and its builder, Antiochus the Great of Kommagene.
