About the Seminar
9/11 and 7/7. Two days that changed our world. Two events. Several similarities. Do you question the official stories regarding these so called "terrorist attacks"?. Are you labeled "a conspiracy theorist" for simply having questions and pointing out evidence to the contrary? Many advocates of the government line regarding these two events will simply not consider alternative views against what they have been told is true and instead stubbornly repeat the media mantra of "Islamic extremism is to blame" no matter what piece of alternative material is presented to them.

Using material gathered from news outlets, government spokespeople, intelligence agencies and other official sources we will consider the many fundamental and concurrent elements of the official viewpoints regarding 9/11 & 7/7 and piece together, bone by bone, the anatomy of attack.
