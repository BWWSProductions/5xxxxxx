The stranger

*Thats it I think* 

^^But before that I'm out for a while after Green Zone^^"
,kanha,2010-06-11T05:36Z,"the Harry potter movies r already uploaded by 'YIFY' http://thepiratebay.org/user/YIFY/
at the same quality (720p) & small size.
so i think u can save lots of time, if u skip those 6 movies.....and u can upload the classics & other movies......
also the stranger is also done by 'YIFY' in 720p....

so plz upload the classics.

thank u for u'r uploads......."
