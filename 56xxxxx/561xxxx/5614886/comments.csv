[V],mothergoose56,2010-06-09T05:21Z,"Got some space on a remote box with a faster pipeline than I normally have access to. It will also allow me to finally do some archives (or try again I should say) but I wouldn't expect them for a little bit. Also, I did mention it once already but the goose is flying next week and will miss a few days - I will give a heads up at the start of the week. Also working on adding the ability to jump channels easier if I need to grab non-202 content. Remember I do all this because I ""steal"" others rips, or at least am accused of it. "
