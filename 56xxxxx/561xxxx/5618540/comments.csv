If you find it slow, you have above some links from were you can download Windows Live Essentials 4 Beta (Build 15.3.2688.420) a lot faster.

But you have to replace the * with an e"
,twismuk,2010-06-11T00:08Z,"Any news on a patch yet?? This has been out in the wild for a few days now. BTW, this is the genuine thing."
,dannykard,2010-06-11T00:30Z,"The people who made the first crack for WLM, said that this time the security was strengthened."
,didithu,2010-06-11T07:54Z,"This isnot 15.3....but only 15.2....
There is no such leak 15.3. on the Web yet my dear!"
,dannykard,2010-06-11T08:21Z,"@didithu See it yourself, it was leaked on 9 of June by a Portuguese from LiveBetas and if you check the properties of the program or http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7229/windowslivemessenger153.png you will see that it's really 15.3"
,didithu,2010-06-12T08:19Z,"That was a screenshot, not the leek per se as ur title announced!"
,dannykard,2010-06-12T15:35Z,The screenshot is from the WLE that is on this torrent.

DUDE, this IS the genuine thing! Download it and see! ffs. 

Anyway.... on a more productive note, any news of a patch or workaround yet to get messenger up and running so I can check out the social intergration??"
,dannykard,2010-06-12T17:47Z,"Until now, theres no patch for Windows Live Messenger, but I heard that Microsoft it's going to release the Beta in 10 days "
,korupt2009,2010-06-14T01:56Z,"does anyone have a newer version of this, as versions after this have no restrictions or security measures for messenger and anyone can sign in."
,twismuk,2010-06-21T13:15Z,"This is doing my little british head in!!!

I cannot believe that no1 has patched this yet. (I'm not capable so don't look to me for help!)

Microsoft have been rehashing this for soooo long and even waiting till the end of this week is too long.

Has anyone come across a later build yet... I hear  15.3.2838.0614 is around but I can't find a copy... it was aparently here (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5446237/Windows_Live_Wave_4) but it's dead!!! :-/

anyone got any news.... at all??? C'mon people... "
