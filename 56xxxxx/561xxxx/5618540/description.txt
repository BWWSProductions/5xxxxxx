In 9 of June, it was leaked from a Portuguese source a new Windows Live Essentials build. This build as the number 15.3.2688.420 and it's the most recent build until today (10 of June).

It was tested with ESET Smart Securityâ„¢ 4.2.40.10, and theres no malware at all in this software.

Until now, there's no crack, so it's impossible to login on Windows Live Messenger, but the other programs in this suite work well without your credentials :)


Here it's a proof that isn't fake: http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7229/windowslivemessenger153.png
