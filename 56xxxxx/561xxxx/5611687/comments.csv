,lal_mirch,2010-06-07T09:30Z,UPDATE:If you're using this on the reloaded version...there's no need of addidng the .reg file to your registry but if you're using the directplay versions...i reccomend you to use .reg file... note : the .reg file is 32-bit and the directory is c:\\Program Files\Rockstar Games\EFLC

,spmt,2010-11-26T23:35Z,to save the game you have to accept to create new profile and read the terms of rights that will appear below and at the end of these terms will appear in blue color option to create a profile offline. And since this can save your game in good.
