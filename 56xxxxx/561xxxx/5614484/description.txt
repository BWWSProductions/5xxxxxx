Notes::::::::::::::::::
where to start :hmmm: well 1stly, cut video up into 6 parts straightening the bad part of the angle, trying not lose
much picture, camera moved around quite alot, couldnt do much considering already been cropped when i got it, the ar
seemed to change throughout the movie, so tried to fix most of that without cropping the picture to much... then
filtered video, colors seemed to vary from some blur, to some heavy red, pretty much got it all looking around same.
the audio is pretty poor, even for cam not really much can do with it, had to sync the audio which was not very easy
at all several cuts, not easiest to sync either....overall video is easily wacthable, audio is not great...
