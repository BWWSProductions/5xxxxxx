Neil Sedaka (born March 13, 1939) is an American pop singer, pianist, and songwriter. His career has spanned over 50 years, during which time he has written many songs for himself and others, often working with lyricist Howard Greenfield.
Singer, songwriter, and pianist Neil Sedaka enjoyed two distinct periods of commercial success in two slightly different styles of pop music: first, as a teen pop star in the late '50s and early '60s, then as a singer of more mature pop/rock in the '70s.
In both phases, Sedaka, a classically trained pianist, composed the music for his hits, which he sang in a boyish tenor. And throughout, even when his performing career was at a low ebb, he served as a songwriter for other artists, resulting in a string of hits year in and year out, whether recorded by him or someone else. For himself, he wrote eight U.S. Top Ten pop hits,
including the chart-toppers "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do," "Laughter in the Rain," and "Bad Blood".

Neil Sedaka is another one of all those "oldies" artists where the compilation albums by far outnumber the original studio albums. Here is one and I can understand if you miss one or two songs. Maybe someone else can help us to get more Sedaka in FLAC?
