,ChIlDrEnSLiMbO,2010-07-05T22:12Z,"It's got a Virus haha, Norton 360 picked it up straight away. Oh and, it won't install, something to do with 'SetupREAL.bin' not being found. Oh well."
,demonicperdition,2011-05-23T21:15Z,"It's a great game. Not all games dealing with warfare of this type should be by creative assembly, some other developers should try as well. Sure i love Medieval but this game is good as well. Thanks extremezone, it was easy to install. Whoever thinks its a virus is a moron."
,Elipic,2012-05-12T00:24Z,"Crash's when trying to play a game,only thing you can do is play the tutorial."
