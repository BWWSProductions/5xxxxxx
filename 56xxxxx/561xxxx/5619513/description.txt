PLOT: A tragic tale of an Asian youthâ€™s gang life in South East Los Angeles, set during the mid 80â€™s to the early 90s.

Juwan Chungâ€™s â€œBabyâ€ captures the crime, violence and drug abuse involved with Asian street gangs. David Huynh does a great job playing the role of â€œBabyâ€ a motherless, poverty stricken teen who encounters a world of danger while roaming the streets of Monterey Park and Alhambra. You mess with one you mess with the rest is a good way to describe this movie.The cast gives an outstanding performance that brings the movie to life! This is one one of my favorite movies of all time â€œBabyâ€ is the Asian Boyz in the Hood. An action packed movie not to be missed!
