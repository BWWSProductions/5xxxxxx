CBDA Addendum DD European comics
(for future scanlation purposes)

*********************************

Enjoy!

Here's all the European Donald Duck comics by Carl Barks
that can be used for scanlation.

I unpacked most of the comics by changing .cbr to .rar
and then used winrar software.  Then the comics were
sorted into Carl Barks library sets. Mostly.

You can see which comics would be good for scanlation in the 
request list that has a star next to the story.

I still need to go through Set 9 and 10 to confirm
which European DD comics would be suitable for scanlation.
The CBDA comics scan request list will be updated as I go 
along.

It's a big project for me just to do one comic.
So, if someone would like to do one, then post a message and
then a download link when ready. Thanks!



Set 9 will be ready in 2-3 weeks.

*************

I am still putting together set 6,9-12.

I found 20 HQ comics in Italian for Set 9.
Then I found 50 HQ comics in German, which has comics
for Set 9, 10 and other stories.
So, if I can't find an english HQ comic for Set 9,
then I have the option to do a scanlation.

1 page scanlated takes me 20-30 minutes!
The titles and sound effects words take the most time.
(Tekton pro ex and Tahoma (italic), 20 pts, bold)

I'm not sure if I can find the patience to do any of the
longer stories such as Rug Riders or Luck of the North.

Maybe a group scanlating project?
I can upload an organized un-scanlated italian and 
german DD comics, if anybody's interested.
I'm hoping that more recent english scans show
up though.


If I get any longer stories scanlated, then
I will include them in the final CBDA complete set gigatorrent

**********

The excellent free disney comics website is available if you just
want to read the un-cropped comics online.

Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent
scans of wdc&s stories. It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.

The CBDA collection will be complete, 
but if you can find better scans than posted within this 
collection, then please leave a message and post up your comic scans.

I will update this request list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
