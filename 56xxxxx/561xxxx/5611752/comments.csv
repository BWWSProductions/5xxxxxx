,kaarma33,2010-06-07T09:56Z,"Pirate bay was not uploading the file folder of comics properly, so I packed the comics into one .iso file.  You can type the .iso to .rar and unpack the files with Winrar software.

Some recommendations for scanlation.  But, I'm not an expert.

I use paint.net sofware for scanlation.
Text settings are Tekton pro ex and Tahoma (italic), 20 pts, bold, but you can see what works best for you.

I've tried copying text from the original into the european comics and that sometimes works.  But, the scanlation looks better with typed out text with paint.net.  The trickiest part is the sound effects words and the main titles.  I do so-so at that.

To convert the jpeg files back into .cbr (comic book reader format:

1. put all the jpegs into one folder
2. use winrar sofware to compress the folder into one .rar file.  
Necessary Winrar settings:
 check that compression method is ""best"" 
and check ""put recovery record"" 
and ""test archived files"" 
3. type .rar to .cbr
4. install comic display software

There you go!"
,peterdev2,2010-06-07T17:34Z,"Looking forward to set 11 and set 12, any idea when they will be up?"
,kaarma33,2010-06-08T00:09Z,"I'm giving myself 2-3 weeks per set because I notice the faster I try to get this done the more I have to go back and make corrections.
So, Set 11 and 12 are likely to be available by Sept/Oct 2010.

I've completed reviewing 5 of 61 comics for Set 9.  Set 6 is going to be done next and then Set 10 with Set 11 and 12 last.  Then a final gigatorrent once it looks like all the comics are sorted out.

Important note:

The CBDA addendum set is a untranslated/unscanlated assortment of unpacked comics organized into Carl Barks library sets for future scanlation purposes.  If you would like to see the original complete European comics, then go over to rapid4me and search for ""donald duck album""."
,kaarma33,2010-06-09T09:38Z,"Alternatively to scanlation, B&W stories can be re-colored.  

I made a re-coloring attempt on a B&W one pager, FC178 Machine Mix up
The re-colored one pager turned out pretty well and so I'm including it in the one pagers .cbr in Set 9.

I still have CBL volume 1 and 3 to get B&W scans of the non-updated stories.  But, after spending over an hour on just one page, FC178 Machine mix up, I doubt I would take on a whole story like ""Seals are so Smart""."
,kaarma33,2010-06-21T03:20Z,"BiWeekly Update:

Set 9 is not quite ready.
20 out of 63 comics done.

Set 9 will have as a bonus 22 updated comics for the other sets, One pagers comic collection and Donald Duck Abbeville ReConstruction (book 1 of Abbeville trilogy).   That's ready to go!

I also finished organizing the Fine Art of DD pictures collection as well as the rest of CB's paintings.

Set 6 will include as a bonus some B&W scans from CBL Set 1 and 3 for future re-coloring projects and Uncle Scrooge Abbeville ReConstruction (book 2 of Abbeville trilogy).

I'm slowing down due to developing some repetitive strain pain in my right arm.  "
,kaarma33,2010-07-06T00:38Z,"BiWeekly Update:

Set 9 has been all sorted through and request list updated.  It's just a matter of cropping.
23 more comics to get Set 9 done by the end of this week.

I've just been very busy working and shopping for a car, since my car was rear-ended 2 weeks ago."
,kaarma33,2010-07-14T17:30Z,"BiWeekly UPDATE:nnI found 1-133 of 134 issues of Netherland comics series: De Beste VerHalen Donald Duck.  Most of these Netherlands DD comics are colored much nicer than the German and Italian DD comics and can be used for scanlation purposes to update the Dell and Gold Key comics.  So, I was going to post up these comics, but there is some problem about submitting new bittorrents on piratebay.  nn20 more comics to fix up and then set 9 will be available by next week.nNow that I have a car, I can get back to the CBDA project."
,kaarma33,2010-07-30T18:39Z,"BiWeekly UPDATE:

I have 3 more ten pagers to finish for Set 9 and one updated comic scan to do.  So, set 9 will probably ready to be posted by tomorrow. 

Set 10 is about 1/3 checked over for new versions of comics.  I haven't cropped any  comics in that set yet.  Then I was thinking of doing Set 10 next and then Set 6, 11 and 12.  Lastly, a bittorent will be made of the whole CBDA with updated comics in place.

The Piratebay server is still under construction, so I am unable to update the CBDA request list.  The request list will show which issues can be scanlated from the two European DD comics collections that have been already posted.  

If anybody would like to do a scanlation of the European DD comic or re-colour a B&W DD comic, then post a pm and share, thanks!

See Set 9 for updated request list."
,serati,2011-07-05T23:17Z,Thank you so much kaarma33 for the great torrent. But I'm sorry to say there is hardly any seed. I shall be very grateful if you kindly reseed from 20:30 (8:30 P.M.) GMT to 02:30 (2:30 A.M.) GMT just once. I have 2mbps connection and so hopefully it'll be downloaded in the 6 hrs. Thank you.
