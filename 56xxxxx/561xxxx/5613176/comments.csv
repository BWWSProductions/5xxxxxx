[V],r3dcat,2010-06-22T07:24Z,"@thekid123: Do a google search for ""002 error Super Mario Galaxy 2"" ... from the quick look that I did it looks like your Wii might be missing a required iOS to play the game ... to safely upgrade I recommend this guide ->  http://gwht.wikidot.com/upgrade  ... I have used ""Method 3: Safe 4.2 Updater"" successfully on two Wii's."
