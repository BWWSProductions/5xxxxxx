Here is a coast to coast am from 1997, July 16th, a full 4 hours and 50 minutes of audio, however this was a live tape so the commercials and such are still included.

In the show Dr. Paglini talks about her practice of Natural Magic, the importance of purity and positive use, and what Natural Magic is. Dr. Paglini also discusses the dangers of magic, how it will come back on you ten fold if you misuse it against others or for negative reasons. 

Some say for the time this was one of Art Bells best shows, I thought it was very informative

Thanks to Saint&Sinner from TBP for the original audio

There is MP3 and a RA Real Audio file both contain the same show
