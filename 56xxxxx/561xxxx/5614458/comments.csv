being a cam of a comedy, you get the inevitable laughter of others. but, you cant be picky seeing as how you are getting this movie for free. all in all, this is definitely the best copy, currently, on the net."

,ExhamPriory,2010-07-01T04:48Z,"I am pumped to see this movie! At first I thought it looked dumb (spinoff and all, even though aldous snow was my favorite part of Forgetting Sarah Marshall),
but in EVERY copy i've looked at the comments for, the main underlying problem is everyone laughing. That is a good sign isn't it? lol Like I said I am stoked to see this. Probably will wait for a dvd/BD rip though. Ha need the full effect"
,ExhamPriory,2010-07-01T04:49Z,"Great movie! Watch for free at www.fr......

LoL just kidding sorry! XD
haha"

Though the copy really isn't that great.
I'd wait until a better copy hits the net to be honest.
