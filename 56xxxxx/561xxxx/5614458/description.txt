NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Get Him To The Greek

Sources used was a russian and the audio off the WBZ cam release .....Thanks to all.
Right audio.....this had to be cut and resynced,the quality is ok in some places but crap in others.
Seems to get better though after the first 3-4mins....
Anyway got it synced the best we could but have noticed around the 23min mark theres some slight oos....but
it kicks back in.....sorry,if it was a better source both video and audio,we'd go back and fix it but....
Video,well were do we start......over bright it light scenes....too dark in dark scenes,faces looked sunburnt,weird colouring
throughout the movie etc....
Anyway ,we've done all we could to this so ........but if you can wait then wait otherwise enjoy
