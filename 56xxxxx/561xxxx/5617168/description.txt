A story of redemption and forgiveness.

It's a classic tale of deception and double cross when a deal goes bad between a ruthless criminal, Rome (Eric Roberts) and his partner John (David A. R. White), who skips town with the bait money from their scam. John seeks out the help of his estranged twin brother Jeremiah (also David White), an aspiring pastor. But he arrives to find Rome mistakenly dragging his Jeremiah away, thinking it was him.

Now the preacher and the con man are thrust into each other's lives, and while Jeremiah is forced to help Rome pull off a million dollar scam, John eases into the world of the church man, and starts finding ways to make a profit. But Jeremiah escapes from Rome, and soon finds himself face to face with his estranged brother.

In the end, only one will emerge to settle the ultimate score with Rome.
