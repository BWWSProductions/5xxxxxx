,JoeMahma,2010-09-02T02:48Z,"Thanks for the download.

However, I noticed an issue. Im 9 episodes in. Episode 10 is an mkv file and its not loading correctly. The 4 or 5 seconds of the file that Im able to get to play, appear to be an NCIS-Los Angeles episode instead of NCIS. The file is also 1.5 gig by itself, while all the other files are 350 meg. 

Thanks for the rest of the episodes."

,scuddlebuddy,2011-10-16T20:32Z,I downloaded this and its great. Except that episode 3 has some dumb subtitles on it. Are they on the video or can i turn them off?
,asleep42,2012-04-21T23:52Z,"I had the same problem with episode 10 as JoeMahma, using VLC player. I can normally play .mkv files without a hitch, but with this one I got a few seconds, and then the vid stopped. I found the episode in another torrent thankfully. All the other episodes work fine and are nice quality - thanks!"
