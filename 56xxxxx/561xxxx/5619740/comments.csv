I wont get into all that Religion Vs Atheism. All I believe is that we'll see the day when everything shall be made crystal clear. Till then, cherish your self for being just another kind of Monkey and let others believe what they believe."

Ok. Letâ€™s take your assumption of me being a sheep, trying to stay close with others in the herd, but youâ€¦ Coming again and again here, posting comments after comments, what does that make you? A mere barking dog trying to control that herd..? Well thatâ€™s what you are not!
My friend, I would like to ask the same question here and that is; have you studied all 28000+ religions and came to a conclusion that all of them are just human fantasies and there is no such thing as GOD? I donâ€™t think so!
Iâ€™ve at least studied Christianity, Hinduism and Islam and I must say I donâ€™t have a single doubt that Islam is the true religion. And remember; itâ€™s not only a religion; itâ€™s a complete way of life!

Itâ€™s my humble request that you get a copy of Quran and study it with an open mind.

My apologies for any offense I may have caused. Peace."

I would suggest this 3part series from BBC, it's called 'BBC-Science and Islam' and its available on TPB. Please do take some time out so you may have better understanding!"
