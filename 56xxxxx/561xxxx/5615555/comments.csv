,adreanis,2010-06-09T21:32Z,how do I make keygen to work >>> tried terminal and gets stuck...
,concombre,2010-06-10T10:32Z,"1: open a terminal windows
2: write ?chmod777? and drag&drop the keymaker on the terminal window, then press enter
3: after that, just drag&drog the keymaker into the terminal again, press enter
4: DONE"
,mohawktj,2010-06-10T17:06Z,"that didn't work at all.. ""chmod777"" is not a command that terminal recognizes, and when I try to access the file without the preceding command it just says ""permission denied"""
,brazcafe,2010-06-10T17:30Z,chmod 777
,xenu678,2010-06-11T05:37Z,"Um, there is never a need to CHMOD 777 ANYTHING. Why are you telling people to do this? Is this malware?"
