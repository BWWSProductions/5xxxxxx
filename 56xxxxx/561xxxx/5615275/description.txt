[show description from the Infowars web site]


Alex talks with international best selling author Jeffrey M. Smith about Russian scientific research demonstrating that genetically modified food leads to sterility in second and third generations. Smith's first book Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies about the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods Youâ€™re Eating became the worldâ€™s best-selling and # 1 rated book on GMOs. His second book, Genetic Roulette: The Documented Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Foods, is the authoritative work that presents irrefutable evidence that GMOs are harmful. Both are available at Alex Jones' Infowars Store.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
