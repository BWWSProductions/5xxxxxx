http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182896/usercomments?filter=love

Director:Nicolas Jolliet
Writers:Azaniah (screenplay),Nicolas Jolliet (screenplay)
Genre:Drama

Plot:

Inspired by the reggae band Psycho Key, a Caribbean weed farmer journeys beyond his home in the St. Lucia mountains in search of spiritual wisdom.

Full Synopsis: HARVEST is a "musical-docu-drama". The film tells the story of a Rasta man trying to leave his island to see the world and become a musician. For island people it is very difficult to obtain a visa, let alone make enough money for flights and expenses.

Jahweve decides to grow weed in the mountains, to obtain the means to follow his dreams of traveling and becoming a touring musician. But his mission is not an easy one, since the army helicopters are flying around the island frequently arresting farmers, and burning their marijuana fields.

The movie was shot primarily in St. Lucia, using local people as actors. There is also footage which was shot in India and europe. Most of the dialogues were improvised in Patois. Intertwined with the dialogue scenes, we see the band on stage, surrounded by the movie itself, performing the songs that tell us the story.

What a great concept!, 9 November 2009
10/10
Author: Paul Daniels from Toronto, Canada

I watched Harvest and I thought it was fantastic. What a creative approach. I am a big fan of Psycho Key and actually flew to Geneva to see their multimedia production. I understand that Jolliet's initial purpose of making a musical film was to have his band Psycho Key interact with it on stage. That idea alone was very impressive.

But when I saw the completed film, I was blown away by his success in intertwining the storytelling with the music. The songs continue to carry the story through their lyrics. What a brilliant, unique concept. I applaud Jolliet's work, as I was taken on a wild ride watching Harvest, and there was no need for any substances to take me to that 'trippy state'.

The intent of Harvest is obviously not 'plot-heavy', and I don't think the goal was for the audience to deeply relate to the characters, but simply to enjoy watching them. What stands out the most in the film is entertainment of the band. Their music is very powerful and hypnotic. But there are definitely some very intense, well-written dialogue scenes.

Harvest was Jolliet's first film, and again, I commend him on his work. He has proved himself as a talented filmmaker, and I hope he will continue on that path .
