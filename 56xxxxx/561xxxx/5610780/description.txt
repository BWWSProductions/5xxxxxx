After five documentaries exploring the DNA of the rock 'n' roll band and the roles in the band, from lead singer through guitarist to drummer, the series goes live with Jonathan Ross at BBC Television Centre as the nation decides who the greatest rock 'n' rollers ever are.
Jonathan is joined by a panel of rock 'n' roll experts - Lauren Laverne of 6 Music and Kenickie; Stewart Copeland of The Police; and Mark Radcliffe, narrator of the documentary series, Radio 2 presenter and member of The Shirehorses - to debate the UK's favourites, accompanied by a live audience, a house band and some of the great rock 'n' roll songs.
The programme follows an online vote on the I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band! Website, with the top three bands, singers, guitarists, drummers and bass players unveiled and debated on the show. Advocates including Al Murray, Suggs, Mark Ronson and Sharleen Spiteri speak on behalf of their favourites and lock horns with the panel of experts, with the nation then invited to vote on each category. The results are announced at the end of the show, crowning the nation's favourite band of all time and unveiling a fantasy band consisting of the nation's favourite singer, guitarist, drummer and bass player.
