At around 1 hour and 36 minutes into the film, it skips a couple of frames and puts the sound out of sync for the rest of the film.

,Ravenwald,2011-03-16T01:03Z,"If you downloaded this and simply want to correct the audio after the frame skip, the audio correction is round about -800 milliseconds. You can fine-tune it from there, but I was fine with a general shift."
