,treetops422,2011-03-21T07:37Z,"Hey I love the quality in these. I watched the original fma and loved it. I do not like to many animes. Anyways I was wondering if I can download the english audio somewhere, the dubbed episodes are only a third in size of these ones so I am assuming the quality is weak.

So where can I get some english audio ?"
,treetops422,2011-03-21T07:39Z,Also if you know where to get audio from the 12+ brother eps that would be great I just started watching brotherhood.
