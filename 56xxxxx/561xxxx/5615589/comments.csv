,widmanct,2010-06-09T23:44Z,"I've been downloading this since last night. I'd really love it if someone could seed a little bit.

As soon as I get it I'll scan it and rate quality."
,widmanct,2010-06-10T00:05Z,"You know people aren't doing their part when you've downloaded 2.5gb and uploaded 10.5gb...

Return the favor people!!"
,sic.root,2010-06-10T02:06Z,"I hear you, I been seeding at 100+kbs And im the only seeder. This is bullshit people!"
,zhdason,2010-11-07T02:34Z,"Looks and sounds good.  

I'm sure most people don't care, but it would be nice if the end credits to each episode were not cut off.  Perhaps it saves on a few extra KBs to download over the entire season but it can't be that much.  

Other than that little issue, it's great!  Thanks!!!"
