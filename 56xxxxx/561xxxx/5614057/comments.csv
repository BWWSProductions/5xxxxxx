,Silkenrune,2010-06-08T20:53Z,"Hey Buds I stuck with it untill the torrent died, although I never did get over 50% I did notice at least 2 others start to seed and stop after a few days.

   I found another torrent on Demonoid for season 1. I would like to see other seasons though^^. I wish there was some way to talk to you in private.

   If you do decide to start season 2 im all over it! I suggest you mabe just one or 2 torrents this time around, mabe you had to much on the go for your provider to handle?

    If you wish to talk at me in private mabe make an e mail addy at yahoo.com , its free and you can delete it just as easily, post it here if you do. Ill announce myself as Silkenrune.

,tonexxx69,2010-06-23T19:30Z,"I was downloading this torrent, then it dried up at about 50.4%.

Had to complete the rest on a private tracker, but i renamed it, and am now seeding to you guys.

Please don't leech & run, i'm using a HTC Hermes as a modem, and only seem to be managing about 40KBps upload, so your help is very much needed.

I'll keep seeding till someone with a better connection has it, although as i'm uploading over a mobile network, it won't be 24/7.."
,ITRUN,2010-07-13T20:11Z,Seems to be well seeded now. Getting good speeds from this torrent.
,fredblog,2011-01-30T02:01Z,I'm seeding this for the love of great art.
,smudge2007,2011-05-16T09:37Z,Hi - Do you have series 8 of minder?
