,javialacarga,2010-06-19T20:01Z,"Quality is good.

Does anybody know where to find accurate subtitles for these versions of the episodes? I'm trying the usual sites but none of those match. It's like the length of the episodes is just a bit different, and it's not easy to make them match with programs such as Subtitle Workshop"

Download at your own risk...you\'ve been warned!!!!n

,jm413d,2011-02-14T20:27Z,"Dunno about quality yet but wanted to comment about dl speed... My AVERAGE is 1.6 Mb/s and it hit 2.3Mb/s a few times and is staying pretty steady right now at 1.6-1.8 Mb/s... If you aren't getting speeds like that then upgrade from your cheap ass internet service and configure your torrent client correctly... You can't use something out of the box and expect it to work how you want it on the first try, you have to tweak it a bit to get everything set up correctly... A simple Google search will give you tips on how to configure your setup. Also if you have anything short of Broadband internet, we don't care about you sorry... Well DSL maybe but that's pushing it... Countless times I have asked someone who was complaining about speed what type of internet they had and got numerous answers of ""Dial-up"" LMFAO Here's your sign. "
,sic.root,2011-03-23T06:57Z,"jm413d - Thanks for the comment, hope to hear your post on the quality. Also glad to see it downloaded fast for you.

,RommerShinto,2011-03-26T16:52Z,uhm just a question I know its a stupid one but I really don't know how cuz when I opened the file it goes to windows media player and its only shows the visualizer ( used for music or sounds ) I cant see the video itself help pls if there are things that I havent done to make me watch this in doideo form.
,gbthecat,2011-04-29T06:28Z,Perfect! Thank you!
,hotnachostyles,2012-05-02T12:11Z,"@jm413d:

We don't all live in the first-world, so stop being a pompous knob.

Go bellyache somewhere else about how fast your pizza heats up in the microwave (and it's still soggy, like, really, oh-my-gawd!), or whatever other major problems you have with the world.


(ps- ahem, thanks for the upload, the mistress will be happy)"
