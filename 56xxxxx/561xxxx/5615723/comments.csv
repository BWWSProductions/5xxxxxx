,DogNo7,2010-06-12T03:15Z,"For how many years are we going to have to continue to hear whiney assed liberals attack Bush 43?

Get more current hollywood!  We have a whole new President that is screwing up even worse than the last one!

After all, Bush 43 will not come up for election again, so hollywood could be truly socially conscious and reveal how the current US President has betrayed all sides with historic incompetence, and an approval rating worse than George Bush over Katrina.

Come on Hollywood, bash Obama on the Gulf!

Or come up with something else.  Watching some whiney assed piece of shit that rehashes Bush 43 hatred is less interesting than going to the laundromat."
,limited305,2010-06-13T07:57Z,"@DogNo7 Oh totally, lets not blame BP or any of the people who actually have something to do with it, lets blame the President! Yay for idiocy!"
,DogNo7,2010-06-13T18:46Z,"Idiocy is what this movie exemplifies.

Blaming Obama for the oil spill is no dumber than than saying ""Bush lied"" over Iraq.

The whole premise of this movie is so idiotic, I find it somewhat hypocritical that people are not willing to blame President Obama, if not for the oil spill, he is definitely responsible, by law, for taking control of the relief effort.  So, it is more reasonable to say we would be in better shape with the oil cleanup if the President did a better job in allowing sitting equipment (at the oil spill) to clean up the oil than it is to say, ""bush lied"".

Oil cleanup skimmers, booms, and other equipment are still awaiting permission to help clean up the oil.

So much for the ""environmental"" President.

Can Obama do no ill?  Does he bear no responsibility for any of the problems he has to deal with?

Or is it easier to be irresponsible, blame Bush 43, and just pass one crippling tax bill after another, that will bankrupt the nation, and plunge the world into a worldwide depression?

Get your cardboard for your ""Will work for food"" signs now.  By the end of the current administration, cardboard may be in really short supply.

,DogNo7,2010-06-15T07:15Z,"@seoduder How amusing.  You are arguing against Bush based upon his mental retardation, which suggest intelligence is required for politics.

You should know better.  Politicians rely on emotional people like you, who want to threaten people over simple opinions.

Why don't you leave our nice little country, and go to some Moslem nation where your politicians will gladly behave the way you approve of, and ""By educate I mean stick my size 13's up ur ass you dumb hillbilly f---.""

I must also mention that you resorting to swearing reflects that you are not capable of carrying on a civil conversation.  Such behaviour suggests that maybe you are not as intelligent as you would like to think of yourself as being.

What?  You can't just post any stupid thing and not get called on it?  You are surprised?

I'll give you an address and phone number you can use:

FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Threatening someone with bodily harm is assault in this country, and you should be locked up for public safety.

While you are talking to them, you might also want to mention that the person you threatened with assault pissed you off while you were downloading illegal torrents."

,DogNo7,2010-06-19T20:57Z,"The Truth
There are several quotes.
Most of them come during a time in the Clinton administration when decisions were being made about action against Saddam Hussein and amid concerns about weapons of mass destruction.

We'll take them one at a time.

""One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.
That is our bottom line.""
President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998-Truth!
This was a quote from President Clinton during a presentation at the Pentagon defending a decision to conduct military strikes against Iraq.

""If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear.
We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.""
President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998-Truth!
Bill Clinton went to the Pentagon on this occasion to be briefed by top military officials about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.
His remarks followed that briefing.

""Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.""
Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998-Truth!
This is a quote from Albright during an appearance at Ohio State University by Albright, who was Secretary of State for Bill Clinton.

""He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.""
Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998-Truth!
This was at the same Ohio State University appearance as Madeline Albright. 

""We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate,
air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction
programs.""
Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998-Truth!
According to the U.S. Senate website, the text of this letter was signed by several Senators, both Democrat and Republican, including Senator John McCain and Joseph Lieberman.

""Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.""
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998-Truth!
The text of this statement by Nancy Pelosi is posted on her congressional website.

""Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.""
Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999-Truth!
This was from an appearance Albright made in Chicago.
She was addressing the embargo of Iraq that was in effect at the time and criticism that it may have prevented needed medical supplies from getting into the country.  Albright said, ""There has never been an embargo against food and medicine. It's just that Hussein has just not chosen to spend his money on that. Instead, he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction, and palaces for his cronies.""

""There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs
continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.""
Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001Truth!
The only letter with this quote from December 5, 2001 that we could find did not include the participation of Senator Bob Graham, but it was signed nine other senators including Democrat Joe Lieberman.
It urged President Bush to take quicker action against Iraq.

""We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat t"

,DogNo7,2010-06-21T22:41Z,"As long as people realise that this is a work of fiction, I have no problem.

The above was quoted from a website that has archived ALL of the pinheads in Washington that were party to this delusion.

I am tired of sitting by silently while Hollywood liberals perpetuate a vastly skewed agenda that has nothing to do with the public good.

Hollywood trying to preach morals and whine, ""he lied"", while they continue to engage in murder (oj), prostitution (many many many), and every other form of social depravity known to man, only serves to highlight their own morally deficient behaviour.

If, and when, hollywood actors, directors, and other entertainment professionals adopt some form of moral compass in their own behaviour, maybe then I will consider their political opinions seriously."
,DogNo7,2010-06-23T17:11Z,"Another lame piece of cow's excrement  from a bunch of hypocritical whiners.

Which is worse?  Actors and hollywood people pretending they are moral enough to pass judgment on others?

What about Bill Clinton covering up Cocaine trafficking?  Substantially more evidence exists to back this up, and we don't have any hollywood movies about this, I wonder why...

From an AP story:

Reed was charged with mail fraud for collecting insurance on the plane, but the CIA prevented prosecutors from releasing information they called ""top, top secret,"" about the Rodriguez-North, Southern Air Transport connection. In November 1990, the prosecution admitted they couldn't prosecute Reed without the secret documents and Judge Thiel ordered Reed acquitted on all of the charges.

Allegations of Governor Bill Clinton's extra-marital sexual exploits originated with a 1990 lawsuit by Larry Nichols, a former Arkansas state employee. Nichols was fired by Clinton in 1988 after reporters discovered Nichols had been lobbying on behalf of the Contras from his office as head of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.

The suit claimed that Clinton had lied when he said Nichols was fired because he was phoning the Contras directly from his state office. Nichols claimed he only called Washington to lobby on behalf of the Contras. In the suit, Nichols also revealed the affair between Clinton and office secretary Gennifer Flowers.

The suit was dropped by Nichols on January 25, 1992, after Gennifer Flowers went public with her story of the affair. Nichols told reporters that he decided to drop the suit after meeting with Clinton security chief Buddy Young- the same man who found Terry Reed's missing Piper aircraft at the Mena airport.

According to Arkansas Committee researcher Mark Swaney, Nichols said that Young had told him he was a ""dead man."" prompting Nichols to drop the suit. In public, Nichols says he dropped the suit because ""the media have made a circus out of this thing and it's gone way too far.""

In court documents recently released by Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, it has been revealed that Jackson Stephens, a billionaire banker in Little Rock, Arkansas, and one of presidential candidate Bill Clinton's main supporters, may have played a key role in setting up the illegal purchase by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) of two American banks.

So Bill Clinton lied?  I am horrified.

Oh yes, what about when Clinton went on National Television and told the world that he had never had sex, with that woman...

Hmm.  Bill Clinton lied, and no films...

Gee, hollywood is really looking out for me.

Seems interesting that Bill Clinton was involved in the cover up of cocaine trafficking by the CIA through the Mena airport in Arkansas when the Iran Contra hearings were going on.

Wake up, all politicians are your enemy, and this film is a piece of pure propaganda to pit ""us"" vs ""them"".  As long as America is distracted by this shell game, politicians will do whatever they want to further their political agenda, maintain their grip on the throat of the American taxpayer, and transplant American government with World Government.

Riddle for the day, ""How can you tell a politician is lying?""

His mouth is open.

,DogNo7,2010-06-30T17:30Z,"Why politics?

Because this movie is political!

Some of us are tired of watching professional liars (actors) claim omniscient powers of political prowess.

Many people get their political opinions from movies, and with hollywood continually pouring excrement into people's minds, it is obligatory to point out that the actors you worship are shallower than the average man on the street.

Also, some might get the idea that this movie is a news report, not an act of fiction or propaganda, which would be mistaken thinking indeed."

Golly.  I would think that someone who works for the Times would know proper capitalization, spelling, not to mention character spacing, but then again, that would mean that I don't think you are lying (I do), or it would mean that the education you received, or your attention to detail, leaves much to be desired.

WMD's are such an old story.  All intelligence indicated that not only the U.S., but the U.K. and other intelligence agencies, were all of the impression that Saddam had WMD's.

The real story is not that President George W. Bush lied, it is that Saddam Hussein purposefully lied, and did everything to perpetuate the rumor of WMD's to the world, because of his concern with arch foe Iran.

Get your history from the only reliable source:  Yourself.  Read the news, learn about history, but remember that history is the combination of the original event, and every person's distortion of that event that has been written.

To determine and sift the truth from the lies, rely not on thinktanks, spooges, or political commentators.  These will all lead you astray with whatever they base their opinions and political beliefs on.

To determine the truth, depend on your own good reason, and your God given ability to tell right from wrong, or at least, truth from fiction."
