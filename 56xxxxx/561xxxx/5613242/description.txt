A hidden gem from the Factory back list. The stand out track from this first LP outing is "Restrained in a moment" with its layered sound scape and even deeper layered lyrics. Its also the oldest track (first recorded in 1982, this version from 84)and a live favourite retaining the feel of the period.

On other tracks the producers influence (Peter Hook of New Order) come to the fore alongside his talents as a backing vocalist. 

As with many factory artists promotion was non-existent (you had to find it for yourself) and reviews were equally scarce although a few years later on the London warehouse scene they were often played after dawn as the police turned up!

I think there was a single pressing of 2000 and this RIP is form one of them. As usual played on my Pro-Ject deck, restored in Adobe Audition and presented as a 256kbps mp3.

Share and enjoy (apart from DJs *)
