is it shit quality?

regardless, THX, I like to watch the new episodes ASAP."
,RThsA,2010-06-07T08:08Z,ADDdog compresses down to just enough quality. You'll usually see a very small filesize when there's not a whole bunch of motion.
,OpenMind,2010-06-07T09:00Z,C-W releases are usually noticeably lower quality (especially on my 24inch monitor) but it's worth it for how early they put stuff out and a lot of the time it seems most of the drop is in the colour depth which can be kind of undone using shaders in mpc
