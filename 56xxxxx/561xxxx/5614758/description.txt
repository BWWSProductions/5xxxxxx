Full version with Serials

* The archive contains both versions, 32bit & 64Bit

O&O Defrag puts is a replacement for the standard Windows defragmenter, 
that offers a much advanced set of features. It puts fragmented files together 
and maximizes your system speed and offers five different defragmentation strategies, 
as well as OneButtonDefrag technology for automatic adjustment of the settings best 
fitting for your system. The program can defragment drives manually, or fully automatic 
in the background, keeping your system at peak performance by avoiding build-up of file fragmentation. 
Defragmentation jobs can also be scheduled, using various criteria. Additional features include 
status reports, cluster inspector, command line interface, optional MMC integration, 
boot time defragmentation, special support for mobile systems and more. O&O Defrag solves the 
performance and stability problems of Windows workstations and servers caused by fragmented hard disks. 
Fragmentation is the main cause of significant losses in performance in Windows.
