Audacity Portable 1.2.6
This is one of the best and easiest audio-editing tools I've ever had the pleasure of using and I'm using it frequently to cut/join tracks, adjust volume and other tools on my downloaded mp3's.

PS.
This version of audacity is portable so you can just load it on to a USB-stick or whatever, or just let it be on your HDD.

(No need to Install)

Just Unpack the .rar-file with Winrar or other unpacking tool and execute the .exe-file. 

DS.

Hope you will enjoy this software ass much as I do!
