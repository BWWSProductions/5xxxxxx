Anemonia's debut album, Moonlit Numina. Lyrics :

I- Until Aeonâ€™s Dawn (1:27)

-Instrumental-

 

II- Enchanting Melodies of Eternal Night (6:53)

 

Beyond desertic fields of ice

Monstrous winds claim for their homeland

Defied, everything that stands still

Is hit by the cold in their hearts

Sung is this desolating

Victory, by the dead trees and the

Troubling choirs of tortured wind

Enchanting melodies of the Dark

 

Beyond the magnanimity

Of white snowâ€™s claimed purple gardens

One grand crystal palace was built

Symbol of the ruling of death

Hidden in a crystalline room

Stands the only living flower

Trapped in a magic box of the

Only ice beholder of a spark

 

Lost once more, I donâ€™t know where to go

Lost the sacred memory

I forgot, where am I from?

One broken branch from the grapevine

-chorus-

Lost my only heartâ€™s bed

No where can he rest all peacefully laid

Another lost wanderer was born

How could I lose myself so easily?

-chorus-

 

Behold the magic

From GaÃ¯aâ€™s darkest childs

Relentless lips

Kissing all your sins

 

Seduced, I finally

Stood still against the wind

My heart was not cold

My heart was no more

 

In the realm of Forever-Night,

My one andâ€¦ one and onlyâ€¦ my only heart is lost

 

 

The only thing for me to do is to

Free the last flower from its wicked prison

It has the power to unveil the truth and the honor

But this Forever-Night will last until Aeonâ€™s dawn

 

-chorus-

Beyond snowâ€™s invaded lands

An infant hides and stares at the sky

Covered by the dying clouds

Of greyness and of emptiness

Beyond the Forever-Night

An infant deprived from her heart

Gets up and begins his last walk

Sheâ€™s heading for the crystal palace

 

â€¦ where her last hope still lives

 

 

III- The Quest (5:02)

 

Just a walk, the one, one last hope stands

Forgetting all the rules, refusing to conform

Iâ€™m a prey in the grey

Oh why should I obey?

Youâ€™re lost, in the deep disarray

One last try to one day scream victoryâ€¦ VICTORY!

 

One more lost soul

Now left with no colors

A dead flower

Who never saw summer

 

Where art thou hidden colors?

Thou mystic shades of life

Can a dream still breathe

after dying so many times?

 

Nothing left to give

All yet to be born

Dying rules from Earth

For the rise of my dreams

 

Seeking the Moonlight

Teachings from the sea

Listen to thy heart

And claim thy glory, and sing this song

 

 

One fantastic Quest for a new paradise

 

One day, no more I could give

To this world, like an empty bottle

Tearing my heart for this song

Is just not a routine

 

 

One day, no more I could feel

For this world, when the last hope shall die

The final countdown has begun

But how long will it last?

 

For the love and for the passion beyond the skin

For the burning desire to unveil the mystery

 

From all the pain left with only a stain

Could only be cleaned by the truest loverâ€™s kiss

 

- chorus-

 

One last dream to share

One more soul to harvest

One more try to

One day scream victory

 

Breathing honesty

Bring me close to thee

Dying rules from Earth

For the rise of my dreams

 

 

IV- Pleasures & Satisfaction (3:54)

 

I am not from a gutter

Even though it feels like it

I do not wish to murder

So why should I sing about it?

 

Dragons no more ride their wings

And Iâ€™m not the one lie

Satellite-illusions of stars shining

Makes me want to cry

 

Whatâ€™s the true meaning of Pleasures and Satisfaction?

Whatâ€™s the true feeling of total liberation?

Is a body deserted when it feels no more pain?

Is the heart useless when it no more longs to cry?

 

Oh can the garden of purple gloom totally be conquered?

Or will there forever be a flower somewhere living even if in ice?

 

- chorus-

 

 

 

 

V- The Beginning (5:12)

 

I still forever remember

The first time I heard

Delightful sounds of hope

And the burning rope

 

I could not hide my tears

From this divine beauty

It feels like I have

Never lost myself

 

Waves of passionate tenderness

Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder

Mystical garden growing in the dark

 

 

I still forever remember

The feeling I had,

A rising universe,

Its bewitching dream

 

I discovered

A lost fantasy

Who opened its eyes

And saw the Moonlight

 

- chorus-

 

 

 

VI- Cruel Beauties (4:58)

 

Take my hand

I will never let you fall again

Lay your head on my breast

I need you to feel my beating heart

 

Closelyâ€¦ in youâ€¦

 

So many tears were shed

Like rivers who cannot find rain

So many frozen dreams

Broken by the tortured wind

 

But all this time it was there

The misty sounds of the deep sea

And now by the snow its melody echoesâ€¦ oh oh

Making its way to my ears

 

Never will a snow flake

Lay again in purple gardens

Never will one living wonder

Be all alone again

 

Beyond this Forever-Night

The dead grey fades away

Beyond the nightâ€™s crisped sky

The Moonlight gently smiles

 

- chorus-

Closely into your frail body

 

So many mysteries

Lies in the seaâ€™s Cruel Beauties

So many living wonders

Sing their dreams to others

 

Never will I doubt again

The return of the rain

Never will I feel again

The fear of the Crystal pain

 

Beyond her motherly hands

Is where all the beauty stands

Beyond her comforting breast

My heart found a place to rest

 

VII- Lullaby (3:22)

 

Oh what a night

Dancing with the romantic breeze of spring

Feels like I could fly with my wings

My new purple wings

 

Oh what a site

Dandelions play with me in the park

Feels like my eyes now hold a spark

A new mystic spark

 

Sing once again with me the melancholy

And all the things we cannot see

Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then weâ€™ll see

Just how seldom is our wisdom

 

Oh what a smile

A child has when his daddy comes back from work

The child doesnâ€™t see heâ€™s gone berserk

Thereâ€™s too much work

 

Oh what a scream

A child makes when some monsters shakes its bed

Their teethâ€™s are brown, their eyes are red

And I think it sounds fun

 

- chorus-

 

â€œThe romantic breeze inspires rainbow twirling petals

to dance with me where the Moonlight shinesâ€

 

Oh what a spell

Changes city parks into magic realms?

Letâ€™s not say who is the lovely witch

Behind all of this

 

- chorus-

 

 

 

 

VIII- When Midnight Rings (3:04)

 

Alright, tonight we will climb to the sky

We will ride the stars tonight

 

I flee

And you fly

We fly

Tonight

In the sky

 

Tonight

Weâ€™ll ride the stars

So far

Waiting

Midnight to ring

 

A lullaby for this wonderful night, climbing the stars

A melody that makes the big monsters sleepy

 

Flying

In new born spring

We sing

The hymn

Of new born stars

 

- chorus-

 

A melody playing with the feeling

Of when Midnight Rings

 

A magic kingdom

Unveils to my wide eyes

Revealing to me

How to ride the stars

 

Just hold on tight and

Donâ€™t close your eyes

You will soon see the Moonlight

Nightâ€™s only ray of light

 

IX- Tribal Rite (1:04)

-Intrumental-

 

 

X- Tribal Dreams (5:26)

 

Stepped into a beginning tale

Where it is Forever the Night

Maybe I will live enough to tell

A story from so far so close to the heart

 

Rainbow petals twirling in the night

A garden growing in the dark

Responding choirs from the stars

Magical voices heard about everywhere

 

Hiding so softly, just for a moment

Safely away, all alone to play

 

Stepped into an enchanting tale

Where the wind blows into its flute

Where trees play harp so magically

Into the woods of Forgotten-Lands

 

A small tribe stands around a fire

Accompanying the melody

Accompanied by an unknown voice

With strange instruments from another time and place

 

Hiding so softly, just for a moment

Safely away, all alone to play

Far away, around the fire

Tribal Dreams, humble fantasies

 

 

XI- Hide Safely (6:01)

 

Suddenly,

The Moonlight shines to me

It reaches me, into my humble bedroom

Suddenly,

I feel that I could flee

 

Magically,

It seems that I can see

All the eyes, from forests that never dies

Suddenly,

The tears fall into me

 

Through the trees, on the ground

Lies the light sought for so long

Through the branches and the caves

Sings a voice with unknown words

 

Suddenly,

Seems a voice into me

Sings to me, in unspoken tongues

Magically,

Her words I can now see

 

Telling me,

Soon you will see the sea

Fly the sky, and ride the stars

Telling me,

She is Eternity

 

-chorus-

 

Suddenly,

She opened all my ears

And I heard such wonders

 

I have heard,

Enchanting melodies

From the roses and from the thunder

This is all,

That I can make of it

This is all that I can make of it

 

XII- Nocturnal Eden (7:56)

 

An infant stares at the sky

Covered by the Starlights

Amazement fills his sparkly eyes

 

An infant learns to smile again

Covered by the gentle Moonlight

All of his sorrows were not in vain

â€¦ feeling so safely naked

 

Finally the clouds are exploding

Down down the rain is pouring

Hearing new colored birds sing

And fantasies breathing

 

Landed in a dream of deep enchantments

Overwhelmed by new warmth into my chest

Feelings of pleasure running into my body

I open my eyes and forever let go

 

An infant bathes in the light

Covered by Moonâ€™s serenity

Feeling that with his wings, to fly, he might

â€¦ a universe whereâ€¦

 

Wilderness is full of wisdom

And where the wisdom is wild

Where Angels are better seductress

Then GaÃ¯aâ€™s darker childs

-chorus-

 

â€œnow that my garden richly grows

why would I need to harvest autumnâ€™s flowers?â€

 

-chorus-
