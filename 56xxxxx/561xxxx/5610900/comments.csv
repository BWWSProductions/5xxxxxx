,slicknick610,2010-06-13T02:17Z,ANNOUNCEMENT: I will not be posting rd 3 450 class. Its not my fault or choice. My local NBC affiliate chose to show paid programming instead. I left several angry voicemails. I hope they show Red Bud in a few weeks. I also hope someone else captured this round.
,mx_phreek,2010-06-13T12:59Z,Gutted! I take it you will still have the 250 class when it broadcast. I have tried to find the chap who posts the standard def torrents on here and a few other site's but i having no luck in finding the 450 race. The search suck's ballz on here.
,chump6784,2010-06-14T04:10Z,"to jeffro30.

i didnt even think of converting it. used ultra quicktime convertor and it worked perfectly. still might have to get some more ram but in the mean time this works well"
,JohnnyRickard,2010-06-15T16:55Z,"what is ultra quicktime convertor and how do I use it, chump? and if you're a  swed, please wright in swedish."
