Well, the election results are in, and itâ€™s good news for candidates who happen to be women, rich, or crazy. There were wins by everyone from entrenched incumbents to wealthy businesswomen, to upstart Tea Partiers.

In Arkansas, Blanche Lincoln survived a challenge from the Democratic Partyâ€™s left wing. What do you call the portion of the Democratic Party thatâ€™s left of Blanche Lincoln? The Democratic Party. I think Blanche Lincoln has gotten more money from Wal-Mart than all the employees of Wal-Mart combined have gotten from Wal-Mart. But then thatâ€™s not a very high bar.

In California, Carly Fiorina won the Republican primary to run for the Senate against Barbara Boxer. Well, if Fiorina wins, Barbara Boxer will hardly be the first person to lose their job because of Carly Fiorina.

Meg Whitman won the Republican nomination to run for Governor of California. Well, to be more accurate, Meg Whitman bought the Republican nomination. She spent $80 million of her own money, beating Steve Poizner, who spent $24 million of his money. This wasnâ€™t an election, it was a competitive bidding contest. But then what do you expect from a former Ebay executive? 

In Nevada, Tea Party darling Sharron Angle won the Republican nomination to run against Harry Reid. Give her this much: Sharron Angle ran a brilliant campaign, if by â€œbrilliant,â€ you mean she avoided suggesting that people pay for health insurance with chickens. She definitely has some wacky, fringe views of her own. Now Harry Reid has the race he wanted. He damned well better win itâ€¦ or weâ€™re going to have somebody in the Senate who makes Jim DeMint look sane.

If youâ€™re looking for a trend in yesterdayâ€™s results, the only discernible one seems to be that women candidates win. You know what that meansâ€”look for John McCain to announce that he is a woman.
