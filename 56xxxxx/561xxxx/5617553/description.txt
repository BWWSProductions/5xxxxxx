Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



Fernando Trueba's acclaimed celebration of Latin jazz arrives on DVD in a package that should bring a smile to music fans. The visuals have been given a letterboxed transfer in the film's original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for 16 x 9 monitors), and the original Spanish language audio has been mastered in Dolby Digital 5.1. There's also an alternate audio track with the interview segments dubbed into French in Dolby Digital Stereo. Optional Spanish subtitles have been included, and the disc also includes several bonus features: a commentary track from Latin jazz authority Nat Chediak, an additional documentary on the history and background of Latin jazz, biographies and discographies on the musicians featured, and the picture's original theatrical trailer. The superb quality of the disc's DVD audio would be enough reason for many jazz fans to pick up this edition of Calle 54, but the strength of the film and the quality of the additional material makes it a must for anyone with a passion for Latin music at its best.
