In the second installment of Quentin Tarantino's outrageously inventive Kill Bill series, the Bride (Uma Thurman) unwaveringly continues on her "roaring rampage of revenge" against the band of assassins who had tried to kill her and her unborn child. The woman visits each of her former associates one by one, checking off the victims on her Death List Five until there's nothing left to do â€¦ but kill Bill (David Carradine).
