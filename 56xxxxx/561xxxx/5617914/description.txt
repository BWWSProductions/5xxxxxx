First I just want to give a BIG THANK YOU to Jack for giving a shout out to 'gedude' during the 3rd segment of hour 1. Yes it's pronounced GE dude. I used to work for the evil empire until they sold my department during the current 
recession. We made about 20 million a year for them in a deartment of 15 people, but I guess we we're quite an asset that had to be let go to recover some of the money for all their other bad financial decisions. Anyway todays show...

In the first hour Jack makes a reference and plays a clip from an interview with Daniel Ellsberg that took place on 2006-07-14. In reference to The Pentagon Papers.
