Road rlin (2004) Complete DVD9 Rip x264
as title when I inserted over and over again
 Road to Berlin (2004) Complete DVD9 Rip x264
in the title.  Does anybody know what's going on?
I tried with Firefox and Opera as well."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-06-08T19:34Z,Finally. I added more spaces et voila.
[V],Kuthumi,2010-06-09T06:50Z,"mkvonly: The title is looking OK now. PirateBay's upload function has been grumpy lately and does not immediately show changes although you have made them, and they are registered. It may help to click your own username and find it again. This may have something to do with the handling of cash memory on the server or some other mumbo-jumbo."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-06-09T11:19Z,"I deleted now the extra spaces and it shows again only ""Road rlin"" instead of ""Road to Berlin"". weird.
I leave it like this for a few hours, if no change I will add again the extra spaces."
