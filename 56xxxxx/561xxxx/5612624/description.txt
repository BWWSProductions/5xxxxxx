In the early 1970s Emitt Rhodes was poised to be the next big thing in pop music. Rhode's style of music echoed the emerging style of power-pop played by Paul McCartney and groups like the Raspberries and Badfinger. But Rhodes, after tiring himself playing in bands as a teenager, wanted to be the only one-man-act out there. His youthful naivety proved to be both a blessing and a curse when it came to the music business. Writing, producing, and playing every instrument on his three solo albums between 1970 and 1973, Rhodes never achieved the success of his pop peers. Instead because lack of touring and label support, Rhodes became an influential songwriter to future pop songwriters and bands.
