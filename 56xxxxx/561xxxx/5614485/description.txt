Astrophysicist and author Dr. Bernard Haisch discussed his theory that the universe is a product of an intelligence, and how this is demonstrated with recent scientific findings. "It's becoming more and more evident in quantum physics that consciousness creates reality," he noted, adding that while you may not be able to hold simultaneous beliefs in science and religion, science and spirituality are compatible. "There is a logical and conceptual basis for believing in a spiritual reality that does not in any way contradict with science," he added. 


Darwinian evolution is essential to a purposeful universe "because if the universe was...manufactured by an intelligent-design sort of God, then what would be the point of it? It would be God creating a kind of puppet show down here...I think evolution is the way that novelty and new kinds of experiences and the unknown are designed to arise out of creation to make this a very interesting place," Haisch put forth. 


While there may be multiverses or alternate universes, Haisch believes that it is just one intelligence that is expressing itself in different ways. Further, he suggested that the purpose of the universe is for the consciousness of God to enter into existing life forms and experience physical reality.
