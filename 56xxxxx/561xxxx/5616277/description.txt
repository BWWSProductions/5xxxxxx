According to the New York Times, at least one scientist believes that the oil geyser is gushing at a greater volume since BP cut off the top of the riser last week.   Dr. Ira Leifer is an expert hired by the government to estimate the rate of the oil flow.  As the Times reports, â€œDr. Leifer said in an interview on Monday that judging from the video, cutting the pipe might have led to a several-fold increase in the flow rate from the well. â€˜The well pipe clearly is fluxing way more than it did before . . . By way more, I donâ€™t mean 20 percent, I mean multiple factors.â€™â€

Oh dear, is it possible that BP is (gasp!) lying about the scope of the disaster, trying to minimize it or something? Have you noticed that every â€œfixâ€ they attempt seems to make things worse?  At this point would it not make sense to order them out of the Gulf and let some fresh, non-BP-affiliated experts have a shot?  Canâ€™t imagine they would do a worse job.
