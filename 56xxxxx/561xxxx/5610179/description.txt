
if i had a hi-fi is a covers album full of inspired, unexpected choices: from avant-pop Kate Bush to underground power-pop classicist Dwight Twilley. There are some intriguingly obscure numbers, like Spanish band Mercromina's "Evolution" and under-documented Bill Fox's "Electrocution". It also features tracks by The Go-Betweens, Arthur Russell, Spoon, and more. This record will be released on June 8th, but the band is making copies available early for Record Store Day.
