,jager963,2010-12-04T02:13Z,"Not only does this install like a dream,far easier than fshobbys version  As a regular user of both FEX and REX programs I have to say that FEX Is way way better at building cumulus and cirrus clouds then REX is and not by a little either it blows REX out of the water. Fantastic upload DCrack you are a genius. "
,giorgos75,2011-04-27T20:49Z,"Thanks a lot for the upload, but I think there is a slight problem...
In order to have access to all themes, you have to log in using a user name and password, otherwise you can only install the master themes, working offline.
Is there a solution here..?"
,fuzdemon,2012-03-01T18:20Z,"nice one man, just when i thought i had all the addons another one pops up :D"
,fuzdemon,2012-03-03T21:35Z,"I didnt have that problem, i can install any themes I want without logging in, its just a pity theres no option to save the themes ive made, so if I make a good one I need to write down which themes I chose."
,doomslash,2012-06-12T05:18Z,"will seed this for 3 days, hope it will help :)"
