Since its initial broadcast in 1991, the Earth & Sky  radio series has presented daily information about science and nature  to radio listeners from around the world. Earth & Sky's stated mission is to be a "clear voice for science."

Earth & Sky is the creation of veteran radio producers and on-air personalities, Deborah Byrd and Joel Block, whose program "Star Date" began broadcasting in the U.S. in the late 1970s.

Earth & Sky currently presents 90-second and 60-second radio spots (called "modules") on a wide variety of scientific topics, communicating through terrestrial radio as well as satellite radio and internet radio. Earth & Sky is aired one or more times daily on more than 1,000 commercial, NPR, and other public radio stations, 80 affiliates stations for the sight-impaired, and across 35 channels on both XM and Sirius satellite radio in the United States. Abroad, the programming is heard on American Forces Radio, Voice of America Radio, World Radio Network, and others.
