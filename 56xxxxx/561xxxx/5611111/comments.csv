,saphirezsexy,2010-09-05T22:17Z,"Works great, except when youre useing avast newest version, apperantly TotalMedia uses something that triggers avast and then TotalMedia uses some kind of self-defence and reboots youre pc when you try and run the program, same thing happends if you download the trial from their site so its not youre torrent, many others have this problem with avast and this program so yust thought I would share if you others happend to use avast"
