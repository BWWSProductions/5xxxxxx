Jerry dumps his girlfriend Sidra (played by Teri Hatcher) after Elaine says her figure is the result of breast implants. Kramer claims to have seen Salman Rushdie (played by Tony Amendola) at the health club, but is living under the pseudonym "Sal Bass". By accident, Elaine later discovers the breasts are real when she trips and grabs them for balance.

George accompanies his current girlfriend (Megan Mullally) to Detroit for her aunt's wake. While there, he tries to get a copy of her death certificate so he can get a 50% discount on the airfare. He argues at the funeral reception with his girlfriend's brother Timmy (Kieran Mulroney) when accused of double-dipping a chip.

Quotations
    (exit line)
    Sidra: And by the way, they're real- and they're spectacular.

**********************************************************

    (George takes a large tortilla chip, dips it into a bowl of dip, takes a bite, dips it into the bowl again, and then eats the remainder of the chip)
    Timmy: What are you doing?
    George: What?
    Timmy: Did, did you just double dip that chip?
    George: Excuse me?
    Timmy: You double dipped the chip!
    George: Double dipped? What, what are you talking about?
    Timmy: You dipped the chip. You took a bite, *points at the dip* and you dipped again.
    George: So?
    Timmy: That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip. From now on, when you take a chip, just take one dip and end it.
    George: Well, I'm sorry, Timmy, but I don't dip that way.
    Timmy: Oh, you don't, huh?
    George: No. You dip the way you wanna dip. I'll dip the way I wanna dip.
    (George grabs another chip, dips it, takes a bite and begins to reach for the dip as Timmy grabs his hand)
    Timmy: Gimme the chip!
    (The argument becomes an all-out brawl between George and Timmy)

Trivia

    * Sidra's parting shot to Jerry at the end of this episode was scripted as simply "Oh, by the way, they're real." Teri Hatcher ad-libbed the kicker "...and they're spectacular."
    * The television show MythBusters tested the theory that double dipping was like "putting your whole mouth right in the dip" on the April 22, 2009 episode. The MythBusters found that double dipping produced less microbes than putting all the dip in your mouth. Also, the amount of microbes present was negligible compared to the amount found in regular dip.

Superman reference

    * Elaine: Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
    * Sidra: Yes! How did you know?
    * Elaine: Oh, I know the type.

Teri Hatcher (Sidra) would later play Lois Lane in Lois and Clark.

NOTE: 272p = frame-size 480x272 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, playable on all kinds
             of MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems
      360p = frame-size 640x360 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, middle-format, playback
             as for 272p (except streaming)
      480p = frame-size 720x480 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 720x304
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)
      720p = frame-size 1280x720 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 1280x544
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR), hardware intensive
      
      Most problems people have are with frame-sizes 1280x720 (720p). I recommend 
      and have used one system for years - CoreCodec for H264 ("Deblocking" set to
      "Standard") and part of DivX7 for AAC. 
      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p 
      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic cards processors (GPU)
      decode H264 using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreCodec 
      (I have an ATI card, just in case you were wondering).
      
      Problems one can have may come from either one of the following 
      and/or a combination of these â€“ the playback system itself, a 
      malfunctioning device or lack of knowledge. 
      
      For instance, any so called "jerky" playback of "system-heavy" 720p comes
      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded 
      computer. Use of ddshow filters and "codecs" is suicidal. This is not 
      Russian 720p Matroska format ("official" 720p) and completely different 
      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extent
      "hide" bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, 
      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as 
      much as possible.
        
      Any 'blurriness' of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. 
      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,
      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.
      Any â€˜blockinessâ€™ comes from 'system-too-slow' situation, when decoding 
      engine of ones device become over-capacitated and cannot process all frames 
      as it supposed to.
      On "I have no video" and "I have no sound" I don't waste my time as this 
      is generally a complete lack of knowledge and/or understanding. 
      RTFM is the best response I can give.

      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There are no B-frames, no CABAC 
      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness of 
      any kind.

      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).
      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system 
      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones 
      with Line In of any Stereo rack).
      
      I encode H264 for six years and I have experienced (first-hand) any problem 
      one might have or imagine. I have heard almost every â€˜complaintâ€™ out there 
      and would, if asked POLITELY, be happy to answer questions and give as much 
      help as humanly possible   
      I always have.
