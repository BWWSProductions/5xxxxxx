However, you can play your game in eztv swarm where Treme is JUST 2.5 times bigger."
,jon4fun,2010-06-07T13:05Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.
Another unexpected pleasure as I thought this had gone the way of the dinosuars & [quark] on your torrents.

I love that you must be 'limiting' up speed to the initial seeders (leaches/peers) and your message telling them so.

@ ALL, share as fast as you can and we ALL benefit. As 20-40 has said, so many times it is burned onto my retina, 'do NOT join an inital seed (less then 4 seeders available) unless your upspeed in higher than 50KB/s'. It's a very simple rule and I'm delighted that 20-40 is enforcing it. 
If you don't change your upspeed limit 20-40 may ??????

Cheers
Jon"
,billiebean,2010-06-07T13:17Z,"Hi - just want to thank you for all the great work. I have limited memory (well, my pc I mean) and your uploads are a boon. And you have introduced me to stuff not yet screened in the UK. Keep it up. Cheers BB"

one 20-40."
,hkoraddi,2010-06-07T16:22Z,"well i must really say swarm of seeders of 2040 is the greatest even better den some private torrent just show some respect back to them i never get anything less then max speed so why you care for no ups dude. I'm watching out in ""she is out of my league"" its #### blueray in 500mb dude all peares comin and going there is no rise of seeder more then 31 its a max i saw.come on boss please dont kill such a good swarm of 2040................."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-07T17:24Z,"Thank you guys. I very well understand problems mentioned here, but I keep repeating something that seems hard to accept:
You are not ""the problem"". None of you. Nobody is so stupid to parch your own waterhole, right?

hkoraddi's simple observation ""all peares comin and going"" depicts what is real problem, not just here. My swarms and torrents are more vulnerable. I CANNOT compensate, for example 14 Hit&runs (come&goers) as happened in font of my eyes this morning, just during my first cup of coffee. 
No one here can. Only guys on extra-fast cable can do that, and here... such guys doesn't come. Be honest, why should they?
Therefore I sung  ""many little hands.."" but nothing has changed. Jon have said other day something like ""I am convinced now that such morons NEVER read the comments or description of the torrent"".
I am sure about. Even the idiots who have shitting over me last few days, actually never bothered to understand what has been written  (as on ""Waterworld"" where esteemed idiot three fucking times brag about my writing about... encoding - even if the whole text is about - PLAYBACK). Well..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-07T17:29Z,"err.
font = front
Sorry."
,jon4fun,2010-06-08T00:07Z,"Hi 20-40,
All you can do is stick by your guns, fight the good fight and while we all get slower speeds due to the H&R fucks maybe, just MAYBE they will get the message and go away. Slow speed may be the only thing/message/comment they CAN understand.

I'd rather it take over 24 hours to DL a single torrent than watch the H&R's 'come and go' leaving nothing but a bad taste in your/our mouth behind them.

I won't say I speak for anyone but myself but I would suggest that you throttle back everything on your end as soon as you up it. 
(Unless, you can make a P2P direct connection with some of your real regulars. Before anyone screams... I am not one of these people, wish I was but I can't direct connect to 20-40).

Just tell your fans in the comments (which the H&r shits never read anyway) what you're doing. I'm quite happy to wait a day or two or three if it eventually makes these shits go away.

My two cents.

Cheers
Jon"
