,aaaidan,2010-06-23T02:32Z,"NZ National Radio just aired a piece on how Boy was ""illegally uploaded to the internet"" ""two weeks ago"", to ""a peer-to-peer file sharing site"". What a SCANDAL! "
,Festus15,2010-06-23T09:50Z,"The story was just on Campbell Live too. I view torrent versions of movies as a way to preview them to see if they're worth paying for. If I like it, I'll go to the cinema, or more likely, buy the BluRay or DVD. Either way, if the producer/director makes a good movie and I like it, they will get some money from me. The movie industry millionaires have to stop whinging about downloading. If they want MORE money for their efforts, offer up high quality downloads to people for a cheaper price than what they charge in DVD shops. Direct-to-customer = not paying the movie industry weasels a cut."
