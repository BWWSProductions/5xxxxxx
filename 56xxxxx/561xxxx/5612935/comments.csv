,Fallacy11,2010-07-11T08:52Z,Good bad anyone here?
,morpheme,2010-08-08T21:26Z,Why are some of the episodes in here only 7 megabytes?
,hobowithashotgun,2010-08-11T20:59Z,Very good quality for what was one of the best cartoons of all time. Good torrent thanks.
,jap_bond,2010-10-22T01:40Z,"Because this is the DVD release, hence it's still incomplete. It's only until episode 75 (""The Presidents / Don't Tread on Us / The Flame Returns, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow""). Blame Warner home video for not releasing further 1 DVD, it's only another 23 episode."

,Grave___Digger,2011-01-20T02:23Z,BEST CARTOON OF ALL TIME!!!
,ratPT01,2011-03-28T18:48Z,"Why are the files broken down into each segment from the episodes? why not have the complete episodes together? yea the quality is great, but this is horribly organized.

S1E10 is just the 9 min pinky and the brain segment from that episode. 
S1E11 is 1:20 long and is a segment with the Warners and the Wheel of Morality then the credits. stupid."
,HappyHelperton,2011-04-10T10:04Z,"I have converted all the cartoon files to .wmv format here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6308104 For those of you inconvenienced by the Matroska Video container files, especially when it comes to portable players, phones, etc. Enjoy! BTW, thanks to shadd22 for uploading these in the first place!"
,HappyHelperton,2011-04-10T22:21Z,"Sorry, I messed up the trackers in the original .torrent and I erased it in an attempt to fix it, but now it's not uploadable anymore (who knows why not!) so I converted the extras and added ""Wakko's Wish"" and made a new .torrent here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6309283 .  Please disregard the URL in my previous comment as it won't work anymore. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

Happy Helperton =)"
,Neysayer,2011-09-11T18:40Z,"MKV???? Really??? You'd think people would fucking learn by now. Why not AVI, MP4, or something fucking UNIVERSAL!?!?!? It's always a BITCH playing MKV files, and when you convert them, they usually mess up somehow. NO MKVs!!!"
,Mindscry,2011-09-18T16:18Z,Anyone with an IQ over 5 can play MKV files. It's amazing how much you ingrates whine and moan.
,shadd22,2011-11-03T02:05Z,"Anyone not happy with the choice of file container or episode layout is more then welcome to download a different compressed version here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6308104

To HappyHelperton, thank you for taking the time to recode these for those who do not prefer MKV, much appreciated. To anyone complaining, you now have a choice so no need to freak out now, k?"
,Polymathj,2012-06-11T02:31Z,"I agree with whole ""fuck mkv files"" thing.  Yes, I could sit in front of my laptop like a goon or keep a spare hooked up to the flat screen but come on, really?  Why not stop being a douche and just make everything mp4, avi, etc?  

When I upload, I want the most people to have access, not just pc/Mac users.  No brainer.

I use my Xbox and PS3 because I use a NAS with built in torrent and UPNP for media that I can stream anywhere.  It's elegant and I can use my Logitech remote for all and not a mouse/keyboard or touchpad.  

Lawyered."
,whazzup89,2012-06-29T02:23Z,"Polymathj, with all due respect, you're a FUCKING DOUCHE. 
It's windows users like you that lower the standards of computer-related material by opening your damn mouth about something great someone did.

If you're not happy with the format, then convert them to something else but don't bust the uploader's balls with your windows-lovin' bullshit. Now go back to your little PC and your all-wireless house you low-life ^^

BTW, thanks a lot for this shadd22 :)"
