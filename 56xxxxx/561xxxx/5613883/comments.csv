,Mitzos,2010-09-23T01:21Z,"SOLUTION FOR RUNNING UNDER WINDOWS 7

Download Affinity.exe (game doesn't like dual core)
create a SilentHill2.bat (create a *.txt and rename it to *.bat)
put the affinity.exe and the SilentHill2.bat in your SilentHill2 folder (in this example i will use C:\SilentHill2)
type the following text into the SilentHill2.bat file:

affinity Sh2pc.exe (if you renamed your silent hill exe, you have to rename this entry too of course)

Start the game with the *.bat file

tested under win 7 64x

great torrent thx!!! 

You can get Affinity.exe here http://www.leweyg.com/download/affinity.html"

,4225190,2011-01-22T12:27Z,"well, first of all thanks for mitzos help, but i got a little further advice: for some reasons i had problems starting the game with affinity set to 1 prozessor, so my tip for everybody who's having problems with the cutscenes and can't start the game for some reasons with that .bat either: you can simply start the game then go to the task manager -> process -> and then right click and set the affinity to only one processor manualy"
,VDmaf,2011-02-03T19:35Z,"Thanx allot for the game. That's probably the only game ( and few more) with that bad graphics that i really enjoy coz of the story and more cool stuff other wise ill never even give a second glance :)

Game works Perfectrly. At first when i chose the normal diff its says Some file is missing. So i had to reinstall and restarted my pc (unzip and extract-no paste and extract or it wont work) it and put it in C: location ( C:\Silent.Hill.2.Directors.Cut.PC.Game(djDEVASTATEâ„¢). After Installing again it worked maybe becouse i chose easy diff :).

Well, if anyone need some help about installin (deamon) or somethink esle's pls do. FACEBOOK Jay Bel"
,koiwai,2011-02-13T15:17Z,"Thanks a lot. Works great. Be sure to play it with noise, all. :)

You don't have to download and install anything to make it run under Windows 7/Dual Core processors. 

Just start the game -> alt-tab out -> start Task Manager -> locate sh2pc.exe -> right-click and select Set Affinity -> Check only a single processor -> Start playing

Only downside to this, is that you have to do it every time the game starts up."
,evil16,2011-03-07T18:51Z,very nice  work great !!!
,outtamyhead91,2011-05-06T04:47Z,GREAT fucking dl! I haven't played it through yet but it works perfectly aside from some crashing (caused by my computer).

,Porksauce,2011-05-30T16:11Z,"TO ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH CUT SCENES –

I had the same problem as someone posted earlier with cut scenes freezing a couple of frames in, and not being able to proceed without skipping them.

The game crashed shortly after first experiencing this problem, and when I started it again, it complained that I had had it on a ""dangerous"" graphics setting, and launched in a lower resolution. The cut scenes worked again after this. So try fiddling with those settings."
,XSCounter,2011-06-18T16:31Z,"Did anyone manage to run it in 1920x1080? I am trying to use the method in this guide but it crashes each time I start the game.

,tarantulacow,2011-06-23T02:15Z,"The music doesn't work. After awhile it just starts repeating. I've tried running it in compatibility mode XP SP2, while running as administrator. I've also tried following the steps to change the affinity, but it doesn't actually let me do so. Clicking on Set Affinity gives me ""Operation could not be completed. Access denied."" I'm using a windows 7 64 bit"
,ansem533,2011-07-03T21:33Z,"Just a warning, make sure you have peerblock on whilst DLing this or seeding. I got a letter from my service provider telling me to stop infringing."
,thankgod,2011-08-18T01:45Z,"I don't have cut scene problem, but I have the sound problem, which repeats itself forever. However, by setting affinity to single cpu, now it works perfect! thanks guys.

btw, I'm using win7 x64  / 4 cpus 8 threads"
,Mulysa,2011-08-22T05:01Z,"It keeps crashing when I try to go into the historical societies 2nd door. I've done everything that's in the threads, but nothing has worked. Any ideas?"
,Mulysa,2011-08-22T07:04Z,"Disregard my last post, I'm an r-tard, it's fine."
,didactandnarpet,2011-08-25T04:54Z,"Works brilliantly once you use the instructions that everyone has posted.  However this might be a helpful hint to people that are still having problems.    
Even after trying every trick posted the game continued to crash for me at startup.  I managed to isolate the problem to my digital sound.  I use hdmi to deliver my sound to a receiver.  I decide to switch my playback device to the analog outputs on the back of my pc.  Viola the game started and I've been playing without a hitch.
It seems for me that hdmi sound was causing the  game to crash on my pc.  "
,sandalffi,2011-09-07T00:08Z,This is third time I've tried to download this file and each time winrar finds over 1500 and 7zip over 3000 errors in the archive. what. the. fuck.

,xFrostyx,2011-10-21T15:44Z,"Wait nevermind, it was just a problem with my graphics card, but it's all fixed now ^^

,blazingotaku,2012-02-07T20:43Z,"for those having problems with the cutscenes and having trouble with quiting the game etc,do this, right click on sh2pc (application),click the compatibility tab check the box compatibility mode and choose Windows XP (service pack 2),right below in the (settings) check all the boxes and also check the box that says run this program as an admin,click ok and then start the game,this will fix your problem, by the way im using windows 7 64 bit and this worked for me."

,bungunners,2012-04-20T01:49Z,"This works but needs a lot of adjustments if you want widescreen, but the fixes are there if you google it.  Next, there is an affinity tool that you will need if you have multi core setup.  Go here  http://www.robpol86.com/index.php/ImageCFG   to get the program and follow instructions.  Next thing is I disable the software surround virtualization and my audio problem is solved.  This all works as advertised and I'll post back if I have problems"
