For anyone who doesn't know, cultures is very much like settlers only with a nordic theme and even cuter graphics. The gameplay is better though because you have individual control over EACH  settler. They can go on quests, find treasures, and equip the loot they find - so it's like a settlers RPG hybrid.

The games are BRILLIANT - as you can see, esharoth liked them enough to collect all four and so do I.

If you like those kind of games, do yourself a favour and try these - they're the best in the genre, under appreciated gems. On a big screen in high def (And even cultures 1 can run in HD  - that's how well programmed they were) it looks INCREDIBLE - especially the last one, ""eighth wonder of the world""

Thanks again esharoth and let me know if you want some bigger versions..."
