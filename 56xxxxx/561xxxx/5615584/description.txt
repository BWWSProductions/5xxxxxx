***********************************************
Slowly but surely Ashes and Iron brick you into labyrinth of massive, insurmountable guitar walls. There are obstacles to overcome. 33 minutes left to escape your fate, and the countdown is on. Desperation arises - they make you feel it deep inside your bone marrow, but at the same time, the band's dynamic sound goads you on to find your way out of the labyrinth. Drums and bass-lines give you the power to keep on going, not to give in, and never lose sight of your goal while the vocals seem to guide the way. Listen closely, and you will know which path to follow. Not only freedom is awaiting you, there's a lot more to find - you will have learned something about yourself! 

"Ashes And Iron" consists of Thad Martin (Drums), Dave Lawrence (Bass), Chris Denton (Guitars), David Miller (Guitars), Ian Mahan (Guitars), Kenny Snarzyk (Keyboards/Vocals). This EP features 3 tracks, 33 minutes of awesome Sludge, and the band, in my opinion, might already count to the magnitudes of this genre. Who is able to claim this for themselves, after the first Demo-EP?! 

"Ashes and Iron" are easily named in the same breath as Neurosis, Irreversible, Isis, Cult Of Luna, Callisto, Humanfly, Manatees, Pelican, Latitudes or Mouth Of The Architect and this speaks for the level and competence of the 6 St. Louis musicians. A real cool bonus is, that the band offers their EP as .WAV files on their website. 

Absolutely recommended and 10/10 points. There is no better way to create a demo-cd.
