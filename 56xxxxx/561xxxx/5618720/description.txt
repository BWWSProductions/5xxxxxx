FixCleaner seeks to provide easy access to system repair, protection and optimization in one,

set of utilities that work in coordination with the main cleaner. These include an update manager 
to help control updates from major software companies. They also include a privacy scanner and shredder, 
an automatic error remover, and a junk file cleaner. 

To optimize a user's system, FixCleaner features an Active-X manager and a set of step-by-step templates
