Remarks:
The long breaks between the tracks represent the actual duration on the vinyl gramophone record. The compact disc is a medium that easily reveals the limitations of an analogue recording. It was attempted to remove some of the faults common to a physical form of data storage while limiting the introduction of digital editing and mastering artifacts.

This is a Crepusculaire release 2009

If you want to use the multi-tracker mode, be sure to do it right. I didn't, so you'll have to add them manually (unless I'll upload a new version - but I'll do that on request only). If anyone wants to add this torrent to anonther tracker, let me know about the trackers where you've uploaded it.
