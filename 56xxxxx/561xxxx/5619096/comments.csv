Do you have any access to a rapid-prototyping app called ""Axure RP Pro""?"

,kinkylilred,2010-06-14T06:20Z,"I downloaded this, although mine did not have the ""bonehead"" file?"
,maeth,2010-06-16T16:16Z,"Yeah same here, was looking good, but cant find the bone head file (thats a little to ironic for me ;) Any advice?"
,Heave__Ho,2010-06-22T00:48Z,"By ""bonehead"" he means the file with the skull as its icon (  TOBW.rtfd)  It says ""Use any fake email and fake serial to register with!"""
,nut4golf,2010-06-23T13:33Z,"The Bonehead file refers to an icon in the .DMG file. If you click it, it opens a text document that basically tells you to just register with any email and any made up registration number - do that and everything works fine. "
,nickces,2010-07-02T10:21Z,"WORKS GREAT :D
when installing it (dragging the icon into the applications folder), also double click the skull and it will open a window that says use any fake email and code
i just put my email and as the code i put 12345"
