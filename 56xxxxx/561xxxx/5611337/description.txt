Dark Sides - The Best Of The Shadows Of Knight ... 1965 - 1971

Rhino Records 1994 Compilation CD

Rippin' garage punk from the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. Compilation covers The Shadows' diverse recording history .... starting with the blues-rock Them cover of "Gloria" ... and ending with their last ... rather amusing ... single "I Am The Hunter." Excellent re-issue.
