,lilars26,2010-06-10T02:34Z,"@all
Turn up your upload speed to unlimited and start sharing what you have.Then you can all get done more quickly."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-10T06:48Z,"@houruoha: No problems my friend. Just for the info ""272p"" refers to 480x272 pixels, 16/9 aspect ratio and H264 encoding.

I was annoyed with attempts of this site's stuff to mob me out - for hundreds time in the row this torrent on TPB pages shows 1 seeder from June 9 22:00 GMT to June 10 5:23 GMT. Then 32 and factually has - 132 seederrs almost all the time. Other torrents, same title from other uploaders, but nowhere near the quality of mine - shows like thousand's (even non-existing, ""invented"" by rigged torrent-programs.
This is the ""simplest"" way to make some uploaders ""less attractive"" over other ones.

This is done by people who should care about this site, but taking into consideration their vocabulary on IRC channel I cannot expect nothing less.
""you motherfucker get what youve deserved"".

Yes, I have.
Nothing new.

Oh - I EXPECT ""rebuttals"" - but I give flying fuck and two rat's asses aside."

,madtown4,2010-06-10T09:23Z,"@ piratebay give 2040 the respect he deserves ! he is the best uploader around. there is a few that can stand next to him , but not no where close to him. i dont know whats going on i guess there is people closer to the addminstration than others maybe. but 2040 followers are closer to him because he is the man that will , help people with bandwith probs & so on. if any body agrees please give your props to 2040. send to addmits or just let every one know !!by commenting it everywhere !!



                                       thanks 2040 for everything you have done for me and every one else."
