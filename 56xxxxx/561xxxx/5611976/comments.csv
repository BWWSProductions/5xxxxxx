,RPD453,2010-06-13T06:48Z,"well, the movies very good quality, plus a very good movie. just finished watching it. But when you open the folder, your faced with an MKV file which can only be opened with specific programs (not real player of windows media player). Google ""Combined Community Codec Pack"" and download and install it, and then you should be able to open it in any video program (i used WMP to play it, didnt test it out on anything else)"
[T],Ch4cal,2010-06-14T02:54Z,"CCCP, VLC and DivX Players will play this. As will divx plus HD, and divx ultra certified players, and many blu-ray players will play mkv H264

If you REALLY want to convert it to DVD5, BluRay or PS3 format, the latest free divx player (8) will do that for you: http://www.divx.com/en/software/divx-plus

I'm quite used to not getting comments here, I tend to get  more favourable support at de*o*oid.com :( "
[T],Ch4cal,2010-06-14T03:05Z,"Sorry, forgot to mention, I use the free AC3Filter (1.63b) by Alexander Vigovsky. You can adjust the gain, and get a brilliant surround-sound out of it. Enjoy! :)"

,speklap,2010-10-12T16:20Z,"Hello Ch4cal ! I have downloaded many of your torrents and all have been excellent quality. Thank you for all the effort you put in. I don't have access to the other site you mentioned (o-oid) I think you should be getting many positive comments for your torrents ! Thank you, Karen, Canada."
