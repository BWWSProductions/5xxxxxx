They reveal to you swift and effective protection for a wide variety of threats and distances, explain the types of security and safety zones, show excellent drills on developing sensitivity, reaction time, peripheral vision, skills of moving yourself and the one you are with from the lines of attack, distraction tactics, professional takedowns, handgun detection and controlling the attack at the first sign of intention, as well as the ways of handling and disarming handguns and knives not used by any instructional facility in North America, such as protection from two knife-wielding attackers, and loading the gun with one hand.

The film is specifically designed to be absolutely clear and exciting to watch. You are sure to learn from it after the first viewing!
