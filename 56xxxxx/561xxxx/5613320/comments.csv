But I am quit DISAPPOINTED when I saw that the Audio of your 2012 BRRip was slagging behind. Then I thought no no that would be some of my Codec Problem. So I Updated My Codecs (Actually was Up-to-Date) then Tried that Movie, but no use gives the same Problem. So I tried on another Computer, my Friend's Computers...etc..etc. But no use ! :-(
So I thought there would be some thing..Leave it !

Then I downloaded your The Spy Next Door BRRip. That worked Extremely Fine !

Then I Downloaded Avatar 2009 DVDScr and Universal Soldier Regeneration 2009 BRRip. These Movies are also giving the same ""Audio Lacking Behind"" Problem.

And this problem is Not faced by me only. My Friends to Face Same.
Help me Out Man.....!
Your Rips has the Awesome Crystallity in A & V both, thus I Like U.
So tell me What to do Now !  :-|"
