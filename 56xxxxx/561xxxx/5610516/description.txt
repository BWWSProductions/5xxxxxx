Satirical drama based on Margaret Thatcher's early years in politics. Young Margaret wants nothing more than to be an MP, but may be too much of a rebel for the Conservative Party of the 1950s. She did not have a 'good war', she is interested in politics and she thinks a woman's place can be in the House as well as the home.
