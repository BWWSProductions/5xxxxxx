Format Factory is a free, fully-featured, converter  that enables you to convert audio, video, and even images, between the most popular formats. These include WMV, AVI, MPG, MP3, WMA, AAC, JPG, PNG, GIF, and many more. Better still, Format Factory supports media formats used by most major portable devices, including PSP  and iPhone.

Format Factory is very easy to use, although it does have rather an unintuitive interface. The file browser doesn't appear until you select the target format, which is a bit weird but as long as you know this first it's no problem. You can select individual files to convert, or complete folders, and also tweak some basic conversion settings.

Format Factory isn't particularly original but what makes it really useful is that it handles images as well as audio and video. Most converters like this only handle audio and video, and adding images to the mix gives it an edge, especially considering it's free. I also like the Audio Joiner in Format Factory, which allows you to take two separate clips, join them together and then convert them. It would have been nice to have had preset profiles for mobile conversions but you can't have it all in a free app sometimes.
