,zushigreg,2010-06-21T06:11Z,"Thanks for the torrent, mth978. But I only wanted one of these. I've read the others in paper form. If you can, next time, please don't zip them all together. That way we can pick and choose which files to download.

Cheers :-)"

,darkpoet1978,2010-07-30T07:40Z,Reading an epub on an iPad is like being a virgin.  You might enjoy it but you don't know what you're missing.  Go get a real ebook reader you silly Macheads.
,mth978,2010-08-09T15:00Z,"@darkpoet1978: ePubs are the most common file format for all ebook readers, not just ipads. Don't be a smart-ass. "
,poke002,2010-08-18T07:21Z,i havent downloaded it and I already like it.
,darkpoet1978,2010-09-08T16:51Z,"Let me re-phrase that: Apple sucks.

Now go get a real eInk eBook reader.  Save some power and save your eyesight at the same time."
