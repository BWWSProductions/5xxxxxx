Sir
Coming from a country supposedly the most powerful in the World - And not having won any external conflict it entered - or is likely to. 

Thats a prime example of the current U.S. mentality. - < 30% with passports and U571/ Private Ryan as your historical facts.

Fuck! - I give up with 'numbnuts' like you - (Is that the correct term in your trailer park?)"
