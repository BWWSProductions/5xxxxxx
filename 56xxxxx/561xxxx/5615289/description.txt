This is a torrent I found on demonoid, and I'm posting it on TPB because TPB rocks and it must have all the nice torrents =D
Audio quality seems nice, image quality is not so nice, this was converted from DVD9. I'm just posting it here, but as soon as I can buy the original DVD, I'll post it on original quality.
Dr. Sin is a brazilian Hard Rock/Metal band, their songs are very nice. For those who don't know, enjoy, and seed it!
