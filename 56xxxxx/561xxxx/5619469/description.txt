Time Pieces is a good single-disc collection of Eric Clapton's solo hits --
including "I Shot the Sheriff," "After Midnight," "Wonderful Tonight," Derek
and the Dominos' "Layla," and "Cocaine" -- that has since been supplanted
by the more thorough The Cream of Eric Clapton, which combines his solo
work with selections of his Cream and Blind Faith work. Nevertheless, the
compilation still provides a good introduction for neophyte Clapton fans,
especially those who just want copies of his '70s hits.
