If you have ever visited a zoo you may have seen some birds that looked like they were wearing tuxedos. These flightless black and white birds, once called "feathered fish" by some, are called penguins. There are seventeen different kinds of penguins in the world. Your student can learn about these fascinating animals with the 139-page Penguins Project Pack from In the Hands of a Child. This pack includes a 28-page Research Guide and 20 hands-on activities to help your student complete a penguin lapbook about physical characteristics, anatomy, habitat, diet, life cycle, conservation, and the different species (please note: the section on penguin species and 5 corresponding hands-on activities are geared toward older students).
