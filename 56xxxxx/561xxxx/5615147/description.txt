The Lost Riots is the debut album by Chichester-based rock band Hope of the States. Released to widespread critical acclaim in 2004, it was a bittersweet moment for the band following the suicide of guitarist James Lawrence in January 2004. The album was recorded at studios in Ireland, and thought to be recorded partly in Russia, before the finishing touches were put together at Real World Studios in Bath.
