Downliners Sect - The Rock Sect's In
Originally released 1966

Repertoire CD Reissue 2005 (includes 7 bonus tracks)

Rhythm guitarist Don Craine founded the Downliners Sect in 1963 ... a British R&B outfit similar to the Yardbirds and Pretty Things. This is their third and last official studio release before dissolving in 1967. Their crude and raw sound has earned Downliners Sect cult status among today's garage punk aficionados.
