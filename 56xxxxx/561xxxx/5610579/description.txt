This is a Gamecube multiboot file for use on a Wii. It includes The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Timesplitters Future Perfect, and Alien Hominid. I've also included the Wind Waker maps because of the game crashing when you go into a dungeon and open your map.

How to Use:
Burn ISO at 2x-4x speed using your software of choice to a DVD-R, then load on your Wii using a modchip or softmod(Personally I recommend Darkcorp), then select the game using the Gamecube D-Pad, then press A and it should run.
