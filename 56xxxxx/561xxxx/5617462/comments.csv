I'm getting ""No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"""
,quirkynature,2010-06-11T02:08Z,"Will the text of the game be in Japanese? As far as I have checked, the game has no plans for a worldwide release..."
,tidsoptimist,2010-06-11T13:01Z,yeah its all in japanese so its quite hard to understand what they are talking about. Yeah its prob one of those rpgs that wont be released outside J.

There's a reason why it's NTSC-J. You know, the J? THE FREAKING J?

Those who want an english version should wait, the PAL (english included) version is coming out this Friday."
