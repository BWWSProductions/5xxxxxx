,Rod321,2010-06-09T06:58Z,"Hi MKVGuy,
Thank you yet again. 
Download speed was quite good & completed no worries. 
Thanks also to Seeds & Peers"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-06-09T19:27Z,"@BradKITZ, actually that torrent had some problem so I deleted it and re-uploaded it, request you to download the new torrent file.."
,Rod321,2010-06-11T05:19Z,"Hi MKVGuy,
I watched it on the computer & the quality is GOOD. 

However when I converted it with ConvertXtoDXD4 it only created 11 out of 19 chapters. I tried DIVX video converter & it only converted 51 minutes of the movie which is 91 minutes long.

I had the same thing happen with ""A.Serious.Man[2009]DvDrip-x264-AAC[Eng]-MKVGuy"". It only produced 5 chapters. 

I am definitely not complaining, I have had an excellent run with downoads from you.

I will check back in a few days in case someone has a suggestion.

Thanks again."
,kenth_619,2010-06-12T16:31Z,Having the same problem as Rod321 with ConvertxtoDVD4 - only 11 chapters out of 19 converted. Is there any way we can get the full 100% torrent seeded if its not too much trouble? Other than that A:10 V:10 Great upload. Thanks MKVGuy
,kenth_619,2010-06-12T16:35Z,Nevermind got the full 100% file. Deleted the old .torrent file and loaded the updated one here.
[V],MKVGuy,2010-06-14T20:29Z,"Rod321@ I have not updated any chapter file in any of my releases, so better disable them while burning to a disc and you can burn at-least 2 and at-most 4 movies in one DVDR with good quality..

thanks for your comments and feedback.."
,Rod321,2010-06-15T10:33Z,"Hi MKVGuy,
Thank you for the reply, but I am a novice & it appears I can't workout what your advice means.
In ConvertXtoDVD4 I clicked ""Settings / Chapters"" & unticked ""Create Chapter"" & tried converting but it only converted 53 minutes of the 91 minutes. I went back in & unticked ""For titleset longer than"" as well & it only converted 53 minutes again.
Are you able to offer any more advice please?
Many thanks"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-06-19T07:27Z,"@Rod321, could you please recheck the torrent for any missing packet? I have not tried to test it, but try splitting video and audio and merger them again and then try to burn on a disk..

I will give it a try.
Thank you."
