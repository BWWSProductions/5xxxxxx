To all poor souls who are stuck on 96.9% trying to download this game, I have found it through other means and now I'm re-uploading it. *yay*

Works fine, just copy-paste the crack. The first time you turn it on it will take a little long for the game to start so be patient, don't start clicking ctrl+F4 or whatever.

Enjoy.

To those of you who see this game for the first time, it's a unique RTS strategy and I suggest you first play the first game (Battle Mages) or read a review on IGN or gamespot or somethin...
