The film starts with nearly inaudible sound distinction but improves a point after 5 mins.  The visual can be seen without much difficulty.  The lighter areas wash out the picture a bit.  This is an improvement from NEPTUNE's release (still appreciated.)  torrentzone's upload gives the description as to what has been improved and it is GREATLY appreciated.  "
