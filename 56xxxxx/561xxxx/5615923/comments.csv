,LupinVII,2010-06-09T10:15Z,"actually WE dont all hate MKV. Theres always an HD and a normal quality upload for tv shows, MKV is the HD and AVI is the standard version. All you have to do is get one of the many free converters for the MKV file."

,-Leto-,2010-06-09T10:24Z,"there's nothing wrong with MKV, it's your own fault if you can't play them. plus you can very easily edit them with MKVtoolnix (remove useless audio tracks, add/remove subs,...)
anyway, thanks for this new episode"
