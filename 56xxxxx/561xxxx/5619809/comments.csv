This is true scifi.  The idea that someday, we may be able to perform brain transplants is disturbing on many levels.

Brain transplants would explain much of the aberrant behaviour that I witness in the news of the rich, powerful, or momentarily famous.

Hmm...

Maybe?

Of riches, power, and fame, fame is the most fleeting, but fortunately, also the most useless.

Oh yeah, this is a Grade ""A"" B movie.

The audio is kind of interesting, in a technical sense.  Nothing wrong with the rip, but between the acoustics of the room, the levels of the mixer (hot hot hot!  too high db!), and the microphones they were using, the sound is more of what you would expect from a movie from the 30's or 40's.

Easily intelligible, assuming your sprechen English.

The omniscient narrator continues throughout the film.  It adds to the films charm and character.

Good material for some hollywood hack director to rubber stamp into a new film, techniques wise.

Could we be that lucky?"

This will make things faster.

Keep downloading, even if you are not connected to the seed.  The other peers will echo what I send them, eventually become seeds, and then you will get stuff much faster."
,DogNo7,2010-06-11T21:11Z,"Further reduced upload slots to 5.

Again, this will make things faster, even if you are not connected to the seed.

Peers echo, and a smaller number (upload slots) makes the initial seeding work much better.
