Release notes:

On Recovery, his seventh major label studio album, Eminem has reached out to an
exciting list of first-time collaborators, including DJ Khalil, Just Blaze, Jim
Jonsin and Boi-1da, among others.

EMINEM releases Recovery just over a year after his last album, 2009's Relapse.
Relapse put the cap on an impressive ten years of recorded output, and
contributed to Eminem being the biggest selling artist of 2000-2009. In
recognition of this, Neilsen SoundScan named him their Artist of the Decade.
Relapse entered the charts at #1 and, at nearly double platinum, was the best
selling rap album of last year. It also earned Eminem his 11th Grammy award,
winning in the Best Rap Album category. Relapse's first single, "Crack A Bottle"
from Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, soared to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100
(Eminem's second #1 after 2002's "Lose Yourself") and set a SoundScan record at
the time of its release for opening week download sales (418,000). The album
also spun off two other hits; the Top 10 "We Made You" and Top 20 "Beautiful."

"I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year," remarked EMINEM.
"But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to
Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a
completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from
Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title."

Enjoy!
