,squinzy,2010-06-10T12:36Z,Hi...Is this both moto's?
,jeffro30,2010-06-13T00:07Z,"They are not broadcasting both motos any more, at least not since last year, you can watch online the first motos on allisports.com LIVE!!!!!!!!!.......also you can go to the race archive on allisports.com and watch the first motos, they usually put them up like 2 days after the race day."
,slicknick610,2010-06-13T02:26Z,ANNOUNCEMENT: I will not be posting rd 3 450 class. Its not my fault or choice. My local NBC affiliate chose to show paid programming instead. I left several angry voicemails. I hope they show Red Bud in a few weeks. I also hope someone else captured this round.
