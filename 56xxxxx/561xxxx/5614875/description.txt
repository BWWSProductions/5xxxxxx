plot:
The Most Dangerous Man in America" is the story of what happens when
a former Pentagon insider, armed only with his conscience, steadfast
determination, and a file cabinet full of classified documents, decides
to challenge an "Imperial" Presidency-answerable to neither Congress, 
the press, nor the people-in order to help end the Vietnam War. In 1971,
Daniel Ellsberg shook America to its foundations when he smuggled a top-secret
Pentagon study to the New York Times that showed how five Presidents 
consistently lied to the American people about the Vietnam War that was 
killing millions and tearing America apart.
