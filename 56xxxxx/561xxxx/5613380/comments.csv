Thank you for sharing.

Unfortunately, I tried installing this twice but it failed both times.

The first time I chose to install Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 and customized the installation to not install Access, OneNote, InfoPath, and SharePoint Workspace, but the setup installer complained about not being able to find Publisher.en-us\PubLR.cab even when I specifically pointed the error dialog to it.

The second time I did the same thing but also chose not to install Publisher, but I still got the same error.

I have not yet tried to install the applications individually.

Any ideas?

Thank you."
