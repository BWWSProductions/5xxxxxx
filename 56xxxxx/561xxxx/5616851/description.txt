Remarks:
The long breaks between the tracks represent the actual duration on the vinyl gramophone record. The music on this compact digital disc was recorded on an analog medium. It was attempted to preserve, as closely as possible, the sound of the original recording. Because of its high resolution, however, the compact disc can reveal limitations and age of the source as well as artifacts of the editing and re-mastering.

This is a Crepusculaire release

If you want to use the multi-tracker mode, be sure to do it right. I have included them, but ThePirateBay.org must have deleted them in exchange for UDP access to their own tracker. If anyone wants to add this torrent to another tracker, let me know about the trackers where you've uploaded it.
