[V],twentyforty,2010-06-08T18:14Z,"Nope, I do that every now and then when it was advised so by birdie. Specific titles (words) are entered by protectors of righteousness and innocence"" and such swarms are flooded by their gremlins almost 90% of the times."
,jjabrams,2010-06-08T18:45Z,I think its a good idea at least initially so you dont get a load of selfish noobs joining the initial swarm
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-08T19:38Z,"Yeah that too. LOL, people who came to shit all over my place have one thing (for sure): voices in their head... and very often such creatures are paranoid enough to avoid highly encrypted names such as Ht.T.ub.Tme.Mac.hne."
,hkoraddi,2010-06-08T19:40Z,well thanks so much for this
[T],houruoha,2010-06-08T19:53Z,"thanks

,lilars26,2010-06-08T20:33Z,"I think mate is ok.Right 20/40?
Oops,right 20-40?Dash not slash.
I agree with those highly encrypted names.
It takes a special kind of dummy to figure
those out."

[V],twentyforty,2010-06-08T21:08Z,"LOL... My voices telling me that ""mate"" should be acceptable... if has nothing to do with ""mating"". Of mates, of course."
,lilars26,2010-06-08T21:09Z,I don't know.Only 6 seeders?
,jon4fun,2010-06-08T21:12Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

[V],twentyforty,2010-06-08T21:16Z,22. Jump in. TPB script multiply seeder for some uploaders by 10 and divide here by 3. When I'm lucky. Usually by 4-6.

,sasash,2010-06-09T06:04Z,@ 20-40 nothing to do with mating lol!!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-09T07:27Z,"@htctouch: Nope. Same as all others (almost).
 I spend more time on audio than video and you can hear that audio is BETTER by at least 20% over ANY other copy of both movies.

And - you obviously haven't seen the Note on Date Night.

No kiss and tell htctouch, never, please."
[T],houruoha,2010-06-09T07:32Z,"date night the audio is not that bad?
