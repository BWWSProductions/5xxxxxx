== The Notorious B.I.G.: Life & Death ==

A basically chronological, self-made compilation of the Notorious B.I.G.'s hits, deep cuts, and collaborations, made due to the ineptitude of the current, Bad Boy-sanctioned 'Greatest Hits' on the market. Note that the tracks on the first disc account for those released (as opposed to recorded) during his lifetime, whereas the second disc compiles those tracks released in the aftermath of his death. Also, note that preliminary skits/gibberish have been edited from 'Brooklyn's Finest', 'Kick in the Door', 'Going Back to Cali', and 'Nasty Girl.'  Track listing below:
