Ripper Notes:

Lots better source to work with
Original audio had lots of hiss and mic coupling noises. I have taken care of it as best as possible.
Sound level was too low, thus regained it to the specs.

Color was reddish with lots of rainbowing.
FFT took care of them but all courtesy for color correction goes to our Theo3bro's magic touch.
