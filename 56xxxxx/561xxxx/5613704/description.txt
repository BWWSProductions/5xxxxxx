About the song:::

The melodies used in the song were taken from two Indian songs from two 1970s Bollywood/Indian movies: "Ye Mera Dil Pyaar Ka Diwana" from Don (1978) and "Ae Naujawan Hai Sub" from Apradh (1972). Both songs were originally composed by Kalyanji Anandji and sung by Asha Bhosle. This song was remixed for The Black Eyed Peas' fifth studio album The E.N.D. as "Don't Phunk Around.

The Black Eyed Peas acquired the rights for the songs from the music label Sa Re Ga Ma, the copyright holders of both songs, though they never got in touch with Anandji Virji Shah, the surviving member of the Kalyanji Anandji duo.


The Black Eyed Peas were nominated for two 2006 Grammy Awards for the song and won for "Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group". The song also won the BMI Award, which was awarded to the Kalyanji Anandji brothers, for their compositions of "Ye 
Mera Dil" and "Ae Nujawan" used as a basis for the song. The award was collected by Anandji Virji Shah, the surviving member of the duo.
