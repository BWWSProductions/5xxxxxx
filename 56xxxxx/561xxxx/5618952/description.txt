Dreamland is the debut album of Robert Miles. It was released on June 7, 1996 in Europe where it was a hit, and was also released a few days later in U.S. with a new track sung by Maria Nayler, "One & One". This new track became very popular and was later released as a single in the U.S. and Germany. At the end of 1996, Miles released a new version of Dreamland, called Dreamland - The Winter Edition in Germany. It was largely similar to Dreamland, but contains the tracks "4us" and "One & One" (which wasn't released on the European version) and removes "Fable (Dream Version)".
