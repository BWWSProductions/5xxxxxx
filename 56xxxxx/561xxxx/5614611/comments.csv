Feedback in an hour or two."
,Nbitz,2010-06-08T20:13Z,"Well, for me, personally, it still bugs, I simply can't start a game with any country and the one (and only) time I could, the game got stuck after 2 days and 17 hours in game time. I hope it's just me who's doing something wrong."
[T],Knaster,2010-06-08T22:43Z,Nbitz  You need to upgrade everything dotNetFx35setup etc or the game might screw up. thats not a bug thats YOU
