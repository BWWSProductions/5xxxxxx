False alarm, dosie6. AV cracks get identified as a threat because they edit an AV's files, usually (it seems to me) as a 'HackAV' or similar."

Doesn't seem to be a way to change the language either (http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090729060755AAt5Vwq)."
,listenherenow,2010-10-08T02:52Z,"I wonder why this one says 32   and the other one that is strictly in polish - I mean it's written in polish here and on the program - 

  says 32 and 64. 

This says it will go on 7.  But i tried another one earlier that would go on 7 but was not 64 bit compatible. 

  does anyone know if this works on the 64 bit systems? "
