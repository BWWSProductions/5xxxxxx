,rymdkatt42,2011-05-14T16:34Z,"Maybe you should research things better before saying things that are not true. 720p means that the entire picture, including the black lines above and below, would contain 720 lines. When the movie has a wide scope, some of the lines will only contain black, and these lines are usually removed since they don't contain any info. So, a 720p release can contain 544 lines of info for instance, and still be called 720p. "
