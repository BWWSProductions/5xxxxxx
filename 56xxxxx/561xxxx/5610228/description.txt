Multi-million-selling darlings of down-tempo, Morcheeba, will release their seventh and latest album Blood Like Lemonade in the UK on June 7th through PIAS records. The album will be preceded by the single â€˜Even Thoughâ€™ on May 24th. Blood Like Lemonade sees the band return to form, with it being their first album since 2003 to feature Skye on vocals.
Paul Godfrey says: â€™This is the record we should have made after Big Calm but we had to travel treacherous terrains to get back to our natural habitat.â€™ Skye adds: â€˜Friends have been asking, â€œWhat does the new Morcheeba record sound like?â€ My answer? â€œIt sounds like Morcheebaâ€ Of course!â€™
