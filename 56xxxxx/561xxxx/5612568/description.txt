Cuts Both Ways is the first studio album credited to Gloria Estefan as a solo
artist, but is the twelfth overall for her and her band the Miami Sound
Machine, released in 1989 on the spine label of the album's vinyl LP format,
it credits Estefan and the band, just like its predecessor album, Let it Loose.

By 1989, Gloria Estefan was recognized as the Best Female Latin artist in
the world. As the lead singer of Miami Sound Machine she had been
credited in the group's actual name â€“ Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound
Machine â€“ on their 1987 Let It Loose album. With "Cuts Both Ways" many
believed Gloria to have gone solo, but that is not true, Epic Records still
credited Gloria as Gloria Estefan & Miami Sound Machine. It would not be
until 1991 when Miami Sound Machine became a backup band for Gloria.
On the Cuts Both Ways album she combined a lot of pop, contemporary
music, rock, dance music and of course, like all the past albums, Latin
rhythms. The album is considered one of the best albums of her entire
career, and has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide to this day,
topping the album charts in several countries such as UK.

The first single from the album was "Don't Wanna Lose You", which became
a great success; in the USA it reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a
week, becoming only her 2nd number one in the USA. The song also
became one of her best-known ballads and the single was certified Gold in
the USA, while in countries such as The Netherlands, Ireland, Brazil and the
UK it reached the Top Ten.
