I have tried right now to extract part (J.H in Mc.G sketches) you need, but that DVD decided to die... like the most of dvdrs older than 2 years."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-06T21:47Z,"@slntscrms:
Regarding 272p I said 
...""if more than few are interested...""

Regarding your playback problems, advices from Description say it all. 272p is played for years on ALL mp4 playback systems (except cells). Every single [quark[ was ""accompanied"" with words ""experimental"" and  ""for COMPUTERS ONLY"". However, [quark] played fine on ALL systems, including PS3 and iPod.

Therefore, read the lines on the top:
""On ""I have no video"" and ""I have no sound"" I don't waste my time as this is generally a complete lack of knowledge and/or understanding. 

RTFM is the best response I can give.""

So, RTFM."
,yesbos,2010-06-13T17:31Z,"twentyforty dont misunderstand me, i like ur work, but can u put some screens or put a sample file inside a torrent. Because there are many 720p releases. If u have good quality with small size @ that resolution, everybody will start to search urs in always.
Next thing z u jus gave a full description about 720p, but its better if u describe ur torrent details like bitrates of audio, video... (which will give clear picture about quality)
Example: take ZEKTORM, he gives full description and SM, .... I think u will find more hits on ur torrents if u do so.
I am a collector, In Pb most of BRrip are downloaded by collectors. So, @ 700mb Brrip is cool and we need more info than this. Tx.
