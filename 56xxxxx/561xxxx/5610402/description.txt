Jackie DeShannon (born Sharon Lee Myers on August 21, 1944 in Hazel, Kentucky, is an American singer-songwriter with a string of hit song credits from the 1960s onwards. She was one of the first female singer-songwriters of the rock 'n' roll period.
Sharon Myers adopted the name Jackie DeShannon, believed to be the name of an Irish ancestor. Executives at Liberty Records thought the name Sharon Myers would not help sell records. (Wiki)
She recorded, and had hits with "Needles and Pins" and her own "When You Walk In The Room". Both songs covered by The Searchers in UK. Tracey Ullman recorded "Breakawy" on her first album "You broke my heart in 17 places" 1983.
