In this r e m a r k a b l e b o o k , Robert Waggoner has brought lucid
dreaming to a level that is simultaneously higher and deeper than any
previous explorer has taken the topic. Both autobiographical and historical,
theoretical and practical, psychodynamic and transpersonal, as well as
adventurous and cautionary, Lucid Dreaming offers its readers instructions
and insights that they will find nowhere else in the literature. They will learn
how they can become awake and aware while asleep, and how this talent
can change their lives
