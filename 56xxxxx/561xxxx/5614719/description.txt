Leaning Into the Night - Ottmar Liebert

AMG Reviewby Ross Boissoneau

Ottmar Liebert's music bridges the gaps between flamenco, jazz, and world music. On this effort, he takes on 

classical forms as well, merging his styles with a symphony orchestra. The music includes pieces by Ravel, Satie, 

Puccini, and Villa-Lobos, even if the recording may not be wholly classical in nature -- for example, he does not play 

classical guitar. Liebert is an emotional player, but for most of this recording, he tones down his fiery flamenco style 

for more restrained yet enticingly emotive playing. The resulting synthesis may not be exactly classical, but it's 

engaging and engrossing.
