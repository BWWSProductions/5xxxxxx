Two diverse women run a service together, MiraclesRUs, offering to fulfil whatever domestic task might arise that any hard-pressed modern household might want to delegate.

In the opening episode, Caroline is running Household Solutions on her own from the student rooms she is renting - just leafleting through doors, offering a family back-up service.

After a chance meeting with Sylvia, Sylvia is sure she could be helpful to the business; Caroline is sure she couldn't.

Sylvia persists and, against her better judgement, Caroline gets drawn in. And gradually, throughout the series, a mutual respect is formed and a strong business, MiraclesRUs, is built up.
