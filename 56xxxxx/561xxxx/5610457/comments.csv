I will send the files to some friends soon so that they can help me seed."
,Tembaa,2010-11-21T08:05Z,"When i try to extract the files with winrar it says: ""no archives found in selected files and folders""
So can some1 tell me whats the problem."
,zeca.pt,2010-11-24T16:26Z,"Hi! I downloaded all parts (20 parts), but i dont know how to extract cause winrar doesnt recognize them..."
,zeca.pt,2010-11-24T16:37Z,do we have to create a archive with all parts?? please say something!!!!!!
,zeca.pt,2010-11-24T21:23Z,winrar doesn't seem to work...  7zip works perfectly in extracting those files =)
,zeca.pt,2010-11-30T20:56Z,"some maps dont work, even in patch 1.71"
,tghars,2011-01-02T19:29Z,THANKS  !!!!!!!!
,bkinvincible,2011-06-10T14:13Z,Works perfect with 7zip ... u just need to extract the first file (ie : Scenarios.7z.001) and the rest files will extract all by itself ... (that is loads of maps to check em all but most of i have played were working fine in game ) ... the good part is i got a pretty nice speed of 200KB/sec even after such long time of this torrent  there r still 7 seeders (including me)  for this as on 10-june-2011 ... really great stuff from both the uploader and the guys helping it keep alive and kicking .... thanks a milloin to every one associated ... appreciate the effort ... keep it up n i will do the same
,chris228808,2011-07-18T05:06Z,"nice torrent, thanks. works perfect with coh v2.602. my version of winrar wouldnt extract it, but 7 zip works fine. "
,scamlol,2011-08-15T18:25Z,why theres no WW2 folder in my /Users/ username/ Documents/ My Games/ Company of Heroes / ?
,chris228808,2011-09-28T05:22Z,"@scamlol,  ww2 folder is the main coh  folder. if its missing, you need to re-install the game."
,chris228808,2011-09-28T05:28Z,"you people need to start seeding or im bailing out. everybody is using the ""hit and run"". only me and the uploader are seeding , yet i see people downloading this every day from us."
