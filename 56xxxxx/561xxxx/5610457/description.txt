Since I, and a lot of other people have played the regular CoH maps so much that we know them by the back of our hand, i decided to put together a map pack. 

As stated above, it contains 634 maps(!!).


How to install:

1. Extract the files to: C:/ /Users/ username/ Documents/ My Games/ Company of Heroes /WW2 /Scenarios. 

I have compressed them with 7 Zip. (Winrar CAN unrar these files, you just have to open winrar and select them through there)


No need to add -dev or anything like that, just start the game and play!

I know that my upload speed sucks, so i will try to upload it to a few people to start with, so people, PLEASE SEED!


Enjoy!


P.S Please download a program called Tunngle, it allows you to play online with other people (its like hamachi, only better + more people on it).
