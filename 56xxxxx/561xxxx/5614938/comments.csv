,tcyca2010,2010-06-09T13:35Z,"Thanks for making this in HD version, nelwyn.  I am so used to full HD quality and this version seems still not up to my standard.  I guess I am asking for too much.  The picture quality might need to double, triple and beyond the current HD version.  For the best picture quality, the file size might jump to 1GB, 2GB, or beyond."
[T],nelwyn,2010-06-09T16:44Z,"TLC's HD isn't the greatest. It actually looks about the same on the original 1080 file I have of 4GB. The quality just isn't the same as a bluray movie. Depending on how you play it back can make a difference. Have you tried playing it through your HDTV instead of the monitor? It looks about the same on mine, but a little darker and softer.

I get my broadcast through satellite so I don't know if it's any different from what you receive assuming you have TLC HD. "

I only view those episodes on my monitor, so that I can't really compare. The original HD file is 4GB.  Now the file size is 800MB.  Isn't that the picture quality of the clip five time worse than the original?  I guess only the difference in picture qualtiy would be seen only if you seed that original 4GB HD which you probably would not do."
[T],nelwyn,2010-06-12T08:40Z,The difference in size is due to the compression. The original is a M2TS file which is the format used on bluray discs and is not nearly as compressed. It looks marginally better because of the full 1080 but isn't worth the file size. I could do a 1080 that looks nearly identical to it around maybe 2GB but again it won't look much better than this 720 version. TLC just isn't a very sharp channel for HD.

Thanks for the explanation; I know nothing about about video making.  United States is not my home; so no access to TLC HD.  You are the only source that I can enjoy this great series.  I am interested in how better the picture quality the 2 GB file than this.  Why not try that for Inside Kate's World episode? "
,w000ter,2010-06-13T01:13Z,"depends on the bitrate and source.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5522223/BBC_The_Beauty_of_Maps_4of4_HDTV_x264_AC3_MVGroup is a good example of a crisp transfer.   Theres always some sacrifice to get down to this 1gb ish area, its just not going to be anywhere near as crisp as broadcast. the bigger your monitor, the more you will notice the artifacts/lack of fine detail. but as you can see with the bbc rips, if theres slightly more bitrate it makes a big difference."
[T],nelwyn,2010-06-13T08:20Z,"I probably won't be doing the special on Kate again, just the episodes in HD. I did find out something interesting today though and the ""correct"" way of doing the encode by taking out the proper frames due to interlacing. This should fix the slight choppiness on the title screen while making the whole episode run smoothly. The framerate would be a variable one instead of a fixed one (23.976 or 29.97). This causes issues with some players going out of sync like the PS3, but should be fine on the PC.

It causes me to do a 2-step process to first remove the commercials and then encode with a different program, but I think this will give slightly better results. The filesizes will not be the same anymore since I would be encoding by quality and not a fixed size. I'm experimenting tonight doing a 720 and 1080 to see the sizes on them. Probably gonna stick with 720 still."
