,Exile002,2010-06-09T04:27Z,"Wait, so does this really fix the freezing crashes I get in chapter 1? Especially during the tank boss fight?
If so, thank you very much!"
,jarrod111,2010-06-09T04:45Z,"excuse me kind sir, I did not download your original torrent (sorry just chose randomly), 
but THIS ONE: http://thepiratebay.org/search/metal%20gear/0/99/0
I used the Khbbs patch for the game and I still freeze in chapter one.

Will using this patch work for my game or did I have to download YOUR iso?"
,jarrod111,2010-06-09T04:48Z,I'm on GEN-D3 by the way
,Deadmanwalkin_,2010-06-09T06:43Z,it works!!!! it fixes the freezing during the tank boss fight!!!
,kakalbo123,2010-06-09T06:54Z,keus123 can you give a more specific instructions?so i have to PUT the 2 folders at same time and then?what do you mean hit X?i dont know much about the GAME folder seeing i use ISO folder...
,kakalbo123,2010-06-09T06:57Z,T_T dang having prob with crashing on chap 2 after the briefing and the mule/donkey thing during the loading....hey EXILE the crashing at the tank battle is bearable although you dont try pulling off fulton and going near much the tank just keep harassing with LAW and m16..i prefer m16 than m60 much faster
,kakalbo123,2010-06-09T07:02Z,never mind GAME folder is my ISO folder and its outside of my PSP folder so what bout the so called web address?
,kakalbo123,2010-06-09T07:07Z,never mind my so called GAME folder was my ISO folder but i run BOTH the files then it just puts the same web address although it doesnt fix anything it still crashes at the CHAPTER 2 after the scene during the loading...psp slim 2000 5.50 gen d3 here
,poketama,2010-06-09T15:37Z,Just put the two folders into your PSP/GAME folder and run them.

,kakalbo123,2010-06-11T11:56Z,well what i did was place it on both GAME and ISO folders..i happen to delete the one at GAME folder then the fix disappeared on the memory stick so i figured that BOTH FOLDERS NEED TO HAVE THE FIX like nuclear deterrence
,drdre74,2010-06-11T16:32Z,Thanks it worked. It crashed at chapter 2 but now its working so far. Thanks again.
,IZZY-E,2010-06-11T22:26Z,No this stupid game does not work so stop bullshitting. I'm on 5.50 Gen-D3
,IZZY-E,2010-06-11T22:29Z,"No this game does not work so stop bullshitting people. I'm 5.50 Gen-D3 just like Keus and it freezes at the exact same point as always. (when im rescuing those FSLN soldiers) As soon as it says enemy assault, boom it freezes and fucks up. Sorry, but freezing is not fixed so look somewhere else."
,Keus123,2010-06-11T22:59Z,STFU Izzy-E first of all dumbass if it worked for me it should work for everyone else check your fucking plugins and maybe you might find that the KHBBS Plugin should be turned off and make sure your dumbass has download my patched iso jackass 
,kern138,2010-06-12T02:04Z,I think a lot of people would be thankful if someone uploaded a patched version for m33.  
,EmoSaga,2010-06-12T04:01Z,"Yup it worked, all I had to do was turn off the KHBBS plug-ins. Thanks Keus."
,ZangetsuPH,2010-06-12T06:15Z,an iso for 5.0 m33 pls. thanks
,kern138,2010-06-12T08:17Z,"Hey ZangetsuPH, I found one at demoniod that works on my 5.00m33-4. If it wouldn't have been for this game and how much I wanted to play it I wouldn't have learned so much about CFW and the new stuff people are using. I don't get the blank screen after booting the game, but I haven't played through to see if there are any freezing problems yet."
,ghaonhao,2010-06-12T14:13Z,"work perfect , this game is amazing :D"
,kakalbo123,2010-06-12T15:21Z,IZZY-E try to put in both ISO and GAME folders

,pspaddict,2010-06-13T05:29Z,"If you have a PSP running GEN-D3 and want to play MGS: Peace Walker this is what you do. There's a program that allows you to change from D3 to D2 flawlessly. Peace Walker works fine on D2. Other games won't play so you'll have to switch from D2 to D3 but that shouldn't be that much trouble. Here's the D2 Switcher:

,N4o7A,2010-06-14T01:05Z,For some reason it still freezes on me during the cut scene where you have to take down the guard...I downloaded and placed the folders into my psp/game folder and my iso folder as kakalbo123 said to try and still doesn't work. I even downloaded the Gen-D2 to D3 switcher it still doesn't work. I also made sure to turn off the KHBBS plugin (even though I don't really know what those plugins are I just pretty much turned off w.e. plugins that were on). Need help please....
,NinjaRyu,2010-06-30T22:22Z,It still freezes when I try and select mission prep. Anyone else dealing with this issue?
,Espiosso,2010-07-04T13:39Z,Can someone please explain it THOROUGHLY? Because i have clicked X on both the programs and i get that site thing but must i do something with it? It still freezes after the little Chapter 2 cutscene (right before the mission begins it freezes after done loading).
,kakalbo123,2010-07-06T17:17Z,hey guy at the top of my comment just run fix then play but to be sure use keus' mgs torrent also do happen to disable every single bit of plugins except from those that were there already
,kakalbo123,2010-07-06T17:18Z,oh btw hey keus if you read this comment can you give us a 5.50 persona 3 portable iso torrent ty
,persona69,2010-08-31T06:51Z,"***WARNING***

Running the two files fixed Peace Walker, BUT CORRUPTED ALL OF MY SAVED GAMES.

(Although I was lucky since the corrupted saved games weren't that important)

Keus123, Is there a way to undo the two ""fixes""?"
,persona69,2010-08-31T07:42Z,"***

If the fix corrupts all your save files, just re-run a gen d3 patch. :)"
,AXZ92,2010-10-20T12:13Z,"Hi can anybody tell me what the instruction means by hit X on both files??? noob here. ive put the fix in game folder then im not sure what else to do. 

thank you"
,AXZ92,2010-10-20T14:47Z,and also where can i open the files from psp??? all i see can see is a corrupted data in my game folder after putting in the two folders into the game folder
,12345lans,2011-03-26T16:09Z,"guys download it!

,Reginleif20,2012-06-06T06:24Z,A little help please. I can't seem to run these. It keep saying < Error: Script.lua:4: Failed to unassign 'flash0:' >
