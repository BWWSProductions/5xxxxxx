Daughter of Horror aka Dementia
1955 B/W 54 min.

From Wikipedia:

Dementia (1955) is a film directed by John Parker, also known as Daughter of Horror (USA) (recut version). The film is 56 minutes long, and is photographed in a film noir style throughout; there is no dialogue, only the narrator (Ed McMahon) speaks, against a musical backdrop.

The film is perhaps most famous for its appearance in The Blob, where it is the movie playing in the theater when the Blob strikes.

[edit] Synopsis
As the narrator invites us to explore the horrors of an insane mind, a young woman wakes from a nightmare in a cheap hotel room. We follow her through the skid-row night and encounters with an abusive husband; a wino; a pimp and the rich man he panders for; a flashback to her traumatic childhood (she killed her father after witnessing him murder her mother); violence; pursuit through dark streets... Again the young woman wakes up. Was it only another nightmare?

Dementia / Daughter of Horror has been compared to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari as being a portrait of an insane mind from the "inside out".

Though this film was credited to John Parker as being the screenwriter, director, and producer, he was only the producer of the film. Bruno VeSota was, in fact, both screenwriter and director of this film.

The film has an eerie musical score by George Antheil, vocalized by Marni Nixon - there are no lyrics as such.
