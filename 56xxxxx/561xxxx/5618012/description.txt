Notes: Loaded the file into virtual dub, added a denoise filter first on medium, added a sharpness filter only a touch, then was 

onto the colors, pretty poor in all aspects, very red, very bright, so lowered the red quite alot, increased the cyan, and 

green a little to balance out the colors, changed the chroma, turned down the contrast alot to get rid of those white spots 

what blind ya, not as bad now , then used a another filter to get the black back to black, added a few more filters onto 

it but keeping it short, audio we used imagines as they fixed some sync issues, its still pretty poor audio, alot of laughing 

and sometimes hard to hear...but its watchable...anyway Enjoy!
