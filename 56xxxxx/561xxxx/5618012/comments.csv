Using VLC I'd add a little more sharpening and possibly play with the EQ as the audio has that auditorium sound."
,ffonzones,2010-06-12T21:12Z,why do people complain so much?? and i don't necessarily mean this torrent but if it's a CAM it's not a DVD so you will always lose something whether it's audio being bad or video being bad...otherwise if they were both perfect it would be a DVD?? amazing how that works!!!  anyway this copy in comparison to all the others i've looked at it's good!! A/6 and V/7 the pic is very watchable and i tried to adjust myself with VLC player but it didn't do much..... if anything and the audio i adjust to liking with VLC also.... it's honestly the best player i ever used hands down....... it plays anything!!
