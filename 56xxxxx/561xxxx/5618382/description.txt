Note: Since this video file was captured from a VCR playing a VHS tape, the quality will not be on par with a DVD rip.  However, the video is still very watchable and should be enjoyable for any rail fans out there.  Plus, it's a bit nostalgic to be watching something on VHS don't you think?

Note: There are 3 points in this file where about 1 or 2 seconds of video is skipped over.  This is due to unavoidable capture errors, but these small skips do not hinder the viewing experience in any significant way.
