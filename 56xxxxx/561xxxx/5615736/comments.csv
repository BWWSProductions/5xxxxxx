,technosailor,2011-05-16T15:04Z,"Please seed, 429 seeds & 2120 peers, come one people don't be selfish, someone seeded so you can have this great series."
,lazosz,2012-02-11T01:46Z,"Torrent quality is exceptional, though a bit slow!! :) Download speed varied from 10kb/s to 400kb/s. It took me 3w4d to complete it, but it worth it!

Great job addnad!! :))

I will seed only this torrent, until I reach x10 ratio (734GB), cause I hated when I was downloading the torrent with only 5-10kb/s and....I think it's the right thing to do!!! Hope everyone thinks this way! :) SEED people! GIVE MORE THAN U TAKE!!!"
