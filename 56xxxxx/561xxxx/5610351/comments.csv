The application will now quit. It should pick up the update version when restarted."
,ruirize,2010-06-06T16:09Z,You need to add a firewall exception for this program OR download http://minecraft.net/indev/client/minecraft.jar and place in in the lib folder.
,ruirize,2010-06-06T16:25Z,"Be aware though, if you don't add an exception you won't have autoupdates."
,Shawn106,2010-06-06T16:51Z,"I downloaded the file you said to but it still says the same thing I have Windows 7 64bit Im using bitdefender
what do I do?"
,ruirize,2010-06-06T16:55Z,"You added a firewall exception? Try that, see if it works. If not, well, I don't know what's up."

I can get the Loader menu open (Indev Mode, Launch, Infdev Mode, Save Username, etc.) but when I hit launch (in either Legit Mode OR Hax Mode) I get an Unhandled Exception Error: The system cannot find the file specified. I installed .NET 4.0 and added the firewall exception. I even tried manually downloading the minecraft.jar file and placing it in the lib folder, but still no banana.

,Spazman0,2010-06-30T15:40Z,"After doing ALOT of investigation last night, I determined the problem. Notch signed the minecraft.jar differently, and so the loader isn't signed the same as it anymore.

,DJkeemstar,2010-07-01T02:01Z,"well, if its just the minecraft.jar wouldnt he have to update it on his site to? for his clients versions to work they would need the right files of course, did anyone try re downloading the new .jar file and swaping them?"

,Jennacide,2010-07-30T21:44Z,"Anyone else having issues with using the Minecart in Infdev using the old Minecraft JAR? I can interact with it, but impossible to ride it. Making trips to my local mine a chore."
,MixM_Real,2010-07-31T16:23Z,"This is not safe software.
It appears to be but in fact it changes your internet settings.
I dont know maybe it changes more things but my anti virus blocked it cause it wants to access password protected files.
There is no any anti virus in world that can fix internet damage done by this virus cause it has to be done manually.
To fix this go to Control panel,find internet options then click tab called connections .
Click LAN settings and uncheck all.
This should fix problem.
Do not download or open this program.
I advise you to delete it.
Thank you.
Do not ever trust anonymous,who knows who is it.
Thank you for reading this."

,ISwatI,2010-08-01T01:41Z,Yeah having a problem with the cart on this one. Using the old minecraft doesn't give you an updated version of the game. So you don't have the new features like riding the cart. I was wondering if I can use someones account to play offline. Just email me on swat.009@hotmail.com and we can talk. Would be most appreciated
,ISwatI,2010-08-01T01:47Z,"Isn't updated, Can't ride mine cart ect. Isn't the latest version."
,Brak_Arg,2010-08-01T10:37Z,"I had to format my HDD and reinstall java and firefox to get classic working on the browser >:(.


If someone can help me to play this game offline, contact me at brak_arg@yahoo.com.ar."
,Giantjoystick,2010-09-22T22:27Z,4 THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!! I had to do a system recovery  because of this peace of shit!
,ThePirateKing22,2010-10-07T08:22Z,This program crashes immediately when I try to run it.  What do I do? 
,ThePirateKing22,2010-10-07T08:25Z,"Could we get some clearer installation instructions for this?  Because it's not at all clear to me how you're supposed to use this to run the program.  The readme says you need to download the '.jar' file from minecraft.net, but it doesn't say where you're supposed to put it. 

Are you supposed to run the .jar, or MineCraftloader.exe?  Or both at the same time? 

Sorta confusing. "
,ThePirateKing22,2010-10-08T00:05Z,I get the same problem as Habstinat.... 
,Dadera,2011-11-14T07:26Z,"It took me about 20 seconds to figure out what the hell happened after downloading and trying to use it. Turns out Google Chrome can tell you if something is not letting you browse the internet. I used CCleaner and fixed my registry then opened Google Chrome and it told me to change some internet settings, for some reason it was set to LAN PROXY browsing instead of not, so in order to browse the internet I had to manually fix that. So after fixing that all four of my internet browsers (IE, IE x64, Firefox, Google Chrome) worked fine. I suggest before downloading ANY torrents like this install Google Chrome."
