Well,I guess this is the final issue of this series since Moon knight will be 

apearing in Secret avengers and until shadowland comes this is it for his series...

too bad,I really liked it...

Anyway,this issue takes place before secret avengers 1 and chronicles Moon knight 

and Spidey going after Sandman.

Written by Gregg Hurwitz and featuring phenomenal art by Juan Jose Ryp.

Enjoy and seed...
