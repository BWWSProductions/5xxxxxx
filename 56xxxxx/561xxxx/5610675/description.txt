Cyber Gladiators

ATTENTION:

I could not get it to work on xp pro sp3 so far. If anyone can get it to work on xp please comment and I will add it to the description.

I have not tried it on win95 or 98, if you have win95 or 98, mounting with daemon tools or burning the iso to a cd with a free program like imgburn would be where to start.

Daemon Tools Lite http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/
ImgBurn http://www.imgburn.com/

I did not find any no cd cracks or patches for this game yet.
