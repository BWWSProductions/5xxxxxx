Tosca (Italian pronunciation: [Ëˆtoska]) is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, based on Victorien Sardou's drama, La Tosca. The work premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on January 14, 1900. It is one of the world's most popular operas, a hit with audiences from its first performance. However it was not well received at first by critics. Today, Tosca is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire and appears as number eight on Opera America's 2008 list of the 20 most-performed operas in North America.
