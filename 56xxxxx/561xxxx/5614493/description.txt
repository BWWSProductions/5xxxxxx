Posture Analysis System - with two images from your webcam you can perform 3D postural analyses and show your patients posture on a 3D skeleton, which you can use to educate your patients about the importance of good posture.

With the Posturography â€“ Balance & Sway system you can assess your patientâ€™s balance easily, with the help of a Nintendo Wii Balance board or another compatible hardware device., within a few seconds you can obtain valuable information such as center-of-pressure, weight distribution, sway area and speed.

The third system is Spine Scanner which uses an iPhone, iPod, Android phone or other accelerometer to measure the spinal curvature scoliosis and soft tissue.

Range of Motion measurement can be performed with anything from a red headband to an iPhone or Android phone.

Head Repositioning Accuracy - uses a webcam to measure your patientâ€™s cervical joint position sense (proprioception), Ask the patient  to close his/her eyes, turn his/her head in different directions, and the computer measures the movements with incredible accuracy, this might be the future way of assessing whiplash injuries!
