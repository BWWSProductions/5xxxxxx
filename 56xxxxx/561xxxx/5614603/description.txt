Apple CEO Steve Jobs Live at D8: All We Want to Do is Make Better Products


Much has happened since Apple CEO Steve Jobs last appeared on the D stage. At that time, in May 2007, the iPhone had not yet arrived at market, the app ecosystem it would usher in was still gestating and the iPad was simply a long-running rumor.

So the conversation onstage focused largely on the iPod, iTunes and Appleâ€™s (AAPL) relationship with the music industry, and the forthcoming launch of the iPhone. 

Much has changed in three years. But one thing has remained constant: Apple, under Jobs, continues to drive innovation in every industry it touches.
