[T],Knaster,2010-06-06T18:59Z,"Definetly fake.

Furthermore people should buy the games made by Paradox. They are pure excellense"
,Sparkyte,2010-06-06T19:02Z,Can someone upload only the Semper Fi installation file which is 116MB?
,MaxFinn,2010-06-06T19:42Z,"@Knaster 

I've bought HOI3. Furthermore, Paradox shouldnt rip off ppl with features and bugfixes which actually should be included in the actual game. SF is not a addon, its a big ass patch. Definetly not paying $19.99 from a patch."
,semper_fi2010,2010-06-06T19:57Z,It's a full game whith installed Semper fi
,Reimad,2010-06-06T20:06Z,"? 

If it's the full game WITH Semper Fi then how come it's smaller than HOI III without Semper Fi"
,semper_fi2010,2010-06-06T20:12Z,"7zip integrated installer, whick i make =)"
,MaxFinn,2010-06-06T20:19Z,"Somehow, that just doesnt add up."
,blubbda,2010-06-06T20:40Z,why for fucks sake ? all their games are without copy protection ... can ANYone confirm this thing is NOT bullshit ?
,kraask,2010-06-06T21:09Z,"Confirmed this is legit, 7zip of installed hoi3 with Semper Fi. Scanned with bitdefender, no problems found. Have fun :)"
[T],Knaster,2010-06-06T21:19Z,MaxFinn paradox hasnt ripped anyone off it's you thats incapable of understanding you silly wop
,st1ng3l,2010-06-06T21:34Z,"If its zipped, why theres just an 500mb setup.exe in there?
"
,shaddarr,2010-06-06T21:36Z,"It's about 1.3 Gb unpacked, HoI3 v2.0 (ARDS) shown ingame"
,Reimad,2010-06-06T21:36Z,"7zip? But it's just a setup...

Well, I'll just download and decide what to do on the comments from other people. It's fishy, but I want to believe."
,Polcsi123,2010-06-06T21:45Z,"Yeah, it IS Hearts of Iron 3 + Semper Fi. But for some reason, I get some russian or cyrillic letters instead of the letters á,é,í,ó,?,? and so on (playing as Hungary)..."
,semper_fi2010,2010-06-06T21:49Z,"exe instaler makes 7zip archive, 7zip console executive, and unpuck.bat script, script unpacks 7zip archive through 7zip console executive, and removes 7zip archive, and 7zip executive. Any questions, works good, small size, what problemms guys??"
,Polcsi123,2010-06-06T21:49Z,"The best thing would be if someone could upload Semper Fi alone, without hoi3"
,Nikitnz,2010-06-06T22:55Z,It works 100% sure. Installing now. The installer is Russian though I think you can play the game in English. 
,ZeKaiser,2010-06-06T23:10Z,Just wanna let you know that this version is clean! I scanned it Kaspersky Labs 2010. However i would like to have the Semper Fi only instead of having both included. :(
,beastmasta,2010-06-06T23:21Z,"it is REAL
scanned it found absolutely NO viruses with MSE
the game is English by default

However... 
- Installer is in Russian
- The game has watermarks from some Russian website when it starts"
,Reimad,2010-06-07T12:49Z,It's legit.
,blubbda,2010-06-07T13:26Z,bullshit torrent. part of the game is russian. some of the ingame pics have been altered. use this brandname group instead: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5611061/Hearts_of_Iron_III_Semper_Fi-TiNYiSO
,maximusmurderous,2010-06-08T19:17Z,"Definetlet Real,  The installer is Russian but the game is English.  It has the full game plus Semper Fi"
,STFC_Red,2010-06-10T18:20Z,Works brilliantly. Thanks!
,Liely,2010-06-12T18:00Z,Anyone have a link to the 2.01 patch??
,blackwolf23,2010-07-06T13:19Z,"i start installation and it installs then i start the game there are pictures ( rusian )  then there are 4 nations and tutorial a play custom then what ever

,mucgoo,2010-07-10T18:01Z,"Brilliant, thanks.nHowever I suffered crashes even when in my user folder unless I run the exe as admin. (windows 7)nnOP Your meant to have a start screen like you described, click on start custom for the main menu.n"
,soturi_,2010-07-27T07:27Z,"some1 whos not russian pls put NON russian version here. i wont dl this sh#t coz im too ""racist"" against russians"
,Milos2803,2010-07-29T18:58Z,is this with newest patch 1.4 ? plz answer
,Milos2803,2010-07-29T19:01Z,is this with 1.4 patch ?
,svecenik,2010-07-29T22:43Z,You can find new beta updates here!hoi.comule.com!(with out !) No need for game key or some other stupidities!
,GobOGumbo,2010-12-03T17:09Z,I dont believe anyone else has written about a DLL error. Just in case someone has a problem like i did with a certain d3dx9_40.dll just go to dll-files.com and search for it. Download and unzip to main folder. One with the exe in it. Great Job.
,Calatafimi,2011-02-19T03:08Z,the girl to the left of my screen has absolute amazing boobs. great game by the way
