Hour Two Guest: Bill Press discusses his new book Toxic Talk: How the Radical Right Has Poisoned America's Airwaves. More Randi reading recommendations belowâ€¦

NEW: After 50 years of covering the White House, Helen Thomas resigned today at the age 89 amid a wave of controversy regarding a statements she made (video) regarding the Israel/Palestine conflict.

Up to 460,000 gallons of oil a day are being captured by â€œCut & Capâ€, but the feds estimate anywhere that amount only accounts for 37-77% of the crude still gushing into the Gulf. And settle in for a long, painful rideâ€¦ Adm. Thad Allen, the commander in charge of the federal response, acknowledges that even a best case scenario (a successful relief well being completed in August) still means dealing with this catastrophe well into the fall, if not longer.

Thereâ€™s little appetite out there for BPâ€™s $50 million PR campaign, and they arenâ€™t just plastering the airwaves and newspapers with ads, theyâ€™re buying search terms from the major search engines in hopes of driving info-seekers to their own website. Over half of the federal judges where spill-related lawsuits are pending have financial connections to Big Oil. And if history is any guide, donâ€™t expect to see BPâ€™s CEO being frog-marched regardless of what criminal charges stick.

The life that BP CEO Tony Hayward wants back: a multi-million dollar salary, no work on weekends, and he never misses a holiday.  Plus, how a gay escort service helped him get there.

Frank Rich: Donâ€™t Get Mad, Mr. President. Get Even.

More heartbreaking news on the economyâ€¦ 46% of those unemployed have been out of work for 6 months or longer, making it harder and harder to land a job. A gross new phenomenon: want ads stating that the unemployed need not apply. And according to Robert Reich, if weâ€™re going to avoid a double dip recession, we need more government stimulus, tax cuts for the middle class, and tax hikes for the rich.

Meanwhile, George Bush admits to waterboarding and says heâ€™d do it againâ€¦ geez - while former presidents often chose to become champions of human rights, GWB is actually touting human rights abuses. And a new report by Physicians for Human Rights details how Bush-era detainees were not only tortured, but also used as human guinea pigs in an effort to prove that they werenâ€™t being tortured â€“ WTF?! (more)

Also, you may wonder what the hell Elton John was doing singing at Rush Limbaughâ€™s wedding over the weekend. Turns out that Elton was given one million rea$ons to do so, but weâ€™re still scratching our heads. Distracted, impatient and forgetful â€“ your brain on technology (take a focus test). And Sandra Bullock locks lips with Scarlett Johansson at the MTV Movie Awards (video).
