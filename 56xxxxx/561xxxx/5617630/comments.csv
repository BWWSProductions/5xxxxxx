,Memington,2010-12-05T05:50Z,"Oh god, its more than just the audio. WTF heppened to these files? Nothing is timer right. And the offtiming keeps changing, so I can't simply have the audio delayed or the subtitles come a bit faster. Ugh."

,maneo,2012-05-25T05:59Z,"Don't download. There are problems with the file. There are other versions which don't have problems. 

But in fact, the DVD quality version seemed just fine. The anime itself doesn't seem to make use of the 1080 lines of pixels to its fullest anyways"
