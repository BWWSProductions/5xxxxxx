Solid Capture: Screen Capture and Image Sharing Toolkit. Capture anything on your screen. Using our interface or hotkeys, you can capture full screens, windows (fixed or scrolling), or selected areas. Our Rectangle Frame also lets you save multiple captures of an identical size. Edit, format, and share captures. Solid Capture saves captures in BMP, JPG, TIF, GIF, or PNG to open in a graphics program. Preview multiple captures, add captions, and create a new PDF or e-mail.

Capture colors and text. Capture color values or color swatches from your screen. Microsoft Office users can also extract text to use in any text editor. Drag-and-drop images, magnify areas up to 800%, measure screens with Window Rulers, and resize screens. Solid Capture is the perfect toolkit for technical writers, Web designers, or anyone who works with screens and graphics. Capture and collaborate with ease.
