[T],bitstreeem,2010-06-18T21:17Z,I double checked this and it's working with VLC...what player are you using?
,rolanddm800,2010-06-20T21:40Z,"Played it in Media Player, and on my DVD-R/DivX player. I've tried VLC and have the same sound problems. I downloaded this twice too, so not sure where the problem originated. 

Anyone else have trouble?"
,JesusEatsBabies,2010-11-08T09:44Z,"Th problem is with the file, it was ripped at the wrong speed, if you look at people you can see they move a tiny bit faster and the reason the audio is messed up is because with it sped up there isn't enough time to fit all the words in so a syllable or two get cut out. this file is 59.5 min and IMDB says its supposed to be 67min so its 7 minutes faster"
