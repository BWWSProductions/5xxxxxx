An uproarious mockumentary about the British film industry

A year after the collapse of a low-budget British rom-com, documentary maker Andy Wiseman sets out to find out what went wrong. He speaks to the producer, Nicholas Johnson, an alcoholic whose office is a lap-dancing club, the writer, Flynn Beatty, living in a suburban semi, and the deluded â€˜visionaryâ€™ director, Harlan Noble, dwelling in deserved obscurity. But as the cast and crew tell their tale, will Andy ever get to the bottom of the farrago that was â€˜Just for the Recordâ€™?
