I was having trouble uploading the whole zillion gigs of movies so I just split them up into five more torrents that are included in this one.

By the way, my UL speed caps at 30-40kbs. I'm assuming that's because of my corrupt ISP. I spent all day researching ways to circumvent that but it seems my options are scarce unless I fork over money I don't have to use a VPN...

Like the legs of a hooker, I'm wide open to suggestions..."
