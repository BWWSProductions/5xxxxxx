[T],nelwyn,2010-06-07T08:04Z,Welcome back everyone. I will only be doing a standard version of this unless I get enough requests for an HD version or this download becomes really popular. 
,Daywinator,2010-06-07T09:04Z,Woo! Thanks! Are you going to put the other one up? Well I think there was another one..I might be wrong lol!

,tcyca2010,2010-06-07T15:10Z,"Thanks, nelwyn, so good to see you doing the series again.  This show had already proven its popularity in the past, so, please do make and upload the HD version (720p) for every episode."
,aeropolkadots,2010-06-07T18:03Z,Nelwyn ur a life saver i don't have a tv anymore but i am a huge gosselin fan and i was seriously keeping my fingers crossed you would do this!!! I want to thankyou for uploading all the new stuff and i would like to request it in HD thankyou so very much :) I created an account on here just to leave you a comment. I have tons of friends who i know would request it in HD also
,corin74,2010-06-08T03:56Z,My audio is terrible for the entire episode for this and the Kate Special... anyone else having this issue? it's really choppy
[T],nelwyn,2010-06-08T04:09Z,"corin try updating your codec drivers. I use the CCCP drivers and they've always worked great for me. The Shark007 codec pack is good as well. 

I will work on an HD version for this episode. I may ONLY do an HD rip though unless people need a standard version. It's really a hassle to encode the same thing twice, especially since I only keep the HD one for myself. Look for it sometime tomorrow probably."
,tcyca2010,2010-06-08T08:40Z,"nelwyn,

What is the difference between the HD rip and the standard version?  Is the quality of the standard version better than HD rip?  Why not just seed the HD one you kept for yourself?

Large file size isn't the problem nowadays as we all have fast connections and external hard drives are cheap.

Please also seed the HD version of Kate Plus 8 - Inside Kate's World, thank you."
[T],nelwyn,2010-06-08T16:33Z,"They both come from the same source, but the HD rip is twice the resolution (1280x720) so it looks a whole lot better. People with slower machines and single core processors may have trouble playing it back. People in the past have also said they can only play the standard one because of their setup. But I agree, most people should be up to date these days.

For Kate's World, I'll get a better copy of it before making one since it breaks up a bit."
