,Nei1,2010-07-18T04:50Z,"Thanks to TvTeam, here?s another perfect torrent.nnSo far, I\'ve shared this torrent 7.5 times, but the Seeding Rank is still 99999.  That means that other people are downloading the torrent, but it\'s still suffering from Maximum Demand.nnOver one month after becaming available, this Lincoln Center broadcast is still a popular download.  At the moment, there are two seeds -- me @ 100 kb/s (but frequently much faster), and someone else at 20 kb/s.nnThe torrent is rather large at 2 GB, I have other torrents that I\'m also helping to seed, and Comcast is threatening to cut me off (!) if I go over 250 GB/month.  Last month, I used 235 GB, and most of that was Uploading (sharing).nnSo, you semi-Classical music lovers, when you\'re done downloading, how about if you make it a habit to keep your torrent manager open and help me do some SHARING??nnMany hands make light work.  Many computers make light uploads.nnThanks,n       -Neil-"
