Quoting from fiction is no basis for valid argument."

,]eep,2010-06-16T16:29Z,"Looks like another attempt to put God in a mould that the writer can relate to. Doesn't read like proper logic though.
Since time is a physical property, and God is outside the physical domain how can change be possible in God for a human observer who is bound by time? There is no ""I am"" or ""I will be"" for an entity outside the timedomain."
