I was so looking forward to this movie but it was absolutely so disappointing, not at all Jennifer Lopez's standard. Normally her movies are quite good and will stand the test of time but this one was so disappointing that I felt embarrassed for her, definitely worth a Razzie, but hey the year is still young, look at Sandra Bullock....Jennifer still has time to win an Oscar!! Just look at Sandra Bullock!

The first few minutes were actually quite good but after 10 minutes, I felt none of them delivered, except the DOG! It was actually quite good. The supporting cast was terrible. They were just standing around delivering lines.

Release Date: 23 April 2010 (USA)
