,mtm2010,2010-06-08T18:04Z,Is this real 320 kbs? Somebody plz let us know after downloading
[V],nos1977,2010-06-08T18:12Z,"UPDATE***

The best buy track list is wrong. The track list thats's on this cd is from eminems own website this is his recovery cd, period. I've listened to it twice. His single Not Afraid isn't even on that track list. 
http://www.eminem.com/blog/default.aspx?nid=26485"
[T],johnnyrep,2010-06-08T18:20Z,"obviously pushed up to 320kbs by nos1977,thats low bro :("
,xProdigy,2010-06-08T22:37Z,good looks nos
,mtm2010,2010-06-08T23:31Z,I doubt that this is the final CD. Best buy list looks logical although it's totally wrong.Where are the skits?Are they gonna surprise us with the official release?
,akku08,2010-06-08T23:54Z,the name of song number 17 (hidden track) is called 'Here We Go' and is produced by Havoc. This album is really good; definitely trumps Drake's Thank Me Later. But I highly recommend to buy this album and Drake's becuase they are both freaking amazing!
,iDagda,2010-06-09T01:09Z,"Been waiting for awhile for this,
Thanks noFS!"
,iDagda,2010-06-09T01:16Z,"Oh yea, and confirmed 320 kbps."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-09T02:52Z,sorry definately not 320.  sound isnt the worst but its pretty shitty.  im so sorry i wasted a disc on this torrent.  guess its good until the real 320 comes around.
,PhilnLisa,2010-06-09T08:56Z,"There is definitely something not quite right about this sound....It's very tinny (running through a very good quality stereo) And the music overlaps too much, it's like a rough copy, it does the job though, if you want to hear what he's released, but the actual version will be quite different..."
,doandroidsdreamofelectric,2010-06-09T09:23Z,"sounds no better than the other ones,and im pretty sure this is no retail as no other site is showing 320 version except the ones nos uploaded on,nice trick nos wont be falling for it again,i'll wait till the real retail comes out "
,CyanideX,2010-06-09T11:04Z,This is BY FAR my favorite album of Eminem's! Thank you so much for this upload! Although the sound may not be 320kbps it is definitely great quality.
,venomqman,2010-06-09T13:55Z,"NoFS i hear all these comments about this not being true 320kbps, you have stated

you need to tell us if the above is ture or a load of bollocks. I have always thought you did proper stuff but if your faking it that really sucks.

I personally don't care where it came from or who did what with a when and why and where. As long as I can download it and burn it to a CD then I'm thankful for the people who share it."
,venomqman,2010-06-09T16:58Z,"Alright NoFS i'll add an apology for coming over like a bit of an asshole, but I am under the impression that ""upscaling"" mp3's / re-ripping at higher bitrates(any re-ripping at any bitrate) only reduces quality, thats seems quite logical. So I guess I simple have missed the point of this upload. I respect the effort you have gone to, i guess thanks for that, but I don't see why. thats all I was trying to say. Peace"
,rob3rtzman,2010-06-09T18:02Z,fairly nice quality. definitely buying this when it comes out.

***Eminem is back***"
,chacarronmacarron,2010-06-10T03:04Z,This is a transcode smh. There is a v2rip out there but i have no idea why he didn't upload it...
,chacarronmacarron,2010-06-10T03:06Z,also nofs doesn't even get exclusives all he does is uploads a leak. Not even the best version out.
,PhilnLisa,2010-06-10T04:19Z,"I'm really disappointed by the deception here, I know, I know, if you don't like it don't download, but nos1977 is someone that I never bother to even check the comments, as it's always going to be good......
That is not the case this time, it's been upscaled to 320, the quality is significantly worse than the group rip that's out...It's a shame this is in the top 10, it's like a ts equivalent of movie torrents......
Download if you want to, but you will be MUCH better of with the 79 meg grouprip It's ruining the first few times you listen to the album..

Oh and there are no skits, Eminem confirmed some time ago, that this will be his first album without skits, or ott humor :("
,Touchmetal,2010-06-10T05:15Z,"Its a shame really....

People can't be bothered to post content or even thank people that do upload something, but boy, if someone posts something vaguely unsatisfying, you've got ten a-holes jumping out of the woodwork, making rude comments.

What has the world come to..."

The quality is not a problem me...Wanted to listen to this album ever since this was announced...

,Rodan.H,2010-08-04T23:09Z,"I lol'd the fword out att Digdug333's comment. It's not about how rare things is and besides if it's rare and good then it's mindblowing to you. It's about music bringing message there is no work put in to it in todays music, and I'm only 15. The only one who actually should go fuck themselves is commercial people. In my block so to say girls/boys talking about how fake people are while listening to fake people like. Lady Gaga, Ke$ha etc etc. You know the whole Mtv. So you actually see through people like glass. Digdug, grow up is a piece of advice. Sweden REPRESENT!"

,jeff555wms,2010-08-10T02:32Z,I like Eminem but damn he fell off on this album. Definitely time to go back to the lab !!!!
,t3hveg,2010-08-11T22:37Z,"Great quality and downloaded fast.

Unfortunately this album is terrible, downloading this just saved me from wasting money on this mediocre album.  I'll support him when he can actually produce something worth listening to."
,pirator1,2010-08-14T16:25Z,"To jeff555wms, and all other haters. Get the Eff out. If you don't like it, why do you even bothter clicking on teh link to this awesome material? 
- No, it's not like all his old shit. Now, he's rapping about his life. What has happened to him and the people around him. 
This is the best album he has ever made. If you actually sit down, and listen to what he's actually saying, you'd get it.

He is the first, real successful, white rapper. Why? Because he's Marshall Bruce Mathers.

All other rappers, especially the black ones(50Cent, Lil' Wayne, etc), all rap about titties, ass', vagina, and of course, money. - That's all they are. 
I'm not saying I do not like the other rappers, I'm just saying, Marshall is far superior to them.

That's all for now.
Eff y'all, haters."

why would anyone support mainstream artists for? justin beiber, jay z, eminem, green day, kesha, lady gaga are all rich. while you're working and busting your ass for $9 an hour at some shitty job these people are sitting in hot tubs full of money in mansions with more money then they know what to do with it. a person downloading an album instead of buying it won't hurt them."

,HiroPro2,2011-03-05T01:51Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!"

,TyMod,2011-04-24T20:31Z,"@HiroPro2 A constant bit rate, though causing the song size to be larger is much better.  I encode music with LAME but with a CBR at 320 kbps.  They sound superb to anything. Also it is recorded at a 45100 Hz frequency which works wonders. :) I do agree with you on Joint-Stereo so the sounds amazing out of 1 or more speakers.  You don't always have to have a ""pair"" of speakers.

Anyways,  Thanks NoFS, great quality as always so no complaints.  I understand everyones different perspectives on how the want their music.

AND BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
