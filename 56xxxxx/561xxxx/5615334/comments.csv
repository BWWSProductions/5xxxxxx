,Ship_Modeler,2010-06-09T03:18Z,I'll give it another try.  This is one of my favorites.
[T],bitstreeem,2010-06-09T03:27Z,"I would not be surprised if many of these old coded flicks will not play on a set top DvD player.  I have only checked them with a computer with a boat load of codecs to choose from.  If you really want to play them through a hardware DvD player you might try AVS Converter (available right here on The Bay) and recode the movie using the updated codecs in the converter.

Also remember, if the movie looks a bit grainy on your computer it will be amplified on a bigger screen...=)"

I actually saw this flick as a kid, in the Lowe\'s Theater (Steinway) in Astoria, NY. Please bring back MaiWhangs memories of youth. MaiWhang is FIRMLY implanted in B/C-movies! A toast to you!"
