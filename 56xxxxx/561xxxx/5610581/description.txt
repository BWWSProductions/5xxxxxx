NB This is the original two hour play that last November's
enfeebled 55 minute broadcast was made from.

Reconstruction of key parts of the Scopes' 'Great Monkey Trial' drawn
from original sources and the trial's transcripts.

The trial, Scopes v. State, 152 Tenn. 424, 278 S.W. 57 (Tenn. 1925),
arose from a prosecution under Tennessee's 1925 'Butler Act' which
prohibited state funded schools from teaching " ... any theory that
denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and
to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals." 

Fully engaging, and at times very funny. Odd, though, to hear Ed Asner
putting the conservatives' position.
