,dlarrym,2010-06-11T05:46Z,"Thanks big time. Some idots were trying to tell the TPB regulars that this series was already cancelled just due to the delay between the airing of the the 3rd episode and the 4th, 5th. There was about  a 3 week halt in the airing but it wasn't cancelled. Why wouldn't one goto the ABC website and read up on this before posting false comments. It wouldn't be a big deal but MANY MANY MANY TPB people truly believed it was cancelled and ONLY after posting on about 10 other torrent sites that it WAS NOT cancelled did the 4th episode finally get uploaded. The same false rumor is going around about SQUIDBILLIES on Adult Swim. The 4th season isn't even over yet some idiots are labeling the 11th through 14th episodes of season 4 as the NEW season 5 episodes and incorrectly labeled them as season 5 episode 1, 2, 3 ,4. PLEASE folks RESEARCH what you post BEFORE you post it. (comments that is)...as to BitUnity... This upload ROCKS!!!!! Thanks BIG TIME...peace! "
