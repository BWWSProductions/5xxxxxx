,phillip69,2010-07-29T19:54Z,"To get an iso from these .rar files. First, get Winrar, then open the folder where the game is downloaded to, then find the .rar file (not .r00 and .r01), then just click EXTRACT.  Then, choose the folder you want to extract the iso to. Then you will get the iso to burn to cd or hard drive. As for me I have wii version 4.2u running usb loader and the game works perfectly. Not sure about dvd's though."
