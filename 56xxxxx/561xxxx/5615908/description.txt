I had just finished watching the original series of Yu-Gi-Oh and decided it was time to move on to GX. But when I checked here at ThePirateBay (and also at Demonoid), I found very little of the series available. What a shame, I thought. Then I realized that I could go gather the episodes into a torrent!

I mainly used a certain "mega" "uploading" site to download the episodes, and for the ones they didn't have available, I used a certain "tube for you". Each episode is numbered and named, with "[episode name] part [x]" appearing as '[episode number] - [episode name] (x)'.The episodes from that tube for you are (sadly) cut into segments ~10 minutes long, so they are further seperated into multiple files with an underscore and number following the normal name to show it is split. Oh, and please don't b!tch about the quality. I just ripped these from other places online; it's not like I recorded them myself.

This is my first torrent upload, so please don't shoot me if I did something wrong. Pointers are greatly appreciated.

Cheers!

Edit: Guess I didn't search so well for all the episodes here... and no, I'm not trying to butt in on your excellent work, Chryloz.
