,kiyaquriaee,2010-07-03T05:32Z,"I dont get how to install it. All it is is a  bunch of numbered files and a sfv file that I have no idea how to use. Do I just paste them into the The Sims 3/game/bin file or am i missing something? This is the file I need to update so that I can install Ambitions, right?"

,hahalolfailmupp,2011-05-10T20:17Z,"If you have a region error, open regedit, browse to 

32bit
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Sims

64bit
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Sims

And change all SKU values to 2, if that doesnt work try any number between 1 - 7.

if you can't manage that or if you are unsure if you can edit the registry don't bother."
