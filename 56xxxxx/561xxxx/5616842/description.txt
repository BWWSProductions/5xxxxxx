           Christine (Phoebe Cates), a student at an exclusive            
           all-girls private school, is in love with Jim, who             
           attends an academy for boys nearby. Christine's arch           
           rival Jordan also has her eye on Jim, and she is willing       
           to do whatever she can to steal him away. Jim's uber-slob      
           buddy Bubba is going with Betsy, Christine's cynical           
           friend, though he would probably be unfaithful if any          
           other woman were willing to get near him. Bubba and his        
           pals sneak into the girls' school dressed in drag in           
           hopes of reaching the Promised Land (better known as the       
           women's shower room), while Christine and Jim run away         
           together for the weekend, though their escapade isn't as       
           romantic as they had hoped.
