,arildus,2010-06-14T16:47Z,Thanx;)
,TacoSteve,2010-06-14T18:00Z,"@Kiriee: Technically he does NOT have a valid point in saying that there should be no reference to ""dvd rip"" at all because R5 refers to REGION 5 DVD used in Russia and other places, the only thing that differs between DVDs in the west and R5s is that R5 are usually done as direct Telecyne to DVD transfers. Therefore at one point in time R5s are DVDs, and can be called ""DVDrips"" if someone rips them from an R5 DVD, ok?"
,TacoSteve,2010-06-14T18:01Z,"Could anyone recommend a good way to convert this(and any) R5 .avi files into ones that would play on a divx standalone? 
These all seem to run about 10-15seconds before cutting off when burned to a data disc and played in my DVD player?

Any response would be greatly appreciated.
Cheers!"
,rafayel,2010-06-14T20:47Z,"TacoSteve

u can call it dvdrip if the audio was russian....but the audio is in english.....so just call it R5 like others VIP uploader....why we must differ from others? I like free stuff and good stuff....

Extremezone is a good uploader...he has done a great job....a little advice from his downloader i think wont make him sad or broken heart....
