,Bullet_0verdose,2010-09-01T16:23Z,"Hi, Your Torrent Is pretty amazing, I've been searching for all of those other halos for years without luck, and now you've uploaded them all, but its a shame that nobody seeds this masterpiece ever, and I can't download it.
Oh by the way, I noticed you don't have Purest Feeling 2, I own it, if you want it just speak and i will upload it, so you can have an ever nicer torrrent! "

GREAT Torrent either way, thanks!!!"

,ph0end,2010-12-28T11:41Z,"@ metroidian
To the best of my knowledge, there are no good copies of supernaut to be had.
I must have grabbed about 15 copies over the years, some even on the venerable cassette tape, and every single one was that same poor-quality recording that I'm sure you've played for a thousand years...
I think even the original was a poor dub of a one-off session recording, and it's all we're getting."
,castiboy,2011-07-03T12:40Z,"judging from the upload date, i'm guessing Pretty Hate Machine is not the 2010 remaster... bummer.
great torrent nonetheless."
,Draveil,2011-07-04T22:15Z,"Please seed :P ive got a 20 kps while using high speed internet.

,theonlyangel,2011-10-04T05:32Z,"Nice torrent, Thanks Petyr_Wrath, i was just looking for 2 or 3 songs and i ended with 2GB of music, now i'm just missing all the instrumental versions from remix.nin.com"
,Jardon21,2011-11-01T04:34Z,thank you so much!
,AeroSS_87,2011-12-30T04:42Z,"Holy best effing torrent EVER!!!   Guys, this IS the NIN collection you need.  Very neat, all 320kpbs, and I swear it's ALMOST too much.  It has literally everything.  A true, sincere thank you to the uploader for this. You've made my life!"
,theandyman0,2011-12-30T14:21Z,"Sorry it's a year late, but those of you looking for Supernaut... have you tried this?
