Can anyone point me to a good safe FREE dvd rip software I'm currently using magic dvd ripper and it's a free trial..

Also when it ripped it ripped the film in two parts (I guess because of size) And for some reason I could not make a torrent with both of the files. It would only let me do them seperately. So I had to piece them together and convert them. (I think I lost some of the quality in doing so) If anyone can help me with that shit would be big help cheers 

enjoy and please seed.."

,RGrimm,2010-06-17T06:50Z,Can't seed if the uploader doesn't.
,ommadon,2010-06-17T07:54Z,I' am seeding this. I have been seeding this since I uploaded it. But I'm getting a shit speed I cant help all the hit and runners who aint helping to seed it.
,ommadon,2010-06-21T15:41Z,hey can someone tell me how to boost my upload speed. I have seeded this for over a week now and Im still the only seed so either no one has it downloaded yet or eveyone is hit and running. I am going to stop seeding this soon so I can put more up so I hope people start seeding this soon or it will die cheers

To improve upload results (all that apply):
1) Remove or increase upload bandwidth limit, if you have applied one--total or per-connection.
2) Toggle the super-seeding option on your client.  It looks like each piece is getting distributed to everyone connected to you before it moves on to the next piece.
3) Set the number of upload slots on your client to a suitable number for your Internet connection's upload speed.  Your upload bandwidth, which appears to be a limited commodity, should be spread over a manageable number of peers, so the directly-connected peers will be able to download the torrent faster and provide the data to people not connected directly to you.
4) More lottery balls and racehorses through the Tubes."
,ommadon,2010-06-22T14:05Z, @rgrimm Cheers for the tips dude I have set the upload speed to unlimited I cant seem to find a super seeding option anywhere according to my bit torrent the highest upload speed Im getting is around 3.5kB/s sorry Im a bit of a noob to all this I will keep seeding till people get it cheers..
