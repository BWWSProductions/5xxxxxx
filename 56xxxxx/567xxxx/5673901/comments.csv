As soon as you people download it, you could tell me if the program is working for you too. Thanks.

Porfavor, compartidlo, al menos una semana.
Tan pronto como lo bajeis, podrĂ­ais decirme si os va funcionando tambiĂŠn como a mi. Gracias"

,Rjstetson,2010-07-09T02:35Z,ok what you suggested works now when at the installation there is no English lang. option
,oscarpinol,2010-07-09T02:53Z,"I did choose english or spanish...nThe first step, when u just start installing, the program show you up in the right corner a place where u can select languages...nLet me know if i am wrong, but i am sure of that"
,Rjstetson,2010-07-09T05:49Z,I can choose the language for the installer at the beginning but when you put in the serial number(at this page) you have to choose a language again and English is not an option.

,zoiboi94,2010-10-09T16:39Z,"To reset to English, go to the install directory > Locales > es_ES > Support files then 
make a backup (e.g. Rar or Zip) of the file tw10428.dat and delete the original file. Now photoshop should
run in the default language English."
