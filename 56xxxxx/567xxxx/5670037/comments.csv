Any chance of an English copy??"

,ljs9108,2011-04-04T05:22Z,"File didn't work for me.
Thnx anyway."
,kritias,2011-04-12T10:38Z,"Dumb shits... multi audio in the title means that there is more than one audio track, and one of them is not english."
,d4nj,2011-07-10T01:57Z,sorry. How do you play it in English?
,scraps4point0,2011-12-12T06:44Z,My audio came in completely fucked. =/
,Crackizwack,2011-12-22T21:19Z,"guys, use a media player called kmplayer. It's pretty user friendly and you can change audio files easily during a movie"
,Spambolo,2012-05-03T10:14Z,"The audio is perfectly fine, and was - for me anyway - English by default."
,sabeku,2012-06-01T21:28Z,"Thanks for the upload, however I later discovered a sort of bug on the .avi file. I do not recall it being the same message da_300_squirrels had, but there was still something attached.
Regarding the video, the quality was superb in both video and audio and a rather large aspect ratio than most others I've downloaded from TPB. Thanks alanwatson, but perhaps a virus or malware scan would be best before playing this file. 
As for language issues, I had no problem playing it with VLC player and it went directly to English automatically."
