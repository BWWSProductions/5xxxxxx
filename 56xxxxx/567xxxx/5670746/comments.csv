,Nik101,2012-01-29T17:01Z,"Capt_Minus, first of all thanks for the amazing upload.I'm having the same issue as fellow cbaros, tried to use it on both XP and 7-64bit, but the ""GSM run-time not installed"" note popped up on both.It continues to do the installation and instead presents me with the program.So it works except that it doesn't save my progress.Minor bug and it's not that important.Again thank you :) "
,Nik101,2012-01-29T17:01Z,p.s. have tried it with both poweriso and daemon pro
