,DraggoCZ,2011-02-27T12:07Z,"The most epic game soundtrack iÂ´ve ever heard. ""Suicide Mission"" and ""The End Run"" rulezz. Thx for upload."
,sejong92,2011-04-06T15:21Z,Hey do you have the soundtrack for Mass Effect 1?
,Unknown16,2011-04-24T11:39Z,Words cannot describe how epic this soundtrack is. I just can't get enough of The Suicide Mission and The Illusive Man. Lets hope ME3 soundtrack will be the most epic-ness out of the three. Thank you.
,Igneous_X4,2011-08-20T11:29Z,"It's a very good soundtrack. Jack Wall did a superb job, and I'm sorry he won't be returning for ME3.

The audio quality is listenable. However, I don't think it actually sounds like V0 MP3. There are way too many artifacts, particularly on the heavy percussion. It sounds more like someone re-encoded the game's original Ogg Vorbis tracks (~94 kb/s) to MP3 to ease mass consumption. I could be wrong, though."

Why upload mp3's in VBR...

Yes, I'm an Audio Nut; FLAC or 320, I'll go as low as 128 if it's distortion-free. VBR's are notoriously filled with pops/clicks.

I'll give this a go though, because I really do love the music.

-though, I do still wonder why people rip in VBR; not like storage or connection speeds matter anymore :("
,Eternal_,2011-09-21T08:48Z,DLing this whilst seeding ME1's OST.... boss. xD
