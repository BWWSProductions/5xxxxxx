Here is the official soundtrack for Bioware's 3rd-person RPG shooter Mass Effect 2, released on iTunes and Amazon 19 January 2010.

The other torrent available on TPB is a re-encode of this.  However nice that might seem, there is no such thing as converting upwards without the original source material.  "Converting upwards" actually reduces quality and is counter-productive.

Cheers mateys!
