         More than 50 years ago, South American scientists             
         attempted to cross-breed bees that would produce more         
         honey than ever before possible. But instead, they created    
         a monster. Today, these giant bees are on the loose,          
         spreading northward and invading US cities. MonsterQuest      
         examines how these killer bees attack with an unseen          
         ferocity and discovers that the bees may be adapting to       
          colder temperatures, making them an even greater threat.
