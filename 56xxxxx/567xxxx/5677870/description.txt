Long recognized as the world's most powerful mathematical software system, Mathematica has steadily grown in breadth and depth to become today an unparalleled platform for all forms of computation.

With thousands of original algorithms and a tightly unified overall design, Mathematica spans projects of all sizesΓÇöfrom simple calculator operations and educational demonstrations to large-scale systems deployment and maximum-power supercomputing.

If you're doing anything technical, think Mathematica--not just for computation, but for modeling, simulation, visualization, development, documentation, and deployment.

Why Mathematica? Because this one integrated system delivers unprecedented workflow, coherence, reliability, and innovation. Rather than different toolkits for different jobs, Mathematica has been built ground-up over nearly 20 years to deliver one vision: the ultimate technical application and environment.

 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

                Wolfram Research Mathematica v7.01 for Windows

  Whats new?
   - Performance enhancements to core image-processing functions.
   - Right-click menu for quick image manipulation.
   - New tutorials, "How to" guides, and screencasts.
   - Thousands of new examples in the documentation.
   - Improved documentation search.
   - Integration with mathematical handwriting-recognition features of

   - Integration with the upcoming release of gridMathematica Server.

  If you're doing anything technical, think Mathematica - not just for
  computation, but for modeling, simulation, visualization, development,
  documentation, and deployment.

  Why Mathematica? Because this one integrated system delivers unprecedented
  workflow, coherence, reliability, and innovation.

  Rather than different toolkits for different jobs, Mathematica has been
  built ground-up over nearly 20 years to deliver one vision: the ultimate
  technical application and environment.

  Following closely on the dramatic reinvention of Mathematica in 2007,
  Mathematica 7 continues the momentum of innovation to deliver an array
  of new capabilities, greatly extending the state of the art in many areas,
  and bringing a dozen major new application fields into the integrated
  framework of Mathematica.
