,retardoface,2010-07-05T07:56Z,these ones seem smaller am i correct?
,retardoface,2010-07-05T08:09Z,"niOce rip MAN! just remembered to ask you, do you have caress of steal, cause i fucking love the song necromancer if i got that shit on vinyl rip id poop my panties"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-05T08:19Z,well i brought down the volume quite a bit (it was 38/100 before and now its 30/100) because people were complaining about clipping (and they were right) so i imagine that makes them a bit smaller. but this is Rush's shortest album (33 mins i think) so it would come out small..
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-05T11:09Z,"i do have Caress of Steel but it's kinda scratched a little to much to do a transfer, so i'm going to wait till i find a nice clean copy :D"
,retardoface,2010-07-06T02:36Z,"ahh thats too bad, btw do you know how to turn off these stupid fucking noisy adds for games on piratebay that keep poping up at full volume, its really god dam annoying"

,retardoface,2010-07-07T02:40Z,"are you shure this lower volume is better, cause i listened to red barchetta on moving pictures, it seems theres less detail maybe thats because its just playing lower im not shure"
,retardoface,2010-07-07T02:42Z,"ahh nvm just listened to the old moving pictures, its way too loud lol"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-07T02:55Z,"i'm soo jealous you have a mfsl of dark side, can't wait to hear it :D"
