I tried IsoPower, MagicIso and DaemonTools and none of them can mount it so that I can see the content & play.
I don't want to burn it, I hate CD-s."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-08-03T00:47Z,"DTLite4356-0091   (Daemon Tools) did the job, mounted it. WinDvd could not play it but Media Player Classic did; File/Open Directory/ E..F ..G where ever you mounted it).
Still why make things so complicated.
Good picture by the way. Thx."
