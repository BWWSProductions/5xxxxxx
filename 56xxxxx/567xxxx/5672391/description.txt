Jealous of how quickly Sonny is gaining popularity, Tawni hides her fan mail, so Sonny feels bad and thinks that she is the least popular of the 5 cast members. Not knowing she had fan mail, Sonny dresses up as a boy and writes herself a fan letter from "Eric". How long can she keep the secret from everybody (especially Tawni and So Random!'s exectutive producer Marshall Pike)?
