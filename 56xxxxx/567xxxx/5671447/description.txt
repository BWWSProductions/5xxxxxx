Grandaddy & Earlimart / Indie Pop Rock / Original M4A & MP3@320 (Converted M4A)





Members of the bands Grandaddy and Earlimart are long time friends who have toured and recorded together for years. In late 2009, they made the decision to pull some of their long gestating collaborations together and make good on the oft-discussed promise of releasing their debut album I Heart California.


Ethereal California-based indie bands unite! TwentyFourBit points out that former Grandaddy frontman Jason Lytle and former Grandaddy drummer Aaron Burtch have teamed up with Earlimart members Aaron Espinoza and Ariana Murray to form a new band called Admiral Radley. The new quartet already has a website, a Twitter, a few dates lined up, and some T-shirts for sale.





The band announced their formation on their website at the beginning of the month. They also hint at a mysterious backstory for the band: "The music, the shows, and the press are all secondary. Above all, we are looking for Admiral Radley." On the site and the Twitter, we see a few possible clues as to this Admiral's identity: an officer's cap, a Twitpic of a ship's wheel, stuff like that.

They've also posted a stream of a new song called "Nuthin'" to the website. The song is about 20 seconds long, and it consists of the band's members harmonizing the song's title three times. Evidently, they're not taking this new enterprise too seriously.
