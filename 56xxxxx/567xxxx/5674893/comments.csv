,Klimt_Westwood,2010-07-08T09:40Z,"Dear bitstreeem, I'm thoroughly enjoying your uploads of golden/cardboarden age vintage SF.

It's also funny that your channel has turned into an old geeky geezers' favourite hangout, a ""Captain Proton's Astounding Sanatorium of Cheesy Wonders"" of sorts.

Now in Amazing 2D VHS-o-Rama!

Thank you very much and keep up the good work!"
