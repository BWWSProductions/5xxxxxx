,OctoRent,2011-03-15T03:20Z,"This isnt even close to the complete discography, and it contains .wma files. That should be enough of a hint for you right there that this isn't created by anyone who is a collector of music, otherwise they would have been embarrassed to host the torrent.

PLEASE, check to make sure the discography was added by ""FiRe"". D12 Discography Coming for you, sir. The one with your hand up in the back. "

,buddah12,2012-06-25T14:25Z,"It Never ceases to amaze me how so many come on PB to bitch and rant about the offerings, when the powers that be are trying to put PB on lockdown. The FREEDOM to SHARE files among each other has been the deciding factor in the fight to free the web of corporate and government control and influence. So if you just gotta rant, rant to congress or your representative about the travesty of copyright laws and the record company execs who get rich and stomp on the little man. Please STOP criticizing each and every download, its petty and stupid. Larry McLeod, United Kingdom, Proponent of FREE INTERNET!!!!!"
,78Mayam81,2012-07-11T04:07Z,"one of you loud mouth, e-thug, little fucks actually called this guy a ""fucking fag"" because the torrent he went to the trouble to offer your leeching, whiny, bitch ass for free, was not all you felt entitled to?!?!  'WWWAAAHHHHH! Mommy I wanted a free corvette not a camaro! I'm gonna go pout and throw a temper tantrum until I get my way now!!!'  I don't know your sexual tendencies and don't see what it has to do with this guy's torrent he offered you but we can all clearly see you are a whining, little, selfish bitch.  This isn't Burger King kiddie and no one here is your Mommy & Daddy.  Your tears only give us a reason to laugh at you like we do at the spoiled rotten kiddies we see in the store throwing a fit because Mommy didn't get you the candy you want. Grow up or at least keep your fuckin' mouth shut when the adults are talking son.

And to the OP - thank you sir. The grown folks appreciate you putting this together and offering it here for us. It IS very much appreciated friend."
