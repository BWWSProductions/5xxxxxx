This album is a highly controversial contribution to the early Italian prog movement. The music is very intense and challenging, more impetuous and uncompromising than other contemporaries of the genre. Many people might prefer softer oriented Bands like PFM, Banco or Le Orme. For me this keyboard driven insanity appears in proper style and seems to be one of the most consistent efforts from progging Italy. But you have to be in the right mood!
