Phosphorescent Discography 2003 - 2010





***Including Daytrotter Live Sessions***





Phosphorescent, fronted by Matthew Houck, is an indie folk/alternative country band that is often compared to Iron and Wine, Will Oldham, and Neil Young. Phosphorescent currently resides in Brooklyn, New York (formerly of Athens, Georgia) and is signed to independent label Dead Oceans.

Before recording under the name Phosphorescent, Matthew Houck traveled the world playing under the moniker Fillup Shack and released the album Hipolit in 2000. Houck later changed his recording name to Phosphorescent, and then released the full-length LP A Hundred Times or More in 2003. Notably, in the liner notes of A Hundred Times or More, Fillup Shack is credited with the drum recordings. The album was recorded with the help of The Clairvoyants and released through Athens-based independent label Warm Records. The following year, the band released the EP The Weight of Flight. The band received national attention after it released Aw Come Aw Wry in August 2005 and Pride in October 2007. The latter was named the 12th best album of 2007 by Stylus Magazine and received a 8.0 rating from indie tastemakers Pitchfork Media. Phosphorescent released Here's to Taking It Easy in 2010.
