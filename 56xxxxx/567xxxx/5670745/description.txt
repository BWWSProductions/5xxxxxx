- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   Egerton is best known for his work with The Descendents and All, but since
   both bands have announced hiatuses, it hasnâ€™t stopped him musically and he is
   very much involved in the punk community. After relocating to Tulsa, OK from
   Ft. Collins, CO, he established Armstrong Recording studio to not only record
   bands from all genres, but also to work on his own music. â€œIâ€™ve been writing
   tons of music, but haven't had a regular outlet for all the songs I've come
   up with,â€ says Egerton. â€œFinally, my wife suggested that I ask some of my
   friends to do the singing, since it's definitely my weak suit.â€ With that
   suggestion came the early stages of The Seven Degrees of Stephen Egerton.

   After writing all the music, playing all the instruments, and even recording
   all the songs himself, Stephen sent the demos to friends from his over two
   decade-plus long career in music. Egerton contacted a number of musicians to
   collaborate with, and soon Stephen had vocal contributions from Dan Andriano
   (Alkaline Trio), Joey Cape (Lagwagon/Me First And The Gimme Gimmes), Mike
   Herrera (MXPX), Chris Demakes (Less Than Jake), Chad Price (All/Drag The
   River), Scott Reynolds (All/Steaming Beast) and more.

   Egerton left most of the lyrical duties to the talented punk vocalists, and
   only co-wrote a handful of the sixteen tracks. Egerton mixed and mastered the
   album on his own, which allowed for the consistent sound despite being
   recorded in over a dozen studios by different technicians across the country.
   â€œI have some seriously talented friends. I'm so proud of this record, and I
   can't wait for people to hear it!â€ he exclaims with a sigh of relief.
