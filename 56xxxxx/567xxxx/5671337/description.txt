About:

Sent By Ravens delivers exceptionally catchy melodic rock n' roll with moments of heaviness and an overall message of hope. Their debut album, Our Graceful Words, abounds with deliciously memorable songs bringing to mind the brightest moments of bands like Emery, whose own Matt Carter helped craft the South Carolina group's debut album with producer Aaron Sprinkle.
