STAGE PROFILE:

The race gets down to the nitty-gritty a bit more with this stage of rolling valleys and a nod to the â€œArdennes Classicsâ€ as it follows a part of the routes for the FlÃ¨che Wallonne and LiÃ¨ge-Bastogne-LiÃ¨geâ€¦ There are no very hard slopes, but it may be sufficient to eliminate the major sprinters, like Cavendish, whereas Freire could have more joy. In my opinion, at the finishing line there will be a pack of around fifty riders. But itâ€™s a rugged route on which all sorts of things could happen. In 1995, it was on a stage similar to this one that Miguel Indurain attacked on the â€˜bumpsâ€™ of LiÃ¨ge-Bastogne-LiÃ¨ge and broke away with Johan Bruyneel.
