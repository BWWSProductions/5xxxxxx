,shreddir,2010-07-07T00:14Z,Does somebody out there know where the Eurosport HD coverage is being uploaded.  They show more of the race --less commercial interruptions than Versus.
,Strera,2010-07-07T10:23Z,"@shreddir. Check out: http://cyclingtorrents.nl/
They have open registration."
,windgat,2010-07-07T13:22Z,Thanks for this! I don't always get to watch the stage by day and the highlights are not enough. I much prefer your HD full stage uploads ;)
,greasygas,2010-07-07T19:23Z,"thanks a million mr BUMPYCITYFUNK you rock!
and holey sh... a canadian in 4th place ? must be a mistake"
,Maggen66,2010-07-08T01:09Z,"Gah, please put the race in one file? I guess I have to find some editing tools to add them together. "
,ssdriver1996,2010-07-08T05:44Z,"Is this really Versus HD? Looks like they are either using old SD cameras and upconverting to HD. Looks better than when I used to have SD Satellite but that is long gone now. Maybe Bump has the compression cranked down. Notice most people with H264 files do about 40 minutes per gig.

Bump don't get me wrong, love that you are doing this for us out here, love that it is better than the old SD stuff, would be ecstatic if it was just one notch better so it'd shine on my 46"" hdtv. Can you try a higher quality compression setting? 

Keep up the good work. "
