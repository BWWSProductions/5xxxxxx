This movie has been as secret love of mine ever since I saw it on Sci-Fi oh so long ago. It is next to impossible to find this movie ANYWHERE as it was never released as far as I can tell (try searching for it online). So it is with great pleasure that I give to you this TVrip of Primal Force (IT IS NOT GREAT QUALITY. IN FACT SOME SECTIONS IT IS NOT EVEN GOOD QUALITY. BUT IT IS WATCHABLE. I have streamed it through a 360 to a 42" 1080p TV and it is easily very watchable.)
