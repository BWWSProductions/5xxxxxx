There are three determinable settings.

Cold: For those who want their Powerbook, or iBook to be as cold as possible. Sets fans to turn on when the computer reaches 25 Degrees C. The fans will nearly always be turned on.

Cool: For those who feel the 60 default is too hot, but don't want to stress their fans completely out. Sets fans to turn on at 45 degrees.

Default: For those who find the fans are draining their battery, while unplugged, or who get tired of the fans running and making noise. Resets the fans.
