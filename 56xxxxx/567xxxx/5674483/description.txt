Steppenwolf: All Time Greatest Hits [Original recording remastered]
Release Date: November 23, 1999

Steppenwolf have become synonymous with their huge Harley ridin'-hit, "Born to be Wild", though in reality, their success was far broader, with sales totaling over 25 million units worldwide. Their history is littered with a succession of band members, substance abuse issues and several break-ups and reformations, but Steppenwolf endures to the present day.
