Jim O'Rourke - All Kinds of People: Love Burt Bacharach


When experimental musician and producer Jim Oâ€™Rourke named his recent tribute album All Kinds of People ~ Love Burt Bacharach he wasnâ€™t being funny. The pop composer has received accolades from notables in all genres during more than five decades of writing hit songs. Legends from classic rock like the Beach Boysâ€™ Brian Wilson and Steely Danâ€™s Donald Fagan have spoken of Bacharachâ€™s seminal influence, as have jazz masters like Stan Getz and Wes Montgomery. More contemporary rockers like Elvis Costello and Oasisâ€™ Noel Gallagher have praised Bacharachâ€™s genius as have hip-hop maven Dr. Dre and soul master Ronald Isley. The list of those who love the pop maestro could go on endlessly.
