,otsenre,2011-06-02T18:38Z,"Hello Wendys99 -

I need a HUGE favor. There is this program called PC Pandora to monitor activity that I've been dying to get my hands on again. I purchased it but when I got a new PC, the damned license turned out to be non-xferrable. Can you help?  http://www.pcpandora.com/
Your assistance will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!"
