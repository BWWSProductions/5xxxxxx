Decent movie, too. In my opinion there was too much story to cram into one film, they should have made this an epic trilogy or even just made a sequel. Still a good film though.

(trying second post to see if they fixed the comments)"

,cristianer,2010-08-20T09:38Z,"resolution : 1920x800 ??????????????

The title says 1080 !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why????"
,jhansonTPB,2010-08-20T15:58Z,"1920x800 because that's the aspect ratio of the movie. It's the same as 1920x1080, just the 280 pixels of nothing are cut off."

""Im not gettin audio when playin with my WD media device. Quality is great though... can i cnvert into different format and gain audio without loosing video quality?""

Your WD Media Player is not one of the newer ones - it passes the DTS audio through the Digital Optical Cable to your DTS capable stereo.  If you don't have a DTS capable stereo - it would be cheaper to just by the newer WD Media Player (be sure to check the specifications on the box to see if it is DTS ready).

Considering you sent that post a few years ago you probably found one solution or another to playing this movie. LOL :)
