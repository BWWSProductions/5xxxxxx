This is the ebook/pdf for Simon Clark's "The Night of the Triffids".
I spent quite a bit of time searching for this and thought I would share it with others.

The Night of the Triffids is, unsurprisingly, a sequel to the John Wyndham classic sci-fi / horror thriller The Day of the Triffids. The eponymous plants are a genetic mutation/creation who, after a freak occurrence renders most of the worldâ€™s populace blind, seem intent on taking over the world. That book ends with a small colony of humans setting up shop on the Isle of Wight, working towards a a plan to rid the world of triffids and take control of the earth once more.

Thirty years or so have passed when we start this book. The narrator is David Mason, son of William Mason, who is a local hero (and who was the narrator of The Day of the Triffids). David has not followed in the footsteps of his father, instead becoming a pilot. As with its predecessor, this book opens with the discovery that something has gone badly wrong, an inability to seeâ€¦ but for very different reasons than last time. Much worse, though, the triffids, plants that lurch around on wooden boles, look somewhat like sunflowers but have a poisonous sting which they can lash out from about ten feet away, and that seem to have a form of collective intelligence, are in a much better position to take advantage of the situation than they were before.

I hope everyone enjoys it.
