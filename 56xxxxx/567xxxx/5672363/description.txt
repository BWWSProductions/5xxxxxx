KiNGDOM NOTES
First off this is not near one of the best CAMs, but watchable. The source used was stro and it had tons of issues like interlace (still there), poor resolution, pixalation, some camera movement and so on and so on :lol: It still has its issues. I may give it another shot, but maybe not. The audio on the other hand isnt to bad. I did what I could with it or actually felt like doing to it, as Im hoping like the rest of yall we get a new video source. Just putting out there cause its available. :P
