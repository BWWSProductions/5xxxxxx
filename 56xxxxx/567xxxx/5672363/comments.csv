,call_me_nobody,2010-07-07T06:34Z,the movie is the best but the camera position was fucked up in the middle of the movie-.- damn u for that-..- but anyway thanks for the almost good movie
,yrkmn,2010-07-07T06:45Z,"The effects were great but the script is so bad, sokka suppose to be comedic in nature but he wasnt in the movie, and im not being racist and all but why most minor cast are indian-american.

V: 5/10
A: 6/10"
,Felesar,2010-07-07T07:00Z,"The pitch of the camera is off just a little, and it's noticeable at a few points in the film. But it is totally watchable. If you are looking to keep or burn, wait for something better. 
Just want to watch the film, or in my case want the kids to watch the film and leave you alone for a few hours of peace and quiet... then this is the one you want.
Cheers Raymondhome, another quality re-pack."

,jdogg412,2010-07-07T20:17Z,i agree wit yrkmn movie effects=great script= lacking and y was m night in the movie 
,Tex_NL,2010-07-07T21:26Z,"@ Jackler3

What did you expect? The whole series (over 24 hours total) in a single 90 min movie?

Indeed this is only Book 1 Water. But you could have known this many weeks ago. Many of the leading characters in book 2 and 3, for example Toph, where not mentioned in the cast.
On the positive side this means we get atleast 2 more movies. Lets just hope they'll learn from this one. Even a single TV episode had more story then the entire movie."

,Hellsing777,2010-07-10T03:06Z,DONT GO SEE THIS MOVIE ON CINEMA ! BOYCOTT IT !! nDo not get me wrong The last airbender are a great manga but this movie are simply RACIST !!! WTF IS ALL THOSE WESTERN MAIN CHARACTER WEN THEY ALL SHOULD BE ASIAN ?!?!?!?!? BOYCOOT if you want real quality movie and not disgusting shit movie like this one and DBZ !!!
,foolieboy,2010-07-10T06:18Z,"movie is pure shit. this movies gimmick is it\'s 3D, and even that is terrible. you\'re basically d/l\'ing this torrent for the story, which is horrible and so unlike the show that it will make you nauseous."
,Monsenloll,2010-07-11T16:22Z,"Shit movie, that airbender dude looked like a fag and the Zuko dude was even worse. Anyways, thanks for upload."
,deserttrash,2010-07-13T04:26Z,"to Hellsing777: this is a \""racist\"" family film because they used white people and not asians? do everyone here a favor and go stick your dick in the blender so you can never reproduce and after that you should eat a shotgun barrel to improve your brain function. you make the entire human race look RETARDED by association. who gives a fuck if they\'re white? ONLY YOU! ya know why? cuz your a racist hypocritical piece of shit. KILL YOURSELF :D"
,geecue,2010-07-13T16:00Z,Thanks for the upload! I was such a big fan of the animated series and after reading some disastrous reviews of the movie I decided to dld it instead of going to the cinema - best decision ever.
,Dark_Shroud,2010-07-14T03:15Z,"@Hellsing777, You are an ignorant ass. Avatar the Last Air Bender TV show is American made. Aang is white, Katara & Soka are Inuit.rnrnThe Fire Nation is hinted at being Japanese. The Earth Kingdom is harder to place because if you look at the Avatar world map it could best be described as \""Eurasia,\"" look it up if you need to.rnrnIn short they are a diverse ethnic group minus black/colored people. Odd that you claim racism yet don\'t notice that or fail to point it out."
,PyroThing,2010-07-14T06:06Z,"You people are morons @ Hellsing and Darkshroud, they are not inuit, they are from the south pole..... There is no native people in the south and the closest you could get is their people from the north, the aleutian eskimos. It is a primarily an asian cartoon, it may have been made in america but it is asian in every way. It has bare traces of american style animation. It is mainly manga and all races in the show are based on asians. For example shaolin kungfu is the basis for the the martial arts, katara and her brother are not white and it is not possible in any world for them to be so..... This has been ruined and americanized as usual, get your facts straight you inbred hicks."
,PyroThing,2010-07-14T06:10Z,"The fact that no black people appear in the show proves that is has less to do with american culture. It is an asian world with no white people, aang if anything is based of another asian demographic, watch the cartoon again maybe you could use your eyes and notice the extreme lack of white people. You people are so stupid its amazing. The only reason they dont use asians is becuase most americans are too stupid to read subtitles and like white people in their films and everyone knows it......."
,sh3bang,2010-07-14T21:12Z,Its funny how you guys think the producers are racists... you do realize this show was made by americans right? faggots.
,co30op,2010-07-15T05:00Z,I love the fact that people here are claiming the movie is racist against Asians when the movie\'s writer/director M. Night Shyamalan is of Indian descent hence he\'s Asian.
,TheMustardTiger,2010-07-16T09:36Z,"Unlike many of the noisy and angry people, who have posted previously, i thought it was a nice attempt on Shyamalan\'s part. Sure its not the anime, and sorry actors cant always match their race according to their anime counterparts, but all in all not a bad movie in any way, good story and amazing effects. Also keep in mind that Shyamanlan is way out of is comfort zone with this semi-childish visual thriller. hate to sound hypocritical but ppl should also try to talk about the quality of the vids, its more important IMO."
,pushbyte,2010-07-17T04:34Z,"@Hellsing777rnwell they had to use caucasians...rnthe chinese are too busy in sweat shops making lead toys and killing babies, the korean were too busy fighting each other for no reason, the vietnamese also were too busy fighting and the japanese are still working on pornographic cartoons"
,pushbyte,2010-07-17T04:38Z,"@PyroThing - the *world* has been americanized, get with the times... where have you been?"
,PapaSantoro,2010-07-24T04:07Z,Hey maybe someone could just shut up about whether or not the movie is racist and just tell me if its a good quality or not.
,loope11,2010-07-29T22:21Z,"@pushbyte well being 10 years killing inocent ppl in afghanistan and irak just for oil seem to be a good reason to fight, right? "
,fucktarded,2010-08-02T01:26Z,Anyone want to comment on the quality of the UL????????????????????????????????
,TheDarkseid007,2010-08-07T05:13Z,"Well I for one could of wished that m. night had taken the time to review some of the anime series, that way he could of said aang correctly. 

It was a so, so movie for the time that m. night took, to study the storyline, but it really hurt when you try to mash all those episodes down into a 2-hr movie for each book...

Furthermore, It would of been fabulous to see the out-of-control avatar state of the actual water avatar instead of the cheezy rendition of a giant tidalwave. I could of swore they had the avatar water giant in the previews...
Could of at least destroyed some ships like in the series...

The movie is a copy of most all the same cam rip that is out there from multiple sources. Not sure who was first, but this one was fair with the quality, and worth it, till they can get a better one made. 

The last airbender torrent with the 1.4GB file size actually has a little better fps so in turn makes the image a little sharper, but the seats are still there.

Could of hoped the chairs not bobbing in and out of the scenes were gonna leave but it didn't.  But have to admit, can't beat it for free.It is the real movie, but will keep looking for a better copy.

Thanks for time to seed raymondhome.

V:6 A:8 - Nice first cam rip file

,dantecerber,2010-08-23T14:14Z,I lol @ you all!! anyone else find it a tad retarded that people are arguing over a FICTIONAL stopr that happens in a FICTIONAL place with FICTIONAL people?? But to be fair i would have liked to have seen asian actors but that doesn't mean i think the producers are racist! I did find it a little strange that Zuko is Indian? Whats with that?

First Paragraph:

Avatar: The Last Airbender (also known as Avatar: The Legend of Aang)[1] is an American animated television series that aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008. The series was created and produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, who served as executive producers along with Aaron Ehasz. Avatar is set in an Asian-influenced world[2] of Chinese martial arts and elemental manipulation. The show drew on elements from traditional Asian culture, blending the styles of anime and US domestic cartoons.[3]


----

Avatar is notable for borrowing extensively from Asian art and mythology to create its universe. The series' character designs are heavily influenced by anime as well as Chinese art and history, Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism,[31] and Yoga.[3] Traditional East Asian calligraphy  styles are used for nearly all the writing in the series. For each instance of calligraphy, an appropriate style is used, ranging from seal script (more archaic) to clerical script.[32]  The show employed a cultural consultant, Edwin Zane, and calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee as consultants for the series' cultural influences.[3][33] The choreographed martial art bending moves were profoundly affected by Asian cinema.[2] In an interview, Bryan revealed that, ""Mike and I were really interested in other epic 'Legends & Lore' properties, like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but we knew that we wanted to take a different approach to that type of genre. Our love for Japanese anime, Hong Kong action and kung fu cinema, yoga, and Eastern philosophies led us to the initial inspiration for Avatar.""[34]
