Plot

The film starts with Simran (Sonam Kapoor), who wakes up to make a romantic movie. She loves luv storys; so much so that even her life has begun to resemble one. With her ideal job and the perfect fiancÃ© named Raj (Sameer Dattani), she lives a blissful, dreamy life. One that is rudely interrupted by Jay. Jay (Imran Khan) is an assistant to a director who is famous for his love story films; however, Jay hates love stories. He believes love is nothing but a "sickness" which must be cured.
Simran meets Jay at a movie theatre. He is rude and keeps interrupting until she yells at him and leaves. She meets him again the next day when she gets employed as an art director for some mushy film where Jay is the assistant director. It starts like a typical love story with her hating him. But soon he gains her friendship by being a nice friend. She begins falling in love with him and starts having problems with Raj.
She is rudely awakened from her dream of spending her life with Jay when she sees him kissing some other girls' hand. He explains to her that he was just being her friend and loving her was never his intention since he doesn't believe in love. Simran's heart is broken again. She agrees to marry Raj and the rest of the story is how Jay and his friend try to make her change her mind.
