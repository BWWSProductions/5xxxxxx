Big Red Racing is a racing game released for MS-DOS in 1996. It was developed by Big Red Software and published by Domark.

Game overview
A comical racing game. Every time a menu item is clicked, a funny phrase would play. During the races, the commentators would make funny comments, stereotypically themed to the country they are from.

Customising
For the driver, you could choose from a few different body shapes and change the colour of the clothes. For the vehicle, you could change the colour and decal.
There were several different drivers for the player to choose from before the race. Two of these were Jake 'bad' Jackson, and Derek 'Rabbid Dog' Skimkins.
