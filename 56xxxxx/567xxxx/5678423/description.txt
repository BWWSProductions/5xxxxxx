The kids of Degrassi street have all graduated and are spending their last summer together before heading off in separate directions. There are a lot of stories going on in parallel here. Joey, Kaitlin, and Tessa get involved in a love triangle. Snake makes a fool of himself; this time while acting as a life guard. Wheels shows signs of a drinking problem. Everything comes to a head at an end of summer party at Bronco's cottage.
