Detective Frank Bullit's new assignment seems routine: protecting a star witness for an important trial. But before the night is out, the witness lies dying and the cool, no-nonsense Bullitt (Steve McQueen) won't rest until the shooters - and the kingpin pulling their string - are nailed.
From opening shot to closing shootout, Bullitt crackles with authenticity: on-location San Francisco filming, crisp dialogie and to-the-letter police, hospital and morgue procedures. An Oscar winner for Best Film Editing (1968) this razor-edged thriller features one of cinema history's memorable car chases. Buckle up...and brace for unbeatable action.
