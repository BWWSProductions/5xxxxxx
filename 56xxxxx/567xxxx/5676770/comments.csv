,deeperocean,2010-08-11T17:58Z,"Hello verovenlo. i just found this, but it seems like most of it isn't being seeded. Is there any way that you could seed it? Episode 5, 11, 20, 28 and this one. i really wanted to see the year of Shayne Ward, since he is my singer of these series. 
Thank you for all the hard work!"
