Asshole."

Could've put it in a folder so we could choose which ones we want, too.."
,LigGeorge,2011-03-27T20:56Z,Those are not trojan.Those are .esp or omod files.The esp files are stand alone oblivion mods or mod activators which tell the game that a mod excists.Omod files are compatible with oblivion mod manager.The last one is a famous auto instaler for mods.Also I made rar the file so it can be just under 4gb so it be stored on a usb flash drive.
