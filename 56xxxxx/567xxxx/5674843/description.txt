This is a huge mod pack with installation instructions. Follow the instruction carefully. The pack cortains over 100 mods working all together making the game better and without changing the original TES IV expirience. Also it makes the game look like a 2008 game. You need a very strong pc if you want to play with all settings maxed.
The pack dosn't include Oblivion or Shivering Isles but you need them both.
It also includes some bonus mods that are very compatible with every other mod but also are untested.

Requirements:
>Dual core cpu like intel core 2 duo 4500
>Nvidia 8800GT/ATI 3850 or higher
>2GB ram
>14GB hdd free space
