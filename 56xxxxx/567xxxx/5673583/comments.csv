,profhardcore,2010-07-19T20:56Z,I ran setup and it installed and seems to work fine. However my problem is when every time I start up it prompts me to install it again. I tired to install it again hoping that it would stop asking me but now it won't install. I get the message -Setup could not find a file on the specified path. Unable to locate file c:/users/nathan~1/appdata/local/temp/7zsp52.tmp/powerdvd.msi.  It then gives me another message. Error1706. No valid source could be found for product powerdvd. Please help. how do I uninstall or get rid of the start up installation problem. Thanks. on Windows 7
[T],ADHDerby,2010-07-19T23:51Z,"You can try this: uninstall, reboot and then re-install PowerDVD."
,profhardcore,2010-07-20T01:58Z,I did try and uninstall but I get the exact same message. very confused...

[T],ADHDerby,2010-09-05T00:47Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ profhardcore: Download and merge this reg file: http://www.*egaupload.co*/?d=9B2OGPXD then reboot and reinstall PowerDVD. If you get the same error then disable your virus scanner during the installation process. (replace the * in the link with m)

@ Coxy_UK: It's possible that your virus scanner blocks the keyboard shortcuts (false positive). Temporarily disable your virus scanner and test if the keyboard shortcuts work. If they work then add PowerDVD to the exclusion list.

@ Sebastian2008: Try updating your NVIDIA driver."

[T],ADHDerby,2010-09-14T19:19Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ Ganddi: PowerDVD uses external codecs (DivX, Xvid, MatroskaSplitter) to play movies. If you are using Windows 7 or Vista, try Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP).

@ b10lee: Its a known error,.. a lot of people are having the same problem: http://forum.cyberlink.com/forum/posts/list/10722.page"

which version of PowerDVD you had before?"
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-01-04T15:18Z,"@b10lee

Hi there, sorry about the late reply. I think the last PowerDVD I installed successfully was 7. I'm going downloading it again will try to follow your instructions. Thanks for the reply!"
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-01-04T15:21Z,"@b10lee

Hi there, sorry about the late reply. I'm attempting to download it again and will apply your instructions. I think the previous version I installed successfully was quite an old one, when I was still using Windows XP, think it was PowerDVD 7.

Thanks for the reply!"
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-01-04T16:04Z,"New problem.

I have since installed (successfully) Cyberlink Power2Go 7 and on attempting to install Cyberlink PowerDVD 10 it insists that I uninstall Power2Go first, which I'm not willing to do.

Does anyone know how to circumvent this problem without having to uninstall/reinstall programs?"
