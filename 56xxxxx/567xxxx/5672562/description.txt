STAGE PROFILE:

The finish of the first stage of this Tour is in Brussels. Why Brussels? To celebrate the 65th birthday of Eddy Merckx and everything he has given to cycling. We will be crossing the Flanders region and will enter Belgium via Antwerp. The finish of this completely flat stage will take place in front of the Roi Baudouin stadium. It is difficult to envisage anything else than a sprint finish. However, it should be noted that there could be side winds, which could cause breaks in the pack, leading to gaps. The riders will have to be watchful.
