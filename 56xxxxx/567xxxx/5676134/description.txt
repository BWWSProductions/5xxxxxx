In Ghost Colours is the second studio album by Australian band Cut Copy. It comprises 15 tracks in total, including a re-recorded version of the single "Hearts on Fire". The album was originally planned as an Australian release for 2007, but was delayed until 2008 to accommodate a simultaneous international debut of the recording.
The album was produced in New York by Tim Goldsworthy, although the band's US label Interscope initially suggested they work with Timbaland.
