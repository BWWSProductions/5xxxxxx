About the Animated Movie -
------------------------
Produced using talents from India, Singapore and the Philippines, 'The Legend' of 90 minutes duration, and reportedly the first 2D animation feature film produced from India, simplifies the life and teachings of Buddha, the prince who left behind his kingdom and a beautiful life to go in search of truth. The film has catchy music and simplified philosophy of Buddha's middle or eight-fold path, which makes for engaging viewing for children and adults.
