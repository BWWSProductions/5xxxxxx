All i am doin is sharing..... u may take it any way... "
,tapper101,2010-07-05T23:15Z,"What is ""WP"" supposed to mean? You should always have either CAM, TS, DVDrip, DVDR, DVDSCR, R5, R6 or whatever in the title, so we know exactly what we're downloading."
,affranca,2010-07-06T00:02Z,"WP means ""workprint"" (if you didn't notice it in the .nfo file).

WP copies may have unfinished scenes and things like that."
,libertaswv,2010-07-06T06:36Z,"@ Softwarez

You're a cunt. Following the guy around, posting the same SILLY ASS shit? What are you, 13?

This is how it works. This is our distribution model. Share. Spread. Impossible to stop. 

Your brand of bullshit, look-at-me, credit for credit's sake single-source detritus is juvenile, counter-productive, and untenable. 

For more, see my other reply to you in this uploader's last comment section. 

Asshole.

,jinzouningen,2010-07-12T15:54Z,"Hey anyone. other than your little spats, the audio on the nCode version is very unleveled hows it fairing on this copy? and if so anyone have software opinions on a program to level audio itself other than VLC? or a third party codec for vlc."
,jinzouningen,2010-07-12T16:24Z,"since no one else has gotten thus far as to make a comment ive already got this and yes ncode and king both have the unleveled audio, but other hand this also has \""PROPERTY OF #OWNER#\"" across the bottom of the video hard subbed, ncode does not so ncodes is better :)rnrnfor people wanting to know something actually useful on this videornrnv 9/10 (hard subbed copyright on lower)rna 7/10 (unleveled channels)"

,fade9150,2010-08-10T00:41Z,Instead of arguing just rate the torrent or give it a +1 or a -1.  That says way more than your words will do. 
,iBullet,2010-08-10T09:24Z,"Thanks.. this is really amazing

A:9 V:9 M: havent watched yet =D

Thanks for the amazing quality!!!!

,Wireshark,2010-08-10T10:31Z,"Only music audio?

Is it only me or cant you guys hear when the people is talking in the movie?

The video is great 8.5/10"

,Ash1xx,2010-08-11T15:16Z,i get picture but no sound can anybody help me please ?

Thanks for the upload"
,smacwhir,2010-08-18T04:38Z,It would be great if I could hear them talk.... But I only get music.
,sanewicked,2010-08-18T08:40Z,"MOVIE SUCKED ASS!

Great Torrent though. 
The watermark put a tiny damper on an otherwise great 'rip'."
,lilglower,2010-08-18T09:51Z,thanks a lot! good quality!!!!!
,vampire_piss,2010-08-19T00:02Z,so is it good or what?
,vampire_piss,2010-08-19T00:04Z,the quality that is*
,bigggdan,2010-08-19T05:09Z,"audio is a bit screwy, dialogue is on left and music is on right with default settings on your comp.

If u use CCCP (combined community codec pack) you can go into ffdshow audio decoder configuration, go into mixer tab, and set Output speakers config to mono, seems to center the audio so dialogue and music comes from both.  Just remember to set it back to your preference later."
[T],gorran2009,2010-08-20T02:22Z,thanks man :D
,Distort_Inc,2010-08-20T08:28Z,Great video quality! The watermarks are off to the sides so they don't take away from the watching experience.
,Distort_Inc,2010-08-20T08:33Z,BTW If you aren't getting any sound you might need to upgrade your video codec package. I was having the same problem until I did.
,amavity,2010-08-21T14:08Z,Audio and Video good.  Movie stupid
,Nighky,2010-08-21T22:57Z,I think it's time for a sandwich.
,goodthenks,2010-08-22T14:55Z,There is sound for music but no sound for the dialogue. How can I get sound for dialogue? I'm using Miro at the moment.
,geo64,2010-08-23T19:59Z,good quality but the movie sucks
,iRandomGuy,2010-08-24T18:53Z,Aside from the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.. a 10 v 10.. Thanks for the up..
,ichikiller22,2010-08-24T20:41Z,Good quality. Extremely terrible movie.
,CecilMann,2010-08-27T05:06Z,when there is no sound its because you do not have ac3 filter most likely. google the download
,arildus,2010-08-27T23:11Z,Thanx;)
,nautica002,2010-08-28T08:57Z,"i paid to see this in the theatre and walked out half way thru, thats how much it sucked!   watch piaranhna 3D instead, not for kids.. 8P"

,MykZkyM,2010-08-31T04:57Z,"Crappy movie.  But I guess no one expects it to be great.  But still good for a few laughs which is what most of us are after anyways.

A - 7 Pretty decent but music is on one side and sounds are on the other.  Kinda irritating.  But understandable and that's what counts.

V - 9 Surprisingly good quality.  Would have been 10 but the water marks are irritating."
,loecriple143,2010-09-01T05:23Z,"How do i seed, just download"
,HystericalHusky,2010-09-15T00:10Z,Trash Movie Only A 10 Year Old Would Find It Funny Very Ignorant.  But Good Rip watermark throughout but awesome quality movie 2/10 v:9 A:10
,justmikey,2010-09-15T04:14Z,"a - 10
v - 6 reason for this is and i kno its a wp but my sound kept going up and down otherwise decent up x :)    

movie itself some of the worst acting ive ever seen some parts funny just due to the dodgy acting"
,alfredito,2010-09-17T10:12Z,is it a good movie or not?
,peewee-hermen,2010-09-22T20:00Z,"A=8/V=9/M=10

I gave the video 9 because of the two blurs that I would see throughout the entire movie, I also gave the audio and 8 because of the problem with the two sound layouts, the music will come out of one speaker in the people's voices will come out the other. My favorite part was the ending, oh FYI when you play the movie on a PS3 the audio for the background music mite be the only thing you hear,without the voices, but if you play it on Xbox 360 you will hear both the audio or background music and the voices "
,simonn-n,2010-09-24T17:30Z,Thanks!
,adfs8p08,2010-09-25T06:36Z,gaussian blur on both top corners is kinda annoying and also the water mark at the bottom but this is way better than a cam version. This movie is just as stupid as Twilight No one should upload videos if they have a rating of lower than 5 on imdb
,tyrelleze,2010-09-25T20:36Z,Meet the spartans has a 2.1 rating and i thought it was amazingly funny
,plague-of-men,2010-10-07T12:35Z,meet the spartans wasn`t funny it was just gay! deserves a 2.1.
,F4W4D,2010-10-09T10:09Z,"the characters voices are close 2 mute xcept the backround music, which is normal, somethings wrong!"
