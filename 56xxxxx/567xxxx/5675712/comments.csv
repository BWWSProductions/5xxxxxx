Thanks for the up but you guys should go buy it too... the extra bonus disk has some really awesome stuff on it."

I bought a concert ticket a few years ago for their R30 tour and he did too and we went together. Love them and always will. And just played it on the new guitar hero for the first time. Well, sang it lol. They actually have the band, and Gene Simmons narrate the parts of 2112. It was so awesome."
