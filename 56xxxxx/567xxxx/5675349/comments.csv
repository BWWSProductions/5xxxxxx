Do this MD5 check just before mounting or doing anything with the iso image! Otherwise you may have a faulty DVD image. Use quality media/burner and burn slowly.nn4- MAKE SURE YOU TAKE NOTE OF YOUR Hardware IDs, Device IDs and device names before installing this system. This is very important. If you aren\'t sure what devices/hardware you own nor its IDs, then 3 options:n-Boot iATKOS S3 DVD, run \""Hardware Info\"" from Utilities menu and take notes.n-Fire up a Linux Live CD (ie. Ubuntu Live CD), type \""lspci -nn\"" in terminal and take notes.n-Windowsers, get Everest Ultimate Edition and take note of your hardware.nn5- Do a google search or surf to InsanelyMac, Hackint0sh, our forum, related OSX86 sites or wiki to find out if your hardware is supported or not. Do this for every piece of your hardware (vga card, ethernet card, motherboard etc.). OSX86 does not support a wide range of hardwares like Linux and Windows. Make sure that it is supported before you install. This is very important because after installation you may ask like \""how can I get this hardware to work\"" and people would simply slap you with \""it will never work\"". This little search will avoid your frustration and anger! Extending your lifespan!nn6- If something goes wrong, please don\'t panic, Scroll down for the Troubleshooting guide. If that fails, take a screenshot (or a picture) of what went wrong and post it in the forums. Make sure you have done the 3 Revival steps and troubleshooting steps before posting in the forum!nn7- Do not forget one thing: IF THE INSTALL ENDS WITH SUCCESS, THEN MOST LIKELY IT CAN RUN ON YOUR HARDWARE. This means if you have a major booting error after installation like kernel panic, \""still waiting for root device\"" error, hang on grey apple screen etc. then this is mostly related to your faulty selections during install, read the instructions carefully and do a very basic install until you boot your new system with success.nn8- iATKOS wallpapers and icons are made by @denizckosar :)nnnInformation:nn- 64-bit/32-bit thing:nMac OS X Snow Leopard is a hybrid operating system which can boot in both 64-bit and 32-bit modes. This iATKOS S3 release boots in 64-bit by default, if you select the 32-bit package or any of the 32bit-only driver(s) then the system will boot the kernel in 32-bit by default.nTo load a driver/module/kext in 32-bit (i.e. a 32-bit only driver) you must boot the system in 32-bit, vice versa for 64-bit. All of the drivers and patches except the 32-b"

,Corininha,2010-08-09T02:21Z,"@usamapk Yes, I did. Works just great. Installed twice, as I never used osx86 before. Is just amazing. I upgraded (also twice) to 10.6.4. Apart from this upgrade were 6 more. iTunes, java and few more. Sound is perfect, everything is just perfect. Except one little thing that pisses me off. Any help highly appreciated!
My problem is Preview returns a blank (white color) screen. The images look good as thumbnails on my desktop or if I open them with Safari , Firefox or even Adobe Lightroom 3. But the (default) preview simply wont work. Needless to say I can't capture screen. Makes the photomachine click sound, but that's all. Is never saved as an image. And I did all the ""delete pref in home --- Library --- Preferences ---- systemconfiguration"". I did it all, I checked the ""force 32 bit"", I even tried in safeboot, in 32, in 64, every(damn)way. :) I can't get it work. I would like to know if the devs know about this problem, because at this point I see 2 possibilities: 1)Rather I had to check something else in the bootloader (efi, whatsoever) where the patches, drivers and the rest is,
or
2) Is a problem with the distribution. 

As I said never ever knew how a os x looked like (on some system) till yesterday. And I would really need some help, pretty please!"

On first bootup, you must type -x cpus=1 at the boot prompt. Then, go to the /System/Library/Extentions and remove ATIRadeonX2000.kext (because this was causing a kernel panic for me.)

On subsequent bootups, you must always use cpus=1

,Corininha,2010-11-22T16:14Z,"@tushar199 

Mine is Palit too;). I will tell you the configuration that works to me. Everything working. Including my webcam (microsoft LifeCam VX-800). 

You can't say ""everything is working"" because if PREVIEW or SCREENCAPTURE is not working, means YOU DON'T have Quartz Extreme working. Therefore no video either. To know if you have QE enabled and working take a look at the status bar (the one with the apple logo and clock). If is semi-transparent, then it works. Chose a multicolored background to realize this better. 

If that is not semi-transparent, my guess is the screen resolutions are wrong too. Probably you have ONLY one option in System Preferences >>> Hardware >>> Displays. 

WHat worked for me was:


Boot loader:
-AsereBLN
Bootloader options:
-ETHERNET 
Patches:
-Extra Directory
-fakesmc
-DIsabler
-RTC
Modified Kernels:
-qoopz 10.3.0
Drivers:
-AHCI SATA
-INTEL SATA/IDE
Sound (both)
-Voodoo HDA
-Apple HDA (I NOW install without VOODOO HDA because on their site there is a better and newer version that I install right after OS X is up and running)
PS/2:
-VOODOO PS/2
CPU Power Management:-voodoo P-State
VGA:
-nVidia DVI/VGA (to match your input, output. My guess is it's the same)
NO ENABLERS AT ALL!!!!!
Network:
-Realtek>>>Wired>>>RTL8139 (again, match yours).


Install and I hope you are done!

 I found RC5 to work too, but not the way asereBLN works. Works all great here and I will show you how my video card is seen in ""about this mac>>>more info>>>hardware>>>Graphics/Display

Now I have fully working sound in/out and Mic .

SETTINGS I USED:

Boot loader Options - 32bit boot
-Graphics Enabler
USB - usb fix

PATCHES -Extra directory (Uncheck this or it will not install )

UNCHECK THE SOUND ( Important ) It will not work with this checked.

You can load the driver kext for your card later manually with kext helper B7 

UNCHECK VGA

NETWORK - Wired - Marvell - Marvell Yukon 88E8001

ANYTHING ELSE LEAVE AS IT IS.

It will update to 10.6.4 from combo update by going to the apple website and downloading from there.(you will need this before you can update to 10.6.5 ) 
NOTE :The 10.6.5 update knocks out the USB's Here's the Fix.

To update to 10.6.5 : Open Finder- Open your drive- Open System- Open Library- Open Extensions- find IOUSBFamily.kext and copy it to desktop.
Go to the Apple website support page and download and install the 10.6.5 update not the combo one. Do not reboot. Open kext helper b7 ,drag the IOUSB.kext and drop it in the box,hit easy install. reboot you should have no usb problem.

Reboot until the chameleon shows press f 8 choose the first apple and press the down arrow and choose to boot with -v -f

,PROTEOUS1,2011-06-05T11:43Z,"MAYBE THIS WILL HELP. IT'S FROM THE BEGINNING INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS ON THE DISK. 


Requirements for OSX86:

Minimum: Compatible motherboard, Intel SSE2 CPU, 512MB RAM, 15GB free space on target partition, compatible VGA card.

Recommended: Intel Core CPU, 1GB RAM, 15GB free space on target partition, Snow Leo compatible nVidia 6600 or newer / ATI X1300 or newer / Intel GMA 950 or X3100 VGA card.

Motherboard (the most important part) should be compatible for booting iATKOS S3 DVD and installing natively.

2- This DVD includes Apple's Mac OS X Leopard 10.6.3 (10D573) installation, some basic drivers and x86 patches.

3- Make sure that the md5 checksum of your iATKOS iso image matches the one posted on our website. Do this MD5 check just before mounting or doing anything with the iso image! Otherwise you may have a faulty DVD image. Use quality media/burner and burn slowly.

4- MAKE SURE YOU TAKE NOTE OF YOUR Hardware IDs, Device IDs and device names before installing this system. This is very important. If you aren't sure what devices/hardware you own nor its IDs, then 3 options:

-Boot iATKOS S3 DVD, run ""Hardware Info"" from Utilities menu and take notes.
-Fire up a Linux Live CD (ie. Ubuntu Live CD), type ""lspci -nn"" in terminal and take notes.
-Windowsers, get Everest Ultimate Edition and take note of your hardware.

5- Do a google search or surf to InsanelyMac, Hackint0sh, our forum, related OSX86 sites or wiki to find out if your hardware is supported or not. OSX86 does not support a wide range of hardwares like Linux and Windows. Make sure that it is supported before you install. This is very important because after installation you may ask like ""how can I get this hardware to work"" and people would simply slap you with ""it will never work"". This little search will avoid your frustration and anger! Extending your lifespan!

6- If something goes wrong, please don't panic, Scroll down for the Troubleshooting guide. If that fails, take a screenshot (or a picture) of what went wrong and post it in the forums. Make sure you have done the 3 Revival steps and troubleshooting steps before posting in the forum!

7- Do not forget one thing: IF THE INSTALL ENDS WITH SUCCESS, THEN MOST LIKELY IT CAN RUN ON YOUR HARDWARE. This means if you have a major booting error after installation like kernel panic, ""still waiting for root device"" error, hang on grey apple screen etc. then this is mostly related to your faulty selections during install, read the instructions carefully and do a very basic install until you boot your new system with success.


Personal note: You will need to COPY the ""IOUSBFamily.kext"" + ""THE IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext"" TO A FOLDER ON YOUR DESKTOP!

DOWNLOAD A FREE PROGRAM CALLED ""kexthelper b7"" you will need this to reinstall the kexts after the10.6.5 update before rebooting!

You will find them in :SYSTEM>LIBRARY>EXTENSIONS 

This is because when the 10.6.5 update is installed it breaks the usb.

You will need to download and install the 10.6.4 update first and reboot. Then download and install the10.6.5 update and install BUT DO NOT REBOOT!!!
Drag the kexts to kexthelper click easy install and then when it tells you reboot.Usually takes a minute or 2 .wait for the prompt onscreen and continue to force quit and it will reboot with the update installed .
Updating from there is no problem.

,802boob,2012-01-01T08:11Z,"Got this working on a Dell Vostro 200 with no video card settings and no Ethernet.   

Mobo- FoxConn G33M (02) -02 is the OEM Dell branch.  I got most the specs from Manufacturer.  With the install the only changes I made were in the IDE controllers.  Installed Intels.

-
Other configs may make the settings work with video settings but I tried the Intel x3100 which is supposedly the onboard for the G33M and it didn't work.

I am used to the hang ups in the Apple Spinning thingamadoodle, but I waited this time about 3-5 minutes and it booted to Setup options.

----

Update -

New Progress!

Slamed the Foxconn Dell OEM G33M02 into a Dell Dimension 4700 case due to lack of the Vostro space.  The proprietary skinny pci cards did not benefit my 3 party realtek 8139 pci card for normal size form factors.  From here it was a obviouse solution, I customized the Lan install to accomidate and walla!  Interwebs!  

The other big revelation is the 9800 GTX+ I installed by a ball hair in the case to function with an actual full on Welcome intro after a successful install of Mac OS.  After the install It skips the Intro if you have no graphics support I assume right to language selection. I achieved that by simply adding the nvidia install customizations.

iLife 11' functions great

Next update will be trying to update to 10.6.8
