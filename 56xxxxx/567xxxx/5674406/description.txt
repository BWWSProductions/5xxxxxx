The first EP has 5 glorious rock and roll songs in in glorious rock and roll CD format. It is basically from the heart and soul of us over the last 6 monthes. Holed away in the basement with nothing but our mics, guitars and mostly shirtless drummer, we wrote these songs and made sure we did everything we could to make it something we would want to listen to and play over and over again. And hopefully you'll want to listen to them an irresponsible amount of times as well. The EP recorded with John Paul Peters and will be available at all shows for $7.00 (IF YOU WANT TO GO GET A COPY).
