,death0100,2010-07-07T15:35Z,"I think this should have been place under ""Porn""."
,drteeth,2010-07-07T23:21Z,"Hey, if young teen 'model' pictures can appear here..."
,death0100,2010-07-08T04:27Z,"They are completely different. ""Young teen models"", if you're talking underage, are not porn at all. Jiggly Girls is drawn art, but it is porn nonetheless.

I'm not saying I don't like it, btw - on the contrary, I love Reiq's work. I'm just saying it's in the wrong section of the Bay."
