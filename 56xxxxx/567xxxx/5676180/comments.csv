,DragonRider65,2010-09-16T19:00Z,"That kind of trips me out; there are no serials or instructions in this, but people are writing ""Works perfectly, thank you!"" Wow, that's wierd. I've downloaded this from another source before and couldn't use it; I will try this one and if it does work then I will keep seeding."
,DragonRider65,2010-09-16T19:25Z,"Okay, as promised, if it works I write back----yup, it worked! That's awesome too, I sure will seed this! I spent a whole night trying to find Trapcode Cracks for CS5 the other night! Sure hope DarkMan likes some of the torrents on my profile or some way I can repay ya for this bro? Thanks, David"

,RavenJPA,2010-11-08T01:46Z,"I'd installed al the plugins and soundKeys, EchoSpace, Form, Horizon, Lux and Particular work fine, but Shine, 3D stroke, Starglow, MagicBullet and ToonItn, looks like correctly installed, but don't appear in the effects menu in the AE, somebody have the same problem? Am i missing something?"

,LOLiverPB,2011-04-20T23:10Z,"as of today 4/20/2011 this is working. Just installed soundkeys after hours of searching and this one worked. This is for CS5 tho. If the other ones works I then I wont post anything else here, if they dont I will get back and post as of what didnt work and what did work. 

Thx anyway whoever uploaded me, you did me a big favor "
,diegoodor,2011-05-30T22:25Z,"yes,  everything works great on AE cs5 nice and clean upload.
but this plugins are not compatible for cs5.5
it says connot find the installation path.
still searching the plugins for this new version of adobe.
thanks."
,Akito8,2011-06-09T03:46Z,"I got Trapcode Particular up and it's working like a charm but I'm having problems installing Form.

Every time I go to start the installation I get an this error:   Error 2343.Specified path is empty

Anyone know how to fix this? The main reason I downloaded was for Trapcode Form but cheers to Darkman for getting the others working. "
,moni5550,2011-07-16T05:16Z,"when i install particular and go to use it in my adobe after effects, it says i am missing 'particular' for the favourite or something, and i have installed it like 2 times, i even tried wonloading it from other palces but there is always a problem, any idea why its not working?"
,pawnone,2011-08-09T06:15Z,"Installed and working on CS4 premier and after effects...

Thanks vary much"
,Kindergaten,2011-08-19T20:03Z,"This works. im on win 7 64bit. using ae cs5.

If your trying to install particular v2.1, and get an error when opening the installation file then right click, properties, compatability and then select on windows vista. Serials are provided."
,poopymonkey,2011-08-28T22:39Z,"Is anyone else have problems with CS5.5 and this plugin set?

No sure if it is just diegoodor with possibly an altered installation path/folder issue.  Any feedback from other CS5.5 users will be appreciated.

I'm awaiting my 64bit pc so can't try for myself just yet.  If CS5.5 is problematic with this then I'll look for a CS5 torrent instead.

As always massive thanks for this torrent."
,mco,2011-09-22T07:24Z,These plugins are NOT working with CS5.5
,SAMLT3M,2011-09-28T04:44Z,all the files i got were rar files dick
,gromath,2011-10-07T02:30Z,"ok guys I have a solution for those having trouble with cs5.5 

Plugins not appearing after installed...so far for me particular and shine all worked just fine *but* it got installed in a different partition (E: instead of C..program files etc) all I did was move the files to the right folder (plugins in afx folder)  So If you have problems with the plugins not showing just do a search for them and after you findthem elsewhere, copy them to your plugins folder.

Form issue: I also got the ""path is empty"" crap...to fix this you have to download form 2.0 or 2.0.1 from trapcode's page (apparently they messed up their install files and they are glitchy on cs 5.5) after you download it don't try the old serials as they are for FORM 1.1  try instead this one: 85128940200057334577

I'll see if the other ones work cheers and thanx DARKMAN for this fine release"
,drcracker,2011-10-25T12:15Z,"for all those having a problem installing for cs5.5 (i've only tried particular), all you need to do is select custom install instead of complete install from the installer. Then select the afx cs5.5 plugins/effects directory and hit install."
,JakdMan,2011-12-08T20:37Z,Horizon and Form serials wont work for me :(
,lllnutslll,2012-01-04T10:40Z,"Thanks so much for this!!

So far have installed Shine and Particular and both work perfectly! Serials works perfectly too!!

Thanks again :)"
,mulihaa,2012-01-08T19:32Z,Itsays install but how do i install it ??
,codlink,2012-01-13T18:19Z,"Thanks gromath.  Serial works!

,genjutsu01,2012-02-07T06:06Z,"Went to install Shine, there is no keygen contained within the folder whatsoever, checked every single file, no text files, no keygens, and that was only the first plug in I tried and already its a fail."
