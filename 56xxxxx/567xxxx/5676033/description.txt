A series about a small town in the middle of Northamptonshire preparing for a talent night.

Each week listeners catch up with Rod the local supermarket manager, who shares rather more than is usual about his private life over the store's tannoy system. There's recently divorced Jan, who has been trying rather unsuccessfully to "find herself" with a trip abroad to an elephant sanctuary. But it is at home in Wadenbrook that she starts to feel happier as her friendship blossoms with ex-teacher Mary, where perhaps Jan will get to experience romance at last.

There's also driving instructor and forthright self-defence teacher Esther and her gentle and put-upon husband Jonathan who are struggling to start a family; and possibly the only happy couple in town, Ken and Keith, who are trying to teach their pet whippets to dance for the town talent night.
