     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      The many star-forming areas of our galaxy are obscured by
      interstellar dust, but Herschel, a new space telescope, can see
      these areas in infrared light. Sir Patrick Moore is joined by
      Professor Derek Ward-Thompson and Dr Chris North to examine the
      latest stunning images from Herschel. Pete Lawrence shows what
      is on offer in the June sky and Paul Abel searches for a comet -
      but will he find it?
