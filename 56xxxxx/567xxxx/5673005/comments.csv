,dlarrym1111,2010-09-21T07:20Z,"I agree with you @Xx1Talon1xX). I too thought it was an awesome show. In my humble opinion, it was a BAD BAD decision to cancel this series. MANY MANY of my friends that were LOST fans were tuning in with the same excitement that they felt when LOST was a NEW series.

I wish there was an appeal process so HAPPY TOWN fans could email in signed affidavits stating there displeasure of the series being canceled.

Oh well. . . I figure its over. "
