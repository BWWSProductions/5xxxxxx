,thx01138,2010-07-06T16:16Z,"@Athlonite: It's because the aspect ratio of the movie itself is 2.35:1 and not 16:9.  If the resolution of the file was 1280x720, there would be 88 lines of black at the top and 88 lines at the bottom.  That's 225k pixels of black per frame that can be avoided by making the resolution 1280x544 instead of 1280x720."

2.1 GB isn't bad at all for the quality.

Seeding as always."
