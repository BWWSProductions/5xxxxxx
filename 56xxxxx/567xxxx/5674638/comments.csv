Also, any chance of acquiring the first 2 Zebras if you have them?

You can download the FLAC/EAC pack here.

It's time to say goodbye to MP3.   :)

Thanks."

what do you mean by ""acquiring""?
I don't want to be an asshole, but personally I don't like FLAC...(also I didn't really understood the meaning of the torrent you quoted)
And the Zebra album is here on TPB easily to download, here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4963979/Zebra_-_Zebra_(FLAC)"
