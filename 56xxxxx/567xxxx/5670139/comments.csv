,jiveclive,2010-07-06T03:17Z,"Geehova Wickeness goes door to door
Knock on mine to tell me more
About crap that does not exist
And that's why I take the piss
That's how it is with me
And Geehova Wickedness

I don't deny they done some good
But get a load of this
Heaps of people done lots of good
And they didn't have to be in Gehova Wickedness
Oh, Geehova, I luv you so
Stop dem wickedness knocking on my do'. "

,Skyper2,2010-12-26T01:40Z,"I am familiar with the Witnesses and I am very respectful of their faith.  
I'm 34 and I've finally come to the realization that people like ""Jiveclive"" who claim (usually more intelligently) that mankind doesn't need a belief system to tell them what to do are just believing a pipe dream. Nazism, witch burning, lynching, genocide, terrorism, etc.  People do what they are incited to do good or bad and this painful pattern just keeps repeating itself over and over and over again ruining life for anyone with a conscience. I'm sure someone will argue that these things were fueled by overzealous beliefs like Atheism/Eugenics (Nazism), religious paranoia, racism and hatred but that doesn't even begin to explain it. Take a look at the Milgram experiments. That was nothing but a little coaxing from a scientist and there have been many other experiments done with the same results. Intelligence agencies around the world have been studying ways to manipulate the masses for years.  
People need a higher morality instilled in them and a reason to follow it even in the darkest of times. Witnesses don't look to force their views on others, they are pacifists to the death, and stay out of politics and government.
Their only fault in the eyes of the world is that they don't abandoned or reassess their beliefs to appease contemporary society. Again something that I respect."

,dudew8,2011-09-17T06:51Z,"I'm not a witness, but i know these people, they are not a cult, doing as best as they can, and try to follow the bible. i studied with them for a year and i was starting to feel true happiness in my life, but pressure from others and satan/devils made me stop, i still believe in jehova tho, and its just because its the most logical religion, if u have a question they can answer it, other religions make their own rules and follow things from the bible that they like(thats how i see it, no offence ment)."
