         The Gruen Transfer (TGT) is a show about advertising,         
         how it works, and how it works on us. Hosted by the           
         inimitable Wil Anderson, TGT decodes and defuses the          
         commercial messages that swirl through our lives, with        
          the help of a panel of ad industry experts.
