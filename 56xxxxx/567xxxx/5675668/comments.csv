[T],Tanauser,2010-07-07T15:42Z,"After checking:

Those following PIPS  ((data\ui\campaign ui\pips)) are missing from The Razors initial release

effect_persuasion.tga
political_unrest-unhappy.tga
effect_anti_france.tga
effect_pro_france.tga
pip_anti_france.tga
pip_pro_france.tga
character-happy.tga
character-unhappy.tga

So these where added after Patch4 according to the Peninsula Campaign

I don't see any other missing Icons

the new_uied.templates ((\ui\templates))

& the cursors      seems to be the same

That's a TEAM !"
