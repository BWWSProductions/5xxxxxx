,xeroknight,2010-07-10T07:35Z,is this technically dvd 8 from the psybient files zalchi uploaded? or is this even the same user???
,xeroknight,2010-07-10T07:42Z,wait. never mind. i guess u never had a part 4. ur organizing is confusing but i think i got it. i love your torrents. i have like 4 of your dvds on dvd. ive discovered SOOO much new good music. Wow. Keep it up I need more!
,zalchi,2010-08-16T05:01Z,"hello xeroknight. you are right, i forgot putting the word 'psybient' in the begining of this torrent's name, and i did it anonymously, so i can't correct it. and i can't upload an already uploaded torrent again. 

so this is the 4th dvd of the first Pack. the 4th dvd of the second Pack is comming before the end of summer.

so we got 8 dvds, and I made a compact 32GB pack with all of that music for SD-cards or a layer of a Blu-ray XL disc : )

I mean 

without videos
double copys
without bad noises (i think ""almost"")
refreshed infos
some tracks, albums have better quality 

and thank you for your feedback, and i'm available on Discog.com (zalan) too.
