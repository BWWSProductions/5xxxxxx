What do you think the comments section is for, or do you think only comments praising the torrent are allowed, its to inform people of the torrent, thats why sites like this work better compared to Limewire, where you can not see comments"
,paulderby,2010-07-08T00:31Z,Imagines is perfect!!
,theofanis,2010-07-11T19:17Z,the video is indeed out of sync. and the rest that are out either are copies of this or are on a complete different fps rate :Snno subs for it in greek. sigh
