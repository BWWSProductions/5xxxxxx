The biggest predator ever to swim in the oceans and ruler of the seas for 20 million years, Megalodon weighed 50 tonnes, had a seven foot-wide jaw, and boasted a mouthful of seven inch, razor-sharp teeth. Terrorising waters from Australia to the Americas until it became extinct two million years ago, Megalodon made the great white shark look like a small fry.  Not even the giant whales of the time were safe from this apex predator. Now, nearly 2 million years after Megalodon disappeared from earth, scientists will rebuild this monster shark.
