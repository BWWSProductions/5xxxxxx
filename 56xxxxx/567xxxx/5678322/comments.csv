,DarkWolfDK,2010-08-21T22:29Z,"This Torrent is crap.
Poor quality (VHS like) and unable to select subs.

Seems like jobs done a bit too fast!?"
,DarkWolfDK,2010-08-21T22:42Z,"Not DVDr quality. More like VHS.

Subs are not selectable from after the burn to the disc.

Dont share this as a DVDr when its just a DIVX rip and not DVD. What DVD has 21 Lang subs?"
