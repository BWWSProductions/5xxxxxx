Paranormal Activity is a 2009 American horror film written and directed by Oren Peli.[6] It premiered at the Screamfest Film Festival in the US on October 14, 2007, and was shown at the Slamdance Film Festival on January 18, 2008. The film received a limited release in several US cities on October 9, 2009, and had a nationwide release on October 16, 2009.[7]
The movie centers on a young couple, Katie and Micah, who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home. The movie is presented in the style of "found footage", from the camera set up by the couple to capture what is haunting them.
The film has earned nearly 200 million at the US box office alone, on a reported budget of $15,000. Paranormal Activity is one of the most profitable movies ever made, based on return on investment.[8][9][10] However, such figures are difficult to verify independently[11] and are likely to exclude marketing costs.[12] The film was nominated for "best first feature" in the Independent Spirit Awards 2009.[13]
