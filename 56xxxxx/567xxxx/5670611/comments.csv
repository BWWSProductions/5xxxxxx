,cibi007,2011-02-10T02:08Z,"buy this game guys and play online where it really excells. 40 players X 480 human controlled AI against hundreds of server controlled AI's. You wont get this experience running a pirate copy like i did before. The patch really fix a lot of problem and u wont regret buying this if u like this game cause the mod alone will provide unlimited single player campaign, mission and it will keep coming."
,jthm420,2011-03-10T23:39Z,"works like a charm, mounted dvd 1, ran the autorun, mounted the 2nd dvd mid-install, everything went fine, and when asked after the install if you want to install 'BattleEye' i think it was called(to communicate with their servers- they even tell you this), CLICK NO, and afterwards it asks you if you want to apply crack and click yes, and then it tells you you're done, at which point i re-mounted dvd1 and copied over the crack. i didn't bother installing the patch seeing as everyone seems to be having problems with it, and the game doesn't necissarily need it, and the game ran fine, though it is REALLY hardware intensive depending on your settings.

anyways i fooled around a bit and couldnt get the 360 controller customizer to work so i got pissed off and stopped playing it for now, but the point is it worked fine

PS. THIS ^ is how a comment is supposed to be, especially if you're whining the game(or torrent) isn't working for some reason or another, ESPECIALLY if it's 'laggy' or 'slow' or w/e. (there's only one reason to not post your specs..think about it)
If it's really that much of a hassle, type your specs down in notepad or w/e text program you're using, and save it in your docs or somewhere easy to access, then copy and paste it. There is no excuse for laziness ;]"
,obeyXme,2011-05-15T13:15Z,"I can confirm that this game crashes.
I have a Win 7 x64

Such a shame. It works like a charm and has no viruses in it but the only thing that is possible to launch is the Boot Camp and Armory(which is shit without actually unlocking stuff through Campaign or w.e)
When I launch the Campain, it crashes. When I try to launch an editor game it crashes, too after about 1 min. Done everything correctly with teh crack etc. 
Is there any way to fix this? I will seed this for a while as well."

,BeAware2011,2011-08-22T03:30Z,Hey guys! I've found a solution to fix a problem with Arma 2 OA!                                                               Problem(was): You could play the game only for few minutes and then it crashes to the desktop                           Solution: Download 1.52 Patch for OA then you'll need Crack for 1.52 and then install the game and patch it after the setup and put the crack in the game folder!    Have Fun!                                                This solution worked for me and it works like a charm! 
,BeAware2011,2011-08-22T03:38Z,"Btw you may not have any mods(Addons, what you'we downloaded) on while your updating your OA, otherwise it'll fuck up your arma 2 OA"
,spystyle,2011-09-08T05:47Z,"I GOT IT TO WORK WITHOUT CRASHING :)

OK, here is how I eventually got it to work without crashing. 

1. Install game
2. Install update
3. Install Virtual CD 10
4. Use Virtual CD 10 to mount the contents of ""NS-A2OA_SR-poseden.rar"" following the instructions that come with it.

No crack is needed

It may work with DayZ. A friend of mine said it does if you play this+Dayz with some kind of VPN/proxy server to get around the games anti-pirate blocks. I'll be testing this myself to see if it works and will let you know."
