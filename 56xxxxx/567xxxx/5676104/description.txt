PLOT: Vampires and ghouls stalk modern-day England, hunting the oblivious populace. Only the Hellsing foundation stands between the evil undead and the innocent humans who would be their prey. But there's something new out there - chips that give humans vampiric ability and bloodlust are being sold as the latest designer drug. With a new wave of evil creatures rising, and violent opposition from a rival Catholic organization Hellsing must rely on its most unlikely soldiers - ancient master vampire Alucard and the newly turned Seras Victoria - but can even they stand in the face of such overwhelming odds?

DESCRIPTION: Made using clips from the Gonzo-produced Anime Television Series this fan-edit feature film focuses on the Hellsing Organizations struggles against the freak-chipped Valentine Brothers and Iscariot's Paladin Anderson.
