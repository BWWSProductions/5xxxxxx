,Mescaleros,2010-08-03T12:59Z,"Something that have occured on  TPB have screwed my account ; and they The Moderator ""Afro"" (login name) don't make any effort to help Piracy.

Therefore I cannot help you
 ....ask this guy Afro ( moderator ) if He can ? ( instead of banning me for asking help to recover )"
[T],Tanauser,2010-08-11T10:02Z,"@Drimicael

There is no bug in the pack ; it's just that the .exe ( cracked) is  also unlocking the Dlc's ; so you will have them twice ; but my units have no limit restriction .

Further more if the exe is updated by CA ; with another Patch ; this exe won't work anymore ; but you will still be able to play the Dlc in game with my pack 

understood ?"
,ATournas,2010-11-13T23:10Z,"Dear Sirs,
If I want to remove the dublicated units, is it OK if I just delete the user.script.txt..?
Will I miss any features from the game..?
THANX in advance for your answer..."
