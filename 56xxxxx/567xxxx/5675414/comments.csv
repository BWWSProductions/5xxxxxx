[V],jainmehul,2010-07-18T14:23Z,"hey b...... this might fell irritating to you,bt can you please download my this torrent :-
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5697919/
and review its quality,someone has given it 62 minus points and i m annoyed by that.........your words might change things"
[V],bubanee,2010-07-19T03:28Z,"-62... sounds like someone hates ya!.. ignore it or report to a mod at the forum 

http://suprbay.org/ 

i didn't download the whole torrent just the first song.. for a start it's at 48 not 44.1 and the cut rate is 18.9 which usually makes it a V2 and then i downloaded the Doh version... same cut off 18.9 and is a V2... where ever you got it from just be carefull it's not a transcode.. heaps of people do them to make a file bigger and suck people into thinking it's a V0 or 320kbps... 
and as for private sites i can't give that info out or i'll be removed.. "
,music_,2010-07-19T05:12Z,"no problem and i didnt got it from doh i got this from itunes i didnt purchased it....i got it from a forum.....

my torrent avg bitrate is 247 kbps and if you will convert the doh version you will get about 220 kbps avg........"
,music_,2010-07-19T05:14Z,and from where i got it its was not a transcode.........the forum i got it....it is great!!!.......
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-19T05:15Z,no problem thanks!!!....
,music_,2010-07-19T05:22Z,shit can some mod delete my 2 comments i wrote wrong comments in wrong torrent
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-19T05:23Z,hey b what is this 18.9 cutoff???
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-19T05:33Z,"hey b...consider my reaply as the comment of ""music_"" that is also my account although it is not my personall account it is hadled by one of my friend...."
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-19T05:43Z,"hey b....
the 1st songs cutoff is not 18.9 its 19.5 lok what mediainfo shows:-

Encoding settings : -m j -V 0 -q 0 -lowpass 19.5 --vbr-new -b 32"
[V],bubanee,2010-07-19T09:21Z,"Encoding settings : -m j -V 0 -q 0 -lowpass 19.5 --vbr-new -b 32 the only thing missing there is the lame version!.. what you wrote here is the highest possible V0 setting for Ripping!..
the 18.9khz is when the original song was ripped, from there people turn it into audio, flac transcode to anything and flog it off all over the place and a lot of people start thinking there is 12 different versions but all came from the one place.. but you will never change the original cut off from V2... but it is a good recording anyway J.. and really at the end of the day.. you could most prob never tell the difference anyway unless it is transcoded from a 128kbps...  "
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-19T09:40Z,"thanks for the info b......
anyways it wasn't a real cdrip but was better than the versions available and in which software you see the cutoff?????...........and btw i didn't got this from v2 source i had converted it from itunes m4a files i got from a blog

i was amazed how the torrent got -70 first when i uploaded it all of a sudden got -36 then in about 5 mins time it got -62 
how is this possible????"
[V],bubanee,2010-07-19T09:53Z,heres a little test you can do yourself.. grab a cd and change the V0 to V4 do 1 song.. and grab this program called spectro.. it's free on the net.. make sure the tab for 'cut off' is set.. drop the V4 in.. it should read pretty low.. now convert the V4 to Flac or V0 anything higher... and then drop it in again and you should see the same cut off...! and m4a also comes in all different varieties... 18.9 is standard V2 so the settings in m4a used was based around the same mark... most internet finds are based around V2 which is good if it's original source is a CD.. overtime you will learn alot about fakes and transcodes.. and for the minus thing... contact a tpb mod in the forum.. that is weird.. let me know how you go with spectro.. 
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-19T10:31Z,"hey b....

i m not finding that software...can you give me a download link??.....
all i found is a sound card analyzer software "
