,el_cunado,2012-03-10T05:02Z,"the screen blacks out for half a second several times throughout. LITERALLY several times in the funeral episode. just a tad bit irritating but it is negligible and takes nothing away from the show.

tho in the guttenberg episode it damn near took away a half second of lizzy caplans gorgeous body in the hot tub scene.

if you have the time, and you want hd quality, i would say download them episode by episode from other users. tho this is a collection and saves times, if you have ocd stay clear.

CAUSE I BARELY HAVE IT BUT IT IS STILL F_CKING IRRITATING"
