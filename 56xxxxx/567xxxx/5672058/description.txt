         The Pacific Crest Trail zigzags some 2,650 miles from         
         Mexico to Canada . It cuts through seven national Parks       
         and 24 national forests as it travels through California,     
         Oregon and Washington. Its a trail of ever-changing           
         obstacles - from some of the highest mountain passes in the   
         west to the hottest desert in the country. The two to three   
         hundred hikers who attempt the PCT each year often find out   
          quickly if they have what it takes for the journey ahead.
