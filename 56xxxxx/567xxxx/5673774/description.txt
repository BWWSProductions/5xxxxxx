     Decent vid, mixture of live and studio footage, as it says at     
     the start of the vid, their debut album was done in 2004, and     
     this video was made in 2008 (subsequently renamed '2008' and      
     remixed).                                                         
                                                                       
     Pre-deinterlaced convert, as their prev vid was also ntsc.        
     enjoy :)

     Stoned Ripping Project was founded in 2003 with the sole aim      
     of providing the scene with the  best Rock & Metal vids from      
     all around the world.  We do this for the love of the music,      
     and of course,  for fun. Despite the ease with which you can

     high quality rips, free of restrictions, is as important now      
     as it has ever been.
