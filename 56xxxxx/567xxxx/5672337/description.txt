2010.7.5

Glenn Beck Show - FOX News
*Holiday* REPEAT EPISODE - Founding Fathers

recorded and de-commercialized by zorchtorrent

*quality issue*: terribly sorry, but the blackout between 3:38 - 3:45 
is a transmission error courtesy of COMCAST. I'm becoming
quite displeased with their increasingly shitty service.
Always during GB. Why can't they do that during Geraldo? :(
Use one of Comcast's competitors IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. :)

Thanks for seeding!
