MC Lars' recently-released Twenty-Three EP (available on iTunes and Amazon MP3)

"Twenty-Three" and "Hey There Ophelia" are album cuts from "This Gigantic Robot Kills"; they're on the EP but I did not include them here.

(I have 'TGRK' available here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5227600/%5BFLAC%5D_MC_Lars_-_This_Gigantic_Robot_Kills)

What I did include is the new song "RealiTV" and the "On Twenty-Three" podcast discussion of that song.
