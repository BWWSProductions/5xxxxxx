Criticism of the Western Society & Civilization - Collection 5:

This upload examines other negative aspects of the Western society and civilization: domestic violence, man-made environmental disasters, and teenage sex and pregnancy.

While the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulting from the BP Deep Horizon oil rig explosion is currently dominating the news, the worst man-made environmental disaster is perhaps the Bhopal Gas Tragedy that occurred on the night of December 2-3, 1984 at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. One estimate to the casualties of that disaster put the death number at about 16,000:  8,000 died within the first weeks and another 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases. A government affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in 2006 stated that of the 558,125 cases of injury resulting from the disaster, 516,406 (92.5%) were minor, 38,478 (6.8%) were temporary partial disablement while 0.7% (~3,900) were severely and permanently disabled.
