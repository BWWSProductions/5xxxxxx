,quakerray,2010-07-14T18:35Z,hi is it possible to burn these onto 2 discs. i can only get 21 songs onto a disc using windows media.  when i did now 75 i had to split them onto 3 discs and create new covers.
[V],neon,2010-07-15T05:31Z,im not sure how long the running time of side 1 or 2 is.... a blank cd holds around 80 mins of music
,RTONYUK,2010-07-19T18:48Z,This is not a rip of the CD itself.

,mervynsow,2010-07-22T02:56Z,What a dissapointment. cos this is made up of various CDs it won't fit on 2 discs. doesn't display right in windows media. their is something really wrong with track 19 on CD1. goes from using 20meg of memory up to 200-300meg and has made WMP crash. has any one else encountered this?
