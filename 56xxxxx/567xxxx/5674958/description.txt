Dawn of Discovery takes place in the year 1404, when King Georges land is
suffering from severe droughts and brutal famine. Aware of his peoples
distress, the king calls on his two sons, William and Edward, to acquire new
territories in order to produce enough goods to satisfy the needs of his
empires inhabitants. Whereas Edward suggests aggressive means to collect
the precious resources, his brother William offers a peaceful solution,
proposing to explore new and unsettled lands in the south of the kingdom
With his Fathers blessing, William heads south to the mysterious Orient and
returns with valuable new technologies such as the water pump that allows
dry lands to be cultivated in order to produce enough food for the people
But there are still many unmet needs within the kings empire, and players
are tasked with the mission of fulfilling those needs while both expanding
and sustaining the vast society.
