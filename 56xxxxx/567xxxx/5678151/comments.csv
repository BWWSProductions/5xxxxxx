The Internet is not safe. Immediate action required.rnrn-- I repeat --rnrnTHE INTERNET IS NOT FREE.rnrnTHE INTERNET IS NOT SAFE.rnrnIMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED.rnrn-- Details and rationale --rnrnConsider this. What if a part of the Internet went down? Let\'s say that all USrnInternet servers suddenly become unreachable.rnrnThink that\'s impossible or unlikely? Think again.rnrnThe American devil (Obama) has announced his plans for a \""kill switch\"": a switchrnin his hands that would allow him to take down the complete (!) US Internetrnwhenever he chooses to.rnrnIf he presses that button, would you still be able to use the Internet the wayrnyou do now? Do you know where the servers that you use for browsing, mailing,rnchatting are located?rnrnLet me remind you that Google is an American company. Twitter. Facebook.rnMicrosoft.rnrnTo reiterate: The Internet, in its current state, is not safe from policitiansrn(i.e. madmen).rnrnWhat can and what should be done?rnrnThe Internet needs to be restructured. Every service that currently relies onrnAmerica in some kind has to be replaced with an America-independent one.rnrnAlso, while you\'re at it, you could reduce or eliminate your dependency onrnSERVERS in general. Servers, even when located outside of America, are arnproblem. They cost money. They are subject to government interference. They arernnot safe. They are controlled by corporate entities which are un-trustworthyrnentities.rnrnThe solution lies in server-less networks (peer-to-peer networks). Some goodrnpeer-to-peer networks already exist, but they only provide a limited number ofrnservices.rnrnToday, you can share files over peer-to-peer networks. But you can\'t read andrnwrite your mail over such a network. You can\'t really browse for news over suchrna network. For these functions, you still have to rely on servers.rnrnThats should be changed, as soon as possible. It will take the Internet to thernnext level: truly resilient, truly controlled by the people (i.e. EVERYONE) and,rnfinally, truly safe.rnrn*rnrnWhen the move away from servers is well underway, the next thing to look at willrnbe the Internet\'s physical infrastructure. This infrastructure is alsorncorporate-controlled. Using the Internet is usually cheap, but not free. rnrnAlso, the corporate infrastructure is vulnerable, for example, in the case of anrneconomic breakdown. (Think that\'s impossible? Study some history.)rnrnThus, everyone who uses the Internet should contribute to bulding a new,rnnon-commercial physical infrastructure for it.rnrnSet up local wireless networks. Connect these networks to each other. Sharernconnections. Build a scalable, resilient ad-hoc network using local resourcesrn(everyone\'s routers).rnrnThis, of course, is also an engineering tasks. Thankfully, the Internet hostsrnmillions of skilled engineers. :)rnrn*rnrnAll of this might not look like a problem to you today. Yet you will soon beginrnto notice that a problem indeed exists, and it is growing.rnrnThe primary problem lives in a white house, smiles while it kills scores ofrninnocents and likes to be called \""Mr. Obama\"". (Or was it \""Osama\""? Oh well.rnThey\'re kind of all the same, aren\'t they. Osama seems to be a tad more on therngood side though. And he doesn\'t lie as much as that Obama guy.)rnrnAlright. Enough for today. Spread the message. Join the revolution. Get to work!rnrn-The Internet Revolution Task Forcer"
