		IGTB

As civilization passed...the year 2000, a great cultural revolution immersed the world in a peace which was to last up to the present time. Governments, as we know them, ceased to exist, and with the governments went world economy. With the invention of the first multi-purpose robots, life became very easy and time was spent on developing the creative mind of man.
 
It was the "creators" who ran society. while robots looked after essential administration, men and women teamed up as "creators" for the good of the whole. The better the creations produced, the larger their sphere of influence, inevitably becoming the ruling powers. 

Science and technology was at its zenith. In the year 2014, the Star Drive Rocket had been invented by Joseph Harding and a year after the Star Drive Corporation ruled the world market. With Star Drive Rockets capable of hyperspace travel, the Star Drive Corporation began to mine the nearby planets bringing valuable minerals and ore back to Earth. But their rule was about to end, in fact, to surrender and merge into the now legendary VIBRA CORPORATION, creators of the most revolutionary invention since the wheel...the VIBRACON GLOBE. 

A team of bio-scientists working for VIBRA had stumbled upon a new energy source. They had found a way to amplify the VIBRA rhythms (or energy in emotions) sent out by the human body aura, and to harness them as an independent force. This new energy was used in many ways, the best known being the VIBRACON GLOBE. 

The GLOBE was used primarily in the production of robots which were offered for sale to qualified customers for use in the following manner: one would buy a robot, at that time the Mark I costing 1000 Drimes, and the robot would duplicate the buyer's VIBRA rhythms thus giving the two a personality of one. 

It was the VIBRA Corporation that first instigated colonization of the planets, and it was in Star Drive rockets, constructed by the VIBRA Corp. the first pioneers left. World overpopulation was getting worse. People had to be stirred into looking to the stars. The VIBRA principle was used in creating that situation. Music was composed to help people get into the glories of space travel, "Starship Jingle", and rockets were built to carry thousands to the stars. The first ship took off in 2035, and each year more followed. 

While Earth and her nearest neighbors flourished, the Star Drive Rockets sailed through their generations of hopeful pilgrims. Ten generations later, with the loss of many ships, they sighted their goal. In another galaxy, they discovered a beautiful planet which they called NEW EARTH. The year was 3035. 

It was a glorious triumph for the VIBRA Corporation and the begining of the legend which would reach every corner of the known universe. 

It didn't take long for the inhabitants of NEW EARTH to make alien contact, and amidst the treaties and federations there grew a great love of creative pastimes. 

Director of the creative departments of the VIBRA Corporation was Professor Lanse Roegring. It was the Professor's job to make sure that cultural relations between the planets ran smoothly, and it was Roegring who first came up with the idea of an...InterGalactic Touring Band.

3.	UNIVERSAL ZOO/WHY?

Opening with an IGTB favorite about the "Universal Zoo," a menagerie where even humans are kept, the band follow up with a new song that asks us - "Why"?


(1st Chorus)
Ooh!, Ahh!, Ooh!, Ahh!, Ooh!, Ahh!, Ooh!, Ahh!
Ooh!, Ahh!, Ooh!, Ahh!, Ooh!, Ahh!, Ooh!, Ahh!

(1st Lead)

This way to realize your fantasy!

To bring a million smiles of mystery!

To see the world turning

		Volunteer for the Star Ships!

5.	STARSHIP JINGLE

Earth had become an overcrowded utopia. In the greatest publicity campaign ever, the governments of Earth tried to persuade its people to..."Go Forth and Multiply." The Star Drive had been perfected, the first ships were almost ready. The only trouble was...nobody wanted to go!


(Chorus)
TheyÂ´re building a Starship! A Starship! A Starship!
To take us away, take us away, take us away,
Away, away, away, away...

(Lead)
DonÂ´t be afraid, the stars are only mirrors
Reflecting all the mornings yet to come!
Beyond the sky are worlds without an ending
Could you? Would I?
Deny our childrenÂ´s childrenÂ´s childrenÂ´s children,
Such a great big, wonderful Galaxy!

(Chorus)
TheyÂ´re building a Starship! A Starship! A Starship!
To take us away, take us away, take us away,
Away, away, away, away...

(Lead)
DonÂ´t be afraid, each container will sustain you
Immortal drives are energized by time!
The warp and whelm of space is not unbending
So why not try to give a little Nebuli
Could you? Would I?
Deny our children, such a high?
Our children, such a
Great big, wonderful Galaxy!

(Chorus)
TheyÂ´re building a Starship! A Starship! A Starship!
TheyÂ´re building a Starship! A Starship! A Starship!
TheyÂ´re building a Starship! A Starship! A Starship!
TheyÂ´re building a Starship! A Starship! A Starship!

7.	REACHING OUT

The second ship drifted through its generations of hopeful pioneers. At times a deep nostalgia for the old Earth was experienced-even by those born on the ship who had never set foot on it themselves. The pioneers would stare for days into the blackness of space, searching for the distant speck that was Earth...their home.


WeÂ´re lost and alone and weÂ´re drifting forever
DonÂ´t know where we are and weÂ´ll never, no never
Go home to our Earth far away, just a dot on the screen,
Never seen but sheÂ´s never forgotten,
(Echo): ...forgotten...forgotten...

Born to be born on the wings of Creation
We were the first now weÂ´re tenth generation
Our guidance control lies aloof and dismembered
Our ship has forgotten
But we have remembered,
(Echo): ...remembered...remembered...

Mountains and forests
Bright shining streams
A place where man was always meant to be...

Oh how we miss you!

WeÂ´re reaching out...
WeÂ´re reaching out...
WeÂ´re reaching out...
WeÂ´re reaching out...
Reaching out...
For You!, For You!
Only you!, Only you!

(Lead)
We bring you greetings from our kind
And hope our feelings can define
The joy of knowing now
WeÂ´re never alone
Never and ever and ever be home
Ever and ever and ever be home
WeÂ´ll ever and ever be home

WeÂ´ve sailed the stars in comely wombs
So long and dark and dreary tombs
Your worldÂ´s so all inviting
CouldnÂ´t we share?
Ever and ever and ever be

(Chorus)
Home! Home! JourneyÂ´s end!
Blue skies over our heads!
Green grass!
Ever and ever and ever be
Home! Home! JourneyÂ´s end!
New Earth under our feet!
Sweet air!
Ever and ever and ever be home!
WeÂ´ll ever and ever be home

Home! Home! JourneyÂ´s end! JourneyÂ´s end!

Sad people, now glad people
With ten generations of love!
Silently weeping,
Tears that last a thousand years!
Burn the ships! Burn the ships!

(Chorus)
Home! Home! Burn the ships! Burn the ships!
Home! Home! Home! Home!
Home! Home! JourneyÂ´s end!
Blue skies over our heads!
Green grass!
Ever and ever and ever be
Home! Home! JourneyÂ´s end!
New Earth under our feet!
Sweet air!

		No one is cold on Monday!

12.	A PLANET CALLED MONDAY/EPILOGUE

One of the strangest adventures the IGTB ever experienced was a trip to A PLANET CALLED MONDAY. Without any permanent source of heat, the inhabitants had to come up with a means of artificially heating their planet. Thus was established the "Climb for Life", the spiral staircases that brought their people to the top of the sky where they burned, their bodies giving off the energy to let others live. This "Golden Sunrise" would be a sight the IGTB would not forget.


Monday morning, (ooh, ooh), everybodyÂ´s yawning, (ooooh)
Gotta get up, get out, get into town, musnÂ´t be late
Silent travellers, (ooh, ooh), never speaking, (ooooh)
Only the buzz of a terminal bubble
Cruising the airways circling round

Monday morning, (ooh, ooh), everybodyÂ´s crawling, (ooooh)
Spiral stairways to the Sun!
Monday morning, (ooh, ooh), everybodyÂ´s yawning, (ooooh)
Got to keep the fires high,
Send them all into the sky
Save us from eternal night
We need, (aah), sunlight! (aah)

Monday morning, silence crawling, (ooh, ooh)

SomeoneÂ´s got to keep this planet turning
Make us warm so we may rise again
SomeoneÂ´s got to keep the fires burning
No oneÂ´s cold when stairs unfold on
Monday Morning! Monday Morning! Monday Morning!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
No oneÂ´s cold on Monday morning!

Once we lazed on sun soaked beaches frying
Golden people blessed with days of light
Now we only climb to keep from dying!
No oneÂ´s cold when stairs unfold on
Monday morning, everybodyÂ´s crawling,
Spiral Stairways, Spiral Stairways, Spiral Stairways
Spiral Stairways, Spiral Stairways, Spiral Stairways
Spiral Stairways, Spiral Stairways, Spiral Stairways
Monday Morning, Spiral Stairways, Monday Morning
Spiral Stairways, Monday Morning, Spiral Stairways
Monday Morning, Spiral Stairways


13.	EPILOGUE
 
Golden sunrise, meets the dawn
Bubbles cruise in air over spaceway trains
Golden sunrise, through the haze
Towers rise and fall, rise and shine
Golden Sunrise, (Golden Sunrise), Monday Morning
Golden Sunrise, (Golden Sunrise), Monday Morning
Golden Sunrise, (Golden Sunrise), Monday Morning
Golden Sunrise, (Golden Sunrise), Monday Morning...

		Pray! The Keeper listens...

14.	KEEPER KEEP US
  
As the concert comes to a close, the IGTB encourages everyone to join in with them, on the anthem of the Keeper, the Being that guides them through their journeys-wherever they may be.


(Lead)
Twenty billion miles away, beyond the doors of time
Watching from a lone celestial tower
ThereÂ´s a man who keeps us safe, nothing goes unseen
Stary sentinel so far from home

There within his silent world, he sits a timeless throne
And pioneer ships that pass all bless his name
Children sing of legends old, across the lanes of space
Stories told about a faceless king

(Chorus)
Keeper, the man with the key to our destiny
And weÂ´ve been waiting so long
And weÂ´ve been waiting so long
And weÂ´ve been waiting so long
ahhh...ahhh...ahhh...ahhh...ahhh...
And weÂ´ve been waiting so long, (so long)
And weÂ´ve been waiting so long, (so long)
