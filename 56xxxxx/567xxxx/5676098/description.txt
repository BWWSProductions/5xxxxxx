"In order to create a broad and authoritative reference on food today, 41 researchers from universities around the world were asked to provide their academic expertise on complex information and ideas in a manner that could be communicated across disciplinary boundaries without obscuring the underlying complexity. The disciplines represented range across the entire gamut of the sciences and humanities as contributors address the environment, agriculture and fisheries, health, society, culture, and ethics. Among their topics are soil degradation and conservation, sustainable agriculture in developing countries, the effects of agricultural practices on nutrient profiles of foods, roots and roles of alternative agrifood systems, sustainable regional food systems and healthy rural livelihoods, and animal welfare. The two volumes are paged and indexed separately."
