,hamai,2010-07-12T18:14Z,why wouldn\'t SecretMyth upload with his account?
,c3bhm,2010-07-15T03:09Z,"Typical SecretMyth quality: awesome especially considering small file-size.rnrnFor those who grew up in the 70\'s or 80\'s, I recommend re-watching the original \'Clash\'.rnI just did, with a little puff of something \'herbal\', and revisited awesome childhood memories.rnThe torrent of it is available and good quality."

,marcopolo3000,2010-07-17T18:38Z,You guys are doing a fantastic job and are by far the best 720P rippers on the scene and my only reason for even wanting Blu Ray rips. Do you guys have a site that tells your fans what movies will be released next? I notice you have done alot of trilogy and hexology packs. Can you please please do the Star Trek Decology? That would make my entire year!!!
