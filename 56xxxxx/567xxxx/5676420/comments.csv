,mizzllat,2011-07-03T12:15Z,"Thanks, everything is fine.  If you are like me, though, and mate up all your subtitles in a single sitting, be forewarned: Episode 5 has the title ""Hawthorne"" misspelled as ""Hawthrone"" and so it is out of position, in the place of Episode 10, instead of where you'd expect to find it, between 4- 6."
