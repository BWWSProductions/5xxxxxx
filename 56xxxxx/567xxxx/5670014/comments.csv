I know I've seen this elephant report about a year and a half ago, maybe 2 years ago.


Is this a compilation, or a repeat from 2008?"
,PhilLesh12,2010-07-05T09:28Z,"No, I get it now.  

I saw this episode 2 years ago because I am from this present's future, in the past.

No, wait, I'm from the future, in the past, seeing the present?

or, I'm from the present, visiting the future.

shit.  Maybe I'm from the past, visiting the future, in this present?

Damn, seeing a ""new"" ""2010"" 60 minutes, and having total recall of the entire 60 minutes, including some quotes, really confuses me.  

How can I know all of these stories, and remember watching them sometime before March 2009, without traveling in time?"
