"Incoming"

After discovering that Tori (Kate Lang Johnson) 
is missing, the group's search for her turns up 
a mysterious newcomer (Kandyse McClure) with 
the name "Erika" tattooed on her arm. Erika 
reacts violently to her new surroundings and 
physically attacks Joe (Jason Wiles), Janet 
(Daisy Betts), Blackham (Sean O'Bryan) and 
Moira (Tina Holmes). Meanwhile, a suspicious 
Renbe (Gerald Kyd) believes he's found a link
between Tori's fate and Janet's disappearance.

Enjoy :)
