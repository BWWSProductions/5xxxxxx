,Buale,2010-07-06T00:00Z,"Over 12hours for 532mb and still not out, too much peers sou i need friends to download from me direct before uploading to sites to build seeds.
If somebody want that i can record better picture,
more mb.
Any sugestion :)"
,Buale,2010-07-06T11:22Z,"This is what i mean:
After i create torrent i send 2-3 guys torrent on mail to download direct from me, and after they download i upload on site torrent with few seeds.
Thats the faster way to share motogp races.
For me its ok how it is to share torrents but fast download is better :):):)"
