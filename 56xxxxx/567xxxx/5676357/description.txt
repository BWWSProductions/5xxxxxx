With a file me and the team have created you can now jtag your xbox 360
using only a usb drive!
the file is called CronCrypt, 
it took 3 months of coding, but weve done it!

Ok so heres the deal,
to get the file to work,
1.what you do is run it, (run as administrator)
2.then once youve done that connect a usb drive
3.Dump the file onto a usb drive,
4.GO to your xbox, and connect usb drive,
5.On the Xbox, Delete all old patches ( if you need help look on
6.then go to memory, and click the usb, then run file,
  BAM you jtag'd your xbox.
   
Happy Modding :)
