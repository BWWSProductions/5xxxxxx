Accounts may be inaccessible. ............ Torrents may appear to be missing. ........... Registering or resetting passwords may not work................. Uploading may not be possible. .............. The system as a whole is being worked on and that will fix many of the issues.

Really appreciate all your uploads though, the quality is great considering the file sizes :D Keep it up!"
