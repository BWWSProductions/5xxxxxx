,TheBigHase,2010-07-05T18:52Z,With Trojan or without!? ;-)
,trimidogg,2010-07-05T19:16Z,"Update.exe it's not a Trojan  and Update.exe it is included 

here you have source file

http://sites.google.com/site/trimidsite/Home/Update.txt?attredirects=0&d=1

As you can see it's a bat file compiled on exe

If you think this is a Trojan DON'T DOWNLOAD IT "
,TheBigHase,2010-07-05T19:53Z,OK it's the same Trojan again! You say it's not aTrojan !? What is it then? So actually I can throw away my AVG or what? My dear trimidogg I am very concerned about your updates no matter what u say - if it is nothing dangerous why is there  an alert at all!? I don't trust you 100% but still risk the updates and remove the Trojan and hope it will be OK! 
,trimidogg,2010-07-05T21:42Z,"look my friend am telling you it is not a Trojan it is a bat file ""CMD"" uses HldsUpdateTool to update the game files works just perfect that way to update the game only thing may not work it's the crack after update sometimes it works sometimes it does not work so you don't have to believe me i don't want you to , so go search or ask someone who knows better sent him that txt file i send you ask them if it is any trojan there , they will say no if they know something , after that compile that file to exe AVG will say it's a trojan because AVG sucks also there is another way for you to fix this ""Trojan"" as you call it this patch is compiled in exe with WinRaR so just open it with WinRaR Delete Update.exe and it's all done keep in mind i always Double Scan Files with McAfee VirusScan Enterprise v8.7i / NOD32 v4.2.40 Both up to date so this are 2 anti viruses i trust most and are the best for now 
SO I REPEAT AGAIN AND AGAIN IF YOU THINK THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THOSE FILES JUST SEARCH THEM SOMEWERE ELS AND STOP COMMENTING ABOUT THAT AND THAT AND THAT YOU CALL IT A TROJAN TROJAN IT IS SO JUST ASK IF YOU NEED SOMETHING ELS AND DO NEVER EVER POST  SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THAT SUCKS REALLY SUCKS IT'S NOT THAT I GIVE A SHIT IF ANY ONE DOWNLOADS THIS OR NOT BUT WHEN I POST SOMETHING I POST SO OTHERS CAN ENJOY THAT I DON'T POST THING TO PISS OFF PPL SPECIALLY VIRUSES MAYBE SOME FILES DON'T WORK FOR ALL BUT I POST EM AFTER I RUN A TEST ON IT SO WORKS FOR ME I CALL IT OK "
,D0gmeat,2010-07-05T22:40Z,"Iggy the troll, Trimidogg. :)

Your stuff always shows as clean for me using NIS and Malwarebytes. AVG's a freebie scanner with large amounts of false hits. 

@TBH: So yes toss your AVG. If you are concerned, use a multi-scan site that will scan stuff for you using multiple scanners. You will AVG reports positive when most scanners report nada."
,TheBigHase,2010-07-06T09:11Z,"I am really  not your friend - that's a bottom line. Again you offend me  , cool - if u were a ""good"" guy you wouldn't have to do so,right!? But to me you are just a big mouth using caps and dirty langue first and act as a big man you little weenie boy who doesn't get attention in real life  - that makes u the loser - u ain't got no style,bro. But I still enjoy the game and there's nothing you can do about that!  And I even got ""The Passing"" running without your fuckin support!   HaHa!  T.T.F.N."

,AntraxM,2010-07-06T16:12Z,"Hello.

I still can't understand a lot about this game's setup.
I've installed the 2.0.1.8. v of this game, and already used this 2.0.2.4 update.
But when I try to create a new game or join servers, it doesn't seem to connect to the network and it ends up in a loop. I've read some .txts and it seems I need to choose option 4 at the update.exe to join an online game.  I tried it and the answer was ""no instalation record find at.... /left4dead"". How do I get this to work? Sorry for the spam."
,ncaccel,2010-07-08T05:27Z,Works fine... Thanks trimidogg
,TheBigHase,2010-07-09T07:42Z,@trimifucksdogs: I will stay here as long as I please I am with this place for many years when u were still shitting your vlies u little asswhipe!  ! Wanna complain? Go ahead and see who will be banned! And your dirty words  that you copy from some other place don\'t bother me at all. You are a  teenage minded coward that\'s what u are if u have balls come and we fight man to man! I do hope the law will catch u some day you sure are a criminal who also does other things! And let\'s see who has the last laugh! I will haunt you here you can count on that! You started to offend me I apologized I explained how it got started I only asked questions concerning the game and you offended me for no reason! You want war? You got it! CU and FU!
,trimidogg,2010-07-09T15:06Z,@ a bitch named TheBigHasenJust don\'t start crying Hoe go fuck your Sister and pee on your mum :D as for the law fuck you and your law Outlowz here :D
,TheVoid13,2010-07-20T04:18Z,"@ TBH and Trimidog

TBH: Grow up. No one is gonna come to fight you. If you don't trust it so much, why bother dropping a line?

Dog: Just stop. He ain't leaving, obviously, so quit complaining. And seriously? Your gonna fuck every one he knows to death? 1, thats sick. 2, your BOTH complaining the equivelent of spilt milk. 3, If you wanna do that much damage, it had better be worth the prison sentence. Your acting like the kid who bludgeoned his dad with a sledge hammer after getting his games taken away. Which is sad. I'm surprised neother of you were banned.

PS: No I'm not replying further (out of maturity)"
,NEGATIVE-ZERO,2010-07-21T13:06Z,"err why wont the maps load?
the menu loads fine
key: start>loading>menu>single player>map loading... then back to menu
i did the required stuff for single player"
,TheBigHase,2010-07-26T18:02Z,"@thevoid13: I am much much older as u might think! HE started to be cheeky and offensive not me! Just read all and u will see I'm telling truth! And it is fact that there is a Trojan in his Updates may that be ""dangerous"" or not! WHY!?  And very interesting - he don't show up here anymore for some time now - hm and why is that may I ask!? I say he is a sickminded guy and his upload is not because he is caring of others who cant afford buying games! I know I wrote dirty words too but I was defending and what he wrote was beyond all borders of humanity!  But I shall be glad if he is here no more! Maybe he got banned and if so he deserved it imo! And I am here for many years and have very often given advise and help if I could  so I consider myself a ""good"" member of TPB!"
,TheBigHase,2010-07-26T18:17Z,@thevoid13: Firstly I am much much older probably than both of u!  Second: It is a fact for me that he started to offend me for no reason - when u upload things u have to be aware that ppl might ask questions right!? That is just what I did!  And what he wrote is upsolutely no go and is a crime! Also I was only defending which is my human right to do! What I find remarkable at this point is that he don't show up for some time now and no more updates ! In case he don't show up here anymore - I ain't gonna miss him - wanna blame me for that too!?
,TheBigHase,2010-07-26T18:31Z,"...forgot to mention also about the Trojan that I found in his updates - may it be dangerous or not - it is not fair to have Trojans in your uploads in the first place or am I wrong again!? And that is the cream of it all - him being arrogant first , then offensive to me and then dirty and primitive  and above all uploading Trojans - I am the ""guilty"" here!? I see!"
,trimidogg,2010-08-02T14:24Z,Wtf you are still eating that shit don't download it you stupid ass
,TheBigHase,2010-08-04T17:06Z,"Oi,Shithead! Wassup!?  Sorry to see ur still alive and able to write but hey at least u don't post here any new Trojan  shitfilled updates and more ""releases""  here ASSHOLE,huh? !  Why is that ? Any explaination why you don't ?  You Albanian piece o' shit! I stay tuned how aboutcha! And I'm still focussed on u Moron! And I'm not playing your fucking up anymore there are better around , u think ur the only one haha! FU"

,CatHellsky,2010-11-10T01:57Z,"For people thinking  there may be a trojan. I'm not sure if there is a trojan or not, but some cracks are mistaken as trojans. I've been through this with other programs. You have to either disable your antivirus or make an exception. 
Norton, AVG, and McCafee will most likely report cracks as trojans. That's the way it is. "
