,keithtselle,2010-07-05T22:18Z,Dubbed? That's going to sound very fuckin' dumb. Don't even waste your time downloading a stupid dubbed version.
,NitLions,2010-07-07T05:36Z,sooooooooooo...is it a decent movie or what?? Thanks for letting us know where you will be sharing it over and over again but how about even a little info about the film from those who have downloaded it??
,subversion,2010-07-07T13:57Z,"It's not a dub. (And if you're anti-dubbing anyway, you're being ignorant. Most quality anime, for one thing, have quality english voice acting. Any of the Miyazaki movies are excellent, for example).

For most of the movie, the actors are speaking in english with japanese subtitles. For a few scenes near the end, they're speaking in japanese with no subtitles. Unfortunately in the english scenes, most of the actors have weird masks over their mouth, which muffles their already challenging english, making it nearly impossible to make out. Especially during the action scenes.

As for the movie, not so great. Some interesting visuals, but mostly it seems to be about showing off the female actors costumes (which are great), and showing off some cgi (which is good, but uninteresting). I'm sure I missed out on stuff during the scenes in japanese, but I doubt it would have redeemed much."

,highlander777,2010-09-26T10:31Z,"The editing really sucked for the movie. Nothing really happens for the first 14 mins of the movie. It's basically a disembodied voice giving the introduction. That could have been done better. In fact, I was thinking of stopping the movie 10 mins into it because it was so boring.

Then there's an action sequence which is pretty cool. They are trying to kill these giant sandworms for points as the characters are in this massive video game.

Then the movie slows down again. In order to advance to the next level in the game, they have to join forces. To me and you, this is a no brainer. But A LOT OF TIME in this movie is spent on the characters trying to decide to join forces. The audience is asking ""Why are you dwelling on this?"" I'm sure the SNAIL was symbolic for something although I can't imagine what. Maybe it symbolized the snail's pace of this scene. Needless to say, it was a very slow and boring sequence.

Then there's another action sequence and, while good, the first action sequence was better. 

The actresses were all attractive but the only good parts of the movie was the actress playing Gray. She was HOT!
