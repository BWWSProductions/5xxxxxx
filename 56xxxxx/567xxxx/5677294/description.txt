Jonathan Sawday presents five portraits of Restoration Britain.

In May 1660 Charles II was invited to take the throne.  He was
crowned King of Scotland January 1651 and King of England
April 1651.

There was an effusion of baroque music, bawdy plays, scientific
progress, new architecture, and entertainments - The Restoration.
But how much was really restored, how much was new, and how much
had never gone away?


There was also dancing in the streets, not so much for having the
monarchy back, but rather, because it was the beginning of the end
[in England anyway] for puritanism and the Solemn League and Covenant.

Scotland had to wait a bit longer. But even here, just 350 years on,
apart from in the outer islands, the power of The Kirk to impose
social conformity is now dead.
