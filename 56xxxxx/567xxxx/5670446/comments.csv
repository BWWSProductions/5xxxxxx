ohh i have looked around for this, what is the best way to watch your rips without jerkiness etc? Im using a laptop with NVidia. With Media PLayer Classic and CoreAVC as the video decoder. Stopped using vlc cause of the jerkiness. hahah, i dont know much about this.

[V],RiddlerA,2010-07-06T07:37Z,"@ all 

welcome guys for all the support
I will be doing new movies when a good print comes out
Requests for old movies id on hold for a month as I have already a lot to complete & it would take me a month Atleast

@ azrash 

I usually use a combo of K lite Codec + Gomplayer/WMP/Media player classic
It works fine for me

I have heard CoreAVC is very good as it is made specifically for watching X264 videos, have never used though so don't know much about it

If anyone is facing jerkiness issues, avoid using Gom Player & try WMP as GOM is a little heavy player"
