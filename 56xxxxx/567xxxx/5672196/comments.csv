First off, thank you so much for your contributions.  I always look forward to your new releases.  You really do deserve your green skull.

I'd like to request three movies from your collection:

D2: The Mighty Ducks
Antwone Fisher
Angels in the Outfield

Any or all of them would be great.  Thank you, again.  I hope you had a great 4th!
