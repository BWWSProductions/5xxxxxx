On one side is an army of gunmen dead-set on springing a murderous cohort from jail. On the other is sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) and his two deputies: one a recovering drunkard (Dean Martin), the other a crippled codger (Walter Brennan).

Also in their ragtag ranks are an unseasoned, trigger-happy youth (Ricky Nelson)and a woman with a past (Angie Dickinson) - and her eye on Chance. Director Howard Hawks lifted the Western to new heights with Red River. Capturing the legendary West with a stellar cast in peak form, he does it again here.
