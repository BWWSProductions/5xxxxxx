I thought the pink pirate thingy meant you were proven - I guess not. Unpleasent lesson learned."
,Presidentdagwood,2010-07-06T22:36Z,I also tryed this torrent. I got the samething. Why are they going to report you if the serial does not work. Are they going to report you because you tryed to use a baned serial. The program only works in trial mode. They need to get a real job and leave the stuck at home and the unemployed alone. The uploader was trtcrew. Now bigwimpie. Why would you offer a upload that has a serial trap in it. You have been reported. LMAO
,Deweyst,2010-07-07T04:23Z,bigwimpie - any words in your defense?
