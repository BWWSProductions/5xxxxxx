Retardoface - Do i really have to say anything? I will say this though, i've heard probably every fucking version of dark side of the moon, black triangle non-emphasized, original pressing in vinyl quality, dvda quality, oh by the way rip, and i must say this is smoothest sveksiest version i've heard, any pink floyd fan, rather human being should download this and listen, this is truly how the record was supposed to sound. My friend came over and listened to it, he thought it was surround sound, because the sound fills the whole room, trips you out, makes me feel like your being surrounded by it, its lovely. So without further adieu, i give you The Dark Side Of The Moon, 192 kHz 24 bit vinyl, enjoy ladies.
