,retardoface,2010-07-07T12:43Z,"ya there was only 1 other complaint of this, try using a different program, cause both cues are there"
,Anakunda,2010-07-07T14:50Z,"any recommendations? 
just to parse the cue and make subsong indexes"
,retardoface,2010-07-08T02:22Z,"The gears used are: top Michell turntable with SME3009 tonearm, specially adopted Denon MC head, custom build pre and ADC/DAC, and the computer specially adopted for the Music. No declicking or any other digital treatment was made for this rip. It is direct-from-vinyl transfer. "

,tweakhax,2010-07-10T09:44Z,Wow. All I can say is Wow. Listening to this DSotM reminds me of the first time I heard it. Aboslutely amazing. Doesn\'t even compare to the other FLAC or lossless rips on here. Thank you thank you thank you thank you.
,P.O.N.,2010-08-03T19:37Z,Amazing! Great job.
[T],insinuendo,2010-09-25T13:43Z,Thanks.
,thermal_audio,2010-12-13T19:11Z,"this is a stellar recording.  you've captured a wonderful example of ""killer"" vinyl hifi successfully.

thanks thank you and thanks again!
this is breathtaking.  

the character of this capture brought back memories of listenting to my uncle's original release with headphones when i was 11 or so.

it literally blew my mind.  so did this !

"
[T],Jonzee,2011-01-29T21:39Z,"Truly fantastic, this version captures that ominous acoustic depth that originally made DSOTM so compelling & intense.I think perhaps the original masters will never sound like this again. Thanks for sharing this."
,E.Brown,2011-02-23T04:58Z,"I just Register to thank you man! The best Vinyl rip version of this and like you mention it: i had hear almost any version. There is a quadraphonic version of this album, but i really preffer this. THANKS FOR UPLOAD! Greeting from MĂŠxico."
,monkman2112,2011-10-30T11:55Z,"How do i play this? Only got Nuforce Icon HDP, which does 96kHz. Is Audacity capable of downsampling this to 96kHz? Or ist there a better option? Using a mac....  thx!"
,monkman2112,2011-10-30T13:54Z,"Seems like a fake to me. one channel is only distortion, or is that the cool thing about pink floyd? right channel has music in it. resampled it to 96khz and played it back with audivana and vlc. crap... or is it me? but how?"
