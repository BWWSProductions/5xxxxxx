lobby interface.

For detailed information on online multiplayer and Custom Match, including
controls and options, please refer to the Multiplayer.pdf file included on your
Grand Theft Auto IV game disc or visit: http://www.rockstargames.com/IV/PC

________________________________________________________________________

9) VIDEO EDITOR
_______________________

The all new Video Editor feature allows you to capture in-game footage, make real
time edits and render those clips out as WMV movie files. The clips can also be
spliced together into a video complete with post effects like music, text and transitions,
and other features typically found in video editing suites. You can then share
your video(s) with others to view and rate in Rockstar Games Social Club TV.

Clip Capture
At any time during the game (single or multiplayer), press the F2 key to dump a
chunk of footage to your hard drive. Depending on how data intensive things are in
the world at that time, the clip should be about 30 seconds to a minute long. Captured
footage will be the action that occurs PRIOR to pressing F2. Note that if you have a
slower machine, you also have the option to turn off this feature altogether.

Launching the Video Editor
To launch the Video Editor, call it up using your in-game cell phone. A prompt will let
you know that any unsaved data will be lost, after which you jump into a separate menu
to view and edit your clips. You arrive at this screen with the following choices:
â€¢ Clips
â€¢ Editor
â€¢ Gallery
â€¢ Upload
â€¢ Online

Clips
All the raw footage you've captured in-game can be viewed quickly in the Clips
section. There are standard DVD style controls for video playback. In addition, you
can hold down the right mouse button to move the camera and view your clip from
alternate angles and then update your clip thumbnail making it easy to organize your
clips.

Editor
Selecting Editor allows you to create a video from your raw clips. Here you can name
your video, string multiple clips together, add music, titles, and transitions.
Your raw footage clips appear on the left side of the screen. The upper right portion
of the screen is the storyboard editing space. Drag and drop your clip footage into the
storyboard to create a video. Double click a thumbnail on the storyboard to edit it.
You can add markers within your clips which allow you to place cameras and filters,
and adjust audio and speed settings.

To quickly create a video for upload, make sure you have at least one clip in the
storyboard editing space and then hit the Web option in Export To Gallery.

Gallery
The section labeled Gallery contains all of the complete, exported videos. By default,
the last exported video is displayed in the preview window. The thumbnails on the
right side of the screen are arranged with the most recent ones appearing at the top.

Upload
In the section labeled â€œUpload,â€ players can submit their exported web videos to the
Social Club. The left side of the screen shows local videos that you have created. The
right side is a web portal displaying all the videos that you have uploaded.

Online
The â€œOnlineâ€ section will minimize Grand Theft Auto IV and will take you directly to
the Rockstar Games Social Club TV website using your default web browser. There
you can view clips others have uploaded as well as rate clips and comment on them.
The Video Editor is a full featured tool. For more details, view the Video-Editor.pdf
file included on your Grand Theft Auto IV game disc or visit:
www.rockstargames.com/IV/PC

________________________________________________________________________

10) INDEPENDENCE FM (USER RADIO)
_______________________

For the first time ever, you can now select your own favorite songs to play through
the in-game radio station Independence FM.

Simply place your non DRMâ€™ed MP3s, WMAs, or M4As (or shortcuts to your music
folders) in the file location below:
My DocumentsRockstar GamesGTA IVUser Music

Note: Quicktime or iTunes needs to be installed for M4A support.

After accessing Independence FM as you would with any other in-game radio station,
you will also have the following options in the Audio tab of the Pause Menu:

Scanning Modes
Enable Auto Scan - Set this to ON to perform a Quick Scan automatically on game
startup.
Quick Scan - Reads the audio files within your folder, plays back exactly as they are
in the folder.
Complete Scan - Reads the audio files within your folder, performs additional
analysis to enhance user experience.

Play Modes
Sequential - Plays through audio files as they appear in your folder, can skip songs.
Shuffle - Plays through audio files randomly, can skip songs.
Radio - Plays through audio files randomly with radio adverts and DJ banter in
between tracks, cannot skip songs.


________________________________________________________________________

11) BENCHMARKING
_______________________

General:
	In-Game:
	Benchmarking can be run from the Graphics section of the start or pause menu.  Upon completion, 
	the tool will display the results in-game as well as writing the results to a file in:
	MyDocumentsRockstarGamesGTAIVBenchmarks
	
	Command line:
	Benchmarking can also be run using command line parameters from outside of the game.  	

	To run benchmarking from the command line, enter the directory where you have installed GTA IV and locate
	the executable "LaunchGTAIV.exe".  Create a shortcut to this executable on your desktop.  Right click the 
	shortcut and select "Properties".  Within the "Target" field, enter "-benchmark" at the end of the executable's 
	path. Click OK and double click the shortcut you have created to run the benchmarking utility.  
	
	Users can specify which Clip to run the benchmark utility with by adding the File ID to the end of the command line
	option. Clip files are located in My DocumentsRockstar GamesGTA IVVideosClips.  Ex. If the clip file you wish 
	to benchmark is named 081105203237.clp, enter -benchmark 081105203237 in the target field at the end of the 
	executable's path.

	Upon completion the game will exit and write the results to a file in:
	MyDocumentsRockstarGamesGTAIVBenchmarks
