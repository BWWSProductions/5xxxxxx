A blend of spirited rock spiked with a healthy dose of power pop influence, Amely has already been making their mark on the music scene, despite only forming less than a year ago. Since playing their first show in March 2009, Amely has completed three national tours, opened for All Time Low, played the Unsilent Night Festival with A Day to Remember, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and Breathe Carolina and performed on the Kevin Says Stage at the Florida dates of Vans Warped Tour 2009. Love for the band has stretched to American Samoa in the South Pacific, where the band performed in front of 8,000 people for Blue Skyâ€™s 10 Year Bash.
