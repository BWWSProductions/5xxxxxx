I don't mean to spam for sales, I just try to support any true artist who takes risks like with this album."
,peestandingup,2010-07-07T03:35Z,"Yes, guys. PLEASE support the artist by purchasing the album. It's cheap (only like $9) on iTunes. And Brandon pretty much made this all by himself in his studio, so you'll be doing him a favor."
,peestandingup,2010-07-07T03:49Z,"Oh, and also keep in mind guys that the production values on this album seem to be very low. Thats why the bass sometimes sounds all distorted & shit when you turn it up. I dont know if they did that intentionally or what, but thats the way it sounds on the store-bought album, so dont chalk it up to a bad rip on my part. Thats just how it sounds."
,JustMatt,2010-07-07T09:04Z,Do you know where I can find some details about this album. It sort of snuck up on me and came out suddenly. I can't really find much info on it. But yeah I also heard that Brandon recorded nearly every track on the album himself. If that is true this is an incredible album. It takes a certain type of person to be that completely honest and open.
,tatatoto1,2010-07-23T22:55Z,"Yeah, it's supposed to sound the way it does, and it has less to do with the fact that Brandon recorded much of it himself, and more to do with the fact that the distorted sound was his intention. I know the mastering engineer who worked on the album, and he helped enhance that gritty sound. Call it creative license, I guess. "
