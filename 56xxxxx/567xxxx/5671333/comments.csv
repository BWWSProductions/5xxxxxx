,fuctup.rm,2010-09-04T08:09Z,"Very good quality, except for two lock-ups that require you to close the player, reopen, and skip past - otherwise audio track disappears."

,Saki33,2010-11-13T18:21Z,"Excellent quality, downloaded fast,and thanks for that. The Eng subs work when played on computer with VLC, but not when portable hard drive is plugged into tv. I intended to watch on tv, so that means I would have to find compatible subs for the Eng, but that wouldn't work because it would double up on the embedded subs. I could edit the subs to remove those parts but way too much trouble. Doesn't work for me. Pity."
,wind_highlander,2011-01-15T07:38Z,How are the subtitles for the entire movie optional? I see english subs during the whole movie and I can't take the off.
,PI0XMATE,2011-01-16T01:35Z,Man this quality is OUTSTANDING on my widescreen TV ... Thanks a lot and keep it up!
