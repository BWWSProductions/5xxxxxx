,mjnrocks,2010-07-06T10:26Z,"Thanx 4 the up..but... could someone repack this into smaller torrents for those of us with limited D/L capabilities? - I'd love some of Demi; but cant handle 1.6 GB.
I'm assuming I need to D/L all the .RAR's for them to resegment & form a useable archive? Cheers"
,Normsky,2010-07-06T20:46Z,"You can unpack individual files from each individual rar providing any individual file doesn't span the gap between two consecutive rars.

If that makes sense. Plus I can't be arsed re-seeding it."
