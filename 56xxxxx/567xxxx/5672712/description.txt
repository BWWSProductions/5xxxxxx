layouts are included. All languages have been removed apart 
from United Kingdom. The default Luna theme has been removed, 
but this edition includes the XP Amp theme as default. 

Most of the networking features are removed from this edition, 
this is because this edition is intended as a gaming edition 
that you can surf the internet with. It is NOT intended as an 
operating system for use in a corporate environment to squeeze 
a little bit more production out of the poor employees, however, 
MS Mail and MAPI are included for compatibility. Also kept - 16Bit 
Support, Disk Cleanup, the "core" of Internet Explorer, Task 
Scheduler and you are still able to open ZIP files without the
