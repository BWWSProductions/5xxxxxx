S01E01 - Gorgonzola / Cave Ripened Tallegio

Under the spot light in this episode is Gorgonzola, the grandaddy of all European 

blue cheeses made from cows milk and its cousin cave ripened Tallegio, which 

until recently was one of Italyâ€™s great soft cheese secrets. Cheese authority 

Will Studd travels to Northern Italy to see how and where these fascinating 

cheeses are created. He visits Lombardy, and the maze of underground cellars in 

the town of Novara where more than 70% of Gorgonzola is matured. Then itâ€™s off to 

the foothills of the Alps where caves cooled by melting snow are still used to 

ripen Tallegio the old fashioned way by the Mauri family.
