Music by Stephen Warbeck
Directed by Jane Morgan
Broadcast January 2, 1993
Coded from tape at 128/4.1
Missing opening credits and first few minutes

'Jack And The Beanstalk' for adults.

Or, maybe,

'Jack And The Beanstalk' complete with medieval
superstition and search for Jack's father.

The missing bit does not detract from the story.
