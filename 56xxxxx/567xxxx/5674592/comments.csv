I'd download it but there are no seeders :(."
,andrew6001,2010-07-07T06:25Z,"Sorry, my first ever torrent.  It took me about 30 minutes to figure out the arcane set of steps needed to get uTorrent to seed.  Why there isnt a simple menu item for ""Seed this torr"" is beyond me.

Anyway, I am seeding, and there is a second seeder now too."
,piritfan,2010-07-11T22:51Z,seed this please
,andywank,2010-07-16T14:58Z,"Yes please, we could really use some seeders for this again."
,andrew6001,2010-07-30T19:21Z,I dont know why TPB says there are no seeds.  I am seeding and have been all along. Another TPB bug?
