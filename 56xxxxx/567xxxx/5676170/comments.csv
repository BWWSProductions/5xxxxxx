,DanWare,2010-07-07T22:10Z,Where did the seeders go...?  Now theres only 91% of it left!
,Roflsox,2010-07-08T02:54Z,"3 hours in, average speed 44.7kbs, sigh.. Seed please guys."
,inflikkt,2010-07-08T05:09Z,any comments on if this is legit/working?  ive been dling for a few hours now but its red and slow.  seems fishy
,envisaged0ne,2010-07-08T06:39Z,It doesn't do anything when I try to run the setup.exe.  And Mcafee detects a virus in the skidrow folder
,masterfaster2,2010-07-08T07:48Z,"First, the uploader is a VIP member (green skull).

Second, this is the original scene release. If you believe your antivirus, then why don't you buy the game?

Cracks/keygens/patches, all appear to have virus in all antivirus and antispyware programs. This is normal. How do you expect the companies to deal with piracy?

Thus, if you have any doubts buy the game. At least this game is worthy. Else stop complaining and nagging like a kid.

Enjoy an excellent game."
,envisaged0ne,2010-07-08T07:59Z,"Ok masterfaster2, you're going on a tyrade about my observations.  I stated what I observed.  You're the one acting like a kid with a childish response.  So watch who's ""complaining and nagging"".  By all means, if you've managed to get the game to play, then simply state a mature response as to such.  If you're capable of that.  "
,Roflsox,2010-07-08T20:06Z,"I can\'t make it work. It installs fine and I copied all the files over from the skidrow folder but when I launch it I get a black screen followed by \""this program is not responding\"".nnany help?"
,DanWare,2010-07-08T20:13Z,"Indeed it doesn\'t work.  No viruses however.nnEncountered a problem and needs to close - \""send Microsoft error report\"" dialogue box.nnSkidrow are one of the best, they were first to release it but the crack just doesn\'t work - tried on two different rigs."
,DanWare,2010-07-08T20:16Z,"BTW - it does install OK, the ISO seems fine it\'s just the crack that doesnt work"
,DanWare,2010-07-08T20:25Z,"MY MISTAKE - I ran the DirectX installer from the install directory and it works fine.  I only updated DirectX a few days ago, but there ya go...  It\'s all good."
,Roflsox,2010-07-08T21:50Z,"Thanks Danware, installing the directx included in the game fixed it, seems to work fine now. Odd because I also have the latest directx.."
,dekiai,2010-07-08T21:51Z,the game works but the audio is missing. is there a way to fix this?
,envisaged0ne,2010-07-09T03:10Z,"I did finally get it to work.  I had to wait for over 2 minutes for the installer to come up.  At 1st it gave me the \""send microsoft error report\"".  But I logged off and back on to Windows, tried it again.  Waited forever for the installer to come up, but it went smoothly after that.    The game runs just fine."
,masterfaster2,2010-07-09T09:28Z,"@envisaged0ne, I may was a bit ruff, sorry. But I got a point: as you can see the release doesn\'t have any virus. Almost all cracks/patches/keygens will make your antivirus go crazy. (That\'s an anti-piracy measure that companies took).nnnAbout the installation and game launching problems, that I cannot criticize. Because, in the distant past I was an inexperienced user.nnSuggestion: Always download and install the latest DirectX redistributable full installer (not the web installer). And make sure you have the latest drivers for your GPU. It is also advisable to install .NET Framework (3.5 and 4.0), vcredist installers (2005, 2008 and 2010).nGoogle.com is there to search information about system hardware and software requirements for each game."
,bonkeman,2010-07-09T11:08Z,This is far better than the Special Edition of Monkey Island 1. The interface is great and the inventory menu is easier to access!

,drjohnballs,2011-01-09T16:54Z,"i had a problem with the screen flashing black and then quitting back to windows (win7 64bit) as soon as i ran it, even after installing it and the crack correctly. I ran the game with ""Disable display scaling..."" ticked in the properties -> compatibility tab and it works great now. hope it helps some of you!"
