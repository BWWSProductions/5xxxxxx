,JackMack10,2010-07-06T17:50Z,thanks mate always knew you could do it ! 
,Dr.mabra,2010-07-06T18:09Z,Dude your the best :)
,SnakeHe,2010-07-06T18:23Z,"Why does Dragon age downloadable content say this DLC is 710 mb, and here it's 529mb? What's going on?"
,dANGER_boy,2010-07-06T18:35Z,"@SnakeHe
Thanks for the heads up.  I will look into this but my initial reaction is that they are showing you the total size of the uncompressed files.  Rememeber, these files are DAZIPs, essentially glorified zip archives.  They are compressed initially and must be decompressed by daupdater.exe.

I personally have installed this DLC using these exact same DAZIPs and tested it out for the first few minutes.  If anybody notices any problems, please alert me and I will fix them as soon as I can."
,dANGER_boy,2010-07-06T18:45Z,"I have not verified this either, but another potential piece of the puzzle is that the decryption process might increase file size as it alters encrypted files.  Once again, I haven't verified this and I won't unless a problem arises.  If people are unable to complete the campaign or access the new, unique armor, I will look into it further."
,Frosty676,2010-07-06T19:09Z,"Hi. 
Dangerboy is there a way to not have to delete and reinstall awakening +load of dlc) if i got the install error?"
,dANGER_boy,2010-07-06T19:13Z,"@Frosty676
Not that I know of, no.  Sorry!  This is a big inconvenience to me too when the error crops up.  Your best bet in the future would be to make a backup of your AddIns.xml after succcesful installation of Awakening/DLC and store it in a safe place.  I haven't found a way around it yet but maybe you can.  Like I said, sorry."
,SurvivoRR,2010-07-06T19:22Z,Install done but doesnt work for me.... Cannot load the module and its still in the downloadable contents.
,Bucifer,2010-07-06T19:38Z,"copy your addins and delete it from the dragon age folder , install the DLC , open the new addins , copy all the lines from this dlc paste em in the addins that you copied earlier then move it back to your folder .I corrupted my addins a few months back and this is how i install addons every time ."
,plshelp,2010-07-06T20:31Z,I'm getting the xml error while installing and i cant reinstall awakening as i dont have the files. Can someone please paste the content of their addins.xml and manifest.xml so i can correct mines?

,adler1984,2010-07-06T20:56Z,"to all people who has problem with addins.xml

go to http://www.dragonagenexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=277 and download Dragon Age ModManager.

Start it and it will say that addins.xml is broken and it will ask you should it repair it, click yes and you don't have to reinstall Origins and Awakening."
,adler1984,2010-07-06T20:58Z,"Oh forgot to say, when modmanager repairs broken file, install Lelianas Song again and it should work. At least it did for me."
,Frosty676,2010-07-06T21:05Z,"@adler1984
Now you're talking! Thanks for the heads up mate.
@Dangerboy
Thanks for dlc all of it, keep em coming) "
,Soverign,2010-07-06T21:06Z,Thanks from Turkey.
,capf,2010-07-06T21:32Z,"Hello, having a slight problem here.
Installed the DAZIPs with daoupdater, everything worked fine, went and fixed the addins.xml etc.
I start up DAO and check the downloadable content tab and everything looks fine, all addons enabled.
BUT when I do try to start Leliana's Song from the ""Other Campaigns"" tab, it starts to load and after a little while I get ""daorigins.exe has stopped working"".
This is a little bit annoying, so any tips would be appriciated.

Anyways, thanks for this and your other uploads dANGER_boy! 
This is the first one that has cause me any kind of grief.
Thanks in advance from Sweden!"
,Frosty676,2010-07-06T21:48Z,"@capf
Mayhaps you forgot to decrypt?"
,adler1984,2010-07-06T21:59Z,"@capf

Try like this install Leliana's song, run decrypt, change all RequiresAuthorization = 1, from 1 to 0.
Then try to run it.

If its addins.xml is broken repair it with modmanager, then try again.

If not after repair change RequiresAuthorization values to 0 and try."
,capf,2010-07-06T22:16Z,"@Frosty676
I ran the decrypt after installing the DAZIPs.

@adler1984
I did exactly that.
addins.xml isn't broken, I assume as much since every other DLC is working.
And yeah, every single RequiresAuthorization value is at 0, including Leliana's Song.

Still the game crashes after a few seconds when I try to start Leliana's Song.
Whats wierd is that everything else works, all other DLCs, Origins and Awakening runs perfectly.

Thanks anyways though, I'll continue trying stuff and post it if I find a solution incase someone else has the same issue."
,Vennuska,2010-07-06T22:27Z,"I did everything as said and there is Leliana's song in downloadable content, but when going to Other campaigns and clicking on Lelianas Song and then Play, it starts to load and then goes back to main page and says Unable to load content. Any help please??? "
,Vennuska,2010-07-06T22:29Z,"Sorry, it says Unable to load Module. "
,capf,2010-07-06T23:06Z,"@Vennuska
Try running the decrypter again, that can happen if the addon is being recoginzied properly."
,capf,2010-07-06T23:07Z,isn't* being recognized properly.
,prismaticsmiley,2010-07-07T01:52Z,That was... fast! Thanks! I'm definitely getting this one. :D
,capf,2010-07-07T03:22Z,"After some time and thinking I found a solution for my problem with this addon.
I tell you it was amazingly hard to finally get this to work.
I reinstalled it, ran the decrypt again and changed the values of ""RequiresAuthorization"" in the addins.xml to 0 instead of 1.
And what do you know, it suddenly works like a charm. 
I figure it must have been some invisible error the first time I installed it wich just didn't happen the second time around.

So if anyone else is getting a ""daorigins.exe"" error when trying to start Leliana's Song, just try reinstalling it and following the steps in the readme.

My eternal grattitude to  dANGER_boy for this and his other uploads, keep on cracking bro! ;)"
,dANGER_boy,2010-07-07T03:46Z,"That's weird that you guys are having some issues with the module being unable to load.  Worked fine for me.  I would recommend, as has been mentioned earlier, that you start using DAModder to install DAZIPS.  For some reason this seems to reduce the amount of installation problems people are running into.

Enjoy and seed away mateys!"
,elven-archer,2010-07-07T05:36Z,Dude you still include thepiratebay in your list of trackers!
,prismaticsmiley,2010-07-07T06:43Z,"Tried it the first time and I encountered errors during the dazips installation. After that, I did what was written in the README- deleted the addins and manifest xml, and reinstalled whatever DLCs I had previously. The second time I tried installing Leliana's song, everything worked fine already. :)

Thanks again! dANGER_boy, you are amazing."
,dANGER_boy,2010-07-07T07:03Z,"@elven-archer
Nope, I don't include it.  TPB must automatically put it in when you upload a torrent.  I only include PublicBitTorrent and OpenBitTorrent in any of my torrents."
,Fallerup,2010-07-07T09:00Z,"had the error when trying to install, followed the guide here and it worked like a charm, how ever, as you explained, every other DLC + Awakening is gone :( Oh well, it doesn't really bother me all that much, I've completed them all anyway, how ever the new character stuff I never got to try out :( a mod that changes the appearance of your companions and npc ... I gotta reinstall that I try playing it again :)"
,dANGER_boy,2010-07-07T10:06Z,"@All those with installation errors...ATTENTION!!
I finally think I pinpointed the problem and have a solution without having to reinstall all your DLC.

***PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY

When editting the AddIns.xml to change the RequiresAuthorization flag to 0, I think the encoding of the xml is sometimes being changed behind our backs to ANSI.  The encoding should normally be set to UTF-8, as can be seen in the header of the AddIns.xml.  If you are getting an installation error, follow these directions precisely.

1. Make a copy of your corrupted AddIns.xml to somewhere on your computer.
2. Delete the original AddIns.xml AND Manifest.xml
3. Open up Notepad and copy/paste everything from your backup AddIns.xml to this blank file.
4. Click ""File"" and then click ""Save As...""
5. For filename, put in ""AddIns.xml"", without the quotes.
6. In the box ""Save as type"", change this from text document (*.txt) to ""All Files""
7. Make sure that the box titled ""Encoding"" is set to UTF-8.
8. Save this where the original was located.
9. Start up your game.  This should fix all problems!

NOTE: For you that don't need these intricate instructions, you might simply shortcut all this work by opening the original, corrupted AddIns.xml and doing a ""Save As..."", making sure the encoding is set to UTF-8 and overwriting itself.

Hope this helps!"
,dANGER_boy,2010-07-07T10:10Z,"As an addendum to my previous post, all your DLC prior to your failed installation attempt should be visible and properly recognized by the game.  Now, try installing the new DAZIPs.  Hopefully, now that the encoding has been properly set on AddIns.xml, the daupdater.exe program should be able to properly read and modify the AddIns.xml.

Cheers mateys!"
,ShepardM,2010-07-07T13:19Z,"""backup AddIns.xml""? where is the backup?"
,dANGER_boy,2010-07-07T14:58Z,"@ShepardM
That would be the copy that you made in step #1 and saved in a seperate place on your computer..."

,Rhiyo,2010-07-24T06:16Z,"Not sure if it's this DLC or one from the DLC pack you released (I installed all the DAZIPS at the same time) but when Installing the DAZIPs the updater said one or two of them were out of date and told me to download the newer ones from dragonage.com.
