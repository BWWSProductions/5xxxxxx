All four fantastic albums by Alternative band Fetchin Bones... just in time for summer! Both Cabin Flounder and Galaxy 500 come with the bonus tracks released on the CD versions of the albums. Bad Pumpkin is a vinyl rip, which is apparently what they have been putting up in all online stores (lazy bastards). Oh well, it's a damn good album and a better than average rip to say the least. If your a fan of either King's X, Pearl Jam or any of those other asshole from the mid 80s/early 90s then you're in for a real treat. Michael Stipe was a real big fan of these fellers if that tells you anything. But probably not.
