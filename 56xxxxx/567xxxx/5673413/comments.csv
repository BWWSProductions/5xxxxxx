,lonebard,2010-07-07T23:15Z,What the hell is going on? The entire O&A/RonFez network is falling apart.
,nickcazzo,2010-07-07T23:37Z,"The boys will be back on July 12. They took vacation this week and last friday. I, too would love to hear the worst of's from this week. I listen on XM 202, but I only listen 1 hour per day. Anybody know what software I would need to record O&A live. Also does anyone know where to pick up a stream opf the show (other than paying). I only listen to O&A and it runs me $15.00/ month with tax and fees."

,ihatereading369,2010-07-08T05:02Z,"So assuming you didn't answer my question, I guess you're not planning on uploading this weeks Worst Of shows? :("
,lonebard,2010-07-09T00:29Z,Oh my mistake. I was expecting Ron & Fez this week! I thought Ron was joking around about taking the week off since Fez kept saying they were back on Tuesday.
