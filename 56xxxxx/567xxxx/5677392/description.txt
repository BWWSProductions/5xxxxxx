Release Notes:
Nice to see a r5 of this movie....right made a script for the dvd9 including slight denoise filter, and sharpness filter
and some RGB Editting filter, save script and loaded into vdub, then used 1 or 2 filters out of vdub for some other
alterations like saturation gamma etc. Used and brightness filter as it seemed quite dark in some areas of the movie.
synced imagines audio to the video, took quite a while all of 30minutes :P...anyway, includes all the credits and no
url on the video. Enjoy
