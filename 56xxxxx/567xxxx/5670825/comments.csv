If you have the first time a black screen, go to ""shift exe""and click properties.
Change compatability to win 98. 
Now it's working........."

,Simanji,2010-09-29T05:49Z,"Works well on Windows 7! But when starting the career mode, the initial video keeps looping and looping... even 3 or 4 times before starting the real career. Anyone knows why?"
,Simanji,2010-09-29T06:03Z,"Forget what I said: After looping three times the intro video, the race begins. Runs ""well"" for some seconds, then crashes. Not the car, the entire game. hahaha thank you anyway for uploading, I'll try another one"

,gvndual,2010-10-07T02:38Z,"Ok, got the file mounted via poweriso, got it installed (I'm pretty sure), tried to start the game and got a ""Wrong disc inserted. Please insert the correct CD/DVD and retry."" How do I fix this?"
,ACS.Enter,2010-10-07T16:13Z,"Did you crack it?

-> You have to open the image-file with a program called virtual clone drive. Get it here: http://www.chip.de/downloads/Virtual-CloneDrive_13012545.html 
After installation create one ""virtual clone drive"" . 
Now you can install NFS. Open the image by right-clicking it and say ""load image"" and select your virtual drive. Now you just have to install NFS by following the installation. After that you have to crack it by opening the image again using VCD and copy the content from the folder ""crack"" to your NFS main directory. (copy the data from inside the folder ""CRACK"" to: C:\programs/ElectronicArts/NeedForSpeedShift/ )

-while installation you may have to enter a serial. They are in a .txt-file.

Did you try Compatibility Mode with WinXp. Be sure you do.

Also check if you copied .bin data to NFS directory.

If problem is still there, check your .dll's at http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_41.

Hope i could help.

,Kyouma,2010-10-08T02:43Z,"Thank you very much. Worked flawlessly. Great torrent, and I greatly recommend. I have been looking for a good NFS Shift torrent for the longest time.

For some people having a problem, remember that there is a crack file included inside the .iso.

Works with Windows 7 x32."
