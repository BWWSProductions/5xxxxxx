,SeamWeld,2010-07-29T21:07Z,"Thanks for the upload. I'm having a problem finding the OCMStart or clientOCMStart though. There is no file by that name anywhere in this release as far as I can tell.

When extracting the Laptops and Printer section, for example, it tells me I need...\SkillSoft.CompTIA.A.Plus.Essentials.2009.Edition.Expert.Encore\SkillSoft.Course.CompTIA.A.Plus.Essentials.2009.Configuring.Displays.Peripherals.Laptops.and.Printers.v1.3-RBS\r-apet2i.r00......and a Diag message comes up telling me the ""Total path and file name lenght must not exceed 260 characters"". This happens for every folder."
,SeamWeld,2010-07-29T21:08Z,"That was supposed to read ""There is no file by that name anywhere in this release as far as I can tell."""
[V],J.R.Dobbs,2011-01-24T03:14Z,Hi SeamWeld. Not sure why it's not working for you. Did you both unzip and unrar the files?
,bak2frnt,2011-06-16T08:45Z,loved the upload. I can really use this stuff. Im having trouble with some of your other Skillsoft downloads not connecting.
