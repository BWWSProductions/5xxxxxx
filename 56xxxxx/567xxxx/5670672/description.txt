RELEASE INFO

The KeepTool 9 family gathers together three Oracle productivity
tools, each addressing a specific purpose and available
separately. But each of the three products -  Hora, ER Diagrammer
und PL/SQL Debugger - is also designed to work with the other
two, and shares a common design philosophy.

Our goal is to make our products easy and intuitive to use.
KeepTool 9 is updated many times each year to enhance its
existing functionality and to incorporate new features of the
Oracle database.
