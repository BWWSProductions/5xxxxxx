First torrent. Hope someone likes it.  

I was unable to find any other collection of just Watkins Glen soundboards (Friday, July 27-28, 1973) and figured I'd convert some of the source files from the differenent sets from each day on more obscure sites into MP3s.  

The Friday set (the Mother of All Soundchecks) has had great reviews. The Saturday set is also good, and includes three songs as encores with the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers and The Band all on stage together.

Note: This set of files was converted from the lossless FLAC format found here:

The bt.etree.org community is a bit torrent site for sharing of lossless files of open artists, is certainly worth checking out.

All source documents that trace the conversion of the various files are included. Some started out as soundboard files, some as FM radio broadcasts, etc...but all were in FLAC when I found them. Artwork and other data is not my work, but creditis included.
