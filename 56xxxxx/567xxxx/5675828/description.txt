Ed Decter (who co-wrote There's Something About Mary) directs this teen comedy centered on the exploits of a grade-A high school loser (DJ Qualls) who assumes another identity at a new school to infiltrate a group of popular kids. Using the tried-and-true moves he learned from a convict (Eddie Griffin), he scores the affections of a hot cheerleader (Eliza Dushku). But how long can he carry on the ruse? Zooey Deschanel co-stars.
