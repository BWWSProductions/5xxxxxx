Battlefield Mysteries: 'The Lost Graves of the International Brigades'

"In 1939, the Fascists won the bloody Spanish Civil War â€“ a vicious struggle of ideologies that drew combatants from across the globe. With history written by the victors, the Fascists wiped out any trace of their rivals â€“ over a quarter of a million people. In this episode we return to present day Spain on a quest to uncover the Lost Graves of the International Brigades."
