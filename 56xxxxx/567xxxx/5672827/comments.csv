I used MakeMKV (v1.6.16 available here at TPB) to create an MKV file. Very easy to do, just drag the file to MakeMKV, that's it! Removed 1 sub with MKVMerge. My final file: 7.42GB, 1920*1080, DTS. Excellent quality, a little bit of a hassle because of the .iso, but, you end up with a great, quality, mkv.  Great Upload, 'Anonymous'!"
