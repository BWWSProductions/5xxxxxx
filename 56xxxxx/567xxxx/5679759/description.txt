I torrented zeppfan1968's Rush Discography and converted it from FLAC to MP3... I thought maybe people would like it if i made an MP3 torrent of it so they can upload it onto their IPods and MP3 players so, yea. Everything is MP3 at 320kb\s + album artwork and you can see the rest for yourself. Really, if zeppfan1968 hadn't created his torrent none of this would have ever happened so don't thank me, thank zeppfan1968.


P.S. song #4 of the album Grace Under Pressure (The Enemy Within) doesn't work, so i'm sorry. but if you really want to you can find it somewhere on the internet, i'm certain of it.
