"Alejandro" is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga. It is the third single from her second studio album, The Fame Monster (2009). Co-written and produced by RedOne, it is composed as a mid-tempo Europop song with an uplifting melody, where Gaga sings in a non-English accent about bidding farewell to her lovers. It was inspired by Gaga's "Fear of Sex Monster". Critics noted it to be heavily influenced by ABBA and Ace of Base, and predominantly gave positive reviews for it.

"Alejandro" charted on the UK Singles Chart prior to its official release, and reached the top-five on the Hungarian Singles Chart due to download sales from the album. It has also charted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Statesâ€”where it became her seventh successive single to reach the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100. Gaga performed the song on both legs of The Monster Ball Tour, portraying a sexual innuendo scene with her dancers. The song was also performed on the ninth season of American Idol on May 5, 2010.

A music video for the single, which was directed by photographer Steven Klein, was released on June 8, 2010. It was inspired by Gaga's love for her gay friends and admiration of gay loveâ€”"her envy of the courage and bravery they require to be together". The music video portrays Gaga with a group of soldiers in a cabaret, dancing to the song. It is interspersed with scenes of Gaga as a nun swallowing a rosary and near-naked men, holding machine guns. The music video received from mixed to positive reviews, with critics complimenting its idea and dark nature, while the Catholic League attacked Gaga for her use of blasphemy, despite Klein dismissing the idea and claiming the scene in question (the swallowing of the Rosary beads) was Gaga's "desire to take in the Holy".
