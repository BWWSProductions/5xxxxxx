Please remember not to hit and run, seed for your fellow pirates. Commenting about quality for your fellow downloaders lets people sort trash from gold. (not to mention it gives the uploader a boner!!)

Next upload will be disc 2 of season 1 of Chapelle's Show. Any subsequent DVDR uploads will be announced in a week. Stay tuned and enjoy.
