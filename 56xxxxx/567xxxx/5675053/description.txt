   Â³Â²Â³Ã  
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  Gregoire is a happily wedded father of three young girls,
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  an independent film producer who somehow manages to juggle
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  the never-ending demands of his company with his domestic
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  responsibilities. Married to his cellphone and chain-smoking
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  his way through endless rounds of meetings and crises, he
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  maintains his sense of humour despite incessant demands from
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  the difficult Swedish auteur he has always wanted to produce
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  and the arrival of a group from Korea doing preproduction
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  work on a new film. In addition to massaging artistic egos,
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  his job involves trying to keep one step ahead of his bank
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  and financing is always an interminable headache. When his
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  wife, Sylvia, insists that he join the family on an Italian
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  holiday, Gregoire finds he can no longer maintain any sane
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  balance. Returning to Paris, he confronts the biggest 
   Â³Â²Â³Ã  challenge of his career â€“ with unexpected consequences.
