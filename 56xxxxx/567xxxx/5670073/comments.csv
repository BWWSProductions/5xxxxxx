,Highpitchsolo,2010-08-15T08:27Z,"Game has to be launched from alternate .dol to work.. (in neogamma go to config options, change the ""alternate .dol"" option to DISC, then when you select LOAD DVD, go down and change the main.dol to game.dol). kind of annoying. when i converted it using the program in the description, i left that .txt file in the folder (i didnt delete it) im not sure if it needed to be there to convert properly, so leave it there just in case."
