About this game:
It's June 6th, 1944, and the war is in your hands. Step into the boots of OSS Operative John Berg and infiltrate Normandy from behind enemy lines to undermine the Nazi regime.Choose to tackle all-new missions in traditional single player campaign or engage in massive, 32-player online, continuous-joining multiplayer battles where you can jump into the battle at any time. In addition to a full-fledged single player campaign, Medal of Honor Heroes 2 also features an all-new mode designed specifically for the Wii that simplifies gameplay for players of all skills levels for easy pick-up-and-play action. This mode plays like an old-school rail shooter â€” the Wii moves you around, while you do your partâ€”taking enemies out and achieving objectives. The Wii version also features full support of the Wii Zapper (name not final), allowing for a more immersive WWII action than ever.
NOTE: The Australian PAL release that I had uploaded previously did not include multiplayer/online mode so I am uploading this NTSC release that does ;)  


NOTE: To play this game you need a chipped or soft modded Wii.
