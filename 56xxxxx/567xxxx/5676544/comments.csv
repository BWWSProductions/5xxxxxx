,mcthom,2010-07-28T17:31Z,"Mike, if you're still there.. I recently discovered your torrents so I came too late to the party to dl your torrents when they were freshly seeded.

One of the films I'm interested in is Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Arc. I've been stuck at 99.0 percent for ages now.

If you can get me the last remaining percent, I will seed the entire thing for 2 weeks so the thing can be alive and kicking again.

I also want to extend my request for seeding this for a bit to anyone else who managed to dl it earlier. "
