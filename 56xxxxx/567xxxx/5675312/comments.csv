,dantis1,2010-08-14T10:27Z,"FYI if you play this in VLC, when the audio goes out of sync just adjust it as follows:
click 'tools', then 'preferences', then at the bottom left-hand side change 'show settings' to 'all', then 'audio', you can now advance or retard the audio over video where it says 'audio desynchronisation compensation'.  You can change it in miliseconds + or -  I have used this a few times and it will bring the movie back into sync.  You will need to play around with the timings until you get it right though.  Good luck."

Movie almost turned me gay though, and I'm pretty sure that Ashton was wearing too much cover up for all his weird look at me, I tweeze my eyebrows, headshots.

Not a new record for turning off a movie, but I made it 17 minutes in before figuring out that this is a chick flick.

Fuckin' Ashton."
