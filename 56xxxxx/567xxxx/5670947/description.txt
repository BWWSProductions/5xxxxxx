Neil Pearson narrates a documentary telling the story of Matt Monro, the 
young Londoner born Terry Parsons who became one of the world's most popular 
ballad singers. Contributors include Paul Gambaccini, Don Black, George Martin, 
John Barry and Monro's family.


Matt Monro (1 December 1930 â€“ 7 February 1985) was an English singer who
became one of the most popular entertainers on the international music scene
during the 1960s. Throughout his 30-year career, he filled cabarets, nightclubs,
music halls, and stadiums in Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong
to Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. He sold more than 100
million records during his lifetime.

He was born Terence Edward Parsons in Shoreditch, London and attended
Duncombe School in Islington. Affectionately nicknamed "the singing bus
driver" (because one of his many occupations prior to achieving fame was
driving the Number 27 bus from Highgate to Teddington) he got his first break
in 1956 when he became a featured vocalist with the BBC Show Band. An
important influence on his early career was the pianist Winifred Atwell, who
became his mentor, provided him with his stage name, and helped him sign
with Decca Records.

In 1957 Monro released Blue and Sentimental, a collection of standards.
Despite the album's critical acclaim, Monro languished among the young male
singers trying to break through at the end of the 1950s, many of them emulating
Frankie Vaughan by recording cover versions of American hits. (Monro even
recorded a version of Vaughan's "Garden of Eden" during this period.) A short
recording contract with Fontana Records followed.

By the end of the 1950s, Monro's mid-decade fame had evaporated, and he
returned to relative obscurity. He and his wife Mickie lived from her wages as a
song plugger and his royalties from a TV advertising jingle for Camay soap. In
1959 he recorded a country pastiche song, "Bound for Texas", for The Chaplin
Revue, a feature-length compilation of Charlie Chaplin shorts. It would be the
first of many Monro soundtrack themes.
