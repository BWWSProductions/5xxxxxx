,-Leto-,2010-07-07T16:44Z,"DVD-like quality, thanks :)"
[V],Kuthumi,2010-07-07T16:46Z,"Sorry, I must modify my previous statement. The sound in the rest of the movie is not really ""good stereo"", but still much better than most R5 rips."
,SDWILLIA,2010-07-07T17:16Z,"Why is it, all of a sudden, all of my downloads from Piratebay are giving me malicious threats???  I'm getting them all from ""reputable"" uploaders.  I don't get it.  The past 2 days have been hell."
,bluedev,2010-07-07T18:52Z,"Really good Quality, Video 8, Audio 7 with some parts better than others. Still -23 quality is retarded, those who voted probably didn't even watch the movie."
