[V],polisdavid,2010-07-07T07:02Z,THANK YOU AGAIN SEEDERS!!  ;~)
[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-07-07T11:02Z,Nice one Polis. Thanks a million.
[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-07-07T14:25Z,"Just one question... maybe I'm being thick, but the keygen keeps telling me my installation ID is invalid."
,bobbyphoto2,2010-07-07T21:51Z,Is there something wrong with this torrent?  I have been waiting for hours and not one byte has been downloaded.  All my other torrent downloads are working and there appears to be mostly seeders with few leachers.
[V],polisdavid,2010-07-08T01:02Z,"NoggintheNomad,

The keygen was written by CORE - you may want to download from Mac-Torrents and try again....Worked for me..

The tracker does seem to be down, so I added http://tracker.publicbc.com:80/announce , and it seemed to spring to life"
[V],polisdavid,2010-07-08T01:07Z,"Sorry bobbyphoto2,

it's http://tracker.publicbc.com:80/announce I added"
[V],polisdavid,2010-07-08T01:10Z,"Sorry again bobbyphoto2,

It's http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce"
,bobbyphoto2,2010-07-08T02:08Z,"polisdavid,  I tried your last link, but all I got was ""not valid.""  The download still does not work.  Any other suggestions?  Thanks."
,bobbyphoto2,2010-07-08T02:19Z,For what it is worth--I tried a different computer and web browser and the file began to download right away.  Thank you for this application.
,bobbyphoto2,2010-07-08T03:53Z,"This keygen seems strange.  I have generated about ten serials but none of them will work when inserted into alien skins activation section for Exposure 3.  There is a installation ID that I have no idea how that is generated, but this would seem to generate an unlock code.  Is there some sort of way to get the installation ID?"
,bobbyphoto2,2010-07-08T04:25Z,"This is hopefully my last post on this one for those of you having trouble with the keygen.
First-install Alien Skin 3 in appropriate plug-in folders in photoshop etc.
2-generate the serial in the keygen and double click on it to copy to the clipboard.  Then paste the serial in Alien Skin 3 when you run the program in photoshop.
3-Then go to manual activate section (do not press activate) so that an instillation ID is generated and copy into the keygen.
4-This generates an unlock code that can be copied into the program and then click activate."
[V],polisdavid,2010-07-08T05:55Z,Thanks for the fix bobbyphoto2!
,jaunelis,2010-08-08T22:35Z,I guess i'm not the only one having this problem: the instalation ID is missing/not being generated. Tried reinstalling the app but it won't help. Anybody know how to solve this?
,feiknik,2010-10-08T15:42Z,Hey! What is the password for the keygen? :D Thanks!
,darkbyke,2010-11-08T01:41Z,Any chance for PC version?  
,ojaideadhead,2011-01-20T03:10Z,I love Alien Skin 2 and bought it after trying it out. I;m sure this will be the same. Thanks alot.
,VR,2011-01-30T05:06Z,"Thanks for this I was missing this one.
BTW bobbyphoto2 is right, there is nothing wrong the installation it's a little tricky  (different) than what we're used to. Follow his instructions, I had to do the same steps when I got Alien Skin Bokeh 2.
Remember step three is where it get confusing so pay attention."
,GnarShredBrah,2011-02-02T16:47Z,Please put up a pc version if you can.
,jamieclayton,2011-02-02T23:12Z,"Hey! can you go into more detail about step 3? 

i cant find the manual activate section. "
,chicapeligrosa,2011-02-18T07:57Z,"@jamieclayton 
1. open a PSD photoshop file
2. FILTER > ALIEN SKIN EXPOSURE 3 > COLOR FILM
3. go to QUESTION MARK button at top of bar next to ORIGINAL of ALIEN SKIN VIEWER WINDOW
4.  click ACTIVATE

and follow directions from @bobbyphoto2 to find INSTALLATION ID.  "
,Malayac,2011-03-17T00:03Z,"Can't mount those dmg files with MagicISO :(((
Any tip?"
,Malayac,2011-03-17T00:17Z,Anyone have problem to mount this dmg files?
,rocu2,2011-03-30T00:46Z,I'm dying to find this in a PC version...
,escobar2203,2011-04-25T15:16Z,"Hi!
I am experiencing the same problem as NoggintheNomad. Keygen sais my installation ID is inualid. Cant find another keygen on mactorrents though. Does anyone have a link for a different keygen. Thanks in advance.
Happy Easter everyone :)"
,fenrisnz,2011-05-07T04:30Z,"I have followed the instructions, they make sense, however when I copy the installation ID that Alien Skin generates into the Keygen it gives me the error message ""Invalid ID"".  I have re-generated and entered new serial numbers and entered the appropriate Installation ID several times but always with the same results.  Anybody got any suggestions?"

Step #2 did not happen for me. I was never asked for a serial number. I got an installation ID from the ""About"" page and inserted that into the keygen, but the resulting activation key is 4 digits less that what is required. Help? Thanks!"
,bgdb,2011-08-01T11:31Z,"Thanks to polisdavid for uploading.

The only tricky part was getting the installation ID (go to the other activation options page!!!!!) but other than that everything was smooth sailing. "
,brindille74,2011-10-04T09:56Z,"It seems that there's no more Manual Activation capable to give us an Installation ID.
After 6 monthes running AlienSkin, the security system got me after an Onyx cleaning…werd…"
,explodie7,2011-10-28T00:30Z,Any source for other Alien Skin keys?  Maybe even Topaz Labs stuff?
,illest,2011-11-10T09:03Z,Anyone have the Windows version of the CORE keygen generator? =\
,thewojtek,2011-12-19T18:49Z,Doesn't install on Lion + CS5.5. Any ideas?
,ForzaDesmo,2012-01-02T18:17Z,"Thanks polisdavid
Work well.

I have a question, i saw ""eye candy 6"" in the menu of the core keygen.
Can i activate the eye candy 6 with this core keygen ?
Because i tried, but i have the Keygen sais my installation ID is invalid.
Do you have an another core keygen for ""eye candy 6"" ?
Thks ;o)"
,thewojtek,2012-02-05T21:10Z,"OK, got a solution for keygen.
1. Remove all instances of Exposure installed, if you haven't already.
2. Set the date to February 5th, 2011 or earlier.
3. Install. In my case, I needed to run the installer a couple of times before it actually installed the plugin for CS5.5 (Apps -> Adobe Photoshop 5.1 -> Plug-ins -> Alien Skin -> Exposure)
4. Fire up Photoshop, open any picture, try to apply the Exposure.
5. Use the keygen as instructed in previous comments.
6. You can re-set the date after successful manual activation."
,elrey20,2012-03-19T19:50Z,"Ok guys, so I installed this on my Mac (Leopard 10.6) and I had the same issue babygodzilla had, but after fucking around with the activation code, if you click on the first 4 numbers you can click your left arrow and move far left, those 3 spaces were being empty, so i entered the numbers up front and then Green OKAY ˇarrow popped, so I went next. And then it said a problem occurred. THEN the program opened and I fucked with it, color, and black and white, and it didn't stop or block anything. I quit PS and reopened, tried another pic and same thing, NO PROBLEMS. So just follow the instructions from babygodzilla, and remember to fuck with the A code see if you get that too. Good Luck, guys! 

Oh, if you don't see me bitching after 31 days I guess it worked past the 29 days! So the error won't mean shit then ;)"
