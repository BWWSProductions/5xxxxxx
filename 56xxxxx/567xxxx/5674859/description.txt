Exposure brings all the creative tools of film photography to the digital world. Over 500 analog techniques and organic looks are back like cross processing, Polaroid and vintage Daguerreotype. There is careful research under the hood, but the controls are simple so you can focus on the creative choices. The result is a photo that looks like it was made by a human, not a computer.

Exposure works great with 64-bit Photoshop CS5! Exposure 3 in CS5 is over twice as fast as Exposure 2 in CS4 on the Mac. Another speed boost comes from our new progressive refinement preview system. All this makes the huge world of Exposure 3 effects easy to explore.

Exposure 3 has tight Lightroom integration that supports batch processing and does not require Photoshop. Visit our Lightroom page to learn the details.
