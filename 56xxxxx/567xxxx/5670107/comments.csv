,rippervanwinkle,2011-08-10T20:06Z,"The video track is faulty.  The video halts at 83% completion (mplayer, vlc, xine etc).  mkvextract can only extract track 1 (the h.264 video track) to 83%.  mplayer on playing it reports a read error at 83%.  This loses about 39 minutes of the movie.  The audio track is intact so if you're blind you can go ahead and enjoy the soundtrack.  For everyone else this release is a waste of time.  It's a shame because the video quality looked pretty good. Finding a high quality rip of an Indian movie which isn't some kind of idiot's fuck up is like finding a needle in a haystack.  This rip originates from DDR (Digital Desi Releasers) who care more about putting lame watermarks in the video and pointless tags in the metadata than in getting the basics done properly.

Avoid."
