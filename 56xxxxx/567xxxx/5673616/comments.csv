Thx."
,expedientist,2010-07-08T22:17Z,"@kenonyan,nnThe installer for the Overlord pack contains the game files already compressed, it can\'t get any smaller by WinRARing it. Sorry. :("
,-Seeker-,2010-07-09T01:25Z,"Guys can you help me here?IT doesn\'t work for me.I install the Aegis Pack apply the entitlement file and when i go to the game it says that the DLC doesn\'t work or something like that.I tried applying the 1.01 crack, it didn\'t work either :(.nPlease guys help me!!!"

,Severianz,2010-07-11T06:08Z,Something is wrong with the comment thing. it changes all my enter/return s into rn WTF?
,Severianz,2010-07-11T06:11Z,"@ -seeker-     If you get a \""dlc authorization failed...\"" message then make sure the game isn\'t set to login to the EA store and go check at your armor/weapon locker any way it will probably be there and work. this happened to me before. I got an error all the time but it still worked."
[T],swebarb,2010-07-31T14:36Z,"It doesnt work, it says cannot authorize and i need to buy, and the online options has alwaus been off,, any help ?`??"
,btor718,2010-08-05T02:37Z,"Maybe I'm nuts but I can't get this to work. It keeps telling me that Mass Effect 2 isn't installed.

I got the Aegis Pack from another download, installed it and all I got from it was the Incisor Sniper Rifle, but no Kestrel Armor that's also supposed to be included in the pack.

I'm going bonkers here. Any ideas??"
