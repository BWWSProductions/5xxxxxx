They have aired at least 2 more for season 5 and maybe another as well! (Episodes 9 to 11 HAVE AIRED, but are not uploaded for unknown reasons? Usually TvTeam is the 1st to post them here??? what happened????) PLEASE, I cannot download them from the Adult swim web site because I lack the hardware to do so, or I would GLADLY upload them myself. I cannot be the only person that enjoys this silly but very humorous cartoon. To anyone that can forward this request to user:  or . Thanks for all the episodes that have been added, I am very thankful for the work you and all the up-loaders do for the TPB community."
