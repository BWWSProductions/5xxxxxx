                    Adult multi-species puppet comedy about five  
                    animals who hang out in the back yard of an

                    pedigree It-bitch Destiny; wannabe tomcat  
                    Marion; cynical pigeon Kali; and sociopath  
                    Vince. Nelson discovers that the animals in  
                    Springwatch are actors, but auditions when he  
                    hears that Destiny loves the show. Marion falls  
                    for the beautiful but underage Lollipop.
