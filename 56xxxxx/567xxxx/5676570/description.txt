I just created my first Making History scenario. It took me about seven and a half hours to make. I didn't add any new units, but I did add about 100 new countries. I especially added a lot of countries in Africa, the Middle East, Oceania, and the Caribbean that you can liberate. I've also made a couple of balance changes, added new cities, and fixed some historical inaccuracies. I really did a lot of research on the countries I've added, and tried to be as historically accurate as possible. I have tested this scenario myself and it works fine. This scenario requires the full non-Gold version of Making History: The Calm and the Storm with the latest patch (which you can get here: http://making-history.com/files/MHPatch204.exe ) to play. The download is 522 KB and may take a couple of minutes to download for dial-up users.
