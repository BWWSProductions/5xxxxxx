          PLOT                                                    
           Four small gangsters from Copenhagen trick a gangster  
           boss: they take over 4,000,000 kroner which they were  
           supposed to bring him.  Trying to escape to Barcelona  
           they  are forced  to stop in  the countryside,  in an  
           old,  wrecked house,  hiding there for several weeks.  
           Slowly,  one after another,  they realize,  that they  
           would  like  to  stay  there,  starting  a new  life,  
           renovating   the   house   and    forming   it   into  
           a restaurant.  But they  can't  avoid being caught up  
           by their past.
