Broadcasting from the future. Vinny gives us his usual commentary on the world. Joining Vinny at the start of the show is his labeled 'co-host' "Chris". Also joining in the beginning is Charlie Veitch (http://www. cveitch .org/) of 'The Love Police'. Most of you should have heard of him by now, but if you have NOT please look into him and his cause, he's a good egg. In today's edition of Kiwi Collaborators, Tim Selwyn joins to give his unique perspectives.
