July 2, 2010: EXPOSED | Dia Zerva, PD 
  
 
PD wanted to go for a hike in the woods, but rather than pack a picnic he decided to bring along a bitch. Dia Zerva is going to experience the great outdoors in a whole new way with him. And after a short trip through the wilderness he is going to lead her back to the barn and have his way with her some more. 

The iron brace that PD uses to restrain Dia is ideal for a number of interesting uses. It can keep her suspended in the air quite easily and leaves her open to whatever sadistic torments he can come up with. The entire rig swings, allowing PD to roast his little piggy over an open flame or dunk her into an ice cold bath. It is a perfect device and he has even more just waiting to be put to good use.
