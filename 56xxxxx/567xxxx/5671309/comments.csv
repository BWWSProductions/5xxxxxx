,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-08-06T06:01Z,"merzedes can you reseed your infernal restraint files with no seeds ? or any body who downloaded them make into new torrents

if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !"
