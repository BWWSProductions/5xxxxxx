,DeepPirate,2010-07-09T04:06Z,"@pb_s4nnTry deleting the torrent and restarting it.  Worked for me.  If not, make sure DHT is turned on in your client and then delete the torrent and restart it."

,KickassWashingMachine,2010-07-11T11:20Z,"Pretty awesome quality, thanks! Video is great as DVD rips go, the audio is extremely good for a line audio. Practically no sync issues either.nnMovie itself not much to be happy about, except Jessica Biel is in it, so by definition it\'s one of the best movies ever made :)"
