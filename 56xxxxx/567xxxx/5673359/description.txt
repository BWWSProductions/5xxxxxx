In appreciation of Bitreeem's excellent series of B-movies, here's one he mentioned was looking for.

"Ro-Man, an alien that looks remarkably like a gorilla in a diving helmet, has destroyed all but six people on the planet Earth. He spends the entire film trying to finish off these survivors, but complications arise when he falls for the young woman in the group. Love that bubble machine! [imdb]"

Of especial note, the music by Elmer Bernstein!

Enjoy!
