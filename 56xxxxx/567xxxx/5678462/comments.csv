,kharaky,2010-07-16T15:36Z,file Alcohol120_retail_2.0.1.1820.exe has malware (expand.exe)....i use universal extractor to separate those 2 files...this is true cause the md5sum doesn\'t match...after extraction ...i check the md5sum...and macth ...even though has malware....its works well....but the malware is dangerous...you should separate them first.....there are a lot of torrents that have the same case.....but has different malware name (ntsi.exe)....hope uploaders clean this kind malware.....but if they\'re not....it\'s okay in pirate world...cause there is no rule here.
