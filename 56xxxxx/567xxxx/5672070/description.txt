a.k.a. "Meltdown" starring Jamie Luner and Meredith McGeachie (The L Word), 
tells the tale of a "highly sophisticated computer system" at a nuclear power 
plant that goes all "HAL" on its operators. To make matters worse, it develops a 
capacity for reason and malice while a tropical island storm is is blowing into 
town. (thanks to AfterEllen) 
At a nuclear power plant, the cooling system becomes a problem when the mother 
of all storms is headed straight towards it. As the hurricane gets stronger, and 
with the nuclear core in serious danger of meltdown, time is not on its side. 
The workers have to thwart natures fury to help prevent a catastrophe
