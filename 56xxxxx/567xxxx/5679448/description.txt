
This torrent is special, in that it contains no cracks or serials. 
It's as true to the original discs as possible. 

This is taken from the original game CDs, NOT from The First Decade.

Everything is complete, with both the Allied and Soviet discs for RA2. 

Included are the latest official Westwood patches for both RA2 and YR.

To play this online, you need a valid (REAL) serial. This torrent is for those who have a key, but have lost the discs or have broken discs, or who simply prefer to use the original games over TFD. If you have a serial from TFD, you can use that. 


You can burn to CDRs if you want, but I recommend just mounting with Daemon Tools Lite. Everything is much faster that way too.

IF you have problems starting the game, just change the compatibility mode to 
Windows 98 on the following: game.exe, gamemd.exe, Ra2.exe, RA2MD.exe, YURI.exe
