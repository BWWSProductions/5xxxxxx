PLEASE NOTE!!

This one is the new version of NIN waving Goodbye.

I changed the title to -NIN wave Goodbye- and changed the menue description a bit. So it will be clear which version you have now.

However, this doesn't mean that the old version is crap! 
It's just, that the new Digg Dialogg interview on this compilation has slightly better quality due to the fact that the HQ version has been replaced by the HD version.
I won't make a big deal out of this!
The "old" torrent will just been replaced anytime soon.

It's up to you now :-)
