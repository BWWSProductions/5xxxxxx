This outstanding dramatic film explores a personâ€™s soul...

..which is creatively represented by a board of directors. The members of the board (mind, memory, emotion, heart, will and conscience) discuss and vote on seemingly mundane events until a co-worker poses a question that has eternal consequences. When faced with the powerful indictment, the boardâ€™s hypocritical self-defense is exposed as it wrestles with the ultimate decision that every person must make.
