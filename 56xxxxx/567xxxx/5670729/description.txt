Save Me, San Francisco is the fifth album from California rock band Train and was released on October 27, 2009, through Columbia Records. 

The album's first single, "Hey, Soul Sister", which marked a return to the group's root-rock roots, was released to digital retailers on August 11, 2009. The music video for "Hey, Soul Sister" debuted on VH1's Top 20 Countdown show on October 10th. The single has since become Train's fourth-career Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and second career top 10 hit, reaching number three twenty six weeks after it was released. It is also the band's highest-peaking single to date in their native United States, as well as Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand.

Train is an American rock  band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1994. The band currently comprises a core trio of Patrick Monahan (lead vocalist), Jimmy Stafford (guitar) and Scott Underwood (drummer).

Train achieved mainstream success with their debut album, Train, which was released in 1998. Their second album, Drops of Jupiter (2001) brought the band massive popularity. The lead single from the album, "Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)", was an international hit and won two Grammy Awards in 2002. The album was certified double platinum in the United States and Canada and remains the band's best-selling album to date.

Their third studio album, My Private Nation, released in 2003, continued the band's success, and was certified platinum in the United States.
