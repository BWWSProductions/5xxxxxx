"I Was a Teenage Anarchist" is a song by the Gainesville, Florida-based punk rock band Against Me!, released as the first single from their 2010 album White Crosses. The single was released as a four-track digital download through various online music stores on April 6, 2010, including the additional album track "Rapid Decompression" and two B-sides from the album's sessions, "One by One" and "Bitter Divisions". A 7" single is scheduled for release April 17 in conjunction with Record Store Day, with an acoustic version of "I Was a Teenage Anarchist" as the B-side.

White Crosses is Against Me!'s fifth studio album, and their second to be released on Sire Records. As with its predecessor, 2007's New Wave, the album was produced by Butch Vig. It is also the first Against Me! album to feature George Rebelo, former drummer of Hot Water Music, following the departure of previous drummer Warren Oakes.

Recording began in August 2009, finishing two months later. The mixing and mastering of the album finished in February 2010. It is to be released June 7 or June 8, 2010. The initial pressing of the record will include four bonus tracks.

The album leaked March 12, 2010, a full three months before its release date, to which Tom Gabel responsed on his blog that it was simply "no drama", and what was followed by lyrics for all the songs.

A four track digital EP for "I Was A Teenage Anarchist" was released as the first single from the album, on April 20, 2010. 

White Crosses is one of Billboard's top picks for 2010.

On March 17, their first video from the album, "Rapid Decompression," was released online via AOL.
