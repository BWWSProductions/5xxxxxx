'Black Sugar'

"A shocking look at the living and working conditions of Haitian agricultural laborers in the Dominican Republic. Each year, some 20 000 workers cross the border to cut sugar cane, lured by promises of good money. Instead, they toil up to fourteen hours per day and live in unhealthy, cramped camps without running water, electricity, medical or educational facilities."
