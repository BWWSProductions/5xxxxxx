Plot: Filmmaker David Vahey chronicles the controversy surrounding mixed martial artist Matt Lindland, whose promising career in the Ultimate Fighting Championship was cut short when he was dismissed for wearing the wrong clothing at a pre-match event. Did the UFC have a legitimate beef or was UFC chief Dana White determined to protect UFC's golden-boy athletes by railroading the up-and-coming Lindland?

NOTES: Low audio quality is same as source.  Also at 00:45.35 there are 12 seconds of sound missing which is the same on the BluRay.
