Plot

A new rock-n-roll band plays at a sleepy town called Mill Basin, causing the town's kids to turn into rockers. However, what the town doesn't know is that the band is also turning kids into bird-like monsters. The soundtrack features many prominent bands at the time such as King Kobra, Tempest, Hallow's Eve, Lizzy Borden, among others. Most of the music for the band "Black Roses" was performed by the members of King Kobra, with Mark Free on vocals, and Carmine Appice on drums.
