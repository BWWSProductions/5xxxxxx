What an rape!nAnd I don?t know why you pricks complaining about pic & snd - it?s fine and IN synk!"
,batfink73,2010-07-11T12:12Z,Lets make fast money? By making a film of a tv-series that was being shown 25 years ago? Are you mental?

,BDA420,2010-07-12T03:09Z,V - 9  A - 7 nMovie - 7.5nnGood popcorn flick. The only drawback was at the end of the credits when there is a little something at the end of the film. Whoever did the audio left it in Russian and forgot to put it in its original English.
,TehAgent,2010-07-12T19:27Z,"What is it with all these noobs on here expecting us on a torrent site to go to some random ass web page that is most probably full of viruses and what not, to stream it on line? wtf is the deal with that, go back to the rock you crawled under and feck off, this is a torrent site, if we wanted to stream them, we would do a google search."

,wilson1375,2010-07-13T08:25Z,"The %99 error has nothing to with seeds/leeches. you either have to stop/start the torrent, restart torrent client, update tracker, or just stop the dl and rename the file if necessary"
,wilson1375,2010-07-13T10:19Z,"V-10nA-8nnThe TV show sucks, this movie is awesome!"

,gnzs,2010-07-14T08:08Z,"Video is great, but the audio starts well in the first 2 seconds, and then it\'s deliberately screwed by PrisM themselves, maybe to teach everyone a lesson about downloading...nnGreat movie otherwise. Way better than the original series, that was cheesy and just plain stupid. Thank you Hollywood, for improving so much upon the concept. nnIf you disagree with me, you might be a loser. Get yourself checked. Peace out!"
