Dogwitch is a cult comic book series written and illustrated by British writer/artist  Dan Schaffer.  Launched to critical acclaim in 2002, Dogwitch was published bi-monthly by Sirius Entertainment for three years before ending in 2005.  The series includes eighteen single issues, two art Portfolios, a 48-page Special Features book.

Banished deep into the evil Banewoods for daring to practice her own unique brand of Molotov Magick, outcast Dogwitch Violet Grimm continues to stretch the boundaries of accepted 21st Century witchcraft.  As tales of bad sex and dangerous voodoo spread her infamy through the Banewoods, Violet captures the attention of a multitude of weirdos and resigns herself to what she believes is her predestined B-movie lifestyle.  Churning out provocative home videos for a berserk and hungry fan base in her pursuit of arcane knowledge, she feeds her diary with the dating rituals of the sick and heinous.  Violet is the Garbo of witches, a reclusive legend in a depraved, gory, funny and fiendishly sexy world.

Due to scenes of a mature nature this torrent comes with an ADULT rating.
