,samjoe88,2010-07-07T01:35Z,"Also The book was banned by Lulu Publishing, because the enemy can?t have something this damaging floating around. There is no such thing as free speech, especially when you?re quoting people and letting their own words do the damage.  Why else would Lulu attempt to stifle free speech?  Download the manual now and find out why.

I had thought the web site was all about the real oath keepers, not some copycat-named outfit that's pure hatred.

If anyone is interested in hatred, that rag masquerades as a patriotic how-to. For those who are grossed out, don't bother, it is a manual that teaches hatred."
