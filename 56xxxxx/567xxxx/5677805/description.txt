"California Gurls" is an electropop  song by American singer-songwriter Katy Perry. It serves as the lead single of her upcoming third studio album, Teenage Dream. The song features rapper Snoop Dogg, and was produced by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Benny Blanco. According to Perry, the song is an answer song to "Empire State of Mind". The song was originally intended to be sent to mainstream and rhythmic airplay on May 25, 2010.

It is her second number-one single (on both Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot Dance Airplay charts) in the United States after 2008's "I Kissed a Girl" and Snoop Dogg's third number-one single after 2004's Drop It Like It's Hot with Pharrell and 2006's I Wanna Love You with Akon. The song has been Number 1 on Billboard Hot 100 for 5 weeks. Outside the United States, the song has reached number one on the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish and United Kingdom singles charts.
