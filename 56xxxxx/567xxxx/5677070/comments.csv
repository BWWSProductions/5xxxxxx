,catamaranman,2010-07-10T10:04Z,"What a great movie.....I avoided it like the plague because people seemed to hate it so much and felt it was so different than the original.  If you\'re like I was, dont waste another minute!  This movie is great and stayed true enough to the original.  Acting is great, CGI is every bit as good as Rings trilogy I cant attest to the quality of this file but the movie is definitely worth a watch...."

,psut,2010-10-27T03:46Z,"@ godslayer - or you could just use one program, that's better than every other media player out there - VLC - and not have to install more crap on your computer than you need to.  Also, most people out there don't need to know a damn thing about ripping a movie.  They should have some idea, considering what they're doing on here, but they don't need to.  If you're talking about ENCODING a movie using specific codecs & formats, then that's a different story.
Morons like maxigawa that don't check it out before posting their ""beware"" and ""doesn't play"" comments are the noobs.  However, still nothing to do with ripping the video."
,globalpuffer,2010-12-05T12:20Z,"I have had great luck with BS.Player PRO, it plays everything I have thrown at it, there is a great copy here at TPB and it is awesome with the subtitles if you need those.  For some reason it messed up all my codec work for wmp but since it works so well, I dont care.  Oh and Clash of Titans noir; A10 V10 M6"

,bigtimegeek,2011-04-06T22:41Z,"More Windows weenies who think that VLC is the answer to everything, I see.

VLC does NOT play everything under the sun on my system.  It actually plays next to nothing on my system until after I add codecs and then configure the shit out of it.  Then again, I don't use Windows.  Your VLC SOLVES EVERYTHING comment is only useful for Windows users.

At the same time, VLC may play many types on Windows (not all, though.  There's a billion compression routines it does not support out of the box, and some it never will support at all), but only because it has a lot of OLD libraries statically compiled into it.  This is a horrific way to get your movies to play on Windows (or any other system) as anything newer than the linked-in libraries have to fallback to compatibility mode to work at all, rendering the majority of reasons to release further specifications of the codec pointless and discarding anything more advanced the codec in your file uses.

In short, fuck off with the VLC stuff and suggest people get a real codec set, which allows them to use whatever player they chose, not the player you mandate they use.  If they do that, they even can upgrade codecs in the future on their own, instead of waiting on the VLC programmers to do something.

And for god's sake, psut, stop being a noob."
