BBC R3 - Madame de Lafayette's 'La Princesse de Clèves'
Translated and adapted by Jo Clifford
Directed by Kirsty Williams
Broadcast February 28, 2010
Coded from a digital source at 128/44.1

Published annonymously in 1678. Although the action
involves real people and events at the court of Henri II
[1558], in reality the work is a thinly veiled satire on
the court of Louis XIV, and features the same wickedness
that makes 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' so compelling.

Young woman attends at court to find a husband. Having
done so she becomes prey to gossip when she falls in
love with another. Though chaste, she confesses all to
her husband who frets and takes ill.

Last summer Sarkozy was accused of philistinism, and sparked
of public readings of the novel, when he criticised the French
civil service entrance exams for including questions about it.
