 When the Germans march into Prague, armour-plating      
 inventor Dr Bomasch flees to England. His daughter Anna 
 escapes from arrest to join him, but the Gestapo manage 
 to kidnap them both back to Berlin. As war looms,       
 British secret service agent Gus Bennet follows         
 disguised as a senior German army officer. His ploy is  
 the not unpleasant one of pretending to woo Anna to the 
 German cause.
