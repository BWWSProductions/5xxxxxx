I take the courage ( again) to ask you if there is something out there, like the ( Essential House Plan Collection 1500 Best Selling Home Plans ) you had uploaded time ago. Plans of houses that is to say. ( European if possible ).
Thank you again for all your useful uploads. "
[V],malestrom_HH,2010-07-06T19:17Z,My dear friend are you interested in plans only or even software to create your own plans?
,ioannisarc,2010-07-06T19:38Z,"Hi and thank you for your interest.
I dont know what you have in mind regarding software.
I have found many programs here at piratebay.
Personally I use Autocad for 2D, and for 3D I use principally ChiefArchitect X2 version 12,4,,0,23. 
From last year I don't see any  arount new versions of Chief ( even at Demonoid).
However I am interested principally for modern plans of residential and countryside houses of European style.
Thank again and don't feel obligate to find at all costs this material. I have already download many useful books from you."
