 Plot.....:

 A short film by Nick Burton and Eddie McMillan includes a 2001 interview
 with actor Sergeant John Sweet, who eventually returned to teaching in
 the states. He exudes wisdom and charm and is fundamentally the character
 in the movie. Sweet characterizes himself while filming as too self-directed
 and preoccupied to take in the wonders of England, and then wisely says
 that's exactly how one is supposed to be when one is young.

 Taken from the Canterbury Tale 2DiSC Criterion DVD.
