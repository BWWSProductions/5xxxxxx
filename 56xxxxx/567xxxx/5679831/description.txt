The FTP Client That's Both Powerful and User Friendly.


DonΓÇÖt let the name fool you: Direct FTP is way more than just an FTP client. Sure, it transfers files at donΓÇÖt-blink-or-youΓÇÖll-miss-it speeds, but itΓÇÖs also a complete Web design toolbox. Use it to make lastΓÇÉminute edits, preview and organize your files, and back everything up, just in case. It's the only FTP client with a full-blown, built-in Web editor that lets you work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and more. With other stellar features like bookmarks, easy archival, and a neatly ordered activity log, it leads the pack in power and usability.
