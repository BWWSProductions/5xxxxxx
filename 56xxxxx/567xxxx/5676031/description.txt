Wikipedia - International pressing of her extraordinary debut album. At just 19, Glaswegian singer-songwriter Amy possesses a talent way beyond her years. Since signing to Vertigo, Amy has had a phenomenal few months. She's supported a diverse mix of artists including Travis (her childhood idols!) and fellow Scott Paolo Nutini. She's performed at Glastonbury, Hyde Park Calling, T In The Park and V Festival. She also sold out the renowned Scottish venue King Tuts. She's a favorite of Elton John, too! 11 tracks including the singles 'Mr. Rock & Roll' and 'Poison Prince'. Universal. 
2007.

Amazon.co.uk Review By Louis Pattison - Amy MacDonald is that proverbial old head on young shoulders, a Scottish singer-songwriter who, despite her tender 19 years, writes songs with the grace, wisdom and proficiency of one with a score more on the clock. As influenced by The Libertines as any venerable old folk hand, the eleven songs on This Is the Life combine a traditional, acoustic folk-rock sound with a youthful spirit and self-assured lyrics that veer between the observational and the confessional. "Poison Prince" is a jagged guitar strut dedicated to some Doherty-like bad boy, a song every bit as pathos-laden as The Libertines at their doomed, romantic best with a closing treatise to find "An upbeat song/So we can dance the night away", while "Mr Rock & Roll" begins as a wryly withering jibe at some perennial party animals, but by the chorus, has softened into a subtle, touching tale of human coupling. MacDonaldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s age doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to have been an impediment; "Youth of Today", reportedly written when she was 15, is one of the better tracks here, while "FootballerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wife" is a clear-headed attack on vapid Barbie Doll celebrity that suggests this girl is very much on the right track. "Rolling Stone, here I come, watch out everyone/IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m singing my song" she sings on "LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Start a Band". Let that be a warning to you. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ

BBC Review By Elle J Small - Singer/ songwriter/ guitarist Amy Macdonald may still be a teenager but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to believe her music will ever appeal to her peers. Like Joss Stone, Macdonald has an old voice on her young shoulders. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not to say you should dismiss This Is The Life if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re under 40, but you will need a more mature ear to relate to AmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s folk-styled storytelling, grown-up vocal and country-influenced guitar. The young Glaswegian may be currently heralded as 'the new Katie Melua' but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something more Cranberries-esque to her warbling. This is highlighted on her debut LPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mr Rock & RollÃ¢â‚¬Â- a radio-friendly, sing-a-long jig, full of Celtic campfire nostalgia. Moving on to the album title track, lyrically Macdonald comes across like a wise 39-year-old as opposed to a naÃƒÂ¯ve 19-year-old, leading you to question the authenticity of her delivery. In other words, the words and tone feel somewhat forced. Gripes aside, there are some gleaming gems to be discovered on this 11-tracker. Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Start A BandÃ¢â‚¬Â hears a Mexican cowboy intro makes way for Amy to unleash her emotive tones and brilliant lyrics: 'Give me a stage and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be your rock Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn roll Queen/ Your 20th Century cover of a magazine/ Rolling Stone, here I come/ Watch out everyoneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦'. Further notables include the upbeat, brass-heavy roller, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Barrowland BallroomÃ¢â‚¬Â and the melodic Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Wish For Something MoreÃ¢â‚¬Â- which allows Macdonald to work her vocal to its full range while highlighting her razor-sharp guitar wizardry. The star of the show though has to be down-tempo number Ã¢â‚¬Å“FootballerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WifeÃ¢â‚¬Â on which Amy mocks todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tabloid-fuelled society.
