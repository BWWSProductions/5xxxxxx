,andrew531,2010-08-06T18:24Z,"Guys, the subtitles are permanently on whilst playing back via Windows Media Centre and the usual option to remove them is not an option!

is there any other way of removing the subtitles as the quality of this film is superb but the subtitles are so annoying. Thank you for the upload though it is a quality up"
