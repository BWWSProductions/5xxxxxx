STAGE PROFILE:

This is a traditional stage, without major difficulties, and the first entirely French stage of this yearΓÇÖs Tour. It is very short, but during the three previous days, we will have travelled a long way and encountered many difficulties. It is a time to tend the wounds. Whilst the fighters will try and strike out in breakaways, the sprintersΓÇÖ teams will want to ensure that the pack reaches the finish in a group. Wind may have been a factor if this race had taken place earlier in the season, because the roads are more open to the elements in northern France. However, at this time of year, with a fairly bumpy finish, it will not have much of an influence.
