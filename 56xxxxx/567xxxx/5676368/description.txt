IMAGiNE NOTES
Right sourced used was a dvdr we were sent from a special friend .... cheers m8ty ;-)
Now the vobs themselves had the interlace issues like with kingdoms release, and whilst you cam make it better we can't see anyway to remove them ....... guessing the original files off the camera were encoded bad so
Anyway work done ...... first thing was cut the film up to 10 parts where there was some major camera movement and then crop them all differently and then resize them the same, so yes a few parts the AR will be off slightly.
Some parts we used a quad filter as the borders were at an angle so this allowed us to crop it without losing any footage
Once done it was a case of adding our normal filters to .... messing with the chroma, rgb colours, brightness etc ...... and then
encoding each part on their own and then join them together afterwards
The audio on the dvdr was some nice AC3 cam audio so we just encoded it to mp3 for this xvid release.
