This is the nullDC v. 1.6 beta emuator for Dreamcast

The 4 games I put in here are Mortal Kombat Gold, Sonic Adventure, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and Soul Calibur 

I have already extraced the cdi files from all the games but Soul Calibur sorry for the inconvience

BIOS is included and all the files are there

One quick note, you must load the games with the Hle GDROM boot or else the memory units will not function

This is my first upload for TPB and I am proud to be a part of a great web community

I will be seeding this file and my future others 24/7/365 unless I am not connected to the internet

Thank you all and please download and SEED
