Taken From Stoner HIVe:
"These four Swedish horsemen of the Apocalypse are riding hard and playing loud. The recordings they have done so far show promise of much straight up rock 'n roll with heavy riffing, loads of psychedelica and fueled with low grinding basslines... Aah yes; and with the vocal lines floating on top of these layers; all fuzz, groove, stoner and doom freaks will dig these tunes! They're so damn low and tasty; McDonalds, KFC and all the other fake ass fast food joints should take a sample; maybe it'll make them up the recepies and make something worth eating! Propane Propane we salute you! Check'em out and buy the freaking album through their myspace; cause the artwork is top of the bill as well!"
