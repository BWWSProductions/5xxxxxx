,mrdiskodave,2010-08-18T18:31Z,"subtitles are often in translationese

they are also badly timed so it needs to be paused

anyone have a URL for better subs?"
,BoFrazer,2011-12-22T15:29Z,"Finally one in Swedish w/ English sub-titles.  Spot check looks great, many thanx for sharing, and especially for preserving the audio the way the director intended.  I browsed a dozen torrents before finding this!"
