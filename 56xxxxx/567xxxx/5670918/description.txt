Radio sitcom set around the professional and personal life of the social worker Clare Barker. 

Clare Barker has entered a caring profession so that she can sort out other peoples problems rather than deal with her own. 

A control freak, Clare likes nothing better than interfering in other people's lives on both a professional and personal basis. 

Secretly regarding herself as a cross between Mother Theresa and Wonder Woman, Clare tends towards self-importance and considers most other professions as trivial.

She is in her early thirties, white, middle class and heterosexual, all of which are occasional causes of discomfort to her.

Each week we join Clare in her continued struggle to control both her professional and private life.
