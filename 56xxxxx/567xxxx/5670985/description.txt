Jesse Harper - guitar absolution in the shade of the midnight sun

Perhaps the greatest 60's guitarist to never make it big Jesse Harper (real name Doug Jerebine) From New Zealand recorded a single unreleased album in the late 60's of which there was only one single acetate. The Human Instinct from NZ recorded a number of his tracks included on their influential first albums. Not much is known of the recording or the people involved, according to myth Jesse played all the guitar parts himself with an unknown drummer an unashamed Jimi Hendrix fan the album is a 60's masterpiece, with its own distinct voice. In 1994 the UK label Kissing spell finally released it on CD, Sadly they altered the track order and were maybe a little enthusiastic in their digital 'cleaning up' It was later released on the specialist vinyl only label Acme out of the UK with restored track order and sound in a small limited edition. However if you are a fan of psych, heavy psych, Jimi, 60's Guitar or just quality music this is a must have.
