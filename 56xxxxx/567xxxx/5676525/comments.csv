,Try-M,2010-10-12T10:00Z,is it safe?
,theevony2,2011-01-19T05:25Z,"Its safe as far as I can see. The download is a little slow though, more seeders are needed. It has great definition, 720p. For those wondering if it is dubbed, it is not. There are no hardsubs, the subs can be turned off it you prefer to watch it raw. I have only seen positive comments on this particular anime and would like to watch the rest of it whenever it is downloaded. Hopefully this will encourage more people to download (and hopefully seed)"

I hope someone will upload the second season soon enough."
,ConvexEd,2011-04-07T18:05Z,I'm surprised that Piratebay has the full series whereas other anime sites don't. I'll go and DL this and see if its all good
,Atreyis,2012-06-22T10:00Z,"@ConvexEd; I'm not surprised that TPB has both seasons, before I signed up for BakaBT I got ALL of my anime from TPB (and most of the time I still do). Now and again Demonoid will have more seeders than TPB for anime/movies/music and I'll go through Demonoid instead, but I always, always check TPB; I mean, come on, it's for PIRATES after all XD

Though, technically, downloading anime isn't illegal since it's aired on public television...but still."
