Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable is a single player, AI team-based RPG that brings the thought-provokingly addictive fun that made Persona 3 a runaway hit on PlayStation 2 to PlayStation Portable (PSP). The game contains most of the content from the original Persona 3 as well as some elements of Persona 3: FES, and features the new and crucial abilities to play as a female character and to directly control your teammates in combat. Additional functionality includes Skill Cards, part-time jobs, one-button menu shortcuts, streamlined team equipment changes and shortened load screens optimized for PSP. 

Sorry about the noobish upload before. This time everything is right, but I've now multirar'd it so you'll have to start over. Things should go smoother this time.

About an hour ago I didn't know how to do anything needed to upload this. Thanks for bearing with my ignorance.

I can confirm the game is fully working after a prometheus patch.
