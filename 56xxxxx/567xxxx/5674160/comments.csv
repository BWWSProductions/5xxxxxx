,321lol,2010-07-07T03:02Z,"Cant you set this to super seeder mode?

(distributes a 1.000 ratio between everyone then seeds as normal so all parts are out there & the burdern just isnt on you)"
,TheFoldedOne,2010-07-07T03:31Z,"Look, Sigmund!

Look at the sky!

Zhe planets are on fire!

It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system are incinerating!

Like flaming globes, Sigmund! Like flaming globes!

Aaaah, ha ha ha, ha, hah!...



(i.e.: THANK YOU! YOU ROCK!) "
,Jepjr,2010-07-07T03:53Z,"Thanks for the quick upload, will seed for a while. Unfortunately the download is kind of spiking. So it's going to take a bit."
,rhuwei,2010-07-07T04:35Z,"Hi, is it working in gen D3? or 5.00 M33-6?"
,Abyssion,2010-07-07T05:37Z,We need those 3 seeders.
,rhuwei,2010-07-07T06:01Z,c'mon guyz lets set our uploads to unlimited =D
,Dammerung,2010-07-07T09:49Z,The amount of leechers is (are?) unbearable!!! DX 8 hours and counting! Almost 80%! I'm going to be seeding for quite awhile after all this!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

,Miqunator,2010-07-07T10:18Z,"Lets hope this works, then I can stop worrying if my imported game (whenever it arrives) runs on gen-d3 ^^"
,Miqunator,2010-07-07T10:21Z,"Lets hope this works, then I can stop worrying if my imported version (whenever it arrives) works on gen-d3 ^^"

,Miqunator,2010-07-07T17:18Z,"if you're using 5.50 gen-d3 the easiest way to get this to work is probably the prometheus addon, http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/1953, saves you the hassle of patching the iso -.-;"
,rhuwei,2010-07-07T17:32Z,"@omnislash - can you help me, we have the same CFW but i dont know how to use the promethius patch, thnx"
,Aoshi18,2010-07-07T18:13Z,@ Miqunator i tried to patch the game iso but failed... so i tried patching my psp instead and got it to work thanks!  Is there any downside to this update? I mean i saw a red flash on the screen before the game loaded.
,nyang963,2010-07-07T20:59Z,where can i get the prometheus patch XP
,nyang963,2010-07-07T21:03Z,how do you patch it up anyway XP
,blaze7755,2010-07-07T21:14Z,"Okay guys. do this. 

download http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/1931

then put the iso_tool folder into PSP/GAME

then run the program

Go to the person 3 portable game

Click patch

Then go to patch prometheus

It should work fine after that :D"
,nyang963,2010-07-08T04:30Z,"thanks blaze7755 XD

it works now XD"
,knight221,2010-07-09T01:25Z,"Seems that at a certain point, the game keeps freezing whenever I talk to Akihiko. It also froze on me after Junpei tells the SEES members the ghost story that\'s related with Fuuka"
,babak159,2010-07-09T19:45Z,@knight221nncan you upload your save game for us to check it?nperhaps i should look for a working version
,seedammit,2010-07-09T20:52Z,How about a fix for psp 3000?
,Darkmatter0,2010-07-12T04:07Z,My game freezes on day 6/3 when ever I try to enter the dorm everytime. I\'ve tried in 5.00 M33-6 and 5.50 GEN-d2/d3. And it freezes in the exact same spot. And one got a anti-freeze cheat for CWcheat or something to help me out?
,FernFrond,2010-07-12T23:06Z,Ok got the iso tool on and patched it and it starts on Gen d3. Im playing God eater now but it seems like it will work. Is it fun as a turnbased game since I have grown quite tired of bad turn based games.
,foolish_genocide,2010-07-16T08:43Z,im at 11/19 and it freezes everytime I enter the main characters room after talking with junpei. firmware is already prometheus patched.
,foolish_genocide,2010-07-16T22:34Z,"nvm, found myself a working version. =)"
,deathtoallorangatans,2010-07-27T17:18Z,"@foolish_genocide:
Where's that working version?
I'm surprised a highly-rated game has only this torrent?"
,Darktangent10,2010-08-08T04:33Z,Does this prometheus patch work with 5.00 M33-6?
,xuandong,2010-08-09T10:27Z,"got a problem, the game always freeze when i talk to the gourmet king when there is no school, any solution? thanks. "
,wytebud,2010-08-15T18:20Z,Anyone who has a problem with this should go to pspslimhacks.com go to the custom firmware section and get the Prometheus CFW. You could patch it separately but it's way easier to just make your psp CFW 5.03 Prometheus or 5.50 Prometheus. 
,ryder62,2010-08-17T17:54Z,Is this the full voice version???
,alexsan03,2010-09-05T13:16Z,My game stops at 11/19 ...please help I really need to finish the game....(T_T)..
