,davincighost,2010-07-14T20:30Z,"Thank you very much! Bigrod!rnrnDo you guys know a secret? you can print out the charts to a PDF file. Simply go to C:\\ProgramData\\Jeppesen\\Common\\Fonts , classificate by type, then install the first 4 TTF fonts, just select them, right click and install (or install as shortcut works too). Now you can save the charts in pdf, bring with you anywhere, and print when needed, hope you guys enjoy my tip! regards"
,airmen,2010-07-16T09:51Z,"Hi, davincighost, may you more clear about your procedure:rn- Which fonts should be taken, andrn- where we have to install them?rnMany thanks to the uploader"
,davincighost,2010-07-21T19:01Z,"There are only 4 TTF - true type fonts in this folder, this fonts should go to FONTS folder in windows, you find this at control panel, the easy way is right click and choose install."

,Peace69,2010-07-30T19:17Z,"*********** ALL PLEASE HELP!!! ***********

I am looking for the Data Cycle from December 2008 / Jan 2009. This AND ONLY this can make JeppView run in the first instance. I had it but accidentally deleted it. Now I need to reinstall but the security mechanism means none of the old codes don't work unless I use the above cycles first. Anyone have them? Please seed.

Thanks"
