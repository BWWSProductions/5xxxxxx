***** PLOT *****

Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Butters and Jimmy arrive at Pi Pi's
Splashtown waterpark. Cartman is distraught to discover that most
of the park's attendants are people of different races, while
Kyle is disgusted to learn so many people freely urinate in the
pools. Based on his observance of more minorities at the park
than white people, Cartman calculates there will be no white
people left by the year 2012, and interprets this as a sign that
Mayans accurately predicted the world would end the same year.
Meanwhile, a scientist tests the park's water and discovers it is
98 percent urine. He urges Pi Pi, the park's Venetian owner, to
immediately close and evacuate his park, claiming the high urine
content will soon trigger a cataclysmic event. Pi Pi dismisses the
warning, but the park is soon overcome by tsunamis of urine and
volcanic eruptions. Hundreds drown in the subsequent flood,
including Kenny, but the other boys manage to survive.

The park is quarantined, and the scientist advises against a
mission to rescue those trapped inside, fearing their exposure
to "pee contamination" has turned them into dangerous,
hate-filled mutants. To prove his theory, the scientist urinates
onto a test monkey, which promptly becomes agitated. An antidote
to this reaction is then tested on other monkeys, but proven
unsuccessful when the monkeys still become angered when urinated
on. Meanwhile, Cartman clings to debris to stay afloat, while
the other boys have reached higher ground. Cartman is rescued
by the occupants of an inflatable raft. Noticing he is the only
white person in the raft, Cartman assumes he is the "last of his
species", and that his envisioned 2012 scenario has occurred
three years early. He imagines a world in which he must speak in
minority slang, is paid lower wages, and eventually forced to
live in a concentration camp.

The other boys find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be
drained of the inundation if someone can swim through the pee
to reach an emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees to
do the job as he said at the start of the episode that he could
hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must
drink the urine in order to offset the fluid pressure he will
encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the
monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered:
bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of
urine in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he
finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission.
Just as Kyle complains that eating a banana would be the only ordeal
more disgusting than what he has just been through, he is ordered
at gunpoint to consume the antidote.
