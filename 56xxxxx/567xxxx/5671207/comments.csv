,Darken88,2010-07-17T19:47Z,"I have got to say that all seasons I watched so far from 24 (that`s until season 5), were all downloaded from RiddlerA\'s rips.nnThese video rips are so excellent in quality and so small in size, it is truly remarkable!nnSo far all of them have the subtitles included in the torrent, except this one, Season 5. nnI tried finding some appropriate subtitles on the web, but with no success.nnRiddlerA, could you please let me know if you still have the subtitles available, and if so how can I get them?nnThanks!nn"

Great upload btw!!"
,mzchief,2010-11-29T16:41Z,"thanks, brilliant quality"
,mcdooby,2011-05-16T05:12Z,"i like you guy, decent downloads just a shame i have to master the video before i can burn it. computer slow took me 150 hours to change season 1 from mkv to vob and onto a disc. i dont know if that is a long time as i usually just download avis and burn them in that format. anyway awesome work. my kuos are yours to cherish or discard like an old stand up comic who just is out of touch with the times and its embarrassing.....like jim davidson. anyway sorry for ranting but any chance of uploading a seth rogan compilation and an adam sandler compilation?"
,zvekan,2011-06-12T02:03Z,the subtitles for season 5 DVDRip.XviD-SAiNTS should work fine
,honey_nel,2011-08-14T21:35Z,"Here are the subtitles for each episode. Just select the season 5 from the season list and download the ""DVDRip.XviD-SAiNTS"" subs for each episode. They will work fine..
