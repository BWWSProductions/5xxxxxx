,wakanabi,2010-07-10T01:54Z,".... Freezes at \""Game Loading\"" Screen. R4 card. Must require a fix/patch.  Best not download it yet"
,Joey1666,2010-07-10T13:01Z,"i have an original r4 card unpatched, will i need to patch it to play this and if so where can such patch be obtained?"
,Joey1666,2010-07-10T13:05Z,"ok im stuck at game loading, how do i update my r4 ?"
,Joey1666,2010-07-10T13:26Z,sorry for triple post. i updated to wood v. 1.10 and its saying this game is corrupted what do i do ?
,Herz_F,2010-07-10T14:32Z,But why M3 simple flashcard recognize this ROM as homebrue ? O_ornAnd its don`t working :(
,bongo264,2010-07-10T21:57Z,M3 Zero SUX
,bongo264,2010-07-11T13:33Z,THIS IS A FAKE. The reason it looks like homebrew is the card see\'s no header on the file? The file is a 128mb of 0x00000000. Whoever said it was working is lying or has a different torrent.
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-07-11T23:52Z,"\""ANONYMOUS\"" - always a fake. nnDo not download this."
,h0ser81,2010-07-14T17:16Z,"This is NOT a fake. It\'s a clean dump of the ROM. Thus, there\'s anti-piracy included in the dump. You either need to wait for your flash cart to come out with a fix or just google the words, Dragon Quest IX Xenom."
,pushit09,2010-07-20T19:16Z,crashes after customization options on my r4
