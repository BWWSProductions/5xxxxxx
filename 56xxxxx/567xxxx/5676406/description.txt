[quote]While rival drug cartels warred in the streets and the murder rate climbed to highest in the world, the Colombian national soccer team set out to blaze a new image for their country. What followed was a mysteriously rapid rise to glory, as the team catapulted out of decades of obscurity to become one of the best in the world. Central to this success were two men named Escobar: AndrÃ©s, the captain and poster child of the National Team, and Pablo, the infamous drug baron who pioneered the phenomenon known in the underworld as "Narco-soccer." But just as Colombia was expected to win the 1994 World Cup and transform its international image, the shocking murder of Andres Escobar dashed the hopes of a nation.

Through the glory and the tragedy, "The Two Escobars" daringly investigates the secret marriage of crime and sport, and uncovers the surprising connections between the murders of Andres and Pablo.[/quote]
