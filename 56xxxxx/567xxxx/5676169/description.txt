LAND OF THE PHARAOHS (1955)

In ancient Egypt the Pharaoh Khufu (Jack Hawkins) is obsessed with acquiring gold and plans to take it all with him into the "second life". To this end he enlists the aid of Vashtar (James Robertson Justice), an architect whose people he has enslaved in Egypt. 
The agreement is to build a robber-proof tomb in exchange for the slaves' release, although Vashtar will have to die when the pyramid-tomb is finished to preserve the secret of its construction against tomb robbers. 
During the years that the pyramid is being built, the pharaoh demands tribute from all the territories. 
Nellifer (Joan Collins) is the princess and ambassador of the tributary province of Cyprus.
