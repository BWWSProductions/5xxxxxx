     The TYR Vikings have completed their latest work under the        
     glow of the North Star. On "By the Light of the Northern          
     Star" the Faroese band delivers catchy yet technically            
     brilliant tracks, and once again demonstrates how to              
     impressively unite the contemporary present with the              
     mythological past. Traditional homeland melodies, Viking          
     choruses, and classic heavy metal                                 
     songs, such as "Hold the Heathen Hammer High" or even the         
     title track, offer fans new and powerful hymns. Responsible       
     for the brilliance of this "Northern Star" is once again          
     frontman and mastermind Heri Joensen, who provides an             
     undisputed goose bump factor with his clean and majestic          
     vocals. "By the Light of the Northern Star" offers Viking         
     Metal that only TYR can forge. Follow the North Star to           
     Asgard!
