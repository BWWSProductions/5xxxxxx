Description:

Simple instructions on how to copy and fake fingerprints. In order to fake a fingerprint, you need an original first. Fingerprints consist of nothing but fat and sweat on touched items. Therefore in order to retrieve someone elses fingerprint - in this case the fingerprint you want to forge - you should rely on well tested forensic research methods. How this is done will be explained here.

Comment:

Do you fear a conspiracy? Make your own one! Creating a new identity is your first step and for a new identity you need new fingerprints. Technical: This video is in german, but it is highly useful anyway. The text file explains and replaces the german sound in the video.
