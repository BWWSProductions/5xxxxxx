[V],nos1977,2010-07-08T04:02Z,"Maya (stylised as /\/\ /\ Y /\) is the upcoming third studio album by British-Sri Lankan recording artist M.I.A., set to be released on 13 July 2010 on her own label, N.E.E.T Recordings, through XL Recordings and Interscope Records. Songwriting and production for the album were primarily handled by M.I.A. and Blaqstarr. Rusko and Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells are among the collaborators on the album, as are M.I.A.'s long-time associates Diplo and Switch. The album was mainly composed and recorded at M.I.A.'s house in Los Angeles.

The album's tracks centre on the theme of information politics and are intended to evoke what M.I.A. called a ""digital ruckus"". Elements of industrial music were incorporated into M.I.A.'s sound for the first time. Several tracks from the album were made available online prior to its release, including ""Born Free"", which generated controversy due to its graphically violent music video.
