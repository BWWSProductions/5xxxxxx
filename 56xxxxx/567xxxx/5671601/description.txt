- (1973) Zarathustra [Japanese edition 2003] -

"This album is highly acclaimed by many Italian symphonic progressive fans. I think it is a bit overrated. The music itself is very good, but definitely not a masterpiece. Actually, I find the music unequal; the melodies are often not really convincing or just simply not sufficient enough to be completely impressed. The rhythm and airs constantly change: it makes a VERY progressive album. The music seriously lacks follow-through, so that it often sounds like a series of independant parts sequenced together. The instruments are well played, but I find very little emotion involved, despite the presence of many floating mellotron passages...
...Regarding influences, King Crimson circa Wake of Poseidon is inevitable."

...IMO, nothing else to add!
