Full HD Video, New Modules, Data Disc Menus
 Ashampoo Burning Studio users are unusually loyal, with good reason ΓÇô this programΓÇÖs speed, 
 simplicity and efficiency are simply unbeatable. Over the years the Ashampoo programmers have 
 turned the program into a full suite that can handle all your data, audio and video burning 
 and authoring tasks, without sacrificing its famous ease of use. In version 10 they have once 
 again added a wealth of new features and modules, but the program is still amazingly intuitive 
 to use ΓÇô everything is explained as you do it. 

 The main focus of this premium version is even better authoring capabilities for building video 
 and audio discs using the latest formats. HD and Full HD video (720p and 1080p) are now fully 
 supported for Blu-ray discs, and all the encoding is handled by Ashampoo Burning Studio 10. 
 All the authoring tools have been overhauled and the video encoding quality is even better than before. 
 You now use the same new integrated editor for building DVD and Blu-ray video disks with menus. 
 The program also starts more quickly and is generally snappier to use. 

In addition to this there is a new Autoplay Editor module with which you can build auto-starting 
data discs with attractive interactive menus ΓÇô for example for collections of programs. And there 
is now also a new Audio Player with which you can play audio files and audio CDs without leaving the program.
