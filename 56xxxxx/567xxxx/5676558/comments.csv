,Magicmind,2010-07-09T16:20Z,For some reason sound is totally out of sync
,Dean1990,2010-07-12T14:49Z,out of sync at start and poor quailty in some scenes.
,payney1210,2010-07-14T18:31Z,Thanks for the upload raymondhome very quick d/l at speeds between 1.2 and 2.2 MB/s. V/7 A/7 would of give the vision an 8 but there is a water mark through out the movie and audio would of been an 8 but the dubbing is out for the first 10 - 15 minutes this is definately the best copy out there so far. So again thanks to raymondhome for the upload and thanks to the rest of you who made this version possible.
,digitalonion,2010-08-06T13:01Z,"Audio ( nice audio quality but sometimes out of sync)

Video [Dean1990] ""and poor quailty in some scenes."""
