PrisM Notes:
firstly, i filtered the R6 Video adding a denoise filter, a deblock filter to try and get the blocks down a bit quite alot in source..then i added a smoothness filter onto it, trying to keep video looking pretty normal instead of a painting :P
then was onto the brightness and contrast, highered the brightness a touch, and slightly changing the contrast to bring some color back into it...then tweaked the saturation :P and then.....was onto the RGB highered the red with one filter and lowered on another seems mad but it works :lol:, then i tweaked the other colors also.
Anyway, the video is missing a few minutes on the original source, mostly some fighting scenes, so i took imagines cam, compared the 2 and made alot of cuts onto
it to try and add the scenes back in, so now the runtime is 4minutes longer...i have missed a few but im not perfect :P
anyway on the R6 Some of the video is different than the cam so it's pretty hard to find the missing scenes etc...so yes on the missing scenes theirs cam video and cam audio i added in...but now you get a few more action scenes. overall it looks
pretty good, and took quite a while to get their.
The audio we had to cut up, to get the right sampling rate and same dating stream on each part and left untouched on cam audio....anyway ENJOY!!!!
