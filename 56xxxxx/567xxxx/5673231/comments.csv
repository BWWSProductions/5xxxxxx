[T],Amplified_Pumpkin,2010-08-02T21:10Z,"Works perfect on Acekard 2i with AKAIO 1.7.1 firmware and latest loader.  Sounds like Bellasgoose doesn't know how to update his/her card ""properly""."

,BellasGoose,2010-08-26T12:58Z,"Erm.. Amplified_Pumpkin, my Acekard 2i has the latest update and loader you fucking idiot! It's glitchy as fuck so no, it doesn't fucking work ""PROPERLY""! You telling me this game is FULLY working on your console? Coz I know you're talking bullshit if you are you absolute cunt!"
,nut172,2010-08-27T06:56Z,what should i do after downloading this torrent?
,dvdriprocketmail,2010-09-03T09:55Z,"@BellasGoose

Don't use the original Acekard kernal.  Download AKAIO 1.7.1 custom kernal for Acekard 2/2i at akaio. net"
,dvdriprocketmail,2010-09-03T09:59Z,"Tested on DS Lite with EZFlash Vi

Game loads, but can't get past the second level where you need the ""A"" button to work"
,dvdriprocketmail,2010-09-03T10:58Z,"Tested on R4 SDHC with DS Lite and rom wouldn't load.  Just got two white screens.

Ran Wood for R4 clones and tried to load game and got Loading... screen followed by message ""The save data could not be accessed.  Please turn the power off and reinsert the Game Card."""
,nick2504,2010-09-19T12:03Z,does this work on r4 wood 1.12?
,phat.boy69,2010-10-22T01:05Z,"A button doesn't work on DSI XL firmware 1.4.1 with latest patch on M3iZero and firmware 4.8f as issued by M3 21 Sep 10. Neither does 5126 or 5016 releases or one labelled (DJ1978). 
Shame as Wii versions  of game all in French or not working either."
