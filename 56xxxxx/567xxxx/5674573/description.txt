Review	by Al Campbell
Hip Young Guitar Slinger and "His Heavy Friends" focuses on Jimmy Page's work as a session guitarist for the Immediate and Pye labels in the '60s. The first disc includes the poppier end of his work behind Gregory Phillips, the Kinks and Nico, while the second disc finds him in more familiar territory backing English blues masters like Eric Clapton, John Mayall and Jeff Beck. Fans of Led Zeppelin won't find any lost gems here, but this collection does shine a light on Page's successful pre-Zep music career. [Castle issued a remastered edition in 2007.]
