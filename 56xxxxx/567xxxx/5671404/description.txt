Game info:

  Assume the role of a farmer and experience the 18 hours-a-day lifestyle
  of running a busy farm in the middle of beautiful, rolling countryside.
  You start the game by choosing from a small collection of basic vehicles
  and machinery to explore your fairly sparce farmland which measures a
  mere 4 km2. As you progress through the game youâ€™ll need to visit the
  local agricultural machinery store to trade in your old vehicles and
  equipment for newer kit. Here you can choose tractors and combine
  harvesters from Fendt and Poettinger agricultural plant and machinery.

  The original machines available in Farming Simulator are still available
  for use - seven beautifully detailed tractors, four combine harvesters
  and over 20 tools such as a plough, seeder, baler and a self loading
  wagon. Plus all the new toys to play with! Donâ€™t forget too that
  Farming Simulator is MOD-friendly so if you are still looking for
  more vehicles, equipment and modifications you can download these from
  the Internet!

  Farming Simulator also contains various missions and tutorials to
  complete as well as featuring a realistic day-and-night cycle with
  changing weather conditions. As a modern farmer you can also activate
  computer-controlled vehicles which will help you get your work done.
