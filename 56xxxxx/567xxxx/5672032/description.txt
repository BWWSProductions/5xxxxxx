Dance Academy, Season 1 Episode 24, low quality as I had to grab and join it fromof all places lol. But since they currently aren't available anywhere else I thought I'd upload it.

Will do Episode 25 later tonight or tomorrow. Episode 26 not out yet. And yes it's watchable, if you want HD wait for one of the other guys to grab a tv rip but if you're just dying to see what happens in the next two eps this should suffice.

In this episode Catrina and Ethans' dad comes to town to direct the end of year dance performance of the Nutcracker. Cat isn't sure she wants to stay at the academy and Ethan is at odds with his Dad over whether or not he has what it takes to make his way in the pro dance world after turning down the companies contract offer.

Meanwhile Abigail learns her parents are splitting up and Sam discovers he has feelings for Christian.
