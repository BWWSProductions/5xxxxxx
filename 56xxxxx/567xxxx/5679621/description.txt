The John Lennon Video Collection 1993
Full Screen Mode 4:3
Running time 80 mts.
This is the Laser Disc version of the same VHS version.
Both VHS & Laser Disc were released in 1993

(this compilation has re-mastered video but many videos have been altered or changed completely..
it also pissed off many people that bought it thinking they were getting the same video they were familiar with.
One example I'll give myself is the Happy X-Mas Video..
The one that John & Yoko released with their single shows them playing with Sean in the snow; the kids choir singing..etc.
The video on Legends shows dismembered bodies, starving people,etc..total opposite
Also through out the entire DVD there are sutle reminders that John Lennon is dead....kind of strange to me..
Many attribute Yoko for all these radical changes in the videos being she has control over them..
However the choice is an individual one...Me? I have them both so I' can't complain.
(I'll be getting to that DVD release shortly)
Both the VHS & Laser Disc contain the original videos as released. It's my understanding besides video quality.
the VHS was MONO and the Laser Disc STEREO.
Personally I like parts of both ...so it's almost impossible to choose between the two if one had too.
