--------------------------------+ Notes +-------------------------------------

    From the depths of Brisbane's conservative right, also known   
    as the one and only suburb of Mansfield, fully encompassed by  
    the holy postcode, 4122, comes Violent Soho. The members of    
    the group, Luke Boerdam (Vocals, Guitars), James Tidswell      
    (Guitars), Luke Henery (Bass) and Michael Richards (Drums).    
    Violent Soho began playing music together in their teens, who  
    embraced an 80's and 90's punk-grunge impact to their music    
    without disregarding the ethic that ideally follows from such  
    influence. The band has since then gone on its way to          
    creating an energetic live show. From its beginnings, playing  
    shows at outer-suburban pubs and rehearsing and recording      
    demos in their parents' garages. Violent Soho has toured       
    extensively across the globe as well as played shows with      
    such bands as Dinosaur Jr, Built to Spill, Trail of Dead, The  
    Black Keys, The Bronx, Black Francis, Dead Weather, The        
    Grates, Grinspoon, Cosmic Psychos, Celibate Rifles, Hard-Ons,  
    and others. They've played many festivals around Australia     
    including Homebake, Meredith, Falls Festival, Laneway          
    Festival and featured on this year's line-up for Download      
    festival in the UK. The band signed an overwhelmingly          
    exciting deal with Ecstatic Peace/Universal Motown US - a      
    totally ace label headed up by none other than Sonic Youth's   
    Thurston Moore (obviously a major hero to VS as the front man  
    to one of the greatest bands ever). This of course is pretty   
    much the band's biggest dream come true, so obviously they     
    are over the moon at the opportunity to be backed by such a    
    man & the prospect of spending a lot of 2009 in the USA        
    releasing their debut album in March 2010 and touring.
