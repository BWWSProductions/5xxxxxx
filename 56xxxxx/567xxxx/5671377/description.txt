     Gregoire is a happily wedded father of three young girls,
     an independent film producer who somehow manages to juggle
     the never-ending demands of his company with his domestic
     responsibilities. Married to his cellphone and chain-smoking
     his way through endless rounds of meetings and crises, he
     maintains his sense of humour despite incessant demands from
     the difficult Swedish auteur he has always wanted to produce
     and the arrival of a group from Korea doing preproduction
     work on a new film. In addition to massaging artistic egos,
     his job involves trying to keep one step ahead of his bank
     and financing is always an interminable headache. When his
     wife, Sylvia, insists that he join the family on an Italian
     holiday, Gregoire finds he can no longer maintain any sane
     balance. Returning to Paris, he confronts the biggest 
     challenge of his career  with unexpected consequences.
