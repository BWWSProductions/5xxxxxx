Build your own Medieval world in A Kingdom for Keflings, a city-building game from NinjaBee.

Play as a giant to help the tiny Keflings build up and beautify their Kingdom. Start out small, unlocking new blueprints, buildings and tasks as you work towards designing and building a Kefling castle. Create your own private world, or construct a kingdom with your friends online!

Fun and direct interaction with Keflings including carrying them around, assigning jobs to them and training them to do simple tasks

Extensive customization of the city through personally building each building, customizing the look and color of buildings, and decorating the village with additional elements such as trees, topiaries and statues

The ability to build cities online cooperatively with your friends

Stylized animated graphics that change with the seasons, season-based gameplay, and a dynamic-music soundtrack (which adapts to the season) give the game an unusually strong sense of life and activity
