,catamaranman,2010-07-10T10:01Z,"What a great movie.....I avoided it like the plague because people seemed to hate it so much and felt it was so different than the original.  If you\'re like I was, dont waste another minute!  This movie is great and stayed true enough to the original.  Acting is great, CGI is every bit as good as Rings trilogy I cant attest to the quality of this file but the movie is definitely worth a watch...."
,martian_neighbour,2010-07-10T10:21Z,Thanks for the upload .BONE.nnI bet 95% of these leechers are Americunts who just hit and run and doesn\'t seed even a byte. Greedy fuckers.

,LonePigsy,2010-07-26T03:43Z,You've heard it before but I'll say it again: this movie sucks. The original is much better. How does Hollywood fuck up these remakes so bad? 
,moonrunner99,2010-07-30T09:27Z,"JK-ONE MPAABuster isn't saying the file is a fake, only that they are watching this download and threatening people who download it."

Not gonna lie, had this downloaded within minutes!!
It must be the fact that I keep my upload ratio relatively high!!"
,poweritup,2010-07-31T11:49Z,They Sent me warning when i downloaded this movie then 1 day later i downloaded karate kid then they shutted down my internet for 2 days and wont allow me to send out any information.. that meens only go on facebook and stuff not even msn:( So be carefull they cant take all of you but they can take someone
,moonrunner99,2010-08-02T06:13Z,"get a good proxy service, it costs money, but better than paying outrageously exaggerated and exploitative prices for DVDs and Digital downloads which even when you ""own"" they still control what you can do with it. "
,jonesa601,2010-08-03T04:57Z,MPAABuster wasn't kidding. I downloaded this (didn't watch it or anything yet) and was notified about it.
,kamakazikiddo,2010-08-04T19:29Z,"MPAA Buster was right, I just dl'd it using U-torrent and got a call from.  1*877*647*2633, guessing my ISP gave them my cell # and they called saying I dl'd clash of the Titan's."
,marvinisking,2010-08-05T00:08Z,"for all of you saying that your internet was shut down after downloading ILLEGAL rips, are you surprised? haha leech at your own risk, but as for the rest of us, we'll be fine(:

,spamh8r08,2010-08-10T08:29Z,"this movie is fucking bad ass!!! yet it should NOT be called ""clash of the titans"" it should be called ""persius"". dont expect the same movie we grew up with because its not at all the same but still a good movie none the less. v10 a10  ""clash of the titans""=m0 but ""persius""=m8"
,spamh8r08,2010-08-10T08:38Z,"700gb movies im fine just make sure to not be a bitch and go to the ""watch it free""-sites that require you to give them personal information and/or take surveys that require personal info. such as an ip-address, a phone number, a zip code, home adress, first and last name, or credit card info. heres my favorite ""sign up for verison wireless and watch movies before they hit theatres"""

And for fuck's sake stop moaning how every re-make sucks, when the fuck will you learn that this shit isn't a re-make it's a re-imagining, if you can't tell the difference stick to barney and pokemon."

,greylion,2010-08-22T21:42Z,"V: 5
A: 7.5
This is just one of those movies, that are too long to compress down to a 1-CD rip, even with a low-end 624x256 resolution.
The video bitrate also reveals it; as soon as you go much below 1000-900 kbps, the quality suffers greatly.
I expected better from DiAMOND."

,Haynesie09,2010-11-15T03:42Z,"Sorry .Bone. to use your comments to argue but i have to acknowledge the extreme stupidity that shinobiXRT is displaying, granted not all wars are fought over religion but at least 50% are, and the whole point in being an atheist is that it ISN'T a religion genius.

Very good quality torrent, pretty bad movie in my opinion."
,N3tw0rkbomb3r,2011-02-15T12:03Z,Great quality and awesome sound. Thanks man. SEED mother fuckers!!!!
,ReesyKing223,2011-03-12T05:29Z,"@shinobiXRT Wow dude, are you really such a jesus freak that you have let the devils in the church make you believe that all atheists are criminals? I'm a atheist and haven't committed a crime, I'm a atheist simply because I believe God truly can't exist with so much bad going on in this world, answer me this: If there really is a ""god"" why do good people die young? and bad people get what they want when they want?

Need I say more? hahahaha ignorance is bliss for the religion freaks out there."
,bigtimegeek,2011-04-06T22:30Z,"My lord, it's kind of hilarious how much disinformation and scare tactics has been used on this one torrent.

A virus in the file, MPAA letters, SEED MORE TO GET MORE SPEED (untrue, patently untrue.  If you seed at all, though, you can get an MPAA letter.  That's why leechers exist.  Your download speed is affected by solely two things on an unratio'd public tracker : your download limits, and their upload limits.  Everything else is bullshit.  Those telling you to seed more to get more speed are people trying to bust you or idiots.  It's hard to get a faster download when you are seeding, since seeding happens when you are DONE downloading).

However, this entire torrent and the discussion therein is a little besides the point.  This may be the most popular torrent for Clash on TPB right now, but it's listed as a DVDRip, and it is NOT a DVDRip.  Find another torrent and you'll get better quality out of it."
,Cesmo,2011-05-16T05:10Z,Good torrent Bone.A:8 V:8 
,nuroticblade,2011-05-30T18:42Z,"Thanks bone. And for the love of god would you idiots learn to rate Audio and Video. Your morons giving DVD QUALITY torrents a 5/5 really? Go back to school and as always dont hit and run, seed so others can also enjoy the stuff TBP works to keep free. Again Great job Bone."
,zysronnorsyz,2011-07-26T21:30Z,"i cant keep my mouth shut on this i'm neither athiest or a religous freak

but 'god' gives us the choice to do as we wish(hence violence death and greed etc) 
'god' set down some ground rules (i think we all know what those are) but most people dont follow them

now weather there is a god or not people will do what they want
and those ground rules are just general ideals that would bring about peace and happy ness if EVERYBODY followed them.

so eaither way dont kill dont rape dont steal... 

symantics: all you heavy religous people shouldnt even be on this site (thou shall not steal) lol so  dont preach about god unless your going to follow his rules!"
,lotusclown,2011-09-27T08:00Z,"shinobi-   they'll understand one day when they're roasting in pit,  lost and forgotten..   intill then,   let them continue on they're stupid little delusional suicide path..   v10/a10   this movie sucks monkey fuck!!!!   stick to the original.."
,69rush69,2011-12-20T01:11Z,"lol @shinobiXRT the most gruesome evil war that ever was(The crusades) was in the name of god and most wars until recently have also been around religion.
