[T],grimreaper420,2010-07-18T08:32Z,"What i find very interesting is i wonder if mollatira really uploaded this....his last upload was on  Feb 25, 2007, and looking @ his previous torrents why this one ?
He was in the scene up to 2007, then disappeared.

I'm betting he didn't upload this, someone else did."

,haqqnuru,2010-07-22T12:36Z,"I downloaded it and whenb I installed, it tells me it is searching for the latest version. After that it tells me to install the latest version it downloaded while it has not downloaded anything. 
when you open the start menu, openoffice has a folder with only uninstalled.
does somebody has an idea how I can install it?"
