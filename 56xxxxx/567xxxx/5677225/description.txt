Adapted by Donald Campbell
Music by David Doorwood and Cappella Nova
Directed by Hamish Wilson
Broadcast February 8, 1993 in the Monday Play series
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

The first two books of the Hugo Award winning
novel about a post-apocalyptic/nuclear holocaust
damaged world.

I made this tape in 1991 from a BBC Radio 4 broadcast.
I don't have the exact date, and I don't know if it
was the original broadcast. I do know that it was also
broadcast February 8, 1993. Whatever. This is a good
clean complete file.
