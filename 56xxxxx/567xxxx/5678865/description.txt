Gangstar: West Coast Hustle
Description
ΓÇ£This is a game that flaunts a lot of bling - slick visuals, functional controls, challenging missions - and it far surpasses any previous effort at open world gameplay on iPhone. ΓÇ£ (PocketGamer. 8/10, Silver Award).

"The iPhone has so far seen both 2D (Car Jack Streets) and 2.5D (Payback) GTA clones but, as yet, iPhone gamers have not had a fully 3D world in which to wreak the particular sort of inner-city mayhem that has made the genre so popular. Thanks to Gameloft, that's about to change." (Touch Arcade)

"An open-world crime epic is pretty ambitious for the iPhone (ΓÇª) but it looks like Gameloft has assembled the tech to make it happen" (IGN)
