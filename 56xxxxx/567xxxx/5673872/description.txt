  Tiki Bar TV is a web series video podcast. Produced in an apartment Tiki bar on a low budget, the humorous and heavily ad-libbed show is a creative outlet for its creators Jeff Macpherson and Kevin Gamble. Each episode features a problem that is rectified by the episode's namesake cocktail, which is scribbled on a prescription pad by Dr. Tiki (Macpherson) and "filled" by the bartender Johnny Johnny (Gamble) who explains the construction of the cocktail. Lala is the Tiki Bar's primary denizen who opens each episode with a dance.
