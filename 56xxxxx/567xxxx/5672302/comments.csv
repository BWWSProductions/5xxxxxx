[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-07T02:48Z,"Hey Bro yeah I got sandlot. I thought I had uploaded already which is really weird because I have rookie of the year for the love of the game the sandlot the rookie angels in the outfield and little big league lol. Maybe I got distracted from my baseball movie uploads back in the day. Yup I'm going to be uploading 3 trilogies next. Rush Hour, Pirates, and Lord of the rings. Then it will be Harry Potter all 6 of them and the Matrix collection."

[T],ctang,2010-07-07T21:36Z,do you find it weird that not many people are downloading our movie lists...we both get lots of requests and some people saying to put up a list and then only 17 seeders and 0 leachers...whats up with that and mines even worse...wtf people
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-08T00:19Z,Hey Ctang yea that's messed about the damn lists oh well. As for the Matrix Imma upload them as DVD5. There is no reason to upload as DVD9 since I make the cleanest cut copies of DVD5 you can possible get your hands on.
