,moodude,2010-07-06T03:31Z,Will review torrent after finished torrenting.
,moodude,2010-07-06T04:05Z,"Okay guys this is in .mkv format so if you can't get it to play (most default programs will be itunes) 

Download VLC Media Player (it's free and is a Pirate's best friend for Coded movies)

Here's my review:
1)The video is awesome. Very nice. Not grainy or blurry at all.
2) The audio is very clear and fits the images.
3)SUBS ARE IN ENGLISH!!!! YAAAAY for English subbed HSOTD
4)The torrent was very fast(although this can change seeing as how there are 76 seeders and 34 leechers atm)
5)GREAT TORRENT! Pass it a long and share with others!!

Never let this ship sink! KEEP SEEDING!!"
,moodude,2010-07-06T04:06Z,ALSO as a side note I forgot to mention the Audio is in Japanese
