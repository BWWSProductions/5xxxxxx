Given that it this is a pirate site,and we as individuals,do not follow the proverbial ""drummer"",I still do not think this would be the best interest in the grand scheme of things. 
It is however,an interesting subject."

,zappaz123,2010-08-04T21:06Z,"LOVE IS IN THE AIR (John Paul Young)

Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees
Love is in the air
In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

(Chorus)
Love is in the air
Love is in the air"

Oh, irontowngeek you would be surprised that Airbus pilots are on TPB too and you should just stick to gay porns. Some of us have some Airbus things to revise on. "
