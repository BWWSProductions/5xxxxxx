The Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM) is published as a supplement to the
Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and is designed to provide pilots with
practical information on how to operate the Airbus aircraft. It should be read in
conjunction with the FCOM. In the case of any conflict, the FCOM is the overriding
authority.

Airline training policy may differ in certain areas. Should this be the case, the
airline training policy is the over-riding authority.
