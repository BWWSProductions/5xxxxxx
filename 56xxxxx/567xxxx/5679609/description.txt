NOTE: Glad to see ya back around KB. Cant wait for ya to get back in action. :D Continuing the legacy of great quality, KiNGDOM releases... ;)  I know, I know. "A v3. WTF?" :lol: I wasnt all here when I did v1 and v2 v1 I had blew it on the AR v2 I blew it on the colors. I was trying to stay up to late to do it. I payed for it at work today on 2 hrs of sleep. Now onto the release, I used the XViDS like everyone else has on the 2 previous releases, but on this one I used the Source DVD. I think it is much better this time around this one has the original ac3 256kb/s audio. Correct AR and upped the bitrate quite abit. I think its generally better. I did not blur the subs on this one , but I am going to do 2 of these 1 blurred and one not. TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. ;)
