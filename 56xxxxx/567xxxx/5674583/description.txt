Dance Academy, Episode 26 (which I believe is the final episode of season 1).

Again, low quality and a few blips from having to join them into one clip, but perfectly watchable if you want to see how the season ends without waiting for the other guys to do an HD rip (I can't do HD rips of this show, doesn't even air in my country so I have to grab it where I can).

In this episode:

Tara fights to keep the lead role in the final end of year production while Abigail does her best to mess with her head hoping to steal the job. 

Sam worries when his father pulls his funding to keep attending the academy. Cat plots to run away with Myles while Ethan decides to keep the job as his fathers assistant. Also, Christian tries to figure out where to spend the summer holidays.
