,redactedwv,2011-05-04T21:29Z,"subs for most of these eps (series 1-3 & 7-14) have recently gone up on addic7ed. 

i've encoded up to s11 so far....started with the new subs @ s7...only prob so far was s11 eps 1 and 2 - didn't sync right, came in late as i recall.

 All others have been clean & accurate.

thx to all seeders/leechers, the original uppers, and the person who combined/upped this megaseed. Thx to SnowManUK99 for making it avail here (double if you created it SMUK99). Thanks a lot, all. 

Thx also to addic7ed and the uppers there (in case they see this). 

Sincere thx all!"
,redactedwv,2011-05-08T05:11Z,"sadly, i need to update.

lots of problems with season 11 subs. they seem accurate, but all of them of out of synch. if you're able to resynch, they're worth working on, but otherwise i'd skip 'em (i've encoded up to 11-8...all wrong so far)"
,redactedwv,2011-05-17T00:20Z,"S12 subs @ the source i mentioned are good thus far (the only subs listed there at the moment.... the 'Version PDTV.thebox.hannibal' subs, to be specific), and i've just finished encoding ep 9.

As far as i've been able to find, they're the only ones floating around, but i figured it would still be worth mentioning that they do in fact sync up (unlike S11).

If i don't update, the rest of S12 subs are properly sync'd to this release as well."
,redactedwv,2011-05-30T05:59Z,"last update: the subs for both 12 and 13 are solid (they are not part of the torrent, but are available @ another site mentioned in my previous posts above)."
,redactedwv,2011-06-05T08:01Z,"Sorry.... knew i'd regret posting that before the last ep was encoded. The subs for the second part of S13E10 are out of sync. Other than that, season 12 and 13 subs are good.

------------

Final rundown of the addic7ed subs for this series (currently only one srt has been uploaded for each ep).....

Any subs from season 1 thru season 6: They weren't up when i encoded my copies, can't speak to the accuracy/sync of any of them.

Seasons 7 - 10: accurate and in sync.

Season 11: accurate, but all are out of sync.

Seasons 12 & 13: accurate and in sync, except for the last episode of season 13 (which seemed accurate, but were out of sync).

Really sorry for all the posts guys.... Should have just summed it all up when i was finished."
,ghost3783,2011-07-04T23:24Z,"Hello everyone,
I've got a strange problem. Divx plays about half of the episodes I downloaded, for the rest it says 'download additional directshow filters'. I've downloaded all kind of filters and packs from the internet, even the full Klite pack, but none work. Any tips to what filter I need?"
