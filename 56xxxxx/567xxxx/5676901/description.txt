        The heat is on

        When  a  sudden,   unexplained  rise  in   local  temperatures
        threatens to  turn the  city of  Los Angeles  into a  lifeless
        desert,  one  lone  scientist believes  she  knows  why it  is
        happening. But, in order to prove her theory, she must  expose
        the  greed of  a giant  corporation out  to make  millions of
        dollars. It's now  a race against  time to stop  a catastrophe
        from happening and save the lives of those she loves.
