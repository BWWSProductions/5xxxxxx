Episode 25, again low quality but watchable enough if you can't wait for an HD rip.

HD rips of Episode 24 are now up from at least 2 of the other major uploaders, but I'm still seeding mine after a delay due to a software glitch. But if you want higher quality grab one of the others, I will stop seeding episode 24 tomorrow and just seed 25 until the others have higher quality versions up. Will also do 26 whenever I can find it.

In this episode:

Cat reunites with pop star Myles and considers running off with him, Tara gets the lead in the end of year production but isn't sure she's good enough to actually pull it off, Abigail stews over being Tara's understudy and her parents breakup. 

Meanwhile Sam struggles to understand his feelings for Christian and is eventually forced to tell Christian the truth. Ethan also struggles to adjust to his new job as his fathers assistant and whether he really even wants the job.
