NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Killers R5

Sources used was the russian dvd 9 and orcs audio....many thanks to both
The video was pretty nice for a R5 but had a few issues.....to us it seemed a little dark,tint of yellow to it and also
the sharpness is poor.
Audio,really nice direct line....wish all line was this nice ;-)
Work done,was firstly we ripped the dvd9 and used a few filters via a script and some plugins .....the main stuff we messed
with was the colouring and brightness.We increased the chroma slightly and brightness,also we used a white balance script
and also added some sharpness to it.
The audio ....for this we synced the orcs audio to the rip and used the audio off the dvd9 for the end credits.

Enjoy.
