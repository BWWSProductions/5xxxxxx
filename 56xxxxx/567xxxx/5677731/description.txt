Theologian, ufologist, and author Patrick Cooke discussed prophecy and how it relates to current events, as well as UFOs, aliens, and various types of paranormal activity. Mayan prophecies don't speak of an apocalyptic end, but do foretell that our world will join with the Netherworld or spiritual world, he noted. The prophecies from the Book of Revelation are almost exclusively environmental in nature, such as a verse from Revelation 8:8 describing "a great mountain burning with fire" being cast into the sea, turning part of the sea to blood, and ocean life dying. A number of other biblical & Hopi prophecies mention the sea turning black, which could relate to the current Gulf oil spill, he added. 

Cooke believes there are also prophecies about global economic control, and that the "mark of the Beast" refers to corporations or big banking cartels taking over the way people can buy or sell. We're going to see more environmental damage and control over our lives unless we stop the corporations from the direction they're rapidly moving in, he warned. 

The terms angels and aliens can be used synonymously, said Cooke, who also talked about his research into the stone chambers of New England, and crop circles & cattle mutilations. Interestingly, he reported that particles of pure iron are found near the bodies of mutilated cattle as well as at crop circle formation sites. Such particles would be very difficult and expensive to produce, he detailed.
