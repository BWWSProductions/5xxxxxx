Lyrics:

When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go ...
Don't let go ...
To my love

(Chorus)
I hate to see you cry,
Your smile is a beautiful lie.
I hate to see you cry,
My love is dying inside.

I can fix all those lies
Oh, baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you.

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my toughts
Can you promise we won't let go
All the things that I need,
All the things that you need,
You can make it feel so real.

'Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm losing control

'Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I see you baby
I just don't wanna let go

When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one ...

(Chorus)
I hate to see you cry,
Your smile is a beautiful lie.
I hate to see you cry,
My love is dying inside.

I can fix all those lies
Oh, baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you.

Oh, baby, I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air, when I'm not with you
Please, don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I.
