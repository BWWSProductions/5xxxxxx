,zirali,2010-07-14T07:42Z,Hi thanks for the u/l and I too had the same issue as critic_101 with the ps3 as when I played the Losers the quality was  amazing but Cinavia kept blocking the sound every few mins damn those people what can we do? Is there another blu ray rip for the Ps3 that works without sound issues relating to Cinavia? Any help much appreciated thanks
