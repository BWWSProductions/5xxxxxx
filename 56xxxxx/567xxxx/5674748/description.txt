This is my own hand-scanned copy of Andrew Hurley's 'Collected Fictions of Borges' from Penguin. There has been another txt-conversion of this book floating about the interwebs for a few years, but without being unkind, its quality is shite - it's obviously a hasty OCR job with no editing.

This is a PDF of the actual book, optimized to be read on an e-reader if you like. Enjoy, and seed!
