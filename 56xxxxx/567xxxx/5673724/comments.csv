,stoiclotus,2010-08-02T02:26Z,Thank you Gypsy (^_^)
,Jordan21,2010-08-22T19:34Z,"The Black Keys are definitely one of the greatest bands of our time if not all time. Please support them in any way you can by buying their albums and going to see their concerts, or at least buying their merchandise. These guys are the real deal and remind us all of how bad mainstream music has strayed away from decent and talented music...Love them so much. Please buy their albums or go see them live, they are INCREDIBLE live. So much energy from just 2 guys."

,xefermix,2010-12-13T06:05Z,"Is there any reason that nothing is capitalized in the id3 tags? 
Other than that solid upload, thanks for the quality stuff."
,X--GYPSY--X,2010-12-21T03:31Z,"caps? you are really bitching about capitalization in the tags? wow... There are no caps in the ID3 tags because i don't like my tags capped, it doesn't look good on my car stereo... tell you what get id3 Tag-it (http://www.id3-tagit.de/) 

you can change the capitalization to your hearts desire in one fell swoop, even has a wizard to change tags and file names by rule... knock yourself out."
,purpl3,2010-12-24T19:51Z,"thanks for the upload :D
TBK are awesome, and, they come from my home town."
,knotoftoads,2011-01-02T23:53Z,"New fan (from about 20 minutes ago, and the first note). (don't yell at me) A friend mentioned them a while back, and I didn't follow up, but then he didn't really explain. So don't yell at me.
Thanks for the upload, because if you like them, you'll want everything. And this will be enough to keep me busy for a while. Just don't yell at me.
And thanks for the high bit rates. I can't understand why people upload at lower rates. WTF? Yes, I'm yelling, I like to yell.
So much good music to discover. "

That's bad, man"
,pat_man,2011-02-03T17:08Z,"I only ever buy about two albums a year, by artists I REALLY like. The Black Keys have that distinction almost every year."
,musicgoround3,2011-02-14T18:24Z,"My buddy introduced me to this band, whenever they come to town we are going!"

,Mat2001uk,2011-03-15T01:23Z,"Just to say, I already have All of these albums, but can't be bothered to rip them, so am downloading them from here. 

If you also like them put your hand in your pocket. No other band today is as deserving.

Cheers."
,Mat2001uk,2011-03-15T01:24Z,p.s. Thanks especially for the generous info section - I read it all and found out a few things I didn't know :)

,lord_kushington,2011-07-07T20:33Z,"This has bent my head.
Quality discography."
,Beolab1700,2011-09-13T23:51Z,"Probably the best band out there at the moment... thank god for The 'keys and Seasick Steve or I'd just give up listening to 'new' music.   Great upload, but it is missing the ""Live In Concert May 13, 2008"" CD, so to complete the discography your gonna need that one! "
,Beolab1700,2011-10-01T15:18Z,"Check these guys out... very similar sound to TBK's

,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T07:13Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!

PS dBpoweramp is FANTASTIC ripping software!"
