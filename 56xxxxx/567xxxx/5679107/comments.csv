,Gmod4phun,2010-07-30T10:54Z,Works perfectly.All weapons are unlocked.Bots are working too.But when i try to connect to a server it says that The server is using an older version of game.Can you write a IP of some servers that have this version of the game? Oh and after you extracted it you must select properties on the Team fortress 2 shortcut and write the path of the game because its selected to the archive.
,ill_informed,2010-07-31T22:30Z,@Gmod4phun what do i write the path as? i dont want to mess anything up after downloading for 2 days... plz help someone!
,ill_informed,2010-07-31T22:35Z,what should i rewrite as? and in which box? thank you
,ill_informed,2010-08-01T06:45Z,"ok i got it.the ""fl2.exe."" and whatever was after that....... you have to put that behind your path on the target part.... but i cant play online :[ kinda bummed but plaing against bots is worth it"
,Xenon13,2010-08-06T02:08Z,"@ill_informed Can you please specify that? I dont understand. I right click Team Fortress 2 > then change the target everytime, it says the start in is not valid?? Help please!"
,Xenon13,2010-08-06T02:31Z,"I GOT IT. But now it says ""No permission to run ""tf"""" I ran it as admin and it keep saying it... HELP PLEASE ANYONE"

,Davf126,2010-08-09T15:04Z,"1. Has anyone figured out how to run it ? Give me instructions please
2. Does Multi player work
3.What if theirs a new update then can you update it ? "
,XenTownsend,2010-08-14T23:57Z,"@Xenon13 Don't run Steam at the same time.

There is a shortcut in the unrar'd TF2 folder; edit that to point to the hl2.exe (do not edit the tags added after ""hl2.exe"").

I'm running a Hamachi server if anyone wants a game: TF2-XenLabs (pass: aybabtu)."
,XenTownsend,2010-08-15T10:02Z,"If anyone wants to know how to change your name to something other than ArcticOne, open the rev.ini file in the main TF2 folder, scroll down past the ###NOTE###, and next to ""PlayerName = "", enter your desired name."
,josekrlos,2010-08-18T18:50Z,hey i downloaded it and all but when i wanna play or go to training my PC resets and i can play how do i fix this or what?
,zalfuse,2010-08-22T17:32Z,"this works what you need to do is go into the folder make a shortcut of hl2 then right team fortress shortcut and copy everything after ""hl2.exe"" and go to the property of the hl2 short cut you made and paste it and there the game works idk about playing online tho"
,maummamoi,2010-08-24T08:28Z,"Please somebody make a video , how to launch tf 2!
I have tryed everithing to launch the game.
I have Win7 this makes senses?

Video pls to launch teamfortress 2!"
,ismoArr,2010-08-29T07:59Z,How can I get that damned bday mode off? tf_birthday doesn't seem to work...
,donuteater15,2010-09-02T21:10Z,"what i like
precracked: ready to play
high avarage seed: fast download
my chair: comfortable :D"
,Arctic0ne,2010-09-06T19:35Z,"Ok, this really isn't that difficult.

1. If you have extracted TF2 to anywhere besides ""D:\TF2\"" then you need to right click the ""Team Fortress 2"" shortcut and change the target to reflect where you extracted it to. Do NOT edit any of the parameters (The things with a ""-"" in front of them), this will cause the game not to run.

2. You can't have Steam running while you play, otherwise it will check Steam to see if you actually own the game, which you obviously don't.

Hadn't realized how difficult simple tasks can be -sigh-"
,donuteater15,2010-09-14T16:24Z,"FOR VISTA ONLY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if you run vista and you still have the error:''no permissions to run tf'' this is anoying T_T
i know solution: press start, press your picture(you will see:''useraccounts''), press the last button in the middle with the administator sign in front of it, check the box, reboot pc, play game
like Artic0ne says:''Ok, this really isn't that difficult.''"
,donuteater15,2010-09-14T16:28Z,"i lil change in my guide:''check the box'' ignore that and change it to:''uncheck the box''

im done now. hope yall get it now ma vista friends

time to make my escape, later"
,nokiahaler,2010-09-23T15:36Z,"is it just me or when the announcer speaks, the game slows down big time? either it's when she speaks or when control points are taken over. also, how do i add bots in other maps that move like the ones in offline practice?"
,dethclok565,2010-10-08T01:17Z,what version is this?
,jokkobengo,2010-10-12T20:34Z,"I works just fine, but!
Can't you play any other map than Dustbowl on Attack/Defend?"
,aixerihp,2010-10-23T22:06Z,"i changed the path properly (all you really need to do is create a shortcut to hl2 and copy/paste the add ons from the original shortcut), but whenever i try to start it, it shows the classes and says loading for about 5 seconds, then the screen goes black and it doesnt respond"
,brownyboo,2010-11-01T21:26Z,"thank you !! works perfectly fine  just there are not much servers to play only 5 of which for some reason cant join any .. i hope u guys join soon

,Helper1337,2011-04-10T20:22Z,"@Xenon13 You may close your steam before running ""tf2"",""css"" and many games from steam cracked."
,remie234,2011-04-17T20:03Z,"Have the same problem  as Icybeach  
"" It cant  unzip. it says it is brocken or something"""
,remie234,2011-04-17T20:07Z,"Aaa ok , too unzip you must download the latest winrar (.92 ) "
,Barroquecore,2011-05-24T12:43Z,"Was functioning perfectly about three months ago, then since around mid-April it won't let me use the items anymore. I can still play but with regular items."
,Ghunter43,2011-06-20T15:57Z,"It works i swear! lol, but before i bought TF2 (if you're wondering, i want this torrent cuz i want to play som LAN with some friends, they don't have TF2 steam) i used this torrent to play a bit. It's fun to see bots trying to kill you while with better weapons that theirs. besides, if you wanna see someone rage, just dominate a bot and type this in console: kick [Bot name]"
