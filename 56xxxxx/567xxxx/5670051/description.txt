http://leetleech.org/images/50088384306083144980.jpg


From childhood prodigy to veteran master, Birmingham-born Steve Winwood's
extraordinary career is like a map of the major changes in British rock 'n' roll
and rhythm and blues from the 1960s to the present. This in-depth profile traces
that journey and reveals a master musician blending Ray Charles and English
hymnody into a unique brand of English soul.

From the blues-boom-meets-beat-group chart hits of the Spencer Davis Group,
through the psychedelic pop of early Traffic and into Berkshire as Traffic
become the first band to 'get their heads together in a country cottage', then via
a brief sojourn in supergroup Blind Faith and back to Traffic as a jam band who
conquer the emerging American rock scene, Winwood's first ten years on the
boards were extraordinary.

As the 80s dawned he reinvented himself as a solo artist and became a major
star in the US with hits like Higher Love and Back in the High Life. These days
he's back in arenas, touring with old friend Eric Clapton.

Paul Bernay's film blends extensive interviews with Winwood in his
Gloucestershire home and film of Winwood's first return to that Berkshire
cottage since 1969 with rare archive footage and contributing interviews with
Eric Clapton, Paul Rodgers, Paul Jones, Paul Weller, Muff Winwood, Dave
Mason and more.
