THE BEST MEDIA PLAYER I HAVE EVER SEEN
VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and framework, that plays most multimedias files, medias and streaming protocols.

It is simple to use, yet very powerful and extendable
FEATURES
1---Ready for HD

    * GPU decoding on Windows Vista and 7, using DxVA2 for H.264, VC-1 and MPEG-2
    * GPU decoding on GNU/Linux, using VAAPI for H.264, VC-1 and MPEG-2

    * Improved support for MKV HD, including seeking fixes, and 7.1 channels codecs
    * Support for new codecs, like Blu-Ray subtitles, MPEG-4 lossless and VP8

NB: so far, on Windows for GPU decoding, VideoLAN is recommending nVidiaÂ® GPU, until ATIÂ® drivers are working with VLC architecture, and until the VLC developers get access to some IntelÂ® hardware supporting GPU decoding.
