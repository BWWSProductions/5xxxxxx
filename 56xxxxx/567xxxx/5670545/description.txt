There are indeed no words to describe this extraordinary recording. Bach composed it and J.E. Gardiner performs it exquisitely. Never in my life I have been that impressed. "Herr, unser Herrscher", the crowning chorus, made me literally crying. "Von den stricken", "Eilt, ihr angefochtenen sunden", "Zerfliesse, mein herze", everything is almost excrutiatingly beautiful, divine.

And all these sincere recommendations from someone always restrined in giving good reviews. Yet, this work and the way it's performed are, with the risk of repeting myself, beyond words.
