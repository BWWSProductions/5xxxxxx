Hahahaha  An R5 is a dvd

Noooooooob"
,dlarrym,2010-07-08T01:03Z,"@virusfree,  is correct. R5, is a region number and refers to releases made to be released in Russia and a few other countries, but it also means it is from a DVD or SCREENER, so R5 itself is a designation, but on TPB, it refers to a DVDrip that originated in the REGION 5 (R5) area of the world. SO you are the NEWB!"
