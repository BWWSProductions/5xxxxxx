This widget imitates the Clock on HTC's Sense UI. It was available in the market for FREE until HTC got it taken down due to a copyright claim.

This is the final version, until it returns to the market with a new look.

It works perfectly on HVGA devices (320x480) and I'm pretty sure it works on QVGA (240x320) and WVGA (480x800, 480x854) also.
