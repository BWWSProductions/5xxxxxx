Insurance investigator and reformed gambler John (Steve Buscemi) faces some old demons on a business trip to Las Vegas, where he and his hotshot colleague (Romany Malco) must investigate a wheelchair-bound stripper (Emmanuelle Chriqui) trying to collect on a big claim for lost wages. Writer-director Hue Rhodes's stylish and darkly offbeat feature debut -- inspired by Dante's Inferno -- also stars Sarah Silverman as John's quirky girlfriend, Jill.
