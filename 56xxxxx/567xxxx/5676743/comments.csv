,catamaranman,2010-07-10T10:04Z,"What a great movie.....I avoided it like the plague because people seemed to hate it so much and felt it was so different than the original.  If you\'re like I was, dont waste another minute!  This movie is great and stayed true enough to the original.  Acting is great, CGI is every bit as good as Rings trilogy I cant attest to the quality of this file but the movie is definitely worth a watch...."

,Emperawr,2011-02-22T00:08Z,Way to many people with huge pumpous self righteos sticks up thier asses trying to comment on this movie. It was a very well done movie and I have seen the original at least a dozen times in my life. And for all the people that just wanna talk trash about it WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU MADE LATELY? HUH? TELL ME WHAT FANTASTICALLY GROUNDBREAKING FILMS HAVE TO DIRECTED? Oh Zero? Well then I guess your not really qualified for comment. So when youve made something of value and quality in your life that would give it meaning then you will be able to comment on the quality of this and other films
,TheOriginalDaniel,2011-03-14T12:09Z,seed anyone? im connected to like 35seeders to  5peers yet im getting 30kb/s? what the hells with that? lol thanks for the movie in advance
,uppers_and_downers,2011-05-05T16:55Z,10/10 THANKS AGAIN
,southak,2011-07-08T17:07Z,@ Emperawr - so the only people allowed to criticise films you like are movie directors? We all have our opinions just because they are not the same as your don't go into one.
,JohnnyRayRay,2011-08-22T01:49Z,Emperawr - lol what a moron!
,2b2o,2011-08-22T16:14Z,"Well, we have people:
1. trashing the movie 
2.trashing the quality of the rip 
3. defending the movie 
4. defending the the quality
5. complaining about the seeders to leechers ratio/download speed 
6. asking the complainers what movies they have made 
7. asking if only movie makers can criticize movies. 
Sounds like TPB! Where you have to take the comments with a grain of salt. Now we just need the mention of Nazis to make the conversation complete.....oh noes! what did I do!!!!"
,dngu,2011-09-01T09:03Z,Fucking Nazis
