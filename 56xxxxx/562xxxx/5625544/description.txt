For your convenience, I separated this from a discography torrent I found elsewhere in TPB.
Brilliant live show, with great sound quality, from the pre-crash Lynyrd Skynyrd lineup.
From November 6th 1975 in Cardiff, Wales. This bootleg is known as "The Unreleased KBFH Show".

"KBFH" apparently stands for the "King Biscuit Flour Hour" music radio show.
