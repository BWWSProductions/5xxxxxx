Many other uploaders do this and still manage to yield an overall small file size.
Check out Poppedtart, Gangmie, RiddlerA etc..
Thanks for all your work and for listening."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-13T22:53Z,"@Lovejam: I have used 44.1 kHz sampling rate in ALL my encodings till three days ago.
I use 44.1 in all except small sized encodings.
Reasons for that I wont explain.
And ... I will never use 48kHz sampling rate for AAC encoded audio tracks. However, ALL my XviD encodings do have MP3 audio AND 48 kHz sampling rate. It should be just like that.

BTW, I listen requests regarding the titles only - but those about encoding I treat as insults and find endlessly ridiculous. So, you have nasty habit to use childish double-talk as ""with all due respect, listen to me - I know all about"" shit that never could bring anything good."
,lilars26,2010-06-13T23:12Z,"Thank you 20-40.
For all your excellent encodings.Having seen the 1st Ip Man which was a really well done film I'm looking forward to this.

@Lovejam
20-40 knows what he is doing.He has yet to disappoint.Peddle your troublemaking elsewhere."

,Lovejam,2010-06-14T21:01Z,"i wonder how many more of you regressed folks can get out your anger here.
Seems like my innocent comment has led you all to believe you can let go of something you've been holding onto for a while.
Dump your regressed feelings HERE!"
