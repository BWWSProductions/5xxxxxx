,yep_its_me,2010-06-15T05:56Z,"Hey sebaygo1...I keep meaning to say thank's for uploading these....Also, The alex jones show, do you edit out the adds yourself?  The shows are great without the adds as my little mp3 player i use will only scroll forward in blocks of about 15 minuits at a time, which means if i try to fast forward through the adds on the regular alex jones podcast on my little mp3 player, i not only miss the adds, but also a big chunk of the show lol :P

sebaygo1....Thank you...

Yes, I do edit out the commercials.  Most of the time I leave in the self-promotional stuff, where Alex is trying to sell his DVDs, etc.  But the others I try to elide.  

And your mp3 players sounds a bit like mine!

Glad to be able to do this.
