Scheduled Guests
................

[show description from the Infowars web site]
Alex talks [hour 2] with the former governor of Minnesota, retired professional wrestler and color commentator, Navy Seal, actor, and host [of] TruTV's show Conspiracy Theory, Jesse Ventura. 
Alex also talks with Prison Planet editor, journalist and web master Paul Joseph Watson, 
the president of Solari, Inc., the publisher of The Solari Report, Assistant Secretary of Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner during the first Bush administration, Catherine Austin Fitts [hour 3], 
and former British television executive for the BBC, Alan Hart [hour 4].


Actually, Paul Joseph Watson fills in during the 1st hour as guest-host for Alex [who is "out of town working on a project"].
The other three hours consist of previously broadcast interviews with the people listed above.
The audio in hours 2 through 4 had some problems. I did what I could to improve it, but unfortunately you'll probably still find it kind of sub-standard.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
