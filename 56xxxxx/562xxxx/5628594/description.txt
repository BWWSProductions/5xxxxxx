I dug up these drivers for an old emachine desktop.Since I do work for the Computers For Kids project here where I live,having drivers for older computers is a must in order to refurbish these computers for low income children.(These systems are provided at NO Cost to the families involved.)
The XP drivers for an older eMachine are a bear to find,but I got them.So if you have this model,here are the very necessary drivers you will need for them.

BTW I take any donations for this project,having done this for 15+ years.The smiles of the kids are well worth the effort.
