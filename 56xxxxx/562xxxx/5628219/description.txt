      MASTER OF SUSPENSE JAMES PATTERSON REOPENS THE ULTIMATE COLD CASE 
                           THE UNSOLVED DEATH OF KING TUT.

                            A secret buried for centuries
Thrust onto Egyptâ€™s most powerful throne at the age of nine, King Tut was challenged from the first days of his reign.The veil of prosperity could not hide the bitter rivalries and jealousy that flourished among the Boy Kingâ€™s most trusted advisers. Less than a decade after his elevation, King Tut suddenly perished, and in the years and centuries that followed, his name was purged from Egyptian history. To this day, his death remains shrouded in controversy.

                            The keys to an unsolved mystery
Intrigued by what little was known about Tut, and hoping to unlock the answers to the 3,000-year-old mystery, Howard Carter made it his lifeâ€™s mission to uncover 
the pharaohâ€™s hidden tomb.He began his search in 1907 but encountered countless setbacks and dead ends before he finally discovered the lon-lost crypt.

                             The clues point to murder
Now, in The Murder of King Tut, James Patterson and Martin Dugard dig through stacks of evidence-- X-rays, Carterâ€™s files, forensic clues,
and stories told through the ages- to arrive at their own account of King Tutâ€™s life and death. The result is an exhilarating try-crime tale of intrigue, passion,
and betrayal that casts fresh light on the oldest mystery of all.
