,ricomon35,2011-06-26T09:13Z,"This Simulator has start-up problem. For me it's during the loading screen. The Developer credit logos flash by, then a black screen for several minutes. Then support window pops up, stating the game has encountered a problem. I'm running Windows 7 Premium, and I'm sure it's System or Direct X related. 

UIG GmBH (the developer) has a 1.0.0.1 Patch that only works on licensed copies of the Simulator. The updater requires a User Name and Password.

The patch is here - http://www.uieg.de/index.php/downloads.html

If those d-loaders that have successfully installed post what system and Direct X setups they have, it would help us out alot."
,Stoja121,2011-08-01T19:43Z,How to instal this?!
,BAKERSFIELDBOY211,2011-12-15T18:57Z,"Iam like a few of you where it stops at the insomnia splash screen, BUT,,, befor i got that far it wouldnt even start for me until i place the PhysXLoader in the folder name Mining and Tunneling. It does seem to load it bt takes it away at the end of install, not sure y?

Bt all in all still not working for me i dont think its a system requerment i ant meeting i have a alright video card and 4 gb of ram but something wrong, Happy for ones who can play !"
