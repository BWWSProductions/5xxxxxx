The Runaways - The Mercury Album Anthology
Digitally remastered (2010)

The Runaways, considered among the most influential forces for female artists in rock history--and celebrated in the film The Runaways, which opened March 19--were the first all-female rock band to gain widespread notoriety.  Now, for the first time, the group's first four albums were brought together in one package, the digitally remastered two-CD set, recently released March 16, 2010.

Comprised of teenagers using various "stage names," the original members often referred to as "jailbait rockers" within the industry, Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, Lita Ford, Sandy West and Jackie Fox had stars in their eyes and a fire in their bellies as they learned their instruments on the fly while developing their songwriting skills.

The Runaways albums: The Runaways (1976), Queens of Noise (1977), Live in Japan (1977), and Waitin' For the Night (1977).  All 42 songs that were included on those original albums made for Mercury are digitally remastered on these two CDs.
