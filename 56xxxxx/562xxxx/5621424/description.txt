Directed by Bill Zebub

This movie was made to determine if certain boundaries could be
safely crossed. Can humor that succeeds in some situations be applied
to taboo areas like race, religion, or creed? Watch the movie alone
and laugh guilt-free, and then invite your most sense

Extras include bloopers and skits!
