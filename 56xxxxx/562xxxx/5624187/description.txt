John Hiatt - The Open Road (2010)

Looking at life through the rearview mirror was the inspiration for John Hiattâ€™s brand new album, The Open Road. A classic Hiatt record, the rockinâ€™ songs sizzle with the heat from two-lane blacktop on a summerâ€™s day. Hiatt and his touring band (Kenny Blevins on drums, Patrick Oâ€™Hearn on bass and Doug Lancio on guitars) recorded a set that gives â€œGarage Rockâ€ a new meaning. â€œAll the other years, my songs are about coming home,â€ Hiatt says. But within these 11 new songs, including Haulinâ€™ and the title track, The Open Road home is never the destination.
