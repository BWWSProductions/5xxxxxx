[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-16T01:29Z,"hey Bubs

have you ever had a band personally contact you for posting their album?

i created a small site for my ""followers"" which is kind of getting somewhere good and a ""member"" of a band registered and practically demanded i take their album down.

just wondering what your thoughts are on this seeing as you are the audio god here on TPB."
[V],bubanee,2010-06-16T05:32Z,"Hey Z.. no never have been approached at all.. but if they would like to throw me some notes.. yeah!!!

besides that.. are they a known group these people and whats stopping them really posting it themselves? 2 things come to mind on this.. either there fans of your uploads or their peeps who work for someone like record/movie company reps!!!!! i would look into it first full stop.. hope that helps a bit buddy, bubs.."
,skillet92,2010-06-16T09:53Z,Pls Upload Iyaz-Replay full album
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-16T12:23Z,"they aren't well known at all.  they are a garbage metal/hardcore band.

i posted their new album and a member of the band was just complaining about me putting their album on here.  he said, and i quote ""JonnyBeans has basically raped the internet with our new album"" and he went on to ask if i would take it down.

i thought it was pretty outrageous and weird.  boosts my ego i guess.  i told him his bands album hardly got any attention after i posted it and once they make a good album then he can bitch about me posting it here for free."
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-16T13:39Z,hey bubanee do you know how much we have to do to get a pink skull??? or  any skull
[V],bubanee,2010-06-17T00:59Z,"when i got my first skull i just logged on oneday and a mod left a message saying 'Enjoy your skull'

,GodAmongSaints,2010-06-30T22:27Z,"bubanee, I have probably downloaded about half of your uploads over the past couple years here on The Pirate Bay. I would just like to say thank you for the quality, the tunes, and the internet hospitality. 

Cheers."
