,antmartain,2010-06-16T00:08Z,"I used the AIR serial but it looks like my Mixcraft phoned home and invalidated its registration, which was unexpected because I thought I was covered by Zonealarm...If anybody knows anything about a crack for this I'd love to see it."
,serialhacker,2010-09-21T16:02Z,"works fine for me so far...i just blocked it with comodo firewall.

The reason that the mixcraft sometimes will not let you mix tracks down to mp3.
I have used this to create my own songs, currently working on a cd- i noticed whenever i changed any little part of my track it would not let me mix the file to mp3, so i save the file, then re open it and go directly to mix to mp3- try this out and see if it is the same for you- Snootchy Bootchies"
,kackiz,2010-10-23T13:21Z,does anyone has a serial number for mixcraft 5 build 149?
,kbywg,2010-12-12T20:00Z,same here. serial takes but then goes away and the software creators voices tag to the end of all tracks telling you to buy. Any other way to crack this great software?
,pikatap,2011-01-19T07:18Z,"To always keep registered, delete all registry keys starting with ""K9AAD-"" from

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Acoustica\mixcraft5

and

HKEY_CURRENT_USER 

and then register again"
,ZeMovinPixxle,2011-01-24T13:02Z,"Is it posible to open the old Projekt files with this? cos I had this problem everyones posting about with the 4 118 build by KaYz... and that trick with the regestry didn't work on that one cos it's a totaly different build ;)

So do the old projekt Files work on this one or not?"
