,PhilLesh12,2010-06-14T08:54Z,"seriously, TvTeam and eztv are both really screwed up lately.

They've been reposting shit a day later so that it breaks my rss download filters and I end up downloading the same episode twice and miss the next episode 

Now they are spoofing the episode filters, too, by renaming the episode to the next one and waiting 24 hours.

Are they doing this shit on purpose?  

It's a good thing my provider doesn't actually hold me to my data limits, because these guys have blown my normal monthly data transferred by a factor of 10 for the last TWO MONTHS!  

STOP SCREWING UP ALL OF YOUR FANS' RSS DOWNLOAD FILTERS AND FORCING THEM TO DOWNLOAD JAY LENO THREE TIMES AND DAILY SHOW TWICE AND EVERY OTHER EPISODE TWICE."

Stop moaning you little fag. You're getting this shit for free so you have no rights to complain. 

Where the fuck are your uploads at you cockhunter?"
