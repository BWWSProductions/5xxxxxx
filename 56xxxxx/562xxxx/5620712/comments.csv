[V],twentyforty,2010-06-11T14:52Z,"@DCSDOC: Movie is 93 min 51 sec long. [quark] was discontinued couple of weeks ago. 272p (~3.4 MB/minute) is on the ice (as stated in the Note above). [lepton] could be approx. 250 MB. PROPER is not needed because in-proper release do not exist - or reason must be given based on valid evidence. 720p is, I guess, your typing error (it's biggest format I encode). Smallest size I could easily make is probably in 350 MB range and Matroska container."
