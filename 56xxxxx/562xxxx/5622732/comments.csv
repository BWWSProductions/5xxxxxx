Snap to it Jews!"
,Minerva7101,2010-06-13T06:49Z,"That's true, if the Israelis really wanted to kill them, they would all be gone within a few days. But unlike all their neighbours, Israel is a free democracy, not a brutal dictatorship."
,qwertzo99,2010-06-16T17:36Z,"I ca nonly be amazed of past two comments by hielo999 and Minerva7101. Since you like genocide and killngs so much maybe God will let you taste it onmce or give you some other more worse punishment. 
And reading last comment I must ask myself of level of intelligence of that poster. 
Israel would like nothing more than to erase all peopel who are not of jewish religion but even Israel needs to play ""nicely"" because of world view. Even though it can kill humanitarioans in international waters and put entire people in a biggest concentration camp and cut off their food suppy because they want to fight for their freedom, Israel can't go ""too far"". That is why they can't kill million people in a couple of days (not to mention the time required to kill a million people). 
I hope you get what you wish to palestinians. That would be a fitting end."
