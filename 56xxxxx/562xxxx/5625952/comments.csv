,dark_gable_64,2010-06-25T19:49Z,"Hello SEEDERS!

Everyone is or will soon be- stuck at 64.5%!!!

There are at least 5 seeds available in the swarm- on the active trackers, and if one of these seeders have returned back here to TPB to check the comments- could you please seed for at least 6 more hours or so?

If none of the 5 current seeders can come forth then this Torrent should be killed by the TPB moderators as it is a waste of time for the remaining 250 or so in the various swarms that are stuck at 64.5%!"

We're at 71% now which is up from 64%. I think Pool24boy is just taking his time - no worries. Give it a week or two and see where it goes."
,dark_gable_64,2010-06-27T08:49Z,"Well I got tired of screwing around with this torrent so I managed to compile all 12 books from various other sites and I re-complied them into 1 torrent and uploaded it here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5650126/Jim_Butcher_-_The_Dresden_Files_-_(_All_12_Books_MP3)

Those who don't wanna wait til Xmas for this torrent can come on over to my torrent, as I will be seeding for at least a week continuously!"
