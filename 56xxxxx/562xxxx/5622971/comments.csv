,skillet92,2010-06-12T16:41Z,What is the screen resolution for this release ?
[T],houruoha,2010-06-12T17:26Z,"@skillet92

sorry dont meant to cause anything 
heheh

:?)"
[T],houruoha,2010-06-12T17:27Z,"@skillet92 
really sorry about the above comment...
this mp4 seemed quite odd...
:)"
[T],houruoha,2010-06-12T17:29Z,"may be 480*320
or 640*320
@2040 help?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T17:45Z,"LOL. Sorry. Non-standard 320p means 320 pixels height. I have decided to put in the name to EMHASIZE NON-COMPAIBILITY WITH HANDHELDS
If DAR is 16/9, width is 576 pixels and height is 320 pixels.
If DAR is 2.35/1 (theatrical aspect ratio) width is 576 pixels but height s 256  pixels.
SAR is always 1/1 and hardcoded in video.
PAR is always 1/1 in my encodes."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T17:53Z,"Sorry. I just changes keyboard battery.

So, I am sure that many do not understand.
However, same people have problems with 360p, with 480p, with 720p and with 272p currently ""on hold"", with mp4, with my screen-name, with my writing, with my flag, with my imperfect English.

Here is the deal - maybe I'll choose 432p - maybe 400p - who can tell?
I can explain and choose not to. Take it or leave it."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T18:17Z,"LOL, it doesn't help. I'll switch to fve-six years old but plain keyboard."
[T],houruoha,2010-06-12T18:32Z,"this is really thought to understand
hehhehe
:)"
[T],houruoha,2010-06-12T18:33Z,"sorry

thought=tough
:)"
[T],houruoha,2010-06-12T18:33Z,"OLD is G OLD
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T18:56Z,"@houruoha: LOL, batteries too?
Seriously. frikkin Genius wireless keyboard ate batteries in three weeks. Bad ones in two. I stopped to use wireless mouse - 'cause he ate cells in one week. Well, this wireless crap was a gift, a present from our ISP to all suckers maybe two Xmases ago. Circle has been closed, now I use same ole' as before, and keyboard - sucks anyhow."
,jon4fun,2010-06-12T21:02Z,"@ TPB MODERATORS particularly - I don't understand why you can't understand that size is irrelevant and that goes for pixels and files.

I have NEVER come across a 20-40 file that isn't compatible on ANY device mentioned. I have loaded numerous movies and won't bother giving names BUT will if asked. 
They ALL look great on a 32"" LCD w/HDMI from a PS3 and on an iPod.

Stop trying to pigeon hole with your outdated 'handheld' crap. You (MODERATORS) complete MORONS!

Have you had even one complaint from a REAL fan. What are you basing your judgements on. I could go on but what is the point with you idiots.

@ ALL - just stop whining! Seriously you're so boring. Go elsewhere if you don't understand or like what you see."
,lilars26,2010-06-12T21:11Z,"Yeah,you guys lost me.I just wanted to say that
this episode was excellent and very thought
provoking.
You can get back to your discussion now.LOL"
[T],houruoha,2010-06-12T21:13Z,"@jon4fun
a rather outstanding comment.
im 100% full on you?
@you craps...
2040 knows what he is doing /// so fuck off "
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T21:20Z,"Yes, it's always excellent."
,jon4fun,2010-06-13T02:18Z,"@ All non-moderator fans of 20-40.
Firstly, my apologies to any FAN I may have upset by my comments. 
The primary part was aimed ONLY at moderators on TPB.
The last part about 'whining' was aimed at the haters - they know who they are; NOT at fans who are curious and willing to ask polite intelligent questions.

Jon"
