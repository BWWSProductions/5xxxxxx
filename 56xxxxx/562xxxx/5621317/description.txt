For everyone having problems with the show cutting out, try restarting and/or fast forwarding and rewinding past the part that stopped. I have no idea why it is doing that, but it has happened to me as well. The above mentioned fix works, but it sometimes take a few tries. Again, I apologize for the problems, if I knew what was causing them I would fix it. If anyone out there has an idea, let me know and I will try. FYI I use a source that spits out 8 chunks of the show, I use Sony Vegas Pro to find the commercials, MP3 Splitter and Joiner to cut out the commercials and assemble the show into one piece. I then use it to cut the show into three pieces and run it through DB Power Amp Music Converter (Its a multi threaded app so it uses all three cores of my cpu that way) to encode it to 64K, and previously to mono, the MP3 S & J to reassemble it. If anyone can tell me how to cut the commercials out with Sony Vegas Pro that would be helpful, and if anyone can further tell me how to streamline the process that would be appreciated as well. Thanks again everyone.

OK... I post these shows at three different sites. They all have been having problems lately. So, if this site is down you should be able to find the show at one of the other sites. Following are links to each site, I would bookmark them for future use.
