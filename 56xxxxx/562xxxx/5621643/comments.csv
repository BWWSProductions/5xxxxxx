,Lodhiz,2010-08-23T17:06Z,I downloaded this game today (23 Aug 2010) and I would like to confirm that this works 100%. All I did was run this through abgx360 to double check that it is stealthed (which it is!) and burnt it using a Verbatim DVD+R DL disc on 2.4x using Imgburn. And it worked first time!
