This contains music by Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji (1892-1988) from my personal collection. This isn't another retarded classical top 100 mozart collection, this is real repertoire.

This torrent contains:

* Opus Clavicembalisticum (perf. Ogdon)
* Djami
* Gulistan
* Transcendental Etudes nos. 1-43
* Le Jardin ParfumÃ©
and other solo piano pieces.

Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.





**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"



If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
