@elite-sky

We haven't tested that, but you can try to apply the Expansions and see if it works; it should work though.


@TheMan08 

Download the missing .dll file from www.dll-files.com and drag & drop the .dll file to: C:\Windows\System32

If this didn't work, then copy the .dll file to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3 ; The game should work fine now."

Try to first copy the Crack to your Desktop, thén copy it to the Game directory. Yes, we tested it on Windows Vista.


@sadNOOB

The Game directory by default is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3."

[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-15T20:16Z,"Hello,


@Cyprususer

You don't need a Serial key in order to Install this Game. Please be sure you opened the .rar file you Downloaded, using WINRAR (Which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org) and then drag & drop áll the files in the .rar file to a folder on your Desktop. From there, start the Installation and it should work."

[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-22T19:23Z,"Hello,

@A85

You have to copy the .dll file to the folder where you Installed the Game. By default this will be: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3, otherwise you'll keep getting that error.


@sf8193

This Game fully works on Windows 7. Open the .rar file you Downloaded and drag & drop the ""age3.exe"" in the ""# Crack"" folder, to a folder on your Desktop. From there, drag & drop it to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3. It should work fine now.


@usual_suspect

Open the ""# Crack"" folder in the .rar file you Downloaded and drag & drop the ""age3.exe"" in there to: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3. A popup will appear, telling you the file already exists; just click ""Replace""."
,sadNOOB,2010-08-23T17:45Z,so i install the game on my grandparents lartop and they have a sucky computer then when i get home i install it in my awsome new great fast computer with shitloads of memory and the insallation is fine but when i run the game the stating page where you can go to game mode is all screwed up and the picture doesnt set and also i only see a portion of the screen cuz i see the bottom left of the game screen on my screens top right and everything else is black
[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-24T18:12Z,"Hello,

Please first check if your PC can run the Game: http://svc.systemrequirementslab.com/CYRI/

If yes, try to Update your Graphic Card's Driver to the latest version. If this didn't work either, try the following:

1. Uninstall the Game.
2. Restart your PC. (!)
3. Reinstall the Game.
4. See if it works now."

[T],Games4theworld,2010-09-04T10:48Z,"Hello,


@sadNOOB

The only thing I can recommend then is that you get a new, better Graphic Card.

Also copy the .dll file to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires 3."

[T],Games4theworld,2010-09-06T17:46Z,"Hello,

@tlshollow

Did you use WinRar to open the .rar file you Downloaded? If not, Download WinRar from www.thepiratebay.org/user/games4theworld and open the .rar file with it. When opened, select áll files and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. Open that folder and read the ""# Installation Guide.txt"".


@karlmanuel11

No, you can't go Online with this cracked version. I think LAN will work, but I'm not sure about that."

If you mean the key for Installing the game, read the installation guide:

2. When asked for a Serial, enter this Serial: DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG
3. Install the Game.
4. Open the '# Crack' file in the .rar.
5. Copy + Paste the 'age3.exe' file to the Game Directory and REPLACE it by
the existing one.
6. Start the Game and... ENJOY playing!"

[T],Games4theworld,2011-07-05T13:55Z,"Hello,

@blinkfan82

Which OS you have?

@natehbabeh

 Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!
