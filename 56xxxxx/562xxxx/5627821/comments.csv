Wasn't sure about the file type, but the good ol' DVDFlick was able to transcode it and burn it to disc. My boy has watched it twice already! Always a good thought to search for it before you post it.  Why have 15 torrents of the same thing, right?

Keep up the good work, and many thanks! Giving you a plus up : )"
