At once gritty and whimsical, The Unidentified follow Estlin, a 

passionate young journalist scraping by in New York City. As his 

frustration with his entry-level job at a local newspaper peaks, his 

disgruntled best friend, Brooke, leaves Brooklyn for Ohio. Set adrift, 

Estlin falls for Sophie, an elusive artist with an optimistic view on 

life. But as their romance blossoms, his high ideals and dogged 

pursuit of truth come into conflict with her tightly guarded secrets. 

The film is an exploration of idealism and apathy in today's youth 

culture and the vestiges of the social consciousness of the 1960s. In 

a climactic scene shot at a real anti-war protest in Washington D.C., 

Estlin must come to terms with what has been lost, what still remains 

and where he must go from here.
