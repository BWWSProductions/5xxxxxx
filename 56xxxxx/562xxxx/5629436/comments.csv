,AZkiller7,2010-06-15T15:53Z,"can't you see guys? this is for ASSASSIN'S CREED 2, not PoP"
,selyo,2010-06-15T16:04Z,"Guys why anybody try AC2 crack on POP isnt the prob only on Ubi game luncher shit .

i would if try it my self but am still downloading"
,XHaloX,2010-06-15T16:39Z,"@selyo

i tried the AC2 crack, the problem is the crack can launch the game but the values in the crack is for AC2, so eventually the game crashes or say connection error.

So AC2 crack doesnt work.

If you look at AC2 crack, there is a SKIDROW.exe file, i think this file is the actual values (server responses). 

However, UBI upgraded the DRM so new crack is needed."
[T],sanpork,2010-06-15T17:47Z,"@sleekstrike
I didn't said a word about I've managed to play this game with server emulator. But I said it might be useful for the crackers.
I am trying server emulator method hope will succeed."
[T],sanpork,2010-06-15T17:51Z,Server emulator will work but we need database values. Ubisoft is not stupid to provide same protection on this game. They've modified DRM little bit.
,XHaloX,2010-06-15T17:56Z,"ok guys, confirmed THIS IS NOT WORKING!

i was able to run the emulator, but values are for AC2, so the game keeps trying to connect, then it fails and exits due to missing DB values.

So forget UNLESS if a new DB values are available."
,XHaloX,2010-06-15T18:01Z,"Here is what the author is trying to say ""IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE ITS FOR AC2/SCC"":

1 - clear all entries in your hosts files located at(C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc) with admin privileges
2 - (RECOMMENDED) Renistall the game.
3 - Close everything and add the following entries to hosts file:

4 - Download and install Python, version 2.6 or later (must be): www.python.org
5 - Run server.exe located at the emulator folder.

Those are the same instructions for AC2 and SCC."

Still, there are a hell of comments saying the crack is originally the one developed for AC2 and seeing so many people downloaded and are currently seeding it makes no sense. All in all, this is not what everyone expects it to be. So, would it not be the logical way to stop downloading or seeding it? Just asking..."

This is what they either forgot or didn't think about saying in the instructions about how to run the server emulator by dormine about the program needed besides phython version 2.6 and Pycrypto Version 2.1.0 but they have never said anything about the program.

,LegendOfTime,2010-06-19T06:34Z,"But anyways as for prince of persia the forgotten sands video game for the computer well it will still need the values.db just like assassin's creed 2 video game for the computer needed them aswell.

But anyways as we all are hoping and wanting the crack to play prince of persia the forgotten sands video game for the computer will take a long while as though it took a long while to get a crack for assassin's creed 2 video game for the computer.

As we all know by now that dormine group was the first to get the values.db and to create a server emulator and skidrow group was the second to get the values.db.

But anyways the skidrow group made it easy to get somewhere by putting all the information into the values.db but the dormine group made it hard to get somewhere."

@heema2020
i passed it by changing ubiorbit 's dll file in ubisoft launcher!! to ubi orbit file 's dll file of splinter cell or assassin creed 2!
the game even launches upto the draw back mode!
there comes written prince of persia!
and then it comes written failed to load!
and then the game closes with a crash error!

btw i am also waiting for the crack!
in every case a pirate gamer is better than legit gamer
only in crack thing legit user are ahead of pirate's!!!"
