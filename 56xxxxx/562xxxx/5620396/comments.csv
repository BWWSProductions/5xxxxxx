,HongPong,2010-06-11T10:18Z,"Yea its real, its the same file that is posted http://tc.indymedia.org/files/flotilla-footage/index.html
There will be more footage, this is just part of the story. The seeds are kicking in now though fortunately."
,Christian777,2010-06-11T17:02Z,"You guys know that several of the crew on board the ship where known terrorists on the UN list of wanted terrorists?

Any film clip from these murderers are nothing but Pallywood propaganda."
,Christian777,2010-06-11T17:38Z,"I saw these videos now, none of them contain any material showing IDF soldiers killing anyone, several of the so called wounded are not wounded at all. 

There is no material about what happened on deck, the IDF video on the other hand shows live action, shows how the terrorists attack the soldiers not Pallywood rubbish, look at the timeline, first the wounded appear, then the soldiers attack, wow what happened, did they shoot each other first?

This is ridiculous, really, bad even for Pallywood."
,wildrose71,2010-06-11T20:06Z,"This is from the ship in question and it is real.
No one getting shot at? How did you miss that?
The Israeli military video on the other hand is not real. These people were not terrorists! In this case Israel acted like terrorists.
Oh, and I am not saying that all Israelis are terrorists, many many of them as as tired as anyone else of all this and wants the blockade against the Palestinians to end."
,Christian777,2010-06-11T20:23Z,"@wildrose71: It can very well be that these footages are from one of the ships, what is not true is that these footages were taken during the boarding of the vessel, 

Point 1: if civilians hear gunshots, they don't just go about their business as if nothing happened, they scream, take cover, run around terrified.

Point 2. they were ""wounded"" and ""dead"" terrorists BEFORE the IDF boarded the vessel so the footage is fake.

Point 3: Several of the ""peace activists"" are on the UN list of wanted terrorists, hence they are terrorists, not ""peace activists"".

Point 4: If they wanted peace, why do they shoot at the IDF helicopter?

Point 5: For the blockade to end, all they need to do is to release the kidnapped soldier, what are they waiting for?

Point 6: What are these Arab terrorists doing in Israel anyway? They should go home."
,wildrose71,2010-06-11T21:24Z,"Point 1: if civilians hear gunshots, they don't just go about their business as if nothing happened, they scream, take cover, run around terrified.

Wildrose: They had been called by radio, they expected the military. Do YOU understand the language spoken on the film? Well, I do and I also know that these people were on the Mavi Mara.

Point 2. they were ""wounded"" and ""dead"" terrorists BEFORE the IDF boarded the vessel so the footage is fake.

Wildrose: If you had watched it you can see that the IDF is shooting from the helicopter down on the ship = people got shot.

Point 3: Several of the ""peace activists"" are on the UN list of wanted terrorists, hence they are terrorists, not ""peace activists"".

Wildrose: No they are not actually. I don't know where you got that info, probably from the very misleading Fox News or something.

Point 4: If they wanted peace, why do they shoot at the IDF helicopter?

Wildrose: Since the activists didn't have guns how could they shoot?

Point 5: For the blockade to end, all they need to do is to release the kidnapped soldier, what are they waiting for?

Wildrose: OK, you don't know anything at all about the Israel-Palestine conflict, that's obvious with that statement.

Point 6: What are these Arab terrorists doing in Israel anyway? They should go home.

Wildrose: What Arab terrorists? There are for your info, many Arabs living in Israel side by side with Israelis..."

,Christian777,2010-06-13T16:14Z,"@Wildrose: First of all. all my points are valid and proven by both the IDF as well as the Hamas video. None of your remarks disprove this fact.

Second of all, I know everything about the conflict, you are the one having no clue on whats going on. 

But most important is the fact that the Mohammedan terrorist occupying Judea and Samaria do not come from Israel but from various Arab dictatorships where they belong. They should go home and leave the Jews in peace."
,steveaustin1971,2010-06-14T03:07Z,"@Christian777 Your logic is severely flawed. Eyewitness accounts from ALL the flotilla ships says that Israeli soldiers fired BEFORE they boarded. They shot the greek captain dead on te bridge before they boarded that ship as well. You claim you know ""everything"" but what I'm hearing from you is what you read on Israeli media sites. If the flotilla crew wanted to kill IDF soldiers, why didn't they kill the 4 that they had in heir control for an hour? They treated the wounds of these four soldiers and they went home in one piece. I think that if they had malicious intent, they would have just killed them when they had them unarmed and in their control? What Israel says, and what you parrot, makes no sense. The flotilla attack was a provocation by the israeli's, they WANTED violence, thinking everyone would side with them, but they were DEAD wrong. Only a minority (even in Israel) supports the zionist Israeli's anymore."

ALLAh AKBAR MEANS KILL KILL KILL.
That what all this muslims know to do all over the world."
,adi7142,2010-06-16T20:02Z,"Why doesn't the footage show the truth about the 3 soldiers who were stabbed, beaten and then abducted to the belly of the ship and held as hostages. This was not a peace ship, it was a terrorist one.

If it was a peace ship than the 9/11 airplanes were peace planes, who just peacefully wanted to land on US soil, but the US prevented them from landing by building the Twin Towers.

RIDICULOUS"
,VuRaL,2010-06-17T11:05Z,"@adi7142

Before you post like a moron, try to face what really happened. A ship was attacked in OPEN SEA. OPEN SEA, if you lack brain means it is no ones territory and you can not do anything to anyone there. If you do, you are a pirate or a terrorist. in this case, they are both. Shoot civilians, who had no guns, just basic melee.

At another point, a corpse had 5 bullet wounds, which means he was not shoot to left out of combat. Since those guys were commands, they definitely wanted to kill."
,Christian777,2010-07-03T00:55Z,"What happened is that a ship full of terrorists tried illegally to break the legal blockade of the terrorist enclave called Gaza.

When they were legally boarded by the Authorities they attacked the authorities with deadly force and deadly weapons. 

This results in forcing the authorities to defend themselves witch leads to the fortunate death of 9 terrorists and the unfortunate severe injuries of 3 Israeli soldiers.
