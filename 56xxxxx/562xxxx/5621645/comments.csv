,mistarip,2010-08-17T13:11Z,"Did you copy this from the original xbox 360 game?
I'm asking cuz there were a lot of fake psp to xbox 360 conversion of this game.
So i'm wondering if this is the real xbox 360 copy or one of those psp to xbox conversions"
,mistarip,2010-08-17T13:13Z,oh yea.  you also didn't mention if this is pal or ntsc or region free or usa
,xRowan,2010-08-24T05:15Z,seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed!!!!!!!!!1
,mistarip,2010-08-27T15:19Z,"ben_55, it works.  It's region free and, yes, of course you need to mod your 360.  You have to flash the dvd drive.  go to 360mods.net for more info.  it's simple.

I still don't know if this is the real 360 game or the psp converted one.  The guy isn't answering."
,dcar777,2010-09-23T23:45Z,"its straight from the disc, real 360 no PSP, region free and patched. "
