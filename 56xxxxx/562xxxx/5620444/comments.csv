,Devosh1,2011-08-15T08:37Z,"There is nothing wrong with the boot camp video file. You just need to download the DivX codec from the DivX site. It will work fine then. At least, it did for me."

Maybe im just dumb or something, but are you supposed to do the whole 50min of 30 day jump start at once, or one 10min exercise per day? And why are there so many different videos (30 day..., cardio max workout, boot camp etc)? Are you supposed to do them in order or what? Instructions pleez?! "
,haramkhor,2012-03-30T08:25Z,you are right jarkka82.... these can be done in various ways but it doesn't tell anything properly.... need instructions too... though i downloaded 30 days jump start a couple of days back and i do all at once but i take a minute break or so after every 10 minutes exercise..... coz 10 minutes a day won't matter at all... hope that helps ;)

Users: Just pick one of the videos and do it without stopping (5 days a week), if you stop your muscles start to cool down and you won't loose those calories - you have to keep your heart rate up to make progress. Work through the pain! Fire it up! It's tough, at first these workouts kicked my ass but they are getting easier and I'm dropping the pounds like crazy! Love Bob! So glad I got this dl!"
