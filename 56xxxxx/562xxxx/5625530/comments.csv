,dj_fabio,2010-06-27T15:56Z,"Hi there,

i just updated my xbox to ixtreme LT.
I burned red dead redemption and splinter cell conviction but when Iput it in my xbox, nothing happened, it didn't recognize it and just said ""Open tray"" like nothing is on the disc. 
Then I have put the DVD to my PC to check if there are actually any files - everything was fine, there was even the system update folder.
After that happened I found out about abgx and patched it with the correct patches from abgx. 
Still not working, i used verbatim discs and burned 2,4x.
Battlefield bad company 2, and all other non wave 6 games work fine.
Could someone help me? I have no idea what is the problem.

Thanks"

1.Your xbox dvd drive MUST be patched with iXtreme(or other version) firmware, Check drive model to find compatible firmware
2.Burn downloaded game with ImgBurn to DVD+R Double layer with 2.4x speed
3.Say good bye to xbox live, Because Microsoft will baned your xbox some day"
,thunya,2010-08-12T04:48Z,2.1 forgot 1 thing. ImgBurn->Tools->Setting->Write->Layer Break->enter this value 1913760
,shivamen,2010-08-12T13:12Z,"Ok,, thnx for the help lol
nthnx im deleting this download lol.. 
im just gonna buy rdr orginal version then..."
,Lodhiz,2010-08-24T18:44Z,"Game works perfectly for me. I just ran the ISO through abgx360 and it checked out fine. I then burnt to DVD+R DL (Verbatim) at a speed of 2.4x. If you are having trouble with the game, try installing to your HDD then playing the game.

I don't know why people say the game is freezing when mounting the horse, it's working fine for me.

On iExtreme LT btw..."
