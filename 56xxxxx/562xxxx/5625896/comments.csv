[T],ctang,2010-06-14T02:06Z,"for the people that download from me a lot, do people want the trailers or not...it will make download speeds faster because of smaller file sizes...let me know"
[T],ctang,2010-06-15T04:39Z,i am only asking because i have had people specifically ask me to leave the trailers in the past
[T],ctang,2010-06-15T17:31Z,i use clonedvd2...what is cce...would like to look into it to see if its any better than clonedvd2
,akira900gt,2010-06-15T19:51Z,"hi ctang,
i have a couple requests but didn't know where to leave em. if you can upload any of these it would be awesome:
Forrest Gump
Don't Be A Menace To South Central...
Soldier
thank you for some great movies by the way!"
[T],ctang,2010-06-15T23:33Z,"i have forest gump...is the second one ""dont be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in da hood""...if so i have it too so i have both"
,mrluckyman,2010-06-16T02:09Z,"don't use clonedvd2 cuz it won't copy protected dvd. just get 'DVDSmith Movie Backup' it allow you copy from dvd full dvd or specific copy parts. it is free like DVD Decrypter.  it can check for bad sector before copy dvd. so try it.  so u can use DVDFab for customize like remove fbi warning, some stupid extras, etc... hope u like my suggestion."
,mrluckyman,2010-06-16T02:11Z,i can't wait for Forest Gump NTSC but i already have Don't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-16T03:11Z,"ctang!

you better leave those trailers alone!  haha. i am very picky and i want a 100% copy of a dvd-r.  if im seeding then i want it as if i bought it.

looking forward to Dont Be A Menace.  i heard it was good, never saw it."
[T],ctang,2010-06-16T03:46Z,@zombifuzz: your definitely going to like Dont Be a Menace to South Central............
,mrluckyman,2010-06-16T15:19Z,"don't remove anythings just warnings, fbi, etc... something like not extras or trailers because so they can get something from movie's recommendation. "
