For your convenience, I separated this from a discography torrent I found elsewhere on TPB.

Disc 1 of "Teaching An Oakie To Fly" is a more-standard bootleg (albeit a high-quality one) of Lynyrd Skynyrd's concert at Knebworth England on August 21st, 1976.

("Teaching An Oakie To Fly" = teaching Oklahoma native Steve Gaines to become a Free Bird.)

The first 8 tracks are leaked recordings of Steve Gaines rehearsing with his new band in early summer 1976. The next 12 tracks are a bootleg of a show by Steve's old band Detroit from 1973.
