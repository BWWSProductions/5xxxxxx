sound is even better than the video... sounds perfect. "

,imakewebs,2010-09-18T16:10Z,"I bought the actual bluray before downloading this file.  Honestly, there is no difference. But, imho, this is not bluray quality.  There is a thin veal of grain over the screen and a yellow tint. I believe that's what the creator wanted, but to me the rating is as follows:
a = 10
v = 8"

,fragger5,2011-01-31T06:39Z,"@imakewebs
The reason being is that they re-encode the raw bluray. If this was just the actual raw footage from the bluray the file size would range from 15-40gigs. They re-encode the footage down with H.264 to a more reasonable size for users to download."
