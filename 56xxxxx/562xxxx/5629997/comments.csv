[V],phatwarez,2010-06-15T23:30Z,"Bone we love your torrents but can you start adding samples to your cam releases? It would save a lot of us a lot of time, and it only adds like 10mb extra.

No sample means more people will leech just to check the quality. Samples bring seeders!"
[V],.BONE.,2010-06-15T23:52Z,i do not make the files i just upload if the release group dont make samples then i can not upload :)
[V],.BONE.,2010-06-15T23:55Z,and 9/10 of the time the samples made from the best quality wise part of the film u dont see many samles that are from the night time scenes do ya :)

,jared1107,2010-06-16T06:03Z,Thanks for the Up bone. I know how to use google if I need a screen shot which I barely give a shit about. These whiners have no gratitude.

,ratchakkk,2010-06-17T05:16Z,Audio 8 and Video 2!!! really bad quality i wont even seed it! it will save you time!!!
,b5200,2010-06-18T07:22Z,"I might just be a bit sensitive because this is my first cam but I found it to be unwatchable.  I made it about 7 minutes before I got to a point where I was sick of not being able to see stuff relevant to the plot.  Early on Dre marks his height on a wall and rights something next to it, the camera zooms in on it and you can't even tell that he wrote anything, you just see the whiteness of the wall.  Nice audio though."
,dredre27,2010-06-19T19:15Z,This torrent might be watched. Comcast disconnected me for seeding this. Once I deleted the torrent from my client and reset my modem all was fine. Be wary if concerned about your provider disconnecting you or about complaints being reported against you
