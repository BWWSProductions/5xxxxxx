,bigjetcjs,2010-06-12T06:47Z,"It was a great season eztv, Thank You Much!"
,piratebaysux,2010-06-12T07:41Z,Great season? Are you joking? SGU is the worst load of scifi crap since BSG. Way too much human drama and not enough exploration/adventure. Anyone would think they are channeling Ronald Moore. How many seasons did BSG last? How many seasons did SG1 last? Which formula worked best? Doh!
,sammaful,2010-06-12T10:14Z,bsg was a ark story tho and only meant to last 4-5 seasons where as fuck knows where there going with sgu it need more action in it and more substance if they dont seriously kick it up a gear in season 2 i cant see it getting further than 3 seasons tops
,thePraetorian,2010-06-12T10:47Z,@piratebaysux: troll you are too obvious troll.
,iron_hobbit,2010-06-12T12:39Z,thanks ez for another great download
,iron_hobbit,2010-06-12T12:50Z,i dont normally comment on others comments but as far as the sg series goes sg1 was an action adventure show based off the plot from a major action adventure movie.. they just so happened to have great character development.. atlantes and sgu fallow a different direction.. atlantes is based more on the mythos of the series where as sgu follows the characters.. like voyager but better.. not saying this show is for everyone me i cant stand atlantes but thats because i prefer character over action

,hello40204,2010-06-14T09:51Z,"the story is based on budget only . since the budget is relatively small . they concentrate on characters . the special effect of sci fi are almost gone , too expensive , the sci fi itself could be a soap opera . 
but as sci fi and most of us buff , we like our special effects . so i would not see this show last with too much support .
the tv stations really need to spend some more money on their shows . we need more special effects to make those sci fi more credible for the characters and story .
and at last . stop those stone exchange with stargate  universe . this is becoming very boring and overdone . 
i can see the writers again of this show like most of other shows have no clues about what direction the story is going to .
wish jj abrhams directed this show .


and one last remark . "

,mudachicken,2010-06-16T05:26Z,"@piratebaysux
HERE HERE, season one has been the biggest turd in the face of SG lovers, who cares about peoples emotions, honestly... "
,pimpmobile,2010-06-16T05:35Z,"this show is a piece of shit!  they need to go back to the way it used to be with sg1 and atlantis!  this series is for fucking chicks all talking about feelings and relationships no real fucking guy would be interested.  all this show is, is a soap opera for bitches someone needs to smack a hoe and fix this shit!"
,jonns80,2010-06-16T21:28Z,"thank you fore this nice episodes,,,,,just weiting to next season"
,Sattori,2010-06-18T20:45Z,"If it is right that they have only limited budget for this series I think it is a lucky coincidence. They concentrate on good scripts and storytelling. So far I liked every episode. I do not understand why people who hate this series watch it just to complain about it later. Absolutely puzzling. It's like eating Sushi though you can't stand raw fish. But as I suspect, we will hear their comments also for season 2 in September."
,piratebaysux,2010-06-25T21:35Z,Stargate SG 1 now outranks Stargate Universe. Are you listening executive producers? Knaves!

,zapphb,2010-06-27T08:17Z,Thanks for all the good stuff EZTV
,dawgy62,2010-07-02T01:02Z,"U dont develop a genre and then depart from its strengths. The occaissional drama is fine; but please, please galaxy domination and little guy kicking ARRRSE is what the whole stargate universe depends on, or its followers at least.

And can some1 finally figure out how to make the thing work so we can get on with the real business of kicking the alliance Ahole.

Dont kill the bitch though shes the best part of the show so far. Only thing is shes wearing to much clothing. 

If youre not gonna have violence at least have some gratuitous sex ............. thats what every other series does ............

............. Yeah baby, next season is gonna ROCK"
,dawgy62,2010-07-02T01:09Z,"Oh yeah and by the way EZ....luv ya thanks for everything. Appreciate all the fresh DLs.
