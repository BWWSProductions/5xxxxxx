To Activate OFFICE 2010

To Activate download ""Win7 Loader Extreme"" at the following link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5621974/Windows_7_Loader_eXtreme_Edition_v3.503-NAPALUM_DiBYA

Extract with WinRar and place the extracted W7lxe.exe into C drive (C:\\)

Then go to 'Run' from start menu and type ""C:\\w7lxe.exe /office2010"" press enter and you are done!, Office 2010 is Activated & Updates work also. Enjoy!

ALSO from my own experience i had to disable my AVG 9.0 Resident Shield firewall, and also allow it to go through my Microsoft firewall, which i was automatically prompted to do by MS. Then i re-ran the command and it worked like a charm! Three cheers for Firefuze, Win7 Loader, and this uploader!"
