,.Phineas.,2010-06-14T23:08Z,"Alright, so here's my issue...I've installed it, applied the crack and it IS working, but I have Kaspersky and any time I open up Firefox to download proxy lists, Kaspersky pops up and Real Hide IP stops working and is forced to close. I have added the entire program file as an exception to Kaspersky, but I'm still getting the same pop-up. Any suggestions?"
,gaokaizer,2010-06-15T11:02Z,"Scanned this with SpyBot and it claims to detect a malware in the exe-file called Fraud.DesktopSecurity2010.

SpyBot's manual removal guide says this about it: ""Fraud.DesktopSecurity2010 claims to be an antispyware tool. When it is installed to the computer it finds a lot of harmless entries in order to frighten the user and make him buy a license to get the issue fixed.""

Have anyone running the program experienced any of this?"
,gaokaizer,2010-06-15T11:33Z,"Okay, I've downloaded and checked the files two other similar programs and SpyBot claims that all of them got the same malware. 
'scuse me for being a noob but what are the odds for that? Starting to suspect SpyBot gets paid to bitch about it or something..."

It's Just A false Positive By Your Overly Protected Antivirus Software. Just add It To Ur Exception List"
,QUICKSILVER57,2010-06-23T01:52Z,WORKS 100% BRILLIANT MANY THANKS MATE
,gaokaizer,2010-07-05T21:50Z,Suspected that much. Runs just fine. Thanks!
,MEB26181,2010-07-18T22:50Z,I was recently caught downloading movie torrents by NBC so will this program prevent this in the future?
,DimaFunk,2010-07-20T19:16Z,ROFL! This only hides your ip for browsers not in general. not what i need
,goldentongs,2010-08-12T08:01Z,"This does NOT hide your IP, it only uses transparent proxies which can be seen, if you check on showmyip.com it will state your correct IP and also state you are connected through a proxy and show the proxy IP. This program does not use anonymous proxies, it will probably be ok for bypassing regioned websites like watching videos on sites outside their country but probably not worth it due to bandwith being eaten connecting to the proxy, If you plan to use this becuase you NEED to make sure your IP is not detected it is not the tool you are looking for."
,Mikertones,2010-08-27T23:00Z,cool thanks -works good
,ZillaIIDope,2010-09-21T17:58Z,"if i update will the crack still work, if i apply it??"
,Suba23,2010-11-04T21:23Z,"works,but when I check my ip on google it still gives me the original..so is it not hidden?"
,boysmaki,2011-08-29T05:28Z,"@suba23: u r right... to check it is working perfectly go to cmyip.com OR go to maps.google.com and double click the dot between navi and zoom buttons(on the map) and click ""Share location""(at the top of the browser)... this will tell google is tracking original loc or faked ip's loc"
,crimson85067,2011-10-30T22:58Z,this stops at 99.9% and the files show that they are at 0% when I search my system for the file it is not there?
