[T],thenoobish,2010-06-15T23:35Z,This should not have any password!
,Londork,2010-06-16T15:10Z,"Err... Mr. thenoobish!
Have you tried playing this game yourself and made sure that it works?
At ""gametrailers.com"" it said that this game isn't released yet! It said it will be released in 20/7/2010, and today it is 16/6/2010."
,andrija3b,2010-06-17T06:27Z,Londork
,Londork,2010-06-17T08:28Z,"Yes andrija?
Anyhow... Managed to get the whole file down, but when extracting it said: ""Could not extract the file ""swag-doba.img"" Wrong checksum"".

This makes my heart heavy and my prostate weak. Have not encountered any password-thingie though...

Have anyone got this to work?"
,muryoh,2010-06-19T08:38Z,"I just downloaded it, and have successfully unrar'd it without any password.
There is no .img file, only .dvd and .iso.

I will be trying to burn it in a few, I'll let you know whether it works or not."
,muryoh,2010-06-19T09:24Z,Game works :-)
,Londork,2010-06-19T10:20Z,"Well! Nail my balls to my forehead and call me a midget! It's probably just because I use a MAC...

I'll be downloading this again and try again!"
,muryoh,2010-06-19T11:31Z,"Ah, I wouldn't know. I used the rar command-line utility from a debian system.

Hope you will be able to get it unrar'd!"
,idaoffe,2010-06-19T16:55Z,worked fine for me... no password and no problem
,DaMooseSausage,2010-06-21T00:17Z, whats the game about man...let us know...dont want to waste a disc...runnin low...
