,DeeperThought,2010-06-15T19:59Z,"Hmm, none of the serials work for me!"
,kulawend,2010-06-17T16:42Z,"Need a serial? Try this:
1160-4056-6436-8527-8030-7391.

Note to uploader: 
The serials included with the release don't work and the keygen you have provided in the comments doesn't even generate keys for this version of Lightroom."
,dosanko,2010-06-19T18:32Z,could really do with a legit keygen or more legit serials man.... ; ) thanks for the release

,redlizzy,2010-08-23T18:45Z,Do the automatic updates work on this one? Or the flickr upload?
,redlizzy,2010-08-23T19:27Z,And is it safe to use automatic update? Does Adobe see that this is pirate version?

,photos4fun,2010-11-22T09:14Z,"hey so i have no idea how to install this!!! it gives me 3 parts and wants me to open it with my photoshop but I know that, that doesn't work.... help?"
,siamthai,2010-11-27T17:20Z,"Easy to install. I did like this. 

1. Closed down my Internet connection 
2. Exracted one om the rar files (seems as you only need one of them)
3. Clicked ""Install Lightroom 3.exe"" 
4. Now just go ahead and install like any other program. But make the choise of NOT doing update automatic but manuall instead and then don't ever do any update (or the Adobe site may detect that it's a pirate serial)"
