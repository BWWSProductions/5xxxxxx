OR...here's an interesting alternative:

Dziobas Rar Player will play rar files WITHOUT 
UNPACKING / DECOMPRESSING!

Oh yeah - did I mention that it's FREE?
Yup - that's FREE, as in FREEWARE - no BS restrictions or trial period, nags, ad banners, etc. Just plain ol' FREE!
EASY TO USE (based on ""MPlayer"")
