This is an AMAZING upload, if I could get the answer to this;

When I open MS Word, I go to help and it says that the product is not activated and it gives me the option to 'Change Product Key' so when I press that it opens a window that asks for a product key.

According to your post above ^^ it says that nothing should open.

Can you please tell me what to do?

Thanks in Advance!"

,xtra1979,2010-07-02T07:53Z,">DeGun I regret to inform you but it did not work on my pc. I'd download the same from other uploaders but no luck, here's what it post: 

Setup is unable to proceed due to the following error(s):

x86 platform
- Windows 7
- Windows Vista SP1
- Windows XP SP3
- Windows Server 2003 SP2

x64 platform
- Windows 7
- Windows Vista
- Windows Server 2008

Microsoft really made this program for only rich people, but how about less fortunate people all over the world like me? Surely they want, especially me, to try this latest version of MS Office!

I really hope that some one from the uploaders will try to hack this program or reprogram it so that others who have x32bit of system can use this latest program of Microsoft. It will be a great help if someone can really make this happen....

Thanks to all uploaders!

Just use virtual drive created by software's such as Daemon Tools or Alcohol etc. to use image files. 
Just use Google, you'll get the names of tons of free software's that will do the job easily.

Don't worry.This is final version.

If the update or version checker is not allowed on internet then it shouldnt be 180 days + sometimes because of uninstalling of office not fully done there is traces of previous versions / or / the same with the activator each one uses still got traces so after usig an office remove tool it is recommanded to use differents apps for final cleaning ; for instance i uninstal with youruninstaller pro, full uninstal with reg clean and broken shorcuts or opheline files cleaning too but still after i clean again reg and all with advanced system care which always find some stuff that youruninstaler dont.

Otherwise Chess000Master thank you for your usefull comments - as usual :D

Also, if i remember correctly, there is no choice to install only the apps you want. Instead one has to install the whole pack of bloated M$ Spyware and then use the iso again to uninstall everything but Word or Excel.

,joshw220,2011-12-22T06:38Z,"This works, just the issue is Microsoft is aware of it and created an update for it that removes the pre-crack. Read your windows updates and be-careful not to update that particular update and you should be pretty good"

,Coke_712,2011-12-27T19:14Z,Works Good so far but although i did what SacredGuy said in the Help menu it says Product Activated but in the start menu it still has a file saying 60 Day Trial Update!!?!?!?
,Josefmen,2011-12-29T23:01Z,"This is not cracked, but Tdawg234 or something posted the activator. It's named OKT2010, looked fishy, but I ran Norton insight. It was safe, ran the program and it cracked Office for me. Thanks!!!"
,ultrapulse,2012-01-02T00:36Z,"DonÃ¢â¬â¢t use KMS Activation firstly you donÃ¢â¬â¢t know if its installing Trojans or other viruses onto your system and secondly it only activates it for 180 days. Activate it permanently with a serial and by ringing Microsoft and getting the conformation ID, that way you know you are safe and secure and also you know it is permanently activated.

01. start Word.
02. If the activation window appears close it.
03. Go to menu File, Help, Change Product Code, and then enter key:
828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH or 3W3MQ-H7M6X-3WYP7-TPCH6-8G8T2
04. Untick the ""Activate over internet"" box at the bottom, and click ""Next"".
05. In the window that appears click ""Install"".
06. When finished the Install process, close word an then reopen Word.
07. An activation window will appear (if not, go to menu File, Help, Activate).
08. Select the ""Phone Activation"" option, and click ""Next"".
09. Pick your country, then ring the number and follow the instructions.
10. When asked for your ID, input the code given in the Word activation window. 
11. When asked which edition, choose business/volume use, used only on 1 pc.
12. A code will be given back, and enter the code into the activation box.
13. Click ""Next"", and Office will say that it's permanently activated.
14. Close Word (and any other Office 2010 application).
15. Restart Word, and go to Help to check the subscription status.

Office 2010 is now fully and permanently activated."

Ungenuine serial keys produce genuine installation codes which you give to the operator and in return he/she will give you an activation code, so dont worry. I have done it many times. "

After that entered the 2nd set of serial provided by ultrapulse .. The IVR said the product key was invalid and thus had to speak to an operator ... then immediately installed the first set of serial key and gave the installation id generated out of it to the operator who in return gave me the product activvation id

,Shanmau,2012-01-29T11:34Z,"@ultrapulse,

Could you kindly explain your steps how to install this without any problem? 

Would I have to call somebody from Microsoft? What if they find out I have the pirated version when I give them a pirated code?

Kind regards."
,Shanmau,2012-01-30T11:58Z,"@ultrapulse

I followed your steps and it worked quite well untill I had to fill in the 8 rows of numbers (8 rows of 6 numbers) on the phone. 

I entered them all correct, however the computer voice said that I had become victim of a pirate group. 

Thus the ID given is invalid. I was not connected to any representative or whatever it just did not work.

This counts for the Dutch version (Netherlands).

Is there anyway to get more time to use word then the 30 days I am able to use it now?"

,Sinn3erman,2012-02-01T08:48Z,"This is a repost of TDAWG, but I wanted to put it at the end of the thread so it's easier to find.  Also, wanted to confirm a couple things, 1. the patch that I mentioned in my previous post is legit (I just didn't know what exactly it was or did, I just knew it was an update that changed things all of a sudden).  2.  ALL OLD PRODUCT KEYS WILL NOT WORK, so if you find one in this thread it WILL NOT WORK.  3.  I downloaded the toolkit in the info below and it took about 5 minutes to run.  It's a small file, but IT WORKS.  TDAWG thanks for sharing this info, I'm re posting so people have easier access to it.

Right click on the .iso
Choose ""Mount with Virtual Clone Drive""

Then select setup.exe

,Ninjamask,2012-05-02T02:42Z,"I just downloaded this. Have access to ALL programs, no errors, no warnings, no problems. I also NEVER leave comments and wanted to confirm this download as being legit. Some of you need to learn how to use these downloads before you bitch, Bitch."
,7deri,2012-05-03T01:42Z,"It didn't work, I installed it correctly (I am experienced with torrents) and when I opened up Microsoft Word it the trial pop-up came up. I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. If anyone could help me that'd be great."
,Choucroute,2012-05-04T20:19Z,Works fine for me! Thanks a lot!
,haveatit,2012-05-05T00:03Z,"So I had a previous version of Office that I DLed via torrent that all of the sudden started a 30 day countdown until I would be able to use it anymore without an activation key. 

I uninstalled that and then installed this. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until i opened a program and the same activation countdown box popped up at the same point as before. This makes me think there is a file somewhere else on my computer that tells Office that I need to activate with a new key that wasn't removed when I uninstalled the previous version. 

I bet those that are getting requests for activation codes are in the same boat. 

Help? Thoughts?"

,haveatit,2012-05-05T23:47Z,"This is working great!

@charan99
Thanks. That worked perfectly!"
,AppGenius,2012-05-11T18:17Z,"Microsoft Office is a very good program and this download doesn't crash and the program itself is very legitimate. I would recommend this download specifically to students. It works great at home, at school and at the office. Microsoft has done a very good job creating a piece of software like this."
,lolDROID,2012-05-14T10:03Z,"Actually, the file is fine. Obviously the method half of you gooks are using to install it is known as.. DOING IT WRONG. Easiest path goes as follows: Download ISO burner from @Active's website. Download the torrent. Use ISO burner to expand the image onto the disk (burn the shit on it). Open your cd drive... and then close it. IF it doesn't autoplay.. then navigate to your cd drive and double click the mother fucker. Oh, and btw, Visio is NOT included."

,opalwind,2012-05-17T21:39Z,Perfect! Had to use the EZ-Activator Toolkit (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6871839/Microsoft_Toolkit_2.3_b9_%28Windows_and_Office_2010_Activator) but after that it's all working perfectly. Thanks!
,wetheppl,2012-05-23T01:19Z,"Good torrent, Scanned clean. Very easy to use! Didn't even have to disable internet! (win 7 x64)"
,GEEK1945,2012-05-25T07:55Z,"Recommend REVO Uninstaller use trace install so you can COMPLETELY remove an app. Also make sure all hidden & system files is unchecked. You should be able to correct most bad/botched installs.

Thanks for this torrent"

,Saicotico,2012-06-11T03:57Z,"@mafirendon Relax! The Pirate Bay has switched from .torrent files to magnet files. What does this mean for you? Pretty much nothing, actually. uTorrent handles both filetypes just fine. The only thing YOU need to do differently is click ""GET THIS TORRENT"", next to the image of a magnet. Hope this helped!

Also, great torrent DeGun. Thanks!"

Thank you... and for those morons who threaten ""I wont seed it"" because of whatever reason are losers who download run and who NEVER SEED ANYWAY> So keep your idle stupid threats in kindergarten and while there get some computer training on how to download and follow instructions.
