,youreallgay,2010-06-15T11:48Z,So its a true story then.
,youreallgay,2010-06-15T11:50Z,Is it written by Alex Jones?
,nsofast,2010-06-16T17:29Z,"You dont have to be a conspiracy freak to like this show just like you did not have to believe in esp and ufos to love the x files. It really is quite good, give it a shot ."
,naturban,2010-06-19T14:08Z,"Alex Jones...?(!)
Don't drag good conspiracy theories down in the mud with him. He's delivering pure fantacy junk, tiny fragments of truth, desperately glued together, bad directing - Terrible craftmanship.
The miracle is that Alex got appeal among the public. Where did you all loose you're sence of reality..? Rubicon is promising though, as entertainment..."
