After crash-landing on a seemingly lifeless planet, pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and the remaining passengers -- including murderer Riddick (Vin Diesel) and policeman William J. Johns (Cole Hauser) -- encounter an army of creatures whose only weakness is light. As night approaches and the aliens emerge, the passengers must rely on Riddick's powerful night vision to lead them through the darkness in director David N. Twohy's sci-fi thriller.
