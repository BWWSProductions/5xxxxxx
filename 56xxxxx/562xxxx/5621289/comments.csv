[T],FatFreddy69,2010-06-29T18:03Z,"1) Russian: DTS 5.1, 48 kHz, 768 kbps (polyphonic, R5);
2) Russian: AC3 5.1, 48 kHz, 448 kbps (polyphonic, Positive-Multimedia);
3) Russian: DTS 5.1, 48 kHz, 1536 kbps (two-part, P. Glantz and Igor Korolev);
4) Russian: DTS 5.1, 48 kHz, 1536 kbps (monophonic, A. Gavrilov);
Brilliant, so one has to download ~4 GB of Russian audios even if we don't need it. When will you people start uploading the secondary audio tracks demuxed so we can choose what to download.  The Russian  is 1/3 of the movie. It's a shame.
I love this movie and love blue-ray quality but I'll stay out of this."

This is the correct bit rate for 1080p!! [It could be better...around 8000kbps!]


But wrong for not demuxing non-original audio streams
and include them in the torrent as separates files !"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-12T23:07Z,"I meant:

 This is the correct bit rate video for 720p [ for 1080p should be around 8000kbps ]."
