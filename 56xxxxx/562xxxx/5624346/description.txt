Chatwin was an extraordinary chap. For example. He joined
Sotheby's as a porter, and within a few years was their
impressionist paintings' 'expert'.

He's best known now as a travel writer; though his travels
usually had an end in mind. A fine details man. He brought
a similar acuity to his writing as he did to his examination
of objects d'art. His biographer said of him that he told
' ... not a half truth, but a truth and a half.'

This piece is about a trip he made to Moscow in 1973 to
track down survivors from the October 1917 Revolution's
Leftist Art Movement.
