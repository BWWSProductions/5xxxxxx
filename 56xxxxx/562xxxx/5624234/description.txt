How about an album featuring Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, John McLaughlin, Dick Heckstall-Smith AND Jon Hiseman?! And, oh yeah, Graham Bond, too much like John Mayall s various groups, Bond s bands, as proving grounds for soon-to-be superstars. often overshadowed the man at the center of them. For example, this record, though it came out in 1970, features Bruce, Baker and McLaughlin playing fairly straight-ahead jazz on three tracks recorded live at Klook s Kleek in 1963, a far cry from the heavy blues-rock and fusion that would later make them famous. The rest of the album is composed of 1966 tracks that mark the only recordings made by Bond with Heckstall-Smith and Hiseman before they left to form Colosseum (tellingly, the first track on their new band s debut album was a cover of Bond s 'Walkin in the Park', which appears here). These later tracks boast that uniquely Bond-ian mixture of R&B, jazz, blues and rock, and rank among his finest recordings.
