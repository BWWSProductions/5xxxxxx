Artist Matthews Southern Comfort 
Type Compilation 
Released November 03, 1997  


This is Matthews Southern Comfort's best compilation here; 19 tracks and 70' long in a Universal budget price collection. 
First I bought it for the "Woodstock" single flip side "Scion" available for the first time on CD and in stereo. 
Don't miss the awesome "And Me" taken for the Later That Same Year album; One of the strongest Iam Matthews songs. The vocal harmonies remind me CSN and CSN&Y. 
This CD contains the magnificent "Woodstock" composed by Joni Mitchell and covered by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. The 3 versions are so different and it's very strange that the most unknown band let it to #1 in Great Britain! A one hit wonder! 

Recommended to discover this beautiful band.
