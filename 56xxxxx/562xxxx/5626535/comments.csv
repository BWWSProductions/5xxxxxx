,shnugin,2010-10-06T21:53Z,seriously where is episode 24?
,kookoowaawaa,2010-10-07T08:30Z,"^clearly the file titled ""Brothers.and.Sisters.S04E18.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"" is 700.72 MiB / DOUBLE the size of other files and is infact BOTH parts 1 & 2 of the episode ""Time After Time"".

Yes, the ripper(s) made a naming mistake.. should have been S04E18E19 and the remaining episodes shifted accordingly. But understandable since both parts were aired on the same day as if one long episode!
