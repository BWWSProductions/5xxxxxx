[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T19:37Z,"@skillet92: It should be up 11 eleven minutes ago - but it's not.
I don't know can you understand the following:
Example

guy is on virginmedia cable. Cable, OK?
guy have received 102.4 MB - it is 104 857 Kb, OK?
He has shared - do you know how much?
672 kB... no kidding. 
Problem is that right here, on this torrent - 1 GIGABYTE SMALLER THAN SOURCE such hard-fisting morons - 384 same as aforementioned one - decided that is not enough and that they must save - more...
Well, price for that is both collective one and mainly collateral."
,P2P101,2010-06-12T19:57Z,Sorry to bother you but I was just wondering if you were going to up Stargate Universe?
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T20:09Z,"@P2P101: Sorry, no. SU has been gone with [quark]. Last week's episode was 272p - and now on best way to become obsolete frame-size. I wont allow to be pushed in Handhelds. My encodings are more versatile, no matter what some people think about."
,P2P101,2010-06-12T20:23Z,"OK, well thanks for the quick answer, and thank you for all the uploads..."
,skillet92,2010-06-12T20:25Z,"@Twentyforty :

,skillet92,2010-06-12T20:27Z,"seen the new release of THE A TEAM?

[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T20:49Z,"Well... go for it!!! It is surely awesome!!!




(kidding)
AC3 in untouched format since 80-ties. Last century.
I use AAC. Brand new encoding program written, modified and compiled by myself seven moths ago. Copyrighted 2005."
,skillet92,2010-06-12T22:16Z,"Thanks for the info bro.!
was really gonna go for it!"
,believenu,2010-06-12T22:47Z,thank you.
,Astug,2010-06-13T02:34Z,"Thanks 20-40, when I can't wait for an R5 or screener I always download your TS rips. But only than, because the quality of your dvdrips don't suffice for me. Though, I'm not complaining. I very much appreciate your work. Thanks!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-13T06:18Z,"@Astug: ""quality of your (my) dvdrips"" IS fantastic, regarding their ridiculously small size, mostly in 280-320 MB range.
Point me to one rip better than mine - same size and same title.
I bet you can't.
But, feel free to take from me just things which are ""meaningful"" for you. Anybody does that.
And seed 2 GIGA ones."
,Pothead808,2010-06-13T09:59Z,"twentyforty is FUCKING AWESOME ! !WOOO I IS DRUNK BUT U STILL AWESOME! thanks for all the work providing people with shitty internet with the option to get more for there byte. If you appreciate it too, then seed."
,believenu,2010-06-14T03:04Z,i just watched this d/l not bad as 20/40 says watchable ..liam is no George Peppard either..seed and share..
[T],houruoha,2010-06-14T04:10Z,"thanks
:)"
,Astug,2010-06-14T21:14Z,"@20-40

I said that the quality of your dvdrips don't ""SUFFICE FOR ME""(=aren't good enough for me). I never implied that your encodes suck or that they are worse than someone else's. I just prefer 480p/720p brrips (~1.4gb/3gb), that's solely my opinion. There's no need to get all cranky about it. I said thanks and I meant it.

I seeded to a 2:1 ratio, I think that's more than fair with all the leechers on tpb."
