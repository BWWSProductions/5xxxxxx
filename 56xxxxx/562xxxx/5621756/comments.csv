thanks for the rip :)"
,MonoKulen,2010-12-26T10:17Z,One of the best rips I saw. Great video quality. Thanks!
,EiNST3iN,2011-03-24T02:45Z,.mkv file. What do I do with this? I get an error everytime I try anything with it. Why cant these be put in .mp4 or .avi format like normal?
,bigdump,2011-03-25T02:57Z,"@EiNST3iN:
normal?? mkv is far superior because it allows multiple audio tracks and other info to be stored... it outclasses avi in almost every respect... mp4 is really good for nothing.... i'd say most people prefer mkv these days... you should really research the facts before using words like 'normal', as it shows you don't know what you're talking about... anyway, download vlc player and start using that for everything from now on.... you really chose the wrong username..."
,albokid89,2011-05-31T22:15Z,very good! +1

You've chosen the correct username, because what you just said was plain and simple bullshit.

""you should really research the facts before using words like 'normal'""

Normal is what most people use. What is considered normal, is basicly just a matter of statistics. MKV has its advantages of course, but it's still not as popular as AVI or MPEG.

66% of all web video is actually H.264, which makes it the most popular and 'normal'."

What the f..., are you talking about, Einstein over there starts bitching about a high quality file, gratefully shared by someone asking nothing in return, without even saying THANKS or in his case PLEASE HELP I'M A MORON??? Big Dump has a point, this guy is bragging about ""normal""  and he's not using VLC??? 
Who's the big dump now????

Thanks YIFI.
