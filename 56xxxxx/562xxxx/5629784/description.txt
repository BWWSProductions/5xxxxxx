Seven world renowned Oxford Plug-ins in a single bundle.
Contains: Oxford EQ, Oxford Dynamics, Oxford Inflator, ?Oxford Transient 
Modulator, Oxford Reverb, Oxford Limiter and Oxford SuprEsser

Sonnox Oxford SuprEsser
The Oxford SuprEsser is both a very highly-featured professional De-Esser and a 
Dynamic EQ. There is a simple mode for quick fixes, but also an advanced mode 
for increased functionality and fine-tuning. The combination of an intuitive FFT 
display and three listen modes enables the user to easily see and hear exactly 
where the problem frequencies are, allowing the rapid reduction or removal of 
the offending audio. As well as being able to trigger the full band compression, 
only the offending frequencies can be carefully carved out. Since the SuprEsser 
can operate at all frequencies, â€˜plosivesâ€™ and other annoyances can also be 
removed effortlessly, making it more than a simple De-Esser. Additional features 
include Automatic Level Tracking, Linear Phase Filtering and a Wet/Dry blend 
control for final balancing.

Sonnox Oxford Transient Modulator
The Transient Modulator is an application that allows dynamic level of signals 
to be modified by the transients in the programme material over time. The effect 
is to bring transient events in the programme forwards, or push them into to the 
background, such that the attacks of instruments can be accentuated or softened 
depending on settings.

Sonnox Oxford Reverb
The Oxford Reverb plug-in is a highly flexible stereo reverberation generator, 
designed to complement existing Sonnox Oxford applications in providing the user 
with the highest technical and sonic performance coupled with artistic and 
creative facility. As well as providing stunning presets, the user has full 
control over all of its many parameters, including a very comprehensive early 
reflections section, and integrated 5-band EQ. The Sonnox Oxford Reverb allows 
the powerful facility to create virtual spaces freely, depending on artistic 
need, ranging from dry reflection ambiences, room and hall simulations, sound 
effects, all the way to wide open reverberant spaces with a very large range of 
possible texture and spatial character.

Sonnox Oxford Limiter
The Oxford Limiter has been developed from decades of professional audio 
experience to provide a very high degree of quality and facility in programme 
loudness control and limiting functions. By employing highly accurate 
logarithmic side chain processing, along with innovative adaptive timing 
functionality using 
look ahead signal acquisition, the limiter provides exemplary performance, 
whether one is seeking general transparent level control, programme loudness 
maximisation or heavily applied artistic sound effects. 

Unique processing in the form of the Enhance function provides the sample value 
limiting needed to reliably avoid overloads in digital workstation environments 
and allows unprecedented volume and punch to be applied to programme beyond that 
available from conventional limiting functions. 

Comprehensive metering is provided which displays not only conventional peak 
sample value, but additionally allows the user to monitor the true validity of 
the programme in order to avoid the generation of damaging reconstruction 
overloads in the target equipment which are often invisible during production 
(sometimes termed 'inter sample peaks'). 

A further function allows the user to dynamically correct for reconstruction 
overloads in real time, thereby achieving maximum possible modulation levels 
without the risks of producing illegal signals often associated with compression 
and limiting.

Comprehensive dithering functionality with selectable and variable depth noise 
shaping ensures first class mastering output quality in either 24 bit or 16 bit 
modes.

Sonnox Oxford EQ
The EQ plug-in is based on the OXF-R3 EQ section. It is a fully functional 5-band 
application with selectable shelf settings on LF and HF sections. Additionally, 
separate variable slope low pass and high pass filters are provided. The EQ also 
features 4 different selectable EQ types that cover most of the EQ styles 
currently popular amongst professional users, including some legacy styles 
which are renowned for their artistic capability. The use of novel coefficient 
generation and intelligent processing design provides unparalleled performance 
that surpasses analogue EQ in both sound quality and artistic freedom. This 
plug-in may well provide all the EQ you ever needed.

Sonnox Oxford Dynamics
The Oxford Dynamics plug-in is modeled on the extremely flexible and capable 
unit used in the OXF-R3 professional mixing console. Resulting from many years 
research into professional dynamics applications, it offers separate Compress, 
Limit, Expand, Gate and side chain EQ functions, with full independent control 
of all parameters. Features such as selectable time constant curves and variable 
soft compress functions allow the user to confidently tackle all common uses of 
compression, from subtle unobtrusive level control and mastering functions to the 
production of great artistic effects. The use of a feed-forward architecture with 
logarithmic side chain processing, making use of look-ahead techniques, ensures 
exemplary sonic characteristics and dynamic accuracy, with an artistic capability 
simply unavailable from other single units, analogue or digital. This highly 
sophisticated and professional product has the power and flexibility to obviate 
the need for many of the separate applications most users keep for specific uses.

Sonnox Oxford Inflator
The Inflator is a unique process that can provide an increase in the apparent 
loudness of almost any programme, without obvious loss of quality or audible 
reduction of dynamic range, yet avoiding damaging increases in the peak level 
of the signal. The inflator process can also bring power, presence and warmth 
to programme material and even provide headroom overload margin above digital 
maximum with a subtlety and musical character reminiscent of tube systems.

Use the Inflator to produce louder mixes than you thought possible without 
overloads or compression pumping, or use it to add natural warmth and character 
to acoustic or jazz mixes.
