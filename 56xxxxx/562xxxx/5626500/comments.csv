,Wing_Chunner,2010-06-14T07:19Z,"""Crossing the Rubicon"" is a popular idiom meaning to pass a point of no return, often used by journalists in newspapers. It refers to Julius Caesar's 49 BC crossing of the river, which was considered an act of war. "

""Crossing the rubicon"" is more than just an act of war.  It's an act of sedition, treason.

The Roman Legions could not enter the city of Rome, by law and to prevent coups, and the Rubicon River was chosen as the demarcation point for the farthest south that northern legions could travel.

And in case you were wondering, the Rubicon of Western Democracry was crossed shortly after World War II began, when three leaders met in Malta, Teheran and elsewhere to discuss the new world order after the war.  Most people just don't realize it, yet, because they are being fed information by the same institutions that were put in place to establish that new world order (not the Alex Jones/Anarchist ""New World Order"", but the one that actually exists as the world we live in.)
