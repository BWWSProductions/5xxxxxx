This the Ultimate Version of Windows 7.
It is the 32bit Version.
Three activators are included in the File.
Take the iso, and burn it to a DVD. Then restart the computer and click F12 and boot from DVD. Finish Installation.
After that, run the activators till you get it activated. (I got it on first try).
Once activated, it will be a completely genuine Windows. It will be the same as if you bought it but without the expense.

Thank you.
