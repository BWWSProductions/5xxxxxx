,kshste,2010-06-12T20:18Z,"I sincerely hope this is in E-N-G-L-I-S-H
& NOT IN RUSSIAN OR SPANISH LIKE OTHER DECEIVING TORRENTS HERE!!"
,kshste,2010-06-12T20:19Z,Alright a +1 for it being in English.
,accurate-psychic,2010-06-12T23:12Z,"Awesome UL time, thanks to all the seeders!
For a cam I would say A/7 V/7. Audio has a slight echo but hey it's a cam :)

,The_Real_Verdict,2010-06-15T16:21Z,"Thanks! would rate it as watchable, but maby not on a big screen.
V/6
A/5"
,girlygirl79,2010-06-16T03:10Z,"It is in English.  Going to wait for a rip before watching though, after viewing the sample.  A lot of echo, fuzzy image.  Worth waiting. "
,Imjustconfused_,2010-06-16T12:20Z,"Pretty good for a cam-version. The video is good, but the sound is just okay.. Sometimes, you can hardly hear what they're saying so you might want subs. It still gets +1 in quality from me"
,MsuSpartanLax,2010-06-18T20:59Z,This torrent is being Monitored by Warner Brothers and participants are being reported to their ISP's.  Be warned.
,Bobman84,2010-06-19T11:34Z,"MsuSpartanLax, you sound just as foolish as the folks who used to say Microsoft were sending teams of ninjas to people's homes when they entered a keygen serial in Windows 98. Seriously, get a grip!"
,ZDaddy,2010-06-21T06:09Z,"Appreciate the upload! I'd say accurate-psychic was dead on .. A/7, V/7"
,toadpilz,2010-06-21T17:00Z,"thx - and THX for the blurry picture, otherwise these old hags would have made me blind"
,Ganawa,2010-06-25T23:42Z,"I am getting really tired of your chauvinistic and racist comments against other languages than English, first of all this a Swedish web located somewhere in Europe, (Bravo Sverige! Jag hälsar dig, vänaste land uppå jord... )   
second this is a global community and everyone shall be welcome no matter culture, language, sex or whatever!. Something different is the terrible practice of dubbing movies, which I am really against because it really sucks! 
De lo que no hay duda es que los españoles estamos tomando este sitio?  ;-) "
,HCCXYZR46,2010-06-30T15:58Z,"A-5

,paddotrip,2010-07-18T05:56Z,haha cant believe someone accually went to the cinema for this. 
,bpc613,2010-07-20T03:50Z,How come when I downloaded this and the Sex and the City 2 XviD-Fusion [2010] Eng version they both say I need the x3 player?
