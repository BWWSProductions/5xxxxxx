Desc: A secret expedition, to a South Pacific island,
is searching for an unknown deadly virus. Loren 
Mercer, ex-Navy pilot, is in the South Pacific looking
for her ex-boyfriend, Captain John Lightfoot; who 
disappeared while on a secret mission. What Mercer 
doesn't know is that Lightfoot collided with an alien 
spacecraft that discharged biological material all 
over the island that they are heading for. The mortal
virus seems to be transmitted by what the natives 
call a "very large" spider. As the scientific 
expedition makes its way to the other side of the 
island, it becomes obvious that it has turned into
a tasty dish for the bloodthirsty giant-spider with
a vicious killer instinct. Before they can save the 
world, they must try to save themselves!...

Notes: Another SciFi B-Movie. I'm capping a few of 
these this weekend. Quality is analog TVrip, so you
know what to expect...
