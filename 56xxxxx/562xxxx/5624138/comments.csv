Copy and Paste this lot, this will get you out of hot water for your next upload.. the udp denis tracker is automatically added when you use the TPB..
i just had a look at your torrent and you have 1 tracker working.. and it didn't even start my download! because you either have the upload set at something small due to either you don't like to seed what you download or its the way you have set it... so if your using utorrent set up and down on unlimited... :)))"
