This is from the first season of the podcast Mysterious Universe

Episodes 8-25

It starts at episode eight because the first 7 were unreleased.
The first seven were released with the back catalog USB stick but they were soon taken off the market due to copyrights on some of the music used in them.
Talk to me about those episodes.

Just a little longer till I post the whole back catalog!!!

I hope you enjoy!
