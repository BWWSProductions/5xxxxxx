Technical Presentation by Graham Hartnel

Broadcast - not sure. I recorded it off the World Service
ten or so years back, but it's much older than that.
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

Frankenstein type fantasy in which a prole's heart is grafted
into a mongrel dog which then attacks its masters ... loosely
hidden attack on the way the Russian Revolution was turning out.

Fortunately for Bulgakov, Stalin could stand a certain amount
of criticism from artists. It's no 'Master and Margarita', but
good fun all the same.
