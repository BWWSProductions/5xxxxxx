,warshak88,2010-06-24T08:55Z,hey man tnx for d upload... but gotta problem here. nero detected pirated serial number...please consider upgrading with a special discount
,crossfire6,2010-06-28T04:49Z,"warshak88 speaks the truth.  I have now tried to install and use 4 different of these uploads for Nero 10.  Each time it ""appears"" to have installed correctly.  But as soon as you try to actually DO anything with it, such as use nero vision, you get shut down at that time due to Nero having detected a pirated serial.
I appreciate these Nero 10 uploads - I know that people put great time and effort into it, as I have spent at least 12-16 hours myself attempting to install and use them.  But I'm done with it and just sticking with Nero 9."
,sanchit9282,2010-06-28T06:04Z,"But evn i m using it without facing ny of these problems,mine is working perfectly......I wl soon post eithr some other serials or a solution for it...."
,sc4nut,2010-07-05T08:26Z,It could be phoning home to check the serial like some adobe products.. anyone confirm?
,saliba__charbel,2010-07-28T16:42Z,"is this nero for CD only??
because i cant burn DVD !!!:S:S"
,floorman1,2010-07-31T16:15Z,"nero HAS ALWAYS PHONED HOME,
The idea is to NOT update pirated software people.Block it in your firewall b4 running it.

Like stealing a car from a car dealer and then taking it back to them to do the servicing. LOL"

,ohshitabluescreen,2010-08-25T11:51Z,"***!!!TROJAN FOUND IN RAR!!!***
(using spyware doc)
Is this a recent addition, as nobody else seems to have detected it early on???"
,EXPIRIEN,2010-09-01T13:46Z,tryed to burn movie but it just noticed it was pirated and could not do shit from there
,waseem3000,2010-09-06T18:34Z,"Ok everyone facing problem with Nero Patent Activation i.e. Nero Vision saying it is pirated etc etc. follow these steps:

Download this torrent and install nero, can also be downloaded from nero website which is the trial version.

Open keygen and use 9X03-016C-MXEX-4536-T0L7-2W2T-AMPX-97TA which is for Nero Multimedia Suite to install. Before installer starts it may restart the computer once and there will be a key already present in the key field once it does so, delete that key and use this.

Install complete software and then close the installer when it finishes (it takes time to do so for installing).

Now again get back to the keygen and generate key for Activar Patentes 1E30-9XK2-192A-X2X0-5746-A632-ECCK which will be this one. To enter this key go to your start menu>all programs>Nero 10 and open Nero Control Center inside the menu and under serial number field enter the key. If using Vista or Win 7 accept the security popup to enter the serial. It will accept serial and show ""Activation"".

Now do the same steps and add the following keys for Bluetooth plugins and Recode.
1EE0-4X07-194A-0K04-9E21-73XA-XAA3
1E31-9ME5-988X-447E-9A21-69X8-XX2X
4E31-5X1X-9990-0KE9-X1AM-9K9K-C9C5
the program will accept them again as ""Activation"".

These keys will activate mp3 plugins, gracenote and DTS plugin and with each serial entered the program will inform you of the serial entered and you get the names for only these:
1K00-6035-0593-5A40-37K0-K776-574C
KC00-203X-1886-2446-051E-54C2-XC60
1EC0-0E89-9849-KA31-K227-MA85-3812

After that press ok and you are good to go. Now if you follow this step-by-step all will work 100 percent. Better to restart the computer so everything works smoothly (not needed and up to you).

You can use the same keys posted here as keygen ONLY generates these keys and one for each listing and save you time as well by using them as I already pasted them.

I have tested this and it works without issues. Now how do I know it works as have a lot of experience fixing computers and have used the above in many computers without failure. So hope I can help and many thanks to the uploader.

Sorry for the loooong post."
,DragonRider65,2010-09-10T20:40Z,"I installed this and it went in until I tried to convert a movie; then it detected pirated serial. i will try it again, I don't like not being able to get something working when someone else says it worked for them? Using pirated shit can be a bit tricky sometimes, so i will try this and if it works I'll come back and let you all know. I'll do it the way waseem3000 says and see what happens...?"
,DragonRider65,2010-09-11T00:47Z,"Hey y'all, waseem3000 was right; I had this downloaded before and thought I knew what I was doing and Nero popped up with the ""We have detected you are using a pirated serial number"" message on me so I uninstalled it and gave up. I tried it again this afternoon and carefully followed the directions and it works! I am now downloading and installing the free Template Packs that come with a paid program! Awesome, I have liked this program for a long time and needed it for my laptop! I use Nero 7 in my Desktop PC and I'll probably just keep that there, but this is great to have in my laptop for quick use. All you guys that think there is a trojan or whatever in this download, I can assure you, there is not. I am using this and I will continue to seed as well. I may just create and upload another torrent with this so I can write in the clear instructions on how to use this? Look for quality clear and useful torrents here from dragonRider65 guys. Peace."
