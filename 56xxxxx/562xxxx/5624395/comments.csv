,TheNameOf,2010-06-21T08:33Z,"This is the first time a found a virus in a torrent. Usaully they don't have any seeders when they have one. Something strange about this. Misfiled not labeled and bad description on a trap. just does not sound right.

phooeyF and pirate.V not only knew what the torrent was but didn't see the virus. 

phooey sounds phony and pirate V sounds generic. 

something is not right."

,DoneStart,2010-06-30T14:45Z,"It's Microsoft Office Pro 2007. Why this is in the ""pron"" section is over my head. "
,mrvoor,2010-08-04T20:14Z,"140 seeders.......?!?.....but there is MS Office inside this torrent as DoneStart said.
