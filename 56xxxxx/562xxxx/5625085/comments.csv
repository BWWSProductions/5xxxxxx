,wDouglas,2010-06-14T02:32Z,does it work?
,aronBack,2010-06-14T03:50Z,"Does it work with GMA950?

,macterror,2010-06-14T13:52Z,"Port Info:
CXZ Aquamarine Engine you need

- CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor
- RAM: 1024 MB

Don't think this will run well on GMA chips, but you're free to try!

3. Known Issues:
- no mouse in menu, just use your arrow keys to navigate it.
- holographic eye candy doesn't exist
- in space the planet misses
- mouse might be a bit sluggish at times

,OnlyAntony,2010-06-20T17:39Z,It plays but i can not see anything in the game
,Pluto_999,2010-06-21T11:20Z,"The game works in OS X 10.6.3 and above. Won't work properly on older OS X versions - severe graphics bugs (missing walls and other objects). Tested and confirmed by many users on other trackers.

Known issues:
- no mouse in menu
- 'ghost' cursor
- missing EA logo on the first screen, missing menus and messages frames, missing pictures on the level loading screens
- spaceship virtual control panels and virtual space maps are invisible
- the first scene (crash) is rendered with errors - the planet in the outer space on the left on the screen is missing and most other objects in the outer space too (see the beginning of the game trailer (in the EXTRAS folder) for proper picture) and the lighting is invalid
