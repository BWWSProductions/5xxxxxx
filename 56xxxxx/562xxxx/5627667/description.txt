A postal inspector finds himself caught in a sticky situation as he tries to pin a rap for mail theft upon the owner of a prominent nightclub owner. The owner is guilty and only stole the mail so he could get the money he needs to pay off a murderous and impatient loan shark. Unfortunately, upon opening the mail sack, he discovers it filled with inane mail-order gadgets and a few letters. Meanwhile as the intrepid inspector closes in, he finds himself falling in love with a singer.
