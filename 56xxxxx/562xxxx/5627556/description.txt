Release Notes:
first thanks to relizlab for video, and imagine for audio...loaded the file into vdub, added quite a few filters...fixed
the resolution to a little bigger than source..then added a denoise filter slightly, then slightly changed saturation..
tweaked all the colors, and bg colors..then i added a sharpness filter, new one not tried it before seemed it worked pretty
good...tweaked brightness and contrast, tried to get the colors not overpowering, hence delay . The subtitles, are not really
mandatory, as its only for titles. we have another version of this movie with longer runtime, but has small resolution, so will
take a look within next few hours..anyway overall, im pretty happy with this encode, hope you apreciate the effort Enjoy
