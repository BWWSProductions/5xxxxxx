Wikipedia............: Sonny and her mom start watching "Mackenzie Falls" and eventually become addicted to it. When the season finale is coming up, Sonny can't wait for it and just asks Chad what happens between Mackenzie and Chloe in the finale, though she words it as if she wants him to ask her out instead, which he does. When the other the "So Random!" cast members finds out Sonny is watching "Mackenzie Falls", they disapprove and Sonny is afraid to tell them about her and Chad. Meanwhile, the cast are working on Astronomy projects and Grady and Nico try to find a way to get Sonny to do it for them.
