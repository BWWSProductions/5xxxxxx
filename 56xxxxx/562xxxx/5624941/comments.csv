The only downside is the format they're in.
It's not impossible, but just a slight pain in the ass."

,syl3r,2010-09-27T03:59Z,@Insaneputobiatch that is the name of the band google it and thanks uploader
,infantsorrow,2010-09-27T04:52Z,"Thanks sooo much for uploading it encoded with AAC Codec.
The sound quality is so much better than mp3.
@underoath281
mp3 is a pain in my ear!
Try to compair aac and mp3 on a good hifi system and you will hear the difference. with acceptable earphones the difference is already hearable.
AAC is based on a better perceptive model and doesn't do low pass filtering (at 18khz on mp3 codec)  before quantising the signal"
