Though kudos on managing to beat the big teams (hermes, TvTeam, etc) on time..."
,Green_Banana,2010-06-12T21:06Z,"It's easy to get it up on time if you don't spend moments scratching yourself first.  I'm just wary of this ""spot"" at the beginning.  Is it a TV spot advertisement, or some kind of visual glitch probably relating to disintegrated computer code?  "
,cndkp,2010-06-12T21:07Z,Thanks !
,meggyesiz,2010-06-12T21:08Z,"We will possibly never know, as the seedbox seems down, so we can't get the file..."
,bubblegumjimmy,2010-06-12T21:09Z,"It's a TV spot, that lasts around 10 seconds and then dw begins."
,bubblegumjimmy,2010-06-12T21:17Z,"I'm seeding, my friend has no problem downloading it... and at the beginning is a tv spot (10 sec) and then dw starts"

,mascan42,2010-06-12T21:58Z,"No video, audio only."
,kalizec,2010-06-12T21:58Z,"The file is listed as XviD. When I use Gspot to try and determine the codec type however it finds it's a MPEG2 transportstream.

Basically, the uploader doesn't know his codecs.

PS. This doesn't play in MPC or MWP for that matter."
,kalizec,2010-06-12T22:03Z,"Doesn't work in MPC, MPC-HC, VLC or WMP + CCCP. Only audio, no video.

People here are probably better off with http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5623632/Doctor.Who.2005.S05E11.HDTV.XviD-BiA%5BTZ%5D"
,avrjoe,2010-06-12T22:31Z,"Damn it's almost 400MB, is there anyone that got the video part to play?"

,koriordan,2010-06-12T23:58Z,"Dud torrent. Looks like a cam rip, and the frame rate is all over the shop."
,Rakkers,2010-06-13T00:34Z,"Frame rate is terribad... My advice - wait until one of the other torrents picks up, unless you're in a hurry and don't care about abysmal frame rate.

Plus the commercials it shows first are kinda silly."
,cndkp,2010-06-13T00:43Z,"Yeah bad quality but great episode. 

Use KMPlayer if you only have the audio."
