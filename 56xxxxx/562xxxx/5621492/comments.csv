,Ted_Sheckler,2010-06-23T19:00Z,"People, seriously, read the comments before you all start flipping out that MG is missing. She clearly said ""06-14-10: Heads up: No new ups from me until later this evening, same with tomorrow. Then I'm leaving the country so I won't be able to up anything until maybe next Wednesday."" NEXT Wednesday, meaning today. Also, MAYBE. So chill, it'll all be back to normal soon."
