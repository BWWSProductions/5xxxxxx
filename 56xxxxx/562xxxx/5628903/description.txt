Combo updater for 10.6.4 (10F569), which is the final build.

Combo update is for any version of Snow Leopard prior to 10.6.3, ie if you're on 10.6.0, 10.6.1, or 10.6.2. 

If you're on 10.6.3 (or a previous 10.6.4 beta), then you might want to download the smaller delta updater.

Reversioner included for those running a current 10.6.4 beta who want to revert to 10.6.3 first (not usually needed however).
