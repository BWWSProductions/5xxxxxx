A pampered African prince (Eddie Murphy) wants more out of life than the beautiful woman to whom he's engaged. So, he heads to America to find a mate who will fall for him, not his riches. Joined by his trusty sidekick (Arsenio Hall), the prince plunges into a low-paying job at a fast-food chain -- and a romance with the boss's daughter. Murphy and Hall play a range of colorful characters, thanks to hilarious makeup wizardry.
