,GReddyGen,2010-06-12T23:19Z,I'd really like some feedback on it.  Please let me know if it works or if you're having problems.
,opetrovics,2010-06-12T23:52Z,Maybe only one think.This map pack only for JTAG Hacked xbox360 good.THX. I can't whit MODIO this resign und rehash. :-(
,opetrovics,2010-06-12T23:55Z,"My xbox360 see this pack,not corrupt,but I dont found the new map in the game. Enyone help?"
,GReddyGen,2010-06-12T23:58Z,"Try putting it on the harddrive and then download it from the marketplace, it may say you already have it but download again.  My friend said that works with marketplace items"
,GReddyGen,2010-06-13T00:01Z,or try running the Resurgence playlist at the bottom of the find match list
,opetrovics,2010-06-13T00:29Z,"Hi. I try out all,not running. :-( Sorry,I thing this only for JTAG good."
,GReddyGen,2010-06-13T19:38Z,"I believe you have to change both.  To get these items, open your gamer profile file with Modio and it will give you both."
,fddrummer,2010-06-14T20:35Z,"In order to test this, I injected it into the same directory as I have my purchased Stimulus package. On the dashboard, my Xbox can see both map packs and both are listed as Marketplace Content. Going into the game, however, I am still not able to play the maps. I checked my Stimulus package, and the Device ID and all of those numbers are 0's, just like this file. 

Not sure if its possible to get this working, but if anyone has, please let us know how."
,maxpan90,2010-06-14T21:34Z,"OMG same here this don't work

Modio will not let me rehash and redisgn the file can someone help?

manzed"
,JohnHolmesII,2010-06-14T21:39Z,"I put my profile on an xbox 360 memcard and took it to my friends house. I had already purchased the stimulus pack and wanted to give it to him. It remembered me in the marketplace, so I hit download again. They could play it. But as soon as I took my profile back to my house, it stopped working. Whenever I sign in on theirs, then sign back out, it still wors. If My profile is removed, it fails. Any ideas as to why this happened, because it may solve the problem we are all having here."
,JohnHolmesII,2010-06-14T21:41Z,"And by the way, whenever i try to open it in modio, it fuckin freezes. If i open task manager, it says 500,000 K. i only have 1 gig of RAM, does this mean that i am approaches zero memory? which would mean im fucked?"
,maxpan90,2010-06-14T23:45Z,Can someone please give us a step by step guide on how to do this?/????
,fddrummer,2010-06-15T02:55Z,"nightmare--

as per your instructions, i transferred my Live profile to a usb drive, opened said drive with usb xtaf, opened the content folder, and injected the 0000000000 folder and its contents there. The map pack shows up in the dashboard, but if I go to matchmaking it does not allow me to play the resurgence playlists. Did you have success with playing this?"
,maxpan90,2010-06-15T17:55Z,"fddrummer ---

Same here i've done exactly what nightmare said but it only says the resurgency pack on the 360 dashboard but it won't let me actually use the map"
,maxpan90,2010-06-15T18:22Z,how to you rehash and redisgn the map pack so that it works it won't let me rehash and redisgn
,GReddyGen,2010-08-16T06:29Z,"Sorry guys, I did it exactly how I said and it worked when I put it on my friend's xbox.  Sorry if it didn't work for you guys but hey, at least it doesn't have a virus right?"
,cracky6711,2011-04-17T14:11Z,"I'll download this when i get the chance, but here's an idea, everyone's saying their dashboard recognizes it but it doesn't work in game, try then going to content download and if it says you have already downloaded it download it again and see if that works :) if not then i can't help :/"
