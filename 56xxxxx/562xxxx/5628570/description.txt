"The Edge"

While the group attempts to understand why they 
were kidnapped, Moira (Tina Holmes) painfully 
removes the implant device that has been 
embedded in each person's thigh. Elsewhere, 
trying to escape back to their normal lives, 
Joe (Jason Wiles) and McNair (Chadwick Boseman) 
carefully test the limits of the invisible 
fence. Meanwhile, back in San Francisco, 
curious reporter Renbe's (Gerald Kyd) search 
for information on missing mom Janet (Daisy 
Betts) hits a dead end.

Enjoy :)
