,jamieti,2010-06-13T07:03Z,when played on ps3 it goes crazy sound 
,jamieti,2010-06-13T07:04Z,good quality though 7-7
,teflondon64,2010-06-13T07:57Z,are you going to get splice?
,alanba01,2010-06-13T19:18Z,"WTF!  MPC won't play this movie, or just plays video and no audio.  VLC plays video, but no audio, same with Nero.  GSpot shows AC3 audio, but unknown video.  Avidemux plays both audio and video.  

Thanks for the upload, but what the hell is going on here?"
,masseur,2010-06-13T19:52Z,"more info, samples, download links:

,alanba01,2010-06-13T19:58Z,"Well, it plays audio in Nandub also.  I've got the latest AC3 Filter, and it obviously works, and several other AC3 movies I have still work fine in MPC or VLC.

I'm at a loss on what this problem is, I guess I'll steer away from WBZ releases in the future.  Again, thanks for the upload Raymond, it just isn't working for me."
,chaosincsdmf,2010-06-15T03:31Z,thanks Raymond great torrent exc. vid and sound..i seeded all night after d/l so hope everyone was happy
