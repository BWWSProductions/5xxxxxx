Why do you say ""cant play my file. Use ** codec pack"" ???  Can't VLC media player read it anyway?

I didn't try (not even d/l your torrent) cuz I already started to D/l SEASON 11 from s/b else. So It would be great to tell us if VLC can read the files WITHOUT having to download the ""Combined Community Codec Pack""...
Thanks

P.S. I'm impressed how small this torrent is. Is it becuz it's matroska?"
,VivZ,2011-05-07T16:49Z,Appreciate the size.Thanks.

Can you upload the seasons 1-10 too? You're doing a great work. Keep it up! "
,killeurkilleur,2011-09-24T14:22Z,thanks a lot man...!!! what about season 10 ??
,ptv83,2011-09-26T16:15Z,"wmp cannot play file. the player might not support the file type (MKV and it does, watch all sorts of mkv files all the time) or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.

Klite full pack x 64 ..wmp classic wont play it any of the episodes either... an i refuse to install vlc, there's no need for it... thanks for the upload... but no thanks for the way these mkv were coded."
,ptv83,2011-09-26T16:18Z,"hmmm.. bit embarrasing... i closed wmp player waited 10 seconds and retried.. and they now work... i was watching  an AI from {C_} before ... something wierd happened by not closing WMP before playing these MKV's .. never had that before.

good mental note.... go figure."
