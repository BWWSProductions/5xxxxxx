[V],jainmehul,2010-06-11T19:53Z,"thanx globe u uploaded this on my request bt plzzz can u give a file for sound

this game cannnnnnot be enjoyed without sound!!!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-11T22:27Z,"To gane69 : it is lovely gameplay and i think you need to go to school to learn to read , i downloaded this game 2 times from nice torrent files and it was like that , i download the first one and when i checked the sound like that , i download a second one that have the same situation and for a Wii iso :

IT IS 700 MB OFF WITH NORMAL CORRECT WORK , AFTER 5 OR 10 GAMES LIKE THIS IF IT IS POSSIBLE DO THIS TYPE OF WORK IT WILL BE 4 OR 5 GB LESS IN REAL SPACE IN YOUR HARD DRIVE FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF GAMES , SO :

WITH GLOBE@ FILES THE WORLD IS YOURS !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-12T00:02Z,"This new comment is just for saying that beside the real nice work with 700 mb off and complete game anyway and more and more users getting the game that i don´t understand the decrease in 20 seeds or more in the last 2 hours , as i know i didn´t made anything wrong and it is the possible work because the other files are like this ans still 700 mb off in single wii game to the pc emulator . "
,razor2890,2010-06-12T02:07Z,"Hey Globe@ was waiting 4 ur release

,gane69,2010-06-12T07:32Z,"@GLOBE Thats a lame excuse blobe.U better upload a ""PROPER"" version of this torrent which has sound! 

@jainmehul  This is a wii game iso dude.i dont think u can add sound files like we do for pc games."
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-12T12:40Z,"this will not work in pc?????

the torrent says ""Wii 4 PC"" what does that means?????"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-12T15:44Z,"I don´t like to be repetotive but i made a good effort to see if was possible sound and it wassn´t , that´s all but it is nice gameplay no doubt .
Wii 4 PC means wii games that you can play on the PC using a emularor ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-12T15:46Z,"i mean emulator at the end of the before comment , i missed a letter  there , i just hope that don´t happen on this one too or it will be ridiculous . Happy gaming everyone ."
