I think I fixed the problem. I see it seeding in Vuze so hopefully it works this time.

Pulled off of VHS, quality isn't perfect but it is watchable.
I have the first 6 years to upload.
Let me know if you want more, depending on the response I can upload individual episodes or in larger chunks.

My seeding schedule is a little sparse during the week but on weekends I will seed it! So if you download it during the week please be patient.

I am looking for episodes from 1991 and on.
