Homicide detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) pursues a killer down a bustling sidewalk. There she is: a small middle-aged woman. No, wait: the killer is the timid man beside her. Now its someone else. It's all and none of them. Because the murderer Hobbes seeks is a demon passing from one human host to another with a brush of an overcoat or touch of a hand.

Hobbes stalks a seemingly immortal foe in 'Fallen', an intense thriller co-starring John Goodman and Donald Sutherland. An ages-old evil faces a shattering showdown with one clever tenacious man.
