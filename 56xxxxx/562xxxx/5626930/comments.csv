Once you have internet connection the program accesses the website and disables your hacked-key"

,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-07-18T20:28Z,"Awesome tool!  HOWEVER, it seems to be very vulnerable to being wrecked by the evil company.  They force uninstall:
1.  If you are connected to the internet more than a few minutes. (How to block this???)
2.  If you have already used this serial number on the same computer with another drive.
Sorry, but I don't have the skills you guys do to fix this.  HELP PLEASE???"
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-07-21T01:31Z,"My need was to Password Protect 500GB USB Drives - portable.  As best I know how I blocked this program with windows firewall, yet within an hour it told me ""License Expired""  ""Uninstall,""  as have all the other versions of USB Secure here on PirateBay.

STORAGECRYPT, here on PirateBay - AWESOME.  As fast as USB Secure, as simple, as easy...  STORAGECRYPT STORAGECRYPT...!!!

If I find problems, I'll let you know."
