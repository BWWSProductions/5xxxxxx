Thanks for the encode/upload.

I'm glad you've put this in your schedule. Nice turnaround that humans are worse than 'demons'.

American chritians must already be trying to ban this.

Cheers

Although right here and now I am claiming 'chritians' as my own neologism.

It's not a partiuclarly good neologism, see Finegams Wake by Joyce or Jabberwocky by Carroll for true examples of this speciality.

However, I mis-typed and now I am claiming the word. It can mean whatever you 'understand' it to mean but to me it is evokes an image of a 'nutty-christian'. 
'Nutty' being used in the retarded brain function sense. 

Tea-Baggers is another description for them and while not a true neologism it emotes the correct image.

Wow, all that from a single mis-type.

I am soooooo boring!!!

Cheers
