Every single episode has a different end credits song that is specially selected for that episode and for the vibe of the final scenes.
YOU ARE CUTTING OFF THE SHOW ITSELF.  SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR THE SHOW."

Otherwise shut up, this is free and you can't complain...wait for the DVD or download from somewhere else if you have to see the credits thanks!  Thanks eztv!  Love to have a trusted source for my entertainment!"
