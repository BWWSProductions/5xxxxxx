Before deciding to take an indefinite break, the group recorded three new songs they played live but never recorded and added those to nine songs taped at their farewell shows to create "I Before E". The studio recordings sound different than previous efforts, reflecting the band's increased confidence and maturity. Vocals are placed front and center in the mix of lovely orchestral pop. The live tracks are delicate, beautiful, and haunting.
