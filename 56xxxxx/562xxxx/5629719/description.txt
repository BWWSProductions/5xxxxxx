Release Notes: 
well, i know its a bit late, but what the heck...filtered all the colours, slightly tweaked the hue, tweaked the contrast, 
added a sharpness filter, denoise filter...and some other stuff... used the imagine cam audio, as it had the last 2minutes 
on the end, and they had synced to the cam, we had to fix a few sync issues, got most i think...filtered audio again, its still 
very tinny but not much can do about it..only 1hour 22minutes runtime so only chose 709MB..anyway take it or leave it Enjoy
