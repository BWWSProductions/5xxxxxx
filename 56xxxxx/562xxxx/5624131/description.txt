Taped in the year 2003 of R&b artist and former lover of Kim Kardashian, Ray J.
The tape came out from a company called Vivid Entertainment(vivid.com) witch is known for releasing celebrity sex tapes. It's still unknown about who brought the company the tape but both Kim and Ray J to trust each other in that case.

Who doesn't want to see Kim Kardashian motherf***ing naked!? Well here's a copy of that tape.
