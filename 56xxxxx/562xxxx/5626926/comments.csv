PLS SEED"
,lilchick,2010-06-14T15:07Z,still a ntsc??
,lilchick,2010-06-14T18:28Z,"can i play this one on a chipped (wiikey 2 1.3 with 4.3-ish on the machine) pal wii???

anybody that tried?"
,JJ-KwiK,2010-06-14T22:26Z,"It's still NTSC, but works grat when forcing the region. 
Also, 95% of the glitches have been fixed.

I've got a friend that's tried it on a wiikey system, not sure what version, but he said it worked."
,lilchick,2010-06-14T23:04Z,"JJ-KwiK , if you force the region to pal a wiikey2-chipped wii refuse to play it, unless you got a wii-bios like 1.8 or something like that but then you cant play all the new games...

so it wont probably run on a palwii with a wikey2 then...."
,lilchick,2010-06-14T23:16Z,and if you google this game (which i did) some people say it fucked up their wiimenus after they played it anyway so....
,JJ-KwiK,2010-06-14T23:28Z,"^Well, that guys an idiot!^

This game won't mess anything up. trust me!"
,JJ-KwiK,2010-06-14T23:37Z,"WoW, Brain fart!

I didn't read the names and thought you were different people. 
I assumed you were on a softmodded wii, that's why I said to force the region. And since I tought the wiikey q was separate, I assumed you had a ntsc system.

This game is completely fine and will not mess up your sys menu. There is nothing to worry about.

As for the ntsc game on your pal wii. If it's that big of an issue, google regionfrii, and change the region of the game.

Hope this helps"
,lilchick,2010-06-15T00:06Z,"JJ-KwiK, the only weirdo here is you and you aint got a clue about wii...

if you got a chipped palwii (like wiikey or similiar) and got the wiimenu over 2.3 (or something like that) you cant play a ntsc och jap-games because as soon as you put regionfrii and/or brickblock it you wii-console says that there is an error on the disc and/or that it cant be played on your region....'

therefore i wondered if this was a regionfree game in the core so to speak and would work on any chipped wii....

stop screaming if you dont know what to scream over, your just makeing an ass of yourself ....."
