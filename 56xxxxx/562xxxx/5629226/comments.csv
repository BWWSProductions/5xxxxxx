,aarque,2010-06-15T13:38Z,"Look at you DC, with your fancy description and all. You're not going to go all KOMU on us now, are you?
That kid decided he was so badass (he kind of was, like you are) that he was going to start a membership site and only give his warez to those that paid. Then he put little threats or warnings in them to try to prevent the inevitable share..."

,Jimstalk,2010-06-15T14:16Z,THE AP DOESNT WORK.......

Jim, the autopilot requires FSUIPC, but only FSUIPC 4.3 is working for me."

,DCrack,2010-06-16T05:53Z,"Thanks everybody! Like I said before, appreciation comments are always well received, I don't have the time to respond to each one but they really do make a difference, always keep that in mind.
I just wanted to say that I'm not planning to go anywhere, I love and will always love to crack and you guys have been amazing, so I plan to stay here for a while ;)
I'll let you all know through twitter when I have time to work on my next crack, meanwhile you can try to find me the installer of the SibWings - Cessna O-1/L-19 Bird Dog, which is now number one on the request list :)
Cheers!"

,woodleeg,2010-06-16T16:49Z,"Hello!

Thank you for a nice upload...always good stuff from you...

...if you have problem with the autopilot to work properly it can be that you have to reinstall FSUIPC, and try an older version, like fsuipc 4.3 witch i did, and everything works OK for me now.

Have a nice summer, and take it easy with the beer.

Christer"
,olol1234,2010-06-16T21:42Z,"DXFMJ, if you have any installer, pls post the CS 767-200. If you can post a rip, even better. Thanks"
,glasswings21,2010-06-17T14:18Z,i am using the fsuipc cracked by you recently but no help with the autopilot at all....should i try to install any older versions like 4.3 or something because i can't get a way through the autopilot as it doesn't work at all....! ....

I downloaded this yesterday and followed the install instructions but when I load it in FSX I can't see any of the gauges, controls, pretty much the entire cockpit is white

Anyone know whats up with my frames during 767 flight?"
,Cruzu,2010-12-21T14:30Z,"Thanks man, it works perfectly! Merry Christmas!"
,razzledazzlez,2011-01-11T11:57Z,"This torrent installs a rootkit via the install.exe file, not the crack. Since DCrack provided the crack and presumably got the install.exe file somewhere else, he may not know anything about the rootkit. On a WIN 7 64 OS, the MBR rewrite will fail, but the MBR will become corrupt, which will destroy the partition and render the OS unbootable. A simple MBR rewrite for Win 7 (insert OS install disk, choose Repair) will fix it. XP and VISTA users need an MBR repair tool to fix theirs (use Hiren) unless the infected MBR is made inaccessible. There is only one way to hack an MBR on Win 7 64 and it's not well known, which is why this hack failed. But it still did its damage."
,razzledazzlez,2011-01-11T12:41Z,"More on MBR hack. Insallation of the rootkit on anything other than Win 7 64, will succeed and you may never known you've been hacked. You should be able to remove the rootkit by simply repairing the MBR. Use this free one at http://www.sysint.no/products/Download/tabid/536/language/en-US/Default.aspx. Hope this helps."
