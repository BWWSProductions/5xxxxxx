In the first half of the show, screenwriter and producer David Black discussed the negative effects of electrical and technological pollution, which he explores in his new novel, The Extinction Event. "3% of the population is going to die or get seriously ill' from electrical pollution, he declared. While 50% of the population is sensitive to this kind of hidden pollution that you can't taste or touch, and might exhibit such problems such as exhaustion, aches, palpitations, back pain, schizophrenia, and immune system disorders, he continued.


"Everyone's body is made up of electrical fields and all around us are electrical grids which are getting more and more powerful" such as from the increasing number of cell phone towers, he noted. Further, stray voltage or the leaking of electricity is actually killing animals, he added. Black also talked about his TV career working on such shows as Law and Order, and a short-lived TV series PBS Hollywood Presents that featured a live production. Richard Dreyfuss, who starred in one of the teleplays that Black wrote for the PBS series, phoned in to reminisce.

In the latter half, seer Dr. Louis Turi shared some of his predictions and astrological forecasts, and talked about his recovery from cancer. He warned that the following dates (or within 48 hours of them) could bring especially troubling events: 

â€¢June 29, 2010-- possibility of explosion/volcano/earthquake up to 6.5.
â€¢July 10 + July 26, 2010-- thousands may have to relocate due to something like a tsunami or hurricane.
â€¢August 25, 2010-- "Nothing less than shocking" will occur at this time, a natural disaster as big as the Asian tsunami. This date has been confirmed by his ET contacts.
These negative events are part of the astrological 'tail of the dragon' cycle, which will reach its end in March 2011, he said. Dr. Turi has made his e-book, Moon Power Starguide 2010, available as a free download.
