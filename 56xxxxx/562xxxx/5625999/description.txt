The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 13 June 2010


[sebaygo1]



A live show today!

The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.


[description from Infowars web site:]
On this Sunday Edition, Alex talks with physician and Republican Congressman for the 14th congressional district of Texas, Ron Paul. Dr. Paul is the founder of Campaign for Liberty and author of End The Fed and The Revolution: A Manifesto. Additional guests include international bestselling author Jeffrey M. Smith who is the leading spokesperson on the health dangers of GMO foods, Evening Standard and The Guardian  journalist Charlie Skelton, journalist for the American Free Press and Bilderberg hound Jim Tucker, and longtime newsman working as the deputy editor the American Free Press, Mark Anderson.
[most, perhaps all, of the guests are not live, but rather excerpts from previous broadcast interviews]

IMHO, as anti-GMO-Foods activists go, Jeffrey Smith is one of the most effective spokespeople.  I enjoy any chance to hear him being interviewed.  I am including as a bonus with this torrent an interview from May 25th's Jeff Rense Show.  All the original capture and editing work credit for this goes to "gkjrrs" of Demonoid and Fenopy.  I merely supplied mp3 tags.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
