,AuRteam,2010-06-13T03:38Z,"Decent TS, very watchable. The video was tinted blue at parts but it wasn't all that noticeable, besides that the response time was slow at very high-speed action scenes, resulting in some choppy parts of frames. Other than that the video was good, it wasn't blurred, the color was great so it was pretty good quality. The audio was very clear, not hollow or washed out, definitely line audio. It was quiet a couple of times when it should have been louder but it wasn't action scenes so that was good. Overall decent TS, loved the movie, basically another great upload from raymondhome.

,djdlux2005,2010-06-16T06:31Z,"Thanks raymondhome for all your uploads!  I find that almost all of your movies are 10/10 except for the brand new cams of which yours are still good for sure.  Nothing is ever fake and nothing is ever crap quality!  I've learned that if you are the upload-er, then I don't even have to read the comments!

I'm new at this and have a nice sized blue-ray and DVD collection.  how do I contribute so I'm not leaching all the time?  I've never ripped a DVD or Blue Ray before as I finally upgraded to a computer with a DVD drive....any help would be much appreciated and I will upload some awesome movies and new releases....any help would be much obliged!  I assume you can send me a message telling me how to rip and upload movies.  I will swear the oath to only contribute the best of my abilities provided someone guides me as to how to do so.

Again, thanks for all your uploads......every one I've downloaded has been great, and as a 100% disabled combat veteran with PTSD, Panic Disorder, Nerve damage, Agoraphobia, and Degenerative disc disease living on disability, you have helped make my quality of life a bit better.....

THANK YOU!!!

By the way......is there any way to get some English subs for the beginning of the movie where they are talking in Spanish? At first I thought the whole movie was going to be Spanish with Russian subs, but good cam rip

,brave82,2010-06-30T03:19Z,"they should have filmed the A- Team in a similar fashion to Black Dynamite imo. It would have given it a more authentic feel instead of the over CG crap they're pumping out nowadays with this film as a prime example. I think they're fucking up BIG TIME by trying too many new school filming techniques with big actors when involving old school tv shows to films. I believe they disrespected the original series by doing so just to make a couple extra bucks. If they would have kept it more like the original, they more than likely would have done better in the box office. "
