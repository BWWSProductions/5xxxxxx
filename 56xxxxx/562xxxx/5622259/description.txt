IMAGiNE NOTES
Right first off thanks to the sources on this... We used the video from relizlab and some NICE LINE AUDIO<<< LoL from TA... Thanks Both :)
Right, we took the russian video and did our normal things to it. 
We fixed the AR then we adjusted the colors and removed a lot of the blue tint along with some bright spots, along with lowering the contrast and saturation. Also ran a smother and sharpening filter over it.
Not to bad of a TS imo...

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
