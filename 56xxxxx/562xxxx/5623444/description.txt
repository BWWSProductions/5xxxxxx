The production of LÃ©o DÃ©libes' fairy tale ballet Coppelia was danced by the highly sophisticated 
L'Ã‰cole de Danse de L'OpÃ©ra National de Paris, the Ballet School of one of the best companies in the world. 
The story of the doll-girl Swanilda and her sweetheart Franz is a comic, 
sentimental and family-friendly ballet that can truly be regarded as the last ballet of the Romantic era.
