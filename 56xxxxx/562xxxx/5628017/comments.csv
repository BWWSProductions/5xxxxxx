,David1125,2010-06-19T17:43Z,"As soon as that little girl looks at me, the game crashes.  On my High end 3.06 GHz iMac.  But it works perfect on my bootcamp vista.  Download took like 8 hours, for 15 GB thats pretty good, no that was awesome."
,ichimoku,2010-06-19T23:17Z,"guys i have a simple yet effective cure for crashes . If ur running on max settings , just put everthing to medium , and it wont crash anymore ! "

,DankoB,2010-07-02T01:16Z,"Interesting...you should really give credit where credit is due because this looks an awful like my port. The original was uploaded at Demonoid for the porting team community.

At least your not stupid enough to actually take credit for it in the post."
,0x13,2010-07-17T00:55Z,This game runs on windows 7 ????
,Eliott_75005,2010-07-27T11:16Z,"Hey, i have the same problem as elladan666, when i start the game, the icon pops and vanishes. If you know how to fix it let me know ;-)"
,sc0ttey,2010-08-11T15:43Z,"@Elliot i had the same problem with the icon appearing then vanishing when trying to start the game, what i did was, i trashed the current fear 2 from my applications and copy pasted (again) the fear 2 app from the mounted drive (which took me 10 mins overall)

check if that will work for you.

i have no explanation on how it worked on mine, those are just the steps on what i did to make it work :)

works perfect on my mac book pro !"

,joaolonas,2011-12-20T12:36Z,"Hello hello! Thanks for this massive torrent! But like many others I face with some crashing problems right in the beginning. I mean right at the first click! How come one can change the settings when the icon appears once on the doc and crashes immediatly?  And when i Install the CXZ Aquamarine Engine where will it go? Should I assume that things should be all right then?
The thing is that it isnĂÂ´t. 
And i do have a similar problem with ACbrotherhood. 
Also I'm on lion , 4ram 2,4gh.
So dear santa please help me with this torrent i Do want to spend some quality time with Alma.
Thanks"
