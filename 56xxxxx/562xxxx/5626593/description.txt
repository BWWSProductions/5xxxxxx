Need for Speed: Underground - arcade racing simulator released by Electronic Arts in 2003. The game was created in the wake of rise of the popularity of street racing, thanks to movie Fast & Furious. Underground revived series Need for Speed, adding a career mode and the possibility of tuning the car. All races take place within the city at night. Instead of expensive exotic cars in the Underground player must go on the usual mass-produced cars. Underground became a very successful project and spawned a sequel to the light.
