 PLOT:A self-described "poet of pain," Paul Attanasio has forged a highly respected career
 as a master of challenging film adaptations. His nuanced and gripping screenplays for Quiz
 Show and Donnie Brasco earned him Oscar nominations, and he brought sexy, character-driven
 life to the Michael Crichton page-turner, Disclosure. The Bronx-born writer created the
 acclaimed Peabody Award-winning television show Homicide: Life on the Street, and he serves as
 executive producer of the popular medical drama, House, M.D. Also a frequently hired script
 doctor, Attanasio most recently adapted the post-World War II novel The Good German for
 director Steven Soderbergh. In this intense dialogue, Attanasio describes how he went from
 lambasting movies as a "snotty" Washington Post film critic to developing explosive and
 rewarding creative partnerships with Oscar-winning directors Robert Redford, Barry Levinson,
 and Soderbergh.
