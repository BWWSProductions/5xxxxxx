The 3-4-5 piece tablebases which I already have use the naming format piecesNBW.emd with only one period, which works fine with my Fritz and Shredder GUI's. Some I've seen use two periods pieces.NBW.emd which some other software may require. Which naming format do you provide?

It seems that there are 16 permutations of three pieces without pawns: qqq qqr qqb qqn qrr qrb qrn qbb qbn qnn rrr rrb rrn rbb rbn rnn. That means there are 16x4=64 possible 4+2 Pawnless EGTB's, but you only provide 42 according to the title of this torrent. Which ones exactly? 

Or is something wrong with my math?"
