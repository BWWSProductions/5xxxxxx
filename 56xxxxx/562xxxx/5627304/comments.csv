to mux & demux the dub files & subs.
###################################
All subs show the right characters (saved under the right Unicode ISO).
In the future if you find subs not showing the right characters do the following:
If the subs are muxed in mkv download & use MKVextractGUI to extract(demux) thesubtitles from mkv, and mkvmerge GUI to mux back the edited/repaired sub in the mkv.
Download ""Notepad++"" (free): http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/ The sub you demuxed from mkv: Open and save as...ANSI !(Important!)
Right click on the sub/Open with nppIExplorerShell.exe (Notepad++ exe)/click Encoding(upper part menu)/Character sets and chose the language ISO.
Click again on Encoding/then click on Convert to UTF-8 or Unicode Big
Indian/save as...srt. You're done with the encoding, now you can mux it back in the mkv with mkvmergeGUI, select the language & mux.

Those with Win 7 64 bit seem to have issues with playing back secondary or external audio tracks & subs etc.
If k-lite pack(too complicated) is not working download CCCP ( http://www.cccp-project.net/ ) using the same player MPC).
When installing leave all as it is (default). When finished open the player, click View/Options/PlaybackOutput/check Evr Costum Pres & chose System Default under DirectShow Audio.
Under Internal Filters - Source Filters should be checked DirectShow Media, Matroska & MP4 and Transform Filters should have H264/AVC(DXVA) checked.
Now I can even play Blue-ray m2ts being able to switch between Audio tracks by clicking on the Haali Media Spliter on the task bar bottom right.

The sample is very small in size to encourage you to dl/test if your system can play it. Cheers."
