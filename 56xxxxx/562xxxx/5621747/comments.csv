,Tamarind777,2010-06-12T07:38Z,"Evolutionists always do this. They simply close their eyes to facts and true science and continue to hang onto their religion. I have no problem with the religion of evolution, but quit calling it science, because it has nothing at all to do with science."

,Batmud,2010-06-12T22:34Z,"Tamarind777: Talk about simple minded!  Do you think for your self or just regurgitate what the media and teachers feed you?  Have you done any research on this topic or just rambling on to make yourself look/feel more superior?  Allow us to look at the facts:

Science: systematized knowledge derived from observation, study, and experimentation carried on in order to determine the nature or principles of what is being studied.  (webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary, 2nd Edition, 1977)

Now that we have a foundation of what science is, let us take a look at religion.

Religion: any specific system of belief, worship, conduct. (webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary, 2nd Edition, 1977) 

Alright, speeding things up.  We both could agree that the typical 'seeing is believing' statement doesn't fit for regilious people, yes?  There is also Micro and Macro Evolution.  Micro-evolution is the alteration of a specific trait due to natural response. In layman's terms, a species will make minor changes to adapt to its environment.  Macro-evolution is used to refer to any evolutionary change at or above the level of species. It means at least the splitting of a species into two or the change of a species over time into another. Another way to state the difference is that macro-evolution is between-species evolution and micro-evolution is within-species evolution.  Mirco-evolution is proven and can be observed in nature.  Marco-evolution is a theory that has never been observed. As Webster states, science is knowledge derived from observation, study, and experimentation.  Therefore, Macro-evolution sounds more like religion than science.  
In a letter to Asa Gray, Darwin confided: ""...I am quite conscious that my speculations run quite beyond the bounds of true science."" (http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2109)


Don?t mistake micro-evolution for Darwinian evolution. They are not related. When a Creationist says they do not believe in evolution, it is not a reference to changes in specific traits. It is a reference to changes that require crossing the DNA limitations. When the facts stare evolutionists in the face, they are reduced to either insulting those who present the evidence or they must admit their world view doesn?t hold water. Evolutionists always call Christians and creationists non-thinkers because we question their illogical theories. Critical analysis is not un-intellectual, but it is unreasonable to refuse to honestly look at the whole picture painted when all the facts are presented. When someone builds their belief system around a godless world view, it leaves the realm of science and becomes a religious defense. Anyone who gets angry at the facts is not defending science, but is defending their hope that a divine power does not exist and their hope that there is no divine power in which we are accountable.

,Vitamin-C,2010-06-12T22:39Z,@Tamarind777: isn't that what creationists do?
,dsafjaly69,2010-06-12T23:41Z,"Truth be told, the only ignorant position to take in this debate is one or the other. Either there is a divine creator or there is not, both positions require defence and therefor close off the doors of objectivity. No one can prove either defence so why take an indefencible position?"
,dsafjaly69,2010-06-12T23:47Z,"As for micro vs macro evolution, we can observe evolution in the works all around us. On the micro level it is very visible. Simple viri for example. On the macro level we can also observe evolution through the fossile record. The simple reason that we cannot see macro-evolution first hand is due to the immense time frames required. "
,Razil98,2010-07-08T08:07Z,"The Earths only 6000 years old :0 This crap is just as bad as those Taliban bastards manipulating the Muslim religion. Religion came around to give us meaning to our existence.  but later became institutionalized and there leaders become power hungry. and pervert and manipulate it to there every whim aka Hitler, Osama  the mid evil catholic church. THIS CRAP!! for instance is Christan Propaganda. Religion is not fact for the most part its a collection of story's . But for 100s of years its been causing  nothing but trouble.as the once Wise George Carlin stated http://www.rense.com/general69/obj.htm
Now i'm Not trying to hate on anybody's religion Belive What you want I just ask you to take A long hard look at the institutions and the leaders of them and ask your self whats in it for them :p  "
,Animal1000000,2010-08-29T22:46Z,"Anyone who thinks that there is a conflict between religion and science, is mistaken. God created everything, but when he/she/they did so, they also created the rules that everything follow. One of our responsibilities is to learn as much as possible about how the world really works.

,jdlance,2011-05-19T19:48Z,"Why do you guys hold such animosity towards anyone who holds a different view from yours.  I thought liberal minded folks were open minded and inclusive.  Your intense reaction sounds like fear that it might be true.

This God who made all this stuff is not your enemy - even though you hate even the thought of him with intensity.  ""We love because he first loved us.""  He has no agenda to harm you.  

I used be afraid to admit that God existed because I thought if he did, I couldn't do whatever I wanted.  Turns out, he does exist and oddly enough, he wants me to be happy.  (that's not to say that means he's ok with it if I decided to put puppies in a blender for fun.)

Anyway, if you're hell bent on your firm decision to REFUSE to acknowledge that there is any possible different view from the liberal drivel that's poured out in public schools, go ahead, but I am rather impressed with your intense fear that what you've been fed could be wrong.

I hope you will consider the possibility that there could be another view that is correct and I hope that we will exist together in Eternity.

cheers
