Two years ago Cassie Ventura posed nude for Allure magazine. And now nude photos of her have been leaked last week for all to see. Apparently some smart ass hacked her computer and leaked the Cassie's photos. We have had our share of scandals in the past: from Vanessa Hudgens to Vanessa Minnillo. Meanwhile, Cassie has acknowledged that these photos are of her both in her twitter account and her official fan website:

From Cassie's Twitter about her leaked naked photos:

The recent personal pictures that have been leaked on the internet of me were hacked and stolen out of my computer. These photos were obviously never intended for the world to see and itâ€™s sad that people would really take time to steal and post them, itâ€™s just evil. At the end of the day breasts are breasts, mine werenâ€™t the first youâ€™ve seen and they wonâ€™t be the lastâ€¦ people need to grow up, letâ€™s move on. Thank you.

And from her Twitter:

It seems that someone has hacked into my computerâ€¦ thatâ€™s really foul and evil. Now stop acting like you havenâ€™t seen a titty before. 

Cassie had a hit song a few years called "Me & U". She released a single a few weeks ago but it didn't do too well in the R&B charts. Some conspiracy theorists are wondering if this "leak" was a planned publicity move.
