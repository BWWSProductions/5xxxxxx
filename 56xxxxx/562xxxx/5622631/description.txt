This is a textbook used in many Intermediate Algebra classes.

I couldn't find this in PDF anywhere for my class so I bit the bullet, bought the book (along with the online access, together over $170 new!) and painstakingly converted the online book to PDF (which required making a macro to print each page to PDF, piecing it all together, and added all the relevant chapter marks and made the table of contents clickable).

I really hope all my efforts become a huge cost-saver for the college community.  By not spending the ridiculous prices on these books maybe we can start actually focusing on school and making the world a better place.



PLEASE SEED, this book will be valuable to many students!
