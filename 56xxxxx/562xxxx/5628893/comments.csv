,User897,2010-06-15T10:54Z,"Well I've watched the film and had to come back.  Many thanks to agentpiratebay for uploading this.

It was a major struggle to get all the way through this movie.  Was it because of the subject matter?  No.  Was it because of the intense emotions experienced when having a look into history, especially because my Dad was there?  No.  The plain and simple truth is because this film was an absolute piece of shit.  I tried to give this travesty a little elbow room, but I just couldn't in the end.  It is inaccurate, the ""actors"" are terrible, and there was nothing believable about what the lens was capturing.  I sure hope that someday 94th gets a movie, or two, or TEN, that are worthy of being seen.  My Dad passed away in 2008, so luckily he never saw this complete and utter failure.

I downloaded two copies of this film at the same time while I was sleeping, so this comment will appear on both pages.

Thanks again to the uploader.  If I paid for this, I woulda really been pissed."

,JPolywog,2010-08-11T11:37Z,A 10/V10  Movie 2/10. You will need strong coffee to stay awake during this. Movie starts out promisingly enough but then deteriorates. Acting wooden and look out for snowfall special effects. Band of Brothers it aint.
