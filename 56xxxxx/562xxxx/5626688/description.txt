After years of development, SereneScreen Marine Aquarium 3 is finally available for download and purchase! This is a Beta-Test version, but your MA3 Key Code will not expire, and entitles you to download all updates through the final version. MA3 is not just an update to previous versions - the entire program has been re-written from the ground up as a full 3D environment, taking advantage of the increased capabilities of modern video cards.

What's in the program:

    * An incredible new high-definition 3D tank, bringing a whole new definition to 3D aquarium simulations.
    * No more 8-fish limit. The larger tank can handle up to 30 fish at once!
    * Multi-monitor support. Spread your aquarium across two or even three screens!
    * Music play-list. Choose your own MP3 or other music files to play in the background as you watch the Aquarium!
    * Six moving Background Objects
    * Clock/Calendar. Keep track of the time and date while enjoying the fish.
    * Custom Logo support. Add your custom logo to the crystal in the tank!
