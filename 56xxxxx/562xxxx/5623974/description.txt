           In Freedom Park, a squatter settlement near the platinum       
           mines in SA, a network of former sex workers create            
           Tapologo. They learn to be Home Based Carers for their         
           community, transforming degradation into solidarity and        
           squalor into hope. Catholic Bishop Kevin Dowling               
           participates in Tapologo and raises doubts on the              
           official doctrine of the Catholic Church regarding AIDS        
           and sexuality in the African context.
