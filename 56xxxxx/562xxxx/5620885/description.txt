The bands final release with Factory Records like â€œtempleâ€ went relatively unnoticed on release (reviews from the time are hard to find).  Tracks can still be heard occasionally in clubs (typically pneumatic percussion as a bridge between other tracks or the chant from sex goddess as a break in a modern tune).

The run out groove for side 1 reads â€œDonâ€™t buy it, Steal itâ€, what other excuse do you need?
