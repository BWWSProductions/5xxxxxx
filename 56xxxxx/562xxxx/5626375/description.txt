Book Description
================
Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl is among the most influential 
works of psychiatric literature since Freud.

The book begins with a lengthy, austere, and deeply moving personal essay about Frankl's imprisonment in Auschwitz and other concentration camps for five years, and his struggle during this time to find reasons to live. 

The second part of the book, called "Logotherapy in a Nutshell," describes the psychotherapeutic method that Frankl pioneered as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps. Freud believed that sexual instincts and urges were the driving force of humanity's life; Frankl, by contrast, believes that man's deepest 
desire is to search for meaning and purpose. Frankl's logotherapy, therefore, 
is much more compatible with Western religions than Freudian psychotherapy.
 
This is a fascinating, sophisticated, and very human book. At times, 
Frankl's personal and professional discourses merge into a style of 
tremendous power. "Our generation is realistic, for we have come to 
know man as he really is," Frankl writes. "After all, man is that being 
who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that 
being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer 
or the Shema Yisrael on his lips."
