took me a little while to figure it all out.

just to clarify - do i need to re-activate every 180 days? or is it good to go from here on out?
(i translated the .txt file to english and thats what i read from it)

again, thanks :)"

,jaffarai,2011-01-25T21:00Z,"Would some kind soul please list a step by step guide to using this software.  I downloaded the MS Office Professional Trial version from the MS website (perhaps my first error) and when it came to activate the software I had no clue how to proceed.  I found the instructions that came with this torrent somewhat confusing (perhaps it is just my computer literacy).  In summary, a step-by-step guide would be much appreciated, including where to go for the actual MS Office program.  Thanks a lot!"
,enterprise1980,2011-02-10T10:42Z,"Thanks man, works just fine!"
,Steerage,2011-02-11T20:14Z,"To any of you skeptics out there, this is 100% brilliant.
No bugs no scams, works so easily I was shocked.
DeGun is a hero. Show respect."
,LordOrwell,2011-03-05T05:30Z,outlook express doesn't even come with office.  It comes with outlook.
,Tyche26,2011-03-08T07:56Z,Remove office 2010 key I get error. not existing. Then you have to use KMS to rearm which gives you 30 days. 
,Admiral_Xyes,2011-03-16T00:46Z,"Seems to have worked like a charm.  Does this KM thing do anything else besides validate this program?  For example, will it block updates for me, or float in the background?

Well anyway, Thanks DeGun for the great torrents :D"
,chadzky,2011-03-18T09:18Z,"The rearming works but how many times will be used? 

Thanks a lot"
