This CD was an experiment by Rushad Eggleston, the former cellist for the phenomenal contemporary bluegrass band Crooked Still, and it features several of their other band members, including Aoife O'Donovan.  It retains a lot of the same sound quality, but has a very playful, slightly bizarre quality to the CD.  Very enjoyable, and highly recommended!
