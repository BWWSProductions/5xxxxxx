Ok, not sure why people keep starting torrents then pulling them, but here is the Just Flight Nighthawk everyone was looking for. It is a re-up of a torrent I got about a year ago. I already searched for it, granted the Pirate Bay search isn't as reliable as it used to be, but I couldn't find another copy, otherwise I'd credit the original seeder. Popcorn, thanks for all your effort, but I'm pretty sure you didn't share this a year ago.

Have patience leechers, my bandwidth isn't great but the file size is relatively small and I will seed (off and on) at least until there are several peer seeders.


Oh, and do try to enjoy, cheers.
