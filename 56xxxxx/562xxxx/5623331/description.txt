I apologize folks!

Blame it on a damaged disc, but I've discovered that a defect slipped in from the original upload. Tracks 017 and 018 were a bear (disc had a uniform circle scratch) and some audio got dropped from the ends of each of these two tracks, about 25 seconds in total. In context of the larger work, it's not significant, but for purity's sake, I went back to recover the missing seconds. This torrent describes corrections for all three versions from the original. Simply choose your version and copy the two files therein into your original, and it'll all play out just fine in sequence.

Below are links to torrents describing the original versions which this one is meant to correct:

120% OGG ver

Normal speed MP3 ver

Sorry for the inconvenience!
(I'm _pretty_ sure there aren't any other defects.)
