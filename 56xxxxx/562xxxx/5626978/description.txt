Grace Potter and the Nocturnals is a Vermont-based band that blends funky blues, soul and rock from the sixties and early seventies.

The lead vocalist is 26-year-old multi-instrumentalist Grace Potter who attended St. Lawrence University for two years before heading off into the world of music. She plays the Hammond B3, Fender Rhodes and Wurlitzer Electric Piano, and electric and acoustic guitars. The other members of the band include Scott Tournet, on guitars and harmonica, as well as slide guitar, and drummer, Matthew Burr. (Bryan Dondero played bass guitar and Upright bass as well as mandolin with the group until his departure in early 2009). They were since joined by bassist Catherine Popper and rhythm guitarist Benny Yurco.

The band has independently recorded and released two albums, Original Soul (2004) and Nothing But the Water (2005). 

In 2006, the band won the Jammy Award for "Best New Groove" and was nominated for two more Boston Music Awards: Album Of The Year (major) for the re-release of Nothing But the Water, and Female Vocalist Of The Year (for front woman Grace Potter). 

The band released its third album, This Is Somewhere, on August 7 2007.

In 2010, the band appeared on the soundtrack for Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland with a live cover of Jefferson Airplane's White Rabbit.

The band released their fourth studio recording, selftitled Grace Potter and the Nocturnals on June 8, 2010.
