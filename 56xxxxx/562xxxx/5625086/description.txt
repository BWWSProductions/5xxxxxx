Plot:
Derek Thompson is 'The Tooth Fairy,' a hard-charging minor league hockey player whose nickname comes from his habit of separating opposing players from their bicuspids. When Derek discourages a youngster's hopes, he's sentenced to one week's hard labor as a real tooth fairy, complete with the requisite tutu, wings and magic wand. At first, Derek "can't handle the tooth" â€“ bumbling and stumbling as he tries to furtively wing his way through strangers' homesâ€¦doing what tooth fairies do. But as Derek slowly adapts to his new position, he begins to rediscover his own forgotten dreams Written by 20th Century Fox
