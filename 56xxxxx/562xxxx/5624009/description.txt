This torrent contains music by Charles-Valentin Alkan (1813-1888). This isn't another retarded classical top 100 mozart collection, this is real repertoire.

Included are the celebrated "Etudes in all minor keys", op. 39 (containing both the Concerto and Symphony for solo piano) and the "Etudes in all major keys", op. 35.

Op. 39 performed by Jack Gibbons
Op. 35 performed by Bernard Ringeissen

Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.





**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"



If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
