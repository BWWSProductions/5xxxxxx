IMAGiNE NOTES
OK sources used relizlab video and some sweet line audio from TA ,thanks to both :)
Also a special mention to 66Butch for syncing this one ,cheers bro  ;-)
Now why a v2??? because we always do a v2 :lol:, well the real reason is because we spent all morning creating our own subpack for this....so now all non english parts have hardcoded english subs ;-)
Also we slightly changed the filtering and AR......firstly the AR, nothing wrong really with our first one but this res on this only gives you a 0.1% AR error compared to 0.9% on the other ....so no major difference really.
The filtering....well we tried to make it a touch sharper and also remove some of that yellow.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
