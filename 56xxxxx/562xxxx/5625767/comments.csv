,co30op,2010-06-14T01:50Z,"For all of us people who already have the movie with no subs, is there a link for the .srt file? Thanks in advance"
,whome1010,2010-06-14T10:39Z,many tnx
,ExhamPriory,2010-06-14T23:58Z,"Screens look AMAZING for Cam

Thx so much raymondhome. I will comment on A/V in a bit when it DL's    :D"
,ExhamPriory,2010-06-15T00:01Z,oh yea. and thanks for the subtitle work man that is awesome of you. that is always a pain in the ass when you realise you need to go look for your own subs to fill in the foreign language pieces. GOOD WORK DUDE
,fhffan,2010-06-15T05:14Z,"raymondhome, did you create the hard-coded subs yourself, then reupload this version? If so, do you still have the subtitle file? Cause uploading just the subtitle file could save a lot of time for those of us who already downloaded your other release without the subtitles."
,ExhamPriory,2010-06-17T02:15Z,"hey sorry almost forgot to comment.

It's great for a cam ray! Thank you.
If you can't wait for a BD/DvD release, then I'd say check this one out is was REALLY EASY to watch and enjoy. It may not be rip Quality (what cam is?)     but a part way into it i totally forgot it was a cam. 

I'd say A:7 / V:7  (if I was rating a generic Upload))

and      A:9 / V:9  (for CAM ratings)"
,bychance,2010-06-17T03:36Z,"I see -10 for quality, looks like the anti-p2p agents are hard at work (losers). Great work RH.
 Thanks"
,ghaa66,2010-06-17T07:15Z,"Thank you uploader ! This is very good quality cam ! Double subs at begining of movie was a little agravating, but hey, its free ! Nice work !
Plot was actually a little better than I thought it would be. Nice action scenes too.
A-8
V-8"
