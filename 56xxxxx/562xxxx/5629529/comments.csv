Hi.
I found the CRYPTIC virus, but was abit harder than usual so I guess you take pride in shading trojans.

Also, hi Igor Minic, hi NEA pop band from mid Croatia.


I'll be seeing you soon.

My avast came up clean but that doesn't necessarily mean that there is no virus."
,SamJigga,2011-04-14T13:29Z,"Yes it does. Avast is one of the best if not the best. Less false alarms, better results."
,DragonRider65,2011-05-13T07:08Z,"You dildos, just about ALL keygens show up as a virus, does not matter what Anti-Virus system you are using! Geeeez! LOL! Great upload man, I needed this, thank you! I have several computers I do my grapics on; if this works out and I like it I will go ahead and buy it for the rest of my machines..."
,SamJigga,2011-06-28T00:42Z,"Dildo? Just so you know, Avast never showed up a virus alarm when scanning a keygen executable. Only your stupid antivirus does."
