For your convenience, I separated this from a discography torrent I found elsewhere on TPB.
It was marked there as Disc 1 of the "Teaching An Oakie To Fly" bootleg (that is, teaching Oklahoma native Steve Gaines to become a Free Bird.)

Disc 2 contains rehearsal footage as well as a pre-Skynyrd Gaines bootleg. That's likely going to be my next upload.

This is Lynyrd Skynyrd's set from their 1976 performance at Knebworth.

Artist: "Lynyrd Skynyrd"
Album: "1976.08.21 - Knebworth England"
Genre: "Southern Rock"
Date: "1976"

Brilliant stuff, plain and simple. Enjoy.
