Best Dark Game - 2G1N '09 | Banned on RPG.Net
"Produces acts of sheer gruesomeness"

Hell for Leather is the zero-prep storytelling game of explosive death and murder. There's no GM, no lengthy setup, and it plays out in under 4 hours. If it were a food, it'd be a pizza delivery...

Using a tower of dice, tell the story of contestants on the world's most dangerous gameshow. It's grim, explosive and spattered with blood.

Warning: Contains sexy gore.

Hell for Leather, the game where Murder = Extra Dice!
