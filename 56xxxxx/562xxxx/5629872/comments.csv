OnOne.FocalPoint.v2.0.1
OnOne.PhotoTools.v2.5.3.Professional
OnOne.PhotoTune.v3.0.2
are wrong, they need to be 18 digits long, so I could not install to test these out.
Also, on U.S. machines, you will not be able to install the files until you rename the main folder from ""Plug-ins ??? Adobe Photoshop CS5"" to something else effectively removing ""???"" which means ""for"" in Russian.
So rename the folder to something like ""Plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop CS5"" and suddenly all the files are fine again.
Just need a another keygen for OnOne stuff. However ""OnOne Software Mask Pro 4.1.8"" does work and works great, really useful plug in.

Does anyone know how to install ""MiaBella actions and texture for Photoshop"" I found the Action .ATN files but couldn't figure out where the textures go, and by the way I'm not sure if simply moving the .ATN files to ""\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Presets\Actions"" does the trick.

I think now in CS5, from what I've gathered, this is done differently. If anyone can help out I'd be great.

Thanks DeGun for another good one."

,100bugs,2010-06-26T22:55Z,"My Avira Antivir Personal detected TR/Dldr.exchanger.baw in keygen.exe of the imagenomic portraiture.

So i sent the file to Virus Total for analysis and the result is 18/41. 

It still could be a false positive but i am not interested in that plug-in so it will go to trash.

But if you really want that plug-in then it would be a good idea to run the keygen in the sandbox and deny it access to internet so it will not have the possibility to download a malware.

Regarding the 3 onOne plug-ins with a 15 digits serial instead of 18, it seems that 15 digits is ok to unlock the softwares if it is used properly.

Go to this address and read the 2 first comments of jfcarbel to know how to use the 15 digits and also... grab the Onone Genuine Fractals Professional v6.05 plug-in.

,100bugs,2010-06-27T17:04Z,"My Avira Antivir Personal also detected beauty.box.1.0.0.0-patch.exe and beauty.box.1.0.0.0x64-patch.exe  from DigitalAnarchy Beauty Box 1.0.

So again, i sent the files to Virus Total for analysis and the result are 27/40 and 28/41. 

They could very well be false positives but i will not use it. 
Keep in mind that this is patches (from russia) that will stay in the program. 

UNLIKE an infected keygen that can be run in a sandbox to get the serial and destructed after, there is no way to bypass the malware located inside a patch... "
,gregscottoh,2010-10-07T08:53Z,where is the serial number for toon it? can anyone help?
,stickybeak,2010-11-17T13:46Z,Please help! How do you use this plugin? It does not show on the photoshop window.
,stickybeak,2010-11-17T13:53Z,Norton 360 v4 detects the keygen has a trojan virus.
,qwertyDave,2011-03-27T22:48Z,"No malware according to my Avast (daily updated virus definitions). Whatever it was, the heuristics of Avast has siphoned out the false positive."
,sandyjadhao,2011-07-05T11:08Z,"Thanks for upload, nice one no virus clean, check with Avast Pro, 

Note: To install the plugins copy all plugins folder downloaded to the plug-ins directory where photoshop is installed, all will run with no error.

I am running plugins on Win 7 - 32 bit, running fine."

It's a false positive I believe.  I'm also not sure why I would trust a some random dude saying ""@_0 VIRUS "".   Dl'ing right now at 150 kb/s.  Thx for torrent."
