[T],ctang,2010-06-13T21:52Z,@mrluckyman: i checked your post and i dont have any of them...i have been thinking about putting up a list of movies i have but i have so many it would take forever...will look into it tho
,mrluckyman,2010-06-14T00:58Z,just make movies list on your spare time just update your list on whenever you feel like.  i made my own website i have lot of unpublished movies to do but don't have to do all same day just update site regularly so it will be complete in least 2 years.  i know it is forever but just update your list regular so that's way u can get more recently.  maybe u can just put your 1980-1999 movies collection before u do 2000-present later.  that's why i used Excel and/or Collectorz.com Movie Collector 6.4 Pro whenever i feel like but i do it daily sometime missed days.
