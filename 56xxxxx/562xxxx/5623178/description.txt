Description
The Final Fantasy IV OST was first released on June 14, 1991, by Square Co., Ltd./NTT 
Publishing Co., Ltd,, and subsequently re-released on November 26, 1994, and October 1, 2004, 
by NTT Publishing Co., Ltd.

Tragically, the CD soundtrack was edited to [squeeze] as much VGM on a single CD. The entire
soundtrack contains 44 songs which most song fades oddly loop at 1.5 times (instead of the 
standard 2 times) and is 63 Minutes. 

This Complete and Restored version contains all 52 tracks and fades loop at the standard 2 
times and is 1.6 hours and fits on 2 CDs.

Restoration Process:

None of the 44 released tracks were re-recorded. These tracks that were re-edited and 
fades looped at the standard 2 times.

Unreleased tracks were taken from the original SPC (SNES sound) files and recorded from a real SNES console.  

Special thanks to Anti Resonance for his spc2rom and SWC Util for Super WildCard DX2 http://alpha-ii.com/

SPCs were converted using SPC2ROM and then transferred directly to a Super Wildcard DX2 Copier and directly loaded in SNES memory.

No filers or NR were used, this is pure authentic SPC700 music that matches the OST! You should
not be able to tell our recordings from Square's.

I am most proud of this project because FF4 is my personal fav. game and soundtrack. It is a
shame that the OST release got screwed this way, but we managed to fix it :)
