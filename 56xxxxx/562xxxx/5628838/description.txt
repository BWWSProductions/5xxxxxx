I love MUSE, but I hate twilight. I think you agree. I was extremely disappointed in Muse to see this music video with all the clips from twilight in it- so I made my own edit of the video WITH NO TWILIGHT! THE MUSE ONLY VERSION. w00t, right? 

This is the highest quality version-- to check out the lower quality or just to watch it, check out mylink below. 

Anyway, it's not perfect and if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them. 
Download it, watch it, listen to it, share it with everyone you know, and post it everywhere so it doesn't get taken down.
