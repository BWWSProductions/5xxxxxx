I love that your pdf's are a proper size!
Do you have the 4 issues of May 2010 too, please?
Keep up the good work.
Cheers :)"

Seriously though, I try to make available what I feel will be most useful and in the best shape possible, and it's very satisfying to me that you liked my upload. 

Yes I have previous versions and no problem in uploading them, but sorry I will not be able to upload & Seed all of them at one time - so it'll be great if you can let me know which ones you need most and I'll upload that first. And then others, later. One by one."
