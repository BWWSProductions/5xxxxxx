This is just another Mini-KMS activator.  It gives you 180-day grace period.  It does not activate Retail copy, only Volume Licensing.  You need an MAK key to permanently activate Office 2010, no matter what.

I'm not lying.  Just run CMD.EXE.  At the command prompt, enter:

cscript ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs"" /dstatus

This command tells if your copy of Office 2010 is permanent or 180 days."
,zzerop,2010-06-16T07:08Z,"I activated my Office 2010 using an MAK key, and not thru some stupid fake ""activators"".  Here's the proof:

The files scan clean but after you run the activator, it installs a generic bot that downloads WIN32/Rebhip.A."

,Cryceratops,2010-06-17T19:37Z,"@zzerop

Can you explain how you did that? I'd really like to have a fully activated suite instead of the 180 day option currently available."
,dannylaqc,2010-06-18T03:21Z,"Working fine, easy install. Just download Office 2010 on microsoft website and patch it."
,Monkey187,2010-06-18T17:57Z,"What Zzerop is talking about with the MAK Keys thing is this:

Microsoft released MAK (Multiple Activation Key) Product Keys for certain Office 2010 BETA Products. It allows you to actually activate your BETA copy online until it is set to expire in October. 

However, people found out that they can use these same keys to activate Office 2010 RTM/Final online. Since there is no expiration on Office 2010 RTM/Final, it's a permanent activation.

What people don't understand, like Zzerop, is that Microsoft will not allow these MAK Keys to activate online past October. So, if he ever needs to reinstall Office 2010, he will not be able to unless he learns how to save the online activation information files for Office 2010. Even then, he can only use those activation information files on that same computer and thus he can't install Office 2010 on any other computer in the future with this method unless he already activated these other computers with MAK Keys and saved the files as well.

So, it's not a final solution unfortunately. However, if you all really want to know about MAK Keys and possibly get one, do a search on Google for ""MAK Key Office 2010"" and you might be able to find one. It's a lot better than these virus filled activators."
,zzerop,2010-06-19T02:57Z,"@Monkey187,

You are a moron.  You thought the MAK key I used to activate Office 2010 were like these MAK keys?

    * Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 Beta
      22HGX-728MX-BBWX9-7BB8X-J96B4
    * Microsoft Project Professional 2010 Beta

,zzerop,2010-06-23T09:06Z,"@softwarechecker,

I assume that you've completed the uninstall/install process.

You then must copy the ""dat"" files into the -CORRECT- folders.

You then run CMD.EXE as Administrator.

At the command prompt, you enter 2 commands:

cscript ?%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs? /inpkey:XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX

cscript ?%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs? /act


Your Office 2010 should be activated.  To check the status of activation, at the command prompt, enter

cscript ?%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs? / dstatus"

,zzerop,2010-06-28T05:05Z,"@softwarechecker,

there is a major advantage of KMS over MAk activation.  microsoft can easily blacklist MAK serial, while finding it hard to do the same to KMS.

it is correct that KMS is only for 180 days.  but if you set windows scheduler to automatically run KMS every 180 days, it is the same as permanent activation.  it runs transparently.  you won't even notice it."
