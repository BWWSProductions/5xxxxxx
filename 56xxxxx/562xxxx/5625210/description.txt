Programme 1 - Soviet Union

Former spies and intelligence analysts speak frankly about
how the Agency did in assessing the military strength, political
intentions and economic power of the Soviet Union. Includes the
astonishing and hitherto little-known story of how close the world
came to nuclear confrontation in the early 1980s partly because of
the Agency's inability to understand the extent of Soviet paranoia
and the Reagan administration's 'evil empire' rhetoric.

Programme 2 - Iran and Vietnam

Oil reserves and a common border with the Soviet Union put Iran
high on the CIA's list of priorities from the start of the Cold War.
Includes the story of how the Agency went from being the power behind
the Peacock Throne to outcast.

Also discusses the role the CIA played in US' Vietnam policy  in the
1950s, 1960s and 1970s - how the Agency's lack of enthusiasm for military
action led to it being cut out of key decisions - leading to a drift towards
internal crisis in the 1970s - and how the Agency reacted to being ignored.

Programme 3 - Present and Future [Transcript only]

How the CIA is tackling the new threat of al Qaeda and associated terrorist
networks. Ex-Agency officials - and those called back in an effort to make up
for lost time - talk about the extent of the intelligence failure and '9/11'.
