A wonderful thing about life is that it is naturally good. Life is set up to work -- to produce love, fulfillment, and happiness continuously. However, various situations during your first years of life conditioned you in the methods of consciousness which continually generate unhappiness in your life. Yet every current experience can aid you in your growth toward higher consciousness if
you know how to use it. 

This Handbook will explain how you have been creating the experiences that you have. It will show you exactly what to do to break out of the traps in your mind that are the cause of all the unhappiness that you have experienced in your life! When you apply the Methods in the Handbook you will be able to turn your life around.

Beautiful things will happen so continuously that you can no longer ascribe it to mere â€œcoincidence.â€ You will experience that you can create more love, happiness, and serenity than you need for living a thoroughly fulfilled and enjoyable life.
