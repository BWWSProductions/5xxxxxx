In properties it says it's ripped in 2(stereo) 44KHz. I picked up that Mp3 off demonoid back in 2007 so finding out who has it or who ripped it might be like finding a needle in a haystack. + It's 26 Yrs.old so the quallity is probally not the best & as far as I know that was their only release. More than likely just a demo. BTW The vocals are Bjรถrn Lodin (1988-1989) Krokus"
