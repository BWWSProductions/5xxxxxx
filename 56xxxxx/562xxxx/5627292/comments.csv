,sanatkr,2010-06-14T21:37Z,it didnt get full screen in window7 even after pressing alt+enter
,iKlark,2010-06-15T00:11Z,"I just googled it on the internet.

Windows Vista/7 does not support full-screen DOS. So thats probably why it wouldn't get full-screen on your PC. Sorry.

Windows 2000/XP users just press alt+tab to play full-screen."
,iKlark,2010-06-15T11:08Z,^ I meant alt+ent
,iKlark,2010-06-17T19:53Z,^ I guess than the full-screen problem is just with Windows 7.
,iKlark,2010-06-17T20:09Z,"^^ Whenever it gets stuck, simply press esc & then rapidly press enter 3-4 times until it proceeds.

And the problem is not with the game, these games are made for DOS, In my opinion its good enough that we can even play them on modern operating systems."
,altrego99,2010-06-18T14:11Z,This works. Just update your DOSBOX if you want fullscreen in Windows 7 x64.
