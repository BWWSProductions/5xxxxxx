I'm looking to replace just the revised AC3 track in your original encode but do not see a torrent just for that. You mention we can do that to save bandwidth instead of downloading the entire film again. BTW, nice up today, thanks."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-12T18:18Z,"i deleted it after a few weeks, seemed like people were downloading it not knowing what it was."
,Cespur,2010-06-13T12:10Z,"Pfff, I'd love to download this but 22GB is asking too much of my hard drive, haha. Thanks anyway!"
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-14T00:17Z,hard drives are cheap.
,Cespur,2010-06-15T17:16Z,"Yeah, but I put all the movies into itunes and I'd like to keep my iTunes Library on my MacBook Pro's HD, instead of a external one (I do got a wireless Time Capsule 1TB Hard Drive though)."
[V],Team_xRG,2010-06-15T17:59Z,"thnx 
going to take some downloading :P "
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-16T19:37Z,"I would buy like a 1.5tb external drive off newegg, they are like $129.  That way you can archive stuff off your macbook pro's HD.  I don't own a time capsule."
,achshar,2010-06-16T22:35Z,"oh man! holly mother... i saw this torrent only after wasting about 20 gigs on that framestor torrent..
GRRRRR...
and the worst part, those movies dont work as my graphic card cannot take the load.. 

this was perfect for me as i have 64kb down speed..
i feel like banging my head in the wall.. i must have been done with till now if you would have up it earlier.. but hey thanks alot:)))))) you saved my rest of 40gb of waste download.. :))
thanks a ton.. you rock"
,achshar,2010-06-16T22:38Z,"only thing i would like to know is if it would give me the download speed or not coz that was a beautifull torrent with speed reaching upto my full capacity.. i really dont want some looooooong waiting time or this one..

coz i am so desperate for this .. :) :P :D"
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-17T07:54Z,"not sure about download speed.  use a good client like utorrent, make sure you are connecting to a lot of peers, have patience."
,achshar,2010-06-17T16:10Z,"hmm u know what.. it actually gives me great speed full 64  thanks alot.. btw i use utorrent already and  connected to about 200 of 500 peers at any time of day.. 

thaks a lot.. for the upload and the reply.. you are a life (and bandwidth) saver :P :D
and that lord of rings torrent thats another great up thanks for that either.."

,LabRatDiseased,2010-11-18T02:32Z,"Will I get sued if I download this torrent? Because I've received a message last time I downloaded Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. I'm guessing because I was a new release, but still I want to make sure. Pleasee somebody tell me"

,Rustywang,2010-12-29T23:07Z,"Someone, please seed this. I can see there is at least 6 of you who have fully downloaded this torrent. None of which are seeding. I'm at 33% downloading at 4kbps and uploading at 300. this is ridiculous. "
,ultimagic,2011-01-02T16:18Z,a lot of fucking leechers here! i got the secretmyth version of this but i think this one is better but it's really slow because of fucking leechers who remove their torrent after downloading.

Please seed well guys
I will seed it upto 200% atleast"
,fazhussain,2011-04-24T00:55Z,"Does anyone know if sound works? I've downloaded a bit and previewed parts of what i've downloaded, no the whole movie, but i can't hear the sound. Before i finish downloading i just want to know if the sound if all working fine"
,firebreather92,2011-05-13T12:46Z,"hey guys, got a question about uTorrent. under seeds and peers are two numbers, the second in brackets. i know that the first number is the amout of seeds i'm connected to and the second is the amout of seeds overall in the swarm. so here's the question: why can't i connect to more seeds in the swarm? for some reason, i can upload with max-speed but not download, though there should be enough seeds in the swarm... help appreciated ;-)"
[V],jainmehul,2011-06-20T16:37Z,the subtitles don't show up on itunes??....
