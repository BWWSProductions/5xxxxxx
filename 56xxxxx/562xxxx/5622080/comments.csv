You wouldnt happen to have ""For Pete's Sake"" (1974), would ya???

I normally seed out my DL's for 30 days or so. Once I get this one from you, i'll let it sit and cook for a while. Connection here is 20 down and 6 up. "

and yes, i have it! But it is a vhsrip, not dvdrip. so, it is not qualified as good as this one. i ripped it so long years ago. but here is the good news, i have the original vhs tape too! :) needs to be re-encoded with new programs&scripts. 

i'll do it and up it within a few days. :)"
