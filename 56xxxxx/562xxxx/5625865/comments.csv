,Godslayer187,2010-09-19T22:02Z,It's for gamespy! read the info   :p
,MrPwnage,2010-12-04T14:44Z,Ive downloaded this torrent a few times now on different computers and its perfectly fine to play online with..... you just have to upgrade to the latest patch. Its a bit of a pain upgrading but the online is immense and there are still quiet a few people playing.... overall great torrent :P
,Lil_LeX,2010-12-10T20:20Z,"Thanks so much for the upload this is my favourite RTS game and now I found out that I can play it online thx! For the above who have problems with the game: just install it, update the game from the menu then, also from the menu, enter multyplayer and create (or log into) a gamespy account. Also if you want to have some free space you can mount the mini-image inside the folder from the big image. It has 4MB so you can delete the one that has 1GB."

,maffia255,2011-08-27T17:07Z,"Serial code is : C7VM7-YWMJV-X9T88-KQ6KP-PBWXW This would solve your Little prob!

,Godslayer187,2011-09-30T00:01Z,"Yo elf_Iorveth  your a moron, try mounting the damn image in daemon tools and installing it with the Key provided, then play the game.....real hard, thats why there is no text for installation, there is nothing you need to do besides install it!"
,volcomusa,2011-10-15T22:18Z,"@@@@@@ WARNING @@@@@@
Whether or not this torrent has viruses is debatable. My AV, Trend titanium, has picked up eight from this file.

HOWEVER!

The file works. 100%. keygen, etc... all great.

Thanks... ish?"
,HeavyMetalFudge,2011-12-30T12:59Z,"I got a trojan virus from this so its obviously not safe, best to find a different torrent."
,100rN0,2012-01-01T15:57Z,"Installation went smooth (thanks Godslayer187) but, when playing, mouse wasn't responding (cursor stayed in the middle of the screen, unable to scroll thru menus etc.)

To all facing this problem (win7x64b), solution is simple:

right click on the desktop, then goto screen resolution, click on the link ""make text and items smaller and bigger"" and set it to smaller 100%

Just as an update to the agony. :)

Kudos goes to kmacNchips who posted this solution on windows answers forum."
,RogherNahasa,2012-01-19T18:17Z,Thanks.
,WolfishReaper,2012-05-26T18:13Z,"Every time i try to patch from after clicking on gamespy internet matchmaking. It downloads then goes to a smaller window and says ""Invalid Patch Error"". Someone please Help!"
