its playing in french ! how do we get it to play in english ?"
,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-06-21T14:17Z,i clicked video in bottom left of cyberlink then audio languages box shows but theres nothing you can select...i guess anonymous is someone taking the piss..this film is in french
,exateit,2010-06-24T17:11Z,"Cyberlink DVD is a pile of crap, Use Corel WinDVD or Arcsoft Total Media Theatre 3.

It probably will come in English if you Burn the film onto bluray disc. 

I will let you know once I have downloaded it, hopefully it wont be too long on my 16mb connection"
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-07-01T15:39Z,does the vlc shows the audio and subs selections without  a proplem for this movie?
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-07-01T15:44Z,"this  is a bdmv file i download other movies like this and  and i can not find the audio and subs languages,can y upload it in another format pls"
,exateit,2010-09-06T18:23Z,"I have not burnt it onto bluray disc yet, but I just ran it through BD Rebuilder to remove the unwanted languages audio's and got the english that way.  I know once burnt on to bluray there will be no problems!"
