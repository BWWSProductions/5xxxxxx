,studentnurse_06,2010-06-16T17:00Z,"Wendy's games are always good and clean. For those of you who say there is malware, you need to get a new virus scan."
,MsMousse,2010-06-17T09:04Z,"this is the first time a Wendys game hasn't been perfect!   froze on opening ""mumbo jumbo"" screen & wouldn't shut down--had to hard re-boot. 1st time opening, got this ""unhandled exception"" error: Assertion failed in file "".\Common\Actor.cpp"", line 611: Negative timeDelta. have removed all from pc."

,omega45,2010-06-22T08:24Z,"Hi Wendy, you know every game you have, I have got and have never had any problems with any of them, except this one.   It loads to a black screen, and freezes the whole computer......so, I am wondering and hoping if you would know why this is happening>  maybe it might be my video card?  can't wait to hear from you......Thanks for all your games....I love them heaps.....you make my life very happy....:)"
,omega45,2010-06-22T08:26Z,"same thing as MsMousse, is happening to my computer as well.   Would really love to know what is causing this.......I love all your uploads Wendys99!!!  You are the very best gamer out there......:)"
,scubadog2000,2010-07-31T17:31Z,Thanx!I dont know what idiot could think that your games contain viruses!You and your games are the best!
,GAZZA7745,2010-10-07T12:47Z,"I agree, Wendy's games are usually top notch. This ones a pain in the arse though. Although it is virus free, it keeps on minimising itself to the task bar. Unplayable because of this. I see others having the same problem. I use Win7."
,GAZZA7745,2010-10-07T12:55Z,"Just got it working. You have to make sure you have no web browser running at the same time. If it won't go to full screen then start your web browser, then start the game. When game goes down to the taskbar, just close your web browser then click on the game icon on the taskbar. Voila, playable game. Thanks Wendy."

,princedj01,2011-08-28T20:16Z,"I also got a Trojan warning,but never before...Humm."
