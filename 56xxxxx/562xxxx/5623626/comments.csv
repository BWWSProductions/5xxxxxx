,Riley61707,2010-06-13T08:33Z,"Thanks a ton for this and the first essentials pack. 

Can you give me your opinion on the benfits of 5.00 m33-6 or 5.50 and vice versa from the first essentials. 

Also, any chance on uploading like a big pack of awesome homebrew apps, maybe that you arfe using etc...

Thanks babak159!"

there always patches to play games on m33.

I think m33 is the superior."
,Riley61707,2010-06-13T18:59Z,"Same here, I had been using 5.00 m33-4, til I dl'd essentials 1, and updated to 5.00 m33-6 easily, so thanks for that. 

Thanks for the quick response!"
