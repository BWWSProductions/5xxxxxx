,akuzmenok,2010-06-11T22:59Z,Could you consider uploading High School High in DVD quality?
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-12T00:38Z,No spanish subs because it never came with any other language other than English. I even checked the copy on Amazon and they don't have subtitles either. Really sorry:(
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-12T03:28Z,"@carouselboy - Yup I got it. I have a big list of movie requests to upload but I'll get to your's asap:)

@ akuzmenok - Same for you I will get your request as soon as I can:)"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-12T07:33Z,Why would someone give this a -1 rating???? 
,missmarch,2010-06-12T10:52Z,"@mikemelo1369, i saw u released  a couple of gr8 releases , but no mention of my requests, there were about 6 or 7 !!!

[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-12T17:32Z,Hey Missmarch - My requests come in on a first come first serve basis. I have over 100 movie requests. I am trying to get to everyone's Please be patient. Also a lot of your requests I do not have but I can try and find. I will do my best with all of your requests. 
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-13T00:14Z,"i stopped giving a fuck about peoples requests unless its someone like you mike.  people want want want but cant be bothered to seed.  its fucking bitches like the people who demand you to fill their requests that give shit back so FUCK THEM.  too bad for you.

thats what im saying from now on.  you dont owe anyone a single fucking thing."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-13T00:15Z,6 or 7 dvd-r requests is absolutely fucking ridiculous.  i could see if it were DVDRips or something but not 4+ GB dvd-r's hahahaha.  thats so selfish and stupid.
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-13T02:23Z,I know boss it's extremely lame.
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-13T06:02Z,"thanks for tis and could u pls get these movies as well ,monsters inc , prison break - the final break .By the way dvd9s would be more than highly appreciated and thanks once again ."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-13T07:59Z,dvd9? when people cant even seed a dvd5?  cmon lets be real.  if people cant seed 4GBs what makes you think people will seed 6-7GBs? haha.
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-13T10:01Z,"U r an asshole , not evryone have a 1megabit connection , so shut the fck up and be patience"

thanks for the movie @mike, is nice to see another trusted uploader since @djfredo has died."
,MuddyEyes,2010-06-19T19:45Z,"thanks man for this DVDR.  it's good quality. I like extras on dvd (especially audio commentaries) so I'm glad I found all the extras in your release.  Good job!. I'll try to seed as long as I can. 
And I'll keep an eye on your releases because I see you do your job right and you are serious. I'll say it again... good job! "
