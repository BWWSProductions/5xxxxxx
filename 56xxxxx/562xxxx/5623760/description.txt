Since the 2001 release of his critically acclaimed debut, Miles from the Lightning, Wisconsin native Jeffrey Foucault has built an independent career touring extensively in the United States, Canada, and the UK. His 2006 release, Ghost Repeater garnered praise from publications such as The New Yorker, No Depression, MOJO, The Chicago-Sun Times, and The Irish Times. Jeffrey's repertoire is pure Americana poetry, a mix of country blues, country, and folk music that the Boston Globe noted for its "rolling, reflective ballads [that] shimmer with blue shade, everyday images, and the quiet strength of hard-earned wisdom."
