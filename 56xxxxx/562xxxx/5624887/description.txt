"yes, itâ€™s real, and yes, itâ€™s well into production. â€œshark attackâ€ is PSURGâ€™s first PC game, completely designed by myself and squeedge (iâ€™m taking care of development + audio stuff, sheâ€™s taking care of the art and pixels, and weâ€™re both designing enemies, bosses, etc). itâ€™s a shooter that plays like a faster-paced gradius or air zonk or whatever, with hints of bullet hell shooter element"

Installer doesn't have any copy protection so should work from the off.
And remember guys, if you like it, why not buy it and support the devs?
