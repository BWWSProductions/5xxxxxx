,Philonetic,2010-06-20T04:49Z,"@the torrent. and APARTHEIDisrael
You need something positive in your life, stop complaining and do something yourself.
Movie was great, Jaden is obviously coached by his father which made the film that much more entertaining.  He's picked up many of the best parts of his fathers acting quirks.  12 years old, the kid was awesome.
Should have been called the Kung-Fu Kid, but other than that it was a great flick.  Thanks for the up."
