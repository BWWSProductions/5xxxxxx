What is RF Online?
â€¢ RF Online is a MMORPG (Massively Multi-player Online Role Playing Game) where thousands of players can connect to the game through the Internet to share in a persistent, virtual fantasy world. The style of game is Role Playing (as opposed to Â¡Â°First Person Shooter") and players can build the skills of their characters, join guilds and battle other guilds and races for control of the worldÂ¡Â¯s resources.
	What does Â¡Â°RFÂ¡Â± in the title mean?
â€¢ Â¡Â°RFÂ¡Â± stands for Â¡Â°Rising ForceÂ¡Â± so the full title of the game would be Â¡Â°Rising Force OnlineÂ¡Â±. However the game is being commonly known as Â¡Â°RF OnlineÂ¡Â± or Â¡Â°RFOÂ¡Â± for short. There is also a descriptive term for the game as Â¡Â°Fantasy and RomanceÂ¡Â± which is sometimes confused with the name. Community Liaison Manager Zzeno posted this about the name: "After spending alot of time looking into the game, playing it and talking about it with colleagues, the name RF seemed to flow naturally off the tongue and it would feel wrong calling it something else. I think it's a grower for some, and if someone does need to know what it stands for, they can easily find out that it's Rising Force."
	Who is developing RF Online:
â€¢ RF Online is already a wildly successful game in Asia having been developed by South Korean company CCR. CCR is distributing the game through Asia, in particular South Korea. Japan, China and the Philippines have separate distributors. This following thread gives much more detail:
community.codemasters.com/forum.
	Who are these Codemasters people?
â€¢ Codemasters is a UK-based company who are bringing RFO to the US and the UK. Codemasters are using their extensive game development experience to bring the hugely successful Asian game to Western markets. The game is fully developed with updates rolling out regularly. Codemasters will be fully localising the game for Western players and co-ordinate with CCR to localise updates and keep the game up to speed with the Korean version.
	How will we be able to buy the game?
â€¢ The game will be available to buy from shops, online stores and will come with the free month as standard with all MMO's. After this there will be a monthly subscription. Codemasters are also looking at alternative payment methods for people without credit cards.
	How can I play the beta?
â€¢ The UK/US betas will be announced on the Official website and forums very soon.
	Hey a forum! Can I spam?
â€¢ No. The RF Online community is already one of the best in online gaming with a fan base long experienced in the MMO genre. The forum has rules (which can be read here:
http://community.codemasters.com/forum/showthread.php?t=56669 ) and they are enforced by the moderators.
Have fun, but respect the fun of others and weÂ¡Â¯ll all have a great time. If you see a message on the forums, which is offensive, please report it and the mods will act on it as soon as they can.
	Where can I see some pictures of the game?
â€¢ You can see images of the game via downloading the screenshot pack from here:

or by visiting this link.
	What races are there in game?
â€¢ There are 3 races in RF Online battling for power.

1. Accretia: The Accretians are a race of cyborgs, they don't use magic but have powerful mechanical bodies.
2. Bellato: The Bellato make use of both science/technology and magic.
3. Cora: The Corites, also known as the race of the ancients, don't acknowledge technology, focusing on magic and nature.
	WhatÂ¡Â¯s the difference between the races?
â€¢ The Accretians have no magic class, but you can get huge siege type weapons that can give one soldier the power of a small army. This race would suit players that don't usually play magic users in games.

â€¢ The Bellato have a mix of magic skills and technological skills, and have the ability to use huge battle mechs at higher levels - these are a suitable race for people who like to try a bit of everything.

â€¢ The Corites don't believe in the use technology, instead they rely on magic. Later on in game they have the ability to summon spiritual creatures. This race suits people who enjoy playing magic classes in games.
	I've heard each race has classes...what are these classes?
â€¢ Each race has four core classes (in the case of the Accretia, there are three as they do not have a spiritualist class) to choose from.

>Warrior: A basic melee fighter who relies on strength and durability.
>Ranger: A ranged attacker who relies on speed and stealth.
>Spiritualist: A magic-user who relies on the power of magic.
>Specialist: A class that has special abilities unique to each race.
	What kind of crafting is there in game?
â€¢ If you choose the specialist skill you will open up a number of options for crafting items/weapons/armour. There are various restrictions on what you can make based on your skill rating and level, plus on the ingredients you require to make things. More information will be released by Codemasters when appropriate.
This can be a very profitable skill at higher levels.

â€¢ Upgrading: This is a separate thing to crafting which everyone will be able to perform, providing you can acquire the necessary items of course.
	Is the game set up for solo play or for groups?
â€¢ The game can be played both solo or in groups, but like in many MMOGS, you will benefit from being in a group.
It is a very good idea to make friends in game, as you never know when you'll need some help in the war!
	What is this war that I'm reading about?
â€¢ The main theme of RF Online is the war between the three races for control of the main mining area. Huge RvRvR battles are held between the three races daily.
When one race defeats the other two, they gain exclusive access to
	Can we form guilds in game?
â€¢ Groups of people from the same race can form guilds.
It opens up a whole new element to the game, with features the guild can use.

Future updates will see further improvements to the guild systems and guild interaction with the environment and game world.
