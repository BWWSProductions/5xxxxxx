NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Killers 2010

Firstly thanks to nDn for the video and audio....
Now a few things first.....yes we know the film itself is meant to be rubbish,but hell we're sure someone will
like it  
Also the video is overcropped....nothing we could do about this as we don't have the source files so...
The video itself wasn't to bad...had a chair in the bottom left,at a bad angle and also looked a bit lifeless.The audio
not too bad for a cam actually,heard alot worse anyway.
Work done,first thing we did was pulled the left corner down to remove the chair and then we levelled it up some.well as
much as we could without losing even more picture...so yes there is still a slight angle but no where near as bad.
By doing this it means we lost some of the subs thats needed,so we created a .srt file and hardcoded the subs back on
We also gave the video a once over aswell,changing contrast,sharpness,rgb colours,hue,sat,intes and also used a resize and
a smoother filter.
Audio is untouched from the nDn release.

Enjoy.
