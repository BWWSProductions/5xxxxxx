Judas Priest invented heavy metal. Don't bother arguing because I'm right. Some folks claim it was Black Sabbath, but they were never metal, just dark, heavy rock. Sabbath owed too much to the sixties to ever be truly metal, although they made a decent enough job of it with Ronnie James Dio in the band. 
Judas Priest, however, shook of the shackles of the past, and with twin lead guitars in tow, created a whole new sound, one that every single metal band of the last thirty years has aped in varying degrees. Almost as important as the music, they also invented the look. The leather boys with electric toys that leered out of every metal album cover and photoshoot right up until the present day.
And British Steel was the album that kicked it all off. They'd come close on Killing Machine (Hell Bent For Leather in the US), but with the opening track on British Steel they defined a genre. "Rapid Fire" is the song, and to this day, it's one of the most viscerally exciting metal songs of all time. Off the back of a trio of UK hit singles - "Breaking The Law", "United", and "Livin' After Midnight" - this was the record that took Judas Priest on the way to the enormodomes that were their home in the early to mid eighties. They would go on to make better albums in the shape of Screaming For Vengeance and Defenders Of The Faith, but this was the groundbreaker.
