    Out of Mind casts an entertaining eye on the work of American writer     
    H.P. Lovecraft (1890-1937), one of the early 20th century's masters      
    of gothic-horror literature. The film offers an encounter with           
    Lovecraft and enters into his world. Engaging in a kind of game          
    around the writer, the film playfully winks at some of the themes        
    characteristic of his work: the occult, cursed books, monstrous          
    creatures. Out of Mind draws its inspiration from Lovecraft's            
    personal correspondence and many of his stories, carrying the viewer     
    through a labyrinth "beyond the wall of sleep."
