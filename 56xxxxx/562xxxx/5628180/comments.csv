,pixelperu,2010-11-17T13:10Z,"Do you even know what it means ""lite""??
it doesnt include many of the unnecesary drivers or applications to can work, That is why are LITE versions. U want a system with all stuff included? download a Windows 7 32/64 bits and its ok, you get at least 3gb files to install, and no complains at all."
,remedy2,2010-11-18T00:22Z,"Hey pixelperu- did you install this version yet?  I couldn't get it to work.  Every time I tried it said ""Windows could not configure one or more of your system components""  Also what was your base?  Was it Home Premium or Pro or Ultimate?"
,remedy2,2010-11-18T00:23Z,pixelperu - sorry I thought you were the uploader.  Still I would like to know if anyone got this working.
,pixelperu,2010-12-24T16:16Z,"ok, Im goong to download it again and install it. I will comment later."

,LikUranus,2011-10-08T09:29Z,Hey Pixelprune....do you know what documentation means?  People just want to know what the fuck was taken out so that they don't waste their time downloading a lite version missing something that they want.  Twat.
,LikUranus,2011-10-08T09:35Z,"And if it seems like I'm a little pissed, it's because there's always got to be some asshole calling people stupid for wanting information.  People spend time downloading these things.  The people who upload obviously want someone to dl, or else they wouldn't be ULing.  So do us all a favor and tell us what's in it."
,tangi,2012-03-17T06:33Z,"Downloaded this. Very happy. Works well. Can't tell people exactly what's been left out. I can see Help, Sticky Notes, Snipping Tool, Windows Easy Transfer and crap like that are gone.

If you're like me, and you never ever use the software that comes with windows, you won't notice anything important missing. Networking etc work well.

It installs without requiring a serial. Daz's activator works perfectly.

One thing though, make sure you have a PS2 keyboard handy as I had to ditch my wireless one and tab through everything (no mouse either until I used my gigabyte drivers to install USB 3.0 support)."
