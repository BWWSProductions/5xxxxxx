'Hackers Wanted: Unreleased Director's Cut'


Trigger Street is a production company owned by Kevin Spacey and Dana Brunetti. In 2008 they produced a film by Director Sam Bozzo (maker of the acclaimed [i]Blue Gold: World Water Wars[/i]) entitled [i]Hackers Wanted.[/i]

Whilst Kevin Spacey was so enthusiastic about it that he even asked if he could narrate it, Dana Brunetti ridiculously called it "like watching paint dry". Due to demands made by Brunetti the release was shelved. A futile and misguided decision. Originally due to be released in 2008 it was only in May 2010 that a rough cut became available on p2p sites.

In the words of Director Sam Bozzo "I am sad that my cut was never officially released. It would be hypocritical of me to complain of this internet leak, since I openly spoke on Torrent Freak in favor of such leaks for my new film [i]Blue Gold,[/i] but on the other hand, I am sad that the leaked cut is not my Directorâ€™s Cut, but a very old cut!" "It was an absolute honor that Kevin Spacey liked the film enough to phone me to congratulate me and to allow me to direct his narration of the film." 

"Someone once said â€˜Documentaries are never finished, theyâ€™re abandoned!â€™ I cannot think of a more literal example than this!â€ As hacker Aidrian Lamo said â€œItâ€™s ironic that a film about overcoming barriers, about new technologies, about thinking differently, had to come to the public eye by being hackedâ€¦â€

Thanks to an undisclosed source Sam Bozzo's final version of the film is finally available.
