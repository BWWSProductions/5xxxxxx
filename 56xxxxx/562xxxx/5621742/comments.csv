,Zionfreak,2010-06-21T06:03Z,"I cannot figure out why this file won't play. I tried VLC, KMP, & Quicktime. Then I tried to convert it to another format and an error comes up file name invalid."

[V],mrspatula,2010-07-20T15:58Z,Cool! Thanks Bellboy! :)
,Zionfreak,2010-09-23T06:01Z,"Maybe someone can help me. I have downloaded a few new players including the GOM player and Mpcstar. I also use VLC and The Kmplayer. I downloaded this twice, I keep getting an error message that says 'invalid file extension'. I have tried renaming the file extension and no matter what I do it will not play. Is there that much of a difference between the Directors cut and the other version? "
