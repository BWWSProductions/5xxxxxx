Edit digital video and photos, including adding music and narration
Apply animation effects to videos and photos

Who this book is for

Most digital video editing applications have a steep learning curve and a thick manual. Windows Live Movie Maker is not difficult to learn, but it does not come with a manual. This book is for readers who want to quickly and easily edit their digital movies and create DVDs for viewing, but donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to sift through a lot of technical mumbo jumbo.
