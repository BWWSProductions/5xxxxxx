,TQHL,2010-06-14T19:27Z,"Thanks
Awful to be stuck at 99,8% ;)"
,rockyrakun,2010-06-15T05:00Z,Mhmm two of the pages were corrupt so it was messing up the whole process :P But its fixed now :D
,dahveed72,2010-06-15T19:05Z,"several of those comics depict clearly underage humanoid characters.  highly illegal (yes, even illustrations are verboten) in many countries including the US. i would avoid this torrent like the plague.  "
,rockyrakun,2010-06-16T05:49Z,Actually Soft Paw is a comic sold in the US. rabbitvalley.com Sells the comic. They may be underage but according to the law they are anthropomorphic creatures and not humans. So yeah it isnt illegal ^^
,rockyrakun,2010-06-16T05:50Z,Oh and Finding Avalon. go ahead and search the previously mentioned website :P
,imranaziz,2010-06-17T19:00Z,Legal or illegal most of the stuff in here is gay. IT actually depicts male caricatures engaging in sexual acts. If its not ur thing stay away.

Fuck you, you're an idiot; learn up on what you're talking about before you speak on a public site. Drawings aren't illegal in the US, and anthromorphic characters aren't human, so it's not illegal at all. Everyone has a fetish, but at least WE admit it. If you think it's so wrong, and illegal, why the fuck are YOU here, anyway?"

Actually, dahveed was partially correct.

IT IS ILLEGAL IN THE USA TO DEPICT HUMAN PREPUBESCENTS IN SEXUAL ACTS. This is clearly stated in PROTECT Act of 2003. The law enacted a new code in the U.S.C. which is Title 18, Section 1466A which criminalizes anything that: ""depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is ""obscene"" or ""depicts an image that is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in ... sexual intercourse ... and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value"".

Look up YOUR facts before commenting on a public site."
,rockyrakun,2010-08-14T22:41Z,"Yes BUT it only refers to humans. These comics are written, drawn and sold in America. Hell they are sold at Furry Conventions out in the open. Also that law ONLY reflects real pictures. It does not count for drawings. Ive seen Toddlercon being sold out in the open and it isnt illegal. "
,Omnipharious,2011-10-25T12:40Z,"To this ""davheed72"" and ""wbane"" or anyone else who shares his sentiment, or disputes what I said- you're as wrong as you can possibly be. rockyrakun is correct, only actual pictures taken of actual beings are included in that law; this excludes drawn pictures, or even, actual pictures of people edited to look underage. Erotica, including drawn, or in any illustrated, or written material involving underage participants, either human, or non-human, in any scope, is protected under the first amendment. There have been numerous cases in court with such rulings. In regard to the laws of other countries, the law is essentially the same, including the UK, Germany, France, and most of the EU that isn't stuck in the 17th century, Japan, and most of the world powers. 

So, in other words: take your inane, ill-informed opinion and shove it back up your asses."
