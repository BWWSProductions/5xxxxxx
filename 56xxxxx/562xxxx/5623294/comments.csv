,denniz94,2010-06-13T01:10Z,how can i install ipa files without jailbreak i have a iphone 3g 3.1.3.  can anyone help me :(
,jtwg,2010-06-13T02:43Z,"@denniz94 you cannot but 3.1.3 is jail-breakable, my 3G runs 3.1.3.
i installed 3.1.3 on my iphone then used redsn0w to patch 3.1.2 and jailbreak my iphone and it worked but i think the ACTUAL 3.1.3 jailbreak is called spirit or something but if i was you I would wait for firmware 4 to come out and jailbreak it to that :)

here are redsnow and spirit links :)

and here is an article informing that the beta of version 4 has already been jailbroken http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/04/iphone-os-4-jailbreak-available-enables-multitasking-on-3g.ars
GOODLUCK!

if this app worked for you please vote it up :)"
