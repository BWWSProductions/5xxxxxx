If you can't be asked reading description below then basically: allows you to add/take music to/from your ipod/iphone/ipad using any itunes library by changing the library's unique ID. 


What is iTunesSyncFix?
----------------------
iTunesSyncFix allows you to sync your iPod/iPhone (iPad should work but not tested yet) with more than one computer.
For example, if you plugged your iPod into a different computer than the one it was originally synced to, a prompt would appear asking you to delete all music off your iPod. Not anymore.

What do I have to do?
---------------------
Make sure your iDevice is set to 'Manually manage music' on the library it currently syncs with.
Download the latest version of iTunesSyncFix, unzip it and open it on the computer your iDevice currently syncs with.
Select the first tab and get your iTunes Library ID key and save it to a file.
Transfer that file onto another PC that you want to sync with and open iTunesSyncFix.
Select the second tab and click import. Select the key file you made earlier and click OK.
Thats it!

Is there anything else I should know?
-------------------------------------
The program should tell you everything you need to know about creating, importing and backing up files.
However, to run iTunesSyncFix you will need Microsoft .NET Framework 4.
