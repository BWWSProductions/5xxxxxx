How does it work?


The Vuvuzela sound like all other steady noise is a 

pressure wave, which consist of a compression

phase and a rarefaction phase. 



Our specially designed Vuvuzela noise-cancellation

sound is a wave with the same amplitude but with 

an inverted phase to the original sound.



The waves combines to form a new wave, in a 

process called interference, which effectively 

cancel each other out -an effect which is called

phase cancellation. 



Depending on the circumstances the resulting 

soundwave may be so faint as to be inaudible to

human ears.



What do you need?


Just download our specially designed Vuvuzela 

noise cancellation MP3 and play it back on your 

home stereo system, computer, iPod, iPhone ect...



The speaker with the Vuvuzela noise-cancellation

sound should be located next to your TV. 



For best results our Vuvuzela sound cancellation

track should have the same audio power level

as the source of the unwanted sound.
