I've downloaded it. The anti-vuvuzela mp3 is the same one being sold on internet sites and is legit. But there is some software for your TV with this torrent, too, but I don't like the look of it as it is a .exe file.....so I'm staying clear of that. Just put the mp3 on a stereo speaker or ipod dock and put it near your TV, at an equal volume. That's the theory behind phase/noise cancellation anyway....we'll all have to see if it works during the next game. Good luck! And please, FIFA, BAN THE VUVUZELA!"
,Nozzzz,2010-06-16T13:35Z,anyone try that?
,vino01,2010-06-16T17:54Z,"Doesn't work.
Tryed it today with honduras - chili and Spain - switserland. 
Didn't work with either game.
The mp3 file is just 54.18 min of the vuvuzela sound."
,Uostofchuodnego,2010-06-16T21:03Z,The uploader is an idiot. Don't download this shit 'cause it's fake.
,Muteksite,2010-06-19T13:51Z,"Thanks man! :P
I saved you 4euros, so please dont call me an idiot.
I know it does not working propelly, but some beople may bought it, because it wasnt here before.

Many people dont belive, when they hear, its not working, they have to try it out."
