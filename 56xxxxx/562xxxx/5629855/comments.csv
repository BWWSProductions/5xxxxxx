,matriarchies,2010-10-07T06:24Z,"Source?  According to discogs, this is only out on 128k MP3.  Are you fraudulently upconverting to 320k, or have I missed something?"
,raiden.x,2010-10-07T08:21Z,Thank you for uploading!
,raintea8,2010-10-14T16:15Z,"The sound is pretty bad, the same as the self release actually. Also, it doesnt include the track 'Evil Boy' or 'She Makes Me A Killer'.

Could have gotten this from their website. 0/10"
,domash,2010-10-15T02:53Z,"128 kbps transcode, waste of dl! "
[T],vortex77,2010-10-20T03:00Z,Why are always the ones who have never ever uploaded anything themselves complaining about quality or missing tracks? Douche bags!!

,matriarchies,2010-12-10T18:11Z,"vortex77, doesn't matter.  Quality trumps all else, otherwise you're tricking people into thinking they have a decent copy when in fact they don't.

Also, I've uploaded 9 FLAC rips to TBP and am about to upload a quality FLAC/EAC rip of $O$.

In every one of my uploads, I document the provenance and ripping method of the recording.  So should you."
,leracos,2010-12-20T10:25Z,"Alright, so where is it then matriarchies? What's that? You don't have a quality source? Then STFU."

,furbyriot,2011-11-16T00:40Z,"Die Antwoord is one of those ""artists"" that is so horrible and ridiculous, that they become amazing and awesome.

Thanks for uploading!"
