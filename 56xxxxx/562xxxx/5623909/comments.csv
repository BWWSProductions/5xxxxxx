,alinot,2012-07-03T04:49Z,"missing ""in the beginning was the command line.""  otherwise, very good.  Let calibre autoconvert the files when transferring them to my Nook Simpletouch.  Displays fine on device like a native eBook (no formatting issues noticed in any file).

Metadata is good.

10/10 A++ would download again.

----------------------------------------

If you've never read Neal before, start with Snow Crash (short, good intro to his writing style, then move on to Cryptonomicon. ESPECIALLY read Crypto before any of the Baroque Cycle, you will miss a lot of subtext.

Also, read the Author's Notes at the beginning and the end.  Neal puts a lot of effort into researching his books.  Ever hear ""the best lies have a bit of truth in them?""  He bases as much of his fiction as he can on facts."
