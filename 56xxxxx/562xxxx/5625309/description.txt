The Practice & Improve language programs are a specially designed series that allows you to capitalize on the foreign language skills you already have to develop your ability to communicate in everyday situations.

Designed for relaxed and repeated listening, each Practice & Improve program concentrates on realistic, spoken language through the use of four 60-minute cassette tapes. These tapes feature authentic Spanish, in stereo, spoken at a natural pace and rhythm by native speakers - just as you would encounter it in Spain or other Spanish-speaking countries. Each scene is interspersed with music and short practice sections that highlight useful language points.

Two books are also included to aid your language learning: a Listening Guide containing a complete transcript of the cassette recordings and a Handbook offering instruction on vocabulary and grammar. Both books supplement the program's main activity - listening.

In the continuing episodes of this Program, you will hear the story of Julio GÃ³mez's surprising career move and of his professional, social, and private life. The idea is to relax, listen to the story, share Julio's experiences and, in the process, absorb new language and structures naturally.

As you listen to Julio GÃ³mez's personal adventures, you will also be learning or brushing up on your basic Spanish-language skills: making new acquaintances; ordering meals; expressing likes and dislikes; describing people, objects, and activities; making travel arrangements; writing a business or personal letter -- to name just a few.
