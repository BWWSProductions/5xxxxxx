,olince,2010-11-30T15:22Z,"When you open VirtualBox
On the Top (left side) Menu: File
                                         Import virtual app.
Browse for the file: Mercedes 2006 .ovf

.ovf is the command for instal the virtual application
.vmdk is the virtual disk
If it's not working it's a bad Torrent"
