Hit man John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat) refuses an assignment to kill a police officer's 7-year-old son -- defiance that doesn't sit well with his Chinatown drug lord boss, Mr. Wei (Kenneth Tsang). Wei hires "replacement killers" to finish the job and take care of Lee, and the hit man's only chance to escape is with a new passport from forger Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino). But Wei is hot on their bloody trail in director Antoine Fuqua's actioner.
