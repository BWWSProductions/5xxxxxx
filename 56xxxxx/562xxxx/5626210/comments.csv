,Zenophobe,2010-06-19T21:33Z,Subs are in Swedish...  found a copy on Demonoid that has hard-coded Engl subs.
,niglarious,2010-06-21T02:20Z,the subtitles are most certainly not english.
,tiptop65,2010-07-23T06:06Z,"I downloaded this on basis that there were english subtitles ..... but there weren't. 
Very disappointing .... Can you help Agentpiratebay??

,bluebubbler,2010-08-18T18:40Z,"Don't panic!! Get your downloaded torrent files, and extract the subtitles .rar file into the same folder as the 2 avi files. Now, when you play this with VLC media player, go to Video/ Subtitles Track/ Open File... and select the .idx file for the appropriate avi file (CD1 or CD2). NOW you'll find that the Video/ Subtitles Track menu provides a selection of 5 languages to choose from. One of these is English. [I'd presume that other media players will have similar options.]
When I burnt this to DVD with ConvertXToDVD4, I loaded up the .idx files as the subtitle file for each .avi, and then had the option of which subtitle language stream I wanted to carry over into the burnt DVD.

Thanks again for a great service! Love the series, and dreading what hollywood will do with their versions."
,smeegley,2010-08-29T02:49Z,blubber is full of blubber. it doesn't work and their swedish subs!
,smeegley,2010-08-29T02:57Z,i stand corrected. after you pick the file then you have to go back and choose the language. it works.
,adm69,2010-09-05T15:41Z,"Cheers blubber  subtitle method works ace, but double cheers to uploader, made my sunday pm"
,suck22,2010-09-16T15:24Z,Please seed
,wb21,2010-09-17T06:42Z,Im glad to finally see myself downloading a swedish title from this wonderfull swedish website
,helena1432,2010-10-03T02:31Z,i have downloaded the file and the pitcure and sound are great however i can not get the subtitles to work at all i use VLC player and have done what blueblubber has suggested but it just come up with an error message! any suggestions!!??
,helena1432,2010-10-03T02:51Z,"ignore last comment worked it out, files needed to be in the same folder silly me!!"
,enell78,2010-10-03T14:28Z,"I can't get it to work with the subs, comes up with error msg, and also when trying to convert to DVD it is not adding the subs for some reason. Help anyone? I have tried both VLC and DivX player, but none of them recognize the subs..."
,assmonkey75,2010-10-16T06:48Z,"I keep getting a ""VLC does not recognize format"" error message when I first select the appropriate idx file, though the options for subtitles do appear after.  Select english (or any of the languages) and nothing appears.  Suggestions?  I have followed the instructions to the letter."
,Ponzu17,2010-11-05T08:40Z,"After the first 20-30 minutes the English subs are as bad as if they were translated by Google.

About halfway in the movie the subs go totally out of sync and unless you know Swedish, the movie stops being watchable."
,iamere,2010-11-11T12:54Z,"hey all. I'm still having problems locating the subs for this. I usually have no problem but for some reason, there doesn't seem to be any there. I've looked in the folder and there are a couple of files which are not highlighted so my computer doesn't let me choose them as an option. I downloaded some from allsubs, but when i play it back, it's about 20 seconds out of sync. Does any one have any suggestions."
,claudioc15,2010-11-19T06:39Z,"Hi, I'd just like to add to what bluebubbler said. To get the subs to work I had to rename the .sub and .idx files so they had the same name as the video files. Then they worked fine following bluebubbler's instructions. 
Thanks for the DL."
,hacker84,2010-11-20T03:42Z,"So...for those of us who don't have time to download a new video player for every single movie, how do you install the subs? Because my DivX and QuickTime players both won't run the subs and  there is no Mac unpacker for a *.rar file. That is a WinZip (Windows OS obviously) program and file extension. Why it's even included in this package is beyond me.
"
,hacker84,2010-11-20T04:02Z,Sucks not being able to use these subs on a Mac.....or any video player I've downloaded to date. Oh well...maybe i'll get to watch this movie in a few years...
,hacker84,2010-11-20T04:22Z,"Changed filename extensions: didn't work
copied into same folder: didnt work
downloaded 3 media players (QuickTime, DivX, VLC): didn't work
followed intstructions: didn't work



Point? This is WWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY too much trouble for this. Thanks for the upload, but it's shit."

Hardcoded English subtitles for those who are having trouble rendering the sub files."
,Grievon_Mortum,2011-06-20T09:55Z,"Thanks! All I want is a clean Swedish copy with NO English subs, especially hardcoded... :/ Apparently this is very hard to find. Thanks again"
