Frederick Raphael, author of 'The Glittering Prizes', was
good friends with classics' scholar John Patrick Sullivan.
Together they explored remnents of the classical world. In
1993 they retraced the journey to Brundisium made in 37BCE
by Horace [Quintus Horatius Flaccus] and Virgil [Publius
Vergilius Maro]. It was their last trip together.

This play is Raphael's salute to the professor. It's a mixture
of learned conversations about Virgil & Horace, the political
situation in 37BCE, Virgil & Horace's possible conversations,
and the poetry the original journey inspired. 

The play closes with a short eulogy: 'In memorium John Patrick
Sullivan, Scholar of St. John's College Cambridge, sometime Dean
of Lincoln College Oxford, Professor Of Classics, University of
California at Santa Barbara, who made the journey with me, and
died, 1994, aged 63 ... a brave man who never threw away his
shield because, having no enemies, he had no need of one.'
