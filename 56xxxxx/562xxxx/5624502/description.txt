├é┬íAlarma! (Spanish for "Alarm!" is a Mexican news-magazine that specializes in graphic pictures of traffic accidents, murder victims, etc., as well as pictures of scantily clad women. The magazine was first published on April 17, 1963, and its success has spawned several competitors (including Alarde!, Enlace! and Poli├â┬⌐ster). It was censored briefly between 1986 and 1991, during which time it was not published, before returning as El nuevo Alarma! The magazine states it has a circulation of 15 million copies.

Included are a couple issues of Alarma to go with the docu.

To view the .cbr files they're in you'll need to either use a comic book archive reader (I recommend CoView), or just open the file in whatever archive program you use (a cbr is just a renamed rar) and extract the JPGs in there to wherever you want.


The docu is in Spanish with English hardsubs.
