,PhilLesh12,2010-06-14T08:50Z,"seriously, TvTeam and eztv are both really screwed up lately.

They've been reposting shit a day later so that it breaks my rss download filters and I end up downloading the same episode twice and miss the next episode (I've set them to download once every 24 hours AND smart episode filter)

Now they are spoofing the episode filters, too, by renaming the episode to the next one and waiting 24 hours.

Are they doing this shit on purpose?  "
