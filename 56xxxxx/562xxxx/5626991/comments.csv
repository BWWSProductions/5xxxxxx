Thanks for the encode/upload.

Shame that this is the last in the season BUT at least is news is good for a 4th season. Producers should be making an announcement by end of today to confirm.

Cheers
Jon"
,iamdk,2010-06-14T15:51Z,Can you upload Jackie Chan movies in English language... Doesn't matter if its dubbed...
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-15T09:11Z,"Thank you Jon and thank you JoSox.

@iamdk: All J.Chan movies are easy available, individually and as collections all over the Net, in all possible sizes and formats.
I have only two J. Chan movies in my personal collection: one is  ""Gorgeous"" (Chinese, English subtitles, never dubbed) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184526
but not because of Mr. Chan, but 'cause of miss Qi Shu, one of the prettiest womens alive.
Second one is in English, ""Shanghai Noon""
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184894
and most definitely both movies are the best Mr. J.Chan has ever done.
These two movies are the only candidates for encoding and upping."
