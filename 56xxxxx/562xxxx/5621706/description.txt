FLAWL3SS NOTES
first of all thanks to EleKtriKa and Blaze for letting us have there video and audio.
not bad for a r5 just a few touch ups. normal stuff gama saturation and black levels. I know pretty soon there will be dvdrips and brrips but we where asked to do this so we did. 
i watched entire movie and no out of sync issues the issues that were there were addressed.
for those that asked here it is and for anyone else that wants it. hope you all enjoy. from team FLAWL3SS.

credit FLAWL3SS & BDK & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
