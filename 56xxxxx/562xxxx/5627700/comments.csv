,mpcteck,2010-06-16T17:53Z,"I have been downloading these from another notorious favorite site of all of ours (starts with a ""D"") and converting to Mp3 so others don't have to and so the files are smaller. 

I have no idea where these are from, they don't sound like they are from LivePhish. I have no idea what kind of microphone was used to record.

Everyone - you are welcome."
