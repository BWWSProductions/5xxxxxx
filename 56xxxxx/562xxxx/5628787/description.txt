The adventures of 8-year-old Aardvark Arthur Read. When he's not at home being hounded by his obnoxious, but scene-stealing little sister D.W. and his working class parents, he's finding educational misadventure at school with his pals: would-be bully Binky, pompous Francine, spoiled rich girl Muffy, genius Brain, and his best friend Buster. Arthur and the gang get into some pretty wild trouble sometimes, like the time Arthur and Brain are taunted by a dark-humored crossing guard, when Arthur, Brain and Binky find a key and fight about it, when Arthur and D.W. have to run the house when Mom and Dad fall ill, and many more. Based on the children's books by Marc Brown.
