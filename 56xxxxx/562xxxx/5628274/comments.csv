   (I live in Comox BC and our Camenbert is a world award winner)  The origional The Fly scared the shite out of me, seriously was scariest movie ever for me^^. I also have both remakes the ones from 80`s and 90`s but I had NO idea that this and the next ones existed You Are King of the Lab!  (A Virtual Beer and Slab of Comox Cheese if you can tell me where that reference came from^^"

Yessir...all the Fly movies were awesome!  I think the third was the best.  I'm trying to get the voice synced before I up it.  I can settle for a little grainy video, but I just can't tolerate audio being out of sync.

Cheers!"
