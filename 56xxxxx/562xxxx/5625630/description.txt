PLOT:

Here Comes Mr. Jordan is a delightful, romantic fantasy that was the inspiration of the Oscar-winning
Heaven Can Wait. This Imaginative tale begins when Joe Pendelton (Robert Montgomery), a contender for the heavyweight boxing crown, is killed in a very untimely airplane crash. As it turn out, poor Joeâ€˜s death is a miscalculation by an erring angel (Edward Everett Horton) and Joe arrives in heaven fifty years too soon. The chief dispatcher of the "Heavently Express", Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains), attempts to correct the mistake by temporarily landing Joe the body of a just-murdered millionaire. In his new guise, Joe tries to convince his confused former manager to give him a shoot at the title, and in the maintime falls in love. Finally Mr. Jordan restores Joe to the body of a prizefighter.
