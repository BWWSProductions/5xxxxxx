,sonicx22,2011-01-27T04:17Z,"Trying to play the ISO in VLC may give undefined codec.  You'll need to unzip the .ISO files, then they'll play."

,Joleca,2012-04-26T19:35Z,"@Swanahilt, FYI..

.xlt is a Microsoft XCEL spreadsheet..  if you don't have Microsoft office 2007 or 2010, you can install Open Office (I believe its from SUN) which will allow you to open EXCEL spreadsheets, WORD documents, etc.."
