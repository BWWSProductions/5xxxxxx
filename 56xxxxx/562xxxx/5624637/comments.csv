,TheThiefOfAlwaz,2010-06-13T13:32Z,OMG!  Thank you!  I love you ;)
,robin_th01,2010-06-13T13:45Z,how is audio quality?
,errorclub,2010-06-13T13:47Z,"hey guys... i dunno if it is just a problem with my vlc-player, but if i play it, every 2 seconds it switches between a camrip of splice and part from the film ""feast"".. same problem anyone?"
,TheThiefOfAlwaz,2010-06-13T14:02Z,"The audio isn't that bad.  I'd say a 6- understandable with just a bit of an echo.  If you have ""VLC Player"" you can check out the largest vob file before it finishes downloading. "
,TheThiefOfAlwaz,2010-06-13T14:04Z,"errorclub- no, it's working fine for me with the consecutive pieces I have downloaded thus far."
,errorclub,2010-06-13T14:08Z,"sry guys, now it works^^ I think the problem only occured because the vob-file wasn't complete... works fine now, thx to the uploader"
,deathtrooper30,2010-06-13T15:42Z,About GD time!!
,goddamnusername,2010-06-13T16:13Z,"FINALLY! :o

,jahnee,2010-06-13T16:13Z,"Before you fucking complain about quality, know that they are only playing this movie in film festivals."
,eugnw9,2010-06-13T18:56Z,actually it was released in theatres June 4th
,TheThiefOfAlwaz,2010-06-13T20:30Z,Who's complaining about quality?  It's not bad at all.  I'd almost be willing to kiss the feet of whoever uploaded this killer movie.
,les79,2010-06-13T20:37Z,ummm What is VOB file?? lol I usually download AVI files... Don't know anything about this one. Can I convert that???
,les79,2010-06-13T20:39Z,Nevermind!! LOL My Converter will... convert this file!! Thanks! :)
,ClemClone,2010-06-13T21:52Z,"The 'ewwww' factor is pretty high here, so it's good that the over-all quality is not that good.
some very odd laughter from the audience at a very inappropriate part of the film.
not that great, IMHO"
,pulpf,2010-06-13T22:57Z,"Thx to the uploader, i dearly love you. Waited like a month for this torrent (the movie was already launched last year on a filmfestival in october) and just no cam to find last month.
 quality isn't that good but it is watchable. Now that I finally seen this movie I can only say. This is one sick movie.I was dying to see this movie Thx again to put me out of my misery."
,tattooedmermaid,2010-06-14T00:35Z,"jahnee - before you get all uppity on people you should probably get your facts straight... this movie premiered at a film festival back in OCT 2009 - it came out in THEATERS EVERYWHERE on JUNE 4, 2010....
as for the rest of you... this is pretty good quality FOR A CAM  so either quick bitchin or PAY TO SEE IT   :D
Im sorry but some of you ppl are so  ""GREEDY"" when it comes to this shit.

THANKS UPLOADER! IVE BEEN CHECKING EVERY DAY SINCE THE 5th for a copy of this! :D
