I encode almost 18 hours every day because I love it and - I cannot do anything else.
I'll hit 1000 encodings in my six months on TPB and 9000 torrents so far, I guess, next week.
I tell you that not to show off, but to show people what could be done if one have right intentions."
,hkoraddi,2010-06-15T17:37Z,You really deserve a VIP skull with so much of ur upload...
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-15T18:19Z,"Electricity bill is not especially heightened 'cause of that... and rest assured, one of last concerns I have."

,loulounilly,2010-06-15T23:02Z,many many thanks 2040
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-16T08:33Z,"@seenoevil47: I DID, last week. First ep. was upped, been here 2-3 hours AND NO ONE downloaded torrent. He was deleted then - and TPB do not allow re-ups (do not ask me why).
However, I'll try to figure something out."
,lilars26,2010-06-16T20:13Z,Thank you 20-40.

,laptopdog,2010-06-17T11:59Z,"Don't know if this is the right spot to ask, but the first season of Breaking Bad, in your inimitable 20-40 way, would be a magnificent thing to have..!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-17T14:30Z,@laptopdog: I want to but I cannot. Sorry.
,laptopdog,2010-06-18T22:00Z,"No worries 20-40.. it was sweet of you to answer regardless, and thanks again for everything you do upload!

It was my fault - I used to have all the seasons but I stupidly deleted them.. at least I've still got the brilliant season 3."
