,d6mcd,2010-07-04T13:23Z,Serials not working.
,JamesKim1972,2010-07-11T18:27Z,@d6mcdnSerial number works just fine. Make sure you have your internet disconnected when installing.nnAfter finishing installing you have to BLOCK xilisoft from going online.nnJust as the instructions says. Too easy. thx bigwimpie.
,gmskas,2010-07-21T18:43Z,"I can't register the product.  I'm getting an error ""Failed to connect to network.""  I blocked xilisoft dvd creator in my firewall too.  Any thoughts/suggestions?  Thx"
,brianxxx,2010-07-28T19:37Z,It all worked fine for me. Great upload! Thanks!
,brianxxx,2010-07-28T19:39Z,"I followed directions as instructed but it is all the typical stuff you need to do anyway. Block program, disconnect from net, etc.

I am running Win 7 64 bit. 

Disconnected from net.
Installed prog. 
Used serial.
Disabled updates.
Blocked internet access with my firewall.

All is just fine."
,troks2213,2010-08-03T10:45Z,"Second serial works fine for me, didn't even have to disconnect from internet, i suggest you never just try the first listed serial of anything, as they are always immediately over used and blacklisted."
,Arlith,2010-08-03T17:37Z,"Aug/03/2010 

Followed instructions to a ""T"" and none of the serials work. All it says is ""Failed to connect to network."" 

Running windows 7 64 bit"
,christiangreer,2010-08-06T08:54Z,"none of the serials worked when I tried to register xdvdc 6... I even tried a couple from a serial/crack site 

in the TPB forum there is one request for a serial however noone has answered it yet. 

can you provide a working serial as of 8/6/2010 please   

thanks"
,EXOCEPTION,2010-08-06T12:35Z,SERIAL ACTUALY WORKED FOR ME. JST BLOCK IT FROM GOIN ONLINE!!!!  THNX ALOT
,gmskas,2010-08-09T17:38Z,"I have blocked every .exe file associated with this program and I'm still receiving the ""cannot connect to network"" error.  I'm using norton for my firewall. Any thoughts?  Thanks."
,koobaxion,2010-08-14T22:19Z,"Worked great, thanks."
,wolfbr,2010-08-16T00:59Z,"It worked for a full week, donÂ´t know how.

Then it unregistered itself. Either gets a 'failed connection' when it tries to register with the serials, blocked by the firewall; or it gets an 'invalid registration key' when it does connect and refuses the cracked serials.

I gave up. Grat program though."
,mummy26,2010-09-28T18:20Z,"wolfbr is right.  it works for some days then it goes back to unregistered.  nothing works then on.  great program, just wish it were permanent."
,Cuzin_ATS,2010-10-01T04:08Z,Program Worked Fine For A Little Bit than Went To Unregistered When I Tried To Put The Code In It Wouldn't Allow It To Register But It Worked Fine For About A Week Or So :(
,imbatman452,2011-01-30T00:46Z,no good 
,RAR427,2011-01-31T13:46Z,"No longer working, it broke for me today. ;( (01/31/2011)"
,TotalLoser,2011-02-19T15:51Z,Great software and absolutely no problems installing.  Two weeks later no sudden de-registration either.  In firewall block all .exe files from outgoing tcp and it's all good.  Thanks bigwimpie.
,digididme,2011-02-24T16:06Z,"Hey can someone help me?
 I followed instructions.
Blocked the software and used the codes, along with any name and nothing. Any suggestions?
I used this once before and it worked perfectly but somehow, turned out to be a trial or at least that's where I am at now. Any help would be appreciated..send response to todaysmusician@yahoo.com if you like. Thanks once again. I really like this program, it's easy enough for me to understand it and get it to work."
,unimeister,2011-03-09T18:43Z,"the serials work perfect.
install, block with firewall, use serial."
,phillyblunt23,2011-03-11T04:37Z,"im getting the same problem as a lot of people are having as well... worked for about a week then unregistered itself and now when i try it, it says unable to connect to network blah blah blah. great program when it worked.... still works on my grandma's computer running windows xp but not on windows 7 64 bit.... dunno... weird as hell... thanks tho."
,phillyblunt23,2011-03-11T04:55Z,"for everyone having issues, i used http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6151068/Xilisoft_DVD_Creator_6.1.2.0813___Crack-_Keygen_%5Bak%5D and it worked flawlessly... check out my comments to see how i fixed the problem and you should be all set... hope this helps everyone"
,O_P_E,2011-03-21T19:22Z,"Had it registered, but it started asking me for registration suddenly and none of the serials worked."
,TotalLoser,2011-04-06T12:29Z,Great program.  I have waited a full six weeks before commenting.  No problems of the sort mentioned above - block ALL mentions of the program in the firewall and away you go.
,ozzi666,2011-05-03T03:02Z,can someone help me out with this? justdoit.ag@gmail.com
,Cgoff87,2011-05-05T18:30Z,"Thanks for the link phillyblunt. Anybody having problems with the serial, use the link he posted to get that version. This one did work for me but stopped for some reason... If your having the same problem, use the posted link."
,maiden.records,2011-05-13T12:04Z,"ok , download the torrent,then take your pc offline,i say again take your pc OFFLINE,then unpack the files,in offline mode run the programme then enter a name and serial key , should now say your registered, then enter the programme go to settings,un-tick check for updates,DO NOT UPDATE,DO NOT UPDATE,when you do the programme will not work,the programme will run fine without updates. trust me .

,vandergraaf1000,2011-06-06T18:50Z,Utter shit! Old passkeys that dont work and left unregistered it puts watermarks on screen!
,Rocketman46,2011-12-09T10:38Z,"Anyone got URL's or IP addresses to block in Hosts file? 
My firewall isn't working properly so I've had to disable it."
,paulderby,2012-01-16T21:39Z,"anyone who cant get this to work, you need to read the instructions, worked perfectly for me

Heres how to do it

Download the torrent
unplug your internet connection
install and use one the serial given

now the important part, go on to the newly installed program and click on tools, setting and UNTICK check for updates

Then and only then, reconnect your internet, and all will work well :-)

Please let me know if this has helped
