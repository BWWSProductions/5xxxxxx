Diamond Head are a British heavy metal band formed in 1976 in Stourbridge, England. They were one of the leading members of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) and are acknowledged by later bands like Metallica and Megadeth as an important early influence.

'The Best of Diamond Head' is a compilation album by the heavy metal band Diamond Head and was released by Half Moon records in 1999. This is the band's most comprehensive attempt at a definitive greatest hits. Although the record was released in 1999 it does not contain any material off their 1992 studio release Death and Progress. It also does not contain one of Diamond Head's most popular songs, The Prince (from their 1980 debut, Lightning to the Nations LP), which features regularly in their lives sets and is one of their more well known songs since Metallica covered it on their Garage Inc. release.

Metallica's Lars Ulrich assisted in the mixing of this album.
