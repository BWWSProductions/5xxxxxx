Release Notes 
IMAGiNE bringing you another release Sex and the City 2Right first off thanks to the sources on this We used the video from relizlab and some CAM audio that a friend sent us Thanks Both This video is not the best, but we tried to change a few things in it. We played with the rgb, contrast and a sharpening filter amoung a few other things. The audio is more then good enough to hear it, but like always there is a sample included to judge your self. Should do until a better video source comes along.
