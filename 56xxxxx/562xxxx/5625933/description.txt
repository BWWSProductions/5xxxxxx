In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain creates an entertaining adventure of Middle America in the 1800â€™s â€“ afloat on a raft on the Mississippi River. Huck escapes his civilized life when he arranges his own â€œmurderâ€ and turns back into the backwoods, downriver yokel he started as, and in the process springing a slave, Jim, from bondage.
Huck and Jim experience life as a series of tableaus as the river sweeps them through small towns on their way South. At each stop, Huck engages his talent for mixing fact with bald-faced lies to endlessly get himself out of situationsâ€¦ and of course, putting him into others!
Much has been written about the statement Twain is making about slavery in this book, but itâ€™s really secondary to the story. The facts of how black people were treated in this period give Huck and Jim their license for life on the run. Modern listeners will be intrigued by the unencumbered life of the pair; they make do with coffee, fish from the river, and little else (but of course, when they do need something extra, they donâ€™t mind helping themselves to it without recourse to money!) (Summary by Mark)
