Copies of this compilation CD were a gift from my 8th grade history teacher at the end of the year (that's quite awhile back now. :P)

Ripped in FLAC compression level 8 with MediaMonkey. Not sure about her original source files. (and even if I knew whether they started out lossy, I wouldn't know which lossy format to recompress them to.)

Album = "Dehollander Historical Compilation" [named after the teacher]


Tracks 1 through 3 were class in-jokes; I did not include those.

Track 11 was Bob Marley's "Buffalo Soldier"; that seems common enough that I didn't feel the need to include an extra copy of it here. Not sure of which artists' versions were used for the other songs [even if it's clear who first recorded the song]; as such, I left that tag blank. Most composer tags I did fill in, though.
I didn't fill in the 'genre' or 'date' tags either.

Otherwise, the compilation selections are here exactly as she presented them.
They are in chronological order of the time periods the song's contents refer to.

4. Yankee Doodle
5. Star Spangled Banner
6. Battle Of New Orleans 
   [FWIW, this is an original of the song that inspired Homer & Jethro's 
   Dr. Demento classic "The Battle of Kookamonga".]
7. Fifteen Years On The Erie Canal
8. When Johnny Comes Marching Home
9. Battle Hymn Of The Republic
10. Dixie
12. We're Coming To America
13. Over There
14. Maple Leaf Rag
15. Charleston
16. Cab Calloway
17. Duke Ellington
18. Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?
19. We Did It Before, We Can Do It Again
20. We Shall Overcome
21. War
22. We Didn't Start The Fire
23. God Bless The USA

(To continue the theme, may I suggest the addition of "Manifest Destiny" from the MC Lars/YTCracker Digital Gangster LP [ http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5502463 ]?)
