    Randolph Carter moves into a squalid boarding house in the summer of     
    1925 where he becomes friends with a mysterious doctor who revives       
    him after a near-fatal heart attack. Soon after, Carter discovers the    
    awful truth about the doctor and the fragile line that separates life    
    and death. Featuring a stellar performance by Jack Donner as Dr.         
    Muoz, Cool Air remains a haunting reminder of the power of the human    
    will.
