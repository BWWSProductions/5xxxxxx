rf online rf-x private server (patched, multi client patched).

1. Extract the file
2. Double click launcher file "RF"
2. Play!

Multi client should work, log into your account when the game is loaded minimize and open the launcher again and just log into your other account.

NOTE: I ziped my rf-x game folder which is already patched so it should work.
