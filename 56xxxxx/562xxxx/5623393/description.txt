An old church in a modern North American city is undergoing a renovation. Construction equipment and piles of debris cover the grounds. A deep pit has been dug for new sewer pipes.

Night falls. A woman crawls from the pit. She is weak and covered with mud, her face beaten, her throat cut. She is unable to speak, remember who she is, or how she got there.
