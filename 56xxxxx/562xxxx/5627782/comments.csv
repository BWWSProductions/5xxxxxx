She did a couple of sets with Zemani last year (Paradise, Blue) and she had the same hair style and colour (and even the same naval piercing, because she varies that as well), so they are probably taken during the same day/couple of days in different settings.

Compare it to Teendreams / Anfisa (here on TPB as well) or Muse / Allushka from Nov 2009 ( see link below ) you'll notice that it is different.
