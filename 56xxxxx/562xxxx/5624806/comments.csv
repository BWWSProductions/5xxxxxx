 Thank you very much, another good good quality one. 
Lots of Seeds but slow download, unusual - but I am not complaining.
Thanks also to Seeds & Peers."

Thanks! Pretty good movie. Don't know why bancapitalism is so negative about it, I thought it was a good bit above average :)"

,QuentinH94,2010-09-03T01:47Z,"Well, it's a decent Film... But, there are spoilers, about books, in it, which bug(s)ged Me.

Anyway...

Film: 7

The Video, and Audio, is DVD quality, 'nough said.

Worth watching'. Good humour."
