The Tannahill Weavers are an often-underappreciated irish band that has been around for a long time.  Some of their songs are hit-or-miss, but several are fantastic, including some I've been unable to find anywhere online, forcing me to buy the CD!  This is their Best Of album from their 1979 - 1989 recordings.  If you haven't heard them before, check out "The Gypsy Laddie" and "Jamie Raeburn's Farewell", which are my two favorites.
