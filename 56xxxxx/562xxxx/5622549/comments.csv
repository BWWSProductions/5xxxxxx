Sweden rules!! (and I'm not even swedish)"
,bignateTX,2010-06-29T09:11Z,"@ sumeshar -- How many people in America can get away with shit like this? Dude, all this stuff is considered illegal in the states, which is where I assume you're from. Such is why it's called ""Pirating"". I don't know the laws in Switzerland, but I do know that's where most of this ""shit"" comes from.  Here's hoping you fall face first in some ""shit"" a Sweed left on your lawn while he was drunk one night and had a few too many corn puffs...

Swedish booze is good too =P"

ThePirateBay has outsourced all their harddrives to some shitty country like Romania or something they can\'t get the warrent.nn2. Since we have such a great system in Sweden the internet suppliers erase IP adresses faster then Usain Bolt runs :P"
,jetssuck,2010-07-16T21:46Z,because this is america we create almost if not all the stuff you can buy and we pay the same as you or more when we should get every thing cheaper so this the way we do it here besides most of us don\'t just d load we buy movies software etc.. why hate?the Germans might have invented the TV but we make the stuff you watch on it. just because these greedy company\'s want more money doesn\'t mean they should control the whole industry besides  this is not all illegal  you see how these socialists try to control  all fuck that we have real freedom not an illusion like (tuggis) suggests! go U>S>A  !
,Ashes_to_Ashes,2010-07-17T03:15Z,Wow jetssuck has obviously never heard of a troll before...also his politics is a little bit too much 1947 Texas for my taste.
,MikeR56,2010-07-18T16:25Z,"@jetssuck

the Germans might have invented the TV?

Where do you come up with this shit? Fat, Lazy and stupid is no way to go through life son.

,coggie76,2010-07-19T22:01Z,"Ok bild och ljud men ?vers?ttningen ?r kass.
Usel stavning stundtals och ibland helt fel?versatt. 
Det ?r enbart engelskan som ?r ?versatt trots att det f?rekommer en hel del tyska, ryska och franska.
Detta drar ner helhetsintrycket en hel del tyv?rr."
,coggie76,2010-07-19T22:07Z,"Vet inte om det blir b?ttre nu n?r ?ndrat till svenska som huvudspr?k..

,nvapro,2010-07-25T05:09Z,"First of all, Fuck Sweden because of Roche Pharmaceuticals. Secondly, I have been using mIRC since 2001, I dont need shit torrents. All torrents did was make the scene hot and have law enforcement on our backs with the blatant liberal advertising and hippy bullshit. So fuck Sweden."
,Coppice,2010-07-28T14:00Z,"Think you'll find Scotsman John Logie Baird was credited with inventing the first working television, if you want to be trivial.

I know this isn't the place to come for political correctness, but slagging off entire countries because of a subtitled film or where TV was invented is childish and pathetic.

I was under the impression that this comments page was for discussing the quality of the film in question.

e.g.

Audio 1-10
Video 1-10

That would be much more useful than ""my dad could beat your dad"" playground-type bickering.

Thanks for the upload by the way!"

,7bongo7,2010-07-28T19:10Z,why hard coded? do we have to learn sweedish?
,listenherenow,2010-08-01T14:46Z,"I didnt realize there were ways to put subtitles where they could not be removed if you want. 

  I really wanted to load this one up but I can't take the subs off and I can't read in swedish so this would be really annoying. 

   I wish this was not this way.   I have rubbed my damn lamp for an hour though and it's not helping. 
"
,agnus_dei_swe,2010-08-04T15:40Z,"Great thank you!

I think it's so laughable that ppl complain that it has swesubs. What should he do? Tell the janitor at the cinema to turn of the subs - because he's going to release it on the Pirate bay? Let all the people who can enjoy the subs do so. You stupid fuckers."
