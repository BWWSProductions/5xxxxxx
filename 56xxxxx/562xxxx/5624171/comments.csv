,Mr888,2010-06-13T06:00Z,"DCrack, this download just failed on me twice, once at 87% and the second time at 21%. It said  ""Error: The requested operation cannot be performed on a file with a user-mapped section open"".  whats that mean ?  Is that bad ? tis a shame cause I waz looking forward to havin a fly in the dodo.  please check that error and let us know DC."
,DCrack,2010-06-13T06:04Z,"@Mr888:
This is not an error related to the program or crack, it's your torrent client. There's a lot of people that have successfully downloaded this file. Try again and let me know. Good luck."
,Mr888,2010-06-13T06:41Z,"ok DCrack, it downloaded fine the third attempt, the installer runs fine.  The funny thing is, I just realised I already have this from an existing torrent:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4902147/FSX_-_Dodosim_206     but thanks anyway.  works fine."
,bubba1991,2010-06-13T08:45Z,DCrack if you could could you look into cracking this please.  This plane is like one of the best FA18s out there i hear and it just requires Activation inorder to make it work 100%

,DCrack,2010-06-13T15:27Z,"Captain Sim 767 is next on the list for next weekend or whenever I have some time, the thing is I don't have it and it can't be downloaded from the Captain Sim web. Try to get it to me and I'll crack it, otherwise I'll work on the VRS FA18EX Superbug which is number 2 on the list."

thx."
,bubba1991,2010-06-13T20:52Z,thank you Dcrack.  I will see if i can find you an installer for the Captain Sim 767 i think i use to have it.  And in the future i will submit the stuff to your site thing.
,bubba1991,2010-06-13T21:02Z,"Also Dcrack maybe instead of doing a crack on the captain sim 767 do a better on the Level D 767.  I know those have a crack but the crack is complex and difficult to use as in it requires you to restart computer, use cmd."
,Mr888,2010-06-13T21:40Z,"@bubba1991, that VRS_FA18 torrent you linked does not exist."
,gikar,2010-06-14T18:23Z,"bubba1991: There is no need to do LEVEL D 767 for FSX. It has been cracked by KOMU (no cmd, restart etc) Just search for it."
