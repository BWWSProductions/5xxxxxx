Product Info:

While the casual player may assume that Flight Simulator X's helicopter simulation appears realistic, the truth is, it is far too stable and easy to fly. Anyone with a joystick can fly it comfortably within minutes. In a real helicopter, any input the pilot makes on one control impacts the adjustments that have to be made simultaneously on all the others in order to remain in complete control.

With the Dodosim 206, flying a helicopter reaches a new level of realism. Whether new to helicopter flying or a seasoned pro, this simulation has five selectable difficulty levels to suit. Use engine auto-start and simplified flight dynamics in assisted training modes or opt for full manual control.

Dodosim's unique physics and systems technology have replaced the default FSX hover, flight dynamics, engines and systems management. Advanced modes feature torque induced yaw, transverse flow effect, dissymetry of lift, rotor droop, vortex ring state, retreating blade stall, loss of tail rotor efficiency and more. Blade slap, transmission whine and other custom sound effects add to the immersion, while hot-start and failures keep your adrenalin level sky high!

Modelling one of the world's most recognisable and popular helicopters, the Bell 206 Jetranger, this is the definitive helicopter simulation for FSX. Developed by Dodosim and now published in a fantastic boxed edition with Flight1, this is a a 'must have' product for both experts and those new to rotary wing flying.
