In 1809, after a successful campaign about Eckmuhl, Napoleon had reached
Vienna and was ready to gain final victory over the Austrian army. But
Archduke Charles and his army were in place across the Danube River 
and ready to give battle. The resulting battles of Aspern-Essling and 
Wagram would be the largest battles in history at the time. Will 
Napoleon's reputation of invincibility be continued or will these 
battles result in his first significant setback?
