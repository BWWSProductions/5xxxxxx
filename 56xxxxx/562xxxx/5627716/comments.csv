Enemy at the Gates is better, might as well just go dl Band of Brothers if you want more than just snipers, Russian, and German.
A:6  There's a Russian voice translation during the German speaking parts.
V:8  One of the few movies from a different point of view other than the British/US during this war."
,svonka,2011-12-02T00:55Z,"I would first like to thank the contributor of this torrent for his effort. I have to say however that the subs that are included in it are the worst I have ever seen on TPB. Either the translator has a serious disability when it comes to translating Russian into English, or he/she has used Google translate or some similar service, which just does not work. You must have a good grasp of both languages.
It is sad since I enjoyed watching some parts of the film - but the awful subs made me loose my patience about a third into it. A lot of the time you just can't make any sense of the subs at all, and when you can (kinda) they are still inept. I've seen several Russian films that were subtitled exellently. I just can't understand why this one has to be an exeption...   "

Suffice it to flee, boy, faster,
quickly, as soon as they hit mortars!

And this is one of the ones that you can figure out.  "
,s47000,2012-01-07T23:35Z,"Let me add that if the translator from Russian to English was trying to get English speakers to watch a Russian film, then we English speakers will need a little help from the Anglo-Russian community.  Thanks for the effort, though."
