,kanha,2010-06-14T09:11Z,"@pluto
plz do some horror movies of u'r own choice....
it'll be nice to see them in hd.
horror like 'The Girl Next Door (2007)'"
,vivek104,2010-06-14T19:37Z,its not as good as ur other uploads it is cropped  plz do 2nd one correct plzzzzzz
[V],pluto999,2010-06-14T19:59Z,@vivek104: Even i'm not satisfied with this one. transformers 2 will be round 850-1gb to ensure enough bit rate.
,vivek104,2010-06-14T20:22Z,if u can upload transformer 1 also in around 1gb then it will be great bcoz for these types of films quality matters a lot
