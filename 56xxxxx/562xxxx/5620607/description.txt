Britney Spears- Toxic

Baby, canâ€™t you see
Iâ€™m calling
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
Itâ€™s dangerous
Iâ€™m fallinâ€™

Thereâ€™s no escape
I canâ€™t wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
Youâ€™re dangerous
Iâ€™m lovinâ€™ it

Too high
Canâ€™t come down
Losing my head
Spinning â€˜round and â€˜round
Do you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
Iâ€™m on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
Iâ€™m addicted to you
Donâ€™t you know that youâ€™re toxic
And I love what you do
Donâ€™t you know that youâ€™re toxic

Itâ€™s getting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil's cup
Slowly
Itâ€™s taking over me

Too high
Canâ€™t come down
Itâ€™s in the air
And itâ€™s all around
Can you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
Iâ€™m on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
Iâ€™m addicted to you
Donâ€™t you know that youâ€™re toxic
And I love what you do
Donâ€™t you know that youâ€™re toxic

Don't you know that you're toxic

[x2]
With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
