[V],poppedtart,2010-06-13T22:28Z,"a movie will only have 720 or 1080 vertical lines if the movie was shot in 16:9 Aspect Ratio.  Very few movies are shot in this AR.  The remainder pixels are just black to letterbox the film.  This video has 544 vertical lines of resolution.  That is the correct vertical resolution for a movie shot in 2.35:1 AR.  To make it have 720 pixels I would just have to fill the remainder with black.  That is how a normal BluRay or DVD comes (with black padding).  For a movie to be considered 720p, it should have 1280 pixels width OR 720p pixels height.  All PT films will be 1280 width or 720p height for a cartoon or something, the height is not mine to control, that is the directors control."
