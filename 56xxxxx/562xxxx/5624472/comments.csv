,hellmarvel,2010-08-08T10:10Z,"Working fine so far, I used the serial provided in the text file. And you need to be connected to internet while installing, because it needs some Microsoft components in order to work.

ipop,

Yes, the software is in English, only the text files in this torrent are in Dutch, but are easy to figure out. You only need the ""Instructie"" file (instructions), to get the serial from (the first one is the one you need).

Can I or should I check for updates from nero? thanks so much for the torrent because I had problems installing the 1 from Degun.

,billy1989,2010-09-02T20:22Z,"@manonfire
fuck me silly, thanks very much for that, help me out loads,"
,isepiq,2010-09-06T09:41Z,Delete all the Patent Activation files in the Nero Common Folder under Program Files.  Input the Nero Activation Serail too!  Do NOT let Nero or any of ITS programs access your Network OR the Internet.  Go to Microsoft Update & update the files you need from there FIRST.
,waseem3000,2010-09-06T18:33Z,"Ok everyone facing problem with Nero Patent Activation i.e. Nero Vision saying it is pirated etc etc. follow these steps:

Download this torrent and install nero, can also be downloaded from nero website which is the trial version.

Open keygen and use 9X03-016C-MXEX-4536-T0L7-2W2T-AMPX-97TA which is for Nero Multimedia Suite to install. Before installer starts it may restart the computer once and there will be a key already present in the key field once it does so, delete that key and use this.

Install complete software and then close the installer when it finishes (it takes time to do so for installing).

Now again get back to the keygen and generate key for Activar Patentes 1E30-9XK2-192A-X2X0-5746-A632-ECCK which will be this one. To enter this key go to your start menu>all programs>Nero 10 and open Nero Control Center inside the menu and under serial number field enter the key. If using Vista or Win 7 accept the security popup to enter the serial. It will accept serial and show ""Activation"".

Now do the same steps and add the following keys for Bluetooth plugins and Recode. 1EE0-4X07-194A-0K04-9E21-73XA-XAA3 1E31-9ME5-988X-447E-9A21-69X8-XX2X 4E31-5X1X-9990-0KE9-X1AM-9K9K-C9C5 the program will accept them again as ""Activation"".

These keys will activate mp3 plugins, gracenote and DTS plugin and with each serial entered the program will inform you of the serial entered and you get the names for only these: 1K00-6035-0593-5A40-37K0-K776-574C KC00-203X-1886-2446-051E-54C2-XC60 1EC0-0E89-9849-KA31-K227-MA85-3812

After that press ok and you are good to go. Now if you follow this step-by-step all will work 100 percent. Better to restart the computer so everything works smoothly (not needed and up to you).

You can use the same keys posted here as keygen ONLY generates these keys and one for each listing and save you time as well by using them as I already pasted them.

I have tested this and it works without issues. Now how do I know it works as have a lot of experience fixing computers and have used the above in many computers without failure. So hope I can help and many thanks to the uploader.

Sorry for the loooong post."

You are the newbie.

Block all Nero apps with your Firewall. If you dont know how, use the Windows help function.
If Nero is blocked with the Firewall, it is impossible to see that you are using a fake serial.

Ok everyone facing problem with Nero Patent Activation i.e. Nero Vision saying it is pirated etc etc. follow these steps:

Download this torrent and install nero, can also be downloaded from nero website which is the trial version.

Open keygen and use 9X03-016C-MXEX-4536-T0L7-2W2T-AMPX-97TA which is for Nero Multimedia Suite to install. Before installer starts it may restart the computer once and there will be a key already present in the key field once it does so, delete that key and use this.

Install complete software and then close the installer when it finishes (it takes time to do so for installing).

Now again get back to the keygen and generate key for Activar Patentes 1E30-9XK2-192A-X2X0-5746-A632-ECCK which will be this one. To enter this key go to your start menu>all programs>Nero 10 and open Nero Control Center inside the menu and under serial number field enter the key. If using Vista or Win 7 accept the security popup to enter the serial. It will accept serial and show ""Activation"".

Now do the same steps and add the following keys for Bluetooth plugins and Recode. 1EE0-4X07-194A-0K04-9E21-73XA-XAA3 1E31-9ME5-988X-447E-9A21-69X8-XX2X 4E31-5X1X-9990-0KE9-X1AM-9K9K-C9C5 the program will accept them again as ""Activation"".

These keys will activate mp3 plugins, gracenote and DTS plugin and with each serial entered the program will inform you of the serial entered and you get the names for only these: 1K00-6035-0593-5A40-37K0-K776-574C KC00-203X-1886-2446-051E-54C2-XC60 1EC0-0E89-9849-KA31-K227-MA85-3812

After that press ok and you are good to go. Now if you follow this step-by-step all will work 100 percent. Better to restart the computer so everything works smoothly (not needed and up to you).

You can use the same keys posted here as keygen ONLY generates these keys and one for each listing and save you time as well by using them as I already pasted them.

I have tested this and it works without issues. Now how do I know it works as have a lot of experience fixing computers and have used the above in many computers without failure. So hope I can help and many thanks to the uploader.

Sorry for the loooong post."

,bravo2011,2011-06-17T00:32Z,"Nero Vision has different copy protection, So Vision will never run right without 3rd party activation (all the other nero stuff does seem to run with crack). Nero rom will work because it has very light copy protection.  I only found 2 ways to get Vison to work and 1 was , Download the trail version, when the trail runs out put your computer date back to when the program was vaild, (You also have to rewirte the file that opens related to patent activation with an empty txt or folder of the exact same name) this method worked for me for 2 years with nero 8 ultra. The 2nd way; which I just did was give nero $59 and bought it bacause it was starting to cost me WAY more money in time (related to what I get paid an hr)  to get this dam thing working."
,God2010,2011-06-18T07:59Z,"@bravo2011.... yOU ARE WRONG, PATENT ACTIVATION PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY USING THE PATENT ACTIVATION KEY GIVEN BY AFRICAN BRAT IN COMMENTS PAGE 7. BUT NEVER EVER ALLOW NERO TO ACCESS THE INTERNET ONCE YOU STARTED THE INSTALLATION. I AM USING THIS IN MY TWO COMPUTERS. AND NERO VISION IS RUNNING WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM."
,bravo2011,2011-06-18T13:30Z,"God you're probably right, like I said I did the steps 5 times and Vison wound't stop asking for the activation, everything else worked fine. Ive been around for a while and on the most part know alot about computer hardware and software I was defeated by this only one. So glad it worked for you mate, I wish i had better luck but in the end mine works %100 now and I can upgrade so im cool with that."
,bravo2011,2011-06-18T13:46Z,"And also God Nero Vision NEEDS to be activated the same way Windows needs to be activated Serials alone shoudn't work with that because there's no loader with this release. Vision requires an activation, So awesome your's worked but also remeber from past releases that Vision will appear to work for a bit and then should shut down without that activation"

,BunBun4life,2011-09-24T01:52Z,"IT WORKS, HERE IS HOW YOU GET THE ''KEY''

There are 2 APPLICATIONS in your downloaded file - 
ONE is the set up Nero - 10.0.13100 with 299,521 KB 

The 2nd one is where you get your SERIAL NUMBER !!  It is called:

Nero Multimedia Suite 10 - Keygen   
Type - application - 641 KB
with a little black and white icon next to it.  

Everything else is a text document or JPG

CLICK AND OPEN

THEN WHERE IT SAYS PRODUCTO - use the arrow to the right to DROP DOWN menu and click on NERO 10 Multimedia Suite THEN PRESS THE GENERAR BUTTON.  THAT long number that appears MUST be entered in the serial number line on your INSTALL WIZARD.

THERE IS ALREADY A NUMBER IN THAT SERIALNUMMER SPACE ON THE INSTALL WIZARD, BUT IT IS EXPIRED.

DELETE IT AND THEN YOU  MUST HAND TYPE THE NEW SERIAL NUMBER, YOU CANNOT COPY AND PASTE.

ALSO, I THINK THAT LITTLE  ''KEYGEN'' APPLICATION CAN BE USED PROBABLY OVER AND OVER.   So you an probably download nero right off the net, generate a new serial number, and type it in.

Let me also say this.   It is my understanding that NERO has no technical support what-so-ever.  EVERY review I've read states that they bought it, had problems, and no resolution because they don't support the program, and advised not to buy it for that reason.  I had used this program for VIDEO EDITING, and it was easy to learn and did a wonderful job, also has TONS of effects to use TONS -- 3 track lines for music and/or pictures/video - it was fucking AWESOME, and no other has compared.   (RARE for video editors, either cheap and shitty or too hard to use)  I mean you got Windows movie maker, it's easy but has barely any ''effects'' - 1 song 1 line of still images. 

I was ready to buy this until I read the reviews.  I don't care about DVD rips or burns, or organization, or any of that shit.  I just want that VIDEO MAKER.
