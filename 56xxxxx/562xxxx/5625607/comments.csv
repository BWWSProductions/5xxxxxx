Most of these tracks were never given a CD release, and therefor could not have been originally ripped to WAV or FLAC, so they were probably lossy mp3 sourced.  That being said, there are a lot of great tracks in this unofficial compilation (my favorite being ""Kyle Petty, Son of Richard""), so feel free to grab it anyway."

These are not concert recordings. 
How do I know? I've posted the same album
that I encoded myself."
