Dave Brubeck - Reflections 
Year: 1985
Label: Concorde CCD-4299
Quality: flac

This is one of Dave Brubeck's more obscure recordings but not because of its quality.  Somewhat lost in the shuffle, this excellent quartet session with clarinetist Bill Smith, Chris Brubeck (on electric bass and bass trombone) and drummer Randy Jones finds the pianist/leader performing eight of his compositions; only "Blues for Newport" caught on a little.  The emphasis is on slower tempos and wistful solos ( particularly on the Paul Desmond-tribute "We Will All Remember Paul" ) but the music is stimulating enough to hold one's interest throughout.  Dave Brubeck has never allowed himself to become predictable. ~ Scott Yanow
