The Museum Of Curiosity - Series 01 to 03 - Audio Comedy - BBC Radio 4 via DVB-T
18 x 30 Minute Episodes - 128Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo


This show is built on the concept that the (fictional) Museum of Curiosity is a vast building with a mission statement of housing everything in the universe that is in some way curious. Each week a panel made up of entertainers and academic experts put forward their curiosities to the head of the museum 

The only rule for donation is that the exhibit has to be in some way curious. It doesn't matter if something is big, small, expensive, or even if it doesn't exist. Current exhibits in the Museum include a yeti, the Holy Grail, the Big Bang when it was the size of a grapefruit, and the urge to press red buttons that should not be pressed.

www.comedy.org.uk Review: 
[quote]A curious programme which is in many ways a spin-off from the hit TV series QI. What is mainly notable about this programme is that it not only features comedians, but it also gives guest spots to academics such as historians, mathematicians and paleontologists. However, the programme still manages to maintain an amusing edge. There are some listeners however, who feel that too much time is taken with the guests and not with the exhibits they donate.[/quote]

The series has achieved a considerable following and plans are underway to build a website devoted to the show with forums, podcasts and exhibits.
