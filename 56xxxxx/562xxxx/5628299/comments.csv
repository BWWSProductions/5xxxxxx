,flatusgass,2011-03-31T09:45Z,"""Tiny sized""? You must be joking.

Why are the days of nearly 2GB (and 2+ GB) STANDARD def movies still around? These people who rip, whom get such intense ass-sucking from clueless fanboys, are not really that great at what they do. I just watched two different 720p rips I got off Demonoid, which were an unbelievable 500MB! I figured they'd suck, but I was curious as to how bad they'd blow. Well, not at all, turns out. They were indeed 720p, not fuzzy/soft, and looked miles ahead of these ridiculous 2GB standard-def rips.

Really though, why arent more films being ripped in HD like that? There are people out there who clearly know how.

MORE 500MB HD RIPS!"
