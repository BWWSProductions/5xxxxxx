The Monks released just one studio album ... Black Monk Time ... which came out only in Germany in 1965. This compilation covers their pre-Monk band, The Torquays, and includes post-"Monk TIme" 7"s. Raw and primitive, experimental to the extreme, these guys were wayyy ahead of the pack. Check 'em out!!
