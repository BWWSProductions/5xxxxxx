You're welcome ^,.,^"
,ChadBoyes,2010-06-13T23:26Z,1 seeder and 40 leecher's? That's pathetic guys.
,Furchee,2010-06-14T00:06Z,Looks like a lot of people want it ... =3
,Wykd_Wolf,2010-06-15T02:28Z,Can someone PLEASE seed this? I can only get 34% or so.
,Furchee,2010-06-15T03:16Z,"It is being seeded.
Since it's still new, I'm basically the only person with 100 %. The highest the peers have are around 40 % now. You're just going to have to wait till the rest gets seeded. My upload speed sucks, so this may take a day or two."
,Furchee,2010-06-18T04:52Z,"Tried to add my FurAffinity page into the Contact section of the description, but every time I do, it deleted half of the description.

So FA stands instead of Furaffinity,net"
,Furchee,2010-06-18T04:54Z,"Nah, I just added a "","" instead of a ""."" and it seems to work that way.
Guess that will have to work instead. (They really need a ""delete comment"" button on here >.."
,17Patty,2010-06-25T12:53Z,"wow. what a collection! thanks, Furchee

im low on disk space, so i'll seed until i have to make room on my hard drive by deleting the original .rar file ^^"
,chemical_art,2010-08-25T03:33Z,"Hey there, leeched and will now seed with top priority for the next month or so...But I see no club stripes folder, was it deleted?  :("
,HystericalHusky,2010-09-10T04:19Z,GREAT TORRENT So Many Pictures Good Download Speed will Seed as Long as I can Great Pictures and so many.  Thanks Furchee and thanks all for seeding
,HystericalHusky,2010-09-20T07:18Z,Seeded at 500kbps for about a week now enjoy guys 7.2 ratio and 76.5 gb uploaded :) Ur Welcome
,bEEr2010,2010-11-05T23:08Z,how do i play of the flash files?
,FuyuKitsune,2010-11-06T02:48Z,"All the content is good, but a single RAR? Leave the sections separate next time so that downloaders can choose specific sections and not need to download the entire thing."
,Furchee,2010-11-18T12:50Z,Can't keep you all happy.
,mathwizi2005,2011-01-05T05:47Z,"its not that its 1 file   its that for most systems, our archivers will crash or run into error frequently due to the file size (takes forever for my system to read the archive and i have a quad core), spliting it into rars for each folder would have been more optimized"
,Furchee,2011-01-12T01:27Z,"We all need to learn by our mistakes. If I ever release another one, it'll be split into sections. As for the winrar crashing, that's never happened to me. It's also fairly easier to locate when it's all in one file. It's made to be extracted and then the rar either seeded or deleted.
Optimization isn't really going to be that much better split or not.
But, as I said, I will split it next time."
,Reav3,2011-01-28T01:57Z,"Jesus christ. I downloaded it expecting maybe five or six thousands pictures. NOPE. Fifty. Thousand. Pictures. I don't even know what to do with all of them. God bless you, Furchee."
,Furchee,2011-02-28T12:11Z,"@ Reav3

You're welcome. I'm glad you like it =)"
,nicqawsed,2011-04-25T06:00Z,you ought to put it into files and catagories instead of an archive folder so that thos not fortunant enough to have 10 gb of free space for furry porn can trim-down what we dont need.... just a sugestion
,Furchee,2011-05-03T07:38Z,"@ nicqawsed
Thanks for stating the same thing 20 people have before you.
Do you read comments ? You should."
,Timewarp43,2011-06-15T20:28Z,Club Stripes? I am going to seed this fucker forever!
,astridge,2011-11-26T23:31Z,will seed forever once it downloads
,Furchee,2011-12-29T10:02Z,"For the lovers of this torrent, I MAY upload another part of my ""newer"" collection.
(About an additional 18 gigs of it ...)

Depending on my mood and if I get a faster upload speed, I shall upload EVERY thing I have ever downloaded. Including some never before seen (and specials off Furaffinity) artwork from various artists off of all sites that require a subscription."
,BannedUfos,2012-02-17T20:42Z,"18 gigabytes, wow"
,vstahns,2012-05-06T12:37Z,"OH MY GOD, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU x1,000,000
