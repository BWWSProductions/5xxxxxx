Beautiful looking bright daylight scenes.......

BUT......

THE WORST DARK SCENE NOISE I HAVE EVER SEEN ON A 1080P RIP.

If you are picky and want nice picture thru the whole movie, I suggest finding another rip.

Some darker scenes, there is absolutely no definition, it just looks like a billion mosquitos have attached themselves to your screen."
,devildog93,2010-06-22T00:27Z,"After reading online, sounds like this is a production issue. ( filmed like this on purpose )

If this is what they are putting out nowadays, I think I might sell my HDTV gear and go back to an old CRT TV.

Why fucking spend money for HD shit anymore if this crap is what film companies think looks good.
Universal, go fuck yourselves

And all apologies to uploader."
