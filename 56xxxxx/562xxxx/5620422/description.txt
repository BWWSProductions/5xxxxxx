Plot: 
An old church in a modern North American city is undergoing a renovation. Construction equipment and piles of debris cover the grounds. A deep pit has been dug for new sewer pipes.

Night falls. A woman crawls from the pit. She is weak and covered with mud, her face beaten, her throat cut. She is unable to speak, remember who she is, or how she got there. This is Laura.

Hungry, thirsty, she ventures out into the city, stealing food and warm clothes to survive. As she wanders the streets, she begins to see things that jar her memory: a picture on a wall, a historical marker, a map. Slowly, she starts to put the pieces together - the Old River Front, a house and family, a lover and a jealous suitor. She embarks on a trek across the city, trying to blend in and adjust to a modern world she has never seen before.
