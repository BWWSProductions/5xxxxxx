Making paths, logos, and lines come to life


With 3D Stroke, paths, logos, or lines can take on lives of their own: glowing, tapering, and moving in complex ways through 3D space, while a 

built-in camera lets you capture the action from any angle. It's broadcast TV's secret weapon for animated logos and sophisticated write-on effects. 




Trapcode Echospace 1.0


Painless control of 3D layer instances
Echospace takes the tedium out of working with multiple layer instances in After Effects. Begin with an image, text, footage, or even compositions, and 

Echospace will create multiple versions of that layer that can be controlled as a group or individually. Movement and effects can ripple through the stack â€” 

with offset and delay controls and much more.




Trapcode Horizon 1.0


A camera-aware image mapping tool

Give your compositions what they've been missing with this unique mapping tool. The Trapcode Horizon plug-in is a camera-aware image mapping tool that ties 

your After Effects camera to a 3D world. By applying images or gradients to the inside of a giant sphere, Horizon creates an infinite background. 

No matter where your camera is directed, the simple controls make photorealistic backgrounds or sky gradients a snap. 



Trapcode Lux 1.0


A way to see the light in After Effects

The 3D lighting feature in After Effects creates pools of light generated from light sources in 3D space â€” but you can't see the light itself or the cone 

it produces. Enter Trapcode Lux: a speedy plug-in that adds volumetric lighting effects to projects that require realistic spotlights, point lights, or 

stage lighting of all kinds. (Now published by Red Giant Software.)




Trapcode Particular 1.5

Quick-rendering 3D particles with full camera integration and natural behavior

Many editing programs offer basic particle-generation features. But Trapcode Particular goes way beyond the basics, with real-time interactive previews, 

bouncing particles, 3D camera integration, particles that emit particles, custom shapes, air resistance, gravity and turbulence controls, depth of field, 

and more. Get the effects seen in â€œSpider-Man 3.â€



Trapcode Shine

Ultra-fast light ray effects

Create compelling light effects without leaving your editing timeline, and without the tedious render times of specialized 3D applications. 

Sunshine through clouds, headlights through fog, or horror movie titles â€” Shine does it all. Choose from 22 powerful presets, or make your own light ray 

effects from scratch. With 16-bit and 32-bit support , Trapcode Shine guarantees high-quality light effects for any project. 



Trapcode Sound Keys

Easy audio-to-video synchronization

Audio-intensive animations no longer require time-consuming hand tweaking of keyframes. Trapcode Sound Keys makes it easy to synchronize motion and sound 

in After Effects using either amplitude or frequency ranges. Unlike palette-based audio-sync products, Sound Keys is applied as a regular effect, making 

it possible to save settings with your project, generate keyframes into output parameters, and link keyframes to expressions. 



Trapcode Starglow

Dazzling effects to transform ordinary highlights

Starglow is a fast-rendering multidirectional glow effect. It can be used to create multicolored star-shaped glints like those created by a camera filter. 

Each customizable glow consists of up to eight directions, and each direction can be assigned an individual color map and streak length offering endless 

possibilities.
