,dlt1995,2010-07-19T08:46Z,ill seed if they work but ive benn havin shitty luck b4 but team x force worked for cs4 so lets hope they work for cs5
,GIGinger,2010-10-12T04:06Z,"This doesn't actually work... it allows you to use the effects and adds the plugins; however, it leaves a big red ""X"" on your video indicating you're using the trial version.

used with:
windows 7 64
adobe after effects CS5"
,GIGinger,2010-10-12T04:59Z,"EDIT: for some reason some of the plugins require me to reenter the serial number.

In after effects choose the effect you want (ex shine) then when the window pops up to the left side click ""options"" under the shine FX category. reenter a serial number and click done.  close AE and reopen, red x is gone.

,Catrachito,2010-12-16T16:18Z,"As an extra comment, I realized that Sound Keys doesn't work with the provided serial as the serial included is for an earlier version.

To activate it, use one of the following serials:

8829-9232-1391-8339-3371
1386-9216-1847-3563-2827
8379-9228-1604-8523-3584"

,NextDimension,2011-08-19T17:00Z,"No one else seems to be having my problem. I am a little bit of a noob, but not that much. When I enter in the serial number I am not able to click done, it's blocked out. What am I doing wrong, it's definitely the correct serial, I tried the ones provided as well ass the ones listed here in the comments."
