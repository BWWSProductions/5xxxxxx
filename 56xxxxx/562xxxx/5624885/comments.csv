[T],FatFreddy69,2010-06-16T01:55Z,Thank you very much. I used it for an old sony laptop which had lots of brocken sectors. They all got repaired so it worked!
,FAKMAN,2010-06-24T10:16Z,thanks!!!
,MJKW2Ab,2010-09-07T06:48Z,"THANKS! I sure hope this program can save a hard drive, where SpinRite 6.0 seems to not be able too. "
,MJKW2Ab,2010-09-09T09:19Z,"Just an update from a tech for anyone curious. My previous computer proved to shared both a bad mother board (started freezing on Bios Splash screen- ""GATEWAY"" upon boot-up) - And yet the only known competition, long lived SpinRite HD program (Too High at $90.00!!) could not repair that hard drive either- Both programs failed as they well should on a HD that was friend out of this world. I admit such programs adds some reinforcement when one really wants to peg down exactly what problems there are with a drive AND what other hardware issues there are. HDD helped me conclude the other computer had a mother board issue as well because of the way the hard drive was checked. So this program and SpinRite both seem to serve a useful purpose when trying to extend the life of a failing hard drive, or wishing to maintain one so it lasts longer, as no destructive data is done unless one runs a format or Fdisk first.

Thanks for this small and heavily protective option to SpinRite with keygen and instructions. A good hard drive sector analysis program for PCs are pretty darn rare!

 I wish we had more uploads by the MODS because I feel we can trust you guys more. (even if I have yet to upload yet). THANKS!! 

This program will be very valuable despite the fact I could never afford to buy it being jobless."
,sage99x,2010-09-14T08:53Z,"can someone upload a bootable iso file. this thing doesn't work full in windows 7, only trial. the keygen wont work in win7."
,zopfan,2010-09-19T17:13Z,"Installed ok, but cracked with an error.

But still showed as 'Registered'.

But when I give it a hdd to fix/regenerate, it simply asks me to keep waiting. And I've waited for hours together, but no result. And in the end I've to 'End Task' or Log off.

,aucado54,2010-11-18T19:08Z,Will give this one a try a simular one I downloades was full of junk that took me hours to remove before I could delete the program.

,Muianescu,2011-02-11T01:57Z," Thanks for the upload, it works fine in Windows 7 x64, but only if follow the instructions. And it was helpful diagnosing a external HDD with bad sectors."
[T],Valdo__PT,2011-04-25T19:11Z,The patch doesn't work in Windows 7 x32.
