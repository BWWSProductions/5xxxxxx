,Kellso76,2010-06-14T05:56Z,Thx PT.....I should have posted a link for em but it wouldn't help because he is using a PC......
,Kellso76,2010-06-14T06:02Z,"Sorry for the pain your PC is causing you Mik3ey....LOL try Handbrake for PC or Google and try to find out sum programs that will work for u....I also use Aimersoft, MediaFork, Wondershare Video Converter, Moyea Bluray Ripper and Mac Bluray Ripper.....these are all Mac programs but they may have Windows versions."
,Kellso76,2010-06-14T10:19Z,"When you say advanced settings, what specificly do you mean? Do you mean things like the aspect ratio, or certain kinds of filters? "
,Kellso76,2010-06-14T10:26Z,"Mik3y, sometimes I use a couple of different programs on one rip just to get it the way I want it. PT has the best program out but its for super geeks only (no disrespect intended PT...LOL). Handbrake has advanced settings but I have tried to use handbrake for Windows and got way to pissed off to keep trying...LOL I wish you luck. I'm sure you'll find something. "
,Kellso76,2010-06-14T15:25Z,"Try Handbrake for windows.....you should be able to mess with all of that stuff.......I know I can adjust things like that on the Handbrake for Mac so I would give that a shot. PT has an un compiled program she deals with so its a little bit more geeky then just B-frames...LOL its actual code that has to be written on a Linux platform.....but in my opinion, its the best. When u upgrade to Mac, maybe you can tackle that Bear...LOL"
,Kellso76,2010-06-14T20:51Z,"Sorry buddy......you might wanna get a piggy bank and start saving cause if you want the best, you're gonna have to pay for the best......try Powermax.com or applepalace.com...they have great deals on older Intel Macs.....just upgrade to Snow leopard and they run as good as new Macs"
,bara-d,2010-06-20T19:27Z,where the heck MIKEY GOES ?
