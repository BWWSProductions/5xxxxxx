Stargate Universe (Complete Season 1)

The Previously unknown purpose of the "Ninth Cheveron" is revealed, and ends up taking a team to an Ancient ship "Destiny", a ship built millions of years ago by the Ancients, used to seed Distant galaxies with Stargates. This team, led by Dr. Nicholas Rush and Colonel Everett Young, are trapped on the ship, unable to change its programmed mission, and encounter new races, new technology and new enemies, as the runaway ship takes them to the far ends of the Universe. 

For those who don't know the show I included a 15minute Teaser/Trailer I made.
If you have indeed not seen anything Stargate related yet, go and get the whole thing - it is defenitly worth your while. Although it's not really necessary, you get a better understanding of what is going on with the background knowledge one gains through the complete stargate frenchise (SG1 and SG-Atlantis).
