Climategate  The Global Warming Fraud Conspiracy

CLIMATEGATE IS THE LIGHT SHINING ON THE DARKNESS OF THE GLOBAL WARMING SCAM

Part 1 of 2 Parts


A wise man once said that darkness hates the light. That truth has an amazing application to perhaps the biggest fraud of our era: global warming.

Itâ€™s no secret that ever since Marxism coiled itself around Russia and Eastern Europe, its tyrannical philosophy of destruction cast its eyes westward. For many decades, communists, socialists and the global elite have tossed a dizzying array of predicaments into American culture; that carbon dioxide emissions generated by mankind are ruining the planet, is their greatest assertion yet.

Author Brian Sussmanâ€™s thorough investigation into the motives, practices, and ultimate agenda of these radical agents of change is critical to Americans who wish to untangle the web of deceit being sold as concern for the environment.
