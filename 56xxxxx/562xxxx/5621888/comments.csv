Whenever you're using a full functioning trial version of antivirus (whether you have 30 days or 1 day left) follow my instructions: in kaspersky settings --settings--disable self-defense--exit kaspersky.Open registry (type regedit in RUN ) --navigate to HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\software\kapserskyLab\protected\avp9\environment\pcid. In pcid click modify and change last three digits with any digits you want .Start kaspersky and activate AGAIN your 30 day trial. You welcome."
,anon759,2010-06-17T22:39Z,Keys are all blacklisted already.
,coleix,2010-06-21T07:43Z,already blacklisted?
[T],Omerta-U,2010-06-22T23:25Z,"trial reset works perfectly.

Be sure to set kaspersky self defence inactive.

After reactivated with new trial, kaspersky will recognize this trial reset as malicious code and disinfects it...

Put this page to bookmark to have the oppurtunity to download it again, or write the reset code file to cd."

[T],Omerta-U,2010-07-16T07:44Z,"YepnKasper was faster than you:DDDnSee above my comment - Before even downloading this nice stuff, turn off kasper for a while ( but again, be sure its self defence is shut down)"
