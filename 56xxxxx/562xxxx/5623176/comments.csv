,Sherek9,2010-06-16T18:10Z,no but you can play lan (i know that you can play online but the you must updtate the game and then you cant play it again)
,aidan138,2010-06-18T07:29Z,Were do you extract the files to sir? Should you need to have a product key or a form of installation to make this work?
,denniz94,2010-06-19T00:15Z,ok shrek9 thanks for the help 
,genwhite,2010-06-21T01:16Z,"Good idea, but does not work. Says Invalid Key. Please reinstall game."
,Sherek9,2010-07-16T12:27Z,genwhite@ i said (no but you can play lan (i know that you can play online but the you must updtate the game and then you cant play it again) that whas what i ment but if wanna play it again you have to download a iso and install the game so please do NOT try to play online but LAN works.
,Sherek9,2010-07-16T12:28Z,aidan138@ you can extract it anywhere so it dont matter as long as you dont play online( lan works)
,celtic66,2010-08-14T11:01Z,"first off, if you extract the game wont work because of invalid key...
second: ive replaced the exe with a crack and the 'gathering exception data' shit occurs.
Game doesnt work."
,Ravenxl7,2010-09-19T05:16Z,"ok, i've downloaded it...now what? all that's there is a .rar file that i can't use..."
