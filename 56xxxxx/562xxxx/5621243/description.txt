A new twist on the Eugene death metal scene, Carrion (dead rotted flesh) Remains is a four piece Psych Death metal band hailing from the Valley of sickness. Pulsating rythms, grinding staccoto riffing, thunderous low-end and Banshee screams are at the forefront of their sound. Twisting and grinding thru odd-time meters, devilish blast beats, and break-neck tempos are the main tools in the bands arsenal. Varying their attack with a shrill and intense live show the band truly captivates and hypnotizes their audience who leave the show with a "bigger pair of balls." Heavily Lovecraftian influenced, the bands songs are are inspired from the unknown, dream psyche, mass murderers, addiction, and all other things DEATH METAL.
