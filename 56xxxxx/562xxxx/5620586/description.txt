These days there are few things I find bring peace to this paranoid,pensive & pissed off mind of mine. Music is a window into so much more than most understand and listening to it or writing it can tranquilize or open wide the soul & mind. I found that creative influences and obsessive dedication to music were what i needed to make original music & create my own personal sound. DaLvaL(pronouced Doll-Voll) is a project combining audio & visual arts of myself & others to create an original and different sound that may not be for everyone,or may be an acquired taste,but is nothing if not underrated. DaLvaL was started in 2009 by MikeJ. & ArtV. releasing DaLvaLsTeiN here on PirateBay.
