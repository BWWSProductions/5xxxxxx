Hello. I am the writer / director / cinematographer / editor / producer of this underground independent feature-length comedy "WE HEART ELIE". 

GENRE: Comedy  

LENGTH: 77min  

FILE: this is a quicktime .mov file compressed with h.264 to maintain its HD quality. the file is about 4GB.  


I made this film back in 2008 when i was 19 years old, and look back on it as one of the experiences that taught me the most about filmmaking. Me and the actors shot this film all around the SF Bay Area (mainly in Redwood City, San Mateo, Palo Alto, & San Carlos) over the course of about 6 months and I rented a theater at The Aquarius Theater in Palo Alto to premiere it to a packed theater as a midnight show on December 5th 2008.  

This is my first feature length film, and is shot guerilla style (we have some great stories). I hope you enjoy watching it and heres a brief synopsis of what you're getting yourself into:  

Laurence, a senior in high school, is given a simple task from his mom: deliver a "Get Well Soon" Cake to his sick grandma. After throwing the cake in his 1970 VW van's built-in fridge he sets out on his journey but is quickly distracted by his friends. His day begins to spiral into a crazy adventure with his good friends, but will he manage to still deliver the cake in one piece?
