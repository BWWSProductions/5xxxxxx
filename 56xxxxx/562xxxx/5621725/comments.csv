,R2223,2010-06-12T05:53Z,"Thanks for this and the South Africa v Mexico torrent, I have 2 questions...

1. Are you going to upload all the games (the ones shown on BBC ITV?)

2. Why is this one in MKV format and the first was AVI? It makes it far more difficult to use on a DVD's USB port (DIVX Playback).

3. Oh and if you could include the half time and full time analysis for the games (particularly England's matches) it would be great!

Thanks"
