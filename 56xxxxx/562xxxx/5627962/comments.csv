,IcIrIs,2010-06-15T02:13Z,"This is the demo, the full version has not been released yet. There was a glitch on steam and it was released a little early."
,motley666,2010-06-15T02:40Z,Full game will be more than 1.37 gb and it's too soon for a cracked game yet. Game is out at the end of month.

Your post sounds like an answer to someone that says that this is fake or the full game, LOL"

,sixpackmark,2010-06-16T16:41Z,"Audio isn't working here but the gameplay is fine, anyone have the fix for this? tY"
[T],Knaster,2010-06-16T18:51Z,sixpackmark update your drivers for noone else has problems.
,mibrons,2010-06-16T19:08Z,"It's not actually horrible game, it really isn't any superb at all, need fine tuning in many areas, but surprisinly good...

AI would need lots of improvement and teamwork, they all pretty much act as their own.
Although CI claimed that they cannot see throught foliage, they pretty much can.
Level design so far is pretty much 6.5, not so good but playable for one time.
30? is in my opinion too much for this, 10? would be suitable."
,mibrons,2010-06-16T19:09Z,"30euros is too much I meant, TPB doesn't recocnize euro symbol."
,jmerola11,2010-06-17T02:19Z,"help:

The program can't start because d3dx9_39.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."
,mibrons,2010-06-17T17:40Z,"Hey, do not try to google .dlls, that is really high risk thing.
Just download newest DirectX from Microsoft site and install.
Searching for .dlls will cause problems, they might be serious viruses and probably outdated.

,mibrons,2010-06-17T17:57Z,"By the way, here are some 1920x1080 screenshots(not resized, not compressed, unmodified) I took, you can judge the graphics yourself, but I'm not impressed even though they used Chrome Engine 4...
The water shader is ridiculious, it actually takes the first person view render and disorts it, I think they couldn't figure out that they have to use different camera for the water shader to replicate reflection.
(Doesn't show in these screenshots! In screenshots it actually looks okay)

,jmerola11,2010-06-17T22:13Z,I downloaded the directx and that fixed the pop up but it doesnt go past a black screen.
,Exixo911,2010-06-18T02:01Z,"hey guys, bit of a problem:
ater setup finishes I get the following error message...

Unable to execute file:
C:\Users\User\Downloads\Sniper_Ghost_Warrior_demo_Ali213.net\DiectX\.DXsetup.exe

CreateProcess failed; code 267
The directory name is invalid.

I know most games normally come with directx, but i have it already.
the problem happens when i try to play, in compatability mode, as administrator or just normally its just a black screen and it's not responding :/

help anyone? thanks"

[T],Knaster,2010-06-21T12:46Z,ATI cards pretty much sucks and it sounds like that is what you have.

,zetpunt,2010-06-23T14:19Z,"The game is quite nice, the sniper and stealth aspects are pretty good.
