Russia during the XIII century was a huge state, much larger
than any other European country. Split by internal conflicts,
and yet standing strong against numerous outer threats, it was
attacked by the infamous Mongol Horde. They came suddenly and
pierced through the country like a blazing arrow. The native
people fought valiantly, led by a fierce warrior and prince,
Prince Alexander Nevsky.
