The debian image file resized to 2000M this will give you room to play with. For those with *nix machines follow the steps in this page ( http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Debian ). Much faster to download 88mb and resize to whatever size you wish (stay under FAT limit I would not go past 3gb) I made this for those with windows machines that can't run the command. Just download and copy to the PRE usb mode and follow the thread at Precentral.
