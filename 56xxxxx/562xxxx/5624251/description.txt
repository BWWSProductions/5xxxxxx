Description

"Don't Forget" is the third and final single (fourth Latin American single overall) released from Demi Lovato's debut album of the same name. It was released March 17, 2009.
Don't Forget is the first studio album of singer-songwriter Demi Lovato. It was released on September 23, 2008 in the United States by Hollywood Records, and it debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200. The album was released in the UK in April 2009 under Fascination Records.
On "In Tune With Demi Lovato", a short, two-part special that aired on the Disney Channel, Lovato had stated that "Don't Forget is one of the songs [on the album] that I relate to the most" and that she loves it because she got to "feel a lot of emotion while recording it". Lovato performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on April 15, 2009. The song is Demi's best-performing song so far from Don't Forget, peaking higher than the two previous singles. "Trainwreck" was supposed to be the third single from the album, but was replaced by "Don't Forget".

Plot

The video featured a more mature Lovato singing in the rain, and was praised by critics. The single's highest position on the Billboard Hot 100 was at #41. "Don't Forget" was the most successful single released by Lovato until it was succeeded by "Here We Go Again" by 26 spots charting at #15.
