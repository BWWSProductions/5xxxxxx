Challenge, Change, Faith is a new documentary, which looks at the Catholic Church in Australia during the one of the most dynamic periods in history. The Second Vatican Council (1962-65) set the framework for Catholicism into the 21st century. Through the personal stories of eminent and ordinary Australians Challenge, Change, Faith explores how the Second Vatican Council changed Catholic life and why.
