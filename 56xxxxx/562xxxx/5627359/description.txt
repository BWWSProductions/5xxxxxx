this isn't Atlas Shrugged busted up into 300 gazillion different files.  Oh, no.  This is Atlas Shrugged busted up into CHAPTERS!!  And yes, it took me forever to get this done.  But I finally did it.

Say what you want about Ayn Rand, She was something completely different.  I admired her after my second reading of Atlas Shrugged.  The first reading I was 12 and just didn't get it.  But here it is, in all it's glory.  I do hope ya'll like what I did and post a few comments, because this is my first upload, and I really want to know if it was worth the effort.

Atlas Shrugged.  By Chapters.  Fits on 2 cd's for MP3 play.  I wish it fit on one, but the quality really went south when I tried to do that.

Be well, and live long.
