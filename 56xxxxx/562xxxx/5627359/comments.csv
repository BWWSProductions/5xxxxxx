,djankobear,2010-06-20T13:52Z,"Nice idea and very generous. 
It seems you are using BitComet to create your torrents. Have a search for BitComet padding files."

,canyengue,2010-10-24T17:28Z,"I was happy to find a light torrent for this audiobook, and I appreciate the effort of the chapters, but unfortunately the sound is pretty poor. Maybe it's because it is 24 kbps bitrate (?).
Thanks anyway."
