FLV Player's exceedingly simple controls allow you to navigate backward and forward through videos and play them in a loop. You
can also adjust the volume, mute it, and adjust the size of the player. The Settings menu provides some basic control over program behavior, such as opening a new player window when double-clicking on an FLV file and remembering previous settings!!
