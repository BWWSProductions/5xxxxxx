common'people put that upload limit a bit higher"
,Duce11,2010-12-17T15:51Z,"I put up a full HD torrent of this, should be done uploading in the next few hours for the first set of seeders. Bad news is, this show is getting canceled. Only 10 more episodes to finish out season 2."
,ajbutch123,2011-04-07T06:21Z,"I LOVE this show! not as good as SG1 or Atlantis, but still worth the watch

I will seed at full for 3 weeks then cut the speed back a little...."
,mayont,2011-05-03T01:01Z,Great torrent. Finished watching Atlantis not too long ago. This spinoff looks promising. Hope Eli gets the girl eventually...
,mikepass1949,2011-09-01T17:35Z,"What a real DWEB. This ass uploaded this with comercials.  He wasted all my time downloading and I have to download it again.  My advice, forget this jerkoff and get from Toilet_sniffer.  This DWEB SUCKS monkeys."

@ mikepass1949
- You're getting this torrent for free, the description tells you that it's source is TV so stop complaining.
- You're the leeching dweb who hasn't uploaded a single torrent. Shut the fuck up kiddy

@ doomhammer47
- Go download subs then you fucking idiot.

@ koycer
- No Problem ;)"
,half-wit,2012-01-25T16:37Z,"I downloaded it i full what plays is of lovely quality but one or more of the seeders must have a heavily corrupted version, became unwatchable and indeed unfixable. 
A pity considering the hard work YourGreatestMember put in to get it for us."
[T],YourGreatestMember,2012-01-29T16:57Z,"@ half-wit
- If you have corrupt episodes it's your end what is creating them (antivirus, firewall... etc), the bittorrent protocol prevents corruption. 
- Try downloading VLC Player & playing them in that, I'm 99.9% sure it will work fine."
