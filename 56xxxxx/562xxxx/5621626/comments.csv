I though there was something uniquely Dr. Demento-ish and more specifically Zappa-ish about this.

Zappa's work had quite a range to it; this illustrated a few components of that but is still only a small piece."
,Imperator42,2010-06-26T23:37Z,"Especially in retrospect, Zappa does seem like the type of musician who would give The Beatles ironic treatment.
(I myself had thought of something kinda  similar with a particular Beatles-related remix/mashup idea)"

,Imperator42,2011-02-09T07:18Z,"Yeah, Zappa was one of those classic artists who didn't get the respect he deserved. 
So, angst at the mainstream (even really good mainstream like The Beatles) is somewhat understandable."
