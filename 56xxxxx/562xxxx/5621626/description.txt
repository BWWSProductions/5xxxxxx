Titled the "Texas Motel Medley", this is a series of Beatles parodies that Frank Zappa played live during his 1988 tour. They were intended to mock the Jimmy Swaggart sex scandal. As such, Zappa's lyrics contain some sexual language.

I happened to find and upload a version labeled as being from the March 17th Binghamton show, so the album is labeled "1988.03.17 - Binghamton"

Artist: "Frank Zappa"
Date: "1988"
Genre: "Comedy Rock"

Medley of:
Norwegian Jim (Norwegian Wood parody)
Louisiana Hooker With Herpes (Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds parody)
Texas Motel (Strawberry Fields Forever parody)

The instrumental portion seems relatively unaltered from the originals

Composer: "John Lennon; Paul McCartney; Frank Zappa"
