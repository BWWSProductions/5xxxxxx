It terrified you in Christmas 1978 and now...it's back!

Anyone who saw this had nightmares for years.

You finally have a chance to watch it again - if you dare.

This the legendary BBC production of Pinocchio, written by Alec Drysdale and produced and directed by the late, great Doctor Who producer Barry Letts.

It was sourced from the ultra-rare (movie edit) BBC video from 1985. A copy was finally found by a crack team of Doctor Who fans, co-ordinated via CB radio from their official secret base in Antarctica.
