,onemandynasty,2010-08-02T09:51Z,"why do I get this message that this version of norton is not compatible to the current version of windows, Im using windows seven ultimate build 7600"
,ianj302,2010-08-14T04:12Z,If you want to continue to use the norton Antivirus until the new suite comes out I suggest disabling the Live updates Go to settings Antivirus and the Antivirus and Updates submenu then click where it says Automatic Live Updates Otherwise you will have to use the removal tool every time your computer wants to be a bitch and cop an attitude

Thanx abhi6.."
,nitcharoo,2010-09-16T16:01Z,"to abhi6

I installed Norton 360 using your trial reset 2.9.6 included. All works fine! Subscription valid for 180 days. 
QUESTION: What happens after the 180 day subscription expires? Will I be able to use your trial reset 2.9.6 again or will I have to uninstall and re-install Norton 360?

Thanks!"

,Germanator7707,2011-03-12T02:55Z,downloaded it scanned it and no problems but my cousins computer was messed up and im taking the blame for this
,Germanator7707,2011-03-27T21:20Z,"oh nvm about my last comment.
according to my uncle who fixed it, he said the his computer didn't meet its requirements"
,Mikeman2000,2011-08-11T09:17Z,"Thanks. I came here when AVG Free started having problems with updating on my system. While I usually wouldn't trust torrents with antivirus and such, this looks legitimate. I'll give it a DL and seed for a coupla months."
,steffon1,2012-05-28T21:47Z,when my subscription is nearing expiration will it automatically ask me to reset my subscription or do i have to go manually do it if so how to i manually reset my subscription when its necessary.
