On this Coast to Coast AM from July 6th of 1997 Art Bell hosts a show involving a Linda Moulten Howe investigation, where she interviews Col. Corso and William Burnes regarding a position Col. Corso held involving overseeing the research and reproduction of alien technology recovered from Roswell and other sites.

Corso also talks about a moon base, in fact if you listen he says there is a photo of it in a moon lander pic, however Linda and William seem to cover up this comment. It may have been indeed a mistake, but it sounded fishy to me as Corso stated it very clearly.
