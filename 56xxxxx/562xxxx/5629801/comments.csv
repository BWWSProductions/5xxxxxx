[V],twentyforty,2010-06-16T07:52Z,"@masseur: It has nothing to do with my encode. It is 1.4 GIGA WBZ's crap.

QUOTE
"" I recommend 
      and have used one system for years - CoreCodec for H264 (""Deblocking"" set to
      ""Standard"") and part of DivX7 for AAC. 
      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p 
      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic cards processors (GPU)
      decode H264 using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreCodec 
      (I have an ATI card, just in case you were wondering).

      Problems one can have may come from either one of the following 
      and/or a combination of these ? the playback system itself, a 
      malfunctioning device or lack of knowledge. 

      For instance, any so called ""jerky"" playback of ""system-heavy"" 720p comes
      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded 
      computer. Use of ddshow filters and ""codecs"" is suicidal. This is not 
      Russian 720p Matroska format (""official"" 720p) and completely different 
      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extent
      ""hide"" bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, 
      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as 
      much as possible.

      Any 'blurriness' of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. 
      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,
      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.
      Any ?blockiness? comes from 'system-too-slow' situation, when decoding 
      engine of ones device become over-capacitated and cannot process all frames 
      as it supposed to.
      On ""I have no video"" and ""I have no sound"" I don't waste my time as this 
      is generally a complete lack of knowledge and/or understanding. 
      RTFM is the best response I can give."""
