Anyone?"
,bridog80,2010-06-21T02:51Z,"@gdtymze: What happened to you is you installed an update that ""breaks"" the activation. Go into installed updates and look for KB971033. Uninstall that and and hide it when it comes up again. Then get this tool: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5478839/Seven_Loader_7_Remove_Wat_2.2.5____GOD_Mode_Infos.rar

This goes for any installed version of Windows 7."
,joona115,2010-06-27T14:40Z,This works perfect... Is it safe to turn updates on with this version or should i do something first to make updates safe?

,daredevil95,2010-07-30T14:21Z,"Hey guys, what do i do when this comes up during setup?

 You can?t upgrade 64-bit Windows to a 32-bit version of Windows. To upgrade, obtain a 64-bit version of the installation disc, or go online to see how to install Windows 7 and keep your files and settings."
,bridog80,2010-10-05T22:44Z,"@daredevil95: both 32bit & 64bit versions are included on the disc. Pick the correct version during setup.

Also, it's best to save your personal files and do a clean install. IE let it format your drive."
,abhay123,2011-02-24T10:38Z,can i do updates with this os?
,bridog80,2011-08-30T05:58Z,"Wow, people still seeding this. Yes updates work fine still. But best bet is by now there are ones out there with SP1 included."
