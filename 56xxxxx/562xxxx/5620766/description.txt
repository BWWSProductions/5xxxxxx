Outline:

In December of 1969, four months after Woodstock, the Rolling Stones and
Jefferson Airplane gave a free concert in Northern California, east of Oakland
at Altamont Speedway.

About 300,000 people came, and the organizers put Hell's Angels in charge of
security around the stage. Armed with pool cues and knives, Angels spent the
concert beating up spectators, killing at least one.

The film intercuts performances, violence, Grace Slick and Mick Jagger's
attempts to cool things down, close-ups of young listeners (dancing, drugged,
or suffering Angel shock), and a look at the Stones later as they watch concert
footage and reflect on what happened.

The BBC4 logo is visible throughout, and the BBC converted it to 25 fps
(with frame blending, so the extra frames cannot easily be removed.)
