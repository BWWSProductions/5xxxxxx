The Doctor and Wilfred escape from the Master with the help of the Vinvocci,
taking refuge on their orbiting ship. Through flashbacks the Time Lord
President has been shown to have engineered events, first by placing the
sound of drums in the Master's head as a young child, such that when
amplified by the billions of clones, would act as a signal to the Master in the
present. The President has also sent a Whitepoint star diamond to Earth that
can boost the signal and lock onto its source. Through these, the Time Lords
are able to create a link to the Master to let them escape from the Time Lock
placed on the Time War..
