This contains symphonies by Anton Bruckner (1824-1896) from my personal collection. This isn't another retarded classical top 100 mozart collection, this is real repertoire.

I have included a complete cycle of Bruckner's symphonies conducted by Eugen Jochum. I also included the 9th conducted by Giulini, a terrific performance. Not included are symphonies "0" and "00", which are little more than historical interest and can be found on the Naxos label.

Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.





**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"



If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
