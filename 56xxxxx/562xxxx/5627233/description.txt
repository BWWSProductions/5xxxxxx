Sometimes one creates a dynamic impression by saying something, and sometimes one creates a significant impression by remaining silent.

My Sleeping Karma combines the organic aspect of psychedelic groove rock with emotional shades of aphasian landscapes. That was the inTention of the debut album and it still remains. Guitar, bass and drums in love with a soundboard. My Sleeping Karma's album "Satya" released september 20th on Elektrohasch Records. And time is the major keyword in the context of "Satya". The conditioned mind is always moving between the past and future, and this movement activity creates the illusion of time. Use your illusion and you will discover the voice within. My Sleeping Karma is enlightment.

Now is the time to take it to the next level.<...> (http://www.mysleepingkarma.com/index.php/about.html)
