Hey! I'm back with another release of V-Ray!

This is the LATEST and PROPER version, no watermarks, no long rendering times, no f*cked up AA - everything works just fine!

So, this is V-Ray 1.5 SP5 x64 for 3DS Max 2011.



Installation:


1.Run installer (vray_adv_150SP5_max2011_x64.exe)


2.During installation when prompted choose:

-workstation full
-local license on machine
-don't install WIBU keys


3.Once installation is complete copy "vray2011.dll" to your 3ds max install folder

(..Program Files - Autodesk - 3ds max 2011) and copy "vrender2011.dlr" (located in plugins folder)

to your 3ds max plugins folder (..Program Files - Autodesk - 3ds max 2011 - plugins) replacing the originals


4.Enjoy!



Have fun, don't forget to seed! :D



Note:

V-Ray RT 2010 WILL NOT work with this release of V-Ray because they use different versions of ".dll" files.
