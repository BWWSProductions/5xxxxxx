Since there wasn't a NTSC version floating in the Bay yet...

(Short Summary taken from greendayrockband.com)

Green Day: Rock Bandâ„¢ allows players to step onto the stage and into the shoes of Green Day, the multi-platinum, GrammyÂ® Award-winning band that jump-started the punk-pop revival and has continued to pave the way for American rock music into the 21st century. Taking on the likenesses of Green Day members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and TrÃ© Cool, players progress through the story and history of Green Day, gaining access into the band's media vault, where they can unlock more than 100 collectible images, and more than 40 minutes of rare and unreleased video from interviews, outtakes and performances.

I originally downloaded this from http://www.heroturko.org/games/wii/213249-green-day-rock-band-usa-wii-procision-ntsc-usother2010.html

It was split into 91 pieces, and then split into 18 bigger pieces, and that made it a hassle.

Speaking of burning:

1. Open up your favorite ISO burner (PowerISO or imageburn are nice free ones)
2. Get a high quality 4.7GB DVD-R (I use Philips)
3. Burn it as slow as you can (4x is ideal)
4. Enjoy.

CAUTION!  THIS GAME WILL UPDATE YOUR WII TO SYSTEM MENU 4.2U, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT DELETE YOUR HOMEBREW CHANNEL, and STUB YOUR CUSTOM IOSes.  Use Dop-Mii to safely update your Wii (like you really need system menu 4.2U...) or use Wii Start Patch to disable disk updates. (wii start patch: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/StartPatch )

Also a thing to note, your Green Day RB2 DLC may not work on this game.  It all depends on what cIOS version your using.  I use cIOSCorp 3.6, and DLC will not work for this game.
