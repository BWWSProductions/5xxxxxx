Please explain your problem.  People here might be able to help you."

The files were successfully extracted using 7-zip 9.12 Beta.  Your problem might be your extractor.  Are you using WinRAR?  Please try 7-zip.

,berebere619,2010-08-03T15:58Z,how come my instrument arent working for the game? Is it because im using neogamma?
,lunchdog,2010-10-14T01:53Z,"I recently changed to neogamma as well.
For neogamma, if you want USB instruments to work (RB strat, drums, and microphone), you need to look for RAWKSD patcher.  What it does is it patches your IOS36, so instruments are able to be played.
you can find it here:

If you wish to upload this torrent to other sites/trackers, please do so! The more the better!"
