,kbowk2,2010-12-14T03:34Z,What a classic film.  I hope this is the R18+ version.  I remember when it came out on video and I got mum to hire me out the R version instead of the M version.  I've seen the M version on TV and has many bits cut out because every 2nd word is swearing.  Really ruined the film.
