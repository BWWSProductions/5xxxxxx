           Nixau (THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY) is up for another crazy         
           adventure, this time in Hong Kong. When he accidentally        
           finds himself stuck in a TV executive's luggage and in an      
           unfamiliar city, the usual hilarious antics ensue. But         
           Nixau isn't just lost, he's on a mission to free a bamboo      
           bird from his signature bottle of Coke that he wears           
           around his neck. But can he survive in a world that makes      
           no sense, and in a culture that's even more confusing? An      
           all-star cast of Hong Kong actors accompany the cult star      
           as he bumbles his way through the big city.
