Either that or they are just fucking idiots who need to believe someone is in charge because otherwise they would shit their pants."

,moonrunner99,2010-06-17T01:58Z,"snark I agree, but I also think it has to do with the need of those who feel powerless to see themselves as heroes. By revealing to others this evil plot, the people who post these things feel like they are making a difference, when in fact they are doing nothing but confusing the issues with worthless speculation. They make things worse by spreading their fear and paranoia, so people have to spend time and energy refuting their idiotic claims. Even when they have been proven conclusively wrong, they refuse to believe the evidence, and instead insist the evidence is made up. "
