Civil Action Number 76-H-667
This is William R. Pabst. My address is 1434 West Alabama Street, Houston, Texas, 77006.
My telephone number is area code 713 521-9896. This is my 1979 updated report on the
concentration camp program of the Department of Defense of the United States.

On April 20, 1976, after a rapid and thorough investigation, I filed suit on behalf of the
People of the United States against various personages that had a key part in a conspiratorial
program to do away with the United States as we know it. This is a progress report to you,
the plaintiffs, the People of the United States. The civil action number is 76-H-667. It is
entitled, "Complaint Against the Concentration Camp Program of the Dept. of Defense". It
was filed in the U.S. District Court for the southern district of Texas, Houston division. The
judge responsible for the case was Judge Carl Beau (phonetic spelling).
