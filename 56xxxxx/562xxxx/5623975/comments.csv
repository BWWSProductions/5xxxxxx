[V],globeplus,2010-06-13T02:50Z,"This comment just to say that the story of this resident evil game was concepted before the mansion story in the resident evil 1 and that´s why is resident evil zero .

Happy gaming everyone !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-13T04:29Z,"To AZkiller7 : i didn´t getted when the read the comment but i know that you have a nice work in emulator files , your files are recomendable too the new users of the emulator , i used a different version because for forgotten sands i need to adaptate a obrigatory patch for the game don´t get stucked at the menus but certainly that is not usual stuff and for games that don´t need this type of specifitys certainly your emulator files are fine .
My files generally speaking are positive and adequated to like to play the wii games in the emulator because you really only spend the real necessary space that is needed to the game and not the 4.37 gb, i don´t trim to get the sizes on the files why ? , because with that the saves are not possible , what i do is a correct analysis of the game , obeservating what can possible be worked without changing a thing in the gameplay then i proceed after the work with the substitute files and finally creating a new iso , the wii videos , some of them are possible to work but i have to say that is really hard work if you excuse the expression to do the work , first you need to find the correct video configurations in picture and sound and then use a couple of programs and a bat to get a new video and this work for every single video , what i mean is that is an easy task but if it is done correctly it is ok .
I want to finish just for saying that this files are really adequated to the emulator but in 10 minutes you can make the decompression and probably burn without problems to play in real wii console .
Thank you AZkiller7 for your emulator files and you certainly welcome to get or talk about my adequated prepared isos to the emulator beside the fact that can be used in a reall wii .
Thank you all and happy gaming !!!!"

[V],globeplus,2010-06-13T05:58Z,"If you already played any of the first Resident Evils games : 1 , 2 , 3 nemesis or code veronica , this one is absolute the same nice style , concepted for a time before the story at the mansion in the resident evil 1 , this resident 0 is imperdible to any fan of this series of games . 
IF YOU LIKE THE RESIDENT EVIL GAMES YOU MUST PLAY THIS ONE , ABSOLUTLY RECOMENDABLE !!!

Happy gaming !!!"
,air_misuzu,2010-06-13T06:58Z,Thanks alot GLOBE!! Can't believe now i can play this exclusive wii game ON MY PC!!!
[V],globeplus,2010-06-13T08:18Z,"To air_misuzu : you must be a witcher because you simply read my mind that was what i tought when i find out that was possible to play this nice resident evil game , wii exclusive in the pc , so i downloaded then taked a look , maked the correct work to occupy less space as possible and to be more fast as possible to all the users and then i upload , i started playing already , an hour or something , if you remember all that nice adrenaline that you get when you play any of the other first resident evil games in ths one , is the same thing and with a new feature with a partner exchange to do the necessary tasks that are needed to keep going on the gameplay , just all the expected ambient that you normal get in a resident evil game .

Happy gaming !!!"

Is it possible to play with a friend on a coop game like super mario galaxy 2?"
,anand1303,2010-06-13T16:52Z,"Globe and other please help...
I can only play in full screen. Alt+enter keeps game running but doesn't show anything, only in fullscreen shows. Please help...

Also I am truing to play No More Heroes with Dolphin and getting too much lagging. Any idea how to reduce it??... Thanks"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-13T23:19Z,"To jmftw : i don´t know but probably not , resident evil zero is a single player mode .
game .
To anand1303 : i don´t understand your problem because if you want you in the emulator a nice 640x480 window resolution inicially then in a very pratical way you can click in the fullscreen button in the emulator menu to get the fullscreen , if you want to get to the window mode you need to press 2 times the esc key , just that , in the first the window mode is showed and in the second you get the game running , want fullscreen again just press the fullscreen button in the emulator menu and so on , so to change from window mode to fullscreen is pratical , i don´t know if all the versions are like that to get the window mode after 2 times pressing the esc button but i really don´t understand your difficulty because you have confioguration options inside the emulator to choose the resolution or fullscreen , i think you pay a little more attention you get the window mode , in last case get another versions of the emulator because the normal thing is to change easily from window mode and fullscreen , in the window mode you can inclusive resize the screen immediatly using your cursor at the borders of screen to the size you want , the guys that maded this emulator really did a wonderful work and they still improving anyway with new versions with small corrections for some situations and that is normal in emulators . A little more attention , alittle more pratic from you with the emulator , maybe trying new emulator versions and you will be ok .
To catteyezz : not possible because playstation 3 and the xbox 360 don´t have emulators on the pc to play commercial games and no perspective in that possibility too , i can upload files from other games systems but they must have a nice gameplay in the pc with a nice emulator help and xbox360 or ps3 are not the case ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-13T23:30Z,"Well , i am a kind of disappointed with the way of the number of seeds for this nice resident evil is beeing progress , for the number of users that already getted the file certainly disappointing .
Quick note : i didn´t made it anything on the cutcenes that look like the mouth movement not coordinated with the english voices , well i didn´t worked that ones what i think that can be : i think can be the mouth movement to the japanese words then someone changed the real voices from japanese to english then it is ok and you don´t miss a thing but the coordination from the carachters can look a little bit strange but that´s all , the real videos that are a different section of the wii videos for this game , i worked a little bit and that ones are absolutly perfect looking great without any special note .

Happy gaming !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-14T01:42Z,"close 700 mb off with everything normal and what a resident evil game and even with this carachteristics i still disappointed with the help , remember after a few games start to be a few giga less in the hard disk space with files like this !!!


Happy gaming !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-14T03:14Z,"This comment is just to make a little correction : the change between fullscreen and window mode can be a little problematic , i got in in some ocasions the change fine during the gameplay but in other when you try to make the change the user can get a black screen but on e thing is for shore you can define inicially what you want the window mode or the fullscreen and then is really no problem , just the change of the view mode can be a little complicated but what is choosed inicially at the graphics configurations of the emulator will be ok inside the game .
While writing the comment i find out what make the difference on that : is the graphics plugin , if it is in direct3d this little complication can happen between changing modes but in openGL the change between the window mode and fullscreen works perfectly just with the help of the esc key pressed twice to change from fullscreen to window mode and then just click in the fullscreen button at the emulator to get back the fullscreen , the trick to be more easy this change of the view is use the openGL and not the direct3D plugin ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-14T10:57Z,"i recommend the azkiller7 dolphin 5647 revision to play the games in the emulator , choose 32 or 64 bits depending in your machine , beside the prince of persia - forgotten sands  obrigatory patch , all the other games are ok in this azkiller7 emulator , on the refered game a patch with the text file and a dll are required to play the game or the game get stucked at the menu .

TO EVERYONE THAT HAVE THE FORGOTTEN SANDS GAME , APPLY THIS PATCH TO PLAY IN THE AZKILLER7 EMULATOR (182 KB) :

New version of Azkiller has done the trick."
,anand86,2010-06-14T22:35Z,"Unfortunately I have deleted my first Dolphin folder and Save Games are gone. For future safety , where does it saves game? Thanks."
,anand86,2010-06-14T22:36Z,"and yes, I am anand1303. Couldn't comment here because of database error on TPB. Had to do new account to talk to you."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-17T04:41Z,"To anand86 : it is not a easy thing but with the correct attentio9n you understand the saves :

1 - they are located at user\wii\title\00010000 inside the emulator folder

2 - you don´t see the name of the games on the saves !!! they have a symbolic number in the folder , to know what is the game of the folder number , open the folder number then click in the data folder and think for yourself what can be between the saves that you already have to the games that you already played , the game correspondent to the folder number that you open 

Generically if you copy the user\wii\title\00010000 folder to a new emulator you get all the saves that you have before in the new emulator version .

Happy gaming !!!"

I was very happy to play this,
I was playing another version (RES 0 GC rare),
with minimum errors,
and after the train crash,when I get into the mansion,the game crashes ... :/ 
(is this a bug or sth ??)
Has anyone got the same problem ?
I searched into forums,
tried different versions of dolphin,
experimented with graphic settings ....but with no success.I hope this one works ... (sigh)
