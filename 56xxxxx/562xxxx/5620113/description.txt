A taut reinvention of vampire lore, "Shadowland" opens in modern day North America, where construction workers uncover an old stone cross and what appears to be a decayed wooden stake. They remove the stake from the ground, allowing Laura (Caitlin McIntosh), a slumbering vampire, to revive and rise from her temporary grave. Beaten and weak, Laura is unable to speak, remember who she is, or even the fact that she is a vampire! As Laura attempts to make sense of the strange new world around her, she begins to remember not only an idyllic human life in 1897 but the handsome Lazarus (Carlos Antonio Leon), a mysterious lover who may not have had her best interests in mind. Soon Julian (Jason Contini), a world-weary vampire hunter begins tracking Laura, but as he closes in for the kill he learns that things are not what they seem. An ambitious indie feature created entirely with St. Louis cast and crew, "Shadowland" relies on character, tension, and a series of reveals to tell the tragic story of an anti-heroine.
