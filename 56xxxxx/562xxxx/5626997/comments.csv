[V],polifem2009,2010-06-19T13:25Z,"you're right. it's something very strange, kind of one second attack of the crimson asurance on the main feature. whoever comes with an explanation for this will earn a fat bonus."
,Kroimpa,2010-06-19T15:20Z,"Its the dude bout the zatoichi movies (#21-26) When i look it has 0 seeds left, and im really trying to get the DVD's and not the rips. If u know how to post on usenet, could u do that?"

don't be so hasty coming back. stay one or two more days.

@famemon78
well, who d'you think seeded it? 2-3 guys downloaded it and then they went away. let me know what your IP is 'cause I can't know when you're through with it, and I'll simply ban all the other leechers, if this is the way they see things. But, you'll have to have a little patience. Don't tell you're disperate for all of these flicks..."
,famemon78,2010-06-22T18:25Z,oh god now there are no seeds for Vengeance is Mine :-(.. its like the seeders are deliberately trying to toy with me :-(.. lol polifem2009 i am desperate for all these flicks well ANY criterion DVD-R's are absolute gold and no one except u are offering ALL of them in one place u ABSOLUTELY rock brother.. btw my ip is 10.0.0.40.. Thanks again for helping with the reseeding

,asc11,2010-08-20T13:21Z,"Etsuraku (Pleasures of the Flesh)

The downfall of a man, 3 April 2009
Author: GrandeMarguerite from Lille, France

What looks first like a thriller (after the murder of a man who raped one of his students, a young teacher finds himself blackmailed into hiding a huge some of money) turns into an exploration of greed and sexual exploitation by one of the less politically correct Japanese directors, Nagisa Oshima, as the hero succumbs to his baser impulses and decides to spend the money on indulging his every (often sensual) impulse - planning to commit suicide when the cash runs out. ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" sees Oshima first embrace of the themes of sexuality, sadism and obsession that characterize his later works. I see ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" as the turning point in Oshima's career, a cross between his early films, like ""The Sun's Burial"" or ""A Cruel Story of Youth"" with young criminals who exploit each other for money and enact transgressive fantasies, or ""Night and Fog in Japan"" with its political plot, and later films, like the famous ""Realm of the Senses"", and their sadomasochist tales of sex and death. Oshima is obviously already at work pushing the limits of what can be shown on screen and what can be said on the power of sex and money, on the perversion of love and capitalism. It is one of the most pessimistic works from the director. Everything is corrupt : the young girl the hero falls for (and kills for) proves to be not so innocent in the end, sex (which is a way to humiliate people), love (which only leads to frustration and guilt), money (a delusion), society (dominating and repressive). As ""Pleasures of the Flesh"" seems to embody most of Oshima's favorite themes, I would recommend it, but don't expect a ""likeable"" film with ""likeable"" characters. But after all, this is all too typical of Oshima's manner ! Has he ever filmed romantic stories and sweet people ?"
