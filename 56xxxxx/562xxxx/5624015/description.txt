Subtle portrait of life in an unfashionable North London parish.

Barbara Pym had trouble getting this fine novel published. The
early 1960s was a difficult time for authors who took the long
view through honest examination of society as they had found it
to be, rather than how publishers wanted it described.

called her 'the century's most underrated novelist', and Betjemen
wrote reviews applauding her 'unique talent'. The publishers called,
and she was a great success. But she died soon after - just 64.
