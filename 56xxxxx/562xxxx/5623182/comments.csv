Go to ""Settings"", under ""Options"" select ""Notifications"".
Click on ""Settings"" on the right of ""Enable Events Notifications"".
Go under ""Important Notifications"".
Uncheck ""License Validity . . .""

@kzrockz
Turn Norton's ""Insight Protection"", ""Antivirus"", ""Antispyware"", ""SONAR Protection"".
Restore the file.
Go to Norton ""Settings"".
Under ""Computer Settings"", look for ""Exclusions"", click ""Configure"" on the right of ""Scan Exclusions"".
Add your file directory (browse it), on both Scan and Real Time exclusions."

,Al145,2010-06-28T17:28Z,@RobbingHood you said that is no viruses here but http://www.virustotal.com/pl/analisis/c90839903d2c50136d0a66153eef4e98ebed58dfbc258d4b316c6bceda792e51-1276799871 say is a lot of them inside and http://virusscan.jotti.org/pl/scanresult/7df8522e22bdf47ceab839e28f20a36910646e8c/e5245c1be22ddd6d04869651c2a9214861d3c80e here too. How you explain this ?
,sariroti,2010-06-29T20:22Z,"@Al145

Trust ur own antivirus.
What antivirus software u have on ur computer? Then just trust the one you have.

It might be false positive and it might be not.
I personally trust BitDefender, Kaspersky, and Norton.
BitDefender ==> is well-known as bad with cracks and keygen.
Kasperksy ==> This is a crack for their product, of course it will flag this crack...

This guy has Green Skull on his name = VIP = trusted (in general, by MOST members, not all).

For example, you might not trust him and that's why u posted the scan results. But other people do trust him.

To sum up, this is free.
Free things are not perfect.
Want something perfect? Take out ur wallet and buy the product.
That's all.
Hope u make the right decision."

I you can explain what's the use of eating while some later we shit it out again, then I'll explain about false positives."
,dashivasss,2010-07-10T00:10Z,that\'s funny ; )
,knkknk,2010-07-23T17:20Z,does it work with the latest version of kaspersky ? 
[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-31T09:44Z,11.0.1.400 was build only against this crack. So update only the virus signatures of the previous Kaspersky version till there's a new trial resetter.
,Stackisan,2010-08-02T09:30Z,Love your work RobbingHood. Great upload as always. You are the stuff legends are made of!
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-06T00:26Z,"@Stackisan 

Thnx m8, and enjoy my torrents and TPB. :)"
,IanPHilippines,2010-08-18T10:17Z,"All threats on the Main Executable are ""False Positives"" because Kaspersky and Other AVs just want people to purchase their License and this is to scare you from downloading the Trial Reset...
As stated in Kaspersky's News Section:

""Use of Third-Party Software with Kaspersky Products are Prohibited  ~Kaspersky Labs""

How Scary... Right?

,IanPHilippines,2010-08-18T10:19Z,BTW: Another RobbingHood Original! Good Job! Had no Problems what so ever.

,cdmihai,2010-09-08T13:00Z,"Tested with KIS 11.0.0.232 and works fine.
The only problem is that it updates to the newer version which cannot be reset.

So my question is, how do you update only the virus definitions and not the software modules?"
,NNnoname,2010-12-29T03:58Z,"oh no!..not work for my KIS 2011, its the newer version."
,akshayjauhar,2011-03-01T13:36Z,I m not able to reset the code on KIS 11.0.2.556. PLz make a new resetter
