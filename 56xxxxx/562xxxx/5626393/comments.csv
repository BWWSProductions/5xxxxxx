,kanakoib2,2010-06-14T17:49Z,"That Yvette, the one that is supposed to be from Estonia. Thats bullshit. When she says hi, then she sais it russian or something... Yvette isnt even an Estonian name."
,Duffy23,2010-06-14T19:03Z,"Download ran at a little over 1MB download speed the entire time. My internet is pretty terrible and I picked up some fantastic speed. Took a couple hours to download. The kids who complain that this isn't working should probably change from Dial Up to something with a little more kick. 

I checked the quality to ensure that it's a good download and yes it is. Flawless from what I checked out. I haven't watched the episode yet however. "

,vinay146,2010-06-15T09:34Z,Download it.
,rarcatz,2010-06-15T10:24Z,"@ phosphor - i know!  how about those days *before* bittorrent (ancient times, i know) when you actually had to record stuff on a ""video tape"" or find someone else who had HBO, and rush over to watch it because there was no TIVO or any other recording device?

i've been seeding this all day long, and it was great for me, downloaded in about 10 minutes.  fantastic quality.  thanks eztv!"
,computron,2010-06-16T06:23Z,eztv

,max2562,2010-06-17T00:19Z,"@browndewd
I think you must have hit your head or something... 2000KB/s is unreal. thats 15.625mpbs and most dsl providers only offer 6mbps. cable can get that high but only on a very good day. that is unless you're using T1 connection or better through your work. and if thats the case I'd hate to be you when they find out what you are doing with THEIR internet. unless its your T1 connection. but then, why would you be paying for such high bandwidth only to complain about free downloading speeds??? 

THANKS EZTV!!! I swear you must be a bot the way you always consistently provide us with great and flawless uploads. NO HUMAN COULD DO THIS!!!  =P

A=10
V=10
M= well, I don't watch many shows and this is one of my absolute faves. and a great return I might add!"
,Xphome,2010-06-17T21:37Z,"@max2562 - 15Mbit/s is far from unreal lol. I had 24Mbit/s before and now i got 100Mbit/s and it's no work connection, it's the one I have at home and it isn't expensive."
,oddmanoutgt,2010-06-17T22:43Z,"This is the WORST piece of SH*T on TV,  and that's counting Jersey Shores.   Anna Paquin should quit the show and do quality stuff."
,Martac,2010-06-19T12:06Z,Finally! Thanks :) 
,jack-the-tab,2010-06-20T04:45Z,FYI-Be careful with some of these episodes I got the a DMCA letter from HBO...
