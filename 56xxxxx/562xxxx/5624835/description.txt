Comments :
A personal aide to U.S. Ambassador in France, James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has an 
enviable life in Paris and a beautiful French girlfriend, but his real passion is his 
side job as a low-level operative for the CIA. All James wants is to become a bona fide 
agent and see some real action. So when he's offered his first senior-level assignment, 
he can't believe his good luck until he meets his new partner, special agent Charlie Wax 
(John Travolta) - a trigger-happy, wisecracking, loose cannon who's been sent to Paris 
to stop a terrorist attack. Wax leads James on a white-knuckle shooting spree through 
the Parisian underworld that has James praying for his desk job. But when James discovers he's 

a target of the same crime ring they're trying to bust, he realizes there's 
no turning back...and that Wax himself might be his only hope for making it through the 
next forty-eight hours alive.
