Plot

The music video was directed by Syndrome and begins with Kesha awaking from a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the picture lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen, walking in on the family having breakfast startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children where she trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy that is walking down the street and looking at her, and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the convertible with the handcuffs hanging from one of her arms as she dangles it in front of the camera. The next scene showcases Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The gold car used in the video belonged to Kesha and the video was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood. The final party scene was shot at one of her friend's house they called "The Drunk Tank".
