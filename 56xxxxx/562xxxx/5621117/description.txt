"American Football was an indie rock band from Urbana, Illinois, United States from 1997 to 2000. The band was formed by guitarist and singer Mike Kinsella (formerly of Capâ€™n Jazz, Joan of Arc, Owls and currently of Owen) and drummer Steve Lamos (formerly of The One Up Downstairs and currently of The Geese), and also included guitar player Steve Holmes.

The band had few live performances and disbanded less than a year after releasing their self-titled album; still, they gained critical acclaim for that album, which merged the plain-spoken, confessional lyrics of emo and the varying time signatures of math rock with a softer musical sensibility."


not "hardcore" at all,but if you're into older indie and emo stuff then you'll love this.
