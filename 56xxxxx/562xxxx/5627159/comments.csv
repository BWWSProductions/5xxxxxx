,mx_phreek,2010-06-14T21:08Z,"Thanks, your freestone race's was your best yet. Looked stunning on 50"" kuro played through my wdtv media player. i couldn't get over how good it looked, maybe it was just that it was in bright sunlight with nice green contrasts. looked mint anyway. Downloding this now. Has anyone else found the 450 race online, i not yet."
,gomes615,2010-06-15T00:30Z,thank you slick! Are you going to upload 450Â´s?

Gonna take a paus now. Well 190gb upload aint so bad =)"
,slicknick610,2010-06-15T05:53Z,I couldn't capture it because my local NBC affiliate did not show the 450 race. Instead they showed infomercials. I was pissed and left 4 angry voicemails.

,SC162,2010-06-15T19:39Z,how on earth can they decide to not show the 450's? especially if they advertise it and pay for the rights to it. maybe they'll show it later on. infomercials......what were they thinking? lol
