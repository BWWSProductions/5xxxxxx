Getting underway from New York harbor, Naval Assault: The Killing Tide

tells the story of the Allied submariner effort against Axis forces across

the key naval warzones of World War II. Players will captain an arsenal

of faithfully recreated U.S. Naval submarines against enemy warship assaults

both above and below the water's surface. In Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,

players will need a healthy dose of stealth and cunning as well as

sharp-shooting deck gun and torpedo skills to successfully destroy the

enemy fleets in the 30 missions throughout the game.
