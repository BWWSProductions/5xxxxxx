,boycameo,2010-06-18T05:47Z,"Very good job tdmk1, but is possible that you use ""iPod 5G support"" in ""HandBrake"" options (tick the option on the major screen), now I have a iPod classic (7th Generation) and I canÂ´t watch your videos in it, always I need to re-encode the videos with HandBrake again before watch it in my iPod.

Thank you in advance"
