"Haifisch" (German: "Shark") is the third single from the 2009 album Liebe ist fÃ¼r alle da by the German band Rammstein. Right before anouncing the video premier, the info letter from Rammstein's website left this quote regarding the song: "the shark not only has teeth â€“ heâ€™s got tears as well. But since it lives in the briny deep, no one sees them. A shame. After all, this cartilaginous fish is one of the oldest of the worldâ€™s many misunderstood creatures. A bit more sympathy couldnâ€™t hurt!"


The video features the band at lead singer Till Lindemann's funeral along with some other mourners, one of whom is Marilyn Manson. A fight breaks out between two women who have had Till's children. Meanwhile, the rest of the band contemplate on who should replace Till as the singer (with James Hetfield seeming to be the popular choice). As the video continues, Till is lowered into his grave enscripted "endlich allein" (German: "finally alone") and many scenarios are shown of how Till died, which are all based on previous Rammstein videos: being beaten and set on fire by Schneider (Du hast), having his tether cut while rock climbing by Richard (Ohne dich), having his oxygen pipe removed from his space suit by Ollie while on the moon (Amerika), and a fat Till being suffocated by spaghetti force-fed to him by Flake (Keine Lust)(A scene that might have been burrowed from Se7en). Paul also imagines himself being spanked by Till in a Snow White costume (Sonne). Later in the video the band begins to fight amongst themselves and Flake finds himself falling into the grave and breaking Till's coffin open, revealing that there is no body inside. Till is then shown alive and well in Oahu, Hawaii, where he sends a postcard to the band that reads "Viele GrÃ¼ÃŸe vom Arsch der Welt" (German: "Greetings from the arse of the world") and shows a shark that he has caught.

It is the first Rammstein video for Liebe ist fÃ¼r alle da not to premiere on the adult site Visit-x.
