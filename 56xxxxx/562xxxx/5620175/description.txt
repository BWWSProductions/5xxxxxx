"My Best Friend's Girl" is a song by American rock  band The Cars from their 1978 self-titled debut album on Elektra Records. Written by Ric Ocasek and produced by Roy Thomas Baker, the song was released as the album's second single. It peaked at number 35 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart, and reached number three in the UK. "My Best Friend's Girl" was included on the soundtrack to the 1979 film Over the Edge, and the song appears on numerous compilation albums, such as the band's 1985 Greatest Hits, 1995's Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology, and 2002's Complete Greatest Hits. A live version of the song by The New Cars appears on their 2006 debut album, It's Alive!.

"My Best Friend's Girl" begins with chords in the lower register of the guitar, a two-bar progression moving from I to IV to V in F. Hand claps enter in bar  five, and after the eight-bar intro, the first verse begins featuring Ric Ocasek's vocals. An organ is introduced in the first chorus, followed by a rockabilly guitar lick which leads to the second verse. The song is composed in contrasting verse-chorus form. The lyrics depict a man's frustration with a girl who is dating his best friend after the man dated her. The narrator coolly notes, "She's my best friend's girl, but she used to be mine."

The Cars is the debut album by the Boston-based American  new wave band The Cars, released in 1978. With the popular tracks "Just What I Needed" and "My Best Friend's Girl" getting heavy airplay on album-oriented rock radio stations, the album sold one million copies by the end of the year and steadily climbed the charts, peaking at #18 on the Billboard 200 in March 1979. The album was ranked #4 on Billboard's Top Pop Albums of 1979 year end chart. The Cars remained on the album chart for 139 weeks with four more tracks Ã¢â‚¬â€ "Good Times Roll", "You're All I've Got Tonight", "Bye Bye Love" and "Moving in Stereo" Ã¢â‚¬â€ becoming AOR radio favorites.

The album was re-issued as a Deluxe Edition on April 20, 1999, containing demos of the entire album alongside five previously unreleased demos.

Rolling stone's magazine ranked the album 279 in 500 best albums of all time.

The cover model is Natalya Medvedeva, a Russian-born model, journalist, and musician who died in 2003.

"Moving in Stereo" was used as the theme for Phoebe Cates' famous pool scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

The Cars, in its entirety, was released as downloadable content for the music video game Rock Band on May 27, 2008.
