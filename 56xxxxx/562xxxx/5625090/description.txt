The Doctor learns from the Ood that the Master will shortly return, but that
there is something else emerging from the darkness that will lead to "the end
of Time itself". As the Doctor races to Earth, a cult loyal to the Master
perform a resurrection ritual, using the Master's genetic material from Lucy
Saxon's lips to complete the process before offering their lives to the revived
Master. Lucy, aware of the Master's failsafe, introduces a fatal component to
the ritual, destroying herself and everyone else in the prison. The Master
escapes, having gained supernatural agility and telekinetic powers from the
failed ritual that drain him of his life energy, making him suffer from constant
hunger.
