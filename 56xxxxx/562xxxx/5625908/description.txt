SQLite is a small, fast, embeddable database. What makes it popular is the combination of the database engine and interface into a single library as well as the ability to store all the data in a single file. Its functionality lies between MySQL and PostgreSQL, however it is faster than both databases.

In SQLite, author Chris Newman provides a thorough, practical guide to using, administering and programming this up-and-coming database. If you want to learn about SQLite this is the book for you.

I hope that you find SQLite to be useful. On behalf of all the contributors to SQLite, I charge you to use it well: make good and beautiful things that are fast, reliable, and simple to use. Seek
forgiveness for yourself and forgive others. And since you have received SQLite for free, please give something for free to someone else in return. Volunteer in your community, contribute to some other software project, or find some other way to pay the debt forward.
