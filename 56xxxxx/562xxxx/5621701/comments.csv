,caulkins,2010-06-13T03:24Z,I just discovered that there is a pre-intro sequence that was not shown on the initial broadcast of this episode (and is missing here) but has been shown on at least one repeat broadcast.
[T],skJGZV6z,2010-06-14T01:54Z,"caulkins, you're right about the intro. Stossel reported it on his blog. Was it significant? I might be too lazy to re-up this if the viewer still gets the point without it."
[T],skJGZV6z,2010-06-19T00:51Z,"Note for 20100617 STOSSEL show: ""Drug War Disaster."" I recorded the show OK, but severe weather in my area last night caused numerous EAS messages to interrupt the video with tornado warnings.

For clean video, I'll instead record Saturday's rebroadcast and process that. Apologies for the delay."
