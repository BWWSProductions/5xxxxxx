Desc: The film consists of four stories in which 
human characters struggle to connect in a world of 
robot babies and android office workers. The stories
include: "My Robot Baby," in which a couple (played 
by Tamlyn Tomita and James Saito) must care for a 
robot baby before adopting a human child; "The Robot
Fixer," in which a mother (Wai Ching Ho) tries to 
connect with her dying son by completing his toy 
robot collection; "Machine Love," in which an office
worker android (Greg Pak) learns that he, too, needs
love; and "Clay," in which an old sculptor (Sab 
Shimono) must choose between natural death and 
digital immortality.

Notes: Found this in an old box of VHS's. Tape was
kinda beat up. Interesting story, if you dont mind a
VHS Rip. Video DOES contain white jaggies on top, but
cropping them would have removed too much video.
