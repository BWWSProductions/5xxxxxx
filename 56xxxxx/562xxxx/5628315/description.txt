[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
Made avs script for the vob...added denoise filter script, added deblocking filter, sharpness filter..added a de-interlace
script, fixed only interlace it could, looks like it was on a previous source with interlace, then been overwritted so really
couldnt be fixed tried though...chose the proper resolution..then was onto the colors, increased the red, and green a touch
lowered the blue slighty..then was onto brightness, i increased it quite alot..as theirs alot of scenes very dark so wanted
them to be viewable. then slightly changed contrast, so yes the black isn't true black, but if you want to see dark scenes
then this is your choice. Anyway Enjoy! once again, thanks to Seazer73 for the Release on vob.
