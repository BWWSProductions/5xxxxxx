,ArvenianQ,2010-06-16T06:57Z,XD there's a tag cap! thats about a quarter of my tags! XD
,dradclif,2010-06-16T08:02Z,"Well done, Thanks!"
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-16T22:28Z,No problem! Thank you for saying thanks! :D Rate up my torrent if you like it! :)
,BANGLEBOOY,2010-06-18T02:18Z,"fucking disqusting assholes who wont seed,.. i hate people like you,.. ugly no good fucks"
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-18T05:41Z,"I've been seeding since day 1 and i still am. You should seed as much as you download. If you download this whole file, upload it all back. if you only downloaded 2-3 games upload as much you downloaded them for. If we can get seeders eventually we can make this torrent last forever. If everyone seeded this file when they complete we could have LOTS of seeders and if we have LOTS of seeders, people could download this really fast and become a seeder sooner."
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-18T05:43Z,"If we get 100+ seeders i will upload my next ""Best of"" file and eventually we could get the whole worth playing PSP library in just a few torrents."
,BANGLEBOOY,2010-06-18T11:46Z,"i aqm seeding like 3-5 mb but only get 1-2 kb,.. what is wrong with ppl,.. "
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-18T21:13Z,some people dont have the greatist internet connections. I'm uploading 100k/s. i don't know how to make it any faster.

,FernFrond,2010-06-20T05:11Z,I remember playing almost all of these games. They were epic. I would seed but I don't need to download this. Nice work though.
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-20T06:27Z,Persona 3 FES isn't out yet. Unless you want the Japanese version...
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-20T06:28Z,Sorry people! My computer shut down on me so i wasn't seeding. I am up seeding now.
,ArvenianQ,2010-06-20T06:43Z,I am currently working on a best RPG's and action/adventures for the PSP.

,quaderquader,2010-07-10T01:48Z,"Yes, Sylpheon you are so right, I got the game somewhere else and it really really sucks. The other ones are super great, what a pity."
