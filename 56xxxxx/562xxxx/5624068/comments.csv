,djshag,2010-06-13T16:58Z,Has anyone actually finished downloading this? I'm at 99.7% as well. 
,crossfire6,2010-06-13T18:50Z,"This torrent with one seeder downloaded for me at better than 1.3MB/sec UNTIL hitting the 99.7% mark and then stopped.  Now, exactly why would that be?  If everyone is getting stopped at 99.7% can that possibly be coincidental?  Or, is njegos pulling a fast one on everyone?  If so, he is today's best candidate for Cancer."

,LMD129,2010-06-17T09:24Z,"Don't download either one of Office 2010 that is 800MB size all of these are beta.

Just wait till the end of June 2010 to get you hands on either the RTM (3.2GB) or MSDN (2.5GB) .
Don't waste your time and bandwidth on Microsoft beta for any reason except you are so much desperate like getting you hands on Windows 7."

,SeetherKid,2010-09-17T19:02Z,"Its been 30 days since I installed this, and now its asking me to connect to a corporate network to complete activation of the product. Can someone please help me out with this, as everytime I open up an office application,the irritating prompt comes up saying that the product activation has failed, and now it either wants me to connect to a corporate network or to enter a product key. Which I do not have as when i read this torrents info, it specifically said, no product key is needed. I must say that's a real bummer of a situation I am in. please HELP ME someone!!!!"
