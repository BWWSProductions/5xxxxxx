[V],twentyforty,2010-06-11T10:39Z,"@Stev: Lower the UL speed till you have 0.68 ratio during the download. Start at 1:1 and keep that way as long as you have active connection to fast swarm members. Try to move it down slowly (lower to let say 22 then watch five-six minutes then eventually go at 19 and even 17). In slow steps gradually.
If you ""dance"" with someone fast - do not touch anything. 
If you go too low, you'll be chocked by requests of rigged programs (watch Req. column): Xtorrents and old Transmissions which performs such practically DoS attack block for good within your firewall.
Also, if you're too low, you'll be tagged as "" uncooperative"" from FoF mechanism in all newer programs. These peers either would ignore your ""handshake"" or put you at very low priority giving you just the crumbs.
Be smart with your new ""package"" (LOL), be pro-active by adapting the changes quickly, for few days only till you find your own sweet-spot.
Later, when download is over, you can seed as much as you want (but do not forget to Stop all torrents on seeding when you start new download).
That's all for now, my friend."

@dardar6t9: Nice. I like that. Thank you."
,DCSDOC,2010-06-11T14:18Z,"Thanx 20-40.. Pls Upload Trainspotting BR Rip in Quark or 720p PROPER, in size around 200MB.. Thanx in Advance.."
,Stevc,2010-06-11T15:15Z,"@DCSDOC

20-40 is no longer uploading QUARK'S , that I'm 100% sure of and as far as I'm aware all requests are on hold. There are a few nice copys of trainspotting. I downloaded a 695mb mkv the other day and the quality was briliant. Just search on PB and sort the resaults by clicking on the size."

,jon4fun,2010-06-11T16:59Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Saw your comment on this file and linked with comment in 'Green Zone' am wondering if there is a proverbial 'war in heaven' in progress?
I hope TPB get there act together on what a file 'must be' due only to it's size or some other ridiculous sorting scheme and get out of the 20th century at the very least.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-11T18:59Z,"@Jon: I am sickened by all cursing I'm getting just because what I have been doing for years cannot fit someone's brain. I am tired of perpetual explanations - you and I get acquainted maybe year ago and to be honest - how many times have you seen my ""explanations"" of absolutely same things over and over again? A lot.
Whenever some loony pops-out an call me motherfucker just for putting ""360p"" in name of the torrent, I found myself explaining how it goes, blah-blah...again and again, same shit over and over.
Uploaders (who obviously scratching the balls out of big interest for their encodings) adopted very quickly new sport - trolling around and calling other uploaders dumbass or similar fine pointers of someones education and intellectual level.
Have you ever seen an intervention of moderators? Nope. But you have seen on forum, same stuff coming out of the people who should - moderate. This ain't job for any guy who raises his hand and is a friend with gang members."
