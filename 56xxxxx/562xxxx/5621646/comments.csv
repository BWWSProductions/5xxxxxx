,Futen2010,2010-08-01T00:19Z,"Yo fellas....
Okay so I'm just wondering what I'm supposed to do after I finish the download? I got it sitting on my desktop, unzipped it and double clicked on the video. VLC popped up and said I need to insert the game into an xbox? Can this be played on PC Windows 7 64Bit? Thank you all!! =D"
,krutok,2010-08-01T10:26Z,Futen2010: This is only for XBOX360.

You need to go buy a DL (dual layer) 8.5 GB dvd. Then go download xbox 360 cookies game burner. Open the game burner, and burn to disc. BTW, you have to have a flashed/modded xbox"

,Lodhiz,2010-08-24T18:28Z,"Hi, I just wanted to confirm that this game is working. I am playing it now as we speak. I just downloaded the ISO, ran it through abgx360 and then burnt using Imgburn at 2.4x on Verbatim's DVD+R DL. On iExtreme LT."
,winddriven,2010-08-26T01:04Z,Do i have to run it thro abgx360 for it to play?

,winddriven,2010-08-26T01:22Z,do i have to run it thro abgx360? or just burn the iso file on dvd+R DL w ImgBurn? or the dvd file created?
,Cisaroski,2010-09-05T08:31Z,thanks dcar777 your the best man! i was wondering how you extract like say 69 files from an isorip to one iso like you did with this PERFECT iso!!! could you please tell me the program/ info
,dcar777,2010-09-23T23:48Z,all abgx360 does is patch the game so you can play online without getting banned. It has already been patched by me for you. You can patch it again if it makes you feel better. I use xbox cookies to burn my games and im using CHEAP walmart memorex DL discs and they work like a charm every time. 
,frerwin,2011-02-03T15:11Z,"hey, thx for the upload!
