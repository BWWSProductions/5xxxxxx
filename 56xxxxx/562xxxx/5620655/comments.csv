,orvmirhe,2010-06-11T15:57Z, I am sorry to bother you DeGun but I got an empty map. no key. I wonder if my security program took the key or where is it.
,orvmirhe,2010-06-11T16:34Z,"Hei,I download it again and now Norman stopped downlaoding. Norman ALWAYS notice all keys as trojan. What is not true.Shall I try to turn off Norman and download again?  "
,orvmirhe,2010-06-13T01:52Z,I have your key. I changed my security program. Before I got your key I tried to intall 7 times adobe premiere and I failed every time. I have not try your key because I dont know what to do with that. I really want to have adobe premiere. 
,orvmirhe,2010-06-13T20:00Z,Thank you for your help. I have now installed adobe premiere. It works fine. I download from the place you told me and I have tried  even  that torrent before  but I did not find the key. I understand now that my old security program took  even that key. I am grateful to you that you answered my comments so I have changed security program. I trusted you more than norman. You are good and kind uploader.

,RussFinley,2010-06-18T20:49Z,"Hi DeGun,  I downloaded your ADOBE CS5 Master Universal KEYGEN - installed it and after running it the first time, I put in the KeyGen codes.  Which seemed to work fine.  But later, when I restarted the program,  it asked me again to put in Codes, which I did.  Is there not a way to do this permenently???  "
,Telessa,2010-06-21T02:48Z,Hello! I have downloaded the keygen and I have tried to enter in a serial for Photoshop Elements and I have tried the Photoshop Elements and also Adobe Master Collection CS5 and none of the keys work! Any suggestions?
,wilsen3,2010-06-21T05:44Z,Great!!
,blevvy,2010-06-22T03:30Z,keygen has a confirmed generic trogan in it - avoid it like AIDS
,w8rz,2010-07-03T02:28Z,"KEYGEN HAS TROJAN BEWARE!

,Telessa,2010-07-06T08:50Z,I downloaded dreamweaver and it installed great with your keygen! But Flash pro and photoshop didn't do so well. After using all the flash and photoshop choices and also the adobe master key I couldn't get it to install and I tried about 15 different keys!! Any ideas?
,Telessa,2010-07-06T08:53Z,"Oh lol no I will try disconnecting the internet! duh! lol

AND OMG PPL!! GOOGLE FALSE POSITIVE VIRUSES! lol

I download from this guy all the time....I ONLY download from the users on here that have a PINK or GREEN skull by it... DeGun is GOOD to GO!"
,Telessa,2010-07-06T17:02Z,"Tried disconnecting the internet and Flash and Photoshop I still can't hack with this key...

Any suggestions?"
,igotprettynewshoes,2010-07-06T18:41Z,"I've just used your keygen (fastest I've ever used!)
I know I had to go off the internet while using it etc, just wondering do I need to stay offline everytime I use the programs?
Thanks :)"
,dekiai,2010-07-12T11:03Z,okaaay what the fuck? the title says cs5 and when i open the list theres pretty much every program EXCEPT cs5. good job
,ChristofferB,2010-07-19T21:12Z,"In the drop down list, just above ""photoshop Cs4 extended"" it says ""ADOBE MASTER COLLECTION CS5"". It was tricky to find, but it works anyway :D

THANX "
,skiba_,2010-07-19T22:41Z,Can I update this? Dont want to reinstall windows if it stops working bc of the updates. Please answer. 
,rjeii2,2010-07-30T17:59Z,"Worked for me, you either have to stay off the internet while using the program or block it from accessing the internet via firewall settings or patch... same as previous versions.. Like any keygen my antivirus software ""detected"" a threat but it is safe. any keygen you download is considered a threat by antivirus programs"
,TPBSPY,2010-08-31T16:12Z,Why the fuck would you update pirated warez? omfg... Too many Wombats using a computer.
,unRheal,2010-09-08T03:37Z,"TPBSPY: Maybe because they wanted the functionality/fixes of the updates...? Certainly known keys, etc. from some software will give you away if updating - but they at least possibly might not be able to confirm if you used a keygen.

Of course it's probably not a good idea in general, unless you *know* that it's ok and has worked for others (and you're not using a known key that everyone passes around) - but there's certainly lots of software out there that's pirated that will still update.

Besides, not everybody understands how things work about everything - even you (yup, believe it or not) had to learn the stuff at one point."
,larkuel,2010-09-15T18:06Z,"I use windows 7, and have disabled my antivirus, and disconnected from the internet, but whenever i try to use the keygen application it says ""windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.  you may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.""  I am the admin.  the app was marked as safe.  I don't understand."
[V],DeGun,2010-09-30T01:15Z,"@@ LARKUEL :

add the keygen/crack to your antivirus exceptions list .

and run it again after this . 

The file is blocked because your AV did - with no warning to you apparently - put it in quarantaine so -----------> exceptions list .

Thx all for comments

,indefniteglow,2010-12-01T09:39Z,this keygen works. If you had a previous working copy of cs5 master suite and (on or around Dec. 1) due to updates it told you your license was expired this will work.
,cweb512,2010-12-01T23:46Z,"I agree with indefiniteglow, my cs5 apps from ththingy stopped working today, then I used the master collection serial and it worked, so thanks a lot"

,jimmyhof,2010-12-15T16:45Z,"Hi DeGun
I installed the keygen on my old computer XP 32 bit 3 or 4 months ago and it worked perfect.  

I just built a new 64 bit windows 7 computer and the keygen initially works but then when i open the file while i am connected to the internet it repeatedly tells me the activation number is invalid.

Any Suggestions?"
,crazy_Z,2010-12-17T16:41Z,Thanks!! Master Key worked perfectly!
,Teleos,2010-12-23T17:15Z," DeGun, thank you VERY much for this.

 To those having problems:

 1. When Adobe requests the key leave all of the boxes blank, then copy/paste the new one.
 It doesn't work if you try to fill in when there are leftovers.

 2. Block Adobe from connecting to the internet.

 I did that and everything works fine now."
,WyllyWylly,2010-12-26T07:38Z,"Works for me, like the hosts patch that's built in. It even detected my manual entries for Adobe, nice touch. Thanks."
,thedarksid3,2010-12-26T17:49Z,thanks for the backdoor trojan
,Bacon91,2010-12-29T09:44Z,Works perfectly. The trick is to have your internet DISCONNECTED while activating.
