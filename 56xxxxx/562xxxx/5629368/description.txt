In this dark action-thriller based on a comic book series, "good" vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes) and his mentor (Kris Kristofferson) battle an evil vampire rebel (Stephen Dorff) who plans to take over the outdated vampire council, capture Blade and resurrect voracious blood god La Magra. N'Bushe Wright co-stars as a bitten hematologist who resolves to find a cure for vampirism before she, too, joins the ranks of the undead.
