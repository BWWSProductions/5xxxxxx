,Kellso76,2010-06-16T01:26Z,No problem.....thx for the feedback
,napptunes,2010-06-16T18:59Z,"hey i've been checking out your torrents. i'm a big fan of everybody who does the work. they all look great on my Apple TV. i've been trying to use WinX like you advised and i converted a movie that looked great, however i was wondering if we knew what setting i should change to have a smaller file (this one was mre than 1GB). thank you in advance for your response."
,Kellso76,2010-06-17T05:07Z,"Hey Napp, thx for the feedback. I would have to see a pic of the WinX screenshot to give you any kind of advice and also, what exactly are you trying to accomplish? For example, are you trying to encode for HDTV or for Ipod? What is your desired file size? How big is the file you are starting with? Are you working with a PC or mac? And also, I use a few different programs on some rips to get it like I want it. Its hard to say exactly what u should do because there's so many things and so many ways to get what you want done. "
,Kellso76,2010-06-17T05:20Z,"I'm new to WinX but normally, changing the video quality to a lower setting can effect your file size. For example, the Iphone setting in WinX starts at 1024 kbps but u can adjust this up or down by clicking on the arrows:

Also, change your profile setting to a 480 x 270 resolution because this setting is kinda a ""universal"" setting for most handheld devices on the market today like PSP and Ipod and most smart phones....

Of course, these are the settings for an Ipod style rip. If you need advice on an HD rip, thats another ballgame.....LOL"
,Kellso76,2010-06-17T06:15Z,"Hey Napp, these settings should get you to your desired file size.

Of course, you can make other adjustments as you see fit like volume adjustment or using the high quality engine but normally you wont need the high quality engine if your original source is Bluray. Force A/V sync is used if you're having problems with the audio and video syncing correctly. Always ""keep aspect ratio"" on your output image setting otherwise, you may distort the video image. Click start and drink a beer...LOL"
,napptunes,2010-06-17T12:58Z,"alright, thank you so much. i'm going to try it right away. i'll keep you updated."
,napptunes,2010-06-17T20:16Z,"hey Kellso, 
it worked perfectly. thanks again. i like to have the official itunes artwork for my movies. do you know how to get them without renting or buying the movies. 

http://www.getvideoartwork.com/ : you cant get many from this website but they don't have all of them unfortunately and they're pretty slow with requests.

also if you have downloaded movies from HR or PT, do you know how to put account name and email address in the info. i use metax to tag my movies : http://www.kerstetter.net/index.php/projects/software/metax

hope you answer soon!"
,Kellso76,2010-06-17T23:04Z,"Try a program called Vidalin for adding the artwork to your files. They may not be official but they will work. I usually use Vidalin or google the artwork I'm lookin for. If I download a movie, its ALWAYS gonna be a PT movie because of the Dolby Digital audio she puts in her rips. I have tried other rips from different uploaders and loved the video but was dissapointed with the audio.....When you download a PT movie, use Vidalin to remove most of the unwanted tags like the email address and encoder info. It usually works for me on all her rips. Try it and let me know how it works. She uses a lenux based program so when she tags, its deep into the file like its from Apple so good luck.....With Vidalin, just click the add file button, choose your file and let it do its thing. Its gonna create a brand new file so use that one. It may freeze at the end of the copy but just command, option escape to force quit the program...it should be fine."
,Kellso76,2010-06-17T23:11Z,"And one more thing Napp, I don't know how to add your Itunes account info to a pirated movie. You should probably consult PT on that one. Like I said before, PT is using an uncompiled Lenux based program like the developers use at Itunes. That stuff is all code and you gotta know what you're doing to get it right and I wont even attempt to explain it cause its out of league....LOL I'm glad the settings I suggested worked for you. tho"
,napptunes,2010-06-17T23:25Z,"great. i'm going to try the program but now that i can encode my own movies i don't think i will need it as much. in fact i don't even mind having her address in the file it's just that i would have liked to have mine in my files. it's fine since it's too complicated. i was just trying to see if there was an easy way of doing it. so wait you're saying that PT has a better audio than you do? i haven't tried watching any of my movies on the Apple TV but i'm really liking the way it's going. and concerning the artwork i really prefer when it's from itunes.
one more thing, i've noticed that all those encodes are for PSP, ipod etc. but really it looks great on my tv (widescreen, good image and sound). have you tried the settings you gave me and do you think the results are similar to PT's work?"
,Kellso76,2010-06-17T23:46Z,"PT hands down is the best encoder in my opinion besides HR. I'm not saying her audio is better then mines, I'm saying that I have asked for alot of advice from her because if you wanna be the best, you have to learn from the best. Alot of piraters claim to have 6 channel AAC audio but its basicly sound coming from all 6 speakers. PT, HR, myself and a few others, put the actual Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack in our rips so the audio is is the original 5.1 surround audio. This may make the file a little bigger but to me, I will take a bigger file for better audio quality. Those files for Ipod are for Ipod but you still may get a descent picture on an HDTV tho. I don't wanna say my files are the same or better then PT rips because I learned from her so the student usually doesn't kick the masters ass....LOL"
,napptunes,2010-06-18T14:36Z,"ok, careful i'm going to kick both of your asses though LOL jk..."
,Kellso76,2010-06-19T01:00Z,Damn Napp!.......don't beat us up to bad....LOL
,Kellso76,2010-06-19T01:02Z,I have moved to my second stage of training.....PT is gonna teach me the Buda Finger Command Line fighting style next so watch your ass Napp!...LOL
,napptunes,2010-06-19T22:25Z,what the heck LOL
