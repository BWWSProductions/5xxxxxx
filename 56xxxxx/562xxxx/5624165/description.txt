Best Video Splitter available!
Splits all popular video formats very quickly and does not require re-encoding for the split sections. It simply splits the video as you want it!

Fantastic software! Easy to use and very robust!
This is really a good software. Very stable and easy to use. I tested many different variants of softwares that can split video files, but they were no good and unnecessary complicated

Won't Find a video splitter as good as this!
I have tried just about every other video splitter out there. And they all have to re-encode which takes hours to do. Then the quality is lowered usually.Boilsofts fine program here just splits it, no re-encoding, no loss of quality whatsoever. Only took 4 mins on my computer. The interface is very simple.

"A must for all VCD/AVI enthusiasts"
I was amazed how quickly it split a 800mb file on my old p3 450mhz about 4mins, easy to use and the split files can be viewed through real player as avi. Well done guys a definate thumbs up!!!!

"great program"
easy to use-simple interface. it does the job of splitting larger files ( avi, mpeg, divx..) into smaller ones- these are still playable and of great quality!! Great program!

"Easy, Smooth, and FAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
This is by far the best product I have found to cut those oversized AVI/DIVX movies under 700mb for easy VCD creation.
