Description: ;;This film analyzes the movement of a society from freedom to tyranny in five steps. It clearly shows how those in positions of power may cultivate the conditions of tyranny in any population by demonstrating how easily ordinary people may be manipulated into compliance with "authority", into silence before criminality, and even how easily most people may be coerced into performing genuinely evil acts. Evocative of much that is happening in the world today.
