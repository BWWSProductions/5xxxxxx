,russianbar,2010-06-15T20:27Z,Anyone got this working yet??
,russianbar,2010-06-16T20:50Z,is there anybody there????
,ionlyknow,2010-06-17T17:28Z,"@russianbar
Think like this. If those who have downloaded the game got it working, they probably wont check this page again because... well it's working so they haven't got anything to complain about. 
Long story short: no comments and lots of seeds = works. "
,russianbar,2010-06-17T19:23Z,"Thought that might be the case, did u download it? The text file with the serial no is some sort of garbled wingding script and i can only make out the serial, so if anyone has it ungarbled would appreciate it if some one could post it "
,ionlyknow,2010-06-18T07:01Z,"No I haven't downloaded the file, but i downloaded the serial and I think the only person who can help you with it is thenoobish. "
,DroleDeFille,2010-06-20T11:03Z,"Same problem with installing it here. Whatever I do, it just keeps asking for the DVD-rom. Help?"

,russianbar,2010-06-20T13:26Z,"Hooray! Its not just me, howay Thenoobish sort it out please"
,bfbruin,2010-06-20T22:32Z,"The translated version:

serial no: 7G66-FLJV-KV3B-F58V-F5LN

Possible problems: if you start the game, OS gives an error type
""Please insert the correct disk, select OK, and restart the application"",
you must:
1. Click on the ""apple"" to choose ""System Preferences""
2. Select the item ""Regional Settings"" and drag ""English"" upstairs.
3. Reboot.
4. Start the game.

However, it still does not offer a chance to fix the DVD-ROM issue.

I suggest one of two things:
1) Could someone try burning the ISO to a DVD, see if that works?
2) Anyone willing to generate a No-CD crack, likely involving the Package contents?
"
,russianbar,2010-06-20T23:45Z,Burned to dvd same problem
,russianbar,2010-06-20T23:50Z,"And there dont appear to be a ""Regional Settings""

,musicalman08,2010-06-27T17:49Z,does anyone have a crack for this? i tried downloading the pc version and playing it that way but no luck with that either. anyone able to get this to work? 
,hperson,2010-07-03T05:18Z,"this is really annoying, anyone fixed it yet?? also, how do you know that is the correct translation? anyways, thenoobish... please fix this."
,Camellita,2010-07-12T19:33Z,"Hiya thenoobish,nI know a lot of people already asked you this, but could you please help us all out? (I think) we all pretty much followed every possible intruction we were given (including the additional ones on this comment page). It all isn\'t really helping, so could you please do so?nThe game still says you have to insert the right disc, which, obviously, we don\'t possess.n(I\'m sorry for my screwed up english, I\'m Dutch :-S)nI know the game doesn\'t work for us (yet), but thanks anyway for trying :-)"
,s0z3,2010-07-19T10:03Z,"I got mine working after a couple hours of headaches. Like many of you, the ""Cannot locate DVD-ROM"" stumped me for awhile.

EA Games uses a weak piracy protection/portability scheme called Cider on their Mac games. This system runs an exe that checks in with EA's servers to validate the serial. To get past it, you'll need to download the cracked (sometimes called ""no cd crack"") .exe either from the PC version of this game (look for a folder called ""Hatred"") or the one from a site like http://www.gamecopyworld.com/ (where I got mine from). 

After downloading the cracked exe and adding the game to your applications, right-click the game icon, select ""Show Package Contents"", then search for hp.exe. Right-click it, choose ""open containing folder,"" and replace that file with the cracked one. If everything works like it did for me, you'll not only be able to play the game but do so without the CD or dmg. I hope it helped!"
,s0z3,2010-07-19T10:11Z,"...or hp5.exe; I don't remember what it was called. Just look for a folder called transgaming, follow it to c_drive, and find the executable."
,a3801122,2010-08-02T13:08Z,"HELP!!!!!!
it didn't ask for cd/dcd
but the serial number doesn't work at all!!!!"
,Eriktin85,2010-08-03T04:41Z,"@s0z3: thanks your advice worked
@a3801122: turn off your airport (wifi)"
,pikls94,2010-10-04T17:13Z,"@s0z3, your information helped a bit, it got past the 'no cd' stage and let me enter the serial code, which was accepted. it then asked if i wanted to register with EA so i clicked no. The loading screen i guess? (image appeared on desktop that shows its starting up) showed up and after about 10 seconds it came up with the 'no cd' popup. :/ any ideas anyone?"
,pikls94,2010-10-13T16:44Z,"ok, turns out i was looking in the wrong folder, i found transgaming, then c_drive then hp5. but its a read only folder?"
,fedrik456,2010-10-28T08:45Z,"@pikls94, Image is usually mounted as read only.  Use this format in terminal to mount it as read/write -
hdiutil mount -readwrite /path-to-image/dmg-name.dmg"
,fedrik456,2010-10-28T09:12Z,"@pikls94 to mount any image as read+write -
In Terminal, type:
hdiutil mount -readwrite /path-to-image/image-name.extension"
,vcarol,2010-12-21T03:32Z,"@s0z3: I followed your instructions and downloaded the hatred no cd crack. The only problem is whenever I go into ""Show Package Contents"" there is no .exe to replace. Any ideas? "
,noranud,2010-12-23T20:17Z,"i'm having the same problem as everyone else--it says it's missing the cd. so i downloaded the hatred crack, but my mac won't let me edit the package contents. so then i converted the .dmg file to read/write using disk utility, and deleted the hp.exe file that was already in the file so i could replace it with the hatred one. but now it says there's not enough room on the disc to put the hatred .exe file in. i'm at the end of my rope here...anybody got any suggestions?"
,fpkurt,2011-07-14T19:12Z,"dont try and replace the .exe from the crack to the actual dmg u downloaded... u have to do it in the application you dragged to your applications folder

1) install game
2) download fixed .exe or crack or what have you
3)go into applications find the game right click and click show package contents find the HP5 exe in resources folder
4) replace the .exe with the crack
5)PLAY THE GOD DAMN GAME


THIS AINT NO ROCKET SCIENCE!"
,fpkurt,2011-07-14T19:23Z,"sorry i missed a step follow these steps!

1) install game to applications folder
2) download fixed exe at game copy world just search it

3) unzip that fixed exe with stuffit expander or something

9) play the game!

10) bow down to me as your supreme ruler"
,Firsou,2011-08-02T13:54Z,"Okay, obviously some people have problems so I am going to help all of you.

If you followed the steps below, you have now downloaded the HATRED .exe . Now you opened the .dmg to replace the .exe right ? Well, that is not where you have to replace -_-... You install the game FIRST ( it means that you drag it somewhere on your computer from the .dmg )  then go into your applications folder ( or wherever you placed the game ) using Finder, don't click on the folder if it's on the dock as it won't let you show package contents. Click FINDER then go into Applications ( or wherever you placed the game ) then right click on the game and click show package contents then Contents > Resources > Then you will see ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix "" This is not the .exe . Right click on it and ""show package contents "" again. Then go on Contents > Resources > transgaming > c_drive > hp5 > Then you will see hp.exe . Here it is. Replace the hp.exe with the HATRED hp.exe . Hope it helped you and don't go away with the longer of the comment it is totally simple. A little thank you would be appreciated but it's up to you. Enjoy your game."
