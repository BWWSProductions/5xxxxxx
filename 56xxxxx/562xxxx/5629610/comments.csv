,KeiKun83,2010-06-15T21:46Z,"Normally I would agree, but I played the demo last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Graphics are really nice and the gameplay is pretty fun, too.
I just wished there would have been one mission more included. I think, I'll give this game a chance."
,RMJ13,2010-06-15T22:16Z,"extreame limited movement  might as well be in a HALLWAY  mission last for less then 5 minutes then cut scene  city interactive drops another stinker!  At least I won,t need to download the whole game now! "

,spycell,2010-06-23T15:48Z,"The movement isnt so good accauly, since it's a sniper game you should be able to go to top of hills and stuff...

But all in all the demo wasn't so bad, it made me want to buy the game, or atleast download it.
But i don't think i'm gonna like the multiplayer tough..."

,epimansg,2011-05-20T18:21Z,"It's amazing how you people{using word loosely} keep saying that this is a public site and which means more than likely there will be people of all ages and yet you can't refrain from using such strong language, would have thought it was a navy locker room....grow up."
