"Unseen Lithuania"

"Unseen Lithuania" album is a good present for those who love Lithuania. You may look at the pictures and think this is some other country. But this is indeed Lithuania. Unseen Lithuania. Lithuaniaâ€™s landscape is just as impressive as that of the best known and most often visited countries of the world. We do not have snow-covered peaks, scorched deserts, deadly volcanoes or coral reefs that look like theyâ€™ve been painted by children. However, only in Lithuania there are tower hills remembering ancient heroes, a narrow thread of land between the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea, the unique patterns of meandering rivers and lake islands, sand dunes caressed by the ever-eager sea, towns by the edge of the water and impressive churches that look like spaceships ready for launch. Nowhere else does the green colour have so many shades.
