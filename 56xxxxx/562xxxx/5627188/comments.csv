,fatboyaudio,2010-06-21T15:06Z,"NOT GOOD PICTURE QUALITY CAPTURED WITH A CAMERA FRONT OF A TV,AND VERY BAD SOUND FROM THE CAMERA MIC......BETTER RENT IT FROM A VIDEO CLUB AND COPY IT....;-)"

Of course it's a CAM version, that's all that's out seeing how the movie is still in theatres and the R5 isn't due out until September sometime. You want to wait months to rent it and get DVD quality? Be my guest, but shut your trap and say THANKS to the uploader for saving us the cost of admission @ the theatres. "
