 PLOT:Jim Uhls is not your average screenwriter. For one thing, his nickname
 is "Professor Peculiar." For another, as this exclusive off-kilter discussion of
 his craft demonstrates, Uhls is eager to break the first rule of Fight Club : He
 talks about Fight Club. A lot. That seminal film, directed by David Fincher
 (Se7en, Panic Room), pushed every boundary possible for a studio movie, and Uhls'
 darkly funny script, adapted from the Chuck Palahniuk novel, is a wickedly
 subversive example of how to successfully adapt an "unadaptable" book. Step inside
 the mind of the man who figured out how to do it, as Professor Peculiar explains
 how to use a newspaper story approach to build a brilliant pitch, why you should
 interview your characters, how to know when to "stick a fork" in your screenplay,
 and the macabre particulars of how and why he had to murder his brother's cat.
