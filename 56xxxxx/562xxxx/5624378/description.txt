Now in its 19th year of publication, Electronic House serves discriminating consumers who enjoy the elegance, simplicity and fun afforded by integrated home technology. EH helps homeowners understand the variety of technology-related products and services available today--in terms that make sense even to non-techy readers. Ultra-elaborate home theaters and automation systems are featured, as are their more modest counterparts. That means there's something for everyone, whether you're looking to add some lighting and thermostat controls to your modest home, or planning to build a mansion with all the bells and whistles.
