The Youngblood Brass Band is a brass band from Oregon, Wisconsin, United States that was started by students at Oregon High School in 1995 when they were known as the One Lard Biskit Brass Band with the name changed to the current name in 1998.

In my opinion one of the most exciting and entertaining bands of all time, I've yet to meet someone that hasn't fallen in love with them.

Please seed and enjoy.
