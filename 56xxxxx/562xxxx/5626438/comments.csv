,dielaughing,2010-06-15T23:14Z,"MKV is probably the worst format to play, convert, send file or anything else for that matter. Audio always broken/off center, can't forward through the movie without the player crashing.. the sixe for a 1.5 hr. movie could be as big as 5 movies.. the converter takes all day to convert just 1 stupid MKV format to the standard avi format that was, is and always will be the normal/most common shared and agreed upon format that is widely accepted. So, you can take your MKV file and shove it up your ass and everyone else putting these file formats out there, shared.. Rot! All of you can just die a really embarrassing death. I hope your computer freezes up on you until you see the error in your MKV ways and join the rest of the heard. Death to MKV and all who support it. Burn the witches burn the witches burn the witches... ;)"

Perhaps it's better you just download stuff in another format and say thanks to whoever put there for you, instead of complaining about stuff you get for free."
,dedli,2010-06-19T15:02Z,"I humbly recommend using VLC Media Player (Yes, it is free!) to play all of your MatrosKa  files. 
It's a literally flawless piece of software & it is gaining popularity very quickly. 
Plus, why not utilize your monitor's hi-res capabilities by springing for those HD/Bluray rips?
