[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-14T07:19Z,VERY nice!
,taz654321,2010-06-14T23:55Z,Stick around.  Seeding should be starting soon.
,taz654321,2010-06-15T00:00Z,These CDs were very carefully ripped and checked.  I even burnt a CD and then reripped to make sure same CRCs were oftained.  See readme in download.
,maxicastro,2010-06-15T00:16Z,"I've been looking for this for ages now. Highly appreciated, indeed :D"
,taz654321,2010-06-15T04:09Z,"With any luck should be fully seeding sometime on 6/15/10.  Bear with me until then and don't forget to seed back to keep it going, if you appreciate this torrent."
,BOMM2,2010-06-16T16:30Z,"Thank you for sharing - you have spent a long time creating this torrent, and I hope to see more from you in the future!

Oh ... and I usually prefer the old versions of most CD's but got the whole package and will play all of it multiple times over the next weeks, or until the other tenants call the police. :-)"
,taz654321,2010-06-17T23:25Z,"Thanks HMVinyl, MaxiCastro, and BOMM2 for your kind comments.  I hope you enjoy the music!  This is the first torrent I have authored.  I have seeded 63.3GB and I think it is time for this torrent to swim or sink on it's own.  If it dies, I will most likely put it out again, but on a private tracker that enforces ratios.  So if you want things available on public trackers like Pirate Bay - then SEED, SEED, SEED.  Best wishes, TAZ654321.  "
,taz654321,2010-06-17T23:33Z,"anyone understand why the Pirate Bay tracker is being ""actively refused"" when I try to connect to it with Âľ-torrent and ATT DSL?"
,evolution123,2010-08-02T08:33Z,Thanks
,thorofdenmark,2011-01-16T11:22Z,Twat the fuck!! where is the RR tribute????
,taz654321,2011-02-24T22:22Z,"RR Tribute is not original studio discography, and I'm not interested in it.  However, you can get it elsewhere."
,taz654321,2011-02-24T22:24Z,RR tribute is not orignal studio discography.  I'm not interested in tributes and remakes - but you can easily find it elsewhere.  Better to listen to the original RR on the original recordings
,ulikes,2011-03-03T06:08Z,Mp3 is dead!! Long live flac!
,Adveser,2011-04-05T20:15Z,"Thank you so much.

Super Bit Map FLAC is the best!"
