,JujitsuFreak,2010-06-14T05:53Z,"felix - a little premature to be making that request.  I don't think people will have a problem, in less than a half hour there's already 100+ seeders.  If there was no one seeding then ya, post your request- otherwise, if you're experiencing slow downloads you might want to check your bittorrent config.  Regardless, you got me as a seeder and for the season - so long as someone as reputable as torrentzone uploads them in high quality and in record time, there's no way I cannot pay back the favor.  Enjoy!"

,LRD3,2010-06-14T06:39Z,"finished download, i'll seed for as long as i have leachers. This is one of my favorite shows, i'm happy to share, and thankful for the uploader, and the ease at which i can pirate my favorite shows and movies."
