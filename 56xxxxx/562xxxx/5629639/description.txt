Ian Punnett welcomed two guests, Jim Bell during the second hour and Minister Lindsey Williams in the 3rd hour, for a discussion on the Gulf oil crisis as well as alternative energy. Bell, who calls himself an "ecological designer," blamed the oil spill on a corporate culture which focuses on making a profit by way of "taking short cuts" that, ultimately, result in situations such as the one in the Gulf of Mexico. He put forward the notion that the ideal scenario to break free of corporate controlled energy is to aggressively pursue efficient solutions which would make the transition away from oil easier and faster. Using solar power as an example, he theorized that, with good leadership, it would take about 40 years for such a transition to take place. 

In the second hour, Minister Lindsey Williams, who once served as a chaplain for the oil companies operating in Alaska, shared what he claimed to be the "real story" behind the Gulf oil crisis. He explained that, in the 1970's, Russia drilled over 40,000 feet into the ground and discovered abiotic oil, i.e. oil which replenishes itself via an as-yet-unknown chemical process. The off-shore drilling done by BP in the Gulf of Mexico, Williams said, was their attempt to create a similar super-deep well and access this same abiotic oil. However, according to his sources, the pressure from this pocket of abiotic oil in the Gulf was so great that it burst all the safety valves on the floating platform. 

Williams went on to allege that oil industry insiders believe that the only method to stop the flow of oil in the Gulf is via a nuclear device and even that has potential for catastrophic results. Bell, who rejoined the conversation in the fourth hour, agreed with Williams about the potential danger of using a nuke to thwart the spill because it could "pop the bubble" and cause all of the underground oil to emerge simultaneously. On the potential long term effects of the crisis if the flow of oil is not stopped, Bell speculated that it could reach Europe within three years through the Gulf Stream. Additionally, Williams observed that the overwhelming amount of dangerous gasses, which are also being released from the disaster, could be swept along the East Coast should a hurricane arrive in the Gulf. 

Joran van der Sloot Case 
During the first hour of the program, forensic psychologist Dr. Katherine Ramsland discussed the Joran van der Sloot murder case. Should Van der Sloot be the murderer of both Natalie Holloway and Stephany Flores, Ramsland said that "it's unlikely he's done this five years apart without any kind of activity in between." However, she noted that determining additional crimes would be difficult given Van der Sloot's international travel and insufficient record keeping and investigations found in some countries. As such, Ramsland stopped short of calling him a serial killer, saying that "at this point, it's all alleged." Additionally, she was reticent to classify Van der Sloot as a sociopath or psychopath since those types of characterizations require a clinical diagnosis.
