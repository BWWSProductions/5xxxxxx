,CharlieTann,2010-07-31T19:03Z,Well right before July 4th some lovely person decided to put malware into 1 of the torrents I downloaded. Long story short it took almost a month to get it corrected and I lost some stuff including all the EE torrents so I can't seed this one. But I will have a surprise for the EE fans so keep tuned and in the next few weeks you'll be happy.
