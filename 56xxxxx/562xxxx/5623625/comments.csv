,believenu,2010-06-12T22:33Z,"Thank you. to continue from trans twist  comment thanks for advise I am learning and trying to understand all I am doing but regarding your note
 ""Also, be aware that you've been reading my post to somebody else and therefore, no individual adjustments were present""

[V],twentyforty,2010-06-12T23:05Z,"LOL no, believenu. It should be understood like:
""I always made individual adjustments regarding person's knowledge"".
I've meant that I knew how and on what way should be said to the specific person who placed a question.
I fail very often in doing that 'cause I simply do not know who exactly other person is. That's what I meant, nothing about some  ""spying""."
,believenu,2010-06-12T23:10Z,"truly we do not know each other in the sense of face to face. But as my newfoundland grandmother would say ""just because you are paranoid doesn't mean they are not out to get you"" also ""believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see"".. but I Believe that Seeding is Sharing with my world wide friends weather I have met them or not. thanks  "
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-13T07:35Z,"Well believenu, world is the hostile place, for sure. But people who doesn't like that should act against. Your Sharing is Caring is multifaceted way to say it.
Even if your granny's saying is familiar to myself, I have seen that such comprehension of world and people around usually leads astray and induce and enhance 
""To know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.""
when bartenders see all people as alcoholics, policemen see ALL people as crooks, robbers and potential killers, drug addicts push all others, and preachers see lambs of god everywhere.
One word - preconception. It has gone so far than anybody is treated as enemy, at sight. Then, world become simpler than black&white, right? All darkness inside paints the world - in black, which is not a color.  But pitch black."
