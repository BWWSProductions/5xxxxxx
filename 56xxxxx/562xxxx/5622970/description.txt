"Spirit in the Sky" is a song written and originally recorded by Norman Greenbaum and released in 1969. The single sold two million copies in 1969 and 1970 and reached number three in the U.S. Billboard chart, as well as number one on the UK, Australian  and Canadian charts in 1970. Rolling Stone ranked "Spirit in the Sky" #333 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was featured on the 1969 album of the same name.

Cover versions by Doctor and the Medics and Gareth Gates have also made the number 1 spot in the UK.

Many artists have released cover versions of the song. In 1986, Doctor and the Medics released a version which went to number 1 in 32 countries, including the UK. In 2003, a version was released by pop-singer Gareth Gates and The Kumars, in aid of the charity Comic Relief. It reached number 1 in the UK charts for two weeks.

Laughing At The Pieces is the 1986 album by Doctor and the Medics.

In 1985 they signed to IRS Records and released "Happy but Twisted" a five track 12" EP including a cover  of Hawkwind's "Silver Machine". This reached number 2 on the indie charts. This was followed by "The Miracle of the Age", produced by Andy Partridge of XTC.

Around this time the band performed a concert in a television studio in Limehouse, London which was recorded for television broadcast, although it was not shown at the time. At this concert the line up was augmented by Roman Jugg of The Damned on keyboards and second guitar.

They scored an international hit in 1986 with their next single, a cover of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit in the Sky". The single reached number one in the UK among others. They fared less well with subsequent singles; "Burn" and "Waterloo" (the latter of which was a cover of the ABBA hit, with Roy Wood on saxophone, backing vocals and in the video). "Burn" reached No 29 in the UK Singles Chart and "Waterloo", No 45.
