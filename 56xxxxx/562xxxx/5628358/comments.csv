,Ribins,2010-09-01T11:52Z,working for me now 
,Anarcieath,2010-09-02T19:14Z,I actually had trouble with this. Then my brain started working again. Extract the SWAT4 rar and run autorun. Install it and open the crack folder. Copy the SWAT4 icon and go to program files/Sierra/SWAT4/Content/System and paste it there. Do the same with tss.
,agent1331,2010-10-25T06:32Z,what the fuck is wrong with the expansion? the sound wasn't installed. care to explain why?
,orange7,2011-05-01T02:48Z,If you get the insert cd 2 just extract it into a folder with winrar or 7zip. worked for me. Thanks!

So I put the cracked version in the sierra file and copyed the icon on it and it give me this error message ""The program can't start because ALAudio.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the progream to fix this problem."" Deamon tools gives me the same message. Please for the love of god help me."

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS !!!
Swat 4 version 1.0 worked fine too so I realy don't understand this :("
,Zanwolf,2012-02-17T01:36Z,"I have a problem with this as well.

The game and it's patches install fine.

It's when I come to play online that everything goes crazy.

I find a game room I want to join, I see there are available spaces, I click join, I then get this message;

""The options you have specified are invalid""

...

Wtf does that mean?

I've given full access to Swat 4 and TTS in my firewall, installed that patch to v1.1 (which is the same version as the game room I want to join btw), and yet I still can not join.

SWAT 4 and TTS online give me that same response.
I don't have GameSpy installed, but I doubt that is the problem as a friend of mine has it working fine.

I also used the the first 2 serials given to me in the individual readmes; the first serial for SWAT readme, the first serial for TTS readme.

I don't know if that affects anything because I haven't been prompted by the game while online that it's a serial issue.
Maybe it is?

Is this a v1.1 problem or is it the serials I used?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can solve this."
,Zanwolf,2012-02-17T02:30Z,"New problem has arisen, the same as eMeSaR mentioned.

I uninstalled ALL of the Swat games and deleted everything.

I just installed Swat 4 (because that's what I want to play online with) and started it up in v1.0  (I copied the cracked .exe over) online.
Problem was the game room I wanted to join is for v1.1.

So I quit the game, copy the v.1.1 UK patch from the TTS folder, install v1.1, copy the cracked .exe over again, load the game, find the room I initially wanted to join, click join...WOW IT'S LOADING...whoa, wait - CRITICAL ERROR!

WTF!!

I get the exact same message as eMeSaR (but with my name in place of his).

I'm going to guess that the person who uploaded this had the assumption that people were going to play the expansion, and not just Swat 4, because it seems that the cracked .exe is for v1.0, NOT v1.1, so when joining the game, that occurs.

This is ridiculous. All I want to do is play it online with my friends. It's an old game. How a working crack for Swat 4 online hasn't been created yet is beyond me."
,SRB_Knight,2012-02-26T01:09Z,"great torrent, it works good, the games are perfect! "
,TheProFTW,2012-04-24T02:50Z,"Good torrent. Multiplayer works fine, speed was all good, topping my connection (780KB/s), will seed tho"
,iBoxxi,2012-05-20T19:46Z,"1. download the torrent

2. Mount IMG 1 (With Daemon tools)

3. Run the auto installer

4. 75% through installation it will ask for ""CD 2""

5. Mount IMG 2 (With Daemon tools)

6. Click ok, to finish the install.

7. at the end it will ask for ""CD 1""

8. Mount IMG 1

9. Installation Complete, DO NOT register or apply at gamespy when the pop up's show.

10. you SHOULD still have IMG 1 mounted if you followed the instructions correctly.

11. Inside ""My Computer"" you will see the mounted IMG.

12. Right click it and ""Explore""

13 find the folder named ""Cracks"" and copy the .EXE and paste over (Overwrite) the one in sierra/swat4/content/system or WHEREeVER you installed it to.

THAT is your ""NO CD CRACK"" to allow you to play online.

These things are simple. The game is great and only $10 USD maybe you should just buy it. Especially if you dont even know how to use a computer.

If you download this at LEAST SEED it. 24 seeders is sad..... "
,mauzr,2012-07-05T11:51Z,"iBoxxi, what the fucking bullshit are you writing?this torrent doesnt even have separate imgs, just 2 iso files for main game and expansion pack..."
