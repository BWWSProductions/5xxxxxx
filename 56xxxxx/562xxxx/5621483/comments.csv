What's happening to the Mexicans here should be the same for Whites in Africa. It's not their country, so they should leave, just like the sentiment toward Mexicans here in the US. Let's be consistent."

You should talk about thing you carry knoledge of you idiot, i live in S.A. and you clearly have youre head up youre arse.Wait until youre family gets raped or killed. Maybe you will have a opinion then?"
,rummelirutan,2010-06-14T12:01Z,"Tamarind777: The white people in the movie are almost everyone born in Zimbabwe, so they are Zimbabwian, not European or something else. They bought the farm on an open market after the independence and have a deed on the ground. So it's very much their country.

Watch the movie and get informed about the world."

My family have been living in Zimbabwe and South Africa for close on 100 years. the farm they bought in Zimbabwe in the 80s was on open market, and they even had to check with the government to see if it was going to be needed for black redistribution, which it wasn't. we were forced off our farm, not allowed to take anything except a few personal possessions, and not allowed to return! since then, the farm has been striped of all assets, which have been sold by the new ""farmers"" because they dont know how to farm and have no other ideas of how to make money. 3 of the 5 houses have burnt down because they don't have the cash to afford workers, who could have put out the bush fires. 

so you think they are only lacking some money to get going? my family and many others at the time, bought their farms with all they had, and got it going through simple hard work, and a bit of good old BRAIN CELLS!

So dont make up your own opinion based on you living in some nice protected bubble of a 1st world country (probably the US where you racists murdered most of the American Indians, or Australia where you racists murdered most of the Aboriginals, etc etc etc!)!!!!!"

,waxxhopper,2010-12-29T11:30Z,"blacks in SA cant farm because a bunch of white assholes came to their country and abolished their hunting and gathering life styles and put them in camps like sub-human creatures, while the rich whites came in and turned their country into an agrarian style system, which the native blacks were unaccustomed to, and you blame them for not being able to put your monocropping/factory farms to use???? Give them their fucking land back, greedy fucks. your like the little brother who wants to keep the toy he stole because he thinks he can play with it more happily than the kid who owns the damn toy... grow up."
,ofspa,2011-02-01T06:03Z,"Seriously, how can you say Afrikaners don't belong in SA?  How can you say that it isn't their country also?  They have been there for over 300 years.  SA President Jacob Zuma has called them Africa's only ""white tribe"".  C'mon people, read a damn book or something.  Ignorance is NOT bliss."
,ijeffi,2011-03-11T03:32Z,"Let me put it to you this way, if Zimbabweans took over Britain and many other countries forced them to become hunter gatherers and then were kicked out of the country would you want a black zimbabwean who was there because of colonialism related to his relatives to stay?  Leave already and let them do with their country what they want."
,heatsketch,2011-03-12T09:43Z,"Whites didn't ""force"" blacks to become hunter gatherers. That's how the majority of blacks in Southern Africa lived when the whites showed up. "
,zombeatle,2011-06-28T22:22Z,"pardon those Europeans for introducing modern agriculture to a Stone Age population, resulting in a land that not only fed its own people, but those of the entire region (before Mugabe destroyed what was built up).

@Tamarind: quit throwing around the race card card. Neither I nor my ancestors ever killed anyone, never mind entire populations of native Americans. And don't believe the BS that all was peace and harmony until the whites came to the new world.  

PS: I'm on your side as far as the plight of the white Africans go. Let's stick together."

I am English-Zimbo, and when I Mum met my zimbabwean father 19 years ago, she moved back and gave birth to me in the U.K.
Now I live, in France and know virtually nothing about the fatherland I'm very fond of.
So all your points of views can help me know more about myself! :)"

,lordmaker101,2011-12-25T15:40Z,"Mike Campbell - the white Zimbabwean farmer who took President Robert Mugabe to court in 2007 over his programme of land seizures - has died.

Mr Campbell won the case in a regional court but Zimbabwe's government ignored the ruling.

His family says the 78 year old never fully recovered after he was abducted and badly beaten by militants.

His fight through the courts was told in the award-winning documentary Mugabe and the White African.

BBC southern Africa correspondent Karen Allen says Mr Campbell became one of the most well-known names in the white farming community in Zimbabwe.

The tribunal set up by the Southern African regional body Sadc ruled that the land reform programme was illegal and discriminatory but the intimidation continued, our correspondent says.

Many farm properties were burnt and farmers and labourers were chased off their land.

By mid-2008, two days before a presidential run-off, Mr Campbell and members of his family were abducted and taken to a remote military camp.

There they were severely beaten and forced to sign a document to say they would withdraw the case.

In November that year the tribunal ruled in Mr Campbell's favour and directed the Zimbabwean government to protect the farmers' property rights.

In response, Zimbabwe's government said that land reform, one of Mr Mugabe's central policies, could not be reversed.

The president vowed to take more farms and said land issues were not subject to the Sadc tribunal.

When the farm invasions began in 2000, there were some 4,000 farms owned by white people.

To date, only about 300 remain - and evictions - albeit at a slower pace - continue, our reporter says.

you're fuckin retarded. the sentiment against mexicans in the states is directed toward illegals. these white zimbabweans are descendants of those who move to the land legally generations ago. 

more apt analogy will be to remove all white americans from the US and return the land to native americans. 

afre you fucking retarded?"

Nicely said.Was going to say the same thing till i scrolled to your post.
Tamarind777 you're whats wrong with this world you racist bitch.What kind of a fucking comment is ""let's be consistent."" Thats your solution? The American education system must suck ass.
Native Zimbos need to work together with the new generation of white Zimbos who aren't hung up on the past.The finish line for change is in sight."
