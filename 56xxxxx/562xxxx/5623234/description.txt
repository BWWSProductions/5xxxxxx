Los Angeles-based ambient rock outfit Woven formed in 2001 around the talents of Steve Abagon, Rich Abagon, Marc Viner, and Ory Hodis. The group's debut EP, EPrime, drew favorable reviews and comparisons to everybody from the Flaming Lips to Pink Floyd and Aphex Twin. Woven's signature blend of art rock, trip-hop, and electronica was even more apparent on their full-length debut for Interscope, 8 Bit Monk. The band's sophomore release, Designer Codes, arrived in 2008. ~ James Christopher Monger, All Music Guide
