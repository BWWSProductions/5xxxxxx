try converting them with ultra quicktime converter. i was having trouble as well but used that and made them into an avi and it worked well, did lose some quality but very watchable.

i think there is a torrent for it on here"
,jeffro30,2010-06-20T09:47Z,"Good news for those having problems playing the races...yesterday I updated my k-lite version to the latest one and after that I play the 250 Highpoint race and the problems began, it was stalling untill it finally got stock at all...I had the oldest version I was using before, I installed it back and all went perfect, I found out the newest k-lite version have some registry bugs....so I guess thatÂ´s why is not working for a lot of people......the version is working for me is K-Lite_Codec_Pack_583_Full build number v1.3.1752.0, IÂ´ve been trying to upload this but after a lot attempts never work.....so for the moment try to get the version....I will let every know as soon as I upload this version of k-Lite...

I donwload this program ( VLC mp4 player from softonic)  quality looks  great and you don""t have to download any codec or update... very easy to watch the race"
,varela0,2010-07-02T22:45Z,THANKS SLICKNICK from Chili 
,charlestoast,2010-07-05T16:58Z,"Thanks for this slicknick! I made the mistake of going to the allisports.com site, and you don't want to go there if you don't already know the results! Spoilers everywhere! Trouble is, now I'm going to have to wait for your first motos torrent before watching your main ones! As it is, I try to watch the 250 first, because every now and then the commentary team give something away about the 250 races in their 450 commentary....

To those still having playback issues with the 720p files, my recommendation would be to first uninstall ALL codec packs and players, then first try re-installing the latest VLC player. (Freeware) You can often get conflicts and mis-configurations if you have several different players installed and updated with several codec packs, so sometimes you need to go back to zero and start over. It worked a treat for me.

If that doesn't work, completely uninstall VLC and then try Media Player Classic, (also Freeware) along with the latest K=Lite codec pack. "
