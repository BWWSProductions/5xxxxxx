,kareru,2010-06-16T14:39Z,i can't believe there is no karate in this movie
,ppereira1,2010-06-16T16:15Z,"@ APARTHEIDisrael
i'm sorry but i can't agree with you, i rlly liked seeing jaden on this movie, and he must've made a great effort to achieve what he did in this movie...


@ kareru
there is kung fu.. i know it's not the same, but it's a martial art as well... and some movie names don't match the movie it self as well =)



i didn't download this torrent yet, i've got from another source, but since this is the most popular i'll download it just for seed."

The little smith kid is a horrible actor, if his papa wasn't Big Will.. he would never of been cast"

,Thedanishguy,2010-06-16T19:42Z,"Barely watchable... But thumbs up for the fast upload.

Audio: Sounds like it is recorded from some speakers...

Video: Okay, for CAM. Some scenes are very light, and you may want to customize your monitor's brightness."
