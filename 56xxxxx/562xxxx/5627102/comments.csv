,veronika109,2010-06-14T16:27Z,Globe you dickless piece of fuck stop friggin uploading resident shit games and fucking upload mario galaxy 1 and just cause 2 for the wiii
[V],globeplus,2010-06-14T19:36Z,"To veronika 109 : 

I RESPECT SUGGESTIONS BUT NOT BAD LANGUAGE IN THE COMMENTS , MAYBE NEXT TIME I UPLOAD GAMES THAT YOU LIKE AND MAYBE OTHERS DON´T , THE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES IS A FANTASTIC SERIES OF GAMES AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT , DON´T TALK LIKE THAT IN THE COMMENTS , BE COOL !!!"
,veronika109,2010-06-14T20:15Z,"@globe
sorry for earlier i was a bit upset cuz danemark lost against netherland and i approuve it was no way to ask a such hard working uploader like you
I am very sorry globe so please accept my apologies
if you have some spare time can you please rip Super mario galaxy 1 and just cause 2 for wii for dolphin use
it would be awesome 
thanks in advance and keep up the good work
PS:i dont understand what you boys like in RE series but like they say everybody has his own taste lol"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-15T03:25Z,"To veronika109 :

No problem , that game is nice possibility but only when this couple of resident evils starting going nice , never before and it is normal give sometime between new uploads to the files get time to go better as possible .
Sorry if i talked liked that , i tought it wasn´t necessity because they are nice games and if you never played them once you start playing and feel the nice adrenaline that this resident evil series have you simply want to keep playing  and progressing in the game , the game you suggest probably will be uploaded soon but first i want to see this ones going nice , i think the users have to understand to see more nice files coming they have to motivate the uplaoder too showing a correct appreciation for all the work on the files , if you analise correctly in this 4 or 5 wii 4 pc games that i upload , in all of them you can spare a few giga less for a nice number of games , if you get the real wii isos for this games you probably needed close 15 gb , only this last one is gamecube and less size , the way i work the isos in a correct way , you have the same games maybe for close 10 or 11 gb and then in only 5 games , it is a few giga less for the same number of games with wii isos and the games absolutly complete .
Forget the other comment and download and play freely the games you like ."
,Next_Gen_1987,2010-06-16T16:13Z,"Thanks for this game, but this is 2002 GameCube remake, why no RE: Archives for Wii? For me in the main hall is working very slow...(HD5850)"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-17T04:32Z,"To Next_gen_1987 :  the game is the same and that particular slow moment is normal , i get 2.38 gb in the emulator with both discs amd only a fantastic 1.31 gb to download , can i get this iso sizes with the wii version ? 
That slow situation it is just a moment in time inside the gameplay and what a remake of the game we have here ..."
,jetski963,2010-06-18T18:44Z,"thank you for the upload. it works great with a lot of reading and tweaking. brings back good old memories of RE. Is there by any chance you can get the Umbrella Chronicles or Darkside Chronicles?

Phenom II x4 940
3gb 1066 ddr2
Inno3d GTX 260
Win7 32bit"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-18T19:21Z,"To jetsky963 : i have that games and maybe it is possible some work , i don´t have too much time for the moment but the mentionated have a different gameplay then the traditional resident evil games , they are shooting in movement inspired in the first resident evil games and i have more games in consideration to upload too , the true is that the ery nice work needed to get real nice sizes to the files are not beeing well compensated with the correct correspondence from the users , isee with much more size in some cases comparing to my files having much more seeds , it is not the point that i don´t respect the number of seeds and peers in that files but make me thinking in the next thing : it is worphy making a nice preparation of the games for them beeing more light inside the emulator and of course that after a few games makes the user spare a few giga in hard disk space and having the games 100% ok with everything nice , is this type of work with appropriated wii isos to the emulator really appreciated ? or the users don´t mind to spend 3.5 gb or maybe the 4.37 gb for a wii iso ? 
Well , this is only a few thoughts from a uploader that need to do nice work to get the files with nice size , thinking that after a few games , the users start acumulating many giga in games inside the emulator . "

,frienlyfire78mm,2011-07-18T08:22Z,SO HOW DO YOU FIX THE CORRUPTED MEMORY PROBLEM SO YOU CAN SAVE THE GAME.
,pianicata4,2011-07-19T16:10Z,hey you morron just put only the ISO files not many rar files i cant MOUNT THE ISO!!
,himegoto,2011-12-26T11:57Z,"I dont know what kinda of a sick twisted joke this is.
Friend were over and we played this 10+ hours straight and then we figured there's no bloody way to get to disk 2.
Open the gamecube hatch and insert the 2nd disk? Are you fucking kidding me. Yes. I pressed every single key on my keyboard except ESC.

To those who actually play their games, stay away from this bullshit.
And to the uploader, curse you, and your family. Unless you provide a legit way to actually get to disk 2."
,walkthedinosaur,2012-02-16T08:26Z,"why the fuck does it say ""Wii"" if its a gamecube iso?"
