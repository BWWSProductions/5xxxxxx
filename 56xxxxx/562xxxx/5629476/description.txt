Nnenna Freelon - Homefree 
Release Date: April 20, 2010
Label: Concord Records 
Quality: 320 kbps 

Jazz songstress Nnenna Freelon's "Homefree" is relaxing, fluid and organic. Comrising 11 tracks, 10 of which are covers, she displays her impeccable phrasing against a suitably muscular musical backdrop by her able backing band. 

"The very thought of you" gets a tender piano treatment with a beautiful tenor sax solo by Ira Wiggins. "Theme from Valley of the dolls" is lilting and lovely, while "Smile" (which we've all heard hundreds of versions of) is given a lightly bouncy organ/piano/bass-filled treatment with tempo changes and acceleration. 

"Get out of town" has a light Reggae lilt and some delightful scatting and is truly beautiful. "Skylark" is spare with some morose sounding bass, while "Lift every voice and sing" is given a contemporary touch courtesy of a rap (telling us the inportance of music in black history) by her son Pierce Freelon which doesn't sound out of place. 

The lone original is "Cell phone blues", which as its name implies is Blues with humorous lyrics incorporating cell phone jargon ( "I got the sweetest network", "Better pay me some attention, I just might have to roam" or "I'm looking for a lover, on the friends and family plan" ). 

Sparkling and splendid!  ~ Nse Ette
