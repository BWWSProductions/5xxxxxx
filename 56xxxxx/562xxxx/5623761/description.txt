German Velazco - The Cuban Timba-Fusion Project
2006

The origin of Timba, a sound with highly complex rhythmic arrangements, can be traced back to Los Van Van and Irakere. It's no surprise former Irakere reedman German Velazco delivers a Timba album like no other.

Velazco began releasing albums regularly with the turn of the century, culminating in the 2006 recording The Cuban Timba/Fusion Project. The frenetic lines of "Brazo extendido" recall the virtuosity and pure intensity of Irakere, providing an up-beat solo showcase for Velazco. From the off set bass groove underneath the main melody to the funky piano breakdown halfway through the song, "Timbop" lives up to the Timba reference in the album title. The ace rhythm section builds from a sparse stuttering groove into a raging behind Velazcoâ€™s solo on "Latineando," showing some serious jazz credibility. Bassist Roberto Riveron provides an extended solo statement at the beginning of "Nostalgias," leading into a slow guaguanco floating behind soloists. Velazco uses his years of experience in cutting edge music to successfully fuse old school Latin Jazz with the now "classic" fusion sound and contemporary Timba to create an intoxicating mix.
