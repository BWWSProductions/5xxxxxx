,v16,2010-08-18T11:48Z,"Evidently not working.

Runs fine, but will not run diagnostic test or allow profiling, which defeats the purpose of the crack. 

Not worth the download =/. "
,diamondilly,2010-11-18T05:22Z,"I don't know what v16 is talking about, this worked perfectly for me, plus this is a trusted uploader. Just must be flamming.This is worth the download if you need an app like this.A big thank you ilefx"
,some-young-guy,2011-01-22T09:01Z,Is the App in the crack folder/Zip to be pasted into the Program Files folder?  Instructions would've been nice.  I still appreciate the upload though
,some-young-guy,2011-01-22T09:07Z,"Install Application from main folder.  Extract the Application from the Zip in the crack folder to any location then copy it from that location into the following folder;

C:/Program Files/ReviverSoft/Battery Optimizer

When prompted to, select Copy & Replace"
,some-young-guy,2011-01-22T09:25Z,"Installation didn't work for me either.  The cracked App still shows as Unregistered, plus my battery is so dead that it wont even complete an 11 minute scan without shutting down.  I guess going unplugged is no longer an option for me."

,Gabbriel,2011-03-24T16:58Z,Not working with Windows 7 x64
,Jrexxx,2011-03-26T09:17Z,"installed it on win 7 x64, program starts and is considered as activated, but when I try to run the diagnostic freezes and quits..."
