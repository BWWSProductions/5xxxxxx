[V],twentyforty,2010-06-14T08:48Z,"@JoSox: Good morning my friend. I've searching for Tudors from dawn, but nobody have captured so called first airing. Do not worry, somebody would catch late night's airing or one in the next day or so. When one pops-out anywhere, I'll grab it and do as promised."

[V],twentyforty,2010-06-14T15:40Z,"@archeee_08: If you speak Czech, sure. Namely, in some Czech archive is only copy that can be found for free and is dubbed on Czech. Other option is to buy DVD from amazon dot com or ebay."
