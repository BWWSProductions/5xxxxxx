This is a collection of speeches by Michael Crichton (7 .RTF files, 2 .PDF's).  They range in subject from global warming to patent laws to science philosophy.  


These are being shared because, for whatever reason, the late Michael Crichton's official site has stripped most of these speeches.  This is obviously a decision by his heirs, but, when Crichton himself was alive, he chose to freely share all of these with the public at large.  So, sharing them freely is Crichton's real wish, not hiding and/or selling them.

Also, please know that this is NOT a complete collection of Michael Crichton's speeches and articles.  For more, I refer you to:
