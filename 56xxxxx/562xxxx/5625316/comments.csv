In a time when only dude's were playing lead guitar and were the lead singers in almost every rock band, these girls changed rock and roll and paved the way for the female rockers that we listen to today.
I dont know if The Runaways are in the R&R Hall of Fame, collectively, but if they are not, they should be.
Great share neonrainbow. 
Thank you."
