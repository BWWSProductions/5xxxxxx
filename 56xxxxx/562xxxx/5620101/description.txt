Plot 
Mourning the death of his wife, Detective Manfred Fong (Leon Lai) is falling apart. He lives out of his car, sports a scraggy beard and dishevelled appearance, drinks heavily and regularly takes out his pent-up aggression on suspects. His behaviour has attracted the attention of his superiors, and Internal Affairs have started sniffing around.
