Alex Jones Quote of the Day:

"The whole world is going to hell in a handbasket, and the internet is on fire talking about me!"




Today's broadcast starts off somewhat strangely for the first half hout.  Initially there is about seven and a half minutes of music with no voice-over.  Then for the rest of that half-hour comes a rebroadcast of a portion of yesterday's interview with James Delingpole.  After the half-hour break the show is live.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
