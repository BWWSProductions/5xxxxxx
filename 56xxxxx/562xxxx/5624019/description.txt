To mark his release 50 years ago, historian Sean Street investigates
how Ezra Pound, was accused of treason by the US Government and held
for years in a mental hospital after he made a series of anti-American
and anti-Semitic broadcasts in Italy.

The programme investigates the significance of the case today, and asks
whether Pound committed treason or just used his right to free speech.
