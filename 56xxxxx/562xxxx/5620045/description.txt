Soundtrack for the Voices in my Head Vol. 2 (Chapter 1) both meets and transcends the expectations placed on the followup to Celldweller's first album of instrumental soundtrack material. These songs are every bit as epic as those on the prior volume, with thick, pounding guitar riffs that drive the action, sweeping symphonic strings (provided by James Dooley on "The Wings of Icarus") that heighten the emotions, and complex electronic flourishes that embellish and polish the raw power of the songs. However, this first chapter of the next SVH takes the listener beyond the territory of Volume 1 and into new regions of Celldweller's sound; heavy, gritty bass and guitar in "Pulsar" bring Celldweller as close to progressive metal as he's been, and the chapter closer, "Adrift on Celestial Seas", introduces an altogether unprecedented dynamic of peaceful, warm ambience and gentle whispers of percussion that shift and stretch over a twenty minute period, evoking inviting vistas of celestial wonder.

This is no simple stop-gap between distant chapters of the sophomore Celldweller album, Wish Upon A Blackstar, but a demonstration that even as Klayton works on one opus he is evolving and expanding his sound through other means as well.
