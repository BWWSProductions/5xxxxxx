This is a short series of 5 radio plays produced by CBC in 1942, following a Nazi spy in Canada (a true story) as he reports back to his superiors on Canada's specific weaknesses.

Each of the five segments of Nazi Eyes on Canada focused on a real-life family or individual from different parts of Canada (Ontario, Alberta, New Brunswick, British Columbia and Saskatchewan). The first part of each episode would look at what their lives were currently like, and the second part would imagine what would happen to that family or person if the Nazis took over Canada.


Each drama is 30 minutes long

The series stars Orson Welles, Helen Hayes, and Vincent Price among others
