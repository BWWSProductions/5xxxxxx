Must say i do like the Japanese, they cover every field, and do it with style of every rank. Usually before Catholics know it exists. Bless the Japanese, they sure know demons.

Not such a bad flick for the genre, and '86, same great muck as late 70's euro zombie and demon movies (like 'Demons'), when bad was bad, hope was lost and good was forgotten. 

Thanks for this flick, it's genre and hard subs. 
I'll try to find more Synapse re-releases.
...and X in movies, like 'THRILLER: ...'  !"
