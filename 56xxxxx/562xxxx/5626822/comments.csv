,zappoloco,2010-06-16T23:59Z,Everything in this torrent is excellent!
,milnerq,2010-06-18T19:49Z,Please Please seed
,zappoloco,2010-06-19T16:14Z,"dk72:
When I say excellent, numerical rating is superfluous. But for your good shake: V:10, A: 9
THIS is the version to download. Most subs are crafted after it, so itÂ´s a MUST.
DL speed was a bit irregular, though, but maybe itÂ´s my torrent configuration.
Congrats and infinite thanks to Grongebis!"

,jason221,2010-09-07T20:36Z,"This is a TV rip, so it is censored, but only once. The word ""shit"" isn't censored at all, and the word ""fuck"" is only used once in the whole season and it is censored."
,ReliableMike,2010-09-23T10:44Z,Isn't this an HBO show so why would it be censored?
,jonboi19,2010-09-27T23:50Z,It isnt an HBO show. It's an AMC show.
,jonboi19,2010-09-27T23:52Z,It's an AMC show. Mad Men and Rubicon are also on that network.

,elasher,2010-12-23T12:48Z,"Ive followed this tv show on AMC since it was released, and these episodes are out of order.  Who the fuck labeled them? you?"
,elasher,2010-12-24T02:36Z,"One episode Combo gets shot and killed by the kid and 2 episodes later hes magically back alive jacking his parents RV for jesse? Hrmmm no. Fix the order dude, junk torrent."
,thecaptainofsweden,2010-12-25T15:56Z,"elasher..
they stole the RV in the middle of the 2nd season, but what you see in that episode is that White gives jesse the money to buy it.
in the episode after jesse have the RV, but they never showed whats in between.

the part of the episode where jesse, combo and skinny pete is partying and then steals the RV is just a flashback.

check your facts, and have a nice day.
