Senator Ranse Stoddard returns to the city of Shinbone in the Wild West, to go to the funeral of his friend, Tom Doniphon. To a journalist, who's wondering what the senator is doing in Shinbone, he tells how his career started as "the man who shot Liberty Valance". As a lawyer he came to Shinbone to bring law and order to the west by means of law books. When the stagecoach is held up by outlaws, he is savagely beaten by Liberty Valance. He survives the attack and is nursed by his future wife, Hallie. Hallie is being wooed by a local rancher, Tom Doniphon. Ranse teaches the people of Shinbone to read and write, all the while trying to find a way of bringing Valance to justice.

This is a film that I deleted the torrent for when the seeders disappeared, back when TPB allowed uploaders to groom their torrents and do our small part to clean the main database.

This is the same one I uploaded a few years ago.

Audio and video quality are very high for a region 1 dvd rip.

divx converter was used.

I know it doesn't fit on a cd.  With hard drives with terabyte capacities being so cheap, who cares?
