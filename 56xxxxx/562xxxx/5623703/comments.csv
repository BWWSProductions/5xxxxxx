5/-survivor_bot: UTIL_SetModel: not precached: models/ survivors / survivor_biker.mdl 

Anyone has a clou ? This is so frustrating because u can guess which campaign I wanna play the most!? :-(  Well I don't expect help but I'm giving this error report anyway..."
,TheBigHase,2010-06-13T14:04Z,"WTF! What sort of prick are you!? Well actually I don't give a shit about comments like that but I do like ppl who have a big mouth on the internet ! You are strong on the keyboard right!? Hammering your cool comments and offend others is great right!? Do you wank off when u try to hurt others which u didnt this time cos I dont give  a fuck bout you ASSHOLE!!! Being helpful is something else and a thing which havent heard about in your wasted life ,huh!? Die today SOB!!!"

,lollyp,2010-06-16T07:08Z,"hy trimidogg!

can u make a clean version of l4d2 v2.0.2.2 full game?
just simply compressed archive


REALLY THANKS! and have a good day"
,lollyp,2010-06-16T07:29Z,"or installer thats not it does not matter

good bye"
,TheBigHase,2010-06-16T20:25Z,"@trimidogg: I did that but ""The Passing"" still dont work (either loads half then freezes the PC or it CTDs after loading! Everything else of L4D 2 is running fine! It remains a mystery to me..."
,TheBigHase,2010-06-17T13:21Z,"I have now learned on Valve website that there is a prob with the shaders and it's recommended to set them on medium - will try that and give report! Seems that Nvidia drivers are causing this - but I don't understand , what's the difference between ""Passing"" and the rest of the game (graphically I mean!?) .... ;-) Well I'm not a mega - expert!"
,handsomeguy,2010-06-17T20:30Z,how to hoste with sourcemod
,TheBigHase,2010-06-18T10:58Z,"@madwiggy: Since u are so delighted - does ""Passing"" work for u? And if so what did u do exactly to get it all running!? Just to let me know u know... ;-)"
,[SafeGamer],2010-06-18T17:17Z,"The passing doesn't work!
It loads, and after a while it crashes to the desktop!
PLEASE Fix this! I so wanna play this campaign"
,[SafeGamer],2010-06-18T17:33Z,"UPDATE:

I fixed the problem with the passing!
1. Open rev.ini
2. Change the line: 
ClientDLL=steamclient_l4d2.dll
into 
ClientDLL=steamclient_l4d.dll

Now everything works!

,TheBigHase,2010-06-19T16:10Z,"U know what ? Slowly u can kiss my ass with your arrogant comments! I have done all that and tried and tried  and it still don't work do u get that if u think that I'm so stupid!? Answer me: WHY does L4D 1 from madwiggy run perfectly with no probs at all even after several updates and yours is causing so many probs NOT JUST FOR ME as u can read here!? So what , ""God"" ???"
,TheBigHase,2010-06-19T16:28Z,@safegamer: That also did not help - It still crashes with that same error - also if I set the shaders to medium as it was suggested on Valve site that also is no clue for me...
,trimidogg,2010-06-19T18:28Z,"""TheBigHase"" go ask your mom also no one told yo bitchy ass to download this if you like it download it if not go fuck your sister also your not stupid you are a fucking retard remember this name trimidogg or trimi_dogg that's me so don't download from this uploader remember it so you don't have to start wining like a bitch "
,TheBigHase,2010-06-21T15:25Z,Thank god u are not he only gay ehm  guy in the world who puts up torrents! Also I have been friendly and kind and helpful and u sound like being annoyed - why? A lot of people have probs with your game as it can be seen - not just me! So what?  But what do I write anyway - in a world full of  drug and booze addicted  assholes it's hopeless to find clean and fair discussion or conversation! And : Leave my mom (R.I.P.) out of this OK - don't go too far! And I would have to do your sister since I dont have one... :-)
,trimidogg,2010-06-21T20:42Z,your mom died from ?  :D sorry i have big dick R.I.P sad we lost a hoe best 1 i fucked so far 
,TheBigHase,2010-06-23T08:51Z,"OK  Mr. Cool, I have made a report to TPB about you and your polite style of offending! The internet is not as anonym as you might think, my enemy! You are definitely one sick minded guy who is just here to offend others and fool them with complicated or not 100 % working uploads - and above all you do offend and write the dirtiest and most digusting things which have nothing to do with the game nor my or others questions and are not helpful at all - strange huh? If I were you I would REALLY  try to help ppl and give support instead of offending or fooling them , but that's up to you! I say: Ppl read what this ""human being"" writes and make up your mind about supporting him  further on - imo he is a shame for a lot of good guys at TPB! Again: You cannot be serious with what you actually write , but I'm afraid you are... But you are not the only sick guy in this world, unfortunately."

no one asked you to download this i told you Don't download it there is no 100% working thing you have to know how to install also i don't give a fuck if you have a fucked up Computer so fix your own problems "
,TheBigHase,2010-06-24T17:11Z,"Even though I'm angry with you mostly now  because of the Trojan that is in your 2.0.2.3. (what do you say about that!?) you should know that I DID NOT MEAN YOU with that specific comment ! I meant the idiot ""seeknodeath"" who wrote that I should buy the game and stuff and offended me for no reason - NOT YOU! OK!?  So maybe we can cool things down if u wanna but I think your comment concerning my mom was way below zero! Still I am thankful for your efforts to provide us with that nice game BUT what about that Trojan? Please doublecheck it - if u care! "
,mazzstrike10,2010-06-28T03:43Z,"Hey trimidogg, could you please post a video in discreption showing us how to patch the game? i keep fking it up and i have to reinstall L4D2.."
,TheBigHase,2010-06-30T18:30Z,"YES! STRIKE!  Finally a solution for ""The Passing"" CTD after loading with that ""could not find blablabla"" message , see above post of mine!  Start game , go in menu ""Extras"" and to ""Addons"" and then UNCHECK ALL your self installed addons! Doing so  now it works fine for me! Oh I'm very happy to be able to play it at last! :-) "
,Ninis,2010-08-19T21:06Z,other trimidogg's downloads containts TROIJAN!!!!! odd that someone havent sayed enything about this download!!!!!!!
,Hrvat97,2011-04-19T18:36Z,I have a problem. I did that steam dll without # to play mp but always says :ProcName value not found on commandline or in rev.ini. Please edit the file. What does it mean???
