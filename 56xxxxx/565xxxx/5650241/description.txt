All of the BBC's coverage from Day one.

FILES:

Glastonbury - 2010 - Best Bits.mp4
La Roux + Ellie Goulding


Glastonbury - 2010 - Corrine Bailey Rae.mp4
Absolutely no idea who this is :D


Glastonbury - 2010 - Dizzee Rascal and Snoop DOgg.mp4
If you haven't guessed who's in this file from the title, you're an idiot.


Glastonbury - 2010 - Gorillaz.mp4
Glastonbury - 2010 - Gorillaz2.mp4
Glastonbury - 2010 - Gorillaz and Day 1 Highlights.mp4
For some reason the BBC decided it was an awesome idea to spread the headliners over 3 broadcasts...


Glastonbury - 2010 - Groove Armada.mp4
Pretty self explanatory.


Glastonbury - 2010 - Vampire Weekend and Florence and the Machine.mp4
Also contains performances from La Roux, Ellie Gould, Bombay Bicycle Club, Kele (Bloc Party frontman), Mumford and Sons and Hot Chip. (And probably a few more I've missed.)


Glastonbury - 2010 - Willie Nelson.mp4

If you need a video player for them just grab VLC player. It's free and will play virtually anything.

Audio's a bit crap as it's off iPlayer so you may want to stick some extra bass on while you're listening to it.

Enjoy!
