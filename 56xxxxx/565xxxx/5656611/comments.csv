,Tamarind777,2010-08-13T22:37Z,"This doctrine of the rapture is a doctrine of devils and is designed to lead people astray. It is entirely unfounded in Scripture. It teaches contrary to sound Biblical teaching and is very dangerous. It says those LEFT BEHIND will be those who are lost and they will be given a THIRD chance at salvation, the save will be raptured, and that the church will not go through the tribulation. Where in the Bible does it say that the entire lost population will be given a third chance? As individuals, God gives us hundreds and thousands of chances during our life, but not the lost on a whole. Here is the confusion: this left behind lie is based on the passage where Jesus compared His second return with the days of Noah. He said, As it were in the days of Noah, so will also the coming of the Son of man be. In the first part of His statement, He highlighted the decadence that took place in Noah's time and said the same will happen shortly before He returns. That was one point He was making.

Second, in making this analogy, He also compared His second coming with the flood and how it was a time of judgment for the lost of that time. He said, Two will be in the field, one will taken, the other left; two will be in the bed, one taken, the other left. Taken by what? During the flood, how were they TAKEN and who was TAKEN? This is the point of confusion. In the time of the flood, those who were TAKEN were lost, NOT saved! They were TAKEN away by the flood! Jesus said, He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. The ones who were LEFT behind DURING the flood were safe in the ark and were saved. Noah and his family represented the church and DID go through the flood. God never spared them from it. Only that they were safe onboard the boat. If you even compare salvation with the Hebrew boys, they were not spared from going through the fire, but were saved THROUGH the fire. This is clear throughout Scripture.

The doctrine of the rapture is a false teaching that is designed by the Devil to teach people that they will get another chance at salvation, if they don't choose Jesus today they can wait until later and do it then. This is a lie and a trap from the Devil. There will be NO third chance for the lost. In fact, this IS your chance to accept salvation through Jesus today. The Bible says, If you hear my voice, harden not your heart; Today is the day of salvation. People, do not believe the lie of the SECRET rapture, it is a complete lie and it is very dangerous. The Bible says when Jesus returns, there will be nothing secret about it. First, there will be a trumpet sound so loud it will wake the dead. Second, mountains will sway like a reed in the wind, island will disappear, and there will be a tremendous earthquake that will pretty much level everything. This will be a time of such commotion that even the dead will hear it. Does this sound like a secret event to you? In all this, Godâ€™s people will be safe. Trust in the Lord and lean not onto your own understanding. Trust in the Word of God only people, it is the only source of truth for Salvation."
