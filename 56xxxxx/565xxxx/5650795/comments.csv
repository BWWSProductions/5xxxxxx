,IMpapawheelie,2010-06-27T22:16Z,brash84 do you really think you'll be popular when you ruin the ending for everyone. You're pathetic.
,dsantos,2010-06-27T22:17Z,"@brash84
I WAS watching live, but I fell asleep right before Cung Le's fight cause I study, work and train hard everyday, even saturday.
But I'm not mad at you like some other guys here, just felt a little frustrated with the spoiler. 
Peace bro!"
,siroam,2010-06-28T07:17Z,"Thats pretty low spoiling one of the biggest defeats in MMA history like that, Pirating or not."
,Chuvak13,2010-06-28T17:34Z,"Alexander Emeljanenko, recently ??????? bribable fight of the Swede, from any slap was ostensibly the hardest knockout at Benngstona.
And into Feodor's account as sambo-fighter it to understand that it should is impossible to hold hands opened, in it train since small years...
Fight Pity performance, you look there will be a fight a revenge and Feodor will win, owners M-1 are able to gain money."
,xiIix,2010-06-29T07:12Z,"Never, ever, EVER look at comments, listen to the radio or watch TV if you're hell bent on finding out what happens in the fight yourself. I always avoid media when I want to react to the outcome as if it happened for the first time. Sometimes I'll have my girlfriend start the torrent or do whatever is needed in order to see the fight and forbid her to tell me who won if she sees the result while setting it up. There is nothing worse than getting it ruined for you."
,Chuvak13,2010-06-29T16:23Z,"How many money that this Jew Finkilshtejn, lifts on Feodor to which a little that gets and still will see what money will earn during a revenge...
As professional fighter Feodor could not dismiss a hand and give to the Brazilian that that it has untwisted on painful, fight is bought just as also his brother Alexander.
Pride was the real incorruptible organisation not that that this slag."
,fancyfatty,2010-07-01T01:25Z,ASSHOLE for spoiler!!! 
,V.Newman,2011-02-19T08:18Z,"Where are all the seeders ? Do most people just dload their torrent than unplug. If everyone would just seed for a few hours after their dload is done than our torrents would go much faster. 

It's great when you can dload a movie in less than 1 hour instead of slow, torturous 12 hour/All- Nighter dloads.

LET'S DO OUR PART AND DON'T UNPLUG AND EVERYONE... PLEASE SEED TO GAIN MORE SPEED.

CHEERS!!!!"
