Louie is a American comedy television series on the FX network. It stars stand-up comedian Louis C.K. as a newly divorced father raising his two daughters in New York City.  The network has ordered 13 episodes of the series,  which will begin airing on June 29, 2010.  It will be a half-hour production.  His best friend is gay comedian 

The series is loosely based on C.K.'s life, and blends his stand-up material with extended autobiographical comedy short films depicting moments of his off-stage experiences. 

If ?Louie,? a new comedy show written, directed and executive produced by Louis C.K., bombs after its debut on FX tonight, the comedian can?t push any of the blame on his network. C.K. says that unlike other programs, the cable channel gave him complete freedom to pursue any topic or format that appealed to him, which was basically the ?only way I was willing to do it.?

One of the standout scenes from the first few episodes involves the comedian playing poker with his friends and discussing the use of a gay slur. At first just merely comical, the scene quickly evolves into a discussion of the word?s history and takes a decidedly more serious tone. C.K. says the scene ? which took 12 hours to shoot ? is his favorite of the series so far. He broke it down in an interview with Speakeasy prior to the show?s debut.

The Wall Street Journal: You manage to work quite a bit of salty language into your show. What are the language restrictions for a cable channel at 11 p.m.?

Louis C.K.: There are still words you can?t say and other you need to take caution with. The word faggot isn?t something you can just throw around on FX, and we say it a good 14 times in that scene. But we?re doing it for a reason, which is to explore the word from all these different angle. FX is very case-by-base. They?re not bound by the FCC?s standards and practices because they?re not over the airwaves, but there is a person I talk to about this stuff whenever it comes up. There was actually a racier version of the scene where it got worse, but because I wanted to show the episode early [in the run], I cut it down.

Why do you like the scene so much?

I like having people?s expectations not be met ? that?s the fun thing when you?re watching television. In this case, people will be watching and thinking it?s dirty comics making sharp gay jokes, but then they?ll go, oh, there?s a gay guy there so he must be in on it, and then they think it?s a lecture, and then they realize, oh, they?re still kidding and they?ll start to thing about what we?re saying. It?s compelling ? I also think it?s a good way to justify the idea that I?m doing a show about a comedian, because there are a lot of things that we do that people don?t know about.

Still not sure who Louis CK is?  Prior to this new series, Louis C.K. had been appearing in the NBC television comedy series Parks and Recreation, in a critically acclaimed performance as the police officer boyfriend of the protagonist, Leslie Knope.

Ahhh... now you remember him...

Great show.  Grab it and every episode coming up for your TV library.  Shows like this don't come along that often."
