,swinger94,2011-04-26T13:14Z,"1) Download the torrent of Sangokuski + PUK
2) Download the PUK english patch from kongming.net (there's two of them, get the PUK one)
3) Mount San10 Install Disc with Daemon Tools
4) Choose the top button in the menu to install
5) Some unreadable prompt comes up, just guess where the 'ok' button is. The other button is cancel. For the rest of the installation never press the cancel button.
6) Installation stops at 37%. Unmount the San10 install disc and mount the San10 game disc. Click the ok button to finish the installation.
7) Installation of main game finishes, window will close
8) Mount San10 PUK cd with daemon tools, ok to install.
9) There's no switching this time, installation of the expansion should finish.
10) Find where you downloaded your kongming modified San10PK.exe. Find the folder .../Program Files/Koei/San10PK. Copy and replace kongming's file with the one of the same name.
11) Click to start the game and enjoy!

sadly I could not get it to work on vista, it would start up and then crash."
