Guides Viewer Change Log:
* Added / Edited NPCs
* Added: step frame opacity setting, separate from the static 50% used so far.
* Fixed: changing "hide window border" from off to on could cause flickering.
* Fixed: "log" and "event" type quest objectives were displayed as 0/1 even when complete
* Adjusted "window moving boundaries" to allow for moving the window close to screen edge in both top-down and bottom-up modes.
* Fixed a bug that could cause waypoints set from a different continent to never appear even after travelling to the proper continent.
* Removed background texture, replacing with plain colour - Blizzard broke texture resizing in 3.3.3 and there's no working around that
* New internal pointer convenience feature: audio cues. If you leave your character flying unattended for more than 5 seconds, two sound signals are enabled: a 'boat bell' sound if you reach your destination, or a 'zap' sound if you're not flying towards the correct destination anymore. With these, you can start flying towards the destination and Alt-Tab out or go take a break or something - the sounds will attract your attention so that you don't fly off the map.
* Bug Report now includes key ring items
* New internal pointer feature: corpse arrow! Together with not-so-funny descriptions.
* Fixed: error when trying to create a waypoint in a nonexistent zone
* Tweaked ETA calculation to behave better in high-load map marker situations
* Fixed bug with travel steps at the end of a guide chain
* enUS: Added proper singular plurals for "down", "prey" and "vrykul"
* Fix: removed the "legacy" db.profile.GuideName that apparently caused problems to some
* New experimental convenience feature: Manual Waypoints. Click anywhere on the worldmap and an arrow pointing there will be set. Right-click that spot (or advance the guide) to remove. Useful for easy long-distance travel (especially with "audio cues" on).
* LibCamera is no longer supported under patch 3.3.5. Removing support for "camera-aligned" waypoint arrow. Sorry!
