Do a search ""Big Brother UK S11E20""....it is there. 
Sometimes they just dont show up in the daily listings.

This program always makes me laugh...what a great way to end my day. "
,Triplehammer,2010-06-29T23:14Z,"BoonesFerry, I see it's up now - for whatever reason, Day 19 was put up a full day before Day 18.  I do my search as ""big brother uk"" so I see all of them come up.

Thanks to those who put these up!"
