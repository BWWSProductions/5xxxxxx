   Acceleration of Suguri X Edition :

   In the aftermath of numerous wars waged repeatedly over time, the  tattered
   earth was quickly dying.  These devastating wars had not only decimated the
   population,  but  had  basicly  depleted the earth of its natural, precious
   resources.  Some  of the  survivors saw no hope of salvation and decided to
   leave the earth.  They  flew  into  the  skies  to face an uncertain future
   elsewhere.

   Determined to heal the planet,  the remaining survivors stayed behind in an
   attempt  to  repair and revive the ravaged earth.  But  was  it  too  late?
   Nothing that the  humans  attempted had successfully worked.  Humanity soon
   realized that it was  practically  impossible  for  them to bring the earth
   back to life on their own.

   During this very bleak  and  urgent period, a special operation (code-named
   â€œProject Oneâ€) was desperately undertaken, as the humans devoted a  massive
   amount of time to  scientific  research  and  development in creating a new
   â€œbeingâ€ that had the functional capabilities of mending the planet.

   In surprising time,  only  one  person  was  able  to successfully complete
   â€œProject One,â€  however  it  came at  a  great  price . . . the cost of his
   life. The person he used for the  project was a girl named  Suguri.  Suguri
   began her mission to  revive the earth.  She  singlehandedly tried to bring
   the deteriorating planet back to life. Many years went by.

   Eventually, the earthâ€™s  natural  environment  steadily  improved.  Flowers
   came into bloom. The forests continued to grow and spread and even wildlife
   began to reappear.

   The  earth  had  improved  to the point  where even humans were now able to
   become  involved  again  with  Suguri in helping to effectively restore the
   planet.

   Time continued passing by when . . .

   One day,  â€œsomethingâ€  unidentifiable was rapidly coming down from the sky.
   It wasnâ€™t rain. It wasnâ€™t snow.

   It appeared that this â€œsomethingâ€ was actually flying in the sky,  although
   it wasnâ€™t  a  bird or an aircraft.  SUGURI  didnâ€™t  know  what  it was, but
   everyone was worried, so she decided to investigate . . .
