Album Description:

Studio Voodoo's self titled DVD-Audio won the world's first award for DVD-Audio - the "Discus" - Is the worlds first DTS-ES 6.1 release and it remains the gold standard to which all other surround sound mixes are compared.

A conceptual "sound experience," Studio Voodoo (Gary Mraz & Ted Price) mixes elements of world music, jazz, flamenco, opera, techno, tribal drumming, and electronica. Impossible to describe in words, this inventive experiment has been acclaimed by musicians across all genres (from Nine Inch Nails's Chris Vrenna to Mike Simpson of the Dust Brothers.) This aural celebration is a marvel of innovation and intensity.
