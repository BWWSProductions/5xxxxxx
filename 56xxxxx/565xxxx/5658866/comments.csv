,asighkick,2010-07-01T01:53Z,"Thanks for your offer, but I already have X Factor from Season 3 onwards although I am also looking for Xtra Factor and any Specials  for Season 1, 2 and 3 or Best & Worst for Seasons 1, 2, 3 & 4.

Uploading Season One would fill a massive gap, have only been able to find Swedish copies on line so far.

Thanks from NZ"
