brooklyn beach party
dj jonny moiree

(continuous party mix)

starts out with just a few friends chillin' on the roof. catching up on life, love, and last night's party while the grill and the sunbathing heat up. manhattan and monday are far in the distance, and as the afternoon progresses, friends of friends of friends climb up to the blissful tar beach. jonny sips some pimms, smiles, and drops some feel-good summer jams.
