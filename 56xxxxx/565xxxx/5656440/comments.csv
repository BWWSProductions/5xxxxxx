It's not his video player, moron, he's complaining that there are no audio/video files. How he got this far and doesn't understand what archived/compressed files are, is beyond me. Though, I have to agree that this is the dumbest fucking way to upload files. It's a torrent FFS, it doesn't need to be split into a hundred fucking pieces before uploading. It's a pain in the ass for several reasons, mainly because if I choose to watch the movie and seed at the same time, I'm generally forced to decompress it and keep both the video file AND the compressed data on my hard drive. It's redundant and it's irritating. This is why I refuse to seed compressed files. Sorry to be a dick, but that shit is really annoying. "
