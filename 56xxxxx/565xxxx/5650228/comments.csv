It'll be great for a while and then sometimes I'll hear a weird ""pip"" noise, or it will sometimes even SKIP a second or two, especially with ""The Cave"" and ""Blank White Page"".."

,HiroPro2,2011-03-05T01:45Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does!!!"

,mahatma77gandhi,2011-03-18T18:50Z,thanks
,66corvair,2011-03-21T19:14Z,can't recommend this album if you use iTunes. It doesn't have the info properly on. other than that the quality is good.
,Andrew40,2011-03-22T05:02Z,"For quality encoding, CD's should be encoded at 44.1 @ 256/320 CBR Stereo

VBR is only used for broadcasting or streaming. Joint Stereo is not true stereo and destroys the audio quality.

In 1995 MP3 was dropped from the standards in favour for AAC

If you do not believe me, read the standard or at least the wiki pages."

,TheRealD3mon69,2011-05-19T20:48Z,"Thanks loads Horrorspoke, one of the best albums of the last year which is saying something with all the fresh new talent coming out - Although Horrorspoke did you write that description, in which case mate - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

 ""Still, it's a promising start, and once Marcus Mumford develops the storytelling skills of US counterparts"" - Are you mental, if theres one thing we have well above and beyond the yanks , is to produce fresh, new, exciting, different genres and styles of music with lyrics that are genius at times, if you need proof just search Ed Sheeran on youtube. 

Other than that though; thanks very much for the upload, it is appreciated, and thanks to TPB"
