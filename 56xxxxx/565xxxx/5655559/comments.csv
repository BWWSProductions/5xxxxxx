let tater44 do Resident Evil Trilogy since u wanted to single movies cuz u might want let him handle it."
,mrluckyman,2010-07-01T02:16Z,"@omegafox84

don't use DVDShrink just use dvd2one is better since i saw forum that dvd2one is number one and DVDShrink is number 2 software to use for dvd shrinking software."
[T],ctang,2010-07-01T06:31Z,@mrluckyman: what do you mean
,mrluckyman,2010-07-01T12:54Z,"@ctang
never mind you did some series but let tater44 do series of Resident Trilogy cuz u already did american pie series so you gotta let him do it.  maybe you can do other series.  i might going to upload series of tv shows such as Sanford & Son, Martin, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air but it need 1 more season...that's 5 out of 6.  I have complete series of Martin & Sanford & Son."
