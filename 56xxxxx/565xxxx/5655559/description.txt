Runtime.......:  114 mins
Source........:  DVD9 NTSC
Genre.........:  Comedy, Crime, Drama
IMDB..........:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126

Plot++++++++++
An account of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's attempt to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction book The Orchid Thief, which is the story of John Laroche, a plant dealer who clones rare orchids then sells them to collectors. We see the action of the book as we see Kaufman struggle to adapt it into a movie. This is presumably a somewhat true story, as Charlie Kaufman is the real life screenwriter of Adaptation.
