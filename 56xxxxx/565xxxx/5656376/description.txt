RE-VOLT & PhonoSapien Productions teamed up to Present :
The "Real" Arabic Hip Hop Mixed Tape (Vol.1)

The mixed tape simply supports real hip hop. This one includes Arab MC's that I always looked up to and that have elevated my mind.

It also includes Hasan Salaam & Invincible, 2 MC's that I truly respect and that have showed a great solidarity for the situation in the Middle East. Although they are not Arabs; but their passion towards the situation is admirable and must be admired.

This is the start of great things to come and more artists to be featured. Although we all somehow represent each other given we are all after one goal.

DJ Lethal Skillz has been supporting me and I want to give a big shout out to him for actually making this possible.

Also, a huge shout out to all the artists out there that supported me. You have given me so much power and vision. Enlightening my way through.

It's a pleasure having each and everyone of you and Big Up to all the Arab Hip Hop heads out there. This is just Version 1 and the next one would be real big.

Cover info: It simply reflects that we can break BARRIERS through our Music. Our voices can makes us reach high.

Without further delay..you can now listen to the Mixed Tape below..
