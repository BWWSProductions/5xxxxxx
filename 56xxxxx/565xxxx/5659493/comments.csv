anyone finished downloading ?!"
,Baz2017,2010-07-05T13:02Z,"I am seeding mate,
Be patient. The reason its taking so long is because a) file size is heaving b) my upload speed is quite slow c) most people don't like seeding back

Have uploaded 8 GB by now.

Just be patient please, and don't forget to seed once you are (finally) done with your download :)"

Don’t burn!! The planet has a lot of garbage!
I think that longmans corporation put such thing in the web. Doing so, maybe we experienced a lot of frustration... and buy the stuff!"

,drh104,2011-06-22T00:57Z,"working like a charm
for whom didn't work
u have to deactivate the cd/dvd emulator before staring ldoce.exe
if failed
reapply the patched ldoce.exe from the dvd again and deactivate the emulator
i am sure it will work.... :)"
,arnobroy,2011-07-04T06:36Z,How do i deactivate the cd/dvd emulator?
,Sockerdockan,2011-09-01T12:28Z,"Please help me out here, I'm a bit of a dummy. If I follow the instructions and ""Place the cracked ldoce5.exe in the installation directory"", am I thereby replacing the existing ldoce5.exe-file? My computer seems to think so. It wants to either replace the existing .exe-file or add the cracked .exe-file and give it a ""copy-name"" (i.e. add '2' in parentheses after the name. Should I remove the existing ldoce5.exe-file?

Oh, thanks for the download, btw."
