,Scopse,2010-09-04T01:41Z,"thanks!!!

it works great, I've done 3 journeys each over 2 hours long and it's worked fine. even picks up the speed cameras.

I used AppSync on iOS4 and it installed with no problems.

Thanks again!"
,dinkie,2010-09-05T01:12Z,doesnt work. Do i need to jailbreak my iphone?
,Scopse,2010-09-20T01:29Z,"dinkie

yes you must jailbreak your phone, use google.

once it is jailbroken you need to install AppSync from Cydia, again use google.

Then copy this TomTom app into iTunes and sync your phone with iTunes, it'll then transfer the app onto your phone and voila! Job done.

It's still working for me, been using it for quite a while without any issues.

Cheers again for the up!"
