,drumheadz,2010-06-28T19:33Z,Why would you want to dl this disc? It only works on one specific mac mini and if you have it you also have the discÂ´s   
,tall-earthling,2010-07-06T08:57Z,"Hey wow, look it's another comment on the internet made by someone who didn't read the thing they're commenting on.

As the description says, the purpose of these discs is to give those who bought the Server edition of the MacMini an easy means to convert it to a standard Mini (at least as far as the OS is concerned -- they still have the hardware benefits of buying the Server model).

Many MacMini forums have had requests by Server buyers for access to these discs.  And many of these folks have been happy to find these torrents available.

If it's of no use to you, then just move along... move along..."
