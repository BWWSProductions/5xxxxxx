,blackbox_jones,2010-09-23T06:06Z,"A few hours in, the heroic story of Facebook's founding makes me want to projectile vomit.  Facebook is the most obnoxious website I've ever encountered, always greedily pushing for more information.  The creepy turning point came when Facebook sent me an image from my Twitpic and invited me to ""tag my friends"" by identifying the photo.  ""Whose face is this?"" It asked me.  It was the face of Richard M. Stallman, from a T shirt I'd been wearing.

It's my feeling that virtually everything that Facebook does could be done with a smart, high functioning email client.  That would give the user a choice of provider and a lot more control, and prevent this big centralized stockpiling of personal information, that I'm sure many of us are going to regret. 

Maybe I'm just antisocial.  I don't really see the advantage of being in touch with everyone I've ever known in my entire life so we can have a crappy virtual relationship where we trade imaginary farm animals and buy each other imaginary drink.  My god, was everyone I've ever known in my entire life really so lame?   It depresses the shit out of me. "
