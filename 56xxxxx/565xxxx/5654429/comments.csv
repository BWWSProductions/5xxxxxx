You can install these additional fonts if your system does not already have them -


The game reads from these fonts, and the only difference they will make is that the mission history and newspaper cutouts will look slightly different when you install them."

,altrego99,2010-06-28T21:39Z,"It appears piratebay does not support linking to where I uploaded the fonts. Fair enough. If anyone knows a site where I can link, please let me know - do not want to create a torrent for the fonts since it's only 3 ttf fonts - Andy, Pepita MT, Secret Service Typewriter (all three should also be available on the Internet free of cost)."
,Farnum,2010-06-28T22:36Z,Tried playing this on Vista and it would only play in software mode and was extremely pixelated.
,altrego99,2010-06-29T00:09Z,Can you change to the graphics accelerated mode from the game's video options? You should be able to see it if you have DirectX installed...
,slickerick,2010-06-29T14:26Z,"There is a graphics patch for this game that fixes some issues and creates a config file so you can make a custom resolution too.

,altrego99,2010-07-01T15:53Z,"Thanks for the link. Probably I should also note that this already has a patch in place, looks like it might very well be the same patch - but if it is not working for anyone please try the patch mentioned in the above comment."
,scatcycle,2010-10-02T18:06Z,"Can someone please seed? I used to have this game back in the old days, but i lost the disk. I really want to play this again! Can anyone help?"
,Dahoo85,2010-10-08T00:40Z,"Thanks altrego99!! Loved this game and have been looking for a good dl for quite some time.

The game works perfectly well, right after download and extraction on a WinXP SP3 notebook. Will keep seeding! :-)"
,ven1x,2011-04-18T09:50Z,"hey i use win7 x64, and it works, but it doesnt run as smoothly as it should. FPS never exceed 30, and after a while it drops down to 10-15fps...unplayable...
I fixed an issue with forced Vsync on (which makes it stop once ever 2 seconds), but i still get a horribly low fps...using the accelerated graphics mode. 

any suggestions?"
,Philonetic,2012-01-07T06:21Z,"Get CFF Explorer and open the game .exe, click the bottom right where it says ""click here"" in a blue box, set the game to be able to handle more than 2gb of ram.

Right click the .exe, click properties, click the ""Compatibility"" tab on the top, click ""disable visual theme"", ""disable desktop composition"", and ""run as administrator"".  Click ok and try again.

If you still have problems, go update your graphics driver and make sure you have the newest version of Direct X (this is a port from the Microsoft Direct XBox, update your direct X)."
