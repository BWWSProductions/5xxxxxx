Undercurrent (1946)

Newly married Ann (Katharine Hepburn) is desperate to know why her husband,
Alan (Robert Taylor), won't talk about his brother (Robert Mitchum) in this noirish
thriller directed by Vincente Minnelli. But her curiosity turns into obsession after
she meets a young woman (Jayne Meadows, in her film bow) connected to the
family, and as Ann begins to dig into Alan's past, she unwittingly puts her life in
danger. Edmund Gwenn plays Hepburn's father.
