The Game's anticipated The Red Room mixtape. Though it was originally slated to be a special Gangsta Grillz edition mixtape with DJ Drama, Game made an 11th-hour switch and went back to his playa potna DJ Skee, who has been a part of several Game mixtapes over the years.

Skee contributed production to the mixtape as well, making a "Skeemix" of the Compton native's controversial "400 Bars." Travis Barker lends his drums to a remix of the Cool and Dre-produced "Shake."

Game has no shortage of fire power elsewhere in the mixtape. Diddy appears on "Heartbreak Hotel," and Nipsey Hussle raps on the freestyle "Ha Ha," which uses Fat Joe's "Slow Down" beat. Lil Wayne, Jadakiss, The Birdman, Jim Jones, Hurricane Chris and Bizzy Bone all appear. Game also introduces new talent such as Kanary Diamonds and Maad Maxx.

The Red Album comes out on August 24th and features guest spots from Dr. Dre and Justin Timberlake.
