Good to see you back."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-27T15:40Z,"@Stevc: I must second sanyam's move, my friend. You have missed my week old announcement about dropping out few shows: Gravity, Burn N., Royal P.(anties) and few other due to the lack of interest and incredibly long initial-seeding time in excess of five hours instead of 45 minutes. (I was choked by illiterate leechers). It cannot go like that, it completely ruined few days last week and introduced delays... on top of that came TPB blackout.
In short, I am in phase of ""re-grouping"" and re-thinking. I am sure only that True Blood and The Gate would go tomorrow - if TPB allows upload.

Sorry for causing any trouble. I felt that you deserve some explanation, my friend."
,Stevc,2010-06-27T16:18Z,"Hi guys, sorry I didn't see that burn notice was in this torrent, I am using my phone to browse and comment as im not home. Thank you for the explanation 20-40 I really appreciate it. I am glad true blood and the gates will stay on the schedule. I am a HUGE true blood fan, I also like the gates. I think its going to be a good show. Hope you guys enjoy what's left of the weekend.

Cheers
Stev"
