A raunchy comedy from the Judd Apatow and Farrelly brothers playbook, this amusing tale casts Jay Baruchel ("Tropic Thunder") as a rather ordinary airport security worker who can't believe he's landed a seemingly perfect beauty (Alice Eve) as his girlfriend.

Neither can anyone else, so he works hard to convince them as well as himself that he's worthy of the romance. Co-stars include Kyle Bornheimer ("Worst Week") and Krysten Ritter ("Breaking Bad")
