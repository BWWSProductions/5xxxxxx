FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Independent Filmmakers â€œBreak The Rulesâ€ By Giving Away Their Movies With BitTorrents.

Lake Station, IN â€“ July 1st 2010 â€“ Digital Lizard Productions celebrate their three year anniversary by letting the world legally download their movies for free via the controversial BitTorrent file sharing. Starting July 1st, the 2008 no-budget dark comedy â€œThe Moving Menâ€ and the 2009 no-budget romantic comedy â€œAll The Love In The Worldâ€ will be available on BitTorrent file sharing sites.  Digital Lizard Productions even provide a step by step guide on how to download with BitTorrents on the brand new DigitalLizardProductions.com.

Currently there are thousands of pending lawsuits against downloaders who have used BitTorrents to illegally acquire movies online. Voltage Pictures, who produced last yearâ€™s â€œBest Pictureâ€ Academy Award winning â€œThe Hurt Lockerâ€, is leading the illegal downloading hunt by demanding 5,000 BitTorrent users pay a corpulent sum of $1,500 to release them from their suit. With claims that illegal downloading cost cast, crew, and unionized worked jobs all you have to do is look at the numbers. â€œThe Hurt Lockerâ€ had a budget of $15 Million and has reportedly grossed well over $40 Million since theatric and DVD release.

Digital Lizard Productions finds this obscene. All artists deserve the right to be fairly compensated for their work, but the actions of these Hollywood producers are far from fair. With the US and global economy struggling, a consumer should expect to get what they pay for. When downloading music one gets to preview the song, one can read a chapter or two of a book with ease at many bookstores, and when purchasing a piece of art from a gallery one gets to take in its value before buying. Sadly, when it comes to a movie the patron has to take the word of the astute promotional trailer editor. Because of this, Digital Lizard Productions is following the business model of recording artist Radiohead and Trent Reznor and are offering their two genuinely independent made movies for free to the downloading audience.

â€œThese movies are far from perfect,â€ admits Digital Lizard Productions producer Michael Goodpaster, â€œbut most big budget movies are far from it as wellâ€. Digital Lizard Productions doesnâ€™t see this as competing with the larger companies. Their movies are generally under $500 in budget, are cast with local aspiring actors and friends, and shot on location wherever they can within a reasonable driving distance. The stripped down production and production quality are far from the Hollywood standard but that doesnâ€™t seem to bother Digital Lizard Productions. â€œItâ€™s understandable that viewers will be taken back by the no-budget productionsâ€ agrees Michael Goodpaster, â€œbut at the end of the day we just want to share the evolution of our art and entertain people in the process.â€

Their goal is 5,000 downloads. BitTorrent download links for both â€œThe Moving Menâ€ and â€œAll the Love in the Worldâ€™ as well as a â€œhow toâ€ guide are now available at DigitalLizardProductions.com

The free media content of the newly relaunched DigitalLizardProductions.com does not end there. Along with their first two movies being released free to the downloading public, the company also releases their first web series; a 1980â€™s late night talk show titled â€Nocturnal Emissions with Steven Thomas Darrellâ€, a series of Blogs on various entertainment topics, select tracks from the live concerts they have shot in the past, and much more.

About Digital Lizard Productions:

Since creation in 2007 DLP has released two full length feature films, filmed dozens of concerts, and have completed numerous other media projects. With many more independent film releases in various stages of production, more original web seriesâ€™ on the horizon, and other plans Digital Lizard Productions seeks to maintain their â€œdo-it-yourselfâ€ independent mentality while gaining more exposure for the time and talent put in to these projects.
