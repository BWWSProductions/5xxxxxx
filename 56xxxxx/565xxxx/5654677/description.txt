Hanger DvDRip XviD by LKRG

From Ryan Nicholson, the acclaimed writer-director of the cult hit Gutterballs, comes this gruesome horror tale in which revenge is sweet and sick and twisted and definitely served cold a balls-to-the-wall story of vengeance and murder that rises to new heights of perverse action and macabre behavior. Eighteen years ago, nine-months-pregnant Rose (B-Movie Hall of Fame acting legend Debbie Rochon), a wrong-side-of-the-tracks prostitute, was killed when her pimp gave her an abortion with a hanger. Now, the deformed, surviving child (Nathan Dashwood, TV s Smallville ), who was thrown in the dumpster, left for dead and mockingly called Hanger, is about to settle the score and any street trash, sex degenerate of murderous pimp better beware. Reminiscent of low-budget classics from the like of directors Lloyd Kaufman (who appears here as Melvina the Tranny) and Herschell Gordon Lewis, Hanger carves a brutal and tasty slice of blood and guts in which no one is safe, no matter how fast they can run or how loud they can scream. This collector's version features over one hour of bonus material!
