BUT
What is the damned Password for ""Paragon Disk wiper"" and ""Paragon Backup & Recovery 10 Suite""?"
,chitchatid,2011-10-01T22:32Z,"cool man. how do you do it? compiling with a command prompt? great... great... i haven't tested it yet.

i have a delicate situation. my pc is built for vista. but i insist upon using ide hdd as the system drive. after installing the wxpsp3, uncompleted yet, the system return annoying error: ""A disk read occured. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart.""

i learnt that it is the hardware and software issue from the beginning. the pc only read BCD (Boot Configuration Database) to boot.

as the mobo fails to provide IDE/SATA  controller, i add on a PCI card with ALi chipset having ALi ATA/RAID  Controller and ALi SATA/RAID Controller. such pci card can be operated without any windows driver. they are not produced anymore.

the issue is: any bootable winpe cd cannot detect the hdd connected with such pci card, including:
1. Acronis True Image Home 2010 and
2. Paragon Hard Disk Manager 2011 Suite Advanced Recovery CD.

this sucks. i intend to keep such 'mighty' and 'obsolete' pci card preserved and reserved but as the emergecy calls.

can you address my issue?
thank you for the upload. great jobs"
