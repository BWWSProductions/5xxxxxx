Ben, the creator of this awesome music, was cool enough to re-encode his music, and make it available for me to download!

According to the email he sent me, all his original works were recreated losslessly, but the two remix tracks are merely re-encodes of high-quality MP3s given to him by the remixers.

From his site:
"Music isn't simply a conglomeration of noise and sounds. It's a visual landscape translated by our eardrums. Each listener sees their own unique vistas and composes their own stories to the rich and melodic sounds contained in this album.

Nature's Echo is a culmination of the experience I gained from other short-run albums. This is an aural journey from slow sonorous ambient sounds to melodic breakbeat and drum & bass."
