You're working on Sopranos! That would be great! I was looking for a decent rip of ""the sopranos"" for ages. 

If time permits, do upload ""Mad Men"" series. Please add it in your probable uploading list. "

,Axuse,2011-03-26T01:26Z,Is it like a 720p?
,ClassicsOnly,2011-05-09T13:09Z,"Note to downloaders. Although the image would give the impression this is an HD disc rip, it is actually from a TV source, with the ABC logo displayed in the bottom right corner throughout, a TV14 box in the upper left-hand corner after every commercial break, and some slight edits for television, mostly in the dialogue.  With that in mind, it is a very high quality rip of a great movie."
