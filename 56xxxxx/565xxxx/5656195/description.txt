The Adventures of Milo and Otis is a live action Japanese film about an orange tabby cat named Milo and a fawn pug named Otis. The original Japanese version was released in 1986, and the reworked English language version was released in 1989 in the United States.

Initially filmed as Koneko Monogatari (å­çŒ«ç‰©èªž A Kitten's Story; alternate English title: The Adventures of Chatran) in Kitakyushu, Japan, the film was completely revamped, trimmed and westernized with added narration by Dudley Moore (Shigeru Tsuyuki narrated the Japanese version). Director Masanori Hata and associate director Kon Ichikawa edited the film together from 400,000 feet of footage (which is roughly 40.3 hours), shot over a period of four years.
