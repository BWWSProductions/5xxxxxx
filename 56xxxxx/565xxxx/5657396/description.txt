Rugrats: Tales from the Crib: Snow White

2005NR119 minutes

The charming little Rugrats put their own hilarious spin on the beloved fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." Snow White (voiced by Susie Carmichael) enlists the help of her petite pals (played by all the "babies") to go up against a vain queen, a role attacked with gusto by -- who else? -- Angelica Pickles. Instead of marrying the handsome prince, Snow White wants to prove that friends are much more important than objects â€¦ or beauty.
