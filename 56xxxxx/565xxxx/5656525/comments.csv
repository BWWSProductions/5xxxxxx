Video quality is ok, but there are no English subtitles available, sadly. Could not find a subtitle pack on any of the subtitle sites. Good project for anyone who speaks both languages well and wants to contribute to open subtitle genome. I found the complete box set of eps.1-26 w/Eng subs for sale for $42 on playtech-asia.com, so I'm just gonna risk credit card fraud to get a good copy and support (who knows, maybe it'll encourage them to create a season 2 if enough people support this one)."
