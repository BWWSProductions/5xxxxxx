,zakulaz,2012-03-04T19:24Z,"I've installed skullptura's cod4, then copied .imw files into the main folder, and when I try to patch the game after a while the installer tells me that the patch has already been installed. Yes, I have patched this game before, but I did it without these files, so I had to delete the whole game and try to install it once more."
,mains3rv3r,2012-03-25T08:09Z,Understand that some servers need an actual key and are not private. You will have to find another server to play on. Try different servers.
