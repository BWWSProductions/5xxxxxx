The New Scooby-Doo Movies (sometimes called The New Scooby-Doo Comedy Movies) is the second incarnation of the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. It premiered on September 9, 1972 and ran for two seasons on CBS as the only hour-long Scooby-Doo series. Twenty-five episodes were ultimately produced (sixteen in 1972 and nine more in 1973). This was the last incarnation to feature Nicole Jaffe as the voice of Velma Dinkley due to her marriage and retirement from acting
