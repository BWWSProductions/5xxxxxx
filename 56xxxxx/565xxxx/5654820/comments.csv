,rrhbomb,2010-07-11T11:51Z,"ambrosiothethird;nIf your using Utorrent the red arrow means the tracker(s) are down and/or dead. Not to worry the (DHT), local peer discovery and peer exchange should keep you running. Also using the magnet link loads the torrent without any trackers. I\'ve started doing this largely without any problems."
