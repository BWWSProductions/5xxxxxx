Windows XP Activation

I recently had a problem with Windows activation, when I boot up my computer, I get a message that says "Your Windows product must be activated within X days." It asks me if I want to activate and I click "yes." However, it says "Your Windows product is already activated." but if I reboot the computer appeared again this mensage.


After some research I found the solution!

This is the solution for people with same problem:


The first thing you need to do is click on Start and then Run.

Now that the Run application is open, type regedit and then click the OK button.

First, locate the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder under My Computer and click on the (+) sign next the folder name to expand the folder.

Continue to expand folders until you reach the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareMicrosoftWindowsNTCurrent VersionWPAEvents registry key.

Click on the WPAEvents folder once.

In the results that appear in the window on the right, locate OOBETimer.

Right-click on the OOBETimer entry and then click Modify from the menu that drops down.

Now select any part of the OOBETimer value by double-clicking on it and change for any number. For example: in the Third part change for 25, what thou wilt!

After that close the regedit and use the "Windows XP Activation" that you just download.
