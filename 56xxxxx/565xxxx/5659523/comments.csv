Here it's working fine, otherwise I'll not be able to reach TPB from my country. You have to choose another IP Country if the first one doesn't work for you, as the programs selects from a list of proxies, and not all of them are too good. But be aware that you always loose some speed, this kind of programs is used to reach sites otherwise unreachable, if they are ""clean"" better not use any proxy."

This kind of programs work only for browsers like IE, Firefox and similar, and don't mask your IP on torrent clients and other similar progs. They are there to allow to reach internet sites that are blocked for any reason from your country, and they slow also down more or less your speed. If you want to hide your IP also from jdownloader and similar you should use VPNs, but they are paid services from specific sites."
