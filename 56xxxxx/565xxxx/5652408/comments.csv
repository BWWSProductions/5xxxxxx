,cnuum,2010-10-31T10:33Z,"Missing the last piece from the file peru-7-south-coast.pdf, which is a whole chapter of this book. Otherwise works fine and is high quality. If you need all chapters, go buy the book."

,dutara,2011-05-16T15:16Z,"For those stuck at 99% thereâ€™s hope!  There is only 1 incomplete file, peru-7-south-coast.pdf
1)	Make a copy of this file, just in case something goes wrong.  Keep the original aside and use the following rules on the copy
2)	Go to www.pdf-tools.com and download an evaluation copy of 3-Heightsâ„¢ PDF Desktop Analysis & Repair Tool
3)	Install the repair tool
4)	Use the tool to repair the file
The end result should be what seems to be a pretty complete version of the file, though the first page may be at the end of the file (thatâ€™s what I got) and the file will have a watermark because you used an eval version of the software.  This should not get in the way of being able to read the info.

Good luck and happy travels to all.  Coincidentally, the chapter in question is about an area where a friend of mine, big guy from Spain, got robbed at gunpoint in broad daylight while lying on the beach. This was in Pisco.

,senroeash,2012-04-23T11:00Z,"Thanks to Datura for the tip. To update that info you don't even need to download anything. Go here
https://www.pdf-tools.com/osa/repair.aspx and use the online version to repair the file. 
Also, if you are not going to the south coast, then it doesn't even matter, as the rest of the files are fine as they are :-)"
