,as14ever,2010-07-03T19:24Z,"Movie request to any one that can do it. I have a request for some very hard movies to find as mpeg4 BRRip H264 AAC3 in resolutions: 1280x544 or 1280x720 or even 1920x1080p

The Movies are: Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "

Pan's Labyrinth
Crank 1 & 2

:)"
,evildrugmonkey,2010-08-05T13:15Z,"Superb quality. Thank you,"
,the_junkman,2010-08-30T00:38Z,Best British film of the year so far. Nice to see the chav hoodie scum getting what they deserve for a change. We need to round up the anti-social underclass in the UK and exterminate them like the fucking vermin there are. Get Carter fans will love this. Stroll on Harry Brown!
,suisenbenjo,2010-09-03T09:20Z,"This isn't 1080p
The preview says 1440x612 and the screenshots are that size
Bigger than 720p but smaller than 1080p
As for quality, 1.7GB(1937kbps) is pretty bad
I don't see a reason for such low quality rips"
,carlito4466,2010-09-04T19:40Z,Can anyone explain why its a 1.72 gb but requires 30.9gb of disk space when copied?
,Aciaeiig,2010-10-14T19:49Z,Releases like this is for people who like highres but don't have that good bandwith..
,Muianescu,2011-01-31T13:25Z,"Thanks for the torrent, perfect quality for such dimension. Who don't like must buy the HD from the store or see the movie in cinema!"
,aSARCASTICpirate,2011-01-31T22:17Z,"1080p or not, This is just sexy quality just for my laptop "
,bonemalone,2011-02-14T19:36Z,"First of all, people need to learn that ""1080p"" or ""720p"" DOES NOT MEAN THE ACTUAL RESOLUTION!

It means it comes from a 1080 or 720p SOURCE!!

Secondly, what carlito4466 said is strange. It doesn't take 30 gb here. Bet there's something else going on at carlito4466's computer.

And last thing I wanna say: Hhiiimmmm and suisenbenjo, 1.72GB can be nice with the right settings. Heck, I remember many many years ago before bluray was out, I downed a DVD rip which was 699 mb (Coyote Ugly for all we care) and it had SUPERIOR quality!

If you think bigger filesize = better quality, you are fooling yourself. I've been disappointed in the past with poor picture quality on large rips. Bad settings for ripping are to blame. Anyway, we get this stuff for free, and I appreciate that some people try to keep a smaller filesize while aiming for a more than ok quality for people like me who don't want to buy yet another storage HDD.
In the end if you want true supreme quality with 1080p and digital 7.1 surround, buy the bluray. That's what I do when I really really REALLY love a movie."
,Khyrian,2012-05-01T23:24Z,"This one actually has great visual quality for the small size. Bit washed out colours, but might be the source. V=8/10 I'd say."
,jarooko,2012-06-07T13:03Z,"I have to say that I am absolutely astonished by this rip. Great V/A quality, additional audio (which I don't need, but still...), loads of subtitles, cover... I mean, great work, man, absolutely great work."
