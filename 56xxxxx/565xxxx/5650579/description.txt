This is my first torrent, I will seed until seeded well enough and then maybe some more.

The torrent is a collection of roughly 300 Star Wars models for 3DS-Max but you can probably import them into many different programs like Bryce for example. There are vehicles, faces, etc so check it out.

The files originated from www.heroturko.org and were put together by a team called media-down I think. Something like that.

I only have 100k upload speed so initial seeding will take a little bit of time.

Enjoy.
