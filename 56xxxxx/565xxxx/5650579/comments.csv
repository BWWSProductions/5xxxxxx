Any ideas anyone?"
,3-click,2010-06-27T14:38Z,Switch off the initial seeding and enable PEX+DHT. 
,KillTheNoob,2010-06-27T15:25Z,"Thanks 3-click, it seems to be running nicely now. I had turned off Peer Exchange earlier when I was trying different options, I also have Local Peer Discovery off but have turned PEX+DHT on.

Would it be ok to turn on local Peer discovery now you think? I'm not going to touch it all right now since it is seeding at max speed and I just want to get the file out asap. Back to Lego Harry Potter for a bit."
