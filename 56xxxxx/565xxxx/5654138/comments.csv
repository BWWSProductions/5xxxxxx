,solari1,2010-06-28T15:57Z,Why was episode 1 posted -twice- as episode 2?
,crlench,2010-06-29T03:36Z,This is crazy. Can you please download the real episode 2. I can't find it anywhere.
,geekxlover,2010-06-29T07:43Z,"I think it was a mistake that TvTeam uploaded this one - it's marked at E02, but it's Episode 1! Look forward to seeing the real Episode 2 up here soon! :) Thanks! "
