,retardoface,2010-06-30T04:42Z,"hey HMVinyl i got some vinyl rips that sound amazing may upload them if you want to hear and compare to yours , cause honestly these ones sound rediculous and i can't figure out why they sound superior to yours. Not to say yours aren't good.     Heres a list of the best ones: Bob Marley & The Wailers - Legend, Supertramp - Crime Of The Century, Pink Floyd - Final Cut, actually they all sound amazing buat lol, Steely Dan - Can't Buy A Thrill, Pink Floyd - Meddle, Pink Floyd - Dark Side of The Moon, Metallica - Black Album. "
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-30T10:56Z,"throw on crime of the century (stick the link here so i don't have to look for it :P), i've got that one here aswell so i'll try and ""match"" this ridiculous quality :P

from my experience, it's all about the tt. i bet if i had that $5000 crystal pro-ject tt, my rips would sound better than anything."
,retardoface,2010-07-01T03:55Z,"if youd like to do direct comparisons i also have Fleetwood Mac - Rumours, Led Zeppelin 4, Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon 192kHz 24 bit, best sounding version i've heard, and 96 kHz ones too, Peter Frampton - Frampton Comes Alive!"
,ncwm,2010-07-01T19:00Z,"Hey retardoface, Upload them here so we can compare the quality! "

There it is buddy, may take a while to seed my internet blows cawk, buat ya for some reason your torrents are alot louder, may be the vinyl these ones is higher quality or something their doing in the process thats better, or may just be like you said a better crystal pro-ject tt"
,retardoface,2010-07-01T19:48Z,"is there a way to quicken your uploading, without opening all my ports"

,DarkenedSkies,2010-07-29T15:17Z,seed please
,MThesis,2010-09-01T04:11Z,"retardoface, this rip is quite good, quality is great, it's just that sound is low, but you can fix it with normalize/add gain, any decent player has that option. ^_^

Thanks HMV. "
