,resonator,2010-06-27T12:10Z,"Demonoid listed this upload around 20:00 CET yesterday. Anyway thank you tdmk1, here in Sweden we can only watch the qualifying and a summary of the race."
,tdmk1,2010-06-27T12:35Z,"Would have uploaded this to TPB yesterday as usual, but the upload verification was broken here... :(

I did upload to Demonoid as usual..."

,io23,2010-06-27T18:33Z,"Hey dude!

Just thought you might want to know (what I really mean to say is I certainly AIN'T b*tching!) that the aspect ratio is a bit off. More like 640x400, or something... Could be a problem on my end though.

And again thank you, thank you, thank you!!:D"

,suskotidzo,2010-06-27T23:09Z,"Sincerest thanks TDMK1. Your uploads are always the best (""late"" or otherwise)."
,YiNG_YaNG_6o4,2010-06-28T05:04Z,"Fetal19... no one will ever give you an invite to demonoid.  you are a piratebay user for a reason.   cuz you're nothing but a fucking leech.  thats all you... leech leech leech.   once its done downloading ... remove torrent and never share and return the favor.    the only thing you know how to do is complain about why free stuff doesn't work for you and get mad.  damn leech.   i have a question for you....  what's your upload/download ratio?

oh wait ... nevermind ... i clicked on your name and saw how much you give back to the community."
,io23,2010-06-28T05:07Z,"Thanks Fetal19, I'll look into it (using kmplayer). My player claims it's showing me 640x352 but if I manually change the 352 to 400, the picture looks ""right"".  Go figure..."
,face_kicker1,2010-06-28T05:57Z,Outstanding! Thank you a million times!
