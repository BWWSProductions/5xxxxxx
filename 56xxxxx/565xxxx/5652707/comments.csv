,michaelfierce,2012-07-01T08:47Z,I realize this is a coupla yrs old but I hope you will seed. No one else has the japanese version with english subtitles and magnet don't work.
,michaelfierce,2012-07-01T23:22Z,"well. it looks like it's gonna take 2+ days to dl but i do appreciate it. i just axe that you keep seeding, please. man, you are either on the moon or you gotta change your settings. you using a 1971 Honeywell 316 or sumthin?"
,michaelfierce,2012-07-01T23:37Z,wow. i'm stuck at 0.3%. sad.
,michaelfierce,2012-07-03T01:39Z,"dood, you're hella weak. i see that you are online all day and everytime i start back up your default settings start seeding with no problems. then you see that you're seedng & you close off your connection. helllllllla lame. why put up torrents & keep the files ready to go if you aint going to seed? take this off piratebay. there's nothing wrong with my computer or my client or my settings. i've been able to dl and help seed with no problems so dont' try to blame any of it on me. you're lame."
