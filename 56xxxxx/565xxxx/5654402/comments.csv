[T],jonnoel1,2010-07-04T00:16Z,Yeah...one of the best ep's I think they have made so far...LOL
[V],albiondean,2010-07-04T23:01Z,"Hey you cheeky git, re- uploading my cap

[T],jonnoel1,2010-07-06T00:00Z,"Yes, and I gave you the credit for the rip in the description.

This is a sharing network, right?"
[V],albiondean,2010-07-06T12:17Z,"Yes it is sharing network, but it's already been uploaded on this site, so why re post it ? and as for crediting me, you've edited that description since i saw my cap here there was no mention of me before. It just don't make sense to post it twice on the same site."
[T],jonnoel1,2010-07-06T13:10Z,"Sure it does....its called SHARING. I don't knw if you have looked around, but youre not the only person on this site that has this episode, it has been uploaded, copied and reuploaded many times, and so have the other hundreds of Top Gear episodes. People have reuploaded my top gear seasons and I'm not crying about it, the more people that have access to it the better! This is a P2P network, and thats how it works."
[V],albiondean,2010-07-12T08:40Z,"People have reuploaded your top gear seasons, lolnnThey are all scene releases, lol"
[V],albiondean,2010-07-12T08:50Z,Any way all i\'m saying is its a bit daft thanking me for my cap and then re-uploading it to the same site. lol just a waste of time and bandwith. btw nobody else re-uploaded it here at TPB the rest are scene releases.
[T],jonnoel1,2010-08-05T21:55Z,Kinda funny...I didnt realize you paid for your bandwidth on here...
