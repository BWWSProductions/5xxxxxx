,nebulous61581,2010-07-19T03:28Z,Thanks for the torrent! Tried getting it at the library but too many holds. One question tho ... what order do these files go in? 
,Rachel306,2010-07-21T09:46Z,awesome job!! The multiple files is a little inconvenient... but easily fixed with an audio joiner. THANKS!!
,kimjongwill,2010-12-16T11:37Z,Can you please add the first two audio books as well? I can't seem to find them any where. Thanks!
,akicita,2011-06-25T18:41Z,"Is it just me, or are disks 6-9 empty folders? (#6 has just one 4mb file)"
,akicita,2011-06-27T06:56Z,"Also, Disk 2 has several places where it skips. "
,corinthianblue,2011-07-31T14:00Z,I was wondering if there was a playlist or something for this? All the tracks are out of order
,glofearth,2012-03-14T15:14Z,Thanks! If you put a zero in front of disks and tracks 1 through 9 it would put everything in the right order
,lilynthorns,2012-03-26T04:34Z,"Okay, the torrent was quickly downloaded which was great, but when I saw the files, they were all mixed up and jumbled which caused some problems. Especially if your plunking them into your iTunes.

Problem #1
First, once this finished DLing, which was quick, I found out that the folder labeled as Disc 1 had no disc labeling order within the mp3 files. So I changed them but then found out the folder entitled Disc 2 had files labeled as Disc 1!!

Problem #2
When I changed that, I found out that HALF (!!!) of the MP3 files were named ""Disc __ Track __"" and the other half were named first 3 or 4 words mentioned by the narrator. 

So I had to go through the CD files 2,5,7,8,9 and rename them all so that they could be organized and match the remaining disks. Which was annoying. This is a BOOK dude! It's kinda necessary to keep the files in some kind of ORDER! If this was an album, I wouldn't give a flying fart but you need to decide just how your going to organized your torrents because this was just sheer laziness.

Also the unnecessary folders within folders were slightly obnoxious so I had to get rid of those. But they were the least of my worries.

My tip for anyone is that you should follow the original file folders in the beginning and use them as a guy to know what MP3 is on what disc.

This audio book better be in perfect condition for the time I had to spend organizing them all!!!"
,ammes42,2012-03-26T05:12Z,Is there a way to get this book with the files seperated by chapter?  144 files is too crazy.
,sjtank,2012-04-20T05:58Z,"as other noted, poor track naming conventions used and unnecessary folder structures.... which can be fixed with some effort.

However the tracks encoded with skipping cannot and it starts in disk 1 track 13. "
