This is a video game based on the television series Duckman.
I had a really hard time finding it on the Net, as it is very rare, a physical copy is almost impossible to find. I found a torrent here on TPB, but it has no seeds. I managed to get this .iso after weeks of searching, so I decided to make things easier for others.
This is a great game, so for all those who were searching it in vain, adventure game fans or perhaps those who watched the series, have fun playing this rare and very well done title!
