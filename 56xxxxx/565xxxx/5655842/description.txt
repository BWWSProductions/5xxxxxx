Gunny gets a first-hand look at the "rocket's red glare" as he demonstrates rockets dating back to ancient Chinese to today's state of the art self guiding missiles. Weapons include: the ancient Korean Hwacha--a rocket powered weapon designed to launch a volley of deadly arrows; The Congreve--the rocket that inspired the Star Spangled Banner; the TOW--one of the first "guided" rockets, 
and today's state-of-the-art Javelin.
