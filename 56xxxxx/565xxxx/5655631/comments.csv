There is some compelling info but the whole thing feels like a huge infomercial. 

I'm not going to pay +$100 for an infomercial.

WTF? You give me all these facts before and now you are giving me your opinion of the bible??? What the hell is this? Now it's a bunch of horseshit.

No need to worry about that, facism is heading your way, that's big corporations controlling your government, $> well being of the people. Even Obama, the so called ""Democratic president"" is less liberal than the Republicans give him credit for, if Obama headed the Republican party- they'd worship the guy like Reagan. Almost...But he's black!"
