Bruce Lee was an enigmatic, legendary figure at the time of his death in 1973. 
His popularity has never waned and this documentary on the black belt movie star 
attempts to explain some of his magnetic appeal. Included in this biographical 
film is footage of The Game of Death, the film that Lee was involved in at the 
time of his death. Pieced together by Lee aficionado John Little, the film s 
finale is a flurry of images of the master in action for over 30 minutes

Rated 8.3 / 10 Stars at IMDB

Things to love about this film:
* The Game of Death sequence, fully restored, edited and soundtracked to Bruce s 
wishes (according to recently found production notes)
* The one finger (and a thumb) press-ups
* The one inch punch

Truly awesome and 10/10

Bruce Lee s life, philosophy, and final film are examined in this reverent 
documentary, which traces the master s path through the development of his 
own style, his battles with mainstream Hollywood and martial arts traditionalists, 
and his emergence as the world s top box-office draw. Just as interesting as Lee s 
life is the chance to see lost footage from The Game of Death, Lee s final, unfinished film. 
Outtakes offer the opportunity to see Lee s perfectionism in action, and the reconstructed 
storyline reveals how Lee s personal martial arts philosophy shaped the film. And yes, 
there is a spectacular nunchakau fight. Interviews with Lee and those close to him highlight 
his energy, intelligence, and remarkable charisma. Fans of Lee will welcome this new insight 
into his filmmaking, and those unfamiliar with his life and work will come away with a new respect
