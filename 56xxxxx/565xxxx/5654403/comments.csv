,Xorkrik,2010-06-28T22:35Z,"Daleskill, sanned12, ihj09, yatyy123 is all the same person. Who happened to upload a torrent of season 5 at roughly the same time as this one. And for some reason felt the need to try to discredit this one. There is no virus. And noone has even downloaded the torrent completely yet to have scanned it yet anyway.

But I'm doing my best uploading at 4 MB/s."
,b.s.101,2010-10-10T05:07Z,I'd rather not risk a trojan just going on your word.
,psmaniac,2010-10-15T21:38Z,"A trojan in a video? You guys really have no idea how computers work if you believe that.
The OS doesn't scan mkv files for a PE header, so even if the old exploits that could run the virus without having to open the file are somehow not removed you'll be safe."
,Backitup,2010-11-21T03:46Z,"Holy F, WTF, what are you guys making money off of this?!?!?! What is wrong with you two?!?!

Who freaking cares what the other guy thinks about the format!?!?!? Who cares if some people don't want to download you're torrent, is it cutting into your profits? Do you get some unforeseen money from people choosing to download your torrent verses somebody else's?

And as for you ""Trolkan,"" Geez, iust be glad that there's a larger variety of torrents out there.

It completely sucks when only one valid torrent is left out there for something because it's usually corrupted or has some sort of virus, meaning you can never get a hold of what you're trying to get a hold of.

No offense to you Xorkirk, you're just the unlucky guy/gal caught up in between these two morons.

stop bullshitting "
,randomapps,2011-02-04T14:09Z,I am going to seed as long as i can
,cod0rama71,2012-02-17T01:42Z,These only work with VLC media player and i need ones that work with windows media player so that i can have them all in a playlist and watch them one by one. All is a waste of my time.
,darkness1337,2012-06-21T10:19Z,"@cod0rama71 Hey you should try Media Player Classic instead. Plays mkv files fine with subtitles, and you can have playlists :) Well sort of, if you choose to play a bunch of files you just press PgUp and PgDn to go through them. It comes with the k-lite codec pack and it's a simple install, allowing you to watch most media formats with the player:

Enjoy! I've been using it for ages and it works great :) Let me know if I helped you out!"
