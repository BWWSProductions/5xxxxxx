2010.06.30 Orisinal Soundtrack & Sheet Music (Lite)
Compressed the links in a .rar and removed the artwork in Lite version

Extracted with Firebug & Sothink SWF Decompiler 5
Y0uTube videos downloaded with ClipNabber.com
Y0uTube FLV/MP4 files converted to MP3 with ImTOO MPEG Encoder 5

Dont be fooled by the small MP3 file size or 64/80/128kbps bitrate.
These are the ORIGINAL MP3s extracted from the .SWF files.
Everything else is either recorded or just wasting space.
It makes sense that the MP3 can't be bigger than the flash container itself.
