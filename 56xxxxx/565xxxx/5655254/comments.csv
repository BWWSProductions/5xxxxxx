,hawklord9,2010-07-05T14:36Z,I loved Hawkwind in the 70's. Silver Machine is still my favourite song ever. But the band declined after Lemmy got fired. I downloaded this hoping it would be an improvement on the recent stuff and if it had been any other band i would have deleted it after the first ten seconds. Shame to have to say it but this is rubbish.
