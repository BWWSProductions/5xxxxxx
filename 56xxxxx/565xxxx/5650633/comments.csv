,fede184,2010-06-27T16:03Z,"Microsoft never created anything like a Blue Edition. The mention of MSDN should ring some bells: half the world is a MSDN member, so there should be millions of copies of this be around. And MSDN has nothing to do with OEMs either.
I presume this is just a repackaged Office 2007 with an embedded serial."

It would be more wonderful if It would not auto install like that though.. I mounted the iso in A120% to test the files and iso and it just auto installed lagging my entire PC until the install was done.. Blargh :/ "
,skulldragon,2010-10-17T11:13Z,"zdnet.co.uk says:
""The so-called Blue Edition of Office (pictured) is nothing more than a cheap counterfeit copy, Microsoft said.""

but actually, at brighthub.com, start reading from:
""There is no Office 2007 Blue Edition, whether Enterprise or not. However, what does exist is a copy of Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise that is provided to certain Microsoft technicians and to computer manufacturers known as OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers). That DVD that the software comes on is colored blue.""

I will keep my scanner on, while I'm installing this, to see if there will be anything suspicious at all and tell you later."
,skulldragon,2010-10-18T00:20Z,"Sorry, I forgot the brighthub link:
http://www.brighthub.com/computing/windows-platform/articles/70173.aspx

So, this program doesn't require any activation at all. I couldn't find the About page anywhere, but I checked the WinWord.exe-s file version and it was 12.0.6545.5000. Also, nothing malicious got activated neighter while installing or after installation, so this is clean and fully working. I also did an update via web update, and no OGA shit appeared.

Many thanks to uploader!
I wonder if there's a ""blue"" edition of Office 2010 released  anywhere.."

,Malasky,2011-06-28T08:52Z,"Had this for a week now, but have refrained from posting comment pending any notices about activation etc. So far....nothing. Download, extract or mount with Virtual Clone Drive and it just works. Updates through Windows Update with absolutely no problems on Win 7 32 bit.
You're a star, mate. Thank you."
,Malasky,2011-06-28T22:33Z,"Just to elaborate on my previous post, I will not get any messages about activation, as out of curiosity, I tried to activate the suite. The message I got? Microsoft Office is already activated!!!!!!!
Once again mate, you are a star. Thank you."
,nhughes5,2012-01-23T16:56Z,"I downloaded, burned iso file to disk and installed it without any problems on a laptop running Windows 7 64 bit OS. I then ran Windows Update and installed 19 Office updates including SP2, all without any problems! Have rebooted a couple times and no messages about an illegal copy have shown. GREAT DOWNLOAD!! THANK YOU!! Will post back in the future if any ""problems"" ensue."
