Looks like the BBC changed the programs around on the BBCi service in favour of the football, I'll attempt a web rip of the forum when I get home later on in the week..."
,fiend12,2010-06-28T08:14Z,"No worries at all on the slight delay, just makes you appreciate it more! Thanks for sorting this one out. Itll go nicely with my dinner :D "

,boycameo,2010-06-28T08:50Z,"Very good job tdmk1, but is possible that you use ""iPod 5G support"" in ""HandBrake"" options (tick the option on the major screen), now I have a iPod classic (7th Generation) and I can´t watch your videos in it, always I need to re-encode the videos with HandBrake again before watch it in my iPod.

Thank you in advance "
,rjames,2010-06-28T09:11Z,"thanks man, thanks to the BBC I recorded a ridiculous soap series instead of the to be recorded GP."
,panda-kun,2010-06-28T09:38Z,kudos to tdmk1! :D

,skjeggbulbul,2010-06-28T19:01Z,"For the record, this is the European Grand Prix, not the Spanish. Perhaps you should amend the title so it can be searched for."
,Pcar,2010-06-28T21:14Z,"Many thanks for upload from 300 miles away from home, much appreciated:)

re: ""I'll attempt a web rip of the forum when I get home later on in the week... "":

Jake Humphrey blog: ""Now to answer some of the (at times a little rude) comments I received after our F1 Forum fell off-air, we were certainly not intentionally failing to broadcast so that we could watch the football. We share a compound with the world's TV companies and the power just kept failing. It unfortunately meant we were unable to continue to broadcast forum"" :("
,Basse666,2010-06-28T23:19Z,"Excellent as always, thumbs up!"
,donlantyer,2010-06-29T00:14Z,"You´re the master! Don´t need to apologize!

Many many thanks!

From Brazil,

,YiNG_YaNG_6o4,2010-06-29T03:16Z,"no more post race forums =( 

its a sad day in F1 torrents."
,Incognito2781,2010-06-29T09:58Z,"Do you have the post race fourm ?
I always enjoy watching them as well..

Thanks again for your upload and work, I wont download any others but yours."
,YiNG_YaNG_6o4,2010-06-29T18:44Z,@Incognito2781 - if you read Pcar's post and understood what he wrote.  you would see that Jake Humphrey himself said that BBC will not be broadcasting the post race forums anymore.
,sickboy2000,2010-06-30T14:25Z,Thanks man...Great job !!
,Pcar,2010-06-30T19:59Z,"@YiNG_YaNG_6o4

FAIL

Read my post again: Spain/Europe went off air due to a power outage.

F1 Forum will be back at Silvestone GP :)"
,ccdxb,2010-07-01T00:45Z,"very much appreciated effort. No worries about the delay. Thank u.
Perfect A/V quality as usual, much better than the qualifying rip. The picture just looked so much brighter and crisper on my 50"" plasma!!"
,YiNG_YaNG_6o4,2010-07-03T01:09Z,"@Pcar you are correct good sir.  i skimmed thru your post and misunderstood it completely.  thank god too!  i love how  TDMK1 provides us with the post race forums.  his hard work brings F1 to all those who cannot get that channel.  keep up the great work TDMK1!  you are a god to many of us =)

can't wait for Silverstone!"
