Right click and select extract here (if you have winrar installed in your system you will sure see this option unless you deactivated shell intergration of winrar in winrar options).
Your Anti-Virus program (in my case Free Avast) will delete the virus and let only the installer in the folder.
Double click the installer and you should be ok
Replace the exe with the fixed one and you are ready to go."
