,Porkster,2010-06-28T03:05Z,Is this for Blender on Linux?  Cool if so.
,Porkster,2010-06-28T03:08Z,Man why put it in a RAR.  Now I can't download just the blender items.  Compressing video usually save little to non to even making the file bigger.
,eyesofflys,2010-07-14T04:20Z,Because this is not the only place i upload 2 and whats the big deal about rar files just unrar them pretty simple sorry to waist 30 sec of your time and if you dont like them dont download them it shows all the files befor you click the last time to download... Boo Hoo :(
,eyesofflys,2010-07-14T04:24Z,And if you just want to download a few files that means you wont seed and that makes you a leach.
,ImSoJaded,2010-07-31T11:36Z,"@eyesofflys:
that's just a bunch of baseless assumptions: if you don't let peeps download only what they need and you force them to download a big archive, 90 percent of which may be just a waste of diskspace for the downloader, chances are he or she will simply extract the needed files and delete the whole goddamn archive with the torrent. So no seeds again."
,eyesofflys,2010-08-23T00:13Z,"I upload it as a torrent and a ddl thats why,and if you dont like it dont download it, anyway if you asked me to upload just what you needed that would be no prob. sorry there is no suggestion box here?"
