,ruchirrathore,2011-10-04T18:15Z,"Hi, This is what I'd been looking for ever since Win7 was removed. I am trying to download this. Please seed as I don't see any seeder / peers online. Thanks
Also, @freakychokra, I am interested in knowing how did you make this version successfully, using gimagex and rt7lite for quite some time, and literally given up. Could you help me with step by step guide? I'd love if this image could further be customized for my own machine. Also, I am also experimenting with Windows8 DP, and would love to slim it down too... Any help would be welcome and appreciated."
