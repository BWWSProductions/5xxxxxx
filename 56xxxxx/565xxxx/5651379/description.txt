Itâ€™s time to focus on the future. Time to start counting down to September 10th 2010. On that day, the fourth artist album of Armin van Buuren will be in stores. But weâ€™ve got a little teaser awaiting you firstâ€¦

The year 2010 brought Armin van Buuren a great challenge. After his â€˜76â€™, â€˜Shiversâ€™ and â€˜Imagineâ€™, heâ€™s set the bar even higher and started working on his fourth artist album. Encouraged by the many awards and accolades heâ€™s received over the years, but most of all by the millions of music lovers and fans who party and support him tirelessly during his many gigs, Armin kept on going. His unstoppable drive to create new music saw him spending all the time he could spare in between his gigs and travels, in the studio. Those months of hard work and creativity have now come together on his fourth artist album, â€˜Mirageâ€™.

September 10th 2010 is the date Armin fans need to mark on their calendars. But to make the wait a little less long and keep you going during the summer months, Armin will give you a taste of the album by presenting the first single: â€˜Full Focusâ€™.

On â€˜Full Focusâ€™, Armin returns to his core sound. The result is a banging trance track with a classical touch, techy effects and a strong feel for drama. But best is to find out for yourself what â€˜Full Focusâ€™ does for youâ€¦


Seed and enjoy!!!
