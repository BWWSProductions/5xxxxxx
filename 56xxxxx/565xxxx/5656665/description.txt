        Separated from her incarcerated husband Bill (Hinds), Trish 
        (Janney) is about to be married again. Bill is a pedophile, so 
        Trish couldn't be more excited to have Harvey (Lerner), a 
        "normal" father figure for her two sons. But when Bill is 
        released from prison and the boys finally meet their future 
        stepdad, the family is forced to decide whether to forgive or 
        to forget. Trish's sister, the virginal, angelic Joy 
        (Henderson), is also haunted by ghosts of lovers past. On 
        leave from her degenerate husband, Allen (Williams), and her 
        job at a New Jersey correctional facility, Joy unwittingly 
        leaves behind a trail of shame and exposed secrets wherever 
        she goes. In one of the film's most stylized sequences, the 
        image of Joy walking the dark streets of Miami in her 
        nightgown maintains her innocence against a backdrop of self-
        affliction and desire.
