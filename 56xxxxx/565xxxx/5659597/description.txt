This was a Sky TV series that was shown in the UK. It was advertised as a five part mini series but it seemed to disappear from the listings after its second episode. I guess some high up globalists didn't want their divide and conquer tool of illegal immigration portrayed in a bad light.

Synopsis:

The US-Mexican border is a battleground. Join Arizona's elite police units as they fight against constant streams of powerful drug gangs and people smugglers. Intense viewing.

Part 1 of 5.
