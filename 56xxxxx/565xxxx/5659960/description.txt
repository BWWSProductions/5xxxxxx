Alex talks with Dan Dicks of Press for Truth, an alternative media operation in Toronto, Canada. Dan will talk about the G20 and the arrest of Charlie Veitch of The Love Police who was abducted before he could get on a plane and fly back to England. Veitch was arrested for a second time by Canadian authorities for â€œimpersonating a police officerâ€ on a bogus charge designed purely to cover for the fact that Veitchâ€™s original arrest on June 24 for refusing to show ID at the was based on a law that didnâ€™t exist and one that Torontoâ€™s Chief of Police lied about to media outlets before the G20 summit. 
[from 16:00 into 2nd half of hour 2 'til the end of that hour]

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
