,qwertybnm,2010-12-22T22:17Z,"Incomplete? First episode came out full length at 44 minutes, the rest were cut off at 27 minutes. "
,qwertybnm,2010-12-23T13:58Z,"...not incomplete; the ripper cut them off before the credits, but it seems that the episodes are only 27 minutes. Quality is kind of so-so, but very compact files."
