Wikipedia............: A heatwave strikes Hollywood and James starts to use tanning spray on himself. They find out that James has has Hollywood Fever from Camille and when Gustavo sees this, he tells Kendall, Logan, and Carlos to fix James or they will replace him. Kendall, Logan and Carlos go on a mission to get rid of the his tanning spray by chasing him around with water-guns. While on the mission, Carlos finds out that the lead Jenifer went away so he joins their group and also catches Hollywood fever. Logan also catches Hollywood Fever when he goes to the park and Guitar Dude gives him some bongos and tells him to chill out. Kendall, Gustavo, and Kelly decide to split up and cure the three of Hollywood Fever, Gustavo gets a psychiatrist for James, Kelly tries to get Carlos to go on a shopping cart sling-shot, and Kendall tries to remind Logan of his love for math, but they all fail in their attempts. When Gustavo and Kelly wonder how Kendall has not caught Hollywood fever and decide Kendall should go solo, Kendall tells them he will go on the ice to think how to solve the problem because this always brings him back to his roots. Kelly and Kendall realize that Hollywood Fever is just another name for home sickness so they enlist Katie to help them get shaved ice to remind the guys who they really are. After hitting the three with snowballs and getting them to a place filled with shaved ice, the three get cured of Hollywood Fever and have a snowball fight with Gustavo, Kelly, Kendall, and their other friends. Meanwhile Katie makes a shaved ice stand which Bitters takes away from her because she cannot open a food court on the hotel premises. With the help of Buddha Bob, she opens another shaved ice stand that is hanging so it isn't on the hotel premises. In the end she sells the stand to Bitters so she can help Kendall and the stand is closed down by a food inspector.
