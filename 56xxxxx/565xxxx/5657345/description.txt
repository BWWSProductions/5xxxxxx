Ministry of Sound proudly presents Chilled Acoustic, the newest addition to the massively successful Chilled series. This 3CD set takes on a uniquely stripped down, laid back vibe with an acoustic twist.


This collection features a carefully selected tracklist to provide a sublime listening experience, while its broader outlook has allowed for some truly massive names to sign up. Radiohead, Paul Weller, Dido, Corinne Bailey Rae, Adele; artists performing huge acoustic tracks blend seamlessly with established chilled performers Massive Attack, Air, Moby, Morcheeba and Newton Faulkner. Fresh young talent enhances the mix with MGMT, Lily Allen, Empire Of The Sun, Hot Chip, The XX and so many more.


Dig deeper and the connoisseur will delight to see the likes of Kings Of Convenience, Finley Quaye, JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez, Phoenix and Sebastian Tellier. Those yet to discover these gems are in for a treat with the diverse experience the album delivers.

Note:
Scientific testing by the European Broadcasting Union has indicated that HE-AAC at 48 kbit/s was ranked as "Excellent" quality using the MUSHRA  scale.[7]  MP3 in the same testing received a score less than half that of HE-AAC and was ranked "Poor" using the MUSHRA scale. Data from this testing also indicated that some individuals confused 48 kbit/s encoded material with an uncompressed original.
