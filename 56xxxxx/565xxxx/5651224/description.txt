Donald Kohler as a child, was severely burned by his sadistic/overbearing mother as a cruel means of discipline and punishment. After years of social estrangement pass, Donald comes home to his mother after an accident at the local incinerator, only to find that his mother died in her sleep. Now released from her possession, Donald's mind teeters around dangerous activities in order to ease his repression; particularly searching out for women (blonds or brunettes, just like his mother) in random mundane locations, bringing them home, hanging them right side up in a personally installed steel plated room and burning them alive with a flamethrower.
