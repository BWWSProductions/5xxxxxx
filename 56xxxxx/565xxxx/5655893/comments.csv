,Tora_tora_tora,2010-07-05T16:19Z,"Thank you very much for this torrent. I have been waiting for Farsi V3 for sometime now. 

I want to confirm to everyone that this version works (so far) on 3.3.5. Took forever to download (slow connection) but it was worth it just to have Farsi. I really need Dari but I am sure it does not exist, so Farsi will do. 

Again, thank you very much."
,BradimasMaximas,2010-09-28T09:16Z,"I am having a difficult time adding these language packs to rosetta stone.  what do i do?  I am using windows 7 with parallels on my imac.  i have parallels running fine, windows running as fine as it can run and rosetta stone is finally working.  however when i burn the iso files to a disk it doesn't find it. what do i do?  thanks"
,BradimasMaximas,2010-09-28T10:13Z,nevermind i finally figured it out.  i used daemon tools and mounted the image on the desktop and it read it and installed it.  now i'm just trying to find the activation code.  any suggestion? 
,evolver83,2010-11-22T09:13Z,"For some reason, L1 gets installed, but L2 and L3 don't (after a while Rosetta Stone just stalls and the computer hangs). I've tried this torrent with 3.4.7 and 3.4.5 and in both cases, L2 and L3 don't get installed. Do I need to get an older version of Rosetta Stone, or a newer one, to make these work?"

,Edict,2011-05-03T11:49Z,"Thank you so much! I had given up hope that someone would upload this!

@evolver83: Rosetta Stone only lets you install so many language levels. Make sure you're not a the maximum allowed number (I forget what it is - test by installing another language). The three lessons are all V3 and install nicely if everything goes well."
,asdf7326,2011-09-05T11:50Z,"Hey how do I install this? I wanted to surprise my gf, she's persian. all i can do is the audio clips. I can't install. Sorry this is my first time doing rosetta stone"
,HeavyML,2011-12-27T20:25Z,THANKYOU FOR THIS!!! FELLOW POLYGLOT
,Kieraganion,2012-06-25T15:48Z,"In order to install this you need the Rosetta Stone core software. This is just a language pack by itself, not the actual program! I did search here for the core software and found a torrent, so go get that first if you need it. (:

--And if you plan to use this extensively, DO support the creators and actually by the software. You get a lot more on their website as well."
