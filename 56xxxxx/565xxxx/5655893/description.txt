(THIS IS THE ***ORIGINAL RELEASE*** OF THIS SOFTWARE, NOT REPACKAGED LIKE THE OTHER TORRENT ON TPB)
SINCE THIS ONE IS 3 DAYS OLDER THAN THE TORRENT JUST ALTERED AND POSTED ON TPB, THIS RELEASE HAS A LARGER SWARM AND MORE SEEDERS AND IS HOSTED ON MANY MORE TORRENT SITES SO USE IT INSTEAD)


Ahoy mateys!
We have a wonderful treasure for ya today!


Here is the complete Rosetta Stone V3 Persian (Farsi) for levels 1 - 3.
This is the newest release and includes all currently available levels.

Includes Levels 1 - 3 as ISO files for you to mount as a virtual disk or else burn to a CD.

Also includes all 12 CDs worth of audio companions in MP3 format (64kbps CBR mono).


To use the 3 language levels you will need to separately aquire the Rosetta Stone application.  It is preferable to use the current newest program version 3.4.5 (or later, I'd imagine).  Version 3.3.7 should also work fine.

Greetings fellow polyglot wannabes (and non-Iranians dreaming for a free and democratic SECULAR Iran!)

I am the original creator of this torrent.

===============================================================================
For the past ~2 years the only Rosetta Stone Farsi available for download was levels 1 & 2 for RS v2.1.
That version sucked. Its first unit taught you useless words like "elephant". And it foolishly presented 
rarely used Persian synonyms for everyday words like "car" among other crimes.  Good riddance.

This torrent includes all 3 currently available MUCH IMPROVED levels for Version 3 of RS.
It also includes the Audio Companions associated with these levels.

The actual Persian (Farsi) CD-ROMS have the following internal disc labels:
"Farsi_1"
"Farsi_2"
"Farsi_3"

The physical CD-ROM media have the following labels (identical on each disc):
	"VERSION 3, v7.4.0.r19"		(which implies version 3.7.4.0.r19)
Also, the discs for Level 1, 2, 3 have the following number code near the lower disc edge:
	"210#019" (where "#" = level of the disc).

These discs originally shipped with Rosetta Stone Application: "VERSION 3, v3.3.7A"

So I would recommend using these dics with that release or preferably version 3.4.5.
I trust that you already own that software or know how to acquire it!

===============================================================================
Audio Companions:  4 audio CDs for each of the 3 levels = 12 CDs.

I have converted these all to mono MP3 files at 64kbps (CBR) which is a good norm for voice.

The original Audio Companion CDs are each labeled as "v1.0" with 2008 copyright.
Also, the discs have the following number code near the lower disc edge:

"21070##" where ## is:
00,01,02,03,04,..11 FOR: L1 U1, L1 U2, L1 U3, L1 U4, L2 U1, ... L3 U4 respectively.

===============================================================================
Lastly, please do buy this software from Rosetta Stone Ltd. if you actually end up using it frequently and 
improving yourself with its assistance.  That company may have some draconian licensing and asinine 
activation schemes, but they still deserve some compensation when users utilize their creations.
===============================================================================
Thank you.

Viva the Green Movement!
