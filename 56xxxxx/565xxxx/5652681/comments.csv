read instructions 
so what is a usb reader ? i have dragged over to usb stick but says device full but it is not "
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-07-29T23:30Z,"usb reader is the name of the program that I included in the download. It lets you open your usb stick that has been formatted to work as an xbox storage unit.

Make sure you formatted the usb stick to work as an xbox storage unit, then use the usb reader program to open it, then follow the rest of the instructions."
