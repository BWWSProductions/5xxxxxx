Xbox 360 Custom Theme Pack 1.

Everything needed is included in the download.

Check out my other upload, it includes 89 PREMIUM themes (from the marketplace) and too many PREMIUM gamer pictures to count :)

THINGS YOU NEED:
1. USB Flash Drive 1GB+ (or some other means to connect to your xbox HDD)
2. Xbox hard drive with sufficient free space to hold these files

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Plug your USB Flash Drive into your Xbox 360 and go to System Settings -> Memory -> USB Stick -> Configure Now

2. After the usb is configured to be an xbox hard drive, go to Hard Drive -> Themes, and copy or move one of your themes onto your usb stick.

3. Now plug your usb stick into your computer and open USB Reader. Click on File -> Open Device -> Content -> 000000000000 -> FFFE07D1 -> 0030000 (themes)

4. Unzip the contents. Copy all of the themes into your themes folder (00030000) in the USB Reader program

5. Exit USB Reader and unplug your usb stick. Plug it into your Xbox 360. Move all of your recently downloaded themes onto your Xbox Hard Drive (it is easier to use the Transfer Content feature, by pressing Y while the Memory Stick is open).

6. Enjoy these custom themes :)

7. SEED! Other people want to enjoy everything you just downloaded, so seed it.
