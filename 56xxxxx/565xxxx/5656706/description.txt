A trilogy of three horror stories. "The Drop of Water" concerns a nurse who steals a ring off a dead spiritualist, only to have the corpse seek revenge. "The Telephone" features a prostitute who is terrorized by phone calls from a dead client. "The Wurdalak" stars Boris Karloff as a vampire who feeds on the blood of his loved ones.

Nothing to do with the Musical group Black Sabbath or Ozzie Ozborne.

Also no subtitle track.  Multiple internet sites have subtitles for most films in multiple languages.
