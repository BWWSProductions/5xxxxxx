This is a custom soundtrack... It is a mix of the original re-mastered tracks of AC/DC, played over some awesome parts of the movie... The main reason I made this is because there is so much unreleased AC/DC in the movie, that you can't hear anywhere else, and it sounds really good to a soundtrack.... Very enjoyable for a fan of AC/DC and Maximum Overdrive.
