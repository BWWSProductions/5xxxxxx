* The Highfather has turned away from the land of Nevendaar and its inhabitants. His mind is occupied with the coming fate of his world. During this time, a star falls on the border of the Empire and is seen as a sign by the people. Wise men and prophets attempt to solve its mystery, while humans, elves, and demons send their own heroes to find it. Bethrezen above all others wishes to possess the heavenly messenger and use its power as his own.

Thus begins the journey of the mysterious messenger from the heavens named Inoelle. She will become a symbol of hope for many inhabitants of Nevendaar. While traveling the world with representatives of three ancient races, Inoelle begins to experience emotions previously unknown to her. Her soul begins to thaw, and in her heart grows love for the strange, turbulent, but also beautiful world of Nevendaar.
