is it a good one......
i want u to ask that call of duty black ops beta is out or not????????
and what about apb"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-28T14:01Z,"This is a entertained rpg game , if not really your type of game you can get bored but for who like this type of game can be entertained in a nice way for hours , so generaly speaking for a rpg certainly ok but like any game of this type you need to like to play , i repeat , this is a entertained rpg game ."
,klax187,2010-06-28T15:27Z,"awesome job man , keep `em coming :)"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-28T16:46Z,"To klax187 : with pleasure , it is a pleasure for me work the latest pc games and even more pleasure seeing that the possible users like that too and if it is possible i don´t mind to do the work but when it justifies , for curiosity and only for talk i can say that i was morethan a week without a new pc game to be worked and suddenly in only few days it is four or five new pc games that was possible to work but if a new nice pc game is available with everything ok i can always do the work , for example i have to say that i wait close a month to upload the new prince of persia game , why ? because everybody knows that the new drm online from ubisoft can be tough to work and i don´t really like the idea of having the users borred after a dowloading waiting a undefined time for a worked executable to play the game .

To you and everyone else : happy gaming ."
,tpbdotorg64,2010-06-29T09:58Z,"Played 1 and 2. Quite a long time before this (the 3rd) came out. Thanks for this globe, specially with the small size. Will definitely download."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-29T14:30Z,"To tpbdoctorg64 : if youplayed the 1 and 2 you are already familiarized enough with the game and if you like to play the before ones , i can´t see why you will not like this one ...

Happy gaming ."
,axxis1111,2010-06-29T18:08Z,"worthless archive program imo. I donwloaded the game, installed freearc, stopped the unpacking after 2 hours and still being at 4.8% unpacked!!!!!!!

Deleted all the files, deleted the torrent."

Dude There's A Problem In Your Pc That Its isnt Extracting

Globe Is Respected One , Dont Misguide Others"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-29T23:15Z,"To axis 1111 :  your extraction is incorrect , install again the freearc and this time do the extraction after a computer restart , i am shore that you get background aplications interfering with your extraction consuming important ram , you need close 1 gb ram to do the extraction .
Please , follow my advices and try again . I wish to you a happy gaming and if you meet the requirements i can´t see why you can´t play the game ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-29T23:26Z,"To globepIus :  i am shore your intention is nice but the provided link are not ok , just a page with information not found , i don´t remember to upload for nds that game beside the fact that i respect the nds games , i think they are funny and have release for many of the new nice games , in the nds style , but i have to say that i had the pleasure to play and find a few very entertaining nds games , i remember to be hours playing in a very normal way like a pc game or something the GTA Chinatown with a fantastic interface for a nds game and after a few missions you get adaptated to the nds style of the game and the very normal way the game goes makes the player feel the exact same sensation like any new GTA game , like gta iv or liberty city stories but of course in a nds style but with all the interest that keeps the player of gta games playing .
Just to finish , the nds have a fantastic emulator on the PC only without a microphone correctly emulated but not too many games that use the blow on the microphone feature and is for shore one of the games entertaining systems with more variety in type of the games and for all ages , you can play childish games or you can play releases of nice new games like the gta that i refere .
globepIus thank you for your comment and happy gaming wherever you are playing ."

it's me globe again back with your release by me! please seed"
,gIobeplus,2010-06-30T10:48Z,"hey globe i've modded iron man 2 from xbox36o to pc.

can i upload it by your name.
???

actually it works pretty fine on my pc
(iron man 2 xbox360 to pc)!!!!

thanx

hst (your wannabe team member)"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-30T15:36Z,To gIobeplus : How you did that ? you mean that you get the xbox360 game version playable on the pc ? if that it is true upload but is anything required to play the game on the pc ?
,joonior83,2010-06-30T16:10Z,"I don't like the looks of this Globe imposter...


But, to the real globeplus (without some funky I's in their name being a poser) I appreciate your work. Your releases have always worked for me, and their sizes are quite a bit smaller than other versions.

Keep up the good work, man! We all appreciate it!"

,gIobeplus,2010-07-02T12:22Z,"globe i know ur an expert, but just for assurance, xbox and xbox 360 are different consoles!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-07-02T17:21Z,"To gIobeplus :  RIGHT , but you missed the point about the context showing this video , the emulation of this nice consoles (ps3 and xbox360) are very tough , now watc the video and think in the next thing : a basic PC between 500 GB and 1 TB hard drive with at least a nice medium range working video card then we incorporate a real PS3 and a real XBOX360 inside the PC and maybe a Wii , all the systems with appropriate drives to put discs and changing the system we want to use with a few digital buttons , now , beside beeing different systems with the capacity the machine to have the hard disc on the pc common for the 3 or 4 games systems , that means that you can use if you want 200 GB for PS3 and another 200 GB for XBOX360 and maybe external hard drives can be used to normal generic space for the consoles , so , the trick on this machine is the kind of unlimited space in a easy way that can be used for any of the incorporated systems and of course all of them working in a very pratical way with just a few digital buttons to change the system you want to use , now : imagine a machine like this for a nice price a kind of close of 3 or 4 games systems buy it separatdly and with the possible unlimited space for any of the systems , just supposing , if you buy each system one by one , you pay 1500 for example , imagine all of them together with a kind of unlimited space in a pratical way for 1400  everything and the price getted because a high number of unitys coming from the factory and then possible a better price or maybe with the PC part with a few models , where the hard drive space or the video card and processor can change and then depending on the PC part the price of the machine can variate too .

Now , this is the real point about the video , what you think about the possibility of an idea like this ? "

[V],globeplus,2010-07-03T08:49Z,"To djmaster :  you can 2 things :

1 - reeinstall the freearc 

2 - do the extraction after a computer restart to evitate background applications of consuming necessary ram in the time of the extraction and simply don´t do nothing else , you need a close 1 gb ram to make the extraction"

would really love it if someone could explain to me how to fix this ive already tried reinstalling  freearc and also restarting my comp and tried extracting before there was much background activity plz help"
,_BambY_,2010-08-01T16:20Z,nake a new folder on you c:local files then name it what ever you want and extract it there using freearc. might solve those 4% stuck issue
,warcrazym,2010-08-01T23:11Z,thx man i cant beleive it was so simple just create a new folder and drag the arc file in there man i feel stupid now cuz i was sweepin my whole computer whonderin if there was some thing wrong but wow it was so simple
,PatRicK_BeNetaR,2010-09-26T05:20Z,"Wow! fucking fail globe!, I decided to extract this & see if it is complete like the version of d3 I already have, & see if I want to keep this ""rip"", and guess what?

You need a PASSWORD to extract this game, @globe has set up a website where you can download the password, and guess what?

The password ain't there anymore!

I dLed this one ages ago, before I realised how unreliable @globe's ""rips"" can be.

Good luck extracting this one if you download it!"
,Gorlockk,2011-02-10T23:17Z,Does anybody know if this game will work on a Mac??
,8732stdreams,2011-03-27T05:40Z,"Hey there Globe, this was a good upload, it unpacked well and all but I have a problem, when I run the .exe file my screen just goes black for a while and then returns to the desktop. I dunno if it's something wrong with my PC or what. Please get back to me as I've wanting to play this for a while. Thanks"
,Keshicus,2011-05-07T07:48Z,What the hell is wrong with the unit audio in this game? They sound like they're stuck in the 8-bit era.
