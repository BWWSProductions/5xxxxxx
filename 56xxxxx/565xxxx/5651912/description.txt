Brian and Seven hold up in the studio with their beers, a ton of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm notes, and attempt to keep you up to speed on the latest happenings in WoW. Raid Warning is an obvious first choice in WoW news. And remember, just when you think it is safe to enjoy your cheese and wine, along comes the Cacodemon to scare the Ten Fidy out of you.
