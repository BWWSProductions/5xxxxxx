Col Phillip J Corso wrote detailed notes on his life and work as part of the "Foreign Technology Division" [aware observers will get that 

double meaning] at the Pentagon in the post National Security State era of 1947 onwards. Corso covered many topics related to post war 

geopolitics but most importantly he added weight to the notion that the issue of extra-terrestrial visitation behand to play a core role in 

political decision making. This included the establishing of an above-government layer who would, despite government changes, continue to 

ensure the ET issue was rated higher than the H-Bomb [Fact] in security status.

The notes eventually became the best seller "The Day After Roswell" with Bill Birnes as co-author. However the original manuscript here 

contains element anyone who read the first book will find of interest.

Twelve years after its Italian release, Open Minds Production is proud to present â€œDawn of a New Ageâ€, the Philip Corso Manuscript, for the 

first time in the U.S., in its original, uncut and unedited English-language version.
