As answered to the other comment, if the default proxy doesn't work for you, you have to choose another country. I.E. I was using Germany as fake IP but this one wasn't allowing me to write comments, giving a database error. Changing it to Spain my comments now are OK. Not all the proxies the program uses are the same, with some of them some functions don't work properly, you have to go searching around for the right country."
