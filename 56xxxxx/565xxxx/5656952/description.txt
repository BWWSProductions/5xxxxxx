iPhoneBrowser is a Windows based file browser for your iPhone/ipod. It features drag and drop uploading to your iphone/ipod, automatic and manual backups of files on your phone, previews of text and picture files and very cool icons


You can use it with or without jailbreaking your phone, but if you don't jailbreak, you won't get very far! A locked iPhone basically has a small area of folders called a sandbox to work with
