,ddawg,2010-06-27T18:58Z,"Thanks again Beatle Tom.  I snagged the CD at Wally World and thought the people here on PB would enjoy it.

I'm looking for Horton's ""Sings History"" if anyone has it

PS: Winamp does a good job of ripping flac doesn't it."

,d0t,2010-06-29T01:16Z,"thanks ddawg. This is bringing back some memories for me... Now I know im old!
Cheers"
,ddawg,2010-06-29T16:04Z,"Thanks tifon and d0t for the kind words.  You may be interested to know that after much seraching I finally located a ""Johnny Horton Makes History""  It has the remaing historical American Folf saga songs many of us knew when we were much younger.  :(

Some jerk on Amazon wants to sell his used copy for $89 -- Must be a Californian smoking wacky tacky... too bad for him I snagged it a almost like new copy for less than ten at a record shop just down the road from me.

As soon as it arrives, I'll get it ripped and up on PB for everyone's enjoyment.  Keep an eye out for it."
,flaboy,2010-06-30T14:04Z,"Give this one a try. It is also free and has AR and much more:

,ddawg,2010-07-01T03:18Z,"Thanks guys for the flac app advice... but I think I'll stick with WinAmp... it doesn't get much easier than putting in a CD and then click ""Rip"" and as you can hear for yourself  my rips sound very good... but thanks for the advice."
