When a group of archaeologists dig up a human skeleton near the historical
monument of STONEHENGE, an ancient piece of machinery hidden beneath the
bedrock is discovered. Not knowing what it could be the workers accidentally
trigger the mechanism and start a chain of events that may very well end
the world as we know it.
