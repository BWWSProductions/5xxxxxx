           Bigger and Blackerer was taped during two shows,               
           back-to-back on the same evening at Boston s Wilbur            
           Theatre. As you may have surmised from the packaging,          
           this title applies to both a CD and a DVD. These are           
           separate releases in separate formats with the same name.      
           Some of the material contained on the Bigger and               
           Blackerer DVD, directed by Lance Bangs, will air as a          
           television special on the cable channel Epix on April          
           10th. And, yes, there is some overlap between the CD and       
           the DVD, but not a lot. Though both media are housed on a      
           shiny, silver five-inch disc, each is an entity unto           
           itself, full of material that appears solely on one or         
           the other. Only by watching the DVD will you learn of          
           Cross unique relationship with the deaf community, share       
           his canny insights into the editorial machinations behind      
           the Bible, and marvel at how well a bald, middle-aged          
           white guy can fill out a pair of jeans. Yet one must           
           listen to the CD in order to hear about gastro-intestinal      
           misadventures with his dog Ollie Red Sox, or sing along        
           with The Sultan s Revenge, the swinging, Vegas-style           
           opening number composed by Cross and his good friend Mark      
           Rivers (author of the theme to Mr. Show).
