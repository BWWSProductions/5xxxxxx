,wielkidupek,2010-06-30T08:59Z,Thank You  - Your sorry arrogant ass !
,amesoeurs,2010-07-01T18:01Z,seeeeeeed! i know i will.
,Refund,2010-07-04T12:06Z,"Its missing FGHIRS but I'm still very impressed with this collection. The .jpg/.rar thing is cool. But how about we get the whole collection, eh?"
,Refund,2010-07-04T22:28Z,And TUV fuck brother. Thats way too much missing can that shit be recovered?
,johntm93,2010-07-05T06:44Z,"Eh fuck, I dled these a while ago.
Next time they are posted in /lit/ I'll update this"
,Refund,2010-07-05T08:15Z,Cool man :) like I said I'm still pretty impressed with the collection as is. I looked on /lit/ and couldn't find anything on this but I'm sure you'll find it soon. It would have taken me longer to notice but I decided to read some Vonnegut first and found that V was missing altogether. After that I saw that it was missing multiple volumes. Thanks for the torrent I'm looking forward to the update.
,johntm93,2010-07-06T20:30Z,"No problem, I really want to find the newer ones and update it because I don't like having half-assed torrents. "
,artemisdreams,2010-08-22T01:59Z,Is it just me or is something missing here? Like all the actual books! I tried to open the .rar files with SuffitExpander and all I see is the .jpgs for the covers of a lot of books I'd like to read.  Calibre can't seem to do anything else with the .rar files either.  All I could open were 4 books that were pdfs.  Have others actually had luck with this collection? Anyone willing to help a newb out?  Or should I stop seeding this because it doesn't actually work?
,swoppy,2010-09-27T23:08Z,"I have the same thing as Artimisdreams, so it is not just him. I only have a lot of bookcovers now, but no actual .lit-files!!??"
,DarthDerp,2011-08-10T23:36Z,"The books are there (sans the ones Refund mentioned), but because I'm an illiterate ass I's too stoopid to tell you how to see the books. Will seed for a few days, however."
