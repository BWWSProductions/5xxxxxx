,giamevil,2010-07-01T01:04Z,"Im seeding it at an average of 2.8 MBPS. Its a brand new torrent, and after a couple days, it should speed up. "
,aaflores,2010-07-04T01:18Z,where the fuck are the cracks? the folder is dead ass EMPTY.
,hungryman521,2010-07-04T11:20Z,"giamevil it did speed up, but then some hit and run bastards disappeared.Now its so slow its unbelievable, im getting a max of 30 kb/s wtf???
   On a better note, I like the way you protect the newbs, I wish there had been more people like you when i was tryna figure this shit out, anybody have any questions and i will be happy to try and help em out. That is once i have finished the download, and i think thatl be in another 6 days 12 if this DL speed stays the way it is.

Thanks for the upload, was waiting for someone to put the puzzle pieces together in one set."
,sophiebofu,2010-07-04T14:38Z,"Hi giamevil...this is my first torrent ever, so sorry if this is a really silly question, but I've installed all the files like it says in the readme documents...but I don't know where to put the cracks?  Like...I put them in the folders that it says to, but they aren't there on the mounted version...only in the download folder.  When I get the game launcher, it tells me to insert the disk (I'm assuming this is because I don't know what to do with the cracks...)

I'm sorry if this makes no sense...I've been up all night trying to figure it out.  I'd appreciate any help you can give me.

Thanks!"

,SergenHD,2010-07-06T18:21Z,"Hi :)

First of all, thank you.. it works, and i'm still seeding

So i have some questions:

1. How can we update this game ??, 
I'm currently on v 4.0.87.006001
Can I use EA d manager directly, or is there a patch ? and do u recommend any ?

2. Could u please download, and then upload everything from expansion packs to objects and cheats ?? like if u could test some torrents, and then upload them .. 

and
3. When there are other sims 3 realeases available, could u upload those two ??

This would make u the #1 Sims 3, and game uploader ;)

Otherwise, this is still working, and the best out there, so thank u so much ;)"
,hungryman521,2010-07-06T20:39Z,"sophiebofu ok well your cd crack problem is the only thing i can help you with right now.

im guessing you found a folder that says cracks or whatever, and in that folder there were some exe,s, now if you have found that folder then you have to copy and paste EVERYTHING from that folder to your sims 3 install directory, (if you dont know wer your sims 3 install directory is then click on your desktop shortcut, if you have one, but any shortcut will do. Then you right click on the shortcut a click ""open file location"").

now once you have found your install directory you copy your cracks into the directory a click copy and replace as many times as needed. Now im guessin that this guy put all the cracks for the seperate expansions and game into dif folders, so when you are copying to the new folder make sure that you are copying the right ones, if you dont have something popping up saying ""copy and replace"" or ""dont copy"" , then you have most probably copied to the incorrect directory, or have selected the wrong files, make sure you copy everything from the crack folders.
Hope this helped and if it didnt can you give me some more info so that i can help you better.
Thanks."
,giamevil,2010-07-07T05:09Z,"Sergen HD- This is the most updated version so far. When the new one comes out, i will crack it, and post the crack again. Im not sure by what u mean about downloading torrents and testing them? Im sure i could if thats all it is. If u mean cracking them, yeah sure, ill crack some games. If you want some, ill post it, same for anyone else. If youw ant a torrent, let me know and ill upload it. I have ALOT. 


AAflores- I dont know how much more specific i can be..... Um. When u extract the rar. Its right there. Not rocket science..."
,giamevil,2010-07-07T05:15Z,"sophiebofu- The EXACT directory is

C:/Program Files/ Electronic arts

I fyou have vista or 7, then highlight everything in there, and click copy, and go to the directory, and click paste. Overwrite and all that. 

If you have XP or under, you need to go into the folder The sims 3, and copy everything in there from the directory. Then go to the directory, and open the sims 3 folder, and put it in there. Then go to the crack folder, and open the World adventures folder, and copy everything in there, then go to the directory, and open the world adventures folder in there, and click paste, and so on.

,deathundothee,2010-08-09T08:49Z,"Thank you Giamevil, it works! My computer has barely enough memory, but it works on a Mac!
For those who are having problems, take note:
the 'update' in Giamevil's directions refer to the install process itself, NOT an update from the Sims website. Do as he heeds and do nothing else in between each install.
Also, if you are having problems finding the file directories to place the cracked files, this is how it is found on a Mac.
1. Right click on The Sims 3 as it appears in your applications folder. Select 'show package contents.'
2. Now, navigate to here: Contents > Resources > transgaming > C_drive > Program Files > Electronic Arts
3. Here you can see all of the individual files for each disc installed. Within all four you can then navigate to Game > Bin.
4. Here is where the files need to be replaced. Copy-paste each cracked file, overwriting those that already exist in those directories.
5. Repeat for each game upgrade."

,shinobi_raccoon,2010-08-15T18:02Z,"@wr1tersun1te

Are you trying to run the game using the Sims 3 Launcher? With these cracked ones, you have to actually open the crack file itself (TS3EP02 or whatever), which functions as a launcher that doesn't prompt for the cd."

,deathundothee,2010-08-17T06:38Z,"I'm noticing some confusion on how to run the game... you just run it through the now-cracked The Sims 3, which by default now pops up as Ambitions since that was the last game upgrade installed. So just click on The Sims 3.app. The launcher works fine - the .exe files in the cracks folders are not applications by any means, just source files. You just stick them inside of the app folder at the previously mentioned directories.

Run the .iso files in order (with Daemon Tools on Windows, Mac by default has Disc Utility to do the work). Copy paste the files as I mentioned above. And then run the Sims.

And problems with other copies of the Sims is very possible - I imagine the cracks only work with a certain version of the base game since they were written as such. Anyone please confirm or deny my little assumptions, heh heh."

,Darktangent10,2010-08-25T02:40Z,"This doesn't work with some custom content because it isn't updated, and the version info was written 1.12 instead of 1.2 so you can't update it with any updates at all.  Fail."
,rainman2106,2010-08-29T13:29Z,"Well, it does work.

What isn't mentioned is that to play the game you SHOULD NOT click on the launcher. If you do that, you'll get the ""Insert Disc to play"" error. Head into the Sims 3 directory > Game > Bin >

Double-click on TS3.exe and the game will load for you then.

,playlikegods,2011-05-14T10:06Z,"Thanks for this. This works perfect for me.

@007jamesp - i also had that sims 3 from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED... but just to make sure that giamevil's crack will work, i just have to delete/uninstall the razor one, anyway this one includes the base game already if you downloaded it."
,playlikegods,2011-05-14T10:11Z,@thinaesh  - CD key/serial code for each expansion is included in the files. It's in textfile.

,ivansj82,2011-10-08T07:25Z,Is this for mac too? I have a cracked version of the Sims 3... can I download it? And if so can someone help me out please? Thanks. Pretty new to this 
,cloudchii,2011-11-14T17:44Z,"This works on a MAC. I did not encounter any update during installation but on the Sims 3 launcher itself. I didn't update though as I was afraid it would affect the cracks. Anyway it's working. I have OS Lion.

Although the graphics oh the sims itself have a bit of a glitch. When I zoom in on my sim it's pixelating and up to almost unrecognizable. A patch would probably fix this. But until then, I'll enjoy my sims 3 Ambitions on a MAC.

Just follow giamevil's instruction. :)"
,Dina647,2012-01-29T17:58Z,I've done everything except for the cracks. I'm not sure where to put the unrar'ed folder. A little help? I've never done this before.

,Dina647,2012-01-30T15:55Z,"I'm back, need help again. 
I've put the cracks where they belong, but when I try to start the game, it tells me to insert Ambitions disk. I really have no idea what to do now."

,zbart117,2012-04-19T02:23Z,need seeds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ETA--4d 5h
,shahmirazin,2012-07-03T23:50Z,"Q: Where to put the cracks?
A:
For THE SIMS 3 crack, 
C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3GameBin

For ""World Advnture crack"", 
C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3 World AdventuresGameBin

for ""High-End Loft Stuff"",
C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3 High-End Loft StuffGameBin

for ""Ambitions""
C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3 AmbitionsGameBin

It should replace the existing files, if it doesn't, you are putting the crack in the wrong place.

This torrent works nicely, my 18GB download isn't a waste! Thanks to whomever deserves it!"
