Story:
A beautiful woman (Miranda) lives in bliss with her lover, Dr. Johnson (Fred Williams), who conducts unorthodox experiments with human embryos he keeps in jars around the lab. When a medical committee rejects his findings and orders him to discontinue his work, the unstable doctor does the only sensible thing: slashing his wrists in the bathroom. The devastated Miranda then takes it upon herself to seduce and kill the three men and one woman "responsible" for the suicide. Of course, two of the potential victims include Dr. Orloff himself, Howard Vernon, and Franco in one of his largest roles.
