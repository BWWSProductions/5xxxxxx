IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Karate Kid 2010 SUBBED CAM 

First off sources used are the spanish dvdr by anton studios and some homemade stuff .....Thanks to all for the sources :)
Right the dvdr we were given contain a english audio track which was cam but pretty decent .....the video was good but had
hardcoded spanish subs all the way through and also english when needed.
Theres also antons normal "A" in the top right corner hardcoded and theres also a corner of a chair in the bottom left.
The colours were ok in parts but there was some major green added to it :P
The other source we used.....was to fill in the missing blanks.At around 6mins 20secs there is 32 seconds of missing footage so 
we've added that with audio for it.
Work done....well the audio on all has been left how they were so ....
The videos.....well the missing part has been filtered and resized to match the main bulk of our encode.The anton dvdr we basically just
ripped and ran a few filteres over it,changing the rgb colours,chroma,brightness,contrast,hue,sat also used a smoother and finally there seemed
to be some interlace issues that wasn't going away even after we fixed the ivtc,so for this we had to blend the field and normal de-interlace aswell. 
Once done it was just a case of fitting the missing scene into our encode.

Anyway enjoy,yet another remake :)
