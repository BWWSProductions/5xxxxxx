After installation you do not need to copy/paste the cracked content from the crackfix/binaries folder on your mounted/burned dvd and overwrite them into the team17/alien breed impact/binaries folder. Make sure you overwrite.

Incidenatlly, i aren't 100% sure but it looks as though the language selector is no longer included.

The game is in English.

I hope i've got this right and some of you enjoy it."

You NEED to copy/paste the cracked content from the crackfix/binaries folder on your mounted/burned dvd and overwrite them into the team17/alien breed impact/binaries folder. Make sure you overwrite.

,5iTH,2010-06-30T17:30Z,"Odd that - i manage both those ""impossible things"" on a daily basis almost autonomously. Each to their own, i guess and after reading over and over again on every game torrent ""where people get stuck"", i decided to pre-empt at least 100 comments since, accordingly, there is no ""skidrow"" folder on the dvd (unless you burn/mount it) and there is ABSOLUTELY NO NEED FOR THIS STEP of the instructions because....
*drumroll*
...all the crack content is in a seperate folder and NOT on the dvd.

Thanks for the comment motley but, the crack you will requiore if you want to play level 2 onwards is in a seperate folder called /Alien.Breed.Impact.Crackfix-SKIDROW/Binaries/
as i stated."
