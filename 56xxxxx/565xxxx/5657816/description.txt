         Tired of being harassed by "A," the girls decide to put a     
         stop to the anonymous emails and text messages by blocking    
         all unknown users. But even with the mysterious ghost         
         no longer looming over their heads, the girls' problems       
         are far from over. With a surprise visit by a father, a       
         surprise gift from a prospective paramour, getting some       
         unwanted advice and an undeserved scholarly accolade,         
         the girls' lives continue to get more complicated by the      
         day. And after dealing with all of that, did the Pretty       
          Little Liars really think they could keep "A" away forever?
