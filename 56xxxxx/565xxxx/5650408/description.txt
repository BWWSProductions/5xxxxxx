Yet another installment in Sony Music's "Metal Masters" series, it's good to see them 
reissuing an album that really does not fit the profile of your typical major label cash cow roster. 
Accept was one of the very first underground Metal bands to receive huge commercial success 
in the United States in the 1980's, not to mention the one of the first to be signed by a major label. 
Accept had gotten their feet wet in the US with an abundance of underground radio airplay, 
stamping out albums like "Midnight Highway," and their self titled release; 
all selling a very good amount regardless of the these records
being hard to find and usually only being available as imports at the time.
