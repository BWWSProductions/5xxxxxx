,napptunes,2010-07-02T19:38Z,hey kellso i just converted a brrip with apple tv hd settings in m4v and its not widescreen (black areas on top and below the image). what do i do? do you have any advice?
,Kellso76,2010-07-28T21:45Z,Sorry for the long waited response Napp.....can you put up a screenshot of what you are explaining? What program are you using?
,Kellso76,2010-07-28T21:53Z,"Napp, some movies will not have the black bars in them because the media player such as a Apple TV or an HDTV will upscale the picture and fill the entire screen. Anything 1280 X 688 will be full screen on most HDTV's.
