,PhilLesh12,2010-06-28T20:05Z,"I'm sure this is real.  The question is how is the quality of the cam video/audio.

This is very quick, it probably hasn't been tweaked at all, and it's most likely the original cam audio.  

Anyone had a chance to sample it yet?"
,Costiputza,2010-06-28T21:12Z,"I don't know the reason for uploading a material like this one. Bad angle (crop of the movie and aberation of image), lack of clarity and per total a fucking image and a very poor sound. Thanks but no thanks, I would preferred to wait and see a good cam rip than this so called cam (my photo camera could make a better job)."
,PhilLesh12,2010-06-28T22:38Z,"@costiputza

Thank's for the heads-up on the quality.

In .BONE.'s defense, they offer it when they get it.  Some people want to see a movie badly enough that they'll tolerate poor quality."
,RealStuffNoFakes,2010-06-28T23:05Z,"BAD Quality & Sound!!! 

Dont Try it out guys"
