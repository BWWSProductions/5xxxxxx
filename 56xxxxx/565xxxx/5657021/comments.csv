Thanks"
[T],ADHDerby,2010-07-03T16:32Z,"@ MuttleyPT: You're welcome! :)

@ cb429: I've cracked and tested all games myself and they save the profiles here. I can resume each game right where I left off.

Does anyone else experience this problem?"
,MrEeee,2010-09-10T00:15Z,"Thanx very much for this UL!  

I have Amun Rising and Luxor 2 but I don't have Luxor 3 and I never played the original game either.

I'm looking forward to trying the Pirate Poppers game a lot too!!

Thanx again and aloha from Hawaii   :)"
