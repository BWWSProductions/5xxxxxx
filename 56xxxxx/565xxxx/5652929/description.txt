To the best of my knowledge, all songs heard throughout the game are present in this collection, with the exception of the organ theme played under Doel's death and the theme played under the Dragon Campaign FMV.

All songs were taken directly from the game and remastered to lossless non-DRM WMA. This will fit onto two standard 80 minute audio CDs. This is the result of quite a bit of work... Enjoy!
