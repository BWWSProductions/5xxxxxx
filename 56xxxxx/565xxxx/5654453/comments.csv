There is another ORIGINAL torrent for this on TPB and it currently has 25 seeders (compared to just 1 for this version). And it is found on at least 10 other Torrent sites. The original torrent contains the exact same files except for 2 or 3 added text files (thus a different hash value for this one).

The original torrent's id on TPB is: 5655893
URL:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5655893/"
