Persian (Farsi) Learning Tips
* Persian is written and read from right to left; with the exception of numbers, which are written from left to right.
* In Persian, certain vowels are not usually written. Rosetta Stone will help you learn how to determine the word from the context of the sentence.
* Speakers of Persian will often omit the subject of the sentence.
* Placement of stress within a word is important to convey a wordâ€™s meaning. Rosetta Stone helps you acquire proper pronunciation through exposure to native speech, useful practice, and corrective feedback.
* Most Persian letters change shape depending on whether they occur at the beginning, middle, or end of a word.
* There is no upper or lower case in Persian.
* In Persian, there are formal and informal ways to address others, depending on the age of the speaker and his or her relationship to the person being addressed.
* Numbers in Persian are written with modified Hindi numerals.
* Persian does not categorize words into masculine and feminine. It also does not have separate words for â€˜heâ€™ and â€˜she.â€™
