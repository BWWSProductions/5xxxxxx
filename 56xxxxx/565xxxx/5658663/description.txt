Flo Rida  has a new club-ready single, 'Club Can't Handle Me,' included on the upcoming soundtrack for 'Step Up 3D.'

The poppy, dance club track with sing-a-long "Yeah-eh-eh"s features less sampling then his previous hits 'Sugar' and 'Right Round,' mainly due to the fact that French DJ David Guetta produced the track.
