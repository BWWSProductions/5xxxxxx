,kian89,2010-07-01T22:10Z,why dub movie is a shame BTW ??
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-02T15:20Z,@kian89 the movie loses its meaning and the dubbed version makes the movie boring! Sometimes the dubbed english is even out of sync which also makes it shit annoying to watch!.. is that point enough? lol
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-02T15:55Z,"no. 2 of the trilogy..

,Fil_87,2010-07-05T02:42Z,"At the risk of sounding ignorant (I'm sort of new to this whole thing), how do I activate the subtitles?

Much obliged."
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-05T17:07Z,Fil_87 subtitles are for the persons whom wants to watch it on a pc.. (theres ALOT of those) if ur watching it on a pc then simply use VLC og media player classic and the subtitles will work by default!
,gussers,2010-07-21T06:58Z,Cheers mate downloaded your other two but already had this from a different post. I'll grab your version to go with your other two to complete the set.
,spaceplan9,2010-08-09T11:28Z,"Thnx uploader; been waiting for this film, only problem is i cant get the subtitles active on my iphone, i've enabled ""closed captioning"" but cant get the subs, can someone please help. Cheers"
,MDunn1937,2010-10-08T19:00Z," on.off.on, you couldn't be more right about dubbing. I'm so glad you ULed this. The subtitles are a little wonk, but who gives a shit? It's free and good. Thanks."
