,Tech-Noir,2010-07-17T22:25Z,"Watching this with both VLC and Media Player classic there is alot of framedropping from the encode, causing stuttering (looks like the frame rate drops from 24 to 17-16). It\'s not constant, but it happens throughout the film. Any other 720p source plays fine with the same media players. So if you can, try to find another copy."
