[V],RiddlerA,2010-06-27T10:55Z,"Hey 

Don't give up
U will get ur Pink skull 
Just be patient & continue ur good work

Believe me or not Mods watch over silently & award Skulls without any bias

I can say from my Personal Experience ......... I never applied for it & got my pink skull after my 50 upload & green skull after 85 upload

Whenever I have faced any problem mods have been very helpful"
,kanha,2010-06-27T13:53Z,"@YIFY
Riddler is right.....
pzl plz keep up u'r good work....
i hope after some more uploads Mods will give u pink skull......"
[V],pluto999,2010-06-27T15:45Z,"@YIFY: Just as i stated in my mail, losers are quitters, i guess you are not one, so I hope you'll be back. Till then have a great time in what you are doing & good luck."
[V],pluto999,2010-06-27T15:47Z,"If you want an example follow this guy >http://thepiratebay.org/user/twentyforty

,UltimateChinna,2010-06-27T15:49Z,"Hey YIFY,

,TaiTheGuy,2012-05-26T09:05Z,"IDK what the problem is with this (& a few other) torrents. When I d/l on the PC I'm using right now, I sometimes specifically look for YIFY.
This torrent does NOT show up on TPB. I typed in a buncha different keywords.
Finally found a link inside of an FXG supremacy torrent."
