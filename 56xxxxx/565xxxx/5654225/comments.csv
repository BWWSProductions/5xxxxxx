,killerchipmunk88,2010-08-09T21:01Z,"Yeah, I got the same problem. Says I have to unpack a previous volume. Help anyone?"
,killerchipmunk88,2010-08-25T01:19Z,"Just figured it out. You don't actually extract the .r00 file, you just remove the ""EXTRACT this"" from its name. Seems to work after that."

I cant find the correct keygen for shit anywhere and this product is fucking immense, i got 2 days worth of useage before it fucked me off, SOMEONE GIVE ME THE KEYGEN PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,KapNkRUK,2012-06-13T14:04Z,"finkadnb, this torrent is good. you may need to try and use a different program to extract the keygen. The keygen only runs on windows. i am running a macbook pro with 10.7.4 and everything is fine after several attempts at extracting the keygen."
,KapNkRUK,2012-06-13T14:05Z,"Like killerchipmunk said, rename the first rar file then its smooth sailing after that!"
