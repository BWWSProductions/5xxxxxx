Cauterize (formerly Take Off Eh!) was an alternative rock band from Oshawa, Ontario, Canada that was active between the years 1995-2007. During a concert on September 12, 2007 in Ottawa, Cauterize announced they were breaking up; ending their more than ten years together as a band. The band had been scheduled to play on MTV Live in Canada on September 5 and canceled, which was later found to be due to the decision to break up the band. A formal announcement was posted on the band's message board and website on September 27, 2007. They played their final show together October 19, 2007 in their hometown of Oshawa. At the show they played songs from every album including the albums as TOE with their final song onstage being "Curtain Call" from the TOE album "The Moment I Cauterize"... a fitting way to end a good run.
