The worldwide success of Tinariwen has had two repercussions, which are both reflected in this impressive new album from the Sahara. It has led to a new generation of guitar bands emerging from the nomadic Touareg community, singing about their struggles, suffering and hopes in the Tamashek language. And it has meant that desert blues is now influencing even indie rock bands such as Dirtmusic, whose American guitarist Chris Eckman produced this set. The two bands met at the Festival in the Desert a couple of years back, and have been working together ever since. So although this album has inevitable echoes of the loping, rhythmic guitar style of Tinariwen, the desert blues is mixed with thoughtful, breathy laments in which the drifting guitar work makes them sound like the African answer to an Americana band. Tinariwen are still the kings of desert blues, but Tamikrest are impressive young contenders.
