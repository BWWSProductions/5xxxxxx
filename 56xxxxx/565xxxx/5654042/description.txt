It's clear that a lot of people can't get past the explicitness
of this film, which is a shame. I recall a lot of embarrassed
giggling last time I saw it at the cinema. The art/pornography
debate seems futile to me - this is a film about an obsessive
sexual relationship/love affair and it tells it like it is.
But it's about as far away from the likes of "Debbie Does
Dallas 26" as you can get. The film is clearly serious in intent
and there is a lot of beauty in it. The subtle political
content/context of the film is often overlooked - some of the few
scenes shot outside the bedroom show groups of soldiers marching
the other way from the direction our characters travel -
and we all know where the rising Japanese militarism and nationalism
of the 1930's led. I think the best comparison is probably with a film
like "Last Tango in Paris" which dealt with similar themes in a
similar way - and was also probably also pretty boring for those
with a short attention span
