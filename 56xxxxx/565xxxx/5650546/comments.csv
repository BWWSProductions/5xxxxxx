,Marcvijgen,2010-06-27T14:40Z,@redweed: I am now
,redweed,2010-06-27T15:28Z,"Hopefully, because i'm stuck at 75% again. No seeder"
,Marcvijgen,2010-06-27T18:14Z,"Don't understand. I'm seeding right now, as I did the two times before. This morning someone downloaded the whole map. So it should be possible."
