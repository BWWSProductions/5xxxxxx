Do you have a spare USB stick laying around? (Minimum 2 gig stick)

This is a great Windows utility compilation that I put together for my repair business. It was designed for the ultimate "on the go" computer technician with all the apps you'll ever need to fix virtually any PC problem.

It includes a USB key imaging program that makes the setup a literal no brainer. (Make sure to run as it as Admin in Vista and Windows 7)

Multiple portable Windows apps and multiple bootable options.

The following is from the included "read me"
