    Tony and the Team go behind the scenes at Westminster      
    Abbey to explore the story of the Cosmati pavement: the   
    mosaic floor being uncovered for the first time in 100   
    years.                                                    
    Also known as 'The House of Kings', Westminster Abbey      
    has stood at the heart of the nation for nearly 1,000     
    years, surviving the Civil War and Reformation.          
    While visitors marvel at the royal paraphernalia and      
    the majesty of the architecture, it remains at the core    
    of the Establishment, and still plays host to the         
    Coronation.                                              
    For a century, the Cosmati pavement - a huge, mystical    
    mosaic floor in front of the altar at the centre of        
    which the Coronation Chair is placed - has been covered   
    by carpet.                                               
    Now Time Team cameras are allowed unprecedented access    
    behind the scenes at the Abbey as this extraordinary       
    piece of living history is revealed.                      
    As well as exploring the story of the Cosmati pavement,  
    the Team also have access to a night-time search under    
    the floors for lost tombs and graves, a shrine that        
    still attracts pilgrims after 800 years and the 1000      
    year-old faked documents that gave the Abbey the         
   right to host the Coronation in the first place.
