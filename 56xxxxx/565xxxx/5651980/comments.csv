The installer told me it hadnt installed and gave me exit code 6. So I uninstalled and started again - I unticked the boxes for 32 bit and for AIR and Media Player. Installed and again got exit code 6. However I was still able to open and followed the instruction in the torrent and at the minute it is working fine. Will post if it goes wrong.
Also make sure you have admin rights to install...thats what causes exit code 6."

Save your file(make sure when saving to select ""all files"" dont save it as a text document!
