One of the Italian giants, BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO defined together with a few majestic bands, a new ground break in the 70's progressive music. The incomparable musicianship of BMS is followed by many Italian bands along the decades until today. The unique voice of Francesco Di Giacomo brings their music to a higher dimension, and the extraordinary keyboard duo performed by Vitorio Nocenzi and Giani Nocenzi structures the perfect foundation for a strong yet beautiful progressive music...
