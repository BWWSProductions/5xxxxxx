During the 'Golden Age', small makers built amazing bicycles that transcended their function to become a form of art. Their craftsmanship was not limited to the frame, but included hand-made derailleurs, brakes, stems, racks and other components. The entire bicycle was carefully designed and crafted as a unit, combining function and beauty.
With lavish color photography, 'The Golden Age of Handbuilt Bicycles' charts the development of theses machines from the early 1900Â´s through the present day. Additional historic photos show the bikes in competition and with their original owners. Insightful descriptiÃ³ns set the scene for each bicycle and explain its details. Here you find machines with a level of craftsmanship that never has been surpassed.
