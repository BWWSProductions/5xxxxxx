SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION:
*******************************************************************************************************************

Feeling   boring  and  dull  with  your  Windows  desktop  background   wallpaper?   Even  if you run
Windows  DreamScene that makes  your  desktop background an  animated   motion  wallpaper  or
video,  as  time passes it will  be less  interesting  as the  motion   picture keeps  repeating itself. If 
this is the case, how about feed a pet bird on your desktop? 

DesktopBird is a  small  desktop  pet bird program. Once run, DesktopBird will create a  little lovely 
kingfisher  that  flies  around  your screen,  occasionally  performing  its  daily bird behavior  routine. 
And  the bird is interactive too, and will interact and response  to  your mouse clicks. Itâ€™s especially
nice  if  you have  Windows Vista DreamScene running natural   especial river or sea themed  video 
background.

Such  actions  such  as  the pet kingfisher  sometimes  may  land, sit and  rest on top of your open 
window, toolbar or taskbar. If you donâ€™t  like  your  desktop  pet  bird  sitting  there, simply drag and
 drop her around the â€™skyâ€™ (your desktop). When you donâ€™t like the  bird  to  flying  around  particular
 space you may  stop  it too. It  also hops along  like  any  bird  would  do, and  also  dive  into your
 taskbar to fish for food. Want to  kill  the birdie? Simply drag it and  put inside or near  your  bottom 
taskbar, and you will see it flying lower and lower, and finally lying idle on the bottom, as if itâ€™s dead.
