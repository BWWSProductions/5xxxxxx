,viedma,2010-06-30T17:41Z,Thanks. ItÂ´s not only great fun watching the movies we enjoyed so much in our distant youth but they are also important for a history of science fiction in movies. And some are a real riot (plenty of unintended laughs) like Robot monster (alien in gorilla suit and diving helmet) or The king of the rocket men... KeepÂ´em coming mate.

Robot Monster is another I'm on a serious hunt for.

Enjoy!"
