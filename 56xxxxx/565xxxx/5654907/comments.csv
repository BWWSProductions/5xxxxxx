[V],Mbb15,2010-06-28T21:54Z,"I think never by a scene group, because it is only multiplayer/online and not single player they will not crack it.
Mayby some P2P group will do that but when it is there and you are able to play online I will post it or someone else will"

,LegendOfTime,2010-06-29T03:55Z,"Just so anyone don't take it the wrong way well it was the camera that got stuck while jumping onto the floor but it did seem that the floor disappeared though.

The crack fix by the (SKIDROW) group does work to fix the doors and graphic problems but as for the camera well it could of just stuck just for a little bit.

I tryed the samething again and i jumped onto the floor the second time and then everything was just fine but the first time the camera messed up and then the floor was gone. "

delete this torrent..the crack wont work"
,MCholas,2010-06-30T04:26Z,"I guess this crackfix only works in certain parts of the game but not all. I'm complete stuck at ""The Baths. I'm suppose to step on the pressure switch to activate the waterfall in front of me. Then, I freeze the waterfalls, run up ontop of it, jump back to the bar which then activate the door that lets in all the bad guys. That door does not open whatsoever. There are three summoners in this area of the fight. Thanks SKIDROW for the first crack and updated crackfix, but I guess it's back to the drawing board again for another updated crackfix."

,kosmaverik,2010-06-30T22:32Z,@fiyero109 @uni3que  try azoking's crack it worked for me ;)!
,melanholik,2010-07-03T15:18Z,"Don't know about the other comments, for me it works just fine. Big thanks for the team, you work miracles.
Just one thing: if you receive an upgrade, choose it, but then die after reaching the next checkpoint, you start again from the last point, you keep the selected upgrade plus can pick another one. I don't know whether it is a glitch in the original game or it is crack-related but definitely it is an issue.
Apart from that, completely playable and a very very good game. Thanks again, recommended."
