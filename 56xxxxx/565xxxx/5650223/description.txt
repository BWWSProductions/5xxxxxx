It's time to treat my downloaders who are more into synth/dark/minimal wave records. Four awesome records and difficult to come by. Enjoy, seed and keep the music alive.

John Paul Young - The Life of Ermie Scub [1980]

My Pierrot Dolls - End of an Era [1980-1984]

Scattered Order - Career Of The Silly Thing (1985)

UV Pop - No Songs Tomorrow [1984]
