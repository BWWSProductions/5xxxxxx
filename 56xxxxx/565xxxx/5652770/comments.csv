I have been looking for Episode 3 all week long, and cannot understand why, for instance, Top Chef has eight million seeders three minutes after the episode has finished, but Food Network Star doesn't appear anywhere in the torrents!  You are a champ.  Can I hope that you will put up future episodes?  Like maybe the one that aired last night?  Thanks in advance!"
