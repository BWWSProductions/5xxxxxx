Three people are looking for clues following the death of Antonio CÃ©sar, a left-wing intellectual and journalist who had been working on an exposÃ© of international business corruption: Fernanda, Antonio's long time girlfriend; AndrÃ©, his roommate, who fears that rumors that Antonio died of AIDS means that he too will contract the disease; and Regina, a journalist whose investigation of Antonio CÃ©sar's work brings up more questions than answers. Although already noted for his short works, especially the scandalous SHOULD I KILL THEM?, Bianchi clearly threw down a political and aesthetic gauntlet with this provocative, kaleidoscopic journey through contemporary Brazil that measures the distance between the radical slogans of the Sixties and the grim realities of the Eighties. In the film, Antonio CÃ©sar exists mainly as a televisual image, a ghostly presence that continues to haunt these characters and yet seems safely distant and contained - an apt metaphor for the legacy of the Sixties in politics, art and cinema for a generation of Brazilians just then awakening to a new democracy.
