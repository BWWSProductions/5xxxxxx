CREDITS:

Thanks Metallica for all their efforts of being together and bringing the BigFour to stage and especially for the greatest show they ever did in Sofia and also for the brilliant cinema broadcast idea. I was watching this exciting show in cinema 06/22/2010 and after that I'm "reloaded" Metallica fan again for years.
I am indeed really sorry in front of Metallica about that upload on tpb but I (and surely all the fans) can not wait any longer for the new DVD and I promise to buy it on release.

Thanks to Mr.Tallica4lifegbrtdy for uploading those awesome videos. Sorry to say that I've ripped them from Y-Tube and uploaded to tpb without asking permission.
