,Strikefear13,2010-06-30T05:39Z,"It isn't fake if it's uploaded by someone with a skull and crossbones, moron."
,93keja,2010-06-30T06:26Z,Please seed!
,zzy4680,2010-06-30T22:51Z,Someone please upload a region free one!!
,fakebest,2010-07-01T05:26Z,a bunch of the rars are corrupt I downloaded it completely did a re-check and started the torrent again and it still says this so I am pretty sure this is corrupted.
,fakebest,2010-07-01T07:40Z,I started the torrent for a third time and it downloaded some more and I did another recheck and it was still missing some data looks like a lot of corrupted data is being sent or something so I take back what I said this torrent is most likely fine and it's just that bad peers are in it and you should recheck it twice to really make sure you will get a clean perfect iso. 
,93keja,2010-07-01T08:56Z,Please someone upload a region free version
,maxpan90,2010-07-01T17:54Z,Will this game work on a PAL console i am downloading it i will comment if the game works or not i hope its region free.
,-OLDBOY-,2010-07-01T19:32Z,It's not region free I've heard.
,endwar16,2010-07-02T00:01Z,"when i put it in my xbx it says ninety nine nights 2/Na, whats with that?"
,Aadryk,2010-07-02T04:35Z,Is this real!? sounds fishy....
,Samlooh,2010-07-02T11:20Z,"Guys ... No, it will NOT work on a PAL console. Press the btarena link and you'll see, and yes it IS real."
,fakebest,2010-07-02T19:53Z,"These are  some of the bad peers which caused me numerous rechecks and end up making me download almost twice the amount of data of the total size of the game because so much corrupted data was being sent so block these guys.  I have Peer guardian 2 with updated lists to block all all the right people so these guys must be normal but just have bad data or something.

,Popeben,2010-07-03T17:11Z,"Does anyone know if it's ok to play a game online, if it stealth passed using ABGX but when checking the ABGX database on their website it has a question mark under 'Stealth for Ixtreme'. Just Cause 2 is a good example. Can anyone help?"
,Torx8,2010-07-05T08:59Z,"most games are ""ok"" to play online, but that doesn't mean it's safe and that you won't get banned, cause sooner or later you will =P
easiest way to get banned though, is to play a game that isn't out for sale yet, and let the achievements you earn reach the M$ servers.."
