Plot Summary:.. Boris Zaroff is a modern businessman who
               is haunted by his past -- his father was
               the notorious Count Zaroff of The Most
               Dangerous Game fame. Consequently, Boris
               is subject to hallucinations and
               all-too-real social lapses which normally
               involve sadistic harm to beautiful naked
               young women. His butler is sworn to
               indoctrinating him into the evils of the
               family line, and their castle's torture
               dungeon proves quite useful in this
               regard. However, Boris is periodically
               lured away from his destiny by the
               romantic apparition of the deceased
               countess who previously owned the castle.
