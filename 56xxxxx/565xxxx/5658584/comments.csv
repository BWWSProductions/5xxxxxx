The only reason i couldnt share is because of my ISP upload limit.. u see my ISP got this fucked up offer download speed - 4mb/s but upload speed - 70kb/s
it would take weeks to seed completely for me..
i cant afford weeks in here!!
i can only share 200mb stuff and that takes one day!!
so yeah.... just wanted to say that :)"
