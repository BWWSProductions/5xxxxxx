Zechs Marquise is an El Paso, Texas progressive rock band including members of the Mars Volta (like brothers of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez). Also if you like Tortoise, you'll probably like these guys.
This includes their first EP "34:26" (with the song "Pattern") and their first full length album "Our Delicate Stranded Nightmare".

This is very cool stuff. Go out and buy the albums if you can find them. Go see their shows, as musicians usually get more money from tours than album sales (they're supposed to have a new album this year, so will likely tour). In fact, do anything to support anyone associated with the Mars Volta, the best band in the world :)
