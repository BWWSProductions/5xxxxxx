HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool utility will format any USB flash drive, with your choice of FAT, FAT32, or NTFS partition types. You can also make the disk bootable by specifying a file location. i used this on a 128gb usb stick that i need to be in fat32 format and it worked great.just click and install as easy as that.run as administrator.

Enjoy people and please seed.
