In this torrent You can find the initial release of the experimental game, the latest Crayon Physics Deluxe (53) and more levels than You'll possibly ever finish (I challenge You).

You don't have to pay for any game, for some pirate releases are even better than the original. But keep in mind that just as You had a reason not to give away money, indie creators have to buy food and and pay bills as well. So if You have the means, please donate a cent or two.

Have phun exploring this great title! ;)
