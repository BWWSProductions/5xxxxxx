,famemon78,2010-06-29T18:54Z,Dude.. thanks for this and all but how can anyone remove English subtitles from a French movie !!And u left JUST Bulgarian subtitles! how much space would it have taken if u just left the English subs! I hope u take note of this in ur future uploads or atleast list which subtitles are on the DVD-R so that we know before downloading. Thanks anyways for the effort!
