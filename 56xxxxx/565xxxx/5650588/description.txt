This file includes the latest AKAIO Firmware 1.7, Over 110 English US NDS Roms, 
Several nice Hombrew applications that I like, the latest cheats for almost every new game including up tp MMZ Collection, Pokemon HG SS, etc... Moonshell, a SNES emulator, and GB and GBC emulator + a few games for both.

This also includes a cheat code editor that you can use to add your own cheats and edit cheat files.

Any questions, or prolems just leave a comment.
