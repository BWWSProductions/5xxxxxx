Thanks Shuazien and Inflammo."
,madborred91,2010-06-29T16:51Z,Thank you so much guys!  I appreciate the DLs!!!  Just one question.  Will there be no more Ron and Fez?  Its true that it is a shadow of itself without Dave but Ron is still the man.   Just asking. Thanks again
[T],shuazien,2010-06-29T17:30Z,"I had stopped uploading Ron and Fez because others said they would take over. Currently Inflammo him/her- self is uploading it over at Kick Ass Torrents. You can ask me to re-upload them, however I will probably say no seeing as how I go to work or school directly after I post O&A so I wouldn't be able to post R&F untill late each night. So I say , sorry TPB, abandon this sinking ship and head over to Kick Ass Torrents to get your daily dose of the virus."
