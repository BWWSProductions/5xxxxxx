Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The programme depicts the adventures of a mysterious and eccentric humanoid alien known as the Doctor who travels through time and space in his spacecraft, the TARDIS (an acronym for Time And Relative Dimension In Space), which normally appears from the exterior to be a blue 1950s British police box. With his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of foes and rights wrongs.

The Doctor has been played by eleven actors. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show as regeneration, whereby the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality. Although each portrayal is different, and on occasion the various incarnations have even encountered one another, they are all meant to be aspects of the same character. The Doctor is currently portrayed by Matt Smith, who took up the role after David Tennant's final appearance in an episode broadcast on 1 January 2010.A fifth series of the relaunched programme began on 3 April 2010, in which the Eleventh Doctor is accompanied by Amy Pond, portrayed by Karen Gillan.

Overview

Amy Pond, the young Scottish woman from the English village of Leadworth first met her 'raggedy Doctor' when she was a little girl and had to wait fourteen years before he finally returned and took her off in the TARDIS.

She was brought up by her aunt, without a Mum and Dad. She's very brave, bold and decisive, always ready to confront the problem or force the Doctor to tell her what he's up to. To the Doctor's surprise, she can sometimes see what's going on more clearly than he does. She wants to see the universe before, perhaps, getting back home in time for her wedding day. But that crack in her wall may turn out to be something she can never quite escape.
