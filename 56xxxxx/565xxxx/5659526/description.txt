The confidentiality of sensitive data is threatened by lost USB sticks, online backup, plain text emails or industrial espionage and requires specialized solutions.

MAXA Security Tools is a package containing multiple effective tools, like:

    * MAXA Crypt: Allows 256 bit-strong state of the art encryption and decryption of texts or files and directories into one encrypted file.
    * Steganography: Hide files into JPEG images and WAVE audio files. These container files will remain unsuspicious.
    * File Manipulator: Change file preferences such as date of creation and size and securely erase files so that they cannot be recovered any more.
    * Evidence Remover: Remove traces of visited websites, opened documents, and similar by one mouse click.
    * Document Cleaner: Clear sensitive information out of Word documents before you distribute them.
    * SecureEdit: Create documents containing formatted text and images that can be redistributed in an encrypted executable container file.
    * MAXA-Lock: Lock you computer when you are away from it, ensure you are still protected against unauthorized access with email, Skype or SMS alarm notifications.

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista/W7 machine. It's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
