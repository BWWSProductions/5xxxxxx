,MD88,2010-06-29T00:56Z,Is the audio in English?
,TuffGong81,2010-06-29T05:06Z,"I hope the audio is not in English, it's a Swedish movie with Swedish audio and English subs I would hope."
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2010-06-29T08:04Z,"An english version of the trilogy has yet to be produced. This is version must be sub-titled in english.

Thanks for the UL nonetheless !!"
,Muminfader,2010-06-29T09:46Z,"Just for the fun of it; the direct translation of the title from Swedish to English is not ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", it's ""Men who hate women""."
,dempez,2010-06-29T19:28Z,This is a awesome movie. U must see all three of them. The audio is in swedish and english but with eng sub. GREAT MOVIE 4 ALL TO SEE. 8+
,stickshaker,2010-06-30T00:36Z,How do I watch this movie with subs....
,pekerhed,2010-06-30T01:18Z,Hmmm.  Can't get the .idx subtitles to work with VLC.  Strange.  Anybody else having this issue?
,spacemonkey74,2010-06-30T01:19Z,Are the subtitles for this actually readable (unlike all the other lots of subtitles going round at the moment for this which are in terrible English). How do you recode the movie with subtitles with this subtitle format?
,pekerhed,2010-06-30T01:21Z,Nevermind.  Had to unrar several times....working now.
,spiderworks,2010-06-30T07:54Z,I rarely make adverse comments but what a fukkin waste of time. Subs don't work or are not recognized
,cursed_worm,2010-06-30T08:32Z,"even when subs .idx dont work, you can switch to English audio, i'm using K-lite codec pack (media player classic), Menu Play-->Audio-->""English"" or ""Denmark"", you kno what to choose :)"
,bongowolf,2010-06-30T12:03Z,"SERIOUS VIRUS-TROJANS!!  Dammit.. BONE, your download was OK, but some goddamn fucking slime-eating filthy bastard Seeder has entered your seeding group & sent a SHITLOAD of viruses, trojans, and High Risk PC infections through it!!  

I had emailed this torrent to a friend and he started downloading a short while after I had started. 15 minutes into his download of this torrent - his AVAST began shooting out big  WARNINGS of Trojans, Viruses, & Malware.  He called me and told me to stop my own download. I stopped my torrent & ran several full system scans (Malwarebytes, McAffee, Adware) and found nothing. Meanwhile, my friend's Malwarebytes has picked up 58 virus/trojans; his AVAST is having trouble starting a scan; and his A-Squared Anti-Malware picked up (he said) 124 items - and it said 3 of them were HIGH RISK VIRUSES. He's still trying to clean up his PC as I write this. (he wasn't downloading anything else at the time - he was just watching a DVD on his PC).

We determined that there is a SEEDER in this bunch who has intentionaly shot in a shitload of malware/viruses/trojans.  I strongly suggest to everyone that they be exceedingly careful if you download this torrent. BONE - it isn't your fault, and I'd like to kick the crap out of the Seeder who's doing this.  You're a good guy. But some motherfucker is screwing around with your torrent.

People, you might consider using another torrent for this movie for now. BONE - sorry this had to have happened to you.

,Ezel,2010-06-30T12:28Z,"@bongowolf: So, how do the trojans get past the hash-check of the torrent?"
,Ancient-shark,2010-06-30T17:38Z,"@bongowolf you dont combine more than 1 trojan to a file because its not needed, you only need one trojan to conquer the other persons computer so i doubt he had 57 trojans on his computer after he dled it.. you just dont add more than 1.. would have been a fucking job to crypt that virus then O.o"
,unomi303,2010-06-30T21:42Z,"Great movie, thanks!

,ama90804,2010-07-01T01:55Z,Has anyone gotten the sub to work?
,viciouschodz,2010-07-01T03:12Z,"The subs are missing in this torrent. Someone has unrar'd this torrent and not included the .sub files. I downloaded just the subs from this torrent and unrar'd them and they work fine with this film.

,X04D,2010-07-01T03:25Z,"Can't get English audio with Media Player Classic or VLC, even with the KLite Codec."
,works_honda125,2010-07-01T18:21Z,Downloaded both sub files from different torrent same movie on VLC and still cannot get the subs to work. Too bad this movie seemed good. Thanks to uploader anyway.
,wonderpunk,2010-07-01T19:35Z,to get the subtitles working you need to have both the .idx and .sub files in the same folder as the video. workes in vlc at least...
,works_honda125,2010-07-01T22:49Z,"WonderPunk- Hey thanks alot, seems to have worked. Small details like this can kill the download experience. Cheers."
,dexangers,2010-07-03T03:57Z,"Please, can anyone makes it REALLY CLEAR. Is the audio in English or Swedish?? Is the entire movie in English or not???? many thanks in advance."
,saqlain,2010-07-03T16:46Z,"The audio's in Swedish, but i saw it with subs 
and i recommend this movie
a must watch!!!!"
,paul423,2010-07-05T13:26Z,"Awesome movie!!!

Swedish audio with English subs (good subs).

Compared with Hollywood movies I'll give it a 20 out of 10 !!!   :D"
,paul423,2010-07-05T13:32Z,@ bongowolf: Biggest BULLSHIT i ever heard !!!  Technically impossible!
,davitodude,2010-07-06T02:46Z,"The movie is in both Swedish and English. It clearly says so if you would read it. ""Audio: Swedish / English | AC3 5.1 448kbps"""
,kash79,2010-07-07T00:32Z,"In 2010, the films were shown in an extended version of approximately 180 minutes per film as a six-part miniseries (each film in two parts) on Swedish television. This version will be released on 14 July 2010 on DVD and Blu-ray

cant wait to see the extended version"

,les79,2010-07-23T10:52Z,"Another awesome addition!
Thanks Bone! :)"
,aeddub,2010-07-27T20:13Z,"The subtitles do work; you need to unzip the .rar file (I used 7Zip), which gives you another .rar file and and .idx file - unzip the second .rar file and you'll get the .sub file.  You need to do this for both CD's.  Thanks to the uploader!"
,Maynard46,2010-07-31T00:17Z,"To anyone having trouble getting the sub titles to work here is what you do. After you DL you will have 3 folders in the main folder. These are called CD1, CD2 and Subs. Inside of Subs you have a rar file that you extract with whatever app u use to unzip files (i use winrar). 

Unzip the rar file (not the .sfv file). After you unzip u will have a new folder in the subs folder. Open that new folder and u will see 6 new files. You want to look at the 2 rar files that end with CD1 and CD2....NOTE the cd1.idx and cd2.idx....u will use these in a minute. 

Ok, so unzip the CD1 file and place into the original FOLDER called CD1. After that, go back to  the CD1.IDX file we just noted above and MOVE it into the CD1 folder. 

The CD1 folder should now have the AVI file for the film, the .IDX file, and the .SUB file

Repeat this for the CD2 file and enjoy the film with Swedish audio and English Subs. 

Thanks to the uploader for the great DL. "
,stinki213,2010-08-23T17:25Z,Thanks to the uploader and thanks to Maynard46 for the destructions for the subs!
,bruno416,2010-09-09T06:09Z,"Thanks for the up, can't wait to watch it.  I'm having some trouble with the subs though.  I followed Maynard46' instructions to get the subs and the first part is working but the 2nd part isn't.

I've tried everything I can think of so far including downloading subs from a different version but it still didn't work for the 2nd part of the film.  Can anyone help? Thanks"
,kornspell,2011-05-30T10:13Z,Finally someone with an actual brain shares the original version instead of the stupid dubbed version. Thank you!
,.Twiztid.,2012-01-03T09:17Z,".BONE.   i had to signup and say thank you for all the work you've put out there for us. and this movie is by far one of the best ive seen in a long time. your quality is always top-notch and i couldn't ask for more!  


as for anyone having issues getting the subs to work, it may have been just been me but alot of players didn't work. follow exactly what Maynard46  wrote and download VLC media player, drop the whole folder into the player and your set!

thanks again bone, your the man!"
,muddick,2012-01-17T07:23Z,This is by far the best one you'll find. My only complaint is the quality of the subtitle font is terrible (but good enough).
,Polonia1939,2012-01-29T18:40Z,"Hey, i really want to see this movie, but i can't watch it in the pc, i would rather see it in my PS2, but with the subtitles... anybody knows how i can do this? :X"
