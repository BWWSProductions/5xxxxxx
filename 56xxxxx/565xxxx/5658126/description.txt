This torrent contains Chinese Characters: Learn & Remember 2,178 Characters and Their Meanings, a book by Dr. Alan Hoenig, 
along with all of the study materials that go with the book, downloaded from http://www.ezchinesey.com


I also recommend you download FSI Chinese, Michel Thomas Chinese, Chinesepod (a podcast), and One Minute Mandarin (also a podcast)
I'm not affiliated with any of these groups, nor do I have any of these torrents.
The MT course is in a torrent called "Michel Thomas V2" which you can find on TPB (along with the FSI course)

Here is the amazon link to the book: https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Characters-Learn-Remember-Meanings/dp/0982232403

Please seed, share the knowledge.
