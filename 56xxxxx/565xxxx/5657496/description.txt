Rainmeter


What is Rainmeter?

Rainmeter is a desktop customization platform. Through Rainmeter, you can enhance your
Windows computer at home or work with skins: handy, compact applets which float freely
on your desktop, much like Windows Sidebar gagdgets, or dashboard widgets for the Mac.

Rainmeter skins provide you with useful information at a glance. It's easy to keep an eye
on your system resources, like memory and battery power, or your online data streams,
including email, RSS feeds, and weather forecasts. Many skins are even functional: they can
record your notes and to-do lists, launch your favorite applications, and send your tweets to
Twitter - all in a clean, unobtrusive interface that you can rearrange and customize to your liking.

Every inch of a skin is completely customizable. Rainmeter skins are written in a simple, elegant
language that's easy to learn for anyone who's willing to put in the effort. Skins call upon measures,
a set of powerful built-in modules that do all the heavy lifting, and create interactive meters to
display that information however you decide. In this way, Rainmeter brings productive innovation together
with creative artistry like no other platform of its kind.

To display temperatures, youâ€™ll need the free program â€œSpeedfanâ€.It is included in this torrent.
