Shopping in Shenzhen breaks new grounds by doing something for shoppers thatâ€™s never been done before: it does not have ads, cuts through the bull and show you exactly â€œwhat you need to know.â€ Shopping in Shenzhen will not only bring you to expatriatesâ€™ preferred shopping places, but also to places foreigners never dare to go.Rest assured, not that itâ€™s dangerous, but rather because of the language barrier; little English is spoken there, if any at all. With our tips you should be able to get around easily even though youâ€™re not fluent in Chinese. If you donâ€™t speak Mandarin at all, donâ€™t panic, jump to Tracyâ€™s Chinese Corner page 128 to pick up the keys that will lead you to the best bargains.

Whatâ€™s more? Well, the best is to come. If you thought that Shenzhen was just an industrial city where youâ€™d come and go to do business, a city with nothing much to see, Splendid Shenzhen will bowl you over.
