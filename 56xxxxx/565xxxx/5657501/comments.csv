Stacy Taylor!  Just shows you how long 
it's been since I've listened to 
regular radio.

Sonews:  You told me previously that
the Randi Rhodes site has these as
ASF files?  I was on her site this 
morning and saw Mp3 buttons for
all broadcasts including those from
last week and today's.

But then I'm not a subscriber, so
maybe they need to update that."
