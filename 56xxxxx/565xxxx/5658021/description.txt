Before the Old Kingdom, in the fourth year of the reign of King Amenhotep IV, Queen Nefertiti 

enjoyed unprecedented power, equal only to the Pharaoh himself. However, in the fourteenth year 

of the Kingâ€™s reign, all record of Queen Nefertiti vanished â€¦ until now. Brianna Hastings has 

been trapped in an ancient tomb, and only her sister can save her in Romancing the Seven Wonders 

Great Pyramid, a Hidden Object game.
