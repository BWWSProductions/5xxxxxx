,pixarito,2010-08-26T18:20Z,"KRONOZYKO, the file you download from here won't open on safari; you need a torrent client (this one's great http://www.utorrent.com/)

Then open the torrent file on utorrent and it'll start downloading."

,picxels,2010-09-01T02:31Z,Does this work with the Trial Version from the Autodesk site?
,hicksford,2010-10-19T22:17Z,So what exactly do you do? Do you run this crack after installing the trial version? Or do you need to install the other laggy mac crack that's out there first?
,jzone32,2010-11-14T03:34Z,Is this torrent still downloading for other people? I've been trying to get it for a couple days now but it isn't. Any ideas?

,lego270,2011-01-08T16:13Z,"After I paste the first code to Terminal it's asking for a password, I know what the password is, but for some reason i cannot type anything. nothing on the keyboard registers within terminal. "
,justynr,2011-01-20T02:27Z,"When I run this script... Maya will not open... I get an error... when I look at the details it tells me that the file that has been changed is an older version than the one needed...

I downloaded the trial of Maya 2011 from the Autodesk website, is there a different one I should download?"
