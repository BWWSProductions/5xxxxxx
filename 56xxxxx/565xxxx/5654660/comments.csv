,ThE_DoOmSdAyEr,2010-10-09T05:04Z,"For those who *WILL* get stuck on step 2, the following procedure was accomplished while using Windows XP SP3 32-bit for 3DS Max 2011. It *SHOULD* work for other systems as well...

1. Uninstall IPClamp by double-clicking the installer and clicking ""Remove"".

2. Make a directory in your programs folder called ""cebas"" and create a folder in there called ""ip-clamp"".

3. Install 7-Zip

4. Right-click ""IP-clamp1.2"" and go to ""7-Zip > Open archive""

5. Extract the contents into the folder you created called ""ip-clamp"".

6. Rename ""IPClamp.exe"" to ""IP-Clamp.exe""

7. Rename ""ipclamp.exe1"" to ""ipclamp.exe""

8. Follow the X-Force instructions from step 2.

,ThE_DoOmSdAyEr,2010-10-09T07:06Z,"***DISREGARD THE LAST POST***

Shows what happens when you give steps without trying them yourself!!

1. Install IPClamp.

2. Start Task manager and end the IPClamp process.

3. Go to the directory in your programs folder called ""cebas\ip-clamp""

4. Delete all files from the ip-clamp directory.

5. Install 7-Zip

6. Right-click ""IP-clamp1.2"" and go to ""7-Zip > Open archive""

7. Extract the contents into the folder you created called ""ip-clamp"".

8. Rename ""IPClamp.exe"" to ""IP-Clamp.exe""

9. Rename ""ipclamp.exe1"" to ""ipclamp.exe""

10. Follow the X-Force instructions from step 2.


Now, I havent tried this yet, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. Although the 10-step process mentioned is guaranteed to work... Anyways, instead of using 7-Zip and all that other horse shit, just end the process using task manager. Skip step 3 entirely and just double-click ""ipclamp.exe"" in the cebas directory. Then continue on step 4..."
,Mr3DSMaxMaster,2010-11-20T17:27Z,"aha I have found out how to write comments at last! OK here is my difficulty with this one, I follow the instructions but when it comes to installing '7-zip' where would I find it, I have looked and looked, please help.

I used the options above but when I click on crack and select the dir, I get an error ""Cannot open files! Please close license manager""
but license manager is not running!, I tried uninstalling then ""cracking"" but still get the same error. any help?"
,Clickey0007,2010-11-30T20:13Z,"btw, using windows 7"
,Clickey0007,2010-12-01T13:58Z,"FINALY INSTALLED
After 2 days of searching on google and forums , I found what the problem was.

1. Instal IP-clamp 1.2, *DO NOT REBOOT* and *DO NOT EXECUTE IT*!

2. Fire our keygen, press Crack and pick Cebas/Ip-clamp dir.
   (only the public crypto key will be patched)
******* NOTE******* if you get an error saying to stop the service, press alt+ctrl+del and check if ipclamp is actualy running. If yes, then close it and try Cracking again. If you still get the same error, go to C:\Program Files\Cebas\Ip-clamp , left click on IP-Clamp and select Run as Administrator (or else it wont work correctly). When its open, on the lower right of the window theres a button named ""Close"" - you want to click that. Then go back and run the Keygen as Administrator and crack it.

4. Launch IP-Clamp.exe and choose 'localhost' as primary network adapter, apply.

4. Create a request file using your personnal informations
   and a licence code generated by our keygen.

5. Use keygen to generate a valid licence ipclamp.lic from this request.
   Save the lic where except in IPClamp's dir (otherwise you won't
   be able to import the it).

6. Import your licence in IP-Clamp."

,NYTropix22,2011-03-04T01:51Z,"Nevermind, guys..i figured it out!"
,jdbsnipe,2011-03-04T12:29Z,"I'm Stuck on this one, someone please post clear instructions, cant get the crack to work. Really wanna use this plugin"
,philipxx,2011-05-24T19:03Z,"The reason that you get an error message when click the crack button is because the license manger is running right after it has installed.

To fix the problem, simply go to contol panel and start up the Service Manager tool.

Looking for a service called ""IP-Clamp Licensing Service by cebas VISUAL TECHNOLOGY Inc."" and stop the service (Right Click and choose STOP).

Continue with step 2 in the given instructions and everything should work - No other changes required!"
