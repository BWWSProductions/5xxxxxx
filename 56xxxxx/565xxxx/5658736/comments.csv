The File runs a file is injected [binded] with a trojant named server.exe which runs an exe called, winlog.exe. They both get an A.V Hit plus they open connections to his computer, im not gonna post his I.P for security concerns. Do Not Download This Program Or You Will Become A Slave To Him. If you don't believe me look at the emulation report of the executable.
