Notes:
Waka Waka (This Time For Africa), written and co-produced by global
superstar Shakira, has been chosen as the Official Song of the upcoming
2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The song combines Afro-Colombian
instrumentation and rhythms with a rousing Soca beat and Southern African
guitar. The chorus borrows from a favorite Cameroonian marching chant
made popular by the group Golden Voices.
