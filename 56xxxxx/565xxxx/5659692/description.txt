Bonjouuuuur ! Flex Blur speaking.

Well, I planned to do a mix and release a new album, both of them Japan-styled, but as far as I don't work on the album, last days I was working on my MIDI/USB controllers' configuration so I can mix using them, inside Traktor Pro. So, as I didn't have an Internet connection, I spent my whole last Monday and Tuesday to select effects, clicking on "Learn" and pressing buttons, turning the knobs and moving the sliders, then putting some stickers where I wrote things on, so I can know what this button does, and this knob, oh and these two sliders, blah blah. I did some tests, and it gave an EP absolutely not serious. It has 5 tracks and is called traktorwork, where I play with japanese songs : capsule, Shinichi Osawa and Aira Mitsuki are my main ideas bringers. This EP is most likely a trailer of my mix to come. There we are, I hope that you will like it !
