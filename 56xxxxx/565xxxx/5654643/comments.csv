,gipen,2010-07-20T21:03Z,"Not sure it works. Anyway after applying the patch process, at the first run, the enter key / 30 days trial dialog appears. I guessed I should choose the 30 days trial. See you in 30 days."
,Dartster,2010-07-26T06:34Z,Do you have the patch for 64 bit?
,RivieraDude,2010-09-08T02:41Z,"Did the installation all by the book, no connection etc, but the patch is either bogus or made by a useless wannabe cracker.
It doesn't work at all."
