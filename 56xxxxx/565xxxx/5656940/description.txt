The Naked Ape is the fifth release from the Argentinian netlabel Hispanodelicius Records, an organization dedicated to bringing you the best of the Latin American psychedelic underground. Compiled and mastered by Dark Fox, these South American audio alchemists have prepared a journey that begins in the cold lands of Tierra del Fuego in the far south, passes through the Patagonian forests full of stories and mythologies, soars up the Andes into Chile, and reaches the high plains of Bolivia. Accelerating rhythms tuned to the frequency of trance dance unfold to reveal the primal language of mankind, shutting off our cultural operating system and inspiring a sense of liberation.
