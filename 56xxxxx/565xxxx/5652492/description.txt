This is a high quality dvd rip of "Father of the Bride - part 1".  It is one of my wife's favorite movies.  Unfortunately, it is not available on bluray/hd...and while the 700mb rip suffices for many, I like a little better quality when I'm watching on my 50-inch lcd.  And I want to get all I can out of my surround sound system (the other rip's audio is mp3 2.0).  This file may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  It is fairly large at 2.0 gb, but still less than half the size if you were going to keep the original dvr/vob's/iso image.
