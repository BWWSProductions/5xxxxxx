thanx"
,monkey_brain,2010-07-20T13:12Z,awesome upload! keep up the good work!!
,ryswe01,2010-07-29T06:26Z,Thanks for the up!  Been looking for a compile for a long time.
,steviekeyz,2010-07-29T17:22Z,"Props to the encoder the 95-98MB per episode is perfect. Especially for the HDRips I noticed in season 14. Although not the best quality, still better than that RM crap that used to come out and was about 36mb. 

I'd give it an 8/10 due the size being doubled just for season 7-14 in 720p.

Some episodes look great! While some are just so-so.

Anyways thx again!! WILL SEED :)


Just be aware if you use VLC player that the META Tags are incorrect and they will display the same name of the episode if your making a playlist."

You deserve more seeds. This torrent is LEGIT and Amazing. A lot of work and effort is shown in this torrent and that is not a thing you see very often on TPB. Awesome work man, you have my thanks!

,The_Meow_Of_The_Century,2010-11-12T03:03Z,"@Tii-Kun
Download a file call DivX Plus Player
These files are in .mkv 
You have to download DivX
It's pretty easy
Once you download DivX you can watch it through their player, or Windows Media Player (my preference)
I just go to properties and make the default player WMP. Hope this helped."
,zhool,2010-11-21T03:08Z,"remarkably good quality for the size; clean edges and motion, audio levels are good - nice work :)

get vlc or a codec pack (klite is good) if u havent used .mkv b4"

,MzAmyz,2011-03-20T02:49Z,Would it be able to play on a playstation 3 ? :)
,Cgoff87,2011-04-05T08:46Z,"Through a media server like PS3 Media Server or TVersity yes, but to put on the PS3 and save, no because it doesn't support mkv type files.

Perhaps you can mod your PS3 to play different codecs, but it will cost you your access to the PSN."

[T],MrLore,2012-05-01T20:27Z,"If (like I did) you didn't have any audio on the ""South Park - S00E01 - The Spirit of Christmas (Jesus vs. Frosty).avi"" file with an error code like this:

majortype: MEDIATYPE_Audio {73647561-0000-0010-8000-00AA00389B71}
subtype: Unknown GUID Name {34616D69-0000-0010-8000-00AA00389B71}

Open up the ffdshow audio decoder configuration then on the codecs list, locate ""IMA ADPCM"" and change the decoder from disabled to whatever codec is available to you (libavcodec perhaps).

Other than that, great torrent, thanks!"
