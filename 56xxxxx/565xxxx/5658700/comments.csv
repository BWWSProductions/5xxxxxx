I've had to go to Etorrent and torrentzap for my GB after it all dissapeared here...ghostsquirrel is putting out the whole radio show, but that is a bit too much for me...the 1 hour tv show does nicely."

While there was a dry spell for several months web-wide (and I didn't have cable!), I don't know about hard to find currently; JoeSchmuck is also posting current episodes in AVI format... the more, the merrier, I always say. 
I don't see it as redundant, since some may miss torrents from one source, and find something in another. Wherever you can get it, in whatever format you like... it simply needs to be out there. Someone is also posting the radio show with video - but I'm one of many who don't have several hours to spend watching the ep. The FOX News hour is a nice condensed presentation, and gets the necessary points across."
