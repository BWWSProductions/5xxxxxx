The first episode (which is 1 and 2 together as it was a season premier), was cut off at the end, only by a minute or so, but was cut off. episode ""3"" is bugged about 32:48 when Lexi and Sloan are talking. And I just watched part of episode 5 i think it was, and i couldn't stand it, the video was so choppy and just completely unwatchable. For the total file size and  the claim to ""highres"" I figured this would be of impeccable quality, but it failed so many ways in just the first 5 episodes."

Apparently my VLC is totally screwed up, I should have assumed so before and tried other players. I rewatched the first few episodes and the glitching and other crap that happened were cleared up. I don't know how to remove comments (if possible) so I'm making this post to once again apologies to the poster of this torrent."
