[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-29T06:11Z,"no problem, Queen Greatest Hits is next :D

i'm waiting untill i save up the $ to get the Led Zeppelin Mothership boxset. 

i find that Atlantic Records use very inferior vinyl so the sound comes out all muffled. but the mothership set is pressed on 180 gram virgin vinyl so yeah just wait for it ;)"
