Alex talks with Charlie Veitch of the Love Police and Dan Dicks of Press for Truth from downtown Toronto where the globalists are gathered for the G20. Charlie was arrested last week for refusing to show ID to police under a draconian police state law enacted specifically for the G20. Dan has covered the imposition of the police state in the lead-up to the globalist confab.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
