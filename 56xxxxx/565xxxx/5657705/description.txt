Instructions:
=============

Unzip the tarball (.tar.gz) in the ISO folder (i.e. WinRAR).

You should have 3 ISO files, mount the one that says, 'ageofempires_gold_appleXs' and run 'autorun.exe'.

Mount and install the other ones also (_theageofkings_ and then _theconquerers_).

Whenever you want to play, either burn the ISO images to a dvd (3 separate ones) or mount it with a program like Roxio Toast. This should bypass the 'Insert DVD Error'.

No serial is required.
