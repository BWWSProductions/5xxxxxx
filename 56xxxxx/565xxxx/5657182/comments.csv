,questar,2010-07-25T18:32Z,"I downloaded the first five movies. There are two minor problems:

(1) While the video quality is great, the audio is only 96Kbps MP3. This is about as good as FM radio.

(2) The aspect ratio is wrong. The first three movies have an aspect ratio of 2.0 while the originals are 2.35. The next two movies have an aspect ratio of 1.5 while the originals are 1.85. This makes everyone look unnaturally skinny.

Most media players have an option to set the display aspect ratio. You can also permanently fix the aspect ratio with the free ffmpeg program as follows:

ffmpeg -i *1978*.avi -acodec copy -vcodec copy -aspect 2.35 Halloween_1.avi

""ffmpeg"" invokes the ffmpeg program
""-i *1978*.avi"" tells ffmpeg to read the first Halloween movie as the input file.
""-acodec copy"" tells ffmpeg to simply copy the audio data.
""-vcodec copy"" tells ffmpeg to simply copy the video data.
""-aspect 2.35"" tells ffmpeg to write in the output file that the display aspect ratio is 2.35.
""Halloween_1.avi"" is the name of the output file.

The output file will be nearly identical to the input file except that it'll have data to automatically tell the media player to render the video with an aspect ratio of 2.35.

ffmpeg is available from:
