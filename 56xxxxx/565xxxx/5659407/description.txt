See how the Bible applies to your world. As you see the Total Onslaught on Jesus Christ and His Kingdom, you will be amazed at how close we really are! (36 DVDs) 1. Just Another Man? In this video, Biblical evidence that Jesus is the Messiah is presented in multimedia format. The ancient prophecies are unravelled, particularly the prophecy in Daniel 9 on the seventy weeks which pinpoints the exact time of the Messiah's arrival on Earth.

The study of this prophecy has even been cursed by some theologians who do not wish to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. Study the evidence revealed in this video and you make your own conclusions. 2. Where Jesus Walked This video takes us on a journey through ancient Palestine retracing the steps of the Master and highlighting His great teachings, including the Sermon on the Mount, and key parables. The life and ministry of Christ, His birth, and death on the cross are portrayed in multimedia format in a though-provoking study. You will enjoy this look into the life of Christ. 3. An Advocate For Our Time The sanctuary in one of the great typological features of the Bible. Every aspect of the sanctuary points to the ministry of the Messiah.

By a study of all its features, the plan of salvation unfolds before our eyes. In this lecture, the significance of each and every article of furniture in the sanctuary in explained and the depth of meaning unfolded. The sanctuary was not arbitrary. It was a lesson book for all generations. 4. The Mists of Time In Daniel chapter 2, King Nebuchadnezzar has a dream in which he sees a great statue through which is to be revealed the history of the world to the very close of time. The startlingly detailed vision tells us where we are in history and what events are about to occur on Earth.
