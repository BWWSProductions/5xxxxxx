Seriously, this is class writing.  Subtle, patient, descriptive, and accurate to the time (professional historians say they cannot fault the research)."

There is but one slight omission: You have been tempted to provide each and every page with headers identifying author and title of each book. What happens when you convert the pdf or doc file to for instansce epub, is that this information is distributed in large type all over the place. It is easily undone, although a bit time-consuming, in Word, but the pdf files demand Acrobat professional. Nevertheless, well done! I too have a long standing with Aubrey and the rest and look forward to read them anew without the hindrance of the clumsiness of a paperback."
