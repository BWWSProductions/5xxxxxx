This pack wouldn't have been possible without eztv, VTV, TvTeam, etc., thank you all! But as I recoded the stuff, this time I take credit ;)...

Please be patient,  uploadspeed is 1Mbit, which means after 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.
