The Phantom is a 4-hour original Syfy movie with the 2 parts back to back.

The Phantom tells the story of Kit Walker whose family was murdered when he was a kid, but has no recollection of it. Now he is living with his adoptive parents and is a law student who does parkour in his free time.

Unbeknownst to him, he is next in line to become The Phantom, a role which had been passed on from father to son for generations in his family since the 1500's.
