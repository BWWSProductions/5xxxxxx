Plot: Roger Corman helped unleash Dinocroc in 2004. Then he let loose Supergator
in 2007. In 2010 these rampaging reptiles will collide in an epic smackdown
of Syfy proportions: Dinocroc vs. Supergator! Cult filmmaker Jim Wynorski
(Chopping Mall, Return of Swamp Thing) serves as fight promoter. The late
David Carradine will make one of his final appearances as a referee in-
between these two toothy titans.
