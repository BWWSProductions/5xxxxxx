In January 2009 it was a patch of lawless Afghan desert, riddled with Taliban fighters. Today, Camp Leatherneck is home to more than 10,000 troops. Go inside the epicenter of the war in Afghanistan and meet the men and women who work in and pass through the camp. Learn what daily life is like for the people who find themselves in this place. How violence, boredom, excessive heat, separation from family and cultural differences affect the mind-set of the warriors.
