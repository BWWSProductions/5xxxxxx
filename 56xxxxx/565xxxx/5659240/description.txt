10 WAYS TO KILL BIN LADEN recaps the 10 boldest, most ingenious missions employed thus far to capture or kill the Al Qaeda leader. The first such operation dates back to 1998 and the Clinton administration, before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks made bin Laden the most notorious and most hunted man in the world. The special also dissects why these missions were ultimately and often frustratingly unsuccessful.
