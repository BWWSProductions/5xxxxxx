http://www.rlslog.net/category/games/pc"
,cos13,2010-06-28T00:23Z,unziped probably
[T],extremezone,2010-06-28T00:24Z,"because this is not as archive , just iso (if you will download as rar files you will get same size when you will extract them)"
,TiGORiN,2010-06-28T12:12Z,"I am sooo curious why would anyone download almost twice the size of the RARed game, just so they download the .iso"
,achmid,2010-06-29T13:17Z,In case there is an error in the rar.
,Graveworms,2010-06-29T20:34Z,"@TiGORiN

Maybe us that don't want to bother with free hdd space with unpacking etc and want the unpacked deal ready to just be installed

(yeah, its 4gb+7gb total when you unpack it, THEN you can remove the 4gb, but it's still annoying)"
,Graveworms,2010-06-29T20:35Z,And as achmid said
,axxis1111,2010-06-30T04:59Z,"IF you have problems saving, try this:

#1. navigate to your disciples 3 installation folder e.g. C:\Disciples III\
#2. create a folder called save  e.g. C:\Disciples III\save\ "
,Thype,2010-06-30T20:27Z,"@ axxis1111
Worked great, thanks mate!"
,TaishiFox,2010-07-01T16:37Z,"Doesn't seem to work for me, keeps asking for original disk :-/"
,dustinwebb,2010-07-01T17:48Z,"@TaishiFox

there is a crack in the iso mount and view folder

also power iso gave error works great with alcohol 120%"
,taelus,2010-07-03T02:06Z,"Anyone else getting an error when you try to install?

I'm hitting ""ShellExecuteEx failed; code 2.  The system cannot find the file specified"".

Now I wait for the inevitable really simple and obvious thing I didn't think to do."
,poilkioi,2010-07-03T22:23Z,To work around 'ShellExecuteEx failed; code 2. The system cannot find the file specified': right-click DIIISetup.exe and select 'Run as administrator'
,bham99,2010-07-04T06:54Z,is it working?
,MaskmanX,2010-07-05T11:51Z,"^
its working.. too bad, i don't like the game.. the graphics is so-so even though its much better than the first two..

King's Bounty is way better than this one.."
,gutssnow,2010-07-08T09:20Z,"this game aint working,every time i click install it gives me this error: """"SHELLExecuteEx failed;code2,the system cannot find the file specified.

don't waste your time and bandwidth its a broken download,its not working.
"
,gutssnow,2010-07-08T09:25Z,"I'm sorry guys, please ignore my first comment about the gome not installing or working,the solution is as many have noted to click on DISIII with the right mouse button and choose run as administrator."
,leo4226,2010-07-11T14:19Z,Maybe a stupid question..rnbut where is the ViRALiTY folder with the crack?
,leo4226,2010-07-11T14:43Z,"I\'m sorry ViTALiTY, I\'ve looked everywhere but can\'t find it. Copy the crack from ViTALiTY folder,rnwhere is the crack and where is the ViTALiTY folder?"
,leo4226,2010-07-11T17:02Z,"I\'ve found it but now I\'ve another question. There is no text, if I start the game and you\'re coming in the menu there are only balks with no text"
,MappeMupp,2010-07-12T11:25Z,has anyone other than me noticed all the bugs in hotseat? is this an incomplete version or what\'s the deal?
,soulnafien,2010-07-16T18:20Z,"Is it just me, or when u select Hard mode, it is ridiculously hard. You are like lvl 1 and they send a lvl 11 unit against you. You cast lightning on him pre battle, and his base HP increase by 250 instead of doing dmg. Hack prevention measure?"
[V],Murlok,2010-07-19T17:36Z,Thx m8 I test it :)
,JimmyTheSkullCap,2010-07-28T23:51Z,"So installation went fine, but when i start the game, the mouse cursor wont move, what gives?"

,jinbaru,2011-06-14T09:06Z,ok to everyone looking for the crack its accualy not that hard to get to and this will only help if your using deamon tools... once you have the iso mounted hit the start menu -> computer -> right click on the virtual drive you have mounted -> open (or open in new window). and thats where the vitality folder is with the crack
,JayNaxious,2011-08-01T00:54Z,"the torrent works, but this 1.6 version of the game is a bug fest. i would say this game is 60% finished or less. Its still playable though"
,MitchAllen,2012-06-07T19:21Z,So can we update to 1.06.2 ? Cause gamecopyworld.com has a crack for it and i found a patch just checking before hand.
