,selyo,2010-06-27T12:15Z,"Guys dont just use the ""ubiorbitapi2.dll"" and copy it on the UBIlancher 
this is what you should do.

1.Uninstall ubilanucher NO NEED FOR IT.

2.Copy all the files and i mean EVERY THING IN THE GAME DIR .
3. Enjoy no bugs and no crashes and no doors want open etc............... 



And 

Dont play in a Normal diffuclty

use Easy mode 

if you already use the normal diffculty mode and your stck can open a door ect....

just lower the diffculty 

press ESC and its the forth line 
that should make you game work smoothly 

Have fun "
