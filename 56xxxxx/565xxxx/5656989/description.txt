Based on the well-loved novels of P.G. (Pelham Grenville) Wodehouse, this British series featuring Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, chronicles the misadventures (romantic and otherwise) of the impeccably dressed Bertie Wooster and his trusty and sagacious valet, Jeeves. Peppered with sporting dialogue and memorable, dim-witted and eccentric character.

I you watch Hugh Laurie on House and have not seen him in a British comedy before - prepare to be astounded.
(many thanks to the original seeder)
