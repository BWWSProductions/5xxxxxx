,QueenAmnesia,2010-07-21T01:28Z,"Well, i tried to download and mount this file now 3 times (DTLite).

Unfortunaly i can mount all CDs exceot the first one.

Maybe its a failure with DTLite (havnt tried it with other software yet), but at the moment it doesnt work for me personally."
,5ilent5hift,2010-07-21T15:45Z,"Having the same problem as QueenAmnesia, can't mount the first CD image.

Also using DTLite, so it could be a problem with that... Any idea's?

Thanks"

I remember seeing a great Black Edition torrent, that I unfortunately gave up on because install said I didn't have DirectX9 (Win 7 user here).

Looking at these seeds, dang, probably better off with standard Most Wanted. I've got Black Edition on my PS2 console, it's all but a one classic Camaro Z28 pursuit challenge ? And never tuning/pimping it.

Stay Hood and Manual niglets."
