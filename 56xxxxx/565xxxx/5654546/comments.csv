I am seeding, so download the torrent anyway and it'll start once the tracker comes back online."

Publicbt is up, so add these to the torrent trackers."
,redpoodle,2010-07-01T09:05Z,"I can play all the files except the Muse.mp4. VLC, WMP Classic, Quicktime all say they cant render the file. 

Just curious if anyone else was having the same problem? Thanks to the OP for the great posts!"
,Xaverri,2010-07-01T10:57Z,"Yes, I have the same sadly enough. Muse was the only thing I really wanted to see! I used VLC and got no errors, it just skims through the file very fast without showing any images or playing any sound. Takes about 3 seconds."
,romadu,2010-07-01T17:22Z,"Muse not working for me either. Please repost - that's the real highlight for this day :)

Thanks for the huge post, btw"
,daviddanut,2010-07-02T02:07Z,"Bugger, I just tried to play Muse aswell, realised it was dead and came here to redownload my own file, fail...

I'm redownloading it off iPlayer at the moment, i'll repost the torrent tomorrow."
,redpoodle,2010-07-02T02:24Z,Thanks for re-downloading! I'll seed it when I get it!
,Xaverri,2010-07-02T03:14Z,"Awesome, thanks so much! I'll seed as much as I can as well (gonna move this weekend :P)"
,daviddanut,2010-07-02T15:43Z,"Torrent re-uploaded at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5664387.

I've checked that it works this time!"
