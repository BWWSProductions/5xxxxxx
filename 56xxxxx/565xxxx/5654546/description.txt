If you don't want the Muse performance you're an idiot, but might aswell download this torrent for the time being as it has more seeds.

Apologies, haven't actually watched any of these yet so I can't comment on the quality.

All files were downloaded from BBC iPlayer with iPlayer Downloader

If you need a video player for them just grab VLC player. It's free and will play virtually anything.

Audio's a bit crap as it's off iPlayer so you may want to stick some extra bass on while you're listening to it.

Enjoy!
