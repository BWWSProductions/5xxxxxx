,ricky_johnson22,2010-06-30T22:59Z,"u have got to be kidding me, this film was not only the most boringest film i have seen in the last ten years but the ending is not even there, the film is cut short by at least 20 minutes, so thanks for nothing extremezone for not even checking ur own torrents!!!!"

,jaydog912,2010-06-30T23:56Z,"I don't know where people get the balls to bitch about something that is FREE! Also extremezone doesn't have to put anything on here for allof us leechers, and that goes for any uploader. They all put stuff on here so we the leechers get free stuff. So to all of you that bitch and moan about stuff, just think about who you are bitching at. Thanks extremezone for all your torrents, and your bandwith for sharing. "
,negativethree,2010-07-01T00:32Z,Thanks!

,noelkudo,2010-07-02T19:38Z,"This is probably a stupid question, but hey, what would the internet be without snide comments:

What does REPACK mean?"
,OGma59,2010-07-02T21:51Z,"hey, ""ricky johnson22"" is 22 your IQ?  ""the most boringest movie""????  did you quit school in the first grade or what??

Extremezone:  can you please answer the query ""is this the complete movie, or is the ending missing"".  your previous comment made the matter unclear.
thanks!"
,bigporch,2010-07-03T03:19Z,Does this have the ending or not? Waiting to download until confirmed.
,jadedknutsak,2010-07-03T04:52Z,"For the last time, teh Repack, teh Repack, teh Repack, is a complete movie.  Idiots need to see it three times.  "
,stylekat,2010-07-05T09:48Z,The end is most certianly missing. I have watched it. 
,spock324,2010-07-06T07:08Z,What is a repack?? fucking idiots. 
,Esmad3,2010-07-12T10:12Z,I just dl\'ed and all the end credits is there
,newmouse,2010-07-13T20:47Z,"Some people saying the ends not there.rnI find it is & the end titles as well...V9: A9 ...It does end rather abruptly.rnI have a file size for the Film alone of rn732,651,520 bytesrnTotal playing length 1 hour 47 mins 18 secs.rn rnIts a thoughtful light domestic drama. rnIf your looking for a light comedy romance then forget this.@@@"
,with_teeth100,2010-07-16T16:34Z,Weirdest movie evar...lol
,cyber_d9,2010-07-16T16:40Z,What a shit film
,xMajesticMeteorx,2010-07-20T15:05Z,"I hope he gets laid in this one, lol.
And I highly recommend ""Winter's Bone""-- it wasn't on here July 18, 2010 but I pulled it from somewhere else. Damn it's good, and I'm sure all guys will want to bang that hillbilly girl."
,Just4funak2,2010-07-24T16:56Z,This is now the worst movie I have ever seen
,yakubee,2010-08-08T10:11Z,"The end is most certainly NOT missing.  I have watched it.

The people saying that the end is missing are confused and stupid.

The movie ends in an unconventional way, I suppose.  It doesn't end with ""THE END"", or people riding horses into the sunset, which bugs some people I guess.    

The ending IS THERE and the movie is great."
,jerm74,2010-10-23T08:05Z,"I can't understand why anyone would say this is a good movie. There was no plot, no character development, no conflict or resolution. Maybe the end is there, maybe it isn't, but either way save your bandwidth and and 107 minutes of your life."
,bc1990,2010-11-11T13:55Z,"uh, jerm, you didn't watch the movie then."
,e3limitless,2011-11-10T13:23Z,"This movie actually fustrates me.. There is no story line at all, its like they put hidden camera of people living there life. The thing is ""THERE LIFE IS BORING"", I was hoping ben stiller would save the day... BUT HE DIDN'T! Theres music threw 95% of the movie, it's better classified as a musical over a comedy! I recomend DOWNLOADING THIS SO YOU CAN AGREE WITH ME! ***NOW HES DUMPING DOG FOOD IN A TOILET !!!"
