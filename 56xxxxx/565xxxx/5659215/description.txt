Plot Summary

Code:
The Hangman, starring internationally acclaimed actor Om Puri (East is East, Jewel in the Crown, City of Joy and Gandhi), is a story about one manï¿½s quest to attain redemption. Puri, who gives a compelling performance as the aged and tired executioner Shiva, has been forced into his forefathersï¿½ profession.

Shivaï¿½s overwhelming desire is to create a better life for his son Ganesh (Shreyas Talpade). Shiva seeks help from his friend, the prison jailor (Gulshan Grover). Ganesh is taken to the city under the jailorï¿½s guardianship where he pursues his fatherï¿½s ultimate dream of becoming a police officer. But a series of ill-fated events result in a startling tragedy.

Based in a culture full of ancient customs and traditions, this bittersweet tale follows Shiva as he struggles between the mandates of his profession and his desire to achieve salvation and happiness.
