I read the book, tried to watch this, TOTAL waste of time, it definitely SUCKS !! The Books were very good, at least for science fiction back in the seventies...."
,shinobiung,2010-06-29T22:59Z,"the only way to make this film any worse was to do what holiwood does and add thin long bearded terrorists in reasonable clothing who one day take over yankland by reading books and destroying all the tanks, nuclear bombs and submarines in america's docks by abstinence and tea totalism"

Like this movie is actual shit, I took a shit earlier today and thats what I ended up flushing,..... it's soooo bad that I actually logged in to TPB to write a comment.
