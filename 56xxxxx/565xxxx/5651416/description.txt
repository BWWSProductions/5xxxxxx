Everyone who has ever lived on Earth has been resurrected simultaneously in this strange new world.

Determined to find Jessie, Matt joins forces with an intrepid crew including a 13th century female warrior and Riverboat captain Mark Twain.

Embarking upriver, their adventure begins, all the while tracked by the watchful eye of a mysterious alien force.
