Can i crack this one?


dunno, can you? you can try, it is an untouched ISO image directly  from the disk. the description helps with how to activate for ppl without a key, but any pc with this os pre installed, can use the product key on side panel, but if you are able to crack it, feel free, and even call it your own, since you did the work, but a shout out to where they can find the untouched version , is nice.  Good Luck"

Hi, this error of autorun.dll you are getting is due to the either due to use of corrupt cd or it may also possible that the dvd drive which you are using is not able to read properly due to which you are not able to copy that particular file to your computer and getting the error. So, just make sure that you are using a good quality of cd as well as drive so that the files which are needed at the time of installation will be copied properly to the hard disk and you don't get any type of error.

USE ACTIVE ISO(free) to burn a ISO copy on slow or suggested setting

and use a clean dvd, and even air blow your dvd drive, but if isos are burned too fast, that can happen"

[T],GWpirateGW,2010-08-22T08:07Z,"@xNoxiusx

1, you need a dvd, not a cd to install vista.

2. sounds like maybe you formatted ur usb wrong? sorry, It has been forever and a day since I installed xp via usb, and have not tried vista, but I found alot of answers on google by searching the error code you provided"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-08-22T08:11Z,"@twissta   go download Utorrent, I dont use vuse sorry

@xNoxiusx  google is your friend. Use it

I havent tried a usb install for vista, so cant say but found alot of advise by a 2 minute google search on your issue"

sorry hate to yell.

contact me on you||tube under MrGWGProductions if you need help or got questions, as I do not always get on tpb in a timely manner.

@ranrcha
yes sata supported

@JpkJ 
your welcome

@amfefe925

back up your files and do a clean install. burn with Active ISO to a dvd on lwest settings. burn 2 or even 3 copies if you fear 1 dvd may not work properly.

@star2shine

I would see why not. As this ISO is a retail, not a certain brand OS. SOme OS work only for some pcs. This should work, provided you have a retail key and not a os key for a certain pc. Also I did not have a key on mine, so I do not know about the repair features

@JJamo

hmmm good question indeed. I am not sure if the oversea vista OS has anything different but this OS was a retail version in the U.S. so I can not confirm. Sorry"

,life234,2012-05-03T01:06Z,If you are using this CD you MUST have a key to activate the product.  If you have your laptop and it came with vista as a factory installation on your laptop just simply put that product key located on the bottom of your laptop in for the activation code.
