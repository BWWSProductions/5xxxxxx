[V],twentyforty,2010-06-30T18:56Z,"@houruoha: I was asked nicely this morning and I considered 520+ BiA version (eztv is JUST an uploaders-group and has nothing with files) as ""really big"" and I was thinking that people would recognize saving of 300 MB (approx. 0.6 US dollars saved per each download). Even people who don't pay by the traffic, pays anyway, right?

Rest is history. Obviously this show attracts steady crowd which couldn't care less for solidarity and less fortunate people."
