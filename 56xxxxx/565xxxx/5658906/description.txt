MOTE: In this format - it cannot be smaller (PlayTime: 1h 3mn) and due to the 
      nature of the show (mostly live show) I wont encode next episode. 
      It is too big and interest is really really small AND comprised 
      of "eztv trained" crowd - 288 downloads so far BUT ONLY FIFTEEN peers 
      seeded back to at least 1:1 ratio. 
      Sorry, I cannot do such shows.
