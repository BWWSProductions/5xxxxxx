,analu,2010-07-05T18:31Z,"explain something to me: how is this aXXo when aXXo has disappeared over an year ago? and there are still hundreds of aXXo files being uploaded all the time, although there are no official aXXo accounts anywhere??!... 

don't get me wriong - i'm downloading and i'm sure the file is great, and i'll be seeding for a while too - but i was an aXXo die hard fan from the start and i miss him, and i'm sick of ppl using his fame to pass on virus and crappy files and stuff...

i mean, how can we be sure it's aXXo quality anymore?...

anyway, cheers and tanx 4 the up.

p.s.: i've seen this movie in a theatre already - trust me: one of the best endings EVER! great story, great acting, too."
