"Fool's Day" is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was the band's first single since 2003's "Good Song". The track was released as a 7" for Record Store Day, with only 1000 copies made. On April 18, to "avoid fans having to illegally obtain an inferior copy of this track from pirate sites", the band made the song a free download on their website in both MP3 and WAV formats.
