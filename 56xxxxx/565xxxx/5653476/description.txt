In Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, Annie Oakley used a mirror to shoot a rifle over her shoulder. William Tell shot an apple off his son's head with a crossbow. Whether it's the Romans shooting flaming arrows or Barbarians slinging stones, history is filled with legendary tales of amazing marksmanship. Now, HISTORY is tapping into these inspiring feats of sharp-shooting for it's first-ever competition series and one contestant will emerge with a $100,000 prize package and the title of "Top Shot".
