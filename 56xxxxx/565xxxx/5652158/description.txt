Digital Atmosphere is a powerful weather forecasting program that allows you to create detailed maps of real-time weather for anywhere in the world. It makes extensive use of techniques and algorithms that are comparable and in some cases superior to the National Weather Service's multimillion-dollar computers. It runs on any Windows system, and uses free data from government and university sources on the Internet.

This is an excellent program for storm chasing, pilots, sailors, or anyone needing the highest quality weather data. It works great on a laptop with a GPS!
