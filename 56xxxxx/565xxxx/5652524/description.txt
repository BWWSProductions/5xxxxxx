â€™Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions Youâ€™d Only Ask Your Doctor After
Your Third Martiniâ€™ will an ideal choice for readers who have ever questioned
particular aspects of their body relative to widely misunderstood functionalities,
but could never quite muster the courage to ask a medical professional. It is sure
to be a valuable tool for readers looking to educate themselves in the subject of
the body that relates to its odd functions, while not only becoming engrossed in
the subject matter, but amused as well. Among some of the other questions to which
youâ€™ll encounter answers that can only be described as "humorous" and "educational",
apart from the titular question, include: "Why do old persons grow hair in their ears?",
"Why does asparagus cause oneâ€™s urine to smell?", "How do people in wheelchairs engage
in sexual intercourse?", "Is it possible to lose oneâ€™s contact lenses inside oneâ€™s head
forever?", "Do microwaves cause cancer?", and "Is it bad to crack oneâ€™s knuckles?"
