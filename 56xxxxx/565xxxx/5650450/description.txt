Take an unprecedented journey with the US Navy's latest weapon in the global fight against terrorism: the SSGN or 'guided missile submarine.' Join Captain Randy Crites and the crew of the USS Florida as they engage in a clandestine Joint Operations mission with Special Operations Forces: sneaking Navy SEALs on to shore to identify a terrorist target, and taking it out with guided missiles - fired from the submarine itself.
