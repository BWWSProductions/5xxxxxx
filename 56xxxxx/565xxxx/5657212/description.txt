White Overalls are a new indie band hailing from the little town of Goole, East Riding of Yorkshire, England, and are a proponent of the 'New York-shire' sound.

This is their first recording, produced at the legendary White Rooms, home to bands such as One Night Only and Glamour Of The Kill, and has a raw, edgy sound that is sure to please any fans of bands such as the Arctic Monkeys and The Cribs.
