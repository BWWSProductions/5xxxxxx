      Dr. Rainville, an aging country             
        doctor with a deep attachment to his          
        patients, is about to retire and is           
        looking for a successor. Jeanne Dion,         
        an emergency room doctor from                 
        Montreal, agrees to go to Normetal to         
        replace him for a few weeks, with no          
        plans for an extended stay. When Dr.          
        Rainville suddenly dies, Jeanne must          
        decide if she'll take over the job,           
        and its inherent responsibilities,            
        for the long-term.
