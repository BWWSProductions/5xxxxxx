Torrent for that episode is here: http://tracker.minglong.org/torrents/%5BUTW%5D_Angel_Beats_-_05_%5Bh264_720p%5D%5B9CB4742F%5D.mkv.torrent"

,Fyrius,2011-02-11T20:21Z,"It seems the subtitles think it's more important to provide a roumaji transcription of the vocals to the ED background music than to actually translate the spoken dialogue. Whenever they coincide I can no longer follow what's being said. 
That's not very practical. "
