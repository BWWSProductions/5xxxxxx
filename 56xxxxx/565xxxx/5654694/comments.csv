,kodean6,2010-07-05T06:46Z,@marzjohn for the Prince of Persia title and a few others(newer titles) I have 5.50 Gen D4(Prometheus) and it I STILL got the error message. I downloaded the KHBBS patch and installed...now POP works just fine! I actually found the patch and decent instructions in another Prince of Persia torrent found here---> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5566433/%5BPSP%5DPrince_of_Persia__The_Forgotten_Sands%5BUSA%5D%5BFULL%5D%5BFIX%5D
,zachariclark,2010-11-13T01:29Z,Ok so I just went through all the trouble of installing cfw gen-d3 and then installed prometheus. So I have 5.50 prometheus. Is there any reason I shouldn't be able to play this game? BTW my PSP is 1001
,PC555paul,2010-12-29T14:53Z,I've got 5.50 prome-4 and it wont work
