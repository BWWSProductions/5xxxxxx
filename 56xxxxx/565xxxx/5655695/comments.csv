[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-29T05:38Z,Sorry this edition didn't come with any Spanish audio or subtitles. Just a reminder that I do not remove and languages audio or subtitle tracks. I try to ensure that they have spanish but with being in Canada it's not very common for all my movies to have Spanish but I try my hardest to find different copies.
