Just as the word processor makes it possible for anyone to create beautifully formatted written documentation, the visual processor makes it possible for anyone to create presentation-quality visuals just as easily.

Before the visual processor, visuals had to be created manually with complex graphics software. Even for experts, producing a visual like a flowchart was time consuming and the results were often not presentation-quality.
SmartDraw is the world's first visual processor

SmartDraw automates the creation of visuals to such a degree that anyone can do it, and get great results in minutes.
