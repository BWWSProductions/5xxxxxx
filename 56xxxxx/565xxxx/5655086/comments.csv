Well how is it that this crack fix will fix the door problems but it did not help fix the floor problems is what i was wondering about.

I think i would rather keep the other crack and also keep this crack fix aswell just incase i might need them at acertain point in the game for the doors and floors. 

For a crack or crack fix could even be noticed to even correct the problems is to play the game from the beginning to the end to find out if there is problems like with the doors and floors seems to be the issue at this point and "

The crack fix by the (SKIDROW) group does work to fix the doors and graphic problems but as for the camera well it could of just stuck just for a little bit.

,Skittlor,2010-07-02T18:10Z,"I've got a question...

People say that even SKIDROW's crackfix repack has problems, can anyone confirm/deny that?

Please mention the difficulty you played at and if you started the game from the beginning after applying the crackfix repack."
,real4xor,2010-07-02T19:26Z,"@Skittlor  2010-07-02

Well, I can confirm this: the last crack indeed had a locked door. Somewhere after you obtain a magic sword.

This crack fixed that problem, however in this crack the power upgrades are bugged.

For example Flow upgrade is locked to me, although I have the required energy and health upgrades. 
The heavy kick upgrade however unlocks too soon, even before you have the req. energy upgrade. So when you upgrade energy to the same level later, the heavy kick becomes unlocked instead of active. meaning you lose it if you upgrade it too soon.

however, the forced camera bugged me more than a few upgrades. in that aspect this is one of the more annoying platformers I`ve played."

,gnish44,2010-07-04T13:22Z,"For anyone having the problem with upgrades not unlocking:

1) Get a hex editor like XVI32
2) Find your save file location
3) Make a backup of ""upgrades.ravcpa""
4) Open ""upgrades.ravcpa"" in the hex editor
5) Change any ""00"" values to ""01""

This will unlock any locked upgrade, so you can activate it in-game.  Resist the urge to activate upgrades out of their proper order, though, as that'll probably mess stuff up."
