"On Melancholy Hill" is the tenth track from the Gorillaz's third album Plastic Beach. The song is due to be the second single from the album, and was originally slated for release in late 2010. In a later interview with creators Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, it was announced that it would replace "Superfast Jellyfish" as the second single, with "Superfast Jellyfish" due for release later in 2010.
