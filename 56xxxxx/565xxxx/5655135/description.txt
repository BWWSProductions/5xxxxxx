"one hour before the trip", a project that features musicians, engineers and visual artists, tries to combine the "indy" - as in independence - mentality and musical approach with the technical self-sufficiency in terms of equipment, facilities and manpower, that members of the project consider a vital prerequisite for the term "independence" to have any essential meaning. In an effort to be consistent with that concept, â€™one hour before the tripâ€™ had built their own recording and rehearsal studio, following the "room in a room" trend in sound engineering, and have been trying to equip it adequately ever since. Furthermore, the band itself, took the initiative in trying to establish certain relationships with certain people - ranging from those with technical background and experience as engineers, to others with their own similar artistic visions and demands - and made an effort to invite and provocate them into playing an active role in the development of the project.
