,Doffen_Duck,2010-07-01T16:27Z,"Btw, It still doesn't work.."
,patrickthaman,2010-07-01T16:36Z,"hmm alright, so you just have to add a rsci drive or somewhat (I know how, but I don't know the exactly name) and than you can mount it? ? "
,RdJ1,2010-07-01T16:58Z,"@patrickthaman: you're using the wrong version of the game (the digital download version). Download THIS torrent.

,patrickthaman,2010-07-01T17:51Z,"How long did it you take to download this torrent? At me it's downloading around the 12 kb/s, not very fast... If it keeps downloading with this speed, i'll wait till a crack comes out."

,BibiSeal,2010-07-02T21:22Z,"@ All : This version work.
1- DL Maxono's version
2- DL DaemonTools Advanced on the official homepage (v. DAEMONToolsPro4360309-0160)
3- Install DTPro like this NFO (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5507668/Deamon_%28DAEMON%29_Tools_Pro_4.30.305_32_amp_64bit_Latest => for the Generic Trial Starter 1.01 OEM)
4- In DT : Tools >Preference > Emulation : Check RMPS, SafeDisc, SecuRom, LaserLock.
5- Mount pcm.mds and install it
6- Launch PCM with the shortcut as administrator

It work for me, on a windows 7 Pro.

Now i will test with the patch..."
