I RECOMMEND YOU GO DOWNLOAD THAT ONE INSTEAD. I'M ONLY KEEPING THIS ONE ALIVE SO AS NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY SCREW UP SOMEONE'S DOWNLOAD WHO ALREADY STARTED THIS ONE

This is The String Quartet Tribute to the Mars Volta: SQT ESP. Pretty self-explanatory, really. Vitamin's take on the debut album (De-loused in the Comatorium) from the Mars Volta; according to Amazon, it is also supposed to include string versions of the EP preceding it (Tremulant), but I have yet to find them. Once I do (or someone directs me to them) then I will update this torrent to include them if they do exist. 

In any case some nice listening when you need to take a break from the sonic adrenalin that is the Mars Volta :) Or even to put on something that even your mom will think is cool (which actually did happen to me).

MP3s

1. "Son et Lumiere
2. "Inertiatic ESP"   
3. "Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of)
4. "Tira Me a las Aranas"  
5. "Drunkship of Lanterns"   
6. "Eriatarka"  
7. "Cicatriz ESP"  
8. "This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed"   
9. "Televators"   
10. "Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt"   

And, as I always say, but especially for anything related to the greatest band in existence, support your musicians. TMV is definitely worth it. Buy their albums and definitely see their live shows, which are amazing (not to mention a much better way to support the artists directly as opposed to the record companies).
