,marmar16,2010-06-29T08:39Z,"Please seed. Seeds are good. Good things grow from seeds. Even goodER things grow from good seeds. Don't be a stinging seeder. Plant that seed with your finger! It's taking me ages to get this because only one person is seeding which makes the rest of you seedy slime. Not good. We need good seeds. Seeds! Put your seed all over that biaaaa!!!!!

GWARRRR!!!! SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!"

That said, anyone else who gets the whole thing, please seed with me, at the very least til you get a 1:1 ratio on this torrent. That's just good torretiquette..."

,MarsVoltaic,2010-12-22T18:50Z,"I actually FINALLY just found those missing Tremulant EP tracks last night. So I've created an updated torrent here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6059239
I'll continue to seed this one as well, as I don't want to screw things up for someone already downloading this one, but recommend that you go get the other one as it is complete. Enjoy!"
