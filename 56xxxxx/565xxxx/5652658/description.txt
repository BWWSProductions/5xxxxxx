                    Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May and  
                    The Stig return for a brand new series. Jeremy  
                    asks why there aren't more three-wheeled cars  
                    in the world. James attempts to drive a Toyota  
                    Hilux up an active volcano in Iceland; and The  
                    Stig rips up the track in the new Bentley  
                    Continental Supersports. Plus, Richard gives  
                    the old Chevrolet Lacetti a dignified send-off  
                    before he and Clarkson host a star-studded tea  
                    party to welcome in a shiny new Reasonably  
                    Priced Car.
