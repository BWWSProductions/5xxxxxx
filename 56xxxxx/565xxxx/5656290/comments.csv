,atsbishop,2011-04-25T22:19Z,"When I first downloaded this I thought it had a virus. You need to disable your AV, Down load, Install completely. After your last computer reboot, restart your AV. Scan your computer if you feel uncomfortable about this. I found no virus."
,atsbishop,2011-04-25T22:31Z,P.S.you might want to burn this to a disk and delete from hard drive before restarting your AV

But also there is a simple way to remove it:

1) Disable your antivirus program to download this torrent without any troubles.
2) After your download will be finished, DO NOT execute ""MigrateEasy7.0_d_en.exe"" file, or your mom will slap you up your ass.
3) Instead of this, just use your archive manager (I use 7-Zip, but maybe WinRAR and some other managers can unzip this file too) to unzip this file, and voilĂÂ , you can see two extracted files, ""MIGRAT~1.EXE"", about 14.5 Mb, and ""your_exe.exe"", 17 Kb exactly.
4) It's not so hard to understand which file is which, but virustotal.com always will be happy to help you, the big file has 1/41 detection ratio (http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=8466ea16117346bab1d83c1cf47cbf9ce9f7051d9cb4de7039901385284f8b08-1304057445), the only one is just an accidental activation, the small file has 39/41 ratio (http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=6078001bbe76fe6dbc1740172514a36654ec328a0710772b59c10904a5ce0483-1304057955), everything clear with this.
5) So delete the small file and rename the big file from DOS-style name to something more beautiful, like ""Migrate Easy v7.0.619 Professional.exe"".
6) Turn on your antivirus program.
7) That's all, mission accomplished, but optionaly you can lead the person, who added a malware to this program, in your house and make him to suck your balls."
