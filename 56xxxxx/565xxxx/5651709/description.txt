Support your musicians by buying their CDs and other merchandise (and in this case, supporting the record company, Fat Wreck Chords, is actually a good thing as theyâ€™re a pretty cool DIY-label). And while Guns â€˜Nâ€™ Wankers is no longer a group, you can still support Snuff, who play great shows.
