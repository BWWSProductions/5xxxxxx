Author and investigative journalist Jim Marrs talked about why he believes the International Elite are using economic collapse, man-made disease, and erosion of civil liberties to take down America. He referred to the US as a "zombie nation" because citizens and the country itself are trillions of dollars in debt. JFK ended up dead not longer after he issued $4.2 billion in currency that was printed by the Treasury instead of the Federal Reserve, which in reality is a group of 12 banks that charge interest, he noted. 

"They're setting us up for a really big fall-- because the United States has been a free nation and a republic," and the biggest stumbling block to their plan for a New World Order-- a global socialist state broken into three economic blocks (as George Orwell predicted in 1984), Marrs laid out. Rather than conservatives or liberals, Democrats or Republicans, he said the Global Elite is made up of various wealthy individuals-- many Cabinet members of the last four administrations have been members of the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations), he added. 

According to various plans, such as the Kissinger Report, the New World Order views overpopulation as a threat to security, and seeks to depopulate via "limited wars, diseases, and starvation," which we are seeing play out now, he commented. The mysterious deaths of microbiologists, as well as the suppression of work by people like Royal Rife demonstrate how their plan is proceeding through eliminating possible cures for diseases, he argued. Marrs also discussed how fear mongering and reduced privacy are serving to control and tyrannize the population. To counteract the NWO, citizens should vote out incumbents in November, as well as start book/study groups to raise questions and consciousness around these issues, he suggested. 

Gun Control Ruling
First hour guest, author and economist John R. Lott discussed the Supreme Court ruling striking down the Chicago handgun ban. Because it was a close vote (5-4), changes in the Court's membership could make a decision the other way in future cases, possibly allowing cities to ban guns or even remove them from people's homes, he cautioned. Lott was also critical of high registration fees for guns in some locales, which he said penalized the poor.
