Frontiers and Ghetto_ State Violence in Serbia and Israel, by James Ron (2003).

The author is an Israeli scholar who served  for 3 years as a conscript in an infantry unit in the Israeli army.

The book compares between the types of violence used by the nationalist regimes in Israel and Serbia in dealing with the minorities living in ghettos in their respective countries, or on the frontiers. 

An interesting book.
