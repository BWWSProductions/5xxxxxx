,luvingfreeedom,2010-06-30T03:20Z,YES - This is REAL. Just check out all of my other torrents for proof.
,luvingfreeedom,2010-06-30T05:10Z,And my personal review: Very disappointing album. Wouldn't even call a lot of it hip-hop. Hopefully the new Andre 3000 and Outkast albums will be NOTHING like this.
,Cisaroski,2010-06-30T09:14Z,"@luvingfreedom,
dont come to my torrents.. and comment a link to this torrent, if thats how you get attention on piratebay your a fucking loser, grow up."
,luvingfreeedom,2010-06-30T10:33Z,"To clarify -- Cisaroski created a torrent which had 400 leechers and zero seeders for an entire day. After uploading a higher quality version, as a courtesy to the 400 people Cisaroski left hanging, I let them know they can download it here :)"
,decepticonjon,2010-06-30T15:46Z,"that's okay, luvingfreedom stole this torrent from me off of demonoid.  oh, and how do i know it's mine?  i added the two andre 3000 songs (18, 19) that WILL NOT be on any release of this album ever.  they we're anonymously leaked and i added them to my rip.  even more evidence, neither track is 320 kbps and are the same versions you can find on filestube."
,Flazhp0intX,2010-06-30T16:36Z,"@ decepticonjon & Cisaroski

GUESS WHAT? WE DON'T CARE!!!!!!! :D

No leecher cares about if it's stolen or not, they want to have it. Luvingfreeedom said there were 0 seeders, so he re-uploaded it. I think it's a good choice of him. 

+1 for luving :)"
,luvingfreeedom,2010-06-30T18:54Z,"'Stole this off of me from demonoid' --- LOL! Upload here then, fool! These people are too funny... I only upload releases like this if I see one come up on demonoid or piratebay, and is still not on the other site....  I do the courtesy of uploading for those who would like to download SINCE IT IS NOT AVAILABLE. Is it rude of me to say ya'll are acting like a bunch of bitches? LOL"
,wormybutt,2010-07-01T04:34Z,This album is incredible. Hip-hop needs Big Boi right now.
,luvingfreeedom,2010-07-01T08:15Z,"Proper credit to the original uploader from demonoid has been given, as should have been done from the beginnings. My apologies."
[T],strangolof,2010-07-05T17:36Z,"What's with ""Ringtone"" being on here renamed to ""Theme Song"" btw? Same bitrate as the official tracks also... but alike Royal Flush and Lookin For Ya it's not on the CD (anymore)..."
,Luke_Banks,2010-07-07T11:10Z,Why is everyone so butthurt that he got this torrent from someone else? It happens all the time you dont fucking own the right to it just because you are the first to upload it on another site.
,music.incorporated,2010-07-26T18:15Z,thanx
,samolianpirate,2010-08-11T20:39Z,"@ fragviper42 & decepticonjon - lol i love the way you think you own this, just in case you forget you STOLE it off Big Boi and what ever fucking record company he is signed for!! ...but thanks anyway to who ever i should be thanking :P"
,Flazhp0intX,2010-09-28T10:46Z,"Hey luvingfreeedom. I wondered when u going to upload something new :O!! I love your uploads...


Let me know please!! :D:D:D"
,realrap,2010-10-03T07:23Z,"@Flazhp0intX - Hey, this is LUVINGFREEDOM. I made a new name. Check out the user REALRAP, only one upload so far, but that is because Piratebay is being gay and not tracking. Once it is working again, I have about 10 uploads or so ready to roll. And I will still upload some stuff on this one, but just RnB and Drake and stuff like that. The real hip-hop is going to drop under REALRAP"
,Flazhp0intX,2010-10-05T09:52Z,"Okay man, thanks for the info :D I will keep an eye on both of your accounts ;)! thanks again"
,casseopea2,2010-10-06T17:33Z,"Thank you, very much appreciated"
,tronnis,2010-10-12T01:25Z,please seed:) I love this album!
,referhead,2010-12-14T18:01Z,"@decepticonjon
 actually ""royal flush"" does appear on this album as a bonus track. and like stated before. we are ALL stealing. who the fuck cares. as long as there is a torrent thats seeded then mission accomplished. if he ""Stole"" it from you then why didnt YOU upload it. obviously ur a uploader(right) since this is your demonoid torrent..right? oh one more thing: if you would read the onfo (im assumig and hoping you know how to read) it clearly states:

""CREDIT FOR THIS UPLOAD GOES TO  

demonoid user id: fragviper42
piratebay user id: decepticonjon"""
,referhead,2010-12-14T18:04Z,"and im ""assuming"" that i know how to spell..lol"
,referhead,2010-12-14T18:08Z,excuse my absentmidness. jus realized credit was posted AFTER. but atleast he made it right by giving credit. i jus found this album deluxe edition in 320 with all bonus tracks. i will upload it shortly if anyone interested
,referhead,2010-12-14T22:25Z,"Deluxe edition:

,bud4hugs,2011-01-03T13:25Z,"@ fragviper42 & decepticonjon

Both of you are faggots for uploading something that is not yours, and for not reuploading when it was useless. With that said, you both are a bunch of whining pussies, and luvingfreeedom should whoop both you dumb shit.

Ohhh.. and thank ""LF"" you helped me download the album quickly with all the seeders that both those girls are lacking."
,emrosinternet,2011-01-30T23:50Z,@ 320Kbps HELL YEAH 
,KeeSusie,2011-02-26T02:43Z,"Thanks to all of you who put the effort into making this available for free to the public!  Good quality download. I also enjoyed reading all the comments, like Jersey Shore, they're like a train wreck that I couldn't stop reading.  Thanks also for introducing me to demonoid.  I've been solely using the Pirate Bay so thanks for the new resource.  I'm not one of the cool kids so I don't have a reg. code so I can't register but will make use of this new discovery.

On a side note, there's a real, organized political party called ""The Pirate Party"" that you guys will like. NVM, you're probably registered members. It's been in Sweden/Europe for a while but it just officially registered in my U.S. state recently."
,taron32,2011-04-09T23:16Z,"arguing about stolen torrents...

DOES ANYONE SEE THE IRONY? o_O"
,strathmeyer,2011-04-13T22:30Z,"+1, would steal this torrent again"
