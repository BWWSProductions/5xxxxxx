Supercell is a Japanese 11-member music group led by composer  and lyricist  Ryo which formed in 2007 as a dÅjin music group. Supercell started out by making use of the Hatsune Miku singing synthesizer to produce vocals for songs submitted to the Nico Nico Douga video sharing website. The popularity of the songs led the group to release the independent self-titled album Supercell at Comiket 74  in August 2008. Supercell made their major debut with Sony Music Entertainment Japan  with the professional release of their Supercell album in March 2009, which was updated with more songs and a DVD. Supercell released their first single, "Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari", in August 2009 with vocals by Nagi, herself a vocalist primarily known for her uploads to Nico Nico Douga under the name Gazelle.[1]  "Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari" was the first release by Supercell not to use Hatsune Miku for the vocals and was used as the ending theme song for the 2009 Bakemonogatari anime series. A second single, "Sayonara Memories", was released in February 2010.
