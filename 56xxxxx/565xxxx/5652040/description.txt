Enemy Nations
Meet interesting people on the Internet, then build big tanks and show the bastards who's boss

The Battle for the Last Planet
Now that you've landed on the last planet, all you have to do is feed your people, power your city, fuel your economy, deploy your army and destroy Enemy Nations ... before they destroy you.


Enemy Nations is a really old real time strategy game. It's kind of like SimCity meets RedAlert.
