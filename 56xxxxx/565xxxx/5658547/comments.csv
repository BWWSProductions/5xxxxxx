It seems to be the same usual great A/V quality you can expect from Secretmyth (Kingdom release) .
Comes with English, French, Dutch and Romanian subtitles. Another great Kingdom release !
DL the sample first to preview.
And thanks to the seeders."

But other than this. SecretyMyth's release is awesome and the best among any others as usual.
I highy recommend the download (and the movie) despite these few flaws I mentioned. 
:)
Thanks for this release! :D"
