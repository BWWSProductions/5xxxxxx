CHAPELLIER Fred and his blues band roam clubs, festivals and national scenes over the past ten years, in fact they shared the bill with such blues greats: Popa chubby (repeatedly), Mick Taylor, Lucky Peterson to name a few as the list is long.
The big news for this album is to not sing in French because Fred is firmly convinced that the more the listener will hear this music sung in Frenchy, the more he will taste (everything is conditioning!) With respect to the scene, they like to revisit their own way hymns Freddy King or Elmore James among others by including their personal set.
Fred has often been invited on stage by masters of the genre like Bryan Lee, Byth Smith, Nine below zero again to name a few.

With this new album, Fred looks forward to demonstrate that the blues ""French"" can rival that of our fellow Americans or English without any hesitation! and after all, writing in French is quite normal when it is called Fred Chapellier!
The Blues Band consists of: Pat Machenaud on drums, the bass Abder Benachour Johan Dalgaard and (or Damien Cornelis) on keyboards. Miguel M close friend sings and plays a few notes on ""Devil Blues"""
