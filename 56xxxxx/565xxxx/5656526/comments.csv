[T],BluemanWarrior,2010-07-01T02:18Z,"Did I ever said anything about hardsubs?
It's softsubs! Everybody uses softsubs. If you don't know what that means or how to visualize it, you should stop commenting and do some research. There is something called GOOGLE. USE IT"
,ticalx3,2010-07-01T20:58Z,"Thanks for the upload BluemanWarrior the quality is amazing 10/10, audio is excellent also. What group subbed this it doesnt say any where other than it was u/l to demonoid. There are soft coded subs embedded in the file, and its usually like that with most animu. 
Also to blurman2000, I suggest you download a free movie player that plays the softsubs called media player classic google or startpage it. "
