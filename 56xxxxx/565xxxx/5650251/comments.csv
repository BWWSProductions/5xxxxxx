,Arachne,2011-10-20T13:25Z,"The quality of the movie is great, however, the subtitles in English through the movie is quite annoying.  Although I am seeing this copy, I will be deleting it from my file as the subtitles take away of it.  The subs should have only been used where the text was in Spanish.  More than that was overkill.  Thanks anyway.  A limited SRT (subtitle) file would have done well enough in short form."
