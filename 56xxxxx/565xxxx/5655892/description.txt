This album is a great overview of the band's early stuff.  Though it encompasses 23 amazing, tuneful, punk/hardcore smashers, off the top of the head, one could check off dozens of others that deserved inclusion. What's here is as breathtaking as punk has gotten after 1985, thanks to Greg Graffin's insistence on clearly enunciated pop vocals, complete with soaring harmonies, and considering these as important as playing hard, fast, and mean (not to mention the lyrics that betray the sizable brains of the two writers, Graffin and guitarist Brett Gurewitz). The net result is that All Ages is more or less Bad Religion from Suffer through Generator.
