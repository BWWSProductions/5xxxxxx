,5iTH,2010-07-01T14:54Z,"Torrent is safe enough - there are a few files i won't be touching contained in the dowload but so far nothing has flagged suspicions.

Only problem (for me) is that game crashes on various levels including earth training grounds and earth village 2. I haven't been able to progress further than earth village 1 as a result of this. Shame."
