Plot Summary:

The film is set in a small Sweden town and revolves around a group of "popular" high schoolers made of two sisters, the guys who like them and various hang-arounds. These are the kind of dumb jerks that can be found in any school, superficial dimwits who think they're all that even though they're as conflicted as any other teenager, but who feel the need to mock and ridicule others to make themselves feel better. One of their favorite targets is Agnes (cute brunette Rebecka Jiljeberg) who, rumour has it, might be a dyke. Well, she is actually, but it ain't easy. She already has no real friends, she already feels like she's a disappointment to her over-demanding mother, and now she has to deal with these feelings she can't even talk about to anybody. Even worse, the girl she's in love with, Elin (sexy blonde Alexandra DahlstrÃ¶m), is one of the sisters at the core of the in-crowd. Through a cruel prank, the two will share a first kiss, which will be followed by much questioning, self-deceiving and despair... And love.
