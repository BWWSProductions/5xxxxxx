If you're looking for a better picture quality version, this is not it. This doesn't really look any better than the 700 MB avi versions.

Anyways,  I uploaded this for the people who want the commentary track in Swedish or a DVD version subtitled in English."
,DinoBosnia,2011-07-11T17:56Z,Are the subtitles on the film or are they separate?  
[V],Iznogoud9,2011-07-27T06:55Z,"You probably know this by now already, but anyways... the subtitles are normal DVD subtitles, i.e. they can be turned on/off."
