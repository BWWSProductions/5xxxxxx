Wavin' Flag" is a song by Somali-Canadian artist K'naan from his album Troubadour, written for Joe Lolli, reaching #2 on the Canadian Hot 100. A remake by a supergroup of Canadian artists, credited as Young Artists for Haiti, became a charity single, with this new version going straight to #1 on the Canadian charts. A version of the song featuring will.i.am  and David Guetta is targeted for international release. The song also appears on the soundtrack for the video games NBA 2K10  and 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa.
