,Ironarrow99,2011-01-10T02:57Z,"To those who think it's fake. How are you say it's fake?  Maybe it just doesn't show up on your Gen. 
I'm going to DL this, Using Gen-D3. 
Be back with report."
,Ironarrow99,2011-01-10T05:45Z,"So, The Torrent works just fine. Although I was unable to play it on my Slim Gen-D3, I think it's not for the same CTF as mine. 

Miabambina12, What Firmware did you test this on.

To everyone that said it's fake. Your just not able to use it. The torrent is fine. And not a fake."
