Jay-Z - The REAL Greatest Hits 2-Disc (2010)


This Greatest Hits compilation was created by: The Professor


The only 2 CD's you need to bump from Jay.

Jay is definitely one of the best hip-hop artists of all-time. But there are a lot of haters. And I find, that most of the time, they haven't really HEARD Jay. Listen to the first four songs on CD 1 and tell me that is some dope shit.

This is NOT a collection of biggest mainstream hits. This is his BEST shit, which does include some of his mainstreams cuts. But unless you are already a big Jay fan I doubt you will have heard all of the songs here.
