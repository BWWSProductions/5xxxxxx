Drew Hastings a very underrated comic and this is one of his better performances. 

I've put up the full DVD of this before but decided to rip this from the dvd and put it here because it is most known for being aired on Comedy Central. 


He really is a very good comic and worth a look. 


If  you download and enjoy the show please leave a comment for others to see that he's worth a look.

Thank You.
