Conor Oberst (Discography)


This torrent consists mainly of his Bright Eyes project. I've cleaned several organizational aspects of each individual album.
I'm missing a petite handful of rare tracks i.e. his rapping (:-D) and some other less-known songs he's produced or contributed towards, sorry.
