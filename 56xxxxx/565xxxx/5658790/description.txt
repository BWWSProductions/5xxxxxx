Sherbet (a.k.a. The Sherbs and Highway) was one of the most prominent and successful Australian rock bands of the 1970s. Their biggest singles were "Summer Love" (1975) and "Howzat" (1976), both reaching number one in Australia. "Howzat" was also a top 5 hit in the UK. Though the band's success in the U.S. was more limited, "Howzat" was a #61 hit in America, and under the name The Sherbs they also hit #61 in 1981 with the single "I Have The Skill". Throughout the 1970s, the group was managed by Roger Davies.
