AdobeÂ® ContributeÂ® CS5 software is a powerful web publishing and website management tool that integrates authoring, reviewing, and publishing in an 

easy-to-use WYSIWYG HTML editor. 

Increase web publishing productivity collaboratively while simplifying oversight and approval tasks.


Contribute features

AdobeÂ® ContributeÂ® CS5 immediately updates edits to XML content and Spry widgets.

Predefined content types new

Define content types that specify the design template and review process that will be used automatically when a new page is created. 

Content type can be HTML or XML.
