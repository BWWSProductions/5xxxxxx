Recently, more and more bush parties are held on the outback Australia. The style of bush party is a little similar with Woodstock Festival back in the 70s and 80s: pack your own tent and sleeping bag, 2-3 hours driving from the urban area, light up the camp fire, join the big party, here you go and dance! 

Welcome to Wonderland is a documentary film, interviewing with different characters including the organisers, the DJs and the comers, applying their point of views to explore everything about bush parties. Are they exploring? Or filming their bush parties records over these 6 years, and using this opportunity to show people, that dance party is not a fixed formula of just drink and dance in the club or disco, thus to look for an alternative experience in the "Wonderland". 

Music is definitely an important part of this film; DJs produce music just for the bush parties. It is unique, and it brings you a new point of view of dance music. Bush party is absolutely more than a dance party, to find out more, this documentary is a guide to start with, or just a pleasure of vision for watching the dance montages.
