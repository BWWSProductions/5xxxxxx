At 71 years old Judy Collins still has a voice with the richness of well-oiled cherrywood. Paradise is another subtly political collection of covers from this enduring folk supremo, who has made a career out of illuminating interpretations of other musiciansâ€™ material.

The duskier tones of Joan Baez join Collins on Diamonds And Rust; thereâ€™s a particularly eloquent version of Tim Buckleyâ€™s protest lament Once I Was; and Collins is utterly haunting on Dens Of Yarrow.

The quiet piano-and-guitar arrangements are tasteful rather than startling but Collinsâ€™s voice doesnâ€™t need much adornment and, aside from a slightly saccharine cover of Somewhere Over The Rainbow, this is a blissful and beautiful record.
