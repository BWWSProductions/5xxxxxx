[T],ctang,2010-06-28T18:10Z,MM: this isnt a big deal or nothing but if you put another space bc the url for seedkey it will show up as a clickable url...just makes it easier for me to go to his site if im on your site :)
[T],ctang,2010-06-28T22:55Z,"@MM: whats up fella...havent talked to ya in a week or so...i was checking out some of the comments on the last few of your torrents and someone requested ""School for Scoundrels""...i got it and will upload it unless its on the top of your list"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-29T01:49Z,Hey Ctang - Sorry I have been away bro:P Yeah I totally didn't realize Seed's link wasn't clickable. I'll have to fix that. Also yeah I have school for scoundrals so I can upload it np. How've you been keeping?
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-29T01:53Z,Just a reminder to everyone. I can do everyone's upload however I need some time to upload them as I am a very busy guy but don't think I have not rec'd your request if I do not respond. I write every and all requests down. I will eventually get to it. Please be patient and thank you for choosing my torrents:) 
[T],ctang,2010-06-29T13:32Z,since you did the die hard movies i will do school for scoundrels later today!!! :)
,mukaas,2011-10-30T17:07Z,"i just started d/l'ing ntsc, untouched torrents and i LOVE them. i did not know that you guys (ctang, mikemelo1369 & djfred) work together, lol.does johnasabo & clwilson1977 collaborate with you as well? anyways, i have left this message/request for your fellow uploaders but i figure that i will just cover cover all the bases so to speak. when you have time, would you pls up the change up (unrated), the jacket, brooklyn's finest, crossing over, the machinist, tropic thunder (unrated), revolver, lucky number slevin and fight club? with untouched menu and extras. i apologize for such a big request but i cannot find those movies with menu and extras on any torrent sites. i realize that you cannot fulfill the whole request all at once but if you could do 1 or so every now and then it would be greatly appreciated.  thx again for your hard work. regards.
