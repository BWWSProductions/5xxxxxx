,hunter100000,2010-12-20T07:44Z,how can the file size be so small? is the quality good??
,tejabhai,2010-12-20T09:26Z,"the quality is good, but this is NOT THE COMPLETE FILM. The film is supposed to be 198 minutes or so, this file is only 50 minutes. The full film contains 19 scenes, but this file only has the last 5 scenes (as listed on IAFD), so it seems that this is only the last quarter of the full film.

One would expect a 'VIP' uploader to at least list the specs on their uploads, so that nobody is misled."
