if life was full of misery
and lonely children sing
your breath would smell of burnt almonds
and cyanide would be king

if cyanide was king my love
i'd take you as my queen
and take you to a wondrous land 
where love hath never been

where love hath never been my love
and we would know such bliss
i'd take you in my arms my love
and kill you with a kiss
