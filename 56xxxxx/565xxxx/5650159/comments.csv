Not a fake at all
I think all you need to do is run it through VLC and you'll have no problems at all.
Also I will seed when I get back from my holiday so that everyone can see this."

,6810,2010-11-14T02:19Z,"Are you people squealing ""fake!"" and ""I can't open it"" basically retarded or what? This is just the VIDEO TS folder from the DVD... These files can be viewed in virtually any player and converted to a single file at your leisure at a bit rate of your choosing. 

This torrent is fine. "

,New00Folder,2011-01-21T19:06Z,Doesn't seem to me the contents of a real DVD coz the video quality is poor at times and audio goes out of sync somewhere in the middle. But it serves it's purpose.
,NewWorldOrphan9,2011-01-27T23:48Z,"No seeders? seems to me there is none.

,NewWorldOrphan9,2011-01-28T20:16Z,"I got it, it finishhed last night while i was sleeping. Out of sync here and there, im not bitching, VLC will fix.
