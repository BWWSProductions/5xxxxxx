,highlander777,2010-06-28T11:18Z,Has anyone else noticed the senile grandfather who loves the macaroni and CHEESE is the same actor who is the mysterious CHEESE guy in Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV show? There's got to be an inside joke there!

I didn't understand the original reference to cheese in Buffy. Do you know anything about it?"
