A great addition for any Keane fan; Generally flawless performances, all stripped to vocals, piano, percussion(mostly tambourine), and vocals. the opening track 'Perfect Symmetry' is pretty amazing, and Tom sounds both refreshed and enthused; very energetic, SHORT set(under 15 minutes.....). You really get a chance to hear some nice touches you can't hear on the album, esp. harmony-wise. A very pleasant surprise. Well produced too.
