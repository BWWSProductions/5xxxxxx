Downloaders sensitive to racist terminology should be aware, as per description, this comes from a very different time in the UK when the race riots were still quite fresh in peoples memories and although Africans/Afro-Caribbean and indian peoples were being better accepted into white communities of 70's Britain, it portrays the realities of the time, among that is casual racial slurs some may find enraging or upsetting.

So if easily offended by racism, please be aware.

This is banned from UK TV for that reason, if bleeped out, a good third of the dialogue would be missing, sort of thing.

I cannot stand racism myself, we are all Human as far as i'm concerned, am downloading this because this period was my chiildhood and i know i will be pretty fracked off with some of the dialogue but has histrocal sociodynamic interest and will prompt memories from the period."
