From IMDB:
Reb Brown stars as Captain America and fights for truth, justice and the American way. An sinister terrorist, Miguel, played by Christopher Lee is trying to blackmail the United States. Unless his demands are meant; he plays on unleashing a dangerous toxin that causing rapid aging on it's unsuspecting victims. This portrayal of the "star spangled avenger" is definitely not the comic book version; but, Reb Brown sincerity and honesty make it work.
