,QuestionEverything,2010-06-30T16:43Z,"Must see film for everyone! I moved from the city to the mountains to get away from pollution and a few months later there are natural gas wells popping up everywhere( at least a dozen in a mile radius) . I have been waiting for weeks to download this so I can burn it and pass it to all the brain-dead yokels who just love their gas money.

GREAT UPLOAD"
,Xunnamius,2010-06-30T19:50Z,"Great movie. Very eye opening.

@bardicl Yes, and for anyone who wants an opposing opinion on the BP oil disaster, why not take a look at ""PLANET BP."" I'm sure they offer as comprehensive and unbiased a report as ""jlcny.org"" Here, I'll give you their URL too.

For anyone wanting an opposing opinion (to the BP oil spill):

Pretty serious business. Personally, I would never trust a Murdoch rag like the blatantly biased WSJ to protect my interests when it comes to, well, anything."
,jzenman,2010-09-21T03:40Z,"Great film. You have to see this. 

A/10 V/10 M/10

and hey bardicl go pedal your snake oil somewhere else. The documentary is pretty clear. No one needs to have fire coming out of their tap water. The oil and gas companies pretty much control all opposing opinions anyway. So fuck off. If you think it's so safe why don't YOU go live down wind from a natural gas drill operation. "
,wvcynic,2010-11-05T04:41Z,"My brother in law cannot drink their well (ground) water after a gas company came in the area about 1 mile from him and fracked a well.  It ruined the well/ground water for about 3 miles in each direction. It is real and Bardicl, you can spew your opposing view all you want because this is real and I have seen it first hand.  Thanks for the torrent/download.  People need to know about this and thanks to Bush/Cheney, these companies cannot be held liable for ruining the ground water in areas where people rely on their wells for drinking water.  "

I'm from brazil and I speak portuguese, but I don't understand english pronunciation very well.
The movie with subs to read is more easy to understand...
thanks!!!
P.S. Sorry for possible erros in my comment."
,gasland,2010-12-29T04:34Z,"I was the editor of the film -- I appreciate the comments and the criticism of the movie, but I assure you that everything that we researched and imparted into the film is true and factual.

Please buy the DVD if you are impacted by the movie because we are dedicated to the cause and the families that this epidemic affects.

And most of all, we are moving towards a constructive solution.

Become a part of the 21st century energy solution.  Let's shake things up and get things moving."
,C0rn3bus,2011-01-08T07:32Z,"Even here in Canada, where we have plenty of hydroelectricity, and no need for other sources of energy, these friggin companies come and ""frackle"" ""harmlessly"" and pollute what's left of our drinkable water... And the government does nothing against it, even when faced with strong opposition. 

@Gasland I fully support the movie, I have bought it for myself and my friends (as a gift). This is for converting for my iPod, as it puts less strain on my computer than ripping and converting the dvd altogether"
,kiwi33,2011-01-16T00:51Z,"Thanks eztv for this upload.
Thanks ""gasland"" for editing it and chipping into the conversation. I will be directing many people to purchase your DVD.

Thanks bardicl for sharing that link. I appreciate having the opportunity to look into some of the other sides to this issue and the stories people have around it. Gasland has presented one perspective, and a very important one I think. It has given a voice to many who were previously silent.    "

,redactedwv,2011-03-02T03:54Z,"Thx eztv! much appreciated - will seed.

Thx also to the film's editor for posting. Very nice to see someone that understands and appreciates the torrent world. I'll definitely pick up a copy of the doc next payday, as i (almost) always do with documentaries. In a world of yellow corporate ""journalism"", independent documentary film makers are among the few sources of reliable, trustworthy information. 

Oh, and to all the shills posting bullshit ""opposing opinion"" links....Are you frakkin' kidding? Another perspective? You mean the perspective of the people who do their best to screw all environmental regulations? Of those who work tirelessly to destroy unions? Those who write the legislation for dempublican politicians that gives them carte blanche to exploit/destroy OUR environment? Those who do it for the personal enrichment of a handful of grubby, soulless shareholders? The ones who own (and ruthlessly control the editorial perspective of) every other form of mass media? The perspective that's shoved down our global throat 24/7 from birth to grave?? THAT'S the perspective we're missing??? 

No thanks, jackasses.....I think i'll put my trust in information that doesn't come directly from people who profit from our continuing/expanding reliance on fossil fuels.

 ""opposing opinions"" ...lol. 'Golly, those corporate shills sound so reasonable and polite....I think I'll go read their propaganda bullshit...'

""opposing opinions""... Unbelievable. Up yer arses, ya pitiful serfs."
,zonzai,2011-03-04T20:24Z,"Great to see this film finally get the coverage it deserves!  

@bardicl: The JCLNY is a co-op of wealthy people with a vested interest in the success of the oil and natural gas industry.  Despite their claims of being unbiased, their researchers are paid by these oil and gas companies to disseminate the information that they want people to know and withhold the scientific data that goes against their claims.

This is smear journalism 101, withhold the truth and do anything you can to make those who disagree with you look bad."
,redactedwv,2011-03-06T03:20Z,"^ Right on, zonzai. Well said.

Anyone that is inclined to lend credence to all these oh-so-innocently posted 'alternate opinion' pieces, be sure and do a modicum of research about the information and it's source. Check 'About Us' links....Google any 'council' or 'alliance' or think tank (etc). 

Track down the funding source for all involved. One of their favorite tactics is information scrubbing... A dynamic that involves having a proxy post/publish bogus, misleading, or incomplete information - then have it be used as a source for a slightly more credible (and less obviously purchased) outlet. That outlet is then quoted or used as a source for an outlet which is a bit MORE credible. Pretty soon, the ""facts"" you've paid to have released appear in enough places that it lends the information the air of credibility:

'Well, i don't know much about the science, but i know i've seen this statistic in multiple places....If it was wrong, someone would have said something by now'. 

Etc etc. It's surprisingly effective. When you have a compliant corporate media whose fiscal interests intersect with your own, it's frighteningly easy. For specifics, do a bit of research on the Koch brothers and the money they've poured (and continue to pour) into casting doubt on the scientific consensus regarding climate change. Good, decent people are deceived into supporting positions that are not in their interests. They think they've come to a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence at hand, when in reality they been played for suckers by rich bastards making money off the ignorance and trusting nature of innocent people.

We are living in the second gilded age. Inform yourselves: Don't be the robber baron's sucker."
,charlie1der,2011-04-03T12:34Z,"I checked out the ""opposing opinion"" link someone added below and other opposition pieces and they read like the ""debunking"" of one of Michael MooreÂ´s movies.    They look for little inconsistencies to try to undermine the argument and label the film as ""alarmist"".      Those making money off this practice should have to live where itÂ´s going on.    But we know thatÂ´s never gonna happen.    The common people lose again."

Pretty sick attitude for just a few $.

,AJNorth,2011-05-27T01:07Z,"As Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote in his ""The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner"" (1798), 

""Water, water, everywhere, 
Nor any drop to drink.""

It should come as a surprise to no one that it all boils-down to that five-letter word, M O N E Y - and the concomitant power that derives therefrom; but at what cost?

For when ground water, much less an aquifer, is contaminated, the remediation (that is, the essentially permanent filtering that will will then be required - at best) will cost substantially more than whatever few pieces of gold were paid for the drilling and recovery rights to the land owners.

Fear, obstinance, ignorance and greed form an all too common confluence, often exploited by the wealthy and powerful. It is not in the interest of the extractive energy sector (whether carbon-based or nuclear fission) to advocate the clean, safe, reliable, environmentally-friendly, limitless and ultimately economical energy available from such 'renewable' sources as the Sun, wind and geothermal (to name but three) - economical, because the source cost for this energy is identically zero; it need only be harnessed.

So, while we remain wedded to energy technologies of the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries (as exemplified by the mantra ""Drill, baby, drill"" - and, even in the shadows of Chernobyl and Fukushima, a push for more nuclear-fission generation), much of the rest of the world is moving ahead with the sustainable energy technologies of the twenty-first century - and well beyond.


Put in terms of absolute morality (which the overwhelming majority of those who invoke it as an issue have none of in their character), it was not long after the close of the second world war that a group gathered in the upper Mojave Desert to consider issues confronting the world. Among others in attendance were Bertrand Russell and Edmond Jaeger, the dean of American desert naturalists.

Around the campfire one evening the topic under consideration was Right and Wrong. After listening to his distinguished associates for a time, Jaeger turned to Russel, his white wispy hair outlined by the fire and the smoke from his pipe, and said, ""The environment, since it cannot run away nor defend itself, must be protected. And THAT, sir, is the difference between what is Right and what is Wrong."" A Sierra Club Tee-shirt expressed it in a slightly different way: under a photograph of the Earth as seen from space were the words, ""THERE IS NO PLACE ELSE TO GO.""

Yesterday, in testimony before the Congress of the United States, Lisa Jackson, Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said that she was ""not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself"" had affected water.  This is an outrage of such staggering proportion that Jackson should be made to resign immediately - or be dismissed. Sadly, as a spokesperson for the Obama Administration, her remarks serve as but another example of what America actually elected in 2008 as ""the change we can believe in.""  The great tragedy is that GOP - ""Tea"" Party cartel make Obama seem like Theodore Roosevelt in comparison."
[T],artpepper,2011-06-01T02:06Z,"Well said, @AJNorth...

Here in the UK, Blackpool has just had two earthquakes in  quick succession, the epicentres of both were a fracking operation on the coast. Our scumbag politicians are bought and paid for:

""A report last month by the Energy and Climate Change Committee of the House of Commons found that there was no evidence that the technique of fracking was unsafe. The committee's chairman, Tim Yeo, dismissed fears as ""hot air"", insisting there was no danger to underground drinking supplies...""

Politicians should be shot on sight: it's a matter of self-preservation."
,djmopa,2011-06-01T23:24Z,"PERFECT QUALITY, SOUND AND VIDEO.

IF YOU ARE AN AMERICAN, YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE.

If our crooked son of a bitch businessman and business women and Politicians keep up with this shit, there won't be any place to live. This goes well beyond the drinking water, it is the art, the food we eat, everything. Something must be seriously done, or else there won't be any place for any of us to live in the next 100 years. We will have completely killed ourselves, with only our selves to blame."
