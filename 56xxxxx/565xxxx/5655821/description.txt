ALMS American Le Mans Series race #6 held at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey California on 22-May-2010.

This video was recorded in HiDef video at 1920 x 1080 resolution from the CBS SportsWorld broadcast one week following the actual race. The actual race is 6 hours in duration.

It has been edited to remove all commercials and station breaks, and non-race specific material. It was then encoded into MPEG-4 H.264/AVS at 9000kb/s video and 256kb/s audio. I tried to maintain the maximum quality while producing a file that can just barely fit on a DVD5 for archive purposes.

If you like the video then please leave a comment.

Enjoy!
