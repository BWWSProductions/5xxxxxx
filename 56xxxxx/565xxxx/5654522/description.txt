This film is probably the best showcase of the comedic capacities of acting genius Anna Magnani. Here she's paired up with Italian actor Toto', who's considered the most representative Italian comedian of all times. The chemistry between the two is the source of a splendid chain of events that allow the two actors to explore a multitude of highs and lows...almost like in a carnival. Monicelli's intricate story line is a rarity in the world of comedies. Intelligent, entertaining and hilarious, the film contains the only example (on camera) of what Anna Magnani and Toto' would do in Rome during the 1930's: "Avanspettacolo". The two sing on a small stage at one of Rome's fashionable parties: all done with immense presence and class; the result is a magnificent theatrical moment between improvisation and highly refined performing skills. Definitely a must for those who love quality comedies.
