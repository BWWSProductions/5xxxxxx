" Elegance and sensuality mingle in the music of smoky-voiced chanteuse Chantal Chamberland. Smooth as a dry martini and equally intoxicating, Chamberland's third album DRIPING INDIGO cements her role as one of the best interpreters of classic songbook favorites. Two factors set Chamberland's music apart from the pack. First, the arrangements are slow and sexy relying on a small jazz ensemble for backing (piano, sax, bass, light rhythm). Secondly is her luscious voice, which caresses the listener with a breathy purr throughout the album. With a repertoire that features "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes," Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered" and " How Deep Is Your Love," the album slowly seduces with its corner jazz club ambience and torch singer grace.
