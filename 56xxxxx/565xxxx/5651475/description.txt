This is an unofficial torrent with all full and crop pictures taken from MWSHQ-Team and MtgBr.com.

It includes all the pics of huggybabys 2 torrents and all updates till "Rize of the Eldrazi" I could find including "tokens" and "tips & tricks" from newer generations.

It also includes "Archenemy" and "Duel of the Plainswalkers"

Please share this torrent for as long as possible and feel free to post it on forums or blogs about MWS. I will seed it full speed with my root as long as possible and create updates for upcoming editions as soon they're out.
