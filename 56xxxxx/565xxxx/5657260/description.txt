In this bizarre adventure game, You play an aggressive sausage that is in search for the light-bulb major who used to clone him. There are shoot 'em up intermissions, so this title is for both adventure and fps fans. Or none, because this game is really awkward. I recommend it for anyone who likes absurd humor and a great challenge, for the game is very hard.

This is a rare title, I never did any extensive search, but with some fast browsing I wasn't able to find a copy on the Net. I have mine thanks to owning a physical copy.
I needed some time to make it work on XP and here it is.
If You just want to play the game and don't need the image file, skip it (download only "Animal.zip", instructions are within). I included it in case if anyone would like to have it for whatever reason.
