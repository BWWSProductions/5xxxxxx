XP 17 is a reliable name and I have downloaded XP17 releases and found no problem whatsoever infact XP17 rips owns all the other rips when it comes to quality. With its amazing quality retention technology which not too many uploaders put into practice

And a tip to all you kids to find out fake video files.
The files will be zipped into a rar file so that you can't see the contents in it unless you finish your download and the uploader can add whatever he wants in it. Here in this torrent package I can see a video file and its corresponding subtitle and an NFO file which I don't think a fake uploader will upload as such so I can firmly say that its not a fake upload.
Thank you."

,renegade431,2011-12-29T17:54Z,"I could not believe the amazing quality this video has. The quality is so good, the video is actually crisp. I'm writing this, because none of my other torrents come close to this quality. Thanks for the awesome download."

We have no HD source for Part 3 yet. When Part 3 is released on Blu-ray, we shall put it up.

@renegade431
Glad you like the rip. People say awesome quality is impossible at 700MB and that it's necessary to wait days to get a good quality download. We continue to shit on that myth with our work. ;)"
