       "The largest domestic natural gas drilling boom in history has    
       swept across the United States. The Halliburton-developed         
        drilling technology of "fracking" or hydraulic fracturing has
        unlocked a "Saudia Arabia of natural gas" just beneath us. But
        is fracking safe? When filmmaker Josh Fox is asked to lease his
        land for drilling, he embarks on a cross-country odyssey
        uncovering a trail of secrets, lies and contamination. A
        recently drilled nearby Pennsylvania town reports that residents
        are able to light their drinking water on fire. This is just one
        of the many absurd and astonishing revelations of a new country
        called GASLAND. Part verite travelogue, part expose, part
        mystery, part bluegrass banjo meltdown, part showdown."
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
