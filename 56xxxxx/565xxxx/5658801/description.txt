Spotify is a proprietary peer-to-peer music streaming service with desktop applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X; the Windows version can also be used under Linux and FreeBSD with Wine.
Developed by Swedish startup "Spotify AB", the software allows unlimited streaming of selected music from a multitude of major and independent record labels including Sony, EMI, Warner Music Group and Universal with virtually no buffering delay.[1][2] Music can also be imported from either iTunes[3] or directly from local files.[4]
An ad-supported version of the software is free to download in Sweden, Spain, Norway, Finland, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.[5][6]. For a monthly fee, users can upgrade to a "Premium" account, which offers higher bitrate streams, offline access to music and use of Spotify on mobile devices running iOS, Android or Symbian.[7] Currently only consumers with a Paypal account or a credit card issued in one of the launch countries can activate a Premium account. A "Day Pass" was available, which gave unlimited advert-free listening for 24 hours; this option was removed when Spotify "Unlimited" was introduced in May 2010.
Music can be browsed by artist, album, record label or playlist as well as by direct searches, and a link allows the listener to purchase selected material via partner retailers.[8] Launched in October 2008, Spotify has approximately seven million users as of May 19th, 2010; about 250,000 of these are paying members.[9]
