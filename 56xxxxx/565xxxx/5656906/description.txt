Here is the file that you are able to download from the link of http://trueblackberrygps.info/ which is in this torrent. (I hate surveys, and I can't stand that someone is making money from the surveys when he's sending out stolen software)So, I installed that web-feti shit on a VM and reverted to snapshot, and provided this app for yall.

I know my intentions are not honourable, at the end of the day though, I'm on this site, so what you expect?


Oh yeah, and there aren't any UK / Europe roads on this, though USA appear to be fine.
