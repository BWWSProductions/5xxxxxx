,momocow24,2010-06-28T19:46Z,dude i fuckin love you thankyou so much for putting this shit on. I am counting on you to get more episodes in the future thanyou so much.
,Awesomo42,2010-06-29T02:29Z,"Wow. :P Love the positive response!

Remember though, I just found the torrent and posted it on piratebay, so I can't take credit for the upload, but the thanks are appreciated.

See a need, fill a need. If someone else doesn't upload future episodes to thepiratebay in 720p HD, I'll definitely do what I can to find it and post it here for everyone to enjoy.

Long live Futurama!"
,Wopatoolie,2010-06-29T10:43Z,nice quality but you cut off the end of ep 2
,bart107,2010-06-30T07:41Z,"thanks, got them already but Ep 2 wasnt in 720p

wish all torrents got this speed-avewrage 950kbps "
,bart107,2010-06-30T07:53Z,"the difference from 624X352 to 1280X720 is remarkable from the colour of the people to just the  colour of the credits 

wish there was a 1080P version"
,Awesomo42,2010-07-02T00:40Z,"Sorry, but Episode 2 IS in 720p, and you don't miss anything at the end, the file simply ends near the end of the final fade out instead of at the veeeeery end of it.

Glad you're all enjoying it though, I'll be sure to get tonight's episode up ASAP if no one else does."
,bart107,2010-07-02T08:40Z,"@ awesomo ""Sorry, but Episode 2 IS in 720p,""
