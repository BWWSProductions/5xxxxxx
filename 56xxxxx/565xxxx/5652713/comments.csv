matter of fact [and i'm sure you already know] this 'opera' is filled with Masonic symbolism.. so, i'm trying to figure it out.. was he accused of leaking something.. or something..?"

Mozart WAS a Freemason. Why would the people he called his BROTHERS put him to death. He was one of the most famous Freemasons in history, he was in 2 different masonic Lodges.

Plus he wrote another 5 pieces after writing this..."
[T],TalmudTimmy,2011-02-26T19:09Z,Mozart was a Masonic defector obviously. And that is something you just don't do.

,kapamarou79,2011-05-16T18:54Z,You are absolutely wrong about the death of Mozart.He is one of the most respected Freemasons and he died from rheumatic fever
