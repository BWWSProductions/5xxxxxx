     The p2p sourced grp LAP tried to pass their whatever it was    
     source (such a big movie with AC3 2.0, who are you kidding)    
     for a retail release with english subs. We don't know what     
     they used for this one but the subs were clearly fansubs       
     .srt converted to vobsubs. Not bad as such maybe (our swedish  
     is lacking) but filled with grammer, punctuation and spelling  
     errors.
