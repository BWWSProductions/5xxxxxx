Wade Davis makes a remarkable journey from the chaos and violence of modern day lowland Colombia to the frozen peaks of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the sacred heart of the world of the Elder Brother, an indigenous group who claim to be the last descendents of a once great civilisation. They are caught between left wing guerrillas and right wing paramilitaries who have slaughtered them in Colombiaâ€™s undeclared civil war. In the company of priests and novices of one of the groups of the Elder Brother, he treks high into the Sierra, accompanying them on a pilgrimage to offerings at the sacred lakes at the mountains summit.
