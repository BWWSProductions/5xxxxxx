CIA vs KGB anyone??? plzzzzz"
,shadocat1455,2010-06-30T13:31Z,"episode 9 was aired on the 27th, last sunday. i think that ""special night"" bullcrap tricked our faithfull uploaders. at least the website for deadliest warrior itself will post that episode in 2 weeks  :P"

,Torrent_Hog,2010-06-30T20:33Z,"@shadocat1455

whats the Deadliest Warrior website that you spoke of?"
,shadocat1455,2010-07-01T00:03Z,"i believe its thru spike, but all i do is go to google and type in deadliest warrior, then its the first link. on the actual site, you just go to the full episodes tab. they post the shows 2 weeks after their aired(so hopefully a week from this sunday coming)"
,ljob12,2010-07-02T20:17Z,"I would be able to upload it as I bought it through iTunes and removed the DRM, but my PC isn't working, so you guys will have to wait till my graphics card gets here lol"
,berkutfgfa,2010-07-03T08:00Z,thanks in advance to ljob12
,Master_0f_Puppets,2010-07-03T09:14Z,"Thanks, just post the link here once it's up."
,ljob12,2010-07-04T19:06Z,"Just thought i'd update, I'm getting the graphics card June 8th, so it'll probably be up by then or 9th, unless i can get itunes to stop doing this stupid ""Your computer is not authorised to play this"" and if i authorise it it just says ""your computer is already authorised"", and all it plays is a gray box. I'll be able to upload an HD version if someone helps ;)"
,ljob12,2010-07-04T22:44Z,"OK, i got everything done, now i just need a seed box so that i won't have troubles with seeding a near 2GB file (i like quality :P) to many people at once :)

Here's a screen shot comparative for anyone drooling in anticipation(done on a 25 inch monitor)
