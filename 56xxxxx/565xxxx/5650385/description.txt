And now four more records for the lovers of the best music ever, new wave and the post-punk. My excuses for the low volume of The Look LP as it's a very old rip and the original lp no longer available to re-rip. just adjust the volume in your ipod and enjoy it!


Behind The Mirror - One Life (1990)

Deserters - Siberian Nightlife [1983]

New Math - Wake The Dead (Compilation)

The Look - The Look [1981]
