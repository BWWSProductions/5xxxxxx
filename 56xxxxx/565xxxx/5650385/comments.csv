,freebeestud,2010-06-28T20:37Z,"80zforever thanks for what you've done for us still lost in the 80s that are seeking rare jewels we missed out on. 
 I've been looking for the Q-feel album if you have any information it would be much appreciated."
[V],80zforever,2010-06-29T09:42Z,"freebeestud, I have the q-feel album but the quality is so-so. A cool dude here has offered to rip his lp to be posted in these series. I will post either his or mine depending on the quality. cheers"
,rtrifunov,2010-06-30T15:21Z,"The album from Behind the Mirror is extremely rare and yet an exquisite album. 
I've listened to the Red 7's When the Sun Goes Down (1987) from one of your previous uploads and I liked it very much. I wonder if you possess their very rare eponymous first album. In case you have it, please upload it if you consider it worthy enough. 
Thnx for all your efforts once again. Cheers"
[V],80zforever,2010-07-01T07:21Z,rtrifunov I had posted Red 7's debut record in 4 Rare 80s Albums [Part 76]. I think it's still seeded. If not let me know to re-up it for u.
,rtrifunov,2010-07-01T11:01Z,"Yes, 80z, you're right. My mistake, sorry, I've overlooked it."
