The battle between East and West continues to escalate as Agent 009-1 takes on her greatest challenge yet: trying to find time to relax! Just wait 'til you see what she calls a vacation! First she finds herself going toe-to-toe with a deadly cyborg that has "strategically-placed" golden guns! Then she discovers that an old friend, who originally helped her defect, has gone double agent and is smuggling intelligence to both sides for extra cash! Will she reminisce with him about old times or have to take him out? Meanwhile, Mylene's superiors think she's going too soft on the bad guys! Are they actually keeping an eye on the body count?
