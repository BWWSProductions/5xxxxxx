PrisM Notes::::::::::::
well....their is alot of versions out their now, so some may see this pointless but ours was encoding last night, took quite a while, source was very orange, infact theirs a couple releases even more orange than source out their, anyway resized resolution to something what was good, then added saturation filter lowering it down quite alot, then changed the red down quite much, changed the other colors also tried to lowering the colors as they was pretty damn heavy, increased brightness a touch, and lowered contrast...overall it's far from perfect, but im sure someone will be happy with it, used imagine's audio thnx.
