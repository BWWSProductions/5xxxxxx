Alex Jones Quotes of the Day ::
 
"My issue is they've got 400 nukes, they're not going anywhere; and I want to stop my property taxes going up, but all we can talk about is jews all day!"

"I'd say maybe 20 percent of internet activity that's anti- New World Order is actually about me."

Bilderberg hounds Mark Anderson and Jim Tucker talk with Alex about the latest globalist confab in Spain. American Free Press journalist Tucker, considered the the doyen of Bilderberg hunters, has focused on exposing the secretive group since 1975. Tucker is prominently featured in Alex Jones' film Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement. 
[Anderson comes on from 24:00 until 38:00 in hour 2. Tucker is not heard from.]

Alex also talks with author and former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky about the Israeli attack on the Gaza flotilla. Ostrovsky is the author of the 1990 New York Times bestseller By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer and The Other Side of Deception.

Alex also covers the latest news and takes a number of calls.


NOTE: A caller "Blondie in Texas," just at the end of the 1st half of hour 2 asks Alex if he still believes what he stated yesterday -- that the flotilla may have been a staged event to draw Israel into responding. Alex told him to "stay there," i.e., hold on the line through the break. That caller was not heard from again.

[Ted Anderson -- ownder of GCN Radio Network -- is in studio from 14:00 in hour 4 until the half-hour break, doing a "live commercial" for his gold business, Midas Resources.]

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
