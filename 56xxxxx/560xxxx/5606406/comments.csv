[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-06-05T20:59Z,"The only reason for Alex ""Judas Goat"" Jones to put on such a high profile like Victor Ostrovsky, is to control the anti-Zionist movement.

Normally Jones wouldn't touch anything that deeply criticizes Israel or Judaism, so one would naturally inquire as to why Jones would bring on Ostrovsky, a man who exposed the Israelis for being terrorists, even bigger terrorists than Muslims.

Ostrovsky is selling out though. Ostrovsky is a smart man and knows Alex Jones is a Jewish shill, so why would he go on the show and clear Israel's name? Because Ostrovsky was a plant from the beginning (while writing The Other Side of Deception and By Way of Deception) or, he is being blackmailed into retracting his writings, which are extremely damaging to the Israeli terrorist network.

Either way, Jones is pulling a fast one on his sheeple viewers. Jones is not a neutral as he claims. We have him on record supporting the State of Israel. He is a Zionist, his wife is a Zionist, and most of his sponsors and advertisers are Zionists.

Shills! Both of them."
