[V],globeplus,2010-06-01T23:01Z,"it is not possible for circunstancial reasons put the normal pictures in the files , maybe that will be possible soon . "
,bloop1000,2010-06-02T02:02Z,Sorry but quality is terrible.
[V],globeplus,2010-06-02T03:33Z,to bloop1000 : drink less ... that will be good to you .
,bloop1000,2010-06-02T04:01Z,@globeplus Thanks for the advice. Perhaps I should take up drinking.  It might make the quality look better :-)
[V],globeplus,2010-06-02T04:45Z,"To bloop1000 : i hope you not be on drugs too , that is not good to health and you know it ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-02T12:12Z,"To BracGipsy : I understand what you mean and in sme way of course  you´re right , in the way that this is not a real DVDrip but we have to say : WHAT A CAM WORK !!! Perfectly stable , nice position on the cinema , good picture and sound , this is for a cam a very good work , i picked up the imagine file that is vedry well seeded and peers too then i worked out the picture , the quality in the imagine is good but the true is that the picture quality have the possibility to improve a bit putting way a few color pixels that gives a little bit more scratchy picture , cleaning more as possible in a correct way this color pixels , we get a perfect clean picture with the correct brightness then i applied the only subtitles in english available in the net and they are nice syncronised and who made the subtitles , without beeing perfect , we can say that was a nice work too and i applly them in a very nice yellow carachteres with the correct proportions , not to big carachteres , not too small , you can be a few meters from the screen that the subtitles still have a nice clean view no matter what , so analising my work with the nice original picture that i use to make the work , we can say that we really have here , a nice quality release with nice subtitles synchronised and WHAT A NICE FANTASY MOVIE !!! Really recomendable to everyone , this is really , a movie for all family ..."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-02T12:43Z,"To complement the before comment : i know that can be tough have a great number of seeds on this file but i think the work still deserve a nice seeding and peers , comparing the picture and sound that i have here in this file with the others available files the users certainly not disappointed and in a nice way this file is recomendable in the way that was the correct possible work to do analising correctly the inicial file used to make the work , so , no matter what , i really have a nice release for this movie here . I am basically a games uploader but i certainly like a new nice movie too and i can do nice work on the movie files too beside the fact that my base of work is new nice pc games but work in a new nice movie once in while don´tkill me for shore and everybody likes to watch a nice movie ."
