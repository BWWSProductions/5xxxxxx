Video has Dual Audio Russian and English, Video quality is Excellent, However there are two small logos One in the top right corner and the other in the bottom left, I'm checking the other H-Res file to see if it also has this minor annoyance, I'll report back when it is done. 

For those bitching about it being in Russian, you should really learn about what you're doing wrong before you start compalining. Use VLC player
