I trust u don't mean it's dubbed! 
Please clarify this for us!
thanx! "
,orosas,2010-06-04T21:55Z,Thanks a lot! ...I have been looking for it a long time.
,shango,2010-06-04T22:42Z,"I have not seen this one so I dont know what its like nor the subtitles. Amazon says its in english but you are right it has to be spanish with english subtitles. I dont know what else is included on the disc.

holy mountain next."
,russell1nash,2010-06-04T23:45Z,"well, i, for one, would be glad if u could take 2-3 mins and check about the subs/audio thingy... 

thanx, anyway!"
,shango,2010-06-06T02:17Z,Well its the same disc as the one on amazon. His films are all in spanish with english subtitles for north america.
