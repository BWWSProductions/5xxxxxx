,rdevil13,2010-08-10T05:04Z,"Lady Gaga and Rihanna did not record Silly Boy. The vocals on the track are performed by Eva Simmons. Kayne West posted the track on his blog, misidentifying it as Rihanna/Gaga. He corrected himself the following day. This is confirmed on Gaga's extensive wiki, Gagapedia.
There are many tracks floating around that are mistakenly credited to Gaga - either as a vocalist or songwriter. "
