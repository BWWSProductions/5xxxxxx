Thoovanathumbikal (Translation: Dragon Flies in the Spraying Rain) is a 1987 Indian film written and directed by the late P. Padmarajan, which is based on his own short story Udakappola. The protagonist is Jayakrishnan, who displays two entirely different faces, that of a rustic person and a sophisticated one. The film won rare accolades for the brilliant script. Perumbavoor G. Raveendranath composed some excellent musical scores (Onnaam Raagam Paadi,Megham Poothu Thudangi) for the film. Mohanlal is seen delivering one of his best performances as Jayakrishnan. The highlight of the film is the bold subject that is not dealt with usually in Malayalam films.
