*NOTE: This is the corrected version (last version had left and right channels swapped).

All files 24-bit, 96kHz audio.

vinyl transfer rig:

PS Audio GCPH phono preamplifier
Yaqin tube buffer "power amplifier" (1 nos telefunken 6n11 tube)
Macbook Pro
Audacity

A few things: 
There is more than a little surface noise on Shine On You Crazy Diamond, parts 1-5, especially in the first few minutes.  The rest of the album is extremely quiet; and is particularly low on surface noise, given its age (I believe this record was manufactured in 1980).
Also, I inadvertently cut off the last few seconds of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, parts 6-9. (EDIT: I hear a little distortion at 8:38 on the first track - it's not clipping.  There must be some wear on the vinyl, probably due to whomever owned this record before me lowering the "needle" where the vocals begin, which is right after 8:38).

Please, and I'm not asking this lightly, reseed when you have finished downloading.  Thank you.
