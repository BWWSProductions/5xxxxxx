n.a.K. House Mix XI - A Deadmau5 Mix (XXXI-V-MMX)

Brought to you by www d0t musicthroughscience d0t com


My latest House Mix is finally complete!  After numerous delays I've finally been able to complete the Deadmau5 themed mix I promised all of you some time ago.  Thanks for your patience and I'm sure you will enjoy every second of it.  Searching through Deadmau5' entire discography is pretty daunting however after a thorough listen through I've brought to the table 14 awesome tracks mixed entirely for you.  As per usual, all mixing/dubbing/editing is done by me and mixed in a single/final take.

My next themed mix is still at the drawing board however work will commence very soon I can promise you that.  Check out my facebook fan page (n.a.K.) in the mean time and remember to check in every now and then for updates!  Thanks for you support and enjoy the music.  Keep dancing everyone!

Cheers,

n.a.K.
