- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   he Hellacopters are one of the few international bands esteemed, and loved,
   for their pure garage rock. Having amicably disbanded in 2008, founding
   member Nicke Andersson went about working on a solo project. As often with
   best laid plans, they change and Mr. Andersson turned his project into a
   band, Imperial State Electric, by adding Dolph de Borst (vocals, bass),
   Tobias Egge (vocals, guitar), and Thomas Eriksson (drums). For those who were
   missing The Hellacopters, take heart because ISE's debut will soothe your
   grief and enliven your musical hearts.
   One of the blessings of Andersson's technique, and that of The Hellacopters,
   was the ability to draw inspiration from many sources of fundamental rock. In
   the case of Imperial State Electric, the overarching metaphor reaches to mid
   1960's to mid 1970's rock, often on the Brit side of pop like the very
   Beatlesque I'll Let You Down or towards American, near southern California,
   pop on Resign. Sometimes it's mere hook-laden power pop as on Throwing Stones
   or Lord Knows I Know that It Ain't Right. Another, Deja Vu, sounds like
   sloppy 70's British rock made raw with a punk undercoating. Then Alive
   reminds of 80's melodic hard rock, stripped of the varnish of the glitz and
   overproduction down to its bare bones. Sometimes things sputter along
   creating no real interest like I Got All Day Long or LeeAnne, but these are
   minor speed bumps. Nicke Andersson's return, with his new band Imperial State
   Electric, proves that fundamental rock, stripped of its modern
   embellishments, still has energy and vitality above those same modern trends.
   Recommended.
