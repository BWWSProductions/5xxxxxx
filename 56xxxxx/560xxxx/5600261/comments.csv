,Ykalon,2010-05-31T02:29Z,"There is WAY more evidence that vaccinations DON'T cause autism. The whole New World Order crap is just fraud to get you to buy their totally unscientific ""proofs"", it's just lies."
[T],one_last_round,2010-05-31T21:03Z,"Ykalon, people like do all the 
talking, but you know what.....

You won't even watch this short
video.  So before you even open
your mouth, do us all a favor
and watch this video."
[T],one_last_round,2010-05-31T21:41Z,"can someone let me know if 
the search is working?

What I mean is that usually
when you type in something
like BBC, PBS, into the 
search this torrent is 
suppose to show up.

And it doesn't for me.
So I am wondering how
you guys found this
torrent and if the search
is working for you."

One last round I'm looking at your inbred arse, princess. Thanks to 100% BULLSHIT MYTHS like vaccinations causing autism 20% off the worlds children are not vaccinated and MILLIONS are dying of curable crap like measles.  If you support this documentary you're a complete idiot - or you're sleeping with One Last Round, which would make you his sister.  If you meet someone who takes this seriously and don't kill them you've let all humans down.  GROW A BRAIN YOU IGNORANT CUNTS."
[T],one_last_round,2010-06-08T23:24Z,"the hard part about this 
is maybe your son has
autism or brother 
but running isn't going to 
make it any easier"
,mordokch,2010-08-20T04:06Z,"I'l watch the vid and make my own mind up (or not) - really don't need to be told what to think, or not think."
,VashtaGryph,2011-05-24T23:35Z,"First of all the research that claimed vaccinations cause autism has been discredited entirely. It was falsified, and the man responsible is a complete and utter bullshit spewing douche who should not be referred to as neither doctor or scientist. Secondly, if someone has seen factual and credible evidence contrary to the claims of a video then why do they need to watch the nonsense before they can comment on it? The message of the video is made clear in your posting of it. Thirdly, of course the government doesn't care about you. No modern government cares about its people. Politicians become politicians to make money and abuse power, very few even try to do real good, and those who do are usually facing enemies from every angle. That's not a conspiracy. That's fucking obvious. Maybe instead of buying into every half baked conspiracy you can actually just look at the obvious truths and try to enlighten the general public to those, as a starter, because then you won't seem crazy and might actually do some good."
