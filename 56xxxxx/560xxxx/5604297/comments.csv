,Ted_Sheckler,2010-06-03T09:56Z,Not sure if you know but a lot of your files haven't been working lately. If you try to fast forward past a certain point it glitches and starts the whole track over. Also the last 45 minutes or so of today's show are cut off. Just a heads up in case you didn't know.

Anyways, Shu still rules. Thank you man"
