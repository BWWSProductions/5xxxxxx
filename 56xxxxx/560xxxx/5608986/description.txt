NO LITTLE BOY is a unique collection that serves as both John Martyn career primer and snapshot of the Scottish singer-songwriter's early 1990's sound. Composed of re-recordings of many of Martyn's best-known songs, the album smoothes out the rough edges and enlists the help of stellar sidemen likePhil Collins and David Gilmour in an effort that ends up giving the formerly dark, moody material a jazzy Sade-esque adult-contemporary treatment. A bold attempt at lending a commercial sheen to a decidedly un-commercial artist, NO LITTLE BOY succeeds on its own merits
