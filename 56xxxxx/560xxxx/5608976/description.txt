Lee J. Cobb left this series for the second and last 
time in late 1965, and this is his final episode....
although you would never know from watching it.

Cobb would continue to be seen in the opening credits 
for the rest of the 4th Season. There would be a 
new owner of the Shiloh ranch just a few episodes later.

His post-Virginian movie and TV appearances were wide 
in range, starting with The Hallmark Hall of Fame 
presentation of "Death of a Salesman", with Cobb as 
Willie Loman and Dustin Hoffman as one of his adult sons.  
He was also in noteable movies, such as "Coogan's Bluff" 
starring Clint Eastwood, and he played a cop in "The Exorcist".

The noteable guest stars in this episode are James Whitmore, 
Virginia Grey, Peter Whitney, and John Mitchum.
