Section 25 - From the Hip - Factory Records - Fact 90



Few bands are as influential as Section 25 whilst remaining relatively unknown. This album (produced by Bernard Sumner [Joy Division / New Order / Bad Lieutenant])has been repeatedly sampled by a variety of club hits in the 26 years since its release.

Credited as the precursors of house, tecno and chill this was experimental and cutting edge on release and still sounds fresh to the modern ear.
