Wikipedia - Shine is the second album by hip hop singer, Estelle. The album was released on 31 March 2008 with the lead single, "Wait a Minute (Just a Touch)", released in November 2007. The second single, "American Boy" featuring Kanye West reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on downloads alone and was released physically on March 24. The American Boy remixes, and the Album "Shine" were taken from the US iTunes store due to a decision by Atlantic to follow Kid Rock's successful decision to not sell his latest album on iTunes or any digital retailer. It was added back onto the store on 9 September[1]  due to a large drop in sales and "American Boy"'s decline in Billboard rankings. Shine has been certified Gold in the UK, denoting 100,000 copies sold. It features the Grammy-winning Single American Boy.  Shine was one of the twelve nominees for the 2008 Mercury Prize.

Amazon.co.uk Review By Danny McKenna - Award-winning British artist Estelle never got her just desserts for her 2004 debut album The 18th Day. Though the record was a critical success, it failed to make the mainstream splash many had hoped for. Her sophomore project, Shine, seems hell bent on avoiding the same fate. Backed up by a coterie of high profile US starlets--Wyclef Jean, will.i.am, Mark Ronson and Kanye West--Shine has surefire commercial success written all over it; though that's not to say Estelle has sold out. Despite the high-impact American-style production, Shine remains reassuringly British. Estelle's West London twang is as sharp as ever, and even Kanye drops rhymes about "WAGS" and "London Boys" (see single "American Boy"). It's every bit as diverse as its predecessor too, featuring dancehall party jams ("Magnificent", produced by Mark Ronson and featuring Kardinal Offishall), the will.i.am produced "Wait a Minute (Just a Touch)" (which uses a twisted up sample from Screamin' Jay Hawkins' "I Put a Spell on You") to lovers' rock ("Come Over") and, of course, some love ballads too, such as "Substitute Lover", overseen by Wyclef. A solid all-round follow up, Shine should give Estelle the commercial success she deserves.
