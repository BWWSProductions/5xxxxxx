Well written article about little known legal facts about how the once great nation of the United States has used it's own Constitution to take the freedom away from its people and in turn give them benefits for being trustees of the 14th amendment. The article also discusses how each individual can take back their real freedoms by using the Constitution to their own advantage, while they still can. These truths will help educate and set people free.


Enjoy and Spread the word.
