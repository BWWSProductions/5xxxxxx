"Canicule et ours polaires" is the second release and first EP from Montreal rockers Vanesse Parietaire. Made up of left-over music from the band's previous LP recording session, CEOP is a conceptual record about 6 neighbors all sharing different forms of dependency. Faster and more effective than the complex and eclectic "La mer etait vide" LP, CEOP is said to bridge the gap between the band's early indie-sounding experiments and the more immediate sound of future works.
