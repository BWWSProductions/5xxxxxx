HOT TUB TIME MACHINE follows a group of best friends whoâ€™ve become bored with their adult lives: Adam (John Cusack) has been dumped by his girlfriend; Lou (Rob Corddry) is a party guy who canâ€™t find the party; Nickâ€™s (Craig Robinson) wife controls his every move; and video game-obsessed Jacob (Clark Duke) wonâ€™t leave his basement. After a crazy night of drinking in a ski resort hot tub, the men wake up, heads pounding, in the year 1986. This is their chance to kick some past and change their futures â€“ one will find a new love life, one will learn to stand up for himself with the ladies, one will find his mojo, and one will make sure he still exists!
