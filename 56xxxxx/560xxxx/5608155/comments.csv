,wackeypei,2010-06-05T03:21Z,Please SEED....
,brian0423,2010-06-05T04:43Z,"Sometimes places sell games before they are released...mostly mom and pop video game stores. i know a few around me, once they receive them they ignore the ""do not sell before"" stickers."
,gzasjones,2010-06-05T05:35Z,can you copy store bought games?
,fluffyvt,2010-06-05T06:32Z,no you can't copy store bought games. you have to get magic copies from the tooth fairy. of course you can. how else would they get online?

,fluffyvt,2010-06-07T06:38Z,so this is more of topic with the gameplay rather than the torrent. i burned and have been playing for a few hours and this game sucks. the graphics are horrible and everything seems messed up. and that IS taking into consideration that this is a WHOLE different setup. Everything looks VERY smoothed out but absolutely no detail. it looks like something made in the 64 of ps1 days. and the gameplay even with all the new features seems dull. maybe i just played 10 too much. what does everyone else think?
,nffctom,2010-06-08T14:26Z,when i download a torrent i end up with loads of files in a folder what should i do from there can anyone help me thanks.
,wyteboi87,2010-06-08T22:22Z,nffctom- left click the file and extract with winrar after u unpack with winrar it should give u a .iso and sometimes a dvd file..then run ur .iso file thru abgx to see if it is patched and get the dvd file u need to make ur backup after it is verified burn with imgburn using a dl dvd and the .dvd file (i had a hard time but real easy once you do it) 
,ninjanutta,2010-06-09T00:36Z,"@fluffy,i think you must have a crap setup because this is better than 10 in every way possible,far better graphics and much more precise gameplay.you did play too much of 10,sure its not still in your box?"
,meatheadrhino,2010-06-10T12:38Z,Awesome 10/10 thanks!!!!!
,memoryleak,2010-06-11T12:15Z,Sorry guys I'm kinda new to the whole 360 stuff is this copy cracked and stealthed already?
,CDNAussie,2010-06-28T03:04Z,anyone got the enabling code for the online portion??...btw awesome upload...downloaded this in about 3 hours running at 1 kb/s+ the whole time..game is awesome..just find it loads slow
,lastjedi,2010-07-12T20:04Z,this game does indeed suck so does the 2010 version.does anybody have the 09 version to upload.tiger woods hasnt made az good game since then.
