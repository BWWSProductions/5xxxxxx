Release Info:

Gamers will select a team and square off to try and bring home The Ryder Cup
for their squad in Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11 on all console platforms.
The Ryder Cup is one of the last great sporting events to be founded
in prestige rather than prize money. Choose from the U.S. or European
squad and participate in the various competition formats - foursomes
where players hit alternate shots, fourballs and singles which
traditionally bring the biennial event to a close with players going
head to head.
