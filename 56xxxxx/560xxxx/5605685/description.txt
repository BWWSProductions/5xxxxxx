    Perth is the journey into the heart of Harry Lee, a 51-year-old          
    part-time security guard and taxi driver. He belongs to a redundant      
    generation, eclipsed by a fast-paced, elitist society that is            
    mesmerized with education and status. Harry desires to leave the         
    antiseptic streets of Singapore for his paradise on earth in Western     
    Australia. His attempt to migrate is complicated when he takes on a      
    job ferrying prostitutes. This evokes painful memories from his past.    
    When he takes an unhealthy interest in a Vietnamese prostitute, it       
    awakens a dark and dangerous attempt at personal redemption. The film    
    tackles an extremely topical issue of emigration in Singapore. It is     
    peppered by denizens of the underbelly of Singapore society,             
    reflecting the multicultural idiosyncrasies of a seemingly pristine      
    city. More importantly, it is a personal journey of a flawed man in a    
    society that does not tolerate failure. As such, Harry s rant and        
    anger - directed at anyone and anything, but himself - is merely a       
    distraction from his own feelings of impotency within society, and       
    his inability to find redemption from his past.
