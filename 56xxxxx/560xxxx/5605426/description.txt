Imagine if you'd had a six-foot tall monster to help
you through the rough times when you were 11! Willy is
terrified about moving into the family's new house
He's convinced it's filled with evil space aliens out
to get him. In response to his wish for someone to save
him, Gooby comes to life as a loveable, full-size
scraggly, orange, furry creature who in fact seems more
frightened of the world than Willy. The two have
hair-raising adventures and learn something about the
power of friendship. In the end, Gooby fulfills Willy's
initial wish by bringing Willy and his dad together in
a touching and exciting climax
