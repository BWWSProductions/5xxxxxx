Thanks man ;-)"
,sikstik,2010-06-09T13:40Z,Thank you!!!
,Doc-Nowhere,2010-06-12T10:12Z,"Omg! So nice! This was my fav. antivirus scan software!
Thanks again- works as a charm."
,xeneg,2010-06-18T15:37Z,Do you have a 64 bit version of this?
,drewcula,2010-06-18T15:54Z,"I love this but ESET NOD 32 Smart Security keeps saying the crack is a ""variant of WIN32/Packed VMProtect.AAA Trojan"" 
I can't tell is it a false positive? If so how do I get around it with NOD?
If it is, that's a problem."
,NetComm,2010-06-19T15:25Z,Would be great for 64-bit to be created too.
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-20T08:55Z,"@drewcula 

Here's what senior pirates know a long time about false postives and what to do:

In case the crack is detected by your av software you'll need to add the crack 
to the exclusions list from your av software. Exclude the crack from being 
real-time protected and auto-scanned by your av software. Also exclude the 
crack which is copied to the installation directory of the program, otherwise 
you won't be able to run the program. You may need to turn off your av software 
temporarily to be able to add the crack to the av exclusions list."
,erikieperikie,2010-07-05T00:02Z,"Hey!

Is there any chance you could make a crack for this Hitman Pro version, but then 64-bit? I don't have 32-bit and the installer of this 32-bit version prompts me to download the 64-bit version.

I tried the crack, just in case it would work, but as I expected: it doesn't.

So please, make a 64-bit crack/license key!"
,axeman5,2010-07-12T06:15Z,"Awesome dude, its just awesome!nWhen do you think you\'ll be able to update it?nThere\'s a new version out, 3.5.6. This version usesnNOD32, avira antivir, a-squared, prevx, and g-data. The next version replaces NOD32, a squared and avira with DR Webb IT, ikaurus, and emisoft. I don\'t know how you cracked it, but if you could make a crack for 3.5.6 build 106, that would be splendiferous!nSeed til I die (well, maybe!)"
,Ladious,2010-07-26T15:23Z,RH...Please make 64bit =( urgent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,oXXoBio,2010-08-29T11:43Z,"How the original .exe (Hitman Pro) could be detected as virus? I am using Mcafee
Its simply because you had integrated some kind of stuff with that..

 Yep i am not using that."
,la_cross37,2010-08-31T19:46Z,pls upload the 64 bit version
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-09T02:30Z,"@oXXoBio

Ask the publishers of Mcafee or Hitman why Mcafee detects Hitman Pro v3.5.5 Build 98 (32-bit)."
,justmealwatts,2010-09-11T04:14Z,"Thank you RobbingHood !!!. This is a great program with a working crack. This program fixed my ""searches"" from being redirected to another website. I will definitely keep this program in my toolbox. Installed as a trial and then applied crack. A++++++++++"
,floatcrock,2010-09-30T04:34Z,"I'm will not say anything, you make up you're own mind, however iam very much aware of false positive when it come to this kinda of hacks. And find it ironic to tell someone to shut down all defence before it can even be touched, cuz a less experience user would

,west245,2010-11-02T04:05Z,"oops disregard last comment, figured it out. it did the stupid auto remove stuff so i just did open and then extracted the crack itself. works great thanks"

,buddahass,2011-02-11T08:42Z,"Great upload!  
Occasionally this obscure specialist, parked in the dusty corner of the programs folder, gets called upon to save the day. 
After downloading  the hefty 8 months worth of missed updates, kinda sucked, to then find out it expired 7 months back.
...or rather, before granted liberty.  

Thanks Robbing Hood! "
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-02-12T22:10Z,Unfortunately this didn't work for me because my OS is 64 bit. :(  Got anything for Advanced PDF Tools 2.0?  Everything I've tried has been a virus.
,Twizted1,2011-03-17T04:58Z,"Microsoft Security Essentials detected:

VirTool:Win32/Obfuscator

These are detections for programs that have had their purpose obfuscated to hinder analysis or  detection by anti-virus scanners. They commonly employ a combination of methods including encryption, compression, anti-debugging and anti-emulation techniques.

These obfuscation techniques are used on various kinds of malware. The malware that lies ""underneath"" may have virtually any purpose.

MSE has only detected ""real"" threats. If MSE says ""no good"", then I don't play.

,RuneRifle,2011-04-27T20:37Z,"It worked for like a year or longer for me.. until AVG got an update and now sees this as a virus.. :S

I know it's not, but it's really annoying. Can you fix this with a patch or something?

Thank anyway! It works great!"
