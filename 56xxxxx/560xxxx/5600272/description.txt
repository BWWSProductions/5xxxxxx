IMPORTANT NOTES- AV Scan results of crack HitmanPro35.exe (size: 4,20 MB):
**************************************************************************

1- Norton Internet Security: Clean. 

2- avast! Pro Antivirus: Clean.

3- Avira AntiVir Premium: Clean. 

4- Kaspersky Antivirus identifies crack HitmanPro35.exe as a possible threat: 
   - Risk name: HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic  	
   - Risk type: Virus


The av scan results are from May 30, 2010. 

The av scan result of Kaspersky is a false positive due to some used binaries 
and cryptors (or maybe HitmanPro35.exe is also added to their virus database).
So just stay cool ... or don't use this!!!

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!



<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
> Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this! <

                    Hitman Pro v3.5.5 Build 98 (32-bit) + Crack



Release date: April 27, 2010 


Description:
************

This software can help you find and remove new unknown threats.

Hitman Pro 3 is a computer program to detect and remove adware, spyware, viruses 
and other malware using extensive behavioural analysis and cloud computing. The 
program is developed by SurfRight. First it detects viruses and other files that 
have a suspicious behaviour (behaviour analysis) and sends them then to the scan 
cloud via the Internet. The malicious files are detected in the scan cloud where 
these are removed by Hitman Pro 3. 

The new version of Hitman Pro, version 3, uses NOD32 Antivirus, Avira AntiVir, 
Prevx, G DATA Anti-Virus and a-squared Anti-Malware to detect malicious software. 

As the various virus scanners are not installed on the local computer, but in the 
scan cloud on Internet, there is a very low system load. This technology is called 
"cloud computing" and is possible using behavioural analysis that can differentiate
legitimate from malicious software.



Info:
*****

Hitman Pro is a second opinion scanner, designed to rescue your computer from 
malware (viruses, spyware, rootkits, etc.) that have infected your computer 
despite all the security measures you have taken (such as anti virus software, 
firewalls, etc.). 

Hitman Pro 3 is a fast All-in-One tool to locate, identify and remove viruses, 
spyware, trojans, rootkits and other malware. Hitman Pro 3 will quickly show if 
your PC is infected with malicious software. 

Just relying on a single vendor is not sufficient to completely protect you. 
You do need a second source to make sure you are secure. Hitman Pro is designed 
to work alongside existing security programs without any conflicts.

Research shows that many computers are infected, even if they have an up-to-date 
security suite installed, and that a combination of different antimalware programs 
would be required to prevent infection. 

Hitman Pro 3 uses innovative cloud computing techniques to detect and remove 
potential malware threats with minimal impact on system performance. 



Overview:
*********

Hitman Pro does not need to install any third party sofware. It is a stand alone 
program which looks for unknown and suspicious files, giving each of them a score 
using a patent pending technique. Unknown and suspicious files are automatically 
identified by online identification servers. This means no software on your system.

Hitman Pro does not scan your system alphabetically, it scans disk objects in 
physical order on your disk. This also significantly lowers the stress on your 
hardware. Furthermore, a lot of analysis tasks are performed concurrently by 
deploying tasks multi-threaded. And if you own a multi-core processor, this 
software can efficiently use the extra cores in order to increase enumeration 
speed even more.

Hitman Pro doesnâ€™t need to scan every file on your system. Why not? 
We have profiled standard systems so it knows which files are good. Also, Hitman 
actually focuses on finding objects that donâ€™t behave like good software. Software 
that does not follow trustworthy guidelines will automatically receive a higher 
score than software that is uninstallable by the user, identifyable, digitally 
signed, unencrypted, uncompressed, visible and accessible. 

Hitman Pro scans the computer quickly (less than 5 minutes) and does not slow down 
the computer (except for the few minutes it is scanning). Hitman Pro does not need 
to be installed. It can be run straight from a USB flash drive, a CD/DVD, local or 
network attached hard drive.

A further benefit of this technology is that you need never again download 
definitions on a hourly / daily basis as this is all managed in the cloud further 
reducing the impact on your PC.

The engine also tries to find out where the software came from, how it got on your 
system and what other people say about it on the internet. That probably sounds 
common sense or seem impossible to some of you but we are certain you will be 
astonished on how well the scoring system works.

To remove malicious software the developers have also built a special removal 
engine that is capable of removing the toughest threats. A native NT application 
is capable of removing resilient threats before Windows starts. And of course, 
including corresponding references like registry keys and shortcuts. All without 
the need of updates and signatures.



Changelog:
**********
 
Hitman Pro 3.5.5 Build 98 (32-bit) (2010-04-27): 
- Added WinHTTP prerequisite check. A message is displayed on computers 
  running Windows 2000 pre-SP3 and Windows XP RTM. 
- Fixed a problem on computers receiving the message: "The procedure entry point 
  EncodePointer could not be located in the dynamic link library kernel32.dll". 
- Added Czech language.
- Added Swedish language.


Hitman Pro 3.5.5 Build 97 (32-bit) (2010-04-24):
- Added Quick scan which only scans load point locations and in memory objects.
  You typically use the Quick scan when you just want to check whether malware 
  is active on the computer. You can choose Quick scan from the split button on 
  the Welcome dialog or specify the /quick command line switch. 
- Improved the overall scan performance on systems protected by an active 
  on-access AV scanner.
- Fixed a memory leak reducing memory consumption by 20-40MB compared to previous 
  versions.
- Replaced WinInet by WinHTTP network stack for internet communication. 
  This allows more proxy options and also allows Hitman Pro to run under different 
  accounts like SYSTEM. This is particularly useful in corporate situations.
- Improved the Scan-at-startup by postponing the scan until the computer has 
  started up (hard disk activity is near idle).
  Postponing the startup scan improves the overall computer startup speed. Hitman 
  Pro monitors the "Avg. Disks Queue Length" Performance Counter to determine 
  whether the computer finished starting applications. Hitman Pro postpones the 
  startup scan up to a maximum of 5 minutes. After that, the scan is started, 
  despite hard disk activity. 
- Changed the Scan-at-startup from default normal scan to Quick Scan.
- Fixed a problem with the Winsock repair functionality on 64-bit platforms. 
  Thanks Rein.
- Added Advanced tab under Settings allowing proxy configurations:
  *Use Internet Explorer settings (default)
  *Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD)
  *Proxy Automatic Configuration URL (PAC)
  *Manual proxy configuration
  *Proxy authentication
- Added Compatible Disk Access mode.
  This mode uses the Windows API for accessing the disk. This makes Hitman Pro 
  compatible with hard disk snapshoting tools like Rollback RX and AyRecovery. 
  Note that this mode reduces the chance of finding complex rootkits. You can 
  change the Disk Access mode on the Advanced tab under Settings. 
- Added License tab under Settings.
- Added Apply to all to the drop down action menu of a detected item.
- Added hyperlink to the finish page allowing the scan log to be exported as XML.
- Added /ews command line switch.
- Added /noupload command line switch.
- Added /quick command line switch.
- Added /debug and /debug:full command line switch. Use this switch to generate 
  a mini dump if the program crashes.
- Updated internal white lists.
- Built using Visual Studio 2010.
- Lots of minor internal changes.
- Added Arabic and Polish language.



Languages:
- English, Dutch (Nederlands), Deutsch, FranÃ§ais, 
  Italiano, EspaÃ±ol, Eesti, Greek and Macedonian. 



System Requirements:
- Windows XP, Vista, 2000, 2003, 2008 and Windows 7 (All 32-bit)

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
                                         
* Status torrent at May 30, 2010 - 22.45 CET: clean, tested & working.
