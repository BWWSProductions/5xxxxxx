plot:
The latest episode of the Ã´American ExperienceÃ¶ showcased the horrific
incident known as the My Lai massacre that took place in 1968, in the 
Quang Ngai Province in Vietnam, during the Vietnam war. The story has 
since been recounted numerous times, but in the latest narration, American
Experience tries to make it all relevant, stringing together all the tales
that surround the horrific and gruesome incident in which almost 500 
Vietnamese common people were killed by the troops of the United States
military. However, the telling of the tale, otherwise brilliant, does fall
short in certain counts, like not being able to really look into the matter,
and finding out who had given the order. Also, the show fails to find a 
justification of the whole matter.
