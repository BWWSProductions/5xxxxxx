,matttxxx,2010-06-04T16:43Z,"Yea thx for the upload, looking forward to watching this tonight, i heard its pretty gory and the bloodiest show that has ever aired on UK Television."
,tixan,2010-06-04T21:15Z,"Nice with some horror \o/ :D

Is this somehow based on the movies?"

 This show is a piece of crap... doctors putting weird ""alien"" things inside people to keep them alive long but they can't control it and the ""alien"" takes over and becomes aggressive....once the host is dead the ""alien"" takes over the dead body and attack people...a little like becoming a zombie

nude girls in there though so :)"

Idiot, don't spoil just because you don't like the show."
,tixan,2010-06-05T13:36Z,I also don't find any information if all episodes are about the same story or is it more like Fear Itself and different episodes about different things?
,matttxxx,2010-06-05T14:39Z,"@BlackandBad A.K.A ThickandStupid

Why spoil things for people ? people read comments for AV quality not spoilers dipshit.

A 9
V 9

and @tixan its ongoing and not differant in each episode it would seem."
,skweets,2010-06-05T20:58Z,"Thanks for this.

,LRD3,2010-06-06T15:36Z,"it is obviously ongoing, you could tell by the ending. but as for spoilers they never actually spoil anything. peope still want to know how it got there. 99.9% of people know romeo and juilet die yet still read the book."
