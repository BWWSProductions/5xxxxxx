Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)




This is the 15 minute pilot used to pitch the series to CBS. It was never aired, although some footage was used for "My Fair Munster." It features different actors in the roles of Lily and Eddie. Actually, Lily didn't exist in this pilot. Herman's wife was named Phoebe and was played by Joan Marshall, and Eddie was played (very strangely!) by Nate "Happy" Derman. You will also notice that the set for the inside of the house is VERY different than what ended up being the inside of 1313 Mockingbird lane.

This episode is not "colorized", it was actually filmed IN COLOR!

As a bonus, I've included three Munsters commercials. They are:
1) - Munsters at Marineland Carnival
2) - Munsters Cheerios Commercial
3) - Munsters Escort Santa in Parade

The original unaired pilot I ripped from the first season DVD set, so that's why I indicated it as "DVD quality", but it's only as good as it was filmed for TV back in 1964. The three commercials I just captured from online and they are in .flv (flash video) format, and are easily playable in VLC player (maybe others, too).

I've noticed that season 1 of The Munsters isn't available other than in ISO format. If there's enough interest, I'd be more than happy to make rips of season one.
