,Anton_SCTF,2010-06-02T14:40Z,"ThanX, a real usefulll tool!"
,Pierolle,2010-06-03T16:10Z,"Can this be used as a tool to get pass the Windows login screen without knowing the password (on both XP, Vista & 7)?"
[M],Ubehage,2010-06-03T17:46Z,"Pierolle:
No. I have a cd that can retrieve the password, but it doesn't always work.

This software doesn't care about the password - it just sets a new one, by request ;)"
,TorrentsTPB,2010-06-05T15:32Z,"I'll try this out but you dont say exactly which win systems this works with- x, vista, and win7?

Dont know if u still check but just left a comment on Everybody hates Chris 3 - keep seeding please nobody but u seems to have the whole thing - and thanks for 1 and 2"
[M],Ubehage,2010-06-05T19:21Z,This works with all versions of Windows :)
,grizzmo,2010-08-06T21:34Z,"be carefull, my video card crashed when running this!"
,db78636,2011-01-16T18:08Z,"Works great. If you don't know password for ANY windows installation and just want to clear it out, this is the tool for you. I tested with win 7, but I'd bet will work just fine with XP and shitsta.

There is a graphics safe mode in beginning of process. Try this if graphics crash.

THX 4 this uploader!"
,globalpuffer,2011-02-04T00:05Z,"Thank you Uploader!  Amazing program.  (I only seen a trial version of this that failed to make the changes before.)  Then I dowloaded this, burned to CD and five minutes after I started I was logging into administrator account on my computer!  Win 7 32 bit Dell!  Thanks again!  You're a lifesaver!"
,mothekiller,2011-03-04T20:33Z,To : Ubehage please can you give me some really clear instruction on how to use this thing i put it in my pc press enter and press it the whole time but it keep repeating because it says keep pressing ENTER
[M],Ubehage,2011-03-31T18:18Z,"mothekiller:
It does that on a few selection of pc's.

What it's really doing, is telling you a lot of ""useless"" info about your computer.
The easiest way to get pass this, is to press SPACE. This will make it scroll 1 page. Just press SPACE a few times, untill you get pass this.

The next question asked by the program, does not react on SPACE. So you can't mess it up ;)"
,laggomundi,2011-04-03T01:33Z,"Fantastic utility, worked on first go with win7x64.
Many thanks to the uploader."
,demon1943,2011-05-15T00:50Z,how do you get it to save the password changes after you change it i can't get it to end and then when i turn off and back on it will only use the old password
,USA890789,2011-05-15T23:32Z,"I'm having the same problem as ""demon1943"". I do not know how to exit the program without shutting off the computer, and when it resumes the same old password is the same. No matter if i try to clear the password or change it"

,Rick98382,2011-05-28T22:33Z,Thanks for this download. I work on computers and many times can't log in to Windows and the owner can't remember the user passwords. This application works great! Saves me many hours of work. I just unlock the password file and delete the password. Then I save the changes by quitting and typing y to save the changes. Reboot and I'm in! Thank goodness for linux and this utility!
,Bdog67,2011-06-04T15:13Z,Works a charm thanks!
,mameroms,2011-06-20T18:49Z,"32bit only?

,stevethedeve,2011-10-08T03:15Z,As a computer technician you have no idea how many people bring in their computers and don't know their password to login to windows. This tool is wonderful but must be used with caution as pressing the wrong options could corrupt your system. Thanks for the upload!!

,mossdabosses,2011-11-13T08:52Z,"man, dude, you saved me 150 dollars from dell. the link that is in here for step by step works. i have windows 7 64. bit. download free iso burner, open the file with it and burn that on a cd. boot up your pc that is locked and boot from cd. press enter until shows the 2 drives. make sure u choose the largest hard drive, the other is backup and nothing happens but aggravation, lol. then when it gets to the 1st menu, press 1 for password reset. it will say what to do? edit user data or 1 again. some user names pop up. if you are the main or only user, type in owner. i kept hiting enter cause the default id administrator but thats a no no. next hit 1 for clear password. next its done but you hit the ! to quit the process cause the password is gone brother. then next hit q for quit. sorry each time you type in a letter you have to hit enter, i forgot. then its gonna ask if you wanna write back files, type y and enter if u dont it will not save. then it will say new run just hit enter. then ctrl alt delete and it restarts. if this is not plain enough then i tried to help. but i promise u this works and the rest dont cause i tried them all! thanks pirate bay and i love ubehage whoever u r!!!!!"
,mossdabosses,2011-11-13T09:08Z,"hey fwbfunguy, i had that problem. you're choosing the wrong drive. do it slowly you will see it gives you two choices. it tries to pick 1 for you but its the back up recovery drive. 2 should be the biggest drive which is what u want. this will get it for you. later"
,mossdabosses,2011-11-13T09:14Z,"fwbfunguy, i dont know if my last comment went to you. when it starts read it carefully it will show two drives to choose from. pick the biggest one if you pick the small one it will ask you for the path over and over. i know cause i went thru it and no one explained it to me. if u need anymore help, e-mail me at dboss_09@yahoo.com. later, dude."
,Matthewt1970,2012-01-17T18:51Z,Works good and it really fast. You must save at the end so it will write the data to the accounts. I believe it was ! and then it will prompt you to save and then you hit Y
,Ngoni,2012-02-09T13:45Z,still works like charm.. good job Ubehage
,mouchy,2012-06-24T17:58Z,"I've been trying to reset password on win7 Ultimate edition SP1 x86, I followed the instructions as to clear or change the password but it didnt work. so is there something i should do to make it work? I also wonder if it would work on 7 home basic edition x86.
