The First Basket takes a look at the early days of the
Basketball Association of America. When it was formed in
1946, the majority of players were Jewish - a fact that
certainly is not true of American basketball just 60 years
later. This film showcases how these athletes provided
inspiration for Jews suffering discrimination.
