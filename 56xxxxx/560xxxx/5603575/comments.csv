[V],poppedtart,2010-06-02T05:18Z,This is the Alternate Ending.  The DVDRip and PiZ are regular Cut.  The regular cut stops when the FBI agent walks out the door with the 2 children (then credits roll).  This version continues for 2 more minutes and leaves less to the imagination...
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-02T05:21Z,"sooo, if you want regular cut, press the stop button soon as the fbi agent walks out the door with the 2 children ;-) (at 1:35hr)"

,TKOG13,2010-06-02T22:14Z,"will you be upping this in the smaller (PSP, iPod, Zune) format?"
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-02T23:17Z,did already
,TKOG13,2010-06-02T23:31Z,I meant the extended version
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-03T00:30Z,"nah, this extended doesn't make it any better."
,TKOG13,2010-06-03T00:35Z,do you think you could up just the extra 2 mins as a separate file?
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-03T00:42Z,"no, what happens is they show the fbi agents finding a bomb, and then the screen pans to show another hidden bomb with a counter running on it.  thats it.

on the normal version they leave it to your imagination if there was a 4th bomb or not and it ends sort of on a more happy note.

[V],poppedtart,2010-06-03T00:43Z,"on the DVD its called alternate ending, alternate doesn't necessarily mean good.  think of I am legend, i thought the alternate ending was lame."
,TKOG13,2010-06-03T01:36Z,well thanks anyway
