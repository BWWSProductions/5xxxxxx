thanks
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T21:31Z,"Well, it's rarity, especially in this format. Besides, one asked me to find this collection and encode in 720p. Some shorties are filmed in 16/9 TV aspect, hence couple of 360p mixed in.

If you're unsure, maybe you should download one movie only at first, to see if that is your cup of tea."
,lilars26,2010-05-31T22:03Z,Sorry about that.I didn't realize it was initial seeding so I jumped out.
,htctouch,2010-06-01T03:03Z,NICE RELEASE MAN . LOOKS INTERESTING . THANX ALOT .
,jjabrams,2010-06-01T03:13Z,"yes a real rarity - any chance you have: wong kar wai - fallen angels or john woo's the killer and upload?

more classic movies should be uploaded while tv is in between seasons

thanks"
,fourty80,2010-06-01T04:53Z,superb...........like this bmw movies.....john woo is the best....
,manoharpandey,2010-06-01T07:12Z,"U r the biggest and so ar the best Uploader when it comes to Tv shows, so I thought it the most appropriate to request u to upload all episodes of Monk in any format feasible for u. Will be grateful..............."
,kanha,2010-06-01T10:19Z,"Thankx 20-40, for accepting my request.....

[T],houruoha,2010-06-01T14:06Z,"downloaded 300mb
uploaded 600mb

hehhehe
:)"
,lilars26,2010-06-01T17:47Z,"@houruoha
It's not your connection.Lots of hit and runs I think.It should speed up as more kindly people get 100%.

Thank you 20/40."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-01T20:26Z,"@houruoha : It's constant problem. 98% of peers. without any doubts, without any questions (I have statistics for each torrent) - are - pure and simple - in true ""leeching"" mode. 
Here comes ONLY 24-27 normal people, and  I bet that you know all of them by their screen-names.
These are only seeders we and I have constantly - and that's the reason why my torrents dies within days, one week top.

People-leeches want light-speeds - but when it comes to ""how-much-they-give"" - answer is - crumbs, almost nothing. They (98% is devastating percentage) keep DL speed on unlimited and UL on 1, 3 or up to 10 kB/s, but ready to bitch about  ""how slow download is"".
Well, almost whole ""speed"" comes from the exchange between the peers - not from me.
What people obviously cannot understand is that torrents are no JUST for download, but for SHARE.

I suggest you, here, now and always in the same situation, that you set your UL speed at bare minimum, finish what you've started and simply - unload the torrent. Say bye-bye to pricks and punks and leeches couldn't survive too long. Such ""people"" would suck that minimum from each other and probably stay stuck at some percentage. And - I will delete such torrent anyway. "
,Demise69,2010-06-02T04:52Z,"Hey broda ... 

this is till season 2 episode 3 .. What abou the rest ? "
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-02T08:12Z,@Demise69: Ask Bee-Emm-Double-Vee. Maybe they have the answer.
,jjabrams,2010-06-02T13:23Z,"well since its not a mainstream torrent, it cant be expected that there will be too much seeders. but yes it was slow - well at least i tried - uploaded 2gb.

the wkw one was the best imo"
,sdcheeran,2010-06-03T07:42Z,"i will seed this file forever because its not well known where i'm from, and its some of the best car-chase sequnces ever filmed"
,bagpipegml,2011-08-12T18:21Z,"Thanks!  Just saw an ad for this in a 10 year old Ghost Rider comic.  I remember when BMW had split one of the stories up as commercials on TV, but never knew it was a collection.  Very hard to find.  Thanks again!!!"
