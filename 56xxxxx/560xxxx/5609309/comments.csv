,D07792,2010-06-06T02:14Z,"Hi,

Please share ""A.Bit.Of.Tom.Jones.2009.H264[quark]"" for some time. I m stuck at 94.6%. Help. 

Thanks."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-06T07:30Z,"@valu59er: TPB script that should pick up the number of seeders malfunction. It is also one of the oldest tricks used to make some torrents UNPOPULAR.
Who, in the right mind, would load some torrent that shows 0 SEEDERS and 0 downloaders? No one. People load torrents from uploaders where stands 1000 seeders, right?
So, I have 27 seeders right now and right here.
TPB shows ZERO last 11 hours.
It happens all the time and I have right to be ""paranoid"" about in light of recent events where my account was hacked three weekends in row.

@D07792: I practically haven't stopped to seed from day one, breaks were in accordance with announced seeding timing in the torrent description itself. Maybe, for some reason, you cannot connect to me directly and no one else has that file. Best way in such case is to open some junk-mail account and drop address right here. I'll see then why is that and get you back.
You use uTorrent, a new one, right? If not, get the one first."
,yiscool,2010-06-06T08:35Z,"Thankx 2040, will seed it as much as possibe (my isp just doubled my speed \m/)..

I knw u said no more requests this week but i have  a general request.. 
plz consider encoding PRISON BREAK series from season 1.. Its 1 of the best series ever.. "
,yiscool,2010-06-06T08:39Z,"And ya 2040 since u have been helping me and other people for so long, i will like to give u premium rs accounts (hacked).. tell me how to send u if u want them"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-06T10:16Z,"@yiscool: My sis and nephew were crazy about Prison Break, especially when our national TV station stopped to air seasons after (I don't remember exactly) the second one. I have downloaded all episodes and handed them over. After the PB has ended, I downloaded and burned all seasons as XviD DVD rips and gave them complete collection. But - back then - I never have succeeded to get any substantial interest for my encoding, interest was very, very weak - I managed to have 20+ seeders top and in the same time eztv have 2500 seeders (it was mega-popular show back then).
Were my encodings so bad in those days? Nope. I haven't change [micro] format even for a bit, it's good, nice and - small (199 MB) XviD encoding - something that some people never accepted well.
Nothing has changed today.
Bigger IS better, right? If someone offers 4.37 GIGA per one episode - he would have 100 times more seeders than me.
Therefore, I beg you to understand my  ""No more requests"" saying. I left that decision on my discretion alone.
And - I have not neither technical possibilities for encoding seasons of past TV shows nor upload capabilities for that. I am afraid also that my time is running out.

PS: I am on Facebook (my e-mail address)."
,yiscool,2010-06-06T11:35Z,"I totally understand ur points.. I am not telling u to encode it now but plz do keep pb in meind when u have got extra time with u. as long as ur popularity is concerned, i had tried earlier to increase it by posting in forums and groups and explaining them that u can get quality in a 300mb movie also . I will try my best to again start posting about ur torents everywhere.
Give me ur facebook link then"
,D07792,2010-06-06T12:12Z,"@2040

I'm using BitTorrent 6.4. Just 3mb left to complete. VLC is not able to play. I will create an email account in the evening today. 

I tried uTorrent 2.0.2 but it is not giving stable performance as download rate fluctuates too much. S0 i downgraded"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-06T13:01Z,"@D07792: Listen: uTorrent 2.0 and BitTorrent are - absolutely same (just named differently). Therefore, only differences could be the settings.
Pardon - not  ""could "" but - are.
So, check the text from my answer I gave yesterday to sdcheeran on Stargate and maybe you can dig something out.

@yiscool: Please, do not ""advertise"" my torrents. Give them (where to get them) as advice only to people you are sure about. I have no energy nor time too handle or tolerate predominantly ""grabbing"" behavior of newcomers. I repeat word-for-word few things last couple of years and - it makes me sick in stomach and - stupid. It's already too late for ""spreading the word"" after all these years.
PS. I practically gave you my e-mail. If you can find me (and hundredths have done that before) I would be sure that you meant it."
,lilars26,2010-06-06T15:15Z,"Thanks 20/40.I was waiting for seeders

,sdcheeran,2010-06-06T16:47Z,"i changed my settings according to 20/40's steps on recent stargate page, and both my downloads&uploads are now 10-20kbps higher (using latest bittorrent) my whole file-sharing experience has changed!"
