,HalcyonJedi,2010-06-03T09:04Z,"I've downloaded this video 4 times now, and none of them have audio - any ideas how to fix?"
,ipop,2010-06-07T16:04Z,Same problem here.  I downloaded this version and no audio.  Tried several media players and even converted to DVD with Convert X and still no dice.  I would love to find a good version of this scene.
,HalcyonJedi,2010-06-08T04:52Z,Same here ipop - I converted it to every possible format using WinAVI 9 and no dice on the audio... would love to find a working version as well
,ipop,2010-06-08T18:38Z,Makes you wonder why people are still downloading it when the comments say no audio.
,HalcyonJedi,2010-06-09T00:31Z,"If you find a working one ipop, let me know. I signed up for the $1 3-day trial on the site just to get that video and it wasn't available :(  lol  But I got a bunch more out of the deal, so I'm willing to swap if you find one "
,HalcyonJedi,2010-06-12T05:04Z,beta2008x - do you know of any copies of this scene that have working audio?
