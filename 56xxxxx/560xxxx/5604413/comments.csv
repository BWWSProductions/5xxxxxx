[V],pluto999,2010-06-03T09:33Z,@BOZX : firstly cause of x264 codec then reducing a lot things but normal users wouldn't understand it cause its pretty good for a 400-600mb copy..
[V],pluto999,2010-06-03T09:34Z,@BOZX : if you were asking how am i doing? I'm doing good.. ty..how are ya doing?

[V],BOZX,2010-06-03T12:16Z,"i know it totally depends on the encoder how he encodes. i have sen 700 MB BDRips worse than those dvd rips. well its all your magic.

Alas when did i complained of any encode , did i?
i ws just asking of curiosity ...
well me too fine to be good."
[V],pluto999,2010-06-03T12:25Z,"@BOZX : i never said that you are complaining.. Yeah there are a lot BDrips worse than dvdrips you are right about that..

anyway the answer for the part which country am i from..well lemme give you a hint,

The national anthem of my country was written by the same man who wrote the national anthem for another country too.. He declined the knighthood in protest of a massacre in 1919.. If you know the answer comment here else .. I'll let you know.. :)"

,goffyoflegend,2010-06-03T19:17Z,"how the fuck do you get such high quality into such a small file? its not perfect (i watched it on a 42"") but its way better than i expected. better than dvd quality at least. slight issues on some lines but that may be the player (km player,havent tried it with vlc or wmp yet) but i cant knock it for the size. so i guess i owe you an apology pluto999. A9/V9"
