I present to you...the worst movie...in the world...

A movie without any cinematographers
A movie with cameramen that can't record dialogue in crowds
A movie with no discernable script
A movie with a wall with more screen time than many of the characters
A movie with some of most gratuitous, yet awful, awkward and pointless, nudity I have ever seen.
A movie that Joel Hodgson should have riffed on
A movie that spent 2/3rds of its budget on an original music composition, which was then spent on Salvia presumably
A movie that can't even make its extras give a shit
A movie that faithfully adapted a book that was incomprehensible to read
A movie with more continuity errors than Lost
