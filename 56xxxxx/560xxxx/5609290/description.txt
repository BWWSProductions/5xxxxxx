AFTER CUTTING AND PASTING AND SYNCING PARTS OF TWO DOWNLOADS OF THIS, ONE BEING BULLDOZER'S "DVDRIP" WHICH WAS SCREWED ON THE END OF IT WHICH MAKES ME WONDER IF IT WAS A DVDRIP AND NOT A R5. ANYWAY, CUT THE LAST SEQUENCE OFF AND REPLACED IT WITH THE END SEQUENCE FROM RX'S SCR COPY. RESULT? A VIRTUALLY PERFECT COPY OF THIS MOVIE. ENJOY!!

A psychological thriller centered around a black-ops interrogator and an FBI agent who press a suspect terrorist into divulging the location of three nuclear weapons sets to detonate in the U.S.
