Uncut version. Originally shot as â€œThe Hollywood Strangler,â€ DONâ€™T ANSWER THE PHONE (a title which has little to do with the actual story, but insisted upon by distributor Crown International) is very misogynistic lowbrow sleaze thatâ€™s definitely not recommended for the average viewer (Leonard Maltinâ€™s Movie Guide says â€œDonâ€™t watch this movie!â€).

Plot Synopsis
A Vietnam veteran/photographer terrorizes Los Angeles by going around strangling young women in their homes while taunting psychologist Lindsay Gale by calling her radio call-in show to describe his misogynistic ways. Meanwhile, the police detectives are close behind the psycho hoping he'll slip up and make a mistake.
