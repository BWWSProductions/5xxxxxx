DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!"
,axo666,2011-03-14T17:22Z,"First, no virus in there (at least my antivir finds nothing, although i did'nt dl the first one).
image quality is good, even for the small size of some files.
BUT:
tcm2: wrong aspect ratio. credits cut.
tcm3: wrong aspect ratio. end titles cut. obviously a tvrip (29fps). probably badly cut as it's only 73 minutes long.
the next generation: wrong aspect ratio. cropped. end titles cut. definitely not the uncut version.
tcm 2003 is okay. 94 minutes, but it's PAL (25 fps), that equals 98 minutes at 24 fps.
tcm beginning is okay, it's the unrated version."
