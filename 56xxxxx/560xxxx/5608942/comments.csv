[V],twentyforty,2010-06-05T15:52Z,"Hi lilars. Just as I did this morning. Your last comment on ""Waterworld"" inspired my lil' diatribe there.

@houruoha: As first goes 500MB Shes.Out.Of.My.League.2010.720p.H264.mp4, because I like that one. ""Remember"" I have ""on stash"", and should be encoded during the following night (6 hours for one bluray)... If you have specific wish regarding the format (272,360, 480 or 720p) let me know BEFORE I start actual encoding."

Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
