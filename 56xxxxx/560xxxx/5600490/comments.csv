,Porkster,2010-06-01T10:41Z,Shivers I thought this might be a good torrent.  Another global-warming tripe release.  Please share relevant material.
[T],metalcore.,2010-06-02T01:04Z,"are you retarded? you didnt even watch the documentary clearly because its only slightly about global warming, in that ""clean coal"" technology is a bullshit lie, they just no longer burn the pollution intsead they just dump it into (sometimes covering completely )local rivers, lakes, and streams. 

it is about the environmental consequences of using poor mining practices, that the mining companies' coporate social responsibility is NOT being met, and that lobbying for a further reliance on coal is stupid, money should be put into alternate technologies. 

the global warming issue is secondary here to the direct consequences the poor people that have been living in the appalachians are being subject to....lives being put at risk, land flooded becuase the mountaintops have been destroyed and forests removes etc

get a fucking clue you ignorant faggot.

what are you a coal lobbyist or something? "
