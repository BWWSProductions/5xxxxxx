,jomsjoms,2010-06-09T05:00Z,"If i have the original Rybka4 Chessbase program, how do i use this ""Deep Rybka 4""? Will it make my Original Rybka4 invalid if I use the Deep Rybka engine?

Can you kindly tell me the steps one by one on how to use this as I am not that good in instructions =)"
,jomsjoms,2010-06-09T05:22Z,"There are 4 files:

Deep Rybka 4 SSE42 w32.exe
Deep Rybka 4 SSE42 x64.exe
Deep Rybka 4 w32.exe
Deep Rybka 4 x64.exe

What is SSE42 ???"
,pelle1953,2010-06-12T01:58Z,"Thank You very much.

You can run the SEE42 versions if you have the POPCNT instruction in your processor. They are about 5% faster."

,CubanNuke,2011-03-02T04:34Z,"Please explain how I install it. I double clicked on ""Deep Rybka 4 SSE42 w32.exe"" and nothing happened. I double clicked on ""Deep Rybka 4 w32.exe"" and a blank command box-- nothing else. Please help; thank you."
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2011-03-25T03:00Z,"CubanNuke you must install using a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that accepts UCI chess engines. For example Shredder UCI, Fritz/Junior/Shredder/Hiarcs, Arena, Aquarium, Chessbase, Chess Assistant, Chess Partner, or Tarrasch. Each GUI comes with its own instructions re how to install UCI engines."
