"Slight of Hand"

When Rachel Conroy mysteriously vanishes, an eerie cloud 
settles over Haplin, as clues point to the return of the 
elusive Magic Man. Surprisingly, Tommy finds an unlikely 
ally while desperately searching for his wife. Meanwhile 
Handsome Dan announces he has to leave Haplin, then 
unexpectedly turns up elsewhere. Henley manages to get 
her stolen property back from Greggy Stiviletto and uses 
it to blackmail a member of Haplin's powerful "first" 
family. Finally, Tommy investigates some gruesome 
evidence that ironically could mean good news for many 
of Haplin's families.

Enjoy :)
