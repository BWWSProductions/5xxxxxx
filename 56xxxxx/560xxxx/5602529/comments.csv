,kathykat63,2010-07-19T16:06Z,"I want The Bible first!!  Just looked and The Bible is less than 25mb in PDF.  I am still tying up the computer waiting on over 4g torrent.  I could read a bit of The Bible waiting for copies of Window 7 and XP being offered to me.  I am afraid to just delete The Bible and go to Hell for it.  Never know, I might learn something, like showing respect for the beliefs of another.  And aaarrrr, make sure The Bible is in ePub format so that I can just load it right on the brand new iPad.  Or should I be saying thank you to aaarrr?  Oh well, look it up in the 25mb Bible while I'm waiting on Windows 7 and XP. +"
