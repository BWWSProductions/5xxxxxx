     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Muriel Gray tells the story of the Glasgow Boys, the group
      of late 19th century painters who put Glasgow on the art world
      map. Focusing mainly on just four of the Boys - John Lavery,
      James Guthrie, George Henry and EA Hornel - she examines their
      masterpieces in detail and charts their shifting friendships.
      Following in the Boys' footsteps, Muriel travels through
      Scotland and northern France to uncover the sources of their
      inspiration and show just how radical their paintings were.
