Community biography from

Born in Paisley, Scotland, Gerry Rafferty is best known for his work with 70s folk-rock band Stealers Wheel. One song in particular is well-known across the generations: "Stuck In The Middle With You" sold over a million copies in 1973, and was then famously used in Quentin Tarantino's hit 90s film Reservoir Dogs. Before Stealers Wheel, Rafferty was in a band called the Humblebums who were reasonably successful in Britain and were led by Billy Connolly, who went on to become an international star as a stand-up comedian.

As well as his work with the Humblebums and Stealers Wheel, Rafferty had a solo career encompassing nine albums between 1971 and 2000. Again, there is one song for which his solo career is especially known: "Baker Street" was a worldwide hit in 1978 and includes one of the most famous saxophone solos in modern pop. The album on which it featured, City to City, went on to sell nearly six million copies. But Rafferty's reluctance to tour meant his fame gradually waned and his later albums were largely ignored.
