As stated above, these rips are sourced from the Anthem Pictures R1 DVD releases 
(though the DVDs are obviously themselves sourced from VHS, you can see a noise 
bar at the bottom throughout the videos). From what I've heard, however, these 
DVD releases are inexplicably significantly different from the original Wavelength 
Video VHS releases of this series. Scenes have apparently been taken out, rearranged, and otherwise modified.
