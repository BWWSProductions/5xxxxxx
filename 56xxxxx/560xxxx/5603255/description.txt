Ron and Fez XM/Sirius Best of show commercial-free uncensored 96k mp3 
Rip&Edit by mg56

First 96k R&F upload. Barring any serious protests, you're 
getting stereo 96k R&F from here on out. Adds minimal encoding 
time, and really helps with the music that the show plays. 
Everything I upload will be in stereo 128k/96k mp3 except for 
Norton's show as Raw Dog comedy is compressed beyond belief. 

I will get the Unmasked episodes from XM202 rather that 150
for the above reasons. I cannot promise timely ups on the weekend
content but it shouldn't be as bad as this past one.
