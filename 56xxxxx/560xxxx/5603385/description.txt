Nikolai (Dolph Lundgren) is a Spetsnaz-a Soviet agent par excellence trained in deep 

undercover work. Assigned to infiltrate and squelch a rebel African uprising, 

Nikolai unexpectedly finds himself drawn to the guerillas' cause, a betrayal that 

enrages his Russian superiors, who order his immediate termination. Making his 

escape through the harsh desert in the company of an adversarial American journalist 

(M. Emmet Walsh), Nikolai allies himself with a tribe of rebel bushmen, his 

fierceness in combat earning him the nickname "Red Scorpion." Nikolai's new-found 

independance climaxes in his leadership of the rebels against his former comrades, 

storming their headquarters in a lethal, no-quarter showdown.
