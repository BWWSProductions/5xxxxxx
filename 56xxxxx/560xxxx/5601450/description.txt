Though the 1960s and early-'70s U.K. blues and boogie band the Groundhogs never achieved widespread fame, this best-of shows them to be a solidly rocking outfit most at home with workmanlike interpretations of the urban blues of Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. A lean three-piece who concentrated more on feel and groove than their jazzier contemporaries Cream, the Groundhogs' evolution into one of the many sociallyand politically aware bands of the era is documented here on cuts such as the psychedelic-sounding "Strange Town" and the prog-rock "Rich Man, Poor Man". "Earth Is Not Room Enough" is a fine example of eccentric '60s boogie, and the always-stirring "Amazing Grace" features the band's much-lauded guitarist Tony McPhee at his most expressive.
