[V],twentyforty,2010-06-01T09:44Z,"@manoharpandey: Till maybe four months ago I have upped last Season, also on request. Month ago I deleted all Monk torrent 'cause they have been ""dead"". And - I do not have upload capabilities for such big torrent (probably 30+ GB ). In fact, no one who regularly use my torrents, is able to download such multi-Giga-packs.
However, all Seasons of Monk are available on zillion places - for direct-download. All are DVDrips, quality is very good (I have them all) and I suggest you to Google, get familiar with jdownloader and divide the timing and pace of downloads according to your budget.

@Stev: Remember, I do not know is the title protected at all. If the title is free of Cinavia, we would get false-positive. Someone must download other R5 to verify - or not."
