[T],PeteSapai,2010-07-04T16:13Z,"Not trying to offend you, but I must say I'm not very impressed with the quality, partially because your source (which, btw, wasnt HD, the source for that source was) was already very compressed and re-ecoding low/medium quality to ~half its size can't be that great. Compared to, for example, HIMYM.S01.DVDRip.XviD-TOPAZ, the video contains more blocks, is less colorful and a bit too bright. The audio quality is too low (re-encoding mp3 to 112kbps cbr mp3 is a bad idea).
Anyway, I'm a bit of a HQ freak, so many people might find these eps very watchable, but I suggest using an actual HD (720p or higher) source next time.
Nevertheless, I appreciate your effort and seeding! (And if people don't agree with me, good for them :))"
,dexdrex007,2010-07-19T03:35Z,"Special request PLS can you upload ur tv series season by season? not the complete pack? Just like RidderA is doing, no offense bro. Thanx in advance"
,deathbymiltank,2010-07-24T06:42Z,"@dexdrex007

You know, in your BitTorrent or whatever you use, you can just deselect the seasons you don't want before you start the download."

I'm not using an ordinary torrent application. It's only a Special request to YIFY "
,wira020,2010-07-27T20:14Z,"Need.. more... seeds... been downloading for a week just for season 4 and only been at 30%..  btw, if this is uploaded by season, i think it'd be easier because other unwanted file wont be downloaded.. i used uTorrent and skipped other files but it still download some bits of other unwanted file.. and i think it's be easier to see the actual seeder and leecher for the particular season... just my opinion, thanks for your hardwork YIFY!! will comment on quality after finish dl.."
,yjcool,2010-07-29T20:58Z,"YIFY , ure awesome..!!! can you do FRIENDS..!!!"
,yjcool,2010-07-29T21:00Z,YIFY great...why dont you go for FRIENDS....the great
,bibiboo,2010-08-04T09:40Z,yeah. Friends is really good. Thanks you so much. 
,wira020,2010-08-06T17:35Z,"You're doing Friends? AWESOME!!! That would be Legend- wait for it - dary!! LEGENDARY!!... I hope you'll split it by season.. It's a bit of a mess trying to download 5 season at once like HIMY... couldnt know how much seeder/leechers for a particular season.. I know we can skip files, but it's comforting to me to know a particular season have a lot of seed for better speed... Just my 2 cents :P... 

About quality of this upload ( I downloaded last 2 from season 3, season 4 and season 5), I cant say I'm very impressed, I understand that you had to use different sources, so I think the defect is just your sources fault ;P... so most are pretty good, there's a few ( 1 or 2 in season 4 i think ) has audio sync problem... a few are too bright.. 

All in all, I'm happy that at less than 100MB, it's very watchable and you made it possible for me to download it in a logical time.. Thanks for all your hardwork, I've bookmarked your upload list page.. "
,moviz247,2010-08-11T15:03Z,"Can u plz upload the constantine in 720p ..

,DoaKao,2011-03-13T01:39Z,"Please don't mux swedish subs into the files.. Unnecessary. Still, a good torrent.

But don't mux. Really."
,piratebay,2011-03-29T03:02Z,"@joeyparsons

Try using AutoMKV for ripping files to mkv. Its a bit advanced, but a lot of tutorials are available on the internet.

As for the video size, open the video file in media player classic and hit shift+f10. A new window will open up. Go to the Details tab. The resolution will be there."
,RDawgg,2011-04-04T23:00Z,"You know,a folder with a sample from every season would've been nice...now I've gotta download an episode from each season so I can decide whether I wanna download them all or not..."

Try AutoMKV. Its one of the better softwares available on the internet. It might be a bit advanced, but a lot of tutorials are available. A simple google search will get you the tutorials.

And thanks for the torrent. :D"
