,LH-oswald,2010-06-05T11:57Z,this feel free rip has already been deleted once from here cause of bad audio
,bordrx,2010-06-05T18:18Z,"audio is fine, you 're probably missing some codecs

Video is very pixelated at times, for example during the hokey game yfrog to ccvlcsnap2010060502h57m31p for a screenshot

get the MAX release available on TPB, video is much better encoded"
