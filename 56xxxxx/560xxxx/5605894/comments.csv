[T],Sunblock.,2010-06-03T18:11Z,"Hard Drive Tutorial: 

Just copy them to

""Partition 3\Content\0000000000000000\FFFE07D1\00030000""

USB Tutorial:

1.Prepare usb drive in xbox (i hope you do it for now)
2.Run program USBXTAFGUI and click open device, if it is not opening something is wrong with drive or you did not do it right try to reconfigure usb again in xbox
3.if the usb is empty folder 000... will not exist and you need to create with option new foder and name it 00000..
4.create in this folder FFFE07D1
5.create 00030000 and here injet files
6. if you try to create Content\0000000000000000\FFFE07D1\00030000 on pc desktop and inject all folders program may crash.
7.note : you dont need to create ""partition"" folder that is ford hard drives not usb drives
so create all this folders in program and in the last just inject files it will work
and answer to your question is that program is opening usb drive not pc hard drive because the usb is protected afther configuring in your xbox"

,ServerModerator,2010-06-04T06:27Z,Thanks!
,duel3000,2010-06-06T19:25Z,"Works great once I figured it out. For those who had trouble like me, prepare the USB Drive in the 360, then move one of the themes you already have from the 360 HD to the USB. Plug into the comp, open up USBXTAFGUI, open Device and click through the 0. [dir] folder that keeps showing up until you can't go any deeper. Inject the themes in here. Plug into 360 and they should show up in the system menu under Memory. Move themes to the 360 HD and activate them. 

Thanks heaps for the themes."
,EnVyMoNtOyA,2010-06-08T16:36Z,"Yea it works great thank you Sunblock! i use the instructions that DUEL3000 gave above and it was a piece of cake.

 the only problem I'm having though is in the friends section the premium themes don't work there but as for the dashboard they all work and even change when you open other areas.

so am i doing something wrong? I'm getting the generic friends theme with the ugly white and green Xbox360 logos around my friends =\ can someone help me out?"

,oempaloempatest,2010-08-22T23:00Z,"I can't open the files inside the rar, they have no extension.
7zip, winrar and izarc all can't open them.
Giving them extensions as .zip or .rar din't help either.

Putting the themes on my xbox is no problem, i;ve done that before, i just need the files themself."
