"Partition 3Content 000000000000000FFFE07D1 0030000"

USB Tutorial:

1.Prepare usb drive in xbox (i hope you do it for now)
2.Run program USBXTAFGUI and click open device, if it is not opening something is wrong with drive or you did not do it right try to reconfigure usb again in xbox
3.if the usb is empty folder 000... will not exist and you need to create with option new foder and name it 00000..
4.create in this folder FFFE07D1
5.create 00030000 and here injet files
6. if you try to create Content 000000000000000FFFE07D1 0030000 on pc desktop and inject all folders program may crash.
7.note : you dont need to create "partition" folder that is ford hard drives not usb drives
so create all this folders in program and in the last just inject files it will work
and answer to your question is that program is opening usb drive not pc hard drive because the usb is protected afther configuring in your xbox
