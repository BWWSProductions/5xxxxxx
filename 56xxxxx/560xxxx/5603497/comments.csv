,Zarod,2010-06-18T06:45Z,"I dunno what happened, but when I got it, there was absolutely no audio.  So I demuxed the audio, and it was mute, as if it wasn't even added or it was muted during encoding...something.  So either it was encoded wrong or I just somehow got a bad copy.  So I'm getting another copy from here to see what happens: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5617237/Kick_ass_2010_-_1_4DvdRip_-_XviD_-_Subs_-_NL_-_English_-_Interna"
,cormar31,2010-06-18T11:27Z,"wtf is this ? no video , no audio , no subs , when i try to open the file/subs."
,Zarod,2010-06-19T01:58Z,"Ok, so I got the audio working.  I redownloaded the file, but there was still no audio.  I had to remux the bloody thing as there was something in the original encoding causing the audio not to play."
,sayfu,2010-06-20T02:06Z,"For u guys havin a problem like ""file doesn't wanna play"" the problem is the name of the folder is too long. So all u need to do is to change it when u open the torrent with utorrent for example.
