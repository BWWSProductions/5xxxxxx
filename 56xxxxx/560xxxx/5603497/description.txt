Proper Notes
Some people STILL didn't deinterlace correctly. Again.
Also one particular so-and-so thinks he knows everything about
A/R. The PROPER aspect ratio is 2.29 on this source. NOT 
2.19 aka 632 x 288...which is ABSOLUTELY WRONG. Idiot.
Someone PLEASE give him a brain, because no matter how many times
he looks at cheap rip, he still can't understand anything.


Yes, I did fix the subs english and dutch are added, the good news is subs are not hard encoded....



you don't what a different is about a cam release??? A cam release is record from cinema bad Quality! not orignal from DVD.
A DVD-screener is not a real proper bad sound and picture. not from orignal DVD but a other copy of company.
There is still no any proper totally 25.000 framerate is wrong!
29.976 is asshole, 25.000 for newbies, 23,976 for profenist.
