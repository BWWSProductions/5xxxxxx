SYNOPSIS

It's 10 PM. The night before Walnut Lake's neighborhood supermarket closes
its doors forever. The owners and night crew have a long shift ahead of them
longer than they think! Ace check-out girl, Jennifer played by "Lethal
Weapon's" Renee Estevez), has a deranged ex-boyfriend who's fresh out of
prison. When he appears outside, weird things start happening. The phone
lines are cut, and the night crew starts dying... one by one, in the most
gruesome ways imaginable

An ex-cop is trying to find out who the killer is and what possessed
him to start the bloody rampage. But is it the ex-boyfriend or someone else?
