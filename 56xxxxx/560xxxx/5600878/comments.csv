Thats right the entire movie is broken down into chapters. Seriously couldnt believe it when I opened the folder."

,waxstax,2012-06-03T08:43Z,and by the way you guys who don't know what you're talking about need to stop spreading bullshit and trying to scare people away.  You are idiots and don't deserve to have these movies
