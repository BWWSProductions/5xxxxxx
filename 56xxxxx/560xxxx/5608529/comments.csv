  The only other ""unknown"" movie I have with Graham Greene is ""Medicine River"", but I did the rip a long time ago. The resolution is small (336x224) and the framerate hasn't been IVTCed (29.97), it si Xvid-MP3 encoded - I just don't think the quality is worthy of a torrent.
  It's a pretty good TV movie; If I can ever dig up a VHS copy of it again, I'll re-rip it with my new gear."
