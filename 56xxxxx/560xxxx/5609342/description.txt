Mali Blue is a godsend for the budget-conscious world music fans out there, collecting 14 tracks from Lobi Traore's four out-of-print or import albums released between 1991 and 1998. As is the case with his mentor Ali Farka Toure (who produces and appears on several tracks), Traore fuses warm conversational singing and hypnotic blues guitar to the traditional Bambara sounds of djembi, tamani and n'goni. The connection between the two cultures is particularly potent on the songs featuring harmonica player Vincent Butcher, whose strong grasp of the blues lexicon expands the dynamic reach of these riff-oriented tunes. Nonetheless, even without the harmonica, Traore does excellent job on his own, moving from stripped down guitar and voice ("Warani") to electric blues ("Ni Tougou La Mogo Miko") to more Africanized sounds ("Sadiourou"), leaving listeners with a well-rounded sense of who this singer/guitarist is. Truly a fine introduction (or reintroduction) to an artist deserving wider recognition.
