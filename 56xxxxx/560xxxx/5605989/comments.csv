Rip is from the US version BD, not French.
Higher video bitrate.

Stop being an arse."
,bharatrn,2010-06-04T09:54Z,Can you please confirm if the US and European versions have the same subs?
[T],Robston,2010-06-04T10:47Z,"Hi bharatrn,
Sorry, I don't have the French version so can't make a comparison. Can't find any mention/complaints of the subs on any reviews either. "
,bharatrn,2010-06-04T11:08Z,"The European bluray version and the dvdscr hardsubs are different.
I prefer the dvdscr subs, but I'm not able to find it anywhere to sync with my 720p rip. My brother has been working on it and has completed about 15 minutes. It's really a tiresome work.
Please,Just tell me what the first line of movie is?

Take these handcuffs off!
or
Take off these cuffs!

Thank you."
[T],Robston,2010-06-05T10:19Z,"Hi Bharatrn,
The full subtitles can now be found at http://subscene.com/english/A-Prophet-Un-prophte/subtitle-336920.aspx.
The first lines are...

- Take these handcuffs off!
- Think you can shut me up?
- Go fuck yourself!
Take off these handcuffs, faggot!

Is that good news or bad?
Cheers
Rob"
,bharatrn,2010-06-05T14:33Z,"That is wonderful news.
Thank you very much."
,bharatrn,2010-06-05T14:46Z,"For anybody wanting to sync the subs with the French version..
Frame rate of French version - 24 as opposed to   23 976 of this release.
And there's a 1 second delay.
Thanks again for the subtitles."
,0bvious,2010-10-26T10:32Z,"I edited the subtitles above, changing frame-rate to 24fps and moving them back 1 second. Here you go: http://subscene.com/english/A-Prophet-Un-prophte/subtitle-376558.aspx"
