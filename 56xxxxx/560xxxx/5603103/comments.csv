,shango,2010-06-01T19:38Z,This movie goes well with the trip which I just upped.  electra glide in blue is next which is imo a  companion to easy rider.

I hope it was caused by downloading it on a half gig loptop.  But I love the Clarity. Tried to download a version of 2 700meg files but quality was very poor. Keep up the good work!"
