A Plum In The Syrup
by Daniel Herzner

This book has been very carefully written based on the authors 20+ years of general business and entrepreneurial experience. What makes this book different is it does not provide a road map to success. It is not just another â€˜how toâ€™ book. This book recognizes your unique individuality and provides truths, suggestions and observations you can use to become successful however you might define the word â€™successâ€™ for yourself.
