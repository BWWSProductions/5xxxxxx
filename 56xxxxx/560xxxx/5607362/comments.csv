,hameerabbasi,2010-06-05T10:26Z,"Hello stevecam,
My internet collection is a bit slow and that's why I haven't been able to completely seed this yet, I'm the only seeder yet. It'll be done in at most 7 hours (yea i know, sucking internet), then, hopefully, it'll have many seeders. Cheers,

,GrampaD26354,2011-10-24T01:59Z,"...people, if you want download speed to improve, forget the seeding nagging. Nobody will seed. The way to increase download speed is to setup an account on a seedbox on one of the big seedbox vendors, then place your torrent there."
