This is our album from 2009.  Thanks for listening.  


"Way to Go Einstein is a five-piece modern rock band from Vancouver, Canada, who have recently released their second LP, Pseudonym, under Submerged Records.  This second self-produced album was recorded over a period of eight months at the bandâ€™s studios in New Westminster, Burnaby, and at The Hive Creative Labs.  The band, originally composed of members Andrew and Kevin, completed its line-up in early 2007. Each member comes from his own separate musical background, making for an eclectic mix of ambient and at times heavy guitars, melodic vocals and piano, synthesizers, hypnotic bass lines, and creative rhythms.  In the last few months they have been playing around the Vancouver scene and working on bringing the intensity of the new album to a live setting. Building on the buzz of their first release, Hide and Seek Champion, the second album promises to bring much more attention, stimulated ears, moved souls, and ironic band-name-loving fans."

â€œSinger Andrew Carterâ€™s melodies soar to the heavens, and are backed by lush beds of reverb treated guitars and synthesizers. Itâ€™s a gorgeous sound.â€ (the Georgia Straight)
