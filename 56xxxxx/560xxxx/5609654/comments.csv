,TheT3chGuy,2010-06-06T23:52Z,didnt work on my 1001 with 5.00 m33-6. just froze my screen black and I had to remove the battery to kill it. 
,chiruscan,2010-06-07T03:12Z,Seems to work ok except the enemies dont have voices when you interrogate them.
,chiruscan,2010-06-07T04:31Z,^^^^You need the Gen D2 pegasus.prx 
,drjft,2010-06-07T23:41Z,Does this work on an emulator?
,topherisher,2010-06-08T01:36Z,I got gen d3 is this game can play with out  khhbs file?
,vandius,2010-06-08T02:52Z,im having a problem i have given this torrent to a few people but none of them can get to chapter 2 because the game crashes every time we try you can play through the fist chapter but as soon as to load the first mission of chapter 2 it crashes
,omgdetejag,2010-06-08T22:11Z,"Hey guys...
I have never attempted to use any network features for my psp since I flashed it. Now, It's not every day a great game is released with a coop feature that actually works... 

Could anyone tell me what my options are for using this game's coop features? Can I only use adhoc or would it be possible to play with other people using the adhoc party on the PS3? Are there any other options?"
,Keus123,2010-06-08T22:40Z,you can try to use Ad-hoc party :)
,rlhq23,2010-06-08T23:45Z,"Not only can I confirm that this works great, but its also quite possibly the best entry yet in the Metal Gear series. The only problem I had was the occasional freezing during two particular missions, but once I went to the link provided in the description and followed the instructions, the problem was solved and the game runs flawlessly now. "
,TheT3chGuy,2010-06-09T00:36Z,"-update-
went and put 5.50 Gen-D3 and it works great, thank you for a quality up! looks like an awesome game."
,topherisher,2010-06-09T00:40Z,"What do you mean by ""I went to the link provided in the description and followed the instructions""? I'm still downloading this game at 65% I wanna know if there is really a problem(that could be solve) in chapter 2 ppol complain about?"
,topherisher,2010-06-09T02:15Z,ok i get it the description above this page and below the title checking it now.
,topherisher,2010-06-09T03:06Z,aaaaaaaaaaaargh The patch file is in Mega fucking upload and I can't download it. Is there are torrent available?

,IziThiM,2010-06-09T05:09Z,"Well fuck, UL 400+, DL 10+. Looks like I'm not getting this after all..."
,leo_xlnc,2010-06-09T18:45Z,"guyz... is there any way to make it work on 5.00 m33-6?
cuz all i get is a black screen after loadin it."
,xmesca,2010-06-09T20:30Z,"From personal experience, this .iso does not work with 
CFW 3.9 m33-3 - game crashes immediately
I upgraded to CFW 3.95 GEN and CFW 4.01, game loads but does not save.

I am now currently in CFW 5.5 GEND3, I use the fix provided but the game still does not save. Game loads just fine, I can play through the Prolouge but at automatic saves points it does not save. Anyone know how to fix this?"
,rlhq23,2010-06-09T22:56Z,"@ topherisher,

  In the description of this torrent, ""Keus123"" provided a link to a forum where you could download the fix and it had directions; my comment was in regards to that link. Since then, the fix has been uploaded via torrent to save people the hassle of registering in the forum and such. 
        The freezing only occurred for me during the T72U tank battle whenever I would try to fire weapons at the troops around the tank, but not at the actual tank. It also froze before the Helicopter boss battle. After going to the link and following the instructions, everything was fine. Just keep the two fix files on your memory stick, because it froze once me so I reapplied the patch and its been good since. So freezing once more in 13+ hours of play isn't so bad. I'm more concerned about my PSP overheating :)  "
,rlhq23,2010-06-09T22:57Z,"oh, and Keus123- thanks!"
,somguy,2010-06-10T12:26Z,can anyone tell me where i can get gen-d3 from??
,theblacknemesis,2010-06-10T12:55Z,"Much props to Keus123 for this one (and the game itself too), gonna be playing this for a loooong time째.째)b"
,EmoSaga,2010-06-11T06:03Z,When I click on the Fix program the screen just goes black. Using Gen-D3... any info?
,kakalbo123,2010-06-11T11:59Z,this game only works up to end of chapter 1 if so you happen to live up to chapter 2 then dl keus mgs fix and never

,xmesca,2010-06-11T21:16Z,"I figured out what the problem was to why I wasn't able to save. It was a hardware issue, not the iso.

I have disabled KHBBS and everything looks good.

Can anyone confirm that this particular iso with the fix does not freeze? I have only played for an hour or so and everything looks good so far."
,IZZY-E,2010-06-11T23:33Z,"If u wanna struggle then download this piece of shit torrent if not, then look elsewhere cuz this shit DOES NOT WORK. It keeps on freezing on more and more points and im sick of it. I did everything that was suggested and no absolute progress at all. Im on 5.50 gen-d3 CFW, i download Keuses shitty as fix and installed as directed, and changed that txt file thing in the recover menu and nothing. It's your choice if u choose to download this crap."
,Keus123,2010-06-12T04:39Z,Izzy-E get the fuck out of here i didnt have to upload this but i didnt out of the kindness of my heart why dont you patch this fucking game and actually do something productive with your life instead making dumbass comments on a torrent site 
,Keus123,2010-06-12T04:48Z,Izzy-E dont complain about something thats free >_>
,ZangetsuPH,2010-06-12T06:15Z,an iso for 5.00 m33 pls. thanks
,babak159,2010-06-12T15:28Z,"Izzy-E

just look at your fucking account.you didn,t upload
a single torrent.I bet you delete each torrent you download and your share ratio is 0.00. 
 useless leech."
,plor_en,2010-06-12T17:46Z,"I got the damn thing to work using ISOTOOL 1.52!

BUT FIRST OF ALL, you need:
1. unadultered/unpatched/fresh .iso file of the game (look for torrents containing file psy-mgspw.iso, I got mine from here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5607981/Metal_Gear_Solid_Peace_Walker_USA_PSP_%5Bwww.forodescargasdirectas

2. You need a unit with CFW 5.00 m33-6

My current FW is 5.00 m33-6 in a FAT-100?.

1. I just downloaded ISOTOOL 1.52 and the latest PROMETHEUS v0.3 from psp-hacks.com.

2. Then I overwritten the PROMETHEUS folder in ISOTOOL with the contents of the latest PROMETHEUS.

3. I then copied the whole ISOTOOL folder into the PSP's memory stick (under PSP/GAME folder)

4. Then I copied the iso file psy-mgspw.iso (downloaded from another torrent) to the ISO folder.

5. I just ran ISOTOOL in the PSP, DECRYPTED the .iso file (saying YES to the 3 questions), then PATCHED the .iso file using the PROMETHEUS option in ISOTOOL.

6. After that I was playing for an hour straight with no problems.

It's my first time to patch an .iso file and it was such a no brainer. I never thought I could do it.

Mabuhay ang mga Pinoy! Yeah!"

,ragnorac,2010-06-14T17:15Z,"It also works with the tool D2-D3 switcher from PSPhacks,
after i switched to D2, It won't crash anymore :)
so you don't need to do al those handlings for re-patching :)"
,omgdetejag,2010-06-14T20:19Z,Can I play this with a friend through adhoc mode if my friend has a legal copy of the game?
,scavengeriel,2010-06-17T18:01Z,"the ISO is  working fine... just downgrade your 5.50 gen d3 psp to 5.00 M33 or 5.50 Gen-d2...

How to downgrade?

5.50 gen d3 => 5.50 gen d2

Just download the 5.50 gen d2 quick updater and put it in you ms0/PSP/Game and run it in you XMB

5.50 gen d3 => 5.00 m33 

Just run Hellcats recovery not sure with the version though

hoped i helped
"
,scavengeriel,2010-06-17T18:06Z,oh and the method Keus123 suggest is also working...problem is you cant play games that work only in gen d3 so you have to use the MGSnever... thanks by the wayfor the torrent
,ajdoms,2010-06-19T06:15Z,"hi, i have a 3.71 m33-2 psp slim... and this MGS is not working in my system. can i update my system? will it affect my psp? i'm scared that when i update it i won't be able to download games. is it safe to update my psp?
thanks"
,N4o7A,2010-06-19T10:07Z,I'm really confused when people say to turn off the KHBBS plugin...is that what the plugin is called cuz when I boot up my psp into the recovery menu there's all these other plugins but none by the name of KHBBS. BTW I do have KHBBS working on my psp so does that mean turn off all the plugins making the KH game work? I also have the same problem with it freezing at the end of chapter 1 when interrogating the guard in the cut scene... Thanks
,anonrain,2010-06-21T02:31Z,"It always freezes at the second tank battle. I'll stun a few guards then the game just freezes completely, I downloaded that patch from the link in the description but it didn't do anything."
,anonrain,2010-06-21T07:20Z,"Guys go on google and search ""PSP HACKS"", go on that website and on the front page will be a new item saying ""CFW 5.50 Prometheus Released; For PSP-1000 & PSP-2000 Models"". Download this, and Peace Walker will work fine! My game always froze on the tank battle, now it seems to be working."
,xmesca,2010-06-22T17:21Z,"Use the freeze fix he Kues123 suggests and GEN-D3 and you won't have any problems.

I just finished playing the game, all main-ops, without a problem."
