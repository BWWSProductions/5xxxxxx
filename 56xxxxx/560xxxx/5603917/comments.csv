Let hope that someone will find the way to kill it. Maybe someone work on new, cleaned firmware for PS3 and maybe (not me, because, as I said, I cannot verify a thing) wold be able to remove Cinavia from audio-signal. I have pretty good picture how they did it and it would be very tough job. But, someone would, sooner or later. Just another round in Cat&mouse game..."

But, Timothy was in the town and agreed to be encoded. Justified finale next week is a deal too. Should it be 720p 350 MB or 272p tell me whenever you like."
