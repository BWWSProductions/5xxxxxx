Among the most notorious cult films in American history, SNUFF is famous for promoting the urban legend of the "snuff" film. Filmed in Argentina over a period of 4 weeks on a budget of $30.000 in 1971 it depicted the actions of a Manson-esque murder cult. The film went unreleased for several years, though after the controversy that erupted when it was released in 1976, people claimed to have seen it before.
