Soccer - the only thing more boring than basketball."
,barrygateaux,2010-06-02T12:16Z,"let me guess - you're a lonely person who has no friends, so you feel the need to troll in order to have any connection with the rest of humanity.

i hope things get better for you "

,barrygateaux,2010-06-10T02:05Z,"yup - gotta lol at K-urling too...

,Booya71,2010-06-13T21:05Z,"wow...tdatb, are you a complete f***up or what? u hate soccer so you punch up world cup to bag on people who do like it? hey man, head down to the ol' ball park, grab yourself a dog and a beer, and prepare for America's favorite past time...eating, sleeping, and aiming for obese..you jack ass..and the other pinhead 'Hhiiimmmm', both of you should go bowling...

nothing is more stupid than the NFL with a ball being in play for 8 minutes out of an hour! 5 hour baseball games, and gun toting, pot smoking basketball players..wow, you guys are right..the rest of us are missing out!

i wonder if ESPN is broadcasting a hot dog eating competition today? gotta watch MUST SEE TV!!! oh, no, maybe a spelling bee!!!!!! 

wake up pinheads.."
