,jazzyb123,2010-06-06T16:13Z,I have power archiver! Doesnt seem to load the 2nd rar file!
[T],megadethmen,2010-06-06T16:31Z,try it with the latest winrar. the 2 files are connected. you start extracting with the first one and its automatically extract the 2nd too (after finished the 1)...

,ztarven,2010-06-15T06:41Z,Tried opening it with the latest version of WinRAR. Doesn't work.
,luckylime,2010-06-15T15:05Z,"^ same for me, not sure if I'm doing something wrong. I can't extract the files, all I can do is ""add to archive"" which compresses them into an extractable mode, but all I can extract are the compressable files again getting me nowhere. :\"

,Jman_nunez,2010-07-10T07:55Z,the files are in 001 and 002 format they have a low chance in opening in win rar so u either have to use 7-Zip or HJsplit.
,Jman_nunez,2010-07-10T08:04Z,"TO ANYONE WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS EXTRACTING READ THIS! nn1. Make sure both files that came with torrent are accessible.nn2. Download HJsplitnn3. Run the program after installation.nn4.Click on the button that says \""Join\""nn5.And click the \""input\"" button and look for the 001 file or the first file of the torrent.nn6. let it work its magicnn7. after that go back to the folder where the 2 rar files are and there will be a new file, thats the one we just made that we can now extract perfectly normalnn8. Run the exenn9. Enjoy :)nnOh and tell me if this helped..."
,Jman_nunez,2010-07-10T08:06Z,sorry that comment looks wierd but its just a checklist with numbers to the left lol just read cafefully lol
,Traziz,2010-07-13T20:12Z,you only have to open a dos prompt.nngoto where the two files are and typenncopy /b portable_acoustica_mixcrnaft_v5.0.130.rar.001 +Portable_acoustica_mixcraft_v5.0.130.rar.002  pam.rarnnAnd open up pam.rar
,Pope541,2010-07-19T02:47Z,Thanks Jman that worked for me
,stmmchn,2010-08-02T00:23Z,"Excellent. First Mixcraft torrent I've found that consistently works without nagging for a key. Used 7-zip to extract the two-part archive. Works excellent. Many thanks, megadethmen!"
,relik01,2010-08-03T01:28Z,It is still asking me for a key code.  What is it?
,Lupius,2010-08-03T17:11Z,"Still asks for registration on boot up and on mixing to mp3, and of course the TEAM AIR code doesn't work."
,Heljay,2010-08-07T18:13Z,Works like a charm. Thanks!
,10min,2010-08-10T19:24Z,"Program works fine without problems, but none of the samples in the library make any sound.. can't download them either."
,Bonds007,2010-08-13T17:48Z,Mine isnt working anymore i have it for a long time now and now its asking for serial please help
,dezine33,2010-08-26T09:55Z,"Google hjsplit, open it, click join, go to the folder, choose the file, hit start, it will make a rar in the same folder. Unzip that and your good. Takes a second."
,kevitality,2010-08-28T18:55Z,"So I downloaded it. It worked. It didn't ask for a serial and I could export. Now, the wave doesn't appear anymore on the tracks and the program close itself after like 1 minute, just short after each time I try to reccord saying the program crashed due to an unknown problem. There wasn't any probleme for the last 2 weeks, and suddenly, just when I changed the exporting folder everything went bad. "
,download_dude112,2010-09-14T10:11Z,"It was working great for a few days, but now it asks for a serial :("

,Bonds007,2010-11-06T06:18Z,Its asking for serial now why?
,TheRekcah,2010-11-15T02:27Z,"IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE. Mixcraft 5 will work for a little while, but after that NOTHING will make it work.

So until someone posts a valid code, or makes a working crack, just download version 4."
,CCJoco,2010-12-06T10:46Z,"FUCK mixcraft, I hate it!! I did a track on this sh*t, and i can't mix down to mp3 that, i thought 'ok, no problem i'll do with 4.5"" bullshit, this f*ckin 4.5 hasn't the best effects which 5.1 has. i'm fckin disappointed, somebody cracks that program pls!!!!!! ohh, and i downloaded that torrent, but when i extract it, the cpu  has an error, and can't run this f*ck... maaaan, somebody hellp!!!!!"
,CCJoco,2010-12-06T11:10Z,"ok, now that's portable works, but ask a code, i wrote in siad ""thanks for reg"" and do absolutely NOTHING... fuck, somebody crack that biatch!!"
,Tyfer666,2010-12-12T10:44Z,"Works fine for now. It won't immediately ask for the registration information pending computer restart after installation. When you open the program, at the top there will be a button that says ""Purchase Product"" or something along those lines. Click that, type in name (all caps), copy the serial number, and paste it into the section. Don't worry about the hyphens, they will be taken out. Click register, and you're good. i suggest beginning musicians who are recording start out with something that is a bit more simple, such as Cool Edit Pro 2.1. Working torrent can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3802771/Cool_Edit_Pro_2.1_-_Full_working_and_registered.zip"
,mehrlin,2010-12-18T13:15Z,TKS a LOT!
