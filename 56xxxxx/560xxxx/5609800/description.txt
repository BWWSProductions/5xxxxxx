[UPDATE]
It has been braught to my attention
that there is a typo in my instructions
in the instructions video
in the video it says the realmlist is
"set realmlist serverdivcrew.com"
this is incorrect, the correct realmlist is
"set realmlist server.divcrew.com"
do not use the quotation marks

Sorry to all of you that didnt notice the
spelling error and has bee having problems 
trying to connect.
