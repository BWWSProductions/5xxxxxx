yet i have not seen one new member on my server
as a result of this torrent

Did i mess up?
Did i miss something?
or are users simply using my torrent to go to other
private servers?

i would really appreciate some feedback, thank you"
,demongithara23,2010-06-14T01:15Z,"I don't want to sound like a dick, but after I downloaded this, and I watch the video, I see that I must wait to download 3.3 gb of install files which do not come with the torrent. At 1.0 gb it reads that I am only at 10% I don't know how long this is going to take, but it seems like an eternity. However, it is downloading rather fast. I am kinda stupid and deleted my .rar files. I apologize, and will re-dl to seed if I can get this thing installed eventually. The long install process probably drove a lot of people away, but if it's worth it, I'll let my buddies know and we'll have some fun. I do thank you for this torrent, as I have always wanted to play this game, but have always been to broke to afford the monthly fee. Cheers :)"
