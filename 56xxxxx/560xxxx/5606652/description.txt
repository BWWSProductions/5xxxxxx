Guys,I am really happy to post this torrent out here.I was introduced to this series by a local comic publisher here and has been an avid reader and seeker of this great series since then.

When I found the first 12 issues in english at internet,I saw that no torrent was available and posted it on  demanoid.Then,I decided to post it here too.

But,unfortunately,I wasn't able to do so back then.It has been for the good,though.Some days back,I found  the issues 13-17.

I decided to make a torrent and to post it here,where it will be available easily to everybody unlike demanoid.

A few words about the internet speed though.My net scheme here limits me to seed this torrent with a low speed.So,kindly bear with me.

Now,about the torrent,this contains the issues 1 to 17.
Here,there are two files for issues 4 and 5.
Here,from issues 1 to 5 were released by dargaud in english.
From 4 till 17,some die hard fan has translated the french version to english.Kudos to him.

So guys,seed this torrent and spread the word.Let this great series reach out to many people.
Instead of my limitations,I will seed this torrent for atleast a month.Please do seed.
