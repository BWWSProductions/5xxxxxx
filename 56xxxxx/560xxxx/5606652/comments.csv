,ajones81,2010-06-04T23:28Z,"I'm really excited about Cinebook starting its publishing run of these series. They say they're going to eventually translate and release all 19 vols. in English.

Vol. 1 i.e. ""The Day of the Black Sun"" is already out (released in May 2010): http://www.cinebook.co.uk/catalogue~Cat~A-008-046B~Code~9781849180399.asp

Next up is ""Where the Indian Walks"" in July: http://www.cinebook.co.uk/catalogue~Cat~A-008-046B~Code~9781849180405.asp

And then ""All the Tears of Hell"" in Sept: http://www.cinebook.co.uk/catalogue~Cat~A-008-046B~Code~9781849180511.asp

So looks to be a regular bimonthly schedule as of now, which is great! :)"
,colsonthailand,2010-06-06T15:03Z,"This is indeed a great serie. In French/Dutch they have more then enough to keep going for a while.

I love the books, and have them (in dutch), now I can show them to my friends here in Thailand

Thank you for the torrent"

[T],Djofullinn,2010-06-13T22:55Z,"Now, if some of you donÂ´t know this and are used to viewing comics in .cbr or .cbz readers; this archived collection is no problem. You just rename the .rar files to .cbr and then you can view them in your Comic Book Viewer. Regards, Djofullinn."
,pathless,2011-04-06T17:49Z,"Is there episode 18 and 19 translated to english floating around anywhere.  I loved this series so far and will be seeding it for a while, but I have to find the last to books or I'll go crazy."
,ramkvp,2011-05-23T09:21Z,I haven't come across the last two episodes. I assume they have not been translated yet. That might be due to the fact that Cine-book is releasing the entire series in English in a regular basis.
,pathless,2011-06-22T07:21Z,"Yeah but, their regular basis is one issue every two months, so the last two won't be out for over a year or two."
,ramkvp,2012-04-02T06:21Z,Just came here to let you know guys that I saw the scans for the first four cinebook titles of XIII in net recently. Happy hunting.
