Recording information is non-existent, but these are almost certainly late '60's or early '70's recordings.
The fact is, if you're a serious Santana fan, you're likely to have heard this material.
And if you're coming from the perspective of 'Supernatural', this is unlikely to be a satisfying purchase because it's not really pop at all, it's more of a Latin-jazz-fusion, heavy on the instrumental jamming.
