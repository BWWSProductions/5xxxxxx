 Release Notes
 -------------
 ViDEO Source: RelizaLab [Thanks!]
 AUDiO Source: Our OWN LiNE

 Video: Some filters. Sharpened, contrast, denoise, etc.. 
 
 Audio: Our nice new direct LiNE. Has some great bass but was recorded a little
 low on volume, so ran it through an EQ. Next time it'll be recorded at a more
 proper volume and shouldn't need any filtering! We think anything we put out
 with this new LiNE will be the release to get and we hope everybody enjoys it.
 Many thanks to our new syncer ROLO for doing a fine job on this release! =]
