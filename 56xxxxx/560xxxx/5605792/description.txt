C4 - Fundamentals of Business Economics
 
http://www.bpp.com/learning-materials/our-products/accounting--finance/cima-new-syllabus/cima-c4.aspx

Paper C4 'Fundamentals of Business Economics' introduces the basic economic and financial concepts which management accountants need to know for their roles. It looks at the way individual organisations decide how to allocate resources (microeconomics) as well as looking at overall economic activity and economic policies (macroeconomics).

The syllabus is split into four areas:

    * The goals and decisions of organisations
    * The market system and the competitive process
    * The financial system
    * The macroeconomic context of business
