I've received so many e-mail from friends and new ones obviously asking me the link for those famous game from me posted in one of my torrents.

The reason why I never did it was simply cause.....I was waiting for the customer support from my website ...but guess what ? till now they never called me. 

This website is called.... PSP GO CENTER......

I'm pretty sure lots of you foes heard about them....
as I was saying before it works....see this website like others are authorized to (with a membership) let you download everything from PSN..( games, movies, music, psp mini) and more.


You guys may ask where is my problem!!!!!

It is so simple!!!! when I got may membership they told me that I will get step by step how to install them.... I still didn't got any news...my intention 
was to download the games for my kids and share it with the world...
