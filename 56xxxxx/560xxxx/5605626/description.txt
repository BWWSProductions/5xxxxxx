Barish Kepic is rock guitarist from Germany, he started playing guitar at the age of 15. Barish is born in Istambul, Turkey and this is his excellent first instrumental album Sensitive Crush from 2009. He is being the lead guitarist in bands such as Jaded Heart, Evidence One and Faro.

This CD is an all instrumental album with 10 tracks full of melodic guitar music, acoustic guitar tunes, some bluesy vibes and heavier stuff. Sahara, Time Will Tell and Chasing Stars are my favorites.
