Scouser John O'Rourke is redundant at 40. He uses
his enterprise grant to become a private detective.
He soon gets a case that's more than he can handle.

Not bad at all.

The best thing in this play is the copper, Crust.
He's in at least two others of Mcinerney's plays.
Does anyone have them?
