,ladyscarface,2010-08-01T08:07Z,Does any one have that new comedy Cyrus
,muckymucks,2010-09-02T21:54Z,"ladyscarface, nobody does. Gotta wait for that DVD release."
,keith23uk,2010-09-19T14:14Z,Cyrus the comedy. This is Cyrus the mind of a serial killer. I was looking for the comedy but looks like I will enjoy this one too! Only trouble with comedies about relationships now they are so much dime a dozen nobody bothers filming them all. Thats why you usually have to wait for dvd.
,cokey1,2010-09-19T23:38Z,why is this shit listed as 2010dvdrip when it is the old cyrus your a div for puting the wrong date on it and your listed as trusted you should be ashamed of your self
,hungfirefly,2010-10-01T16:17Z,"This is indeed a 2010 movie. 
IMDB link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327709/

@cokey1: I suggest you check out details for yourself before you go shooting your mouth off at someone who has taken the trouble to upload a movie. good or bad is not the question."
,Spambolo,2010-11-06T10:08Z,Old Reilly's taking his time coming out on DVD!
,aeevar,2010-11-15T09:34Z,i think every single person here wanted the o reliy movie....
,Phobos2005,2010-12-03T04:06Z,"Not the John C. Riley movie. This is a really, really bad low budget horror movie. Beware, 4.7/10 on IMDb should tell you something. AVOID!

Great quality video and audio if this is your kind of thing."
,retrozombi,2011-01-30T20:56Z,"Thank you for saving me from browsing through all the listings!

Because no...NOT everyone was looking for the John C. Reilly film."
