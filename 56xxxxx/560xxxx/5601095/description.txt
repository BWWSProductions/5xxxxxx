Styx and REO Speedwagon, two of the most successful bands of the 70s and 80s, launched a very successful tour during the summer of 2000, and this concert video was filmed during their tour stop in St. Louis. The video is divided into two parts, with each band performing seperately. Styx is up first with their new keyboardist/singer Lawrence Gowan. Gowan replaced Dennis DeYoung, who was kicked out of the band a year earlier. In my opinion, Lawrence Gowan is not nearly the singer or keyboardist that Dennis was. It was hard watching another person sing Dennis' songs, especially the classics "Lady" and "Come Sail Away". Yes, there's still all of Tommy Shaw's songs, such as "Fooling Yourself" and "Blue Collar Man", but Lawrence just doesn't do justice to Dennis DeYoung's songs.

Part two of the video features REO Speedwagon, who can still put on a fine show. Classics such as "Roll With the Changes" and "Keep on Loving You" still sound as good today as when they were released. Kevin Cronin's voice is still as good as ever.

There are also two songs featuring both bands playing together, these being REO's "Roll With the Changes" and Styx' "Blue Collar Man".
