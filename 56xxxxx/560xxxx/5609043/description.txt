Sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson and the rest of Heart are in good form in this solid if unspectacular 100-minute concert video, shot in 2002 in their hometown of Seattle. The sisters, of course, are a good deal older than in Heart's '70s heyday, and their bandmates have changed, but the group's sound, led by Ann's powerful vocals and Nancy's instrumental versatility, hasn't changed much; that's a good thing for those who revel in the likes of "Barracuda," "Magic Man," and other oldies. There are several brand-new songs here as well, and the ongoing influence of Led Zeppelin is readily apparent, not only in the covers of Zep classics like "Black Dog" and "The Battle of Evermore" but also in Heart's commingling of pastoral acoustic sounds and hard rock. And after 19 songs, even the most ardent Heart lovers should be well satisfied. --Sam Graham
