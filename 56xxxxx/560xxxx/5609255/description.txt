Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown - Okie Dokie Stomp
Year: 1981-85
Label: Bullseye (1999, 24 bit remastering)
Total time: 55:34
Quality: 320 kbps

A budget, 12-song collection taken from Gatemouth's three '80s era Rounder albums with an added bonus of a 10-minute version of "The Drifter," recorded live in Switzerland in 1982.  A good starting point for anyone coming to this multi-talented artist. ~ Cub Koda, AMG

The first time I heard Gatemouth was in 1952 as a 7th grader.  His 78 rpm record, "The Okie Dokie Stomp" was on the cafeteria jukebox, and it played over and over and over again during the lunch hour.  Then a few years later I was lucky enough to get my own DJ show on one of the local Galveston radio stations.  I chose "The Okie Dokie Stomp" for my theme song and it stayed with me for as long as I was known a Brokenhearted Bill.  Gatemouth must be in his late 70s by now, but his style with a guitar has never been successfully copied.  Many have tried. If you like the blues, Gatemouth needs to be included in your collection, and this CD is a good place to start. ~ William S. Cherry
