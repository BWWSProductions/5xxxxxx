,hamzeeco,2010-06-03T18:08Z,thanks dude!
,PXT0R0,2010-06-04T02:29Z,"........any other suggestion

Yeah, I have one.....nobody cares that you are proud of yourself, or glad of yourself like you put it.....and nobody cares about your supercomputer or software or anything you write that has nothing to do with your upload.

Nobody is impressed with you. Sorry to break it to you but its the truth.

How about you actually describe the stuff you upload?! Many people on here have complained about this but it seems you just don't care.

So yes, thank you for your uploads but enough about your computer and start using descriptions!"
,Re_Name_Me,2010-06-06T01:02Z,its crashing... and i would like how to get it working with either vlc or kmp.. plx..
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2010-06-06T14:30Z,you should uninstal any direct show filter that help to play h.264 stream like klite and others then clean the registry after that you can reinstal the player so that a crash won't occur anymore
