,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-01T22:09Z,"Re-encode of a rip? No thanks, cracker, your filth is of no use. Quality suxx!"
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-01T22:50Z,"what do you base this assessment on?  What are your comparatives?  Can you please elaborate on ""quality suxx"".  Please define and break down which aspects of this video result in this statement of  yours."

Based on this:

""
Source: A.Single.Man.2009.Limited.1080p.Bluray.X264-DIMENSION
""

And this:

""A.Single.Man.BRRIP.MP4.x264.720p-PT""

BRRIP, i.e. short for Blu-Ray Rip would be a rip from a Blu-Ray source, yet your source is a Blu-Ray rip, i.e. a re-encode, i.e. you take something that is degraded and degraded it some more.

Whence, quality sucks. No matter how much tweaking you do with your encoder settings, you can't change the fact that you're re-transcoding something that's already been ripped and transcoded.

The LEAST you could do, if you insist on flooding an already filled scene with your idiotic re-encodes,  is stop using bullshit false names that include ""BRRIP"" and label your stuff properly. IT'S CALLED ""RE-ENCODE"", MY FRIEND!

Why would you spew out a 720p re-encode of something that already exists in a proper 720p encode anyway?

Yes, I'm a hater here, but it has nothing do with ""being famous"", just look at this multitude of needless and wrongly titled re-encoded uploads by this ""poptart"". This stuff is a decease, like morons making FLACs out of MP3s because they're too clueless to know what they're doing. Next thing you know, some other monkey renames it and uploads it again, and you find yourself downloading this crap without any chance of knowing that you're downloading re-encoded rebranded shit until you've already gotten it and need to start all over.

There's a reason why shitheads like that are banned from the scene. Because they're clueless wannabes that'll steal any proper release, fuck it up, and then rebrand it for five minutes of fame, effectively bringing the entire quality down for everyone. 

That's why I hate people like this ""poptart"", and that's why I tell him to fuck off.

He should. It would improve the bay in particular, and the rips out there in general."

[V],poppedtart,2010-06-02T21:58Z,"this is for a purpose, those encodes will not play on these devices.  You do realize that nearly everyone does this right?"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-02T22:46Z,"SO RIP A BLU-RAY FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! Don't justify your mislabelled re-encodes by saying the original RIP doesn't play on all devices! Or, if you don't have access to a blu-ray, release a how-to or profile or whatthefuckever to help people get a PROPER rip onto their devices. THIS IS POISONING OUR CHANNELS!

Jesus fucking christ..."
[V],Team_xRG,2010-06-02T23:55Z,"this is only 720p of this movie which works on apple tv
dont tell me it re encode or not 
whtever its not like ur gonna understand wht i mean.. lol 
and buddy those 4+ gb rips looks same on my screen why should i waste my bandwidth when i can get perfect rips that are compatible on other devices too ? "
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-03T00:30Z,"lol, you look silly with all your blabber mouthing, you have like 100 people on here you need to start flaming for this great injustice.  get busy."
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-03T08:45Z,"Great, so your argument is, ""It's not just me who's fucking up things, why are you yelling at me?""

You must be proud of your accomplishment there, doll. Your lameness matches other lamers, impressive! Hear me cheer on you:

*clap*"
,accuslut,2010-07-09T06:20Z,"man that dude is an idiot. I love your releases PT because I can play them on my xbox without any fuss. Obviously they are not perfect quality, but still look great on my tv. I don\'t expect it to be a perfect blu-ray rip. As far as I know, that is pretty much next to impossible? But whatever I don\'t care, if I wanted perfect quality I would buy the blu-ray. Guess all I\'m trying to say is I aprreciate the job you\'re doing PT, so keep it up!"
,telep_man,2010-07-16T21:34Z,"Hey douchebag, I\'m really sorry about your impotence (just guessing), but don\'t take it out on this guy. He\'s doing a good thing, he takes time to download an 8-ish GB rip, re-encodes it so it\'s playable on many different devices, and then uploads it to TPB. And all that just for a good cause, and not to gain something. So fuck you."
