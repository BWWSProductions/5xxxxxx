***** A complete burning suite for CD, DVD and Blu-Ray *****


A complete burning suite doesn't necessarily have to be complex or take up a massive amount of hard drive space. A good example of this is Ashampoo Burning Studio 9. 

This recording utility includes all the tools you need to burn CD, DVD and Blu-ray discs in your computer, in just a little over 100 MB. Ashampoo Burning Studio manages to offer a wide range of possibilities while maintaining a great usability thanks to a well-organized menu. 

All you have to do is select the appropriate task and Ashampoo Burning Studio will open the correspondent tool in a new window. The options are quite varied: you can burn files and folders, create backup copies, record an audio CD with your favorite music, work with image files, create copies from CD and DVD or even print covers, labels, and booklets.

The most outstanding new feature in this version is the new movie editor, which enables you to mix and edit your home videos and burn then on DVD. You can add fades, transition effects, titles and more, as well as DVD-style menu with animated themes.

The only drawback, if any, is the fact that Ashampoo Burning Studio is not integrated with Windows Explorer: it would have been great to burn some files or folders straight away just by right-clicking on them.

Ashampoo Burning Studio 9 is a full-featured yet easy to use burning tool with support for Blu-Ray and many interesting extra functions.
