[V],globeplus,2010-06-04T19:22Z,"This games that are old and don´t run in the new operative systems and only in 32bit , so it was because of that the dosbox emulator was needed to be possible the gameplay in the new operative systems and in 64bits machines , they are really fantastic interactive horror games that deserve to be taked a look and played and for the first time we see a file that have appropriate dosbox executables that runs the games easily anywhere on the computer without the need to have the dosbox emulator installed or having a folder with the games in a exact location , for games using the dosbox emulator this is certainly a perfect work .

Finally just to say that possible negative votes that this file get with really a absolute correct workit is only possible with some morrons of the concorrence guys that have an unrespectfull procedure in their conception of making files with is possible to get negative votes in a really positive work under the circunstances . 
i know from myself that will never ocurred me, that normal nice user of this file be capable in his conscience to give a negative note in a nice conception work like this , really only morons for jealous !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-06-04T19:44Z,"I´d like to say too , without ofense for the files for this games , that on that files are needed to install 7 discs in succession for the first game and 5 discs for the second and beside that the user need the dosbox installed and the game in a appropriate and if all of this not enough for the latest operative systems and 64 bits machine is really needed an appropriate installer from the games maker , what i mean it´s that is possible to simplify the use of the dosbox emulator but in this case , creating appropriate executables for the game we want to launch , the work of the other files are absolute irrepreensivel and just the fact in uploading so nice games with a little complex use deserve respect , thank you guys for your files and remember the use of the games using the dosbox emulator have always a shot to be simplified . THANK YOU ."

,iopposeband,2011-03-02T22:54Z,Thanks for the games! I'm having problems with #2 though. The video is choppy and sometimes lags. Is there a way to fix this? My machine is quite new too. I'm running a 2.53ghz i5 with a gig of dedicated graphics and 4 gigs of ram. Anyone know?
,k-line,2011-05-22T06:06Z,"iopposeband, I remember DOSBOX has a feature to adjust emulated CPU clock (CTRL+F11 decreases the clock while CTRL-F12 increases the clock). It is designed so that some very old games do not run too fast. See the section ""9. How to run resource-demanding games"" in README.txt of DOSBOX for more information."
