,dlarrym,2010-06-03T20:49Z,"@ eztv: PLEASE upload the 4th episode of HAPPY TOWN. There is the pilot, 3 more episodes and they were supposed to not start the rest of the season 1 until some time in september, but LAST NIGHT on this date Wednesday -06/02/2010- the 4th episode aired. I haven't the means to capture it from the ABC website where you can watch the whole episode but can't download it. If my set up could stream from the net faster, I would be content o watch it online but because my connection SUCKS, it is all choppy and freezes and all the advice the website gives to stop those things are not working. even if I reduce the viewing screen size to as small as a postage stamp, I STILL GET THE LAGGING and choppy crap I always get when I try to watch a streamed video. When I watch a downloaded copy, it plays PERFECT. I don't understand it.... I used to be able to watch the FAMLY GUY on the cartoon network and now it is exibiting the same choppy behavior. My computer is DUAL processor, each running at 1000mhz, 1GB of RAM and a Radeon Video card....???? what the fuck????? Like I stated, I used to be able to watch at full  screen size streamed video but now I can't. I know that ABC's website for sure in 2010 made software changes on there end to ""improve"" watching quality of said online videos. It only seems to have made my situation much worse. Back to my request, If I can find a place to download it, PROBLEM SOLVED.... Thanks eztv, if you can. Your uploads are always awesome.... so if you can find this I have no doubt it will be of great quality. Thanks, sincerely, dlarrym"
