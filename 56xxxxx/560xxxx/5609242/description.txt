Eyescream.Fiesta.Chrissie.Chau.2009.BluRay.1080p.AC3.x264-CHD

It is perhaps fair to say that the most significant phenomenon on the Hong Kong entertainment scene in 2009 was the meteoric rise of the so-called "lang mo" (girly models). This new breed of showbiz starlets is accused of winning media exposure by, well, exposing their bodies. Out of these headline grabbers, the extremely sultry Chrissie Chau is arguably the most successful, who became the talk of the town last summer with her allegedly nosebleed-inducing photo album Kissy Chrissie. Shot entirely in the exotic Saipan Island, Kissy Chrissie features the fatally sexy seductress in various alluring outfits, postures, and close-ups, coupled with the suggestive placement of everyday items like toothpaste and ice-cream, the latter of which being the likely inspiration behind the title of this making-of documentary. If the picture book managed to get the readers' hormones raging, it would be interesting to see what the accompanying Eyescream Fiesta Blu-ray can do, with Chrissie's glorious gorgeousness captured in every minute detail!
