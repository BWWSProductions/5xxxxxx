,fendermental,2010-06-04T12:06Z,Thanks for another great upload. I really appreciate your work.
,]eep,2010-06-04T13:15Z,"wow, you really know your classics... you must be OLD. :P

Unfortunately i hate the stones, but I did have a look at your other excellent releases. Thanks!"
,snashforce,2010-06-23T02:07Z,"Thanks for the upload.  A great remaster of a great album!  One correction however - These tracks are not 24/96; they are 16-bit/48 kHz.  Maybe they started out 24-bit 96 kHz when you did the vinyl transfer, but somehow got converted to a smaller sample rate and size when they were converted to ALAC? This is still a great upload,
but not 24 bit 96 kHz files."
