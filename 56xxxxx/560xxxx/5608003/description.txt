Compression mini tutorial:
1. Run virtualdub.
2. Go to Video->Compression->(Choose Xvid driver)... is the last in the list->click Ok
3. Go to Video->Filters->Add->(Choose 2:1 Reduction High Quality).. is the first in the list anyway-> Click Ok->Click Ok again.
4. Go to File->Save processing settings (Next time you run VirtualDub you will just load the settings, not having to do steps 2-4 again and again)
5. Go to File->Open File... (Choose your video file)
6. Go to File->Save as AVI... (Choose the new name for your compressed version of the video file).
7. Keep doing steps 5-6 until you have loaded all video files you want.
8. Go to File->Job Control
9. Hit Start.
10.That's all.

Hope I stirr some people into making some more compressed TTC videos.
