[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T17:51Z,"Thanks neonrainbow.

@hkoraddi: OK, I would, even if I am not quite sure yet.

@jayden_federer: Two weeks ago one guy from 178.x.x.x have uploaded first torrent under my screen-name. I woke up that night and deleted torrent myself. ""Maybe database error"" I said.
Next week same happened again. That time I was sure that account was hacked and informed few people. Password has been changed. I never ever log-out. How is that possible?

One user cannot us two IPs in the same time.
Same user-space is related to one screen-name and one password, right?
So, no one could log-in onto same user-space if such is already occupied.
I order to ""superimpose"" himself over the users intruder use high administrative privileges.
Well, once he is ""in"", nothing prevent anything regarding that account - he can upload, delete someone's torrents and - change someone's password, doing plain Old/New password swap.

That happened yesterday, when he uploaded third torrent and get caught. From anger and motivated by pure evil he changed the password on way out.
So, I think that speaks more then many want to hear from someone like me."

Thanks for the encode/upload.

Yours is the only torrent of this show that I can TRUST to have A/V =10.

I know it hammers your poor old PC and I really appreciate you taking the time to produce this high quality encode.

Cheers
Jon"
