Collection of some DVDR files. Some have been upscaled, some have been downscaled, some have been converted from PAL to NTSC and some were tv rips made by me.

Quality is and has been the most important thing with these files. Simply, I did the absolute best with what I had to work with.

Anytime possible at all, I've replaced or used cd audio instead of what was in the file I re-encoded from or from the tv.

Most likely if the file is located in here, it is of the best quality you can find on the net for the DVDR version of the video.
