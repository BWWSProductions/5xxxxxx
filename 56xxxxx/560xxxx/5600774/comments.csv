[T],houruoha,2010-05-31T13:41Z,"yeap 
i can see that
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T13:56Z,"@sanyam: Yesterday, one Mod offered help, and removed all comments connected to yesterday's problem. Few minutes later we met on IRC and he was patient and kind enough to resolve the ""matter"". I am aware that some comments are absent, but I can't do anything about. If something important is missing, maybe you can reconstruct comment from memory and post as new one."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T14:03Z,"@sanyam: Now I see... I just have been on ""Stolen.Lives"" and your comment maybe few hours old - is deleted. I have no idea why. Maybe your involvement and role should be kept as secret."
,lilars26,2010-05-31T14:26Z,Thank you 20/40.
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T14:52Z,"@JoSox: Treme's destiny was interlaced with quark's. So, Treme accompanied our smallest, on his way... out... or someplace else...
Tudors could go.
Justified, if I was asked day before yesterday, answer would be - no. I promised Justified only as ""jump-in"" and I did it - four times. Little too much. Well, as you helped yesterday, I'll change my mind and say - yes, I promise."

I just did a search for 'Treme'S01E08.No one has put one up yet.It may not have played last night for some reason."
