,tex62,2010-06-06T07:27Z,"Watched season 1-5 so far,> NICE < good job brother and thanks. "
,tex62,2010-06-06T07:32Z,And to add this. They are so good I have been and still are SEEDING for over 2 weeks  just to help get them out there faster.
,CakeMonster,2010-11-01T20:06Z,"Mr meech if you could please upload season 2 of atlantis with commentaries it would make my day

There is a big torrent of season 1-5 of âgood qualityâ of atlantis but in that torrent only season 3-5 works and there are no directors commentaries

So please upload atlantis and especially season 2 with commentaries please :)"
,robin_pirate,2010-11-25T14:40Z,"i was just comparing your rip to one of the generic 350meg per episode rips & theres no f-king difference!! In fact if i apply a few playback filters to the 350meg one it actually LOOKS BETTER THAN YOURS in places, DESPITE THE FACT YOU ALMOST DOUBLE THE FILESIZE!!!!!
   YOU SIR ARE A WORLD CLASS FUCKWIT & I HOPE TO FUCK THE RIAA CATCHES UP TO YOU & LOCKS U UP WITH GAY RAPISTS FOR A HELLUVA LONG TIME.

,quentin_crisp,2010-11-25T22:07Z,"wow. sounds like the most interesting thing that's happened to robin pirate all year... if only we had to make these comments face to face, sigh..."
[V],meech,2010-11-29T17:50Z,"robin_pirate:
I have no idea what your motive is here.  But man...you gotta relax.  You're getting awfully worked up about something as simple as a torrent.

If you don't like it, bug off.  No one is forcing these down your throat.  If you really wanted to scare people away from this torrent, you could have at least made it sound a little more reasonable."
,xxpestixx,2011-01-08T05:46Z,"ok then let me make it more understandable... the video quality is actually slightly worse then the 350 mb version and the sound quality is really bad. the background music is much louder than the dialogue. however you cant complain about something that is free. BUT i would suggest either just making them in the 350 mb format or stop using the words ""high quality"""
,waytieowsb,2011-03-27T23:32Z,could someone please seed!! I'm uploading as much as I can but I still need seasons 7 to 10:(
,history_boy_,2011-06-19T11:40Z,"Beauty - Thanks very meech! Haha. I've had old copies of SG-1 SE1-10 for years and they were pretty terrible in comparison. Watchable, but you know how it is. Better quality IS better. 

I will get the files on the UL as much as possible but I can't promise permanent connection.
Thanks to everyone who seeded, even those who limited their UL rate. It doesn't matter, just means you have to be more patient. (Those who whine about it, please just think how much time and effort it takes to get these series UP on the service)

Thanks again guys

You are aware that swearing on here just makes you look like a tool. If you want people to get caught using this service, that also means YOU get caught by default. Why would you ever want that? It seems to me you are too desperate to get these episodes fast, and in such high quality that you could put it up against a blu-ray and not tell the difference. Perhaps you should just go out and buy it instead of spewing rubbish all over the place about other people's work - Hey they were better quality than the old episodes I had from when the series actually aired, so.

Oh and another thing. You only need to use one exclamation mark to make its point clear. Repetition of exclamation marks in the words of Terry Pratchett ""are the signs of a diseased mind"" - something to think about. Get outside, get some sunshine. You spent too long in your mothers basement."
,FavouriteX,2011-10-16T08:39Z,"Thanks Meech! 

@Robin, it depends on your screen resolution :)
On my 1280x800 there is a significant difference."
,LechuCzechu,2011-10-31T13:30Z,"Hi, thx meech for all those torrents. 
Please seed guys - as for now there are only 3 100% seeds and almost zero download speed. "
