Umm, hate to echo but. maybe before you scream fake or cite RAR files, you should lrn2click the link next to the word, oh, I don't know, Files?

Guys like this knob make my day. I don't get mad at stupid questions, because we were all new to TPB at some point. I don't even get upset when people spam links to other places. Easily ignored. But when people scream fake and it's not, and of course how would they know since they didn't even bother to download it, LET ALONE LOOK at it...?
That just makes me smile.

Thanks, knob. You made my night."
