,jon4fun,2010-06-05T15:42Z,"@ ALL H&R downloaders - PLEASE SEED!!!!

I can tell just by looking that at least 30% of DL'ers are (or rather have been) H&R shitheads. 
20-40, does NOT particularly care for this show and will drop it like a hot potatoe and not think twice.

Then we (ALL) lose out but we know who to blame.

If you don't want to seed then get this show from another source, loads on TPB and EZTV.

Please THINK, use your brains. 20-40 is a single REAL person (not some anonymous team) and he gets more annoyed at H&R shits than I do; and I am trying to be polite at the moment.
