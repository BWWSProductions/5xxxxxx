,Shadow_Dreamer,2010-06-04T20:41Z,"Uwe Boll (and I may have mis-typed the name) should be taken out the back and SHOT. 

Brings shame to movies, video games, and god knows what else. Sadly, I have seen most of his work, and even my bleak humor ran dry. 

Please add this to the collection and show it to your enemies over a drink or two.

FYI thanks for the upload, as it seemed to hit a nerve, so bloody good work! ;) "

,oggybones,2012-01-10T01:39Z,"I love shitty zombie movies like this. terrible acting, terrible scripting, and this one is even loosely based off of a video game, or at least has the same title. Get a little drunk before it starts and you'll laugh your ass off."
