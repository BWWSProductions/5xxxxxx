On 'Unsung,' Austin singer-songwriter Slaid Cleaves delivers a treasure trove of songs from some of his favorite writers, some undiscovered, all less-known than deserved. These are poignant stories, not unlike Cleaves' own songs, that feature poets, lovers and underdogs struggling to win. Cleaves brings these stories to life with the same eloquent grace and grit that have made his past recordings so valued.
