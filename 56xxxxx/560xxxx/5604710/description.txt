Game Notes

My name is Daichi Shou, and I'm nothing special. I tell my folks back at
home that I'm a big shot, but I'm really just working a part time job
delivering soba (buckwheat noodles) for a shop on the Himeda mountain
ridge - I drive the route morning and evening, live in my simple apartment
and banish all thoughts of fame or glory from my mind

But all that changed suddenly when one day on my route I got into an
accident, fell unconscious and when I woke up I was in the passenger seat
of a taxi driven by a beautiful girl! I didn't remember the details, but
it seems I'd lost memory of what happened earlier and she thought I was a
genius racing navigator

She said her name was Michi, and she was so cute I couldn't help but go
along with her case of mistaken identity. With my advice her driving skills
became top notch, and attracted competition from around the country and
beyond. With beautiful girls flocking to race for my attention, which one
will I choose to guide to victory?! If I'm successful in helping the girls
win, they're likely to show me their gratitude, and the thought of what
they'll do for me after the race keeps me going
