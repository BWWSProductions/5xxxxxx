save the day as a brave firefighter, change the town as a

artist. Will your  Sim  find  success  as  a  billionaire

your hands!

,Jarzy,2010-06-04T17:43Z,"I'm having a bit of problem with this expansion :( I tried to install Ambitions without being connected to the net (router prolly died). The game asked to update and I clicked to update. Then I accidentaly hit the power button on my laptop :/ Had to restart the Ambitions install. This time I installed it without having to update anything. The expansion installed fine. I've got a save from World Adventures, which I tried to load BUT the loading screen is crazy and when the game crashes when the progress bar on loading is like 1/20 thru. I used the crack for both Sims 3 and Ambitions provided with this torrent. Previous expansions worked like a charm for me. What do I do? :( How can I make the gamer attempt to update during installation again? I reinstalled ambitions but didin't get opportunity to update during install. Help any1?"
,Jarzy,2010-06-04T17:57Z,"BTW I think I've got Reloaded's realease of Sims 3. All patched to Hi End Stuff, cracked and stuff. Funny thing is - my downloaded extra S3 stuff won't work with Ambitions. I had some extra store items installed earlier :/"
,Jarzy,2010-06-04T18:16Z,"I've reinstalled it AGAIN, didn't apply any cracks and used the gamecopyworld mini image - still the same! The loading screen is flashing very brightly in the background, the loading texts are ale blurry. The game crashes when trying to load a saved game. I think it's all due to that missed update which comes up when u first run the install. It doesn't show up anymore - how can I restore it? :("
,Jarzy,2010-06-04T18:33Z,"1 more thing - is it possible to install The Sims 3 without the update option which pops up at the start of the installation?

I had the same problem with WA and it appeared after an update, so my no-cd wasn't compatible anymore with the version. You can also try to install a pack (like Loft) just after Ambitions, it may resolve the problem."

,ickho,2010-06-07T08:52Z,You need daemon tools and mount this download whenever you play the game
,Cale245,2010-06-07T09:17Z,"Hello users, This will be my first time doing this... 
I encountered about EVERY issue that could arise, and fixed it, works great, so hope this helps.

if you encounter the CRC error 95%+(it will also say SKU incompatible) into the install, you need to abort and Delete all the files pulled out of the RAR, and find a different tool to extract them.

if you use say... reloaded and vitality and need to change the SKU codes, 
type: REGEDIT  under ""START"" and ""RUN...""
HKEY)LOCAL_MACHINE 
SOFTWARE
SIMS
and the folders under that last folder will each show SKU, you can edit that so ALL SIMS folders say 1 or 2. 
you can change it as needed. each of the expansions has a file called ""skuversion"" (txtdoc) in there you see a bunch of crap. Just look at the first line 
EXAMPLE:GameVersion = 2.0.86.002002 (SKU2)
EXAMPLE2: GameVersion = 4.0.87.006001 (SKU1)
EXAMPLE3:GameVersion = 1.0.631.00001 (sku1)
I went by the last numbers as I installed. Also remember the correct order.
if you did everything and are having issues, it is likely you need to uninstall everything.
Go to MYDOCUMENTS/Electronic Arts folder, back that folder up in a totaly different place, then uninstall ALL. 
FOLLOW user ickho  instructions on these comments board it works. 
DO NOT USE THE CRACK FILES however. JUST use the IMAGE file downloaded from Gamecopyworld.com and MOUNT it using Daemon tools. This allows you to keep everything up to date as they patch. It is important you patch fully after EVERY install.
Everything is legit because you will ignore the exe fix files that crack this game. 
I promise this all works."
,Cale245,2010-06-07T09:19Z,"also if you DL the gamecopyworld.com IMAGE FILE, you will notice its a RAR inside a RAR, so you will extract twice, at least I had to in order to access the NS-Sims3EP02_DC-poseden file that Daemon tools reads. just FYI."
,Cale245,2010-06-07T09:25Z,"for you DOWNLOADED crap, just go to where your game is installed
DEFAULT:C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\
under that Folder will be all the folders for each expansion and original. As the game gains new expansions its necessary to CUT/PASTE the ""MODS"" folder to the NEWEST expansion directory. It is my understanding that is where it reads it. all my content loaded fine when I did this from ADVENTURES to AMBITIONS. 
Before uninstalling you will need to back this up as well. "
,Cale245,2010-06-07T09:32Z,"last thing.. as long as you properly update before each install, you will not encounter problems. IF you already cracked the file, uninstall everything after backing up EA folder in mydocs, and MODS folder in default directory."

,Alefaye,2010-06-07T16:07Z,"Thanks for the upload!

I seem to be having the same problem with this one though that I did with another torrent. I was able to get it installed and it works except anything to do with the expansion does not show. As in there is no text, but I can select it. I don't know if I'm explaining this correctly.. but for example, I can choose a character trait, but it only shows the picture. It doesn't tell me what it is or what it does. And I can go to the salong and get a tattoo, but the pictures, descriptions and etc do not show up. Has anyone else had this problem and was able to fix it?

Uninstalling them last time didn't remove the mods from High-end loft stuff and I had forgotten to delete the crack for that expansion too!

Switching back to noncracked files & deleting mods directory from it fixed ambitions for me :)

Oh, and you can still use your mods, you just need to place them to C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods folder instead (on XP & Vista might be different folder, but ""my documents"" thingy anyway)"

So I installed the game and the little video at the beginning worked, but once I got to the main loading page, the words were blurry and the Sims logo wasn't available. Then once I tried to load a saved game or start a new game it would load for about 1 minute and then crash without any error message.

I've been reading on this message board and don't understand a lot of the terms yet so is there any way someone could explain what I did wrong or can do to fix this problem in...plain english? Or perhaps provide a link that has information a noob like me might understand?

It would be greatly appreciated!"

- Install SIMS 3 and Final Version Patch from the SIMS3 disk (the serial is in Readme.nfo). Don't bother to crack it if you don't play it.
- Install SIMS 3 Ambitions (you can find the serial in this forum). Let it update. Overwrite TS3EP02.exe and TSLHost.dll from ViTALiTY folder into the ""The Sims 3 Ambitions\Game\Bin"" folder.
And now the most important: DO NOT LAUNCH THE GAME FROM THE DESKTOP ICON THAT THE INSTALLER PUT ON. Delete this icon and make new short-cut from ""TS3EP02.exe""or launch the game by executing directlu this file from the folder you put in. That's all. It worked for me, it should work for you too."

This will however keep you below *Retail* version and *some* items will not be available in game, you can use the exchange to download content if you have an EA account.  You can also use sites such as modthesims.

Note: Supposedly, one or more of the Xpacs were German or something, (according to original torrent up loader) but I have not seen anything in a different language than English, so I don't think this is true.

4) Try install ""Ambitions"" and you will be asked about an UPDATE. Click ""yes, update this S*** NOW!!!"" and continue installing.

5)Once finished the Ambitions install, get the cracks inside ""Vitality"" folder. You need to use BOTH cracks: one for ""Amb."" directory and another for ""The sims 3"" directory.

6) Start playing from the finally cracked ""Amb."" directory.

If you look up, just one post, you will see a link that I just posted to a COMPLETE repack of all those torrents +.  A repack that I made and uploaded, and am seeding.

And no, you cannot use the patches, as they will update your base game, or your expansion, causing an incompatibility error.

--------------------

I guinea pigged, and tested for several days, different setups and version numbers, and found that the base game and xpacs have to be within a certain version range or they become incompatible, the installers for the xpacs will update you base game to the appropriate versions automatically, just click yes when the installer says it needs to update The Sims 3.  Just remember not to install EA Download Manager :P

,saph27,2010-06-21T09:14Z,":adding to xxandxy post-
if you need to manual uninstall the original game like i did or just want to make sure you get rid of all the files, go to

,asfbr,2010-06-21T19:37Z,"I was scared before downloading all this expansions as the comments were all full of problems, but now I really don't know why you all have so many trouble.
Here's what I did, if that helps anyone:

1-Installed The Sims 3 AND EA Manager
2-updated the game through the launcher
3-copied the crack I got in http://jogosforpc.blogspot.com/2010/06/sims-3-atualizacao-1122733.html (it's in portuguese, but still)
4-played for a while (a couple of hours, until all the exp. were finished downloading)
5-removed the crack, just in case (restored the backup).

6-installed world adventures.
7-let EA manager update
8-crack
9-played for just some minutes
10-removed the crack

then did the same thing for high end loft stuff and ambitions, and everything is running ok(just the first loading of my savegame for each expansion installed takes a fucklong time)

the only bad thing now is that I can't get Riverview to work anymore. It was working w/o any expansions, but now it won't appear. I was tired of that city anyway.

ts3 - reloaded(this one I had had for some time)
ts3 WA - reloaded
ts3 HELS - vitality
ts3 ambitions - vitality"

,cenoviA,2010-06-22T12:23Z,"My install kept crashing and I noticed this:

When you uninstall the Sims 3, the mods you put in aren't uninstalled automatically EVEN IF you click yes at the prompt to uninstall all mods. You have to manually delete the folders in Program Files. There is also a bunch of saved stuff in your My Documents directory for EA. You can try deleting that too if you can't get your install to work."
,cenoviA,2010-06-22T13:07Z,"Finally got this to work. You don't need the mini image, the included crack works fine. You don't need all the Vitality iso's either, my base game comes from Razor911, World Adventures came from Vitality, and Ambitions I got from Games For All.

I did a clean install because when I tried it w/the already cracked files it would crash. 

1) Uninstall all the Sims 3 EPs you have. 
2) Manually navigate to your Program Files folder and delete everything for the Sims in the Electronic Arts folder, do the same for the stuff in your Electronic Arts folder in My Documents.
3) Install the base game and the EPs in the order they were released (e.g. don't install Ambitions before World Adventures etc.) WARNING: DO NOT CRACK THE GAME BEFORE ALL THE EPs HAVE BEEN INSTALLED
4) Once all the EPs have been installed, crack them, all of them, using whatever crack came with your download.
5) Install any compatible Mods or CC and play!"

Now there is this:



=================================================================


1. install sims 3 razor use the patch provided to update (do not crack)make
 sure u r antivirus is disabled (needs to be disabled for patching)after that u can enable it 
2 .now install sims 3 world adventures reloaded (it will ask u to update)update on line tip:install 
EA download manager its good when download completes through EADM u can copy update file 
loacated on u r hard drive for future C:ProgramDataElectronic ArtsEA Corecache
3. now install Sims 3 Highend loft stuff vitality and update this one too 
4 .now install ambitions vitality and update it as well 

NOTE: do not use cracks cause they dont get updated every now and then,use mounted image insted which works as Orignal DVD no matter what version is updated

=================================================================

1 - Install Sims 3 first. DON'T UPDATE. Don't crack. Wait till your done installing everything.
2 - (OPTIONAL) Install world adventures, high end loft stuff, ambitions. (try that order, you can 
decide to skip one or two or all, wont hurt)
3 - Crack the last installed expansion/stuff pack.
4 - update/patch at your own risk. you might not be able to install the next expansion pack (whenever it comes out) 
if you do. It happend to me, had to reinstall and start all over.

So yes, you have the hang of it. cracking the old expansion packs will do no harm. However, you must crack 
the last installed pack at least, and use it to start the game. I guess you can use one of the old cracks to start the game if you prefer. 
Also be sure to follow the instructions in the nfo files of the torrents over mine, for example, this torrent requires you crack AND replace two old sims 3 files with Vitality files.

TIP: create a shortcut to the crack, and use it. else your gonna have to use the desktop shortcut which goes to the sims launcher. and that's soooo much wasted time!!

,FFrozTT,2010-09-07T18:45Z,"So far all of the instructions I have seen do not work unless tweaked a little bit, and even then there are some major issues here.

Getting the regular Sims 3 installed is easy enough and it works, the expansions, particularly Ambitions is a little more difficult. All of the instructions indicate you need to update and patch the expansions, but fail to mention that the cracks that come with the iso torrents are not for the updated version, just the version released in the torrent, and even then my game would crash to desktop every time I issued a command to a sim after installing expansions(as instructed by user comments).  So you have to go to gamecopyworld and get the latest cracks for whatever version you update your expansions to.  There is another major problem here... So far I have encountered several viruses, particularly with any 'extras' from ViTALiTY. Original Sims 3 installer keygen is infected. Also most of the Cracks from gamecopyworld are also infected. I managed to catch 2 of them in a VM which saved me but then I got careless with the Ambitions expansion and infected 2 machines (crack from gamecopyworld v4.2.32 latest from ViTALiTY.) These viruses spawn hundreds of .exe's on your machine and make outbound internet connections, and download fake AV software, Downloaders, Backdoors and malware. All of this despite having AV software installed on both machines, Avast and Symantec Corporate, neither detected the virus until after I launced the ambitions cracked exe (the virus is packed and obfuscated inside the TS3SP02.exe making it virtually undetectable.) Now I have to rebuild 2 systems which is not worth the $130 it would have cost me to purchase TS3 with expansions, which is what I'm going to do now. I'm not an anti-piracy advocate but I would like to warn others about wasting their time with viruses.

Coz when you upgrade, files are updated and overwritten/replaced with new ones. These torrent expansions for sims are cracked, and cracked with the files as they are when u install.

,miketheratguy,2011-09-15T08:11Z,"I'm using a retail copy of the base game but all the expansions, including this one, are cracked. I'll explain how. REMEMBER! I'm using a retail copy of the Sims 3. This might not work for everyone.


0: Find out what the latest version of the Sims 3 BASE GAME is (not the expansions) and using either the torrent sites or one of the crack / image sites, download a separate crack for it.

1: Install base game. DO NOT CRACK. Open the Sims 3 launcher and have the game update to the newest version.

2: Once the base game is installed, copy the TS3W exe and TSLHelp dll files that are in The Sims 3\Game\Bin. Paste them in a folder somewhere safe and easy to find. You might want to label the folder something like ""my original exe"".

3: Install any expansion, including this one. The order does NOT matter. DO NOT CRACK.

4: Like you did with the base game, run the Sims 3 launcher and have it update. Your game might not need any new updates, which is fine. Do the install / update process with each expansion you want to install, one at a time. DO NOT CRACK.

5: Making sure you still have a copy of the game's original exe in the folder you made, take the separate crack that you downloaded in step 0 and put it in the game's install folder which will be in Game\Bin of the base game, NOT the expansions. You DO NOT mess with the expansion folders at all. When you add the cracked exe (which should also have that TSLHelper.dll with it), overwrite the contents if it asks.

Now, the game and expansions should play just fine.


==========================
==========================

Should you have the game and cracked expansions running and then come across another expansion, you just reverse the process- making sure that you still have a copy of the CRACK, you copy the original exe and dll into the game\bin folder, install the expansion, and update it. Then when that's done, you swap the crack back in. I've done this with each expansion and it works fine for me.

Good luck."

,kandi1988,2011-09-24T03:59Z,i dont understand when you say copy the files..what are the exact names of the files to copy?? there aren't any files named crack or sims 3.
,holyheart,2011-10-24T18:35Z,"Heres all the awnsers you need.

NO you dont need the serial from here, you can try googling it.

NO you dont need to multi crack it, if you have a later expansion and a crack, it would do fine.

NO You cant patch to 1.2.7 YET, there arent any cracks.

Steps:

1. Install, if so, let it seed.

2. Mount the iso, Mac users just need to click.

3. Install using a serial.

4. Look at game version, remember this.


5. Go to google, and look up a crack according to your version e.g: The sims 3 ambitions 3.4.
(IF YOU HAVE CRACKED THE SIMS LATE NIGHT OR A LATER EXPANSION, PASS THIS.)

6. Follow the instructions on the crack's label.

Test run the installer.

If it fails at the beginning: You failed completely.
If it fails Before logging into a world:
Youre partially right, but not fully.

If none of these things happen: Its successfully cracked, give yourself a pat on the back.

Make sure its an .iso file, if it isnt, you can get seriously confused.

Good Luck!

Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly

it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!
