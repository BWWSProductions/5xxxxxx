[V],80zforever,2010-06-03T20:00Z,"kabalizo 4eva indeed!

papakeno, his voice is so soothing, and the synth a killer, ain't that right?"
[V],80zforever,2010-06-04T01:07Z,"papakeno, looks like you and kabalizo are the only people who liked this mix lol"
,rtrifunov,2010-06-04T12:28Z,"No, 80z, they are not the only ones lol. I've had a chance to hear the compilation only today. It's as good as your other compilations. I liked Love and Money - Jocelyn Square (1988) the most. I've just found on Wiki that a remaster edition of the album Strange Kind of Love (1988) was issued less than 2 months ago. 
Continue with your fabulous uploads. We'll never abandon you xD  "

[V],80zforever,2010-06-12T06:01Z,WHO is interested in vol. 49???
,Trailblades,2010-06-12T14:26Z,"Hey...Got a question for you...I'm looking for a song, don't know the group but in it's lyrics there's a line with ""Flying the friendly skies"" and the songs about a guy and a girl going on an ocean or island vacation. It's from 1987-1989... I'm not sure. Do you know this song, and if so what's the groups name. PLEASE let me know if you know :-)"
,z-nith,2010-06-13T22:52Z,"Hey 80zforever...You have proven yourself to be one of the most, if not the most, generous uploaders in the new wave/alt.80s/synth genre...and I THANK YOU for that. These last few mixes have been first-rate just like the earlier ones. The Rupert Hine single, Hubert Kah, Gary Myrick, Harry, etc etc it's all so damn good. (!!) cheers, man."

[V],80zforever,2010-06-14T07:35Z,"Trailblades, give us a little bit more clue man! You are dealing with an old man with dementia here hahahaha.

z-nith happy you liked it."
,arl0011,2010-06-15T13:26Z,"hey 80z, happen to have 'paper heroes'?
thanks!"
,Trailblades,2010-06-15T19:14Z,"I wish I could!!! All I can remember was it was a man and woman duet, and she was singing background vocals. I saw a video of the same song on MTV that same year, but that's all I can remember... P.S. Yeah... I'm getting a little old myself... That's probibly why I can't remember! :-)"
[V],80zforever,2010-06-15T22:47Z,"arl0011, do you mean the song Paper Heroes by Krew? if that's the one then it's on vol. 28.  As far as I know there was no band by the name of Paper Heroes??"
,Trailblades,2010-06-16T16:09Z,"Hey ... Got one more question for ya... Do you know who ""Originally"" did the song ""Birds Of Prey""...My wife says that every copy I got is wrong...especially the beginning..."
,smurphyzeke,2011-03-05T02:08Z,Thanks
