Jump-ins (Scene released 720p only) usually are XviD (because downloaders do not know what my mp4 looks like). I have so many insults for XviD fans who doesn't know how old and obsolete XviD is, and doesn't know that they have watched dozens of my XviD encodings from years before (I do not ""exist"" just couple of months)."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-01T10:22Z,"err.
for XviD = from XviD"
[T],houruoha,2010-06-01T10:35Z,"hehehe

,thedutchess,2010-06-03T08:45Z,ok... this may be a dumb question... but i have to ask.  What would cause a seeder of a torrent (this torrent) who has been seeding for 2 days with no upload limits to still be at only .020 share ratio when other torrents are uploading normally?
