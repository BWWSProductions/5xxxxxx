Anybody who does a little bit of research will find not on only grasping holes in his theories (disguised as historical facts), but horrible disregard for human life.

My jaws litteraly dropped as the ""professor"" literally framed Salvador Allende as a marxist, only to latter justify the terryfing dictatorship (and its thousands of murdered and tortured) of Pinochet by the fact that it led to the perfect neo-con society that suposedly became Chili after Pinochet had to wthdraw, and some neo-con therist decided to made it their Guinea-Pig."

As someone said, 'Anyone who is not a Socialist before they are 30, has no heart; anyone who is still a Socialist after they are 30 has no brain.' One cannot dismiss an historian as devastating as Ferguson with a cheap appellation like 'neo-con'. One has to rebut his arguments."

Not much about the creation or creature from Jekyll Island that created the Fed Reserve that Jefferson warned all of us about. Anyhow, these Machiavellians will no doubt, re-write history to justify their means to reach their ends"
