[T],nskid11,2010-06-04T08:44Z,"You could be right, although my TV Guild does say last episode in the current serise my DVR has saved the info with ""Another chance to see"" in it."
,dahauk,2010-06-09T04:58Z,"no 'chance' about it, i've got the previous shows on my computer and ran thru them till I figured out what this was. New series shows have Matt Smith/Doctor Who in the opening credits, first series had David Tennant. The UK Channel this plays on lists last week's #207 subject as 'crime'. I truly hope someone captured the correct show and will post it. Is there the chance they didn't play a new show for some reason and repeated this episode as a replacement? Which means this week it might be a new show? Please watch for it!"
[T],nskid11,2010-06-09T19:38Z,"From what I'm told its not on till next week, it was postponed due to the Cumbria shootings."
,dahauk,2010-06-10T19:22Z,"Yeah, you're right. The website sez the 16th. 
My heart goes out to those in Cumbria whose lives were torn by that loony."
,Enterhase,2010-06-13T21:08Z,"According to the Channel 4 website, Ep 07 is a Kids' TV Special. Guests are Chris Addison, Mark Watson and Holly Walsh."
