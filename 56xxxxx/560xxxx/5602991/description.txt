Named for the South American practice of dropping bodies out of airplanes over the open ocean and recorded amid a haze of distortion and post-punk angst this nine song album paints a portrait of the hollowness inherent in modern life.  Bright Eyes vocalist Conor Oberst leads an all-star group of Omaha musicians to produce an album that echos the alternative rock that was popular when they were growing up.  The lyrics rage against suburban sprawl, capitalist excess and the dissociative worship of blind consumerism. Recommended for anyone who liked At the Drive In.
