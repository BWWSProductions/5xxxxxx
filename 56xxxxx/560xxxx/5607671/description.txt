 :::::[ PLOT SUMMARY ]:::::
 
                                                                       
   In the 1950's and 60s, Henri-Georges Clouzot was one of France's    
   most acclaimed and successful filmmakers, a director who enjoyed    
   massive international success with LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR (aka THE   
   WAGES OF FEAR) and LES DIABOLIQUES, and his gift for generating     
   tension and suspense on screen earned him the nickname 'the French  
   Hitchcock'. 1963, Clouzot began work on a project called L'ENFER    
   (aka THE INFERNO), a tale of jealousy that leads to madness, and    
   the filmmaker was promised all time and resources he needed for     
   the picture. However, while the director was meticulously prepared  
   when shooting began, after only three weeks the production was      
   halted and never resumed; Clouzot would complete only two more      
   films before his death in 1977. Filmmakers Serge Bromberg and       
   Ruxandra Medrea try to answer the question of what happened to a    
   project so full of promise in HENRI-GEORGES CLOUZOT'S INFERNO, a    
   documentary which looks into the shadowy history of this lost       
   film. Including interviews with members of the cast and crew and    
   excerpts from the surviving footage, the film tells the tale of     
   how a great director ran afoul of his own demons while making a     
   movie about a troubled man.
