,aldrinstryder,2010-06-02T09:37Z,how's the movie?
,superbanned,2010-06-02T11:30Z,"yay, another P.O.S movie by Uwe Boll"
,wanbo,2010-06-03T00:59Z,"Uwe Boll is well known for making shite but this movie is fucking awesome, he has redeemed himself big time.
Well done dude!!!
This is violence to the extreme...watch while you can.

@ Skeelz  and superbanned:-
Don't slag off a movie you haven't even seen!"
,IMpapawheelie,2010-06-03T03:16Z,"Thanks for another great movie! Could you please upload ""Gang of Roses'"""
,born2b,2010-06-03T12:16Z,Thanks!
,Kristo-,2010-06-03T13:20Z,"An excellent movie by Uwe, respect to raymond for uploading!
Excellent A/V quality and the movie itself is very good."
,hatebreeder80,2010-06-04T01:03Z,"Fuckin badass movie
nice quality too
thanks alot dude. ill keep seeding a few days"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-04T07:30Z,"Considering this was made by Uwe Boll, this was quite good actually. The acting does seem a bite nervous and stressed out, but I'm betting Uwe is like a with ADHD on the set, so he might be freaking his actors out :D Interesting little flick.

A/7
V/6

The ripper failed to do a proper inverse telecine, so you get every 4th frame twice, giving you stuttering, although it's not as distracting as you'd think."
,Twopenceworthless,2010-06-04T19:31Z,"Good rip .. as for the ""every 4th frame"" comment - most of the movie is done in hand cams - so not really noticable. But takes a good eye to pick it up. I guess.

V:9
M:4 - Really ... 4. "
,skyfire,2010-06-05T19:50Z,"good qualite. 

but the movie... WTF cant uwe boll use stativ to his cameras or something... ffs bad director bad movie and Uwe Boll may burn in hell for his lousy movies"
,jommoe,2010-06-06T01:51Z,"Man, have I been longing to see this one, thank you raymondhome for the up! :D
Oh, and to all you nay-sayers out there. Uwe is god reincarnated. Accept it, or prepare to be laid to waste by his oh so mighty German fist!"
,inspiratieloos,2010-06-06T14:15Z,"a: 9

what's up with the shaky cam film-technique these days????
in this movie it's used so many times, your drunk and annoyed halfway trough. 

in my opinion, it's much cheaper than using real special effects or an alternative for good acting. in this case maybe both :p

in general not a bad movie..."
,IMpapawheelie,2010-06-08T01:44Z,"This movie is still encrypted, and won't burn to dvd, without the diagonal rip.. disappointing!"
,tmz05,2010-06-08T09:39Z,"So  Good ....

,akdadjamabir5,2011-09-14T00:52Z,"kind of a twisted movie, but pretty good at building anticipation. also, ""Love for All and Sharing is the first step to solving all the problems of humanity"" - thats so weak, its pirating, get over it"
