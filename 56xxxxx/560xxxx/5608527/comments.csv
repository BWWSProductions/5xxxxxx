The standard for HQ releases is using the H264 codec and the AVI file format doesn't support that, so no use in complaining about individual releases. Take 5 minutes to read wikipedia or similar reference in the future before complaining that rain is wet.

I have one advice though, use PS3 Media server on Windows to convert just about any format to something which works great with the PS3. That way you can download the files using MKV-container and still view them on the playstation."

 Errr, yes it does.  AVI can use the H264 codec, that is a FACT.

 I have encoded multiple videos in the past that have been AVIs with the H264 codec, Virtual dub can do it with no worries.

 Yes its not as good as an MP4 or an MKV but it does work, and a perfectly decent video can be made that way."
,s20dan,2010-06-08T21:49Z,ps thanks eztv
