In preparation for a visit from Uncle Vernon Dursley's client, the Dursleys
banish Harry in his room. There, Harry finds Dobby the house elf, who
warns against returning to Hogwarts. When Harry refuses, Dobby frames
Harry for ruining Vernon's meeting. Furious, Vernon locks Harry in his
room to prevent his return to Hogwarts. Ron, Fred, and George Weasley
arrive in their flying car to rescue Harry and take him back to The Burrow,
their home. Harry meets Ron's younger sister, Ginny, who is about to
begin at Hogwarts and has developed a crush on Harry. Harry also meets
Ron's father, Arthur Weasley; he had met Mrs. Weasley the previous
year. Soon after, Harry and the Weasleys travel to Diagon Alley by Floo
Powder. Harry accidentally mispronounces "Diagon Alley", and lands in
Knockturn Alley. Fortunately, Hagrid happens upon him and reunites him
with the Weasleys and Hermione. While shopping, Harry meets Gilderoy
Lockhart, a famous wizard and author, and later Draco Malfoy and his
father, Lucius, who praise Voldemort and deride Harry, Hermione, and
the Weasleys.
