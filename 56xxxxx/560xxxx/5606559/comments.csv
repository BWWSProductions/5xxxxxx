,xiIix,2010-06-04T06:12Z,"Most cracks and torrents will sound off, you need to learn when it's legit and when it's a false positive. Could be legit, I haven't looked at it, but it's not hard to figure out. Use good judgement and you'll be fine. Let your AV do all the thinking for you and you're going to be deleting a ton of harmless torrents."

,OmniNegro,2010-06-04T08:12Z,"xiIix, I could not agree more. Upwards of 99% of malware is simply obvious. This is a release. It is released by a well known group. If it were a fake release there would be hundreds of posts about it being a fake. There is honor among thieves.

Trust the groups that have established a name for themselves. Do not trust retarded antiviral programs that make money by making you live in fear.

Try Clamwin. It is not automated. It does not take over and tell you what you can and can not do. It is freeware as well.

Do not believe that your AV is better because they say so. Do not believe they are better because they report more positives. Believe they are better only if they can actually prove it.
/rant off
Have a nice day."
,masterfaster2,2010-06-04T08:31Z,"This is the original scene release, so it is safe."
,tmtmac,2010-06-04T09:44Z,"@crack with virus note,
aside from knowing how to scan,
it's also a must that you UNDERSTAND what the scan meant.
often, cracked exe's from these rlsgroups are packed in their own favorite way, 
so that other teams would not steal their release.

more often than not, anti-viruses, even those at virustotal fail to extract and analyze the code inside the executable. they can't unpack it properly, hence they report it to you, with their thinking ""why the hell can't we open this shit""

Malware-gen = generic/packed/they cannot open it
Packed/Win32.xxx=generic win32 packed, they can't open it
nsanti detects =Files detected as Packer.Malware.NSAnti.K are programs that had been packed/protected with a protection system  (packer/protector)

it's there for the a reason to protect itself, not to hide or cloak itself as malware.

this is an original rls, in rarset.
so it's CLEAN, otherwise no-one would support skidrow for tarnished rls.
hey have been around for ages.
skidrow ftw!"

,Amaximus,2010-06-05T00:02Z,"Avast, G-Data almost are never in the games false  positives. There are usual suspects and they are not on that list. Seems fishy. (also Semantic, almost as good.)"
,Tilatus,2010-06-05T02:57Z,"It's the steam.dll that gives the false positive. Of course it does, it cracks the steam launcher. Just put the folder into the ignore list and there are no problems. It is NOT a virus."
,sabelstorm,2010-06-05T12:22Z,Is it just me or is this a trail version because i cant gett storymode to work and the game annoingly tells me to purshase the real game
,matelian,2010-06-05T14:05Z,"@ tmtmac 
good point u have there, and thnx for explaining this, but why exactly the last 2 games cracked by SkidRow have a virus in there cracked dll ( Alpha Protocol, Alien Breed Impact ) I really like SkidRow's work for all the games they cracked but what happened recently that made dlls look infected"
,makerof,2010-06-05T22:20Z,"Program can't start because ""cudart32_30_9.dll"" wasn't found.

Anyone else got this?

Or do we have missing files in the package?"
,Urban_Ninja,2010-06-06T22:14Z,"I did exactly what skidrow said in the text for how to crack the game, but when i run the game then a small blue alienbreed window apear and the program stops to reply. It just dot do anything beside showing this mini screen."
,eriks14042,2010-06-07T09:02Z,"well,you can't know if there is a virus for use unless you've risked it yourself :D. game is nice,everything works fine,thank you."
,mrpras,2010-06-07T18:44Z,"I can't get past the first level either.. Needs to be recracked maybe?

regarding malware - a crack or cracked nocd exe IS malware.. It's been hacked to get around the protection.

You do risk a virus because someone can take the cracked exe, stick a virus on it and you might think it's a false positive when it's actually real.

This, like most scene releases, probably isn't that. But if you aren't sure and don't want to risk it, go and buy the game!"

,Urban_Ninja,2010-06-08T00:12Z,"Iam turning in to hulk now !!!! 
ANGER HATE FRUSTRATION...RRRR AAARGG !!

Why the hell wont this game work ?

1 - I install it to my game folder

3 - I copy the files in skidrow folder to the binary folder, bot steam keeps loading and the game tell sme steam need to run.

4 I tryed the crack fix were i copy the whole binary folder to the game binary folder were i installed it.
5 The splash screen starts to load and it keeps loading for ages until the program dosent reply..WTF is wrong here ?????

,hatrick34,2010-06-08T17:36Z,"Ok for some reason whenever I reach the internext thingy (forgot the name of that computer thingy in-game) when I try to save, it just get stuck on constant saving, so it goes like this : Saving progress Please Wait....

And it doesn't go past that"
,Urban_Ninja,2010-06-08T20:11Z,Skidrow always fail to crack games...alien vs predator was also a huge pile BS from skidrow.
,dsafjaly69,2010-06-09T16:04Z,"Works fine, with the crackfix. No problems.  My antivirus kept quarantining my Steamclient.dll, so maybe thats the problem others are having.

However, not sure if its just me or a bug in the game, but when you get to what appears to be the end of level 2 the boss is a Mauler and I can't kill it. I have tried everything I can think of, but no joy, so if anyone out there has managed to do it, let us know how."
,Urban_Ninja,2010-06-10T00:12Z,Should anyone come with a fix or workround to fix the not responding game then be my guest !
,jasta07,2010-06-15T14:12Z,"The instructions for this are not very good.

I got a bunch of DLL problems and the issue with the nothing happening after the splash screen as well.

Unpack the crack to the Binaries directory and it fixes everything - pretty sure you still need the new crack though."
,xJ3izzaros,2010-06-19T16:52Z,Can anybody help? I can't mount the game. Im using vista.
,Hmoobphajej,2010-06-30T06:43Z, Well all I have to say is this download contains a virus. Well at least only one that I can tell from and about 4 spy wares. How do i know this? I tried installing this and my web browser changed. When i opened it up it had a bing search bar... I don't use bing. It also had two update add-ons in my firefox add-ons that I never installed. And you know what the funny thing was? The crack didn't come up as a virus. But another .exe file was being pinged as one. It's even weirder that the .nfo file disappeared when I moved the pinged file into my chest. I'm not saying I don't trust skidrow... i'm saying I don't trust this uploader. Grab it from someone else. Even better grab it from somewhere else. 
,zlic_yo,2010-06-30T20:19Z,"This game is boring. It has some nice graphics, audio is average and gameplay is below average. Do try to find something better, Alien Breed is not fun, unless you enjoy being irritated all the way.

PS. Story is pointless (there is a story?)"
,acetst,2010-07-04T03:48Z,Why i get a trojan alert with this sh1t?
