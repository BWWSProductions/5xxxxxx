The Henry Clay People - Somewhere On The Golden Coast (2010)



***Plus Daytrotter Session May 15, 2010***





LA-based the Henry Clay People came together when brothers Joey and Andy Siara, tired of donning leisure suits and playing for drunk college students, decided to form a band that focuses more on songwriting and less on showy aesthetic. The result is an indie rock band that combines 70s rock and punk influences.



he Henry Clay People formed in 2005 in Glendale, CA. They've played hundreds of shows, have toured the United States multiple times, and have performed at Lollapalooza, SXSW, Austin City Limits Festival, and Sasquatch Music Festival.

Their album Blacklist the Kid with the Red Moustache was recorded in Portland and Montreal in 2006 by Colin Stewart and Howard Bilerman and was self released in 2007. Their next album For Cheap or For Free was recorded in 2008 in Los Angeles by Dave Newton and Joe Napolitano and released in November 2008 on Autumn Tone Records, an indie label started by the music blog Aquarium Drunkard. In March of 2010 they announced that their next record will be released June 8th on TBD Records.
