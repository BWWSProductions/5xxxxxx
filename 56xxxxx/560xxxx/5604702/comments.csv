,ciccarello,2010-07-03T17:38Z,"this is the actual pokemon green, from japan not a hack of blue
the only problem is the SHITTTTY!!! translation
i dont mean pound being spelled pond... i mean thundershock being called electromagnet, quick attack - sharpness, night shade - leader, confuse ray - suspect flame

you can tell its the actual japanese game because it provides 5 spaces for your/your pokemon's names - which brings its own problems
pokemon names arent shortened -.-  they a murdered, so much so that they dont resemble the english or the japan counterparts
scyther - score
bicac - pikachu
labla - lapras
fushi - bulbasaur (does actually represent the japanese name ????? - fushigidane)

would much rather have the full japanese green then this half ass'd translated piece of shit"
