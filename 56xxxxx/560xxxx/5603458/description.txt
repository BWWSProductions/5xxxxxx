[color=pink]Notes::::::::::::::::::[/color]
well....heres the new russian source of persia, video was pretty good, bad crop but still pretty good for what it is
this was also orange aswell, which leads me to believe that it supposed to be kinda orange, because some scenes were
normal color, so i just toned down to orange slightly this time, and added some other filters, came out little small
but bitrate is still pretty good, imagines line audio thnx...anyway enjoy the movie //prism
