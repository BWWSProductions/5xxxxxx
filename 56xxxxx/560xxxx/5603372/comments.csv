,Brat001,2010-06-03T03:20Z,well if you're going to be that particular you could just buy or rent the dvd and do it yourself :) beggers can't be choosers when you're trying to get something for NOTHING.
[V],room101bellboy,2010-06-03T13:37Z,"@ kash79: ""The Way of the Gun"" seems to be one of those underrated littles gems and there is no 720p H264 encode of it yet. 

I'll try to encode it but I'll need a week or so as I am extremely busy at work these days and got two encodes ready for upload, too. 

I'll post a comment in your last torrent to let you know when it's done.
