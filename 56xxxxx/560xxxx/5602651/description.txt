PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players,
making for a truly challenging experience that will constantly test the
player. Intuitive zonal defending will cover spaces and players need to
look constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real
football simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick
reactions, as in real life. In addition to key out-field elements,
goalkeepers are more versatile and with abilities matching those of
modern shot-stoppers. The games referees have also been reworked, with
smarter AI elements allowing them to make more balanced calls during
matches.
