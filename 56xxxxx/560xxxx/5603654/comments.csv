The ""Serious Error"" problem?

Cheers."
,Flazhp0intX,2010-06-02T11:48Z,Oh sorry don't mention my comment. Had not seen you uploaded Generals before. :)
,jimbus80,2010-06-02T14:19Z,"oh, much easier than that: get this english version of both games (although the page is in spanish); just install and play:

lmao...

They can never Beat Back a Direct Play Torrent./...
Cuz It's Just To Extract and Play... The Only Problem That I Had With This Torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5530823/Command_and_Conquer_Generals___Zero_Hour_%28DIRECT_PLAY%29__%5Bblaze69

Is I ave Missed Out A Few Things In The Registry.... So This Torrent Is The Fix For It... And Also My Version Is Patched To The Latest :)"
,Alysse,2010-06-08T03:31Z,"I'm having trouble finding the #support# folder.  Is it under the C&C Generals file location, or regedit? I see a folder named ""Support"" in my Generals file, but that folder doesn't have ""Delete_game_From_Registry."" I don't even see this game in Regedit for some reason.

Thanks again"
,Alysse,2010-06-08T03:50Z,"Ignore that, I found it."
,nickhead78,2010-06-16T03:34Z,where do i find support
,smooz,2010-07-02T05:15Z,"i followed all instructions the problem still there :(

,smooz,2010-07-02T05:27Z,wait i apologize i copied the regfix inn wrong folder lol sorry its working like a charm thanks :D
,Milkyman99,2010-07-06T11:46Z,"Thx for this torrent, it works fine.
But there's a problem with trainers for the game. When you first press the hotkey for a cheat you'll get a serious error and the game shuts down. Normally i wouldn't mind but I'm at mission 3 of China on hard difficulty...
Could you make a trainer for this direct play, or could you fix the problem?
thx in advance"
,bluesss2,2010-07-17T13:55Z,I cant start Zero Hour
,c_to_ssy,2010-07-19T23:28Z,"blaze-69, thanks for the upload , and i manage to get it working however, i have the game on both of my laptops so whenever I try to play ZH on lan it says my serial keys in use. I overcame the problem with generals with a key changer but i dont think theres one for ZH. so just wondering if there are ways to get round this. thanks in advance"
