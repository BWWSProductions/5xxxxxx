NOTE: The Wii MotionPlus accessory is required for gameplay. 

The original Red Steel redefined swordplay when the Wii launched. The sequel does it again, harnessing Wii MotionPlus controls to create even more realistic swordplay. Specially designed to take full advantage of MotionPlus, Red Steel 2 takes you to a high-tech, desert metropolis where there is only one rule: be ready to fight. You'll go beyond feverish slashing with fine-tuned, precision movements. Pivot your wrist, and your sword pivots on screen. Swing in any direction, carving enemies up any way you like. And the game doesn't just factor in where you're swinging, it measures how hard. Bleed your enemies one cut at time, or finish them with powerful strokes.
