[V],Zen_Bud,2010-06-01T09:16Z,@shango Thx for this UL :o)
,bachrocks,2010-06-01T14:13Z,Thank you! And thanks again for sharing your scifi movie list. Any possibility you could share Westworld? That is a dynamite movie.
,shango,2010-06-01T15:02Z,Anyone know how to get this to show up at demonoid too? Do I need to upload it there? Will the seeders from here show up? I have the demonoid tracker added as well as the file in the torrent.
,shango,2010-06-01T15:07Z,I am going to upload easy rider next. I have the mysilu version which no one is seeding anymore but I also have the full untouched dvd with extras. I would rather not upload both as that is 15gb but I thought maybe people would like the extras. I guess I could just share both as this is a special reason to upload them.
,shango,2010-06-01T17:50Z,"Thanks.

What is everyones opinion about Easy Rider? I would like to get that started soon."
