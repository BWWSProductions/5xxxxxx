PART TWO: 'BLUE SNOW'
A publishing editor and his lover. A dead prostitute. A butcher who moonlights as a drug dealer. A social worker. A humanitarian. And ... Charlotte Garland, a graphologist, who assists the police. All an eclectic group of people, who have one thing in common - ties to the murderer the press has dubbed, 'The Writer.'
