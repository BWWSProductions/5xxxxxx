NCIS Season 7 (complete)

Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs is the leader of a team of special agents belonging to the NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) Major Case Response Team. Gibbs, a former Marine, is a tough investigator and a highly skilled interrogator who relies on his gut instinct as much as evidence. Gibbs' second in command is Senior Field Agent Tony DiNozzo, a womanizing, movie-quoting former Baltimore Homicide Detective, who despite being the class clown always gets the job done. The team also consists of Officer Ziva David, a Mossad officer who is a skilled fighter, as well as Junior Field Agent Timothy McGee, a computer-savvy agent often mocked by DiNozzo. Assisting them are Abby Sciuto, the energetic-but-Goth lab tech who is like a daughter to Gibbs, and Dr. Donald Mallard, nicknamed Ducky, the eccentric medical examiner full of unusual stories. This team of elite agents, based in Washington, D.C., solve criminal cases involving Marine and Navy personnel and their families, sometimes traveling the United States - or the world - to do it. 

If you haven't seen other seasons yet, you should consider to start at the beginning (meaning get season 1 and start there), as the series lives from the characters and their development throughout the whole series and is far more enjoyable if you know, what's going on!

All files properly named, keeping the original filenames intact, I don't take credit for what I didn't do! This pack wouldn't have been possible without eztv, VTV, TvTeam, thank you all!

Please be patient, uploadspeed is 1Mbit, which means after 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.
