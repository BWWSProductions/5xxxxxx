Watergate 05 is a single disc, 16-track affair that cuts a somewhat breezier figure than her previous commercially available mix efforts for fabric and BPitch's Boogy Bytes series. John Tejada, Luciano, Alexi Delano and Royksopp all make the grade on this occasion, while the sound of her own imprint comes under representation from Aerea Negrot and AGF/Delay. In a similar twist to Sebo K remixing Martyn's "Elden St" on the last installment, Allien sets to work on Uffie's "Pop The Glock," a cut that saw the light of day exclusively on digital download store Beatport in the middle of November.
