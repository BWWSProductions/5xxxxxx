Strategic visionary Jim Channon discussed how to build Global Social Intelligence through various principles, as well as breakthroughs that will guide our planet toward a brighter future. Modern is not necessarily better-- cherry pick from the past, he suggested. For instance, wood can be a more appealing material to build a home with than concrete or steel, Channon remarked, adding that his "eco-homestead of the future" houses 12 other people, as extended families can create a more robust experience. 

One of the biggest and most important shifts is for people to see the Earth as paradise, and for humanity to recognize its global unity, he said. A number of breakthroughs could be accomplished by reassigning the military to handle various tasks, including reforestation, cleaning the water sheds, recycling the flotsam in the sea, protecting the coral reefs and inland water ways, as well as monitoring pollution from space-based platforms, he continued. "We're not saving the Earth-- we're saving the biosphere," Channon explained. 

Other breakthroughs he presented included the government decentralizing into bioregions, web-based democracies, as well as recognizing there is life beyond our solar system and building a starport to prepare for them. "We want to go past success to significance," Channon commented. He also touched on his background in remote viewing while in the US Army, and noted that he'll be a speaker at the upcoming Remote Viewing Conference in Las Vegas. 

Underground Shelters
First hour guest, entrepreneur Robert Vicino talked about the Vivos Project, a network of nuclear blast-proof underground shelters. Their plan is to build 20 such shelters, that will accommodate 4,000 people, who pay $50,000 ($25,000 for children) each to buy in. The secret, high altitude, locations for the shelters will be around 150 miles from each metro area, and stocked with one year of food and supplies, he said.
