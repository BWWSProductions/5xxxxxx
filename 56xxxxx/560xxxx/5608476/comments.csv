,sole420,2010-08-03T14:53Z,Thanks for ul.  And just b/c its 700mb doesn't mean its not ripped from a bluray

,just_sham,2010-08-15T01:52Z,excellent quality
,demon_1987,2010-08-17T16:17Z,"@Porna420 This _is_ a BDRip, it just has higher compression. Therefor, the quality will be lower than a 4.5Gig rip, but still better than a DVDRip that is compressed to the same size."
