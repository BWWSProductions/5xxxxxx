I find much humor in idiots like holohoax.  MUCH, MUCH humor!  I can only hope that ""holohoax"" sticks around and entertains me more!!!   Its funny when someone full of hate fails miserably at convincing their audience, and gets the opposite reaction....LAUGHTER!!!   A gest offered in PITY!!!!"

,Twopenceworthless,2010-06-03T23:05Z,"Well .. no comments on the quality of the movie .... save one ... and it's too bad ... but if it is indeed a homosexually based plot ... I too must pass. Not for the ridiculous reasons I?ve read above ... but because I am strongly pro family. While I do believe there many fine people out there who profess same sex partnerships  -  it?s the lifestyle I cannot condone. And it is Hollywood?s mission to exploit controversy. Right now, the fad is homosexuality, it will change once people are bored. So ... will I be rude to a homosexual? Of coarse not. But I can politely refuse to accept that choice of lifestyle. 

So ? no quality details needed for this one. Thanks anyway."

I respect your beliefs..I have not seen the movie yet but I plan to give it a chance. It was actually based on a true story and based on the reviews it's getting it's an amazing movie. The point of commenting on here is not to put our religous beliefs on here it's to comment on the quality of the movie. If you're not going to see it please don't comment or preach to people.

Good quality rip. 

@ destructive - It's not about love. It's about the lies we tell ourselves. Don't want to spoil the movie for those who want to see it. 

@ Julia ... had to re-read what I posted. I don't believe I said anything about religion? And the term religion doesn't really carry much importance these days anyway. But I did watch it. And it is a well made movie with good acting (not great). And I think you know that public opinion doesn't make anything ""right"" or ""good"". And after watching the movie I can with more confidence say it's definately NOT a good story. Real life or not. And I appreciate your politeness. Just a suggestion in not telling people in they can or can't do on here. It's TPB ... all about expression. 

Thnx.

I do believe we can share opinions here as long as they are polite to all.

,WashingtonDC1911,2010-06-04T16:22Z,"@Twopenceworthless

You're just another homophobic. And whether or not you condone it .... NOBODY cares and needs your approval, so please keep your HOMOPHOBIC Christian values to yourself. Grow up and learn to respect and accept people for who and what they are as I'm sure gay people accept that there are homophobes like you walking around and thinking that what you believe is the right thing."
,model420,2010-06-04T19:22Z,"Thanks for the up BONE. 

@holohoax

you have a valid point that america is controlled by jews, look at the media people. Some of the most successful people in america are jewish, and their influence controls the flow of money...

But for fucks sake keep your damn hating to yourself, religious or sexual, people have the right to do what makes them happy."
,Twopenceworthless,2010-06-04T19:24Z,"@ DC

Why dont you take some of ur own advice. I dont disrespect anyone. Read my previous post. And why does everyone have to bring religion into a simple comment. I know people who are gay - I never disrespect them. They know how I feel. Doesn't mean we can't get along. Get a clue DC ... we all need to learn to live together. "

I don't believe for a minute that you have gay friends and if you did, guaranteed you haven't told them the beliefs you've stated here. they wouldn't  be your friends if you really thought that of them and they knew it. sorry, not happening.

,7thSense,2010-06-05T10:16Z,"homophobia is a silly term made up to belittle those who rightfully oppose unnatural relations. Anyways, the movie was a decent watch, the gayness was annoying, seeing the love life of two confused people. Funny hoe Carrey tries to make bold movie choices then this movie goes straight to DVD. Good choice Jim, do another Pet Detective film already and cut out the ""edgy"" crap  nobody cares about."

@ denial ... you're a piece of work. Whats does Homophobic mean to you? I have no fear of them or their lifestyle ... just disagree. What does bigot mean? You have no clue. BUT you are right - I should not have used the word friends.... should have said aquaintances. Point is we repsect each others points of view. And my POV is just that ... MINE! We all have them and we should all be able to share them.

Just one reflection about the comments. Why does homosexuality scare so many people??? If i see somehing i don't like i turn my head, end of story. 

And be careful, a study says that the worse of homophobs actually are gay themselves, they just don't know how to handle it so it turns into hate."

I'm not specifically looking for man-on-man action but I heard it was a good movies and would prefer seeing it as it was meant to be seen; just like I seek out director's cuts and would prefer not to see films shot at 16:9 in some other aspect ratio.
