Lars Nyheim:

Dj and producer Lars Nyheim was born in Norway in 1984. From early age Lars
 always loved electronic dance music. In the late 90s he discovered the trance 
genre and started collecting music and cdâ€™s. After some years he decided to
 buy turntables and started practising mixing. Soon after, he also started 
to produce his own tracks. After some years he teamed up with talented
 producer Tore Vatle Jensen and founded â€˜The Blizzardâ€™.

Tore Vatle Jensen:

Composer and keyboard player Tore Vatle Jensen was born in Norway in 1979.
 His musical preferences are everything from jazz, 70â€™s funk, hip hop, 
film scores and classical music to just about every electronic genre 
around. After being a bedroom producer for 12-13 years, with aliases such
 as â€˜Tinnitus Projectâ€™ and â€˜Koma Supraâ€™, he graduated as a sound engineer 
from NISS (Nordic Institute of Stage and Studio) in Oslo, Norway. Later that
 year (2006) he teamed up with Lars-Christian Nyheim and founded â€˜The Blizzardâ€™.
