He is revered in China as a Buddha, as the 'Schindler of Nanking'. But his deeds have barely been recognized in the West. The German John Rabe, a Siemens manager and fervent admirer of the 'FÃ¼hrer', saved the lives of more than 200,000 Chinese in 1937, when the occupying Japanese Army carried out mass shootings, rapes and brutal killings. Produced by Pro GmbH for ZDF and ZDF Enterprises, this film by Annette Baumeister takes a penetrating look at a man who was both profoundly humane - and a Nazi.
