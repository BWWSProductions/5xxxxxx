Herman's Hermits were an English rock band, formed in Manchester in 1963 as Herman & The Hermits. The group's management and producer, Mickie Most (who controlled the band's output), emphasized a simple, non-threatening and clean-cut image, although the band originally played R&B numbers. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s. Their first hit was "I'm Into Something Good" (written by US songwriters Gerry Goffin and Carole King), which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 13 in the US in 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but had two US No. 1's with "Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter" (originally sung by Tom Courtenay in a 1963 British TV play) and "I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am" (a British music hall song by Harry Champion dating from 1911). These songs were aimed at a US fan-base,
with Peter Noone exaggerating his Manchester accent; the band was not fond of either song and they were never released as singles in Britain.
And yes, Trevor Peacock, one of the writers of "Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter" is the very same who plays Jim "no, no, no, no" Trott in the Vicar of Dibley.
