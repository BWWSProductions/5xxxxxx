"C'mon and Get My Love" is the song by British dance producer D Mob, from his album A Little Bit of This, a Little Bit of That. It featured British singer Cathy Dennis, credited as "introducing" her. Even though it was not Dennis's first solo single, it established her as a major chart presence during the late 1980s to early 1990s.

The song peaked at #15 on the UK Singles Chart, which was quite moderate, considering the major Top 10 success she would achieve on this chart in the future. In the U.S., "C'mon and Get My Love" is the song most closely identified with D Mob, as the song crossed over to pop radio, and hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the American dance chart, becoming the biggest hit of D Mob's career, and jump-starting Dennis' career as a solo artist.

The song appeared in the film She-Devil, which starred Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr.

D Mob (or D-Mob) is one of the stage names used by British house music producer Dancin' Danny D (born Daniel Kojo Poku).

The 1988 UK hit "We Call It Acieed" hit #3 in the UK Singles Chart, and was one of a wave of acid house singles to enjoy success that year. D Mob went on to have a further three Top Twenty singles in the UK during 1989 and 1990, which were "It is Time to Get Funky", which reached #9, "C'mon and Get My Love", which reached #15, and "Put Your Hands Together", which reached #7.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s D Mob charted five songs on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, four of which went to #1, including "We Call It Acieed", "It's Time To Get Funky", "C'mon and Get My Love" (with Cathy Dennis), and "That's The Way Of The World" (also with Dennis). In the U.S. they are best known for the hit "C'mon and Get My Love", a song featuring vocalist Cathy Dennis, that crossed over to pop radio and hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1990.

Aside from Dennis, Danny D has collaborated with vocalists Gary Haisman and LRS.
