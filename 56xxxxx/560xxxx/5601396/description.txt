Sylvia was first produced at the Palais Garnier, Paris on 14 June 1876, 
four years after Delibes other big success, CoppÃ©lia. 
Of Delibesâ€™s Sylvia music, Tchaikovsky, who saw the ballet in Vienna in 1877, enthused, 
â€œIt is the first ballet in which the music constitutes not just the main but the only interest. 
What charm and elegance, what riches in the melody, the rhythm, the harmony. 
I was ashamed. If I had known this music before, I would not have written Swan Lake.â€. 
Praise indeed, but Tchaikovsky is being very hard on the other elements of this charming ballet based on classical mythology.
