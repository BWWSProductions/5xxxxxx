[T],thelad53,2010-06-03T18:08Z,"Thanks, i'm glad i upped this one because i watched it when i was about 6 but for all these years i couldn't find the film again as i didn't know what it was called. When i saw the screens for this i realised this was the film i saw all those years ago. Pretty scary film when your 6 yrs old. :D"

,rahkmo,2011-07-09T00:58Z,"I'm glad that you upped this one too! My girlfriend has been trying to remember the name of this movie for months..I just saw the trailer of the Katie Holmes version and asked her was this the movie that she's been talking about. I was also about 6 when i saw this..Thanks ""thelad"""
,rahkmo,2011-07-09T22:48Z,would you happen to have the 2010 version?
,kratol,2011-08-26T19:47Z,"For those wondering, this was obviously sourced from tape."
,intrinsically,2011-09-14T00:15Z,"Why hasn't anyone touched the 2011 version? 

Seriously, such a let down(and I mean by it not being here, not this version being bad)."
