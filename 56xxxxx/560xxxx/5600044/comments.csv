[V],Mbb15,2010-05-30T21:23Z,"AiTB, is there also a v1.1.2.0 EFLC update released?

Two new patches have been released, through Games For Windows Live, updating GTA IV to 1.0.7.0 and EFLC to 1.1.2.0. Here are the details of the new patches:
GTA IV: v1.0.7.0 / 1.0.6.1 (Russian) / 1.0.5.2 (Japanese)

fix a bug causing tree leaves to look transparent
fix a bug that prevented uploading of rendered videos to Social Club when attaching certain music tracks
fix for clip capture ""OFF"" slowdowns occuring when near waters edge
expose ""detonate"" in custom key mapping options menu for Grand Theft Auto IV, Lost and Damned so users can remap ""down"" arrow key

EFLC: v1.1.2.0

fix a bug causing tree leaves to look transparent
fix a bug that prevented uploading of rendered videos to Social Club when attaching music tracks from the Ballad of Gay Tony
fix for clip capture ""OFF"" slowdowns occuring when near waters edge
fix for slowdown occuring when getting in a boat during ""Sexy Time"" mission in The Ballad of Gay Tony
expose ""detonate"" in custom key mapping options menu for Lost and Damned so users can remap ""down"" arrow key
EFLC now has it's own settings file called ""SETTINGS_EFLC.CFG"" to avoid possible conflicts with GTA IV installations


THis is ony GTAIV and not EFLC I guess???"
[V],Mbb15,2010-05-30T21:40Z,"AiTB, sorry for you but I think this release is FAKE, Razor1911 didnt release this..."
,RobertinhoNIKE,2010-05-30T21:43Z,The update it`s only for GTA IV. Games For Windows forces you to update the game (EFLC) to 1.1.0.2 and now I can`t play the game (EFLC). But I have a original GFW key for the multiplayer so I have a GFW online account. I still wait the crack for EFLC. :(
[V],Mbb15,2010-05-30T21:53Z,"Hmm i dont know for sure, I cant find it on any scene release site"
,RobertinhoNIKE,2010-05-30T22:04Z,"The crack works because is the old crack form fourth update. I tried it and it works. I am using the first crack of GTA IV (december 2008) for all updates (all-7), and the game still works. LOL"
[V],Mbb15,2010-05-30T22:12Z,"@RobertinhoNIKE

Youre right, its not a fake but its not an official scene release, just a custom Razor1911 release that still works :)"

,GCInt,2010-06-23T21:53Z,"This torrent works perfectly for me, I feel much better with these performance improvements.

To be honest, I don't see the need to get rid of GFW. It's nice when you can create a new profile if a friend wants to play. All I've ever done was update the vanilla game to 1.0.4.0 with this crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4979250/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_v1.0.4.0_Update-RazorDOX-CrackOnly

Then I downloaded this torrent, extracted it, and ran UpdateTitle.exe. That's all I needed to do. Apparently the only copy protection is in LaunchGTAIV.exe, which was removed by the 1.0.4.0 torrent I downloaded earlier. It then launched my updated, but already cracked game for me :) How nice of Microsoft."

EDIT: Nevermind, after restarting my computer, GTAIV.exe continues to crash, no matter what. I guess this crack isn't legit."
,Chabs232,2010-07-16T13:50Z,"Does this update require a crack ? I can\'t find on at gamecopyworlds... They usually have em all ?nnOr is it like Far Cry 2 1.3\'s patch which removed the protection ?nnPlease explain, I don\'t want to reinstall that game again for nothing."
,vjudragon,2010-08-15T18:51Z,"This update is superb, reduced graphic card load by 40%-50% :)"
,vgvgvg7412,2010-10-19T22:32Z,"i repeat the same question as above, does it have crack?"
,vgvgvg7412,2010-10-20T11:36Z,"hmm,, i downloaded this & its UTTERLY CRAP. it decreases the performance by 20 fps. razor never released a crak for patch 1.0.7.0. 
the best performance i get till patch 1.0.5.0 

the last o patches r pathetic. "
,rocketman501,2010-10-25T21:09Z,some pc may run better on patch 1.0.0.4(1.0.5.0) than this patch..yeah fps droping!!
,RamonNZ,2010-12-14T10:51Z,"It took me a while to fix the ""The ordinal 5367 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll"" error.

Forget deleting xlive.dll, or even searching for it. 
Do this if you have that error: Install the latest version of Games for Windows - Live

Error goes away. Game plays."
,Artak323,2010-12-28T10:56Z,performance increased noticeably Thank you very much =]

,MrUbique,2012-02-12T20:33Z,"Works great, cheers!

@Pr0_GAMER you need to install the ""Games for Windows"" shit, just Google it...

If any of you use mods, don't use this. Anything past 1.0.4 and your mods will not work.

,xpmule,2012-05-01T08:21Z,"no you don't have to install previous patches, this is cumulative (includes the others patches)
Please pay attention too people, posting the errors you get with EFLC is kinda obvious.. This ain't for EFLC.. there is a separate crack for that, search for EFLC - Patch v1.1.2.0 - Razor1911
Also the guy that said some mods will not work after patch v1.04 is right, they added security checks with that patch that were not on the original shipping version"
,Viciously,2012-05-12T17:34Z,Thanks. I think I wrote my Thanks a long time ago. Fkn mods.
