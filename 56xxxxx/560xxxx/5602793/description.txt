PLOT SUMMARY
Scientist David Terran has written bestsellers about the dangers of Earth's magnetic fields, but his unconventional theories have made him a joke amongst his colleagues. Even his best friend, Martin Ward, refuses to take David's scientific ideas seriously. Denied the respect he deserves, David gives up on his career and retreats to a remote cabin to live out his days alone with his father. Meanwhile, halfway across the globe, the Iranian government has begun a series of rogue nuclear tests which unexpectedly sets into motion a series of dangerous events. A sudden spike in solar radiation and devastating earthquakes threatens to destroy all life on the planet. Desperate to do something, the US government calls on David for help. But the only way he can succeed is with the help of the friend who didn't believe in him. Now David and Martin must pull together to rebuild their friendship and save the world from total destruction.
