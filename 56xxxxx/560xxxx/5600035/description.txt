Duane Bradley is born horribly disfigured with a mutant siamese twin aptly named Belial attached to the side of his body.
When Duane is in his early teens his father orders a group of doctors to separate the twins and dispose of the monstrosity
attached to the side of his son. The operation's a success and Duane survives but Belial's been thrown away in the
trash - literally! - Duane finds him in the garbage and nurses him back to health. Reunited, the brothers go on with their
lives. Fast forward to present day when Duane's a young man travelling everywhere with his brother hidden away in a
wicker basket which he carries wherever he goes.

With a wad of bills in hand, Duane takes his brother to New York city on a mission to hunt down and destroy the doctors
who performed the operation on them when they were younger. Along the way he takes up lodging at the Hotel Broslin, a
nuthouse and dump of a hotel with the wackiest assortment of characters around who inhabit it's filth stained walls.

Directed by Frank Henenlotter, this low budget shocker's a blast from the get go and the gore is just great. 

Enjoy.
