During a visit to an art gallery with Amy, the Doctor's interest is caught by the painting The Church at Auvers by Vincent van Gogh: there's a face in the window of the church â€“ a curious, shadowed creepy face with nasty eyes. The Doctor is worried; he's sure he has seen the face somewhere before, but how? There is only one thing for it: a trip in the TARDIS back to 1888, so the Doctor can find out from the artist himself.

Formatted to work on iPods.

Just the file this time. When I tried to up it the first time, it kept reading as 0/0, so I had to make a different one.

Turns out this is 0/0 too. Odd.

To be honest, if you can find my copy of this on Demonoid, you're probably better off.
