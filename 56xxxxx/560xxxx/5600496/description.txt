This is a full untouched dvd ripped using anydvd. Please do your part and stop sharing 700mb and dvds ripped to fit on dvd5! This is 2010. People can learn how to shrink their own damn dvds and if you are still on dialup stop being a cheap fucker and get a job! If you dont own a dvd burner thats ridiculous.

I shared this after watching another 700mb rip get upped instead of a real dvd.

My scifi movie list: 
http://freetexthost.com/d3kg3o5t1x

These are the movies currently in my scifi directory. I have about 100 more to move around I just am fixing some stuff on my server. I have a lot of other really strange odd movies that I want to share as well. I thought I would hit a few sci fi movies for now but would take requests. I am not going to share the stuff that is easy to find or that is readily available through other torrents. I can make a list of my movie folder as well. I have my collection sorted by genre.

I will fix the image when bayimg comes back
