,subotai51,2010-06-04T19:32Z,Thanks a lot!  Been waiting for this!
,Gethyper,2010-06-04T23:34Z,"Looked at a couple of trailers ....it actually looks pretty good....strange we haven't seen any advertising or promotion in any sense of this movie in NL....It's the first time I am even hearing of this movie. 

Thanks for the upload"
,killerdriller666,2010-06-06T13:24Z,"Gethyper-> I guess you where to busy watching movies downloaded from the Pirate Bay ;)

No advertisement in the NL (Netherlands?) is not true. It was a lot in the media, only for about two weeks.

When it came to the cinema, Trailers in every commercial block of RTL and SBS6 and even sometime on NED1,2,3. Posters in bus-stops, full page advertisement in papers like Spits and Metro......

,Esmad3,2010-06-07T09:17Z,"Thats funny, in Denmark where I'm from this was a straight-to-dvd release with no advertising at all. If it wasn't for pirated movies I probably would never have heard of it, which would be a shame since this is a pretty decent movie."
,Rebellenclub,2010-06-08T10:59Z,"That's the price we pay for DL ;o)
We miss out on all the adveritsments on the commercial channels...
Rating on IMDB is ok. Think I'll enjoy this one."

,DogNo7,2010-07-14T01:15Z,"Whine whine whine.nnNothin finer than watching some tpb user wanks off over download speed, seeding, etc.nnWhine more, we really do listen, and the picosecond you bitch about seeding speeds, we all use our souper sekret high speed network to bring on terabits of capacity to the seeding process.nnWe take your whining seriously, and every time we see someone victimized by poor bandwidth, we each pick up a kitten and murder it in ritual sacrifice to the bandwidth gods.nnSo, please, tell us to seed more whenever you see poor performance.  Your happiness occupies our every waking thought.nn-DogNo7"
