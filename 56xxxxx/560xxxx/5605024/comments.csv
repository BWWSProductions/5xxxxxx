,flextm71,2010-08-26T23:58Z,"The dvd and bluray release date are a little over a week away, and they haven't been leaked yet?! WTF? "
,cotter22,2010-08-30T15:13Z,Why bother putting more cam copies up such a waste of server space. There's plenty of other bad copies on here why waste yours or our time? 
,Hayoob,2010-09-08T23:34Z,"There are DVDrips of this movie out there now, so there is no reason to download this cam version.
Screen & sound = 4/10 at most, barely watchable.

Thanks raymondhome for uploading this 3 months ago, before the DVD was out."
