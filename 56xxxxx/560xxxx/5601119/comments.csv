Video: Resolution is a scant 592x256 and while this looks fine if you leave it at that size, who does?  Playing full screen on a 1080p monitor the image is watchable but is full of artifacts and very smeary.  While this isn't meant to be a hi-res upload, I have seen much better quality at this file size.

Video: No complaints, sounds fine."
