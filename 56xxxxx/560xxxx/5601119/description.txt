As a young boy Frankie Mac (Kevin McKidd - Trainspotting) watches the world around him drench itself in alcohol. His father, who has always been an iconic figure to Frankie, is seen for the first time as a philandering liar. In his teenage years, Frankie leads a gang. They thrive on music, clothes and violence. A chance meeting with a young woman, Helen, introduces Frankie to a whole range of possibilities. He distances himself from the gang, which turns them against him, creating a fatal enemy in the shape of former gang member Miller. As his life starts to take a wrong turn, he falls back into the familiar pattern of violence and alcohol. As a man, Frankie finds new focus through group meetings and his role as an actor. He meets a new woman, Mary, who shows him how to be open and honest. A real sense of what his life could be begins to surface. But the shadow of the past is never far behind him and threatens once again to tear his life apart. -- Â© Tartan Video
