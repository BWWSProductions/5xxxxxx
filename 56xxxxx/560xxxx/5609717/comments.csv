Will you be posting Britain's Got More Talent ep12 as well?"
[V],verovenlo,2010-06-06T06:41Z,yes i will my friend after this tyorrent is finished
,weblurker,2010-06-06T06:53Z,"Thanks Verovenlo. You've been the backbone of the BGT and BGMT torrents.

I guess there will be two BGMT episodes, ep12 and ep13, so you'll be very busy seeding for the next while."

When do you start for More Talent?"
[V],verovenlo,2010-06-07T02:13Z,il start now
,weblurker,2010-06-07T03:54Z,"Thanks for posting the BGMT episodes Verovenlo.

@cybermsh : They aired the final show and the results show in one broadcast, with a couple of musical acts in between. So Verovenlo's upload is complete with both the acts and the results."
,cybermsh,2010-06-07T05:57Z,@weblurker : Thanks for response.I DL it and watch it last night.
