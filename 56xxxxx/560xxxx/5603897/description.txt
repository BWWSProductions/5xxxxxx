    Michael Mosley takes an informative and ambitious          
    journey exploring how the evolution of scientific         
    understanding is intimately interwoven with society's    
    historical path.                                          
                                                               
                                                              
    We now know that the brain - the organ that more than    
    any other makes us human - is one of the wonders of the   
     universe, and yet until the 17th century it was barely     
    studied.                                                  
                                                             
    The twin sciences of brain anatomy and psychology have    
    offered different visions of who we are. Now these         
    sciences are coming together and in the process have      
    revealed some surprising and uncomfortable truths about  
    what really shapes our thoughts, feelings and desires.    
                                                               
    And the search to understand how our brains work has      
    also revealed that we are all - whether we realise it    
    or not - carrying out science from the moment we are      
    born.
