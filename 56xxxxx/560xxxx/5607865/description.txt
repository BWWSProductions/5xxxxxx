- The Night Watch (Live At The Amsterdam Concertgebouw November 23rd 1973) -

Until the late nineties this live recording had been something like the holy grail for crimsonists. The concert includes the improvisations "Trio" and "Starless and Bible Black", the instrumental "Fracture" and the intro to the song "The Night Watch". With some editing, these tracks found their way to the 1974 album "Starless and Bible Black". Here we have them in their original, uncut and undubbed state.
