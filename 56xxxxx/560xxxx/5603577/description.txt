 -------------

 Lowered the yellow....alot,as there was way to much. then adjust the other 
 to try and get it as close to natural as possible. Also sharpened,denoised,
 brightness,etc,etc. The audio is far from the perfect,but not too bad for cam
 audio....I guess. Audio is a mixture of HOGs cam and and the missing 2 minutes 
 from IMAGiNE. Thanks to IMAGiNE for piecing it together and doing the sync 
 work! Enjoy and we have a few nice TS's in the works!=]
