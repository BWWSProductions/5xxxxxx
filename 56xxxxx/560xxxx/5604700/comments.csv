,Amy McGregor,2011-02-13T02:46Z,"This game works fine for me, I run a 64-bit Win 7 withall 3 stuff packages installed and world adventures. There is only one thing I can complain about: When my sims sit down at the drawing desk and work on fashion or architecture (not sketching/painting) I only get a while background with a black text saying ""Texture Missing"". Is there anyone with the same problem? Is there a way to fix it?"

,11western,2012-01-18T01:57Z,"Installed fine but it's my daughters game so I haven't played it yet. Does get to the start of the game. I see questions about what file this is, so here goes.....
It's a RAR file, you need winrar(it's free) right click the first stack of books and extract files, you'll get a folder on top of everything. Open folder and there's you iso image ( you need deamon lite for this) mount the image. If your window pops up click ""open folder to view files"" then you can click auto run and install the game. in that folder you'll see the vitallity folder and so on. 
Hope that helps.....
Thanks again uploader"
,lilleborg,2012-05-17T13:34Z,"@randomuser722 how did you do it, did you apply the crack to the base game? whenever i apply the crack the launcher won't open and when i don't apply the crack the game won't start. any tips maybe?"
