GAME NOTES

Widen your Sim's horizons with a bunch of killer new
career opportunities. With The Sims 3 Ambitions, decide
whether your Sim will be the brave town hero or cause
loads of mischief among their neighbors. Make your Sim
save the day as a brave firefighter, change the town as a
leading architect, or live on the edge as a tattoo
artist. Will your Sim find success as a billionaire
high-tech inventor or eke out a living as a bumbling mad
scientist? Will they uncover secrets as a private
investigator by dusting for prints or roughing up a
suspect for information? Their future is entirely in
your hands!
