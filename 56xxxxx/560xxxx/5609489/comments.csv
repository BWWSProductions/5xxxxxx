[T],readyman,2010-06-20T22:16Z,Actually pizzano23 I copied the track information from another site... Not the torrent. Maybe you should gather more information before writing an insulting comment.
[T],readyman,2010-06-21T01:54Z,"Well, since we're on this subject were did you get your torrent."
[T],readyman,2010-06-21T21:39Z,"Alright, when I uploaded the file I had no intention of trying to compete with you, if you have more seeds than me so what, congrats.  I just uploaded the file because I thought people might enjoy it, not because I thought adding my name meant anything."
[T],readyman,2010-06-22T03:33Z,"And just know, the next time you place a link on my torrents directing to another torrent I will report you."
[T],readyman,2010-06-22T07:24Z,"Sorry, that I acted like an asshole in anyway,  in reality I hadn't check thepiratebay to see if it was uploaded.  I'll remove my torrent and lend you an extra seed. "
