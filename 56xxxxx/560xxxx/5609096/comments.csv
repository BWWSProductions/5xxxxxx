,greddy87,2010-06-08T09:30Z,"HAWT DAMN
FAST DL
thanks SaM!"
,MykZkyM,2010-06-08T12:08Z,"Quit being whiny bitches.  The quality is good for the file size.  

Ratings:
A=7 not the best but you can understand what is being said perfectly unlike what others are saying.
V=10 probably the best you are going to get for this filesize.

If you just want to watch the movie and don't really have a super fast internet connection you can't get better than this.  If you really want to whine about the quality and shit just wait for the DVD/BluRay."
,-rens-,2010-06-08T14:54Z,"Good quality. Movie was okay, few laughs, nothing special.

A: 6,5
V: 8,5

I had no trouble with the audio whatsoever at any point.

Thanks Sam!

video tá ok, mas não sei se chega a ser R5... tá entre screen de ótima qualidade e R5...
vou esperar mais uns dias, o filme nem é tão bom assim."
,n3llo,2010-06-09T09:29Z,"c'mon guys the audio only goes out of sync for a couple of mins at most, it's a free f**king movie ppl.
peace."
,DIE_becky_DIE,2010-06-09T12:02Z,Was the audio mic'd in the middle of a cave or something?  I guess its watchable since its a free movie but audio leaves you a little disappointed.
,Harleysgirl,2010-06-09T23:21Z,Thank you :-) very much 
,perryl,2010-06-11T07:45Z,"i have no idea why people are complaining about the audio on this movie. 
i ran it through my wireless network on my xbox/big screen, and the sound was perfectly fine.

a:10, v:10, m:7

movie was not what i expected, i expected it to be funnier, but oh well. it was still good. 
this movie is not really a comedy, its more of a suspense/drama with a lil comedy mixed in. "
