the uploader only has this one post

sounds too good to be true and plus he
is writing comment to seed it "
,SyCKLe,2010-06-06T23:26Z,"Yes, please leave a comment. It's my first post, and yes, while it sounds too good to be true, this is a legit download. It's being seeded at demonoid and asistorrents as well (pictures and screenshots available there). Also, I should mention this is most likely a DVD Screener, but since XTM and a host of others has it read as ""DVDRip"", I just retain it that. Enjoy. :)"

,acinod,2010-06-09T09:04Z,"If anyone has finished download and tested this is really cantonese, I will rejoice and download. The resolution 640x272 seems quite low though, is it still good to watch?"
