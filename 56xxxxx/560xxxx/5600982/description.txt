Mick is an unemployed cowboy who cant find love.
Disillusioned with both life and women, he vows to stay
on a barstool for three months hoping to find some
answers at the bottom of a beer bottle. Shortly
thereafter, Mick meets Arcy, a young female art student,
and he quickly forgets his misery as the two become
friends and form a unique relationship. As they get to
know each other better, the couple transforms each
others lives while spending their time drinking,
dancing, and de-constructing the mysteries of life. Will
Mick finally find the love he needs in life or should he
have just stayed on his barstool? The answer, like life,
is both complicated and unpredictable in this romantic
comedy-drama.
