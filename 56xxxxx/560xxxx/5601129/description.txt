Description:
A cast of great stars turn in memorable performances in this creepy psycho-sexual thriller featuring Hal Hartley veteran Martin Donovan as Robert Marling - a bitter, drunk, gambling addicted architect going through a nasty divorce with his beautiful, estranged wife (Joanna Going of Phantoms, Inventing the Abbotts).

Donovan is broke, and on the verge of losing everything when takes a job remodelling a friend's exotic nightclub, where he meets a clairvoyant transvestite stripper named Heaven (UK theatre actor Danny Edwards).

Heaven's violent, disturbing premonitions first help, then haunt Donovan as he gets further embroiled in the shady world of the nightclub and its owner, Mr. Stanner, Heaven's violent boss (Richard Schiff of Deep Impact, Crazy in Alabama).

Heaven thrives on taking big risks which pay off big-time. An engaging thriller, full of hidden promise, and a suspenseful string of twists and turns. Heaven played the festival circuit to much critical acclaim in '98 and then disappeared after a quiet, week long theatrical release in LA only. A true hidden gem that deserves a much bigger audience than it's received so far!
