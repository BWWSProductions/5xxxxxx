,PoppaChubbie,2012-03-02T17:50Z,"This is NOT in English; you could have MENTIONED that in the title ... fucking IDIOT! I thought ""Malayalam"" was the name of the tutorial's author or the uploader; I live in asia & have an asian wife and neither one of us ever heard of Malayalam. Sheesh! Wasted a day and a half dl'ing this shit, ya dumb shitstain. Lucky I don't really need it, was just gonna review and possibly recommend it but that obviously aint gonna happen now."
