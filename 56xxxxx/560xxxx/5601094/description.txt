Released after a five-year stretch for a crime he did not commit, Trusty knows he must change his ways. Trusty lives by the unwritten code of the streets. Upon his return to the place where his journey began, he is faced with alternative opportunities to escape the cycle of violence and decay or to redeem himself before his friends and resume the lifestyle that put him away in the first place.
