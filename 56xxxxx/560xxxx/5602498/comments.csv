,Mikeman2000,2011-07-18T23:52Z,"You know what I don't like in a torrent that you did here? When video files and subtitle files are mixed together. You know what I DO like in a torrent that you DIDN'T do here? When the video files have one folder, and the subtitle files have their own separate folder."
,jyotir4,2011-07-27T04:47Z,Thanks RiddlerA.I have been searching for it.
,renison7,2011-08-21T09:17Z,"i like ur uploads a lot and for this one i guess you  have a better job than yify with smaller size, subtitles and extras. keep up the good work."
,renison7,2011-08-21T09:18Z,i think it deserves more seeders than yify
,renison7,2011-08-21T13:38Z,There is something really wrong with the MKV files as they don't play on VLC and I use it to watch everything. I think it some encryption or something dunno. I am sorry for the earlier comments and I guess I will try the YIFY ones. But hey the extras are AVI so they work fine.
,renison7,2011-08-23T10:08Z,"I have found a solution for those who have limited bandwidth. If you have already downloaded this then you should know that the season3 works fine. And for the rest 2 seasons use mkvmerge. Now I know what's it used for but if you mux the files separately or with their .srt they work fine. For other like me who can't do the effort just download the 
The Big Bang Theory Seasons 1,2,34 70MB/Ep | MKV  ULed by sunDox
which is of exact quality lower size.
Cheers"
,liquidfire,2011-09-24T08:33Z,"I watched these videos using media player classic. They're a bit blur but hey, it fixes the problem with vlc."
,deathfest,2011-10-02T05:03Z,Please throw in Season 4 and update this too!
,anu24592,2011-12-14T12:29Z,you are living god man. please upload season 5 episodes!
