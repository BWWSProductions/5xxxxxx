What's this? A William Castle film with no gimmick? Not so! The gimmick this time is Joan Crawford's over the top performance. After a 20 year stint in an insane asylum for the double murder of her husband and his mistress, a mother returns to her estranged daughter. Soon bodies begin to turn up, decapitated just like that double murder 20 years earlier. Crawford simply has to be seen to be believed. Some say this is the film Faye Dunaway studied most while preparing for her role in Mommie Dearest. Written By Robert Bloch, better known for writing Psycho.
