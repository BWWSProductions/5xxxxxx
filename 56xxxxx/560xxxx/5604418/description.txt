I AM ALWAYS TAKING REQUESTS (ESPECIALLY COMEDIES AND ACTION/ADVENTURE MOVIES)!!! IF I HAVE IT I WILL ADD IT TO MY LIST!!!

Plot++++++++++++++
An unnamed British cocaine dealer treats his work as a business, and neither believes he is or acts like a gangster. He respects those he works with and in return they respect him. In treating his work as a business, he has amassed a small fortune of laundered money and despite his relatively young age, he plans on retiring soon. His supplier, Jimmy Price, asks him for a small favor outside his normal work: find Charlie, the drug addicted daughter of a well known colleague named Eddie Temple, she who has escaped from a rehab center. Despite not being his business, he can't refuse Jimmy's request. More along the lines of normal business, Jimmy also hooks him up with a small time hood named Duke who has come into a stash of one million ecstasy pills. Jimmy wants in on the business, although the cocaine dealer doesn't like Duke or dealing with him. Problems arise for the cocaine dealer when he finds out the ecstasy pills were stolen from a ruthless Serbian gang, the cocaine dealer who is implicated as the mastermind. He also runs into problems in his search for Charlie. Regardless of his stance on gangsterism, he may have to act like one to get himself out of these dilemma.
