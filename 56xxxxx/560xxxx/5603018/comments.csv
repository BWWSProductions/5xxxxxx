Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"

But I am quit DISAPPOINTED when I saw that the Audio of your 2012 BRRip was slagging behind. Then I thought no no that would be some of my Codec Problem. So I Updated My Codecs (Actually was Up-to-Date) then Tried that Movie, but no use gives the same Problem. So I tried on another Computer, my Friend's Computers...etc..etc. But no use ! :-(
So I thought there would be some thing..Leave it !

Then I downloaded your The Spy Next Door BRRip. That worked Extremely Fine !

Then I Downloaded Avatar 2009 DVDScr and Universal Soldier Regeneration 2009 BRRip. These Movies are also giving the same ""Audio Lacking Behind"" Problem.

And this problem is Not faced by me only. My Friends to Face Same.
Help me Out Man.....!
Your Rips has the Awesome Crystallity in A & V both, thus I Like U.
So tell me What to do Now !  :-|"
,Sh1v4,2010-06-21T16:17Z,"i agree with pratikmisal6988, maybe i'm not one of your fans, but i really like with your work with this rip..... and i already downloaded the avatar dvdscr version from one of your torrent, before i full download the original file, i downloaded the sample, and because the sample is looking good, i decided to download the full version, but after i finished the download, i'm surprised that the quality in the sample and the original file is different, in audio quality of course, for video quality i give you 11 from 10 wkwkwkwkwk........ i really like the video quality for such size, but the audio?????
even though the sound is loud and clear, but it isn't match with the video..... of course i use the latest codec..... and i use K-Lite mega codec pack.... is there any special codec that i must use to display this great movie with ????"
,samik1989,2010-07-25T23:45Z,"hi secret-myth....i am big fan of your high quality rips....i have a request,can u pls rip & upload the movie ""in the mood for love""...bcoz the other releases(of this movie) here are quite grainy...hope u will upload one"
,Godslayer187,2010-08-03T01:53Z,"For anyone that has issues with audio or video, this is BLU RAY and being that it requires much more system resources then a regular dvd. Now some are lower in system use because the movie itself doesn't have alot of bling bling in it and as such has no issues, but then try something like avatar with SHIT LOADS of BLING and you will need more resources, the audio out of sinc or the picture lagging is usually caused by the computers graphics card doin most of the work and being overworked on the hardcore bling sections. Get a better video card and more memory. The only other suggestion i can offer is to use the K-lite codec pack as it seems to be a bit smother then the standard divx codecs. Just google K-Lite codecs to DL the pack. If you still have issues it is most likely caused by insufficient resources in your computer to properly view a blu ray movie.

Blu ray uses 3-4x the resources then a dvd. You should have a 2-3 ghz processor and at least 2 gigs of ram with a good video card with at least 256 megs ram ( I suggest 512+ for smooth operation on graphical movies like Avatar)

I hope this helps you , or at least explains whats going on. GL and happy rippin!"
