Anything to do with me doing other stuff while the comp was burning? Also this error showed up a number of times while burning:

Waiting for hard drive to reach threshold levels."

""Waiting for hard drive to reach threshold levels.""
Ok it means that your hard drive needs to be hmm let's say IDLING. You can't do other things while burning coz it will fuck it up. Start the burn and then go watch some tv it will work."
