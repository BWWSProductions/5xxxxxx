Lou Reed - Coney Island Baby Live in Jersey 

Lou Reed plays in front of an enthusiastic crowd in New Jersey, with his (near) greatest lineup of Robert Quine and Fernando Saunders, minus Doane Perry (this would make his greatest lineup) and a less-imaginative but serviceable drummer in his place. This video was released in 1987, but the song list would place it before the 1986 "Mistrial" album and Quine being on board makes it likely from around 1984/1985. Hands-down the best performance of "Coney Island Baby".  It is bone-chilling, awe inspiring, beautiful and tragic. There are some good latter Reed gems included as well.
