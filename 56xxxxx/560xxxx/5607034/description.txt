RegClean 4.1a                
-----------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

Copy RegClean.EXE to any folder on your machine.

HOW TO RUN
----------

Double-click on the RegClean icon.

RegClean will start by displaying a progress dialog. While this

is shown, it will load a copy of the parts of the registry that

it is going to check, and perform the actual scanning. Depending

on how much information is in the registry and the speed of your

CPU, this will take anywhere from about 2 to 30 minutes.

If you have many entries in your registry, there may be times

when RegClean appears to have stopped working. In fact, RegClean

may appear completely halted whenever it is checking remote or

removable drives.

Once these progress meters are gone, you will be prompted for the

next

action. You can do two things at this point:

1. Exit RegClean.

   Well, thatâ€™s kind of pointless, but you can do it. Just press

   the Cancel button.

2. Allow RegClean to fix errors that it found.

   This will create an UNDO.REG file in the folder where RegClean

   was run. The file will be titled "Undo computer yyyymmdd

   hhmmss.REG," where computer is the name of your machine, and

   yyyymmdd is the date and hhmmss is the time.

   After the file is saved, RegClean will remove these entries

   from the registry. You will see a progress meter while it does

   this. Sometimes, the progress meter may stop momentarily, but

   it should resume after a few seconds. When the meter is gone,

   RegClean is done. Press Exit to end RegClean.

WHAT REGCLEAN DOES
------------------

RegClean analyzes Windows Registry keys stored in a common

location in the Windows Registry. It finds keys that contain

erroneous values, and after recording those entries in the

Undo.Reg file, it removes them from the Windows Registry.

WHAT REGCLEAN DOESN'T DO
------------------------

RegClean does not fix every known problem with the registry. It

does not fix a "corrupt" registry; it only fixes problems with

some of the entries that are in a normal registry.

It is very possible that RegClean will not correct a problem that

you have encountered. RegClean will leave any entries in the

registry that it doesn't understand or could possibly be correct.

----------------------------------------

FIXES FOR REGCLEAN 4.1a

 - ALWAYS REPORTS ERRORS

   RegClean will now report that it has found all the errors that

   it can correct. Usually, you must run RegClean twice the first

   time to get it to this point. This is expected behavior for

   RegClean.

 - CRASHES

   RegClean should run correctly on these Intel-based operating

   systems:
   
   Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 (with Service Pack 3)
   Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 (all versions) and later
   Microsoft Windows (all versions) and later


SYMPTOMS
--------

Two messages boxes appear. One box says:

   "REGCLEAN.EXE is linked to missing export OLEAUT32.DLL:421"

while the next message box says:

   "A device attached to the system is not correctly functioning"

RESOLUTION
----------

You need to install the update to the OLE Automation system

libraries. These files are contained in the executable

OADIST.EXE, which is included in the download. (NOTE: If you are

using Window NT 3.51, you must use OADIST2Z.EXE instead; read the

KB article shown below.)

Alternately, you can find these files either at:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q164/5/29.asp

 -or-

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/oadist.exe
   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/oadist2z.exe

You can use most web browsers to download this file from either

location.


----------------------------------------

PROBLEM: IT DOESN'T SOLVE MY REGISTRY PROBLEMS

 -or-

IT JUST CREATES MORE PROBLEMS


Running RegClean may, in a few cases, cause other problems, such

as causing part of the Microsoft Network viewer to stop

functioning, or causing other programs to stop functioning. If

this happens to you, simply Undo the changes RegClean made, by

double-clicking on the last Undo.Reg file.

These types of problems are very rare, but it's a good idea to

keep your last Undo.Reg file for at least a few days or so.

Microsoft will continue improving RegClean to reduce the

frequency of problems like these.

----------------------------------------

PROBLEM: CAN'T UNDO THE UNDO.REG FILE


SYMPTOM
-------

Windows displays several error message boxes when you try to

double-click the UNDO.REG file to undo the changes RegClean made.

RESOLUTION
----------

This problem is unrelated to RegClean. It's a problem with the

Associated Program for .REG files.

To correct this problem:

1. Go to any Explorer window, click the View menu, and select
   Options.

2. In the Options dialog, select the File Types tab.

3. Scroll down in the "Registered file types:" list until you

   find the entry called "Registration Entries."

4. Double-click this item or click on the Edit button.

5. In the Edit File Type dialog, select the "Merge" entry, and

   either double-click this item or click on the Edit button.

6. In the "Editing action for type: Registration Entries" dialog

   box, make sure that the text in the "Application used to

   perform action:" field has the following entry, including the

   double quotes:

      regedit.exe "%1"

7. Click the OK buttons to dismiss all three dialog boxes.

8. You should be able to double-click on the Undo.Reg file now.
