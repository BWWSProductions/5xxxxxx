Following the effects of seminal Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover event in 1985 Power Girl's canonical Post-Crisis history had been altered, retroactively making her the granddaughter of Arion of Atlantis and not the cousin of the Earth-Two Superman as she had previously believed. 

In the 1988 mini-series Power Girl must not only deal with upheavals in her civilian identity as Karen Starr but an old enemy of her grandfather, Arion, schemes against her.

Written by Paul Kupperberg and Penciled by Rick Hoberg.  Covers provided by Kerry Gammill and Dick Giordano.
