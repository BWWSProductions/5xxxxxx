"IMPORTANT SHIT"
READ THIS PLZ & THNX:


After this month, CTC Playlists will NO LONGER BE UPLOADED to The Pirate
Bay or any other torrent site. I will continue to compile them and they
will ONLY be available for download at mindset.tumblr.com as zip files. 

My apologies for any inconvenience this may cause, although I don't see
how it would. Torrents are kind of annoying, y'all, especially if your ISP
throttles (like mine does).

Oh, also, I don't know if there will be a playlist next month. Or the
month after. Or the month after that. I have no idea. Might go on a
hiatus. We'll see. Just keep checking mindset.tumblr.com at the end of the
month, basically. Thanks for reading, bros!

`       CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - MAY 2010        `
     ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This month: Everything is new except for track 16. Poor Little Dragon, all
stuck in 2009. Still great, though, obvs.

HAPPY ALMOST-SUMMER, Y'ALL! If you have a sec, please read all the crap
above. I'm assuming you skipped over it to get to the download link, but
you really shouldn't have. It's "IMPORTANT SHIT". Also, please consider
going to concerts this summer! I'm going to three different festivals
(will be seeing Robyn, Broken Social Scene, Zeus, The National, among
many others) and I couldn't be more excited. If you have some spare cash,
festivals are a seriously UnCrap way of soaking in summer music.
