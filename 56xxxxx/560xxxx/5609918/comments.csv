,dan_showbiz,2010-06-07T00:02Z,people leave your opinions on this..id like to know. Also does this work on 5.00 m33-6 with KHBBS plugin?
,topherisher,2010-06-07T01:35Z,What do you mean by Partial/Unofficial English? Not all part are Eng some part are still Jap?
,mk2007123,2010-06-07T02:59Z,"Working on my psp 3004 gen-C 
A great effort .
but the translating is far from perfect and its not complete for you guys wondering. "
,yomanz,2010-06-07T05:52Z,wow actually works! nice
,StevennxD,2010-06-07T19:11Z,"Works on my 5.00 M33-6 :D

Thanks for the game."
,grave18,2010-06-08T02:15Z,"doesnt work for me, black screen then it shuts down my psp. Phat psp 1000 5.50 Gen d3"
,topherisher,2010-06-08T06:45Z,It works 5.00 m33 6 with out the KHBBS plugin. thanks StevennxD n nitrogenUA
,spex131,2010-06-10T09:29Z,"hey, got this working on 5.00 m33-6, game runs fine, but im trying to get back to the world map from the arena, any one know what button to press?? thanks in advance"
,joe_gamerdoc,2010-06-10T13:16Z,"finally got it to run on my 3k gen-c .before tht i had the same  problem ""black screen then it shuts down my psp"".nobody told me i needed to disable my kkhbs plugin frm the recovery menu before running the game. go pirates..."
,Kagebure,2010-06-12T20:59Z,"Works Fine. on my  3.90 M33-2.

Personally the translation is weird. Will be English for a moment and then switch back to Jap then switch too Eng. Good game though I'll wait for it too come back."
,Kagebure,2010-06-12T21:00Z,Holy shit this game doesn't come out for three months in America. I hope too see more of it Subbed before then.
,DaDarkDude,2010-06-13T15:37Z,"It fully works! It's the full BBS! AT LONG LAST, YOUR MINE!!

For anyone wondering, the english subs cover:
Parts of the cutscenes (ex: opening cutscene)
The D-Link and other attacks on the side
The descriptions on the menu
And sometimes, talking to a person- they respond in English text (the 7 dwarfs)


I've not tested out the command board or multiplayer features, so I don't know if anything is in English there

Hope you all enjoy this game as much as I do!"
,omagdy,2010-06-14T23:12Z,what do you mean by recovery menu (joe_gamerdoc) ?
,XxBranikanxX,2010-06-20T08:59Z,"Dint work for me... 5.50 GEN on a psp 1000

going to try the one with the pluggins..."
,XxBranikanxX,2010-06-20T09:57Z,"OK i got it working finally But its good and all but you cant understand the main story line......cutscenes are still un understandable but in fight its clear some parts ARE subed but not enough to understand, so sadly im not going to play this since i don't wanna ruin the story.

and my god! the chick is hawt =P"
,firescan,2010-06-23T15:38Z,damn cant get it working on my psp 2004 5.50 GEN-D3
,kakalbo123,2010-06-23T17:15Z,well does it mean theres gonna be a more revised patch? of english??and is this just your aveage download extract put then play? or needs any patch?
,NitrogenUA,2010-06-23T18:38Z,"@XxBranikanxX, yeah, gotta wait till september for a proper english version :)

@firescan, try different UMD modes (i.e. M33, Sony NP9660).

@kakalbo123, acording to author - there won't be further updates of englification."
,firescan,2010-06-24T23:39Z,still doesnt work -.-'
,firescan,2010-06-24T23:51Z,could it be a plugin that gives the problem?
,NitrogenUA,2010-06-26T08:23Z,"Yeah, probably. As joe_gamerdoc stated before - he had to disable the KHBBS plugin for game to work properly."
,kakalbo123,2010-06-26T11:05Z,heheh had to delete this when ven and terra reach radiant garden it contains so much spoilers..but you could try skipping scenes you wont understand them anyway
,pumkinking123,2010-07-08T00:21Z,i got it to work on 5.50 gen-d3 the game looks good but i really like the stories of kingdom hearts and with the partial english it is impossible to fully understand the story
,8888eight8888,2010-07-08T07:11Z,"Works for me on 5.00 M33

Thank you for the upload!"
,willbadz82,2010-07-11T12:23Z,"my psp 5.00 M33-4, Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep..... Some maps don\'t work. What is the probs?"
,willbadz82,2010-07-11T12:46Z,"I was starting the other day but some maps dont work, when I tried to talk to Stitch, it just go black, with music. It really is a good game, plus with mini games. Help me please"
,FernFrond,2010-07-12T22:15Z,"It won\'t start if you have the KHBBS patch enabled, so just disable it in recovery mode. (hold right trigger when turning on psp for CFW)nThen it should work. I\'m just waiting for full English release for this, God Eater, and Fairytail portable guild. Im playing Phantasy star 2 for psp in JAP and the story is quite long and I would have skipped it even if it was in English, but the Downloaded content that I have adds strange shops and options that I will never understand... I\'m level 90 in Phantasy star 2 so I don\'t want to restart in English when it comes out. But I might download it just for translation purposes for the DL content."
,johnie21r,2010-07-13T21:03Z,this game also works at 5.00 m33-6 with the KHBBS plugins..i wonder when you will update the patch? thank you very much for this game:)
,Ha8o8,2010-07-18T05:11Z,"Game Play: 10/10! n- No lag, everything works, no problems unless you are trying to Mod, Hack, or cheat lol. [CWCheat] for example, some hacks don\'t work. Everything else does.n- It get\'s confusing if you can\'t read Japanese, but it\'s worth while once you get to the end, you can pretty much tell what\'s going on by expression, and it still touched my heart xD.nQuality: 10/10! n- No delay unless you cheat and stuff. nSound: 10/10! n- It\'s not entirely in english, but if you love the story line and stuff I would recommend this game to you. n- Everything is basically in Japanese, but you will be so grateful when you see some english words every once in a while when they speak xD. nOver all rating: 8/10n- I say 8 cause the game being entirely in Japanese and another English person trying to play it just pisses me off -.-! n- The game works like a charm, fast, worked in 1 try. Didn\'t have to do all this other \""Remove plug in\"" crap that I\'ve been looking at in other comments. I just dragged on to my 8gb MMS-Mark 2. And played. n- Worth while and every time you play, it\'s in Japanese, but every minute is worth the wait, while we wait for the official release of BBS in September for English players! nComments: n- I didn\'t beat the game, but I finished Terra and I\'m in the midst of beating the game with Ventus haha. n- I recommend you start off with Terra first, because if you skip to Ven or Aqua, it kind of screws everything up.n- NitrogenUA, you did a good job haha! Thank you so much for the hard work you did.nnConcerns: n- I still don\'t want to wait for the official release, but if anyone know\'s how I can get something or a version to translate all of this damn Japanese, that would be so nice!!!! Or at least the ending be translated. [Not complaining or anything.] But yeah! Thanks."
,Lashrom,2010-07-27T01:46Z,It works on 5.03 GEN-C full  but If I go to Cinderella after the cutscene it's stuck and then the PSP reboot ... Does anybody knows what to do ?
,oyyouthere,2010-08-27T04:38Z,"I made an account just to comment on this torrent, and trust me it works fine it's seriously amazing, only 2 problems so far, it's about quarter English so unless you look it up you probably won't get the story and second you can't data install but that's no big thing.

Thanks Nitrogen ^^"
,NitrogenUA,2010-09-01T09:33Z,"Thanks for your positive feedback guys. Realy glad to share this one with the community. For all those people worring about not working game or uncomplete translation - get a grip, full english version will be officialy released on September 7th."
