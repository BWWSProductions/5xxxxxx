,aaronjam,2010-08-01T00:49Z,"@simon79 - to get the audio to work you must convert the audio of the mkv file from DTS to Dolby digital or something like that. Any file with DTS in the name wont be able to be played on the WD media player. 

google ""mkv audio converter"" and download the software thats called Popcorn audio converter or something like that. Sorry dont know the exact name, too lazy to figure it out right now.

Hope that helps"
,karjala-,2010-09-30T00:43Z,"thanks for the movie uploader.

simon79 - I have a WD TV myself and the problem you are having is due to the dts sound. The player sends all dts signals only on the optical port. So unless you have a optical port on your tv you need an amplifier(and speakers..) to hear sound from files with dts sound."
,Hunteren,2010-10-10T22:15Z,Is this the extended version?
