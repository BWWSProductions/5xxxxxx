If you are intending to visit the silly site in the .doc file that has you download potential shit software, tracker software, or worse, please remove the referral link.  After all, I'm sure Mr. ward1095 meant to give this upload for free and not make any cash from it, yes?  Besides, I use Google Translate, and it works fine."
