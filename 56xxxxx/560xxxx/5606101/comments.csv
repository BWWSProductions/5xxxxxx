,vwGLI,2010-07-24T00:19Z,Hi is it possible to patch this game to v1.1?
,rems500,2010-08-23T12:52Z,"this is bit of dirty rip.
get other Lionheart proper ISO

patch 1.1 not work here with this rip.

look what you got not:

Version 1.1 - 
   *  Fixed the bug that caused a crash if you had a
        companion during a save.
   *  A ""Speed Slider"" has been added that allows the user
        to select the speed that the game plays out between 
        ranges of 70% to 100%. It is accessed by hitting 
        the ""escape"" button.
   *  Many optimizations to the size and frequency of network 
        packets. This will help lower bandwidth connections.
   *  Faster 3D rendering (making the game generally run
        faster).
   *  Fixed rendering error that occurred in some loaded 
        saved games with dragons.
   *  Fixed a crash bug that could occur during map 
        transitions (unrelated to companions).
   *  Added detection of corrupt save games file when trying 
        to load.
   *  Other, smaller bug fixes (such as fixing the tool tips 
        for buttons so that it doesn't show an extra blue dot 
        when there is no tool tip, etc).
