Plot -

- With only three days until the kids from EKC hit the Regent Theatre, everyone's feeling the pressure. 
- The coaching team are gearing up for the kid's final performance in front of musical theatre heavyweights, 
- John Frost and Kelley Abbey, who are yet to be impressed. With costume fittings, 
- vocal coaching and choreographic changes to be squeezed in to an already tight day, 
- the kids are getting tired and for leading lady Alicia, it's all too much. With time running out, 
- the kids have got to push through and produce the goods. But will it be good enough to get the thumbs up from John Frost and Kelley Abbey?
