Please note - the audio on this AVI file is slightly out of sync but it can be corrected by downloading AVIdemux:

http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/download.html

Once installed, open program, add AVI file. On the audio section on the left side of the screen make sure the 'shift box' is ticked. 

The audio format is AC3 so make sure that format is selected. 

Alter the audio speed to 180 ms. This will correct the audio to be in perfect sync with the video. Save as a new file. 

Right click on the new file and open with VLC Player. If you want to convert the new file to MKV format, download MKVmergeGUI.

Thanks zingooo for a great quality rip, audio sync problem notwithstanding. "
