,aglhasham,2010-06-13T08:15Z,hi can somebody plz elplain me how to install this.
,RaunoOlenJu,2010-06-13T16:44Z,"right so i downloaded the game, installed it. and i can play it only then if i have cd 2 mounted. so its kinda annoying to mount it evry time i want to play. any1 got a fix for this?"
,calkinsclan666,2010-06-18T00:09Z,"yea, download the game crack and you shouldnt have issues"
,Smudly,2010-06-21T07:12Z,"For those still unsure how to install this game, follow these steps:

1. Download an Image Mounting program (I use MagicISO) Or use Daemon Tools.
2. Open up your Prince of Persia folder, and open CD1. Rightclick on the file called dev-pop1.cue (it's the smaller of the two files). There should be an option for MagicISO or Daemon Tools to mount the file. For MagicISO do the following: Click MagicISO -> Mount dev-pop1.cue ->
3. The game should start up now and ask if you would like to install the game. Click Install, and follow the process.
4. Once it asks for Disc 2, go back to your folder called CD1, and go back a page. Enter the folder called CD2. Right-Click, click MagicISO and first UNMOUNT all drivers. Now right click again, and mount the dev-pop2.cue file. Go back to the game, and click Ok.
5. Upon completion, do not launch the game yet. If it asks you to register, cancel out saying you never want to register online.
6. In your CD2 Folder, there is a folder called ""crek"". Open that folder, copy the file inside called POP. Open the directory where you installed the game ""Program Files/Ubisoft/Prince of Persia"" and past that file. When it asks if you want to replace the existing file, press Yes. 
7. Open the game by double clicking ""PrinceOfPersia"". (Ensure your CD2 is mounted or you will not be able to play).
ENJOY!
