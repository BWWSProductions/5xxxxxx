[V],Kuthumi,2010-06-09T06:27Z,"Thank you for the compliment, Glasofwine. This page is only read by me and people interested in this film. Requests should be made at http://suprbay.org/ where you may register for free. There they are read by many.
As for ""Rosalie"", it has been published on DVD in Australia, and can be found at www.ebay.com. Amazon.com has only the vhs  edition. Good luck!"

[V],Kuthumi,2010-06-27T22:09Z,"'gellipad', you can register for free at the Forum and send me private messages there. Click at bottom right. As for suggesting 'the very best' that is a matter of taste. I only upload films that I think are good, and if they are not already available with the same options. This one is similar to Pulp Fiction.
I usually follow the actors, the writer/director or the composer. Try clicking on tag 'Jon Travolta' above, and have a look at
