The Bluetones - A New Athens (2010)


The Bluetones are an English indie rock band, formed in Hounslow, Greater London, in 1993. The band's members are Mark Morriss on vocals, Adam Devlin on guitar, Scott Morriss on bass guitar, and Eds Chesters on drums. A fifth member, Richard Payne, came on board between 1998 and 2002. The band was originally named "The Bottlegarden".

The band's biggest hit, "Slight Return", was released in 1995 (as a double A-side with "The Fountainhead") and re-released on its own the following year. They have achieved thirteen Top 40 singles and three Top 10 albums in the UK charts.





The Bluetones' commercial success waned after the fall of the Britpop movement, yet they have continued to tour and release new records and are therefore often labelled as "Britpop survivors".

In September 2008, the band announced that they would be embarking on a five-date tour in December, taking in Lincoln, Manchester, Sheffield and Birmingham. The tour saw them playing their debut album, Expecting to Fly, in full. Some further dates were subsequently announced for February and March 2009.

The band's next album called A New Athens will be released on 31 May 2010.
