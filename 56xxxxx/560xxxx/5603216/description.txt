They are 'John, I'm Only Dancing' (Sax Version) - recorded during the sessions for the 'Aladdin Sane' album, 'The Prettiest Star' (Single Version), - the original 1970 single release that features Marc Bolan on lead guitar and 'All The Young Dudes' (Studio Version) which is the original Bowie studio version from 1973
