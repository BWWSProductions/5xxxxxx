FLAWL3SS NOTES
well well alot of effort into this release as well, you may have our first 1 and that might suit you perfectly their isn't much difference, in this release i've opted to clean the video, noise, grain stuff like that then i sharpened worked on colors giving it that natural look, and after that i done the brightness / contrast.. enjoy from FLAWL3SS

credit FLAWL3SS & BMB & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
