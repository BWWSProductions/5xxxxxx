A busy, "always-on-the-run" executive learns during a meeting
that his mother may be dying and rushes home to her side. He ends
up being his father's caretaker and becomes closer to him than ever
before. In the process, he teaches his father to be more independent
which causes problems with the man's wife. Estranged from his own son,
the executive comes to realize what has been missing in his own life.
