Such a beautiful Movie, I think that this is  Jim Carrey's best role ( I have not seen Eternal Sunshine Yet!)  and Ewan McGregor was just so loveable, again!  Definitely the best movie I have seen so far this year, thanks  and please seed for those that are not fortunate enough to have as great of an internet connection as myself."
