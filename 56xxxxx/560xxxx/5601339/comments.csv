[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T20:18Z,"@Stev: LOL, yes, Jon had and wrote about - but with The Losers. He provided me with few links, when I have seen Cinavia crap for the first time. It was maybe month ago and meanwhile no none has found safe and repeatable way to remove it from audio (where Cinavia is deeply embedded). Only Sony produced titles are affected and only playback on Sony BluRay capable devices. You've been punk'd by beloved Sony because last update was about adding that shit to PS3 firmware."

RE: Cinavia

As 20-40 said, I got caught by this latest DRM type Sony crap.
I'm sure you've found out that it's built into the audio which is a pretty neat trick by Sony. Have to give them credit for being orginal pricks.

Only way, besides PC watching, is to watch on non-Sony BR product. I used ConvertXtoDVD and watched on standalone (& not on-line) DVD player. 

I'm sure this will pop up more and more but the great thing is that someone will eventually hack it and everyone benefits, i.e. another small step forward in progamming/coding etc. 

Boring myself now.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-01T08:27Z,"@Stev & Jon:
I haven't said something (because I knew that Jon is short in traffic allowance and probably hate RomComs and I wasn't aware of Stev's problem with Robin), but -  ""The Back-Up Plan"" is ...Sony produced title. So, I tried something, but not knowing if the title is infected with Cianavia at all.
LOL... nobody said something and I am unable to find or test or verify removal 'cause I don't have any Sony product in my house."
,Stevc,2010-06-01T08:55Z,ill test backup plan ill download it quikly
