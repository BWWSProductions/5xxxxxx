After deciding to once again use the Karen Starr identity, Power Girl moves to New York City and begins rebuilding Starr Enterprises while continuing solo superheroics.  But a villain from her past has other plans for her and to get his way, he's holding Manhattan hostage.  Plus, a trio of sexy alien marauders hits Earth for the ultimate party. Unfortunately, by their standards, that means destroying it. 

This pack contains the critically acclaimed run by writers Jimmy Palmiotti (Deadpool) and Justin Gray (Jonah Hex) with art by Amanda Conner (Vampirella). Starting with issue #13, writer Judd Winick (Green Lantern, Green Arrow) and artist Sami Basri (The Shield) will chronicle the adventures of Kara Zor-L.
