There are two official music videos for this song.

The first video released, directed by Anthony Honn, is a video shoot for many models, including some of them topless and in other suggestive positions. There is also an clean (edited) version of the video.

The second video, directed by Steven Oritt, features the band playing the song along with a man in his house watching a woman through binoculars in her house as she swims, takes a bath and dresses for a night out. While she is getting dressed, the man watching her sees a figure in dark clothes sneak up to her door, and creep in without knocking. The man panics, puts down the binoculars and picks up his keys. He drives to her house, and knocks on the door. He is surprised to see the hooded man on the other side of the door, with the girl he'd been watching right behind him. Embarrassed, he says nothing while the couple leaves holding hands.
