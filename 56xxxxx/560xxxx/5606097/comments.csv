,DarkSolace,2010-06-15T01:05Z,"check the sample file ""FUT499 - Sample.mp4""
for a full representation of the video/audio quality

and please remember to seed :)"
,Wopatoolie,2010-06-24T02:46Z,"Great quality as i knew they would be. one thing tho: there are 5 previous seasons, not 4, so i had to do a bit of organizing. tnx tho
Wop"
,bionaire,2010-06-24T23:38Z,Hey Wopatoolie! That's how they're arranged on the DVD. The 5 seasons were actually 4 production seasons spread out.
,DarkSolace,2010-06-29T21:00Z,"There are only 4 seasons on DVD release.
The mysterious 5th season your refering too is always either an error on the broadcasting since futurama was split up and broadcast at different times causing it to be called a new season even though it isnt.
Or, the 4 feature length episodes which were never released as a season being lumped into a season because its (roughly speaking) 16 episodes worth.

Since I'm from the UK we have futurama 1-4 (as uploaded) and the 4 feature length episodes.

As soon as s5 comes out on DVD i'll buy it and upload that too.

Thanks for downloading.
And don't forget to seed :D"
,DarkSolace,2010-07-13T19:31Z,Yes. My torrents are every futurama episode ever released except the 4 feature length ones and the new season currently airing on comedy central
,pedroriel,2010-09-23T07:00Z,"Hey dark solace, where can I get the feature length episodes? Thanks."
,DarkSolace,2010-10-18T17:12Z,I'll get hold of the DVD's and do a rip as soon as I get them :)
,DarkSolace,2011-01-16T18:54Z,"Ive now finished all of the Feature length episodes, they can be found here....

Nice quality going to seed all week long :D"
,Wopatoolie,2011-03-24T00:49Z,"there is no 'mysterious 5th season'. if you look at this wikipedia link youll see there are 5 full seasons, but due to foxx's inept and erratic time slots/programming, the 4th and 5th seasons were crammed in together...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Futurama_episodes#Season_1_.281999.29

so those who say there were only 4 seasons are correct, but those who say there were 5 original seasons are also correct. se5 (movies), in the tv order, is also se6 (the new comcen) by this link. se6 w/ Rebirth etc., is also se7 in the tv order. im sure the dvds were packaged to compact them better, since the 1st season was so few episodes, no sense in wasting perfectly usable disc space. as i understand the movies are to be packaged as a separate release, but knowing how those things go, who knows....? either way, we can all thank foxx for fucking things up for us. THANKS FOXX!"
,klaximopark,2011-05-04T03:31Z,thanks darksolace and seeders!
,chibwack,2012-04-12T19:11Z,"For those of you still wondering about season 5, it's in these torrents.  The season cutoff's are a little weird though (maybe dvd's had a different order?).  Anyways, the season 1 torrent for example includes the first 4 episodes of season 2, and etc.  (based on theTVDB anyways).  So its all here (including the 1-3 dvdtomp4 torrents), other than the movies and season 6."
,chibwack,2012-04-12T19:20Z,"Turns out the order gets straight up messed, but the episodes are all there"
