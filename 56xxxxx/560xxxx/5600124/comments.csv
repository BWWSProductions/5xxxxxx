:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-30T23:00Z,"Thanks. I will left this one open (no initial) whole night. It is new extra small format, but it would be for theatrical 2.35 aspect ratio only. Frame size is 480 px (as in 272p), but not the height. Let see..."
[T],houruoha,2010-05-30T23:06Z,"good night 
:)"
,ralphvin,2010-05-30T23:09Z,Hey 20-40.......a REQ for AustinPowers Trilogy....if possioble...:)
,lilars26,2010-05-30T23:30Z,"Thank you 20-40.
Very appropriate title."
,D07792,2010-05-31T00:04Z,"How is this different from (quark)? Size is similar.

Your last 272p encoding is extremely good for 250mb.

But hit and cases will always be very high as most people how spend time looking 4 small size files must have bandwidth issue. "
,hkoraddi,2010-05-31T06:37Z,good to see you back
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T07:59Z,"Thanks guys.

@D07792: Regarding differnce - as said above - 480 px width. Little friend had 352 px frame width. Bigger frame-size needs 21% higher bitrate. Late [quark] would be smaller by same percentage.
There is a significant minus - decent encoding could be achieved (within given file-size ""class"") only for movies with 2.35 aspect ratio - again, as stated above. [quark] was more versatile and he could tolerate TV aspect-ratio (16/9). Here 16/9 must be avoided.

Regading the quality of last 272p encodings - I HAVEN'T CHANGED A THING"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T08:13Z,"@D07792: Sorry, ""Submit"" button pressed by mistake.
...to continue:

...last six-seven months. What people find hard to understand is that only difference which exists is the one in quality of the input. Movies and TV shows differ in picture quality (and in sound too, but to lesser extent).
In reality, only difference is the quality of my inputs (I tried hard to always find/choose the best one - if few exists at all) and - the duration.

You cannot compare file-sizes of latest 272p of 78 minutes with 204 minutes, for example, of Altman's Short Cuts. One is 250MB, other one 700MB for obvious reason. But - both are 272p."
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T09:34Z,"@sanyam: Kudos to you, my brother. Your vigilance and support was crucial."
,sherynoshka,2010-05-31T09:39Z,thank you so much it feels great to have a movie in this size
[V],pluto999,2010-05-31T12:23Z,welcome back mate!!
,jon4fun,2010-06-02T00:41Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

I would also like to say that it is a true pleasure to see inovation in encoding.

Other encoders should try 'new things' just to see what happens.

Cheers
Jon"
