,Betoriel,2010-06-22T21:25Z,"Very good quality for a cam record..

A: 9
V: 8

Watched it from closer than 2 meters, no problems with quality.. Couple very small zoom mistakes, but other than that.. I'm guessing this is one of the best versions out there, especially since it's only 700mb, definetly worth the download. (also great Seed / leech ratio for the time being) :P"
,Betoriel,2010-06-22T21:26Z,"oh yeah, and the movie was great.. Enjoyed the whole flick. Great twists in story, for one who hasn't played the game this was based on. :3"
,Betoriel,2010-06-22T21:30Z,"Oh and now that I'm on it.. You forgot the most important video quality screenshot ;o
