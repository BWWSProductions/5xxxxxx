,Electrish,2010-06-13T19:13Z,"I love this film! It's got Giovanni Lombardo Radice (John Morghen), one of my favourite genre actors of the era e.g. Cannibal Apocalypse, House on the Edge of the Park, Cannibal Ferox.

I like the dreamy quality of this film and watch it on dvd with some regularity. I've heard mixed things about the BD so thanks for letting me check it out."
