The Plot


After Father William Thomas (Fabrizio Jovine) hangs himself in a cemetery, the gates of Hell are opened. Zombies  with the abilities of super strength, teleportation  and levitation appear and start killing off people in a remote town. Psychic Mary Woodhouse (Catriona MacColl) dies of what appears to be fright at a seance, and is buried - only to revive, buried alive, in her own coffin. Investigating reporter Peter Bell (Christopher George), who is intrigued by the case, is present at the grave-site and rescues her - only to learn it is all fated as part of a prophecy in the Book of Enoch. The death of the priest is only the beginning, and they both must travel to the rural town of Dunwich, New England, and close the portal to Hell before All Saints Day, or the spirits of the dead will overtake the earth.
