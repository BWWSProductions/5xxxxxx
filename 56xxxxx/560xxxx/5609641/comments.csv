,manwich49,2010-06-06T16:47Z,"Is this an anamorphic DVD or is it the original, non-anamorphic version with black bars on all 4 sides?"
,manwich49,2010-06-06T16:49Z,"NM, just saw in description it isn't. This is the one Arnold movie in my collection that I hate because of the anamorphic issue."
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-06T18:11Z,This is the non animorphic version I hope this is what you were looking for... or were you looking for the anamorphic?
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-06T18:11Z,@Meez714 - Never heard of that movie but I will keep an eye out for it.
,manwich49,2010-06-07T13:21Z,"I don't guess they ever got around to releasing an anamorphic version on DVD, not an issue with bluray.

Non-anamorphic DVDs generally look bad on HDTVs."
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-07T14:48Z,I beg to differ. I watched it on my HD and it actually looked really solid. My friend and I both even made comment on it about how good it looked while being an unmastered film. 
,manwich49,2010-06-09T17:34Z,"Unmastered film?

What does that even mean? This DVD is well known in the HT Forum community as being  a non-anamorphic low quality release. I was hoping they finally released an anamorphic version but the chances are slim with Bluray now taking over."
