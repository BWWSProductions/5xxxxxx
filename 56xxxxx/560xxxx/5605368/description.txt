

Torrent Harvester is useful software that will preform a search for 

Torrents on multiple websites returning all results in a single list. Just enter 

some text to search on, press enter or click the search button and the list will 

fill with torrents found. Right clicking a torrent in the list will bring up a 

menu to download the torrent and start your BitTorrent client.

Torrent Harvester eliminates the need to use your web browser to check many 

Torrent sites if you are looking for a particular torrent. This means annoying 

pop-ups, advertising, spyware and virus threats are eliminated. Torrent Harvester 

is also flexible enough to allow for the addition of new search engines, and 

alteration of existing engines in the case of site redesign.

What's New in This Release: [ read full changelog ]

Â· Since the previous release, many engines no longer work due to the fact that the 

sites they are based have been either redesigned, or no longer exist. I won't list 

all the new, removed, or modified engines. A complete list of engines release with 

this version can be seen on the Included Engines page. A few engines have been 

removed due to the fact I am unable to test them without an account. Some sites 

are now invite only and I do not have the time to chase up invites. I'll leave it 

up to the users to create engines for these sites and post them or their update 

sites to the Torrent Harvester Support Forum

support forum at
