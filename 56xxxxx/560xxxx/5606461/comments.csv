,Vollendung,2010-06-06T14:02Z,Are you fucking idiot? Why the hell you put it in a rar?
,shadowman2,2010-06-20T11:02Z,"Hey Vollendung - you're the idiot.
If you don't like a free film I suggest you go out and buy it and quit your bitchin'.

RAR is preferred by some uploaders because
if after you download the whole torrent as an ISO or VTS for example and it somehow gets corrrupted, you'd have to download the WHOLE torrent again. But if you download the film as RAR and it turns out one or two RAR files get corrupted you only need that one or two RAR files NOT the whole film.

RAR is very easy to extract and only takes a few minutes unless you're an idiot - oops I forgot, you are an idiot !!
