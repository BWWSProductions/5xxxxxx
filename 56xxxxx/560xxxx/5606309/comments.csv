m8 as we all now keygen's and patches always give false positives. The reason for this is simply that the patch or keygen, do something illegal to the app. so it only makes since that they virus and spyware companies would include patches and keygen's in there definitions. I promise its clean, if my uploads where not clean of virus's i would not have earned the pink skull m8."
