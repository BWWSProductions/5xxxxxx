,doandroidsdreamofelectric,2010-06-05T13:14Z,"theres something strangely suspicious about the seeders and leechers for your uploads, you still have r5 torrents in the top 100 when bluray for them has been out for months,and right now this one has 8000 leechers on my bit torrent ,pretty big for a movie not that well known,thats many thousands more than the next biggest for this movie this one is already #17 in top 100 and climing"

[T],extremezone,2010-06-05T15:22Z,"just to show you how stupid can some be

avatar ts maxspeed has been downloaded by 949756 peeps from 2009 until now so it's legit to assume 4600 is still connected as seeders , comprendre?

,Esmad3,2010-06-07T09:10Z,"@doandroidsdreamofelectric: It's not that strange. A lot of ppl just sheepishly stick to the uploads with many seeders allready on the top 100, so the first release in a somewhat decent quality will remain the top seeded. And this particular movie has all the derivative Twilight hype. Don't make silly insinuations "
