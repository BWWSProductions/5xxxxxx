Frederick Ashton (the other major choreographer of the second half of the 20th century) created his ballet Tales of Beatrix Potter  
for the camera in 1971 (still available on DVD). 
In 1992, Anthony Dowell created a stage version for the Royal Ballet, revived in 2007 and filmed during the subsequent performances. 
David Niceâ€™s essay in the accompanying booklet tells us much about the score, 
â€œcomposedâ€ by John Lanchberry using Victorian waltzes and ballads and excerpts from various 19th-century ballets (Minkus, Glazunov), 
as well as his own version of La fille mal gardÃ©e, 
to all of which Ashton choreographed a number of gems, 
at the same time parodying the 19th-century classics in solos and pas de deux.
