yes it is true cat and mouse but sooner or later the pirate mouse will outsmart the rich cat."
,sanyam123,2010-06-02T13:07Z,"@Stev: i got this from forums...just try n tell the result...
Fast Forward (1.5 speed) a couple of seconds past the Cinavia message (before you get the message). PS3 cant pick up the protection code in the audio at anything other than normal speed."
,Stevc,2010-06-02T13:13Z,"@sanyam123

[V],twentyforty,2010-06-02T13:30Z,"LOL guys... Stev, do you remember when you told that you have problems on your PS?
It was on Red.Dead.Redemtion thread... and our lil' ""conversation"" (you, Jon, me) appear as the result on Page 2 on Google.
I just searched for any new ""bowel movements"" and nothing came out (LOL, it is about the crap, but not the crap itself).
So, we should be more careful. In future, use of so called ""trigger-words"" should be avoided. We are most likely already flagged by our brothers who cannot catch bearded fundamentalist in some frikkin caves.

@sanyam: That was one of the first tricks people have tried - and reported later that this doesn't work."

>>If you can find a 3.15 firmware pup or pub (forget name) update file you could try putting it onto a usb memory stick, boot ps3 into safe mode, and select update firmware. There has been talk safe mode allows you to downgrade one firmware level. So 3.21 can go to 3.15."""
,jon4fun,2010-06-02T17:34Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Do you intend to do a encode of the BRrip? Just wondering?

Cheers
Jon"
,lilars26,2010-06-02T18:08Z,Thank you 20/40.
,jon4fun,2010-06-02T18:12Z,"@ 20-40 - Thanks for the info on Safe Mode that you found. I know you don't have one of these systems and so really appreciate the fact that you are trying to help us 'saps' that have.

@PS3 users.
Just an FYI for Safe Mode and downgrading firmware.
1) I found a downloadable version of v3.15 firmware. 
2) Put it on a USB stick .
3) Entered Safe Mode chose [System Update].
4) PS3 would not accept/acknowledge that there was an update available as it wanted one that was v3.21 or later (3.30 out now).

NB: I did NOT go through the 'recommended steps' first of
   1. Restore Default Settings
   2. Restore File System
   3. Rebuild Database
   4. Restore PS3 System
as my PS3 is working fine, except for the certain piece of s/w that is causing of grief.
I have lots of saved info and will have to backup before going trying again.

HOWEVER, has anyone else gone to the trouble of doing the above, i.e. erasing system and starting from scratch? I ask as I do NOT know if the above will remove v3.21 firmware.

We'll beat this s/w yet, just got to keep communicating with each other.

Please let me know how you got on.

Cheers
Jon "
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-02T18:14Z,"Thanks guys.
Jon, this title is on Stev's list. It means that I wont touch it again till someone hack that crap out."
,Stevc,2010-06-02T18:46Z,"@20/40 and Jon

Ill rather wait for a fix coz downgradin g isnt good for the system or so ive read. 

Another UPDATE

this upload seems to be free of that witch we do not name wooooooooooohoooooooo"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-02T19:32Z,"I wouldn't do downgrade myself. Guy on yout.ube announced hacked firmware, but it should be treated as ""5.1 surround for 0.99 bucks"" (you know... the stuff for Mythbusters).
PS3 owners really have been pranked. Removed ""OtherOS"" and aforementioned which, it practically begs hackers to reverse-engineer whole bucket of crap.

I do not need that, I am just - intrigued by all this jazz. What I waiting for is - a explained detection of that crap, then all guys can do either removal tool or tell us what to do with infested audio. It is safer and more logical than changing/downgrading firmware which would prevent users from installing new stuff which check firmware revision numbers."
,jon4fun,2010-06-02T20:47Z,"Hi 20-40,
I know we (PS3) owners have been suckered and a sneaky sucker punch at that, although the h/w detection was always built-in just not activated until this sneaky firmware update.

I know you are waiting for the 'hack' or encoding trick that will cancel out the audio issue. It is fun to kick the big-boys where it hurts after them going to so much trouble! And you get to try new encoding methods! :-)

I won't be trying to hack/downgrade firmware unless I see reliable reports from more than one source that they have successfully gotten around this little issue.

It may be time to call in the Apple hackers, change to a pineapple on PS3 boot. HA!

Cheers
Jon"
