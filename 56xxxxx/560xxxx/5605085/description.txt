Hello,

Thank for your downloading and seeding the Nobel Peace Prize movie collection.

First of all, make sure you are downloading the latest version of the collection.
As the collection is being built up, files and movies will be added to the collection.
Older versions of the collection will no longer be seeded in order to upload newer versions.
So, before you carry on downloading this torrent, check that you are downloading the latest version
at the following address: 
http://thepiratebay.org/user/best_collections

If you have already partly or completely downloaded an earlier version of this collection, you do
not need to download the whole collection all over again. Simply download the newest version into the same
directory, and instruct your bittorrent client to do a checksum against the new torrent so that you only
download the newest files (I welcome more precise instructions for each bittorrent client.
I'll include the instructions here.)

Check the CHANGELOG.txt file to see what has changed between versions and for more precise instructions on
completing the collection.

I welcome any suggestions for inclusion in this collection. I'll check all your comments on the torrent download
page of the newest version of this collection.

Please remember to seed!

Together, we can make this torrent the best collection available.



Thank you.


Best Collections.

Nobel Peace Prize movie collection.
-----------------------------------

Review this CHANGELOG carefully. For each new file, we try to add the source so that
if you already downloaded the file from that same source, you only need to change the
file name as indicated and get your bittorrent client to do a hash check, so that you
can complete this torrent and seed quicker.



Coming soon:

Version 2 of this collection will include "An Inconvenient Truth" downloaded from here:

Wanted:
-------
The movie 'Ghandi'. Even though Ghandi was not a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, following his assassination
in 1948 the committee considered awarding it to him posthumously but decided against it and instead
withheld the prize that year with the explanation that "there was no suitable living candidate."

Aung San Suu Kyi

Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 1991 "for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights" 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi
http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/kyi.html

Aung San Suu Kyi (born 19 June 1945) is a Burmese opposition politician and was General Secretary of the National League for Democracy. In the 1990 general election, Aung San Suu Kyi was elected Prime Minister, as leader of the winning National League for Democracy party, which won 59% of the vote and 394 of 492 seats. She had, however, already been detained under house arrest before the elections. She has remained under house arrest in Myanmar for almost 14 out of the past 20 years.

Aung San Suu Kyi was the recipient of the Rafto Prize and the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. In 1992 she was awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding by the Government of India.

1 - Beyond Rangoon
================== 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112495/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Rangoon

Beyond Rangoon is a 1995 drama film directed by John Boorman about Laura Bowman (played by Patricia Arquette), an American tourist who vacations in Burma (Myanmar) in 1988, the year in which the 8888 Uprising takes place. The film was mostly filmed in Malaysia, and, though a work of fiction, was inspired by real people and real events.

The film was an official selection at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, where it was one of the popular hits of the event.

The film may have had an impact beyond movie screens. Only weeks into its European run, the Burmese military junta freed Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi (depicted in the film) after several years under strict house arrest. The celebrated democracy leader thanked the filmmakers in her first interview with the BBC. As the world knows, Suu Kyi was re-arrested a few years later, but Beyond Rangoon had already helped raise world attention on a previously "invisible" tragedy: the Massacres of 1988 and the cruelty of her country's military rulers.
