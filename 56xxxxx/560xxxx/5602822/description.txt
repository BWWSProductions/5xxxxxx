First off, thanks to SLUGGER and TA for the source not bad needed 
some work though, first thing i did was fix the AR to 2.35:1
Also not sure why...but the res and file size was really small
on the Slugger release...so i fixed that and made both bigger.
After that, i fixed colors a bit, changed brightness and contrast
turned out ok i think, not the worst cam, also not the best.
enjoy i guess. source seems to have a frame lag... other than
that it would be pretty good.

Looking for cam video/audio, direct line audio, pre released
r5s, ntsc and pal dvds, dvd/screeners, anything useful
