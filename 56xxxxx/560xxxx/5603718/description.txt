Storyline:

Itâ€™s 16 years after Snake Plisskenâ€™s rescue of the President of the United States of America in New York.
Now, a different President is in power, and declares the U.S. to be a land of moral superiority: no smoking, no red meat, no freedom of religion and no unapproved marriages.
A massive earthquake has hit Los Angeles, leaving it in ruins and completely surrounded by water. From this new island hell rises an army of discontent,
led by brutal South American revolutionary Cuervo Jones. L.A. has become an anarchist state. The President deports all immoral (and therefore criminal) citizens of the U.S.
to the City of the Angels.
However, his own daughter Utopia joins forces with Cuervo, taking with her the key to a doomsday device that could send mankind back to the dark ages.
Once again, Snake is recruited by the Presidentâ€™s men to complete an impossible task: penetrate the Sodom that is L.A., retrieve the device, and eliminate Utopia.
Infected by a fatal virus, his clock is ticking as enemy forces threaten the United Statesâ€™ borders.
