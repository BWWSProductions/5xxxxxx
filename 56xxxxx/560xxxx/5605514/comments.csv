[T],houruoha,2010-06-03T13:35Z,"this is real nice of you 2040
as so many people are requesting quark though we have bid farewell 
may be i will find something here
hehehe
thanks
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-03T13:44Z,"Yes, but please, read the note. Do it one-by-one 'cause my UL would be choked otherwise."
,sdcheeran,2010-06-03T13:48Z,"no worries, i just loaded every torrent i need from your collection and then stopped them... now i'm downloading as each one finishes and uploading until my monthly internalHD onto externalHD transfer"
,sdcheeran,2010-06-03T13:53Z,"i'm confused about initial seeding... if i'm downloading one of your torrents and you upload another with no seeders, does loading the new one help or hurt overall transfer speeds?"
,htctouch,2010-06-03T14:03Z,just a fantabulous mindblowing upload man . awsm superb outrgs ....thnx allot
,sdcheeran,2010-06-03T14:06Z,"htctouch, i wanna change my username to omniahd so our phones/primary media viewing devices can do battle on piratebay haha"
[T],houruoha,2010-06-03T14:51Z,"i ll help you seed

,skillet92,2010-06-03T15:00Z,"thanks dude..!!

,Stevc,2010-06-03T15:16Z,WOW thats a big torrent i wish i was able to help. Ill see what i still have and think i can do most of the vampire diaries and chuck and fringe
[T],houruoha,2010-06-03T15:21Z,"omg 
there is a problems 
as i move the downloaded torrent into the folder and force check the files. some files show umcomplete downloads  like 98% 99% 96%
i may have some 30-45 files of quark on my pc but 99 percent of the files comes up un complete downloads and they may take some time to complete the downloads
:)"
,skillet92,2010-06-03T15:48Z,"that will happen!!
but u will help a lot in seeding!
jus put them on!"
,Stevc,2010-06-03T15:49Z,they are probably missing srt files or text files dont worry about them they are small and quick to download
,Stevc,2010-06-03T15:52Z,those 98% 96% and so on are probably missing str or text files maybe nfo but let them finish its not allot 
[T],houruoha,2010-06-03T16:03Z,"well i taking forever to download those files
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-03T16:10Z,"Any, I meant any help is needed, not just appreciated. You'll help others if you already have some of the listed files.

@houruoha: Just copy such incomplete [quark]s replacing the files from this torrent. IF you Stop  already loaded torrent, file/folder structure could be seen in ""Files"" tab or you can open the torrent file itself in any plain text editor (Win32pad, Notepad) and ""read"" from there...

@sdcheeran: You've asked ""does loading the new one help or hurt overall transfer speeds"".

It depends on your upload/download capabilities. Only guys with rely fast connections can afford that. I can't. You cannot too. My general advice always have been to avoid loading of two torrents which are in initial-seeding phase (simultaneously). 2nd, if someone needs/must join to initial swarm AND have borderline speed capabilities (UL speed 35-50 kB/s) best and probably only way for avoid flagging as ""leeching scumbag"" is to STOP ANY OTHER torrent and left active only specific one, with speed settings on UNLIMITED (both UL and DL)."
[T],houruoha,2010-06-03T16:12Z,"i ve added something like 4.6gb+
still 93% complete 
little more time
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-03T16:13Z,"err.
rely = really"
,sdcheeran,2010-06-03T16:35Z,"@20-40:
thanks for the info (will keep that in mind when i'm sailing piratebay for booty :)

@new users of the torrent sharing community:
heres a tip i got from google-
if you wanna increase your seeding speed to help share data with others after you download: increase the 'seed while' percentage to >300 (its located in options tab, under preference/queuing in BITtorrent program) please seed after downloading as long as possible if you have unlimited internet data plan cause those of us with slow expensive bandwidth surive only when help us by seeding these torrents"
,jon4fun,2010-06-03T19:14Z,"THANK YOU 20-40!

Cheers
Jon"
,honey88foru,2010-06-03T19:22Z,"Wow! That's a mighty big torrent you got there :D
I'm gonna do my share of help. Think I have some of these...

First HR, now you... Just sad :'(
Still good luck with whatever you're doing.

...and thanks for everything :)"
,Stevc,2010-06-03T21:00Z,"@honey88foru 

20-40 isnt going anywhere its just a mega pack for our dear departed friend QUARK, our friend 20-40 will still be here."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-03T21:03Z,"@honey88foru: LOL, I'm not going anywhere.
""They"" tried last week, I should say that much, but, god-forbid... I do not want to go - at least, not yet. And certainly not because few people cannot tolerate what I have been doing. So, I wont follow HR."
[T],houruoha,2010-06-03T21:11Z,"@2040
