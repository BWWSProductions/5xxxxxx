,TheQw,2011-05-18T19:46Z,Are these the full-length or international version(s)?
,Goblikon,2011-07-26T00:46Z,"@TheQw
I believe this is the full version, from what I understand the international version was one single movie, with a 2:23:00 runtime. The original was split into two movies, 1st part at 02:25:23 and 2nd part at 02:21:23. So the times listed in the info for this torrent would mean it's the original release.

I'm looking forward to watching this, so thanks neonrainbow for uploading."
