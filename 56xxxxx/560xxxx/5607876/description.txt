    When Timmy drives off on the farmer's brand new quad       
    bike, Shaun, Bitzer and the flock have to give chase by   
    any means available. Very soon half the animals on the   
    farm have joined in the chase. Can the sheep rescue       
    Timmy and return the quad bike before the farmer finds     
    out?
