,Taught,2010-06-06T09:40Z,"Fucking SWEET!!!! It's finally done! I installed the main Sims 3, World Adventures, High End Loft Stuff, and Ambitions from you. IT ALL WORKS PERFECTLY! You just needa follow the instructions (which are simple and easy to follow).

Note: Ambitions DOES fix the problem with the game not working.

,Alefaye,2010-06-07T08:29Z,"Firstly, thanks for the upload!

I was able to get it installed and it works except anything to do with the expansion does not show. As in there is no text, but I can select it.  I don't know if I'm explaining this correctly.. but for example, I can choose a character trait, but it only shows the picture. It doesn't tell me what it is or what it does. And I can go to the salong and get a tattoo, but the pictures, descriptions and etc do not show up. Has anyone else had this problem and was able to fix it?

ETA: screen shots because I'm bad at explaning things

I've downloaded ""The Sims 3"", ""The Sims 3 : World Adventures"" from you guys and is currently downloading this one. I can't get ""World Adventures"" to work with the base game and ""Ambitions"" is known to fix that problem.. so now i'm just playing with ""The Sims 3"". I just want to ask if i still need to go through the updates that's instructed in installing ""World Adventures"" or just installing this one will also install those updates?"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-06-07T17:32Z,"Hi,


Yes, you'll still need to apply those Updates in order to Install WA. You could try the following: first Install Ambitions and Install WA after that, but I'm not sure if it'll work.

@Taught

But does it work when you create a new family? If yes, then there are probably some corrupt files in the SaveGame you copied to the Game.



@hayley0126

Well, I can't guarantee that, since you can't open Windows files on a MAC, but you can try it and give us the result. Also you could try to make a .ISO of the files and then Mount (or burn) that image and thén Install it on a MAC.

,Taught,2010-06-09T00:15Z,"Yeah, it works when I create a new family. So how exactly do I fix these corrupt files that I have? Or do I have to start over and create a new family? or re-install?"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-06-09T09:30Z,"Hi,

   I don't think reinstalling the Game will fix the problem. If you backed up the SaveGames from an other The Sims 3 Installation, you have to backup the ""Saves"" folder in  ""My Documents"". You could try to delete and replace the SaveGame again and see if it works. Probably not though."

@Andy1119

Did you extracted all the files from the .rar file to a folder on your desktop first, before Installing? 
If that didn't work, then it's probably a corrupt file in the downloading. In this case I'm afraid you need to re-download the torrent.

You don't need to Mount anything in order to play, just read the ""Crack"" -part in the Installation Guide. 
You have to copy the files ín the ""Crack 1"" folder to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin   and REPLACE them by the existing ones.

@mr_jellyneck

You have to extract the files in the .rar file using WinRar (Which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org ), otherwise you'll get that error.
Drag & Drop áll the files in the .rar file to a folder on your Desktop and thén start the Installation.


@Nogriefing

Try this:

1. Uninstall Ambitions.
2. Restart your PC (!).
3. Reinstall Ambitions.
4. See if the problem is solved now.


@lovestoned90

Please re-read the crack -part in the Installation Guide and read carefully whére to put which crack.

,daniellazainuddin,2010-07-22T13:00Z,"i have problems with the mods and package folder.
i currently have patch 1.12 for the base game and 4.0 for ambitions..i dont know where to put the mods folder, the resource cfg and also the package files.."
,IZZY-E,2010-07-24T08:36Z,"Ok I figured this installation out. You need all expansion packs and the base game from Games4theworld to install this. So you need to download The Sims 3 base game, World Adventures, High End Loft Stuff, and Ambitions all from Games4theworld which all can be found here on thepiratebay and neet to be installed the order i mentioned. Just follow their guide until you get to the point where you open up the launcher to update the game as directed. The essential key to being able to install these expansion packs is to avoid updating ""The Sims 3"" base game to version 1.14. If you do, then the games will not work. So after you got the expansion pack ACTUALLY installed on your computer, you will eventually be instructed from the installation guide to update the game. Go ahead and go to the update tab from the launcher as directed and download the updates. Note that when you clicked update now it will bring up the download manager and download two updates. The first update is so you update the expansion pack which is ok because it will not update The Sims 3 base game to 1.14. The second update is to update The Sims 3 base game to 1.14 which YOU CANNOT DO. So when the updates are done downloading, a window will pop up and ask you if you want to allow the installation of the updates to continue (giving you the option of yes or no). ONLY CLICK YES FOR THE VERY FIRST POP UP WINDOW. Because the first window that pops up, is for the installation of expansion update. The second is for the sims 3 which will update the sims 3 base game to version 1.14. So one your done installing the first update a second window will pop up and all you have to do is click no and the sims 3 base game will not update to version 1.14. After that update step go ahead and crack it and move on to the next expansion pack and repeat what i just explained. Note that when your about to install the next expansion pack, it will tell you that ""The Sims 3"" base game needs to be updated. Go ahead and allow it to update because it will update The Sims 3 but not to version 1.14. So all in all your final versions of all the games should come out to this.

The Sims 3: 1.12.70.006001
World Adventures: 2.9.10.007002
High End Loft Stuff: 3.5.8.007001
Ambitions: 4.0.87.006001

Have any questions about my instructions just comment here and I'll check in and see if i can help. "
,romanl123,2010-07-28T23:50Z,"I installed all of the expansion all from games4theworld and when i press play i starts loading then stops shows me a window saying ""you have installed unofficial copy of Sims please quit or update"", but the problem is that i can't update ambitions and all the others are up to date so maybe there's a method to manually update because no matter how many times i refresh the launcher it says all of them are up to date but it says that ambitions is version 0.00.. plz help"

,IZZY-E,2010-07-29T05:35Z,"Ok, recently i updated both The sims 3 and ambitions to version 1.14 and 4.2. What i'm thinking when it shows that a version of the game is 0.0 is that it does not have the proper crack or tslhost. So you can download the updates manually by searching for them, you should be able to find em, and then once you get the updates installed to the latest version, get the cracks from these sites.
The Sims 3 1.14- http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/sims-3-ver-1-14-11-no-dvd-crack-1155181/

Ambitions 4.2-  http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/sims-3-ambitions-ver-4-2-32-no-dvd-crack-1155210/

You have to join the site to get the links to download the crack so go ahead and do that then download the cracks and crack it from the program files.

If you have trouble installing the update by it telling you invalid file error, that means the two files that you replaced by the crack are gone. So what you need to do is get the original files and replace the cracks then run the update.

For the sims 3 it should be ""TS3.exe"" and ""TSLHost.dll""

Ambitions should be ""TS3EP02.exe"" and ""TSLHost.dll"" (The TSLHost.dll files from both games are NOT THE SAME so don't use the same one for both games)

Hope I hepled!"

,IZZY-E,2010-07-30T01:11Z,"@romanl123

So what you're saying is that you have the sims 3 updated to version 1.14 and ambitions updated to version 4.2 and you downloaded both cracks from the sites i listed and installed them to their proper directories and it's still asking you for the cd? If so, then that's pretty weird cuz i already installed this on 3 different computers and they all work perfect. Are you using one crack for both games? If you are then it won't work. Usually if a game says that the cd is required then it means that the improper crack has been placed, or the crack your using is incompatible with your version so you would need to download an updated crack. Make sure not to use the cracks provided with the torrent you downloaded if you updated your games to the latest version because they WILL NOT WORK. I tried updating my version of the sims 3 to version 1.14 and i saw that it showed my sims 3 version to 0.0.0 by using the cracks that were provided on the torrent. I downloaded the crack provided on the site I provided and cracked it and then launched the launcher and the light came back on and showed it to version 1.14. I did the same to Ambitions and it's working just fine for me.

Comment back and see if anything changes.

,IZZY-E,2010-08-02T07:52Z,"@ braemon

Ok i see your problem. Like i posted above, when your game says ""invalid file error"" it means that you cracked the game and tried to install the update. What you need to do is get the original files (the ones you replaced by the crack) and replace the crack and then install the update. Oh and the original files that your going to have to get have to be from your current version of the game. After you install the update, go ahead and get the crack for that specific version because the crack provided on this torrent will not work for the updated version of ambitions and the sims 3 base game. You can get the crack for ""The sims 3"" base game version 1.14 here http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/sims-3-ver-1-14-11-no-dvd-crack-1155181/

for Ambitions version 4.2 http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/sims-3-ambitions-ver-4-2-32-no-dvd-crack-1155210/ 

You have to join the site to get the download links but I confirm that these cracks work with the latest versions. For that ""Unable to start game Service initialization failed"" error I think all you have to do is make sure you've got all the games cracked properly. Go ahead and try that and get back to me."

Download and install (I am not a bot or an evil virus-spreader, honest folks!):
http://www.ntcore.com/files/ExplorerSuite.exe

Go to ""C:\Program files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Ambitions\Game\Bin""

And find a program called ""TS3EP02""

**Copy this file somewhere where you can find it again, we need to make a backup (for when EA releases an official patch)**

Right click the original file > ""open with CFF explorer""

You now have a window open ""CFF explorer - [TS3EEP02]

On the left, under ""NT Headers"", there should be a tab called ""File Header"" Click it.

Then click on the area, towards the right of the window, labelled ""Click Here""

A ""Chacteristics"" box will open. Check the option ""App can handle >2gb Address space""

Click ok

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DONE THE BACKUP AS I SAID EARLIER**

Close CFF explorer

save changes to original file.

Hopefully it will work for you too.

When EA releases a patch that fixes this, or if this didn't work for you, simply find the original copy you made (because you did do that didn't you?) and overwrite the modified file with the original copy. This will allow the patch to install (because it won't on a modified .exe) and will revert the changes we made above

1. Please be sure you have a Bittorrent client first. I recommend uTorrent. Now, click on ""Download this Torrent"" and it should automatically open in uTorrent and start Downloading. 
When the file is done Downloading, right click on the Torrent in the list and choose ""Open folder"" (or something like that).

Yes, you NEED the base Game in order to run this Expansion.
I recommend you uninstall everything, restart your PC and then post your problem 

exactly on our Forum: www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com ; we'll guide you from there.

Yes, this Game works fine on a MAC, but you'll need to do some steps different. I

No, there's no need to Mount anything. You just need to be sure that you're copying 

the Crack files to the EXACT correct folder, as described in our Installation Guide.

You shouldn't double-click the NoCD crack to apply it; you need to copy it to the Game Directory as described in the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"".

[T],Games4theworld,2011-04-01T23:49Z,"Hello,

@Dogz369

  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. 

When you're done with above, please do the following:

1. Install our Late Night torrent.
2. Install out Outdoor Living Stuff torrent.
3. Apply this fix: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-latest-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems
4. Your game should work fine no!

@rld6869

Please install our LN and OLS torrents and then apply this fix: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-latest-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems

,Minzey123,2011-04-24T12:07Z,"Hello there, I have a question: If my installation for Ambitions has some errors, is it really necessary to reinstall all the expansions of The Sims 3 to fix it? My laptop is rather slow for all of them, and I only need Ambitions. "

if you guys have the same problem I did just download the fix that they link to and follow the instructions in there.

,coquelicot92,2011-06-03T22:58Z,"Hey, thanks for the upload! 
It worked ok when I extracted the file, then it installed ok too. 
But then I didn't really understand what to do with the files in #Crack 1 and 2. Because I don't understand wether I should replace the old files in Ambition/Game/Bin by the ones I have copied and pasted, or if it's the contrary.
Anyway, I've replaced the existing ones by the ones from #Crack, but when I want to launch the game, it says that I need to insert the CD of the Sims 3 Ambition (it was the CD of The Sims 3 that I bought years ago that was in my CDplayer). Please, help! What should I do?? "
,coquelicot92,2011-06-03T23:26Z,"Sorry for my first comment. 
I realised that I had copied-pasted the files of the crack1 folder into the Game/Bin of the Sims Ambitions, instead of the Sims 3. I repaired my mistake, and nw it looks like it could work, only it doesn't. I click on the play button in the laucher, which then close, but nothing happens. It just won't lauch. Why why why??
I'm really sorry, it's the first time in life that I download stuff like that, I'm not really good at it! 
And in case the sims 3 ambitions should never work, what do I do to be able to play with my good old sims 3 all the same? do I delete everything about the sims 3 ambitions and restaure the old TS3 and TSLHost.dll ?
Thanks!"

But for some reason, I can't update it or anything. I can open the launcher but when I tick the new update box and click on install, nothing happens.
Also, before Ambitions, I had The Sims 3 and Late Night, both are cracked versions. And I could still download clothes, sims and hair, all the other stuff (except houses) into my game. Not from the actual download place you can use if you have the original legal game. I downloaded from other sites. But now, as I installed Ambitions, I can't download any stuff at all anymore because when I tick the boxes of what I want to install and then click 'install', again - nothing happens.
The launcher's just messed up. But yes, everything else is fine and works."

Now I haven't found ONE person who answered this for me and I'm getting frustrated. Do I REALLY need to download and install all the other expansions beforehand, or is there something else I'm not doing right?"
