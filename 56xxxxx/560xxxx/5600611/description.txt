Created by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey,

     On his 40th birthday to be precise, Tom Good decides that
	 he's had enough of the rat race and that he and wife Barbara
	 will become self-sufficient. The pair convert their garden into
	 a farm, get in the pigs and chickens, grow their own crops and
	 on one memorable occasion, try to dye their own wool with 
	 nettles. Tom and Barbara would just be lone loons were it not 
	 for their neighbors, the henpecked Jerry Leadbetter and wife 
	 Margot, a social climber who cannot bear chickens wandering the
	 back garden.
