This torrent contains every episode of eXtelevision from its inception till 6-3-10, approximately an 8 month period. Due to the ever evolving filming techniques, early episodes are done in the .wmv format while later episodes are presented uncut in a .mp4 format. Certain .mp4s are 60FPS, which will be the standard as eXtv looks to distribute future episodes through Torrents.
