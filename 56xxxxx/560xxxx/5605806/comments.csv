,Sarkasmi,2010-06-04T02:30Z,"The way the color correction has been done judging by the screens has sure brought out the ""more correct colours"" to the lighter scenes, but made the darker scenes even darker... 

I guess. I haven't seen the earlier version though, but it just looks like the earlier version's screenshots are brighter.

Right now watching it and I'm honestly GUESSING what's happening on screen in the darker parts. 

Some sample screens from a dark part where apparently the prince is using shot arrows to climb a wall:

Just a heads up for anyone.... As I'm right now kinda wondering if I should even watch the rest of it, as the dark parts are ..  well... non-viewable.
