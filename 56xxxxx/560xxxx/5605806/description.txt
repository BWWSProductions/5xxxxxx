IMAGiNE NOTES
Ok guys yes the tag was a joke.....we couldn't help ourselves
Sources used on this one....video was original file given to us by ELEKTRI4KA, many thanks m8
Audio thanks to TA for the source guys
Right about this source, whilst the video is sharper and got more detail to it the colouring is not as good nor is the crop...this release has alot missing off the bottom and lefthandside (shame really).
We've only decided to release this after we were asked so,this is for them or anyone else who wants it
Work done....well needed to resync our audio to this video source and also gave our audio a little tweak .....video needed alot of loving....as the source was well red
Anyway here is some comparsion screens so you can see the cropping difference between sources and the colouring etc....
