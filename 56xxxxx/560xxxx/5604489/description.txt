Include trailers for each volume of the series, as well as a short three-part interview with Anton LaVey (who also does the narration for the films themselves). 

Covers Included.

1 2 3 being uploaded directly after this, some pretty sick stuff, if you are unsure maybe you should try the trailers first.
