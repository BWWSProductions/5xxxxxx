,slackgit,2011-12-29T21:10Z,"Confirmed. Track a4 is broken. Uploader thanks for the up but you should check this stuff! I use to get errors in flacs and discovered I had a bad stick of RAM.

TO FIX: you can decode the file by using the -F option on the command line. Flac will ignore the error and decode anyway. Result appears to sound okay."
