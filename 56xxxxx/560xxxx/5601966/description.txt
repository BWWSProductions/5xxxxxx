Gig Young was just beginning to toughen up his previously lightweight screen image when he starred in Hunt the Man Down. In a tense, tight, 68 minutes, public defender Paul Bennett (Young) dedicates himself to freeing an innocent man who has already spent 12 years in jail. Accused of murder, transient Richard Kinkaid (James Anderson) had been unable to afford proper legal representation at his first trial. With no new evidence, Bennett is obliged to solve the murder himself, and to do that he must track down the original witnesses to the crime. The cast is a film buff's paradise, ranging from leading ladies Lynne Roberts and Carla Balenda to featured players Harry Shannon, Iris Adrian, Mary Anderson, Gerald Mohr, Cleo Moore and prolific voiceover artist Paul Frees.
