,Anthony1234,2010-06-08T20:37Z,"@K10ud really, whats up its absolutely fine on my computer, what exactly is your problem ?"

,DeltaPan,2010-06-18T20:06Z,"Being an AVI it should play fine but it occurs to me that it isn't actually a straight AVI, @ 699.39Mb, it undoubtedly has been encoded with a codec to get it down from Gb's it would be as a straight .avi file, it likely has a DivX or XviD or another common codec used to shrink it a fair bit.

So while as immediate reaction i think K10ud is an asshole, he may just be an infrequent or new torrent user who may not have an updated codec pack installed and so having issues which do sound like the file isn't decoding so thinking asshole, on reflection, isn't fair really.

If K10ud comes back.

Use VLC media player or install a a free codec pack, which is the better idea.

Links.

VLC...

Codec pack.

[Standard is better.]

That goes for any other infrequent or new downloader of torrent video media, you require codecs, VLC has a universal codec which plays most media but if preferring another media player they need to access relevant codecs, which are compressor/decompressor algorithms, co-mpres-dec-ompress = codec.
[K Lite has Media Player Classic home cinema which is good as well.]

So if you haven't got codecs or VLC player installed and want to view a majority of video media uploaded on torrent, download and install those, all free, no catches, no spyware

Peace. : )"

,TobyzMama,2010-08-31T22:07Z,"@ Delta Pan - lol.  Very funny and helpful response.  I'm new, so here's my question -

Okay... I am new to this.  My neighb showed me this site yesterday.  What is a ""seeder"", what is a ""leech"", and why are people putting viruses on this?  How do I make sure that my download does not have a virus?  fyi, I'm gonna repost this a couple of times to help make sure I get a response.  Thanks!"
,Anthony1234,2010-09-05T04:06Z,"@TobyzMama A seeder is how many people are also sharing the file with the rest of the site, and a leecher is how many people are downloading the file. I think anyway.

This file does not contain any viruses either.

Thank you."
