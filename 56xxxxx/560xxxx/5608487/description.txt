A little late this time. But here it is, finally.

Sorry for the wait.

There are a few bonus tracks and some more wallpaper there this time. Other than that, just a bunch of great new tracks for you to listen to.

SEEEED!

Seeya in July!

For a file list click on the number next to "files" above. ^ up there. to the < left a little.


(EDIT: WTF is with the torrent name? It wasn't that way when I hit the upload button! Anyway. I tried to edit and it will not let me edit and since every time I've tried to re-up something it's told me "torrent already exists in database" or some such... forever until I add files or something to alter the original hash.. I'm leaving it for now. Maybe forever it will be the "Musiaylist" and well.. that SUCKS!!)

OOPS Another mistake. Although I give credit in the blog, the NFO does not contain
the cover art credits, so here they are:
