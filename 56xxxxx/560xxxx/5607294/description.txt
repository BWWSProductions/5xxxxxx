This is a Swedish Nivea TV commercial from the nineties.

I captured it back then with the first ATI All-In-Wonder graphic card.
ATI had their own video codec that is not usable today, but 
I managed to convert it to a VOB file, so don't flame me for it.

Just a sweet natural young girl in the shower, but I do miss
these old commercials where they showed quite a bit more 
skin than what they do today...
