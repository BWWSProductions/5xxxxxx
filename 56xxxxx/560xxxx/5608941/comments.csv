harsh, man"
,VixtoSirchy,2010-06-07T06:22Z,"this movie is INCREDIBLE for what it is.
its fucking megaman. you will never make an amazing movie out of that. 
AND it had $0 for a budget

its a fan film. so give it the respect it deserves as a fan film and not a big studio feature. 

who would watch a megaman movie and expect anything better than this?"
,blueblood95,2010-06-07T15:21Z,What a piece of shit this is.
,isepiq,2010-06-07T23:45Z,"My son really enjoyed this movie.  Thank you for the upload.

There IS an audience for this type of film.

IMHO

,NitLions,2010-06-08T05:08Z,I don't care how bad everyone says this movie is. Its fuckin MEGA MAN!!! Those games were the BEST!! Oh man when u could change which mega man u were for different bosses n shit!! Hell Yeah Boyiiieeee!!! This movie can't be anything but EXCELLENT and shame on all of you for not knowing enough to know that this movie rocks b4 u even saw it!! OMG its not fucking the Lord of the Rings with a trillion dollar budget and a fat nerd to direct it!!! Boo hoo cry cry cry!! STFU and learn your place when it comes to MEGA MAN!! MEGA MAN ALWAYS WINS SO THE MOVIE WINS AND YOU FAIL!! CAPITAL LETTERS IN YOUR FACE IF YOU ARE NERD ENOUGH TO CARE!!
[T],dramacore,2010-06-08T08:24Z,"thanks, i'd rather see a fan film with lesser known people over some hollywood fuckheads trying to make a profit off our childhood enjoyment any day.

keep doing what you're doing.  people who can't appreciate a b-movie, go back to watching your mind numbing reality shows that sell you bullshit you never needed."
,NitLions,2010-06-08T09:55Z,"I had to come back and say that I've watched 5 minutes of this film and can already tell that its fucking amazing!! Dr. Wiley's mustache for example is the best thing I've seen in a cold minute!!! This dude neonrainbow worked to put this movie up there for fun people who enjoy a picture-show for what it is. This is a movie with horrible acting and zero money but fills a huge gap in the lives of citizens all over the world, and that gap is no Mega Man movie. Watch this movie and laugh, make fun of it, picture how you would do it better in your head, tell your friends to watch how fake it looks, but ENJOY IT!!! And thank the guy who put it here only for YOUR ENJOYMENT ya assholes. BOO HOO this movie isn't gonna win an award, Im gonna crawl back to my parents basement and cry and moan about it and write a blog about how it ruined my life that Mega Man wasn't a blockbuster hit. U nerds make me sick!! Thanks again Neon, sorry to vent but man these posts are so whiney and bitchy I can't help it"
[V],neon,2010-06-08T11:36Z,your welcome NitLions..thats what the comments box is for....you got my vote to make you president of the mega man fan club :)
[T],dramacore,2010-06-09T06:29Z,"this is kind of related, video game homage diy movie: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4754088/Press_Start_The_Movie%282007%29"
,mmaxc,2010-06-09T08:17Z,this movie is awesome too bad for the people who don't appreciate non holly wood films shame on you guys. This is the best movie for its kind unless you can provide a better one hahahahaha which is not at least megaman fans can enjoy this movie. I have finished all of megaman game from nes to ps2 and they all rock so for the people who have bad comments on this fuck you all don't say that don't download this movie people can choose what they want no matter what the quality of the film is..........................
[V],neon,2010-06-10T21:56Z,well said mmaxc :)
[V],matimike,2010-06-13T02:20Z,a/v 10 thanks
,pregnantbabies,2010-09-04T05:14Z,"To all the people saying this is a shit film, it's a non-profit fan film. Of course it's not gonna have the same budget as batman or whatever. I personally think this is one of the best videogame-to-film movies ever. Better than anyone has done from hollywood. I urge you all to download this!"
,Shnazzyone,2011-01-02T18:01Z,I don't know what everyone is expecting here.. I'm watching this flick expecting a delightfully low budget fan film. I don't expect top notch plot and writing or special effects. My only expectation is it will be infinitely better then watching the absolutely terrible Legend of zelda fan movie that was so bad it's pretty much the only example of Nintendo squelching fanmade content.
