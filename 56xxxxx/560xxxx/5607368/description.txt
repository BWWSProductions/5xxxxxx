Found this torrent a couple of days ago, and anyone who likes 80's music can't go far wrong with this.

23 CD's in total in this torrent - I wont list all the songs for obvious reasons, but you can always open up the torrent and have a look through, see if it's something you fancy!

My upload speed is capped to 40kb/s so it may take a while to download the full torrent, just to let you know in advance. But i wont be uploading any more torrents until this one is well seeded so it'll be going the fastest it can be.

i would ask everyone to seed afterwards because my upload speed crashes even further when i download, and this one will stop me downloading anything for the next couple of days so try to be nice ;)



Oh, and enjoy it of course!!!
