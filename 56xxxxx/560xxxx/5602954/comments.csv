just a quick question. wasn't there 3 episodes at an hour each? or is it only 2 hours total without all the adverts? thanks, Ryan."
,cigaretteburns,2010-11-01T13:29Z,pickyantivirus there were three 45 minute shows (without ads) making a total of 2 hours 15 minutes. Entire first series is here.

But if I want to separate it into 3 episodes files, what software is to be used?"
