,nukeZ3r0,2010-06-04T21:39Z,...that's what she said...
,ionlyknow,2010-06-04T23:29Z,"@nukeZ3r0
Word! xD"
,russianbar,2010-06-05T12:06Z,is this the full game or do you need the dvd image http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5190578/X-Plane_9_Disk_1   to play
,thasro,2010-06-05T17:34Z,"The 51GB folder should be the full game with everything installed including all of the scenery. However, you have to have Disc 1 to actually play it out of demo mode."
,hurukhan,2010-06-05T18:10Z,"@thasro
So you're basically saying that downloading this whole chunk of files is worthless without the Disc1?
Is there some crack available? Already on TPB?"
,hurukhan,2010-06-05T18:12Z,Also is this one single 51GB file? Or is it the 8 DMGs compressed in one single file? Cause I don't have a Bluray burner ;)
,russianbar,2010-06-05T20:12Z,Thanks Thasro
,thasro,2010-06-06T23:15Z,"I haven't downloaded this particular x-plane torrent but my guess would be that it's one big 51GB file like the other x-plane torrents. This would be the end result if you had installed from all the dvd's. So, if this is like the other torrents all you would have to do with this is unzip it and use disc 1 to play it."
,cyberfoxlt,2010-06-07T10:24Z,"The last X-Plane 9 uploaded was a 50GB .zip file with 60k+ tiny data files inside. I assume this torrent would be the same, cause of the X-Plane file system."
,macster2010,2010-06-08T16:23Z,"ok let me be clear!   this is the Mac Version of the game, and this particular File is  the game folder of the game  with added improvements with the Entire World scenery installed, Its alot like my other game folder, just with more things added to it...   you can either get the other one  or this one  its ur choice... and yes u'll also need to download this to be able to play out of demo mode, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5190578/X-Plane_9_Disk_1"
,hurukhan,2010-06-10T16:07Z,"Ok! Thank you very much for your help guys!
Please keep this torrent up, because I really want this game, but my HD is too full to support it for now.. So I'll go to work and backup the most I can, then I'll download the 2 files! Nearly 60gigs LOL!!!
Thanks again! :)"
,macster2010,2010-06-17T13:11Z,I also highly suggest you seed this as much as possible cause I will be getting a custom build PC soon  adn most likely will be using Linux on that one..  and  well this MBP is gonna go somewhere else...    its getting way to slow for me.. so its gonna either go to my mom or I might just sell it... lol
,MuttleyPT,2010-06-18T01:57Z,"More seeders please.......
