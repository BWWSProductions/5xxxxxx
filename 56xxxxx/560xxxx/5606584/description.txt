Filmed in March '99 at San Francisco's legendary Fillmore and seen here in letterbox format with great sound, High Grass Dogs finds Tom Petty and his Heartbreakers in fine form, charging through a series of tunes from the guitarist-singer-songwriter's first album ("Breakdown") to his latest (four tunes from Echo). Petty's core musicians (guitarist Mike Campbell, bassist Howie Epstein, and keyboardist Benmont Tench) have been together for so long that their onstage communication is almost telepathic; the emphasis is always on dynamics and interplay instead of bombast.
