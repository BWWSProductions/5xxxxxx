,njtsx,2010-08-23T00:32Z,"Damn, I hate this fuck. ""Find Your Love"" is one example of the many explosive aural diarrhea cases splashed across US radio stations. It's shit like this that makes me hate my own country. Fucking unintelligent pricks like this guy ride the wave, make people dumber with their music, and are rewarded with a fat stack of cash."
,QborT,2010-08-26T16:41Z,Fuck Drake the loser kid got famous on Degrassi.  How can you have any sort of credibility when you made your fame on a Canadian teen drama.
,dommels,2010-08-30T14:17Z,this isn't the complete cd it misses best i ever had # 15
,braatabeatz,2010-09-04T19:30Z,wow i hate people that complain about the quality of free stuff... lol... oh and Drake does suck.... well he's alright... overrated.  He's da homie though... ;)  LONG LIVE THE PIRATE BAY... AND WINODWS 7 (it saves me from many of this sites viruses lol)

,TwinAss,2010-10-02T03:55Z,"haha, just need to comment on the haters, talking down Drake. 

This album is seriously great. If you dont like it go idolize some drug dealer with crapy beats and gun wounds, if that kind of thing makes it more real to you.. You are obviously not listening to the music, or to music in a more generalized sense... 

""It's shit like this that makes me hate my own country""

lol. ok. omg. 

Greetings from Sweden dudes. "
,organiclight,2010-10-27T19:28Z,"How about all the people who are hating just shut the fuck up and go out and make a better album then. Go on, go out and make a multi million dollar selling album so that you can legitimately critique an artist otherwise keep your negative opinions to yourself because no one cares to hear from you losers."
,KevanGC,2010-11-14T06:16Z,"Thanks. I'm downloading at 1.5MBPS, and the quality is great!"

,youtor,2011-07-20T08:29Z,"@ QborT If you judge and artist on where he came from. your really fucking ignorant and retarded, it shouldnt matter where he got famous or what he did in his past. He makes good-ass music. Drake could be gay with lil wayne for all i care (and all you should care) as long as he doesnt sing or rap bout gay shit then you should be bumpin his shit"
,Sturzz,2011-08-20T05:04Z,Didnt think i would like this but its a top album. Cheers 
,dougr944,2011-10-27T21:31Z,"Oh my god.  This album is horrible.  His voice is monotone, he has no vocal range, and his lyrics aren't well-crafted."
