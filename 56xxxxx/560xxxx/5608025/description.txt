Monster Road is a feature-length documentary that explores the dazzling and fantastic worlds of legendary underground clay animator Bruce Bickford.

Entirely self-taught, the 57 year old Bickford works alone in a small basement studio in his house near Seattle. His films, especially the dark and magical clay animations he created for musician Frank Zappa in the 1970s, have achieved cult status worldwide, even though very little of his 40 year body of work has been edited or released to the public.
