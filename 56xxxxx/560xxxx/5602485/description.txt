For three days in 1971, former US soldiers who were in
Vietnam testify in Detroit about their war experiences
Nearly 30 speak, describing atrocities personally
committed or witnessed, telling of inaccurate body
counts, and recounting the process of destroying a
village. The atrocities are casual, seem routine, and are
sanctioned or committed by officers. Images from the war
illustrate the testimony; there's a side discussion among
veterans about racism and a couple of interviews about
the soldiers' self-realization. The testimony appears in
the US Congressional Record on April 6 and 7, 1971. A
"winter soldier" contrasts with Paine's "summer soldier
and sunshine patriot."
