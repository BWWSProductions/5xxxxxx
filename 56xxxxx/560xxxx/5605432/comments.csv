(for some reason i get database error when i try to post this onto the relavent page)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-03T13:22Z,"@sdcheeran: Thanks for the info. But, 'cause is [lepton] encode in question (bigger brother of late [quark]) audio track is - mono. 
Now, someone who have PS3 should download my input (source) and try to play that one (XviD with stereo track). And we will know for sure, is Prism's V2 TS clean already or not.
I still have the settings and if it worked even once, I will do some another So.ny title to see if that is repeatable or just ""a glitch"" of some kind.

On side note, Database error occurs when one try to submit text containing prohibited words or links  and you should make only a slight change (like I did with the name of manufacturer) and error is gone.

Unfortunately, as you've seen on Waterworld, such text-filters cannot filter-out comments from evil men. Also, thank-god, such filtering cannot measure intelligence of some people. Well..."
