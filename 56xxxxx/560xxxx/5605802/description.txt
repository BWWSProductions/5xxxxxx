Jessie Cox is coming off the first win of her career. Granted it was technically a tie, and she won through a tie breaker, but a win is a win. A girl's first win at Ultimate Surrender always instills confidence. Jessie is using that newfound confidence and is starting to really understand the mechanics of this sport. 

Welcome Gia DiMarco to The Ultimate Surrender mat. This hot sexy fit MILF was built for this. Her lean body and sexy physique is a great addition to the the roster for Season Seven. Gia has no wrestling experience but considers herself a bad ass. We'll see about that... 

The Membership has been very vocal about seeing matchups with rookies vs. wrestlers they might be able to beat. We listened, we complied! Do not miss this great matchup with two incredibly sexy wrestlers!
