,Afiniasmenos,2010-06-11T08:36Z,steamclient.dll also to me the ESET says that trying to do something to windows file svchost. The crack works but today when i start the PC the ESET post this message. What to do? I want to play it. Anyone else have problems?
,Felony69,2010-06-23T09:34Z,"I copied the crack into the ""Binaries"" folder but the game is still a ""demo"". Keeps wanting me to buy the full version. Did I drop the files in the wrong folder?"
,Hmoobphajej,2010-06-30T06:48Z," Sorry, but as of this moment. amivoytec you are no longer trustworthy with uploads. Virus after virus and naive people still download. Look at the comments people before you get yourself into some real deep shit. If you don't believe that the game file and this are both viruses. Try it out, and tell me if you'll ever be able to play it and let's see how long it takes for you to notice these spywares and maleware hijacking your system. Here is the last warning from me on this game. Download it from someone else, if not try somewhere else. "

Hello man. I always provide pure scene releases. Recent AVs are very restrictive to packed/crypted files, so scene productions are often detected as viruses, but this is false alarms. Scene releases have SFV files, you can check the flawless of upload (example with Total Commander). Cheers."
