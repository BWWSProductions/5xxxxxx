Ep#66: "Pig Trouble" (720p)
Original Airdate: May 24, 2010  
When Bitzer injures his foot and can't work, the Farmer chooses the pigs to take over his role. The power crazy pigs take the opportunity to turn the farm into a porky paradise - at the sheep's expense. Bitzer tries in vain to warn his master what is going on behind his back, but it's Shaun who steps in and restores the status quo ante.

While trying to retrieve his ball, Bitzer falls into a muddy pond. When Shaun sees a big, blobby, shambling 'thing' squelching across the field, he's convinced they are being attacked by a swamp monster.
