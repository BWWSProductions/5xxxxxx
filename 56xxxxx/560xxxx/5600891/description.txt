Eckhart Tolle is known worldwide for his teaching about spiritual enlightenment through the power of the present moment. On this DVD, viewers come face-to-face with Tolle for a transformational meeting with the respected teacher. In clear simple language, Tolle explains the process of entering the 'miraculous' state of presence that is always available to us. By ceasing the 'mental noise,' we can dissolve our egos and enable the 'flowering of a new consciousness.'

Enjoy!
