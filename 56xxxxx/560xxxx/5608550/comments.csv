,ableev,2010-06-05T13:16Z,need subs for this episode
,DeltaPan,2010-06-05T15:21Z,"Right, well.

http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0775431/fullcredits#cast

Lists Amanda Walsh as Katie in the full credits and while it also lists other members of the full cast not seen in this episode, i look to Ep1 and Amanda aka Katie is not listed at all...
http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1091289/fullcredits#cast

Added to that, it says ""A pair of brilliant theoretical physicists meet a woman who shows them how little they know about the real world. "", which is the theme of this episode.

The subtitles are here... (Or search elsewhere)
http://www.tvsubtitles.net/tvshow-154-1.html

Which lists ""Pilot"" episode before The Big Bran Hypothesis"" which is the first episode with Penny etc, so the pilot is this show.

So those pilot subs shown there as pilot are in fact the ones relevant to this episode.
Countries page...
http://www.tvsubtitles.net/episode-8512.html

And is the same as these, notice, preair on last 2, Norway and Swedish subtitles already on 2 as well.

I recognised this when i downloaded again, it was uploaded back in 2007, as in the ""Preair"" versions, though didn't mind seeing it again, deleted this from 1st download ages back.

Glad i could help!

Peace. : )"
,ableev,2010-06-05T15:27Z,"there is no subs on tvsubtitles, i chek it. 
i will be happy, if someone tell me, what they are talking about"
,DeltaPan,2010-06-05T15:42Z,"Here's the script matey, enjoy.

Takes a few seconds to load.

And if English is problematical for you, simply copy and past pages text on that script into a document, then copy and paste into the lot into the Babelfish translator for block text and you'll get the whole thing translated into a language that's easier for you, copy and paste back into a document and print it out, simples.

Again, glad i could be of help.

Peace. : )"
