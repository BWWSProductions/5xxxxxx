HANGER is a horrifying tale of revenge that begins with a back-alley abortion, and ends with a bloodbath so vicious that it brings a new meaning to 'an eye for eye.' From pimps to dealers and hookers to junkies, HANGER dives headfirst into the depths of human depravity.  Written by Ryan Nicholson

This is NOT the cut-to-shit version of this movie that's floating around other trackers, nor is it the german dubbed uncut version. This is ripped straight from the Region 1 UNCUT English language DVD.
