A seemingly pleasant fellow, Arthur goes berserk and rapes any woman
in front of him wearing gold earrings. One woman tells the
investigating detective (who is Arthur's uncle) she was raped, and
flashes back to an erotic love making scene. Another one, a lesbian,
relates a story that has to be seen to be believed. Other women
flashback to their encounters with Arthur. We find out from a doctor,
in another flashback, that Arthur underwent a penis transplant with a
just-dead friend, unknowing his friend was a serial rapist who preyed
on golden earring-ed women.
