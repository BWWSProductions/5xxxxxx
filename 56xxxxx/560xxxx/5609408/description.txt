Storyline:
Kirk, an average Joe, cannot believe his luck. Though he is stuck in a seemingly
dead-end job as an airport security agent, Molly, a successful and outrageously
gorgeous babe, has fallen for him. Not only is Kirk stunned, but his friends,
family and his ex-girlfriend, too. Now he has to figure out how to make it work,
even though he would be the first to admit she is totally out of his league.
