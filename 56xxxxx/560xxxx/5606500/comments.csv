But what in the world has made you into a tracker monger?
You have an enormous list of trackers inside the torrent file.  :(
That is a rather counterproductive thing to do.
The fewer trackers you list in a torrent file, the better."

[V],Sagablanc,2010-06-05T19:17Z,To much hit&Run. This torrent want be seeded again before it has 25 new persons that wish to have it. For two days this torrent had almost 30 seeders. This is to bloody stupid .............I don`t know why I bother. This is not very motivating
