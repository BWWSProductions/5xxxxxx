I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

*** PLEASE NOTE - I CAN ONLY SEED OVERNIGHT (USA EASTERN TIME - AFTER MIDNIGHT) - REGARDLESS OF WHAT TIME I UP'D THE TORRENT - PLEASE BE PATIENT - I WILL ALWAYS SEED UNTIL COMPLETED BY 25-50 PEOPLE ***

just an FYI - this is a multi-tracker torrent and the total seed/leech numbers noted on TPB are not accurate - open in your bit torrent client to see 'real' numbers - enjoy brothers & sisters "
