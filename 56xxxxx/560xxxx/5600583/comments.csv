,sdke,2010-06-10T18:56Z,does it works with RSE?
,S3MM7,2010-06-11T20:53Z,"ye sdke,
it does works properly, the only thing what happends when you've installed it is:
When you start GP6 ur internet connection will be stopped for a second, same thing when you shut gp6 down."
,halo24,2010-06-13T03:04Z,I can't get it work ! It says that this is an incorrect license... 
,halo24,2010-06-13T03:18Z,"Use this method and it will work:

***Vinci15  at 2010-06-12 17:15 CET:
Here's what I did to make it work

use http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5600583/Guitar_Pro_6__loader_%28working_%29

install GP6 normally when it comes to open the program use the runner instead
it will ask for local LAN adapter select you adapter and you should see the loading screen and in my case it still asks you for registration
DONT EXIT the loading screen shut down the computer :) by using the power button
when you restart load GP6 normally (Not the Runner) and it worker for me lol"
,electroacoustic,2010-06-13T12:25Z,"Don't work at all...

Fortunately GP5 (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3768546/Guitar_Pro_5.2_with_RSE) working very well and I don't need GP6."
,wesman2232,2010-06-17T10:47Z,"@uploadfreak112
That is an invalid link."
,sdke,2010-06-17T16:16Z,it worked once for me... i opened and check some things. Then second time it didn't want to open.. really sad!!!!
,TesterYYY,2010-06-17T21:27Z,"@sdke
Try remove GP6Runner.dat file in GP6 directory and run again the gp6runner."
,sdke,2010-06-18T18:14Z,doesnt work :( :(
,sdke,2010-06-18T18:50Z,"mmmm.. now it works again :s :s

1: i installed everything, including banks
2: i turned of my internet
3: i patched it with the patch that is in the other torrent
4: i putted my internet on, tried and it failed
5: then i did it with GP6loader and then it worked :s

strange!!!"
,Richaod,2010-06-20T17:35Z,What versions of GP6 does this work for?...
,wesman2232,2010-06-21T22:32Z,"@Richaod lol, the only one there is for now.

@acade365 what will you do once GP6 has an update? The updater also checks the UserID and Key at updater.guitar-pro.com/updater.php, which uses a Database (for authentication) and filelist check to see what files need to be updated."
,Kalma5003,2010-06-24T21:40Z,"How could I know what is my ""default LAN device""

...didn't work"
,GalneryusRee,2010-07-01T02:10Z,"Does this also work for Vista? And if so, do you only need this and the GP6 Demo? "
,GalneryusRee,2010-07-01T02:19Z,So all I need is this and the gp6 demo?
,sb85,2010-08-02T06:04Z,"Fuck! It fukkin' work'd! O_O
