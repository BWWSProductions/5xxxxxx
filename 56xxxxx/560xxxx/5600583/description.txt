This is a working loader for GP6, the only one as far as I know. I can confirm that this is working on windows 7 32and 64 bit.
Just copy into the guitar pro 6 directory and run from the new loader.
ENJOY!

[GP6Runner 1.0]
..patch is based on Pavka's crack method

1. Extract & Copy this application to Guitar Pro 6 directory.
2. Run GP6Runner.exe, select your default LAN device for MAC change (it will be changed every time when you run GP6Runner and reseted to default when you close GP6).
3. Press Apply and Enjoy!

Next time you must run GP6Runner.exe instead of "Guitar Pro 6.exe" or create desktop shortcut for runner. If you want changer runner settings - delete GP6Runner.dat!
