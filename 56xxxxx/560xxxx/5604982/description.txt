320kbps recording of the second part of the Led Zeppelin concert in Los Angeles on September 4th, 1970.
This bootleg is famously known as "Live On Blueberry Hill", named after the cover song Zeppelin performed as the last song of the show.
(I have Part 1 in another torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5604974)
I did not source this; however, I did reorganize/relabel/reseed.
