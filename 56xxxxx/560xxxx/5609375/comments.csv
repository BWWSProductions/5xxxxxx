,bljat,2010-06-05T23:44Z,the screenshots do not look like Doctor Who 2005 to me... maybe this is some kind of time traveling issue ;-)
,08millerj,2010-06-06T05:55Z,remember to call 08000 933 193 if this program has affected you in any way. that means the doctor is real! 
,RALSTON8358,2010-06-06T06:35Z,Thanks.
,jachim72,2010-06-09T19:01Z,bljat: Those screen shots show the current doctor. Don't know what you're (not) seeing....
,shard7654,2010-06-11T23:34Z,the 2005 in the title means it's the fifth series since they restarted the franchise in 2005...
