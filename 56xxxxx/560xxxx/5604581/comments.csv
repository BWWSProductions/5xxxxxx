Thanks to the uploader."

Somewhere a village is missing its idiot. Rush has been proven to be right 99.7 % of the time. I'd say his batting average is pretty damn good. 

Cheers, jwhitt - thanks again :)

Replace the word right with wrong and then your sentence makes sense.  Simple mistake his listeners seem to make to often."

,thunderbum,2010-06-03T07:32Z," ..... Right on cue: No sooner do I write about lunatics coming to places like this to post their illogical rantings and what shows up? An assortment of trolls and sock puppets! LOL!!

News flash, nimrods: Rush employs a team of researchers as well as doing his own research. He also uses the Heritage Institute's resources, and is a member of Lexus Nexus as well as  making use of the materials at the Library of Congress.

Not only that but he has an independent group that audit and compare what he says. They then do their own independent research to see if what he is saying is indeed correct. 

It is this group of independent researchers that grade Limbaugh as to the veracity or error of his research and statements, and they send their findings back to him in monthly reports. 

Which he is why he is at a 99.7% accuracy rate.

I know it bugs the hell out of you effete wankers that your Pantywaist-in-Chief Barry Ovomit  is completely clueless, inept and stupid, but 'facts is facts' no matter how much you wish it weren't so. 

You should be grateful Limbaugh isn't 100% accurate because you'd be having mouth-foaming fits and being involuntarily committed to the nearest psychiatric institution. That would be a tragedy because we here wouldn't have you to laugh at - mind you we'd still have the manchurian president...

The same couldn't be said as to the timocracy infesting the White House that's comprised of thugs, weasels, thieves, tax cheats, brown-nosers, burned out stoners and other assorted corrupt gangsters and home grown terrorists.

Truly the Tammany Hall kakistocracy is ruining America. The left-lib hate America, goodness, family, the Bible/Torah and marriage is succeeding in turning America into another soviet union comprised of 57 States (if you believe little Barry Dunham), comrade Tovarich.

The truth really is a bitch when it exposes the left's true colors but truth has its own attraction.

Actuality presuming someone else is not meant to be married is an opinion.  My observation that no one else can make such a determination is pure logic and yours is mere speculation.

The realm of ""responding emotionally"" is yours, little trick.  Your childish ranting, self appointed scorekeeping, telling others to shut up and even once wishing racist anal rape on one of the other posters betrays the foundation of your motivations."

He said that his rating had slipped slightly last year, but had actually increased in recent months. Anyone who knows anything about statistics should know that such a rating could only ever decrease over time. He's kidding, numbnuts. And he's living rent-free in lefty brains."

,hayesy316,2010-06-06T05:40Z,"Trick, I'm only referring to his ""Rush persona"". The ""America's Truth Detector"" and ""Lovable Little Fuzzball"" stuff is pure showbiz. He's an excellent self-promoter, and the liberal talking heads give him free publicity all the time. He manipulates the mainstream media like a kitten playing with a ball of wool. But the main reason he enrages so many of the left is that his political analysis is usually quite incisive and spot-on. So don't try and misinterpret my comment into some wider context."
