,matt040,2010-06-06T09:47Z,is it uses the line audio from Rx or the same with Noir that uses Imagine's line audio?
,kikeron,2010-06-06T10:06Z,"from the sample, i'd say that audio is still pretty much bad, maybe only a little better than on noir version, but still as it's coming from the background

video: 9/10
audio: 5/10"
,CthePalmrose,2010-06-06T13:28Z,Anyone? Is the sound out of sync in this one? About 13 min into the movie in the SAM version.
