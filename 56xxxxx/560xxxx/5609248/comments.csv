,skillet92,2010-06-05T19:49Z,"thanks for this one!!!
never knew this was there!!

when are u uploading She Is Out Of My League?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-05T20:01Z,"I have upped one ""Unaired pilot"" before last season started, back then as BluRay rip. I get this version just yesterday as Warner ""memorabilia"" disk. So, it's very, very good and funny episode, mainly for people who haven't watched it yet.

Regarding ""Remember me"" you've asked for - I have relatively bad news. Preliminary encoding direct to 360p, and 720 is not possible within size ranges I must hold on to. I can try - but I cannot promise anything. 
Let make a deal: whatever version you see up tomorrow - it is the best one I can make."
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-05T20:02Z,@skillet92: Maybe 10 minutes from now.

,seenoevil47,2010-06-07T17:39Z,Hey are there subtitles available for this ???
[H],politux,2010-07-27T12:47Z,Thank you very much.  I live BitTorrent for this very reason - things that I would never see otherwise are available.
,Axnor,2010-12-05T20:20Z,this is the AIRED pilot
,Dev1991,2011-05-12T18:30Z,"its not the unaired one,that one is different."
,Leib,2012-03-11T02:27Z,This is the AIRED pilot. Kaley Cuoco was not in the original unaired pilot and she sure is here.
,Timbo6669,2012-03-23T04:04Z,Thnx Leib! Your right. This was origianlly unaired but exectutives liked it so it went on air  as the pilot (S01E01) with a revamped start/intro..
