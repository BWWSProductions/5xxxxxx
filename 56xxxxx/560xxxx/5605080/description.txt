Wheels of Fire is the name of a double album recorded by Cream. The
release was largely successful, scoring the band a #3 peak in the UK and a
#1 in the US, and became the world's first platinum-selling double album.

The album was also released as Wheels of Fire (In the Studio) and Wheels
of Fire (Live at the Fillmore) as two single albums, released together, with
similar cover art except: In the UK, the studio album was black print on
aluminium foil, while the Live at the Fillmore album was a negative image of
the studio cover. In Japan, the studio album was black on gold foil, while the
live album was black on aluminium foil. In Australia, both covers were
laminated copies of the Japanese releases (it was never released as a
double album in Australia). In 2003, the album was ranked number 203 on
Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

The sleeve was designed by Australian pop artist and cartoonist Martin
Sharp, who also designed the Disraeli Gears sleeve, and it won the New
York Art Directors Prize for Best Album Design in 1969.
