            The source was hard. Re-encoded it a lot of times and finally
            got a good copy. Check the screens. Increased brightness,cleaned the 
            audio and did my best. I hope you would enjoy. Audio and video
            are perfectly on sync. Enjoy!!

Set in the mystical lands of Persia, a rogue prince and a mysterious princess race 
against dark forces to safeguard an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of
 Time -- a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule
 the world.  Written by Walt Disney Pictures

Adopted from the streets of Nasaf by King Sharaman of Persia, young Dastan grows up
 amongst royalty and quickly earns his place as a mighty warrior and prince. As his 
brothers Garsiv and Tus plan battle strategies, a spy sends word that the Holy City 
of Alamut has been supplying weapons to enemies of Persia. Taking matters into his 
own hands, Tus orders an attack on the sacred city and upon its fall Dastan encounters
 the beautiful Princess Tamina. When King Sharaman dies under mysterious circumstances
 shortly after, and Dastan is accused of his murder, he flees with the princess on a 
harrowing mission to clear his name. Learning from Tamina the true motives behind
 Alamut's invasion, Dastan must embark on a perilous quest to stop an evil mastermind's 
plot for ultimate power with a mystical weapon that can control the very fabric of time.
