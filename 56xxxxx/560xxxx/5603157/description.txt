From the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team (F.A.R.T.) comes this excellent quality video with the original soundtrack restored!

As you probably know, DVD's of season three of The Fugitive were released with a completely new, synthesized music score
which destroyed much of the show's drama.

Now, thanks to the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team, you can enjoy the show in top quality
as it was originally intended to be experienced.
