What is this?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-05-31T16:02Z,"@lilars: Two days ago, in Norway was Eurovision Song Contest, something I watch from childhood.

Well, Germany won with this song and last two days I watched and listened that like zillion times. As Germans say: Ohrwurm (ohr=ear wurm=worm).

Like Craig repeats when audience looks astonished: ""Hey! I am European!"" I can say that too. We are strange... LOL"
,lilars26,2010-05-31T16:09Z,"Ok,I will check it out.
But from now on when I see something
out of the ordinary,I have to ask myself
""Does the Emperor have his clothes on?"""
,lilars26,2010-05-31T16:14Z,"....and yes,you are a strange lot.lol"
,lilars26,2010-05-31T16:51Z,"I see what you mean.This girl is infectious.She is pretty,she can sing,she has great stage presence with a million dollar smile and I think I have fallen in love...again.
It's a keeper.Thank you."
