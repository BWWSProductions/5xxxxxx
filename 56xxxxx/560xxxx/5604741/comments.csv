[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-03T05:01Z,Sorry everyone I won't be uploading Astro Man or Alice in Wonderland. Can't figure out why they aren't ripping right. I have seen a couple other peoples uploads and they said they had problems with some dummy files and that's a little bit out of my league right now. Sorry.
