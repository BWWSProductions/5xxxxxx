[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-04T19:28Z,what equipment did you use to transfer?
,profits,2010-06-05T06:35Z,Too bad it doesn't improve the shitty job of mastering. They need to remaster this and do it RIGHT.
,konejo7,2010-06-05T09:51Z,"Ultra High Quality?
16 bits...44100 khz...
sounds like normal cd "
[T],rjordan21,2010-06-06T01:34Z,"konejo7, maybe the cracks/pops are a good indication it's vinyl........
Anonymous, THANK YOU...can't do much with the source material but the playback is superb.  Smokes the CD....as usual."
,]eep,2010-06-06T01:50Z,"another useless release... same awfull mastering as the cd. So you better stick with one of the guitar hero rips. Those escaped the last stage of mastering called ""fubar as victim of the loudness war""."
[T],rjordan21,2010-06-06T03:35Z,"Jeep.....that's funny.  Although I'm not quite sure what's wrong with your ears.... Listen to The Unforgiven III.... the GH3 version sounds like Lars is playing a kit from SEARS. Thin, thin, thin NO FUCKING BALLS MAN! Loudness or not, this IS THE VERSION TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE.  Unless, of course, you're home spinning your own copy on vinyl.  Anyone else care to share their thoughts? "
[T],rjordan21,2010-06-06T04:58Z,HMVinyl....this is more of what I'm talking about.  Did you get a new cartridge?
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-06T23:16Z,"the cartridge is fine (and costs $200 so i'm not gettin a new one) but i did get a brand new needle :D much less drag on the surface, and a much cleaner sound. i recommend some Billy Joel, just up'd it ;)"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-07T06:14Z,"also, expect some Metallica from me aswell ;)"
