IMAGiNE NOTES
Right here we go again with our v2 of this flick....same sources used both video and audio as our v1.
However we resynced the audio a different way like we did we our dvdr.....and we have test this with nero and convertx version 3 xxx and 4 xxx and it STAYS insync after converting ;-)
Also we've altered our filtering on this aswell ....

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
