1966 Sci-Fi/Horror Roger Corman "cut-up" w/ Dennis Hopper, Basil Rathbone

From Wikipedia:

After aliens contact Earth via radio to inform humans of an impending visit, their ambassador spaceship crashes on Mars. Astronaut rescuers recover only one green-skinned survivor - a female with insatiably vampire-like appetites. Genre director Curtis Harrington crafted this B-movie marvel with footage from the Russian film "Niebo Zowiet." John Saxon, Basil Rathbone, Dennis Hopper, Judi Meredith and horror publisher Forrest J. Ackerman star.

Other Notes:

Queen of Blood is widely cited (nowadays) as an influence on the script of Alien. 

The special effects footage is mostly lifted from the Russian sci-fi film mentioned above, but it is spectacular - really colorful and trippy.

A weird and interesting movie.

A baby-faced Dennis Hopper is worth seeing. Also, the ending is a little creepy.
