""but a vector images look the same no matter what size you make it."" -RGBeffect:

Just because vectors have infinite detail doesn't mean the video does. When you downscale anything into a 640x360, 700MB file and then blow-it back up onto a 1080p display it's gonna be blury.

I HATE when people try to say cartoons don't look any better in HD. If you really can't see a difference than you need to get some fucking glasses. If you don't want to see tiny details and smooth curved lines and gradients, then congratulations, you've had it your way since the 30s. Stop trying to impede progress."
