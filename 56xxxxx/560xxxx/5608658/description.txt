Vaishali (1988) is a Malayalam film directed and edited by Bharathan.[1] Scripted by M. T. Vasudevan Nair, it was an adaptation of a sub-story told in the epic Mahabharatha. In the epic story, Vaisali was an insignificant character, daughter of royal mistress, mastered in Vatsyayana Shastra. She was to attract Rishyashrunga, the son of great sage Vibhadanka, and bring him to the land of Lomapada to end the drought. Quite characteristic to his style, when MT gave prominence to Vaisali, it was to achieve a new dimension.[2] Bharathan, being an accomplished painter, knew how to blend the sensuousness of Vaisali's body with the wilderness of the forest. The songs in this film were written by O. N. V. Kurup.
