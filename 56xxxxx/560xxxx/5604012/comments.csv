,maxicastro,2010-06-11T18:53Z,"I've never seen this movie but sounds good. I'll check it!

As a request, and if you can, I would love any version of Der Rote Baron (The Red Baron) on DVD with at least Spanish subs (it would be great if it had Spanish audio too). It's a 2008 German movie I can't find anywhere on DVD with Spanish audio/subs. There are 2 DVD torrents here with Dutch subtitles, but I don't speak Dutch. I hope you can find anything, be it DVD9 or DVD5. Anything, at least English, but DVD. Thanks a bunch :)"

[T],hjsn1,2010-07-07T06:58Z,"maxicastro: Doesn't look like I can get it with Spanish subtitles or spoken language either, sorry. 

corpse_paint: I no longer have that movie. I deleted it to make way for others. Let it go for a while and eventually someone will get on with it and when they do, make sure you seed it for a while. "
