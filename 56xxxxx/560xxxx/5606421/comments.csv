,TheArtz19,2010-07-19T17:52Z,"can anyone tell me what if any settings you need to change or turn off after installing NIS?
i turned off my internet, installed and then turned off the norton software protection option( i thought i saw that somewhere in the past).
everything worked fine until i restarted and then it didn't work at all. saying there was major problems and i probably needed to reinstall.

that was all with a older version of the trial reset, but i am not sure that was completely the answer. the instructions in the readme seemed fairly short. 
if anyone can give a brief re-instruction it would be much appreciated.
thanks."
