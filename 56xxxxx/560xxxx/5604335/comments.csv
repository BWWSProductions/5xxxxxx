You're just too good to be true :) I expect people here to seed so you set to be more relaxed. Keep up the good work."
,Squalid,2010-06-08T17:59Z,"Hey, i downloaded this game off here first, but when i tried to start it it said ""unable to locate any sufficient 3d engine\card"" summink and fucked off.
what??

and then i tried downloading the other torrent, but then i get ""unable to locate the proper cd"" of which the torrent starter dismissed as ""haha u noob"" when asked.

i have win whatever (the one before vista) and have no 3d card issues and i know how to use daemon tools. its more like this torrent is shit."
