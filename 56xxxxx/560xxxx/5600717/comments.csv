,LMD129,2010-06-14T07:08Z,"Man ! ! ! talk about download speed on this torrent !
I downloaded it on 14 th of June 2010 and my bandwidth is over the roof.
Interestingly enough though not many people seems to commenting if not interrested in this.
I must state though I not yet haven't installed it!

Facinating thing about here is that MAGIX VIDEO PRO X is actually a 3.22 GB plus application and there isn't any 500mb on any where on the web !
So I guess that 3.22GB are add ons package !
Any way I'll let you know how installation worked out for me.
And thanks for the 500mb package. It is realy appreciated."

It may have been the disc itself I will try again,but untill then do u have any suggestions."
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-06-19T06:50Z,"@LMD129

Not sure what the retail size of this program is or if you are thinking of a newer version.

But this IS indeed Magix Video Pro and it DOES work.

Go to GhostWarriorTheGeek on you||tube. Ill bb monday to check my messages, but I generally do tutorials for all my  software uploads, and one was done for this."
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-06-19T06:51Z,"@Deljor 

I only tested the editing of videos. I have not yet tested the burning of it. If it turns out to be on my side, ill seek a fix, but possible save your work as an .avi and burn to disc that way?"

,Search4Lancer,2010-10-16T08:53Z,"Works like a charm, with one minor exception. After a couple hours of editing, I'm uploading to YouTube right now.

The one minor exception being, one of the files I imported was from Freez Screen Video Capture. The cap played fine on it's own, but after pushing it in to the project, there was some crazy inversion flickering going on, and I never found a solution. Don't know which program is at fault for it, but worked around it by muting the video track from the screen cap, keeping the audio track, and importing still images (as the screencap was really just a narrated slideshow)."
,DrRPDB,2010-10-18T08:33Z,Works great!!! Thanks!!!

,Clayhack666,2011-07-14T11:29Z,Download it right now. I feel like this is the one. I need some editing software for school and all that. Sony Vegas was an epic FAIL. (Activation problems) But If this works THANK YOU! and if it doesn't. I'll keep looking. Thanks again. =)
