,demongithara23,2010-06-20T01:01Z,"I retract my thank you - there is no way to play this game as the files are incomplete. There is no type of setup, launcher, nothing but some game files."
,demongithara23,2010-06-20T01:03Z,You should have some clue to know how other games are distributed using this method. You didn't really try to make a playable version at all ...
,Yakuza2004,2010-06-20T01:13Z,Seed guys :)
,Yakuza2004,2010-06-20T01:17Z,Wanna play so really need you guys to seed
,danielonthewall,2010-06-21T06:29Z,First off its an iso file you can burn with dvd decrypter or alcohol. I use alcohol to burn ps2 cause it has a playstation tab. If there is another method please let me know.
,supz,2010-07-01T09:11Z,"Hey demongithara23, you're a bit of a nubzor aren't you?  This isn't a PC game; it's a PS2 game and the ISO is complete.  I just patched it with ESR and ran it on my exploited PS2 and it works flawlessly.  Cheers for the upload danielonthewall."
