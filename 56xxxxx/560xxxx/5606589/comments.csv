,Yedae,2010-06-12T22:43Z,Thanks for the torrent RedHatcc!
[T],RedHatcc,2010-06-13T23:50Z,Your most certainly welcome!
,DaMastaOSpace,2010-06-24T14:20Z,"what does nulled mean?
and does the keygen include?
i know... 
im a noob"
[T],RedHatcc,2010-07-04T07:13Z,"Nulled means it will not call back home to validate itself. I would check in the forums for detailed info we had a member a few days ago ask the same question. 

This copy is good if you want to start a forum and don't have 200 bucks to drop on a license to start with. Although it is suggested if you start to grow and make money with ads, to go ahead and buy a license when you can. "
,ummyeah,2010-07-14T04:45Z,@RedHatcc wouldn\'t happen to have access to Tournament & Ladder Script v2.8.4 from vBulletin do you?  That would make my life right now.
,yunkichang,2010-07-17T15:46Z,Hi please submit a cool ebook about how to be professional on vbulletin 4. I so appreciate it. Please let me know when you uploaded it
[T],RedHatcc,2010-07-20T17:16Z,If you need a specific modification or template for your vBulletin post it on our forums. A link in is in the description and a shortcut is in the torrent. 
,sharloch,2010-07-31T08:56Z,"i only have one question, I see vBulletin is not free but if i use this on my website will it be a problem..? just wanted to know. Thanks"

,Recon501,2010-09-09T02:05Z,"I uploaded the files, verafied them, and edited the config.php file but when i install its bringing me to a Vbulletin page asking me to input my customer number in order to install. I have no customer number.... wtf"
,chong67,2010-09-14T19:06Z,"I got it working on my home PC using W7.  

I think you have to put all your files in 777 first if you are doing in Linux/Unix.

Then run the registration.  Then run the config. Create your db in mysql.

Thats it.  Very easy."
,gerrard_r,2010-09-23T16:20Z,Can you use this on the internet as a normal forum? Can they find out that is torrented?

,ExtremeXboxModz,2010-09-27T06:45Z,"Hi I have everything uploaded and set up a mysql database and when I get to actually installing vBulletin it just says ""You can't continue until keygen.php has not replaced value"""
,train2u,2010-09-27T15:34Z,"RedHatcc, thanks for sharing this!  Can you give a more step-by-step guide on how to set this program up?  

I'm pretty newbie (trying to learn how to start a forum) so I'm already having trouble installing the program.  I don't see a .exe or setup files after unzipping.

 Thanks! "

,peman3232,2011-01-16T10:01Z,The skins all seem to be missing the userprofile folder. Clicking on my profile on the forums leads to a messed up page due to missing images.
,drbookworm,2011-03-08T19:57Z,"keygen.php just won't upload, i keep re-uploading but transfer fails, any idea please?"

,DarkVOX,2011-06-11T16:33Z,"If keygen won't upload, it's being blocked most likely.  Rename it, then try."
,tharun518,2011-06-14T11:32Z,"My forum was hacked via SQL injection into database because hackers codes were located inside your database tables.
Host support told ""You must now check your forum software for possible vulnerabilities.""

I think this torrent contains malicious code. You will get hacked within a month of you use this."
,venice12,2011-07-12T21:50Z,Work Bro
,STiChad,2011-09-20T12:47Z,"After I run the keygen I copied the Customer Number and clicked ""Enter Install System"" but all it does is refresh the page.

The keygen came back with all positives don't see what went wrong other than the fact that I don't know how to do the ""CHMOD"" part. Website in description doesn't work either.

Assistance is needed! "
