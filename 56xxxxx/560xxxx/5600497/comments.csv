Pamela is the only exception, she looks really pretty but her pussy is ugly too."
,dougaldog2002,2010-05-31T14:56Z,"I think what the above two commenters meant to say was:

""Thank you soooo much for this UL. Unfortuantely it's not to our taste so we've deleted these pictures from our hard drive. Seriously, we really appreciate your efforts at providing the world with high-quality porn and we bow our heads in shame as we have failed to reciprocate in our own efforts and haven't uploaded anything what-so-ever to share. Humbly yours, Frick & Frack."""
,Asagrim,2010-05-31T15:56Z,"Seriously dougaldog2002, fuck you!

""and haven't uploaded anything what-so-ever""

My seeding ratio of 23,9 GB over the past _4_days_ says otherwise! Oh, you mean i didn't make any torrents? .. well ..

""Unfortuantely it's not to our taste so we've deleted these pictures from our hard drive.""

Wrong again! I _always_ seed my downloaded torrents for at least a week, but there are several which i have been seeding for over a year!

I am not your usual bitching troll, but if a torrent promises you _latinas_, and all you get are _indian_ descendants of a particular ethnicity called gippos, and not even the good sorts of them, it pisses me off! I live in a hungarian village where 15% of the inhabitants are gypsies, and i can tell, the majority of them in the according age look better!

Am i the racist, or is the dear ""uploader"" because it's all the same for him, chocolate skin -> latina ... huh? Give it some thought!

AAAND holohoax is right, i have downloaded a torrent with the _same_ contents months ago, so this is nothing more than a failed, reuploaded advertisement of a _paysite_! Should i be grateful for that? Really?!"
,dougaldog2002,2010-05-31T16:17Z,"Angry much?

End of."
,Serianas,2010-06-01T08:25Z,"Asagrim, I find your remarks highly pointed, intelligent and truthful, as well as entertaining, but sadly holohoax is right, in the words of a comedian who's name I don't care to remember: ""You can't fix stupid."" 

You can fix uneducated, but you can't fix stupid."
