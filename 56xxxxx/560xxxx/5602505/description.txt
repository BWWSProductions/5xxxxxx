In this wild, romantic comedy with a decidedly offbeat sense of humor,
Jack Nicholson stars as Harry, a wisecracking con-man who owns a guard dog
agency. When Joan (Ellen Barkin), an opera singer, seeks his aid after her
house is broken into, Harry inadvertently makes them the target of hit men
- and puts them at the mercy of Harry's out-of-control canines. Harry Dean
Stanton as a less-than-honorable businessman and Beverly D'Angelo as Joan's
eccentric sister also star.
