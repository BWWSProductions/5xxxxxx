,Vegasbob,2010-06-18T13:54Z,"Congratulations moron....i've used several mods from the modding community and your little install file managed to break the whole thing. You might want to read a bit more about where mods go now and what's needed. Namely you do NOT need the .dll file at all anymore, and you don't want to put any mods anywhere except in the new C:\Documents and Settings\\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Mods area as this is where all versions of the game look first now for mods. After installing your moronic program all of my custom clothing textures and .packages now no longer work in game, and now i'm going to have to spend time figureing out what your little useless executeable did to my game so I can undo it.

,wesm,2010-06-21T20:25Z,"Hey VegasBob, have you figured it out yet? My game is having some serious graphical errors and I fear it may be because of this."
,MartanElite,2010-06-28T22:07Z,"ttss: Yes

rhmum: Try to start the self extractor?

Vegasbob: I read a tutorial on the Sims 3 Wiki that told me to do like this. Not my problem if your custom skins don't work. This works for me at 100% and for all Demonoid users that downloaded this. Your the only one that complains

wesm: I don't think it's becuase of this. Extract the package at your desktop so that you can check the files. There's nothing there that should cause graphical errors"
,keongzai94,2010-07-11T15:51Z,"Dude, nnCan you explain step-by-step installation guide for me please ?...nnI\'m confused and i dont even know what to do after i downloaded your torrent..."
,MartanElite,2010-07-13T09:39Z,keongzai94: Start the self-extractor and extract it where it tells you to.
