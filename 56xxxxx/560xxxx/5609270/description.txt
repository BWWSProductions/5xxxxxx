Nine Inch Nails live via web

A compilation of the live webcast clips from the With Teeth tour in North America 2006.
I included not all broadcasted material, I sorted it according my taste and what I looked the best.
That compilation was really tricky, because the source material wasn't the best.... 

Clips from:
Austin / Wichita / Cabazon / Las Vegas / Albuquerque / San Antonio / Burmingham / Charlotte / Wantagh / Detroit / Pittsburgh / Indianapolis

also included:
KROQ Breakfast Los Angeles
and 
Mountain View Shoreline Amphitheater (9 songs)

You can read also information about this DVD in a dedicated thread in the NIN forum over at ETS.
