Strike Force 1.60 - 1.82 Mod for Unreal Tournament


*Edit: Here we go, torrent reuploaded. Third time's the charm I guess. For the record, contents were scanned for threats at archival time and at occasional periods, and were run through updated Sandboxie/AVG/MalwareBytes/ClamWin/Windows Malicious etc. yesterday; no concrete threats found or were ever in this. Thanks. Most files originate from the old strikeforcecenter.com, save a few home-made patches and maps. MD5 checksums included. Note that this being a collection of old patchers (some home-made), some *could* get detected as false positives (Avira is very annoying for this, will probably pick up the home-made ones or the RAR SFX).

*Edit2: Add these trackers to the torrent after download (sorry, I fucked up :< ):

These are installer and map files from the old Strike Force mod for Unreal Tournament 1 by Xtreme Gaming. SF was a free Counter-Strike-like mod for UT, but with way more fun controls/aiming/guns and tons of suspense. Had a number of glitches and is obviously outdated now, but still good for an old-time's-sake LAN or clan match.

You need to have Unreal Tournament 1 with patch 4.36 applied to install these. I don't know if SF will run with newer patches/versions. You probably shouldn't try to install more than one of these versions at a time, i.e., stick to the 1.6x or the 1.8x release lines separately, or apply each to different UT installations. There's a lot more stuff included for 1.80 in this pack so you should probably go with that, but if you didn't like all the changes after 1.60 then that one can be worth an setup too.


The installers for the following versions/updates are included:

- Strike Force 1.60
- Strike Force 1.60a
- Strike Force 1.70
- Strike Force 1.80
- Strike Force 1.81
- Strike Force 1.82a (server-only)
- Strike Force 1.8x Bot Patcher/Fix Info
- Unreal Tournament 4.36 Patch (provided for convenience)


The following map packs are included:

1.60:
- Classic Maps

1.80:
- OZM Mappers pack
- Retro/SAS/Jukka/182/Indepenza (all combined into one - 'MapPack-Retro-SAS-Jukka-182-Indepenza.exe' - simply extract into base UT folder)
- A few individual maps


These are all the installers and files that I still have. I have neither anything before 1.60 nor version 1.75 and I lost a lot of maps, sorry. Otherwise, just remember: nades over the wall, every time.
