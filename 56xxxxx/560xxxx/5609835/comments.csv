All tested serials and cracks for the previous Security Task Manager v1.7x don't 
unlock all features of Security Task Manager. This patch for Security Task Manager 
v1.7h unlocks all features, meaning:

1- Spy Protector can be enabled.
2- Security Task Manager shows all running processes, services, drivers, etc.
3- The Help > Info of STM shows: Registered full version (no buy-option anymore!).

If not, then the installed Security Task Manager version isn't fully unlocked!!!"

Security Task Manager v1.7h incl. Spy Protector + Crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5611399"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-06-07T05:38Z,"Actually the crack is the patched original  TaskMan.exe at C:Program FilesSecurity Task Manager, which is detected by:

Avira AntiVir Premium: identifies crack TaskMan.exe as a possible threat:
- Risk name: TR/Crypt.ASPM.Gen  	
- Risk type: Trojan


... So for those who are afraid of false positives it's not a real choice. Either way, suit yourself. :)"

[V],hiest,2010-06-07T06:49Z,"Hi MR: RobbingHood , 

I need your help....
I never used any security application for p2p downloading ever, but even though i have never been caught , My cousin got a letter yesterday for downloading a torrent from some new torrent website...

He asked me for any security application through which he can upload and download the torrents anonymously or by hiding his identity...

I researched in Google but then i thought that i should ask you , I got confused after searching in google , I am not sure which application really hides our identity..., 

You are the only person who can suggest the best software for my cousin...., So please give me the software name through which me and my cousin can download and upload torrents safely....
I also doubt that you have already uploaded such a software in your upload section in TPB.....

Where can i find , and what is the name of the application?

Thanks for your help MR: RobbingHood."

There's no 100% privacy on internet, but a good option is a using VPN service. On google and the forum you'll find much more info and get more suggestions then I can provide by myself.
