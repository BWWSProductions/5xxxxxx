IMPORTANT NOTES- AV Scan results of STM.1.7h_Patch.exe (size: 221 kB):
**********************************************************************

1- Norton Internet Security identifies STM.1.7h_Patch.exe as a possible threat:
   - Risk name: Backdoor.Graybird  	
   - Risk type: Virus  

2- avast! Pro Antivirus: Clean.

3- Avira AntiVir Premium: Clean.* 

*Note that the patched TaskMan.exe at C:/Program Files/Security Task Manager/
 is detected by:

Avira AntiVir Premium: identifies patched TaskMan.exe as a possible threat:
- Risk name: TR/Crypt.ASPM.Gen  	
- Risk type: Trojan 

4- Kaspersky Antivirus: Clean.


The av scan results are from June 06, 2010. 

The av scan result of Norton is false positive due to some used binaries 
and cryptors (or maybe STM.1.7h_Patch.exe is added to their virus database).

Also scanned with most well known antispyware and tested with Sandboxie. Reported 
malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!

So just stay cool ... or don't use this!!!



<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
> Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this! <

              Security Task Manager v1.7h incl. Spy Protector + Patch
 


Release date: June 04, 2009 (actual version at June 06, 2010)


NOTE:
*****

All tested serials and cracks for the previous Security Task Manager v1.7x don't 
unlock all features of Security Task Manager. This patch for Security Task Manager 
v1.7h unlocks all features, meaning:

1- Spy Protector can be enabled.
2- Security Task Manager shows all running processes, services, drivers, etc.
3- The Help > Info of STM shows: Registered full version (no buy-option anymore!).

If not, then the installed Security Task Manager version isn't fully unlocked!!!



Description Security Task Manager:
**********************************

Security Task Manager shows comprehensible information about programs & processes 
running on the computer (applications, DLLs, BHOs, and services).  

Security Task Manager detects unknown malware and rootkits hidden from your
antivirus software. The security risk rating indicates the likelihood of the 
process being potential spyware, malware, a Trojan, or keylogger.

Security Task Manager also deletes traces of your Internet and computer activity, 
prevents keyboard input monitoring, and warns you when the registry is changed. 
This process viewer also recognizes stealth processes and virtual driver software 
hidden from the Windows Task Manager.

Security Task Manager tells you exactly what programs are running on your computer 
- and it gives you answers to the obvious ensuing questions, such as where these 
programs reside, who makes them, what they are called, whether they include hidden 
components, and what all this means to your computer.

Security Task Manager shows all active processes on your computer. You can easily 
recognize the endangering potential of each process. No other Task Manager or 
Process Viewer has this feature. Furthermore you can put a process into quarantine 
or search the internet for information about that process.

Security Task Manager improves on Windows Task Manager for each process, it's 
providing a security risk rating, a process description, file path, CPU usage 
graph, start time, embedded hidden functions (for example keyboard monitoring, 
autostart entry, and browser supervision or manipulation), and process type, 
such as visible window, systray program, DLL, and IE plug-in. 



Some features of Security Task Manager:
***************************************

- Unique security risk rating - The security risk rating indicates the likelihood 
  of a process being potential spyware, malware or a Trojan. The rating is purely 
  based on behaviour and code analysis, and does not use any signature files. 
- Comments from our experts and user community.
- Free online scan with all known Antivirus engines.
- Full directory path and file name. 
- Process description. 
- CPU usage graph. 
- Embedded hidden functions (e.g. keyboard monitoring, browser supervision or 
  manipulation). 
- Process type (e.g. visible window, systray program, DLL, IE-plugin, startup 
  service). 
 


SpyProtector
************

Security Task Manager also contains SpyProtector for protecting your computer and 
Internet privacy. SpyProtector deletes history, disables keyboard monitoring and 
warns you when registry is changed. You can easily monitor your autostart/startup 
registry entries.

- Prevents keyboard and mouse monitoring 
  (That stops keylogger or other hacker tools)

- Warns when registry is changed 
  (That protects you from Trojans that surreptitiously add an autostart key)

- Eliminates the traces of your internet activity 
  (e.g. cookies, cache, history, typed URLs and temporary files)

- Eliminates the traces of your work on computer 
  (e.g. recent used file list of programs; Word, ACDSee, PDF, WinZip, Media player)



What's new in Security Task Manager v1.7h:
******************************************

- Version 1.7h detects network worms like the conficker worm. 



System requirements:
********************

- Windows Vista, XP, 2000, 2003, 2008
  On Windows Vista, program's help file needs Microsoft WinHlp32 
- 2 MB free disk space

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
