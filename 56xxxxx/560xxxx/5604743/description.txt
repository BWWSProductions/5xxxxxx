- First Three Studio Albums -

As i mentioned 'bout Toby Driver's second project "Kayo Dot", the diversity of musical styles arouses unpredictable trips that aren't easy to digest. In contrast to the more avantgarde and spaced out experiments of K.D., M.o.t.W.'s albums have a more conventional and familiar approach to rock music. This sounds entirely superficial and should only be seen as a sketchy comparison between these two very eclectic and baffling projects. 

In 2003 M.o.t.W. disbanded, but partly rejoined for a last time in 2009 to record the free of charge available album "Part the Second".
