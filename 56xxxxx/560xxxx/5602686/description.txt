[color=purple]Notes::::::::::::::::::[/color]
well....their is alot of versions out their now, so some may see this pointless but ours was encoding last night, took
quite a while, source was very orange, infact theirs a couple releases even more orange than source out their, anyway
resized resolution to something what was good, then added sauration filter lowering it down quite alot, then changed
the red down quite much, changed the other colors also tried to lowering the colors as they was pretty damn heavy,
increased brightness a touch, and lowered contrast...overall it's far from perfect, but im sure someone will be happy
with it, used imagine's audio thnx.
