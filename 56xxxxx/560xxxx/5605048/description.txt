everything a lost fan/newcomer needs to enjoy the greatest show ever broadcast!

includes 6hours of the most important episodes for understanding the secrets of the island... and will hopefully encourage viewers to explore more episodes of series!!

The pilot and finale were regular episodes, the special recaps info from all episodes between pilot&finale, and the jimmy kimmel 'aloha to lost" show aired live after the finale with interviews with the creators&cast plus comedic alternate endings to the series.

Please checkout my other uploaded torrents, all my collections are under 3GB to provide the most hours of content that can be contained on most usb-flash drives and shared with your friends... I will be adding torrents that are complilation of other uploads providing season/series abridged editions of shoz,flix, vidgames and ebooks/comics I feel shouldbe shared with the world for the enjoyment of all. I'm an indian medstudent who grewup in america exposed to the wonder of western entertainment... file sharing is the only way most of the world gets to view the best media content available without waiting months for traditional local release.

ps- this is my first uploaded torrent, so any positive/negative feedback comments are appreciated
