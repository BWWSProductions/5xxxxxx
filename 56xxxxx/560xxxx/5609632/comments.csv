,jimoffar,2010-06-07T18:53Z,Malwarebytes says KEYGEN is infected.  AVAST says it is OK.   I went ahead and installed.  Works great!  No apparent problems.  Thanks for making it available.
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-06-08T01:52Z,AVASTt and AVG is only good for removing {vundu and spareware} apart from that. just  a lemon. FORGET both and deepfreeze your pc.
