Before stating that something is fake you should actually find out if it is first."
[T],brodahisou,2010-06-05T07:10Z,It's a legit download.  A good copy of The Best of Elmo 2.  Don't be fooled by melanieandlarryzz's comment.
,XmiserybuisnessX,2011-12-15T00:48Z,considering everything i have downloaded from you i dont have any worries downloading this. some people just want to make it look like its a bad download so no one downloads your stuff. Nothing wrong with this torrent at all!
