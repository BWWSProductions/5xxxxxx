A debut album three years in the making, Uffie's first full-length Sex Dreams
and Denim Jeans is officially coming to North America on June 22nd via Ed Banger
Records/Because Music/Elektra. Since her infectious Ed Banger Records debut in
2006, the provocative 22 year old Paris-based electro-pop artist (aka Anna
Catherine Hartley) has attracted a legion of growing fans through just a few
singles ("Pop The Glock", "Hot Chick"), amemorable appearance on Justice's debut
album in 2007, and international performances including Pukkelpop, Coachella,
and Lollapalooza. Teaming up with her Ed Banger labelmates, longtime producers
and electronic visionaries in their own right, Mr. Oizo ,Feadz, and SebastiAn
produced a majority of the album material along with additional heavyweights
Mirwais (Madonna, Taxi Girl). Pharrell Williams also contributes a
return-to-form verse on the upcoming single "ADD SUV".
