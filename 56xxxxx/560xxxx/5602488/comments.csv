,philo_1979,2010-08-13T20:35Z,"Thanx for this season one, awesome quality, only problem was episode 19 not working?? Not sure if you're aware of it, or if it was something on my end. Was saying it was a full episode, but was just completely black. Otherwise, thanx again!!"

,egg311,2011-03-24T05:58Z,"I finally registered so I could ask these questions: How do I seed? Do I need to continue running BitTorrent for the seeds to remain active? Can I get sued for seeding? How long do people usually seed for? Does seeding slow down my computer or my downloading? 

Also, is it easy to upload torrents to Pirate Bay?

Thanks THEADreaNal for the download, and thanks to anyone who can help answer my Q's"
,Benishdamenish,2011-04-28T09:16Z,To seed simply leave the downloaded or downloading file in the original saved folder. For example: if you use limwire(:\) leave file in limewire: saved..
,tatti_singh,2011-05-23T17:27Z,seed please

,xTxHxOxRxNx,2011-07-13T05:20Z,"To everything: seed, seed, seed!"
,necn,2011-07-18T03:01Z,and if you do use limewire you also need to shut down your computer and walk to the nearest highway and sit down in the middle of it.
,truthy,2011-07-19T01:19Z,"the resolution of most episodes throughout all seasons is quite low 400xX, most episodes are about 180MB - only a few have a higher resolution. video bitrate 400-600 kbit ... 

nevertheless, for that size the quality is very decent. 350MB per episode would have been good quality. thx for sharing!"
,cctb,2011-09-25T03:17Z,"Thanks THEADreaNaL. dloading it. Seed it, people.... Seed it!"

Quality?

Watermarks?"
,rauwdauw,2011-12-16T09:35Z,"Thanks for the upload!!
It's a tvrip but quality is fine enough.
But there is one thing that irritates me.. Is S03E18
in slow motion or something??"
,rauwdauw,2011-12-16T09:39Z,O my god just found out why it was in slow motion that was definitely my own fault haha!
,Andozer75,2012-01-04T21:58Z,"Niiice!
Small size and good collection of it all :-D Thank you for sharing, though I can't say much about the quality yet. I'm sure it's good, considering all the positive comments :-D"
,stupid_monje,2012-02-14T07:44Z,"hi, anybody can help point out to me where i can get the subtitle for this? i been searching for hours and only got HDTV and dvdrip version and they're out of sync. thanks"
,Donjamos,2012-02-16T18:10Z,dude whats with the missing releasegroup extensions? for sure it wasnt you who ripped it and it seems to be impossible to find the subtitles for the  episodes in this torrent because they all are asynchron. how hard can it be to leave the extensions in the file names or at least add a .txt to the torrent explaining which file was released by what group dumbass. gone erase the torrent and download a better one...
,ParasiteX,2012-03-07T13:34Z,The quality of the episodes are complete and utter shit.. not worth the fucking download..
,Holliganpt,2012-04-05T01:33Z,Seed plzzz!

,stagetechie,2012-05-17T14:28Z,Quality is not very good at all if watched in full screen. Gets very blocky. Good for watching on a phone maybe?
,eiliminti,2012-06-15T12:42Z,"A: 6 - V: 4

Audio and Video not particularly great at all, but I have not found another torrent out there that is being seeded at reasonable speed.

Download received at average of 75kb/s"
