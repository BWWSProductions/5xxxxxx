PLOT
"Tears of Kali" is actually three films; three short stories centered around people involved with a cult that practiced Indian mysticism.

All three stories focus on ex-cult members, after the cult is disbanded when its leader is murdered (torn to pieces by something/someone). This movie does have a low budget but it really earns its "R" rating: there's plenty of nudity, blood and gore.

I liked the exotic appeal of the themes and the fact that it is based on the "The Taylor-Eriksson Group," an extreme cult that supposedly existed in Poona, India about twenty years ago. 

Run Time: 106 minutes
Language: English
