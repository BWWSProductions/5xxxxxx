Bitter Ruin - Recorded Live from Ivory Blacks, Glasgow on 02/06/2010Bitter Ruin are an Accoustic Duo who have reciently became a lot more popular by touring with Amanda Palmer when her support couldn't make it to the UK shows due to the Ash Cloud incident.

Bitter Ruin are Ben Richards (guitar and vocals) and Georgia Train (Vocal) from Brighton, UK. They are amazing and perform in a way thats hard to catogrise, If you like this band please purchase their album (off their site rather than iTunes to ensure they actually see some of the money) or come along to a live show, they are touring at the moment, and they are with Amanda Palmer in a few months in the USA and towards the end of the year/the new year they are doing a world tour depending on where they get requested to play (via their Myspace page -)


Recorded live from the front row via my Archos 605 - set to Wav-PCM they imported into Sony Vegas 9.0c - Tweeked the sound a little and exported as Flac.

I've included a few pictures, but to see the rest look on the bands Facebook page as they has been posted on there - links at the bottom.

* - Talking tracks (intros, banter, explinations) - seperated so they can be easily removed if you dont want them on a audio device - ie your ipod. Saves editing them :D

Album can be converted into whatever you want and please spread the word about Bitter Ruin as they are an amazing band and they are only just breaking out of the London/Brighton area and need all the support they can get.
