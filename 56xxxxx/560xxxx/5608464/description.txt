Lenin of the Rovers was a BBC Radio 4 comedy series from 1988 starring Alexei Sayle as Ricky Lenin, a player for Felchester Rovers - Britain's only communist football team. 


Other players in the team included Stevie Stalin and Terry Trotsky. 

The team was managed by Des Frankly and Colonel Brace-Cartwright who were frequently interviewed by Frank Lee Brian (real-life football commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme). 


Actors John Sessions and Jim Broadbent made character appearances in Series 2. The title is a parody of the long-running football-themed comic strip, Roy of the Rovers.

The show loosely parodied the increasing commercialisation of British football and the then-notorious violent loyalty of the fans. 

The script also made frequent use of Ricky Lenin's attempts to fit in with what he saw as a 'western' lifestyle, in a similar way to some of Sayle's appearances as the Balowski Family in The Young Ones.
