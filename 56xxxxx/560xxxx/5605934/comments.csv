It is out of print or something. If someone can upload a dvd9 that would be great!

If you're still looking for Barfly, there's a seeded dvd-r, as well as a nice HQ XviD with dual audio and extras on CG. 

Looking at your uploads, it might be your  kind of site, so I'd be happy to sort you out with an invite if you'd like."
