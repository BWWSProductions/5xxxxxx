320kbps recording of the second part of the Led Zeppelin concert in Berlin on July 7th, 1980.
(I have Part 1 in another torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5601820)
I did not source this; however, I did reorganize/relabel/reseed.

Artist: "Led Zeppelin"
Album: "1980.07.07 - Berlin - The Last Show [Disc 2]"
Date: "1980"
Genre: "Rock"

(That date system ensures that it will sort chronologically with other live recordings that are labeled in a similar manner.)

Sound quality is very good although not perfect (not sure if soundboard or good microphone job).
Also important as a Led Zeppelin artifact:
This is a show is from their last tour, which had a different setlist, including one song from Presence and three from In Through the Out Door. (North America 1977 and Knebworth 1979 also had some songs from those last two albums.)
As the last show of the last tour, it was thus the last Led Zeppelin concert before John Bonham's death.
