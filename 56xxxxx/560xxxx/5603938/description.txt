1892. Wyoming. A loose depiction of the 'Johnson County War'.

Farm settlements along a river have cut off a wealthy rancher's
livestock from the water. The rancher presses the farmers to
leave. He looks to be succeeding ... 

... and then Shane rides into the valley. 

This play was made for the 'Cinema 100 Season', but is based on
the novel 'Shane' [rather than the film]. The Shane depicted here
is a samurai character type. Calm. Terrible. Vicious. 

Don't be put off by the cowboy theme. This is a model piece of
story telling. Spare and touching. It bears repeated listening.
My tape wore out long before digitisation became available. I
was really happy to get this copy. So thanks again!
