While I'm waiting for my new needle to come in the mail,
I've decided to make a torrent that shows the differences
between sample rates, and the effectivness of Sony Noise 
Reduction (i've been using this all along, although i just
started listing it in the desctiption)

The record i chose is an old dirty 45 of House of the Rising
Sun, by The Animals. Theres no scratches on the record, but 
it's a "fake" mono to stereo cut from Japan (the Beatles were
notorious for this too), so in no way am I trying to pass this 
off as great sounding, and personnaly I don't like the way 
45's sound, but still this song is amazing.

The first three versions will be free of any tampering past
the recording process, simply record and save.

1. House of the Rising Sun (320 kbps Mp3) (Dirty)
2. House of the Rising Sun (48/16 FLAC) (Dirty)
3. House of the Rising Sun (96/24 FLAC) (Dirty)

And the Last three will be cleaned and polished with Sony
Noise Reduction 2.0h (I do most of the cleaning manually,
but there are a bunch of templates to choose)

1. House of the Rising Sun (320 kbps Mp3)
2. House of the Rising Sun (48/16 FLAC)
3. House of the Rising Sun (96/24 FLAC)
