,yazinbhai,2010-06-04T18:26Z,hey buddy...........is burn notice comin soon?
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-04T19:50Z,"@sdcheeran: Your torrent-program is currently best choice. Absolutely same as uTorrent, BitTorrent is just named differently for legal reasons.

@yazinbhai: Do not get me wrong, but don't address me ""buddy"" and  ""dude"" . I address people here either by their screen-names, or ""friend "" or ""brother"". This shows respect and basic sense of appreciation to anyone. Consider that as an advice - so, take it or leave it

BTW, ""Burn Notice"" comes at 20:00 GMT."
