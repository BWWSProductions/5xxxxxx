(V) resolution is 720x480, 29.97fps 
(A) 448kbps, 44.1kHz

I don't see how the size of the file can be more than 60MB?

[V],2nafish,2010-06-04T08:21Z,About a year ago I did switch to xvid files which were smaller files and got a lot of complaints because everyone liked the 720x480 files better even though they were a larger file size.
