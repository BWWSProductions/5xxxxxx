is a fact.

Death Scenes is a slide show of gore and grim, presenting a series of old (40-50s) 
crime scene photographs, and revealing the darkside of a human mind. Death Scenes 
doesn't seek any glamour, confort or sensationalism. It presents death as it is 
(not how it should be); and it surely isn't a flattering thing. Anton LaVey 
(who worked as a crime scene photographer) does a good job as a narrator, 
explaining each "scenes" with a dead calm voice. I cannot recommend Death 
Scenes for everyone - especially for those who're weak minded (or heart).

As stated above, these rips are sourced from the Anthem Pictures R1 DVD releases 
(though the DVDs are obviously themselves sourced from VHS, you can see a noise 
bar at the bottom throughout the videos). From what I've heard, however, these 
DVD releases are inexplicably significantly different from the original Wavelength 
Video VHS releases of this series. Scenes have apparently been taken out, rearranged, 
and otherwise modified.
