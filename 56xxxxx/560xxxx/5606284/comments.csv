,pnarrr,2012-01-13T15:18Z,"Win 7 64 bit, discs unRARed & mounted: running setup.exe, I get a 'working' mouse pointer for a few seconds, then nothing. No new windows, menus or error messages appear. Looking in task manager, a 32-bit setup.exe remains in the process list until I kill it. I'veleft it alone for a while and it never does anything. This is the same for both games, and actually I've seen the same error on an old game of mine 'Project Eden' too (legit disc). Any ideas?"
