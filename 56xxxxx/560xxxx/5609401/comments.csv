,Anjalena,2011-02-20T20:53Z,"Great quality. 10/10. Thanks for uploading! 

It's amazing to watch this while going through my history of animation class. This movie was sooooo far beyond what anyone had done before. Check out ""Gertie the Dinosaur"" and ""How a Mosquito Operates"" and even ""Steamboat Willie"" (early Mickey Mouse) on YouTube to see what I mean.

Again, thank you for the upload. Great job!"

[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-02T12:17Z,I think it's titan version though
