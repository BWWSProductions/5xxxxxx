It's assholes like Vandana that stopped Norman Borlaug from feeding the world. She is no hero."

""GMO foods kill people. They make them sterile and kill the organs.""
No they don't, that's not to say GMO isn't without its disadvantages (consider the Monsanto selling seeds leading to sterile plants- so you have to keep buying their seeds), exaggeration or false claims do not help- when it is discovered you spread misinformation, you lose credibility.

""Don't Be Fooled Any Longer on Darwinism, Evolution, Global Warming Lies, Internationalism""
I'm also a Newtonionist, as I accept many of his theories, I'm also a Einsteinist (if you could say that)...So what about evolution, the unifying theory in biology accepted by a vast majority of biological scientists? Yeah what about global warming, you think that someone abusing a problem to make money (Al Gore) means that global warming is fake? If someone does a bomb hoax, does that mean there aren't real bombs out there despite a sick individual exploiting peoples panic? Internationalism- to some degree cooperation is needed. Why? Because we have only one planet, what one country does could potentially effect others, take mercury poisoning, it can cause serious problems not just in your country, but globally if it gets out."
