[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-06-26T09:53Z,"Well I wouldn't know about that one???

All I do know (but I'm probably not right) is that it's supposed to be variations on a harmonic scale of progressions.

Your comment is a bit too Baroque for me to fathom; and your tastes in music appears to be Baroque also.

You're not some sort of maniacal genius on a violin are you?   If so, please upload all of the albums you've recorded.

Thank you for your comment.   Cheers, Bro."
