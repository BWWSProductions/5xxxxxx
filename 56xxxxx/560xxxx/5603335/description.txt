74	NOTES:
75	 
76	IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....MacGruber
77	 
78	Well first off thanks to the sources which were macgruber 2010 cam xvid - movie-hogs for the audio (main part) also
79	thanks to a special friend for the ending audio which was missing on the cam source (2mins roughly).
80	And finally many thanks to ELEKTRI4KA for sending us the source file for the video ;-)
81	 
82	Right the video first,well this was nice but had some major issues going on with the colouring .....way way too much yellow.
83	So we needed to run a white balance and RGB eq filter over it to try and correct the colours.
84	Also on the source files the black borders change sizes so we needed to crop and different values and then resize the different parts
85	so they all matched up.
86	We also done our normal stuff of changing the brightness,contrast,gamma,chroma,sharpness etc.....
87	The audio we needed to strip the cam audio off the first cam release and match the begining up and the ending up ...however the ending was missing
88	2mins on the audio side of things ,so we used a different source for that.....
89	Once done it was a case of stretching and filtering the audio to match the runtime of the russian video and sync it up ....
90	 
91	Pretty sure someone will come out with a TS but until then this is more than watchable .....enjoy
