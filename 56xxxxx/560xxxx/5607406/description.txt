         It's the 12th time these storied franchises have met in the   
         NBA finals and together they have claimed the last two NBA    
         championships; the teams split two games during the regular   
          season, with each winning on the road by a single point.

         Stupid affiliate left a small weather graphic up over the     
         first segment. It is not animated and is not present for      
         the vast majority of the game so we didn't feel it was        
          reason enough to not release.
