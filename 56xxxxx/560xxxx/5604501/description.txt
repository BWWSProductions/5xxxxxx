 Release Notes
 -------------
 ViDEO Source: ELIKTRI4KA [Thanks!]
 AUDiO Source: Our OWN LiNE

 Video: Removed some of the red and orange. Sharpened,denoise,brightness,etc.
 Part of the left side is cut off and some of the bottom,but quality wise the
 video is pretty good.

 Audio: Our nice new direct LiNE. Has some great bass but was recorded a little
 low on volume, so ran it through an EQ. Next time it'll be recorded at a more
 proper volume and shouldn't need any filtering! We think anything we put out
 with this new LiNE will be the release to get and we hope everybody enjoys it.
 Many thanks to our new syncer ROLO for doing a fine job on this release! =]
 
 Well we decided that since this source was cropped we would just go ahead and 
 release both sources as some people will perfer entire screen over higher res.
 We have alot more nice line that just needs put to Video,so expect some more
 TS's in the very near future. Enjoy!=]
