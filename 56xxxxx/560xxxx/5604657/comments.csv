,misfisk,2010-12-09T17:57Z,"The tagging issues are very easy to solve: Stop using iTunes and just keep track of your files. It's very easy, and you are always in control that way.

Great audio players:
Windows - foobar2000
Linux - DeaDBeeF
Mac - Cog

Great tagging software:
Windows - foobar2000
Linux - Kid3 & Ex Falso
Mac - Kid3

Don't let companies think for you."
