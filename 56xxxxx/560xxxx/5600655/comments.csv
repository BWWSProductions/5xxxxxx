,Yestreen,2010-12-18T18:38Z,"Alright, I finished my download last night and yes, it took hours but IT WAS WORTH IT!  The quality is great and I could not stop listening to these albums! I listened to the albums ""The Fall"" and ended at Minus Exitus without stopping to do something else :D  Then again, you probably know this band is awesome if your downloading all of the albums :p "
