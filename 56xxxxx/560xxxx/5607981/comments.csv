,totsuko,2010-06-05T08:51Z,it is legit but doesn't boot on gen D3 seen somewhere you have to downgrase to gen D2... i'll wait for a fix
,noxusrules,2010-06-05T16:13Z,so this is the complete game in English? I have the Jap version! Please tell me so I can download it
,babak159,2010-06-05T18:24Z,does it work on cfw?
,manuel88,2010-06-05T20:18Z,"his is read but if you have the 550 CFW GEN D3 it will stop after the second cut scene.  you have to downgrade to 550 GEN D2. or go to Dark Alex CFW 5.00 M33-6 

dont use the speed memory card thingy and let it download everything when your playing the game and it should work.  

if not go to  wesbite demonoid.

and download peace walker the Euro one.  to me it works way better"
,kutterk,2010-06-05T20:54Z,anybody know if this works with some emulator on windows ?
,ghaonhao,2010-06-06T04:01Z,so thank
,sweetchilliphil,2010-06-06T15:07Z,"@totsuko

NO. You can find a time machine fix on the net. Do a quick little google search and you will eventually stumble on it. Its a small 1mb install that temporarily puts your PSP in D2 mode for MGS. I've played up to the 3rd boss on my D3 PSP.

@noxusrules

Can you even read English in the first place? Pretty sure it says USA in large letters in the title... Or its the region code for Timbuktu...

@babak159

Heh, does it work on CFW? Nope. Works only on legitimate Sony firmware. Who needs custom firmware nowadays? Its all legit stuff folks!

@kutterk

There is one in development, but its still VERY buggy and slow. Plus, it only works for a small number of games. Don't hold your breath. PSP is still the best way to play it... ""Go get your own!""

Any more seriously lazy questions?"
,sweetchilliphil,2010-06-06T15:10Z,"@babak159

I'm scared you'll actually take me seriously (I mean, that is a seriously stupid question to ask up there...) and although my answer was heavily cynical and sarcastic, I do want to help... So...

In the words of Obama ""YES YOU CAN!""

Use that squishy thing in your skull ya wet teabag."

,xmesca,2010-06-10T07:20Z,"I am using GEN-D3. I patched this with prometheus_v03final. I am using KHBBS plugin enabled. I can get the game to load and pla no problem but it always has the automatic save icon, the memory light flashes, but it doesn' save anything. Whenever I return to my save file it has 00:00:00 play time and it starts from the beginning.

For the life of me I can't get this game to save properly.

Currently working on downgrading to GEN-D2 to see if it makes a difference. Any help would be appriciated."

@ StarBen

How did u get it to work with the isotool? Please help. Thanx in advance"
,plor_en,2010-06-12T17:42Z,"I got the damn thing to work using ISOTOOL 1.52!

My current FW is 5.00 m33-6 in a FAT-100?.

1. I just downloaded ISOTOOL 1.52 and the latest PROMETHEUS v0.3 from psp-hacks.com.

2. Then I overwritten the PROMETHEUS folder in ISOTOOL with the contents of the latest PROMETHEUS.

3. I then copied the whole ISOTOOL folder into the PSP's memory stick (under PSP/GAME folder)

4. Then I copied the iso file psy-mgspw.iso (from this torrent) to the ISO folder.

5. I just ran ISOTOOL in the PSP, DECRYPTED the .iso file (saying YES to the 3 questions), then PATCHED the .iso file using the PROMETHEUS option in ISOTOOL.

6. After that I was playing for an hour straight with no problems.

It's my first time to patch an .iso file and it was such a no brainer. I never thought I could do it.

Mabuhay ang mga Pinoy! Yeah!"

,k-line,2010-09-06T02:44Z,"if it works after using isotool to apply the latest prometheus, does it mean that it can work directly using the latest prometheus firmware? (i.e., the so called gen-d4?)"
,smknjoker,2010-10-04T01:55Z,"Confirmed working on my M33-6 with the M33-6 version of Prometheus 2 update. No patching required. 

Make sure to have Speed Up MC Acess set to never in the recovery menu when installing game data. Afterwards you can turn it back on.

,jedarico,2010-11-29T08:32Z,"for all of you who cant seem to figure out what the hell they need to do, first step is to download and install this into  your psp http://dl.qj.net/psp/homebrew-applications/cfw-550-prometheus.html , second step is to check if it iunstalled properly.... third, enjoy and try to re-extract the game to your psp if you patched it"
