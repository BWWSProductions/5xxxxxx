,BinkyDeath,2010-05-31T21:10Z,"Postal postal or justl postal?  What does that mean?  Was that even a sentence??

If you don't know what it means it's a play on words for the title of the original book.  It's about what happens when the postal service in Ankh Morpork is reopened with a con-man heading it on the Discworld.  Not hard to understand... unlike your question.  o.0"

and its not postal postal, it really is just postal.
BORING"
,Dinsdale Piranha,2010-06-02T02:38Z,Thanks EZTV!
,BinkyDeath,2010-06-02T21:10Z,"I'm glad someone does.  lol  :)  I don't think it's boring though - some mad postal worker blowing the heads off his co-workers would be hideously boring to me.
Shame they made so many changes to the original book again though.  :(  I'll agree they left a lot of the interesting bits from the book out of this TV version though.
Other than that they've not done a bad job and they don't seem to have made as many glaring changes as with the previous televised versions... and the download's really good quality.  
Top job from whoever did the recording.  Thanks eztv, excellent job (and my download rate soared when it reached 18% so a slow download stopped being a problem).
Brilliant... now to get part 2."
,BinkyDeath,2010-06-02T23:16Z,Has part 2 been uploaded yet?  I can't tell if it's up or not as thepiratebay's search engine keeps overloading (so says the message I keep getting with every search). :-s
,BrianTheBlack,2010-06-16T18:50Z,The title is also a partial pun on Roald Dahl's 'Going Solo'.
