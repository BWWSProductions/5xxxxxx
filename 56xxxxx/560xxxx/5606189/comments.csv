,ninline,2010-06-04T03:33Z,Thanks.  I haven't seen this movie since the mid 70's.  It's pretty creepy.
[T],Jonzee,2010-08-25T07:52Z,"This movie is pretty good, they saturated the TV stations with advertising on this one so it was really talked about for a short time in the early 70s. It concerns a socially disfunctional & reclusive young man named willard who finds solace in his pet rats. Willard eventually finds himself with hundreds of these creepy pets, all of whom are mysteriously devoted to him."
