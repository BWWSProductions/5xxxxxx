Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



An attendant for a village priest becomes a soldier in the Cuban revolution in this offbeat adventure comedy. His healthy cynicism towards the police, wealthy landlords, and the government serves him well after he join ups with a female guerilla. He rises to become a lieutenant as he waits for the signal for the rebellion to begin.
