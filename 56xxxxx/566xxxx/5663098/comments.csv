,varilthes,2010-07-16T18:33Z,"What is the deal with the ever so slow Up\'s of this show. its almost over a week behind now. Take Top Chef for instance, which comes on RIGHT BEFORE THIS, is always up\'ed within a matter of hours after the show has aired. This show takes a week plus before the episodes are uploaded and im not understand why its any different then Top Chef which as stated airs RIGHT before THIS SHOW!nn I appreciate the effort you put forth but as these episodes are coinciding with the release of the episodes on BravoTv.com it seems as if someone is recording the stream and then editing out the Commercials. A strange coincidence or someone slacking off recording the Sream and editing out the commercials. nnNow i understand the amount of work that goes into a good Telesync or CamRip which can delay a New movie release from being up\'ed but TV needs no extra work. Aside from commercial Edits....easy! nnSo i ask you, What the Frack is taking so long?!"
