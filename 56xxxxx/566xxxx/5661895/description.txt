Raw footage from the CNN archives. Contents:


* Raw footage of the press conference at the California Institution for Women following the parole hearing of Leslie Van Houten in 2002. The highlight is a journalist shouting angrily at Stephen Kay after he ignores her question, after which he quickly stammers "No more questions?" and then runs off. Quite amusing.

* Raw footage shot outside of the San Bernardino County courthouse of Van Houten's appearance before Judge Bob Krug with reactions of two lawyers for the Board of Parole Hearings, Van Houten's father Paul ('There are only two people who haven't changed after all these years and that's Charles Manson and Stephen Kay') and Van Houten's attorney Christie Webb.

* Segments of several parole hearings over the years, among others Krenwinkel's 1985 hearing, Van Houten's 1987 hearing, Manson's 1989 hearing, Bruce Davis' 2000 hearing.
