,umd,2010-07-05T12:12Z,My PS3 mutes the audio because of some Cinavia code 
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-05T18:18Z,gotta love big brother.  try unhooking your ps3 from internet first.
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-05T21:07Z,not sure how to get around that protection other than do not allow your ps3 to receive an internet connection and thus updates.  seems like some new audio content recognition thing like utube does.  See if the Dolby Digital track is blocked as well.
,umd,2010-07-06T03:54Z,"works find on wd tv and pc just does play on ps3 or new blu-ray play  has a new watermark ,just liked to say picture is awsome quality is 10,its just the losers that has the code in it  thanks for the rip "
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-06T04:17Z,well i expect there will be more of them unless a way is found to detect the watermarking and interrupt it.  I expect that it will be discovered and be able to be tweaked eventually.
,krisdayanti,2010-07-06T12:17Z,can i watch this on iPad?

,dcoleman,2010-07-09T09:30Z,I confirm This happens without the PS3 connected to the Internet. I have not had any updates for the PS3 for a while so I know it has not been in a update. I think it has to do with the Dolby Dig. Cause I can watch this on the PC no prob and I know when im using the PC I dont have Dolby Dig. and on the PS3 I do. ill test the PS3 with Dolby Dig off and updates after.
,dcoleman,2010-07-09T09:42Z,Sorry my audio is set to Linear PCM 2 Ch.
,dcoleman,2010-07-09T10:13Z,I confirmed this plays just fine on PC running Win 7 and using VLC. It is a setting on the PS3 that is finding this in the Audio Streem. I have not been able to find the setting that might be causing this. I am also not connected to the internet and have not had an update on the PS3 in a long time.
