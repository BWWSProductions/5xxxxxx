Mega Disasters: Methane Explosion 

Experience the nightmare of burning clouds and surprise tsunamis in this terrifying examination of another worst-case scenario.

â€¢Stunning computer graphics and actual footage combine to create convincing pictures of the risks faced by U.S. cities.
â€¢MEGA DISASTERS explores the worst of what could happen.
â€¢Methane is a vital greenhouse gas, but could it trigger global catastrophe?



It has happened before, and it could happen again. What makes storms, earthquakes and other events into natural disasters is not how they occur, but where they strike.

MEGA DISASTERS asks the what ifs no one ever wants to face. A masterful blend of actual footage, computer graphics and interviews with leading scientists and public safety experts explores the outer limits of what could happen if everything went wrong.

Produced naturally by many biological processes (digestion, decay, etc.) and collected naturally in natural gas fields and undersea basins, methane has proven to be a useful source of energy. Yet it is conceivable that this noxious, naturally-occurring gas has the capacity to destroy modern civilization.

Theories suggest that gigantic eruptions of methane gas from deep in the ocean have occurred regularly throughout history.

MEGA DISASTERS reconstructs just what such a horrifying event would be like. Even a small explosion in the mid-Pacific would create wave after wave of tsunamis, wiping out Hawaii and much of the West Coast. Hellish clouds of methane and water would burn across the skies, floods would annihilate inland regions, and most plant life would be destroyed.

We would be plunged into a modern Dark Age.
