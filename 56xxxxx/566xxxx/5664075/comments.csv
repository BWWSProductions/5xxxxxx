,kennlou,2010-07-02T17:50Z,spamcrap is a dick there is nothing wrong with this file it a cbr file!!!!!
,moonrunner99,2010-07-02T19:42Z,"not spam, nothing wrong with this it is the comic book as labeled. spamcrap must be smoking something."
,spamcrap,2010-07-02T20:28Z,"A .cbr file IS a .rar file renamed. When I extract that .cbr file I got a file called Beautiful.avi.

After the childish retort by kennlou and the two other silly comments I believed I could be wrong. I did not ever call it spam, just a fake. As for being jealous, about what ???

I absolutely am tired of seeing this Anonymous being listed with multiple fakes every day. 5 or 6 movies were just posted and then deleted withing minutes for being fakes.

Earlier today I read somewhere that there is an anonymous flag that can be set when posting so maybe that is why so many fakes show up under Anonymous.

In the end, these posters are correct and I am wrong. I downloaded this torrent again and it is the real thing. I made a mistake.

In the future I'll be more careful before posting FAKE unless it is a blatant misrepresentation such as posting a show as avi and it is wmv (frequently fakes.)

I won`t bother joining in with anyone to flame someone. It just makes them look like ""dicks""."
