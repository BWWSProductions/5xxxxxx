Alex Lifeson Guitar Lessons DVD

Alex kicks back in his studio and takes you on a detailed run-through of 3 popular Rush hits.

The "Spirit of Radio" riff is fascinating.  It is one of the most well-known repeating 8-notes in Rush' repertoire.  Impossible for most to play . . . he makes it appear fluid and effortless and explain a trick he uses to do it.
But the reason he has made Guitar Magazine's #1 Rock Guitarist twice is not speed, but it is creativity and a unique style, with strange chord structures that no one else uses.  

It is Alex himself that is so interesting.  He has this relaxed manner about him that you could swear you are right there talking with your next-door neighbor.  His enthusiasm for his music is very apparent.
