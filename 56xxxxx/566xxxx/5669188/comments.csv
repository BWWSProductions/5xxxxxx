,darkpantherian,2010-10-11T19:42Z,"@Hobag69:  Most Japanese adult films are, and even the anime/manga of Japanese is censored.  They don't mind showing a girl's breasts or what-have-you, but heaven help if a girl, or guy, has hair on their genitalia.  They'll censor that in a heartbeat.  They make a lot of what would be counted as porn over here in the states, and even B.S.S.M. is counted as safe for children over in their own country, but was rated 'unsafe' for American children on Cartoon Network (Channel 296 for DirecTV I think).  They have a show called Adult Swim on at night, and they show a lot more on there than they did on Sailor Moon.  To each their own, they say, but they could have shown the unedited, original Sailor Moon on Adult Swim at night.  Maybe one day they will, but in the meantime, it's better to get the full version on torrent, and even P.G.S.M. can now be found on torrent, Jap. voice, with English subtitles."
