Taking into account the long history and wide range of Confucian Studies, this book introduces Confucianism â€“ initiated in China by Confucius (551 BCâ€“479 BC) â€“ primarily as a philosophical and religious tradition. It pays attention to Confucianism in both the West and the East, focussing on the traditionâ€™s doctrines, schools, rituals, sacred places and terminology, but also stressing the adaptations, transformations and new thinking taking place in modern times. Xinzhong Yao presents Confucianism as a tradition with many dimensions and as an ancient tradition with contemporary appeal. This gives the reader a richer and clearer view of how Confucianism functioned in the past and of what it means in the present. A Chinese scholar based in the West, he draws together the many strands of Confucianism in a style accessible to students, teachers, and general readers interested in one of the worldâ€™s major religious traditions.
