,cheesemethod,2010-07-04T14:04Z,"I don't mean to sound ungrateful, just curious, the past few UFC torrents I've downloaded. The sound is really tinny and out of sync, yet any movies/tv shows are all perfect, For better sound and more fps i'd be happy enough to download a bigger file.
Cheers"

,Frice,2010-07-04T16:36Z,"Be careful reading UFC torrent comments... alot of a-holes (im sure hired by the UFC) are ruining fights by commenting: who wins and how.

Pretty fucking annoying. No one cares you watched PPV. Fuck off and die.

You have been warned MMA lovers!"

,LozRiva,2010-07-04T22:47Z,"Hopefully the fights are good, the ufc ones always seem to go so slow coming down, unless you wait 3 days or so after event. Been DL'ing this one since 11 am and still only half way! You have to spend the whole day away from the internet as idiots like to spoil results! lol
Looking forward to watching and thank-you very much to up-loader :)"

Btw, if you caught a spoiler from some asshole, the main event is more than worth it even if you know the outcome.  Great event.  Thanks for the upload!!!"

,skyve,2010-07-05T03:02Z,torrentzone thx for the uploading and may god bless you.
,ronin.,2010-07-05T03:07Z,Is it just me or is the UFC becoming the WWE?  The last three or for UFC's have been crap.  The winner of the fights are planned and its a fucking soap opera.  FUCK THE UFC
,scatattack,2010-07-05T07:48Z,"Thanks very much for the upload, it was much appreciated.  :')   ref to ronin the guy that thinks the ufc is becoming more like the wwe, well my response to that is that you're a tard. The only thing that bothers me when it comes to the ufc, is all the fucking shitty advertising, (especially the usmc, united states marine core). Fuck marines and any stupid cunt who wants to go to war just so your goverment can make money. They're glamorising murderers!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,du4cash,2010-07-05T08:49Z,"@ScatAttack

I take it from your user name you like to get poo'd on!  It is very easy for cowards such as yourself to bad mouth the USMC or any military for that matter, because let's face it... you hide behind a computer and well probably could not pass the physical to get in.  You could always move to say... Iran and live their life!"
,wetahdeh,2010-07-05T09:15Z,for once on a UFC ppv all the fights were good!!! on a consistent basis
,scatattack,2010-07-05T09:51Z,"Ref to Du4cash.

It's always stupid bastards with motos like yourself that might join the army or intice people into joining. I'm pretty fit and I train alot (so yeah I reckon I could pass the physical, and if not I don't give a fuck), but I also have a brain, I'm not a coward just because I don't want to fight and bring oil to the so called land of the free. P.s if you want to learn a bit of history and see what's really happening, then i suggest that you watch a documentary called (Zeitgeist final edition), and then get back to me when you know what the fuck you're talking about. Now go back and suck on your moma's tit where you belong."
,LozRiva,2010-07-05T14:37Z,"works great and great picture a10 v10

:) again thank-you to up-loader"
,ljguy300,2010-07-05T17:54Z,"@du4cash you are just making yourself look like an idiot if u are a member of the USMC you are a disgrace to it or any other military branch. I feel sorry for you, and i agree with scatattack hundred percent why do they have to advertise with the usmc its not necessary has there ever been any other ""sport"" that has been advertised on the Usmc like tennis or soccer? No so yes the  ""sport"" of fighting is glamorizing killers. I am from the balkans i have seen my fair share of ppl dying and i would never send anyones child in to a country to do my bidding for me. Whats worse is you attack someones character and i know a marine would not do that at least a good one.     BTW THANK YOU UPLOADER First comment ever and i have to say that i feel sorry for you."
,flyers2114,2010-07-05T18:53Z,scatattack and ljguy.....you are fucking losers....why dont you move your sorry asses out of the USA...so sad that they defend morons like the both of you!!!
,newfie_pride,2010-07-05T19:16Z,"i just wana say....""fuck the Good ol' US of A""!!, bunch of warmongering assholes.  
thanks for the upload pal...."
,scatattack,2010-07-05T22:00Z,"Thanks ljguy300.

Ref to flyers2114, I don't even live in the usa, so how stupid do you look right now? Other countries can have an oppinion not just retarded usa."
,du4cash,2010-07-05T22:32Z,"Ref Scat,

Aaaaah... The sit in your chair thinker.  I do not need to read or watch shows to understand what is going on in the world. I have seen first hand what people can do to each other when left to their own devices... things that would give nightmares to vagina's like you.  Oh... and last I checked... there is no oil in Afghanistan!"
,hobie1k,2010-07-05T23:16Z,"Ref everyone!
 No matter what country you are from or in, or whether or not you agree with the reasons or political agendas behind war. There are men and women who by their own choice joined the military and decided to serve their country and there are plenty who have died for that very reason. This applies to all countries and all nations so whether you agree or not a little respect for those who have died I believe is in order for both sides. These are brave men and women who in the face of adversity still go to defend ""what they believe"" to be right. Yes everyone is entitled to an opinion on the subject of war but don't dishonor those who have given their life. If you want to be pissed be pissed at the politicians who sit behind a desk and decide for these men and women to go die for what sometimes is completely ridiculous reasons."
,du4cash,2010-07-05T23:29Z,Nicely put hobie1k.
,beerbouy3,2010-07-06T00:22Z,why is the 1st part lord of the flies? is this real?
,labman34,2010-07-06T00:53Z,"Wow, Way The Fuck Off Topic.. Try Get A Real Set Of Balls & Make That Complaint @ www.ufc.com ........ This Site Is For Media Sharing... Not Politic Bullshit....
Thank Again Torrentzone, Can't Wait Next One!
P.S. Still Can't fix Stupid........."
,MegaPwnz,2010-07-06T01:33Z,"A service member's bravery is irrelevant, war has always been to the benefit of politicians and their agenda. They declare war and you're the one that dies. Aspire to be more than just a disposable body, but then again I wouldn't expect anything more of you after mindlessly repeating ""I Pledge Allegiance"" since birth. 

I understand; I was enticed into joining the Marines right out of highschool. I wanted to serve, protect, and die for my country, but mainly I joined because I wanted a piece of vengeance for what happened on September 11th 2001. I was 110% motivated...but what I found just horrified me. Global control, an invasive foreign policy, and political tensions almost always instigated by our government. The World Trade Center incident was the result of an intrusive foreign policy over a period of 50 years, and it's the American people who payed for it, are still paying for it, and will continue to pay for it until they realize what's what. 

War, multi-trillion-dollar national debt, collapsing currency...yeah, our government has our best interests at heart. Show me someone who proudly serves that and I'll show you an indoctrinated lobotomized zombie. Maybe at one time it was possible to serve the United States, but now it's about serving the United States Government. And they don't pay for college."
,Nick3rs,2010-07-06T01:50Z,"Ya, ""fuck the Good ol' US of A""!!""????

Who the F*CK is entertaining you with this video? and making sure no other f*ckin country doesn't take your ass over (and the US isn't the only one doing this, I'm just saying them because your ignorant ass is bashing on them) 

scatattack  = Overthinking the situation

,dlldmn,2010-07-24T07:29Z,"Haha, it's funny when someone like me from Canada gets shit on when I go to another country until I'm like ""Oh no no I'm Canadian!"" Then they give me free stuff because they felt bad for thinking I was an American and treating me like ass. 
There's a reason people dislike poopy flagwavers. Patriotism is dense. The ""freedom and peace"" you fight for is your own indoctrinated idea of freedom and peace that you force on others. What makes you think that the ENTIRE WORLD should go along with it. Blah. 
My flag has a giant leaf on it, and I shall smoke it. Now THAT is peace."
,dlldmn,2010-07-24T07:37Z,"And Carwin doesn't suck he just doesn't know what a 2nd round is..

I can't believe people bitch so much about seeding.. Like 90% of people on this site download and don't seed, like seriously.. Swearing and complaining won't help.. Ever.. 

Thanks torrentzone for this, one of my most favorite UFC fights, I appreciate it heaps."
,bompii,2010-10-12T14:35Z,"People nowadays are so egoistic, the new generation is so selfcentred  :) You can see it clearly in scatattack and ljguy. People sacrifice their LIVES to let you live yours properly, fucking douchebags, go die in a corner. Maybe you dont wanna go into war because your a pussy, but atleast be happy someone steps up and defends your sorry ass... grow up kids srsly..."
,catamaranman,2011-02-05T02:18Z,"I'm American and part of being proud is not giving two shits about what someone from another country thinks about it.  BTW, this is the best UFC event I've ever seen.  Definitely one to watch and watch again...."
