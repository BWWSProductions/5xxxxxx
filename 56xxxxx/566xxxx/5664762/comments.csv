[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-02T19:42Z,It's spanish subs. I include all languages in the title of the torrent if it is subtitle or audio. It also states in the NFO and info section of the torrent what is in the torrent.

[T],zombifuzz,2010-07-03T22:04Z,"you sound very professional.  i like it.  but who uses radios when there are ipods and mp3 players?

just kidding buddy!!!!!!!!!!

i could care less.  i speak english so i always get what i want."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-07-03T22:07Z,"oh wow i just went back and read what trin said to mike!  that was NOT good.

i'm thinking i need to e-mail the mods to get this IP address banned from using the pirate bay.

i'll see what we can do about this and i encourage others to do the same.

i also like the use of the translator this guy used.  choppy english and its kind of funny.  make it more obvious.  if there was no translator used then you are just a dumb ass piece of shit.

maybe you should download taco bell coupons instead of torrents from mike.  i saw walmart had some downloadable coupons for pinatas too in case you were interested."

as for everyone else....

i defend my friends.  as agentbay said we have the freedom to speak.  i would stick up for any freidn on the pirate bay.  TPB is home for alot of people and i have a long list of friends i communicate with on a regular basis.

tater44
ctang
mikemelo
bubanee
agentbay
seedkey

if anyone were to badger any of those people i would put my 2 cents in immediately.  TPB is supposed to be a family where people share great things with other people and be grateful.

@Mike douches like this should be kicked out but i believe in forgiveness !!!

PEACE "
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-06T21:04Z,To be honest I do not need to appologize for my actions. You left me a not very polite comment stating you will not download my ups because no spanish audio. That's fine maybe I should have been a little bit more PC about it but it's all good I don't really hold grudges. Thank you for your appology. To be honest it's not really a big deal. I wasn't in the best mood that day either. No worries Trin. Thank you for getting my back everyone but Trin seems like a solid person.

,atomicrabbit,2010-09-04T00:30Z,"How can the video be untouched and re-encoded at the same time. I assume since there are two 5.1 languages, that the video is NOT untouched."
,LBCEVER,2010-09-13T18:03Z,"is there french subs?

because if there's not i don't want to download."
,gorack13,2010-09-18T05:08Z,The video is untouched as nothing was removed from it dip shit. I stated that it was re-encoded. Re-encoding is refering to the bit rate. Untouched is referring to if anything was stripped exactly how you see it for menus was a menu untouched is referring to were any buttons altered not if you re-encoded your bit rate of a menu.

Also there is french audio why do you want French subs?"
