MY 2 favorite hip-hop artists ever.

I had no fucking idea this existed untill a month ago, and it took me as long to finally locate it, and another 3 weeks to finally download it.

I have no idea who made it, or who ORIGINALLY Uploaded it (not me), but I don't give a shit.

This is a fucking dope mix, and If you are a fan of both (or either) you will enjoy.





PLZ SEED WHEN YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED! DON'T BE A HIT & RUN SUCKAMOTHAFUCKA!
