Ripped from the original A & E Biography DVD. Documentary aired in 2002 and mostly uses footage from the Dianne Sawyer (Turning Point) interview but also features a (new) interview with Virginia Graham, the cellmate Susan Atkins talked to about the murders. She went to the police and gave them the break in the case they needed to arrest the murderers. Good quality.
