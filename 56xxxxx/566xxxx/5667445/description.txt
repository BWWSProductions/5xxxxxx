        Witness to his father's murder by the Doones when he was  just
        a child, John Ridd is hell-bent on revenge.

        But a chance meeting with a beautiful girl changes the  course
        of his life.  She is none  other than Lorna  Doone, heiress to
        the family of outlaws. When  the aging patriarch of the  Doone
        Family slides  into death,  the stage  is set  for his violent
        grandson, Carver,  to rule  the clan  - and  take his  cousin,
        Lorna,  as  his  bride.  But  Lorna's  love  for  John thwarts
        Carver's intentions and whips him into a murderous rage...
