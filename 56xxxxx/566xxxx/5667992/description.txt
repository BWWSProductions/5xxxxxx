Dora's on a magical, colorful quest, filled with crystals, dragons, and a greedy king. Oh, no! The king has hidden the crystals in storybooks, and now the Crystal Kingdom is losing its color. Travel with Dora to Dragon land where number skills are needed to show a dragon how to blast away rocks and reveal the yellow crystal. Then, visit a butterfly cave, where kids practice making words with butterfly cocoons to reveal the green crystal. Finally, get out your wand and go head-to-head with that greedy king--and get in some color-recognition practice. When you've recovered the crystals, you can print out the Crystal Kingdom and color it in.
