And the fact that EMI informed us that not only aren't they going to pay us AT ALL but that we are still 1.4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier.? -Jared Leto"

That's why I say, FOR GREAT ARTISTS, DONATE MONEY DIRECTLY TO THEM TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT!!! BUT DO NOT BUY THE CD!!! Fuck the music industry execs. 

You should owe them nothing, Jared. My life would not be the same without you and your music."
