           Twelve sexy, edgy, beautiful women from the famed              
           SuicideGirls website (SuicideGirls.com) shoot a pin-up         
           calendar while staying at a remote cabin in Maine. One by      
           one, the girls start disappearing, leaving the others          
           scared and running for their lives. Seen through the eyes      
           of both hidden and the girls' own cameras, this                
           unscripted story captures the ladies -- all non-actors         
           and unaware their every move is being recorded -- in the       
           first reality horror movie of its kind.
