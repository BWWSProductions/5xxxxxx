Andain - Beautiful Things

************************************************************************


Andain is a San Francisco-based musical group founded in 2001.  The band 
members include producers  Josh  Gabriel  and Dave  Dresden,  singer and 
songwriter Mavie Marcos, and guitarist David Penner. The band performs a 
mix of  trance,  rock and house,  combining live instruments and vocals, 
blended with elements of electronica.  Andain first entered the scene in 
2002 with the debut single Summer Calling, making their breakthrough the 
following year with the second single Beautiful Things. Remaining silent 
after the success  of  their  hit  single,  the band made  a  subsequent 
appearance on Gabriel & Dresden's 2004 compilation album Bloom, with the 
track Here is the House,  a cover  of  Depeche Mode.  The band was later 
announced to be working on new material,  but due  to  high demands from 
other projects of Josh and Dave,  the band  was temporary suspended.  By 
the end of 2006, Dave announced that the album was put back on schedule, 
and the production was once again resumed.
