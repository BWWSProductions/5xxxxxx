IMAGiNE NOTES
Sources used are relizlab video and Flawless audio .....thanks to both.
Well the video was ok not too bad for a cam but like all cams had issues ....camera movement, too strong on the chroma, looked a bit washed out and the rgb colours off....specially the red.
Audio, well far from the best line we've had, but saying that it's still half decent and better then not having any at all :P
Worked done well firstly we used flawless's audio source file and synced it up to our encode, but we noticed the 9 sec pause at the begining was giving alot of users some problems when converting so we add this off our cam release.
Then it was a case of resaving and muxing to our encoded video.
The video .....well for this we messed with the rgb colours to try and balance them out also added more contrast and lowered the brightness a touch, also needed to lower the chroma alot ..... and finally used a smoother as well.
