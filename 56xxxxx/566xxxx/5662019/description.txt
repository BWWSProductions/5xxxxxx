Nu Virgos is the name used to promote the group VIA Gra (Ð’Ð˜Ð Ð“Ñ€Ð°) outside of Russia, Ukraine and other nearby countries. The name VIA Gra is both a reference to the drug Viagra and a play on words, since the first three letters stand for "vocal-instrumental ensemble" in Ukrainian, and "Gra" means "Game" in Ukrainian. VIA Gra is a Ukrainian/Russian girl group that hit the charts in these countries in September 2000 with their first single "Popytka No. 5". Their first success outside the Russian language area was in May 2004 with the single "Stop! Stop! Stop!", an English version of their 2002 Russian song. The group is known for their frequent lineup changes, with 11 different individuals having at one time been in the group.  The group was co-created by Dmitriy Kostyuk and Konstantin Meladze. Kostyuk is the manager of the group and the co-producer of the group's albums. Meladze is the writer of the group's songs and the co-producer of the group's albums.
