,jersson,2010-07-03T13:44Z,I't looks like this is only a trial vers so it's pretty useless. Nice try anyway
,marcusjefferson,2010-07-05T22:17Z,"No problem.
:)"
,Mmascot,2011-03-23T02:15Z,"I'd really appreciate if you didn't share this software without permission.  I will be happy to upload the Email Harvester to this community as a full version and promote the full product within the torrent if you would like, but please be nice to us...we are only a small company and don't make a lot of money...yet ;)"
,Mmascot,2011-03-23T02:19Z,"I would appreciate if you didn't share this software.  If you want a full version of the Harvester, I can get it on this community, but please don't steal from us, we are just a small firm so far."
,Mmascot,2011-03-23T02:20Z,Sorry for the double-post.  I didn't see the original comment and thought it didn't post or something.
,MMKiller,2011-07-07T05:55Z,"Don't do any business with this Mmascot character. He is a scammer, spammer, thief and retarded miserable piece of failure in all aspects of private and online life. I got scammed by him and I will not permit to anybody fall in his trap and pay him for this spamware. Full story is posted on some forums where he is targeting his potential buyers (under bunch of fake nicknames) to buy his crapware, some of them are http://www.blackhatteam.com/f52/warning-for-all-buyers-of-the-mail-mascot-software-47987.html and http://www.moneymakerdiscussion.com/forum/email-marketing/52177-warning-all-buyers-mail-mascot-software.html , please read.


Warning for his potential buyers (victims):

If you ask for some technical details or help over chat on Skype and this freak decide that he's personality is anti-spam oriented in those few minutes - your chat conversation and private data will be posted on some sites and Google anti-spam groups ( http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.net-abuse.email/browse_thread/thread/ffb75d3d8bb1c3e2/1314b72144059c40 ), plus you will not receive your money and your license will be disabled, even if you payed for it and never manage to use it. To make dispute or claim - don't bother, he will post your data to Paypal on the way that you are the spammer and he is the angel, good and all the way trustworthy but just nobody understand his efforts of free emailing rights or whatever he imagine in his retarded head during those moments. On this particular group he is one total retard where everybody punishing him for his spam acts, stupidity in every sentence and miserable pathetic way of hiding the facts that he is just one stupid, but really stupid wannabe gansta, criminal and felony. http://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/evidence.lasso?rokso_id=ROK9226

Do you really want to be sacrificial lamb and take attention on you while he draws attention from his act's ? Do you still want to buy this spamware ? Really, think twice. If you have to do whatever you want to do with those emails in your possession, trying to earn few bucks while he is sending millions of spam emails from special data centers and servers and reporting you for something close to nothing, do it. I am nobody to tell you what is right and what is wrong. But take serious consideration what you are buying and from who. There is so much other software's with similar capabilities, you really don't need to communicate with this scumbag and piece of shit.

His act's and moves are watched really closely from various sides and authorities, it is a mather of time when he will fall down for a long time and be sure that your email, paypal account with full address details and other data from his computer and online accounts are really worth of buying this spamware. Reports against him and his spamming and selling spamware are filling every day by more and more people, it is just a question of time when he will get some nice Bubba guy for the partner in nice little cell.

Yes, I know that he will come here to defend himself, trying to represent me like I am a bad guy because I ask something about options that are hard coded in his spamware and promoted on all videos on youtube and shitty sites, and try to sell something under some of his 20+ nicknames posted on ROKSO list, but if you really understand what I just wrote, if you really don't want to loose your respect, good name in any online or offline community or freedom at the end, you will get the right picture in the head and avoid to answer him in any way, especially positive way; all those posts are monitored because of his famous name by very powerful and dedicated-to-destroy-the-trash groups, will be visible on some interesting anti-spam authority sites (lot of them) and I am sure that you don't want your nickname/email to be confirmed like it is supporting this piece of failure.

Also, there are some posts on the forum,  ""Resuming sales of the s/w is not proving to be worth the hassle of the old users and when we see abusive users attacking us like Vlad has, we are discouraged even more."" so"
,Rarez,2011-12-13T04:22Z,"@MMKiller, Your wrong mate this guy has the knowledge he/she has gone through enough battles with his softwares if you had problems there are plenty of other people to talk to than dissing what he made on a torrent site. I don't agree with what you said and I hope other's read your post and take it with a grain of salt. Cos your fullashit."
