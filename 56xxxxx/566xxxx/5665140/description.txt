J. F Rutherford | International Bible Students Association, Brooklyn, NY | 1925 | ISSN: no | Language: english | 129 pages | PDF | 6.6 MB

The early Bible Students (precursors of Jehovah's Witnesses) were supporters of Jewish rights in Palestine. J. F. Rutherford, second president of the Watch Tower Society, presents his interpretation of Scripture relating to Zionist claims. The support of Zionism was later abandoned by Jehovah's Witnesses. This copy is blue gilt cloth, nice and bright. A letter by Nathan Strauss, a Jewish businessman, praising Rutherford for a radio address concerning the return of the Jews to Palestine, is reproduced just before the publisher's foreword.

(Yet more evidence that the Zionists created the Jehovah's Witness cult as a form of control over the gentiles, and to dilute Orthodox Christianity.)
