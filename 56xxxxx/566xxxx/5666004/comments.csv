,Sprite0,2010-07-06T22:33Z,"Video quality / compression too high for my computer (I've even tried perfectly optimized players on Gentoo Linux, various codec implementations on Windows, etc)...  Using ffmpeg / mencoder to convert takes forever.  Half the people out there are probably having the same problem.  Please upload lower resolution as well / instead.  One can hardly tell the difference anyway.  Also please use codecs supported by HTML5 (ex. VP8 / WebM or Ogg Theora)."
