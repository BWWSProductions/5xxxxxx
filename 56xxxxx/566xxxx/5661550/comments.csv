[T],on.off.on,2010-07-01T16:03Z,Hi mate I think u need to re-encode the video file so the subs are hardcoded into the movie! As far as I can see psp doesnt support SRT files.
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-01T20:10Z,I do that cuz alot of people watches these movies on their pc with vlc player or media player classic. People with iphones can use SrtiPhone to convert the srt file to txt that can be displayed on their iphone =) Personally I never use subtitles... sorry for not being more helpful.
