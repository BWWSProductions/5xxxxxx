,breeson,2010-07-02T20:26Z,This is beautiful - Thanks so much!
,fMfPfA,2010-07-14T17:26Z,all these movies except 4 are all in crappy american dub with crappy subtitles in english!? you said that spoken language was Japanese thats almost complete crap. If you like REAL studio ghibli films in Japanese with eng subs then don\'t download this. Thanks for wasting 12 hours of internet and electricity. But keep lovin\' ghibli!
,fMfPfA,2010-07-14T17:44Z,"sorry, my bad alexa1987. If anyone had the same problem i had, just switch audio track. I\'m a bit of an r-tard and should just go and play COD"

If you are using VLC, then to change the audio track, from the top menu, select Audio>>Audio Track>> and then the desired track.
If you're not using VLC, you can download it from www.videolan.org.

,saraslave,2012-01-16T11:07Z,"This is a great, great torrent!
The only thing i did find, is that the subtitles for Nausicaa seem to be actually closed captions (whoops!) from the english dub instead of actual subtitles. (oops!)
Still, this is great work, and good job uploading it!
Thank you so much for doing it, my Love and I really appreciate it, this is a great collection, thank you!"
