The movie begins in Central City. Siblings Andi and Bruce are shown defrauding a pawn shop owner to raise money to feed their dog, Friday. Soon afterwards, the pawn shop owner approaches them with a police officer, pointing Andi out as the culprit. As she tries to talk her way out of trouble, Bruce's backpack falls and its contents spill out, revealing his scamming supplies. They are arrested and taken to the local police station, where their social worker, Bernie, meets them. He scolds them and says that because they have changed foster homes so many times, they may be separated the next time they do so. Bernie then takes them home to their foster parents, aspiring rock stars Lois and Carl Scudder. The two are angry that the children have missed dinner (and delayed band practice) and Bernie takes responsibility. Andi and Bruce are sent to their room for the night, where they have hidden Friday from their guardians.
