*NOTE* My account was hacked sometime between June 24th and 29th and the following torrents were corrupted as a result:

Knight and Day TS XviD-FLAWL3SS
Craig.Ferguson.2010.06.28.Howie.Mandel.HDTV.XviD-2HD

I have asked for hash clears on these two releases, but even so, they are already available from other uploaders. If you have either of these torrents and your client shows a WMV file in contents, STOP DOWNLOADING AND REMOVE THEM FROM YOUR CLIENT.

Also, four torrents were uploaded under my name by someone other than myself, all applications:

Limewire Pro v5.5.8
Cyberlink PowerDVD
Nero Multimedia Suite 10.0.13100 || Full + Serials + Plugins 
Sony Sound Forge Pro 10.0 (32/64Bit) + KEYGEN 

All six of these torrents have been deleted. Please be aware that I only upload TV, Movies, and Games to TPB. If you see any other types of torrents from me, DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Also, if you see the [TZ] tag at the end of any of your torrents in the "Name" column in your client, STOP DOWNLOADING AND REMOVE THEM FROM YOUR CLIENT. The only place you should see [TZ] is on the torrent listing on TPB - I do not rename any files that I upload.



Sorry for the inconvenience and happy downloading.
