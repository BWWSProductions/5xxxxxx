LED/LCD or nothin nigga!"
,Lakuspakus,2010-11-12T15:37Z,"@AWu-TangLife:You clearly have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. For watching movies and tv-shows like this plasma wins every single time. LCDÂ´s, with or withoud LED backlight simply do not meet the plasmas standard for deep blacks and color correction. With their extremely low input and response-lag they are also superior as a gaming-screen.

The LCDÂ´s are brighter and therefore also works well in very bright conditions. Some people also will notice the phorsphor that is in the Plasma-panel, but they are a very small minority.

Overall the plasma-tvÂ´s nowadays are superior in all departments. The price is better, performance is better and they keep the details of the full 1080p image even in fast-action scenes. The only thing that keeps them down is peoples fear of burn-in. That is however, just a myth. Modern plasmas dont get permanent burn-ins unless you keep on giving them the same high-contrast image for multiple days on end.

So when you say plasma-screens suck, you may want to reconsier."

,Saki33,2011-05-05T19:15Z,"Obviously the clear choice to download, and subs included too. Thanks a bunch.

(Weighing in on the plasma noncontroversy--plasma is also the clear choice. The deciding factor for me was that plasma shows reflections so I went with LED. Guess what? It shows reflections just as bad and now I wish I had gotten plasma.)"
,chuckdeely,2011-07-27T01:29Z,@Lakuspakus It is plasma or nothing! Neo PDP or original Pioneer. So far nothing can touch my pioneer plasma it rocks the fuck out of everything
