,Domayne,2010-10-15T17:53Z,Thanks so much for the upload. Its not fair that they charge for an update to their own software for their own original Hauppauge products.
,ocw,2010-10-20T20:50Z,"Recently I found out that this version is the USA version. Hence I encountered difficulties when installing for my Europe-based card. The difficulty is that I am unable to install the HD codecs.
Can someone upload the Europe-version of this CD?
Thanks."
,ezboard,2010-11-23T09:15Z,lol eurofags just get the USA product.

For European ppl, not NTSC crap USA ones ;)"
,Thisisnotmyname,2011-02-16T01:09Z,"On the website, you can download the newest update, but you will stilll need to download this torrent because ""A valid WinTV application CD-ROM will be needed to install this WinTV v7 version"" 

Those assholes....

Anyways, thanks uploader, I will seed this for as long as I can."

,hhaddow,2011-11-01T20:06Z,i cant believe what they did to me i don't normally give a rats arse about drivers disks -i can just download the latest if i need to install it again right? go to reinstall -download installer -it requires the original disk that i cant find -that's probably in the tip grrr
,tavery80a,2012-01-10T15:50Z,"OK...here's the scoop.  If you want to install Extend AND utilize the latest download version from the website, you HAVE to have purchased a 7.2 ""with Extend"" CD from Hauppauge.  NOT a torrented copy and then use a virtual CD to either burn a CD or to mount from.  No original Extend CD?  No Extend features available.

The latest version from the site includes the latest fixes for iOS 5 on the iPhone when using the ""Extend for iPhone"" app from the App Store.  If you call in to buy a 7.2 CD for 9.95, they will send an email allowing the download version to unlock Extend.  Once you have ""registered"" your WinTV stick, you won't need an original CD, but they'll send you one if you want.  Their records just need to show that you've purchased an Extend CD.

NOTE about the iPhone app - it works with Wifi ONLY in the home through the wireless router, like a PC or Laptop in your house.  If you want to use it away from home, you have to use it through the Safari browser.

So basically it's like this...if you download and install this torrent copy, Extend will work...but only through the Safari browser - NOT with the ""Extend for iPhone"" app.  And you CANNOT use the latest download from their website.  It will automatically lock-out the Extend functionality.

Ain't anti-piracy a biotch?"
