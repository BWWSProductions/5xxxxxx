    Mary Henry is enjoying the day by riding around in a car with two        
    friends. When challenged to a drag, the women accept, but are forced     
    off of a bridge. It appears that all are drowned, until Mary, quite      
    some time later, amazingly emerges from the river. After recovering,     
    Mary accepts a job in a new town as a church organist, only to be        
    dogged by a mysterious phantom figure that seems to reside in an old     
    run-down pavilion. It is here that Mary must confront the personal       
    demons of her spiritual insouciance.
