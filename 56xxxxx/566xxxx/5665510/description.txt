Welcome to the the first round of the 2010 Summer Vengeance Tournament! The top 16 wrestlers battle it out in single elimination! 



JESSE COX 
The Cheerleader 
HT: 5'2
WT: 118lbs
Season record (2-1) 
Ranked 14th
 RAIN DEGREY 
Poison 
HT: 5'9
WT: 124lbs
Season record (1-4) 
Ranked 13th
 

Rain "Poison" DeGrey, is tall, strong and scrappy. This girl never gives an inch during a match. Her tenacity has earned her brutal beatings, as the elite wrestlers had to bring it to match her power. Against less skilled opponents she can be aggressive and brutal. 

Jessie "The Cheerleader" Cox, is a tiny ball of pure energy. This strong little wrestler has been getting a lot of experience in the Tag Team League. She has more mat time then her opponent today!

This is single elimination wrestling at it's best. The loser gets fucked and goes home. If you lose, your season is over! Rain brings the hurt! Jessie is over powered and brutally beaten into submission. Rain doesn't stop there and continues the aggressiveness into Round 4 where she fucks little Jessie like she hates her! This is what Ultimate Surrender is all about! Non-scripted, brutal, real wrestling!
