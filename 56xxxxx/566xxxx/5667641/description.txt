Dr Zakir Naik, one of the best known Muslim speakers and ideologues for inter-religious dialogue appears on the RKB Show and talks about just EVERYTHING., including the conspiracy against him that resulted in the UK government not only refusing a visa, but also labelling him as a proagandist for terrorism and Al Qaeda. As Dr Naik says, " a deliberate selective reading of some of my speeches, coupled with a pre-set mind to deny me entry into the UK was responsible for this decision"

As Dr Naik says on The RKB SHOW, "I preach the word of God as revealed in The Holy Koran to our beloved prophet Mohammad (May Peace Be Upon Him)...certain sects are disturbed at this because their idolatorous practices stand exposed by the words of The Holy Koran. Naturally they will be against me...as they should be" As they should be? The logic is that if these people were to support Dr Zakir Naik, then they would be following the tenets of Islam. Since they are not, therefore they have conspired against him.,.as they are expected to.

As Dr Zakir Naik says, " Even the Prophet Mohammad (May Peace Be Upon Him) was reviled during his lifetime...and by unbelievers even now. So I am not at all unhappy that this is being done to me. It reinforces my faith and tells me I am on the right path"

Watch the extent of the conspiracy, and the real story behind why Dr Naik was denied a visa to the UK...only on The RKB Show

Appeal: Please register your protest by sending emails and letters to U.K. High Commission condemning the UK Home department for their decision to exclude Dr. Zakir Naik to enter U.K & canceling his Visa.
