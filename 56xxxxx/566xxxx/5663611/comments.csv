,newsletter,2011-02-03T00:02Z,"Got everything to work fine, the only issue is that it doesn't let you print after you've selected a vehicle. The ""Repair"" tab is grayed out and the ""Print"" option goes out as soon as you select a vehicle using a VIN # or otherwise. Anyone figured out a way to go around this?
I'll check back in a few days.
One way I found to go around this is by selecting everything you need first and then selecting a vehicle, then not leaving the tab and print is possible then but still the ""Repair"" tab is still always unavailable.
By the way, if you want to avoid error messages, mount the ISO using a virtual drive like MagicDisc.
If anyone comes up with a solution, please post it here.

Thanks"
,clayd13,2011-04-30T07:45Z,the print tab will be available once you calculate the estimate.
