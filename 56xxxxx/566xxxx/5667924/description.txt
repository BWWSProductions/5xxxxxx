Davis, Allen, & Fowkes - Woody With Strings
New York Jazz Records, 2005
Recorded and Produced by Eddy Davis

This album features 12 songs featuring Woody Allen playing the clarinet, along with Eddy Davis and Conal Fowkes.

I attended one of Woody Allen's weekly jazz concerts he played at The Carlyle in the Upper East Side. This is a hard-to-find CD that was only available at performances. This was ripped from a CD, so it is perfect audio quality. I was not able to find the album artwork on the internet, and may just have to scan my copy in.

Hope you enjoy, and please re-seed this rare CD!
