,gold_lion,2010-10-03T15:02Z,Yeah that was a real helpful comment you fucking twat.
,fillinthisspace,2012-01-02T04:29Z,"Well gold_lion, is it blocky or not? Do you even understand what telep_man was referring to?"
,.Leto.,2012-03-04T02:30Z,"It's a bit blocky indeed, compression is clearly visible. When you try to put 2h32min in only 2.33GB you have to sacrifice quality. It's a mistake IMO. Also you don't have here the extreme definition that usually characterizes his rips.
Nothing really bad, it's perfectly watchable, but compared to his other releases it's the first time I'm a bit disappointed with Zektorm.
And it's all in swedish, I don't know why there're 2 different audio tracks, they're identical."
