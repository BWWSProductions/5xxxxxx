Quality is pretty decent.  It's a balance of video quality and file size, with a tilt toward smaller file size.

There's a problem with the 2nd movie though (haven't downloaded the 3rd one so I can't say anything about that).  Around 32 to 33 minutes, in one particular scene only, the video framerate changes.  The audio is unaffected, but the video looks like it switches to like 5 or 10 FPS, kind of a slow motion affect but the speed of the movie doesn't actually change of course.  It's very odd, I've encoded hundreds of MP4 files, and thousands of MPEG-2 files, and I've never seen something happen like this in the middle of a movie.  Needless to say it's NOT my system, it does it at the exact same spot every time on any computer.  It lasts for a minute or so, but the rest of the movie is fine I believe, so decide for yourself if it's a deal breaker.  For me it was, so I deleted it unfortunately (actually I downloaded it and deleted it twice, since I accidentally downloaded what turned out to be the same file from two different torrent sites)."
