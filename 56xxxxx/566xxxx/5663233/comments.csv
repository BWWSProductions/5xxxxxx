,crusader8466,2010-08-27T17:48Z,"Downloading it now. I have been wanting to see this movie since I heard about it a few years ago on G4, but I could never find it. I'm a sucker for alternate history stories. It has always fascinated me how easily our world could be different had a few things gone down a different way."
