Thanks, man.

 PS... you might wanna sign up for a few other mailers: Catherine's, Fashion Bug, Cato.... there's one more I can't think of right now."

[V],bestec1234,2010-07-02T04:41Z,"Torrid's probably what you're thinking of.  They do send me stuff, but most of it doesn't have models on it.

Fashion bug is good but their models are more typical bra-ad models, unlike the Lane Bryant ladies.  I'm not sure about Cathrines or cato."
