From Amazon:

"This is an amazing set of 6 songs that each would carry an album all on their own. Her style is beautiful and impressive, with sweeping crescendos and perfect tonality and musical progression, all with great thoughtful lyrics and a sense of soul and heart that shines through. This is masterful songwriting and musicianship at its very best, and is not to be missed.

There are only 6 songs on this EP, but it's practically a full album because you'll play them each twice. This is one of my favorite sets of all time, and that's saying a lot. Highly recommended! "
