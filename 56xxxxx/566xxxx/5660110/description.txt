Starz is set to bring gladiators to the small screen with "Spartacus: Blood and Sand" from executive producers Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Joshua Donen. The high budget 13-episode first season premiered in January, 2010 with a second season already scheduled for 2011. The show will star Andy Whitfield as the infamous title character Spartacus. John Hannah and Lucy Lawless are some of the more notable names to join the solid cast. The show starts quite slowly and I feel the pilot looks like the bastard crack child of 300 and gladiator, however by the forth episode I was hooked. With all the episodes recorded in HDTV for quality the show gets exponentially better by the episode, which if the trend continues is very promising for next season!










Enjoy and Please Seed!!!
