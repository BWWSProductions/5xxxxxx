so i guess this is the most recent one? or the original one? cuz id really like to let skidrow know, that the latest crackfix still had issues (and i dont wanna start new or use savegames)"
,Vatzz,2010-07-01T17:28Z,"Well...I am trying every new crackfix (including this one) which would hopefully fix my bug at the beginning of the Observatory where a lever was supposed to exist, but no luck yet..Any suggestions?  "
,freekeydude2009,2010-07-01T19:14Z,"hey people
i have  a problem 
i am unable to upgrade my abilities. when i click on any ability (or upgrade) it says that the upgrade is not unlocked. but when i exit the screen then it says ""upgrades available"" . is there some corruption of data or is it the problem of the game.BTW i downloaded the Full rip Joeker version of the game.I will try this release then see"
,Felony69,2010-07-02T00:20Z,"@ freekeydude2009 
I had the same issue. It would not let me select the final 3 Upgrades I had left. 

There are still some door bugs and other glitches that were not resolved. For example, doors disappear and/or get stuck in a sound loop. Or the screen would sometimes ""wig out"" when I used my Stone Shield. Shit like that... It's a buggy game but if you can get passed the little imperfections it's a still fun as hell to play. 

If this game has good DLC, I'll buy it!"

,freekeydude2009,2010-07-02T09:10Z,"@felony69
its not like i cant get the last 3 upgrades . I CANT GET ANY UPGRADES. NOT EVEN ONE! I AM PLAYING WITHOUT UPGRADES . I NEED THEM :("
,freekeydude2009,2010-07-02T09:14Z,"Oh AND one more thing
when i launch the game, it dosent show ubisoft game launcher. it just directly launches the game. has it something to do with the upgrades?"
,freekeydude2009,2010-07-02T17:55Z,"Ok Nvm that i got it fixed. 
if any one else encounters this issue then the only thing u can do to fix it is that u download this crack fix then install it and THEN START A NEW GAME. that is compulsary otherwise the problems wud still persist"
,freekeydude2009,2010-07-02T17:55Z,And Oh thank you for replying :)
,Lahwuns,2010-07-03T01:32Z,"I still have the upgrade problem even after I started a new game. :/ I have the SKIDROW release, and replaced the old crack with this crackfix. D: Halp?"
,i_got_you69,2010-07-06T14:18Z,"ok well i am using this crack fix but i guess it still has some bugs.i am stuck at ""The fortress gates"" there is this gears and levers puzzle where you need to close the gate to stop the sand soldiers coming into the castle.now i have sloved the puzzle like 5 times ..tried restarting the game done every single thing..but the door just wont close..has anyone got past this or has any suggestions That would help me?"
