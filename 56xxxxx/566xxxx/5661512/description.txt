RELEASE DATE : 28-06-2010 PROTECTION : Ubisoft DRM
GAME TYPE : Action DISKS : CRACKFIX


Release Notes:
A little statement about the work involved:

To clear the minds of the individuals who think: Game x was
done fast and this one taking ages etc. The way the Ubisoft
DRM works makes it so that every game is like a brand new
challenge. What it does do is offload certain parts of the
game to a server game then requests those things at runtime.
These parts can be anything that the developer wants. In the
case with Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands those things
were:

- Levers logic
- Door timing
- Upgrades
- Abilities
- XP Levels
- Area codes

Every time you step on a button in game it sends a request
to server asking what to do. Server then sends the door code
to open including how much time it stays open. Levers work
similarly every time you press the TAB button to display
skills game asks again server: What skills do player have

All that stuff takes a lot of time to implement right and we
do implement it like the original do. All our doors open and
close with exact same time factors as the retail do. We just
wanted to clarify a little how the Ubisoft DRM really does
work because a lot of those individuals we mentioned in the
beginning of this statement didn t seem to understand yet
what kind of monster this is. It s not some simply Values
going around like it were with Assassin s Creed II.

Saving Notes:
If you have a savegame with you trapped behind a door because
you returned to a checkpoint after you died then you need to
restart a new game.

It s not possible to fix your save as your save relay on old
packets that are wrong.
