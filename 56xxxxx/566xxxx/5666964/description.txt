Orwellâ€™s classic political fable is often cited as simply a condemnation of Stalinism, which it certainly was, but its political relevance is both wider and more enduring, as novelist Ann Patchett notes in her introductory essay to this new edition. Among the lessons contained in its pages is the need of politicians for â€œThe Enemyâ€ (think Axis of Evil) and the dangers of individuality to oppressive political order.

Absolutely first-rateâ€¦comparable to Voltaire and Swift. â€” The New Yorker

â€œTwelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No

creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and
from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was
which.â€
