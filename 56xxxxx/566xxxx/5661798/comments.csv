Keep up the good job!!"
[V],pluto999,2010-07-01T19:10Z,Why is it showing 0 seeders when you have atleast more than 2 dozen? The sample looks great to me. good job. Working in your b'day too.. Nice.
[V],twentyforty,2010-07-01T19:19Z,"In last couple of hours popped up SIX releases - and, unfortunately, same as mine, all from that crappy Chinese MPG2 disc. I haven't watched encodes of others, so I cannot do any comparison. If they just ripped that R6 without watching the result, I guess that all are shitty as the source. ""Do not make cookies from the dirt. They cannot taste good"" my grandma have said.

Have you noticed how Arrow's (Scene-group) Greenberg in first incarnation has been 20 minutes shorter? Well, they ""propered"" their misdoings on cost of 240 TERABYTES burned in downloads of the first one, payed by the suckers all around.

Did they say Sorry? Nope...
But you or me would be crucified for that."

[V],twentyforty,2010-07-01T20:17Z,"@htctouch: And you expect from me to check IMDb rating at least dozen times a day? And update torrent ASAP?
LOL.
In time of  9,179 votes rating WAS 7.3.
That is why the number of votes stands for in the first place. Two years from now it could be 5.2 or 8.6, depends who gets majority... and I tip on 8.6.
BTW, I haven't watched the movie, maybe later I would."
,lilars26,2010-07-01T20:33Z,It said 5.7 just now.
