Subtitles: external, English for non-English spoken parts, Arabic

NOTE: Weird R6, badly encoded (blurry with blockness, lot of doubled moving objects-kind of "ghosting", probably done by absolute beginners. Chinese subtitles have been removed and video and audio improved within the limits. But - by miles better than any CAM or TS.
