,SonOfBasuto,2010-07-03T05:03Z,"The pistol is amazing - doesn't have a silencer because it doesn't need one - when the 7.62mm round is fired, all you hear is a quiet metallic click. Only about 600 fps (200 m/sec) muzzle speed (for help in silenced shooting), but still penetrates level II armor at 25 meters.  Unfortunately, neither Amazon nor Walmart carry them...lol"
