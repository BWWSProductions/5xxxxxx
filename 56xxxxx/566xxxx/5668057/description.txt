Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



The story of the Cuban revolution is told by those who witnessed the struggle firsthand in this revealing documentary from filmmakers Nestor Almendros and Jorge Ulla. In addition to exploring some of Fidel Castro's questionable methods of achieving absolute power, Almendros and Ulla's film also takes a closer look at previous accounts that may have been hastily dismissed in the past.

Despite a well-established record of mass torture and imprisonment of thousands of law-abiding citizens for political reasons, it sometimes appears that the regime of Ferdinand Castro in Cuba has gotten away with its crimes. So completely is this the case that, to leftists all over the world, the name "Castro" still has a heroic ring to it. Consequently it has become almost taboo to discuss the horrific misdeeds of the "hero's" regime, but the makers of this documentary intend to set the record straight, and in a series of interviews with survivors of Castro's prisons, they reveal many surprising facts about the dictator's perfidious regime. Many of those interviewed were formerly high officials in Cuba's communist government who fell from favor. They know (literally) where the bodies are buried.
