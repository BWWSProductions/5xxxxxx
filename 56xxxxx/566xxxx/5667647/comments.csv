Use PowerISO to extract audio and video folder.nn2. Use FixVTS1.603 to fix the vobs inside the extracted video folder by running thru it.nn3. Use DVD Shrink to produce new iso.nnDONT FORGET TO ALLOCATE at least 14 Gb of space for the extracted video, the new fixed vobs files and the new iso. Excluding of coz the free space needed to run these softwares in the C drive."
