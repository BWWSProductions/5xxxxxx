,DaMooseSausage,2010-07-02T20:09Z,thanks...now i just got to wait till the 9th i think...for the stealth patch...thanks...this is REALLY FUCKERS...get it while the gettin is good...
,Popeben,2010-07-03T17:12Z,"Does anyone know if it's ok to play a game online, if it stealth passed using ABGX but when checking the ABGX database on their website it has a question mark under 'Stealth for Ixtreme'. Just Cause 2 is a good example. Can anyone help?"
,ninjanutta,2010-07-03T21:20Z,"dont any of you have a clue or what? Its SSV2 which means its a 0800 retail rip,in others words its as safe for live as its going to get,its as good as verified so online play is ok.do some research before posting the same dumb comments every time a game gets upped"
,MDavo1,2010-07-03T23:20Z,Why are only half the files shown as winrar files.

,93keja,2010-07-08T19:14Z,Thanks! the game is working perfectly
,jdmk2,2010-07-08T23:43Z,@mssocal619 Winrar is so easy to use. Once the torrent has finished downloading you just go to the first rar file and right click lots of options will appear and you can choose \'extract her\' and it will extract the iso and .dvd file then you just you Imgburn to burn it. any help just message back and i\'ll be glad to help!
,jdmk2,2010-07-08T23:45Z,@Fillep_91 this is wave 6 go here to check game waves and to check stealth. Once a game appears in this list it will get verified and providing it is SSvz and has split vid it\'s as safe for live as possible.

Going to try and run it through abgx without checks and burn at 2.4X on Verbatim Dual Layer Disc...will post update.  For those of you who know, don't run through ABGX with checks on...try and burn it ""As Is"""
,jpmabrey,2010-09-18T16:19Z,"Game works FLAWLESSLY.....Please disregard my previous statement.  I must have had a bad disc, because this download is well worth it!!  I ran it through ABGX, and burned using Clone CD Version 5.2.81  on Verbatim Dual Layer Disc at 2-2.4x speed.  Good job Morck22!  (My 360 is modded with iXtreme 1.6)"
