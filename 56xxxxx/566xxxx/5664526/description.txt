"Now you see it. You're amazed. You can't believe it. Your eyes open wider. It's horrible, but you can't look away. There's no chance for you. No escape. You're helpless, helpless. There's just one chance, if you can scream. Throw your arms across your eyes and scream, scream for your life!"

King Kong is a 1933 film co-directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, and written by Ruth Rose and James Ashmore Creelman after a story by Cooper and Edgar Wallace. 

The film tells of a gigantic island-dwelling gorilla-like creature called Kong who dies in an attempt to possess a beautiful young woman. 

Kong is distinguished for its stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and its musical score by Max Steiner.

King Kong was officially released for the first time to DVD in November 2005, having undergone an extreme restoration process by Warner Brothers. The source for the DVD material was a well-preserved internegative  of the film found in the United Kingdom; it also had all censored scenes intact, and a new camera negative of the film was produced to replace the original, which had been destroyed.
