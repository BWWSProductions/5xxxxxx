Since this damn thing was so hard to find, i ended up cracking it myself :-)
Since I'm also not the only one looking for it, I'll share it with you.
Works under any version of XP / 2000 / Vista, 32 or 64bit.
The recovery system is v3.1, but since it's only for restoring this doesn't matter, it works :-)

Burn, slap CD in drive, install, copy over cracked files, reboot.
Have fun!
