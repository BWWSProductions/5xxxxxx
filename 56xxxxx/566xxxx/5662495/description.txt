The inmates of a Young Offenders Institution are beyond help: too tough to handle, too far gone to be brought back. Their prison is a dumping ground for the worst in the systemâ€¦until they are sent to the wilderness. They are dropped into an alien world of dense forests, treacherous rivers and jagged coastline. For one week they have to learn to work as a team, to develop character and maybe even discover a new respect for each other. But theres someone else on the island who wants to teach them a bigger lesson, and they are about to become his prey. Following the gruesome slaughter of their team leaders, the young criminals find themselves alone and cut off from any chance for help. The only way to survive is to pull together against this hunter and his pack of savage dogs as he picks them off one by one.
