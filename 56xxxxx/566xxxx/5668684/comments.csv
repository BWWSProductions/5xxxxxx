,superduperjim,2010-12-01T06:10Z,"People who don't understand what a keylogger is, or that, yes, it WILL show up as a virus, have no business using torrents, or any other such download software."

If you're that scared, buy the software!

@ all having their antivirus snatch up files before they can complete:

You will need to tell your AV to either stand down
(add exception) or fook off (turn it off) temporarily. There's a gazillion AVs out there, so I can't tell you how to do this on yours. Nod32 is pretty easy to figure out and gives you a lot of control. Although, you will need to pay for it. If you know how to get it without paying for it (safely) then  odds are you already know what I've said here and are wasting your time reading it. :p

Thx 4 tha up TheGreekTracker. :D"
,db78636,2011-06-11T00:23Z,"So, yeah, just grabbed this and it is in a .rar archive. So this means antivirus software won't ""see"" it until you extract. With that said, nod32 had nothing to say when I did so. "
,db78636,2011-06-11T00:34Z,"man I wish you could edit comments here. Anyway...

Installation Notes from .nfo file:

Install Setup.exe and make sure NOT to install into stealth mode
        (if you do, you may have trouble copying crack over, you have
        been warned!).  After installation copy precracked exe from the
        Crack folder to the installed folder of Spytech SpyAgent, making
        sure to overwrite the existing file.  You can now launch Spytech
        SpyAgent and choose stealth mode to hide the application.  Nags
        and 30 minute limitation have been removed.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.

Note: if you want to view .nfo for yourself, open with notepad or an nfo viewer. I recommend ""damn nfo viewer."" "
,perplexingapex,2011-06-12T20:25Z,"It installs just fine, but when I copy the cracked sysdiag file over the installation folder and attempt to run the program, I get, ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.  You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.""

Also if it's worth noting - I can cut and paste the cracked file over, but I can't copy and paste it for some reason.  If I try to copy it, it tells me I need permission to perform is action, but I'm logged in as administrator....

AV is turned off and I did not install it into stealth mode."
,CVezery,2011-06-30T05:38Z,"to everyone that's stupid enough to listen to an antivirus on this,
get the fuck off of the internet.
the antivirus will find the keylogger.. because its a keylogger. it will find a virus in the crack because the companies pay the people making the av to do so -.-"
