Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



The lives of two brothers take different paths in this Cuban political drama. Javier becomes a successful businessman, while his brother Dario becomes a bomb-planting anarchist caught up in Cuba's political turmoil. The story begins in 1932 and progresses through the early days of Fidel Castro's rise to power.
