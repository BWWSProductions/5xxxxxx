- First 5 Studio Albums -

Unlike other important bands from the classic Italian prog movement (symphonic prog as the most common), AREA meanders between jazz-rock/fusion and RIO/avant-prog. Their music is characterized by Demetrio Stratos' voice acrobatics and the incredible high skill of the involved musicians. 1979, at the age of thirty-four, Demetrio Stratos succumbed to aplastic anemia. Thereafter AREA's fascination disappeared.

Really not for everyone, as AREA from time to time overstrain their listeners with riotous provocations right up to demented weirdness. Be warned!
