i applaud your efforts.
i think it's important to capture the original mix VS CD releases and re-releases.

i am not slagging your work here.  just trying to make sense of comparisons.

like dark side i detect some cymbal and ""S"" distortion in this vinyl capture.  i notice you used dolby noise reduction.

NR can introduce artifacts into an otherwise great audio capture by my experience.

i'm not sure if what i hear is an artifact or if it's further up the equipment chain.

given it's similar to what i hear on dark side maybe NR is the culprit or clipping?  you tend to max out your captures.

personally i like to go without NR unless absolutely necessary and peak at -6dB but that's me.

are there forums for vinyl capture?  would you contribute if there were one to discuss and debate and try and get people up to speed?

i thought i was alone doing this for family members and friends who liked their vinyl.

again thank you very VERY much for the QVT project.  i hope none of my comments are taken as negative or insulting.

keep up the good work and maybe post a NR in and NR out version of something next time?

cheers
