,gyaradon,2011-01-17T23:39Z,"You buried the lead: this is the 200g vinyl remaster. That's important! My appraisal is that this is the best rip of Aqualung for anyone to have. There was a previous 16-bit rip, but it was a little too treble-y and harsh. This is the one to have.

Of course, we must remember that the sound is a bit of a lie. Listen to Steve Hoffman's DCC CD of Aqualung, and you'll hear pretty much what the tapes supposedly sound like. Congested and lacking in top end is what this album was when it left the studio. It is said that the monitors in the studio were very bright, and so the engineers over-compensated in the other direction. Steve Hoffman's release basically tells the truth about how the album was mastered. This LP lies a little. Fortunately, it's not like the MFSL vinyl, which gave a cartoonish boost to the low bass. This master lifts and clears the top end, and the result is a much more satisfying listen than the DCC. Even if it's not quite the way the original album was mastered, it's the best release to listen to, and that's what it's all about."
,RFTech,2011-05-05T02:17Z,Awesome! Vinyl Rules with 24/96! Man this sounds great compared to the remastered reissue! More 24/96 vinyl! Forgot how warm vinyl is without the artificial induced dynamic range put out by the 1st ten years of CD reissues!
