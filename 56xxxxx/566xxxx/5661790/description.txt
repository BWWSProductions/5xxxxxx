"Winter soldier" is term derived from Thomas Paine's quote:

"The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis,
 shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."
The opposite of a "summer soldier" who "shrinks from service" is someone who will stand strong under the worst
 conditions, thus they are "winter soldiers".


This is just a tip of an Iceberg. There are many others who feel the same but donâ€™t have the courage to come
 forward and there are others who are ruthless and senseless enough not see & feel this way!
