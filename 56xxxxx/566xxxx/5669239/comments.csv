,kuttootta,2010-10-01T05:18Z,Thanks bone for the great movie upload in small quality and also big thanks for scorp.
,DONJNB,2010-10-07T07:46Z,"Good Quality
But it should be more good as its in MKV format. In some scenes the picture is not so crystal clear.
I think RiddlerA is the best ULder for MKV x246 formats in small file sizes.
A - 9
V - 8"
