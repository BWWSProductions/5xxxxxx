,retardoface,2010-07-03T22:33Z,this ones smaller eh
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-03T22:41Z,"well i had to redo it for 2 reasons: #1 the old one had an upload issue so the track ""lessons"" was F*cked. and #2 its my favorite record and this wont be the last time I record it ;)

also i switched my cartridges and i believe this one sounds alot better than the old one.
