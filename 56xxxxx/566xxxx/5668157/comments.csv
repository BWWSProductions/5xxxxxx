[T],RedHatcc,2010-10-24T18:36Z,"This is not a copy of another torrent as someone else suggested. 

And you can burn this to a cd instead of a dvd the size is 500mb+-

And this is intended for a clean install, which means you boot from the cd and install it, when you install it in VMWare, the config file does not load the cd key, in which you will need to find one (in most cases) 

This is the XP cd i keep in my nifty repair case :) has always worked every time, not sure how doing a clean install with this could possibly go wrong unless you have flawed hardware. 

As someone stated above, it does include some SATA drivers, but not every SATA driver. If you have a new motherboard it would be best to download the SATA drivers an slipstream it into this package or load them when the installation prompts you to. 

And we do have keys on the GuruFuel site, this is for other copies of Windows as well, and was not intended for this specific copy. But we have a couple massive threads with generated and validated keys."

[T],RedHatcc,2010-11-18T03:10Z,"And a few others were asking about a clean install and what that means. 

Clean install is when you boot to the cd, and format your pc and then load the os. Do not install this over your current os or try to upgrade. 

And do not launch within windows or the setup file won't load properly and it will prompt you for a key. 

This is a activated copy that works when you do a clean format and reload, ex. a friend has viruses, wipe and reload the os :D"

I think maybe you might be talking about an XP version called Eye Candy. It was a great version until Mic*****t found all the serials and messed us all up. I know he did release one after that but sorry I dont remember that one."

,sirius.,2011-04-22T19:17Z,"Is it really activated already?
It passed MGAdiag (Verification Status reads Genuine)
Activation says it is activated (Looked at  oobe\msoobe.exe /a, but i dont know if its just programmed to say it activated or not) 

Redhatcc is it truly activated? I just dont want to see in  30 days ""windows needs to be activated""
"
,MrKassner,2011-04-29T09:48Z,"I've NEVER used any pre-activated OS before because they always seem to be slightly modified versions of the OS (updates preinstalled, programs preinstalled, etc), but this one looked and said it's 100% original and as far as I can tell it is. So far I've installed it in a VM and downloaded all updates available without a single problem, browsed the internet, changed computer options to my liking, restarted multiple times as updates needed it, and so on. This is now my Windows XP CD of choice to be used for everything. Thank you!"

definitely will need to 1st update some of the drivers and softwares, so i started with MS Windows update and the OS passed the online MS WGA test and presently downloading about 100 XP file updates..  

this torrent is super the best! thanks RedHatcc!"
,352Fella,2011-07-26T05:20Z,"5min d/l. Thanks. Clearly ppl are trying to install over their current version, and not doing a clean install. I'll comment in 31 days :)"
,Raventhorn,2011-08-18T14:43Z,"@valkon4
1) The ""Program is too large to fit into memory"" error does not mean it's infected with a virus, it most likely means the Windows Installer or whatever program you're trying to run cannot fit in your system's available memory. Try doing a memory test or installing additional RAM modules and try again. If this doesn't work, reinstall your Windows, but check your CD for faults (scratches on the back, read errors during the burning process) and ALWAYS verify your files after burning an OS installation disc!
Of course it IS advisable to disconnect from the Internet when you're (re)installing Windows, and installing an anti-virus and firewall before (re)connecting.

2) If you can't install Windows, then you can't run programs, no. Try the above or try running a smaller application if installing did succeed.

3) Drivers and Programs are 2 completely different things. Programs (software) typically give you something to do with your hardware, like browsing the web or playing a game, while drivers translate the commands you give in the program so your hardware can show what its worth. Most essential drivers are installed and loaded during or prior to the Windows Setup, so again, try point 1.

Don't come here claiming its a fake if you haven't figured out what the source of your problems is, especially when you don't know what you're  talking about. I'm not claiming to be a pro either, but use some more Google and follow the uploader's description... It's not there just to look pretty. ;)"
,Raventhorn,2011-08-18T21:55Z,"Thanks RedHatcc, it works like a charm. Reinstalled 2 laptops and a desktop with it today, no problems at all. (all clean installs, no upgrades)"
,skulldragon,2011-08-21T01:18Z,"This far it works, I couldn't detect any illegal activities or corrupted settings yet, like I find in most XP releases (SYN attacks enabled, forced IE8 without having IE6 first, etc).

First thing I noticed, that this is not allowed on Windows Update website (I prefer to update manually) - supposedly, I had no ""latest SP"" installed, though winver said SP3 was there, but actually it really isn't.
So, if you want to use Windows Update website, you do have to install real SP3 first.

Second thing, it is not bloated with useless drivers, so no internet connection or any hardware support. Have your driver disks or driver backups ready.

This passes WGA with ease. I also installed IE8.

Even if it will pop up WGA notice after 30 days, well, I don't give a shit. There's always ""RemoveWGA"" available on net."
,skulldragon,2011-08-21T01:26Z,"Oh wait, this does have SYN attacks also enabled..
Is this a default setting set by M$?"

It has the black background and a window that says...did not pass validation"
,EricEden,2012-03-16T16:05Z,"@atlanta2000 

I am afraid that you while updating your XP via Windows Update you also have downloaded the WGA tool.  Check the net on how to remove it in safe mode."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-05-13T01:20Z,"Enough people liking this for me to work with it, needed a descent one for making a distro. Looks like yours is the one. Don't worry im simply using the os part of this that you got precracked verified. Been seeing people wanting a XP pre-setup for their laziness. And I can always trust a fellow pink skull."
