,shasha2333,2010-12-08T18:59Z,"@Evil_Destroyer ...Wow, really? It's called google it, sigh but I'm guessing you can't figure out how to do that, if you have PC install Haali Media Splitter and view with Windows Media Player or Media Player Classic Homecinema, if you hve Mac install Perian and view with Quicktime, again wow."
