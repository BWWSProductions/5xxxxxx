,daniyal_95,2010-07-17T13:48Z,sam please upload tere bin laden
,neothegod,2010-07-24T19:13Z,This is worst upload ever. You have deleted almost 20 mis from the movie. A 4 V 3. Don't upload torrent just for being the first one to upload. I thought you were dependable. Next time I will check twice  before downloading your torrents. You have lost a fan. xRG has gone far ahead of you. You have lot to catch up.
