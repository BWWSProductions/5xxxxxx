,radiomasten,2010-07-07T18:06Z,What's the meaning of sharing an app for less than 1 hr? This torrent should be marked as broken. Has been stuck at 20.7% for almost a week now...

,Nicolai123,2010-07-17T14:07Z,"Those of you claiming this one to be a working rti. Will It go in my volvo v70 2004. I have tried burning with imgburn, using verbatim dual layer discs. I can make the car accept this burn, but the navigation is not active with this disc in, and I can make no destinations. I have used many earlier updates from here, this is the first I am having problems with."
,OssianF,2010-07-17T17:05Z,Works OK in S60 MY2005.nBig question: where are the other two DVDs???
,Nicolai123,2010-07-17T18:43Z,"I downloaded it twice, then I had success with this file. Thanks to the uploader."

,Eddan,2010-08-07T14:49Z,"I have an XC70-02, I´d burned the file with imgburn onto a Verbatim DL at 1x speed. it went ok.

But when I insert the DVD in the car the player says, ""Can´t read disc, try the cleaning disc...bla bla bla""

does anytone else have this problem?"

,PhotoJoe,2010-09-23T19:28Z,"@Eddan: Perhaps your XC70 -02 has a CD and not a DVD. Volvo changed from CD to DVD during 2002.

I wonder why this is not an IMG-file? I don't know how to burn this on a Mac. Is it the whole folder (EU-1800-00C-1022.MDS) that I should burn onto a DVD-DL, just drag the folder and burn it? I'm using Toast Titanium 10.0.2. Plz help!"
,PhotoJoe,2010-09-26T21:27Z,"I found the solution! Due to the TWO files, you have to merge them into ONE. Just use the cat command in Terminal like this:
cat /path/to/image.I00 /path/to/image.I01 > /Users/your shortname/Desktop/newimage.iso

Worked like a charm on my iMac!"
,Vikingemorten,2010-10-11T12:22Z,Anyone willing to help on getting this to work?
,Vikingemorten,2010-10-11T13:06Z,"Followed all steps. 

What do I name the new file that is being burned?
Burn as files or img?

I did burne as img, but the car tells me the dvd is not a map dvd??? "
,flexi,2010-10-17T17:34Z,"can not read the disc. contact a car workshop

,Jonas_latt,2011-10-06T23:52Z,"Hejsan jag laddade ner 
Volvo RTI - 2010.1 Europe DVD - MMM/P2001 
A-B-C

men fÃ¥r det inte att funka. Ska prova annat mÃ¤rke pÃ¥ skivan i morgon.
Men fÃ¶rstÃ¥r inte hur det ska gÃ¥ till? ska man mata in DVD A och starta rti Gps och vÃ¤nta? NÃ¤r ska man stoppa i DVD skivan -B? och sedan C? kommer den be om skivan?

Hi, I downloaded
Volvo RTI - 2010.1 Europe DVD - MMM/P2001
A-B-C

but should it not work. Will try another brand of disc tomorrow.
But do not understand how it's done? you should enter the DVD A and start the RTI Gps and wait? When to stop the DVD disc B? then C? will ask for the disc?"
