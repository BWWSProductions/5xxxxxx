A blazing arcade-style third person game fueled by precision gunplay,
Red Dead Revolver is a classic tale of vengeance on the untamed
frontier. The addictively fun, innovative combat scheme rewards
accurate and ruthless elimination of backwater lowlifes. Ride down
outlaws on horseback, fight bloody duels aboard trains, command
stagecoaches and more in your quest for justice. Punctuated with dark
humor and filled with the elements that make the Wild West so compelling,
Red Dead Revolver's story is told through full motion cutscenes and
breathtaking in-game visuals.
