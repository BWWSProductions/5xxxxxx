Are u still stucked with Floppy Disk? U got to be kidding, right? Blu Ray =>1.44MB movie?

@YIFY
I'm really appreciate ur effort. I wonder how u could manage to rip such a decent quality at such small size..

To everyone..

Do you know any uploader like YIFY ..? i mean uploading High Resolution Movie at small size?"
