                    Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May  
                    attempt to find a trio of cars which are  
                    equally at home on the race track as they are  
                    transporting a family to the shops, for a  
                    budget of 5,000 pounds. Plus James makes a rare  
                    visit to the Top Gear track to test a pair of  
                    Porsches - the 911 Sport Classic and Boxster  
                    Spyder - and Alastair Campbell is the star in  
                    the all-new reasonably priced car.
