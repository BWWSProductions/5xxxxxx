,djdlux2005,2010-07-08T05:28Z,"Downloading for the purpose to make money off of it by sharing it?   yeah.....bet your ass your IP address is being tracked.  The Purpose of this site (for me, anyway) is to view movies to see whether or not they are crap before I purchase them on blue-ray or DVD.  Being a 100% disabled combat veteran, I don;t have hundreds of dollars to throw at junk movies and going to the theaters is out of the question for me.  Thank goodness for P2P sites like this and kind people like TvTeam that spend the time uploading movies so people like me can SAVE some dollars by weeding out the junk and giving me the opportunity to own a better caliber movie collection without filling my trashcan with crappy DVD s.

You can see Will Smith's acting style/attitude show through his son's acting.  Though no where near Oscar winning, I'm sure he'll be a great actor one day.  This movie was pretty good.  Not the best by far, but I might buy it to add to my K.K. collection (though this one should be Kung-Fu Kid.  It's worth screening though if you have some free time.

Thanks for the Upload TvTeam!  I appreciate what you do, and hope people trying to make money off your ups get tossed away in a jail in the back woods of Peru!  Karma's a bitch!"
,divanshu,2010-07-09T21:55Z,thanks for the graet upload
,P0NY2000,2010-07-16T20:49Z,Not to bad for a quick watchnA:9nV:6
,lostspoil,2010-07-16T22:40Z,"@djdlux do you actually think that will smith is a good actor? ... and therefor are you actually expecting his son of a bitch to be a \""good actor\"" as well? nI don\'t get it..."
,lostspoil,2010-07-16T22:53Z,i just watched the trailer.. karate kid learns actually kung fu in china? and god this is the ugliest TV kid i\'ve ever seen... are there really ppl who want to watch this..

,audi_gal,2010-08-08T07:32Z,FYI: also no subtitles for non-speaking Chinese (Mandarin) ppl watching/downloading this
,benenya,2010-10-15T03:03Z,"Dude! djdlux2005, wah wah wah, if you really aren't a thief like everyone else (Mr. I just want to watch before I purchase) then get fucking netflix. It is dirt cheap, you can get any movie you want (Including bluray) anytime you want. Nobody gives a shit what your life story is or what crutch you lean on. We just want what the quality is A/V and that's about it, not a fucking fiction story on your ""life"" and ""values"" as a ""responsible"" thief. lmao Download your illegal movies and Shut the fuck up!"
,chaosishere84,2010-11-05T19:03Z,good upload.  im getting 1.9MB/second on the download.  thanks to all the seeders.  i will seed as long as i can
