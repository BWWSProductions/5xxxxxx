        There's tha devil running thru my blood...

        In a battered  trailer, deep in  the heart of  the Appalachian
        Mountains of West Virginia - where every man owns a gun and  a
        moonshine  still  -  abides living  legend  Jesco  White, "the
        dancing outlaw". As a boy, Lil' Jesco was in and out of reform
        school  and  the  insane  asylum  for  taking  drugs, stealing
        lighter fluid and for his wild behaviour.

        To keep him out of trouble, his daddy D-Ray taught him the art
        of Mountain  Dancing -  a frenzied  version of  tap dancing to
        wild  country banjo  music. After  his daddy's  murder at  the
        hands of a pair of drunken rednecks, the crazy but charismatic
        Jesco put on his daddy's  shoes and danced his way  around the
        country bars. It was  here that he met  the love of his  life,
        Cilla, who happened to be  twice his age and half  his height.
        The  odd couple  tried to  settle down,  but tortured  by the
        thought of his daddy's killers still at large, Jesco's  demons
        resurfaced. This is his story.
