Anyway, The Video and Audio are Both First rate.  It was well worth the wait for the slow download (I plan to seed, as well as buy my own deluxe copy with all the extras) 

Thanks!

It shows love, romance and the fight to be able to get married if they so wished. Robin Williams plays a blinder in this role. I've only seen this once on video  and now the chance to get it on DVD has been a goal of mine for ages and now I can watch it again, but on a dvd instead of video."
