All subs show the right characters (saved under the right Unicode ISO).
In the future if you find subs not showing the right characters do the following:
If the subs are muxed in mkv download & use "MKVextractGUI" to extract(demux) the subtitles from mkv, and "mkvmerge GUI" to mux back the edited/repaired sub in the mkv.
Download "Notepad++" (free): 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/ 
The sub you demuxed from mkv: Open and save as...ANSI !(Important!)
Right click on the sub/Open with nppIExplorerShell.exe (Notepad++ exe)/
click Encoding(upper part menu)/Character sets and chose the language ISO.
Click again on Encoding/then click on Convert to UTF-8 or Unicode Big
Indian/save as...srt. You're done with the encoding, now you can mux it back 
in the mkv with mkvmergeGUI, select the language & mux.

Those with Win 7 64 bit might have issues with playing back secondary or external audios & subs etc.
If k-lite pack(too complicated) not working try CCCP ( 
http://www.cccp-project.net/   ) 
using the same player (Media Player Classic).
When installing check "Enable Shell Extensions & Thumbnails (under Select Aditional Taskd Haali), check
Haali Media Splitter- Autoload VSFilter, VSFilter Subpicture Pre-Buffering & Re-Register Filters, the rest leave as it is. When finished open the player, click View/Options/PlaybackOutput/check Evr Costum & chose System Default under DirectShow Audio.
Under Internal Filters - Source Filters should be checked DirectShow Media, Matroska & MP4 & Transform Filters should have H264/AVC(DXVA) checked. When playing multiAudio & subtitles movie select audio by right-clicking on the screen/Audio, subtitles right-clicking on the Haali Media Splitter on the icon bottom right Task Bar.
Now I can even play even Blue-ray m2ts being able to switch between Audio tracks
 by clicking on the Haali Media Spliter on the task bar bottom right.

All my torrents are seeded. I regularly check back my older torrents and I will reseed where needed.
Most of us want only the English (usually) Audio so I got the secondary tracks separately (demuxed).
