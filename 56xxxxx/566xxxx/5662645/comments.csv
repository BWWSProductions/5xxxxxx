Sorry the initial seeding took so long.My internet connection mysteriously was down for 2 days.But your patience has paid off,it's on here now.
It is a brilliant DVD from James.Tim Booth at his best.
Please Seed as much as you can,I had a hell of a job getting this on here,lets keep it alive and pass it on to others.
Thanks,  PoliteMan"

We traveled 100's of miles for just a couple weekends together, I felt like a very lucky dog indeed.  So thanks for the up, and the memories from a decade ago.  I will seed for as long as possible.  Peace"
