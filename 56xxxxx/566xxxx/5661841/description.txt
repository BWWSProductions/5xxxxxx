In a rare extended interview, we speak to Michael Hastings, whose article in Rolling Stone magazine led to the firing of General Stanley McChrystal. Hastingsâ€™ piece quoted McChrystal and his aides making disparaging remarks about top administration officials, and exposed long-standing disagreements between civilian and military officials over the conduct of the war. The Senate confirmed General David Petraues as McChrystalâ€™s replacement on Wednesday, one day after McChrystal announced his retirement from the military on Tuesday after a 34-year career.

- Fmr. Marine, State Dept. Official Matthew Hoh is First U.S. Official to Resign Over Afghan War

At the time of resignation he was serving as the senior U.S. civilian in Zabul province on the Pakistani border. In his resignation letter Hoh wrote: "I have lost understanding of and confidence in the strategic purposes of the United Statesâ€™ presence in Afghanistan. I have doubts and reservations about our current strategy and planned future strategy, but my resignation is based not upon how we are pursuing this war, but why and to what end."
