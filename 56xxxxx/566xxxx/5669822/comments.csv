,Baz2017,2010-07-05T23:25Z,"Thanks for your feedback, Rajes and aquamosh :)"
,Baz2017,2010-07-06T13:15Z,"All available options shown in the screenshot, chess000master."
,splurgegun,2010-07-06T19:22Z,"Baz, will this work with the torrent you upped last week? (Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus RTM (x86) )"
,splurgegun,2010-07-06T20:58Z,"Baz, this worked with your previous torrent (build 4760). I wasn't sure whether to install with the setup.bat file or the setup.exe file.
I went with the .bat file, seamless, although I didn't get the option to deselect the apps I didn't want. nevermind.
Converted to KMS. thanks"
,Baz2017,2010-07-07T11:53Z,"Glad to hear that it did some good, splurgegun :)

You didn't have to start the setup using the .bat file since its no longer really a custom install. Anyways you can still add and remove features from your Office 2010.

sorry but i'm sort of a noob at torrents"
,kidmoggi,2010-09-08T03:10Z,"Sorry I understand how it should work, but when I open the folder, I can't access the activator. I just more files.  "
,BdeVil13,2010-09-08T04:33Z,In order to activate must i wait for the original 30 day grace period to end bcuz when i run option 1 it says error  code 0x4004F00C Error description: the software licensing service reported that the application is running within the valid grace period.
