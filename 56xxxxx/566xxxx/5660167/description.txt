*NOTE        :  This is a DVD-structure img file. You BURN/PLAY
                as a normal dvd-ripped image. The source is
                from a BD rip, and for those fools who say that
                its the same as xvid, listen and learn.
                BD rips often have a avg bitrate appox. 6900+
                So a rip from that kinda source, is BETTER
                quality than a retail dvd source (most times)


Enjoy, or not .. suit yourself;)   ..Bad Boys, Bad Boys.. Who u Gonna Call!

                 - Stop bitching and enjoy the movies instead.
