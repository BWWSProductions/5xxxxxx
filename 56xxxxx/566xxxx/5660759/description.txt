Kelis has always liked to collaborate with European dance producers, and itâ€™s one of the things that I really admire her for.

Artists like Kelly Rowland have started to mix with that crowd recently, but Kelis was doing it back in the day. A great example was her feature on Richard Xâ€™s Finest Dreams, which was a fantastic track.

Although Kelis is going down the dance route again on her upcoming album Flesh Tone, unfortunately Spaceship wonâ€™t be featured on it. And thatâ€™s a real shame as itâ€™s a cracking song, masterfully produced by electro house juggernaut Benny Benassi.

There is a small downside though, as this song also features that little creep apl.de.ap from the Black Eyed Peas. He doesnâ€™t manage to ruin it though, thanks to the wonderful versatility of Kelisâ€™s voice, who effortlessly delivers another fantastic performance.
