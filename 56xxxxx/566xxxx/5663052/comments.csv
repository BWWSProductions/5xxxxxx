Thanks for the Johnny Horton.  First time I've seen
this CD.  Nice sound.

We love oldies out here in cyber land.

,ddawg,2010-07-07T07:18Z,Thanks BeatleTom.  This one is a collectors CD.  I lucked out and got it for $10 (including shipping) I've seen it on Amazon and elsewhere priced at $90+.  I enjoyed sharing it with everyone. 
,ddawg,2010-07-07T07:21Z,FYI: If you get this one along with my other Johnny Horton torrent you'll have all the historial folk saga songs Horton made.
