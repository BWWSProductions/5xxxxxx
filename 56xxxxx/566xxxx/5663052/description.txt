Allmusic Review:
Anybody who knows Johnny Horton's music prefers his hard honky tonk and rockabilly tunes rather than his novelty hits. That said, even these have their place and Horton scored big with Tillman Franks' "Sink the Bismark" and Jimmie Driftwood's "Battle of New Orleans," and to a lesser degree, with Merle Kilgore's "Johnny Reb." This compilation of all Horton's novelty songs about historic events and gigantic and/or mythical figures is desirable if for no other than archival purposes. That said, most of this material is delightfully listenable with one or two misses in the bunch; the sound is pretty fair, and the price is most definitely right. 

Amazon Review:
Here are 12 songs that are truly entertaining and educational. This album was originally released just a few short months before Johnny was killed in a head on collision. The music has held up quite well through the years and sounds better than ever on cd.
