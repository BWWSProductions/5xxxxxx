         Adventurers Marcus, Stephen and Bill set out to boat the      
         entire length of the Mississippi River in September. Things   
         take a turn for the worse when the rough river bottom         
         damages the jet, leaving the guys stranded in the middle      
         of nowhere without cell service and with a Minnesota winter   
          storm on the horizon.
