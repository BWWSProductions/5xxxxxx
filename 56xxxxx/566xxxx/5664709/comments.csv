You can create walls free-hand but you can't easily resize them on the spot, instead you have to click another section of wall adjacent to it, then your able the resize it, but when you do so, it resizes another section of wall you don't want to resize at all, to make up for the difference, instead of stretching it.. And there's no way to ""Lock"" sections of wall that the program can't alter it.
