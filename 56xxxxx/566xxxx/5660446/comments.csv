,PatRicK_BeNetaR,2010-07-02T17:47Z,"Just tested my old version on win 7 ultimate 64bit, still works perfectly, 13 years later, although the installer probably doesn't work in 64bit o/s.
This has been ripped before & bundled with an installer, but I for one would like to see a version by you devastate, especially if you can make it smaller, it works without being installed."
,PatRicK_BeNetaR,2010-07-02T17:55Z,"For anyone having trouble getting this to work, the screen will come out garbled on any modern system when you load it, but press the windows key or alt-tab out of the screen, and then go back in to the game & it works perfectly on any system.
Although it is a little too pixellated being so old & having a small resolution. Nobody has fixed ever fixed either of these problems for BR, that I know of, but it would be great if someone would, an old classic."
,Erocy,2010-07-03T01:49Z,a rip would be rele cool

,Monolove,2012-02-07T12:17Z,"Haven't tried this yet, but there is a 64-bit installer here: http://www.davidmillington.net/news/index.php/2008/03/26/blade_runner_game_vista_64

it's designed for the 4-disc version but might work with the dvd. i own the 4-disc version but it's located in a storage facility so i can't access it at the moment. if the installer isn't compatible with this torrent i might consider digging up the old 4-disc box and put it up here. "
,Monolove,2012-02-08T12:31Z,"tested out the fix:
http://www.davidmillington.net/news/index.php/2008/03/26/blade_runner_game_vista_64

it works but you have to create a ""save"" folder in the install folder for saving to work. if you don't you get a message: ""error saving"" when you try to save. i don't know if you can compile the save file in the installer but it's not a big deal."
,heroindog,2012-04-06T21:08Z,anyone got this working on a mac?
