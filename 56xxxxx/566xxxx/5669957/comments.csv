,piratebaysux,2010-07-05T17:13Z,"Love your work Slick. Shame about the SPEED source. Really sucks. But your work is great. SPEED  is so sucky! I mean really! Who else thinks the same? SPEED have lost the plot. Mindless bimbos, only one race, and useless bullshit. Show me the races and nothing else. I will be happy. Great work Slick. Sorry for the rant, but SPEED is really pissing me off!"
,slicknick610,2010-07-05T18:05Z,Yeah Jeffro I have the 07 TGO. I didnt create it myself i downloaded it. I will post it after the 250 race has a bunch of seeds. I should be posting the 250 race in about an hour and a half.

,slicknick610,2010-07-06T04:42Z,yeah it was awesome. I wish all the 450 riders were there. A lot were out with injuries. I also hope Grant Langston is okay. He crashed pretty hard on the last lap. He was holding his leg. They didnt catch it on tv.

,slicknick610,2010-07-18T22:42Z,It has to air on tv first. You should check the tv schedule before you ask. The 250 race just started on tv and the 450 race is after it.
,yoker36,2010-07-19T17:28Z,"sry, im to exited now when it have been a break :P"
