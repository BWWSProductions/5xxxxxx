Part of a History Channel special on spree killers featuring the Manson Family murders (also known as the Tate-LaBianca murders). Among the people interviewed for this show are prosecutors Vincent Bugliosi and Stephen Kay and Roman Polanski.

It's worthwhile watching for the Polanski interview, the rest is a rehash of things we've seen and heard before. The footage has been transferred from VHS so the quality is far from perfect.
