,taloncg,2010-07-19T10:03Z,All works great except for one issue. I'm having a problem getting the campaigns to work. Click on it and the list where they should be is empty. Try to start a new one or continue and a stack trace back error message pops up. Any ideas?
,Skyrat70,2010-07-19T16:29Z,"taloncg, I had same issue.  Just go to your install directory... \LockOn Flaming Cliffs 2\Missions\Campaigns\LOP and change \en to \ru.  That worked for me.  Good luck!"
,F900,2010-07-20T20:20Z,"what am I doing wrong.

,Jeromy66,2010-07-21T00:02Z,I installed FC2 however when i go into the controls menu I can't apply assignments to many of the keyboard commands. Could someone help me out?
,Skyrat70,2010-07-21T02:30Z,"Hey, just ran down (ok it's like 65 miles round trip) to Best Buy and picked-up Lock-On Platinum for $19.99. Hard to justify all these headaches with cracks and such now that it's out in retail stores, and at such a good price. Of course I only can speak for US stores. "
,Weismans,2010-08-01T04:40Z,"Great torrent, just finished downloading and haven't been able to stop playing since. Will seed a shitload. :)

Note that multiplayer hasn't worked for me, failed with some 'integrity check failed' error, not sure if its a problem with this release or just the server I tried to join."
,theflyboy,2010-08-14T10:06Z,"i have the same problem as F900.

,ivy77brace,2010-11-09T23:28Z,"lock on 1.1 not found mean that u don't have the: ""Lock on: Modern air combat"" installed on your pc. It's a must because ""Lock on: Flaming cliffs 2.0"" is not a stand-alone. "
,Anxax,2011-02-06T22:03Z,"Lord, give me this game! Where are the seeds?"
