I burned cue image to disk, installed fine on windows 7, but cannot copy patch from disk to install directory cause it says CD is a read only.  I tried running the patch and it errors saying that ""windows cannot open the specified path, device, or file, you may not have appropriate permissions ect.  I tried running as administrator too with the same error.  Anyone have any luck with this and windows 7??"
,jeff_hudson,2010-08-06T06:01Z,okay sounds like if you are current with vista or windows 7 don't even bother cause you can't use the patch.exe file.  Only works with XP.
,rhoyourboad,2010-08-13T05:57Z,Still need a working 2010 QB with patch for US?  let me know.  I'm looking for QB 2010 Canadian version.  help would be great.
,LenaIsAPirate,2010-08-17T04:02Z,"@jeff_hudson you're wrong this works on Vista/Win7. Just install like it is, input keygen, put patch in C:\Program Files (x86)\Intuit\QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 10.0, run patch as administrator (aka right click the patch then click run as admin)  and when you update run the patch again works perfectly. Thanks! Great torrent. Also scanned with Nod32 it's clean."

thanks its working now...! :)"
,DonGives,2011-03-20T08:43Z,Please someone confirm if the keygen and patch are safe. My antivirus is deleting them. I also submitted them to virustotal.com and they're detected as malaware by almost all security software.
,DonGives,2011-03-21T08:06Z,"Keygen.exe seems to work, but also creates the trojan wareg51.exe

The patch.exe seems clean, but still picked up as a trojan by security programs."
,bznssolutions,2011-05-03T04:15Z,"Hi
