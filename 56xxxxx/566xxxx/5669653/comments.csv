,alarik_2,2010-11-05T17:12Z,"Hi there. I've never reviewed someone's work here before, at least not as I can recall, and just wanted to say thanks for a good job!

However, since someone posted a link to another torrent from user ""ALLiANCE"", I took the time to compare them and the other one actually seems to be slightly better in resolution. No major difference though on a 17"" screen.

Anyway, thanks to everyone who post these great torrents here!"
