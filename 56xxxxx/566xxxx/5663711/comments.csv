,112488,2010-07-02T11:04Z,ok so i just finished downloading this torrent. as far as this being Nightmate on elmstreet. Part of that is true. For some reason the first 3 mins an 30 seconds is nightmare on elmstreet but the rest o the movie is twlight eclipse. The video is about a 6 and the audio is about 4 due to the loudness which brings distortion of the audio...yet this is the only english release and if you are impatient to see it i would suggest this one if you cannot wait the few days for the TS version.
,leannedol,2010-07-02T11:17Z,i saw eclipse at the pics at that is how it starts
,112488,2010-07-02T11:25Z,"I am glad to have cleared
that up for you =). and thank you for being one of the first to have this in english!"
,Schlopy,2010-07-02T11:28Z,Video is soso but audio is terrible

,GreenBuck,2010-07-02T15:07Z,hey guys can anyone see a difference in this one and the other eclipse torrent thanks
,Whogivzafk,2010-07-02T18:44Z,"@Greenbuck -all the english ones look the same. First min. or so looks like another movie but it's real.
It's NOT the same v source as Russian/Italian. "
,SimplyBen,2010-07-02T19:41Z,"@predictorrin No actually the quality seems to be severely downgraded. You sir, are a simpleton shitferbrains twat sucker. Don't try to say you use that lame shit regularly, unless that's all the spyware on your computer typing for you.. I call wrinkly ballsack on you."
,rappling,2010-07-03T09:44Z,"I dl'd this one and a couple 1.41 gig cams, and I scanned through them both, and they seemed pretty much the same. I don't really do a 1-10 rating of anything, for me its more just whether I can watch and understand (see and hear) whats going on. This is for sure watchable, no 1080p or IMAX, but very watchable."
,rappling,2010-07-03T09:50Z,"Oh and yes the base is bad, don't expect to put this up on the big screen and blast it. Put on some headphones/turn your base down, and enjoy. To all of you complaining about your surround sound, its a fucking cam! DAMN!"
,rappling,2010-07-03T10:32Z,"from your spelling, I highly doubt that, or you need to update your translation software."
