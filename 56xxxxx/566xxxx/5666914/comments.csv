,SadDino,2011-06-21T19:15Z,"I just wanted to let you know that Good Apollo doesn't work on my computer. It might be my computer specifically, but I think it's the files on the torrent itself. Everything else is perfect though, if you want Good Apollo there's another good torrent of it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3425998/Coheed_and_Cambria_-_Graphic_Novels_1_2"
