,purgations,2011-06-03T06:13Z,yet why does it show up as a vlc file.. there is no description on how to burn or nothing... not a very good torrent
,a1s,2011-07-20T16:27Z,"It's not a .vlc file... There are 2 files, and the one you want is the .bin file. just mount it with pretty much any tool (Demon, Alcohol, VirtualCD, etc.) and it will play.

hope this helps."
