The best acoustic drinking band! Hailing from Pasadena, Maryland. Sounds like "The music you wanna listen to on a long drive from work, The kinda music you wanna listen to on a hot summer night near the fire with your favorite girl and 40, its the kinda music for everyone...thugs...gangstaz...hippies....skate kids....punk rockers.....and....ofcourse you also. "

"Started in Pasadena, Maryland by Joey Harkum and Ben Cowdery they have since been joined by Aaron Hooper and later Will Finley on guitar to form Pasadena a 4 peice outfit combining acoustic rock with hip-hop influenced lyrics and a sweet laid-back beat (thanks to Mr Woo) followed by smooth flowing bass lines. Pasadena is a fresh breath of music in the baltimore/washington area so go check them out bitches."

Torrent includes their most recently released album "Sick and Tired" along with 2 miscellaneous albums I received for free @ their shows in the past.
