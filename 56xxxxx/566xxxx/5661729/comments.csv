,tranceg,2010-07-01T15:42Z,"Sorry guys, seeding will be slow until more people start seeding, as I only have 100-200KB/s (2Mbps) upload available. Please seed this torrent as it is a quality release."
,tranceg,2010-07-01T20:06Z,"The only thing I've found so far that didn't work is the Warpath expansion. That's due to a communication issue in the original torrent that included that. If Tanauser would like to verify where exactly the nations folder should be copied to, then I can update the instructions to reflect the correct location."
,tranceg,2010-07-01T20:07Z,"Played for about 6 hours so far, no crashes as of yet, great game :D I'll let it seed for a few days straight so that others can get it seeding also, please keep a 1.5 upload ratio, this ensures that the file stays available."
,Alsn,2010-07-01T20:25Z,I was under the impression that razor hadn't actually released an update for 1.6? How did you manage to find that?
,tranceg,2010-07-02T02:25Z,"The 1.6 update is provided by Tanauser from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5572096/Empire_total_war_Patch5 . The menu still says it's version 1.5, however from what I've gathered, that's just a side effect of Tanauser's patch."
,Baughn,2010-07-03T00:06Z,"Obviously, we're currently without a seed.

If that's fixed, I'll keep seeding this for at least a week or two - plenty of bandwidth here, free for the taking."
,tranceg,2010-07-03T20:36Z,"Sorry guys, had to close uTorrent for a bit yesterday as it was slowing my internet connection down significantly, and I needed it at the time, should be seeding again, I'll let it seed till I see a few more seeders enter the mix. My router has issues with torrents and locks up, otherwise I'd leave it seeding for a month or so."
,tranceg,2010-07-03T20:37Z,"BTW, the ratio is at 0.892 currently, so we should see some seeders show up tonight."
,tranceg,2010-07-03T21:39Z,"Also, I found the trick to the Warpath campaign. The natives folder needs to be copied to the main installation directory, I'll update the instructions."
,tranceg,2010-07-04T02:01Z,"Sorry guys, had to pause uTorrent again so steam will download Rome: Total War :P. I've got it set on a schedule this time. Seeding will automatically resume at midnight EST."
,Alindiel,2010-07-05T06:10Z,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEED
,welshie96,2010-07-06T22:03Z,"Really need some seeders, atm got none!"
,welshie96,2010-07-07T22:23Z,"If you can, seed for a few more days please!?
I've downloaded just under 75% and now cannot download the rest without a seeder!"
,Korrupt3d--,2010-07-09T20:40Z,anybody actually want to seed? I\'ve been stuck at 84.5% for 3 days now.
,tranceg,2010-07-10T01:27Z,"The problem is there\'s only one person who can seed, and that\'s me. Sorry guys, my upload is extremely slow, and torrents fuck my router up causing the internet not to work. I can only seed at night, will seed tonight and un-cap the upload, should hit about 200KB/s. I wish there was a way for uTorrent to upload to the most promising seeders first, such as those who have faster upload, or those who have more of the file. Would help a lot with torrents."
,Korrupt3d--,2010-07-10T08:03Z,"If you could somehow send me the rest of the files, I can leave my computer on for the next few days for everyone to seed all day. I have absolutely no problem with it, I just dont want people trying to hack me because I\'m being nice."
,fordrew,2010-07-10T20:49Z,"******** THIS TORRENT IS NUKED AS OF JULY 10, 2010 ************** rnrnDONT DOWNLOAD AS YOU WILL BE STUCK AT ~87%"
,tranceg,2010-07-14T05:29Z,"This torrent is not nuked, currently there are 3 seeders. Just because TPB doesn\'t show them on the torrent page doesn\'t mean there aren\'t any. TPB doesn\'t list DHT for one if i\'m not mistaken. Even still, uTorrent shows 3 seeders, so it\'s not nuked."
,tranceg,2010-07-14T05:30Z,"Also, I know this isn\'t the right place, but the admins of TPB may want to get rid of the audio ads. They\'re extremely annoying, and they\'re the reason I have AdBlock enabled for TPB. I understand you need to make money, but irritating the piss out of me isn\'t going to get me to click the fucking ad."
,fordrew,2010-07-17T15:10Z,this torrent is nuked you idiot. nnDon\'t put up a torrent if you can\'t handle the load.
,Jaxsin,2010-07-18T15:19Z,DEAD AT 93% NUKED
,tranceg,2010-07-19T16:32Z,"Not a problem, idiot. From now on, I'll just keep the information and resulting crack to myself, rather than share it with the community, idiot. Happy now, idiot?"
,tranceg,2010-07-19T16:34Z,"Also, idiots. I see 7 seeders currently available, idiots. Just because TPB doesn't show seeders doesn't mean there aren't any, idiots. TPB doesn't show DHT results, idiots."
,tranceg,2010-07-19T16:38Z,"Amazing how thankful people are when you post a torrent that helps other idiots who are too clueless to find the information and crack a program that doesn't have a proper release available. And you ignorant fuckers wonder why the scene has died? You wonder why nobody bothers posting proper releases anymore? They're sick of fuck heads like you bitching and moaning because you can't figure it out, or because you can't get it to download at 2MB/s. It's free fucktard, if you want it now and don't want to go through the bullshit of cracking it, pay for the fucker."
,Prussian_Fanboy,2010-07-19T16:47Z,"No need for so much rage tranceg not everyone complaining.

Also it just moved out of the 93,0% for most thanks to the seeders. "
,Jaxsin,2010-07-19T18:08Z,For having 7 seeders I've been stuck at 93% for almost 5 days and haven't once got access to download off the seeders now oh sorry it moved to 93.2% lol keep it to yourself then your shite at uploading anyway oh and btw its got nothing to do with not getting good speeds its about getting no speeds atall once you hit the same as everyone elses 93.2%
,Jaxsin,2010-07-19T18:13Z,oh and btw I've already got the full game of empire just wanted to see if the DLC was worth getting before I did but now its only 7.99 at GAME or Game.co.uk thanks anyway ye WANKER
,Prussian_Fanboy,2010-07-19T20:17Z,"hm Jaxsin the part with the patches and probably the DLC are already over by 80% probably much sooner than that even. 

Also this is only a hunch but I think the 11.89 Gb ETW torrent down there may be able to work with this one so getting the ISOs from that other torrent and the patches from this one should work.

But as I said its just a hunch."
,Prussian_Fanboy,2010-07-19T20:26Z,"I tested it the other torrent I mentioned uses the same ISOs as in this one so if you get stuck you can get this torrent

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4750077/Empire_Total_War_Special_Forces_Edition-Razor1911.iso

to finish it.

I still didn't finish downloading but it really seems it will work.

I recommend seeding this one though because it comes with the DLC and Patches so for one getting ETW the first time its bound to be better."
,tranceg,2010-07-19T20:55Z,"I'm using uTorrent, and I see 2 seeders at this exact moment. It will go up and down throughout the day. I upload when I can, which is not during the day as my neighbor uses my internet also, and I'm more apt to make sure his internet connection is working, than I am to make sure the torrent gets uploaded as fast as possible. Also, as previously stated, all of the files in this torrent can be acquired from other torrents. I just found it a bit tough to find those torrents, and get the instructions in them correct, so that it works properly. I can't be arsed to find the torrents again, so no point asking. Another thing a few of you seem to forget here, is I'm not obligated to share the contents. I do so of my own free will, I reap no benefits from doing so, therefore telling me not to upload the torrent if I can't get it fully seeded in the time you like is pure stupidity. Keep saying that, and you'll find that less and less torrents get posted. It's ignorant fuckers like you that kill the scene. You have no respect, and are the fools who download the torrent and stop seeding it as soon as it's finished. As far as I'm concerned, you can go fuck yourself, because you aren't going to help seed it anyway, and have no right to bitch at me for not doing so when you want."
,Jaxsin,2010-07-20T17:02Z,"I will actually post up that this is now working with alot of seeds to be honest personally I haven't tested it because I already have the full game and just bought the DLC yestarday cause it was only 7.99 for all of them so no lose if it is shite but just noticed in my torrents that it was fully downloaded and seeding 

tranceg
I really couldn't care if the torrent scene goes down to be 100% honest I hope it does before I go into software development but sorry to tell you its never going to go away. I purchase all my games as I like to play online and can't when I download the games, I only download DLC cause they are 80% of the time shite and don't like wasting the money so like to test them first, its only tv shows I download alot oh and yeah I seed everything I download as I have my Utorrent open automatically on startup I leave all torrents started so it will always seed I don't like to be a dick but you seem like a right spastic so please stop uploading then I beg you to stop it I wouldn't be arsed to listen to you in the future if I do need to download something again.

,0username0,2010-07-21T03:43Z,"So how is this with CTD, bunker hill crash, movie stutters, missing gun sounds?"
,Prussian_Fanboy,2010-07-21T13:35Z,"It seems to be working fine here, the movies lag a bit but its probably my computer."
,wallboy90,2010-07-23T21:49Z,"i try to start the game up it gives me an error message that steam_api.dll was not found, any ideas on fixing it?"
,tranceg,2010-07-24T00:11Z,"I believe you need to have steam installed to use this game. Wallboy90, if you don't have steam installed, install it, that should fix the error."
,Prussian_Fanboy,2010-07-24T09:50Z,"I don't think you need steam, I just followed the instructions on the readme and it worked fine."
,wallboy90,2010-07-24T10:18Z,"nope, didnt work, i also tried to find and put a steam_api.dll in the directory but i got a new error message, SteamAPI_SetMiniDumpComment could not be located in the dynamic link library steam_api.dll. any ideas on what to do now?"
,wallboy90,2010-07-24T10:43Z,also when i run install.redist is it supposed to directx and not the actual game or is it just me
,Prussian_Fanboy,2010-07-24T21:22Z,"How much does the Empire.exe on the ETW folder weights? maybe you forgot to put the crack after updating.

And yes I believe its supposed to run DirectX on that install."
,tranceg,2010-07-27T09:45Z,"Yes, it updates the DirectX assemblies for the game if I'm not mistaken. As far as the steam_api.dll issue, this > pastebin.com/f16096c6d , says ""Download the file 2shared.com/file/5018857/6c042181/steam_api.html . Copy the file directly to the Empire Total War folder."""
,tranceg,2010-07-27T09:47Z,"So odds are, you mixed up one of the crack steps, or this is required on your system for some unknown reason. I would check again to make sure you copied the cracks correctly, ie: copy them all again, no need to re-install. Then if that doesn't work I would download the file stated above and put it in your ETW install directory."

,hakah,2010-08-05T04:13Z,I found these riddled with viruses.

everything else runs fine just this strange texture glitch."
,tranceg,2010-08-16T20:43Z,"Try changing the graphics settings, see if that gets rid of the GUI glitch. It might be a particular setting that your graphics card doesn't like. This is the fully updated version of Empire: Total War, so there may be a setting in this one that's not in others, as there are no other torrents that I'm aware of that are fully updated."

Later it doesn't want to install first patch and says 'ETW not war'. So I did step 6 and then run step 5 file. It worked. Next pacth good. Last patch says, after long search, that it cant find file Empire total war or something like that. I think that one patch is no problem for me so i copied folder 5, deleted rzr-*.exe and there is no install.redist.cmd. I think screw it, and try to play the game. It says no tbb.dll file. I downloaded it, but now game crashes on the first  black screen with white letter and signs Total war. Is there any solution of my problem ??? I tried to install 3 times and still the same.

,xXRuhaniXx,2011-03-14T00:36Z,"Seems like Razor 1911 fucked us all over with this release of ETW. I was primarily disappointed after installing/reinstalling this about 4 - 5 times to no avail, with Empire Total War starting up and crashing around the first screen to the desktop. Said problem is produced by an APPCRASH error, and I'm using Windows 7. You'll probably experience the same using Windows Vista. That being said, I do not recommend this torrent for anybody with very little patience for installation procedures that seem far too elaborate than what they need to be.

Kaos's Full Rip works fine, except for a few nuances in the Independence Campaign, it won't have you go through all this garbage just so you can crash constantly.

,SawyerDaLawyer,2011-03-20T17:25Z,Hey I can only find the native folder for the Warpath Campaign in the install dir. But can't find the one im suppose to copy paste. Other than that if you follow the steps it works fine...and it's not really that confusing.
,Dicksmoker,2011-03-21T23:31Z,The game doesn't install. I've followed steps 1-3 to the letter twice and when it's over (a short amount of time) the install directory is only 2.01 MB. And of course it doesn't show up in the programs list. What is this shit?
,Angerfist_DJ,2011-04-05T16:17Z,"It installs perfectly!
I used daemon tools lite.

,davidpauls,2011-04-17T13:03Z,"Icemen i think you should put the Empire .exe on 1 to the Install then you patch .. so that the Patch can be done ... ok ? ,if this doesnt work ... then use Empire.exe on 1 again then patch it all though 3 .... then replace it with Empire .exe at 5 ..dont forget to put the Config files and data files at install .. also at the files of 5 "
,Iceman63172,2011-04-18T06:31Z,"davidpauls, tried that as well to no avail. I've tried 6 times now to install it but I keep getting the same dll file error. any more ideas? I'd rather not have to dl another torrent as this one took forever on my crappy connection."

The process involved downloading 3 or 4 different torrents and following half broken instructions. If this is still too complicated for you, then buy the game and gtfo."

The game crashes at irregular occasions, it totally ruins the game for me. Yet this is the only torrent that seems to be updated. Does anyone know what to do about it?

Ah hell, I guess I'll just have to buy the game... I just hope this error is only with this cracked version, and not with the original game. :s"

,MarcMrNice,2011-07-31T12:23Z,I've been playing for a few days but now halfway through a campaign my save game loads and crashes soon after. anyone know how to fix this. Otherwise been a great torrent so far!
,MarcMrNice,2011-07-31T12:30Z,Can I please just add that the installation of this game is easy as long as you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS word for word. I made the mistake 1st time of thinking I knew better and fuck'd it up. Then I re-installed and FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS word for word and I've been playing it for a good few days now. Learn to read or learn to FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS you retards and stop hassling people who are kind enough and clever enough to offer you free shit. It's morons like you that stop decent uploaders uploading decent shit! Wasters!
,Banzay27,2011-08-06T18:36Z,"Good download. Following the uploader's instructions to the letter lands a flawless installation.

The game's not worth it, however. Here I came disappointed with Shogun 2 only to feel a greater disappointment. True, a reason for it really is due to Empire being older. The firearm shooting had no feel, whereas it was still enjoyable in Shogun 2. But I played Medieval 2 and I remember it as a better game than either of these. Ironically, Empire is definitely the worst Total War experience for me and I happen to like the volleys of musket fire more than melee combat or arrow volleys. Same goes for the cannon fire in naval warfare. The broadside shooting here was minimally fun, but battles are overall so uncanny that it obscure any sense of entertainment.

Bottom line, I'm not so surprised there's not more proper torrents for this around. Not regretful I tried; now I've gotten it out of my system. Napoleon's next though I don't even half expect it not to disappoint."
,biliev1,2011-08-30T18:07Z,Does this version still have that copyright protection bug-thingy that makes it crash at or after turn 80?  Last time I downloaded empire from here/another dwnload I was well into the campaign and then it started crashing around that turn?  Has that been fixed or is this still lurking in there somewhere?  Please help with an answer.  
,Unit431,2011-09-09T10:37Z,"As mentioned above the base game is bland, though it's drastically improved with a mod called ""DarthMod Ultimate Commander Edition"". It makes a huge number of changes to the game and is analogous in scope to the hugely popular Stainless Steel mod for Medieval 2."
,Toho1989,2011-09-10T02:20Z,"there is something terribly wrong with the installation. i followed the instructions to the letter, i believe the problem might be a corruption. during the installation it asks for the cd parts and i route it back to the roote as instructed but there are 6 of these cds that need to be routed in DVD1 however the installer only asks for for CD zero and ignores the other 5, repeat the same process with the all the other cds in DVD2. the installation is flawed, if anyone is actually playing this game do you mind telling us how you fixed the installer?"

 It locked up on me during the land tutorial so I am uninstalling this. Not sure if it will lock up during normal game play but Its not worth the headache.  Napoleon Total War Razor installs much easier and runs smooth.  Same play style so if your just looking to try this type of game get that instead.  If your a die hard fan...good luck with this copy.
