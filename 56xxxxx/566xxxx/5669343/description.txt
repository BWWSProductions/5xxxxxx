he A-OKs are a ska/punk/partycore band from Denver, CO. We started out in 2008 playing dive bars and dilapidated venues to our friends and small handfuls of punk kids for nothing more than a little exposure. Since weâ€™ve started, weâ€™ve grown to open for big name acts such as The Phenomenauts, Chase Long Beach, Mustard Plug, Big D and the Kids Table, Fishbone, and Assorted Jelly Beans. Our horn section has even had the honor of playing alongside The Aquabats for a live rendition of â€œSuper Radâ€ at 2009â€™s D-Town Skankdown. 

We are best known for our ridiculous, energetic, chaos-fueled live shows. The crowd is encouraged to participate in any way possible and the band often leaves the stage to mosh, dance, and play in the pit. No stage is the same after an A-OKs set.

Last year, we completed a west coast tour and have a second tour planned June 2010. It will be a cavalcade of crazy shows in New Mexico, Las Vegas, Utah, Arizona, all leading to the craziest show of all at the Ska in the Park festival in Pamona, California.
