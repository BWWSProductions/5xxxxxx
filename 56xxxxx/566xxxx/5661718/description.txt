Gerry & the Pacemakers were a British rock and roll group prominent during the 1960s. In
common with The Beatles, they came from Liverpool and were managed by Brian Epstein. They
are most remembered for being the first act to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart with
their first three single releases. It was a record that was not equalled for 20 years, until
the mid-80s success of fellow Liverpool band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Gerry & the
Pacemakers are the second most successful group from Liverpool to hit the US pop charts
behind the Beatles. (Wiki)
