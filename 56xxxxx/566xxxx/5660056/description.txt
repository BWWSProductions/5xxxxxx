Foghat has been on the oldies circuit so long that the appearance of a new album is a bit of a surprise -- and itâ€™s even more so when itâ€™s an outright blues album, as it is in 2010â€™s Last Train Home, their first new record in seven years. Fittingly for veterans of the arena rock â€˜70s, Foghatâ€™s blues are heavily steeped in the British Invasionâ€™s version of the blues -- theyâ€™re long on amplification and extended jams, as should be expected for a band who is an outgrowth of Savoy Brown -- but their roots dig deeper, as evidenced by two good cuts with Eddie Kirkland at the end of the record. Foghat donâ€™t reinvent these songs, but they do play with a considerable amount of energy and a precision that only a veteran touring band could have, making this a nice little surprise for hardcore fans. ~Stephen Thomas Erlewine
