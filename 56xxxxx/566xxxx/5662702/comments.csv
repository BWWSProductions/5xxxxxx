,Jointless,2010-09-24T23:37Z,"i dont have that wow 6432 map in my regkey, 
can someone help me with this?
running game on win xp"
,lilmikey,2010-09-25T15:14Z,"Ok, so on my system, the KEY is in:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Bohemia Interactive Studios/ARMA 2 OA

The TEG_BINARY is called KEY and has this value provided by solidwork:


86,0f,39,40,26,aa,1d,e6,d4,ea,8d,2f,5c,e8,c8

So, I installed the game from a virtual drive by Deamon Tools Lite, then changed the key to the above, and succesfully patched it.

NOW when I start the game it asks me for the original disk.

So I installed VirtualCD10, downloaded the right mini-iso (vc4 file called NS-A2OA_SR-poseden.vc4 which is a VirtualCD iso) from gamescopyworld

when I mount it to a physical drive, and start the game, it doesn't ask me about the cd anymore. Instead, it starts to process the mini-iso and basically hangs up the computer (it feels like a memory leakage). The same happens when I try to open the mini-iso from MY COMPUTER or when I try to access the properties of the drive, etc.

I have two drives and it's the same situation for both.

I can't play the game on cracks as it CTD all the time (when i click on skirmish or a few minutes into campaign).

turning NORTON off doesn't help.

,Unit431,2010-09-26T07:28Z,"lilmikey, it must have been a specific problem with your PC. Using solidwork's key in conjunction with the mini image in Virtual CD works perfectly for me."
,Unit431,2010-09-26T07:38Z,"Jointless and others having problems :

1) Install the game using the instructions in blackbke's post.

2) Modify the registry as such :

32Bit Windows users, past the following into a file called regkey.reg and merge the file with your registry :

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bohemia Interactive Studio\ArmA 2 OA]
""KEY""=hex:86,0f,39,40,26,aa,1d,e6,d4,ea,8d,2f,5c,e8,c8""

64Bit Windows users, past the following into a file called regkey.reg and merge the file with your registry :

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Bohemia Interactive Studio\ArmA 2 OA]
""KEY""=hex:86,0f,39,40,26,aa,1d,e6,d4,ea,8d,2f,5c,e8,c8""

The only difference between them is that 64bit Windows places software entries under ""Wow6432Node"".

3) Patch the game. Continue to use blackbke's method of mounting the mini image to your physical drive using Virtual CD.

It works flawlessly on my end with no crashes after hours of play. I can finally use the latest version of ACE as well :D"

,3qf7yo,2010-12-07T23:51Z,"Use a little google-fu to find blackbke's post (use google cache).

Anyway, here it is:

""My first post ever here. No matter what you've read here, this download works. It even works without using any crack. This is how:

1. Mount ISO and install (serial: 018J-097RH-LXEK6-DW98R-8M5B5)
2. Download latest patch from arma2.com and install
3. Download and install Virtual CD 10 (Daemon Tools won't do)
4. Go to Gamecopyworld.com, look for Arma2 Arrowhead and download the mini image for Virtual CD (NOT the Daemon Tools one)
6. Mount the mini image to your PHYSICAL CD/DVD/Bluray drive with Virtual CD

Yes that's right, your physical drive, not a virtual one because Securom will detect it and refuse to start the game. If you mount it to your physical drive it works, and you can play the game as if you bought it (ofc no multiplayer). No cracks, no viruses, no crashes, no Fade kicking in.

If your game still crashes, there's just something wrong with your computer. This download is just fine.

1) Install the game using the instructions in blackbke's post.

2) Modify the registry as such :

32Bit Windows users, past the following into a file called regkey.reg and merge the file with your registry :

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bohemia Interactive Studio\ArmA 2 OA]

,Rudy_Eila,2010-12-26T17:40Z,"for those who are getting a ""wrong CD key"" message do the following exactly!

1. Create a new notepad file.
2. Paste the following message into it:

""KEY""=hex:86,0f,39,40,26,aa,1d,e6,d4,ea,8d,2f,5c,e8,c8

3. Name it regkey.reg
4. Patch the game :)

I tried to copy the message with it but it didn't work, I tried without it and it worked."
,paerchu,2011-01-02T17:13Z,"""EDIT: Okay I got the game to work it was a strange problem with steams installing the game. Apparently OA has no ""KEY"" binary code inside of it. For future reference I made a step guide for anyone else who gets this error and it might just help the situation more. Also 90% of the credit goes to the steam help support. This is easier for Combined Operations. 

STEP 1:
First go to START> RUN

STEP 2: Type ""regedit"" (picture below)
http://img826.imageshack.us/img826/7269/step1a.jpg

STEP 3: Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and look for the folder called ""wow6432node"" (Picture Below)
http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/8136/step2t.jpg

STEP 4: Click ""wow6432node"" and locate the folder ""Bohemia Interactive Studio"" there you will see the ArmA folders. (PLEASE VIEW Picture Below)
http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/4053/step3k.jpg

Step 5: After viewing the picture above you'll need to edit the binary of the key to do so view the picture below (MAKE SURE YOU SELECT ALL or whatever you can select THE BINARY INSIDE OF IT! EVEN THE GIBBERISH!)
http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/9475/step4xz.jpg""

INSTEAD OF COPYING ARMA 2 KEY - DOUBLE CLICK THE KEY AND RIGHTCLICK - SELECT ALL, DELETE EVERYTHING AND THEN TYPE THESE VALUES:

86,0f,39,40,26,aa,1d,e6,d4,ea,8d,2f,5c,e8,c8

NO COMMAS.

THIS SHOULD WORK IF REGKEY.REG WONT WORK. :)
