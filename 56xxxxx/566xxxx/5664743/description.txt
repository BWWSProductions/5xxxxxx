It is love at first sight between professor's daughter Franziska and Michael, a roving reporter. The story begins in 1932 and ends during the second world war. The couple's love goes from one farewell to the next. Michael is always going somewhere to film world envents for his agency: accidents, natural desasters, and wars. Franziska stays at home in a picturesque little town, entirely alone at first, then alone with their two children. She gradually loses hope and becomes melancholic, but she cannot leave the great love of her life. A melodrama with many comic moments, this film is also distinguished by the brilliant acting of Marianne Hoppe and Hans SÃ¶hnker.
