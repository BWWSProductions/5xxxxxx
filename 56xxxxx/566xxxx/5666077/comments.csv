,mistersyco,2010-07-09T04:41Z,Trojan found. 2008paul has more seeds anyway
[T],MrDowntown,2010-07-13T06:06Z,Works great. Using it to write this comment. Thank you so much for sharing
,desioner,2010-07-13T06:52Z,Did not work for me. The keygen didn\'t open. I have no anti virus either.
,othoudt,2010-08-16T05:05Z,"Complicated install i.e. keygens, serials, ect.  Failed first time...going back in. Instructions.txt could be better.  This install is for advanced scumbaggers only."
,musavvir,2010-08-19T17:30Z,"It works fine. But the dictation is pretty slow and somewhat inaccurate.

And the installation procedure is pretty complicated. So yeah. But it works alright."
,bikerabhinav,2010-08-20T10:10Z,"omg!! thank you so much, i would really like to pay you something... im a handicap, and this will be very useful for me. those bastards at hospital were selling this to me at such a high cost... im gonna download and get back to u ...

,brandohy,2010-08-22T02:35Z,"Normally I trust the cracks that would be trojans, since keygens and cracks are trojans (althought not harmful) This torrent was actually a rootkit trojan that screwed my computer over. DONT DOWNLOAD.... if its too late, use Malwarebytes"

,fuzzball086,2010-10-16T14:10Z,"Hi Orest, where is the folder ""key-act""? I can't find it."
,howaboutanoldfashioned,2010-11-19T06:19Z,"please stop writing worthless comments.  Make valid questions and we'll try to help. The torrent works perfectly, the trojan detected is just the keymaker, so make sure you follow the instructions exactly like they're written. "" Don't write crap like: installation is too hard."" Go pay for the software then, use comments to help improve torrents please.  Thanks, this is a great torrent."
