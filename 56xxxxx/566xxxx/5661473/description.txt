This release is 2hr 6mins vs IMAGiNE release 2hr 12mins...
The difference is this version has quite a few parts censored out of it (not by the encoder/uploader, but in this version of the film) like parts where the Fighting Dragons coach was extra mean (I can't be more specific than that without posting a spoiler). They're not in this version of the film.***CREDIT tjKong :)
