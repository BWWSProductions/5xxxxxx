,wakanabi,2010-07-03T21:23Z,I have gotten unrar errors or crc errors or dvd corruption BOTH times I've downloaded this. Anyone successful yet?
,wakanabi,2010-07-05T15:36Z,"OK...... Finallly got it to crc right on abgx, couldnt verify since no rip yet. Failed burning at 88%  went ahead and tried synch and closing disc.... To my surprise not only does it WORK but I tried installing to hard drive and it went 100%!!! Musta just been random padding that didnt go.   So in short, YES IT WORKS but NOT STEALTHED.. I don't care since I'm banned anyway  lol  have fun guys.  And for those on the fence like I was, yeah this game actually IS better than the 1st. Videos looked like crap but the graphics are pretty good"
