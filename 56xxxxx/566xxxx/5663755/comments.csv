,heretic576,2010-07-02T22:20Z,"decent a-team like action movie.

weird file size tho"
,Firedog747,2010-07-02T22:38Z,This is a very slow download for as many seeders as it has. I started the Losers torrent  from Aitb at the same time and it is faster with half the seeders.
,tiss2,2010-07-03T21:39Z,"I have been successfully stopped from watching this movie. My PS3 mutes the audio because of some Cinavia shit. 

Isn't that great? "

,blackninja27,2010-07-06T08:42Z,"if your trying to play this on a ps3 about 20-21 minutes in is the Cinavia DRM.  if you fast forwards through this part or skip it, it wont disable your audio.  AHOY MATEYS!"

,TheChosen1_,2010-10-16T22:51Z,"Hi guys.

I want to ask all of u about watching .mkv movies in notebook.When I watch a .mkv in my notebook , it seems like a divx or slightly better than it.I know the LCD panel of it isnt HD but I just wonder that does it really make a huge difference watching it in a 42"" or 46"" LCD or LED TV ?

Thx for ur answers guys.And thx for the movie again. "
,coolash007,2010-11-22T18:04Z,ah what shit.  Playing on PS3 it disable the audio.  fuckin waste of time.
,m4ch4r105,2011-08-03T17:43Z,"to anyone who has trouble playing this movie on the PlayStation 3... here is a workaround for the CINIVIA protection:

go to
1. settings
2. date and time settings
3. date and time
4. set manually
5. move up one year (if it's 2011, change it to 2012). this will give you another 20 minutes, so you'll have to do this about five times to watch this movie with audio..."
,Mel1234,2011-09-24T16:42Z,"Because of this Cinavia shit I NEVER use the PS3 for playing blu-ray rips anymore!!!
Of for that case play anything anymore besides games. Sony sucks....."
