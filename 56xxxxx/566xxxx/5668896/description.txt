Friedrich Nietzsche developed his philosophy, sometimes referred to as Nietzscheanism, during the late 19th Century amid growing criticism of Hegelâ€™s philosophic system. Since the dawn of the 20th Century, it has had great intellectual and political influence around the world. 

The Portable Nietzsche


Product Description
The works of Friedrich Nietzsche have fascinated readers around the world ever since the publication of his first book more than a hundred years ago. As Walter Kaufmann, one of the worldâ€™s leading authorities on Nietzsche, notes in his introduction, â€˜Few writers in any age were so full of ideasâ€™, and few writers have been so consistently misinterpreted. The â€œPortable Nietzscheâ€ includes Kaufmannâ€™s definitive translations of the complete and unabridged texts of Nietzscheâ€™s four major works: â€œTwilight of the Idolsâ€, â€œThe Antichristâ€, â€œNietzsche Contra Wagnerâ€ and â€œThus Spoke Zarathustraâ€. In addition, Kaufmann brings together selections from his other books, notes, and letters, to give a full picture of Nietzscheâ€™s development, versatility, and inexhaustibility. â€˜In this volume, one may very conveniently have a rich review of one of the most sensitive, passionate, and misunderstood writers in Western, or any, literatureâ€™ â€“ â€œNewsweekâ€.
