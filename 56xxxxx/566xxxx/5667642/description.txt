NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Cop  Out

Right source used was Cop Out DVDR-BOW,many thanks for this
Now i know this might sound silly,but we actually thought the colours on the dvdr looked wrong.....kind of
heavy on the yellow   Yes we know it's a retail dvd and usually the colours are how they are meant to be ,but.....
Anyway grab the sample and judge yourself.
Work done,well basically just made a smal script then just had crop,resize,white balance,contrast,brightness and sharpen.
Then it was a case of jusr ripping the dvdr with the script and remuxing the original AC3 384 audio track back to it.
Also opted for a higher bitrate to allow for the original audio track and still have decent bitrate for the video.
