1) If you select the US versions of Live Forever and Supersonic in the Chronological Order, there's no audio.

2) If you play any video in the Album Order (it's the order of the tracks in the collection), there's no audio in any of them.

3) The videos from the Extra Tracks session are highly compressed (that includes Rock N Roll Star, Morning Glory, Champagne Supernova and 7 more)

I know there's some weird authoring that shows the DVD twice its size when you put it in DVD Shrink and other rippers, but for a 6.5 Gb file, you expect it to be flawless.

Well, it's free, we shouldn't complain..."
