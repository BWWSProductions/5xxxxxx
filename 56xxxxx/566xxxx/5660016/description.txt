DONALD BYRD  ROYAL FLUSH
Format:Flac
Label Blue Note
Orig Year 1961



In the early 1960s, long before he'd pursue a funkier, electric direction, Donald Byrd was one of the leading trumpeters on the American jazz scene. Recorded in autumn 1961, Royal Flush is hard-swinging (with the baritone sax of Pepper Adams, how could it not be?) and deep-grooving hard bop. It does, however, point to aspects of jazz's future--note the poignant "Requiem," contributed by a young Herbie Hancock (this session's pianist) and the inventive drumming of Billy Higgins.
