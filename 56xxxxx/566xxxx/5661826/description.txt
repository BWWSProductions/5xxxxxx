TV show from the early 1990s with the ever-annoying Geraldo Rivera sitting on a horse at Spahn Ranch and walking around inside 3301 Waverly Drive where Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were murdered on August 9th 1969 with the equally annoying Bill Nelson, self-appointed 'expert' on the Tate-LaBianca case who appeared on virtually every talk show that would have him in those days.

It's interesting for people interested in the case because it shows a good look of the interior of the LaBianca house.
