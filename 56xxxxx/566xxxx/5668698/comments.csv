,punkrok,2010-07-27T19:38Z,07.28.10 - Avira noted that the keygen.exe in this torrent *IS* a virus. Just FYI.

However, it did register the program. What happened was I used it, a process inside keygen.exe called w9d...(I forget) tried accessing the internet. I blocked it and tried to delete the extracted files. I used Unlocker to try and kill the process that was preventing me from deleting the files and I got a nice big BSoD... Quickly restarted and deleted the files and everything was back to normal.
Make sure you have your firewall watching at ALL times! I personally use Vista Firewall Control for Win7 x64.
All in all a good program though"
