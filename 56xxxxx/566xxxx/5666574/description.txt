"Warning" is a single from, and the title track of, Green Day's 2000 album Warning.

Billie Joe Armstrong has said that the original concept was to create a song whose lyrics were made up of all signs and labels, and the idea grew from there.

The single was a number three modern rock hit in the US and "bubbled under" the Billboard Hot 100. The single also made it into the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart in the UK.

It bares strong resemblance to the song "Picture Book" by The Kinks.

The music video for Warning premiered on MTV on January, 2001. It was directed by Francis Lawrence and shows the life of a man who does trivial but dangerous things during his day.

Warning is the sixth full-length album by Green Day, released in 2000. Building upon its predecessor, Nimrod, Warning eschewed their trademark punk rock sound and incorporated acoustic elements. Warning was also the first Green Day album that was not produced by Rob Cavallo since Kerplunk, although he did have a hand in its production and was credited as executive producer.

Warning reached number four on the Billboard charts and went gold. Despite its high critical response, it represented the lowest commercial slump in the band's career since their first album. It is also the only Green Day album, apart from the debut, not to go platinum in America. The album has sold over 1.3 million units worldwide as of 2008.

Warning was reissued on vinyl on July 14, 2009. Warning and Minority are featured on the new game by Harmonix, Green Day: Rock Band.
