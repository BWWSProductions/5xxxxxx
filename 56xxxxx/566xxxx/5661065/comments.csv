[T],frankie-boy,2010-07-16T23:13Z,"One of the quintessential film noirs, this \""caper\"" movie is consistently grungy and grimy, perfectly capturing the oppressive urbanity that is a hallmark of the film noir genre.nnMarilyn Monroe is here in one of her early performances, perfectly cast and acting in fine form.nnThe acknowledged master of film noir music, Miklos Rosza, contributes the score.nnThe weakest part of movie is the bit from John McIntire near the end, in which he gives a speech extolling the virtue and necessity of law enforcement. This may have been added to conform to the film code of the period.nnThis is my favorite film noir. I remember when I barely knew the term \""film noir\"", and rented this movie, and watched it 8 times with barely a break.nnDirector: John HustonnnCast:nnSterling Hayden  ...
