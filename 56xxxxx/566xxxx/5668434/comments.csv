2 hours 18 mins to complete! Hit 2.4MB/s at one point and averaged around 800KB/s. Bloody fast DL or what!!
One bad point not big though for some reason 2 episodes are in ""file"" format so they wont play BUT its easy to correct just click rename and add "".avi"" at the end to change the format and they play as normal.
