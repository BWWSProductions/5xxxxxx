Sunday, 04 July 2010

Not surprisingly the show today consists entirely of previously broadcast material.


The Infowars web site describes today's offering thusly:

On this Sunday Edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Judge Andrew Napolitano [1st half of hour1], a former New Jersey Superior Court Judge and host of Freedom Watch on the Fox Business Channel Network, Republican Congressman for the 14th congressional district of Texas and founder of Campaign for Liberty, Ron Paul [2nd half of hour 1], and former governor of Minnesota, retired professional wrestler and color commentator, Navy Seal veteran, actor, and host of TruTV's popular show Conspiracy Theory, Jesse Ventura [hour 2].



The Judge Napolitano interview originally aired June 24th
The Ron Paul interview originally aired July 1st
The Jesse Ventura interview is from June 25th




The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
