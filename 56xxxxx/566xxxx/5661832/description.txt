Raw footage of the entire interview Leslie Van Houten gave to Barbara Walters in 1977 after she was granted a re-trial (she eventually was convicted after a third trial in 1978, the ultimate sentence being 7 years to life.) 

The interview was conducted inside the prison before her release on bail. Unique material!
