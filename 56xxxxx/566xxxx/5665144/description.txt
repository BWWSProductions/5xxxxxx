I am including with this torrent the last two issues of Chapman's newsletter.  The most recent one [June 30] came to be from a different source than the previous ones I've uploaded and you'll notice that the formatting is somewhat different.  Plenty of interesting content still.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
