Following the desastrous events of Justice League: Cry for Justice, Lian Harper is dead, her father, Arsenal, has lost his arm and is in a comatose state.  One person to blame: Prometheus.  Green Arrow wants Prometheus to pay for his crimes, but just how far is he willing to go?

Written by J.T. Krul (Fathom) and pencilled by Diogenes Neves (New Mutants), Mike Mayhew (Mystique, The Pulse), Fabrizio Fiorentino (Final Crisis Aftermath: Ink, Doc Samson), Geraldo Borges (Nova), Federico Dallocchio (Starcraft, Modern Warfare 2: Ghost).


Justice League: The Rise of Arsenal #2-4 take place halfway through Green Arrow v4 #32.  However as the latter half of Green Arrow v4 #32 deals with the overall conclusion of the storyline and where the JLA stands regarding Green Arrow I have placed it at the end of the reading order.
So, what you need to do is after reading Green Arrow v4 #31 start reading Green Arrow v4 #32 up to page 17 of the scan.  Then read Justice League: The Rise of Arsenal #2-4 and then go back to Green Arrow v4 #32 and read from page 18.
