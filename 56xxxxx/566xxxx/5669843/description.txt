           Told entirely through two POV video cameras, THE BUTCHER       
           throws you abruptly into the middle of chaos and death: a      
           handful of people have been abducted and lie bloodied and      
           bound on the floor of a rotting slaughterhouse. Nearby, a      
           team of snuff film producers are discussing their              
           gruesome handiwork: torturing their captives to death,         
           one by one.
