I'll have you know after watching this I beheaded 3 manikins that I liberated from a woman's clothing store.  Don't feel bad for them--I'm sure they had it coming with their cold, emotionless stares.  I won't be mocked anymore!  

The Star Wars guy down the street is going to get set straight any day now. Any. Day. "

And it was not Master Shimabukoro!  My sensei was good, but not eighth dan.  

This is a great series, must have.  I will be seeding for a long long time on a fast cable."
