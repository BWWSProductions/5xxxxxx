Storyline:

Two carefree pals (Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield) traveling through Alabama are mistakenly arrested, and charged with murder.
Fortunately, one of them has a cousin whoâ€™s a lawyer â€“ Vincent Gambini (Joe Pesci, Lethal Weapon 3, Home Alone), a former auto mechanic from Brooklyn who just
passed his bar exam after his sixth try.
Vinnyâ€™s never been in court â€“ or in Alabama â€“ and when he arrives with his leather-clad girlfriend (Marisa Tomei in her OscarÂ® winning Supporting Actress performance),
