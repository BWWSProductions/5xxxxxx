Claire Norris, a young waitress in a small-town diner, sat on a jury, along with eleven others and listened to the evidence against a man accused of a crime against a minor. After days of difficult deliberation, the man - Leonard Karlsson, Jr. - was found guilty.

In prison, the â€œunspoken ruleâ€ regarding such crimes was enforced - Karlsson was beaten by the other prisoners to within an inch of his life, his face severely disfigured as a result. Now out of prison, Karlsson returns to the town that held his trial. Still severely scarred and barely recognizable, he conceals his woundsâ€¦and his identity.

In one horrifying night, he once again faces the twelve jurors who decided his fate. This time he decides theirs....
