Pilot :
`Familiar Strangers` asks the question. `Is it really possible to relate to ones parents and siblings after being replaced by the family dog? . . . Perhaps as friends - weird friends?" An off beat - funny - heartfelt story of family negotiating the changing relationships between parents and children, especially as those children grow into adulthood.
