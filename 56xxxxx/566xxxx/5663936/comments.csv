,ZenRhino,2010-07-02T23:00Z,thanks for this huge torrent... do you happen to have the unaired prelims for UFN 21? I haven't been able to find them anywhere.
,sugdenbra,2010-07-02T23:14Z,"I´m sorry ZenRhino, I just looked at my small mma collection and I did not have such a file, again, sorry m8!

Thought, should I somehow find it I will upload the torrent for you. But please don´t count on it cause then you could get dissapointed, I will look hard in the morning on the private sites I´m registrated at to se if I can find it.

Have a good day/night ZenRhino!"
,sugdenbra,2010-07-02T23:25Z,"I can´t see any seeders in utorrent?

I could have sworn I saw someone already done with his dl earlier today!

I´m Sorry about the download speed  guys, but anyone done with this are going to jump off it immediately when done this is going to take forever, I dont have forever since I really need the small amount of bandwith to other things as well!!!

I´m not perfect, me myself jump torrents from time to time when I for example must close down computer or whatever the reason might be, the differens is those torrents I jump occasionally have thousends of seeders/leechers. 
You don´t jump off a torrent when done if there´s only leechers on it and you´r the only seeder, you just don´t do that!

Just saying!"
,sugdenbra,2010-07-02T23:30Z,"Ohh, just to make my self clear:

I ment in general, not anyone in particulary so do speak.  

I can also see 2 seeders my self included now again, hahaha!  NICE!!!  Thank you for helping me second seeder who ever you are? Appriciate it a lot!"
,sugdenbra,2010-07-03T19:52Z,"Sorry for all the downtime, have had huge problems, first with my SSH tunnel crashing all the time (pherhaps pushing up speed to hard?).  

Then after that Windows completely died, reinstall and back up with tunnel again, trying to seed this for you. 

Then we have those people alredy done that seeme to think this is some bloodey:  no-need to-seed-when-done kind of torrent!!  This piss me of to know these rats are even allowed to breath, if only some of those fuck-scum stayed and seeded this torrent wouldn´t have stayed still a few hours ago when my comp crashed.

To be honest, I don´t know how much of this I can tolerate. I would really like to say fuck no and just terminate this torrent right now and leave some of those potentiale only leech fucks without it.  

But of course that would leave the potentially good seeding people without it, I would hate to see that happen so I´ll strugle on.  But know this, if my tunnel/comp crash again and there are no other people staying to seed when done this torrent is going to stay dead till I notice tunnel/comp crashed."
,2b2,2010-07-04T12:53Z,"i will seed all files on this but because of size of the download when i open the download to install on my u torrent i select none and then just click on the first two files to download, then when they are finished downloading i will have made more disc space by removing other files which i've finished seeding so that i can download the next few files of this upload by going into the file section on my u torrent and start downloading the ones i previously skipped. seems though that this upload might not be seeding for long as therse only one person seeding which is a bloody shame because this is one hell of brilliant amazing upload. not seen this upload before with all fight nights on it and might be a long time if ever someone takes the time to but such a complete upload of ufc fight night events. big respect to the uploader for this effort, people really need to seed this.  "
,2b2,2010-07-04T13:16Z,"just seen you comments sugdenbra and understand your frustration. everytime one of the events has finished downloading it will be seedind while i download the next and so on untill i have downloaded it fully, then i swear to you i will seed all files for at least a month when im done downloadind it all, i give you my word. if you read these comments please reply. "
,Ts187,2010-09-26T02:28Z,"For the Love of everything good and green on this earth, PLEASE SEED!!!! AND IN THE NAME OF FRANCE, WILL YOU PLEASE UN-RESTRICT YOUR UPLOAD SPEED PEOPLE!!!! I'm DL @ 30kbps and UL at nearly 100kbps! I've uploaded 2x what I've downloaded..."
