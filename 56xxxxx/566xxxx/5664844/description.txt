Tom, a wide-eyed innocent sixteen year-old, ends up in hospital with a Chechen man Artur, after accidentally having saved his life in a car bomb explosion downtown Tallinn. Artur is a mysterious man who seems to have a mission of his own in Estonia. The local hardboiled detective Rain firmly believes that Artur is doing some dirty business on his door step. Fascinated by this quiet stranger, Tom helps him to escape from the hospital. Despite Artur's efforts to get rid of the young boy, they end up together like an odd couple. Slowly it becomes obvious that there is some big tragedy in Artur's life. With his charm and innocence Tom seems to ease Artur's pain, caused by his memories. A kind of friendship evolves between these two totally different men. Tom begins to realize that in Artur's life hatred and vengeance are not only words - they are real things, like the war, in which Artur lost his family. An unknown person betrayed him to the Russians, who tortured and killed his family in one of their cleansing operations. Artur fulfills his sad mission after he finally finds out who the traitor was - Kerim, Artur's "brother", who Artur grew up with. Tom witnesses the murder and is thrown into dramatic events that eventually open his eyes. Tom runs away in terror, discovering that the third "brother", Gloobus, had set up the family father Kerim. Only Tom knows that Artur had killed the wring man. Tom finds himself an unwitting accomplice in a deadly game of vengeance and death. Facing the violent chain of events only one question remains: will he become a part of it?

Tom on 16-aastane eesti poiss, kes kÃ¼sib elult tÃ¤pselt nii palju, kui mÃµnusaks Ã¤raolemiseks hÃ¤davajalik. Elul on aga varuks ootamatud pÃ¶Ã¶rded. Tallinna kesklinnas toimuva autoplahvatuse tÃµttu satub Tom haiglasse Ã¼hte palatisse tÅ¡etÅ¡een Artur Magomajevi, sÃµjas perekonna kaotanud kinnise ja karmi mehega. Politsei on veendunud, et Artur peab Eestis tÃ¤itma oma missiooni. Tom aitab tal pÃµgeneda. Ãœhise kÃ¤ttemaksuteekonna jooksul hakkavad ilmsiks tulema Arturi minevikuvarjud. Tomi lÃµbusus nÃ¤ib tema kaotusvalu kÃ¼ll leevendavat, kuid ei lÃµpeta vÃ¤givallaahelat, millesse ta poisi paratamatult endaga koos toonud on. Hirmutava tegelikkusega silmitsi olles peavad mÃµlemad tegema omad valikud.
