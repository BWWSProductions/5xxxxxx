Sting in the Tail is the seventeenth studio album by German heavy metal band Scorpions. It was released on March 19, 2010 in Europe (March 14 in Greece) and was released on March 23 in North America. It will likely be their last studio album before retirement.

The album has a duet featuring the Finnish symphonic metal singer Tarja Turunen, in the song "The Good Die Young".

A tentative title for the album was Humanity: Hour II, however this was eventually scrapped.
