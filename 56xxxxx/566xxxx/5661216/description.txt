Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga - The Fly 2) whose hairstyle surely ranks as one of the universe's oddest creations, is kidnapped by the evil Lord Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis - Ghostbusters). But fear not! Lone Star (Bill Pullman - Independance Day) and his half man half dog sidekick Barf (John Candy - Uncle Buck), blast into action in their space Winnebago, struggling against time and their own limited intelligence to rescue the princess. Along the way, they'll confront the huge gooey Pizza The Hut (voiced by Dom De Luise), a sassy robot named Dot Matrix (voice of Joan Rivers), and a wise little creature, Yogurt (Mel Brooks), who teaches them the mystical power of "The Schwartz". The gags fly faster than laserblasts as the fearless and clueless space heroes wage interstellar warfare for life, liberty and the pursuit of massive merchandising opportunities.
