,omegafox84,2010-07-04T04:45Z,very sorry man. the actual dvd didn't even have any!
,Deaf_Ear,2010-07-04T06:29Z,"@omegafox84

I see that you mention this doesn't have subtitle but wonder does it have closed caption instead?"
,omegafox84,2010-07-04T07:38Z,"ah, good thinking. indeed it does. i just checked it out and the closed caption can be used in place of the missing subtitles. thanks for pointing that out!"
,Deaf_Ear,2010-07-04T08:39Z,"That good to know it has CC.

Thumb Up."

,raththesh,2010-08-08T16:33Z,was just wondering what are your next uploads and for the dvds i requested could you not strip anything from them
,omegafox84,2010-08-10T00:46Z,"@raththesh: i have no particular order when uploading. i've been waiting to see if some of these problems TPB has been experiencing lately are fixed before uploading anything else. from what i read though, it may be some time until the edit feature is fixed. also, i never remove anything unless it's necessary.
