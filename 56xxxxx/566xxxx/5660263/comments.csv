,Xvys,2010-07-04T11:03Z,"Really disappointed with this movie, the premise is so promising but it fails to deliver. The gorgeous Kristen Stewart is made to look ugly and the potential love interest between the girls is falls flatter than Kristen's chest. It could of been so good but is totally limp. The music is crummy, too."
,FreeDerry71,2010-07-09T16:15Z,BEWARE!!!!   nnMy internet was suspended and I was issued a copyright infringement warning after downloading this the day before yesterday.  The owner of this film is out for blood

Just thought you may want know."
,zasta23,2010-08-05T22:09Z,great quality...and I didn't get any warnings from anyone
,MajesticMeteor,2010-09-12T16:25Z,"Nobody has fucked with me about ""my-ass-is-grass"" for downloading.

But I might add that Searches at TPB were dumped this morning, but this pulled up on a regular browser search.

Other than that, it seems that TPB has been making me change passwords every time lately. W-h-a-t-e-v-e-r.

LONG LIVE THE PIRATE BAY!!!  And fuck the Hollywood Jewish accounts that want to end our leeching, lol.  Fuck them money-grubbing Jews."
,pirator11,2010-12-11T22:47Z,"You're dumb, MajesticMeteor - If there were no 'money grubbing jews' , there would not be no movie for you to leech. 
So, get your head out of your behind, and take a deep breath, because without money, there ain't gonna be no film.

Of course, I love 'leeching' too, but if I like the stuff I download, I buy it, to support the creaters of whatever it may be, therefore, having them produce/code some more of it.

Peace,"
,Darel.Coster92,2010-12-13T22:42Z,Nice one good download thank you ! 
,Daky101,2010-12-24T21:50Z,"Thx,this is sweet!"
,11111011,2010-12-30T02:29Z,"I hate to be a buzzkill but I can confirm with others that I received a total of five DMCA's after downloading this.

Go figure, because they logged the complaint dates and it looks like they came in several months ago (when I originally downloaded it)."
,Cerebral222,2011-02-06T10:41Z,"Good picture, good sound. This is the type torrent download we all hope for, Thanx Ray."
,fragar1991,2011-09-05T22:22Z,awesome =D
,eggaids,2011-11-08T02:08Z,LOVE
,jwazza,2012-05-13T09:45Z,">> You're dumb, MajesticMeteor

Not only are you dumb MajesticMeteor you are also a rabid racist antisemitic Andre Brevik who know shit. 

Just 2 examples:- Richard Stallman who has spoken out about about the evils (yes, he actually uses the word evil) of proprietary software and DRM for over 30 years and has founded the FSF (that's the Free Software Foundation) is Jewish

2) Bram Cohen who brought you BitTorrent is Jewish

So go and get yourself educated dumbass
