Barbara Walters interviews Leslie Van Houten... again. This time the interview was part of a 1987 television show in which Walters interviewed a couple of female prisoners. Only the segment on Van Houten is included in this clip.

Compare this to the 1977 interview she did, also with Walters, and note the remarkable difference(s/)/change(s). I uploaded the 1977 interview here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5661832/Manson_Family_-_Leslie_Van_Houten_Interview_%281977%29_Unedited
