Garmin MapInstall Special version 3.14.2

This modified executable will let you upload your mapset (gmapsupp.img)
to your PC drives or your GPS.

This version doesn't need .gma unlock files but accepts unlock keys also for
FIDs above 2200, e.g.: CN Europe 2011.10 and CN North America 2011.10.


Instructions for use:
1.
- Install MapInstall 3.14.2 (Get it from: (see .nfo for link) )
2.
- Replace MapInstall.exe
3.
- On the Device Settings screen under the "Find Device" button all local and
  network drives will be available, so you can create gmapsupp.img files
  without an attached GPS.
