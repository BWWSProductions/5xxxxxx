In Flames' last album is pure shit.
This one isn't great either."
,yoseedah,2010-07-02T01:59Z,"Wasn't there supposed to be a remake of ""sadistic lullabye"" on this album?"
,TheBombio,2010-07-06T21:10Z,"Safe torrent.
Great quality.

I think this album was amazing. A lot better than their 2007 effort. Thanks!"

,stamina72,2010-07-09T16:04Z,Thanks! Fkin great album!!
,xenogis,2010-07-20T04:25Z,"Yep melodeath is almost dead... it is kind of expected though. The problem with the way people put metal into genres so specific is that after a certain point any innovation to a genre would change the genre. Look at how Death Metal turned to Melodic Death Metal turned to Modern Melodic Death Metal. Of course there are still bands making music in all of those ""genres"" but there isn't much innovation, usually the music becomes stale and boring (although sometimes that isn't true)"

,Jarney,2010-09-05T04:57Z,"Thanks for the upload :-) Greatly appreciated. However, although having gone through the album, I must agree with couple of previous comments with that I don't particularly enjoy this album either.

With regards to Melodeath dieing out, I must admit also that it sure does feel like it's on the way out unfortunately. But, nevertheless. "
,Fallen_Gri,2010-11-06T09:26Z,Thank you for upload. I am crying. XC
,lordofthesky,2011-02-09T04:00Z,"This album was amazing. I'm not one to nitpick about genres, since I don't have some kind of pretensive genre loyalty or a social image that relies on listening to a certain type of music. My music already has names, and this music is called Soilwork, to me.

Epitome, The Akuma Afterglow, Let this River Flow... amazing songs.

Very good torrent, very good album."
,MetalistCarter,2011-06-30T12:06Z,Would have to disagree with Melodic Death Metal is not dying have you hear Arch Enemy's new album? It is different then their others to a big degree.
,WiR3D-kNiGhT,2011-07-14T12:54Z,"MetalistCarter Arch Enemy is Death Metal... Not Melodic Death Metal, im listening to it at the moment, it has more flow then there older albums, and some purist songs, if u can call them that.
But that has absolutely no impact on MDM.
But for the sake of freshness bands must change, for better or worse."
