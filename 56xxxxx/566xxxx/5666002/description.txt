        Oh hai friends, its been a long time! We truly enjoy seeing other   Â±Â°
        garbage scene groups especially in this section call out other      Â°
        xvid groups they believe they are better than, even tho that
        same exact group was caught in the past with proof that they had
        been stealing from p2p as well.

        We're Back!!! Ok this is out first trial cam we figured we'd put it
	out there because its better than the overcropped cam already out.
	Quality would be flawless if it wasnt for that massive flicker,
	which cant be fixed through hardware, any suggestions short of a
        new cam. Any ways the kings of the homemades have returned, this 
	would be above our orc standards but the flicker degrades the video
	a little bit... time will fix that tho. And as always kids remember
	if you don't like any of our releases you can suck the ORC FAT ONE!
