,mmiabc,2010-07-01T23:02Z,Is Hot Tub Time Machine coming?
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-02T00:40Z,Now I'm not going to put it up. People are getting too greedy. People need to relax and when you request a movie it will come but shit give me time like people are way to greedy. I'm to the point where I just might stop uploading....
[T],ctang,2010-07-02T02:03Z,yo nice upload!!! my next upload will be men or honor
[T],ctang,2010-07-02T02:06Z,"you wont stop...its like an addiction, i know...lol...i can do hot tub time machine in a little bit...will add it to the top of my list when i get it and i am planning on alice in wonderland sometime in the near future!!!...next will be men of honor

by the way, I NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU GOT CCE AND IF YOU HAVE TRIAL OR NOT...I CANT SEEM TO GET IT TO WORK FOR ME USING DVDRB AND THEREFORE CANT FOLLOW DJFREDS GUIDE...PLEASE HELP AND RESPOND...sorry for the caps just figured it would stand out"
[T],FatFreddy007,2010-07-02T02:54Z,thank you mike
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-02T03:08Z,"Honestly Ctang I have no fucking idea where I got my CCE I believe it was a copy of the paradox torrent but I can't remember it was sooo long ago. I will do hot Tub Time Machine and I have Alice in Wonderland but there are some navigational errors with the film so I have to fix that before uploading. If you can upload the Alice in Wonderland that'd be cool.

@SeedKey - No problem boss:)"
[T],ctang,2010-07-02T04:02Z,"im not trying to be a dick i just asked a few times and you didnt say anything...could you happen to recall if its trial or retail version...thanks...i will be trying Alice in wonderland sometime this week...hopefully i dont run into the same issues as you with it...you can do h.t.t.m., thats fine with me...means i dont have to get it :)"

[T],zombifuzz,2010-07-02T10:19Z,"mike...

are you trying to give people a heart attack!?

quitting TPB!?

i said that at least 1,000 times myself and here i am 400 torrents later."
,mmiabc,2010-07-02T10:39Z,"No, man you got me wrong.  I didn't know you had mentioned Hot Tub Time Machine.  I was just wondering if that was in line.  I wasn't rushing you because I didn't know about it.  Bad presentation on the comment.  I appreciate your work.  Is there a place I can look at your order of releases like djfred's torrentbucket site or something so this never happens again?"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-02T15:13Z,Sure Tater you can take it no worries:)
,Joe729,2010-07-02T15:34Z,"doing an excellent job with the uploads, just wanted to ask if you have the movie serpico(1973)? "
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-02T15:47Z,No but I can get that movie. I'll add it to my list:)
,Metal1Dead,2010-07-02T16:57Z,"Thanks man 

could u pls tell me exactly why ""[X] Partial Stripped"" is ticked , i noticed it in some of ur releases  but didn't get what was really stripped in the video , pls make it clear to me . 

Again thanks man , also take ur time but don't freaking quit .
PEACE "
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-02T18:31Z,What was stripped was like previews I have it listed right below what was stripped. Nothing is ever stripped from the feature itself not even credits. The partially stripped is just there basically signifying all the warnings and previews are gone.
,trytryagain1,2010-07-02T21:20Z,This is one of my kids favorite movies thanks ALOT!!!
