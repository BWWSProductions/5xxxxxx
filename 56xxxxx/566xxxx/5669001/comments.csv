i've tried burning the image to DVD with nero and with imgburn at different speeds but when i try to use in my '03 e39 BMW (MK4 NAV) it takes a moment and then goes to 'Maps DVD/CD is unreadable, please check DVD/CD'.

I have NAV SW version 4-1/00 (I think), if that matters.  I'm able to load 2009 NAV high version without issue.

Please help, thanks!"

Worked perfectly on 2003 745i E65. Used Ridata DVD-R, burned with CloneCD at 2x. Also works in my buddy's E39 station wagon. His software version was also 4-1/00."

,skwerlabusr,2011-06-18T06:40Z,Thanks!! Worked wonderfully in my 2002 745i :)
