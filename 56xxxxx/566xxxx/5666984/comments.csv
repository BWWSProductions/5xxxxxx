,Beauharnais,2010-12-11T21:31Z,"I downloaded it, I read some mails, then I read some articles about it... Now I dont seed it anymore... All of this is a conspirationist hysteria.
Some of you will hate me for this, but I can say you: Just read these emails. You will see by yourself.
And, actually, Amstrong and Aldrin _did_ walk on the moon ;-)"
[T],TalmudTimmy,2011-11-27T06:33Z,"The emails are legit. How is that hysteria? Do you think there is no such thing as conspiracies, Beauharnais ?"
,He345,2011-12-07T16:29Z,"Beauharnais: You talk shit. Of course you can't believe what Michael Mann, Phil Jones and the AGW people say about this - they have a very good reason to ignore facts and lie, right? There is too many people who don't want Climategate to be what it is.

Conspiration? Silly. What the emails show us, is what the sceptics always have known: that the AGW-science is deeply flawed, and that the scientists don't want to play with conventional scientific rules."
