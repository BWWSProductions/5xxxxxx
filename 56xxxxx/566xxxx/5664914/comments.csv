I'm seeding like crazy, because this is one of the first times I'm actually pleased with the subs. I very rarely spot a mistake, but it's overall quality is still very good.

I'd like to know how you guys release your torrents, though. Depends on how good it's seeded or are you still busy subbing and syncing and such?

In the first case, I'm willing to help out if needed :) I'm just glad someone's here to do some good work! 
(Oh, and I can't wait to see what happens next ofcourse..!)

Sensua."
