The show took the form of a round table discussion and sketches which veered tangentially from the sublime to the ridiculous. Parodies of television and radio formats were common ('Fat Man On A Bicycle', and so on). Controversial satirist Chris Morris has praised the show on many occasions, in particular for its observations on the media. Many say its influence can be felt in On The Hour and other such programmes.

There was also a show of the same name running on BBC Radio 4 in 1998, again hosted by Fry. 
This was a completely different show, however, being a series of 45-minute serious debates interspersed with the occasional sketch or piece of music.
