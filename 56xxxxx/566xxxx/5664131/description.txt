In the summer of 1984, over a few drinks in a London pub, FM was formed. Comprising the ex-Samson pair of bassist Merv Goldsworthy and drummer Pete Jupp, the formidable Overland brothers â€“ vocalist/guitarist Steve and lead guitarist Chris; both formerly of Wildlife â€“ plus the keyboard talents of Philip Manchester, better known as sci-fi nutcase Didge Digital, the band wrote six songs. In December of that same year they secured a recording contract with the CBS/Portrait label.
The first public appearance of FM (not to be confused with the Canadian band of the same name) was on Valentineâ€™s Day of 1985, attracting rave reviews. The debut album, â€˜Indiscreetâ€™, wasnâ€™t far behind. A fully-fledged masterpiece, every single track hit the spot, and the mega-ballad â€˜Frozen Heartâ€™ caused lips to quiver and tear ducts to moisten whenever it was played.
