This is the Grand Theft Auto III game 

no Cd is needed to play I think my saved game is in there too Lol I dont care

ok I have not modded the game much all I did was since the game had no music I added music like some from Head Radio Lips 106 and Flashback and for the people who love the GTA series like me I added some songs from GTA San Andreas and some linkin park :D  

also there are some cool skins too!


To listen to the music go to the MP3 station and enjoy :D

I would also like to say it might take awhile so just let it go and when it finishes please seed it so it will be faster in the future and also I have seen people get soo close to the 100% and quit :( /facepalm please just let it go 

when done downloading please seed 

also for the people who get to 99.8% I think thats when its done I dont know why it stops there but I think its because now the game file is too big but still see if you can play the game after it hits 99.8%

Enjoy :D
