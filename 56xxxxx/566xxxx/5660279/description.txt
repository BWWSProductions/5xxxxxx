 Black Label Society, is the brainchild of guitar great Zakk Wylde. Hard and heavy, big on riffs and even bigger on the solos, BLS is the bastard child of Black Sabbath only pumped up on steroids. Having graced the world's stages for the last 18 years, both as Ozzy Osborne's right hand man as well as fronting BLS, Zakk Wylde has established himself as one of the few remaining guitar heroes. Skullage represents a look at the history of Black Label Society through album tracks, fan favorites and four live acoustic cuts.
