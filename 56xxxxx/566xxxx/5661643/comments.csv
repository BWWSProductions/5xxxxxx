,SpartanAK47,2010-07-02T01:01Z,"no offense but it has one of the most terrible animation I've ever come; watch the part where Pain screams ""Your pain is NOT greater than MINE!"" and hits the ground with his bare fist"
,phobiaof,2010-08-08T00:55Z,Spartan. you're a fucking tard. this episode was insane. the animation HAD to be like that or it couldn't have been as intense a battle as it was. go watch teletubbies and leave the anime to the adults
