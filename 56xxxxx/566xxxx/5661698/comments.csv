,hank266,2010-07-05T01:22Z,"This game is on Japanese. I cant understand anything. When i read the info on game by natsukawa27 he didnt mention anything about this. My question is,Is it possible to play this game whitout understanding the menu,plot etc?"
,Fadedragon,2010-07-05T04:06Z,"Yea, in Japanese, I hear theres a few fan localization hacks tho, ill look into it later, but it works/not a fake, just not in english. "
,natsukawa27,2010-07-05T11:51Z,"Sorry I didnt mention it but one of the best fan hack translations or just fan translations is at http://www.tales-cless.org/ just ask him if something doesent work they say it works but I didnt try and no it wont be released in english cause it was never localized 

Hope it helped"

,natsukawa27,2010-08-17T19:59Z,"I'd like to but I can't edit it cause I get an error screen everytime I try.

And it's Jap cause it was released there and was never released anywhere else."
