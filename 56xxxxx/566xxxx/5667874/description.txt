Brazil is vast â€“ as big as Australia, Spain and France combined. Large enough to spawn a whole slew of road movies and, so it would appear, road albums too. Otto's Sem Gravidade is one example, as is this gorgeous CD, born from a journey Beto Villares undertook to research music for a documentary. Setting the mood for the musical voyage he wishes to share with us, he reels off names of Brazilian cities. 'Teresina, Petrolina, Horizonteâ€¦' he sings on the opening track, accompanied by Fernanda Takai of Pato Fu. 'Meio Dia em Macapa' recalls the midday heat in Amapa's capital; 'Redentor' remembers Rio; and 'Africa La' hymns the Afro-Brazilian heart of the north-east. 

The overall style recalls CeU's 'Malemolencia' â€“ spacey, clubby and drifty, with echoes of bossa nova, samba, forro and baiao picked up with an eclectic, post-genre ear to the world. There are plenty of guests on board. Alongside Villares' own baritone, there's CeU's sweet huskiness, the MPB touch of Zelia Duncan of (new) Os Mutantes, a rapping Rappin' Hood and the rich contralto of Anelis Assumpcao. The latter's seductive, pure voice closes the album with perhaps the strongest track, 'Lume'. She's the daughter of the founder of the Sao Paulo avant-garde, Itamar Assumpcao, and his musical stamp is felt all over the CD â€“ from the tight three-point harmony and offbeat bass of 'No Dend'agua' to the quirky rhythms of the vocal lines in 'Medo'.

This is a wonderful debut: modern yet rooted in traditional Brazil, richer and more detailed on every listen.
