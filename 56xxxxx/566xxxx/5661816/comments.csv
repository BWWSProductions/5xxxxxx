,Ed237,2010-07-01T17:02Z,"dubbed means if a film is in a certain language, the sound is changed into a foreign other language."
,WickedEdward,2010-07-01T17:03Z,"? ???? ?????????? ?????? ???????, ???? ??????????, ??? ????? ??? :)"
,WickedEdward,2010-07-01T17:04Z,"Darn, my above comment was in Russian *.*, It said, I do not understand spoken Russian, only Macedonian, but thank you :)"
,BodaDju,2010-07-01T17:13Z,oh thanks :p i didn't know that :)
,LunaElisa,2010-07-01T17:52Z,It's a good cam only the beginning of the movie isn't correct. Maybe you was too late with filming because the first scene starts with Riley.
,eternityy,2010-07-01T17:55Z,i am beggin for english one please please please where is english eclipse
,Whogivzafk,2010-07-01T18:09Z,It is in Russian but I'll cont 2 seed until another version is out.  Be patient. V/7 (for cam) & for picky people V/4 (general)
,zoltan2792,2010-07-01T18:11Z,THX for upload  this is good  yessssssssssss :-)
,Pupi91,2010-07-01T18:21Z,No sound :( :(
[T],despo1ler,2010-07-01T18:27Z,"those of you wanting an english version will just have to  wait for a release group like IMAGINE or PRISM to aquire the english soundtrack and use this video to make a telesynch (TS). Given their previous record that should only be a day or 2 from now so just be patient and look out for a TS being posted across numerous VIP and trusted accounts as that will then be a genuine release.
 And TYVM for uploading this as it gives people the raw material they need to make an english language TS, without people uploading these foriegn language versions we would wait a lot longer for an English TS release."
,Squiglet,2010-07-01T18:29Z,How could it be that an American made film comes out first in Russia subbed? Isn't it logical that it would first be in English??? The English version is being suppressed...
,szucsgabor,2010-07-01T18:37Z,"It's ok. Sound is russian! it is NOT FAKE!
Thx"
,eternityy,2010-07-01T18:39Z,"@despo1ler

,Pupi91,2010-07-01T18:39Z,"What program have for movie?
Because for me with the Avi Movie Player not sound."
,Crispbac,2010-07-01T18:47Z,"@pupi91
Use VLC, lol. People, if your crud isn't working, use VLC, it has been told many times to use that. It's the only program that works most of the time w/o codecs needed to download."
,boris_kolomiets,2010-07-01T18:53Z,thank you!
,Pupi91,2010-07-01T18:57Z,"Crispbac, you are amazing.
Thanks. "
,pdabber,2010-07-01T19:32Z,"@Pupi91  

The PM Player will play .avi along with many other video and music formats.

There was an English DVDSCR torrent. I downloaded it only to find an RAR file without the password. There was a link included that directed you to a site that offered 50% off the normal subscription price of like seventy dollars or so.

F%$ging spammers!"
,Interpreter,2010-07-01T19:48Z,"Wow! I was surprised but it works! It's the real movie, just the one I saw in the cinema yesterday! The quality is poor sometimes but on the whole it's watchable. Thanks a million! "

,milboye,2010-07-02T08:31Z,@TalhaBhatti I wouldn't plan on a DVDrip until either right before or right after it is available on DVD which if I had to guess will be about 4-6 months from now...as for a eng cam i would expect a decent real one in the next 24-48 hours
,Nyphot,2010-07-02T10:34Z,"Thanks for your post Despo1ler. I'm kind of a newb yet and I was wondering how they did the TS mixes on some of these. 

I've seen some compliments on some of these foreign uploads. The VIPs & Trusteds do pro work. I personally could care less about this movie, but I'm anxious to see what they can do."
,Louise8710,2010-07-02T13:17Z,i got the italian version lol i want the english!!!
