[T],despo1ler,2010-07-02T17:28Z,"Different people rip the same source material in differnt ways, that is why there are several different file sizes of the same quality camrip available atm but there are also several different camrips as well. Quality on the 1s I've seen so far is not great,apart from thr russian release, and I would reccomend that anyone who has an ounce of patience wait for an imagine or prism TS release using the elect14ka video source, if you cant wait that long then you will have to  either download all the available camrips in order to find the best quality one or settle for luck of the draw.
 Thanks to the people uploading these cams tho as it does add to the available source material for making a decent quality TS :)"
,idisb,2010-07-02T17:42Z,this is real! great!! but i dont now what it is in the beginning

,Solstice420,2010-07-02T19:44Z,"This is yet ANOTHER ""Innocence Group Release"" It's the SAME file being uploaded by 50 million people 50 million times.  It's a different movie in the beginning (roughly 45 seconds). 

The sound is horrible, the video is the worst I've ever seen for a cam.  I have come across 5 uploaders thus far just changing the file name and maybe playing with the aspect ratio.

Wait a couple days for a BETTER release.
