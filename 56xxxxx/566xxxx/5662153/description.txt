Finally an available quality MP3 rip of this CD. I have been trying to d/l this forever to no avail. Stumbled across my CD after a move, sweet!

Complete album rip, very hard to find.

1-All Is Forgiven
2-One Good Lover
3-Don't Let Go
4-Master Of The Land
5-Stand Up
6-Good Kid
7-How Dare A Woman
8-Rock-a-Bye
9-Love Shut Down
10-So Far Away

320kbps, 48,000 rip.

Awesome late 80's music, please enjoy.

Let me know if you would like and ISO or wave files if you want to convert to FLAC, it will only cost you a '+'. Magnet link guarantees my high quality file not some low quality unavailable crap floating around. Don't forget to rate me if you like this torrent.

Cheers
