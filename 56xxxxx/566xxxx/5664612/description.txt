Two disgraced African American FBI sibling Agents, Kevin and Marcus Copeland, who are assigned the duty of protecting cruise line heiresses Brittany and Tiffany Wilson from a kidnapping plot. Their supervisor, Elliott Gordon has given them this duty as a last resort to being fired from the agency given their recent reputation. When the Wilson sisters get a facial scar in a car accident, they refuse to leave the hotel due to their appearance. But in order to save their job, the Copeland brothers will have to do the unthinkable: disguise themselves as white women in the form of Wilson sister look-alikes. (Copied from IMDB)
