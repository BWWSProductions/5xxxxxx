,Estlin,2010-07-03T23:15Z,"Thanks for the continued uploads. A while back, I had asked you about the 4th Floor EP. Were you able to dig it up from your collection? It would be amazing to get a rip of that."
,erikphnx,2010-07-04T05:30Z,"Thanks for the 3 albums I did not have and thanks for helping me share the New Man record. Who knows maybe someone else has also been looking forever for ""I'm calling you""

It's amazing but you are soon (I hope) going to make it to your 100th Rare 80s albums post. "
,Stultissimi_Amatorii,2010-07-13T03:12Z,"Muchas gracias - nice to finally find a fix for my 80\'s CanCon habit. I\'m looking for a few hard-to-find bands. 1) The Box. 2) Uncle Bonsai. 3) Gowan. 4) Chalk Circle. 5) Moxy Fruvous - especially the original EP. 6) Rough Trade - all I can get is Birds of a Feather and 69% of Weapons. I\'m also looking for the Apocalypse Morning remix of Orange Crush by REM, which includes the \""I love the smell of napalm in the morning\"" soliloquy Apocalypse Now."
,Stultissimi_Amatorii,2010-07-13T19:46Z,Found the Chalk Circle in one of your previous packages. Thanks again - it was well worth the hours it took to go through your entire list.
