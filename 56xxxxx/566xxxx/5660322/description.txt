           In 1939 Hortense, illegitimate but intelligent and             
           ambitious, is brought up on Jamaica with the family of         
           charismatic, free-thinking Michael, who joins the Air          
           Force when war breaks out and goes to England. After the       
           war, Hortense, now a qualified teacher, makes a marriage       
           of convenience to Gilbert Joseph, paying for his passage       
           to England on condition he sends for her. She not only         
           hopes to see Michael again but believes that living in         
           Britain will give her more scope. When she arrives in          
           London in 1948, she is extremely disappointed by the one       
           room in which they must live and the obvious colour            
           prejudice. Queenie, their liberal landlady, is also a          
           woman used to disappointment, marrying decent but dull         
           and sexless Bernard to get her away from the family farm.      
           Whilst Bernard - now presumed missing - was in the Air         
           Force during the war, she first took in lodgers from the       
           armed forces, partly for the company, including Michael,       
           with whom she had sex.
