Here is a PATCHED .EXE that I made that by-passes the date check. Sorry, no NFO. Im just a auto tech myself that needed my estimate program to work with my computer at the shop, ie. by not changing the date!! 


DOWNLOAD Mitchell UltraMate 7 HERE:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5663611


- Just copy & replace original Estimate.exe from C:Mitchellaces with provided Estimate.exe.

- Enjoy!
