,omegafox84,2010-07-03T07:55Z,"yeah, what the heck was that about? that guy was a vip but i didn't see any uploads for him. then the link he gave went to a page with like 6-7 movie torrents that stated they weren't taking new uploaders. i don't get it..."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-07-03T14:50Z,did i miss something?
,simpson_d,2010-07-03T15:01Z,ok seed it and i will take a look and get back to you
,simpson_d,2010-07-03T15:20Z,how am i suposed to see what you have if you don't seed it?
[T],ctang,2010-07-03T15:26Z,"sorry guys, someone closed my laptop last night so i wasnt seeding"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-03T15:50Z,NICE.....now it will be easier to request and thanks for the releases and waiting for the upcoming one........i need lots from the list......
[T],ctang,2010-07-03T15:52Z,@Guymovie: which one are you looking forward too...Men of Honor or Alice In Wonderland?...just curious (or is it another that you are waiting on)
,mrluckyman,2010-07-03T16:04Z,see it wasn't hard to make your movies list :) if u get tired of doing it upload movies list then u can make your moovielive.com profile tho. just don't put real name or where u live u can just make fake profile so nobody will know where u from so i already made my profile with moovielive.  so anyways i noticed u got lot of national lampoon movies but i have national lampoon's senior trip so if u want it i can upload for u.  anyways i would like to request movie from u is: Freedom Writers
[T],ctang,2010-07-03T16:07Z,i can do freedom writers
,mrluckyman,2010-07-03T16:07Z,for now i finally know how to remove fbi warnings completely by using dvdremake then use fixvts for check for error and remove lba and backup then can use dvd9 to dvd5 using dvd2one not dvdshrink anymore... cuz i checked best dvd shrinking tool that telling me dvd2one is number 1 and dvdshrink is number two for best quality movies.
,mrluckyman,2010-07-03T16:13Z,you can use swapadvd.com if u want to change dvds in your movie collection but u can always backup cuz swapdvds.com want original dvd from retail. there's also other site called swaptree.com
[T],ctang,2010-07-03T16:22Z,i may have to look into that
[T],ctang,2010-07-03T17:17Z,mrluckyman: i never have used dvdshrink...i use clonedvd2...trying to figure out how to use DVD-RB as of right now so i can change the bitrate on the bs crap that is on a dvd
,mrluckyman,2010-07-03T17:43Z,why everytime i use clonedvd2 and it said it can't copy protected dvd? or am i use wrong kind of app?  is that one from slysoft right?
[T],ctang,2010-07-03T18:01Z,"no not the one from slysoft...its the one from elby's that slysoft tried to copy

A few have been upped before, but are dead now or are PAL. I know its a lot, the top few are the most important. Whatever you can do would be appreciated. Theres no urgency either, so no rush on anything. Thanks. keep up the good work."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-07-03T21:37Z,"CTANG

why dont you just register on my site like tater & mike did and create your own forum for your followers.  post everything you plan on doing on my site for them to see.  of course they would have to register to communicate with you.

just use ur pirate bay account user name so people know its you and create your forum where mike and tater have theirs. 

itll make life easier.  let me know if you plan on doing it.  i hope you decide to.  it seems like people are interested in you making a site."

[T],ctang,2010-07-04T16:05Z,openoffice.org works great!!!
,rmroberto,2010-07-05T00:08Z,"Hey, thanks for all the movies and the quality of them. I saw your list and I was wondering if you can upload Anchorman and Meet The Spartans (djfred has it but has some extras stripped).
Thanks for all."
[T],ctang,2010-07-05T03:47Z,"im not sure, but i think that the copy of meet the spartans i have is from djfred...i wish i had a list of dvd's that were my personal copies and the ones i got from him or another source other than a disc...i will look though and see if any of the extras are gone bc if they arent then i must have rented it and copied it...will add both to the list"
,omegafox84,2010-07-05T04:14Z,i have the actual dvd of Meet the Spartans and the only extras are 3 trailers (2 for MtS & 1 Futurama). it does have spoofs/outtakes in between credits however.
,rmroberto,2010-07-07T22:18Z,"@omegafox84 Is it the unrated version that you have? Because that is what I downloaded from djfred. It has some extras but not the gag reel and that's what I wanted to see...
Thanks for adding my request I really want Anchorman, it's impossible to get that movie and it's so great and funny"
,omegafox84,2010-07-07T23:07Z,"nope sorry, mines not the unrated. yours should still have the gag reel though since djfred says all extras are included. did you fast forward to the middle of the credits to see if it's there?"
,rmroberto,2010-07-08T22:06Z,is that the gag reel? I thought there were deleted scenes or something like that...
,rmroberto,2010-07-08T22:09Z,"Thought that they were deleted scenes, sorry"
,omegafox84,2010-07-09T02:16Z,"yeah, that\'s the gag reel. atleast you know you have it now. :)"
,rmroberto,2010-07-09T16:35Z,"ok, thanks for the help omegafox84!!!"
,Hitman647,2010-07-21T16:16Z,"Hi. I just read your list. Very, very nice.  Can i make a request sir?  If yes, here are the titles:

Blood Diamond
Collateral
Cool Runnings
Deja V?
Disturbia
Flightplan
Invincible
Madagascar 1, 2
Marley And Me
Mr. and Mrs. Smith
Sweet Home Alabama
The Kingdom 
Behind Enemy Lines 2: Axis of Evil
Hellboy 1, 2
Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy


Also, do you have Sniper (Tom Berenger) and 
Mortal Kombat 1 and 2?

Also, can anyone teach me on how to make a torrent? Do i need a separate software for that? I do not have any idea on how you were able to share your movies.  I want to share also.  I am using an intel celeron 2.4ghz with only 500mb ram. I do not have money to upgrade my setup.  Will this be enough to upload a 4.3gb movie?

Please help me."
[T],ctang,2010-07-26T06:38Z,"ya you have enough to upload a torrent...all you really need is a computer and a decent internet connection along with a torrent application that supports the creation of torrents (most do but some dont)

1.  Get utorrent
2.  hit control-n to create a new torrent
3.  if you are doing a single iso file then hit single file but if you are doing more than one file or a folder with files in it you have to click on directory
4.  select your file or directory
5.  hit ok
6.  find some public trackers (go to trackon.org for some trackers)
7.  since the files will be around 4.37gb if you are doing single layer discs, then you want to choose the piece size to be around 512kb (this will make it so you upload much more efficiently)
8.  hit create
9.  after it creates the torrent, upload it to your favorite torrent hosting site, ie TPB"
,Hitman647,2010-08-01T18:39Z,"Hi ctang. It is me again.

Another question, after the last step (upload it to your favorite torrent hosting site, e.i TPB), do i need to always keep the original file on my PC so that people can still download it or it is already on the server of the hosting site? I only have few gigabytes on my hard drive.  Again, i cannot afford upgrades.  Do i still need to keep the original file(s)?

Thanks for answering my comments / questions."
[T],ctang,2010-08-02T06:22Z,"after you upload the torrent file to a torrent hosting website you can delete it if you want too...as for the other files (i.e. perhaps the dvd files) you must keep them on your computer until their is more than 1 copy shared...just look at the availability...when it gets over 2, it means that more than just your copy is circulating and you can delete it but it is always good to wait until the availability is above 5 or so or wait until their is over 10 seeds...hope this helps!!"
,Hitman647,2010-08-02T17:43Z,"Hi ctang!

Thanks very much for the info.  I hope you will forgive me for being so persistent. Also, please forgive me for giving you a long list of titles. I really love your dvd titles.

Can we make a test? I followed every steps you gave and i uploaded a movie. Vertical Limit.

Can you download this movie? I do not know if you like this movie.  You can delete it if you don't like it. Anyway, can we make a test?

Thanks and i hope to hear from you soon."
,Hitman647,2010-08-03T18:20Z,"hi ctang!

I didn't apply any compression program/software because it will only decrease the quality of the movie.  This is an original DVD i bought from a store.  I really would like to share more of my original DVD but I don't have enough space.  I also noticed that if i really wanted to maximize to my upload speed, I need to stop downloading. It really affects my processor. Huhuhuhu.... Poor guy.

I really need to change my PC.  This is very old. The technician told me that there is no cure for my PC. I have to buy a new one.  The parts are so obsolete.  Grrr..... I feel so small. Hahahaha!!!  Now i know how powerful your setup!  You guys are so great!
"
,BJLD213,2011-07-09T08:29Z,"ctang I really like your sharing spirit. :D  It seems to be lost on most. 

Could you please post Aladdin (1992)? I can't find it anywhere which is wierd. I would think that most parents would need to save a buck because kids are expensive to care for.

Anyways thanks for reading and all you do on here. :D"
