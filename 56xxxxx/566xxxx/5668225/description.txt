July is here already. It's almost the middle of the summer and I'm not in pool-ready shape.

Sad.

But at least I have great music to listen to. And now you do as well.

Not much to say this month except.. enjoy and seed!!

I've been super busy with personal stuff, which is the reason for the late playlist again
this month. Sorry about that. Maybe I'll be early next month to make up for it.
