There's a thin line between catching a criminal... and becoming one.

A black uniformed policeman applies for a special anti-drug squad tasked to take down the highest boss of cocain delivery to LA: the Columbian foreign minister's nephew. This 'ugly side of the war on drugs' explores the context of race, identity and hypocrisy within a brutal and alienating investigation.

Laurence Fishburne, Jeff Goldblum, Charles Martin Smith, Clarence Williams III
