Tommi (11) and his slightly older sister Viola live in the city with their father. They cope with being a single parent family until their mother shows up, having disappeared without trace - not for the first time, we soon learn. These are the four protagonists in a bittersweet portrait of their ongoing struggle with love, friendship, puberty and life in general.
