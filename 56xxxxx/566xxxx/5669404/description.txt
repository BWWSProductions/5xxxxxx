Collection of mini-series staring the current incarnation of Union Jack, Joseph Chapman.  Chapman is the working class son of a shipbuilder, born in Manchester, England.  On a holiday visit to Falsworth Manor he learned of Baron Blood and donned the Union Jack costume to become an adventurer and help Captain America fight the vampire.  With a bullet resistant costume, Chapman usually carries a gun of some variety (changing it as appropriate to the mission) and a silver-edged dagger used for supernatural foes.

In volume 1 Creators Ben Raab (X-Men) and John Cassaday (Planetary, Astonishing X-Men) depict Union Jack's fight against a sect of vampires.

In volume 2 Union Jack has mere hours to prevent multiple terrorist attacks on London by an army of super-villains.  Written by Christos N. Gage (Avengers: The Initiative) and penciled by Mike Perkins (Captain America).
