Movie: 7.5/10

I'll be honest, I only watched it because of Amber Tamblyn, who recently had a guest stint on House. It was a pretty decent movie, but I hated the main character all the way through. Did not understand --SPOILER-- Amber's attraction to him at all.

Also, don't upload screens to ImageShack! It's against their TOS and they take them down."
