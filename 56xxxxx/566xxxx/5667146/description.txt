Meet Dexter Morgan, a polite wolf in sheepâ€™s clothingâ€¦ a monster who cringes at the sight of bloodâ€¦ a serial killer whose one golden rule makes him immensely likable: HE ONLY KILLS BAD PEOPLE.

Dexter Morgan isnâ€™t exactly the kind of man youâ€™d bring home to Mom. Though heâ€™s playful and has a wonderfully ironic sense of humor, Dexterâ€™s one character flaw (his proclivity for murder) can be off-putting. But at heart Dexter is the perfect gentleman, supportive of his sister, Deb, a Miami cop, and interested only in doing away with people who really deserve his special visit. Dex is quite good-looking but totally indifferent to (and, frankly, a bit puzzled by) the attention paid to him by women. Despite the fact that he cantâ€™ stand the sight of blood, he works as a blood-splatter analyst for the Mmiami police department, a job that allows him to keep tabs on the latest crimes and keep an eye open for his next quarry.

Dexterâ€™s well-organized life is suddenly disrupted when a second, much more visible serial killer appears in Miami. Dex is intrigued, even delighted, by the fact that the other killer appears to have a style reminiscent of his own. Yet he canâ€™t help but feel that the mysterious new arrival is not merely invading his turf but reaching out to him as well. This new killer seems to be doing more tha copying Dexterâ€”he seems to be saying, â€œCome out and play.â€ Dexterâ€™s secret life makes for a lonely existenceâ€¦ even a lovable monster can be intrigued by the prospect of finding a friend.

Introducing one of the most witty and orginial narrators in years, Jeff Lindsayâ€™s Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a fresh, surprising, and brilliantly executed novel.

Heâ€™s a charming monster . . .
A macabre hero . . .
A serial killer who only kills bad people

Dexter Morgan has been under considerable pressure. Itâ€™s just not easy being an ethical serial killerâ€”especially while trying to avoid the unshakable suspicions of the dangerous Sergeant Doakes (who believes Dexter is a homicidal maniac . . . which, of course, he is). In an attempt to throw Doakes off his trail, Dexter has had to slip deep into his foolproof disguise. While not working as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, he now spends nearly all his time with his cheerful girlfriend, Rita, and her two children, sipping light beer and slowly becoming the worldâ€™s first serial couch potato. But how long can Dexter play Kick the Can instead of Slice the Slasher? How long before his Dark Passenger forces him to drop the charade and let his inner monster run free?

In trying times, opportunity knocks. A particularly nasty psychopath is cutting a trail through Miamiâ€”a man whose twisted technique leaves even Dexter speechless. As Dexterâ€™s dark appetite is revived, his sister, Deborah (a newly minted, tough-as-nails Miami detective) is drawn headlong into the case. It quickly becomes clear that it will take a monster to catch a monsterâ€”but it isnâ€™t until his archnemesis is abducted that Dex can finally throw himself into the search for a new plaything. Unless, of course, his plaything finds him first . . .

With the incredible wit and freshness that drew widespread acclaim to Darkly Dreaming Dexter, Jeff Lindsay now takes Dexter Morgan to a new level of macabre appeal and gives us one of the most original, colorful narrators in years.

DEXTER IN THE DARK

   1. ISBN-10: 0307276732
   2. ISBN-13: 978-0307276735

In his work as a Miami crime scene investigator, Dexter Morgan is not unaccustomed to seeing evil deedsâ€¦particularly because, on occasion, he commits them himself. Guided by his Dark Passenger (the reptilian voice inside him), he lives his outwardly normal life adhering to one simple rule: he only kills very bad people. But Dexterâ€™s happy existence is turned upside-down when he is called to a particularly disturbing crime scene at the university campus. Dexterâ€™s Dark Passenger immediately senses something it recognizes, something utterly chilling, and the Dark Passengerâ€”mastermind of Dexterâ€™s investigative and homicidal prowessâ€”goes into hiding.

Dexter is alone for the first time in his life, and he realizes heâ€™s being hunted by an adversary more sinister than anything heâ€™s ever faced. Dexter must summon his sharpest investigative powers not only to pursue his enemy, but to locateâ€”and truly understandâ€”his Dark Passenger. It is nothing less than a search for his own dark soulâ€¦fueled by a steady supply of cream-filled donuts.

Macabre, ironic, and wonderfully entertaining, DEXTER IN THE DARK goes deeper into the dark psyche of one of the freshest protagonists in recent fiction.

   2. ISBN-13: 978-0385518369

The macabre, witty New York Times bestselling series (and inspiration for the #1 Showtime series, Dexter) continues as our darkly lovable killer matches wits with a sadistic artisteâ€”who is creating bizarre murder tableaux of his own all over Miami.

After his surprisingly glorious honeymoon in Paris, life is almost normal for Dexter Morgan. Married life seems to agree with him: heâ€™s devoted to his bride, his stomach is full, and his homicidal hobbies are nicely under control. But old habits die hardâ€”and Dexterâ€™s work as a blood spatter analyst never fails to offer new temptations that appeal to his offbeat sense of justiceâ€¦and his Dark Passenger still waits to hunt with him in the moonlight.

The discovery of a corpse (artfully displayed as a sunbather relaxing on a Miami beach chair) naturally piques Dexterâ€™s curiosity and Miamiâ€™s finest realize theyâ€™ve got a terrifying new serial killer on the loose. And Dexter, of course, is back in business.
