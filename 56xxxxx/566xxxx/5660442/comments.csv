,fizdude,2010-07-01T05:09Z,Thanks a lot!  Is there any way you could use .avi in stead of .mpg?  It takes up less space.  We're definitely fans of your work!

I'm using WinTV USB2 with it's own PVR to record, I find that recording in AVI *REALLY* bogs my system down, and I've had it lock up a few times. From what I see, the size difference between AVI and MPG is nominal.  
If I can find a better solution to the setup I have, I'd be happy to oblige, but for the moment I think I should stick with what's working best. I'm definitely open to suggestions!"

I (barely) got AVI working... 60 seconds of video takes up 14,080KB, while 60 seconds of MPG1 VCD video only takes 9,852KB. 
Unfortunately WinTV USB2/Software PVR is an old unsupported product, and there are no newer drivers, and it doesn't want to play nice with any available codecs. 
I'll be sticking with MPG output to keep it lightweight. "
