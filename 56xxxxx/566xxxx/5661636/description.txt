Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in 1968, consisting of Jimmy Page (guitar),[1] Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal[2] and hard rock.[3][4] However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre.[5] Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of "album-oriented rock".[6]

Thirty years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide,[7][8] including 111.5 million certified units in the United States,[9] making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top 10 of the Billboard album chart in the US, with six reaching the number one spot.[10] Led Zeppelin are ranked #1 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock[11] and Classic Rock's 50 Best Live Acts of All Time.[12] Rolling Stone magazine has described Led Zeppelin as "the heaviest band of all time", "the biggest band of the '70s" and "unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history".[2][13] Similarly, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes the band being "as influential in that decade (70s) as The Beatles were in the prior one".[14]

In 2007, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with deceased drummer John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet ErtegÃ¼n Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London. The band was honoured with the "Best Live Act" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008,[15] where they were declared the "greatest rock n' roll band of all time"

Led Zeppelin Remasters is a 2-CD compilation album of remastered material by English rock group Led Zeppelin. It was initially released in the UK and Japan by Atlantic Records on 15 October 1990. The album is essentially a scaled-down version of the 4-CD Led Zeppelin boxed set.

This compilation set came about as a result of the initially rushed conversion of Led Zeppelin's album to the compact disc format in the late 1980s. Led Zeppelin were among the first rock bands to be re-issued on CD, but such was the haste to capitalise on the new format that the new CDs were derived not from re-equalised master tapes, but from sound-generation tapes that had been eqalised for the original vinyl platters.[1] For this 1990 reissue, Led Zeppelin guitarist and producer Jimmy Page himself supervised the mastering process, which was based on Led Zeppelin's archive of master tapes.
