* In preparation for Operation Harvest Red, U.S. Marine Corps' Force Recon are deployed into Chenarus behind enemy lines to weaken the defenses for the main force. Among the marines is Sgt. Cooper of Razor Team led by MSgt. Miles. Razor's mission was to conduct a raid on the town of Pusta to disrupt enemy communications in preparation for the main assault force. During the raid, it was revealed that the Red Star Movement have been conducting acts of genocide and war crimes in Chenarus.

The secondary task of Razor Team is to unite government Chernarussian Defence Forces (CDF) and the National Party (NAPA) forces, led by Prizrak who are hostile to each other at the beginning.

Dependent on whether Razor Team eliminated Prizrak who is opposing the alliance between CDF and NAPA and Lopotev, the campaign is said to have four different endings, ranging from complete victory to the elimination of Razor Team by the victorious "Chedakis".
