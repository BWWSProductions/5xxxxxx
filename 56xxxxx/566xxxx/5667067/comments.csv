,darkfenix619,2010-07-03T20:42Z,"Is this actually The arrowhead expansion? , I ask because the description is the explanation of the original arma 2."
,m0vie__dr,2010-07-03T20:53Z,"thankyou for another great release globe i have downloaded well over 30 of your directplay games for the pc there just great, thankyou again for your hard work i will seed as long as needed "
[V],globeplus,2010-07-03T23:13Z,"This file have 100% of the gameplay including the expansion that have a perfect interactivy with the common files of the games but no patch , i repeat : everything just not the patch and to play the single player mode is ok ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-03T23:19Z,"To azoking : yo probably right but even saying that i challenge you to get that giga less that i getted , what i mean without trying to implicate is that even a giga less is already positive and still a giga anyway , on this particular game doing some work is almost impossible but the original iso have 7.74 gb because a non-latest patch 1.06 , the latest is 1.07 but for this file the patch probably can´t be apllied but no big losses with that and to play the single player is ok , this game is included between the small percentage of games that are tough to compress or work .

Happy gaming , i know that is normal better work but leave that at the side on this particular game and still 2.31 gb less than the original iso ."
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-07-04T01:30Z,"Hey globe, where are you from?
Clearly english isn't your natural language"
[V],globeplus,2010-07-04T02:19Z,"To the genius.of.the.hole :  my english is acceptable , i am not trying to look like a diplomat or something but i think the users get a nice idea about what i am speaking , what is important is not where are you from but the work that you do ."
,UB1985,2010-07-04T06:20Z,Big one. But thank you. 
,vaibhav3,2010-07-04T07:12Z,"hello globe
i asked u about APB
all points bulletin which is already launched will u upload it"
[V],globeplus,2010-07-04T12:02Z,"To vaibhav3 : i think you lost the notion that you are talking about a massive multiplayer online that needs a key to run , they have a beta installer , you can go to site of the game and try to play but for torrents the game is not that easy specially to the users play .

To azoking and sakti01 :  no problem , i don´t mind to work nice pc games but this one wasn´t really easy but it is ok , still more than 2 giga off comparing to the original iso . Thank you for your comments .

Happy gaming ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-04T23:20Z,"It is not only compression is some work too to get this size , i know irtis not the best of sizes and i normaly do better than this but if the help on the file stay like this can really be the last time i upload a game that is more tough to work , no matter how many suggestions i get to do the work , i know it is the best of the sizes but still more than 2 giga less for this game !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-07-04T23:24Z,"It is not only compression is some work too to get this size , i know irtis not the best of sizes and i normaly do better than this but if the help on the file stay like this can really be the last time i upload a game that is more tough to work , no matter how many suggestions i get to do the work , i know it is the best of the sizes but still more than 2 giga less for this game !!!

And more no one of you can´t say that don´t appreciate to have seeds to download the file !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-07-05T03:23Z,"it looks the number of seeds improved a little bit , i hope stays like that to be better for everyone download . "
[V],globeplus,2010-07-05T09:44Z,To mutad1 :  you have to run the reg file included .
,sh1dowfax,2010-07-05T11:39Z,"Hi, is this Operation Arrowhead or original Arma 2? also im on 386 kbps line speed so will take a long time, so wonder if better to get other torrent as im only downloading 3-4kbps at the moment or am i doing something wrong?"
[V],globeplus,2010-07-05T18:07Z,"To sh1dowfax :  you can read operation arrowhead on the name , the file have the common arma 2 files and the expansion pack but no patches , so beside the patch fpr precaution and the long size of the file anyway everything else about the game is included .

Note : i hope for the future of the file and for a better download of the file downloaders that the seeds keep improving if it is possible : i repeat i know that is this game wasn´t possible the best of the sizes but still more than 2 giga less than the original iso ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-06T01:07Z,"OK ,THIS WAS THE LAST TIME THAT I WORK A GAME WITH THIS CARACHTERISTICS INDEPENDTLY OF THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS , THIS IS ONE OF THE CASES THAT I AM ASHAMED TO WORK HARD AND UPLOAD FILES . 

SEE ALL OF YOU ."
,sh1dowfax,2010-07-06T10:50Z,"globeplus, thank you for your hard work. We all appreciate it. I have been waiting for this game for a long time and have a slow download speed so you help me a lot by compressing titles. Its just that there are no seeders which is not your fault so im getting 5kbps."
,roshan821,2010-07-07T08:08Z,To the people who cry about the size please go and download some other torrent..the man has put in some serious efforts trying to reduce the file size by 2 gb ..am sure there are lots of people like me who appreciate it....  globeplus  thanks for the rip and please don stop...

[V],globeplus,2010-07-07T20:35Z,"To gIobeplus :  i uploaded the FFXII because the new XIII final fantasy wasn´t available for pc , for the moment the new final fantasy is only xbox360 in 3 discs and PS3 , i didn´t mind to the work but not possible on the pc yet , is no way that you can run the game on the pc for the moment ."

,genraldon,2010-07-27T03:40Z,"thx globe for your hard work. SEED PEOPLE SEED!! getting 26 kb/s   better than sh1dowfax at 5, though."
,DriestBiscuit,2010-08-05T02:18Z,globe i appreciate you hard work but the game crashes to the desktop many times  i think other people are having this problem a answer would be very apreciated :D
,UrbanProtocol,2010-08-05T12:51Z,"Yep, I'm getting regular CTD's in campaign and scenario mode. Even after updating to 1.52 (yes it is possible!) Halp!

Usually your torrents rock Globe, this is the only one I'm having problems with :("
,yodoodle,2010-08-11T17:51Z,"thanks for this, works for me... 
just wanna how i mount this as i see no .iso?
would prefer to install this than run the exe also once ive installed do i remove the registry entries reg1 64bits/reg2 64bits that came with this?"
,yodoodle,2010-08-13T03:01Z,"hey globe, ive made this to an .iso through magiciso and put it on a dvd+r, but when i put it in my pc it doesnt boot but opens the installation folder how do i install this to my hd like a normal game? your help will be much appreciated."
,yodoodle,2010-08-15T16:26Z,"just to make people aware...
bootcamp works fine, armory works fine, scenario works fine for about 10mins before crashing and only the prologue in campaign works. 
So i would recommend steering clear of this until globe or someone from the community gives us a solution"
,yodoodle,2010-08-16T05:34Z,"@globeplus 
if it helps im running w7 64bit
extracted this to C/program files 86/arma 2 operation arrowhead extracted reg there as well
ran reg 1 64bit then reg 2 64bit"
,Oo0oO,2010-12-22T10:53Z,can i update this ?
,Wazoo000000,2010-12-22T17:01Z,"I'm downloading this, will come back to say if it worked.

The other Arma OA torrents are impossible to install for me"
,CraigWL,2010-12-23T01:04Z,"Hi, this has been downloading for a while and i will seed when done, i just wanted to know if this is just operation arrowhead or both Arma 2 and OA."
,Wazoo000000,2010-12-23T02:29Z,"This download didnt work for me.

I used freearc. The followed the instructions.
I placed and ran both regs. then tried to start the .exe file but it didnt work.

I'm used to .iso files too not just a .exe."
,Wazoo000000,2010-12-23T03:05Z,"Do i need to do an extra crack or some? 
I run the reg's but the .exe file just doesnt respond normally.
"
,CraigWL,2010-12-24T16:52Z,"Ok, it eventually finished downloading. Sadly heres what happened


After eventually getting the game to run, i tried to start up the campaign. The opening cutscene ran fine but as the first actual mission began it had a CTD.  I then reloaded the game and ran scenario mode, when i clicked on scenarios it crashed.  i reloaded again and tried scenarios and it ran for about 5 minutes before crashing. Editor mode for me either crashed on click or crashed when finished loading.  Armory and Boot Camp run perfectly.

Its a shame, such an excellent game and so much hard work by globe to trim it down has resulted in numerous CTDs.  I wish there was a fix."
,CraigWL,2010-12-24T16:55Z,"Heres what happens in the game:

Armory: Works fine

Boot Camp: Works fine

Campaign: Gets through the prologue but crashes on the opening cutscene on the first mission

Scenarios: Will work for about 5 minutes then will crash, also once or twice it crashed when you actually click the word Scenarios

Editor: Will either crash on click or crash when fully loaded

Its a shame, this game is excellently made and to have so much effort from globe and such great gameplay go down the drain is a massive disappointment for all parties involved

Wish there was a fix."
