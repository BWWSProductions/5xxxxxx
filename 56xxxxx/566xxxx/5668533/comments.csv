,brunohll,2010-10-15T08:51Z,"@naylor35:
Just the fact that you asked how to seed probably means you couldn't install it correctly. 
I'll still give it a try. Thanks for the share belterbry!"
,brunohll,2010-10-15T18:10Z,Yup! Works like a charm. Thanks again!
,ladyjane24,2010-11-26T12:55Z,"Hi, Cannot get this to run on my computer if i try to open it it just opens disc burner, can anyone help please?"
,belterbry,2010-11-29T01:11Z,"It will more than likely be because you are trying to burn the image onto a normal dvdr, but you need a dual layer disk to burn it onto as the file is 6.52gb. Your best bet is to just use daemon tools to run the program though, its free and saves wasting discs"
,serialhacker,2011-01-15T18:43Z,Wow a huge size. And guess what!?!?! No seeders. *DEATH TO ALL LEECHERS* 
,emo1987,2011-03-19T17:58Z,thanks bud 
,laned130,2011-05-20T12:07Z,"I passed ;-)
48/50 for theory - 96%
65/75 for HP - 87% - 57/75 is the pass mark for instructors :-)

Many thanks for the up, belterbry!

P.S. Ignore naylor35 - this works great. As it says, just mount iso and install - no key needed.
P.P.S. There are several bugs in the software. These might be solved by registering and updating, but I delayed the registration and can't find how do it manually, so when it pops up again (3 weeks, I think), I'll let you know how that goes."
,reah2011,2011-07-07T22:55Z,is this for the UK test or American tests??
,Redmagedon,2011-09-23T04:33Z,"Sorry to post this here but there used to be an LDC driving theory torrent on TPB but its been removed. I found the same program on another site but nobodys seeding. Has anyone got a link to an LDC 2010/11 torrent that might download quicker...PLEASE, my bf's got his test coming up and he really needs the help LOL"
,tentacle.love,2011-10-18T21:34Z,"Did uk car theory & hazard yesterday, there are questions in the mock theory of this torrent which appeared in the test. Most which did not were about mechanics of the vehicle.

None of the hazard i did appear in the torrent but the mock hazard in this torrent helped figure out the quirks of the test a lot- you need to click a few times when you see a hazard."
