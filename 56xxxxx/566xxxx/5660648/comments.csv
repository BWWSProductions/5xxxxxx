,Tarciryan,2010-07-25T09:59Z,"I would like to ask if someone has experienced any issues with the audio? In the beginning it keeps skipping alot for me. If noone else has experienced this it is an issue on my side.

At any rate, thanks alot for upload, the video quality is very good!"

,waluigi1110,2010-11-26T01:58Z,"Excellent torrent
and @Tarciryan you can never be sure with torrent, sometimes you get a corrupted chunk cuz some a-hole whos seeding decides to fuck up there copy with a hex editor, and sometimes you just get a really choppy download (one of the only downsides of torrenting) but i guess that is a price to pay for free movies!"

,NilsolovNilsson,2011-01-04T14:28Z,"Worked perfectly for me, good quality on both sound and video"
,Gam8it8,2011-02-23T19:50Z,"Great quality but let down slightly by the 3 second freeze at 1 hour 28 minutes, the audio carried on but the video just stopped. I rewound it to see if it was my computer and froze in the same place. But aside from that there were no problems at all.
Even with the slight freeze I still give it a 10/10 because it was such good quality generally."
,watisthis,2011-03-14T20:16Z,"This is what piracy is all about.
Good content, good quality, no bullshit.
A bottle of rum for you sir."

Also, @m4ndibl3, I'm pretty sure he was just saying that he's serving in persian gulf and can't see the movie with torrents. Export restrictions or maybe just can't buy over there."
