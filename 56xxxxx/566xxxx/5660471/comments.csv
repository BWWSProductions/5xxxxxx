Considering Openbittorrent has been quite upsy-downsy lately :)nnI know there\'s the whole speculations where more peers = bigger swarm != better transfer.nnBrings up a point though, this could be seen as some good load testing for both the \""client\"" side (utorrent, azureus, etc....) as well as the \""tracker\"" end - which in this case, OpenBT gets to be the labrat :)"
