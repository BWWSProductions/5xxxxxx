Scream is Ozzy Osbourne's first album in three years and 10th studio album overall. The album was produced by OZZY and Kevin Churko, both of whom did the same honors for OZZY's 2007 worldwide million-seller Black Rain, the album. The multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer recorded most of the album at his Los Angeles home studio, The Bunker, and co-wrote all the songs, primarily with Churko. Notably, the album marks the first appearance of OZZY's new guitar player, Gus G. OZZY's band also features bassist Blasko, drummer Tommy Clufetos and keyboardist Adam Wakeman.
