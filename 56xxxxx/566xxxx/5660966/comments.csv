,gnetix,2011-04-08T17:21Z,Can someone give me a working tracker for this torrent? I've tried to download for a while now and the trackers will never connect. The seed status keeps changing though. I'm not sure why or how.
,gnetix,2011-04-23T01:32Z,"It's been 2 weeks and the seed/leech ratio STILL changes by only 1-2 people then goes back up. I don't see how anyone is connecting so this must be fake. 

Not to mention that it's the only copy online (anywhere) of this file size. The only one and this one is the only one that has very (as in NEVER seen before) activity going on. Just want to let everyone know. 

@ maker4, paste some working trackers in the comment section if this is real. Or anyone for that matter. "
,gnetix,2011-09-09T22:25Z,LOL!! I figured it out. I use private trackers and I had to have peer exchange turned on to download. This is what I have been looking for. Great quality!! Thanks!!
