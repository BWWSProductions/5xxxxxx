Synopsis

HuxleyÂ´s vision of the future in his astonishing 1931 novel Brave New World â€” a world of tomorrow in which capitalist civilization has been reconstituted through the most efficient scientific and psychological engineering.
New York Times Book Review

Huxley uses his erudite knowledge of human relations to compare our actual world with his prophetic fantasy of 1931. It is a frightening experience, indeed, to discover how much of his satirical prediction of a distant future became reality in so short a time.
