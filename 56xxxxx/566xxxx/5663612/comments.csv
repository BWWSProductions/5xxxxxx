,BoomyBoom,2010-07-28T21:01Z,"Another typical goofy black cop, stuffy old white cop movie. Uh...48 hours, Lethal Weapon, I-Spy, Bad Company, Showtime, National Security, Rush Hour, Nothing to Lose, Money Talks, Exit Wounds, OMG the list goes on. Take all of those and combine them into the ultimate cliche copper flick, and this is what you get. LAME LAME LAME. On the plus side, Sean William Scott is as hilarious as he usually is. I think Kevin Smith must have been on some kind of drunken binge to write this crap. And Bruce Willis could TRY to do something besides be a damn ""hardass"" cop in every damn flick he is in. He even sounds tired of it himself, when he is using the radio in his car, there is a clear overtone of self-disgust in his voice. "

,61stylo,2011-03-27T07:51Z,Can everyone stop talking about how fast the stupid download was and tell something about the movie. buttlickers.
,61stylo,2011-03-27T10:32Z,This movie is so bad that I don't even want the pirated version.
,ManLemon,2011-03-31T19:44Z,"Erhm, what's the use of posting scores if everyone is going to say 10 10 10 etc. Be reasonable. Yes, it is a good rip, but most definitely NOT a 10 in anyway (nor the quality, nor the film itself). 

V= 7
A= 8
M= 6 (and that is being generous)"
