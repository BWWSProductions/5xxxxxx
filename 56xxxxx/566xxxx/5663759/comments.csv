,Agnogenic,2010-07-02T10:49Z,"Okay, I understand wanting credit or advertising for the video but having a myspace link pop up throughout the movie? Seriously?"
,112488,2010-07-02T11:14Z,@philipinas the fist 3 mins and 30 seconds are nightmare on elmstreet for some reason but the rest is twilight eclipse. the video is about 6 or 7 and the audio is about 4 because it is loud which causes distortion. it is watchable but i am going to wait a few days for the TS version
,112488,2010-07-02T11:15Z,it is real..just skip past the first 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

,peanuts4snoopy,2010-07-02T17:45Z,Does anyone have just a copy of the audio for the movie. The russian download is amost perfect and I already have it...but I am wondering if someone just have the english audio cause I can sync the two together and make a great copy...like v-9 and depending on the audio source anywhere from 6 to 8
,Pavlov1988,2010-07-02T18:09Z,"don't worry it is NOT a nightmare on elm street. 
the first 90seconds is, but after that its all shiny vampyres. so fret not.
quality is pretty good for an ENGLISH AUDIO cam....A5///V7
i'm on vlc and i turn the volume way down just to make sure that my headphones don't get all blown out and distorted haha. 
overall VERY good quality for a cam less than 72hrs after release. "

,djdlux2005,2010-07-03T07:07Z,"Real but one of the worst cams as far as audio....sounds like my surround sound is going to explode, and is the same exact copy as the other dark innocence group release.....usually I'm OK with cams but the audio is real bad.  I'd say 3, with Video at 7

Big Ups for the upload.....I just wish the audio was better so it would be enjoyable."
,rappling,2010-07-03T09:30Z,"Hey guy, thanks for the upload, and its really great that you wrote a book, but don't spam shit to buy it. I'm going to pirate it like every other byte in my  4 terabyte library of media , and I'll donate to you if I like it. Cheers :)"

Sound is horrifyingly load and vibrates bad. Video is highly contrasted. Video is watchable and I have seeded for 1.2 ratio. For those whom are currently downloading. I will continue to seed for a few more hours."
,theguitarslut,2010-07-05T01:09Z,"worst torrent the picture/sound is terrible and whoever this dark innocence guy is, is a real derrow and needs to get a life"
,HeavyMist,2010-07-06T06:51Z,Hopefully The Audio and Video will workout alright for me Ill rate for you guys even though theres a couple of ratings posted already
