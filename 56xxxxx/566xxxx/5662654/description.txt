PLEASE READ NOTES:

First of all work here is purely on the credit of prisM! They have done a blinding job of all sync and video work done, I have merely done a few tweaks using their source mostly to the audio and parts to video.

Second note:

I know I said in my last nfo that this is it regarding encoding! This is purely for a purpose, this may be a one trip pony lol who knows. Those of who know me will see the reason behind this whilst viewing my screenshots I post :)

Work done:

The first thing I have done is to remove the audio and I ran it through Goldwave and removed that constant hiss that was running the whole way through, I then remuxed it back to the original source. Now I noticed in prisM's original nfo they stated they had done alot of work to this video which is obvious to see. All I have done is I added a slight more sharpening added a bit more colour saturation, I have also played with a few colours individually i,e lowered the red and yellow. I lowered the RGB black base a touch and increased some lighting levels.
