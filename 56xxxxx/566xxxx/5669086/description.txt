Operations Golden Rules

Golden Rules have always guided human activities.
In early aviation days, the Operations Golden Rules defined the principles of basic airmanship.
With the development of modern-technology aircraft and with research on man-machine-interface and crew-coordination, Operations Golden Rules have been broadened to encompass the principles of interaction with automation and crew resources management (CRM).
The operations Golden Rules defined by Airbus assist trainees in maintaining their basic airmanship as they progress to increasingly integrated and automated aircraft models.
These rules apply with little modification to all Airbus models.
Although developed for trainees, the Operations Golden Rules are equally useful for experienced line pilots.
