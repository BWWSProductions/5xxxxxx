I WILL NEVER EVER PLAY THAT GAME GREPOLIS. IT PROBABLY SUCKS, BUT EVEN IF IT IS THE GREATEST GAME IN THE WORLD I WILL NEVER CLICK THAT BANNER. THAT'S THE MOST ANNOYING COMMERCIAL EVER!

just search for the firefox add-on ""addblock"" and subscribe to 3 or more countries. That will elliminate all these adds.

and if you aren't using firefox, then you are just stupid i guess :P because no smart person would still be using internet exploder

have fun"
