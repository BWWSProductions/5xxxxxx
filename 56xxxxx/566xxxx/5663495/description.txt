Looked everywhere for this and managed to find it on a random site a few weeks back.

Thought I would share it as i'm sure there will be people out there who also tried to find it seeing as Karl has become very popular now thanks to Ricky Gervais.......

This is the full book in pdf format - Includes all images and is 220 pages long. I'm been reading through Stanza on the Iphone - font is decent enough size, you just have to zoom in a tiny bit, but tablet/iPad/Pc viewing its perfect :)

Enjoy and please seed for a bit, its only 10 meg :D
