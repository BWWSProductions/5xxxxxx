Hi Guys,
This Is Saggi Here...
I Have Brought This CFG To Reduce Ping While Playing CS Online...
Works On: CS 1.6 & CS - Condition Zero...
Now, You Can Enjoy Playing Low Pings Online...


1. First Unzip The File "Saggi's Ping CFG"

2. Copy PING.cfg file to the CSTRIKE folder
    (to the folder where you have these files: config.cfg, autoexec.cfg, libist.gam, server.cfg etc.)
    Normally:  (C:Program FilesCounter Strike - 1.6cstrike)

2. Run Counter-Strike and in the game open console (in order to do it press the tilde [~])

3. Write exec ping.cfg and press ENTER

4. That's all! Certainly you will notice lower ping and more FPS


Note: This Is Not A Hack, So You Cant Get Kicked Or Banned From Any Server...
You Can Play Via Steam & Non-Steam. The File Is Clean Without Bug
