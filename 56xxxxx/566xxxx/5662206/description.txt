Well, here it is! I had this discussion with Shawn quite some time ago (about two months ago), but I haven't posted it into my podcast... until now. "Joe, why did you wait so long to post this discussion??" Several reasons, and you can read the details in my "letter to listeners" which was released on September 20, 2009. The main reason was because if you just listen to what we talked about, you won't learn much. The objective of this program is to help Christians and non-Christians alike see the arguments for, and against, Christianity. The problem with this particular discussion is that Shawn brought up many different points that I either have never heard before, or have heard so rarely I did not know exactly how to combat them, at least not at that time. So, I made this video file, and there are over 70 text slides throughout our hour-long conversation which give you some explanation and further research into Shawn's arguments, and my explanations. However, I should warn you... some of the slides may have small font, and it will perhaps be difficult for you to read the text on a small iPod screen. I would recommend watching this video on a computer screen, so that you are able to read the text comments that go along with our conversation. If you have the time and interest, I would recommend maybe just listening to our discussion first, without reading the text, forming your own thoughts and opinions, and then go back and play the video again, reading the text comments that are included with the audio. Thanks for watching! And, I would like to offer one final apology that it took so long for this episode to be created. I know there were several of my listeners getting anxious and wanting to see the finished product. I hope and pray that after watching this video, you decide that it was truly worth the wait!
