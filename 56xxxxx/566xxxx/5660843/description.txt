Four more rare records to enhance your collection of lost 80s music. In my opinion, 80's music especially from 1979 to 1974 was like an explosion, an explosion of talented and innovatives bands, most of which remained obscure, were dropped or got overlooked. I will continue with this series as long as there's interest out there as there are still many records that can fit in to this series. Records from the bands that deserve recognition though 3 decades late!
