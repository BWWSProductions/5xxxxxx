Just re dicovered Dectetive and Silverhead and ask my self why? Keep up the great work and if you want to expand into the 70's you have my vote Cheers and happy Canada Day!!"
[V],80zforever,2010-07-01T20:07Z,"The8Ts, these are two different bands. The 3-D you mentioned had a few singles. The band fronted by Jon Corner  (Vocals, Bass & Sax)
John Reynolds (Lead Guitar & Backing Vocals)
Steve Spurgin (Keyboards & Backing Vocals). They were from the UK and released only the songs you stated. Their songs were produced by Hayes and Nocito who later formed Johnny Hates Jazz with Clark Datchler."
