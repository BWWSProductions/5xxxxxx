The Black Packet - Tech Info - Volume 1 - Hacking Freedom and Safety

NOTE: These videos are all recent, not OLD technology and most have great info that is timeless.


This torrent was created to introduce those in the truth community to various forms of hacking. I have hand
picked only videos and tutorials which I think will apply to those preparing for tragedy, martial law, large
EMP events, and overall survival. Many of the skills found on this DVD could save your life, be useful for 
hacktivism, or help you setup your own communications network. I focused mostly on talks which were not too
technical for those who are not computer programmers, and many in fact do not need the use of a PC (my fav).

Topics include, voting systems, electronic billboards, picking locks, HAM radio, keeping yourself self secure
on social networks, survival skills from a hacker perspective, hacking with just your eyes, creating ID's
will full security features, police procedure, how constitutional laws apply in the digital age and much more.

See below for complete listing.

Enjoy, and feel free to ask questions if you have them!
