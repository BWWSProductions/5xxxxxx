If someone has a better version, it would be most appreciated.  Alexander Scourby has got the best voice for this.  He was a great actor.  He doesn't overdo it; he had it just right.  No one has been able to do it better.  He had Shakespeare training, so he knows how to take the KJV and make it sound like everyday conversation."
