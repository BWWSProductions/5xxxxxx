Documents released in 2006 show that in 1946 the secret
service was concerned about a plot by Jewish terrorists
to assassinate UK Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin.

Mike Thomson tracked down former members of the Irgun
and the Stern Gang terrorist groups and found that Bevin
was not the only government minister in danger of murder.

The question is, how close did the terrorists get?
