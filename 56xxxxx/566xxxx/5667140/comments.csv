,wellwhynot,2010-07-06T07:56Z,"guys  I received my first abuse warning from Charter reg. true blood torrents.  I use peerblock almost 100% of the time and must have missed one day of seeding or something.  I immediately rcv'd abuse email from Charter with detailed info pointing at my IP, file name, protocol, torrent client etc.  I in no way intend to stop of course but I will be running peer block 100% for sure and encrypted connect only.  Want to see the abuse email content?"
