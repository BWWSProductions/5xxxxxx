,torenz,2010-07-04T02:31Z,thank you.. could you recomend anything to help block my ip? 
,-RLe,2010-07-04T04:55Z,torenz if you are using Windows Xp Vista or Windows 7 peerblock is good ip filter. On linux I use moblock. For a Mac I wouldn't know. You can also add ip filter directly to utorrent and most other bittorrent clients now too.
