Can you please tell me what I'm doing wrong. Thank you and keep doing a great job. have a good one."

,ChetanG,2010-08-27T22:21Z,"Hey Guys,
Your virus software/spyware is stopping the patch from working.

Disable or un-install the virus software after disconneting from the internet.

Place the patch in the Network Magic folder.

Make sure the firewall is turned off as well and Windows Defender.

Good Luck"
,ChetanG,2010-08-27T22:22Z,"Also, I had difficulty installing it in Win7 until I did what I mentioned just above.

Which is un-installing the virus software."
,chubabear,2010-08-28T10:59Z,"downloaded, turned off internet and anti-virus, patched, said it patched fine, still asks me for key. what's up?"
,DaFerg,2010-09-18T18:43Z,"Patch window corrupted.  The patch window comes up but is not the correct size and is not re-sizeable.  I can see the text window, but I can't see any button that will 'run' the patch.  The ""X"" on the top right is barly visable to close the application.  Have tired on 3 diff resolution settings."

,garytn9988,2011-06-25T19:18Z,My Mcafee Virus scan is detecting a trojan on the patch (PATCH.EXE - Generic.dx!tsk (Trojan).  Does anyone have a clean version on the patch? Or is the patch clean but Mcafee is detecting a false positive? How do I tell?
