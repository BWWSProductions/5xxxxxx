I would like to ask you to spread this files because Prentice Hall requires a textbook code that only exists at the original book at the second page.

If in the future this torrent is not supported by seeders ( i hope not!!) then you can retrieve the files from this location ---> http://www.mgiurdas.gr/book-458.aspx

The page is a Greek Publisher but the content for the Student Resources its in English as in my torrent for the 4th Edtion.

Have fun studing :)"
