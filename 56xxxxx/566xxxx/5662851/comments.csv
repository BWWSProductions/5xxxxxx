,xXdiabloXx,2010-07-02T08:34Z,"i bet its japanese the english version of this game release on september 7, 2010"
,khattam,2010-07-02T11:54Z,No its Japanese Version with English subtitles
,kakalbo123,2010-07-02T16:45Z,really?how betterr than the one below your torrent because his was a few subs and most description
,JCM366,2010-07-03T00:50Z,bro is there a subtitle until the end?
,FernFrond,2010-07-03T22:09Z,Does it work for Gen D3 also or is it specifically patched for 5.0. IF so I'll just put the 510 eboot on and flash whenever I want to play it.
,FernFrond,2010-07-04T06:45Z,Doesn't seem to work on Gen D3 which makes sense. I put the .eboot for 5.0 cfw in and ill downgrade whenever i feel like it at with the flasher. Ty for upload
,roloa,2010-07-05T06:57Z,"Guys the game works it has some subtitles on English but most of the game is on Japanese ... Menus and Game-play explanations on English ...
Full intro on Japanese so play only if you are on some kind of a need to finish the game xD"

I'm very much a noob with PSP."
,mrtnik,2010-07-25T23:55Z,Forget it. I updated the firmware and now it works. Thanks for the upload!!
