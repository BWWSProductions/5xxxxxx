,spunkster,2010-12-14T19:42Z,"obiwancanblome, noname390 is right. It's not the video, it's your computer. Mine is old too and most hi res stuff skips and freezes. You can:
1-get a new computer
2- get a new processor and video card to speed up your computer (make sure the vid card natively handles h.264 video in hardware)
3-use VLC player, which is faster and less laggy
4- aim for lower bitrate movies, which means no 720p h.264 too large. You can get xvid, divx, avi, or mpg, or get smaller mkv/mp4 files. For me that limit is usually "

My PC is great, but I cant get it to send 5.1 audio through S/PDIF as discrete channels or encoded as DTS or AC3, so I leave it all up to my PS3 (with the help of MKVtoolnix and MKV2VOB!)"
