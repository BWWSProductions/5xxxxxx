A live DVD of
status quo pictures live at montreux


In 2009, Brit rockers Status Quo took to the Montreux stage to perform some of their biggest hits, in support of their PICTURES album. And with a back catalogue spanning 40 years, they had plenty of material to choose from. Songs like 'Rockin' All Over The World', 'Down Down', and 'Whatever You Want' went down a storm with the usually reserved Swiss crowd and stood as testament to the band's enduring appeal. 
Tracklisting: 'Caroline', 'The Wanderer', 'Rain', 'Don't Drive My Car', 'Mean Girl/Softer Ride', 'Beginning Of The End', 'Is There A Better Way', 'Proposing Medley: What You're Proposing/Down The Dustpipe/Little Lady/Red Sky/Dear John/Big Fat Mama', 'Pictures Of Matchstick Men/Ice In The Sun', 'The Oriental', 'Creepin' Up', 'In My Chair', 'Living On An Island', 'In The Army Now', 'The Killer', 'Roll Over Lay Down', 'Down Down', 'Whatever You Want', 'Rockin' All Over The World', 'Junior's Wailing', 'Rock 'n' Roll Music/Bye Bye Johnny'.
