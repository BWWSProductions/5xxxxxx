        |   This pack also includes all the modules required in order to use   |
        |   included applications. All files have been tested in RISC OS 3 and |
        |   4, and should work on other versions in most cases - although      |
        |   please note that these apps are almost certainly not 32-bit        |
        |   compatible, and therefore will not run under RISC OS 5. You will   |
        |   also need a decompression utility in RISC OS to extract these      |
        |   files; if you don't have one, you can grab a copy of David         |

        |   =================================                                  |
        |   These files must be decompressed within RISC OS with a RISC OS     |
        |   dearchiving program. Decompression on other platforms will lead    |
        |   to a loss of filetype information.                                 |
