,dANGER_boy,2010-08-29T01:12Z,"It can take a very very long tiem for the installer to work.  Give it time.  When I was running Vista it could take anywhere up to 10 min to get past the file integrity check and pop up the installation screen.  Try running as an administrator and see if that helps.  Windows 7 loads the application much faster.  And check your task manager to make sure that only one instance of setup_freespace.exe is running, cause if you clicked multiple times and have several instances running, it will take you ages."

I do use PublicBitTorrent and OpenBitTorrent trackers in my torrents.  It is The Pirate Bay that automatically adds the other trackers when I upload...nothing I can do about that."

,darrell08,2011-05-25T01:11Z,"I still have my original Freespace 2 discs from 1999, still one of the best games I've ever played and with the SCP, it's just dynamite. I always wanted to check out the first FreeSpace tho, but have never been able to find a legit place to download it from. Thanks a bunch"
