This software I've created as a token of appreciation to my favorite porn uploaders: Exmnova,Brego45,Dias_VLD and others.

for those uploaders who upload 10-20-50-100+ movies per day or per week, this is ideal solution for them to create thumbnails in bulk.
Highlights
1. Drag and drop files/folder, it searches for movie clips inside them and creates thumbnails.
2. also zip those thumbnails for easy bulkupload to your favorite imagehost.

Detailed Description:
Everytime you want to create thumbnails for your movies, its all point and click this and that so much time wasted.
Especially those mega uploaders on who upload like 10-50 or more movies per week! So for them, I've create this solution.

Just select multiple files/folders and drag and drop them in my program and it'll automatically create thumnails: be it 10 movies, 100 movies no problem. whether its in a same folder or in the 10th level subfolder of a folder no problem, it'll search all media files and create thumbnails for it! Even if some of those subfolders have non-media files; don't worry, my program will skip them and work flawlessly.
And yes if you want
Thumbnails can be created and saved in a ZIP file! hence you can directly zip-upload it to picswan/ imagebam or whatever your favorite imagehost site it!

consider the time, keyboard strokes and mouseclicks saved! just drag and drop.

Supported video formats:-
.3gp,.3g2,.asf,.avi,.dat,.divx,.dsm,.evo,.flv,.m1v,.m2ts,.m2v,.m4a,.mj2,.mjpg,.mjpeg,.mkv,.mov,.moov,.mp4,.mpg,.mpeg,.mpv,.nut,.ogg,.ogm,.qt,.swf,.ts,.vob,.wmv,.xvid

Principle
it uses MTN thumbnailer which is a commandline thumbnail creator software. I've provided a 'User friendly' GUI support to it via Autohotkey script.
for zipping the screenshot/thumbnails, I've given built-in commandline version of 7zip. don't worry you don't have to remember or type any commands any where. all you've to do is drag and drop single time!

Options
you can set the Movie screenshot's number of
Rows
Height
Columns
jpeg quality
and more...

I'm especially thankful to
#1
Mr.Tuit for creating the movie thumbnailer (mtn)
http://moviethumbnail.sourceforge.net/
my software only provides GUI to his software
mtn is developed by tuit (tuitfun); though most of its magic is actually done
by FFmpeg libraries. For documents, please see in the doc directory and at
http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=201133 .

Troubleshoot:Thumbnails not created
Reason:1- may be the required video codecs are not installed in your system. This software basically works on FFmpeg libraries.so you need to download and install a codec package like Vistacodec or K-Lite Megacodec to fix the problem. both are free.
Reason:2- may be your video file or output folder has UNICODE names like chinese,arabic etc. Be sure that all file and folder names are English only.
any other glitch, Post it on forum.
