These DVDs show you true images of real, exquisitely dissected human anatomical specimens, in three dimensions. As the camera moves from one viewpoint to another, the specimen appears to rotate in space, letting the viewer experience it as a three-dimensional object. Aclandâ€™s DVD Atlas uses fresh, un-embalmed specimens that retain the color, texture, mobility â€“ and beauty â€“ of the living human body.
