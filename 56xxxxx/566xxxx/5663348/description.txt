        With the new Ashampoo Snap 4 you can capture just everything on
        your screen!

        Ashampoo Snap 4 enables you to create high-quality screenshots,
        videos and demos of your screen content. Edit, save and share
        your excellent results with others. This new version offers lots
        of innovative features and improvements, especially in the areas
        of video capture and editing tools. 


        The new video mode:

        Use the video mode to create videos and demos tailored to your
        needs. Capture film sequences or computer games (in a window) and
        save them as high-quality video files. You can also produce demos
        like video tutorials for software or presentations of websites.
        Videos and demos can be saved in different formats using various
        codecs. New fantastic features, like cursor and zoom effects, are
        available during video capture. Furthermore a recording can be
        paused and resumed anytime, in order to, for example, switch
        between applications or prepare the screen content. Of course,
        you are not limited to the main screen anymore, because Ashampoo
        Snap 4 also supports multi-monitor environments. 


        Even more editing tools for your screenshots:

        Create perfect-looking screenshots of your entire screen content
        or specially selected parts. After making a screenshot, an
        intuitive editor opens automatically and provides you with
        extensive editing tools, with which you can make your shots even
        more individual and original. Enhance your screenshots with, for
        example informative hints, arrows, texts, graphics, shapes,
        stamps and lots more, in order to convey facts or other topics in
        your shots easier and more illustrative. 

        Whether for work, for school or in your spare time - create
        screenshots and videos in no time and fill your colleagues,
        classmates or friends with enthusiasm for your amazing results.

        Â· New cursor and zoom effects for video capture
        Â· Support of more codecs/containers for video encoding

        Â· Improved highlighting tool (more than one area)
        Â· Objects, for example arrows, texts, shapes etc., are now
          editable
        Â· High-quality objects (anti-aliasing etc.)
        Â· Support of the Ashampoo Photo Commander format for import and
          export

        New and improved features at a glance:

        Improved editing of objects
        Â· All objects, like texts, arrows, shapes etc., can now be edited
          as often as you want. In Ashampoo Snap 4 objects have their own
          edit panel at the bottom of the screen. 

        Higher display quality of objects
        Â· The display quality of objects was also improved
          (anti-aliasing, transparency and high quality shadow effect). 

        New features in the editing mode
        Â· In Ashampoo Snap 4 the highlight tool is not limited to a
          single area anymore. You can now highlight multiple areas.
          Create great screenshots by adding stamps or graphics, which
          the program provides for you. 

        Different video capture methods
        Â· In the video mode you can choose between two video capture
          methods. You can either save your recording on-the-fly or you
          can save the recording in the buffer first, and then create a
          video file (WMV or AVI). 

        More video codecs and formats
        Â· The new Ashampoo Snap 4 supports even more output formats for
          video encoding. The following codecs: Windows Media Video 7, 8,
          9, Screen / Advanced (VC1) and all on the system installed
          codecs for AVI files (for example Xvid, DivX etc.) are
          supported. 

        New cursor and zoom effects in the video mode
        Â· During a video recording you can now use the new cursor and
          zoom effects. You can decide whether to show or hide the
          cursor. Furthermore you can highlight the cursor, for example
          by using a colored circle. Make use of the new zoom effect and
          zoom into a particular area while recording. 

        Improved auto-scrolling screen capture
        Â· Capture the entire contents of a text document or web page,
          which you would have to scroll down, to a single graphics
          image. Ashampoo Snap 4 also offers improved capture of Java
          applications. The program automatically scrolls the window and
          captures everything, including the part of the document not
          visible in the window. 

        Support of multi-monitor environments
        Â· Capture content not only on your main screen, but also on other
          screens. Capturing areas that share parts of two monitors are
          supported, too. 

        Send by e-mail
        Â· Now you can send your screenshots in a single PDF file by
          e-mail. 

        Import/export of configurations
        Â· Import or export the complete configurations of Ashampoo Snap 4
          in one INI file. 


        More cool features:

        Quickly available
        Â· Ashampoo Snap 4 is always ready to hand as a toolbar at the top
          of the screen, which allows access to all functions. 

        Different screenshot capture modes
        Â· Use the different modes to capture different areas in the best
          possible way. Capture a window or dialog box, including
          non-rectangular shapes. Or select a free region by drawing the
          shape you want to capture on the screen with your mouse â€“ itâ€™s
          like the lasso function in a graphics program. Moreover you can
          select a predefined area, by specifying width and height of the
          capture rectangle. For scrolling websites just use the
          auto-scrolling functions. 

        Multi-capture
        Â· You can perform multiple captures without restarting. 

        Seamless integration with Windows functions
        Â· Ashampoo Snap 4 auto-monitors the Windows built-in print screen
          key for quickâ€™nâ€™easy capture. With the print screen key full
          screen content capture is possible 

        Apply effects on-the-fly while capturing
        Â· While capturing screenshots, you can add effects, like for
          example smooth-graphical drop shadows, capture the cursor,
          apply cool shape effects etc. 

        Add audio comments
        Â· Use your microphone to add your own comments and instructions
          to videos. Sound settings are configured automatically. 

        User assistance wizard
        Â· In the improved assistant mode, which is activated by default,
          Ashampoo Snap 4 shows you step by step where everything is and
          explains how to do everything directly in the program. 

        Automatic filenames
        Â· You can configure the format of the automatically generated
          filenames. For example, you can include the current date and
          time in the filename. The new Ashampoo Snap 4 supports a
          multitude of formats.
