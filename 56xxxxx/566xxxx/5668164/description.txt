The Opposition (also known as Opposition) is a long running post-punk band from London, England that featured Ralph Hall, Marcus Bell and Mark Long.

Founded in 1979, the Opposition released their first single, Very Little Glory, on the independent record label Double Vision Records. It was reviewed by the NME (New Musical Express) and called "a song recorded before its time." The single received some good press and was soon followed by their first album, Breaking the Silence, and a British and French tour. They then recorded Intimacy, and with the press picking up on the band, they switched from indie and secured a contract with Charisma Records.recording Promisesin 1984. A brief tour of the USA followed as support act to 'Thomas Dolby' before releasing Empire Days, in 1985, still with the engineer Kenny Jones joined by 'John Porter' .
