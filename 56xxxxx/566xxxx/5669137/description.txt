Refueling operations are potentially hazardous and require constant attention of all personnel involved. Fortunately, accidents linked to refueling aircraft are very remote in the commercial aviation.

Teamwork is very often the key to accident prevention, and it is particularly true in this domain.
This Flight Operations Briefing Note aims at giving an overview of the recommendations provided for refueling operation to every team member involved.
