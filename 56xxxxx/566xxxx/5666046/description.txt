My Interview with Orly Taitz went pretty good except for the last part where background noise started popping out of nowhere due to my bad phone battery I used for my blogtalkradio show USWGO Talk Radio, the battery gave me only less then 5 seconds warning and then went kaput and the whole Interview got messed up so it ended abruptly because of a technical difficulty but before then the whole Interview with Orly Taitz has went very well.

I asked her questions regarding the Constitution, the legitimacy of President Barack Hussein Obama, and asked her questions about her views on the Police State.

Before the technical difficulty the interview was a little over twenty minutes which is a good time to have a interview with especially someone who is fighting against the dictator wannabe like Barack Obama.
