Danger Mouse - The Early Years: 2001-2003
I ripped this from vinyl with great care. It sounds just like studio quality.

Danger Mouse [Born Brian Joseph Burton, July 29, 1977] - Made notorious in 2004 for creating The Grey Album from mashing The Beatles with Jay-Z. Since, he gained indie fame with Danderdoom, when he collaborated with MF Doom on their album The Mouse and The Mask. Danger Mouse made it famous as the producer for Gnarls Barkley. Since, he has achieved veteran status working with super-groups in Broken Bells  and on the Dark Night of the Soul project.

This vinyl rip (great quality - sounds perfect) includes 5 Mash-Ups he made in the lab [before he got celebrity status]:

Nas vs Portishead - It Ain't Hard To Tell (2001)
Audio Two vs Air - Top Billin (2001)
Suzanne Vega vs 50 Cent - Tom's Diner (2003)
Outkast vs Funkadelic - Whole World (2002)
Xzibit vs Radiohead - Paparazzi (2002)
