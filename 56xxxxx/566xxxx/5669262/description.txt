I created this torrent (my first!) to share some of my favorite music albums, which I think every music lover should listen to: at least once.

Take a look and see for yourself what's inside: there are no RARs whatsoever. :D


Also, these are mostly FLACs, but there are some MP3s too. That's because I only own the originals of some of the albums - the others are from other torrents and direct downloads.

If you're not sure what to download, here are some of suggestions:

"West Side Story", from Leonard Bernstein - the whole album - it's incredible. Simply incredible.

"You Must Believe in Spring", from Bill Evans - the whole album - my favorite album from one of the greatest jazz pianists.

"Montagues and Capulets", from Prokofiev - single track - you MUST listen to this. It will blow your mind.

"Daphnis et ChloÃ«", from Ravel - single track - it's.. I don't even know how to tell you how powerful this piece is. Do download it.

Well, if you like what you heard from the above list, download the rest of the files! :D
You shan't regret it.


Finally, I must tell you it's really important for you to buy the originals, because artists need money too.
Enjoy!
