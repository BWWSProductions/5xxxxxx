,LynnPsycho,2010-07-09T21:06Z,I\'m not sure. I heard a rumor.
,rdevil13,2010-08-10T04:57Z,"Lady Gaga is not featured on this song, which is performed solely by Pixie Lott, nor did she write it. The song was produced by RedOne, who is one of Gaga's primary collaborators. This song was co-written by Lott and RedOne for her 2009 album ""Turn it Up"" and did not appear on Gaga's 2006 Red and Blue EP."
