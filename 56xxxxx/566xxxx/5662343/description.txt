Mega Disasters: Volcanic Winter

The largest volcanic eruption of the past two million years occurred on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, 75,000 years ago.

The impact from the super volcano Toba decimated the local habitat, but gas, ash and debris from Toba made their way around the planet and formed a shield in the atmosphere that deflected the sun's warming rays.

Temperatures plummeted and the planet was thrown into a volcanic winter and may have even pushed the planet into an ice age.

3-D computer animation will recreate the storm and unveil how this one volcano could have brought humanity to the edge of extinction.
