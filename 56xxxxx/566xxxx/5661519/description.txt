This is from HiDef TV Rage, but as its a very old clip the quality is the same as standard TV from 20 years ago or so.

Still a great classic and video quality is okay and I have also trimmed it a bit and made it 720 x 440 to suit wide screens, rather than the original size which was 4 x 3 aspect.

Enjoy
