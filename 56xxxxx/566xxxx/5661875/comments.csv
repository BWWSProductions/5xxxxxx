,xnick101,2010-10-13T20:54Z,Can someone tell me how i can install this i only get Net Render and no Cinema 4d?
,jeph,2011-01-18T18:46Z,"@xnick101 I had the same issue, then I realized what I did wrong. Very early in the installation process, you'll encounter a screen that asks you to enter your name, company, ect. In the lower left there will be a space for you to enter your serial numbers. Copy and paste ALL the text from the attached serials.txt file into this space before continuing. "
