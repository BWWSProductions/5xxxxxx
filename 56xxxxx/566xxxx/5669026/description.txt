Great Danes-dog Marmaduke has only nonsense in your head, is he still in the midst of puberty. When the family moves out of the drab suburban America to California, to Marmaduke feels like paradise. In particular, the urban meadow for him is dogs make the perfect place to friends, dogs get to know ladies and nonsense host. Always on the move: His best buddy, the cat Carlos.
