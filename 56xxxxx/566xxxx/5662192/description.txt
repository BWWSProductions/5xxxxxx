We cover a lot of material in this single episode. First, we revisit a topic from last year: Joel Osteen. Why? Because of an angry listener  email. The second half of the program deals with our topic from last time: Trinity vs. Oneness Theology. Hear the Oneness argument and position firsthand,  from Mark, a non-Trinitarian Christian.
