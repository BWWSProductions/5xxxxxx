,R2d6.51,2011-01-12T20:09Z,"Hey, if your using the VLC Media player under tools there are command boxes that allow for you yo synchronize the subtitles with any movie. I had a similair problem with a different movie with Sub off track and too fast and VLC allows for you to fix most any sync problems with aido video and subtitles. Hope that helps."
,R2d6.51,2011-01-12T20:23Z,"Hey, if U have VLC MP, and not,get it.
VLC has Kool Tools to fix most any A/V & ST sync anomalies.

Open VLC App-under Tools select Track Synchronization. Their is a set of adjustment tools that allows you to sync up your AV ST needs and enjoy the flick.

Hope this helps,
Cheers
