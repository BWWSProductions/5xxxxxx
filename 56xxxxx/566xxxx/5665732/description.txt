         History Channel. We are so familiar with the map of United    
         States, but do we know why our states look the way they       
         do? Every shape on the map tells a great story about our      
         past. Why is California bent? To cling on to gold. Why does   
         Oklahoma have a panhandle? Because of shifting borders        
         for slavery. Why does Missouri have a boot? Because of        
         a massive earthquake. This special examines how every         
         state is a puzzle piece ultimately revealing the unique       
          geography, political and social history of America.
