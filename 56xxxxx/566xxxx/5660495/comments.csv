next upload will be men of honor "
,omegafox84,2010-07-02T07:01Z,i just have the original boxsets. George is my favorite because he always has such bad luck and blows everything out of proportion. lol. have you ever watched any Curb Your Enthusiasm with Larry David? that show is awesome too. haven't seen Men of Honor yet. i'll be sure to check it out though.
[T],ctang,2010-07-02T16:30Z,i dont get hbo or i would...have heard great things about it though...i really want to see the episode where the seinfeld crew was the guest...kramer is my favorite bc i love how over the top he is about everything and just how crazy he is...he really adds that great element to the show  
,omegafox84,2010-07-02T18:18Z,"i don't have HBO either, i just end up getting the boxsets. haven't got the 7th season yet since it just came out (which has the Seinfeld ep). hope to soon though."
[T],ctang,2010-07-02T18:54Z,i cant afford to buy the boxsets at $25 a season...wish i could though
,omegafox84,2010-07-02T20:35Z,"yeah, it can get expensive. i almost always buy used though. it's a whole lot cheaper."
[T],ctang,2010-07-03T03:50Z,hell ya...we have a place around here that buys and sells used games and dvd's and what not...will have to check it out and see if they have some of the series that i want...for some reason i never really thought about it
[T],ctang,2010-07-03T20:31Z,check your email!!! sent you the list of dvd's posted inside the text box :)
,omegafox84,2010-07-03T20:36Z,awesome! i'll check it out now. thanks man!
