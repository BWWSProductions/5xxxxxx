,etomee2,2010-07-06T15:05Z,there is a / sign between them but TPB does not show it so HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->SOFTWARE->aerosoft... etc in the registry
,dash8captain,2010-07-06T21:23Z,"Attention ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking; 

1. Right click on the AES help icon on your desktop, a window appears...click on properties

2. Click ""Find Target"". (This will open the AES folder)

3. Right click on AES_0001.DAT, click properties then check ""Read Only"", click apply then click ""ok""

4. Right click on AES_0002.DAT  click properties then check ""Read Only"", click apply then click ""ok""

5. Next, open the ""Scenery"" folder in the AES Folder and right click on  AES_LFFFF0.BGL click properties then check ""Read Only"", click apply then click ""ok""...that's it. Done!

The error message should not show up again no matter how many times u launch the Sim. When you need to change your AES configuration, or activate airports, just remove the ""Read Only"" status from the three (3) files and once you are finished re-apply the ""Read Only"" and fly to your hearts delight...Maintain Airspeed."

,GregC8902,2010-07-09T17:23Z,Dude i badly need help..its not working for me! Here\'s what i\'ve done.. 1. Deleted everything AES involved. 2Installed 2.05.. 3. Then the Crack 3. Then restarted the computer as it told me 4. Install 2.05 again and when i run AES Help it has serials but no EIRESIM Cork or Shannon.! It had it the first time and i cant remember how i got it! :(
,GregC8902,2010-07-09T21:05Z,Or else could someone try and get the files from 2.07 for Cork and Shannon and convert them to 2.04..I\'ve tried but it wont work! :)

,bart9494,2010-07-24T04:28Z,How do you delete from the registry?
,MajorWales,2010-07-31T15:20Z,"for people not knowing how to delete from registry, you need to open up regedit (search in start) and open it up. it should have a UI like my computer or my documents. on the left, you have multiple options. two of these should be HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_USERS. open up HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. if you are running vista or W7, you need to go to this: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SOFTWARE -> AEROSOFT -> Airport Enhancement Systems - delete this folder. there is also a folder name with a load of jibberish (eg: 732fj84fnfnv7n8v78vn3) delete that as well.

then, you go to HKEY_USERS -> Jibberish line -> VB and VBA program settings OR Software VB and VBA

and delete the folder inside (jibberish named folder)

then you can install :)"

[T],stevekasian,2010-09-17T03:05Z,"STFU deed boy - everyone want AES 2.07 ""working"", so it goes without saying. Do you see anyone with any credibility on here requesting FSDT Honolulu or KLAS, which everyone and their brother wants? No, because that's fucking stupid.

Instead of requesting shit, try SHARING some of your shit. You'd be quite surprised at the things that tend to come your way when you GIVE rather than TAKE."

,chaoshon,2011-01-24T17:28Z,"@gotbutchi

How have you managed to install this? I find it difficult as I'm a new pirate..

BTW I have FSX.

1. ""Deinstall AES from FS scenery.cfg
Wait a sec, what should I ""deinstall""? Am I not suppose to download it? Or should I install the trial (with the 10 credits) first? And will it work if I install the 2.09 version?

2. Again, not sure why am I suppose to even have this folder..

The rest of the steps are pretty clear, but not the first ones.. I'll be glad if someone helps, sorry for my ignorance.."
,gotbutchi,2011-01-29T19:20Z,"@chaoshon:
-The first deinstall step is only for the people who already had the older version of AES. If you don't have any then you can skip it :)

-This only work for 2.05,do not install 2.09 or it will screw everything up!"
