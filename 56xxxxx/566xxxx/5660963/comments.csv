,blinkivxx,2010-07-01T10:12Z,Downloading now... Thanks a ton if this is legit.  Any word on how this was acquired?
,gimpy46290,2010-07-01T10:29Z,Did you hear about the stolen cd incident from tech's tour bus?
,blinkivxx,2010-07-01T10:38Z,"No I sure didn't. But I did see the interview with that fat juggalo dude on the bus...  and even I thought that guy was a douche for trying to get a close up of the cd. 

What happened?

And thanks for the up though. I got it pre-ordered so I'll support him anyways but it's nice to have it almost a full month early."
,gimpy46290,2010-07-01T10:42Z,Tech got on twitter pissed as fuck sayin that someone stole his cd off of the tour bus but he never came off with what the cd was. then rumors strarted floating around that it was his new cd. Now here we are in present day lol
