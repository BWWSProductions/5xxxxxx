,j1zzle,2010-07-02T17:28Z,This is just that other cam release in a different aspect ratio. And near the end of the movie it's all sped up and shitty? wth? The older release is better in my opinion lmao.
,lovinEdward,2010-07-02T19:13Z,"there is no sound on the sample, does that mean there is no sound on the film.. sorry im new :-( "
,Solstice420,2010-07-02T19:39Z,"The reason no one is seeding this is because it's an ""Innocence Group Release"". There are about 30 of them out there. Its the ONLY one in English thus far. It's a piece of junk cam. They really threw this together to get ratings. STOP UPLOADING THE SAME FILES MORONS! 

Wait a couple days for a BETTER release.

A:3   V:3"
