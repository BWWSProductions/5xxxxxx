,mikhv67,2011-05-31T04:41Z,I want GWDT and GWPWF I've got the last one and fuck sake not dubbed. When I went to Russia was the first time i'd seen dubbed movies since the 70's. Morons watch dubbed movies. 
,c-tea,2011-10-02T20:29Z,"raymondhome, xoxo, have other stuff first time i gave your deserved shout out, always high quality and super - hey others, dubbed, what, so? get over the mouth thing, i much prefer over reading my films, this way i can see surroundings, nuance, motion, interaction, all that, ignore the mouth thing and pay attention to what the cinematographer and director are achieving, a whole environment - anyhow, i always prefer dub over reading my flixs. much too silly a thing to focus on, instead, hands up, jump jump, everyone hands up if ya love ta share, hands up, give it up to them that take the time to give us accessible universe, and hey, seed at least at the minimum SEED PLS! its the least we can do to make this universe outside of the other that makes off the blood and souls and shuts all else down, um, so seed at least. peace, c-tea"
,c-tea,2011-10-02T20:32Z,"the sound problems some are having is caused by moving ahead using the scroll bar in some players. my solution, stop, fully, move to where you want, then play, or pause, move, and play, but not move while in play mode, some how this makes it sound like on heavy sedatives, mind you, go to the place where they are smacking lips and oh ah the single malt scotch, that is a riot in super slow audio, super cool, but that is not really important, stop or pause, then move bar, peace"
