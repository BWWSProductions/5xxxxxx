- transcoding speed should be greatly improved especially on multi-core systems now.
- fix: previously selected multi-pass encoding could cause another "multipass" encoding when selecting passthrough mode, where it made no sense and only took up extra time.
- fix: selecting all angles from a multi-angle title would cause no output to be generated. Transcoding of multiple angles into a single video file is pointless, so now selection of multiple angles is disabled.
