In this fourth series of the hell-raising Wishmaster, the Djinn unleashes his undying love and three wishes on a beautiful new victim named Lisa, whose crucial third wish is one that the Wishmaster cannot fulfill without leaving a trail of terror, devastation and blood in his wake. The evil brotherhood of the Djinns shall awaken from the flames of Hell. As the third wish is made, humankind had better be prepared for the apocalypse. Woken up once again, the repulsive Djinn returns to wreck the life of more innocent victims with his deadly fulfillments. In order to prevent the release of the evil brotherhood of the Djinns from Hell, Lisa must find a way to destroy the Djinn to stop the prophecy from being fulfilled.
