[V],dohduhdah,2010-08-17T08:13Z,"Forate78, have you tried downloading the file with utorrent or vuze? Either one of those bittorrent clients should work. On demonoid that torrent is split up in 9 parts and not well-seeded."
[V],dohduhdah,2010-08-17T08:15Z,"64146495, I prefer to share stuff via bittorrent as it's more convenient and downloaders share data while downloading (which allows for more efficient downloading)."
