O S A N N A
- (1973)Palepoli [Japanese edition 2004] -

A sweeping blow with all ingredients the early seventies prepared for them: deep purplelesque hardrock and Led Zeppelin Blues, prog elements of early Genesis, Crimson, Tull, VDGG...
...a hodge-podge of styles and ideas gathered in one album with two long pieces.
Though this does not qualify for a great and unique masterpiece, Osanna did a real good job ensuring the listener an exiting and absorbing experience.

By far their best album and another classic in the Italian prog circus.
