Portable(ThinApp)version of Mozilla Firefox 4 beta 1
======================================================
* Tested on vista 32bit and working.(Note this is the 32bit version, 64 bit not available yet)

* Remember it's a beta, so don't expect it to run smoothly.

* If you have a previous version of Firefox installed, it's setting may change when this is launched (you can change them back once you done with Firefox 4.0)

*When launching this portable edition a folder called "Mozilla Firefox (4.0b1)" will be created in the same directory, this folder will contain the settings, so don't worry.

* 100% virus free-Scanned with Kaspersky.

* For original non-portable installer visit:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/4.0b1-candidates/build1/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%204.0%20Beta%201.exe

* This is my first torrent, so please comment if working.

Thanks and Enjoy :)
