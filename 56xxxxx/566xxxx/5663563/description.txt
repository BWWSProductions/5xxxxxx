Released in 1977 and having a minor hit with the title track 'Together', O C Smith pretty much ended a non-descript singing career.

But this was certainly the best of his work.

It should be noted that this is recorded from the vinyl version and is NOT a digital release... and it shows!

It's still one of my favorite 'LPs' and definitely worth a listen, not just for the deep voice of the singer but for the great songs and orchestral arrangements that accompany him.
