,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-05T04:43Z,NICE RELEASE MAN THANK YOU.....AND THE QUALITY OF YOUR RELEASES ARE REALLY GREAT.......
[T],ctang,2010-07-05T04:59Z,"@GUYMOVIE: thank you...you will have to comment back on this one and see if you notice an up in quality of the main feature as i used DVD-Rebuilder and CCE with 3 passes on this one, which should increase the quality of the film...i also made it so that the bitrate is lower than normal on the extras which allows for less compression of the main feature!!! :)

o and by the way, im not the only one that does this, i know djfred and mikemelo1369 also do this same thing"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-07-05T05:14Z,"look at the technical talk! haha, you are fucking awesome ctang.  im going to start downloading this tomorrow.

ive noticed that if i wait until the next day to download your dvds that my download speed hits between 1MB and 2MBs and the dvd downloads in like 2 hours.

thats retard fast.  this also happens with mikes torrents."
,punisher_latin,2010-07-05T05:36Z,thank u ctang!!!!!!!
[T],ctang,2010-07-05T06:13Z,"haha...thanks zombi...love your comments :)...it took me so long to figure out how to get CCE working with DVD-Rebuilder its not even funny...figured i would brag a little bc im impressed by the significant quality improvement on the main feature i noticed with the process i used :)

you welcome punisher_latin"
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-05T08:13Z,hey ctang can you tell me what do i do after downloading this??? i m quite new to this!!!!
[T],zombifuzz,2010-07-05T15:06Z,"@ ctang

you def have bragging rights.  you are one of the few dvd-r uploading masters here on TPB.

@ J

hello my friend!  this is a DVD5 so no recoding will be needed.  get yourself a 4.7 DVD-R, open a program such as nero (which i use to burn dvds), drag the completed DVD folder into the burning program and press ""Burn"" or whatever your program displays for you to burn this to the disc.  simple as that.  

of course that is a quick explanation of the process, i guess it might depend on what you use program wise.  i swear by nero 7 (old as shit but easy to use and straight forward).  you literally drag, click, wait, and then your done within 10 minutes."
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-05T15:45Z,Thanks z....
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-07-06T00:09Z,@ Ctang. I'm glad I could help you out and get you the info for switching over to CCE and DVDRBP like me:) Glad you figured it out:P
[T],ctang,2010-07-06T00:59Z,"@MM: i know what you mean....i know i was annoying as hell about it but im really glad i figured it out....i installed and uninstalled it about a million times before i finally figured it out

@zombifuzz: thanks for the kind words friend...makes it worth uploading things :)"

1. register
2. do a search for both
3. download both
4. install both
5. Run DVD-RB
6. CCE Trial for the encoder, since cce will probably be a trial of 2.7 that you find, make sure you set DVD-RB to CCE Trial and make sure in the options that the cce path is correct
7. Make sure ""one click mode isn't checked""
8. Prepare
9. Encode
10. Rebuild

there are other options you can work with if you have RB-Opt but you need a long tutorial to work with it and it can be complicated...good luck"
,jamoncillo,2010-07-08T03:30Z,thanks!
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-13T04:33Z,are these people that much greedy???? the first time i saw was 44 seeds and 90 leechers so i thought this would have about 100 seeds by now but these people dont seed!!!!!..........
[T],ctang,2010-07-14T03:27Z,i thought the same thing
