At least this wasnt upped anonymously and then just left to sit there while we cried ourselves to sleep..."
,Mills00013,2010-07-02T04:45Z,"And by that last comment, what I really meant was that if this is legit, cebo0650, I want to hump your leg like a rabid dog. Seriously, you have made me a happy happy man."
,cebo0650,2010-07-03T06:39Z,"Yes, it's legit. I too was looking for this for a very long time so when I finally got my hands on it I thought I would share ;)"
,Mills00013,2010-07-03T19:13Z,Is there a special way to burn this disc? I just burned it like a regular iso should be and the MMI is saying to check the disc. Or is there a special medium I should be using?
,Mills00013,2010-07-03T23:10Z,"Alright, disregard the last comment.

This has to be burned using a single layer DVD+R. ""-R"" discs will not work correctly! I simply used Toast on Mac OSX and used the disc copy. There was nothing more to it than that. Six minutes of burning and no verification leaves me with finally being able to see my neighborhood on a map.

Thank you so much!!!"
,pavelbarchuk,2010-07-04T00:51Z,"Took me a while to download it, burnt it to a dvd ""DVD-R"" with Iso Magic, stuck it inside my A8 and it asked me to upgrade the nav system which i declined to do... anyways, i took it for a drive and the newest roads are on it. thanks cebo0650, i will seed at high rate for a while so other can enjoy this as well"
,Mills00013,2010-07-04T01:51Z,"pavelbarchuk, you should upgrade the system. it runs a lot smoother and cleaner with the newest software update. it only takes a few minutes too. I cant believe you were able to get it using a DVD-R. Im jealous because I now have two fancy dvd-r shaped coasters."
,pavelbarchuk,2010-07-04T12:55Z,"actually, my bad... once i updated the system, it stoped working, the map dissapeared. i thought it was working off of the dvd but turns out the mmi stores some of the maps in memory somehow. unfortunetly, it didnt work out, i had to insert my factory dvd and re-install the software. maybe its my dvd, who knows. let me know if anyone has any luck"
,mistashakes,2010-07-04T21:53Z,"Once you update the software, can you go back to the old version?  I know on MB vehicles, once you update to a new version you cannot go back, so if the DVD does not work, you are SOL, or must get the new one."
,pavelbarchuk,2010-07-05T00:01Z,"Yep. Once i put the original dvd back in, it says new navigation software available, install yes/no... btw, does anyone know where they sell new dvd's for audi? and how much?"
,zheka.,2010-07-05T00:03Z,I join with my appreciations to cebo0650. Good job man! I have something to suggest here. Has anyone tried to upgrade your NAVi from 2G to 3G. I'm in possession of two iso images that allegedly may upgrade your NAVi as long as the software index doesn't exceed a certain value. I thought that it could be done only by replacing the head unit and some other components. Is anyone interested in such an upgrade?
,cebo0650,2010-07-06T02:45Z,"I'm glad everyone is enjoying this.

I said ""Yes"" to the update (06 A6 Avant with 2G MMI) and there were no issues.

At first I had this burned on a DL DVD and it was giving me issues, very and slow and occasionally  showing ""Please check navigation disk"" but after burning onto a single layer 4.7GB DVD all is working perfectly fine.

As for upgrading 2G MMI to 3G I don't think that is possible with just a software update. You need all new hardware."
,cebo0650,2010-07-06T03:22Z,"pavelbarchuk, you can order the Audi DVD from Navteq, it's $199 US"
,greendogg,2010-07-06T20:58Z,stuck at 26.8%.  Any suggestions?
,cebo0650,2010-07-06T23:03Z,"I was told that for the 2010 maps to work your MMI needs to be updated to the latest version which is 4610 (4.6.10).

If yours is not that may be why it's getting stuck. Not sure, sorry."
,Mills00013,2010-07-07T00:44Z,"I'm still using 0600 for my software version. I choose yes to upgrade the nav software, but my whole MMI unit is still at 0600.

'04 A8L here, btw.

I had one issue yesterday with it giving me a disc read error. I just pulled the disc out, put in the original (version 4, woot!) and then put my burned disc back in and I have had no errors since!"
,greendogg,2010-07-07T19:14Z,"figured it out.  Burned with ImagBurn, updated (2006 A6 Avant) and it works like a charm.  Many thanks!!"
,killerdevil124,2010-07-25T02:00Z,"Can anyone help me out exactly what they used to burn it, such as the program, dvd type, speed of burn and maybe even a lil bit more detailed instructions.  Thanks"
,thomas2345,2010-07-30T07:23Z,"This did not work for me. Used DVD +R as recommended. Vehicle: 2006 Audi A3 (North American). Disc was successfully burned and verified and I can view directory on PC.

I have successfully updated before from torrent here. Currently have 2007 update burned to DVD + R dual layer. Any suggestions appreciated. 

The current catalog number at Navteq site for my vehicle (this is identified as 2010-2011 version so it may be a year newer) is: T1000-16612. "
,parichey,2010-08-18T07:49Z,"Hi
Guys

I downloaded this and burnt it on a DVD+R Single Layer using Nero and then using Windows but in both cases this does not seem to work for me. I have an Audi A6 2006. Please any more information you guyes can provide will be great.

Thanks,
PG"

,CocaineMafia,2011-08-12T04:23Z,"i downloaded it and installed it in a DVD-R disk using nero and when i put it in my audi, it didn't read the disk "
,rockandrollpaul,2011-11-15T04:22Z,Make sure you change the book type to DVD-ROM when you burn it.  That should resolve the issues with it not being recognized in the car.
