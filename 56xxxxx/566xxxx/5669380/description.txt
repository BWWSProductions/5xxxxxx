"John", (James Stewart) a cowboy from Texas, after the death of his brother receives an unusual legacy: The Cheyenne social club. When "John", to which accompanies his inseparable friend "Sullivan" (Henry Fonda), another cowboy from Texas who leads riding more than 10 years at his side, decides to go in search of the business of his brother discovers that it is a Club of joyful girls with a great tradition in the region.

Two masters of the interpretation, James Stewart and Henry Fonda, there are cited in this atypical but fun western where a lot of jokes and comical attitudes, in addition to a multitude of absurd situations, accompanied by some secondary players very good. It also appreciates good decorated and magnificent affairs in the first drawings of the film.

Gene Kelly, an expert dancer and choreographer, "Singin' in the Rain" dares to lead this western with excellent results, and offers us here an entertaining comedy without major claims.

The 70 was an apocalyptic decade for the western. The great directors had died or were withdrawn from cinema. Only John Wayne and Clint Eastwood continued to westerns. This is why we admire decision of Gene Kelly to make an original film, little sight and sound touches of humor.
