Director Oliver Stone, and co-writers Mark Weisbrot and Tariq Ali discuss Stone's latest documentary, South of the Border, at the National Press Club on June 23, 2010. Stone, Weisbrot and Ali answer questions about the movie for the press after an introduction by Stone. The film is the product of Oliver Stone's 2009 road trip across five countries to explore the social and political movements taking place in those countries and the mis-perceptions most people have about Hugo Chavez and other leaders in South America, mostly due to a skewed portrayal by major US media.
