Like PLANETS AGAINST US (original title: ""I Pianeti Contro Noi"").   A very interesting flick about an alien invasion, that starts with an alien cyborg being sent to earth.

Again, thanks for putting up so many classics!"

THANK YOU for the comments bro, but I gotta tell ya unfortunately I don't have that one..although I will try and track it down.  
15 years ago when I started collecting these I focused primarily on the 50's and early 60's as these were the flicks I grew up with and remember the most.  I will attempt to find some of the later era movies as some of them were quite good...until then

Enjoy!!"
