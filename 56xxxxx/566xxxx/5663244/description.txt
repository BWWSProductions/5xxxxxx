World.War.II.Prisoner.Of.War.PC.Game(djDEVASTATEâ„¢)


Second World War. You are an American pilot, Captain Lewis Stone, who is thrown into a prison camp of the Nazis. While attempting to escape the camp, Captain Stone discovers about a secret weapon the Germans are developing to use against the Allies. Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning.

"Prisoner of War" could be best described as a sneaking game. Unlike other well-known games which feature the sneaking element - such as "Metal Gear Solid 2" or "Deus Ex" - "Prisoner of War" is based on it entirely. You are helpless in the prison camp and your only weapon is your wit. Sneak past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hide items in your clothes, stay in shadows to avoid being recognized - this is what the game is about. It also has a good deal of puzzle-solving, like in a traditional adventure.
