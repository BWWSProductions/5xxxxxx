thanks for the comment 
cracking games is not easy and it will take time to learn if you have games to upload i recomend using alcholol 120% to make images of your games and upload them :)"

,augzlet23,2010-09-11T23:36Z,is there any other way to install it than burning it to CD? please reply ASAP!
,mattnd,2010-12-18T19:25Z,"audzlet23, you can ""burn"" the CD image to a virtual drive on you hard drive. Make your computer thin that a small section of your HD is actually an optical drive. The tools for this depend on your operating system. Since you downloaded this, I assume you're using windows, so go check out DAEMON tools."
,mattnd,2010-12-18T19:27Z,"Oh, and seed please... :)"
,rickurd,2011-01-16T12:03Z,"Thanks! I remember playing this when it came out, I thought it was really funny. But it never got much recognizition though."

I have downloaded to Win7 64Bit Pro, mounted it using Daemon lite, but now the game does not respond to mouse/keyboard.

Any ideas?"
