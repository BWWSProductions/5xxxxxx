Triumph - Remixed (DVD)

Few acts could whip an arena full of rockers into a frenzy as Triumph did throughout the late â€˜70s and â€˜80s, when the groupâ€™s best known line-up â€“ guitarist/vocalist Rik Emmett, bassist/keyboardist Mike Levine, and drummer/vocalist Gil Moore - were at the peak of their powers. And itâ€™s this exact time period that is focused on throughout Triumphâ€™s new â€œbest ofâ€ set - Greatest Hits: Remixed - which will be released on May 18, 2010.

All of the classic tunes that were - and continue to be - in heavy rotation on rock radio (and the early days of MTV) are included here, namely, â€œLay It on the Line,â€ â€œHold On,â€ â€œFight the Good Fight,â€ â€œMagic Power,â€ etc.

These fourteen tracks of anthemic metal have never sounded so good, as they were all recently remixed by Rich Chycki (who has previously worked with Aerosmith and Rush). The set also includes a previously unreleased recording - â€œLove Hurtsâ€ - which will be the lead-off single from Triumphâ€™s Greatest Hits: Remixed.

"We have been planning this release forever," says Levine. "For years, Triumph fans have been demanding that we give them a fresh greatest hits package and they are going to love this one."

Also included in the set is a DVD mixed in 5.1 audio, that features eleven promo and live videos in widescreen (plus additional unreleased videos for â€œChild of the City,â€ â€œBlinding Light Showâ€ and â€œLove Hurts,â€ and footage of the groupâ€™s 2008 induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame).

The deluxe two-disc package will be housed in a six-panel digipak â€“ including a 20-page color booklet, complete with liner notes, lyrics and chockfull of vintage photos.
