,Jd2,2010-09-17T14:32Z,I am unable to get this working. Could you please explain step by step what to do?
,catfishes,2010-09-26T19:43Z,Yup i got a virus soon as i opened it.
,PPG113,2010-09-30T14:55Z,"Confirmed malware. 
File name vace.exe contains at least a keylogger flagged by kaspersky and google mail (file sent to kaspersky labs for further study), as well as adds a start up entry for a process named w9q42k53 or some such that trys to mimic windows update and have the user download another file. And while the rest of the files seem to be partially legit, they are unrunnable/savable. AVOID."
,wastedfate,2011-05-10T21:49Z,"Vace.exe is a virus, like all of Kaiz0u's uploads. If anyone can upload a working version of this, that would be nice, though it is only $5."
,vdarkeaglev,2011-08-03T07:09Z,"From what I've read about this torrent on other sites is that if you use winrar, 7-zip, ect. you can circumvent the vace.exe virus by extracting the other files manually. I will try this method and let you guys know if this works if not, I wont be back for a bit for virus removal."
,vdarkeaglev,2011-08-03T07:31Z,no good the required file for setup.bat is vace.v which is also infected according to Avast! therefore install is impossible. I really wanted to try this game before I bought it to see if I even like it ... and this seems to be the only torrent for this game around. If I do find a good working file I will post it for everyone to enjoy.
