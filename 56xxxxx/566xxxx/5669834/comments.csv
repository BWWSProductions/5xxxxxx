,retardoface,2010-08-09T04:42Z,"max that a cd can allow is 44.1/16 bit mon frere, this is 96 khz 24 bit, requires a dvd to burn it, or use nero 10 multimedia suite. It will dither it straight to 44.1khz 16 bit for you."

Have listened to your work and it's really well done, only one thing, the sound level is unfortunately pumping quite much when a crescendo or bass thump occurs, too sad because your intention and effort is well appreciated.
I really like the extended and airy sound of the cymbals, one of the most difficult instruments to reproduce because of its complex and high frequency nature, I wonder if the high frequency was a bit elevated but nothing that disturbed. 

Thanks so much for you work!"
