,mrneo1,2010-07-01T15:08Z,thanks for the up load bone is this the edited version with parts cut out and if so do those parts even matter to the plot of the movie thanks for everything by the way
,Flopis,2010-07-01T15:36Z,"The original is 2hr 12mins. The edited version is 2hr 6mins. The cut parts are where the Fighting Dragons coach was extra mean. I don't know if this is the original or the censored version.
I, for one, would like to see it as the director originally intended to be watched.
Which one is this Bone?
And by the way, thanks for all your incredible hard work!!!"
