From Wiki:


Thomas Earl "Tom" Petty (born October 20, 1950) is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He is the frontman of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and was a founding member of the late 1980s supergroup Traveling Wilburys and Mudcrutch. He has also performed under the pseudonyms of Charlie T. Wilbury, Jr. and Muddy Wilbury.

He has recorded a number of hit singles with the Heartbreakers and as a solo artist, many of which remain heavily played on adult contemporary and classic rock radio. His music, notably his hits, has become popular among younger generations as he continues to host sold-out shows.[1] Throughout his career, Petty and his collaborators have sold 60 million albums.[2]

Petty and his band the Heartbreakers celebrated their 30th anniversary with a tour in 2006, though Petty has occasionally released solo work, such as 2006's Highway Companion[3], on which he performed most of the backing instrumentation. Members of the Heartbreakers have played on each of his solo albums and the band has always backed him when touring in support of those albums. He has also toured with Mudcrutch in order to promote their debut album.

Petty has been managed by Tony Dimitriades since 1976.[4] On February 3, 2008, Petty and the Heartbreakers performed at the Super Bowl XLII Halftime show.





Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers 1976


Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is the eponymous debut album by the band of the same name, released in late 1976.

Initially following its release, the album received little attention in the United States. Following a British tour, it climbed to #24 on the UK album chart and the single "Anything That's Rock 'n' Roll" became a hit in the UK. After nearly a year and many positive reviews, the album reached the U.S. charts, where it climbed to #55 in 1978 and eventually went Gold. The single "Breakdown" cracked the Top 40 in the U.S. and "American Girl" became an FM radio staple which can still be heard today.[1]

The album was recorded and mixed at the Shelter Studio, Hollywood, California.

You're Gonna Get It! is the second album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released in 1978. Originally, the album was to be titled Terminal Romance. Like its self-titled predecessor, this album includes tight melodic songs awash in ringing guitars and organ. It reached #23 on Billboard's Top LP's & Tapes chart in 1978.

Damn The Torpedoes 1979


Damn the Torpedoes is the third album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released in 1979 by MCA Records.[1] It was released to commercial success and critical acclaim becoming the band's breakthrough album.[1] In 2003, the album was ranked number 313 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.


Damn the Torpedoes was the Heartbreakers first for MCA Records.[1] Their old label, Shelter, had been sold to MCA. Petty struggled to legally detach himself from MCA, resulting in his bankruptcy.[1] In the end the record company backed down, and he negotiated a deal that allowed him to release his recordings on the new Backstreet Records label, manufactured and distributed by MCA.[1] The album was recorded at Sound City in Van Nuys and Cherokee Studios in Hollywood.[2] The title is a reference to a famous quote by Admiral David Farragut: "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!".

Damn the Torpedoes was released in October of 1979. The album was a breakthrough for Petty and the Heartbreakers. It was his first top 10 album rising to #2 hit (for seven weeks and kept from #1 by Pink Floyd's The Wall) on the Billboard's Albums chart.[3] It yielded two songs that made the top-fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, "Don't Do Me Like That" (#10) and "Refugee" (#15). It was a commercial success as well. Thanks to the new co-producer Jimmy Iovine, Damn the Torpedoes proved to be a major leap forward in production.

Hard Promises 1981


Hard Promises is the fourth album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released in May, 1981. Its original working title was Benmont's Revenge.[1] It features guest vocals from Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac on the duet "Insider". They would also record the hit "Stop Draggin' My Heart Around" for Nicks' album Bella Donna.

This was the second Tom Petty album on the Backstreet Records label. The album's release was delayed while Petty and his distributor MCA Records argued about the list price. The album was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following Steely Dan's Gaucho and the Olivia Newton-John/Electric Light Orchestra Xanadu soundtrack. This so-called "superstar pricing" was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98.[2] Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album or naming it Eight Ninety-Eight were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase.[3]

During the recording of the album John Lennon was scheduled to be in the same studio at the same time. Tom Petty was looking forward to meeting him when he came in. The meeting would never occur; unfortunately, John Lennon was shot before he could ever make it into the studio. In order to pay tribute to one of their influences the band decided to etch "WE LOVE YOU JL" on the master copy of the album. To this day "WE LOVE YOU JL" is seen on every Hard Promises vinyl copy pressed.[4] The album's title comes from a line in the chorus of "Insider".

Long After Dark 1982


Long After Dark is the fifth album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released in November 1982 on Backstreet Records. Notable for the major MTV hit "You Got Lucky", the album was also the first to feature the late Howie Epstein on bass and harmony vocals. Epstein's vocals are evident throughout the album, most notably on "Change of Heart". From this point on Epstein's vocals became an integral part of the Heartbreakers' sound. There was a song recorded for this album called "Keeping Me Alive", which Petty himself is very fond of but the producer, Jimmy Iovine, disliked. Petty has expressed that he feels the album would have turned out better if the song had been included on the album.

Southern Accents 1985


Southern Accents is a 1985 album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. "Don't Come Around Here No More," cowritten by Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics, peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its music video featured Alice in Wonderland imagery. "Southern Accents" was later covered by Johnny Cash for his Unchained album in 1996, on which members of the Heartbreakers play.

The recording sessions saw some tension between the band members, as each had a different vision for the album. Originally conceived as a concept album, the theme of "Southern Accents" became somewhat murky with the inclusion of three songs co-written by Stewart, and three other songs originally planned for the album left off. Songs cut from the track list include "Trailer," "The Image of Me" and "The Apartment Song." These can be found on Playback, a box set released 10 years later that included familiar songs with outtakes, b-sides and other rarities.

While mixing the opening track "Rebels" Petty became frustrated and punched a wall, severely breaking his left hand. Subsequent surgery on his hand left him with several pins, wires and screws to hold his hand together

This album features more songwriting collaborations between Petty and Mike Campbell than any other Petty album.

Echo 1999


Echo is the 10th studio album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. First released in April 1999, the album reached #10 on the Billboard 200 aided by the singles "Free Girl Now," "Swingin'" and "Room At The Top," which hit #5, #17 and #19 respectively on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1999. The album was the band's last collaboration with producer Rick Rubin, and was also the last to feature contributions from long time bassist/vocalist Howie Epstein, who died of a heroin overdose in 2003. Echo was certified Gold (500,000 copies sold) by the R.I.A.A. in July of 1999, only three months after it was released. Echo is the only Heartbreakers' album to contain a lead vocal from another member of the band: Mike Campbell on "I Don't Wanna Fight."

Only a handful of songs were played on the band's tour that year, and none have been played since 2000. The record was largely written during a period when Petty was going through a painful divorce (influencing the lyrics of songs such as "Lonesome Sundown" and the title track), and Petty has cited that as the reason for his preference not to play any songs from the album in concert. However, "Room at the Top", "Free Girl Now" and "I Don't Wanna Fight" all appear in the concert film "High Grass Dogs: Live at the Fillmore" and a version of "Billy the Kid" appears on "The Live Anthology". Out of all the songs on this album, "Billy the Kid" has been played the most in concert.

The Last DJ 2002


The Last DJ is the eleventh studio album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The tracks "The Last DJ", "Money Becomes King", "Joe", and "Can't Stop the Sun" are attacks on the greediness of the music industry.

Although he first claimed that the album and title track were both works of fiction, Petty later admitted that both were inspired by Los Angeles DJ Jim Ladd[1], although he had already claimed this on Ladd's radio show, prior to the album's release.

A "limited edition" digipack version of the album was also released, including a DVD of music videos and other footage shot during the album's production.

The album reached #9 on the Billboard 200 aided by the single "The Last DJ" which hit #22 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks in 2002. As of 2010, The Last DJ has sold 353,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan.[2]

In an episode of The Simpsons entitled "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation", Homer receives song-writing lessons from Tom Petty, and in the original airing the track "The Last DJ" can be heard playing over the radio in the final scene. The song was changed for syndication.

Mojo 2010


Mojo is the twelfth studio album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released on June 15, 2010 on CD and June 29 on BD.[1][2] It is his first album with the Heartbreakers in eight years.[3] Mojo debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 125,000 copies in its first week of release.[4] The first single "I Should Have Known It" is currently sitting at number 42 on Billboards Rock Songs Chart


In November 2009, Petty told Rolling Stone's David Fricke that it was his intention to record the album live in the studio without overdubs.[5]

He said of the album's tone, "It's blues-based. Some of the tunes are longer, more jammy kind of music. A couple of tracks really sound like the Allman Brothers â€” not the songs but the atmosphere of the band."

Tom Petty Solo 





Full Moon Fever 1989


Full Moon Fever is the first solo album by Tom Petty, though it features contributions from several members of his backing band, the Heartbreakers, along with fellow members of the Traveling Wilburys.[1][2] The record shows Petty exploring his musical roots with nods to his influences.[3] The songwriting was mainly collaborations between Petty and Jeff Lynne who was also a producer on the album. The album became a commercial and critical success peaking in the top five on the Billboard 200 and being certified 5x platinum in the United States and 6x platinum in Canada.

Petty had just finished the last Heartbreakers tour behind the album Let Me Up (I've Had Enough) when he decided to record a new album.[1] Since the songs that Petty and Electric Light Orchestra front man/Traveling Wilbury collaborator Jeff Lynne co-wrote sounded "nothing like Heartbreakers songs"[3], Petty decided to record the album as a solo effort. At first, this stirred a bit of controversy amongst some of the Heartbreakers although all of them, except the drummer Stan Lynch, contribute to the album.[1] Recording was a low-key affair with many of Petty's friends contributing including the members of the Traveling Wilburys, minus Bob Dylan.[1] A few songs were recorded for this album that did not make it: "Down the Line" and "Don't Treat Me Like A Stranger" were among them, and were released as b-sides. During the sessions, Petty wrote "Indiana Girl", an early draft of what would eventually become "Mary Jane's Last Dance".

The album is noted for being heavily influenced by Jeff Lynne resulting in a cleaner and glossier version of the Heartbreakers roots rock from previous albums.[1][2] Lynne incorporated layers of keyboards and backing vocals giving it a Beatlesque feel.[1][2] The songs show Petty paying dues to his influences with a Byrds cover ("I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better") and a nod to Del Shannon in "Runnin' Down a Dream". Other songs, such as "Free Fallin'" show Petty addressing nostalgia on his rise to fame.

The album became Petty's commercial peak as an artist helped by favorable critical reviews and three hit singles.[11] The album was released on April 24, 1989 and rose to eventually peak at #3 on the Billboard 200 and number 8 in the UK.[4] Petty released five singles from the album, two hitting the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 and three topping the Mainstream Rock chart.[12] The RIAA certified Full Moon Fever 5x platinum on October 5, 2000 and the CRIA certified it 6x platinum on September 18, 1991.[5][6]

Critical praise was generally high with Allmusic giving the album 4 and a half stars, admiring the craft of the album and rivaling it with the Heartbreakers' Damn the Torpedoes.[2] This review notes there are no weak tracks on the album calling it a "minor masterpiece".[2] The original Rolling Stone review compared the album favorably to the Traveling Wilburys first album, Volume 1, saying it has the "same restless charm", but commenting that the album, at times, seems "sprawling".[1] The review claims the album is "another rewarding, low-key side project for Petty" giving it 3 and a half stars out of five.[1] A later Rolling Stone biographer claims Full Moon Fever was a "masterful solo album".

Wildflowers 1994


Wildflowers is the second solo album by American musician Tom Petty, released in November 1994 (see 1994 in music). The album was the first released by Petty after signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records and the first of three albums produced by Rick Rubin.

Three singles were released from the album between 1994 and 1995, the most successful of which, "You Don't Know How It Feels", reached #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Album Rock Tracks chart for one week.

The album features all members of the Heartbreakers with the exception of drummer Stan Lynch, who left the band earlier in 1994. Steve Ferrone plays drums on Wildflowers and would join the band officially the following year. However, the album was not credited to the Heartbreakers because, in Petty's words, "Rick (Rubin) and I both wanted more freedom than to be strapped into five guys."
