[T],RedHatcc,2010-07-02T03:02Z,Sorry you have to mod your console to play burnt games. You can find more info and support about that in our forums.

,willywonka111111,2010-07-04T06:03Z,"I just wish people would realise that pal/ntsc u is NOT region free ! There are a lot of gamers in the asian region who cannot play these games.
Other well known uploaders such as gamerguy are also guilty. This is the second copy i have downloaded only to find on abgx that it isn't rf @!!!!"

,johnnydee1,2010-07-12T00:39Z,imgburn cant read file after extraction
,RedRooster86,2010-07-21T07:29Z,"Same as johnnydee1......imgburn cant read file after extraction.. But if you select the .ISO file it will burn it then.(still dont work)

Abgx.. doesnt verify..

Video Partition does not match known data (could be courrupt or new wave not seen before)

Video   CRC Does not match
V0       CRC Does not match


Hitachi   iX 1.51

Wave 4 in Abgx  (other torrents say it should be wave 6)

Tryd wave patcher to wave 2, i can select to play game, it loads... no pic but there is sound.. then xbox plays up.... :(

Burned using IMGburn, Verbatim DVD+R DL "
,mrkmhtet,2010-07-25T15:13Z,"Thanks for upload but u r lying. Change your name I downloaded this already but it just a waste of time. I can't trust your stuff anymore, Naughty bear RF also the same thing. NOT region free."
,superdryguy2k10,2010-08-13T21:13Z,This also didn't work for me...its the 2nd guru fuel game that hasnt worked. It will not find the file when i send the .dvd file into IMG Burn....!! Can anyone help!?
,superdryguy2k10,2010-08-13T21:14Z,"This doesnt work, imgburn says it cannot find the file....same as jonny dee says....this will not work! Unless anyone can enlighten me!?"
,superdryguy2k10,2010-08-13T21:16Z,Also tried to hack your computer....complete bullshit!!
,activaton,2010-08-24T20:59Z,is this playable in europe???
,bwcprettyboy,2010-08-25T22:39Z,"Has anyone gotten this game to work yet? I've downloaded it and cant' seem to get it to work on my xbox360, no even with the activate xbox360 disc....so if anyone can leave some helpful comments on how to get this thing to work I would really appreciate it and I'm sure others will too. 

I'm have a US xbox360 and after running this through abgx360 it says its NTSC/U and Pal(I think didn't pay much attention to that since it doesn't pertain to me)

Burned it to Verbatim DVD+R disc (bluish surface)  using ImgBurn

Tried to play it and got a message saying something about clean my disc. 

So I would like to know if anyone got it working and how did you do that.  Am I using the wrong disc, the wrong program to burn, the wrong xbox360 to play it, what am I doing wrong? 

Thanks for your time 

Oh and RedHatcc need to write a tutorial on this for people like me. "

,SuperTsubasa,2011-06-06T03:41Z,"to help out future downloaders i can say that this file is FINE but CAUTION with the .dvd that has a DIFFERENT name from the iso, just delete it and the abgx with autofix set to 3 will fix, all green on abgx, just burn it with verbatin on 2,4 speed and HAVE FUN."
