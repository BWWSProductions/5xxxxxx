I don't think any of us ever considered that the material on tpb might have originated somewhere else....Could it really be? Is it even possible?

I'm shocked... Shocked i say!

I just hope you're on the case bro. With any luck, you're going through everything available through tpb and helpfully labeling each uploader as pussy/nonpussy, based on the file's provenance. 

Hopefully people won't get the idea that maximizing distribution points benefits everyone....'cause that would be wrong.

 Right?

What a valuable service you've provided, SoftWarez....What an astute observation. 

What a freakin genius."

This is the Chinese version of the movie, and China is not a democracy. They took out everything that they though made China look bad, or even less powerful than the almighty usa. as ridiculous as it sounds...that means alot of the fight scene parts where Dre (Jaden Smith) gets great hits in, or even makes jokes with Jackie. Some of the best parts are taken out, imho, and my kids made me take them to see this three times in the theatre so i should know lol. Great movie though. Also, props to hiest for uploading. "

,Esmad3,2010-07-16T10:00Z,"This has nothing to do with the original. It\'s not even karate. Ofc it isn\'t, I mean the original Miyagi was japanese, this takes place in china, and Jackie Chans art is Kung Fu. Besides, these are little kids. The original kid was 16, an age where u can actually and believably hurt someone without having your dad around to help. Never in ten trillion years would this little pipsqueak be in a movie like this if it wasn\'t for his daddy."
,Tamarind777,2010-07-18T08:42Z,"I am sorry, but it's hard to watch Will Smith's kid, he's is just such a horrible actor. Even in the very opening of the movie he is so unconvincing. It just looks like he is ""trying"" in every scene he does. I know he is a kid, but give him time to study and train before you invest so much in him as an ""actor."" Furthermore, his dad is not a good character actor either, but is good personality comedian since he is just naturally funny. Acting funny and ""being"" funny are two different things. When is funny he is being himself, but I don't think he can act out such a role without injecting himself into it.

Sorry for the yammering, but it's just my two cents. Take it easy on me, I am still a huge Will Smith fan. But his kid? Hmmm...I don't think so."
