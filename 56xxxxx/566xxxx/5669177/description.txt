***I CAN ONLY SEED THIS FOR 2 DAYS SO PLEASE SEED MORE THAN YOU USUALLY WOULD***

If it dies, you can find it on demonoid

Sorry about the yelling, but I am uploading it 7/4 and removing it 7/6 and will not be seeding it again for quite a while.

This took me 4 days to download on that POS emule so please be generous with your seeding so others don't have to wait that long

This contains:

- the Conversational course (10 lessons) which are found as separate mp3 files 

- a small ZIP file with the booklet, grammar guide and a photo that goes with the conversational course

- a large ZIP file that contains the Basic course plus advanced lessons, plus Reading lessons.

However, this does NOT have the reading material that goes along with the reading book lessons. I wish I knew where to find it, but I don't. If you have it PLEASE let me know ASAP and post a torrent of your own.

You can still listen to them without the reading material and pick up some things.
