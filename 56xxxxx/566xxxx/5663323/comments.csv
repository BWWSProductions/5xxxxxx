,Fel_40,2010-07-29T01:29Z,thank you very much n___n
,Mayuri,2010-07-30T06:13Z,"Haar47, Yes this is worth downloading. :)

I would suggest downloading an Cbr application; http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/cbr to open the files. It's actually so much better than opening up pure jpeg/png files. Highly recommend it."
,Mayuri,2010-07-30T07:32Z,"I want to add an additional rebuttal. After getting the Bleach Manga 1 - 410 Up To Date cbr files I went to download the cbr application to run the files. The first file ran perfectly but it seems to me that the rest of the files would not run. It would give me this error: ""Could not open (C:\Documents and Settings\Mahname\My Documents\Vuze Downloads\Bleach/030.cbr: it's not a valid RAR archive.""

I believe most of the files are corrupted."
,digiwebguy,2010-08-17T11:26Z,"@mayuri: 
the files are not corrupt.To open the cbr files that do not open, right click the file and choose open with winrar. when it opens up, extract the files and you can read them as png image files or you can download manga reader, open up manga creator, load the image files you extracted and save it as a new cbr file that can be read with any cbr file reader.

,digiwebguy,2010-08-17T11:41Z,"@mayuri:
the files are not corrupt. to open the files that are unable to load in the cbr reader, right click on them and choose open with winrar and extract the files. this will allow you to view the files as png image files. you can also download and insatall manga reader. once installed run manga creator. load the image files you extracted to the program and save it as a new cbr file this allows you to open it in any cbr viewer"
,Mayuri,2010-09-02T04:12Z,"digiwebguy, I have a manga reader installed on my machine... if you go to the link that I've provided is the application that is currently on my machine at this time. I still wasn't able to open almost all of the files that was on this torrent. I was only able to open the first one and that was it. I honestly don't want to be right clicking them and viewing them in PNG form... thats why I prefer cbr format.  I was able to create 4 Cbr format bleach manga's and was able read it without receiving the errors so theirs nothing wrong in on my side. If you want you can upload the working version of the cbr files and I'll download from you. "
,Pike84,2011-01-27T12:27Z,"Those comic readers are useless, Windows's picture and fax viewer is fine. Just use WinRAR to extract the picture files from the .cbr:s."
,iponbks,2011-06-14T08:53Z,"hey... I need some help here - the .cbr can't be opened except for the first one... I'm using Comical to read them. can anyone help? and when I tried to open them with winrar, there's no option to extract them... so I went like this:
002.cbr -> add to 002.rar -> extracted the 002 rar -> opened the .cbr, still can't open...
any help?"
