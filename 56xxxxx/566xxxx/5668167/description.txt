         Marcus, Stephen and Bill have traveled 500 miles on their     
         journey down the Mississippi and rainstorms are pushing       
         the river above flood stage, making the trip even more        
         dangerous. But unpredictable waters aren't their biggest      
         concern; it's the four- to six-foot high waves that the       
         barges create -- if they don't stay on their toes, they       
          could be swallowed by a wave and capsize!
