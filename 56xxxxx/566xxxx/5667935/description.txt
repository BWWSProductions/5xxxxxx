  CBC's "The Arrow". In the fifties, Canada needed a high speed fighter/intercetpor
aircraft, fit for arctic duty. After contacting the usual suspects globally, and being told
it was impossible, Canada turned to its own to design and build it. The machine was a
phenomenal piece fo equipment, its design fundamentals can be seen in virtually
every high-performance jet (even the space shuttle) flying today.
  Approx three hours long, file should recode to DVD for those so inclined.
