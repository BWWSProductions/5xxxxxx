Starting 0 Cancer of 2010 I decided to challenge myself to make an album every day. Pelican Music Stuff is open source, and my diary for music. It focuses more on quanity rather than quality, and my goal is put words to my feelings and time capsule them...create the songs I want to hear, that don't exist yet.

All 23 albums pre0 Cancer, are called "Old Testament" Songs. Here are 40 Old Testament songs from the book "ANDREW" including albums "The Wish/Gemini", "To Any Door...Only Windows", and my musical vacation from the name Pelican Music Stuff "102390 2125 Lebanon PA"


i wish others to steal my songs and make them better
