Cherie is initially thrilled to be in the band, and lives the rock star life. She pushes the edge -- and their records sell well, generating lots of media controversy and hype. But during the tour of Japan, her personal life disnintegrates, and she burns out -- ultimately leaving The Runaways when they return to the U.S. The bass player (Jackie Fox) quits too, leaving only Lita Ford, Joan Jett and Sandy West. Joan Jett has decided that rock & roll is her life, and that The Runaways is her 'family'; she is upset by Cherie's decision to leave, but knows that decision is best -- for Cherie
