They stupidly left the story hanging with an entire third season canceled. ANOTHER AWESOME series. The 2 seasons they did make are out and can be bought at HBO.com in a set of the 2 plus interviews with cast and why it was canceled. Thanks again. I really liked this series. Since LOST is over, I found a similar vibe coming from this series. It had the same way LOST did in that the characters are suddenly having strange things happening and unknown events to come are begining to reveal the first parts of what is going on. I had assumed that this series would eventually have more unknowns and off shoots from these bizarre things go on when this MAGIC MAN is starting to slowly become a threat again. Who ever he is. . .I guess we will NEVE know??? a real disappointment. I will still pray it gets to continue and doesn't get canceled. take care!"
,ethanje,2010-07-02T14:23Z,What is it with american networks? Carnivale: brilliant but cancelled; Jericho: again excellent but cancelled: Odyssey 5 was also great. But no these all get cancelled whilst shit like Chuck and so many cop shows all doing the same yawn thing say and continue indefinitely. I'm getting really sick of finding a great promising show that is cancelled because the plot is too difficult for the average simpleton to follow. Do me a favour and stick to shows for dunnies and allow the rest of us to have some challenge to our viewing.
