,juliaroyale,2010-07-06T08:24Z,You don't have any of the spoil sets do you?
,SilvWolf,2010-07-06T09:56Z,"Thank you for this HypnoHead, It's always good to see new material here. 

Now heres a warning Im abou t to rant, and I want juliaroyale  to know this isn't aimed at you but at all the people i see doing this .

And maybe it's just the late hour but Dang it folks, why does EVERY SINGLE hypnosis torrent on this site have people asking ""do you have this one? do you have that one? Theres an old saying that goes beggers can't be choosers, if you arn't going to buy the recordings for your self, then learn to be happy with whats offered. Im getting ticked off at the lack of gratitude people show. If we are lucky theres roughly one new FDhypno session uploaded a month, and thats probably being generous. 

I know not everyone can afford to buy the sessions they want to hear, I can't afford very many either but I'm just getting sick of all the beggers here, A new uploader appeared, hes said there is more comming and if this trend  continues we may very well scare him away >.<

*goes to have a nap*"

no i don't have spoil sets. i'm not an atm, can't afford those. 

@silvwolf
You'r welcome :) i love to share haha. i'll try to upload 'new' stuff. Its hard though, as i don't know what has been uploaded already and i'm reluctant to look through all the torrents here...so, sorry! i'll try my best though. "
,maRRRRtin,2010-07-21T19:21Z,thanks ..great stuff:)
,Sattori,2010-07-28T20:48Z,"Hi Hypnohead. It's kind of cool to see a ""Recording Pack"" of Kasha here. But I don't understand your argument ""reluctant to look through all the torrents"" in order to see if somethings upped before. What's so difficult with just typing ""Kasha Shakti"" in the search box? Try it and you will find the torrents within seconds. But I am also kind of a bum so it's allright with me ;)"
,Agent008t,2010-08-06T03:32Z,"I am looking for some Spoil sets as well. In particular the ""chastity training"" one. Would anyone be interested in a group buy?"
,yafartum,2010-08-10T01:35Z,"hey, thanks for the upload! Nice to see new people contributing!"
,Doggmeat,2011-07-30T21:35Z,"Can this really ""Change"" you forever?"
