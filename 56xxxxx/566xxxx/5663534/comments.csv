,kevspar79,2010-07-21T12:33Z,"at last some one with good subs, i have tried all the big named people who put out great torrents but no working subs. thanks tinstaafl"
,tedxc0re,2010-11-13T10:29Z,"took a second to find the seeder, and wow subtitle works perfectly with my video (not split into cd 1-2), first time using subtitles and had to comment on how great it worked."
,Zamrig242,2011-05-30T10:34Z,"Hate to ask, I am new to having a separate sub file.  I have the Nodlab Dragon Tattoo download [CD1 & CD2] and I just downloaded these .ssa files.  How do I...'implant' them into the video files to get them to work properly?

Thanks to the uploader and all seeders!"
,PeeKay123,2011-07-03T08:17Z,"Hey Zamrig242
I have the same query myself. Did you get a reply?
Can't understand why the subs have to be separated from the video."
