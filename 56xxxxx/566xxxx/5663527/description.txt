a gritty telling of how many lives your wedding ring cost, 2 December 2006

Remember how Hotel Rwanda had the idea of "look how terrible things are in Africa, and you're doing nothing to stop it?" Blood Diamond is pretty much the same guilt trip repackaged, except it hits closer to home because the idea isn't that we simply do nothing to stop the blood shed, but we actually support it. If you want to know the how/why, you'll have to see it.

The gist of the story is this: DiCaprio plays a diamond smuggler who overhears about Djimon Hounsou's 100 karat diamond which he buried somewhere in Africa. Before this rock is even introduced to the story we already get the sense that something is horribly wrong in Africa, a resistance group (the RUF) is terrorizing the villages and using slaves to dig for diamonds. DiCaprio's character wants to split the diamond's profit with Hounsou, and in return he'll retrieve Hounsou's family from the KUBs and the refugee camps. There enlies the problem: how to go about doing all this without getting killed
