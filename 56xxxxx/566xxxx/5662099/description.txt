Release notes:

Symphonicities; the companion CD to accompany Sting's highly-anticipated world
tour, which begins June 2 in Vancouver, featuring the Royal Philharmonic Concert
Orchestra, conducted by Steven Mercurio (Bocelli, Pavarotti). The new studio
album, comprised of Sting's most celebrated songs re-imagined for symphonic
arrangement, serves as the ultimate commemoration of the live concert
experience. Created exclusively for the tour and correlating album, Sting's
greatest hits have been reinterpreted with brand new orchestrations arranged by
Jorge Calandrelli, David Hartley, Michel Legrand, Rob Mathes, Vince Mendoza,
Steven Mercurio, Bill Ross, Robert Sadin, and Nicola Tescari. In addition to
"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic," highlights include fan-favorites culled
from The Police songbook such as "Roxanne" and "Next To You," as well as songs
from Sting's enduring solo career including "Englishman in New York," "I Burn
for You," "Why Should I Cry for You," and "She's Too Good For Me," among others.
Symphonicities is produced by Rob Mathes and Sting, mixed by Elliot Scheiner
(Steely Dan, Fleetwood Mac) and Claudius Mittendorfer (Interpol, Franz
Ferdinand).Sting will also be joined by a quartet comprised of Dominic Miller
(Sting's longtime guitarist), David Cossin (a multi-percussion specialist in new
and experimental music and featured member of the Bang on a Can All-Stars), Jo
Lawry (vocalist), and Ira Coleman (bassist).
