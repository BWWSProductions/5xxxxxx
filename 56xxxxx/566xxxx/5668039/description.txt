Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)





Terrific DVD compilation of some of the best Cuban percussion playing on record. Although there is some exhibition playing by the great TatÃ¡ GÃ¼ines, most of the material here is rumba with a bit of santeria thrown in the mix. There are quite a few numbers by Los Papines, including some vintage footage, from the '50s or early '60s. Some of this Papines material -- as well as some of the TatÃ¡ GÃ¼ines footage, appears on another DVD entitled "Rumberos," but this is of superior quality. This one also includes material not on "Rumberos," specifically the tracks by Conjunto Folklorico Nacional and Yoruba Andabo. But the most amazing footage here is of Los Ibellis Junior, a folklore group consisting of kids, perhaps from ages 9 though 17, the lead singer and quinto player being the youngest of the band. He also plays Iya, the large batÃ¡ drum. This folks, is outstanding stuff that I have not come across before. It is a must-have for collectors of the genre. For Los Ibellis Junior alone, this one is... Highly Recommended. (review by Descarga)
