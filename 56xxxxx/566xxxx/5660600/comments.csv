,garfiel,2012-06-26T06:29Z,"Thanks MerlinBiggs for your uniformative foul mouthed comment. You go upload it then in non rar format.  Too lazy to upload I suppose???

Anyway people I downloaded the first episode and it's excellent quality.

A - 10
V - 10

Which is what we want to hear, not abuse from some one who did not bother to download it.

Now some info for the down loader on why rar's are generally not preferred.

If 1 rar piece is corrupt then gennerally the whole file is useless.  If an avi file is missing say 1 percent.  It is still playable.

People like to put up rar files and put in passwords and send you to some site for a password.

So avi's are preferred but I am happy to download rar's but I like to see comments from some one who has downloaded it saying they actually work or are passworded.

Thanks for the upload

and to those who have already downloaded it then leave a comment.  I's nice for up loaders to get a thank you and a comment on their torrent, it keeps them uploading stuff."
