The original torrent had damaged files and I found these on a newsgroup (much better than torrents) and I'm here to share the files with those that have been stuck at 99.9%.

The damaged and missing files (4 blocks missing):
s-monthy.r32
s-monthy.r69
septic-mptmol.nfo


If you have PAR2 & can reconstruct, then DL the PARS you need. If you don't have PAR2, you can re-download .r32 & .69 & the .nfo.

septic-mptmol.nfo
s-monthy.r32
s-monthy.r69

s-monthy.vol000+01.PAR2
s-monthy.vol001+02.PAR2
s-monthy.vol003+04.PAR2
s-monthy.vol007+07.PAR2
s-monthy.vol014+11.PAR2
s-monthy.vol025+21.PAR2
s-monthy.vol046+27.PAR2
s-monthy.vol073+27.PAR2
s-monthy.vol100+27.PAR2

I'll keep this up till those that were stuck at 99.9% have finished. Hope this helps!
