Japanese stereo.
This movie doesn't use the US soundtrack stereo:/

audio is in English dubbing, with stupid english subtitle that is COMPLETELY different to what they say.

I don't mind the subtitle but I just don't like the bland Japanese track. It doesn't have the US kick ass music"

this version uses the japanese stereo like the description says.
You won't hear the awesome rock music from US stereo.

Also a english subtitle shows at the bottom that doesn't spell what the audio english is saying"
