Retardoface - I didn't even realize how great this album was until i heard this version, thats how amazing it sounds. Sounds like If Everyone Was Listening and Asylum eluded me in the past but now have become quite my favorites. In my opinion and Aksmans' Best Sounding Version Ever..... 

Comments would be appreciated
