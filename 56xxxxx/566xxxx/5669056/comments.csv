Using ffmpeg / mencoder to convert takes forever.  Half the people out there are probably having the same problem.  Please upload lower resolution as well / instead.  One can hardly tell the difference anyway.  Also please use codecs supported by HTML5 (ex. VP8 / WebM or Ogg Theora)."

Thanks for sharing!"
,etheryus,2010-08-23T15:02Z,"Yes... the mkv quality is so high, my computer plays 1 second and stops while audio is still on... I guess you need a good computer or a good dvd player for this one.

The audio is in english from england"
