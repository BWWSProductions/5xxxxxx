The tables are turned when pint-sized kids Carmen and Juni must rescue their secret-agent parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) from the diabolical clutches of Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub), who's after a powerful artificial brain that will automate his army of kid robots to do his bidding. Can world domination be far behind? Director Robert Rodriguez reteams with Desperado star Banderas for his first foray into children's films.
