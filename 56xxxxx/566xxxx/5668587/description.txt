         While the townspeople mourn the passing of Big Dave Duncan,   
         Merritt and Henley scheme to take back the mysterious hammer  
         that is once again in Peggy Haplin's possession. As Handsome  
         Dan chases down leads in the Magic Man kidnappings with a     
         suspiciously unabated fervor, Tommy thinks he smells a rat.   
         Tommy Conroy also discovers that his mother's death, which    
         he thought was caused by a stroke, might have a much darker   
         origin. Meanwhile, the widows at the Meadows Boarding House   
         don't hide their jealousy when Merritt accepts Peggy Haplin's 
         party invitation at Weeping Wall; and landlady Dot Meadows    
         comes to regret filing a police report after finding dead     
          birds in the woods.

         Since this show got cancelled twice and shows no signs of     
         ever coming back or getting released on DVD, we thought we    
         would release it for those who want to watch it but can't     
         use the streaming websites due to living outside the US.
