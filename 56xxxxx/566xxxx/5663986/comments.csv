,basilgirl,2010-07-03T05:52Z,"after tweaking in vlc, it is not too bad for free. 
makes me want to go to the theatre. 

this is a true twilight eclipse, though the beginning is weird, it goes to color after the intro. 
does have dark innocence in red throughout on bottom of screen.

for cam and so quick, i am not complaining. 
i was able to download this tonight, so it was pretty quick.
this is in english."
