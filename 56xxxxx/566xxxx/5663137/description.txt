NOTEZ:
As many of you probably know, ABC dropped the final two
episodes of Happy Town from their schedule therefore 
leaving the final two already filmed episodes unaired without
any air date in site (if ever). 
After a backlash from the fans, they have posted the final
two episodes for streaming. Being a huge fan of the 
series myself, i took the liberty of doing a webrip for
everyone. Especially since the streaming is US restricted
i believe. Better than not seeing the eps at all i figure,
enjoy fellow Happy Town Fans!!
