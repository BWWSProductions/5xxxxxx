I even wrote to ABC and e-mailed a 'grievance' and expressing how great this series is (at least to me as well) I amazingly got a reply.!? it was somewhat a generic type of: Quote, ""ABC's position is we cannot say any thing about any of our shows, with the exception of the info we have at our web site
: ABC.com"". It was longer but that is the tone of the letter. I truely hoe it isn't canceled. THANKS so much for getting these posted for us. .  MANY HUGE THANKS!!!"
