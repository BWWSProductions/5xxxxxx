The Shuttleworths was a comedy show that aired for five series on BBC Radio 4. 
It featured "versatile singer/songwriter from Sheffield, South Yorkshire" John Shuttleworth, 
his wife Mary, their two teenage children Darren and Karen, neighbour Ken Worthington and a host of other minor characters. All parts were voiced by comedian Graham Fellows.

Each fifteen minute episode was based around the musings of John on everyday life and interspersed with his own bizarre bouncy keyboard ditties on such varied matters as Austin Ambassadors, garden centres and toast, all performed (usually badly) on his Yamaha Portasound electronic keyboard.
