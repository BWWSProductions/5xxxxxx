,kanha,2010-07-04T07:48Z,"why somebody has given a -1 on quality??
i've d'loaded some uploads from YIFY, all r of nice nice quality and i'm sure that here it is also the same...."
,Dohab,2010-08-24T20:19Z,"@kanha
Hi,
the quality is more than good, I think (whoever rated this down) may was talking about that dropped-frames-like thingy, from time to time.

Maybe it's my player, I don't know.

I rated this up any way, it's great.
Thank you YIFY."
,dynamech,2010-12-23T11:20Z,Hi YIFY....... I'm new around here... I like your movies a lot... especially when my max download speed is 60 kBps.... Always luking to you man....... keep it up.........
,Sicarium,2010-12-24T18:38Z,"V:3 A:6

Audio sounds hollow, almost like fixed up cam audio. Good enough, but nowhere near a BR rip.

Video is just trash. Solid colors look watery. Blocking in mildly dark scenes. Goto the 10 minute mark, there's a few face shot of Smith talking. It looks like stop-gap animation. None of the motion is smooth, everything is jerky.

629kbps is simply too low for 720. If you're deadset on that bitrate, you need to drop this down to 480 with more reference frames.

Those people who think this is excellent quality have incredibly low standards."
,benbat27,2011-02-19T08:08Z,"Calling people ""soppy cunts"" is a bit rude, i don't like the scottish / british basterds that do that..."
,midurix,2011-05-03T21:19Z,"@benbat27 you say Scottish / British, do you realise that Scottish people are British? Bit like saying Californian / American. Doesn't make much sense!"
