For those who don't want to wait for crack for new patches, as SecuROM "eats" this image well

Make sure you have the latest daemon tools and YASU
For last DTLite you must rename DTLite.exe to daemon.exe

These images were made from russian release of OA, you will have a different language depending on which serial you will type in during installation


Instructions:
- Mount and install using this serial (910T-GX90V-F0W5D-HW94V-S7HGK courtesy of GENESiS) or any other serial you wish
- Optionally apply whatever patch is out there now
- Launch YASU
- Cloak drives
- Play the game


P.S. there maybe an easier way to bypass SecuROM with the image without crack, but I post this one just in case

P.P.S. If you are using last DTLite you must rename DTLite.exe to daemon.exe
