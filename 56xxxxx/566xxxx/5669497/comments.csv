As soon as my brodband capacity has recovered, I will start to seed again. I am so pleased if you could understand this, thank you for your understanding. I usually have a high seed speed. So I can tell you this: Wait 48 hours or so. Because It might be my brodband ISP (company) that have some trouble."
