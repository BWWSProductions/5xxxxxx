,EnemyDrone,2010-07-03T04:25Z,Why are you calling this a DVDRIP when its the same blurry R6 out??
,mizamon,2010-07-03T05:54Z,probably because some ppl are stupid.

,chap_aying,2010-07-03T12:57Z,"tvteam, you used to have good uploads. what happened?"
,SimplyMax,2010-07-03T20:36Z,The sample just sucks. Won't download that shit.
,dead_pirate_st3v3,2010-07-03T22:37Z,"Maybe someone has taken over TvTeam account. The real TvTeam gives you the resolution and stuff, and doesn't get things like 'dvdrip' wrong... Ifear we may have lost TvTeam reliability..."
,cowgirlbellydancer,2010-07-04T17:21Z,"tvteam, used to love your torrents, but after this crashed my comp 3 times (thought it was a fluke that it was happening), you lost credibility. sorry dude. "
