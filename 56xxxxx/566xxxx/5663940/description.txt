Documentary about Charles Manson, featuring lots of archive material and, as far as I know, the only interview with Bruce Davis. The documentary also contains interviews with Vincent Bugliosi, Lynette Fromme, Sandra Good, Dr. David E. Smith of the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic [LSD expert whose clinic also regularly treated the Manson girls for STDs and where Manson's Parole Officer Roger Smith held office. Both victim Abigail Folger and her mother volunteered at the Clinic] and, naturally, Charles Manson himself. Very interesting!

This footage has been transferred from VHS so the quality is far from perfect.
