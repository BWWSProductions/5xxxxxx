[V],poppedtart,2010-08-07T03:10Z,"they are not the same.

these are 100% compatible with all apple products and psp and android devices.  on.off.on releases are not.  OOO is trying to fix his encoding process to be more like these.

You clearly do not know what you are talking about.  This encoding profile was designed by HR.  I am simply continuing the process.

Everyone who even comes close to something like HR could be considered copying his profile.  No one has copied it yet.  Close imitations but all of them have flaws (except these).

These are simply the best there is.  It is a proven profile."
