In the first half of the program, scientist J. Marvin Herndon discussed methane gas fears in the Gulf disaster. "Petroleum and natural gas deposits largely come about as a consequence of the earth fracturing," he said, and if there are cracks at the site of the oil leak, the initial fracture could spread, and potentially release a huge methane bubble. There've been suggestions that mass extinctions occurred in the distant past due to methane releases, he noted. 

Richard C. Hoagland, who joined the conversation, said "we know there's a bulge-- the crust is literally being lifted upward in a ridge...and something is pushing it up, which is the pressurization of this extraordinary methane bubble they pierced with this deep well," which could be as deep as six miles down. If the methane bubble is released, it will cause water displacement that could create a massive tsunami, he warned. He called for the release of real time mud log data, so non-BP geologists could evaluate the situation.

In the latter half of the show, expert in theology, biblical languages, and world civilizations, Mike Heiser shared his research critique of Zecharia Sitchin's work. He believes Sitchin has imposed his own narrative on top of various Sumerian terms. Sitchin contends that the Annunaki traveled to Earth from a planet in an elliptical orbit in our solar system, called Nibiru, and then conducted genetic manipulation of hominids to create humans. But according to Heiser's research, Nibiru is never identified as a planet beyond Pluto, and the idea that the Annunaki come from off-Earth and used rocket technology is simply not in the Sumerian texts. 

The Annunaki are referred to as gods in the ancient texts, but Heiser believes they may have been spiritual or metaphysical entities, rather than travelers from outer space, and that there is no evidence of any genetic tinkering. Reviewing Cylinder Seal VA 243, which Sitchin contended showed the planet Nibiru in our solar system, Heiser argued that the central object in the Seal is not a sun but a star, and that the overall depiction is of a constellation, not a solar system.
