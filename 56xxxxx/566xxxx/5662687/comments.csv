Game runs perfectly fine until up to 
Chapter 5: An Alliance To Save Rodriguezâ€ 

Graphics are completely screwed up, white screen with large numbers of floating black squares floating towards the camera and the rest of the screen. 

The actual health meter and weapon number at the bottom of the screen is fine, no problem with sound either. Burned the game on two DVD-R DL and the same problem at the same point remains. 

I suspect there is an error and corrupt file relating to the graphic files relating to that mission chapter. 

Basically it's completely and utterly unplayable from Chapter 5. I don't know if the other Chapters would result in the same error, but since you can't see anything it's impossible to judge. 

To the upload I would suggest removing this torrent to save anymore people running into the same error. Also avoiding wasting hours of downloading time and wasting discs on this download.

To fellow downloaders, download at your own risk."
