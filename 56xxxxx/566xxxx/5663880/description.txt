"Scientology and Me" is a television documentary conducted by reporter John Sweeney, which aired on the BBC program, Panorama on 14 May 2007. The program gained particular controversy before and during filming due to unresolved differences on content and approach between Sweeney's production team and Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis, who did not want detractors or perceived enemies of the church to be interviewed or included in the documentary.
