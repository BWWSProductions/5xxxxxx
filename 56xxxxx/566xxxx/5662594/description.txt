Release notes:

Their ninth offering, 'Korn III - Remember Who You Are,' is their first effort
for brand new label home, Roadrunner Records, and it bursts at the seams with
that very feeling that defined the band from the get-go. Each song unleashes an
uneasiness reminiscent of Korn's earliest and most unbridled material, but
there's also a modern refinement that's epic in its execution. Korn definitely
don't lose sight of their roots on 'Korn III - Remember Who You Are,' but they
also venture into uncharted darkness. All that truly matters is where they're
going. The album strikes a balance between their past and their future, as it
finds the band reuniting with producer Ross Robinson, who manned the boards for
their first two records, all the while joining forces with Roadrunner Records,
the world's leading rock label. With 'Korn III - Remember Who You Are,' it's
their time...

Enjoy!
