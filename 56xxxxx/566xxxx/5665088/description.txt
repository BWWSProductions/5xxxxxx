Lost Films Of Laurel And Hardy is a 9 volume DVD set of (mostly) L&H 
in (mostly) silent short films. But they are neither lost nor entirely
L&H. There are typically 6 short films per DVD, with half L&H as a team,
but the rest will be L&H together in the same film, but not teamed up,
Laurel or Hardy on their own, working with other comedians, or other 
comedians from the Hal Roach studios, often Charley Chase, an unjustly 
forgotten comedian from the silent era in some excellent short comedies.

The quality of the video, for the most part, is excellent, given how old
many of these are. The audio, though, leaves a bit to be desired. It's
stock Hal Roach music, and is good enough, but isn't synched with the 
video, and is repeated from film to film, until you get sick of it.

Volume 1 starts off with a bang with one of the best-known and best of  
all silent film comedy shorts (Big Business), and 2 more top-rate L&H 
films (Do Detectives Think? and The Finishing Touch). There are also 2  
Stan Laurel shorts, and an L&H together, but not partners.
