[V],pluto999,2010-07-05T15:20Z,"I didn't know the godfather 1 one was so popular or people just couldn't download and run away cause i had stopped seeding. From what I'm seeing, there's atleast 71 peers. So i expect atleast 50 person will seed this. 


If you can't seed more then seed atleast 1:1 give what you had taken."
