,Osiris69,2010-08-17T14:40Z,"Personally, for safety reasons, if you can download this from the official site and get the same thing, I'd rather do that then download it from an underground site 'cause of the risk of trojan horses being stuck inside the copy.  Call me paranoid, but wouldn't you rather get it from the official site versus downloading it from an underground site where viruses and trojans are known to appear from time to time?  And I'm not talking about false positives either!  Just food for thought, folks.  And just my humble 2 cents.  ;)  Happy gaming!"
[V],dias_vld,2010-08-20T02:47Z,"I followed the instructions and when the downloads from the EA servers finish it says ""unable to create d3d device and a lot of numbers""...anyone knows whats going on? Tks!!"
,jp56320,2010-08-28T15:08Z,fuck ! the Game launcher is out dated !
,mailamal,2010-08-29T18:36Z,"I don't see any point in keeeping this torrent alive.The  nfo says u have to  register in the website.Well once u register and try launching the game,it will ask if u would like to download updates along with a warning that if u don't update u can't play it.So well this is now simply a waste of bandwidth.Moreover once u register, the site asks if u want to download it.So guys better register here http://world.needforspeed.com/register and then start downloading the game rather than using this torrent.As always there could be some undetected trojans in the compliation,which is always a risk.I hope if other ppl have some opinion ... please share ....
May be simply as said above the launcher is outdated."

,paranormalguy,2010-09-18T03:20Z,"Once the game goes on the market, they will be shutting down the Online Beta Server, and you have to pay/crack for it, to play it.
Wanna play online? Buy it."

You extract the Zip Files. More important question is, ""How do you mastubate? """

,BMXfreestyle2011,2011-04-09T05:03Z,"To anyone asking about BoostHack, there is no such thing. A MMO game like this is a game ran on servers so when you get ""BoostHack"", it's just a bunch of buttons to make it look legit but they don't do anything."
