,as14ever,2010-07-03T19:16Z,"Movie request to any one that can do it. I have a request for some very hard movies to find as mpeg4 BRRip H264 AAC3 in resolutions: 1280x544 or 1280x720 or even 1920x1080p

The Movies are: Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "
[T],solstars,2010-07-04T04:50Z,The only way you'll get these is from an HDTV rip.  I'll add them to my search.  None of these are airing within the next 14 days.  I second the vote for Tron!
,jdawg7979,2010-07-04T08:53Z,Both conan's are up on TPB. Or atleast use to be. Try searching to see if they're still up. This is where i got them from.
[T],solstars,2010-08-16T02:01Z,I have Tron.  I'll be upping it shortly.
,kenjamen,2010-08-25T11:16Z,Anyone have a link or title to a smaller sized version of this?  This isn't too bad but I like to stick around 700-800MB for these old school movies.  Good up regardless
[T],solstars,2011-05-15T06:42Z,"I have ""Brazil"".  Coming soon."
,lupeenn,2011-06-25T13:32Z,"nice quality.. tnx for the up.
