Alex welcomes back to the show physician and Republican Congressman for the 14th congressional district of Texas, Ron Paul. On June 30, Paul's advocacy group Campaign for Liberty announced that the FEC has launched a pair of investigations on the organization. "Iâ€™m writing to let you know that our success has its price, and that price right now is the wrath of the Obama Administration and its attack dogs at the Federal Election Commission," Campaign for Liberty said in press release. "Theyâ€™ve already come after us in multiple cases, alleging that Campaign for Liberty has acted illegally merely by putting the candidates on the record and reporting their positions." Dr. Paul has numerous published articles and books, including End The Fed (2009), and The Revolution: A Manifesto (2008). Check out For Liberty: How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty, a DVD available at the Infowars Store.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
