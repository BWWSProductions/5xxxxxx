*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****

DON'T THANK ME...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)"
,dardar6t9,2010-07-01T04:51Z,Can someone comment on A/V instead of the sermons? We know the world is full of ppl.....too full. Re:The Matrix. We are a virus not a co-inhabitant of the world. What we need is a catastrophe of biblical proportions to wipe out 98% of mankind.....then the balance can restore itself. Have a nice day :)
,Swanee1,2010-07-01T05:16Z,"Probably no one has finished downloading it yet, so how can they comment. Why dont you download it and place your comment instead of complaining. And dardar6t9, appreciate the uploader re the sermons. As he is doing us a favour, he is entitled to push any barrow he wishes. BTW, thanks Raymondhome."
