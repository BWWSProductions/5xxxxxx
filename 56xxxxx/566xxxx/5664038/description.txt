1 year before they became fictional cops in the 
TV series IRONSIDE, 
Barbara Anderson (in one of 
her first acting roles on TV) and Don Galloway 
played lovers in this Virginian episode.

Her father is played by veteran actor Dan Duryea 
and her brother by Michael Burns.

One of the outlaws in Galloway's gang is 
Bing Russell (Kurt's father).

And if that isn't enough, Ed Peck appears 
as the Sheriff.

This is an OK episode, but it could have been a 
lot better. All hit TV series eventually have one 
of the main characters temporarily going blind or 
getting amnesia. 

So Trampas loses his memory after a run-in with 
outlaws, but the plot doesn't really go anywhere.
