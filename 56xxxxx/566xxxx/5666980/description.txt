This is a MAK (Multi Activation Key) for Windows 7; and it'll work on your Windwos 7 Enterprise and Professional editions. 

AT the moment, it's got just more than 13800 activations left on it. SO if you think you need it, you should use it as soon as you can. The rate at which the number of activations available is going down, the key will last about three weeks. 

I'd recommend using it on a clean install instead of applying it on Windows on whcih you have tried any cracks etc.
