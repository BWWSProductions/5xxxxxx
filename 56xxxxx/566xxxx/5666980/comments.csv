,EnterX,2010-07-30T03:40Z,10 million thanx from me for this...yeah...right need too more Mak key for office 2010...
,jtnthckr24,2010-07-31T19:59Z,When you say the key will last about 3 weeks... do u mean i will have to use a new key... or that is how fast all the activation opportunities will go? I need more clarification because i needed a key for a permanent install for a friend of mine.
,brianbearco,2010-08-08T01:03Z,How many activations is left on this key?  Baz2017 can u update? thanks!
,brianbearco,2010-08-15T18:37Z,"This key is no longer working, no more activations left.. so dont even bother with it, it wont work."
,onlyeuro,2010-09-20T14:03Z,"Key not working
activations count limit reached... hence its useless..."
,LikUranus,2011-10-08T08:49Z,I don't see a reason to leave this up if it's not working.
