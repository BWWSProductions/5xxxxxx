,jon4fun,2010-07-01T16:34Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

I have high hopes for this show. I saw episode 1 and MF is a born narrator. 

I will rephrase the statement asked by 'seenoeveil47' into a polite question and hope this show will catch on.

Would you be able to encode/upload the first 3 episodes of this series please?

I would advise ALL, even those not interested in cosmology or physics to give this a look and get their children to watch. It is fascinating.

Please seed.

Thanks.
Jon"
,seenoevil47,2010-07-01T17:10Z,Lolz..!! @ 'jon4fun' i never meant to be rude in any kind..!! So Sorry tho if it seemed so...!! :)
[V],twentyforty,2010-07-01T17:33Z,"@Jon: I rendered seenoevil's question as ""would you""  even if ""can you not"" sounded little too ""mysterious"", I agree.

In short, I would encode first three episodes (in encoding right now and I'll up the torrent after Karate Kid (at approx. 20:00 CET).

Addendum @ ALL:

But people - please do seed back. New month has started and there is no excuses for 80% of Hit&Runs at ep.4 alone. It's 111 MB for sake-of-god... I would delete such torrents, be sure about."
