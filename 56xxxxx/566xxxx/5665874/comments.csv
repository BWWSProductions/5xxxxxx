,florinus,2010-12-25T17:58Z,"looks interesting. but look what they write on their order page (bottom):

""Disclaimer: GameCopyWizard is a set of guides and tutorials which show you how to copy video games. We are not selling a software, however we do show you where you can download different software which can be used to copy your video games for free. Our product is very useful and it has guides that show you exactly how to copy video games for all consoles.""

so, it's not a software. "
,goofy173,2011-01-25T22:53Z,"ya, it's worthless. "
,goofy173,2011-01-25T22:58Z,"I read this guide. Total crap, likely put out by the seller. Talks about using the software. THERE IS NO SOFTWARE, just guides on how to do it. 

Furthermore, there is no way to copy XBOX360, PS3, and Wii games without chipping the consoles."
,Marquis_of_Carabas,2011-05-31T00:51Z,"You would be wise to read the following.

Game Copy Wizard is only links and tutorials.  Game Copy Wizard has no program or software and there is nothing to download to copy games. 

So you pay the $29.99 for the Game Copy Wizard download from their site:

http://www.gamecopywizard.com/?hop=product1

You may think you are paying for a download for a program to copy games.   That program for copying games doesn't exist!!! 

When you click on copy games at their members access only area, they tell you that you now have to click on 3 external links to download three other programs:

 RawDump2.0
.Net Framework 
Winrar

Next you follow 4 pages of instructions on how to use those programs to copy games.  At the end of the four pages of instructions it tells you that you need to have a LG DVD drive to copy games.  All of this would be very helpful at their website.  Do not be fooled.

There is absolutely NO Game Copy Wizard SOFTWARE and there is NO PROGRAM to download to copy games.  Game Copy Wizard is selling you LINKS and TUTORIALS.  That is all you will get for your $29.99.   "
