,crossfire6,2010-07-04T00:58Z,"odain, tell me have you actually used this program?  So far as I can tell this makes the 7th or 8th Nero 10 torrent where all have claimed to be working, but none of them do.  Is there anyone out there who has actually used this program successfully?  I don't mean install, I mean USE.  Sure, they all seem to install, but none of them work after that.  Same old shit about the serial# being busted via online check.  There are never any instructions with this, just the same old shit about installing with the provided serial#, which is always the same no mater which torrent you download.  I have come to the conclusion that this is FAKE.  All of them.  Unless somebody out there has an answer on how to make it work?  Remember, just because you install it, doesn't mean it works.  Screw this shit, I'll wait for one of the known and reliable uploaders."

,PROTEOUS271158,2010-07-29T19:09Z,Why won't the Disc Copy Gadget stay in the Vista Sidebar on reboot ?  Anyone else have this annoying problem?
,cinesimon,2010-07-31T05:52Z,"Has anyone else found that after installing this, the  dvd drive(writer etc) has been disabled and is no longer recognized by the entire system?"
,Cadeyrn,2011-05-12T18:26Z,"People, the way you get it to work is to not allow Nero to access the internet. Before install, shut off internet and disable nero in any firewall you may have. Ta-Da.. Working Nero 10 Suite. :) 

Hope this helps all of you!"
