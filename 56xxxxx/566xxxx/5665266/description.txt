Recorded in the middle of Etran Finatawaâ€™s 2009 European tour, Tarkat Tajje/Letâ€™s Go! reveals an incredible new groove, mature voices and sophisticated lyrics. They have created a unique sound with which to voice their ideas and concerns regarding their endangered traditional way of life. Their last album, Desert Crossroads, was an exploration of the realities of being a nomad in a changing society. This new album reaches a whole new philosophical level, as the band begins to explore their role as human beings, and cultural ambassadors, in a society of continuous global change.

This album is more than a statement. It is Etran Finatawaâ€™s appeal to a global consciousness and to the decision makers and reactors all over the world. As Alhousseini says in the song â€˜Imuzaranâ€™:

"Those who are leading the world
pay attention to the tears of the children of this world
that you are spending every morning
and the tears of the women and the men."

Through their unique brand of desert blues, Etran Finatawa has enchanted audiences the world over, touring extensively throughout Europe, North America, Africa and the Pacific.
