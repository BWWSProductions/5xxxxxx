Your point is? Kind of sad to see a member that is into documentaries himself making such a comment, specially after seeing that you have been here a couple of years.Yes it has been uploaded before but keep in mind that we all have different sources and not all users out there had the opportunity to download it back then.

If you compare my uploads and see what they have inside,you would of known that most of them are with subtitles which i personally took the time to translate,timestamp and sync. Thoose are not made over a night!! I never had any problems or complains from anyone before, so go figure if i was suprised to read your comment.

Don't know if your purpose was to bring my attention or from other users so they can look at your uploads, but you sure have mine now.
I would never dream of deleting your comment.I leave it there so all can see how redicolous you are.

After all it's free and if you don't like my uploads then try other uploaders.

It's your choice!!
