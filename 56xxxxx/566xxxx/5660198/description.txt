                              ====================






What have past acts of destruction taught us about what will happen to mankind after the apocalypse? Is it inevitable that disaster will someday strike America on an unprecedented level? How has history prepared us?

                            <<<<<-------------->>>>>


History's most dramatic events â€” Hiroshima, 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and others â€” are examined and analyzed with hard data gathered from their massive aftereffects.


                            <<<<<-------------->>>>>


The disappearance of water and food supplies, the effects of deteriorated sanitation and health care on the remaining population, and the increased use of violence as a means of survival â€” all illustrate how societies have responded and survived in AFTER ARMAGEDDON.
