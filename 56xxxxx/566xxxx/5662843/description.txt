 Filmmaker David Vahey chronicles the controversy surrounding mixed martial artist 
 Matt Lindland, whose promising career in the Ultimate Fighting Championship was cut 
 short when he was dismissed for wearing the wrong clothing at a pre-match event. 
 Did the UFC have a legitimate beef? Or was UFC chief Dana White determined to 
 protect UFC's golden-boy athletes by railroading the up-and-coming Lindland? 
 Along with his supporters, Lindland weighs in.

 Cast:

 Matt Lindland, Dan Henderson, Randy Couture, Chael Sonnen, Ivan Salaverry,
