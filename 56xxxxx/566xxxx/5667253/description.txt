NOTE: Glad to see ya back around KB. Cant wait for ya to get back in action. :D Continuing the legacy of great quality, KiNGDOM releases... ;) I used a smoother filter to get rid of some of the artifacts and pixalation. I tried to tone down the glare, but there was alot and I didnt want to make other parts to dark. I used imagines encoded intro that they got from th DI release and ELEKTRI4KA video for the rest. OFC IMAGiNE synced it so I just had to cut the intro from there release and extract the audio and mux it to mine. I then joined the Intro back. TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. ;)
