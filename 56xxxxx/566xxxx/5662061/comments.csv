,ScoreGods,2011-07-13T19:47Z,"that is  how a upload should be! 

clean album in best quality ~ untouched


very fine

thx"
,ScoreGods,2011-07-17T18:15Z,"THIS IS A QUALITY UPLOAD

One of the very best movie score albums composed of all time - one of Hans Zimmers best

@ tonmild   thank you :)

the more you leave it untouched the more I like it



---
Uploading albums of master composers like Hans Zimmer  only makes sense if UNTOUCHED

Uploads are welcome in full albums

1. Wave
2. Flac


MASTER COMPOSER = Top notch quality in composing, recording and ""mastering"" 
The chance you make mistakes with YOUR audio file is rather high unless you are an audio engineer or other pro with a lot of sound studio experience.  

Do NOT touch the audio files else the upload gets a negative quality rating. 


Enough said"

Man, I do not know and you type stupidity!!

If you do not like it fuck the shop and buy the original it."
