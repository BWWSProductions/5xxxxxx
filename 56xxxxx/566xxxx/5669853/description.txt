Here is the official soundtrack for Bioware's epic RPG Dragon Age: Origins, released on Amazon and iTunes 07 December 2009.

Please note that there are 6 songs not included here that were featured in the Collector's Edition of the game, more or less a sampling of the music featured in-game, namely "Rise of the Darkspawn", "Tavern Brawl", "The Grey Warden Legacy", "The Realm of Orzamar", "The Nature of the Beast", and "I Am The One (DJKilla Remix)".  If you want them, you can find them on the CE soundtrack torrents available.
