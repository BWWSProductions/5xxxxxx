,macpirate2008,2010-07-02T00:31Z,Dude.
,pedroconejo,2010-07-07T23:53Z,"Yup, Serial Box 07-2010 is corrupted"
,pedroconejo,2010-07-08T00:05Z,"Yup, Serial Box 07-2010 is corrupt - does not instal into iSerial Reader. Will work with Serial Seeker though."
,pedroconejo,2010-07-08T00:15Z,"CORRECTION: Serial Box 07-2010 works, but only with the newest release of iSerial Reader 2.0.8, included in this torrent."
