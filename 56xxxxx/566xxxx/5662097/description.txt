        Compilation featuring some of Richard Felix's most favourite 
        haunts, including Borley Rectory, Treasures House in York, 
        Berkley Castle and a derelict farmhouse on the the Isle of 
        Man.

        Cropped to widest frame, source is 4:3, widest frame filled 
        that a few times, sadly the majority of scenes are close to 
        16:9 and some stills have messed up AR's.
        But for those who like Richard Felix, Enjoy!
