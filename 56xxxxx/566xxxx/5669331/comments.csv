,runil,2010-07-11T04:52Z,"7.9gig .iso file...anyone know how to utilize this?  Tried mounting iso image, no joy.  Recommendations?"
,AskMeHowYouToCanSayFU,2010-07-29T08:00Z,"I too am having problems getting anything to play the file, its like the iso is empty, just 8Gb of allotted space.

@NLUPPER can you tell us what  software or system you've played this on?

Thanks for the upload; this was not an easy find,  i guess not many liked it as much as the first one."
,rogertw,2010-10-03T17:29Z,"iso file won't open in magic iso, but can be accessed through daemon tools (lite).
MPC does not play video however, will try on XBMC and see if any joy.
Anyone else manage to get success - all the other comments are suggesting the file is a dud!"
,kkh1953,2010-11-25T23:58Z,Can anyone confirm whether this is a dud or ok? Much appreciated.
,omniwig,2012-05-09T05:22Z,i can confirm you can get the m2ts files out of the ISO file if you mount the MDS file in daemon tools (lite). haven't tried playing the m2ts files yet.
,omniwig,2012-05-09T07:09Z,i can confirm the m2ts files work as well.
