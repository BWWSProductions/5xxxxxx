It's taken me around a year to get around uploading this, but here it is. This is version v1.1 of the English patch that contains bug fixes, typos and among other things. The old torrent shall remain if for some reason you have trouble with this one.

This torrent contains the original Japanese Mother 3 ROM and the English patcher, if you need to know how to patch this just read the readme.txt in the English patcher folder it's very easy and it has other patchers in it if you don't use windows.

I again recommend using VBA-M as your GBA emulator, please be sure to comment and seed this torrent!
