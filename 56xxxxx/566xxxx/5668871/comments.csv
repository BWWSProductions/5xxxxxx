[T],Jesper.sv,2010-07-04T16:09Z,"trolkan; Think you need to learn what is a scene release and what's not.
Well it's nice to see how many torrents you have provided to the site, thank you!"
[T],Jesper.sv,2010-07-04T18:14Z,"trolkan; oh shut up! For starters, there are no nfo files for the other release, they are not in rar-archives etc etc etc. So they CAN'T be scene releases."
[T],Jesper.sv,2010-07-04T18:41Z,"trolkan; Some ppl DO want original scene releases. If they want they download or else they shut up, all of them but you.  "
