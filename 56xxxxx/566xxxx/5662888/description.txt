Pilot :
In London, A.K. is a Ukrainian Gypsy, seeking fame as a rocker, doing odd jobs: he`s a dom, drives a hack, and runs errands for his neighbor, a poet full of self pity since going blind. A.K`s flatmates are Holly, a ballerina who becomes a reluctant stripper in need of coaching, and Juliette, a pill-popping assistant at a pharmacy run by an Indian tired of his marriage. Juliette, estranged from her family, dreams of helping the poor children of Africa; A.K. has a crush on Holly; Juliette`s boss lusts after her. Her hapless sister calls from time to time. The poet despairs. Is there a route from filth to wisdom for these souls? Can they find fun and fulfillment? A.K. provides philosophical comment.
