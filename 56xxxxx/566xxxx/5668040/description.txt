Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



Rather than dramatize Castro's Cuban revolution as a central theme, this film made by Cubans in exile focuses on the disintegration of a young peasant's morality once he joins the revolutionary forces. The naive peasant was expecting adventure but before his stint in the military has ended, he is a trained killer, whether he is fully aware of it or not. When he takes up with a dance-hall woman in Havana and turns to drugs and alcohol, his decline accelerates, putting both his lover and his friends at the mercy of his slipping hold on stability.
