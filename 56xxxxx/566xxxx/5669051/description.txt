Proteus 7.6sp4
========================================
1. Install Proteus 7.6 SP4 
2. Patch in PV2, i got my av screaming bouga bouga, so i would advise you to disable your av.
3. Due to error in patched files you also need the Fix.exe // I am not entirely sure about that.
4. To fix error with PWM replace pic16.dll // well i am not entirely sure about that either.
5  Remeber to run License manager and browse for the license file and install keys.

========================================
Proteus 7.4sp3
========================================

Just apply the crach after install.

========================================
========================================
This is how i did it:
I couldnt run proteus 7.6 on first try, as explained before, so i installed 7.4 and then updated to 7.6.
Also i didn't apply the fix, but you are free to try install, remove and repeat.
7.4 is added for convenience.
========================================
Proteus guys have sure outdid themselves with this master piece.
Please support them in the best way you know how.
