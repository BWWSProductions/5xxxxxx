IMAGiNE NOTES
Sources used .....The russian cam video,orcs video and orcs audio ....many thanks to all :)
Right the quality.....the russian cam was nice but had major colouring issues ....looked a dirty yellowand was dark.
Orcs cam would have been pretty decent if not for that flicker ....however their audio was mint, so top stuff.
Work done....well firstly the russian cam is missing the ending so we used the last 20 secs off orcs video .....but for this we need to cut the ending and resize the video and change the framerate to match the russian video.
The russian video we needed to do some major white balancing to even get it close to some natural colours.....still off in parts.
Also used a smoother, sharpen, rgb eq, contrast and brightness filters....
Got to say the black is slightly off due to us making it a touch brighter as some scenes were harder to see so .....win some lose some.
The audio now this we just need to sync to our encode.....pretty simple for once, but got to say the line is sweet, thanks to orc :)
