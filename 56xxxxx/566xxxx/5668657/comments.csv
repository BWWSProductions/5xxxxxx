Nor do their tactics surprise me when I consider how Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is only to be expected that his agents shall have the appearance of ministers of righteousness, but they will get what they deserve in the end. 2 Cor 11:13-15"

Jehovah's Witness seem to be situated in the branch of radical back to the root theology right next to the mormons/lds but without polygamy and bloodvengence (sort of). I'm much in favour of their rejection of the invented Trinity (a doctrine not found in the Bible) and their ""no celebration stance"" of pagan rituals such as birthday parties. Their Watchtower publications are very neat and inspirational. Thumbs up for this torrent"

The normal churches had their priests blessing the weapons and the Catholic Church even organised the escape of the SS to South America after the war.

So, the Jehova´s Witnesses are not worse than other religions, folks lets be resonable."
