This episode covers two very different and unrelated topics. In the first half of the episode, we talk about the Dead Sea Scrolls. What are they, and how are they important to Christianity? How do they support and give evidence to the message of the Gospel? In the second half, we talk about one of the controversies among Christians today: Trinity vs. Oneness. Is God triune, or singular?
