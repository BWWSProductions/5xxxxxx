Spyware Doctor provides three-way spyware protection for your PC through real-time threat blocking, advanced system scanning and immunization against
known browser infections. Spyware Doctor is a multi-award winning spyware removal utility that detects, removes and protects your PC from thousands of potential
spyware, adware, Trojans, keyloggers, spybots and tracking threats. Protect your privacy and computing habits from prying eyes and virtual trespassers with the
help of Spyware Doctor.

Anti-virus software and firewalls do not fully protect your system against the majority of spyware and privacy threats. Because spyware is commonly bundled with
software downloads, attached to e-mails, or transmitted through networks it can appear to be legitimate software, but once installed it can be nearly impossible
to detect and remove without the help of a dedicated spyware removal tool like Spyware Doctor.

Spyware Doctor is advanced technology designed especially for people, not just experts. That is one reason why it won the People's Choice Award in 2005, 2006 and 2007.
It is automatically configured out of the box to give you optimal protection with limited interaction so all you need to do is install it for immediate and ongoing protection.

Spyware Doctor's advanced OnGuard technology only alerts users on a true Spyware detection. This is significant because you should not be interrupted by
cryptic questions every time you install software, add a site to your favorites or change your PC settings. Such messages can be confusing and lead to
undesirable outcomes such as inoperable programs, lost favorites or even Spyware being allowed to install on the system. We've done the research so you don't have to.
