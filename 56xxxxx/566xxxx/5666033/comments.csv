The Movies are: Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "

Thanks neonrainbow."
,osriccc,2011-03-14T04:24Z,"Ok... This would have been a perfect rip, really. Nice resolution, great size, but I strongly recommend going for the 4.1 or 3.99 Gb files here in TPB. Why? If you're like me this movie will get ruined around 2:3X hours (when Gyllenhaal escapes from the house under the rain and goes to the police until he talks to the prisoner woman) the image gets really, really choppy. It lasts around 5 minutes or so, but as I said ""if you're like me"" this will ruin the film for you (at least will make you erase it like I did). I kindly ask for uploader to check this stuff before uploading. I tried the movie in two different PCs and I have the same problem, really, frames get a little screwed while sounds continue fine, it looks like a modern videogame running into an old PC for those minutes. I warned you, if you don't care about this issue, this is your rip."
