,MrSorter,2010-07-05T13:20Z,What the difference in this version?
,mb7529,2010-07-05T15:17Z,"she comes down the stairs with her arms and legs inverted and then walks on the wall and ceiling, if I remember right"
,Unit431,2010-07-30T04:18Z,"The changes are as follows:

? A new pre-credits sequence, beginning with a shot of the Georgetown house where the film unfolds.
? Regan undergoes more medical tests and begins to show signs of possession. An important sequence to restore since the film later refers to ""what the doctor said."" The previous cut didn't support that dialogue.
? A shot of Regan mingling with guests at her mother's party has been removed.
? Images of the infamous statue and Satan have been subliminally added to the background of the ""lights out scene"" and over Regan's face in various points in the film. These additions pass by quickly, so close attention is needed.
? The ""spider walk,"" in which Regan descends down the stairs with a bloody mouth.
? Father Karras examines a tape of Regan talking to her father.
? Sharon's attempt to ignore the calls of the possessed Regan.
? Father Merrin asks Chris what Regan's middle name is before entering the room.
? Merrin and Karras have a discussion on the staircase during a break in the exorcism.
? Father Dyer gives the medal back to Chris rather than keeping it.
? Lt. Kinderman asks Fr. Dyer if he wants to see a movie and a friendship is shown in the beginning stages.
? Various sound effects and music cues have been added to the soundtrack."
