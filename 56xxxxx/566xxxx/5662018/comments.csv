,maxmixmul,2011-03-15T11:07Z,"puppy, you got it wrong. Amazon is not any kind of magic encyclopedia of the truth.
http://www.stonesthrow.com/store/album/aloeblacc/aloe-blacc-good-things is the place to look for official release :-)
Great voice!"
,maxmixmul,2011-03-15T11:14Z,"hehe . I got it wrong too. Someone has messed w the track numbers and titles. Seems to be the right songs though.
http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2010/07/aloe-blacc-good-things lists the tracks:
01. I Need A Dollar  
02. Green Lights   
03. Hey Brother  
04. Miss Fortune    
05. Life So Hard   
06. Take Me Back   
07. Femme Fatale 
08. Loving You Is Killing Me      
09. Good Things   
10. You Make Me Smile     
11. If I      
12. Mama Hold My Hand     
13. Politician (Reprise)     

Those should be official and correct names... never had the CD in my hand though :-)"
