Max Graham featuring Ana Criado - Nothing Else Matters

************************************************************************


It's all about the music,  all about  the  magical contrast to  silence. 
With the brightest of colours,  Max  Graham  painted the skies of sound, 
filling it with the darkest  of  tech-house and lightest of prog-trance. 
He's blended  shades  of all colours,  from the 80's remake  'Owner of a 
Lonely Heart' to the stunning vocal trance track 'Sun In The Winter'.

As the third single of his debutalbum 'Radio', he brings out the warmest
of colours with 'Nothing Else Matters'.  From  the  profound bass-guitar 
to the melodic maze, once you've pressed play on this one,  nothing else 
matters.  Ana Criado,  who's  worked with the  likes of Ronski Speed and 
Alex M.O.R.P.H.,  provides the essential  final touch  to  'Nothing Else 
Matters' with a quieting pair of vocals. Two artists at work, tincturing 
the dance scene.

Egyptian duo Aly & Fila,  masters of the euphoric trance genre,  remixed 
'Nothing  Else  Matters'  to  an  enchanting  uplifting  track  for  the 
peak-time moments of life.
