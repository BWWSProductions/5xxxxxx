PrisM Notes:
For an r5 it was pretty nice quality, little noise, colours slightly off but seemed pretty good...shame no line out :(
anyway this is cam audio! Tweaked the colors just slightly. Light video denoise, didn't add any sharpness because i tried to keep the size pretty small as short runtime. Anyway Enjoy!
