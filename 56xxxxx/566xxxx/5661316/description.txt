Two show-business women leave Los Angeles for Las Vegas, but phoney state troopers abduct them in the desert and they are taken to a laboratory / prison. Here, males come to experience sexual fantasies, which it is the job of the two girls and other pulchritudinous captives to flesh out. The captors force an hypnotic drug upon them to aid their performances. Then a country hitchhiker they met earlier at a gas station decides to rescue the girls.
