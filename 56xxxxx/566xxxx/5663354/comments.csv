It was clearly sized down for our benifit, so that we could actually DL it in an hour rather than a few days.

Ass."

I hope this one is better... Thanks.

,creste,2010-07-02T23:28Z,These new Futurama episode are so boring. Seems like hardly any thought or creativity went into the writing. Sad to see a once clever vehicle such as this show resorting to such toilet humor.
,Superman169,2010-07-03T04:04Z,"Thank you very much for the up and to all the people who seed what they take thank you as well, whiners and know it alls can go shit in there hands while the rest say thanks and enjoy the show cheers!!!!!"
,chshc,2010-07-03T09:49Z,"LOL!!!!
If you ever figure out how to fit 20 minutes of 1080p video into a file 200mb or smaller you would be a piratebay god!  Id even send you one of my, then extra, hard drives!"
,SunPol,2010-07-03T15:05Z,"Warning to iPhone 4 owners: don't watch this episode, or else you will realize how dumb you actually are..."

,panzersiddhartha,2010-07-09T00:44Z,"Retards - Stop downloading OR stop complaining here.nEither way - Shut the fuck up. I like the episodes and they are just getting the season started, I expect it to become better and better. Just cos\' it isn\'t banana skid whoops doesn\'t make it un-funny, it just makes you look like mongoloids when you don\'t get the funny parts. Go look at Laurel and Hardy or something, stay away from TPB, please.nnThanks eztv."
