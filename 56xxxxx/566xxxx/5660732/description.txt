The biggest animated film franchise of all time gives you one last chance to go green in this game based on the fourth and final Shrek movie. Just like the movie, Shrek: Forever After the game is meant to be enjoyed with family and friends. Each of your favorite characters is ready to help to outwit and out-muscle your enemy Rumpelstiltskin. Play through the adventure as Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and Puss In Boots. Use each character's special abilities to defeat foes and complete challenges as you switch between Shrek's normal world and an alternate reality. Up to three other players can join at any time with drop-in, drop-out co-op play.
