         Since this show got cancelled twice and shows no signs of     
         ever coming back or getting released on DVD, we thought we    
         would release it for those who want to watch it but can't     
         use the streaming websites due to living outside the US.      
         Yes, 44.1kHz audio is correct and not downsampled.
