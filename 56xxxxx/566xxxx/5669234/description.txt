Release Notes:

where to start :hmmm: well....theirs a few versions out now, so take this or leave it. firstly, i filtered the R6
Video adding a denoise filter, a deblock filter to try and get the blocks down a bit quite alot in source..then i added
a smoothness filter onto it, trying to keep video looking pretty normal instead of a painting , then was onto the
brightness and contrast, highered the brightness a touch, and slightly changing the contrast to bring some color back
into it...then tweaked the saturation

Plot: Work causes a single mother to move to China with her young son; in his new home, the boy embraces kung fu, taught to him by a master
