Vocalist Bernard Fowler has been much in demand as a session vocalist since the early 1980s, working with artists as diverse as Bill Laswell, Herbie Hancock, Sly & Robbie, and the Rolling Stones. FRIENDS WITH PRIVILEGES (2007) is Fowler's first solo album, and reflects the eclectic, genre-blending aesthetic evident in his resume. Mixing funk, rock, pop, and soul, Fowler turns in a wild ride of an album highlighted by inventively re-imagined cover tunes (including Neil Young's "Cinnamon Girl" and the Stones' "Wild Horses") and groove-driven originals. The disc comes recommended to followers of Fowler, and to those who appreciate original, soulful music that doesn't adhere to categories.
