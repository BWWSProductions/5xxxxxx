This is a live reading by Charles Bukowski from The Viking Inn, 1979, in Vancouver, Canada. It's a great recording of Bukowski reading some of his best poems to a raucous crowd, with plenty of banter and Bukowski getting drunker and more violent towards the audience as the recording progresses.
I  ripped it from a CD I found at the local record store. I had to up the original volume, and find out the names of a few of the poems. Track 6 ("You Got Drunk") is the only one with a possibly incorrect name. 
Also, I couldn't find the correct artwork anywhere online, so I used the DVD cover of the film made for the performance.

Enjoy this amazing poet, and please re-seed!
