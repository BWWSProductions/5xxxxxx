,TorrentG0110,2010-07-02T08:22Z,"Hey, thanks for this..Shame CBGBs has closed. I'm a NYer and it was a great place to catch all sorts of rock/metal/punk bands. My friend's band actually played his cd release party there.

As far as the torrent itself goes, I don't see any seeder (you) but peoples' percentages are lsowly increasing. That's a good thing!

Thanks again."
