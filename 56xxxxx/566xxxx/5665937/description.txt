Supercarrier: USS Ronald Reagan

Zip up your military flight suit, strap on your protective headgear and get ready to experience the rush of an F/A-18 being launched off the world's most advanced nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in Supercarrier: USS Ronald Reagan. A ship nearly as long as the Empire State building is tall, yet able to speed through the water at more than 30 knots, or 35 miles per hour, this floating American territory is one of the most complex machines on earth.
