Commodore Disk User was a magazine for the Commodore range of computers, including the Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and Commodore Plus/4. Each issue came with a cover mounted disk containing software.

It was published by the same company that published the Your Commodore magazine and was aimed at Commodore users that had a 1541 disk drive and did not want to have to type in program listings. It also meant that larger programs could be included with the magazine. Initially, an issue of the magazine was published every two months but after two years, it was changed to being published every month.

The magazine survived up until the end of 1991; the last issue cover dated October 1991.
