,adheepism,2010-06-20T05:30Z,"Actually the tamil version of this movies is better with Vickram doing Abishek's role...

Vickram outdid the performance of Abi and even Ash herself had said that she loves Vikram's acting rather than Abi's
All Hail to Vickram, AWESOME!!!"

Cam print"
,Alvord12,2010-06-20T14:11Z,"Well for one thing, the movie's simply meh. Ash's just eye candy, she can't act even if he life depended on it! ;)
That out of the way, this one's an OK quality print. Audio's a bit low in the beginning, but becomes better after 20 or so minutes.

A - 6
V - 7"
