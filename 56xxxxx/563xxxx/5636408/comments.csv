Are you drugged or doped son? From where the hell did you get the notion this rip is 2 hrs 6mins.
Perhaps you should sleep now. And check it back once again it is actually 2hrs 37mins. It even has end credits intact.
@vijayanca
I dont know if you are burning this into a DVD. But if you are
Use convertX.

Thank you for sharing..

Hi friends,
mkv is good for quality and lower file size.
you can use Converxtodvd software to burn it to DVD. (thats wat i do.)

Or
Using ""Convertxtodvd"" burn it to an ISO file
Virtual mount the iso using ""PowerISO""
Rip it to AVI using ""MagicDVDripper"""
