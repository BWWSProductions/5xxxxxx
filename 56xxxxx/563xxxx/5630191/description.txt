Music : Electro / Techno : MP3/Variable
Phil Western (near) complete discography
quality ranges from high variable lame to 320kbps

This includes the hard to find stuff not included in my old Phil Western torrent such as Acid Jam with D.R.G., Therapy 10", and Off and Gone's ep.
I omitted all the Download releases because those torrents are floating around somewhere. There is one Behatch album here and the other one can be found in my Mark Spybey torrent. If you like the music please support the artists if you feel like it
