,yesbos,2010-06-17T19:11Z,"@UltimateChinna
there is a ""Database error."" when adding URL's. It happens in Pb nowadays most of time. May be server problem. 
I tried to add image links, but can't. May be xRG face the same prob at time of upload.
So wait for some hours, xRG or someone will post screens.
Tx xRG."

,yesbos,2010-06-21T14:39Z,"xRG, 
I have a request, can u do the xvid version too. U know that dvd player support case. I knw that h264 is coolest in quality, but my friesnds ask me to download xvid only.
When it comes to blueray it should be h264 to have HD quality, so no worry about BRrips or HDrips or upscales ( bcos my friends never asked for those rips to be in xvid) 
Tx"
