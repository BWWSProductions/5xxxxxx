Collection of the Main Man's solo series, one-shots, mini's and appearances.

Lobo first appeared in Omega Men #3 (June 1983), and was created by Roger Slifer and Keith Giffen.  His name is Khundian for "he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it."  Lobo is the last Czarnian and works as an interstellar mercenary  and bounty hunter.  He will take up any contract if the money's right. Whether it be his fourth grade teacher, Santa Claus, or God himself, Lobo will get the job done. 

Although introduced as a hardened, rarely-used noir villain in the 1980s, he languished in limbo until his revival as an anti-hero biker in the early 1990s.  The character enjoyed a short run as one of DCâ€™s most popular characters throughout the 1990s.  This version of Lobo was intended to be an over-the-top parody of Marvel Comics superhero Wolverine.  

Also included are the appearances of Li'L Lobo.  In the year 2000, a magical accident transforms Lobo into a teenager. In this state, he joins Young Justice.

Due to scenes of nudity, extreme violence and gore this torrent comes with an ADULT rating.
