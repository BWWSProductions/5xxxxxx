,takeaimnfire82,2010-07-30T10:34Z,"Hey dude, I'm testing a couple of your movies right now, and I just wanted to say.  If these are the qualities you're claiming.  Yet the sizes they are.  You are definitely the man, and I'm not sure why you don't have thousands of seeders.  Awesome for saving some room on my cluster fucked hdds!  thanks."
,xaq55,2010-08-24T15:13Z,"The quality on this movie is fantastic, but the hard-coded English subs are not always correct, and that gets a little irritating"

,staticghost,2011-03-20T03:31Z,"Sorry man, but the quality of this rip is shit. Its like an upscaled version of half of the actual resolution. Plus the subtitle has too many errors. No wonder the actual resolution of the file ripped is not listed. Not worth the download."
