I was born 39yrs ago in Derry and the largest issues that affected the vast majority of the people of Derry for 38yrs was what happened on Jan 30th 1972.

Bloody Sunday is the Real and Final report. It is sad that it took so long,for 
the families of the deceased and the 14 living victims to be told Sorry but it was our soldiers that did it. Your Loved one was 
not a nail bomber(terrorist in today speak) and NO your Loved ones were not shooting at us. Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford decided 
he would ignore orders and "(6 Jun 2010) ... Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford said at the Bloody Sunday Inquiry that he ......
..... decision was taken to carry out an arrest operation against rioters, .... unleashed on the citizens of Derry in order to teach them a lesson" 

I cannot understand why all our television and radio news broadcast the lies so freely around the world and branded the the Murderers as Heroes.
 The truth will out!.....the Truth is out!
A Lie causes a Lie causes a Lie.......and on and on.......TRUTH! Stops it. 

I Hope the Families now get Peace and the victims can rest in peace with us now knowing that they are The Innocent.

...Enjoy today it will soon be a memory....Telboy 2010.
