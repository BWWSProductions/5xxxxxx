Bartok, the lovable albino bat from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman's 'Anastasia', returns in 'Bartok The Magnificent', his own animated musical adventure. Propelled on a hero's journey, Bartok (Hank Azaria) must rescue the young heir to the Russian throne, Prince Ivan (Phillip Van Dyke). However, he must first deal with the shady Ludmilla (Catherine O'Hara), who wants the throne for herself, and face a series of tasks and adventures set for him by the wacky - and possibly evil - witch of the Iron Forest, Baba Yaga (Andrea Martin). Bartok's odyssey is marked by imaginative scenery, catchy songs, comedic characters (including sidekick Zozi the bear, as voiced by Kelsey Grammer), and, most of all, the bat's own funny and neurotic commentary!
