,ryanphatryan,2010-06-17T04:05Z,so this is the real unrated version?
,TheSpenner,2010-06-17T07:21Z,"Yes it's real. 100 min = unrated version. 99 min = theatrical.

The quality looks great (I watched about 1/2 hour so far), except that during the couple minutes of the actual hot tub scene there's video breakup. Anyone else play it yet and have an issue on that scene? I don't think it's due to my PC because it breaks up in the same place played on my PC (VLC), and also from my Tivo."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-17T22:22Z,i didn't notice any problems.
