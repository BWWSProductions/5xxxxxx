I've tried repairing the avi indexes with VLC and another program, to no avail. Thanks for wasting my time  and bandwidth. do not bother with this one in my opinion..."

"
,quinnjin,2011-07-05T15:50Z,"UNless I just messed up some how, or it got corrupted during the process... How come I've got two files, both the same size, when it says their are only one? I take it ut! means u torrent, and is probably the temporary suffix of a file before it is completed?
Anybody else tried this torrent?"
,quinnjin,2011-07-05T15:59Z,"it may be that it just got messed up some how on the way down... I'm going to try again... I'd delete the above comments, but you can't do that on this site I think
... will report back and see if I have any luck..."
,quinnjin,2011-07-06T07:48Z,"nup, same bullshit again, file says 700 MB when in fact its more like 1.4 gig, two avi's, one with avi.ut! added to the suffix. Get rid of this frikn shit torrent."
,quinnjin,2011-07-06T14:24Z,"okay I'm officially stumped... the whole thing finally came down.... there are two files, one of them plays, one doesn't, however, with the second downloaded entirely... (not partially which is why the .ut! suffix) the first file plays fine. Please excuse and delete if poss the above posts...very confusing though as the torrent says 705 mb, when in fact the whole folder is more like a gig and a half... anyway, it plays... perfectly, but I've never seen that kind of arrangement in an avi file before... its like half the information is on the first file and half on the other but you can only play the first one... I guess they are interlaced or something... anyway.. very weird, but it works... so thanks and please excuse above comments..."
