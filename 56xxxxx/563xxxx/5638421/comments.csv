,cndkp,2010-06-19T21:19Z,Thank you very much !!
,Green_Banana,2010-06-19T21:23Z,"""Quick""?  Nobody's uploading.  If you're referring to when the torrent got posted, the show just ended a short while ago, so it's right on schedule.  "
,valeyard1,2010-06-19T21:50Z,"There's another torrent uploading at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5638458/Doctor_Who_S05E12_The_Pandorica_Opens

I've been attempting to download this one since it was first published.  I only have .8% done after a half hour.  On the other one I've dowloaded 20% in maybe 5 minutes."

,rrmerlin51D,2010-06-20T01:29Z,This is Flashforward.  Not Who.
,rrmerlin51D,2010-06-20T01:34Z,Try uploading Who.   This is Flashfoward.  Wrong show.
