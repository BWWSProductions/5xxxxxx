[V],phatwarez,2010-06-17T09:04Z,"It's an mp3. You are not working.

Even though this is the ""leaked"" version without a chorus, this fucking sucks. Crap lyrics, crap flow, crap beat. Dre has given up on rapping to become a businessman, becoming the type of person he despised and ridiculed in his earlier albums.

I mean if snoop can top the charts with a katy perry pop flick dre can at least release something better then this."
