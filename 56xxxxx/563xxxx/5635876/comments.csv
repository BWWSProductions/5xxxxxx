,aomorphed,2010-06-18T23:04Z,"Hi Al_Jourgensen
patch with regionfrii
then use brickblocker
then you can run from normal channel if you have darkcorp
or neogamma 7 - 8 or 9"
,b3nburrito,2010-06-19T23:01Z,Use NeoRanga - can change to PAL or NTSC for any title.

,carlitosbob,2010-06-22T11:19Z,"oh, and once you have the USB loader working, make sure you change the video settings to console default. that way it actually works."
