,pedroriel,2010-09-04T19:42Z,"Thanks Mate. The Torrent is much appreciated. There's just no pleasing some people. If you want it perfect, pay the hundred bucks."

,Plasmadude,2010-12-18T10:35Z,WTF.   i recently DL  4 Bruce Leee films for 3.7 GB
,djmopa,2010-12-21T05:58Z,"Instead of complaining that you are getting something for free, why don't you stop your bitching and be thankful that NLUPPER was kind enough to upload 40gb of the one and only, Bruce Lee!

If you can write in English, but cannot understand it, something is wrong with your priorities... 

Not only do we want free milk, we want the entire cow!"
,parahax,2010-12-30T10:01Z,"awesome upload, been looking for a complete set of bruce lee ... however cant find any subs on the net to go with any of the movies .... can someone help me with subs or direct me to a complete torrent with subs inc? tbh, the subs should have been kept instead of just dutch, doesnt really make sense ... its 40gb, and subs arent even that large ... "
,parahax,2010-12-30T10:02Z,"sry, english subs pls"
,parahax,2010-12-30T10:08Z,"ok dont konw if anyone can see my comments, cos they seem to disappear. ok can anyone help me with subs or a complete torrent of bruce lee films with subs? thanks. english subs"
,pschlosser,2011-01-17T17:36Z,"you get another vote from me, overlooking it lacked english subs.  while, yes, there is dialog in ""english"" it is those parts in cantonese, easily 80% of some movie(s), that confound us non-dutch readers!  lol."
