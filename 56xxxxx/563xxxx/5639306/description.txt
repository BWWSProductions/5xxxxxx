Women in a Japanese Concentration Camp make a break for it with the help of some insiders. Their goal is to escape the clutches of the japanese and reach a hidden stash of gold that will aid China in buying weapons to fend off their enemies.

This is considered one of the greatest Women In Prison films ever made. Ric Meyers, author of the seminal book "For One Week Only: The World Of Exploitation Films", called it "the ultimate chain-gang kung-fu caper flick", while a leading cult movie website dubbed it "a great piece of Hong Kong filth that just can't be beat!"
