[V],bubanee,2010-06-18T15:03Z,@Jainmehul... i'm not sure if mods here can have accsess to whom clicks the quality feature.. i wouldn't worry to much about it you will always get the dickhead who clicks minus for the fun of it.. you could enquire at the forum and ask a mod to look into it or have it reset... if they allow it.. Unsure

[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-18T23:17Z,"@ baron

no you are not.  you get ""recommended"" for one for being an above average uploader.  there is a forum to suggest people.  then the mods review the uploader and decide themselves.

@ Bubs

YOU BEAT ME TO IT!! HAHA, nice upload as always."
[V],bubanee,2010-06-19T00:48Z,"Z... ;)

[V],jainmehul,2010-06-19T16:06Z,"hey bubanee what if we get a conclusion of ""it looks like mpeg with probability 95%

what does it conclude??"
[V],bubanee,2010-06-19T16:15Z,that means it's unsure... do the numbers match.. what music are you talking about??? 
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-19T16:50Z,"""do the numbers match"" means??? i m talking about flac"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-19T22:02Z,are you doing the Korn III album?  i just got a request for it and wanted to check with you.
[V],bubanee,2010-06-19T22:39Z,"hey Z... KornIII there is no release date down here.. unless i come across a scene/web.. or it's already out??? 
Hey J... don't worry about the matching numbers but 95% usually means 'Transcode' "
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-20T07:29Z,"i believe the official release date is July 13 (US).  i noticed the Ozzy album, here, and i received a request for the new Korn so i figured i'd ask seeing as its similar in style in the ""metal"" sense i guess.  if you don't do it i will most likely be posting it, unless of course you grab it before me.  either way i'm fine with it."
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-20T09:08Z,hey bubs can you tell me the perfect settings in EAC for ripping a FLAC...a link will also do
,Deznaj,2010-06-20T16:44Z,"@ jainmehul

Tjeez man, do you no ANYTHING???

Comment about the torrent, if you want to have a conversation use MSN..."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-21T00:13Z,"@ Deznaj

it's do you ""KNOW"" anything not ""no anything"" by the way.  if you have spelling issues use a spell checking program or go back and complete the first grade to learn how to spell simple words.

just kidding buddy!"
