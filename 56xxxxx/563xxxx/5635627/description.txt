This is a RAR of the downloaded files from RLSLOG.net

I put in a 5% recovery record when using WinRAR.

I got the 2 files directly from their posted links, so its the genuine article.

I tried other files from the 'Comments' section of the site but the filesize of the BIN/CUE was not right. I would strongly advise caution when dl'ing if not directly from their own 2 links!

I did detect a Win.32.Generic (steamclient.dll) warning from Kaspersky but it was HEUR (Heuristic) which means not a definite threat/virus signature. Since this was downloaded directly from their links, I decided it was okay - a false positive.

Anyway.. Have fun!

I installed the game, copied over the cracked files, and all worked as promised.
