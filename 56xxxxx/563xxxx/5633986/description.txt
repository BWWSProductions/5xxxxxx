Vyzygoth talks with Robert K. Denton -- a geologist certified by the American Institute Of Professional Geologists and a licensed Environmental Remediation Specialist.

Denton addresses all aspects of the BP oil disaster in the Gulf without hype or sensationalism.  He authoritatively conveys a greater depth and breadth of information than any "expert" I have heard since this crisis began, yet does it without losing the listener in technical jargon.  If you are interested in what really happened, why it happened and what could happen next, you owe it to yourself to hear this hour and twenty-eight minutes.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
