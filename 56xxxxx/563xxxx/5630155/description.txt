MC Lars' seven-track collaborative EP with K. Flay. This is a 50/50 split; they both bring plenty of fire to the table.
Ripped into FLAC compression level 8 with MediaMonkey

includes the liner notes/lyricsheet document and high-res cover art that came with the MP3 download version - the images are linked from the files rather than embedded in the tags.

-Tracklist-

1. Running Trains
Lars drops a verse in character as Flay, Flay does the same for Lars. I thought that was a really cool writing device.

2. It's A Party Y'all

3. Altered States
Lots of cool silly fun rhymes and such as they describe their travels.

4. The Game
Lars and Flay duel with tales of success in the club, and keep it more positive-spiritied than other examples of such material.

5. We Fresh

6. Somebody's Watching Me
Lars the cop and Flay the accused make for an interesting comment on the surveillance society.

7. Single and Famous
A blistering breakup-anger track that still maintains a fun energy.

I take #2 and #5 as the relatively weaker tracks, but this is still some good stuff.
