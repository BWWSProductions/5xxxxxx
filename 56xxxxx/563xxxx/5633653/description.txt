According to Amazon, Atlas Shrugged is;

"Ayn Rand's magnum opus, an electrifying moral defense of capitalism and free enterprise which launched an ideology and a movement is tremendous in scope and breathtaking in its suspense. The publication of this work in 1957 gained Rand an instant following and became a phenomenon. One man sets out to show what would happen to the world if all the heroes of innovation and industry went on strike. Is he a destroyer or a liberator? And why does he fight his hardest battle not against his enemies but against the woman he loves?"
