How positively republican. "

Her point isn't about being Philanthropic, or Charitable. Its her economic point of view that man betters other by trying to better himself. If a man wants to better his financial situation he might start a business, which provides a product that might better his customers. If he wants to expand his business to make more money, then he hires more workers which benefits them as well as the owner himself. Has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats. But I will tell you this, the Democrats are only charitable with other peoples money, not their own. The religious ""right"" which are most likely Republican are the most charitable segment of the American population and honestly the world population. But her book is mainly about economic principles. But do since you seem to dislike republicans just go read the stats on charitable giving among democrats and republicans and then pull your foot out of your mouth."
,theroyalist,2011-03-14T16:23Z,"Magichateball, Not, ""So the main point of Rand's books is 'Fuck You, I got mine!'"" Try 'Get your own, I EARNED mine.""

'And anybody that gives to the poor is an idiot. How positively republican.'

You mean people who study & work less than you? You mean Democrat voters, kept down by the ""self-made men"" like Kerry & Gore? Hah!"

Have you read the book(or listened to it?) 
Please give me a rational argument agents ONE sentence that John Galt said. He said a lot, and gave a logical explanation for everything he said.
Or are you a rotter? Do you value your life? Do you think that me having mine makes it so you can't have more? Do you think that any job you've had in your life, you could have done with out the mind? Could you know how to flip that burger, with out the mind who realized that meat could be cooked? Without the man who fought and thought his way into have a multimillion dollar business?  Could you build the car your drive? Could you build the computer you download from? Could you process that hamburger? 
Do you understand what greed means? Did you listen to a word he said? Could you employ thousands a people? Do these people that work at Apple have Job, without Steve Jobs being concerned with himself. If he where to give all the money he makes to all the looters that tell him that he owes it to them, that he has a moral empathetic to hand it out? Would his factories be able to afford the parts needed? What possible does he do when he's told that having a computer is a moral right, and even though he couldn't possible afford to make the computers? Let alone pay his staff? What then when does he do when they tell him he has employ the staff he can't pay, because all he money goes to the looters? 
These workers except their right to take what they need, that it's ""Form each according to his ablity, to each according to his need."" They wont get payed for long, the've excepted their death. Do they live for death?
Is this what you believe in? "
