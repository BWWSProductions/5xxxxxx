MW4 Mercenaries has been released to the public! Though this is slightly old news it has (for whatever reason) not made it to TBP. The MW4 games are still getting hits, but this is slightly better. There is no cd required and the game (source code) is getting updated and fixed. The only downside is the addition of Mektek items.. but is it really that bad??? If I remember correctly you can rename the mtx file to zip and open that way.

Enjoy, seed, and keep searching for that extra special torrent.
