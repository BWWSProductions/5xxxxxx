Thieves Like Us is a musical vehicle â€” an elegant starship, pointed straight to the heart of the listener. They align themselves musically with Europe,â€¦ (more) and consider Paris their home (although none of them are French). Pontus Berghe (drums) and Bjorn Berglund (keyboards) are from Sweden. Andy Grier (vocals) is from the United States. They met at a picnic in Berlin.People often ask them to describe their sound, and although they encompass a variety of influences, they ultimately consider themselves to be a POP BAND. Yes, the production style is both disco and hip-hop, but the sheer strength of the melodies and emotional depth of the songs makes them classics.
