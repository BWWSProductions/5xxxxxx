,highlander777,2010-08-21T14:40Z,"Thanks for the upload but...

This guy is just another doomsayer or whiner, depending on where you're from. He pulls numbers out of his ass about how many barrels of oil there is in a given location like he's some sort of f*cking geology expert. Then the next minute he admits that no one knows exactly how much oil there is. What an ass.

He has been preaching doom since the mid-1980s and now he claims he's right. It only took 25 YEARS for him to be right!

These guys are a dime a dozen. I know. I've listened to a bunch of them before and wasted money on them and their stupid advice. Only this guy somehow conned someone to film him.

Shit. I claim the economy will come back in 25 years. You heard it here first! Remember what I said! "
,dzlrules,2010-09-27T04:02Z,@highlander777 -- Are you an economy expert? No? Then STFU! :P
,Sick3r,2011-01-11T12:51Z,"@highlander777..

He talked about how many barrels of oil there was on the SURFACE and how many is used. And after he said they cant know how much oil is left IN THE GROUND. Idiot."
,harvey_weinstein,2011-01-15T22:07Z,@highlander777 I know exactly the type you're talking about. Thanks for helping me save my time and bandwidth by not d/l this.
,penwickpark,2011-04-09T19:32Z,Arigato!
,jpdeveau0,2011-08-14T17:04Z,any one have a 720p or 1080p version?
,mike000m,2012-01-06T01:14Z,"You fucking sheep will be the first to go lol. Well done for shunning mathematics you bunch of fucking idiots. This man is talking sense. There are 7,000,000,000 people on this planet as a result of OIL and it wont last forever, Do the math cretins."
,captsmoke,2012-02-05T22:07Z,"Thank you SUBMERGE, thank you raymondhome, and thank you thepiratebay."
,NaNaMoose,2012-05-13T21:18Z,"Thanks for having this & Keeping this going! No matter what you think about what he says, take the time to Listen & Think about it for yourself before you make any assumptions. I have heard Geological experts say the same thing 20 years ago. The guys that find Oil Fields for the Drillers. So don't be so quick to call the guy a crackpot."
