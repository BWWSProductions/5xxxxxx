Here's a color grid example:

Not complaining, the picture quality is great. And I definitely appreciate people uploading these.
This just gives you a sense of what's being cropped out, and how warped this video is.

(PS - This is the same file as all of the other Toy Story 3 torrents so far, just named differently and slightly stretched vertically)"

,RKLP,2010-06-30T19:44Z,"Great quality, very watchable. 
Only issue is written parts in the movie are in Russian and the one part that has subtitles, they're in Russian too.
Aside from that, 9/10"
