My bad to forget the step in the install notes to choose phone activation, so I'm glad you mentioned it here. :)"

Make sure you have a clean install of this version:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5632067/Avid_Media_Composer_5.0.0_full_software

Choose phone activation and use the codes in the Keygen. Make sure you follow the instructions eg. No Internet! 

If you messed up the process initially, you will probably need a clean uninstall - make sure you delete all the folders and file entries manually after uninstall."

,Ooops2,2010-06-26T05:26Z,AVCHD doesnÂ´t work whitout 10 digit code needed to activate the ac3 avchd part. Somebody help.
,inspiritx,2010-06-27T05:39Z,"Okay I'm posting this here just in case... the activator worked initially but now it does not.

Activation worked the first time but now I get an error: KCAV: Activation code validation failed

Did a fresh install of win7 and only installed avid. After a reboot, this error displays, followed directions and killed internet. Activator no longer works.

Any ideas?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-01T20:55Z,"@Activator

The keymaker generates codes based on your pc configuration, and once Avid hasd been unlocked it stays unlocked. Proabably your Avid connected to internet, otherwise it would stay registered."
,lungnut,2010-07-06T08:10Z,I am also needing the 10-digit activation number needed for AVCHD support. Anybody have any idea if this is ever going to happen? This program is useless to me without it.

,rajunix,2010-09-02T17:27Z,"how i could activate ""Dolby AC_3 Feature"" on Avid Media Composer 5, could anyone help me plz"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-03T01:31Z,"@PJMerk 

If you don't know how to run .exe files on a Mac then you shouldn't use a Mac at all. 

Search for it on google, and you'll be surprised of all the options."

,alphabe,2011-02-01T07:12Z,i tried to open this on my mac using crossover and it failed- said it was ejected. what's up?
,bind2011,2011-02-19T21:36Z,"this keygen no longer works with the download infoirmation provided, because Avid has updated their download to version 5.0.3, and changed activation - keys no longer activates the product"
,SeyR,2011-03-13T23:08Z,"@inspiritx   I had the same problem:  I upgraded my hardware (Motherboard, CPU and RAM) and now Avid is requesting activation - although it worked before.  

Furthermore, all attempts at a clean install with the key gen are failing - the serial number/system id etc. are staying the same on AVID, changing on the key gen, and they are not matching up.

What is the solution here?"
,mfalcon64,2011-03-15T19:08Z,"When importing AVCHD files it says I need to activate some sound software via phone or internet. When I use the phone option it tells me to use an activation code, but the generator's code won't work. Can you please help? All of my files are AVCHD. And we aren't supposed to connect to the net when using the program right? Please help
Thanks."

,lulzorama,2011-05-03T23:47Z,can someone explain why the effect editor is blank? 
,armchair.53,2011-05-26T06:06Z,"I downloaded this key along with the program and the key works fine provided you follow the instructions.  Someone claimed that the key no longer works because avid changed their database (how the person would know what goes on at avid is a question).  However, before one installs this program, you should consider how the program will work on your computer.  It has hugh resource needs (requires 3 GB ram)"
