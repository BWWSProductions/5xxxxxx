Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry - pdf

This is the report of the inquiry into the events of 'Bloody Sunday', when the
British army shot dead 13 civilians who were taking part in a civil rights
march in Derry in Northern Ireland. The inquiry, which published its findings 
yesterday, found that the British army soldiers did not shoot in response to 
the threat of lethal violence from protesters. Rather, the victims were unarmed
civilians, shot while fleeing from soldiers or going to the help of others.  

The report is available as a series of web pages from 
http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/
We have scraped these pages and converted the report into 10 pdfs, one for each
volume of the printed report. We hope this is useful to anyone who wants to 
print the report, read it in an ereader or archive it.

We have tried to make sure that the conversion from html to pdf has been done
accurately, but please let us know if you find any problems (which are not in
the original webpage). We will consider doing the same thing for the
transcripts of the hearing and the other evidence published by the inquiry if
enough people would find it useful. contact us at grouvert.collective@gmail.com
