Author:_________Razorsedge (Tucker)
Code name:_____Razorlight Rock of Ages: Guitar Gunslingers
Language:______English US
Size:__________2.42 GB (2,603,726,848 bytes) ISO
Architecture:___32-Bit
Version based:__Windows 7 Professional N Version

This build is based off of Windows 7 Professional N x86 by default there is only 4 tweaks applied

DEP is Disabled

Uac is Disabled

Power is set to high performance

Themes are patched to use 3rd party themes

This is my tribute to some of the greatest guitar players and rock bands in music. There is no Internet Explorer
or windows media center in the build, I have added windows media player that does not come with N versions
by default along with other media dll's that you will require. This build includes a great selection of rock 
walls, rock bands user pictures, sound bites (a lot applied by default with theme), 
Lots of custom cursors, a custom windows media player and custom windows picture viewer.

This build is trim and very fast you can apply only the tweaks you would like from wpi to customize your install
and be setup in 5 mins after install with only the tweaks you would like. There is a great amount of apps for you 
to choose from off the wpi. Including a custom rock msn messenger among others. Apps sounds tweaks cursors and so 
on will be listed below to see whats included.

I would like to thank Mr. Grim for being the best themer out there having used many of his elements in the
custom rock theme. I would also like to thank my buddy The Black Page for all his complaining on who and what bands
should be in this build lol[/color]

Turn The speakers up and play it loud Rock on!!!!
