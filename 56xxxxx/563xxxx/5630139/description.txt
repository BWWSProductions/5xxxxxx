Freekscape: Escape From Hell introduces Freek, a cute little demon who has discovered a magic trident. Inspired by the tridentâ€™s powers, Freek becomes determined to ascend out of the Netherworld and into Heaven. But, of course, he needs your help. Freek encounters a variety of unusual creatures in his fire-laden underground world. His new-found trident allows him to capture those crazy crawlers and turn them into different tools, depending on their abilities. For example, while an elastic-bed-like monster transforms the trident into a pogo stick, a sharp toothed goblin turns it into a cutting machine.
