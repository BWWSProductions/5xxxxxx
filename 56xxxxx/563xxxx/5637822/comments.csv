It was not until I read the ""Gulag Archipelago"" series of novels by Solzhenitsyn that I learned very much about the twenty to thirty million souls who died in forced labor camps or in the Kolyma mines, or were tortured to death building the white sea canal.
Stalin was in the model of Gengis Khan or Ivan the terrible, the cold blooded reptillian side of the Asiam history."
