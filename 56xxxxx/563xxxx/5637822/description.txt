Hi everyone, I chose to upload this Historical/documentary movie because I really want to show and share with you all, the true cruelty of the Communism regime during 1900s. The saddest thing is that there are still many people who deny it, and still believe in Marxism and communism, for example those young communist parties in different countries and even youngsters believe in it.  

Those who still denies this happening (RUSSIA denies it), or think that this was and are good, then I don't find any words to say those brainwashed people.... It's just so sad!!!!!
