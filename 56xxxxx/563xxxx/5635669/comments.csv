[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-23T05:21Z,"i dunno, do you think people want rap transfers? i did the other eminem ones because there the best rips out there for those songs, since they were already vinyl rips to begin with (i just added my special touch)

i do have the whole eminem collection (except infinite :P) i've got some kanye west and jay z and a few other jems too. 

if you guys want em let me know on the facebook page :D
