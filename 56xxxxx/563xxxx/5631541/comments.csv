,SonOFBaldr,2011-08-22T22:48Z,"I would hate to give wrong info, but after downloading and installing this, I got a bad virus and lost my internet and some other crazy virus typical events happened to my system.. after many hours on the phone with Norton and a few system restores I finally got everything back up.. but I am SCARED of this torrent now.. I have not been anyplace else i can think of that i could have gotten the virus from, and it was a bad one.. Please be careful. "

Tks to the uploader....will continue to seed for the benefit of others....""freely receive, freely seed"". BTW there are tons of themes which u can download and change everyday, depreding on your mood!

Cheeers!!!"
