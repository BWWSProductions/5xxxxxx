one thing for sure not the same monitor i am or you need glasses badly.

and actually i call that rather a large file size for a
mp4 file for a movie under 2 hours"

,UPflyer,2012-07-07T09:44Z,Thought that this file was pretty good quality! I first saw this movie when I was 11 yrs old and thought it fantastic; it's still a lot of fun.  Did'nt think I'd ever see it again...many thanks for making it available.
