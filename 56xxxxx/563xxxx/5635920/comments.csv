,SirReno8,2011-07-09T06:27Z,"Hi.  I already HAVE a decent, working, installable .ISO of this game, which I got from another torrent, along with ""Blur Update 2.""

I've installed it, and been PLAYING it..  It works pretty decently..  I guess..  I even was able to configure my old Xbox controller to work with it (NOT an Xbox 360 controller..  but an Xbox (original) Type-S controller, hardware-modified to fit into a USB port on my PC, with ""XBCD"" drivers to make the controller WORK on my PC, then some extra ""x360ce INPUT files"" which I placed within the game directory, to trick the game into thinking my (old) Xbox controller actually IS an Xbox360 controller.  I'm good at configuring controllers, & hardware, & stuff..

But let me WARN you, for a piece of SOFTWARE, THIS game takes a LOT of hardware & system POWER, in order to run it at full speed, with the in-game graphics settings on high (or maxed-out)..  But I just bought a ""decent-enough"" graphics card, and some extra RAM for my PC..  So I'm NOW able to run the game at full speed, by using the right combination of settings (semi-LOW, to medium settings) in both my graphics card settings, and the in-game graphics settings..  I mean, with CERTAIN games, I can run them perfectly fine, even if my computer is running other tasks in the background, like for instance, a VMware session (eating up a chunk of RAM), AND Vuze is open, downloading a torrent of something, for example, and I can STILL play games..

But for THIS game, I have to shut down EVERYTHING else I'm working on, and totally devote my PC to the game, just to get it to run full speed, with KINDA-nice, medium graphics settings...  So that's just ONE warning I wanted to put out there, to people installing this game..  Of course, if you're a REAL gamer, then you don't MIND that part -- because you probably have a suped-up POWERFUL gaming computer, on a 64 bit OS..  And you're ALREADY a person who makes sure nothing else is running in the background, when you play games (..or your computer is so powerful, that it doesn't matter)..  But for the more casual gamer / busy PC-users out there, or just a person with a slightly older processor, not 64-bit capable, so you're running a 32 bit OS, even with the highest graphics card you can FIND for your aging system, then you'll be a bit TAKEN by how much power this game requires, to run properly.

After buying a new (ish) graphics card, and some extra RAM, I finally found a configuration which WORKS for me, and got the game running full-throttle on the frame-rate.  I started having a lot of FUN with it..  But then I couldn't help but WONDER -- am I somehow MISSING OUT on some portion (or functionality) of the game??  Because like I said, the torrent I downloaded & installed came with just: the GAME, and Update 2 for the game...

But I never even installed Update 1..

..So I found THIS torrent, which includes BOTH updates..  (and a TRAINER?? -- what exactly does THAT do?)..  And I UN-installed the version of the game I was running (but backed up my save files & settings data).. then I RE-installed the game (but this time did NOT apply Update 2 yet)..  And I grabbed THIS torrent -- But within VUZE (my torrent client), I set the ""priorities"" to SKIP downloading the GAME from this torrent, but to simply download the UPDATES, and TRAINER (I still don't even know what that DOES?), and readme files, etc..

But the readme files are just for ""this"" or ""that"" particular update..  There is no MASTER readme file in this archive, which clearly explains how to install the game, and then the updates in the correct order, and then maybe a cracked exe or anything..  I would ASSUME as much to: install the game (which I already HAVE), then update 1 (from this torrent), then update 2 (from this torrent)..  But it gets all CONFUSING, because there is a THIRD ""update"" file in this archive, outside of the directories of updates 1 & 2..

The reason I'm GOING through all of this again, even though I already HAD a working copy of the game, is AGAIN, because I never installed update 1..  So THIS time, I"
,SirReno8,2011-07-09T06:31Z,"So THIS time, I decided: first I want to try installing update 1...  And THEN installing update 2..  And then playing the game again, to see if there is any difference, between the version I WAS playing before (with JUST update 2 installed), and THIS installation (with updates 1 AND 2 installed)..

..But I'm somewhat LOST all of a sudden, amidst my re-installation.  I've re-installed the game, but it is very RAW (it is not cracked, nor updated, at all)..  I'm taking a PAUSE, to determine my next move more carefully..

..So, does anyone KNOW??  What exactly is included in each update?  Are the updates CUMULATIVE (meaning I can just install update 2, and AUTOMATICALLY get all benefits which were included in update 1)??

I guess if they ARE cumulative, then I just did an ""un-install / re-install"" for NOTHING, because I was already RUNNING the most updated version of the game (even with ONLY ""update 2"" installed)..  Right?

What's with the whole ""57670 to 58755"" thing???  Why are there at least TWO instances of updater files matching that description inside this archive, AND a third update file, somewhere in the mix?  Which one is the right one to use?  What is the ultimate version of this game, and what exactly IS so ""updated"" about it??

The reason I'm so INTERESTED in what the UPDATES do, and even the SLIGHT differences in the various VERSIONS of this game, is because:

""UPDATES"" are created to fix many different things, from controller compatibility, to graphics glitches, to crashes..  And SOMETIMES, to fix ""MEMORY LEAKS,"" which negatively affect performance speed.  If that IS the case, then with THIS game, I'm not so much worried about controllers or anything (I already HAD that part configured properly)..  I'm more concerned with keeping my RAM, processor, and graphics card running at full efficiency..  I was LUCKY, to finally FIND a decent, working, full-speed configuration on my CPU for this game -- BUT, if there IS anything included in these updates, which can make the game run even faster, better, smoother..  Then that's WHAT'S UP!  Because then perhaps I can crank the settings up a little MORE, without any slow-down.  That's all I was REALLY looking for, when I stumbled across this (because this game is such a system ""RESOURCE-HOG,"" that I just wanted to make sure I didn't MISS anything, from update 1, etc)..

Anyway, thanks for this torrent..  Or at least the UPDATES & stuff in it.  Peace."
,SirReno8,2011-07-09T09:44Z,"..Alright, nevermind.  Everything is FINE now..  I know the answers to my own questions already.  Only update 2 is necessary, as it requires the original factory installation to be present when installing it.  So I DID already have the correct version of the game..  Oh well, it seems to be working even better now, after that uninstall / reinstall, AND I picked up a trainer from you in the process.  I know what it does, but I don't intend to use it yet.  I'm putting it on a shelf, to play with later.  Thanks again, and happy gaming to all.  Enjoy Blur.  Peace."
,Messi_1995,2011-08-04T14:05Z,pls sm1 upload a mac version of this game......i'll be really very grateful.......:D
