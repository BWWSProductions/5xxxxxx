==========================================================================

Pushing house grooves and the odd rock sensibility, LHB are serving up a sound that might best be described as the bouncing love child of Daft Punk and Depeche Mode.

Opening with the straight-forward stomp "No Transmission" the album progresses through an impressive menu of electro, guitar jangles, bleeps and synth swells. The charming title track "Tell 'Em Who We Are" makes headway in to the calmer waters of Royksopp whilst "Coming Up For Air" assisted by the emotive Imogen Heap on vocals is a claustrophobic, twisting, analogue breakbeat lope reminiscent of the Crystal Method.
