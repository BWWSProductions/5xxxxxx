,IMpapawheelie,2010-06-17T21:12Z,"Well thanks for your attempt to up load this movie,
but obviously NOT burn tested.. still encrypted...
I really wish that you would state, whether or not they have been burn tested or not, but have come to find out most LKRG ups aren't.. A waste of good dvds.."
,jake1er,2010-06-17T21:44Z,"Hahaha... haha.... wow
Let me just say im a huge UFC Fan....
I've watched about 3-4 movies a week for the last 15 years... and this is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen."

,mcjiralo,2010-06-18T02:57Z,thanks
,hatebreeder80,2010-06-18T03:31Z,"thanks again for the up

quality looks more like a screener rather than a dvdrip but its still pretty good quality.

kinda crappy movie but i just wanted to see some ufc fighters do some bad acting.

A/8
V/8
M/4 only cus theres fighting and tits in it or else it would be a 0 or 1

thanks again agentpiratebay"
,hatebreeder80,2010-06-18T03:38Z,"Oh yeah i forgot to say when i watched Universal Soldier Regeneration or whatever its called, i saw a lot more mma fighting in that than in this movie.
the fighters in this have slow and fake looking choreography and basically no grappling. pretty much every fight is just 2 guys swinging their fists"

,JoeySix,2010-06-21T03:04Z,"Ya Hands down has to be one of the worst movies i have wasted the time watching... i was actually Embarassed for the actors on how poor they were... the fighters have a reason they are fighters but the actors that played the other parts.... and whats with Dean Cain, wow its a long way down to the bottom for him from his Louis and Clark superman days."
,DevilPrez,2010-06-21T10:50Z,circle of pain....gay movie about an anal sphincter which is harassed by an evil martial arts dildo

No one is Blaming the poster for putting this up, not in the slightest, but this comment area is for people to comment on the DL itself about Video quality, Audio Quality and over all movie quality. Which is all those that have commented have done. the quality is is good for A/V but for overall M=0  and if it helps for someone to not waste their time and bandwidth on this then the better... i mean the fighting is terribad too... so overly Coorigraphed its pathetic."
,Swirl78,2010-06-27T09:42Z,"LMAO! I love the title of one review on imdb named, ""The only 'Circle of Pain' will be your eyeballs watching this drivel"". "
,nekoryu,2010-07-01T17:50Z,"oh. my. God. this movie is the biggest pile of shit i've seen in a long time. Frank Mir, man, why the fuck are you doing this ? Just fight man. Fight."
