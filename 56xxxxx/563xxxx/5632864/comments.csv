,dukisd,2010-06-19T11:03Z,very slowly....can this torrent go faster?
,warrik73,2010-06-19T19:01Z,"Thanks for posting guys!
dukisd, I changed a few setting in utorrent, it should be seeding a bit faster now."
,slrosado,2010-06-19T21:28Z,"Wen I tried to download the file I got this message:

One or more files exceed the file system size limit, these files can not be saved properly.

Can someone tell me what this means? And how I can download the file?

Thanks"
,warrik73,2010-06-20T02:29Z,"slrosado, what OS are you using?  and how much free hard drive space do you have?  This file is a little over 17 GB in size, and the only thing I can think of is that you have a fairly old OS, and/or are running low on hard drive space.  Hope that helps."
,himter2,2010-06-20T18:42Z,"yep, sounds like you have and old OS and a fat or fat32 file system. you will need to switch it NTFS before it can handle a file this big. look for a tool called partitionmagic it may be able to convert it without the hassle of a reformat."
,XRedNinjaX,2010-06-21T05:42Z,"I downloaded everything and followed the instructions that you gave but I got the""#134 error"" half way through the loading screen to enter Belfalas, just wondering if there was any fix."
,himter2,2010-06-21T22:19Z,try messing with your video settings before you enter.
,warrik73,2010-06-22T01:14Z,"XRedNinjaX,
I did some searching around on your error message and I agree with himter2, for the most part this error seems to be a possible video memory issue.  If your system hasn't been re-booted in a while try a reboot.  If you have already tried that do a google search for the error you are getting, and look at those links.  I'm sure you will find an answer to your problem."
,Virion,2010-07-12T09:05Z,The connection gettin very slow at 97% ... Erm ...
,dirtyegg13,2010-07-16T23:39Z,"Everytime I log in, it starts connecting and then says that I have to restart and download a patch. So I install the patch then restart the game, but the same message keeps coming up.rnCan somebody PLEASE tell me what Im doing wrong?"
,th4n0z,2010-07-20T14:50Z,"hey everyone. I have a slight problem. I see in many torrents(just like here) comments like ""i dowloaded it on 1.1MB/s - 2MB/s"".I never download this fast! I have a 24 MB/s internet connection and the biggest speed i have ever seen is 700KB/s. Am I doing something wrong?? For example i am downloading this torrent with only 200-300KB/s."

,klintmane,2010-09-11T09:29Z,"@th4n0z It doesn't just depend by the internet speed but also from its quality.I've got a 1Mb internet connection and my torrents speed is usually 200-300,there are times i reach 600-800 and sometimes even 1-2Mb/s.Mines a Dsl+2,router and I share it with 2 other people"

,capmoq,2011-03-12T23:20Z,"Now read this and you can play WoW for free on the best private server in Europe.

Ok this is all you need to do:
1. Download the game (make sure it's EU, you can even download it from blizzard).
2. Update the game but not over the patch 3.3.5a.
3. Go to game directory. Open Data -> enGB -> realmlist (notepad).
4. Replace ""set realmlist eu.logon.worldofwarcraft.com"" with ""set realmlist wow.freakz.ro"".

More of the server
- All instances are working (WOTLK - Ruby Sanctum, ICC, TOC; BC - Black Temple, Tempest Keep)
- Server located in Romania
- 3000+ members online each day
- PVP all arenas working and classes fully scripted
- Helpful and committed GMs
- Armory and everything you could wish for are on the site
- Customizable rates (reputation and experience)
- No lag at all (100mbps net, Core I7 980, 16 BG RAM)
- Working Dungeon Finder

So if you want to give a chance to Freakz server then go to http://wow.freakz.ro/register.php?inviter=1654. There register and you are good to go.
For more info, contact me via mail (capmoq@gmail.com) or in game under player Capmoq (alliance).

Have fun :)"
