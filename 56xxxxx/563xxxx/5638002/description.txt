Cbt nuggets-Certified Ethical Hacker Series

You're up late, banging away at your keyboard. You find the hole you were looking for. Now you just find the right directory, copy a couple files, back right out of the system, and erase your tracks. Within 15 minutes of finding a back door into the network, you've downloaded transaction data for all credit card transactions within the last two years. You'd think credit card processing companies would be more secure than that.
The FBI should be busting down your door any minute now. But they won't. You print out your keystroke logger info. You make a phone call. "I got in." They don't believe it. But when you deliver the keystroke log the next day, they're floored. They cut you a check, and offer you an even bigger contract to help them fix the hole.

Do things that should get you arrested - but get paid instead. Ethical Hacking is so cool.

"What makes this knowledge so valuable?"

The work you do as an Ethical Hacker can save businesses from massive harm. You get to find and close off vulnerabilities that hackers could otherwise exploit to get inside your network and steal or even destroy data. By getting there first, you prevent leaks of sensitive information - even fraud and identity theft against employees and customers.

Businesses recognize the value of security pros that are able to shut down "back-doors" into their network. Protecting their sensitive data protects their livelihood. Because the work you do as an Ethical Hacker can prevent significant harm to their business, companies will pay you top dollar to do some of the most interesting work in information security.

"What will Ethical Hacker training teach me?"

In this series you'll learn the 5 Steps of a Hack. You'll also learn legal considerations for working as an Ethical Hacker. You'll learn all about passive intelligence gathering, and get suggestions for gathering critical information through social engineering.

Other things covered in the Certified Ethical Hacker Series include TCP exploits, ICMP exploits, and other network reconnaissance techniques; pulling packets out of network communications to sniff passwords, hubs, and switches; SNMP and DNS exploits; password cracking; gaining unauthorized access to a wireless network; erasing your tracks after penetrating a network; web and file exploits too dangerous to name; and much more.

"Does this training cover the Certified Ethical Hacker exam?"

The Certified Ethical Hacker Series covers more than how to exploit your network, and how to use that knowledge to keep others from doing the same thing. It also maps to the exam objectives for CEH certification from EC-Council. It's a comprehensive resource to use for both exam prep and on-the-job reference, so you can add this valuable certification to your resume.

"Isn't this knowledge dangerous?"

From CBT Nuggets CEO Dan Charbonneau:


"I actually had a wave of fear hit me as I was half-way through reviewing this series. 'We can't sell this.' That was my gut reaction. It's too dangerous, it teaches too much, it's too powerful. My second thought was, 'We need to sell this to as many people as possible', thinking it safest if the people being attacked know exactly how to attack, and therefore how to protect."
Prerequisites
