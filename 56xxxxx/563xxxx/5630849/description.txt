Proper note

iNCOGNiTO have done it again! 
Their release will not play on vlc or on my Harman Kardon DVD25.
In order to play their release on vlc you have to mount their .img first. That sucks big time

Here you have a release that works
and I have not changed the DVD structure as some others do.
