Big oil means big money. Very big money
And that fact unleases corruption that
streches from Houston to Washington to the
Mideast - and ensnares industrialists, princes,
spies, politicos, oilfield laborers and terrorists
in a deadly, deceptive web of moves and
countermove.

Gearge Clooney, Mat Damon and Jeffrey Wright lead a 
stellar cast in a lightning-paced, whip-smart
thriller. From its very first scene, Syriana grips
yor mind and nerves with a intensity that doesn't
let go for a instant. What is the price of oil?
This "engrossing, insiders tour of the world's
hottest spots, grandest schemes and most dangerous
men" has a jolting answer.


                               Enjoy & peace out
