,criscool,2011-05-14T01:56Z,How do i change the *.dmd to *.iso?? help please
,jpengwin,2011-05-25T07:45Z,will it still work if i update?
,trentonp,2011-08-16T19:23Z,Please Insert cd? what do I do?
,pssyluvr,2011-10-11T03:52Z,I accidentally updated it and got the insert cd/dvd too. I just went into my trash can and grabbed the old discarded version and dropped it back in with the new updated version. When it asked me if I wanted to replace the new with the old I pushed yes and it worked again without the insert cd/dvd coming up again. 
,fairy20121,2012-05-14T02:31Z,"Works on Lion. Just don't install update. When it asks for serial numbers, ignore and hit play. Make sure you check OFF on the initial window. 

Thank you for the upload."
