Step by step instructions are in the Readme file."
,Chemognoza,2010-06-20T21:58Z,"My console is not JTagged.
Will USB Flash Drive alone suffice?"
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-06-20T23:51Z,"Yes, you do not need a J tagged console, it works with a completely unmodified xbox."
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-06-21T09:57Z,"INSTRUCTIONS (also in the Readme):

1. Plug your USB Flash Drive into your Xbox 360 and go to System Settings -> Memory -> USB Stick -> Configure Now

2. After the usb is configured to be an xbox hard drive, go to Hard Drive -> Themes, and copy or move one of your themes onto your usb stick. Do the same for a Gamer Picture.

3. Now plug your usb stick into your computer and open USB Reader. Click on File -> Open Device -> Content -> 000000000000 -> FFFE07D1 -> 0030000 (themes) and 00020000 (gamer pics)

4. Unzip the contents. Copy all of your themes into your themes folder (00030000) in the USB Reader program and all of your gamer pics into your gamer pics folder (00020000).

5. Exit USB Reader and unplug your usb stick. Plug it into your xbox 360. Move all of your recently downloaded themes and gamer pics onto your Xbox Hard Drive (it is easier to use the Transfer Content feature, by pressing Y while the Memory Stick is open).

6. Enjoy your free premium themes and gamerpics :)

7. SEED! Other people want to enjoy everything you just downloaded, so spread the love and seed it.


I am currently making custom themes right now and I will be uploading a custom theme pack as well as more premium themes and gamerpics, so stay tuned!

Here is a taste of things to come: http://www2.snapfish.com/snapfish/slideshow/AlbumID=2523907023/PictureID=77835472023/a=2435211023_2435211023/otsc=SHR/otsi=SPIClink/COBRAND_NAME=snapfish/

Sorry the picture is bad quality, I took it with my phone..I need to find out a way to take proper screenshots of the xbox dashboard. If anyone has suggestions then let me know :)"

,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-06-23T08:08Z,"No problem :)

For future info to other people: 

the gamerpic packs are two packs and when you transfer them to your hard drive then try to choose a gamerpic in the profile edit area, you will get all the gamerpics from these packs.

To get both of your folders to show up, move a gamerpic from your xbox to your usb, and a theme from your xbox to your usb, and that will let both of the folders show up when you open your usb stick on your computer."
,RedHouse512,2010-06-29T03:25Z,"Hey if you can add any of these gamerpics for upload I would not only appreciate it, but I would  consider you a God among men.

,alpa_chino,2010-07-04T15:12Z,"Got the themes working, but I can't get the pics, they're transferred to xbox, I can see them on the list  but I cannot select them.WTF?"
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-07-05T23:09Z,"On which list can't you select them? Just move the files from your usb drive to your hard drive, then in Edit Profile, select your gamer picture that you would like."

,trackr12,2010-07-20T04:05Z,"Do you need to mod your xbox to use these, because when I used the themes(I tried all of them)the friend background doesn't show up. Also, there is no FFFE07D1 folder in the usb reader. "
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-07-20T05:48Z,"You don't need to mod your xbox for these. Some of these might not have the friend backgrounds. And it may not be named that, just look through the folders until you can figure out which one is themes and which one is gamer pictures."
,MHK_X,2010-07-20T19:57Z,DUDE HELP PLS I CANT SELECT ANY GAMER PICS IT SHOWS UP BUT I CANT SELECT IT.The Themes work.
,simonxu,2010-07-21T08:39Z,"nice work!but i have a problem the themes work but for the friends part, it is still the ugly green and white logo? please help"
,PolemicalPorcupine,2010-07-28T08:08Z,"Like the others have said, the gamer pictures show up as if they can be selected, but when you select it it doesn't change your gamer picture. Do you know what's up?"
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-07-29T23:28Z,"I'm not sure why the gamer pictures won't work for some, it has worked for others and myself. Try deleting them from the xbox hard drive and restarting the process."
,PolemicalPorcupine,2010-07-30T10:34Z,I tried again and it is working fine. Thanks! Please comment if/when you update again.
,DevilOf9,2010-08-18T10:15Z,I was just thinking how ace it would be if someone put together a themes pack...then bam it was already done.RESPECT Mate :)
,oempaloempatest,2010-08-23T00:03Z,"step 4 ""unzip the files""
The files don't even have extensions, and therefore no program can unpack them.
When i name them .zip or .rar the files are still unable to be openend by winzip,winrar, 7zip and izarc"
,Terrarazor,2010-09-06T17:11Z,A LARGE MAJORITY OF THESE THEMES AREN'T EVEN PREMIUM. THEY'RE JUST BACKGROUND PICS.

This modification, is the easiest to do, and absolutely won't get you banned.  

I rate this torrent a 10 for being complete and with instructions (not that you'd need them).  Keep Seeding!"
,Mike321730,2011-02-11T02:10Z,"I know this is a old torrent but if your having the ""can't select gamer pic"" problem you'll need to connect on Xbox LIVE for XBL to sync your GT on the pic."
