,biz11,2010-06-18T19:16Z,I'm seeding as much as I can but I can't leave my comp on 24/7 and depending where I am I might have either a really crappy connection or a really fast one...just give it some time :)
,plrk,2010-06-18T19:27Z,"as long as you keep coming back I'm cool. :) when you have finally uploaded a full copy, this torrent will soon have a lot of seeders - the swarm is hungry!"
,i89nnop,2010-06-19T20:26Z,No one have 100 % ?
,i89nnop,2010-06-19T20:43Z,No seeds...
,biz11,2010-06-19T21:49Z,"I have 100%, see my comment above...I can't seed 24/7...tomorrow I'll have way faster speeds."
,shahane,2010-06-22T05:52Z,"Is this the original version that's just been remastered?  Or is this the ""blasphemous"" edition, with Han firing first and the wrong actor as Anakin's ghost in the end?"
,biz11,2010-06-22T16:08Z,"This is the updated versions, with Han shooting first, etc.  I'm pretty sure the original versions have never (and never will be) released in HD.   But if you want DVD versions of them try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5335527/Star_Wars_Trilogy_%28The_Original_Unaltered_Trilogy%29.  I'm currently downloading it so can't comment on the quality but from the comments it seems good."
,shahane,2010-06-25T02:19Z,"OK.  Thank you so much, both for sharing these and for the tip on the link to the other versions.

Cheers!"
,TNAThane,2010-10-04T19:36Z,"Just finished this torrent for about 3 days downloading. Amazing quality, Thank you very much ""biz11""."
