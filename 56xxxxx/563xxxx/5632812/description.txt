This is truly an amazing compilation of Bob Schneider. I first heard him on a geology class trip to the Badlands in South Dakota and fell in love. Listen to all his live stuff because it is simply hilarious and cleverly thought out. This torrent is definitely for Bob lovers and new listeners alike. Since the torrent was so big, I compressed each album individually so that you may select/deselect which albums you prefer if you are using utorrent. There are 35 albums ranging from 320kbps to 96kbps, its a hit or miss. If you truly want to hear and learn from Bob, you will Download the whole thing!

Please seed.
Enjoy.
