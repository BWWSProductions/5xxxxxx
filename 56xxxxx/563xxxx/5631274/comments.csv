,tycobee,2010-08-29T12:02Z,"kcooolboy, I'm sure you can download an Atlas on TPB. Or look in an actual atlas. Or google map it. or look on wikipedia. Or ask you grade 3 geography teacher."

,thedesmodus,2010-09-09T12:20Z,"It could be me, but for me all the guides exist of multiple PDF's with partly scrambled filenames.

Am I doing something wrong? it would be great if it comes per book as 1 PDF.

Of course I could attach the PDF's and make it one myself, but I was thinking that perhaps something went wrong with my unRAR'ing (OS X)."

,apugarnesh1947,2010-12-16T18:02Z,"No it simply comes that way (assorted pdfs) because (i think) that's how lonely planet sells it.

would be nice if someone put each book as a single pdf, but takes a little work."

,dyzner,2011-01-13T15:43Z,"I was wondering if anyone has the password for the files. Out of all the files only 3 are not password protected, if I get the password to unlock the others I'll combine them into one document for easy downloading. Cheers, D"
