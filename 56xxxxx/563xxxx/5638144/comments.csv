,boethiah12,2011-02-17T13:52Z,good upload. but why is the download so big?
,LORDLORD,2011-11-25T14:11Z,"All is good,

subs works with vlc, not bs player,

dual audio is ok, 

but i must choose subs japanese (2) to show english sub

but all is alright, 

i watch jap audio and eng sub! 

nice"
