Rare Earth is an American  rock band affiliated with Motown's Rare Earth record label (which was named after the band), who prospered in 1970-1972. Although not the first white  band signed to Motown, Rare Earth was the first big hit-making act signed by Motown that consisted only of white members. (The Rustix were signed before them and were an all white act, but did not have any hits).
