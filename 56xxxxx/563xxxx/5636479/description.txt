Review:

Who is this mysterious buxom beauty? She's an office worker, a motorcycle racer, a street musician, a police officer, and most of all, a warrior of love. Fitted with her father's invention, the I-System, she can transform herself into anyone she wants to be. The nefarious organization called Panther Claw is kidnapping girls across Japan and stealing all the gold and the police are powerless to stop them. Now, their leader, sister Jill, wants Honey's I-System neckband to reviver her beauty and gain immortality. With the help of her friends, Natsuko, a hard-headed police officer, and Seiji, an easy-going reporter, Honey will prove that there's no greater power than love.
