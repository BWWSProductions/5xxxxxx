,kanha,2010-06-19T07:07Z,"@Riddler
i mean the torrent folders & files also...."
[V],RiddlerA,2010-06-19T07:15Z,"@ kanha 

Actually I don't like to see name of Uploader on video files
I always renamed the files whenever I used to download from axxo or other - That's why I only keep the name, yr & type on video file and Movie name & year on folder in my uploads ........ Just a lot more neat & To the Point presentation"
,h_khan_online,2010-06-19T19:26Z,good thinking RiddlerA.
,wira020,2010-06-19T20:01Z,"Hye there, I dont know where should i submit request, kinda new at this.. I hope you can do True Blood season 3.. which is now at episode 1... I know there's many uploaders out there that did it.. but i really prefer your mkv rips because of the size... but if you're not doing it because you dont have interested in the show or something, it's ok.. wouldnt want to put pressure on you hehe.. 

You're doing a great job mister.. thank you so much..."
,h_khan_online,2010-06-21T00:59Z,"Thanks for the movie bro ridd.

,shasha2333,2010-10-21T09:39Z,"625kbps for bitrate? Really what's the point of even using a bluray source at that low of a bitrate? If you play this via a bluray players usb port on a HDTV it looks like crap, never use less than 1600kbps"
[T],Oceanhawk,2010-10-26T18:23Z,"You are AWSOME!!! you have a TON of great HIGH QUALITY movies. im going to download XMEN 1,2 and 3 right now. Thanks again for your hard and commited work."

,DukeNukem513,2011-07-11T03:55Z,"Torrent seems like a hassel if you had planned to stream it to your xbox 360 or PS3, like me, since they can't stream the .mkv format. You'd have to convert it and lose quality to play it or download a video player that can play it and be forced to watch it on your computer."
,PsB21,2011-07-31T17:52Z,Pls Seed!
,Igneous_X4,2011-08-20T11:48Z,"Thanks, uploader."
