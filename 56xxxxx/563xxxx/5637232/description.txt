Thomas Love Peacock: 1785-1866. Bon viveur, satirist,
and Shelly's literary executor.

'He was sent, as usual, to a public school, where a
little learning was painfully beaten into him, and
from thence to the university, where it was carefully
taken out of him.'

Shelly introduced him into the radical literary set;
whom he satirised for the rest of his life. He wrote
novels of ideas set against guests in country houses.
The best are 'Headlong Hall' and 'Nightmare Abbey'.

His set pieces and word play were adopted by Tom Stoppard.
It's no coincidence if the setting, and lines like: 'I
almost think it is the ultimate destiny of science to
exterminate the human race', remind you of, say,
Stoppard's 'Arcadia'.
