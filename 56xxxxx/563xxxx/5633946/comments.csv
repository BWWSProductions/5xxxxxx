,tacopaste,2010-09-20T03:58Z,Pretty sure it's 128kbps re-encoded
,j-a-k-e,2010-12-08T01:17Z,"Now I have to agree with tacopaste, this is definitely NOT a 320kb rip mp3 and is most likely a 128k re-encode. People need to realise that taking a shitty low quality rip and re-encoding it as '320kb high quality' DOES NOT make it sound ANY better than the crap it was before. 

It's rather the equivalent of taking a movie on a cam at 640x480 and wondering why it still looks like ass once you re-author it to 720p and play it on your big shiny HD screen.

It's a matter of crap in crap out, this mp3 should have been left as is instead of re-encoding it to 320kb  the extra KB are a complete waste of space. Also people such as myself who prefer the benefits of higher bit rate files don't have to waste our time downloading just to find we've got a shitty re-rip."
