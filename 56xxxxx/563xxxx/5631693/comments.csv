[T],ctang,2010-06-16T17:58Z,"when i put this on a dvd i for some reason did a movie only with all the audio and all the subtitles, its free and no one else has this up and seeding so i figured its still worth it

next will be Band Camp, Beta House, Forest Gump, and Dont Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-06-17T04:48Z,thank you man and its size is so small y...........
[T],ctang,2010-06-17T15:28Z,its so small because its a movie only...i stripped everything but the audio and subtitles when i made a copy of it a few years ago...im not being mean but it says everything in the description
,T-Fish,2010-06-17T17:32Z,"i guess he asked because the untouched movie
only is about 5gb. so reducing it to dvd5 size would have been better.

not complaining fyi :p"
[T],ctang,2010-06-17T17:36Z,ya i dont know why i removed everything from this...i can reup this in full dvd9 if people want it because i just talked to my sister and she has an old rental that she bought...im only going to do that if people say on here that they want it...so LET ME KNOW lol
,slimshady27,2010-07-25T00:56Z,might be a stupid question.... but if there are no menus then how are we gonna select the language between spanish and english?
