,RushNYC,2010-07-14T22:30Z,"I did receive a \""Warning\"" from Starz LLC, Bay TSP also but it was from my internet provider, I\'m so pissed off because now they are going after the small fish in the pond and our own ISP\'s are helping them. I know somehow or another my privacy was invaded otherwise they wouldn\'t have sent me a \""Warning\"" ...I am definitely investing in some IP address protection now...and no this is not a joke or scare tactic it happened to me TODAY for snatching this movie YESTERDAY...so pissed off, i had to make an account just to vent this BULL"
