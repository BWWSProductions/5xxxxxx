Now for the fine print....

   This torrent was created by me (Baron Von Watermelon) using the 1995 soundtrack release as well as MP3s collected from various other sources. The tracks are arranged as they appear in the film (according to the IMDB website).

*  The track "2ft O' Butt Crack" by Circle The Wagon is not commercially available. Trust me, I emailed the guy who wrote it. While we're on the topic, Circle The Wagon isn't and wasn't a real band anyway.

** Song: "A piece of music accompanied by sung lyrics". The music playing when Lloyd drops Mary off at the airport is not a song, nor is the music playing when Lloyd gets accosted by Sea Bass in the bathroom, therefore they are not present in this torrent. It is also worth mentioning that they aren't commercially available either.
