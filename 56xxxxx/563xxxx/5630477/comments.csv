,BaronVonWatermelon,2011-04-09T21:24Z,"I didn't include it because it wasn't actually ""played"" in the film, so to speak.

For those who are interested, the song is called Mockingbird and is by Charlie and Inez Foxx."
,everlastcro,2011-04-10T01:57Z,"yes i know, i was just kiding about that soundtrack (also most annoying sound in the world xd)

anyway good torrent, thx"
,angel255ad,2012-02-20T01:33Z,ERHHHHHH EXCUSE ME GIGOLO AUNTS IS WRONG that is not WHERE I FIND MY HEAVEN you should correct it dude!
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-03-23T22:24Z,"@angel255ad:

Firstly, take your 'caps lock' and f**k off.

Secondly, the mentioned track is indeed in this torrent, but (as I have recently discovered) is mislabeled.

Harden up, and figure it out for yourself."
,The_Lon,2012-04-21T23:26Z,"Some of the track listings are incorrect.  Corrections: 

05 - Where I Find My Heaven, by Gigolo Aunts
07 - Hurdy Gurdy Man, by Butthole Surfers
10 - You Sexy Thing, by Dee-Lite
13 - Too Much of a Good Thing, by The Sons ft Bret Reilly
14 - The Bear Song, by Green Jelly

Otherwise, nice download.  Really takes me back to the 90s."

Thanks for clarifying where the errors are, mate. I guess I got a little sloppy when I tagged this one."
