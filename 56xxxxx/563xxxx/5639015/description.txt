It's a true sequel, with Kay Parker and her mammoth breasts getting ample screen time, and that cute redhead Dorothy LeMay getting the Starring role. 'Sinema' at its finest. "Cecil B. DeMille had his biblical epics, John Ford has his westerns, and Mel Brooks his comic spoofs. In the world of adult porn, Kirdy Stevens has the market cornered on incest." If your looking for erotic, sensual porn to watch over and over again and still be amazed at the scenes, this is the film for you.
