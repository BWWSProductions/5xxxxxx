My dear friend Patty made this recording  wind chimes.
She is a professional singer, and brought all her wind chimes
into the studio one day and made a recording with them.
She was inspired to do so after buying a wind chime CD for 
some occation, and the CD "proved to be just dreadful!"
The recording is live, and I had the pleasure of watching her
dance in a trance, moving round and round a circle of chimes. 
Magical.

Created by request.
I hope few folks might explore a few minutes of peace and
reflection while listening (actively or not) to the track.

It can also create the sensation of a cool breeze on dead-
calm hot days... I swear.

Thanks for sharing & caring.
Cheers, FerraBit
