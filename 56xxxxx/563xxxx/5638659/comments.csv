,Rotok,2010-06-27T07:51Z,I'll take it that since I have 12 seeds and 40 leechers that my first upload is a success!
,blindfaith74,2011-01-15T20:40Z,thank you so much! great video quality! I have a question if you still around. did your australian dvds have english or spanish subtitles? my english is not very good and I find a little difficult to fully enjoy the eps without them. so maybe if not much to ask could you please extract them as srt and put them in another torrent. anyway thanks for the torrent !
,Rotok,2011-02-10T06:22Z,"Sorry took so long to get back...
If you require the spanish subs, I found some brazialian online you might can make due with,
just rename the sub files to exactly the same as my files for the corresponding episodes
If you google search Earth Final Conflict Season Two Subtitles you should get a few good hits (tpb wouldnt let me post the link itself, oh well :) )"
