,hahalolfailmupp,2011-04-22T17:38Z,"Well scan it yourself, gives no warnings on 3 different pcs, 3 different AVs, and also checked with patchdiff2 + IDA, so if you find something that is not a false positive you are a retard.

This is old, there are new versions, and they are also free from viruses. Some versions do have viruses, and they are quarantined by good AVs the second they are unpacked on your system, unless you run the shitty AVG AV.

If you don't want it, leave, if you want to ease up your addon updates dl this with the old 4.0.1.88 version and see for yourself that this is not a virus/malware/trojan/keystroke w/e/worm of any kind.

When will people fucking learn how to sort out false positives? "
