The campaign (if you can call it that) is really weak and very short. Unless this has a crack to play online i'm not going to download this."
,Aevis,2010-06-22T23:14Z,"Online doesn't seem to work and there's some weird shit going on in the campaign too... 90% of the AI doesn't do anything at all, except spam lands. It gets kinda boring to play against those kind of opponents. -.-

So don't bother download, unless there is somekind of fix to that."
,Aevis,2010-06-22T23:17Z,Oh wait never mind. It wasn't this torrent after all ^^' So dunno about this one.
,rustymetalblade,2010-07-06T02:59Z,I got the game downloaded and installed and the SKIDROW files from the CD copied (except for Steamclient.dll for some reason it wont copy) but I get fatal errors saying I need steam to run the application. I've tried adding it to my steam account games list and I still get the error. Any help? I bet there's a way to fix it.
