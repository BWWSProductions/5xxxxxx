The game follows the story of Alex Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper) who wakes up on a morgue slab in the basement of GENTEK, a large and influential genetic engineering company based in Manhattan. Alex escapes and sets out to recover his memory and find out exactly what occurred. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful shapeshifting abilities that grant him superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, weaponry and the ability to "consume" people to gain their memories, skills and appearance. With no memory of his previous life, Alex is forced to track down and consume those related to the conspiracy in order to uncover the truth.
