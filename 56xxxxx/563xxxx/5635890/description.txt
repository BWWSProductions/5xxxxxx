Tool Academy's Chasyn Rance and Mickie Knuckles on Awesome Bomb Fight Radio!

This show had to be rescheduled to do rockin but it is finally here! You've seen him in Ring Of Honor, TNA and MLW... The NWA, AWA, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, FIP... All Star Wrestling in the UK... Stampede Wrestling in Canada and a hundred other wrestling federations throughout the world... but "Not Cocky" Chasyn Rance may best know for telling VH1's Tool Academy To Suck It last week on the season premier. If you want to know anything about Tool Academy, wrestling on the indies, developing a character that can make tools hate you in less than a day, bangin ring rats or anything else this is the show for you!

THEN THE most hardcore female wrestler in the world, The Queen Of The Deathmatch MICKIE KNUCKLES! She was known as Moose in TNA and made her name in IWA-MS in deathmatches as well as working in such awesome feds as Chikara, IWA East Coast, Chickfight, wXw Germany, Full Throttle Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Unplugged and CZW. We will find out what happened to her run in TNA, The horrible broken leg that forced her out of wrestling for a while, The status of IWA-MS, and whatever you guys bring up with Mickie!
