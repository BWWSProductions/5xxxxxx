Adobe Creative Suite 5 Master Collection Retail 4 DVD.

These are RETAIL DVDs of CS5 Master Collection, except that I've included Acrobat Pro Extended, instead of Pro, because it is better. Keygen is included, but its a false positive. Install instructions can be found inside the torrent. It updates as well - tried and tested. THESE ARE NOT UNTOUCHED, but they install and work just like the original, and they are RETAIL. This is not a repacked trial or an ESD version. Downloads will be pretty slow because of my internet connection, but I hope you get through it.
