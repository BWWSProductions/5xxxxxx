,hyper_2002,2010-06-16T11:35Z,"I am goin to check this... However as I remember very similat torrent was published on demonoid (the same size ~18GB) . 

Could you confirm that DVD3 is fully working with languages and extra content ?? (not like in shadyman release)..."
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-16T14:37Z,"Apparently, DVD3 ONLY has 32-bit support. It has no ""Extra content"" or ""Languages"". And I can confirm this is different from the Shadeyman release."
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-16T14:38Z,The Shadeyman release had a pre-release DVD3. This is the Retail DVD3.
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-16T14:45Z,"Extremely sorry for the confusion. Yes, this has the language packs and extra content. But I must warn everybody that this torrent DOES NOT include 32-bit support serials. I would appreciate it if someone posted the serial here, I'll give them credit by changing the description."
,hyper_2002,2010-06-16T15:51Z,"Started downloading , speed is very poor ~1.7kB/s - 10kB/s :) 

After 4 hours I am at 0.9% ;]"
,hyper_2002,2010-06-16T15:59Z,PS. What 'extra content' include ? :/
,wtfwtf222,2010-06-17T05:57Z,"sick man finally, gonna download this, if this works, thank you so much"
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-17T08:38Z,"Yes, I do admit download speed will be very slow. I'm the only seeder and I have only 256 kbps upload. But I can confirm this works."
,wtfwtf222,2010-06-17T16:11Z,"oh this is definitely gonna take a while lol. i'm seeding faster than i'm downloading, not a good sign"
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-17T18:18Z,"Okay, people, announcement. This has ONLY 32 bit support, not CONTENT. For that DVD, which is exactly the same as in production premium, I recommend you download DVD 3 of the production premium suite, it's not hard to find. I will shortly upload that as a separate DVD soon on TPB"
,wtfwtf222,2010-06-17T19:07Z,^ do not understand that lol. mind explaining what you mean? does it have EVERYTHING for 32 bit? or EVERYTHING for 64bit? O_O
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-18T06:24Z,"For 32 bit support, you need to install from the Support disk. But for the extra content that is supplied you'll have to wait a bit."
,hyper_2002,2010-06-18T10:51Z,"I give up, after 2 days I am stuck at 6.6%"

[V],thethingy,2010-06-22T19:13Z,"namyedahs, its little dicks like you that stop torrents being seeded for everyone ealse "
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-23T10:17Z,"Use any CS4 serials for 32-bit support. And ""Extra content"" is available as SEPARATE download from adobe's website, they aren't included on the disks."
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-23T10:18Z,if I could delete those comments I would :|
[V],thethingy,2010-06-23T14:29Z,"@people, the extra content is almost identicle to cs4 extra content (its just fonts and styles), cs4 extra content is here;
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5353064
you need some dll files for the 32bit support to function and you can get them in a small download with specific 32bit support instructions here;
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5592268
the 32bit support serials are;
1325-1849-6220-4528-4323-5526
1325-1482-1848-1020-7831-0546
and you install as a TRIAL then after put in the serials.

@people this is the RTM master clooection not some fake like the ""shadyman"" one :)"
,hameerabbasi,2010-06-23T17:38Z,"Naturally, I had to test before I put it up this time :P"
,LH-TAIMI,2010-06-27T20:51Z,"why is it 18 gb, when all is on only 6-8 gig :?"
,jscore,2010-06-29T17:13Z,"Is anyone else stuck at 99.6%???...still trying...seed seed. Once mine finishes I'll keep seeding, already seeded more then I've downloaded! Just hate to see this torrent die!"
,oliverdrn,2010-06-29T19:20Z,Please somebody seed! Been stuck at 99.6% for days now.
,breederuk,2010-06-29T23:27Z,The uploader - hameerabbasi has to seed. As there has been no completions. He hasn't seeded for several days now - making this torrent redundant. 
,breederuk,2010-06-30T03:51Z,"All those stuck at 99.6% - check the files completion. 

All the files should be completed except for the 32bit Support Disk. If you're running 64 bit version of Windows you have no need for it."
,oliverdrn,2010-07-01T02:39Z,"The 32-bit support disk is the only one I need, all the other files can be found in other torrents. Come on, hameerabbasi, come back!"
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-01T12:39Z,"Hehe... I am back. Extremely sorry for the off time. I was going on vacation and intended on leaving the PC on, but my stupid bro turned it off. Seeding now :)"
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-01T15:31Z,"@LH-TAIMI:
These are the RTM DVDs (Release to Manufacturing), not trail repacks. All the trial repacks have 6-8 GB in them. Torrents with 10 GB only have Disks 1 and 2, not Acrobat or 32 bit support."
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-01T20:25Z,Completely Seeded! You can now enjoy decent speeds :)
,pxpx,2010-07-02T07:59Z,68 seeders & no feedback? Basterds!
,sergetus,2010-07-02T15:53Z,HI! Does one know the password to unwar to the Keygenerator1_for_32support file?
,kpappa,2010-07-03T13:16Z,"What is the password for the ""Keygenerator1_for_32support.rar"" file ?"
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-04T07:32Z,Use any CS4 Master Collection Serials for 32-bit support. That file is useless. Install as TRIAL then enter the serial on first launch.
,oliverdrn,2010-07-08T06:57Z,"When I try to install the 32-bit support package, after I choose which components to install, it asks me to insert the ""CS5 ProdPrem MC"" disc and I can't continue. This happens when I mounted the 32-bit support disk using PowerISO and when I burned it to a DVD. Is anyone else running into this problem, and any ideas how I can get around it?"
,wtfwtf222,2010-07-09T02:49Z,why is this bigger if it is production premium?nhttp://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5649900/ADOBE_CREATIVE_SUITE_5_PRODUCTION_PREMIUM_%28retail%29_%5Bthethingy%5D
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-09T09:07Z,"I didn\'t run into that problem when I installed it. Try Daemon Tools. And, try mounting disk 1."
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-09T09:12Z,"Production premium is spread over 3 disks (DVD5), and one 32-bit support package. The 3 disk spread involves \""extra\"" data that makes it bigger than this master collection."
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-09T09:13Z,@oliverdrn:nnTry this torrent if all else fails:nhttp://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5565859/ADOBE_CS5_32_BIT_SUPPORT_PACKAGE_%5Bthethingy%5D
,oliverdrn,2010-07-09T10:55Z,Thanks hameerabbasi. I got it working after all. Seems like mounting with PowerISO or burning to DVD doesn\'t work for some reason. But I extracted the files and installed from my hard drive and that worked. Maybe Daemon Tools works better than PowerISO and that\'s why I was running into problems.
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-10T01:04Z,You\'re most welcome :)
,wtfwtf222,2010-07-10T02:27Z,i just thought mastercollection would be bigger than production premium LOLnbtw is there support package for 64 bit?
,hameerabbasi,2010-07-11T15:14Z,"There is no 64-bit support package as all 32 bit apps run on 64-bit, but some CS5 apps, such as Premiere CS5 and After Effects CS5, are 64-bit, so they need 64-bit Windows to run."
,slyphnier,2010-07-22T23:30Z,"i found out indeed retail CS5 consist 4 DVD
2Disc for CS5 installation
1Disc for Acrobat 9 Pro Extended

,4steve23,2010-07-23T22:35Z,It is not accepting any of the serials for the Acrobat Pro Extended... What am I doing wrong?
,slyphnier,2010-07-24T01:02Z,"@raizmup05
change the iso you mount on your software to Disk 2.iso

@4steve23
did you try using keygen ?"
,4steve23,2010-07-24T01:26Z,@slyphnier  - I used the Master Suite keygen and it didn't work... There was no Acrobat keygen... 
,slyphnier,2010-07-25T13:47Z,"@4steve23
try keygen the one from in this torrent (in your cs5 download folder), you should see keygen.exe "

,hameerabbasi,2010-08-25T11:56Z,"@meiam42: The 32-bit support disk is included. The extra content can be gotten from adobe as a free download, if you have a legit key.

@YAGOB: This is the RTM version of MC which, unfortunately, only has English."
,YAGOB,2010-08-25T21:05Z,"does that mean it dont work on Windows Vista?
if it work on Vista than all I need is the languge pack right? could you give me the Arabic languge suport pack"

If there is no host file in that folder, just create a new one and copy paste all the ""127.0.0.1 adobe"" things."

The torrent downloaded well, and I extracted Master Collection Disk 1 and Master Collection Disk 2 to different folders. (When I tried to extract Disk 2, it asked if I wanted to overwrite files, so I made a new folder.)

I hit the Set Up icon in the Disk 1 folder, and it starts installing.  Everything is going well until it asks for Disk 2.  I can't get it recognize where Disk 2 is.  There is nothing in the installation instructions dealing with this.  

Both ZIP packages extract to a Adobe CS5 folder, so I created a separate folder for Disk 2.  "
