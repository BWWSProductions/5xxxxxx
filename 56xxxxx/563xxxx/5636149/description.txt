Storytelling Giant was a 1988 compilation of ten music videos produced by Talking Heads during the 1980s. The videos are connected by random stories by real people. Stories included a person who was a dog for several years, a woman whose ex-boyfriend broke into her apartment, and people who trashed others' bathrooms at a party.

The film has been released on VHS and can be obtained from used video stores.

This is the 2003 DVD version available exclusively as part of Rhino's Once in a Lifetime box set.
