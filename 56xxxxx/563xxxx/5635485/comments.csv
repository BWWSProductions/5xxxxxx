Fakman, I don't know why it (the serial) doesn't work for you, but it has worked just fine for me twice since you posted your comment.  Are you remembering that you also need to use the given email address along with the serial?  Just a thought..
Thanks again bigwimpie!  It appears that we get first class uploads from you.  It is appreciated."
