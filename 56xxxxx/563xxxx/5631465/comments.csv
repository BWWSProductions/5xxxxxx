,sadstoner01,2010-10-02T23:01Z,"Only people who don't know what the fuck they're doing worry about trackers and RIAA etc.

Great torrent thnx much."
,sadstoner01,2010-10-02T23:02Z,"Only noobs worry about trackers...if you haven't set up something to stop this then your an idiot.

Great torrent. Thanks Much."
,buckaroo3,2010-10-05T21:09Z,I think its good of awebbie to let noobs know that this is being tracked. and maybe a suggestion of a program like btguard or torrentprivarcy would be helpful.
,DLS_M,2010-10-11T17:10Z,"Interesting. Why on earth would NBC be tracking downloads of this, when it's a **SYFY** channel production??  Moron..."
[H],politux,2010-10-11T20:18Z,NBC owns syfy.  LOL I love when idiots make themselves known.

,DSXC,2010-11-21T13:19Z,Since he said that it was incomplete in the torrent comments I think the only moron is the one who didn't read it first.
,FomaKin,2010-12-06T03:44Z,"Thank you XDave -
A good torrent, and dl's fast.

I doubt NBC is tracking this - if they saw how popular the torrents are, they wouldn't have canceled it. Some shows take a while to be great: Star Trek:TOS, Hill Street Blues, etc."
,dil182005,2010-12-15T23:21Z,sadstoner01 - How do I set up something to stop trackers and RIAA? I never heard of anything like this...thx
[V],matimike,2011-01-26T03:22Z,a/v 10 thanks
,darkscale,2011-03-12T15:14Z,"uhh, if you are only UL 9 episodes, then why say its the complete season?
To the others: uTorrent is safe enough as well if you use ipfilter.dat in documents & settings/[user name]\applications data\utorrent and make sure to switch on any security settings in the client as well."
,r08star,2011-04-02T16:12Z,"Oh how I pitty you sods who are afraid that big brother is watching. You probably only know how to download torrents (but it's a very hush hush thing), play on facebook, watch youtube, write some tweets, and further on like all Americans pay for each movie you download via your Apple machine. I pity you, and I despise you. I once bought  the original xbox, and I am not savvy if it comes to chip-modding, because you have to solder some things on your motherboard. Then I had a problem and asked the store that modded my xbox. The reply was: It is your Xbox. I am not your service desk.If you have a problem; there is a vast source of information. You go outside this store to the right. Walk about 15 minutes until you come to the library. Take the elevator to the 6th floor. Now, and this is very important, so pay attention, go to a computer, open the Internet Explorer, and type in the address bar: www.google.com. Once Google appears you can ask it any question you want.

In relation to the torrent uploaded here. In Holland we as a user have imunity: Downloading is not prohibited, uploading is (the reply that when you download with BitTorrent you automatically upload is so lame, that I won't even answer it with the reply: ever heard of settings?). Now you will say on private trackers you have to upload at least the same amount of data as you have downloaded. You are right!!! (good for you) But alas, even that is not needed if you use the right script. I will point you to the right direction: Google --> Freeleech uTorrrent. You won't even have to be tech savvy, and writing/reading scripts is not needed. Yeay, how far we have come! And this post just took me 5 minutes to write. If you would had hired me, those 5 minutes would had cost you â‚¬ 20,- So see this as a favour.

P.S. TOR, HideMyAss, and programs like that will also help hiding your IP. And if you learn how to SPAM, you can make someone else's computer your Robot. Do this to a lot of people and you'll be virtually untraceable
(BTW, that's another â‚¬10,- you owe me) :-D"
