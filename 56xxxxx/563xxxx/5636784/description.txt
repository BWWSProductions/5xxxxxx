Background and Production

The album was recorded, beginning in 2008, at Skywalker Studios, the studio owned by filmmaker George Lucas and was produced by Miller and Andy Johns.
The album features cover versions of songs by artists such as B.B. King, Lowell Fulson, Jimmy Reed, and Jimmie Vaughan.
Miller said of the album, "This is a party record, man. It's about getting up and getting ready to dance. It's like the fraternity party gigs I used to play in college. I went through and picked all my favorite tunes that I really, really loved. I wanted to make this record forever; it started off as just kind of a goof, and then it got real serious."
