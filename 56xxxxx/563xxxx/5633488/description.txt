Bibble 5 is a fast, flexible photographic workflow application. Bibble 5 is designed to help you optimize your digital photographic images and to help you organize and catalog those images. It allows you to adjust and optimize your images very quickly, and to batch adjust and convert these images to prints, send via email, share on the web or edit or view in other applications.
Bibble 5 provides three major categories of features: Asset Management, Image Editing, and Output Generation. Asset Management is the means to catalog your digital photographic
assets (called Master Files), view and add metadata to these assets, and search and browse based on that metadata. As your volume of digital photographs grows from hundreds to thousands of images, maintaining a coherent and organized library of those photographs becomes quite critical. Bibble 5 provides all the tools needed to catalog your current photographs, to search and to browse through those catalogs quickly and efficiently.

Image Adjustment & Optimizing is the process of applying color management and correction, exposure adjustment, and other creative image editing tools to your original photographs, enabling you to optimize your photographs in the least amount of time. Bibble 5 offers image adjustment tools that operate on entire images (like exposure compensation or white balance) and also offers Selective Editing to allow you to adjust regions or smaller portions of your images.

Output Generation will take the previews you see in Bibble and create new image files that you can print, share on the web, and access in other applications. Bibble 5's powerful Batch Conversion system helps automate this process.
