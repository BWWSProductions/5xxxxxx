Verlagshaus Braun Publishing | ISBN: 393878010X | 2007 | PDF | 1024 pages

This is the most comprehensive, authoritative and up-to-date compendium of contemporary European architecture available in one single volume. Projects from all parts of the continent have been selected to create a representative overview of the latest European architecture. The great variety of European architecture is guaranteed because there is only one project presented per architect with high-quality pictures and plans. Particular emphasis has been placed on making sure that many small creative and surprising buildings are presented alongside more familiar projects.
