http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1472209/

Ian decides to purposely lose his cell phone in hopes that the girl of his dreams will pick it up and call him. As a result he meets Jill, yet the feelings are not mutual, and obsession with the rejection draws out a love note never given to a high school crush. While this occurs, Shery, a novelty newspaper creator, deals with a recovering drug user turned tattoo addict who wants his story printed.
