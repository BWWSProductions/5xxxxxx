,aviator21,2010-06-20T21:22Z,"Another comment just to keep people informed, since I'm a nice guy and don't want anyone getting pissed. Right now it's raining hard and I just lost power, so anyone wondering why I'm not seeding or why the seeding isn't going very fast, that's why. I'm having a hard time getting to any web pages so I think the internet company may be having problems, too. Don't worry, though, because when this passes I'll continue to seed, and everyone that has seeded already, please continue to do so to help me out! Thanks for your help and understanding."
,aviator21,2010-06-23T23:15Z,"Now that there are more seeders, enjoy the download! Please comment about the quality, etc and as promised, I'll keep seeding until there are yet a few more to keep it alive."
,Pathos675,2010-10-04T20:50Z,Not widescreen. Lame
,fdiazr,2010-12-21T16:20Z,I'm gonna try to download. Thanks
,piratemm,2010-12-24T22:02Z,Been looking for this for ages!  Thanks heaps for putting this up Aviator!
,hawkins555,2011-02-01T00:02Z,"Starting download, seems to be  slow download, but hey, lets see what happens, Thx Aviator21!!"
,aviator21,2011-02-04T21:55Z,"@Pathos675, no, this is not widescreen, though my son didn't care if it was or not. I'll change the title of the torrent to inform people of this.

@fdiazr, Best of luck with the download.

@piratemm, I also had the same problem with not finding a quality ""Cars"" torrent to replace the DVD. Hope this will help.

@hawkins555, sorry for the slow download, however I am no longer seeding this at the moment, so it must be someone else's connection or another problem. If I can find it again on my harddrive, I will be more than happy to continue seeding this along with the others. Thanks for downloading."
,Hllrazr1,2011-02-12T01:51Z,"Couls someone please seed, would like for my son to have both movies as he just got part 2 without seeing the first one.

Thanks again"
,SiljeMari,2011-02-22T02:41Z,"Great torrent!
But isn't it possible to change the language?
If not, does anyone know where I could find the British version, where Jeremy Clarkson is the voice of Harv? :)"
,KNichols,2011-03-01T16:32Z,need help how too burn this dvd email me kaylon.nichols@gmail.com my son has also played his out lol pls help
,connie111,2011-04-18T05:58Z,Thank you so much for this. My little guy is going to love it!!
,Vallenb,2011-04-24T22:52Z,"Thanks, and I like the picture you put in there, bootleged hahaha"
,D7Creations,2011-05-25T00:18Z,"Not bad for your first torrent!  One suggestion though...  if you could put future torrents in a mkv file that would be great.  What is 4gb could be only about 700mb with the same quality.  Other than that, Thanks!"
,IVAN_VIII,2011-10-11T16:20Z,lol
