Evangelion 1.0 You Are Not Alone

Same as http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4164704
but with bonus edited subtitle!

----

Just for fun, I've included my edit of the script.

To switch to it, rename the first .srt file to (original).srt, and then
remove the (edit) tag from the second. VLC will pick up the .srt file
with the same name as the .mkv alongside it.

The edit isn't a better translation of the Japanese audio, but rather a
creative attempt at an improved rewrite in just a few areas. So, this
experiment won't work very well if you speak Japanese. I tried to smooth
dialog in a few places, and make the tech heavier and sound more real.

I hope you like it!

Also, it corrects the BALLS problem identified below.

This is perfect, high quality, English subs and a fast DL (currently)
If you like Eva you most definitely need to see this. 

Nitpicking: The translations are a little off in some places, especially when it randomly says BALLS for several minutes lol. The preview of the next movie after the credits isn't subbed.
