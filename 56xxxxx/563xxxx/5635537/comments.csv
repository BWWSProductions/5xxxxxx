,Markowweraw,2010-06-19T17:02Z,im downloading the patch right now... but i have a question... is there serbia in this?...
,Rokrdude,2010-06-19T17:33Z,"Of course serbia is as they qualified

Even teams who played the qualifiers and didn't qualify for the finals are also there in the patch"
,Markowweraw,2010-06-19T20:24Z,"i have the same problem... when i start the game and when it says press anybutton to continue as soon as i press something it crashed, i cant play... please help!"
,flamemc1,2010-06-19T21:18Z,"Can i ask, what is this exactly, i guess its just a mod pack for fifa 10, is this going to be the same as fifa 10 world cup on the console, will the comentry still be there, is it still set up to use the controller? basically is it worth patching the game to find out it makes the game worse."
,Rokrdude,2010-06-19T21:29Z,"@Markowweraw 

What type of operating system you have?
If it is 64 bit did you use the bug fixes



@ flamemc1

It is a pretty good patch and yes commentary is there and controller works perfectly with the patch

Just no online lan play(hamachi) after the patch"
,flamemc1,2010-06-20T03:46Z,"Ok, its not too bad, good work to the coders on this one.  Theres a few problems nothing major, be a pro dosnt seem to work, crash to deskop, but everthing else is ok, shame EA couldnt of done this, shame they didnt want to waste there time and money with us measly pc gamers. anyways a big thanks to the uploader for this good find."
,Markowweraw,2010-06-20T04:57Z,im running a  32 bit...
,Rokrdude,2010-06-20T05:37Z,"@Markowweraw  
Did you replace the original fifa.db. with the downloaded one in WC 10 folder/data/cmn

If you did so I can only suggest you too delete the world cup folder and reinstall(reextract)"
,anamynous,2010-06-21T03:24Z,"I'm confused on what step 3 is telling me to do.

3)Enter on it's folder, and make sure you create a shortcut to ""2010 FIFA WORLD CUP Launcher"".

Can someone tell me what ""enter on it's folder"" means?"
,Rokrdude,2010-06-21T05:27Z,"@anamynous 

Its the world cup folder you extracted in step 2
the step is basically creating a shortcut for world cup launcher.exe file to your desktop"

,DaChosen1,2010-07-05T12:55Z,"it shure does work without the original game FIFA 10 installed, i wonder why they say that you need the original game.....
I just downloaded this one, extracted and made a shortcut and copied the WCSA 10 folder to my documents. Then did the reg thing and it worked for me... with no original FIFA game installed"
,Loekkiee,2010-07-08T00:09Z,"Can someone tell me what fifa db. is? My English isn't very well, especially the shortcuts and stuff.."
,Loekkiee,2010-07-08T00:24Z,"I did all the things, 1 to 6. I launch the game with 2010 FIFA WORLD CUP LAUNCHER and the main menu comes. This is a little screen with ""Start"" and ""Rebuild Fat"". Also, the letters in top of this menu and the World Cup 2010 SA sign at the left are shining through. I can see my desktop through them. Whatever.. When I play ""Start"", nothing happens. I can click it a thousand times but it still won't work.

Sorry for my bad English, I hope you understood this whole story and maybe someone can help me!"

,schomke23,2010-09-24T13:28Z,"FIFA10 is NOT NEEDED!!!!

1. Extract files
2. Create desktop schortcut for 2010FIFA WORLD CUP Launcher
3. Cut WCSA10 folder and paste in MyDocuments folder
4. go to Bug fixes folder and copy fifa.db to ..\Fifa 10 World Cup 2010 Patch\2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\data\cmn folder
5. run WC.reg file (Bug fixes folder)
6. DO NOT USE locale.ini to set resolution, better way is to do that in game settings

Enjoy!!!"
