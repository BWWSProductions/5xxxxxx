This is a patch that can be applied to fifa 10 which lets you play the world cup with your favourite teams right from qualification round

Also you can't play fifa online on hamachi or direct ip after you apply this patch


Installation
[B](FIFA 10 PC Is Needed !)[/B]

1) Extract the game on your desired path, but not on the same folder with FIFA 10.

2) Replace the original fifa db. with the one given in bug fixes folder in WC 10 folder/data/cmn

3)Enter on it's folder, and make sure you create a shortcut to "2010 FIFA WORLD CUP Launcher".

6)You'll also find a folder called "WCSA 10" there.Move it to "My Documents" folder, located in your Windows partition.
Open the game using "2010 FIFA WORLD CUP LAUNCHER" Start button !

DON'T START THE GAME WITH WCSA10, because the game won't work properly (you can't exit, unless you close the game from Processes).
Also, don't forget to avoid alt-tabbing the game while playing, because:
-if you alt - tab the game in the menus, some stadium turfs won't be displayed correctly
-if you alt - tab the game while playing a match, an "Send Error Report" / "Don't Send" error will appear, you being forced to exit the game.

7)If you have Windows Vista or windows 64 bit 
Copy wc.reg file from bug fix folder and paste it in world cup folder replacing previous wc.reg file.
Then click the reg file now it will work

Do you live in Romania and you must see the real thing on TVR HD ? In the brand new WC game you can manage your team better than Lucescu and fight for playing on Durban in the real qualifying fixtures stage.


[B]Known Issues.[/B]

We have added a lot of FIFA 10 improvements in the World Cup game, and the result is a magnificent product, but being just modders, and not professional programmers, we also have a few issues we already know about, that, unfortunately, cannot be fixed by us:
â€¢ the soundtrack is working only before playing the first match, after that it's unplayable, being a limitation of audio.big file while editing the soundtrack & the song names.
â€¢ if you load the game dirrectly from "WCSA10.exe" you won't be able to exit it, because our all new launcher developed from the scratch has a problem, blocking "Exit to Windows" function.Also, it seems like the "Alt + F4" combo only freezes the game.You can still exit from the game using "Ctrl + Alt + Delete" and closing it searching in the list of your software processes.
That's why we recommend you to open the game from the launcher.It activates a function set to "F12" which is automatically closing the game while being pressed, at any time, so you can use it as an "Alt + F4" function.
â€¢ due to some incompatibilities we've met, the game won't features team anthems, at least not at moment.If we'll be able to fix them, we'll release a game update with them later.
â€¢ rarely, you will notice that the commentators are triggering some samples regarding WC at the beginning of the match on lower volume.We've had not to increase the volume of a few samples, because otherwhise the commentary wouldn't work anymore.Fair enough, because usually you'll hear very well the two commentators speeches regarding World Cup.
â€¢ in FIFA PC database you can assign everytime only one stadium to a team.That means that if you assign "Moses Mabhida - Durban" stadium to Spain, that team will also play qualification matches on Durban, and not on Bernabeu.We decided to assign World Cup Stadiums for Qualified teams because the mode is based on the final tournament.
You can still change your teams stadiums using Creation Master 10.For example, if you wanna play qualifications stages with Spain, you can assign Bernabeu as they home Stadium in Qualifications stage period, and when you begin the final World Cup tournament, using the same Creation Master 10, assigning of the licensed World Cup stadiums to the same Spain team.
â€¢ sometimes the "Replay" stutters very bad 
â€¢ since we implemented the new console World Cup 10 menu style, the stadiums GUI has dissapeared, being replaced with a simple "Black" colour.Joking a bit, it's not a big problem, now you can enjoy at maximum the team logos quality.
â€¢ if you create another game profile, the mode will crash automatically
Even so, we still think you'll find in our game an enjoyable recreation of the real 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa tourney.
