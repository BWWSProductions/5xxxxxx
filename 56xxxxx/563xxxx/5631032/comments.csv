,michaelrwatson,2011-06-30T03:13Z,"You DUMBFUCK. These subs are for the WHOLE MOVIE whereas they *should* be only for the non-English parts. 

A ?
V ?
Subs 0"
,rrpostal,2011-12-07T17:37Z,"When you complain and cry like an infant over stupid things it really just makes you look bad and not the uploader. Just because you only wanted subs for some parts of the movie, it doesn't mean they ""should"" be this way. It just means you preferred something else. And the only way someone would give this video quality a 5 is if they had unrealistic expectations for something this size or they are playing it in a betmax. Likewise, the audio is not high quality, but a ""1"" says more about the commenter than the actual quality. 
Realistically 
V-9 {outstanding for the size) 
A-6 
Another great download that does exactly what it says. Sorry for the rant."
,kill1192,2012-01-25T20:43Z,@OrderX Then why the fuck did u download it??? If you want better video then go search for it.... Or DO IT YOURSELF BITCH.... Stop bein a dick... If you cant appreciate the uploader's work then keep it to yourself... Don insult them just because YOU don't have the balls to upload something of your own...
