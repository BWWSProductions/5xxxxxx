,haxuh,2010-09-04T04:13Z,"This upload doesn't work possibly because the instructions in the README tell you to put files that you DON'T even get from this torrent in your PSP folders.

So an analogy: this torrent tells you to put the squares and triangles in the PSP but they only give you the triangles."
,tXracer,2010-12-19T06:13Z,"dude! wtf is this? has ur account been banned? it says ""this content cannot be accessed on your account""...what country r u in?"
,tXracer,2010-12-19T06:16Z,"all the files are fine in this torrent, he just made some mistakes...the game will not work unless u edit the eboot.pbp and its a long and boring proccess...so just forget about making it work"
