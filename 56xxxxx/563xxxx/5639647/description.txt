Christine Ohlman was a founding member of The Scratch Band when Fancy evolved into that 
band's incarnation, a seven-member unit which later pared down to five. The Scratch Band, 
including members G. E. Smith and Mickey Curry, were noted throughout the Northeast for their 
incendiary live shows. The band released two LP's: the first was picked up by Decca and EMI 
worldwide, with Christine's stark piano-accompanied version of Dusty Springfield's "I Only 
Want To Be With You" becoming a turntable hit in the U.K. The Scratch Band parted in the early 
eighties, and lead vocalist Christine Ohlman embarked on a solo career under Trod Nossel's 
management and production company. She later reunited with both Smith and fellow Scratch Band member 
Paul Ossala when she joined the Saturday Night Live (SNL) Band for the 1991-1992 season.
