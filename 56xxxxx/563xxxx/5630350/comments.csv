,keblarman,2011-01-11T02:21Z,Check your processor consumes as when playing the movie. If it consumes 100% then you processor is the problem. You have to change processors with a higher power.
,Atsaluum,2011-01-12T21:11Z,@keblarman: If you were referring to my posts I don't think this is a matter of prosessing power at all. I'm normally able to play 4-5 high bitrate 1080p video files with my cpu alone flawlessly. Add a 5000-series Radeon to that and it certainly is not an issue of sufficient resources. You have to remember were living a year 2011 and even netbooks are starting to have enough hp to run 1080p.
,keblarman,2011-01-17T21:09Z,"Yes i refer to your posts I see no other... look was a suggestion, and all that know me, but NOT EVERYONE has the hardware (I donâ€™t know if you live in the real world 2011). When making a critique must be supported by argument and you did not. You should specify your hardware. Many occasions it could."
,Atsaluum,2011-01-18T20:43Z,"If I say that it seems that the video file is suffering from off-sync issues, that clearly includes the argument right there. If not, then I don't how to present one for you besides my visual and cognitive perception of that event.

And after all I did reply to my own posting by saying that remuxing the file with no compression option seemed to fix it for me, as there was a clear difference playing the remuxed file compared to the original concerning the evenly surfacing off-sync issues.  And I do remember other people writing off of the off-sync issues as well until the post(s) were removed for some reason. So I can't see the reason why to get all jammed up about my post.

And like I said and I'm saying it again, I appreciate the uploading effort, especially after the release turned out to be alright."
