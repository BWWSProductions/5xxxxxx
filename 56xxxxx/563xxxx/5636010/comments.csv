that all worked fine but when i go play it, it starts with some opeing videos and then suddenly closes!
please i has no clue why it does that."
,zjohn4,2010-09-19T04:37Z,"hey its me again. sorry about the previous comment. i found that all i had to do was disable anti-aliasing and it worked perfectly. thank you so much, thenoobish!"
,claymorekid,2011-01-18T22:53Z,How did you disable anti-aliasing?
,Voroshilov,2011-03-03T11:06Z,"I've installed it perfectly on my laptop, yet when I launch the intro is really messed up with bright coloured pixels, it got stucked and then bluescreen and I had to turn off the laptop

My graphic card is Mobile Intel 4 Series Express Chipset, OS WinXP 32x... Most likely my card is the problem (cant find the disable anti-aliasing feature). Any suggestions are welcome, in any case I've still got the torrent so will be seeding it soon."
,zjohn4,2011-04-17T08:05Z,"@claymorekid :
Configuration files i think. I haven't played for a long time so i dont remember"
