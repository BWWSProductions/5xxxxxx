,stillcd,2011-07-09T06:17Z,"So... After you copy and paste the contents of the Pro Apps folder into the appropriate location, are you supposed to click the  in the upper left corner and do a software update? I just wanted to make sure before I screw anything up. Thanks"

,tokostudio,2011-07-24T10:27Z,"Amazing, thanks!

I installed OS X Lion, and my old 9.0.0 copy wouldn't even run.

So I updated via System Update to 9.1.4, and then it asked me for a serial

After replacing the files, it booted up just fine!"

,hiadro,2011-07-26T14:27Z,"@tokostudio:

I have the same problem, but I can ´t seem to find my ProApps folder. I´ve seen in both my HD Volume and my User-folder under Application Support, but there´s no ProApps folder there. 

Just wanna make sure if its not in any other folder now with Lion and 9.1.4 or something, before I reinstall it all. "
