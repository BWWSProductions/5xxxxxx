,i11hkyplayer,2010-06-22T02:33Z,"I'm a little worried about the PC version, its selling for under $40. Knock on wood but i think it could end up being a crappy half ass version. :("
,farphignougen,2010-06-23T01:51Z,"I'm pretty certain the PC version is identical to the 360 and PS3 versions.  The Wii game is completely different, but that's been floating around the scene for days.  Has PC piracy become so ubiquitous that no one bothers with it anymore?"
