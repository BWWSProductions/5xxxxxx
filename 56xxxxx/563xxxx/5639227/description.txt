Desc: Two idiots are beaten senseless by a group of
bodyguards at a brothel. They take refuge in a ruined
temple where they meet Old Monster Lu, a peculiar old
man and master of "Back Kung Fu." The two fools
become his students, but with their training only 
half complete, they make the dangerous decision to
return to town and face their enemies.	

Notes: The 3rd of the 9 bootleg kungfu dubs. I found
these in an old box of VHS tapes cleaning up my 
basement. If you're into poorly dubbed wacko kungfu
movies, where a punch makes a high snapping noise,
and lip movements don't match the dialog, these are
for you. If you know the original movie, please 
enlighten the rest of us.
