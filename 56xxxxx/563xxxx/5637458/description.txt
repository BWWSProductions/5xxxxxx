This is a mixed bag of enchanting music and cuts only a collector could love. Pretty much all -- and all the best -- material is instrumental, with gems ranging from charming Venezuelan-influenced string-band to a superb piano solo by George Cabral. The preceding spate of reissues has swept up most of the treasures already, though The Lion is on form. ~ John Storm Roberts, Original Music
