Mike Thomson investigates claims that senior officials from
the Swiss police allowed Germans to travel to Argentina on
KLM flights without the correct paperwork. 

Records from the time reveal that in 1948 a representative
of KLM asked Swiss police to ease travel restrictions for
Germans travelling to Argentina without proper paperwork.

KLM still refuses to facilitate an independent enquiry.
