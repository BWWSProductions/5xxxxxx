,AshVal,2010-07-24T21:19Z,"Thank youuu. 
finally, not a freaking virus.
The only problem with this is that there's NO specific instruction that comes with it.

I didn't have to burn or mount anything.

It's veryyyy simple.

- Unzip,
- Run the Tomb Raider Anniversary Setup

- Go to program files (go the folder where Tomb Raider Anniversary was just installed ""Tomb Raider - Anniversary"") & replace the TRA application file with the one in the HATRED folder that you unzipped.

and run the game!
It runs smooth with no problems. Thanks again! :D"

,MaxMouseG,2010-09-18T01:13Z,"This is my first Tomb Raider Game and I'm glad I beaten this game because I ain't playing no damn more no sequels either... Story is lame to me ....button pressing action cutscenes are too easy and can't complete with Resident Evil 4/5 cutscenes It's even pointless to even have weapons in this game because you are doing like 2 to 3 puzzles before you fight 1 or 2 weak ass monsters and then do 2 to 3 more puzzles.. but I'm sure the whole point of this game is staring at Lara's Ass,legs and tits, including water all over her. Well to be honest if you like Exploring Eygpt and hidden mystery and stuff like that then this game is for you."

It's pretty stupid to base your entire opinion of the series when you've only played the 8th one made."

MORE DETAILED INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

1. mount iso with Magic Disk(burn iso if you wsh).
(magic disk is a cd/dvd emulator software It is free to download google it)

2. Install the game.

3. Copy the 2 items from the Hatred folder & paste + replace. Location to paste here: C:Program FilesTomb Raider - Anniversary

Inside the ISO file you will see a folder named Hatred. Open that. Copy and paste  the 2 files to where you installed your pc game
Generally here  C:Program FilesTomb Raider - Anniversary.

Replace the 2 files when you are asked.
Unmount the ISo. Enjoy the game.

Personally tested for 2 weeks and got through half the game in my spare time. I forgot if it supported my controller, but I think yes.

,bic.ecstasy,2012-01-20T07:50Z,"@GWpirateGW
Thanks from all the people who know and love this game! I only copied the instruction file this time, I have had a full copy for many years. This game is a great remake of a classic. The first Tomb Raider game broke grounds in the video game industry when it was released and when I first played Anniversary, I was even more immersed in the world around me than I was in the first. Damn good game.
In fact, I finally registered a pirate account just so that I could give GWpirateGW some props for the upload. Thax dude!  :-)"
,AgentVance,2012-04-13T20:10Z,The game crashes after the intro scene. I have tried everything I can think of. My driver is up to date. I have tried a no intro patch and yet it still crashes. I have tried running it as admin before and after I installed the no intro patch. Nothing seems to work. If someone can help me it would be appreciated. If not then well the dl sucks ass.
,Jet_le_pirate,2012-05-03T12:22Z,"works perfectly, thankyou!"
,HHT,2012-05-22T10:43Z,Thanks :)
,bayshafe,2012-06-09T14:23Z,Works great! Can work with windows 7!
