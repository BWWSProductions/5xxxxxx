,blakkmask,2011-06-11T15:48Z,[For all the people who don't know how to use the patch] maybe those people who do know should stop insulting others and start posting the instruction...team work.
,minlian,2011-06-30T12:29Z,blacktroy can you find the latest sothink movie dvd maker 3.7 with the patch?
,csparkles93,2011-07-15T03:59Z,"To get the patch to work basically you extract the files via 7-zip or similar software. Firstly you run the setup.exe and follow the instructions. After the installation is complete close the program. Then copy the Patch.exe and go to My computer/(c:)/program files/Sourcetec/sothink movie dvd maker, then paste the file in that folder and run it. This should make the software work. Hope this helps."
,unispirit,2011-09-16T15:07Z,And of course some asshole had to register the patch so it doesn't work for the rest of us. Thanks a lot...
