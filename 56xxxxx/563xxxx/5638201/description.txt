In my country average user of wireless network pays 1 MB 0.89 cents. At first sight, it doesn't look too much, right? But, let remind ourselves that ONE XviD is 350 MB - he costs 350x0.089 = 31.15 US dollars.
User of standard DSL connection pays 1 MB 0.03 cents. It looks 'almost' as for free
- now ONE XviD of 350 MB costs "just" 1.05 US bucks.

Past month friend of mine from Africa wrote that he pays 5.4 US bucks for 350 MB episode.
We all think that people from Arab countries are oil-rich and therefore enjoy all modern miracles - for free. LOL, truth cannot be further, they pay 7.8 US dollars for 350 MB and have been subdued to unimaginable restrictions.
I live in Europe - just in case you were wondering.

In same time German user pay 3 times less than me, average US user 8 times less, Scandinavians 9 times less and Japanese users - 13 times less than myself. TIMES!
These are the official results of National Consumers Association pool done in February.
My encodings are approximately 3 TIMES SMALLER than XviD releases, but - they are NOT 3 times worse, right? 10-20% sounds about right.
Frame height is just 10% smaller than XviD in case of TV shows (32 pixels), 
unnoticeable when resized and watched from proper distance.
Small-sized H264 is, of course, to some extension and on some playback systems inferior-looking (only because people cannot/wont/refuse to make some changes)
- but this is so called 'trade-off', as any other balancing compromise every human being has to do millions of times, without questions about.

Now, read carefully words and numbers above and try to think about my work from new perspective.
