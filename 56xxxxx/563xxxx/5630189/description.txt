[show description from the Infowars web site]

Prison Planet editor Paul Joseph Watson sits in for Alex for the first hour of today's show to discuss the Bob Etheridge controversy, the ongoing BP oil spill and the new war propaganda surrounding the "discovery" of mineral deposits in Afghanistan. Other guests include Bill Murphy [hour 2], a financial commentator and founder of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee, top editorial photographer Dan Winters [hour 3], and former New Jersey Superior Court Judge and political and legal analyst for Fox News Channel, Andrew Napolitano [hour 4].



NOTE :: As with yesterday's show Paul Joseph Watson fills in during the 1st hour as guest-host for Alex [who is "out of town working on a project"].
Only the first hour is live.  The other three hours consist of previously broadcast interviews with the people listed above.
Bob Chapman is on during the first 5 minutes of hour 3.
Ted Anderson -- owner of GCN Radio Network -- breaks in at the end of hour 2 to do a live 5 minute commercial for his gold business, Midas Resources.
LIke yesterday, the audio quality of the last three hours was less than great.

Alex is supposed to be back tomorrow: Wednesday, June 16th.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
