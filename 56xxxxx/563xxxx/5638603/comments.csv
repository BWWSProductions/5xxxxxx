,redmadman3000,2010-06-20T01:15Z,Why does it say HDTV if the screenshot image says that the resolution is 624X352
,docmatrix,2010-06-20T02:27Z,"@redmadman3000: Because anything over 352x240 (NTSC) is technically ""high def."""

,ezboard,2010-06-26T20:16Z,upload the season finale!
,thevoidzero,2010-06-26T21:55Z,"Yes, very nice. However please stop calling them 2005. We are speaking about the Doctor! so it makes no sense to follow any timeline. I understand the reason but it's bogus. You will even notice in this episode that we are in 2010... watch the date that is named somewhere.

Thanks."
