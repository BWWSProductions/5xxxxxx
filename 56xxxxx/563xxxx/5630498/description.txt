For those who want to make great videos, but don't have a full-scale video editing application, Photoshop CS4 Extended can save the day. In Photoshop CS4 Extended for Video, Chad Perkins shows how Photoshop can be integrated into a video development process. Chad applies his video production know-how to the software's feature set in order to complete intermediate and advanced video tasks, including working with 3D objects and making slip edits. He also presents a real-world project demonstrating the popular technique of isolating and animating the components of a still image. Exercise files accompany this course.
Topics include:

    * Setting and editing start and end times for video
    * Applying filters to an entire video clip, or just a single frame
    * Removing objects using stack modes and cloning tools
    * Creating 2D cel animation
    * Cutting up and animating a photo in a final project
    * Working with After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Adobe Encore



All files uncompressed except exercice files.
