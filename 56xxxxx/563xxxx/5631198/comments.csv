[T],thelad53,2010-06-16T12:24Z,Is it Dubbed ?? I though the violent shit series was in German language ?
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-06-16T12:39Z,"First 3 I believe are in Geman, but this is in English - its not dubbed! IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309916/"
[T],thelad53,2010-06-16T13:07Z,"Oki, well i've got the other 3 so i'll up them later or tomorrow."
