There was an album released (media casette format) back in end of 1994 in Lithuania, Russia and perhaps other eastern European countries entitled "Mo-Do - Eins, zwei, policei" (note the C in policei, not Z). I think this album was not officially released since it is not mentioned in any articles regarding Mo-Do (for instance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo-Do).

After doing some research in 2007 I found out that on that very casette the only song which is truly made by Mo-Do is the "Eins, zwei, polizei" (original mix and polizei mix) and the remaining songs are done by absolutely different artists whom were given no credit on the MC's cover.

Since then I searched the internet every now and then in order to identify the true artists who made the remaining songs and I finally succeeded yesterday. I've managed to download most of these songs and release what happens to be a "compilation-album". Though I was unable to find a correct mix of one song and did not find a decent quality of another song. All other songs have pretty decent quality.

Please, if any of you happen to have these songs in a lossless or better mp3 quality format then I've uploaded, I beg you to PM me and share it!

In this torrent I've included the whole album which is a MC-rip of the original casette that I've bought in 1994 with songs named as they were on the casette cover AND I've included the whole album (minus two songs which I couldn't find in acceptable quality) which I downloaded from various sources AND I included two bonus songs which are mixes of songs included in the album. I've also included two covers of MC casettes and some additional photos of the MC.
