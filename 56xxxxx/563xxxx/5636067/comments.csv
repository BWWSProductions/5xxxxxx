[V],rambam1776,2010-06-19T19:34Z,"s04e01- ""We're Having a Heat Wave"" - Archie and next-door neighbor Henry Jefferson finally agree on something: They want to keep other ethnic groups out of the neighborhood. They disagree - and predictably, quarrel - about how to proceed.

    * Note: Episode features the first appearances of Betty Garrett as Irene Lorenzo and Vincent Gardenia as Frank Lorenzo."
