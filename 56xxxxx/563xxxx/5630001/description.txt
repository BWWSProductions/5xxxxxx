-------------------------------------------------
Sunfish got together in the summer of `93, in Sydney, Nova Scotia-Cape Breton.
 Its music is rooted in the folk tradition of the singer-songwriter but presented in the context of a rock band.
 And the songs are about `something'. Repeated listenings don't wear you out, they draw you in.....
