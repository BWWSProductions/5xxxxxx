From Wikipedia: "Fields of the Nephilim is a gothic rock band formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire in 1984. The original line-up consisted of vocalist Carl McCoy, saxophonist Gary Whisker, Tony Pettitt on bass, guitarist Paul Wright and drummer Andrew "Nod" Wright. Following the release of the debut EP Burning the Fields, Whisker left the band to be replaced by Peter Yates as second guitarist. The band's name refers to (magnetic) fields and a biblical race of giants or Angel/Human hybrids, known as the Nephilim. Although they never received substantial mainstream success, the band's seminal sound proved highly influential, especially on the genres of goth rock and gothic metal."
This DVD compiles all official video footage from The Fields' history. Two whole live videos in the form of Forever Remain (1988) and Visionary Heads (1991) along with all their music videos, and the music videos from Nefilim and Rubicon. It seems a lot of care went into making the package. The sound and image are great, and looks like it was taken from the original masters and cleaned up. The live performances are amazing and carry quite the atmosphere the band is known for. This is pretty much essential for die hards (as if the Fields have any other kind of fan) and for people just interested in the band. This is definitely one of, if not the best, band videos I've ever come across. This is sanctioned by McCoy and the band. Definitely nowhere near anything resembling a shoddy bootleg.
