Hugo Emil AlfvÃ©n (May 1, 1872 â€“ May 8, 1960) was a Swedish composer, conductor, violinist, and painter. AlfvÃ©n became known as one of Sweden's principal composers of his time, together with his contemporary Wilhelm Stenhammar.
AlfvÃ©n's music is in a late-Romantic idiom. His orchestration is skillful and colorful, reminiscent of that of Richard Strauss. Like Strauss, AlfvÃ©n wrote a considerable amount of program music. Some of AlfvÃ©n's music evokes the landscape of Sweden.

Among his works are a large number of pieces for male voice choir, five symphonies and three orchestral "Swedish Rhapsodies." The first of these rhapsodies, Midsommarvaka (Midsummer vigil) is his best known piece.
