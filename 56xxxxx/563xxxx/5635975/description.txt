Mike Levy live on Awesome Bomb Fight Radio!

The object of one of the worst shoot beatings in the history of wrestling and still alive and kickin to tell about it The White Lion, The Misfit... He is Mike Levy. Calling from out in Milestone Wrestling country in North Carolina we are gonna get his reaction from some previous interviews we have done with others involved about what happened that day and hear about how his wrestling career and notoriety have progressed since.

Violence Jack and Sensei will also have stories of rockin with the true wrestling superstars over the last weekend as the Legends of Wrestling Fanfest hit St Louis and your heroes hit the casino and hotel with a few names to be mentioned later that still know how to party and keep it real.

plus Mr California, 60 Seconds with K Ross Kovington and any other controversy we can uncover

THE MIKE LEVEY INCIDENT!
Soupbone666 put CZW in the titles but it was actually IWA-MS so we already know.
No comments from nerds please. Drink a beer and lighten up. This IS NOT for the timid. It is a REAL, DISTURBING, HARDCORE BEATING!
