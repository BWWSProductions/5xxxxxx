Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good! is the debut album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. It was originally released in 1985 on Combat Records. The album received positive reviews, even from mainstream music critics. The deluxe edition, completely remixed and remastered and featuring a new cover and several bonus tracks, was released by Loud Records in 2002.

According to "National Album Positioning Charts," Killing is My Business...And Business is Good! sold 189,230 albums worldwide.

The album's artwork, featuring a plastic skull with tinfoil, was not intended to be the original artwork. Both Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson had many phone conversation with Combat records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own and improvised the low-budget replacement, which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified with..

"These Boots" was on the original pressing of the album, but deleted from subsequent pressings due to legal issues with the song's writer, Lee Hazlewood. It was later added back onto the 2002 remaster, albeit with edit beeps everywhere a lyric change was made.
