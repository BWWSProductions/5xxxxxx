,believenu,2010-06-20T05:09Z,question? I d/l toy.story from you yest. but can't find today to make note on quality which is fine but it is not there . should I continue seeding?what happened?
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-20T07:22Z,"believenu: Thanks, but you should stop to seed that one. Torrent was spammed for five times, starting with link to commercial site (Direct/on-line-watching) with purpose to attract people and collect their Internet addresses.
Few regular members objected - but midget has even replied - three times!!!

I intervened. Said what should be said.

Spamming-troll called me CRAZY.

Well, I deleted the torrent then, pure and simple.

I gave SIX HOURS TO MODERATORS to intervene and to remove the link to external .com site - but what happened is obvious from the outcome.

First CAM of ToyStory3 was deleted, with 100 seeders and was just ~320MB. How sad is that? Result of my seven hours for encoding and five hours of seeding - martyred for the glory of TPB."
