,Emcet,2010-06-29T10:21Z,"If I choose BBs License I wait 1h and nothing happen only ""Update in progress ..."", Auto reset never working on my PC, it give me error all the time -.- ..."
,Professoriz,2010-06-30T03:35Z,"Yeah, its not working.

RobbingHood, could you contact B0X again and ask a favour from he to make new TR :)"
,venomhed,2010-06-30T22:56Z,"Not working, confirmed 6/30/2010."
,venomhed,2010-07-02T23:28Z,"It looks like you can use the 1.5A Trial Reset by Box in Manual mode. However that partially fails.

Using 1.5A Manual, when it gets to the screen to input your info, the automated info will fail as it looks like 1231321@asdasdas213.com.

It seems that GData may be looking for realistic info.

What I did was input info such as:

John Doe
23123232@gmail.com

That seems to work since Gmail is obviously a real email provider.

Hope this helps Box in correcting these Trial Resets as we all appreciate them.

Thanks!"
,Professoriz,2010-07-05T02:51Z,Any sign of box mr. RobbingHood ?
[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-06T01:30Z,"@Professoriz 

What's the problem? Your first report was that it worked, and so far that's what I know."
,Ladious,2010-07-06T15:20Z,"RH...Its not works anymore , please make new 1 thx."
,Freaktaler_mkbs,2010-07-07T11:08Z,"@ RobbingHood

[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-07T21:41Z,NOTE: There's a new trial resetter. Once I've got sme time left it'll be posted.
