[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-17T02:53Z,I have decided that I will upload the movie in either DVD5 or DVD9 solely to my discretion. If the movies quality will fall short of 80% from compression with new releases I will leave as DVD9. If under 70% for older releases I will leave as DVD9. I think this is a reasonable conclusion to try and please all of my followers. Please enjoy and always feel free to tell me how much you like the movie:)

[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-17T06:35Z,Hey Metal Yeah it looks like I will be doing most DVD9's from here on out. It seems like I'm getting a fairly loyal following where seeders will stick around. That was my biggest concern that ppl would not seed as much and so forth. I'm still going to remove the dumb trailers and crap like that. 
,kenith1,2010-06-17T07:45Z,Thanks Mike!

,jokemaestro,2010-06-18T02:14Z,"ouch, no more dvd5, i guess i cant download from u no more :("
,simpson_d,2010-06-18T02:24Z,whats the difference if you download a dvd5 or a dvd9 you just take out the shit that you don't want and compress it using clone or many other programs it is plain and simple
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-18T02:59Z,"thanks mike.  i could give a fuck less bout 5 or 9 all i know is when the download is complete and im done seeding its straight to dvd5 i go.  no loss in quality what so ever.  i guess in order to do that you have to be good at what you do and know a thing or 2 about recoding!  and no mike, that is not a shot at you my friend, haha."
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-18T03:55Z,Hey sorry about no seeds today everyone for some reason I didn't realize my utorrent was closed and I just got in from work. I have thought about it long and hard but I'm going to stick with what I am doing. I may upload the odd DVD9 but for the most part the majority of people are looking for the best quality DVD5 and I can provide that to them so I'm sorry if anyone is disappointed about not very many DVD9's but this is the way I'm going to roll if you wanna continue following me thank you so much for your support and if not well your loss.
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-18T04:03Z,Also Zombie it's impossible to make a DVD9 to a DVD5 without compressing the feature.
[T],ctang,2010-06-18T05:34Z,"@MM: not necessarily, if you re-encode everything else but the main feature on a dvd9 that is perhaps like your previous torrent, then i would say it has to be possible...im definitely not taking a shot at ya but to me it makes sense...i really hope that a**hole in your last torrent doesnt see this bc it will just get him going again...thanks for this by the way, since i dont think i thanked ya yet"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-18T06:13Z,Oh no worries and even though the book of eli was only 4.9 I still had to compress it by 12% so that is technically a quality loss is what I'm saying. It's pretty much impossible to dvd 9 to a dvd5 without getting rid of extras because the movies features are usually like 4.7GB + and then once you add all the padding it will be like 5GB so it wouldn't fit on a disk. So in my opinon are you really going to noticed 12% compression most likely no lol. So yeah. I know you guys aren't shooting me down but technically there is somewhat of a quality loss when re-encoding.
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-18T08:19Z,Oh you mean the comments??? I uno someone wanted a DVD9 when there was only 12% compression to the feature film so yeah lol.
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-18T12:29Z,"Wow quite alot of hatered  , well i am really srry for causing alot mess , and again srry !!!!"
,acloud0707,2010-06-18T23:48Z,This is badass thanks a bunch mikemelo...Its hard to find DVD-R copies anywhere anymore. Are you using DVD Fab for the Video Files or another program? As far as DVD5 to DVD9 i agree that if you can get better than 75% on DVD5 to go with that as I like to put all my movies on a DVD-R disc and dont feel like paying extra for a double layer disc. If i download a DVD9 i just compress it with DVD Shrink anyways...But keep up the good work man I'm sure you will hear a couple of request from me in the near future
[T],ctang,2010-06-19T00:37Z,"@MM: thanks for the manual...one question tho, where did you CCE from and are what version are you using (as in djfreds instructions he says we need 2.7 to get use in dvdrebuilder)...again thanks a lot...i dont know why i never checked into it on freds site"
,slade0012,2010-06-20T01:57Z,"Great Torrents Thank You
I was wondering if you could add CSI Season 9 All Discs and CSI: NY Season 5 All Discs when ever you get a chance"
,carouselboy,2010-06-20T20:08Z,thanks m8! could you upload school for scoundrels?
[T],ctang,2010-06-28T22:53Z,hey i can do school for scoundrels
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-29T01:53Z,Just a reminder to everyone. I can do everyone's upload however I need some time to upload them as I am a very busy guy but don't think I have not rec'd your request if I do not respond. I write every and all requests down. I will eventually get to it. Please be patient and thank you for choosing my torrents:)
