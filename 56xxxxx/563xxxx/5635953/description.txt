Queen Of The deathmatch Mickie Knuckles on Awesome Bomb Fight Radio!

2 days away from her huge 1st ever match, with XPW's Bloodthirsty Vixen Amanda, THE Queen Of The Deathmatch MICKIE KNUCKLES comes back to Awesome Bomb Fight Radio! Last time she was among the greatest guests in the history of the show and didn't shy away from any topics your heroes threw at her! Last time she was just ...on the way back into the game coming off of her horrific broken leg and now she is back in full swing and ready to get violent this Friday, April 30th in El Monte, CA! Plus all the drunken conspiracy theories and idiocracy that your friends Sensei and Violence Jack can muster... plus The Hardcore Enforcer Mr California and 60 Seconds with K Ross
