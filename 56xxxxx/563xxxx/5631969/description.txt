Bio:

BARETREES hail from Toronto, having taken on multiple musical identities over the past few years. The band has hit its creative stride in 2009 tightening as a versatile and unique rock group. The quartet draw from a rich and diverse collection of musical influences, thus producing fresh melodies that soar over dense, "classic" rock grooves in their live shows as well as on newly recorded material available on site and online.
