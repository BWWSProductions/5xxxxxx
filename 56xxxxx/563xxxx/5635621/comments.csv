Sorry im just confused as all your other torrents are VINYL rips.


so did you rip this to FLAC from CD and upload it or do that whole vinyl stuff?"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-18T20:29Z,it's a cd rip. i'm going to do the vinyl when i get it ;)
,enthused87,2010-06-18T22:06Z,Awsome man thanks :) Finally a Proper 320kbps Cd Rip. Be Sure to Post The Deluxe Version songs too when they are released.
,omgmusti,2010-06-20T21:07Z,"Whoa. Good work getting your hands on it. Thanks for the FLAC+320 upload. I Pre-ordered the album on iTunes but I wanted a HQ rip quickly so I'm going to use your release for my car, and iTunes download for my iPod :D

Anyway thanks"

,omgmusti,2010-06-21T05:23Z,"Has anyone figured out who the female vocalist on ""Almost Famous"" is? Sounds like Katy Perry..Anyway, this flac release is pretty amazing. Listening through it all, sounds really good. Still seeding it too =]"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-21T05:33Z,"it's the lead singer of ""The Knife"", can't remember her name"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-21T18:32Z,yea but as a huge eminem fan. i researve the right to title it as i see fit. ;)
[V],bubanee,2010-06-22T03:14Z,"the 17th song does not actually exist on the Cover so as HMV states, (Bonus Track) with the song name.. 
Untitled just means it ain't there! But it is on the CD!!!!! :))"
,mistahouija,2010-06-22T20:06Z,"@omgmusti and HMVinyl, Liz Rodrigues is the female voice credited for additional vocals on Almost Famous (see: Recovery digital booklet). I don't see The Knife's Karin Dreijer Andersson credited anywhere on the album. Just FTR =]"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-23T05:23Z,lol my bad.. i got my info from a forum board
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-06-23T06:21Z,"Uploader, R U ""obbrich"" on another ""private"" site?"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-06-23T06:51Z,"lol no, i go by HMVinyl or HomeMadeVinyl or HMV and nothing else that matters to you ;)"
,Nabarun,2010-06-26T20:18Z,"Thanks. My favs are ""So bad"" and ""Love the way u lie"". The contrasting voices/melody on the later is like ""Biriyani"" for the ears."
