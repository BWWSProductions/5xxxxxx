One of the best known WWII PoW escape stories. Three
men, Michael Codnor, Eric Williams and Oliver Philpot made
it back to Britain via the Baltic and Sweden after escaping
from Stalag Luft III.

Stalag Luft III was designed to be escape proof. Forty
or more tunnels were discovered under construction
before this one succeeded.

The tunnel's start point was concealed at a position in view
of the camp guards. It was opened only when a vaulting
horse was placed over it. The vaulting horse was carried to
and from the concealed worksite each day. Inside the horse
were the tunnelers, and, after a day's work, tunnel cuttings.

While they dug, other PoWs used the vaulting horse for its
original purpose - physical exercise. 

The production captures a feeling of paranoia and alienation.
It's less good on some of the characters, who are played with
a touch too much English sang froid [old chap].

On the whole though, it's well worth the listen.
