Based on the very underground comic book, an immortal Tibetan monk
finds a mentor in a young street kid he can teach to protect
the ancient scroll he's been guarding for the last sixty years.
With the help of a sexy and elusive young woman named Bad Girl,
they come together to do battle with the kung fu master who'll
stop at nothing to own the scroll.
