           In the near future, everything has changed. Basic human        
           rights have become the rarest of luxuries. No one knows        
           when this started but everyone knows how. The VXII, the        
           deadliest virus ever created, spread like wildfire and         
           decimated the majority of the world's population. The          
           non-infected survivors now cling to life in four               
           quarantined cities behind a wall. Shawn Kors and his           
           brother, Jude, survived the VXII only to grow up in a          
           squalid internment camp for orphaned children. Under the       
           care of the militia, they were pitted against other            
           children in backwoods death matches. Shawn, Jude, and the      
           few who escaped became notorious for their incredible          
           fighting skills. They have since parted ways. Shawn now        
           makes a comfortable living as a janitor at the local           
           medic station. He spends his days dreaming of curing the       
           VXII. When Shawn discovers the discarded body of a fellow      
           internment camp friend, he is forced out of hiding and         
           pulled into a rabbit hole of conspiracy and violence. All      
           signs point to Jude. With bounty hunters and the militia       
           on his trail, Shawn races to find his brother before Jude      
           executes an unspeakable action that will destroy them          
           all. He chases Jude across a sprawling post-apocalyptic        
           landscape to an abandoned laboratory. There he discovers       
           the true nature of his world and the secret behind the         
           white wall.
