,brewhaha,2010-06-20T17:50Z,"Thank you so much for your torrents! I was impatient yesterday and downloaded one from someone else... naturally it was virus-laden. Fortunately, Kaspersky caught it and cleaned it up, but I hope the community appreciates all you do in providing working, virus-free torrents for us to enjoy! 

No more being impatient for me! Next time I'll wait for yours!
