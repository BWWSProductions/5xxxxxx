# Why this upload ? 
A black and white pencil drawing of a dirty street wall saying a "Freedom of speech has gone bad..." by Jay Naylor decided me.
Careful tho, some of them are pretty hardcore.

# About the artist :
"Naylor was primarily known as a pornography artist.
[...] In 2003, he created Better Days, which focused on the development of his primary creation, Fisk Black, and offered a mix of comedic and dramatic storylines. 
[...] One of his characters from Better Days, Jessica, was used on the playbill for a production of the play Poona the Fuckdog (And Other Plays For Children) by the award winning indie theater, Sacred Fools Theater Company of Los Angeles in 2006."
