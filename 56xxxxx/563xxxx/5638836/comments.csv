[V],hiest,2010-08-24T17:52Z,"Good Afternoon Mr: Erenel,

I received a threat and abuse from a trusted uploader today,

I use to share torrents from trusted sources like KINGDOM, IMAGiNE, Noir and many more,

There is a lot of competition in uploading torrents these days, 

I understand that i don't have the right to threaten him back, So i am reporting it to you,

Here is the link to that section:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5786728/An_American_In_China_2008_DVDRip_XviD_AC3-KiNGDOM_(Kingdom-Relea

Name of the uploader: SoftWarez

I don't want to react to his abusive comment as it would be against the rule.

Kindly advised him not to write such comments,

Thank you for offering us such a wonderful website with 100% support. 

Thanks and Regards,
hiest.

,kuttunni,2010-08-29T10:50Z,if users can delete their own comments should be good . i am expecting your response .
