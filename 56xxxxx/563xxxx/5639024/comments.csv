,analog84,2012-01-17T07:34Z,"Thanks a million!

I used to play this game for hours -being reunited with it after many years resulted in staying up until 6:30am two nights in a row!

Works great -and my computer totally sucks.

xox"
,jrock24,2012-02-29T19:08Z,"Fun game, used to play it all the time. Fast download, game works great so far, except the guy on the trading posts moves too fast as if he just smoked bunch of crack. It doesn't effect game-play though. "
,Marriet_,2012-04-19T23:54Z,"The game works good only my hero won't show up after summoning (I get a message that he is there though), so that kind of screws everything up. Does anyone know how to fix it?

I can see gods, but I also don't get a message for example when I put to many sheep with a shed (normally it says that you need to build another herding shed) and more of those little bugs."
,RawBerserker,2012-04-29T21:08Z,"Whenever I try to play the game, my PC restarts. No idea why and I'm on Windows XP. Any help?"
,Nimrod93,2012-07-04T11:51Z,Can you upload POSEIDON as well with the same way? We would very pleased:)
