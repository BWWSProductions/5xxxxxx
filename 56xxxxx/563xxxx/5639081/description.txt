"Woven have created the blissfully unique in this album; a perfectly balanced fusion of sensual vocals and heavy yet welcoming beats blends with chilled out synth lines that seem to converse with one another deep in the music. As Jason mentioned earlier, the vocalists have no egos whatsoever, but I would take it a step further; you can hear the same candor expreesed through the guitars, bass, and clearly the two drummers (hell, it must be hard to share a song between two drummers without it getting out of control or overpowering, but W0V3N pulls it off brilliantly). I do have to disagree with some reviewists (?) who have described a Woven album as "romantic-gothic" and "haunting and ghostly, a trip into a cold night with a full moon"; a Woven album is perfect as a trip-hop album, a soundtrack for an open-air drive in the summer with the roof down and your ears open and eyes closed (no not if your driving, jeez) if you let it be. Brilliant stuff, there is not one song I dislike on this album and no filler. I am surprised they have such a relatively small fanbase, but I kinda like it this way. It proves Woven really is in it for the music (sorry 'bout the cliche); It makes Woven's music more intimate and personal to each of us
Woven fan(atic)s.

It would be worthless to anyone to rate songs on a marks-out-of-five system, as I would proudly award 5 to every song, so I'm not gonna." - Some random guy from Amazon.com

This seriously is good shit. Here it is, the second of their three albums. Personally, this is my favorite one. I hope you guys enjoy, and BUY IT IF YOU LIKE IT. I bought this for THREE DOLLARS. I know it's not much, but it's still a good thing to support groups like this. Just saying. :P
