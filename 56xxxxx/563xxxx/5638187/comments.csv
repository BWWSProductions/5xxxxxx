The Complete Seventh Season will be released on October 5, 2010

The other two seasons are TBA, but don't hold your breath, season six was released in Feb, 2006 so we may be waiting years... only to have to wait some more for Archie Bunker's Place to be released.

I'm resisting watching them on TVLand, as it seems certain ""edits"" were made for re-airing.  Most of them are two minutes short.  When they were first re-aried as repeasts, producer Norman Lear said he would buy the airtime just so the network would air it complete.  Sadly, the network declined and we are now stuck with these ""edits"".
