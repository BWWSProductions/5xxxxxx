there are many solutions,there should be a binkw32.dll file in the x:\program files\disney..\toy story 3\... game folder.
If you have one,copy it to your windows/System/ directory.If this won't work,than google and install ""Rad video tools"" wich already contains the Bink codec.you can also try to reinstall your game.If still no success,read this article:

,mrman54,2010-06-29T22:21Z,"NEVERMIND i worked it out!
TO ALL WHO ARE INSTALLING IT ON MAC:

1.Install the game (run the ""Toy Story 3 installer"" file with the ball icon)
2. once finished, right click on the game and go ""show package contents""...
3. a new folder will appear. go into CONTENTS, then RESOURCES, then TRANSGAMING, then C_DRIVE, then PROGRAM FILES, then DISNEY INTERACTIVE STUDIOS, then TOY STORY 3,
4.then copy the content from the CRACK folder in the downloaded install file (rld-tst3.iso) and put it into the TOY STORY 3 folder :D then close all folders and run the game! it works!"

,pcwizard500,2010-06-30T18:30Z,"I Believe I can be of help to those who are having trouble. This I did on Vista.
First use DAEMON tools Lite to mount it, then install the game using disney splash.
After installation go to my computer and it will say HD DVD-ROM Toy Story 3, explore the contents of this and you will find a folder called 'Crack', enter the file and copy both things inside ( .exe, .dll ), go to my computer again and click on your hard drive where you installed it too, for example, Local Disk C, enter that and go to program files and then to DisneyInteractive or something like that, paste it inside that folder and it will ask whether to overwrite the original .exe file, accept it to overwrite and double click TS3-Game.exe to play.

Hope this helped as I had trouble at first figuring it all out. "

You could try opening the cd like a normal folder (rightclick and select browse), and then doubleclick setup.exe or setup.msi directly. 

It might work better than the autostart the cd uses.

teraid  at 2010-07-02 13:33 CET: 

From what I could find on the net, either another account is making use of an ""octane application"". 
Or one of those kinds of applications are started up with your account when you boot windows.

I`m not sure what software to turn off. But just restart the computer, turn off all useless programs with task manager and see if the game runs."

,Mustafa1990,2010-07-07T18:18Z,"FOR EVERYONE THAT HAS PROBLEMS INSTALLING THE GAME !!!

1.DOWNLOAD THE GAME

2.OPEN DAEMON TOOLS AND CHOOSE THE TOY STORY FILE FROM YOUR DOWNLOADS

3.CLICK ON THE FILE IN DAEMON TOOLS AND THEN PRESS THE MOUNT BUTTON(here is where many people go wrong instead of MOUNTING the file in daemon tools or poweriso u simply UNRAR the file and that is wrong , i speak out of own experience)

4.AFTER YOU HAVE MOUNTED GO TO "" my computer "" YOU WILL SEE THE MOUNTED FILE THERE

5. INSTALL THE GAME but when it asks ' do you want to run the game ' click NO

6.COPY THE CRACKED CONTENT FROM THE CRACK FILE

7.GO TO "" my computer "" click "":C"" (then u have to go to where u INSTALLED it NOT where u DOWNLOADED it i will give u the example from my computer 

"" C:/Program Files/Disney Pictures "" 

8. PASTE THE CRACKED CONTENT IN TO THE ""DISNEY PICTURES "" and when it says Copy&replace ? click YES 

(now do NOT open the disney pictures file and then paste no no just when u see the disney pictures file RIGHTCLICK it and then PASTE

and when this is done you can play the crappy toy story 3 game :-)

(PS : FOR PEOPLE THAT SAY "" if u are to stupid to install the game and crack you shouldnt download it "" i say GO FUCK YOURSELF ) EVEN YOU AT ONE TIME DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DO IT SO DONT GIVE OTHER PEOPLE HARD TIMES JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU ARE COOL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD GAMES THAT EVENTUALLY FILL YOUR COMPUTER WITH VIRUSSES!!! (to the people here if a game has a Keygenerator don't download it and don't use the keygenerator unless u have a good antivirus because 99.9% of the time the virusses are in the keygenerator and 50% of the time your avast or norton does not detect these virusses)"

,Icedmelody,2010-08-13T02:05Z,"For the people who wanna know:

1) The crack is inside the DVD. JUst extract it using Power ISo or something to any folder you wish. Then copy teh two files in it to the game folder AFTER it's installed.

2) The graphics AREN'T as good as Xbox or PS3, but not as bad as the Wii/PSP. Speaking about graphics, there is little configuration in the options. You can set resolution (only some are possible), antialiasing and graphic quality overall (even with it on high, it isn't impressive, as I stated it before).

3)Is the game good? Compared to most film to game adaptions, it is quite good. It isn't very challenging, but keep in mind this is for younger people, and for that matters, it's pretty enjoyable. So, if you like adventure games and like Toy Story and easy difficulty doesn't put you down, this is the game to download :P

4)It doesn't have any viruses. It's a fake positive.

Enjoy :D"
