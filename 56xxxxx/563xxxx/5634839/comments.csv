,-mrlegit-,2010-06-18T11:41Z,"Finally, a proper retail CDRip! Thanks Bubanee top quality! Just after the two itunes bonus tracks now.."
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-18T13:18Z,"thanks bubs,
bt are you sure this is a CDRip the avg bitrate is just 249 kbps. although the quality is good"
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-18T13:29Z,no this is cdrip i take my comment back sorry for that
[V],bubanee,2010-06-18T15:06Z,your right matey like i said if i write CDRip it is that.. there's no hidden tricks with me... :))
,Danman42,2010-06-18T16:56Z,"Bubanee... fake no chance in hell. Every torrent I get is 100% legit from Bubs just check Wiki even the track times are exact and the covers. 


Also Bubanee plz get IYAZ Replay also Chingy.
Be cool man

 Is this CDrip any different to the other Retail one you uploaded??"
,mikieelmo,2010-06-18T17:03Z,thanks again !
[V],bubanee,2010-06-18T21:29Z,@ Danman42... the earlier one i did was a Web/Scene release they will have me writing [2010-MP3-Cov] in the title where as this one here a cd rip will have CDRip in the title.. or CDRip [Cov+CD]... thats how i split them... but when i do the earlier ones i keep the bitrate as i find them because there is to many people doing things like 128kbps to 320Kbps. i try and source the best possible internet release... but this one here is a fair dinkum CDRip :)) 
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-18T23:19Z,"i know you're australian i was just saying the cd had been released today so of course you had it haha.  

you told me way back when, when i commented you rather harshly about the Atreyu cd.  i was a douche to you that day and i will never forget what i said and how i acted.

i still feel guilty.  you are a great guy for being nice to me even after that."
[V],bubanee,2010-06-19T00:36Z,"hey Z.. wow i totally forgot that.. back then i was very passionate about uploading.. a lot of people on a lot of sites were throwing the fake thing at me esp Mininova but in time people noticed that i was doing the right thing... and i learnt just like you that people will back ya up so you don't have to be abusive... :)) 
and you have come along way since then too.. :)) "
[V],bubanee,2010-06-19T00:42Z,and i didn't even abuse ya back... rare back then i was a shocker.. LOL... :)) don't feel bad about it either.. it just never happened.. :))
,RIggsta,2010-06-19T05:40Z,thanks you have awesome ups
,kbssadnb,2010-06-19T07:26Z,Thanks! Great upload as always. 
,loadx2,2010-06-19T08:18Z,"And thank you for being awesome. Been waiting and looking for a this. 

You are my hero. :D"
,Danman42,2010-06-19T12:48Z,"Alright man. So just the Bit-rate basically will be different. Just it is a mission for me to download these torrents on my connection it is like 2-5 KBps. 

All the tracks are the same though. To be honest I don't really like this album as much as Relapse. But is still tight.  I bet ""No Love"" will be a number 1 hit. ;)


PS. I read on Wiki that ""untitled"" track was ""You Don't Own Me"". "
,torrtruk,2010-06-19T13:59Z,"thanks a lot, buddy.

my first time to listen to eminem's songs."
[V],bubanee,2010-06-19T14:22Z,"Cheers All!!! :))
yes dan big difference between a CDRip and a web release... with a CD thats what your getting, but with a web/scene you never know unless it comes from a good known source... which i do have... 
there are a lot of people transcoding (re-rippin) a web/scene from low bitrates to highbitrates as well. you say you download at 2 ~ 5 Kbps so i'm assuming normal dial up if not is there a problem with what your using?? "
,agenty,2010-06-19T15:09Z,"Hey... Thanks as always to anyone who uploads... Downloading this now, will leave quality comments shortly!
Im in the UK and this album has been released in MOST of Europe, apart from the UK! I was planning on buying this today but I guess this will surfice as long its a proper stereo at real 320kbps rip."
,agenty,2010-06-19T15:16Z,Its the same quality as the rest available. Its a mono rip rather than a proper stereo rip. Any chance (as you have the legit CD) of re-ripping properly to stereo?
[V],bubanee,2010-06-19T16:11Z,agenty... are you saying joint stereo is mono!!! way off my friend... go to hydrogenaudio and read up on VBR.. sorry i can't help you i only rip with the best available not outdated CBR... why don't you settle for a flac and convert it yourself i did make one but it was for private but i'm sure it has surfaced around here somewhere.. :))
,Troybambam,2010-06-19T17:14Z,"justified_murder : Get The F*** Out Of Here, This Is Not A Fake And Is Not Missing A Track And I Tunes DOES NOT Have A Song Called Missing On The List Of Songs, You Retard.

But Anyways, Bubanee I Made A Account Just To Thank You For This Man...
Love It, And It Is The Right Shit. 

So Haters SIT DOWN!."
,FallontheFeg,2010-06-19T19:34Z,Thanks man top notch as always :D
,Danman42,2010-06-19T21:15Z,"Yeah I do know what you mean. That people convert like if you had a silent noise and converted to 320kb aint going sound better or different from 128 kb. 

But the other web Rip is pretty good quality for my ears. I don't really complain about sound quality like everyone else. Long as it dosent have equalizers on it or noise it sounds good on my headphones.

@agenty yo I think one of your speakers are bust. haha. 

My internet is just slow. A 2G modem. I am in Zimbabwe, Southern Africa. Just companies overload their systems so I only get slow as hell internet even web pages are a mission to download."
