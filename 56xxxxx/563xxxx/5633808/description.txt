Plot outline:
He goes by the name Dakota, and he is one of the best preserved dinosaurs ever seen.
The special thing about him is, that, contrary to other dinosaur-fossils, Dakota has survived for millions of years complete with skin, tissue, muscles, organs and - maybe - dna.
He is a complete, 3-dimensional dinosaur.
