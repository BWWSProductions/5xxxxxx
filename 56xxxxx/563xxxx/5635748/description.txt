   This enticing period melodrama depicts a long-suffering woman's     
   relationship with her brilliant but self-destructive writer         
   husband in postwar Tokyo. Based on a semi-autobiographical 1947     
   novel by Osamu Dazai, the story centers less on the womanizing,     
   heavy-drinking, suicidal hero than on the wife who loves him.
