Notes :
This was broadcasted in Japanese TV program named "Sony Music TV" and I recorded this in VHS tape.
I couldn't remember when this was broadcasted, but must be before Maiden's Japan Tour (April '91) for tour promotion, so about 17 years ago.

End part of "Tailgunner" is faded and overlapped by Bruce Interview, and beginning part of "Wrathchild" is also overlapped Janick Interview.
On the other hand, "Public Enema Number One" and "Hallowed Be Thy Name" are included completely.

The program is originally containded promotion video "Holy Smoke", so I deleted it,
and also containded a scene of their flight from Belfast to Newcastel, but background music is inserted, so deleted this part.

I've found that I have some VHS tapes containing "Sony Music TV" program like above live show.
Naplam Death, Mama's Boys, Anthrax, Motorhead, Tygers Of Pan Tang, Madam X, Girlschool, The Lord Of The New Church...
Except for Naplam Death and Mama's Boys, broadcasted only one or two songs, so now I'm planning to sum those one MPEG2 file for posting.
If anyone hope me to post those, imform me.
