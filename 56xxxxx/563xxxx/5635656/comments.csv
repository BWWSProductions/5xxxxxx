,baybeh,2011-07-09T15:31Z,are the subtitles hard or soft?
,frnortner,2011-08-15T05:29Z,"The subtitles in the iso file are soft. You will have to use magiciso or some such to add them so you can burn the iso. Note this is not a REGION 1 iso, may not work in home dvd players. I'll try to change the region code, add the subs and [ut iy up here.
Also note you have to go to the home menu and restart to get the subs at subs.to, the link is ng."
