With quests being quite specific, how the hell can you guess at what you are supposed to do. One japanese game I had to drop a certain cooked fish on the ground in a certain place to make the boss appear. How the fuck could you figure that out by yourself? A forum helped me out a bit. "

,Tolle44,2011-06-11T14:36Z,"Oh, and I do agree with Fernfrond - there's no point in playing the Japanese versen, except for the sheer joy of having a Fairy Tail game in your vicinity, but when that ecstasy wears off, you're pretty much down to nothing :/"
