,jazonemi,2010-07-03T10:42Z,"hey, guys 
Can you help me, I can't open the resolution switcher or patcher. My screen is 2560x1440.
How can I change it?
                                 Please help me : Jazonemi"
,Pluto_999,2010-07-03T15:01Z,It should work from custom launcher inside application but if not there are some predefined resolution settings in the EXTRAS folder - try them (backup or rename old R6GameConfig.bin as may be not all will work).
,MAXIMOLIDER,2010-07-03T19:19Z,"Hello.. The game don't even open!

I've tried everything but the icon just appear on the dock and disappear immediately!! 
And the CXZ Aquamarine, is unable to clic it, so I can't change the settings..

Please can someone help me with this?"
,MAXIMOLIDER,2010-07-03T19:28Z,"In the description says: New CXZ wrapper (Aquamarine).
CXZ Aquamarine 'ghost cursor' bug is fixed.

But the cursor still Ghost! I can't clic the resolution patcher to change the settings!! Can anybody help with this?"
,Pluto_999,2010-07-04T07:17Z,"1.
>>>>>> The game don't even open

First check in Application Monitor whether some 'wineserver'/'wineloader' processes are exist - if so close them all (manually from Application Monitor or from Terminal or with some utility such as Grim Ripper) or none of the game or Resolution Patcher will start.

And you should copy the game to HDD before launching as it will create preferences files inside application on the first run.

2.
It can be only one wineserver process running so you can't open both the game and Resolution Patcher at the same time.

3. 
>>>>>> But the cursor still Ghost! I can't clic the resolution patcher

'Ghost' cursor is an error - the second cursor mark in the game - and so it have nothing with clicking Resolution Patcher."
,TheHelpfulHacker,2010-07-14T18:59Z,"@ many people with the same problem...nWhenever I start the single player campaign, it begins to load the game with the picture of the people in the helicopter. Just as I assume it was done loading, the game crashes. Terrorist Hunt currently works but I am anxious to play the SP campaign. I think that the TextEdit that came with the game was trying to say that this was a 1.0 BETA; this game is not fully complete."
,Pluto_999,2010-07-16T19:36Z,"As it was already mentioned try the previous 1.0 CXZ Black Diamond wrapper if you have not yet - maybe it will work better for you. It was made last year and so better tested - should work on any Mac.
