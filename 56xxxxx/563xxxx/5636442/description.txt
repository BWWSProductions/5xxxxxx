JOHNNY THUNDERS : VOLUME 2  DEATH WARMED OVER        
         
MPEG-2 720x480 NTSC 4:3                                                     
         
1) Berns, Stockholm, SWEDEN 03/22/82 (Recorded for TV show "MÃ¥ndagsbÃ¶rsen")
         
This is the INFAMOUS show where Johnny is too messed up to perform and decides to  insult the Swedish audience. This made Swedish news and got Johnny banned for a  few years. Some highlights are when Johnny asks the audience what side they were   in the war. And asking if there are any N!g-gers to move his amp. There is one part where you see Jerry Nolan get Johnny's attention just to shake his head as if to say "this is NOT going well", iIt's like watching a car wreck.  
The show was never aired at TV show "MÃ¥ndagsbÃ¶rsen", only a short clip was used in the debate show "Studio S" about the influence on young people from rock music and drugs.
(NOTE: audio is mono from one speaker only).         


2) KÃ¥ren, GÃ¶teborg, SWEDEN 11/10/84        
Johnny returns to Sweden a few years later and saves face. Does a great set and an acoustic encore. He even brings up his antics from a few years back. JOHNNY AT HIS BEST!
