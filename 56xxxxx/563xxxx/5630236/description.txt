PLOT:


It was an ingenious enough plan: rob the Riviera Casino's count room during an Elvis impersonator convention. But Thomas Murphy (Costner) decided to keep all the money for himself and shot all his partners, including recently-freed ex-con Michael Zane(Russell). With $3.2 million at stake, the Marshals Service closing in, and single mom Cybil Waingrow (Cox) and her son Jesse (Kaye) constantly confounding things, Michael must track down Murphy.
