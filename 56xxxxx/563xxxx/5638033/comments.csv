,MorganSmee,2011-06-22T23:08Z,"Kona ripped this season right off the tv show adverts and all and the subs don't sync up well even when I try the sub delay. Don't download this, remove it immediately and go download it episode by episode or you'll be stuck forwarding through adverts and it's just not worth it."
