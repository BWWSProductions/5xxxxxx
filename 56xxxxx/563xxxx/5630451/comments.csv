,nuggz,2010-06-16T04:26Z,"Allow me to be the first to say, thanks!"
,x7thdayx,2010-06-16T04:27Z,"Yeah for getting a Bluray rip 2 weeks before it even gets released in stores for free there is a lot of whining and complaining. Funny that people who do absolutely nothing to put these releases out to the pubic bitch so much about shit. I guess some people feel like they deserve something for doing absolutely nothing and if it isn't perfect or fast enough then it isn't good enough. Anyways, thanks aoloffline for uploading this. Any chance we'll see the 1080p?"
,improveurself,2010-06-16T04:40Z,"this movie seems to me just a bad copy of ""high fidelity"", anyway tks to aol..."

,Mattofsweden,2010-06-16T18:35Z,"Please include original NFO in your further uploads. They're the world for some to have in the folders. Especially when coding media streamers. They'll grab the paths/links in the NFO's and make us of them.

Thanks a bunch for a great and neat unpacked torrent."

,KickassWashingMachine,2010-12-12T18:28Z,"@cesc84:

Stupid and funny aren't mutually exclusive qualities. A move can be funny AND stupid, which is the case with this one. Really funny, really stupid."
,Monket,2010-12-29T05:04Z,"if your having problems playing any sort of video then download the k-lite codec pack. media player is far sharper than vlc and runs anything with this pack.
Hope this helps"
