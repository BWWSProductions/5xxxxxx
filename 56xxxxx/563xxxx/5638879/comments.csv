[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-20T04:41Z,I know it totally sucks this didn't come with at least Spanish subtitles. If I could I would help it but that's all the movie came with English subs and english and french audio.
,jokemaestro,2010-06-20T05:28Z,What happened to dvd5 :(
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-20T05:39Z,Oh it's just this movie and another as the reduction would have been like 45% which is just god awful. All the others should pretty much be DVD5
[T],ctang,2010-06-20T06:07Z,@MM: what version of cce do you use and where did you get it (purchase or TPB or somewhere similar) thanks man

[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-20T09:05Z,"im leaving this comment on your page and tater44s page

i have my bittorent set to stop seeding your dvd-r at 150-200GBs.  as soon as my uploading hits that mark, it stops.  i think thats fair for the hard work you guys put in.

thanks for everything."

[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-21T01:53Z,"Just a friendly reminder... I will 100% get to every request and it will be filled on here however, I am only 1 person and even though my computer is super mega tits and I have 6TB's of harddrive it's hard for me to just plop them all up at once. Please be patient and I will get your request up. I have them all written down so not to worry I will not forget:) Also it helps put your requests to the front of the line when you comment on my torrents and give me a quality status."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-21T04:31Z,"6TBs of HDD!!!!!!  i just punched my computer in the region where its face would be, if in fact it had a face!!!

i have a combined 1TB, i am jealous!!!!"
