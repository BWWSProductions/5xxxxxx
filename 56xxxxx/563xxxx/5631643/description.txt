UNEXPECTED GUESTS AT BIRCHINGTON MANOR

A Strictly English Production 2001

Featuring a cast of eight, including six beautiful girls, Birchington Manor 2: Unexpected Guests At Birchington Manor continues where Birchington Manor 1 left off . It starts with new female staff member Billy Jo being introduced to staff discipline at Birchington. Then Kate decides to take revenge on poor Sophie out in the stable yard. Unbeknownst to them, they are being spied upon by two pretty hikers who are looking for a place to stay for the night. In turn though, the hikers themselves are being spied upon by the ever watchful Arthur who intercepts these unexpected guests. When they explain that they did not mean to trespass or spy but simply want a place to stay for the night, Arthur confers with Mr. Edwards and they agree the two girls can stay if they are prepared to work for their board and lodging and accept the usual staff discipline. They foolishly agree. In the meantime Lisa wants to get her revenge on Kate - or at least we think its revenge she wants!! But you will have to see for yourself. Cast: Georgie Simpson, Lesley Saye, Rebekah Jordan, Others
