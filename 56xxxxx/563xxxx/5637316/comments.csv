,sbm_from_la,2010-06-19T16:13Z,Hey uploader...  You wrote the name incorrectly.  You wrote Jokers but it's suppose to be Joker's ...  You LEFT OFF the apostrophe which is very important..  because if people searched using the correct spelling this torrent would NOT show up in their listing. 
,Mercyflush64,2010-06-19T17:27Z,"To the comment above.....If you will have noticed, this website does not post things like an apostrophe, hyphen, etc. Go ahead and do a search in the box with one, the results will not show them but the searched item will indeed appear. "
,sbm_from_la,2010-06-21T17:37Z,"I just completed TWO DIFFERENT SEARCHES..  One using Jokers and the other using Joker's and I came up with TWO completely results.  I found 4 torrents that said Joker's ...and I found THIS TORRENT that said Jokers...  so the apostrophe DOES make a different and yes, you can post using them...  

So I was CORRECT when I said you DO NEED TO INCLUDE the apostrophe so the name will match!"
