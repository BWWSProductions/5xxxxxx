Once you download, run 'Setup_Cubase' AFTER turning off your anti-virus protection (very important!). It installs it smoothly, but finally you also have to run the program 'sx3emu' which installs the dongle emulator that the software needs to run (a virtual protection device). I would've saved some time with instructions! Hope this helps other inexperienced users like me."

The H2O versions seem to have gotten glitchy... is this because Team H2O no longer exists, I believe? Anyway, these TeamAiR guys are supposed to be the next godsend. Hope it works smoothly."
