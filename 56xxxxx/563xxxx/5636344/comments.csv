However, the dialog (in places) is really bad, and has that ""written by a student/noob"" feel. Otherwise, most all of the other department did a fabulous job in keeping this project somewhat believable and non-""studenty"". But again, some of the dialog is comically bad, and trying way too hard. And makeup department....really? Nice job of having a scene in which the shine off the lead characters scalp takes precedence over everything else happening. 

Overall, amonumental effort. But bad/unbelievable dialog (in parts), and really bad lapses in judgment both during, and also in post production, will keep this from going as far as it might have. I rarely see a project that is winning so heavily in most all areas, have the overwhelming problems that this one does in some fairly minor areas. 

Learn from this, kiddies. CGI is NOT supposed to draw attention to itself. And it's even more (if thats possible) offensive when it not only draws attention to itself, but in a way in which the audience is like ""wow, that's some 1st year CGI work"". Pathetically bad CGI, actually harms a film more with it in, then if it was edited out.  So what if those scenes werent there? Cut out the bad flesh, so the body can live, you noobs.

Use your heads people, you obviously have some brains since the overall look and feel of this project were so good. Fire whichever idiot is dropping the ball, he/she is screwing up the value of this project."
