Jean-Philippe Guillemin has announced the release of Zenwalk Linux 6.4 "Core" edition, a minimalist, but extensible Slackware-based operating system: "Zenwalk Core 6.4 is ready. Zenwalk Core is a one-of-a-kind complete 300 MB base Zenwalk system designed to build high-performance and high-security non-GUI Linux servers, or to be used as the base of a custom light-speed desktop system. It can be installed in just 10 minutes using the auto-install setup option on a dedicated disk. Zenwalk Core 6.4 provides the 2.6.33.4 kernel with the new BFS scheduler, designed for the best interactivity on multi-core CPUs while taking the most of lower specification machines. You'll notice better responsiveness of many applications, better real-time performance (very low latency), and efficiency of 'niced' commands."
