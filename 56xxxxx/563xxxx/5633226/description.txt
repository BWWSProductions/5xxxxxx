.: Plot :.
Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) goes berserk while observing the peaceful Ba'ku people on their homeworld, revealing the presence of the joint Federation and Son'a taskforce to the Ba'ku. Admiral Matthew Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) requests the help of the USS Enterprise-E to help them capture and repair Data. Though they are able to do so, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) becomes suspicious of Dougherty's insistence that the Enterprise is no longer needed, and instead has his crew investigate the cause for Data's malfunction. They come to find that the Ba'ku are well aware of technology but have opted to reject it, instead living in harmony with nature, and they also later reveal they are much older than they appear. Picard asks Anij, the unofficial Ba'ku leader, "You have warp capability?" to which she replies mildly, "Capability, yes...but where can warp drive take us, except away from here?"
The Enterprise crew also begins to experience the rejuvenation effects of the planet; LaForge (Levar Burton) finds his eyes can see instead of requiring Optical Implants, Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Troi (Marina Sirtis) rekindle their long-abandoned relationship, and even Picard experiences romantic feelings for the Ba'ku woman Anij (Donna Murphy).
The crew discovers that the Briar Patch, the area of space that the Ba'ku homeworld is located, contains metaphasic radiation particles, more concentrated in the planet's rings, which impart the rejuvenation effects to those exposed to them but also block communications to the rest of space. They also discover a cloaked Federation ship that contains a gigantic holodeck recreating the Ba'ku village; Data's malfunction was apparently caused by his previous discovery of this ship. Picard surmises that corrupt Federation officers and the Son'a are attempting to collect the metaphasic particles with a large harvester. This would leave the planet uninhabitable, and Dougherty, who would not allow for the destruction of the Ba'ku, prepared the "holoship" to transport the Ba'ku off the planet without their knowledge. When confronted with these charges against the Prime Directive, Dougherty orders the Enterprise to leave.
Picard orders Riker to take the Enterprise out of the Briar Patch in order to communicate the situation with the Federation while he and others beam down to the planet to help the Ba'ku evacuate to nearby caves that will prevent them from being transported. While the Son'a send out robotic probes to tag the fleeing Ba'ku, allowing them to be transported individually, the Son'a leader Adhar Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) convinces Dougherty to allow him to send two Son'a ships to attack the Enterprise. Riker is able to destroy one ship and cripple the other through a risky maneuver and continues to leave the Briar Patch. With their plan exposed, Ru'afo insists that they must begin to harvest the metaphasic particles immediately, only to have Picard deliver a revelation: the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race. The Son'a are a breakaway Ba'ku faction who failed to convince the rest of the colony to embrace "offlander" ways, were exiled and have spent a century since trying (and failing) to preserve their lives; hence their desperate attempt to harvest the metaphasic particles. Dougherty then confronts Ru'afo, who kills him when he refuses to allow Ru'afo's scheme to continue.
Picard, his crew, and the Ba'ku are eventually transported onto the holoship, but manage to break free. They then use the ship to transport Ru'afo and the Son'a from their ship to the holoship, making them believe they are still in their bridge as they launch the harvester. Ru'afo eventually discovers the deception, and transports to the harvester to start it himself. Picard defeats Ru'afo and activates the harvester's self-destruct mechanism, killing Ru'afo as it explodes. The remaining Son'a are welcomed back by the Ba'ku who forgive them for their actions, this process beginning when Picard arranges a meeting between Gallatin (who, then, was Gal'na) and his mother. The Enterprise crew take one last moment to enjoy their rejuvenated selves before returning to their mission.
