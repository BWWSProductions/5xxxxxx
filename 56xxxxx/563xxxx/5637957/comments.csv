Questions/Comments/Suggestions:
1.  Are you superseeding?  If not, go here to read about it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-seeding and figure out how to do it in your client. 
2.  I highly suggest that you wait until one torrent is fully distributed before starting the next one.

It's probably too late to do it for these five torrents, but it would be good for the future.

Actually... if you clearly state that you are going to do so, you might benefit from stopping these and seeding them one at a time.

Come on over to irc.efnet.net and join the channel #thepiratebay.org and I'm sure others might have some more suggestions.  "

,oracle12,2010-06-22T23:35Z,thanx bestec1234. Ive checked 'initial seeding' in the properties of the torrent. I think that was what you mean.
