,farnorth,2010-06-20T13:44Z,This is not a ROM collection but rather a collection of ALL the TORRENT FILES that Farnorth had released. To get to the actual NDS ROMs -> download this package -> start the .torrent You need!
,Hotmailer,2010-06-22T21:12Z,"Ehm..well...are you the real Farnorth or just one copy-cat?
Anyway, the complete torrent collection already has been released.

See: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5542157/Farnorth_s_Nintendo_DS_Rompack_Collection_3301-4700_plus_XXXX

If you're the real Farnorth then thank you for this release and good luck with all you may or may not do in the future.
If you ain't..then please bugger off.."
,Hotmailer,2010-06-22T21:18Z,"WTF! It's just a plain copy of my torrent incl. all NFO files.
Giving credits where credits are due my man.

You're just an copy-cat who even can't make a genuine torrent collection himself."
,Zabber,2010-06-23T04:35Z,"I would give Capcom, Nintendo, Square, iNIS etc credit before arguing about who torrented warez first..."
,Hotmailer,2010-06-24T00:51Z,"True, true..I wouldn't even say anything about it..
;-)"
