,dahauk,2010-06-16T22:24Z,"a worthwhile endeavor to take part in! A scifi miniseries distributed solely by bittorrent, and supported by many sites, including Pirate Bay. Everyone should download and seed this to help them get big numbers and further backing! what a fun experiment--let's join in gang!"
[H],politux,2010-06-16T22:28Z,I'm currently seeding :)
,johnkravin,2010-06-17T03:20Z,is there a regular non high def version
,johnkravin,2010-06-17T03:20Z,is there a regular non high def verison
,computron,2010-06-17T09:43Z,If everyone downloads this and keeps seeding then maybe more shows will come out using this format.
,ninapuss,2010-06-17T11:39Z,"Dear oh dear... what a waste of bandwidth! If everyone AVOIDS downloading this ham with cheese, maybe they'll give up on making more of it."
,kratos24,2010-06-17T14:38Z,"okay, why everyone bashing this show on so many sites. It wasn't promoted by CBS or ABC. Why people are expecting show like lost or BSG out of this. 
Screw visuals guys, try to capture the essence of the writers and directors mind and you will enjoy it. Geeeeezzzz. "
,dahauk,2010-06-17T15:43Z,"looks good, but is there a non-MKV version.I frakkin hate MKV. My MPlayer won't play it in-sync. any player suggestions, or do I have to convert/post an AVI version?.."
,refuse2useausername,2010-06-17T16:06Z,i use GOM player and am yet to find a format it cannot handle

Thx for this UL :o)"
[H],politux,2010-06-17T17:10Z,"Regarding the caliber of the work, I think it is excellent.  Not it doesn't quite have the slickness of a big budget studio TV show.  But they made this for $6,000 and think they did a wonderful job.  Donate some cash and the next episode will be even better!

This production and distribution model is an experiment that no one else has ever tried.  They are letting us download it for free from BitTorrent and I for one commend them.  

As far as .mkv it the format I like best for HD video.  I use Linux Mint and SMPlayer.  The audio didn't go out of sync for me at all.  "
[H],politux,2010-06-17T17:22Z,"Posting comment responses before coffee is a bad idea.  The second sentence should say ""No"" instead of ""not.""  

And you're very welcome Zen_Bud!"

,ODBC,2010-06-18T00:01Z,"Thank you for making and sharing this!

Sure it needs work, but the initiative is great, so keep it up!"
,polyonymous,2010-06-18T05:12Z,love it! thanks for the up politux :)
,ninapuss,2010-06-18T08:45Z,It's rubbish... you are deluded if you think otherwise.
[H],politux,2010-06-18T15:50Z,"You're very welcome, polyonymous."
,Cziburka,2010-06-18T18:54Z,"Nice one. And free!!! It has low budget and you can see it, but its a wonderfull idea! Maybe not the best series ever but after all... Keep going guys. If you liked it DONATE!!! It'll get better!!! So come on, dont be greedy =D Waiting for the next episode!"
,1mher3,2010-06-18T21:25Z,"I admire what author is trying to do here (offering tv show to everyone for free), but the truth must be told: no one can make enjoyable science fiction movie without adequate budget.

Did someone seriously spent 35 minutes watching it and thought that this was good entertainment?"
,vallandil,2010-06-18T21:43Z,"Considering the budget.

Excellent show!!!
very well written why nobody remarks on this in beyond me..
Story has very much potential and i think the more episodes the quality of the show it self will rise...

NICe work"
,Fantasm,2010-06-19T00:40Z,I'm giving it a try... I've been downloading Star Trek Phase II and the U.S.S. Farragut indie Star Trek films and they're pretty good... They're made with volunteer casts and crew and I like them....
,dahauk,2010-06-19T04:42Z,"Similar to 'Sanctuary' in the way it's marketed and look where it got them, a regular cable net gig. Good luck and thanks to everyone to help make these folk's dream a reality!"
,gabriel1475,2010-06-19T08:25Z,"For a low-budget project, extremely well done! 

However, the dialog (in places) is really bad, and has that ""written by a student/noob? vibe, and trying so damn hard to sound like the ?Big Boys?. Otherwise, most all of the other departments did a fabulous job in keeping this project somewhat believable and non-""studenty"". But again, some of the dialog is comically bad, and trying way too hard. And makeup department....really? Nice job of having a scene in which the shine off the lead characters scalp takes precedence over everything else happening. That is a makeup/DP/LD/camera operator, fail!

Overall, a monumental effort. But bad/unbelievable dialog (in parts), laughably bad CGI, and really bad lapses in judgment both during, and also in post production, will keep this from going as far as it might have. I rarely see a project which is winning so heavily in most all areas FAIL so miserably in some fairly minor ones. 

Learn from this, kiddies. CGI is NOT supposed to draw attention to itself. And it's even more (if thats possible) offensive when it not only draws attention to itself, but in a way in which the audience is like ""wow, that's some 1st year CGI work"". Pathetically bad CGI harms a film more with it in, then if it was edited out.  So what if those scenes werent there? Cut out the bad flesh, so the body can live, noob editor/director.

Use your heads people, you obviously have some brains since the overall look and feel of this project were so good. Fire whichever idiots are dropping the ball, he/she/they are screwing up the value of this project."
,PI22,2010-06-20T02:34Z,"Why is the budget an excuse for digesting this level of quality? When it sucks, it just does.
Or will the next episodes be up to standard quality when the money comes in? That includes good acting, better camera work from multiple angles and editing, better sound recording and perhaps some post-production (!), more interesting lights, and so on.
Big fuzz for an amateurish student work...

But hey, you got it coming when you place this between a selection of the big TV show names. It would be fair to be more specific what kind of quality the viewer can expect!"
,LinShark11,2010-06-20T23:51Z,"I stopped watching after I saw Goldstone Observatory _Astrological_ Survey in the captions.

There's no excuse.."
,TTYd,2010-06-21T19:51Z,"Not too bad, would like to see more. The acting was a bit ropey in places (first scene especially), but it was an interesting watch with great potential."
,3reathmint,2010-06-22T01:41Z,"lol love the tim hortons joke they made in this. ""willy hortons"" made me chuckle."
[H],politux,2010-06-24T17:31Z,"Check out this blog post from VODO. Looks like they already raised $16,000 from donations and will be starting production on new episodes this September.

,curiousman2050,2011-04-24T20:12Z,"ok in terms of effects, well it is a low budget sci fi piece so the effects were not anything special but that's to be expected, honestly it's not the summer blockbuster that needs big special effects to bring in easy to please crowds. and it doesn't ahve good writing, i mean astrological survey? wow, obviously you had no astronomy consults on this one. and spreading radiation acros hundreds of miles... the sun spreads radiation across half of the earth every single day (technically the whole earth over the entire course of a day, but only half at a time).

i can appreciate the effort but get a better writer. a good writer will let you forgive the bad acting and bad effects.

i'm hoping this will improve with time."
