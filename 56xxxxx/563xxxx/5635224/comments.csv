,nofear24,2010-07-11T23:12Z,Fail!! sound stops halfway through the movie. maybe my file is messed up dont see how that is possible even if u drag further on still no sound just picture and file sayes it 3hrs long.
,Slick252525,2010-07-12T07:43Z,FXG- I am posting this question on your upload because I used to be Skulled Green on my previous account and I trust you... It appears that the Top 100 movie torrents are uploaded by two users... Do you think they are TRAPS? Or am I paranoid? I2P?
,LordHumungusNOS,2010-07-14T07:42Z,"Every time I get a torrent that says 9398seeds in my BitTorrent window and it never down loads, it turns out to be fake. Sence it won\'t complete, I won\'t slap a great big FAKE tag on it yet."

[S],WTCSWE,2010-07-18T14:30Z,FXG_team is VIP and has never uploaded crap.All their uploads are 100% clean.Enough said.
,kolot182,2010-07-19T09:21Z,how come my comment was deleted without answering it? i just asked why does my antivirus detects suspicious file and the torrent wont continue downloading because of that. my anti virus is avast 5. 
[S],WTCSWE,2010-07-21T11:07Z,"@ kolot182 

Simply because we have enough of spammers and fakers MPIAA that tries to misscredit VIP:s reputation.In order to protect the uploaders, we will delay such comments.
Also your computer is for sure infected with other crap files.Make sure to check your computer/software properly before typing infected/suspicious on VIP:s uploads."
,kolot182,2010-07-21T18:09Z,i just unchecked the bittorrent software of my AV so that it would not scan anymore my downloads. now im downloading it.

,shifty420,2010-09-16T21:45Z,@wtcswe hello mod. can u tell me how some movies get on the top 100 list moments after being uploaded. and it shows 9k seeders minutes after being uploaded. is someone hacking ur website? shortly after sway uploaded 4 vids with juked stats the uploads were taken down. which leads me to believe the problem was fixed. but how did he get those uploads onto the top 100 list in the first place. 
,drgs701,2010-09-20T18:18Z,"great upload

,ex902,2010-09-20T20:59Z,good video - thank you
,wierd-old-guy,2010-11-20T23:47Z,"Viruses / Trojans to have a dropper must generally have an executable (exe, dll, or active file altering / renaming mechanism). Heuristic scanning may also see anything that reaches into another file as a type of malware (keygens). Stop using heuristic scanning if you don't want to pull out every keygen and related software. IF the datafile is up to date; a keygen that does function as a dropper will get tagged.

AVI files cannot be infected unless they are junk and are designed to be renamed as executable from another program (then you'd have a 700Mb dropper.....Unlikely!)

Most every file I have ever seen in p2p type sharing that really DOES have some malware is SO pathetic that if you can't knock it down, you need to learn. The only seriously respectable malware programs are those that ""scan"" your machine and funtion as a ""blackmail"" program. Those are genrally rather sofisticated & writen to actively work against anti-malware programs. DON'T EVER let yourself get ""scanned"" my websites claiming to make your machine run faster, clean out viruses or any other similar thing. Movies are safe: unless you are SO lame that you run some executable in the package for some reason. 
Just watch the movie."
