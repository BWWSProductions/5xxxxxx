HAPPY DAYS - COMPLETE SEASON 5


This was one of the most popular TV series ever made, with millions viewers tuning in every week. To this day, it's as funny as ever and pretty hard to get hold of!

Quality is not fantastic - all TV rips - a bit grainy with average audio quality, and there are adverts still there that I haven't had time to take out, but still watchable.

Now for the boring bit - PLEASE stay on and seed as long as you can. As far as I am aware this is the only torrent in existence for season 5, and everyone deserves a chance to see it.

I seed new torrents exclusively overnight, the rest during the day, so please be patient if your download is initially slow - you WILL get it!

ENJOY - your comments are always appreciated.
