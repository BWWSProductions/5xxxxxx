A look at some of the evidence that
lead to claims that British authorities
maltreated prisoners of war after WWII.

Some of this abuse seems to have been to
gain evidence for the War Crimes' trials.
But it was also applied to encourage some
people - people who should have been on
trial - to work for the British authorities.
