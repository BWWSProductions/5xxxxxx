,fauxartist,2010-06-20T02:18Z,"Say friend...wondered if you were going to maybe do the classic horror films too..like 'The Tingler', etc. ... those seem to be about as hard to find as the ones you posted. 
My vid files are now complete thanks to your contribution to us 'Bad B Movie' fans.
Love them...."

Your very welcome!  Enjoy!"
,fauxartist,2010-06-20T02:46Z,"this is also another rarely known classic that scared the crap out of me, and is determined by some to be the original story line for 'Alien'...

It! The Terror from Beyond Space"

Yep, I have The Tingler and many other Classic Horror.  I thought I saw Tingler on The Bay.  Lemmi check..

Thanks and enjoy!!"

Like I thought..there is a rip of The Tingler already on The Bay and it's actually a better version it seems.

I did dig up your other request though....=)"
