[T],FatFreddy69,2011-05-26T12:53Z,"This fake BRRip 720p was ripped/upscaled/and frame rate changed from 25 to 23.976 to look more genuine BRRip.
The source is a Hungarian DVD release (4.29GB): 
Otis.Pokoli.Tevedes.2008.HUN.PAL.DVDR-L20
Exactly the same errors (about 30 seconds long) are in the same place as the dvd, see image bellow:

Go to hell all the fakers and stick up your bum all your shitty 720p BRRIPS.
