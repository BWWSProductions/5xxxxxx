Here is a Rare and great performence from the Bee Gees in 1974.

Its Pro Shot and Sounboard Recording

I rip the DVD and seperate it for Ipod format at the best quality possible.

If you experience a lot of distortion with the sound, check your EQ level and sound on your Ipod cause the sound is pretty punchy the way it is right now.

I will upload a format for DVD pretty soon!!!

This is truly a must see for bee gees fans 

The Highlight is for sure the classic songs of them.


Enjoy and Share!!!
