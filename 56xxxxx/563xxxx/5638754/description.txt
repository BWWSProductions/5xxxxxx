One of the best practical software for road design engineers. WORKS ONLY UNDER AUTOCAD 2005!!!

With MXroad you can easily design the horizontal and vertical alignments, pavement and all road parts including generating profiles and joints design.

It based on BSi (British Standard)but works fine with AASHTO and any other code like EC or Russian SNIP.
