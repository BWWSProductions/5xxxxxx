Kurt Vonnegut holds a cherished place on the bookshelves of literary enthusiasts and those who celebrate his insightful, distinctly American, and unapologetically humanistic brand of humor. A piece of Vonnegutâ€™s early fiction, â€œConfidoâ€ tells the story of a middle-class family whose lives are set off-kilter by a near-magical device.
