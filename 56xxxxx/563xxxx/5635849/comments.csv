,mrluckyman,2010-06-19T02:14Z,"i would like to request 'We're back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993)', 'Race the Sun (1996)', and 'Fletch (1985)'"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-06-19T07:58Z,nice release thanks and will you tell your group tater44 to be exact to seed for the movie the rundown he released earlier please we are stuck without the seeder............
[T],ctang,2010-06-19T20:45Z,tater said that he doesnt know how to reseed and so will probably just upload it again in a whole new torrent...he didnt tell me that but i read it on a torrent of either his or MM's...hope that helps
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-20T07:43Z,"i see you want to post Donnie Darko.

do you have S.Darko?  that would be GREATLY appreciated!"
[T],ctang,2010-06-20T07:58Z,"yo zombifuzz, havent heard from ya in a while...how ya doing...anyway, i only have donie darko because i had to watch it for a class over the summer...if i can find it i will upload it too though"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-20T23:59Z,"i know it has been a while.  its all good.  some random dvd-r uploader just posted it.  kinda weird right after i asked.  never heard of the guy.  i dont know if i should give it a shot or not....

i probably wont."
,omegafox84,2010-06-21T01:45Z,"@zombifuzz: hey, my other screen name is akira900gt. i just made this omegafox84 account to do some uploads for people. i saw you really wanted S Darko and ctang didn't have it, so i uploaded it for you.

@ctang: if you want i can upload Donnie Darko as i have that also. still looking forward to Forrest Gump and Don't Be A Menace. also, if you're looking for any particular movies let me know. if i have them, i can upload for you since you're doing a couple for me."
[T],ctang,2010-06-21T06:21Z,"@omegafox84: i will be upping it very soon but if you want you can...go for it...lol...i will be upping those other two movies either later tonight or early tomorrow!!!

@zombi: tell me how the download goes...i was thinking about downloading it and then upping it along with donie darko but only if its a quality upload

this has been completed like 20 times and nobody is seeding but me...wtf...this is bullshit"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-21T06:41Z,i will let you know
[T],ctang,2010-06-21T07:14Z,"zombi: thanks bud

well i just found out that the Forrest Gump is Pal and not NTSC...my dvd player must be region free because it plays fine...i am in the process of acquiring an NTSC version since i said i would upload it...will have it up asap...next will Dont Be A Menace...sorry about that guys...for some reason i actually feel bad"
[T],ctang,2010-06-21T07:20Z,"i dont like doing this but i can make a custom dvd-r out of the Pal Forrest Gump and convert it to NTSC, which i have done in the past with excellent quality for the output...let me know people and you shall receive

i really want to add that there will be no menu's but there should be at least different languages that are on the Pal disc...i also want to let people know that i dont condone this bc i really like to do full dvd-r's and not custom dvd-r's"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-21T08:20Z,"S. Darko was perfect.  not a thing wrong with it.  all menus, special features, fast DL speed.  i recommend it.

he seems like he knows what he's doing."
,omegafox84,2010-06-21T08:47Z,"@ctang: i'll just let you do it since you were going to anyways. maybe after you upload Donnie Darko you could post your link on the S Darko page and i vice versa? it's up to you though. it's ok if Forrest Gump is in PAL as i have a dvd player that plays it but some people might not be able to. also, i don't mind if the dvd has extras, menus, etc., but it's definitely a plus. that sucks about people not seeding."
[T],ctang,2010-06-21T23:28Z,ok sounds good...im about to put up Dont be a menace and then Donnie Darko will be up...will definitely post the link for S Darko on it!!!
