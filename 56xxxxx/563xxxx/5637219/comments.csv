,BoRealBobadilla,2010-08-19T04:30Z,"@kl20: Windows User: Forget QuickTime player it's old, unreliable, slow, and basically feature-less. Get an updated player such as Realplayer or Windows Media Player 11.
           Mac User: QuickTime can often not support many types of audio codecs (personally, I think Apple is to lazy to incorporate this -.-.....). But since you're using a Mac you don't have a lot of options, but here they are: (Most recent QuickTime player) Open the file, click Window -> Show movie info. This will let you know what audio codec you are not capable of playing. Option #2: (Mac USER ONLY): AVI files are relatively old (now the most common we see are FLV, MP4, WMV, etc...) therefore QuickTime does not have the incorporated updates for it. The best solution for you is to download this free program from http://perian.org/ which serves as a type of an ""update"" for QuickTime which will give it support for many types of codecs QuickTime does not have. All you have to do is open the disk image and click the icon.

Please report back if having issues, I'll be glad to help if needed and please report back if this did or did not work, as I'm curious to investigate. Hope all goes well! :)"

,kl20,2010-08-19T15:20Z,"Worked like a charm!! Thank you so much. I was hoping it wasn't the files I was downloading from here, that they were malware or something. You've just made my day, thank you for your help. "
,DerNik,2010-08-19T22:05Z,"Are there still people who don't use VLC? It is by far the best media player I've ever used to view films. http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ As they say on the website: ""It plays everything!"""
