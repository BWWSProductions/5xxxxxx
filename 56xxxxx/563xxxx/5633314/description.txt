Comments :
SPOILER. REVEALS ENDING! Following the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 Chief Warrant Officer 
Roy Miller and his men are charged with finding the so-called weapons of mass destruction,whose 
existence justified American involvement,according to the Pentagon and their man in Baghdad,
Poundsgate. Veteran CIA operative Marty tells Miller that there are no weapons,it is a deception 
to allow the Americans to take over the country and install a puppet leader. Marty correctly 
anticipates that,despite Bush's gung-ho assurances, the policy is doomed to failure. Also 
suspicious of Poundsgate is Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne,who lets slip to Miller 
that Poundsgate told her he had secret talks in Jordan with an important Iraqi,code-named Magellan,
who told him about the weapons, though it now seems likely Magellan's true information was to the 
contrary. Miller deduces that Magellan is General Al Rawi, a close supporter of the deposed Saddam 
Hussain and, accompanied by his interpreter, Freddy, a decent Iraqi who only wants stability for 
his country, sets out to track down Al Rawi. However, Poundsgate's men are also on Al Rawi's trail,
to stop him from talking. After an explosive showdown Miller emails Lawrie to tell her that there 
never were any weapons,relying on her and other journalists to inform the world of Bush's deception.
