This is video I took at the concert I went to last night. It's shakey, grainy, and dark, the audio is pretty clear, if you like the band download it and give it a look. I didn't make this to be quality I was just having a good time at the show. Anyway. Enjoy and please seed. Also if you're gonna make comments just don't bash it's not nice :P Peace Out.

Also Sorry about the crap upload speed, My ISP is having issues. Just Hang in there you will get it all. Please help and Seed when you finish. thanx.
