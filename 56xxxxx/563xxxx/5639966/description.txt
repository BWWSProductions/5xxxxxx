From Wiki:

Daniel G. Amen, M.D. is a child and adult psychiatrist, self-help guru, bestselling author and medical director of the Amen Clinic. He has done a great deal of work in evaluating psychiatric and neurological patients with the help of SPECT scanning, especially in the area of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and has received an award from the American Psychiatric Association but has also been roundly criticized for expounding experimental and unproven methodology and treatment.

Some scientists and medical professionals have criticized the scientific validity of Amen's work, claiming that there are no definitive clinical studies supporting his claims. In response, Dr. Amen has increased the number of references in his latest book Change Your Brain Change Your Body. However, the review of this book in the American Journal of Psychiatry underscores the fact that "he has not subjected his treatment approaches to the level of systematic scientific scrutiny expected for scientifically based medical practice".

Neurologist Michael Greicius, who runs the Stanford University memory clinic said "SPECT scans are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to be useful in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease...The PBS airing of Amen's program provides a stamp of scientific validity to work which has no scientific validity."

In 2005, on Quackwatch.org a nonprofit organization that investigates what they consider health-related frauds, myths, fads and fallacies, Dr. Harriet Hall, a retired military physician, was far more strident and bellicose in her 
criticism:

"Amen's recommendations defy science, common sense and logic. I feel much worse about him now than I did when I wrote the piece because I went back and looked at his Web site again, and I'm just appalled by some of the things that are on it now. He's selling vitamin supplements and he's selling his own line of products. He's turned into big business."

Dr. Amen has responded by saying that,

"The Amen Clinics tracks treatment response among its patients. 85% of our patients report a high degree of satisfaction with our services. We are not a typical psychiatric clinic. We typically see patients who have failed 3 or 4 other mental health professionals, and who have an average of 3.5 psychiatric disorders using standard DSM diagnostic measures. No one keeps response rates on such a complex diagnostic group, yet our results are very encouraging."
