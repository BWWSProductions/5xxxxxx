,Ghw16xxx,2011-02-11T14:42Z,"According to Wikipedia, ""new information indicates that this movie is one of two films that will have their official opening dates delayed until 2011 as a result of 'transaction between [Miramax] owner Disney and soon-to-be new owners, construction magnate Ron Tutor and Tom Barrack's Santa Monica-based Colony Capital (led by former Disney CFO Richard Nanula), which won't be finalized until the end of the year or soon after'."""

Thanks @noriegaRJ for the english subtitles link!"
