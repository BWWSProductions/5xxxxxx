Synopsis

â€œTrashedâ€ is a provocative investigation of one of the fastest growing industries in North America. The garbage business. The film examines a fundamental element of modern American cultureâ€¦the disposal of what our society defines as â€œwaste.â€ It is an issue influenced by every American, most of whom never consider the consequences. Nor, it seems, the implications to our biosphere. At times humorous, but deeply poignant, â€œTrashedâ€ examines the American waste stream fast approaching a half billion tons annually.

What are the effects all this waste will have on already strained natural resources? Why is so much of it produced? While every American creates almost 5 pounds of it every day, who is affected most? And who wants America to make more?

The film analyzes the causes and effects of the seemingly innocuous act of â€œtaking out the garbageâ€ while showcasing the individuals, activists,corporate and advocacy groups working to affect change and reform the current model. â€œTrashedâ€ is an informative and thought-provoking film everyone interested in the future of sustainability should see.
