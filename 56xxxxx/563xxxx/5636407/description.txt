The Battle of Neretva begins in 1943 right in the middle of things, with the Partisans already on the run from the combined forces of the German and Italian armies, as well as an immense force of Chetnik raiders (monarchists allied with the Germans).

Battle of Neretva is the most expensive motion picture made in the SFR Yugoslavia and It was nominated for an Academy Award.

This film is the Yugoslavian equivalent of The Longest Day, made in USA, in which Germans were treated as they were -- human beings and professional soldiers who did their job despite the failure of their high command.
