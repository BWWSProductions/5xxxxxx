Stan Lee Meets was a limited non-canonical Marvel Comics series in which comic book writer Stan Lee  met one of the characters he has created in each issue. The series was written by Stan Lee himself and was used to celebrate his 65th year as a Marvel Comics employee. The series is marked for its tongue-in-cheek humor and the comic book characters' general dislike of Stan Lee. The series contains five issues in which Stan Lee meets Spider-Man, The Thing, Doctor Doom, Doctor Strange, and the Silver Surfer. Each issue also contained reprints of issues from each character's respective comic. An issue in which Stan meets Professor Xavier and Magneto was included with the DVD edition of X-Men: The Last Stand.
