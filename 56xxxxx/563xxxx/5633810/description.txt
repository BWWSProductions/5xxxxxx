Hey everyone,

I've created an vuvuzela ringtone package. You know, the annoying vuvuzela that is irritating soccer fans all over the world. 

This is an composed ringtone package. It exists out of several extensions. For every mobile phone there should an fitting extension. But I guess that all mobile phones used now-a-days are capable of handling mp3 ringtones. But for the phones that doesn't support mp3 there are some other extensions that might work. 

Here below you can see which extensions are available, you get them all if you download the package, but thay don't take in much space. 

vuvuzela-ringtone.ogg
vuvuzela-ringtone.amr
vuvuzela-ringtone.m4r
vuvuzela-ringtone.mp3
Vuvuzela-2-ringtone.mp3


If you want to know how to put them on you're phone, check your phone manual :). 



Thanx for downloading!

And have fun with the ringtones!
