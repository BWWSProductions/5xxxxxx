,bigdeal,2010-06-17T18:50Z,"Finally I found a good ringtone thanks to you. Until now i couldn't find a vuvuzela recognizable. 

Thank youuuu"
,fang,2010-06-17T18:55Z,"This vuvuzela trumpet is really annoying people. But why are they bothering, it's an african tradition, and the world cup is played there so. In Africa that's main ""music"" source, and here, we are all enjoying some hifi surround sets. 

So i think it's kinda funny, annoying the people with their expensive stereo sets."

,googlybug,2010-07-02T22:12Z,"This is a password protected rar file. The password is not TIMENFRISOZIJNCOOL. You have to go to a dodgy site to get password. 
Do not download. Do not seed. "
