Tori Amos
June 11th, 2010
Bonnaroo Music Festival


DVD of Tori's complete set at Bonnaroo on June 11th, 2010.  Portions of the show were webcast on Those videos and amateur video that was posted toby fans in attendance were combined/mixed.  All video was resynced to the NPR soundboard broadcast (full show).

Silent All These Years is audio only - no video of that song has surfaced.  

Time lapse nature footage is present along w/ Tori's audio in a few places where video was unavailable (mostly for a few seconds between songs and for Silent All These Years).

Please seed - I won't be on here much past the 4gigs this DVD is. 

This is a FREE fan made DVD.

Hope some enjoy.  Menu Screens and Setlist:
