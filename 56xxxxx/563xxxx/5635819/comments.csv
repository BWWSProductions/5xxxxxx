,nccong,2010-06-20T13:44Z,I use freeware VLC to play MKV files. You can try it yourself.
,Redperil,2010-06-21T00:53Z,"I agree with nccong, VLC is the best universal player out there and its free. 

The container format MKV is superior to AVI in many ways:

* supports H.264/AVC
* B-Frame support
* supports variable audio bitrate
* supports chapters, muxed subtitles, metadata/tags and dvd-like menus
The greatest advantage of MKV over AVI for instance is its support of H.264/AVC, which is needed for efficient HD content playback, Xvid/DivX are not suitable!!"
