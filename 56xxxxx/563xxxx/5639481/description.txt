OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------

As Kitiara, the feared Blue Lady, sets in motion a plot that will take three Solamnic knights to Icereach in search of a dragon orb, her rival, Laurana, begins a journey toward destiny when she and her friends Sturm, Flint, and Tasslehoff, join the knights in their perilous quest.

But it is Kitiara who faces the crucial test. She vows to spend the night in the most feared place on Krynn -- Dargaard Keep, the dwelling of the death knight Lord Soth. No one who has ever ventured into that dread place has returned alive to tell about it. But Kit must either face Soth or face her own execution at the hands of her Queen.

The Companions Are Back -- but so are their enemies!
