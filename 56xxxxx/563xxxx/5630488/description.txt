In May 2007, Adam Krier and Jason Schultejann (respectively guitarist and bassist of Lucky Boys Confusion), together with new drummer Chris Smith (15 Minutes Late/Logan Square), formed a side project known as American Taxi. Their first single "The Mistake" was launched on Memorial Day 2007 on their newly formed MySpace page. American Taxi has since released an EP entitled Runaway Songs, containing "The Mistake" and five other tracks.
In April 2009 American Taxi was signed to Virgin Records]. Since the band's name so closely resembled bluegrass group Great American Taxi, they are now being referred to as AM Taxi until further notice.

â€œOur goal is to take that 45 or 60 minutes and let people get away for a little bit,â€ says Adam. â€œAnd maybe even convert some of â€˜em to AM Taxi fans. And, if they dig what weâ€™re doing, maybe theyâ€™ll check out some of the stuff that influenced us.â€

Show support; see a show, tell a friend, buy a shirt.  MySpace doesn't pay the bills.
I'll personally seed this at 300kB/s (bytes, folks) for at minimum one month.
