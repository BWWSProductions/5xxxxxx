Collection of instrumental pieces composed by Tim Jones, the composer for the TV show Chuck.

Note: Not all of these pieces are from Chuck, but most of them are (he reuses pieces from other shows in Chuck)

For example, rooftop pickup and the dark side are recognizable from Chuck, and the theme in space cowboys seems to be a variation on that familiar theme in chuck, the triumphant trumpet theme that plays when he's beating up bad guys. If anyone has this please link me to it.

Note, in the ID3 tags for the pieces from Chuck, the 6-digit sequence of numbers refers to the time in the episode that the piece plays, e.g. for chuck_311 (271329) that piece plays in s03e11 at 27:13:29
