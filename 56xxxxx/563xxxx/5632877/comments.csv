Jamie: ""I shure do, it reminds med of when I was a concrete inspector. We used to... and bla bla"" 

*Picture fades to an old clip that they have shown a hundred times before*

Adam: ""That was a cool explosion we did bak then. Almost as fun as the time when we got drunk and made out whilst doing that drinking and cold myth.""
Jamie: ""Uuuh, eeem I thought we uuuh agreed never to talk about that... incident.""
Adam: ""Oh yeah... But you were right that time. With enough lubrication you can fit anything into anyone."""

[T],Zverik,2011-02-20T14:18Z,"This is the worst recap episode I've ever seen. ""We liked this, we liked that..."" Not being constant watcher, I just wanted to see what the show is about, and instead I get 1.5 hours of stupid chattering."
