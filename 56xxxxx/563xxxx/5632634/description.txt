A talented, but distracted photographer, Lola, on the verge of success in both love and work, could lose it all if she doesnâ€™t make it to a crucial meeting on time. But, as usual, Lola is late. With her job and girlfriend on the line, she has three chances to make it right. In a desperate race through the streets and back rooms of San Francisco, time grows short-will Lola make it? Will she come at all? With a pop sensibility that mixes live action, animation and still photography, And Then Came Lola explores loveâ€™s age old question in a fresh new way, â€œIf you try, try again, will you finally get it right?â€
