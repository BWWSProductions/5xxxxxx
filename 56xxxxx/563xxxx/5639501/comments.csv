,gaaraisgod,2011-07-30T05:18Z,"Nujabes made some of the most chilled beats to ever grace hip-hop.

Thanks for this."
,Funkdr.,2011-09-21T07:09Z,"This is the ultimate Nujabes collection.

This discography is complete, minus 1 or 2 remixes, and is almost entirely in 320kb. It also includes lots of other works i had incorrectly attributed to Nujabes and all of the Samurai Champloo soundtracks. 

If Nujabes' work was available for sale in the US or online, i would have bought it but the only way is to import it at $50 a pop. This was a lifesaver."

,TeamNeo,2012-04-24T03:34Z,Nujabes is a boss. Please seed and buy this now!
