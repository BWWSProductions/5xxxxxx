,thomast77,2011-01-25T10:15Z,There are too many files here?? According to Amazon there should be 95 songs. Did you add something extra?
,thomast77,2011-01-25T12:08Z,"OK I went through all the files and rearranged them in their original order so I can put them on discs. I found 6 files that do not belong. 3 files in the Piano Concerto no. 21 in C major folder:

04. [Rosina LhÃ©vinne, piano -- Juilliard Orchestra (Morel)] I. Allegro maestoso.flac

05. [Rosina LhÃ©vinne, piano -- Juilliard Orchestra (Morel)] II. Romance.flac

06. [Rosina LhÃ©vinne, piano -- Juilliard Orchestra (Morel)] III. Rondo. Allegro assai.flac

and 3 files in the Piano Concerto no. 10 in E-flat major folder:

04. [Lyubov Bruk, Mark Taimanov, pianos -- Leningrad Chamber Orchestra (Gozman)] I. Allegro.flac

05. [Lyubov Bruk, Mark Taimanov, pianos -- Leningrad Chamber Orchestra (Gozman)] II. Andante.flac

06. [Lyubov Bruk, Mark Taimanov, pianos -- Leningrad Chamber Orchestra (Gozman)] III. Rondo. Allegro.flac

Also some of the files are mislabeled which made it a chore to rearrange back into the proper order. I still need to listen to them to make sure they are the correct music. Any reason why these were taken out of their proper order?"
,Hopf,2011-01-31T07:14Z,"thomast77, those extra files were an oversight. To future downloaders, feel free to deselect them if your client allows such functionality.

Could you elaborate on the mislabeling? The folder structure of my torrents comes directly from my personal collection, and the lack of original CD track order is merely a personal preference.

As an alternative, the uploaders at http://boxset.ru/ have the entire Phillips Mozart collection (including this particular set) in the form of CD images and cue sheets. I couldn't recommend them more, and that may be what you are looking for."
