Rawley Taylor - The Country Boy In Me
He's still marooned out on that island in the Baltic
This song came fourth in the final of the Swedish Radio contest Svensktoppen nÃ¤sta, Gotland section - there were only five songs in the final.......
These Swedes have no taste.....and definitely no sense of humour!!
