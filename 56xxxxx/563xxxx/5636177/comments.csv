,illiria,2010-06-21T14:46Z,"Okay, many comments. Let's see.

@ Bacofox

I'm not sure whether this is for US version only or not, because I have tested only on my, english version of Mass Effect 2. But as far as I know - DLCs are localized for all versions upon release, so yes - in theory it should be compatible with all versions of the game.

@ BenLinus

It has never contained any trojans, don't be a moron - I would not seed 44 gigabytes of trojans. Switch your anti-virus for a better one.

@ tgun99

If you got ""Failed to authenticate disc"" error, then for some reason, last step of executing commands (which is copying the crack to game folder) has failed. I have never encountered that problem before, but yes, it can be fixed by simply downloading a crack.

I have just checked the commands in my project - it is clearly stated to wait until the crack is copied. Something must have caused the command to skip or has broken it during installation. Could be an anti-virus, for whatever reason. Again, I have never encountered that problem.

@ Morvor

The window likely freezes because the file is very big, and your hard drive is loading it. It may take time to load such a big file, try waiting.

@ kevlar26

No, you cant install them individually. Your other DLCs won't be ""affected"" exactly, but they all will be cracked. The patch cracks all the DLCs you have installed, regardless of where did you get them. So if you plan to use DLCs illegally, the patch will crack them all anyway. So in that perspective, no, the DLC Pack itself will overwrite your DLCs, but with same files - won't affect anything. The patch, however, will. No matter where do you get it.

I think I've covered all? :) have any questions - ask away. I will reply whenever I have the time (very busy with other projects). Enjoy people. And I'm glad to see many seeders - thank you very much."
,MoleUK,2010-06-21T15:34Z,Any idea how to change the path registry for mass effect 2? The authorizer is not working because I had a steam version installed and runmasseffect2 comes up with Could not find mass effect 2 directory.
,MoleUK,2010-06-21T15:39Z,Just to clarify - I formerly had a steam version installed. Not using that version right now but I assume the former install is screwing with the authorisation patch.
,1kokolo1,2010-06-21T17:36Z,Does the crack work on windows 7 64-bit. Former ones worked only when I was disconnected from the internet.
,Morvor,2010-06-21T23:10Z,"Well...I do have a pretty slow hard drive. That's probably the case.

,illiria,2010-06-23T10:23Z,"@ Morvor

When you open the file, it shows you a window. you click ""Next"" - it shows you the readme. Then you click ""Install"" and all done. So its actually two buttons, not one. :) Still, Windows does need to scan the file first, so that might be the case. Otherwise, I just don;t know.

@ whitevil

My installer does not require a directory selection. Just like official patches, it reads the directory path from the registry. If you are missing it (corrupted install/some repack), then you can't install DLCs or patches ANYWAY, because they all check for that registry key. In other words, even if I had the directory selection pazge, the patches wouldn't install anyway, due to your mising registry key. Fix your corrupted installation.

The DLCs work when I am not connected to the Internet. Is there a fix for this? I don't mind not being able to connect to EA Online, but not being able to have internet access at all while playing makes this deal not quite worthwhile.

,Key_Tap,2010-06-23T13:57Z,"I hate to comment three times in a row, but I've found a simple fix, but it requires one of two things:

@ Thatguy4600

Well, as I said, for some reason the crack did not get copied at the end of an installation. It might be an issue with permissions in Windows. Do you use a guest account instead of admin on your computer? Either way, most likely it is something wrong with Windows itself, because I unpack the crack into Temp folder, then run a command to copy it, that's all. If Windows cannot perform that simple task, then there's something wrong with it.
And yes, issue isn;t in my installer. I've checked all the scripts, everything is fine and works. I don't know why do you have this issue. Just look up for a crack on gthe web then. Not a big problem."
,illiria,2010-06-26T15:56Z,"@ Chaos7777

Wrong advice. This crack you linked to is the same crack I use, I have simply made a shell for it. So if the crack in my torrent doesn't work, this one won't either. They are the same."

,corpsepaint1991,2010-08-29T01:47Z,well i ve been playing dragon age (same company) for a while. i downloaded dlc several times and after installation we had to change addins.xml file. each authorization value from 1 to 0. there is no such thing in this game. it would be easier like that. now im forever having authentication error. the crack blocking patch didnt work for me. can that happen bcoz of the region u c im not in usa(turkey). in dao i change my location into usa. somebody please solve this damn problem soo many people suffer i guess
,dixiedog,2010-08-29T03:19Z,"So I keep getting this message ""cannot locate mass effect 2 directory after the installation produre is complete and I click on runmasseffect2.  Can someone help me fix this? It would be such a shame to let this DLC pack go unused. Thanks"
,Vegita,2010-08-29T21:21Z,"Works fine, THANK YOU illria, you are the best :)"
,EvilAsh34,2010-09-02T22:52Z,"Works Great, All DLC works. Thanks for such an easy install too!

One (premature) question though. Do you think your repack will work with the new DLC Lair of the Shadowbroker? If not will you be offering a new ""repack"" with it included? 

I just worry that if i use someone else's version of LotSB that it will fuck something up. Any insight into the situation is appreciated. : )"
,pirate_bay.org,2010-09-03T20:36Z,Some one please tell me is there a way to change default installation directory....... help 
,dixiedog,2010-09-03T21:50Z,"@ pirate_bay.org

,Zeigh,2010-09-06T19:07Z,"Can anyone help me?
I can't seem to run Project Overlord. When I land on the planet where it starts, the game freezes.
Also, Project Firewalker didn't get installed in the game. Got no mails, journal updates about it. No new systems either. 
The other dlc-s work fine though."
,masterofvolus1211,2010-09-07T19:01Z,guys please seed more.....everyone is seeding less than 0.1 kb/s.... if you completed is better to seed than to let it rot.godspeed!THX 
,EvilAsh34,2010-09-09T16:03Z,"@EvilAsh34/Me

To answer my own question. This DLC Pack _is_ compatible with more recent ones. (Aegis, Firepower and LotSB). 

You just need to use the giveme2entitlements.exe to get them working."
,Monoris,2010-09-10T19:46Z,"Hi Guys,
I have a problem after 1st facility when im just about to ride to 2nd one the game crashes ;/ ;/ ;/ I have same problem with Shadow broker DLC from another user... any1 have same problem? know how to fix this?"
,lorelai2009,2010-09-12T07:33Z,"Thank you soooo much for this! It worked perfectly for me, I never managed to get any other DLC pack to work, I'm so happy for all the goodies!  Thanks again for sharing this with us!"
,demmydemon,2010-09-12T21:08Z,"Uh, nice trojan....

Before anyone says ""CRACKS GIVE FALSE POSITIVES, NEWB"", run this and check out these files:
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Temp\wareg51.exe
C:\Windows\Tasks\At1.job
C:\Windows\Tasks\At2.job"
,EvilAsh34,2010-09-13T16:45Z,"@demmydemon

C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Temp\wareg51.exe
C:\Windows\Tasks\At1.job
C:\Windows\Tasks\At2.job

OK, I checked out my system for these files (no hidden files there), scanned my system with NOD32 (clean) and washed behind my ears (not so clean). There is no trojan with this that I can find. Maybe you picked it up from somewhere else?

,blackpawzz,2010-09-13T20:40Z,"stay away from this. it does (tries to do) nasty things to your registry, firewall, virus-scanner"
,Death214,2010-09-15T18:24Z,"Nonsense,i downloaded this file months ago,and everything is still fine.Those guys must have been on some questionable porn sites,and then blamed it on the download when they got chewed out..."
,k-line,2010-09-18T22:17Z,i guess the moral of the story is: don't use custom installer!
,Hush420,2010-09-26T20:11Z,My only complaint so far is that during a part of the Overlord mission the whole game crashes. I'm not sure if this is just a PC version issue or a problem with the DLC.
,gino1965,2010-09-26T20:28Z,"Works perfect! No issues, no virus, trojan etc. Thank you so much Illiria!! God bless you.

Should I delete it? "
,Arrakiz,2010-12-31T18:35Z,"All of you guys- this is important!- Befor you run the exe. you have to turn off the conection with cerberus network in your mass effect-->options-->internet. If you don't it will either not install at all, not work properly, or (worst case scenario) CORRUPT your game files. I'm guessing that's the reason for your various problems, but then again i might be wrong. Enyway i just wanted to help."
,kebabonline5233,2011-01-15T05:39Z,"Works perfectly! Didn't really trust it at first, seemed odd. But had absolutely no problems!

It takes about 2-5 Minutes to load

Just install game
Turn off the internet things that is mentioned everywhere! (Extras, internet upload yada yada)
Install DLC
move the entitles.exe thing to binaries, and execute.
Then get latest patch (1.02) crack. easiest to find on www.gamecopyworld.com press world #1-10 search in the right column for Mass Effect 2 and Grab the first.

Replace in with current .exe file in BINARIES then make shortcut from that file wherever you want it, and GL HF!"
