In response to the family's strong desire for a positive change in their life, Jillian helps empower them to be successful in their pursuit of healthy living. During Jillian's stay with them she surprises Ruth with a much needed night out to enjoy herself, joins the daughters for a workout with a college soccer team, showing them they can be active without a gym, and through a garage sale, helps rid the family of useless items.
