 Synopsis...........: One of the finest British films ever made, 
		      this benchmark of â€œkitchen-sink realismâ€ 
		      follows the self-defeating professional and 
		      romantic pursuits of a miner turned rugby player 
		      eking out an existence in drab Yorkshire. 
		      With an astonishing, raging performance by a young 
		      Richard Harris, an equally blistering turn by fellow 
		      Oscar nominee Rachel Roberts as the widow with whom he 
		      lodges, and electrifying direction by Lindsay Anderson, 
		      in his feature-film debut following years of documentary 
		      work, This Sporting Life remains a dramatic powerhouse.
