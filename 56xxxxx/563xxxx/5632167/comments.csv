,in_dg94,2011-06-28T19:01Z,"Ill never understand some people.  They complain about not having 5.1 or 1920 quality.

I bet they bitch because their 1977 Chevy Chevette gets beat off the line by a Ferrari too, right?

Ridiculous.  1/2 GB download = outstanding quality for a laptop computer"

I just love your uploads with small sizes but still great quality!"
