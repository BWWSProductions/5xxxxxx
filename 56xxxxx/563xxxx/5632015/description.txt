From the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team (F.A.R.T.) comes this excellent quality video with the original soundtrack restored!

As you probably know, DVD's of season three of The Fugitive were released with a completely new, synthesized music score
which destroyed much of the show's drama.

Now, thanks to the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team, you can enjoy the show in top quality
as it was originally intended to be experienced.

The Fugitive
Season Three, Episode 23
The Chinese Sunset

Original Air Dateâ€”1 March 1966

In one of the least interesting of the 120 episodes of the entire series,
Kimble helps a beautiful young woman raise her self-esteem.

David Janssen ... Dr. Richard Kimble
Laura Devon ... Penelope Dufour
Paul Richards ... Eddie Slade
Ned Glass ... Sam
Wayne Rogers ... Fred Bragin

(Much of the incidental and background music
was restored)

There's an interesting continuity error in this episode. In Act IV,
keep an eye on Penelope's "beauty mark."
