High-flying, adored! The film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical depicting the infamous real-life story of Eva "Evita" Duarte de Peron, the wife of President Juan Peron, who rose from poverty to become the most famous Argentine woman in history. Her huge political influence and constant charity works earned her scorn and fear from the military and upper classes but adoration and love from the workers and descamisados. Evita's legendary life is displayed before your eyes as the most hated and most beloved woman in Argentina.


Production and casting:
Discussion of the film production began soon after the original 1978 London production was staged. Several actresses were considered for the role. At one point, Lloyd Webber favoured an actress of Spanish descent to play the lead role and suggested Charo. Then Meryl Streep was offered the role, but production was delayed. Meanwhile, Madonna had been campaigning for the part but when Parker was ready for filming, several people[who?] objected to Madonna playing the part. Cher, Barbra Streisand, Glenn Close, Olivia Newton-John and Michelle Pfeiffer were rumored to be involved. Pfeiffer, who recorded a number of demo tracks, was almost cast, but director Alan Parker wanted to shoot the picture on location, not in Pfeiffer's preferred Hollywood sound studio. Patti LuPone was not offered to reprise her original role as Evita. As an actress in her forties she was deemed too old to play the part of Eva Peron. When the lead of Eva was announced, Madonna, Patti LuPone was asked to play the role of Eva's mother, but she declined.

Filming began on February 1996 and it finished in May. Midway through production, Madonna discovered she was pregnant with daughter Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon who was born on October 14, 1996.
