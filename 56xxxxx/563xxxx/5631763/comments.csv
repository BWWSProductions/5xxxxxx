,matyi5,2010-06-22T11:37Z,hogyan kell csinálni torrentet?nem a játék érdekel!
,necrocide,2010-07-25T11:11Z,so I guess the real question is: Does it work properly or what?? Or should I just risk a couple gig BW on it? 
,antiy4ho0,2010-08-01T11:04Z,"Hm...game is in russian? Pretty sure other languages were ripped, I don't speak russian so I can't confirm but I can't get the game in any other language.  Wish this was not labeled as english if thats the case. "

,rajeevrn,2011-03-03T13:40Z,"dear thenoobish,

,mihaihen,2011-04-05T03:01Z,How can i get an English pach for it?!? ps: the game seems ok... it's all in Russian do :(
,mitroi1987,2011-07-18T14:23Z,if u want in english add this id mitrash_D@yahoo.com
,0veX,2011-07-30T13:04Z,"Why do you bother writing in description ""Language: English"" if isn't actually. Unless you guys know Russian or got a patch or smt to make the game in English, DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS. You will waste your time. "

,Lucis10,2012-01-09T18:18Z,juuuuuuuuu
,ericcode,2012-03-10T07:07Z,"Russian sound effects too.

While I thank you Imitare for the english text, all speech in game remains Russian. Shortcuts are Russian.

@thenoobish This is Russian and not English. Anglophones should NOT download this. Does not seem to like English Windows either as all the icons have Russian text after it and that shows up all wrong."
