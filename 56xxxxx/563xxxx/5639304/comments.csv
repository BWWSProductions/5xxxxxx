Different size than the Equalizer pack downloaded from BioWare. The Overlord DLC executable was not infected."

Word to the wise, dude, you need to sort the torrents by seed, then you see all the most seeded torrents first, which are almost 100% certain to be clean. By default it's sorted by date. Sort it by seed and you won't be downloading this off the wall shit from people who don't have a record of uploading quality shit."
