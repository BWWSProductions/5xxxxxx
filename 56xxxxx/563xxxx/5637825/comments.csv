,wolfriilo,2010-06-19T17:09Z,"I tried uploading with ""Isao Tomita [...]"" as title but for some weird reason The Pirate Bay wrote it as ""Isamita"". I tried lots of different configurations , moving the name around in the title (e.g. putting it at the end) but it would still replace it by ""Isamita"" every time so I ended up by calling this torrent ""Tomita Isao [...]"".
Does anyone have an idea as to why this happened?"
