Thx!"
,PaceyPimps,2010-12-03T03:45Z,can you burn this to a dl dvd and use it as a dvd9?
,exaulted,2011-02-23T04:52Z,Are english subtitles embedded in the mkv? I hope so (I don't hear so good). The popular subtitle websites don't have subtitles for this release. I wish every movie release automatically included subtitles. They are such tiny little files but extremely useful things.
