Release Note 
for first release it's a pretty nice cam, has a bad crop and flicker noise etc, but still nice, well made a avs script withsome filters in it....tweaked the RGB, slightly changed the saturation on the source, didn't seem to bad, added a deblock filter added a sharpness filter, and a smoothness, it made the video look pretty damn good.... it took just over 9hours to encode but well worth it...looks pretty sweet if you ask me audio is lu untouched...many thanks good job 

Plot
