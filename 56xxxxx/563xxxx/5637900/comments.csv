,LigGeorge,2010-06-19T16:41Z,How can you watch this?(which glasses/screen)
,Blue_Ogre,2010-06-19T18:45Z,i'm guessing this is for people with 3d tv's or the special glasses you pay mega moneys for.
,LigGeorge,2010-06-19T19:45Z,"No,the sample is a simple file.Also 3D tvs costs about 1000euros(1250$) just like a 2D (good) 40"" TV :)"
,madhav_man,2010-06-20T03:30Z,Does it need red/ cyan glasses?
,jbysmith,2010-06-20T04:47Z,"No, per the comments it's field sequential; you'll need the shutter style glasses to see this properly, not the colored ones or the RealD's from the current movies."
,aloozar,2010-06-20T09:02Z,"This is not encoded correctly!!!

While its clear the source used is field sequential it has not been encoded that way. It sould be one frame left eye, one frame right eye. Anyone can play the avi in a movie player and pause it to see both left and right has been encoded into one frame.

I have nvidia 3d vision and it does not work. I have tried all possible settings."
,angrymole,2010-06-20T10:42Z,@aloozar ... good I'm glad I wasn't going mad.  I hope when this does come out in 3d on bluray that it'll work with my aging shutter glasses.  However they still need to use vga for sync even if you buy them now it seems?  I thought everything was dvi/hdmi now.
,EnemyDrone,2010-06-20T11:34Z,3D tv..lmao you fools will buy anything. SOme things should not be in 3d....95 percent of things should NOT be in tv. The buying public is very stupid...lol I need to be in the selling business
,bashprompt,2010-06-20T13:51Z,"IMAX 3D is latent 3D like RealD, this is in sequential frame which requires a Sony LED screen or a $300 sequential frame headset."
,CthePalmrose,2010-06-20T17:31Z,So can you watch this with out glasses or is the screen blurry?
,Mikee2185,2010-06-20T19:01Z,"i'm also curios whether this plays with nvidia vision (planning to buy soon). i think u need special player for it (WMP probably wont be enough). But which one? Anyone has experience with it? I know CyberLink PowerDVD 10 is ""3d ready"", but dunno if it can play this.."
,Mikee2185,2010-06-20T20:08Z,"downloaded, it has terrible sound. and it really looks like both streams merged."
,angrymole,2010-06-20T22:15Z,"@EnemyDrone ... well since I have and use my glasses for gaming, I'll use those same glasses for movies if available so yes I will!  I won't be investing in anything more until the prices drop and the standards are properly set.  I won't be downloading this torrent however, since it's not formatted correctly."

,topdrizzle,2010-06-21T09:59Z,Tried to watch using 3d Vision player and arcsoft ultra 3d. I appreciate the attempt but this is way to blurry. there is no depth as well.  
,BlackandBad,2010-06-22T04:14Z,My eyes hurt....watched the whole damn thing....sound was off by a few seconds....and really blurry...
,bloodpab481,2010-06-23T21:04Z,finally good copy you can watch it at supremem0vies.info if you want downloads slow tho a9 v 8
,jeeslim,2010-07-23T04:46Z,good
