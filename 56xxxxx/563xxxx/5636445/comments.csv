You can follow the update description on Google Code page
http://code.google.com/p/pcsx2/updates/list"
,xckx,2010-06-22T04:23Z,"You can just download the latest version from emucr.com

Its pointless to make torrents of svns anyway because there is usually a newer version the same or next day. 

They already have version 3229 3244 3249 3251 and the latest as of typing this 3260"
,AZkiller7,2010-06-22T13:58Z,"xckx, if you like to download from somewhere else, why did you get in here anyway?"
,xckx,2010-06-22T14:42Z,"Well its nothing against you, its nice that you take time to upload this for people but I thought I would save you some time of uploading them. And also help out others to get the latest version because poeple will come on here looking for pcsx2 and download this when newer versions are already out.

by the way 3263 is out"
,AZkiller7,2010-06-22T15:46Z,"it is pointless to download every single revision, i only upload when i see a bunch of improvements has been implemented"
