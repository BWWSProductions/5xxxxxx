,RavenLabs,2010-06-19T20:43Z,Is this the real deal? And does it require a crack or anything.
,RDCMrT,2010-06-19T20:58Z,"Yeah ... a trusted uploader that would upload a game that won't work and exculde the crack from it.

,xiIix,2010-06-22T08:52Z,"They need new cover art. That looks way too generic. If I saw that in a store I'd think it was one of those noname shooters that costs $5. They need a new font, new render ect.."
,xiIix,2010-06-22T09:12Z,"Just played a few rounds with bots. This is going to be a pretty good step forward from counterstrike, that's for sure. The part that disappoints me, is that it uses the Source engine. I'm all for Source, but it's getting pretty long in the tooth without a major update don't you think? It needs to be able to compete with other engines, and it's falling behind on the eye candy. But, all that aside, the gameplay matters more, and if this gets a 5 star polish job like it should, then say hello to the new counter strike."
,orangechicken,2010-08-15T03:48Z,I can only play the mall map. No matter which map I type in to play it goes to the mall one. And are the weapons restricted?
