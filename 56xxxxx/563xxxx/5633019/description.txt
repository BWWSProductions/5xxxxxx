The current discography of the death metal band Torture Division. Quite good metal, and it's even free on their site, but it'd be too tedious to download every song individually, so I uploaded them here, with correct names, etc.

A couple of other notes: We Bring Upon Thee, With Endless Wrath, and Our Eternal Torture are meant to be listened to in that order. Although all of their releases are demos, the quality is phenomenal. Definitely check this out if you're a death metal fan.
