,AramYess,2011-11-02T01:07Z,"Guys Please help. I try to install and when it says, ""Please select the location to install Harry Potter"" not only do I not know where to put it. But whenever I try anything a pop-up comes up saying ""The item ""System"" cannot be found. Installation cannot continue"".
WHAT DO I DO??!?!? "
,nanoa,2011-11-02T03:37Z,"@Owlsigh. sadly, there is no fixing it. you need to start over. i did the same thing. my advice touch the save book before you hit that spell. that way, if it doesn't work, you can try again."
,jagovind,2011-12-21T20:51Z,"Please Seed. 
Come on Guys."
,pingunn,2012-01-12T22:32Z,"Guys, when i press -get this torrent- google chrome tells me it needs an external app to download it and that ""if i haven't specifically asked for this action myself, someone might be attacking my system"" -is this normal? i mean, is it safe to download it?"
,rutarum,2012-01-28T19:41Z,"@pingunn: The same thing has recently been happening to me on chrome. I just click ""get torrent file"" instead and it downloads. It's safe though. I don't know why that message has been popping up."
,rutarum,2012-01-28T20:13Z,"@AramYess: I had this problem but chose custom install and checked ""game only"" and then it installed fine."
,cnjjj,2012-01-31T23:43Z,I tried checking game only and it still wont work :/
