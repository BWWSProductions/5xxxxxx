Madonna Confessions Tour was the seventh concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It supported her tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor. Madonna confirmed the possibility of going out on a tour, as early as November 2005. Jamie King, Madonna's longtime collaborator, was then hired on to direct. The set list consisted of mainly songs from the supporting studio album and rehearsals started during 2006. The tour, again, did not go to Australia, prompting Madonna to release an apology statement on her website.
The concert was divided into four parts: Equestrian, Bedouin, Glam-Punk and Disco. Equestrian had horse-themed, bondaged performances, Bedouin had performances accompanied by messages, Glam-Punk performances had Madonna playing guitars and the final Disco segment consisted of dancing in general. The tour garnered positive appreciation from contemporary critics and commercial success. Tickets were completely sold as soon as dates and venues for the concert were announced, prompting the organizers to add more dates. After its ending, the Confessions Tour was dubbed as the highest grossing tour ever for a female artist, grossing over US$194.7 million from 60 shows and 1.2 million audience. The tour also received the "Most Creative Stage Production" at the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards as well as "Top Boxscore" from the Billboard Touring Awards.
Madonna's performance of the song "Live to Tell" while hanging on a giant mirrored cross wearing a crown of thorns was met with strong negative reaction from religious groups. The performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders. Madonna responded saying that her main intention with the performance was to bring attention to the millions of children dying in Africa from hunger and poverty. The tour was recorded and broadcasted on channels like NBC in United States and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. A CD+DVD recording titled The Confessions Tour was also released.
