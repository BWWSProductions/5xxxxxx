,fail0,2010-08-16T03:10Z,"with 90+ peers, 500+kBs upload, and 12kBs download, it makes me wonder if you fuckers really care about this shit and helping others out to begin with."
,M0e09,2010-08-27T22:16Z,"Thanks for the Upload!
Video quality is very good in my point of view but the audio's bitrate is too low... should be at least 384 kbit instead of 256 kbit... sounds quite bad in loud scenes this way but I'm kinda spoilt concerning audio ^^ 
Anyways, once again, thanks a lot!"
,John_Doe1214,2010-09-03T17:31Z,"QUESTION: The audio is way out of sync. It lags by 2 or 3 seconds. I am running XP 1.8GHz, 2 GB ram using GOM Player. I use ConvertXtoDVD4 for burning to disc. How can I fix the audio for burning? The picture is beautiful, but I need to fix audio sync for burning. Any help is appreciated."

,KVelevere,2012-06-08T09:06Z,"THIS IS NOT HD.

1280x544 is not an HD resolution. The width is right, but the correct height has to be above 720 pixels (either interlaced or not) to be anywhere near ""high definition."" Bugs the Hell out of me that HD is overused and often described inaccurate. Just thought I give everybody a heads-up for those who download this Torrent."
,Neamow,2012-06-10T13:58Z,"@KVelevere: 1280x720 is HD in 16:9 aspect ratio, but movies are more widescreen, with aspect ratio 2.39:1, which at 1280px width makes around 535px height"
,BTemplar,2012-06-19T20:13Z,HD has never had a clear-cut definition : it goes from 405 lines in 1936 to 1920Ă1080 today...
,SheldorTheConqueror,2012-06-27T01:28Z,"I honestly don't understand the standards.  If this is a scene release I would think 720p would mean x720 lines high, regardless of the aspect ratio.  That way on a standard 16x9 screen I could crop and not lose resolution.
Someone point me to a good article to understand why this would be considered a 720 and not merely a HD resolution between 480 and 720."
,Tankboy38,2012-07-03T23:40Z,Super quick download... PLEASE SEED!!!
,Neamow,2012-07-09T01:20Z,"To everyone who doesn't understand: HD 720p is the resolution of 1280x720, with the aspect ratio of 16:9. Movies, however, have wider aspect ratio, so the remaining space above and below is filled with black bars. These bars are present on the original Blu-Ray discs (this was done on DVDs as well), but rippers cut them out, because they are not needed, thus bringing the vertical resolution down. The content is the same, just the black bars are removed."
