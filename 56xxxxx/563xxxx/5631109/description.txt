Thanks to brodie2517 for uploading the original .vob files from the DVD rip.

Dark Side of the Rainbow (also known as Dark Side of Oz or The Wizard of Floyd)
refers to the pairing of the 1973 Pink Floyd music album The Dark Side of the Moon
with the visual portion of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. This produces moments
where the film and the album appear to correspond with each other. The title of the
music video-like experience comes from a combination of the album title and the
film's song "Over the Rainbow". Band members and others involved in the making of
the album state that any relationship between the two works of art is merely a coincidence.

The synchronization of this production is EXCELLENT, as is the video and
audio quality. I can only take credit for the encoding to h.264 format
and distribution. ENJOY!
