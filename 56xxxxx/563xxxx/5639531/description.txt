Set in a wasteland enclosed by a large white wall, the last survivor from a brutal child internment camp reluctantly takes on one final bounty hunting job to protect the idyllic life he has rebuilt.

In the near future, a handful of cities subsist behind a large white wall. These cities hold the last survivors of a fatal virus. Transformed into a child soldier in his youth, both a victim and a vessel of violence, Shawn Kors dreams of a new life. When a war erupts between the controlling militia and a terrorist gang, Shawn gives up the life he's built to confront the past he never wanted.
