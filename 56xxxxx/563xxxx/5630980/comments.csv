,newash,2010-06-16T09:08Z,"Hi 2040!
Do you plan to release the last episode of the SGU season? In 320p / quark ?
Please...
Thanks"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-16T09:34Z,"@newash: I answered that few times and have said that SU has been gone with [quark].

However, obviously I might encode 320p and up it around noon CET - but I need reason for encoding SU episode that has been aired a week ago and by now, as XviD or .mkv probably seen by anyone. Let remind ourselves that eztv today has over 1000 seeders on that, and SU fans and me - let say it nicely - never have been in ""productive relations"" since ep. 1 of SU (back then on mininova).

So - say a word: size?"
,newash,2010-06-16T09:45Z,"2040, you are an angel, I knew it. :-)

So if it's really up to me I would like a 272p."
,skillet92,2010-06-16T09:48Z,"are u gonna upload hot tub time machine?
if yes pls do it in 480p or 720p?"
,skillet92,2010-06-16T09:49Z,? = !
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-16T10:13Z,"@skillet92: Please, don't get me wrong, but - no. Reason is simple: I upped R5 on June the 8. Today that torrent have 13 seeders and it's still on Page 1 of my ""home"" - just to remind me every day how in fact I do foolish things (and I love to think that is not the case). Moreover, I did TS or CAM while ago.

,seenoevil47,2010-06-16T11:03Z,Hey...!! Tht was so fast of u... Thank u so mch..!! :))
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-16T11:49Z,"@ALL: First episode was encoded and upped last week. I provided info-link to tvrage.com and ""garnished"" upping with official image/picture (one that could appear on top of this page, on right).
Ahem, for nothing... nobody was interested and I was thinking ""well... it is not the fist time"".

What you can be sure is following:
- if you decide to download ANY of my torrents - set your UPLOAD SPEED ON UNLIMITED or close to that. Any other ""leeching from others but giving a shit back"" would be properly ""rewarded"".
-KEEP the torrent on seeding till next week's episode. If I spot lack of seeders, I wont encode that show.
-Be nice and be smart. For reasons above I ""killed"" many many mega popular shows as House, 2&1/2 men, Big Love, Damages, Stargate, Vampire Diaries without hesitation.

@seenoevil47: From my answer on your request you can figure out  why these two episodes differ in format. Also, I would ask you to read my comment addressed to all.

@seenoevil47: I DID, last week. First ep. was upped, been here 2-3 hours AND NO ONE downloaded torrent. He was deleted then - and TPB do not allow re-ups (do not ask me why).
However, I'll try to figure something out. "
