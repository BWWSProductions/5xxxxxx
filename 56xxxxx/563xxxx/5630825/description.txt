Great Science Textbooks DVD List as an importable and searchable dataset.
This dataset is pipe (|) delimited with a field name row and was tested by importing into microsoft excel
and access.

Fields:
IDX - original text file order
Subvol - some books had a "" char as part of the name along with chapters or volumes. Typically have more than book and author data in the AuthorBookName field
Directory Listing - the original directory list
DirectoryDVDTitle - the title of the DVD released
CategoryFinal - the general topical category, such as Biology, Social, Electronics, etc
Subcategory1 - further categorical division
Subcategory2 - further categorical division
AuthorBookName - not feasible to easily break out due to inconsistencies in order of author and bookname structure. More work than I wanted to do.
