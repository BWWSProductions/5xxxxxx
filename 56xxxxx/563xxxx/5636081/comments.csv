,JJ-KwiK,2010-06-18T21:35Z,Pls help me seed the awesome custom!
,JJ-KwiK,2010-06-19T21:09Z,I don't know why it's only saying 2 Seeders when in fact there are over 20? Wierd
,sumosmurf,2010-06-21T17:53Z,Would be cool if all of the bands listed (with the exception of NoFX) didn't suck ass.
,JJ-KwiK,2010-06-21T19:45Z,"See, that's what I like about the pirate bay.... I have 3 torrents up and they all have bullshit comments like that. 
It's people like you that and comments like that, that stop people from contributing. Thank you for attempting to cripple the community! FUCKER!"
,skullos,2010-06-22T12:39Z,"I must say that this custom got some really nice bands in it with  a lot of potential and replay value. Rise Against, All that Remains, Bullet for my valentine.. These are actually REAL bands. If You look at how they screwed it with band hero (lucky enough guitar hero 5 is better) From which game is it a custom by the way? Guitar I, II, III or another one?"
,JJ-KwiK,2010-06-22T21:36Z,"This game is based on GuiarHero 3. 
Obviously all the songs are replaced though :)

Let me know what you think."
,auldthief,2010-08-21T16:42Z,"Hey. Nice to see some custom work! If the developer is here, can you tell me if this supports a ps3 wireless suigat or a usb guitar? I alreadt have one for the ps2/ps3 and dont want to buy another! "
