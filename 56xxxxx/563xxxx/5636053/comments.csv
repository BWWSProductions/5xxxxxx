,DarkNinjaPopCan,2010-08-02T05:47Z,"Semi-Works On Windows 7 64-bit. With Overwriting The ""ExtCoverter.exe"" With The One Found In This Torrent It Removes The Water Mark But After 30 Days It Will End Forcing You To Choose Three Buttons ""Close"", ""Activate"", And ""Buy Now"". Overwriting The ""VideoConverter.exe"" With The One From The Torrent Crashes The Program Every Time. (on Windows 7 64-bit) My Opinion Of The Program Over All Was A 10/10 Converted Everything I Tried Verious Types Of MKV, OGM, AVI, WMA, Had Not A Single Problem With It, Movavi 9 Couldn't Convert All My MKV Files."

,XoPoTo,2010-08-11T06:27Z,"I have tried this one with XP Pro 32 bit, Vista 32 & 64 bit, it does not work.  Usually the cracks are easy to install and mostly do work.  Really can’t understand how you can put this up on TPB.  Checked your other Movavi Suite 9 upload, the same issue, have to question your trusted status…"

,Pegasus82,2011-05-29T18:38Z,"@ilefx - Your suggestion with replacing ExtConverter instead of Videoconverter works for me too.
Movavi still says that it is the trial version, and it tells me that it will leave a watermark, but the end result is clean. Thanks!"
,Pegasus82,2011-05-29T18:38Z,"Oh, and this is with Win7 x64"

don't know about other OS, but it's practical, that it never work in win7  :("
,r08star,2011-08-31T16:55Z,"I dunno why there is such a fuzz about this program? I only need it to convert my MTS files!!! For All the othe codec (=DivX, Matroska=MKV, avi, etc.), and DVD conversion you just need one free exe file which is FREELY AVAILABLE  since I started converting stuff (=video)

PocketDivxEncoder.exe is ALL YOU NEED!!!

just Google it. It is Freeware!!! 
( And for all you beginners: it is foolproof)"
,Y4RDAP3,2011-09-10T22:09Z,I got it to work by CTRL+C-ing & CTRL+V-ing Extconverter.exe but leaving Videoconverter.exe alone. Works great

,idmountaingirl,2011-10-11T01:00Z,"I installed the program on Vista 32 bit. Deselected run program at the end of instal. Hit Finish. Opened up intallation folder. copied extconverter.exe to folder. accepted overwrite. Ran program. clicked on continue even though it said it would leave a watermark. I ran my videos through the program and it worked perfect with no watermark. other programs i used kept audio rates the same but doubled the video speed rendering them useless. this program worked perfectly. Excellent upload. Ran system scan, no virus present in my 3 tiered settings."
