HyperSpin is an animated arcade frontend for Windows for use on Home Arcade Machines. HyperSpin allows you to create custom menu systems to run most executables with that arcade look and feel. HyperSpin takes a more artwork oriented approach to creating menu's. With this tool you should be able to make interesting menu's for your games, movies etc. Simply put, HyperSpin is likely the best looking emulation front-end ever devised, and makes emulation setup easier.

Edit:

Sorry to all people in 99.9%, this torrent crashed some times and corrupt the HyperSpin 1.0.part11.rar file and stucked in 98.9%.
I'm working in the files, repacking then, then switch the bad files for the good ones...
