You don't start a torrent without handing it off to a few people, the whole torrent."

,random-hero,2010-06-27T03:41Z,does it work for mac?
,JEA13,2010-06-28T10:43Z,"Yeah, um, I started downloading this, but I can't really tell you if it's working or not because SOMEBODY'S NOT SEEDING. I AM trying to seed everyday so that the torrent may still exist, but I have not even downloaded 50% of the torrent. Which means nobody can get it all from me. HTH are you supposed to get it then??? :@"

,Dark_Master10,2010-12-23T12:54Z,"Hey guys,
So, I've been seeing a LOT of people requesting others to seed.The problem is the others aren't seeding,the problem is that your upload rate is too low(makes no sense xD,but its true).To incraise your upload rate, do the following:

1.Go to the ""Options"" tab in the upper left corner of the screen.

2.Press preferences(or just ignore step 1. and press on your keyboard CTRL+P) 

3.A new window should pop up, find the ""Bandwith"" tab in the left of the window.

4.In ""Global Upload Rate Limiting"", at ""Maximum Upload Rate"" change the value to 0

You are done! :D Simple uh?

--BUT--

If you play any online games(THIRD-PARTY GAMES ONLY) with the ""Maximum Uploade Rate"" set to 0, your ping/latency in those online games,will be very high,and thats bad.So,everytime you play an online game,set that value to 1,and when not playing an online game,change it to 0

I hope this helped,by the way,with this this thing,my download record(as far as I know) is 2.46mb/s !!! THATS A LOT

P.S. - My English SUCKS"
