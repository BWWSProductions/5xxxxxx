,umarnawazkhan,2010-08-30T03:55Z,"MKV advantages over AVI?
* supports H.264/AVC
* B-Frame support
* supports variable audio bitrate
* supports chapters, muxed subtitles, metadata/tags and dvd-like menus

Unfortunately there are no MKV-players out yet"
,rsh00,2010-09-16T20:54Z,"@umarnawazkhan, you are wrong...Western Digital has a couple of MKV players with USB inputs. You can connect your portable hard drive to it and can view MKV files. You also get HDMI outputs."

The usual excellent quality you'd expect from RiddlerA at small filesizes. I can't believe 600kbps 720p looks this good!

I am curious as to where you ripped this from though, as the Blu-ray isn't out yet..."

,LeBieque,2012-02-14T15:18Z,"I bought this DVD many years ago. It was subsequently stolen during a break-in. The thief was apprehended and got off with a warning, in true lefty appeasement policy mode. Nothing was returned. I've DVD'ed the download with ConvertXtoDVD and now have at least a copy again. I don't recall the original being of the same quality as this baby. ThanX"
