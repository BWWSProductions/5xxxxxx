Here' the story on this overlooked little gem...

It! The Terror From Beyond Space

Starring: Marshall Thompson, Shawn Smith, Kim Spalding

One of the best of the medium-budgeted science fiction flicks of the 1950s, It! The Terror from Beyond Space is set in ""the future"" (1973, to be exact). An rescue ship travels out to Mars to retrieve the only survivor of a space probe that has experienced some sort of cataclysm. That survivor, Col Ed Carruthers (Marshall Thompson) is accused of murdering his fellow crewmen. But Ed claims that the killer was a Martian monster, and hopes to prove his assertions by signing up for a second journey to the Red Planet. Before long, the crew members of this second expedition are being systematically killed off, and it looks as though Ed is up to his old tricks. As it turns out, however, Ed was telling the truth: there is a monster on board, the savage descendant of the once-mighty Martian civilization, who snuck on board when an irresponsible crew member left the door open. The monster stays alive by absorbing the vital body fluids of its victims-and there seems to be no way to stop this parasitic creature! If the plot of It! The Terror from Beyond Space seems vaguely familiar, it is because it was one of the primary inspirations for the 1979 sci-fi classic Alien. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide"

Where is Richard Feynman when we need him most? Drinking Orange Juice in his beloved Tanu Tuva. Maybe Hawking can way in on this freaky frog from the other side of reality? Thanks again. I no longer need to leave my house in the immediate future...your marvelous films leave me with no option for outdoors...MUST WATCH.............. Thanks."
