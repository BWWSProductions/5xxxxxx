,jakeeem,2010-06-18T16:47Z,"hey dudee,, thanks for this, but would you be able to rip in 320kbps? if you could thatd be great.
thankss"
,EvilVincent,2010-06-18T16:47Z,Thanks.. will be seeding all evening/night PWD rules ^^
,Leviathan_Baphomet,2010-06-18T17:07Z,"Thanks but could you PLEASE!!! get a FLAC/320/v0 uploaded :D, m4a is a horrible format that nobody really wants. Very lucky to get your copy so early!!"
,steedycore,2010-06-18T23:49Z,i use it because it goes with itunes. seems to go well. if you really want to you can convert it
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-19T00:00Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5636221/Parkway_Drive_-_Deep_Blue_%282010-mp3%29_%5BJonnyBeans%5D

256kbps, mp3"
,Noackian,2010-06-19T04:07Z,"fuck yeah this is sick man. i have no idea how you people get these leaked album. i would really love to know. if you ripped a FLAC or mp3 @ 320 that would also be great. you would get PLENTY more seeds dude. dont use itunes (fail application) exact audio copy isnt too bad man, give it a go"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-19T04:45Z,"i can say a lot of these people who upload webrips and stuff use audio extractors to ""steal"" the music off of bands profile pages when they stream their album to promote it for their release dates.

i get mine in the mail from the label or the band directly.

anyone who follows my uploads would tell you i only upload the best quality and its always retail.

check my shit out.  you might find TONS of shit you want."
,steedycore,2010-06-19T04:52Z,"as i said in the description mate, I preordered the album with a tshirt. the manufacturers fucked up so the shirts arent coming till july, but they sent the album early. 
i put it on my itunes and it converts to m4a. a few of my mates wanted it thats why i put it up as a torrent. for all those who want 320kps/mp3 or whatever, there are probably gonna be a few torrents pop up. but mine was the first. so just download whatever you want.

or here's a thought... when it comes out, how about you buy the album and do whatever you want with it? its worth the money"
,steedycore,2010-06-19T04:55Z,"@zombifuzz as i said before, this is a cd rip.. ahh i miss the days when people could actually be bothered reading things...
i dont care about uploading in the best quality or whatever. i didnt make this so ppl can bitch that its not in mp3. i made it so my mates could have a listen and i didnt have to lend the cd to 20 people."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-19T06:51Z,"obviously i hit a raw nerve with someone.  i did not say anything about you specifically, i said most people with webrips use audio extractors to get the album off sites streaming the album before its release date.  i simply answered someones question about receiving albums early.

so maybe you should fully read things before you open your fucking mouth you stupid fucking cunt.  people like you make me fucking sick.  

SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FAT ASS FUCKING FAGGOT!"
,kullervo123,2010-06-19T10:26Z,"here it is in much better quality and in MP3-

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5636221/Parkway_Drive_-_Deep_Blue_(2010-mp3)_"
,steedycore,2010-06-19T13:52Z,"wow. now that was just... wow. where did you learn to fight like that? seriously dude.

i dont see why your turning this into a big deal, with all your swearing and stupid name calling. its the internet, nobody gives a shit. so chill the fuck out? why bother?"
,Cortana777,2010-06-19T17:00Z,"The other torrent (256kbps MP3) sucks really. The quality is even worse than this shit here. Nobody here with knowledge?

I want a FLAC version, is that so difficult?"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-20T08:16Z,you wont get a FLAC until the album is actually released you fat fucking faggot.
,Cortana777,2010-06-20T12:48Z,"Son of a bitch, you motherfucking noob!

You rip it with iTunes, i mean WHAT THE FUCK? Learn to use Exakt Audio Copy..."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-20T23:11Z,clearly im the noob.... i mean im a VIP uploader and all... i must be new right!?  epic fail.
,TURBOTAILZ,2010-06-21T17:05Z,"""its the internet, nobody gives a shit""

,steedycore,2010-06-24T02:09Z,"well this one (mine) is a 256kps CD rip, because its good for portable music players, ipods and shit. download whatever you want, i dont care.

except for zombifuzz's one. he seems clinically insane and likes to fight over the internet. and im sure he likes to vote me -1 on however many accounts he has"
,Tr0Tr0,2010-07-02T03:56Z,"hey, its good enough for any normal person who just wants to put it on their ipod and shiz
stop fucking bitching about it and if you want a different format then find a different one."

,steedycore,2012-01-28T06:16Z,"@dr4twenti
Mate, you are a joke. If you believe that I didn't preorder it, you can do that, I truly don't give a shit. And 'any fucking person' can see you are an absolute twat. How about you go out and buy the album like I did and stop fucking complaining?"
