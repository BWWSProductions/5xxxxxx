This is the new Parkway Drive album, Deep Blue, due to be released on the 25th of June in Australia. I preordered, and they sent it early, so I'm sharing it around. This is ripped directly from the CD, no recording different bits off the internet etc.

MAKE SURE YOU SEED!!!

File format is m4a (AAC, iTunes format) because that is what iTunes converts it to when it rips, and the bitrate is 256kps.
