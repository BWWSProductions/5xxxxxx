First rip the movie from a DVD with the  DVD-Decrypter and AutoGordianKnot.

Then to improve the quality and compress the file size load the riped movie file into the virtual dub and perform the tuning..

You can adjust colour , resolution , lighten-darken , cut the cast&Crew part,and compress the video file using x264 encoder , I preffer x264 encoding as its the best encoder for compressing videos with the best possible quality out of the avi file..

I have compressed videos who's file size were 4 to 6 GB blue ray discs into 350-MB, And believe me , the quality is really good even after compressing, 
But i always prefer the file size to be 700-900 MB for best output quality..

happy ripping.....
