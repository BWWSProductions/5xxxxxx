A Definitive text on developing circuit simulators

Circuit Simulation gives a clear description of the numerical techniques and algorithms that are part of modern circuit simulators, with a focus on the most commonly used simulation modes: DC analysis and transient analysis. Tested in a graduate course on circuit simulation at the University of Toronto, this unique text provides the reader with sufficient detail and mathematical rigor to write his/her own basic circuit simulator. There is detailed coverage throughout of the mathematical and numerical techniques that are the basis for the various simulation topics, which facilitates a complete understanding of practical simulation techniques. In addition, Circuit Simulation:

Explores a number of modern techniques from numerical analysis that are not synthesized anywhere else

Covers network equation formulation in detail, with an emphasis on modified nodal analysis

Gives a comprehensive treatment of the most relevant aspects of linear and nonlinear system solution techniques

States all theorems without proof in order to maintain the focus on the end-goal of providing coverage of practical simulation methods

Provides ample references for further study

Enables newcomers to circuit simulation to understand the material in a concrete and holistic manner

With problem sets and computer projects at the end of every chapter, Circuit Simulation is ideally suited for a graduate course on this topic. It is also a practical reference for design engineers and computer-aided design practitioners, as well as researchers and developers in both industry and academia.
