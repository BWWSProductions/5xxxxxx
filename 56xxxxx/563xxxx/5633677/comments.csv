[T],bitstreeem,2010-06-17T17:53Z,Most welcome lad...=)
,fauxartist,2010-06-18T00:39Z,Your awesome...I've been looking for this for ever....thank you thank you...one of the best monsters 
,fauxartist,2010-06-18T00:53Z,"I'm new at this, and am showing like a years time to download this movie, any suggestions for this newbie how to improve the download speed. I'm using a I have Ethernet...100mbps download speed, thanks..."
[T],bitstreeem,2010-06-18T01:06Z,"@fauxartist....is the slow speed just this particular DL or slow in general?

One common reason would be a poorly configured router if your using one.  

I haven't heard much about speed issues from these files I'm loading.  I typically seed at full 3mb until seeds reach 10 or more then throttle back to load the next one.
I then leave most of the initial seeding to the peeps that so far have stuck around long enough to really get the file swarming.  It's been great so far..=)  Without this help I would really be down to a crawl loading these..."
,fauxartist,2010-06-18T01:49Z,"no...bandwidth on my end fine. Only on router with roommate who is never home, and he is like an engineer for Intel...and has all the speed and dedicated line stuff....and yes...it is only your movies...of course there are others here too, but generally...the overall download for most movies currently seeded etc. are fairly speedy, hour or two, and I'm getting down to about a day to download the classic-sci fi's...but if that what it takes...then I'm fine with that too.,
I'm just soooo happy to have someone else on here that loves bad 'B' movies like I do....my whole childhood was filled with the double feature Sat. afternoon double headers of these old movies. As kids...we were in heaven...'The Tingler', 'House on Haunted Hill', and of course all of yours posted...great stuff.....thanks."
[T],bitstreeem,2010-06-18T02:08Z,"Well that is odd.  I know that at first it would be slow until some of the others kick in....like 10 or more seeds.  It should pick up after that.  I sure hope it doesn't take a day for everyone to get these! lol, but I know it doesn't.  In any case I wish I had a better answer for ya, but like you said, at least your getting them eventually. 

Yes! It's cool to find people that still remember these and the impact they had on our childhood....sometimes growing up I didn't know what I would do without movies and of course the music back then.  I also have a couple hundred classic music vids...maybe I'll load those later...;)

Enjoy!!"
,bonzodog1,2010-06-18T02:08Z,Thanks!  Your collection is great.

,fauxartist,2010-06-20T02:13Z,"Again thanks for the great classics I love...

And yes, I did eventually get them...well worth it.

Let us know when and if you do decide to download the toons...another of my favorites too.

Your truly one of the very few who are keeping these great classics alive for the rest of us..."
,fauxartist,2010-06-20T02:21Z,"my other comment on thanking you, I did eventually get the downloads just fine, love them."
