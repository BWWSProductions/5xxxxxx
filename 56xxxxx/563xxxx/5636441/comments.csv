,jangmuso,2010-08-09T10:44Z,RAR files.. no thanks!
,Awesomo42,2010-08-22T13:54Z,"Thank you very much for the upload! Been meaning to get this for sooo long, have it on HD-DVD but wanted a bluray rip for the media server. This movie is frakkin' amazing.

And to all RAR haters, stfu. Yeah it's an extra step, boo-freakin'-hoo. I'd rather spend an extra 10 seconds of my time to verify file integrity any day; rather than downloading it, archiving it, then realizing that a couple bytes aren't where they're supposed to be and having to go through the hassle of fixing a broken file.

No-Rar = Convenience
RAR = Security"
,GravityOne,2010-09-09T00:54Z,Hows the video quality? Is it another upscaled grainy version?
,kaos217,2010-10-01T05:42Z,"The Good: Fast Download speed.

The Bad: 10GB of Hi-Res grainy video.

Grainy nonsense."
,andregyn,2010-10-22T06:16Z,The quality is superB. 300 is GRAINED intentionally by the director.
