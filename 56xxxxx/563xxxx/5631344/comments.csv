[V],meech,2010-06-19T16:47Z,"mercu3:
I'm glad you have enjoyed the Stargate rips.  The final Season 10 should hopefully be up sometime this weekend.  I just have to add the subtitles.  As far as your questions go.  Sorry, but I don't plan on releasing the dvd extras.  And as far as Atlantis, I did think about doing that next.  However, there are already high quality rips of Atlantis out there.  I have just finished dowloading the bluray rips and they are fantastic.  I would always choose bluray over dvd rips.  So I don't think there would be much interest.

I plan on ripping ""Space Above and Beyond"" next.  It is only a one season show.  Then after that, I will probably rip Star Trek Deep Space Nine and/or Star Trek Voyager.  However, if there seems to be enough interest in Atlantis, I would consider that."
,Gaukou,2010-06-20T04:05Z,Excellent idea for the future upload of 'SAAB' ... I'm looking forward to it. Keep up the great job !
,teqno,2010-06-20T19:48Z,"The current 720p rel out there of atlantis is far from perfect.

season 1 = audio out of sync
season 2 = skipped frames all the time on every ep
season 3-5 = no comment for the moment

i would love if you could continue with atlantis after you done the last season of sg-1 :D "
[V],meech,2010-06-21T12:45Z,"I had the same problems with season 1 and 2.  There are other torrents (at least for season 2) out there that don''t have these problems.
Season 2: http://www.torrentvip.com/torrent/Stargate-Atlantis-Season-2-720p-WEB-DL-DD-5-1-h-264-TjHD_51559.html
It's true I have yet to find a good season 1 720p rip.  But I didn't see anything wrong in seasons 3-5.  And actually if there are any problems with 3-5, there are other torrents out there for those seasons.  However, I will take your requests into consideration.  THanks!!"
,CakeMonster,2010-11-01T20:01Z,"Mr meech if you could please upload season 2 of atlantis with commentaries it would make my day

There is a big torrent of season 1-5 of âgood qualityâ of atlantis but in that torrent only season 3-5 works and there are no directors commentaries

So please upload atlantis and especially season 2 with commentaries please :)"
,elitePraetorian,2010-11-03T22:24Z,Seed pls this is going unbearably slow
,Sick_Jargon,2010-11-19T11:14Z,"Jesus, stop limiting your upload rates. It's simply going to take longer for everyone to download the torrent.

D/L: 50KB/s (avg) U/L: 80KB/s (avg)

It's taking near on 1-2 hours for each episode.. Sort it out!


On another note, thanks for the shares Meech, downloaded all seasons so far and they're all quality. :)"
,history_boy_,2011-06-19T11:29Z,"Beauty - Thanks very meech! Haha. I've had old copies of SG-1 SE1-10 for years and they were pretty terrible in comparison. Watchable, but you know how it is. Better quality IS better. 

I will get the files on the UL as much as possible but I can't promise permanent connection.
Thanks to everyone who seeded, even those who limited their UL rate. It doesn't matter, just means you have to be more patient. (Those who whine about it, please just think how much time and effort it takes to get these series UP on the service)

Thanks again guys 

   (   :"
,wraithkelso,2011-07-23T08:25Z,Can you guys PLEASE seed? I am only downloading at 0.7kb/s
,FavouriteX,2011-10-16T08:53Z,"I seed about twice I get. The speed is good.
@Meech, thanks!"
