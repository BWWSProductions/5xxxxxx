           ART & COPY is a powerful new film about advertising and        
           inspiration. Directed by Doug Pray (SURFWISE, SCRATCH,         
           HYPE!), it reveals the work and wisdom of some of the          
           most influential advertising creatives of our time --          
           people who've profoundly impacted our culture, yet are         
           virtually unknown outside their industry. Exploding forth      
           from advertising's "creative revolution" of the 1960s,         
           these artists and writers all brought a surprisingly           
           rebellious spirit to their work in a business more often       
           associated with mediocrity or manipulation: George Lois,       
           Mary Wells, Dan Wieden, Lee Clow, Hal Riney and others         
           featured in ART & COPY were responsible for "Just Do It,"      
           "I Love NY," "Where's the Beef?," "Got Milk," "Think           
           Different," and brilliant campaigns for everything from        
           cars to presidents. They managed to grab the attention of      
           millions and truly move them. Visually interwoven with         
           their stories, TV satellites are launched, billboards are      
           erected, and the social and cultural impact of their ads       
           are brought to light in this dynamic exploration of art,       
           commerce, and human emotion.
