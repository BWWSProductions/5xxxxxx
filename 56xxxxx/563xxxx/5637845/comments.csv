When I see a torrent with your name on it I always check it out bc you do great work so anyway I was looking for this one and saw there was a ts screener in spanish and was wondering if maybe you could take the video from that if it is good and apply your own english audio so i can dl it? Thanx dude!!!"

,Lucky13s,2010-06-20T09:49Z,"Why do people rate ""For A Cam"" and give it ridiculously high numbers.

How about a real A/V, with numbers relative to how good it actually is. I dont give it fuck how good it is ""for a cam"", I want to know how it compares to the average video released here, the dvdrips.
If you write a/9 v/9 ""for a cam"".. its fucking confusing because then people are gonna think its actually good."
,paulderby,2010-06-20T10:32Z,"Lucky13s

Not complaining, the picture quality is great. And I definitely appreciate people uploading these.
This just gives you a sense of what's being cut out in this AVI. (Which is the exact same file as all of the other Toy Story 3 torrents so far)"

,bajungadustin,2010-06-23T06:21Z,"This is amature work. Not saying that the quality is bad. quality is probably v8 a6...

The video is decent. camera takes a little long to focus from time to time... audio sounds like a casette tape and constantly hisses. BUT WATCHABLE.

My biggest issue with this cam is the Fovial Picture. The camera needs to be zoomed way the heel out. in movie theater screen terms, this video is missing about 8 feet on each side and about 4 feet on top and bottom. there is a holy SHIT TON of screen that is missing. i saw this in the theatre and you are only seeing about 40% of the movie by watching this ""zoomed in"" version.

Just letting you know. its watchable if you can get past that part though."

,mrdirectorman,2010-07-08T02:43Z,Thanks great work! Would you consider going back to a 3D theatre and filming the movie 2 more times through first the left lens then right lens of the provided 3d glasses? I mean for you to put the glasses in front of the camera so the camera looks through one of the special lenses. Then you have to sit in the same seat to film through the other side of the glasses.
