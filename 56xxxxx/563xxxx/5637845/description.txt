PrisM NOTES
for first release it's a pretty nice cam, has a bad crop and flicker noise etc, but still nice:), well made a avs script with some filters in it....tweaked the RGB, slightly changed the saturation on the source, didn't seem to bad, added a deblock filter added a sharpness filter, and a smoothness, it made the video look pretty damn good.... it took just over 9hours to encode but well worth it...looks pretty sweet if you ask me:D audio is lu untouched...many thanks good job :P

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
