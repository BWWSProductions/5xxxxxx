Can you please specify the name of the theme? I think there are only 2 themes with custom sounds -Alien and Longhorn Absolute Glass. Rest of the htemes use default windows sound schemes.

These themes don't cause windows to stall during shutdown. There is only a slight delay as the custom shutdown sound plays for a slightly longer time. This is not a problem if you use a theme without sound scheme.

I have been using all the themes for quite some time but I never had any system crashes or poor performance. Your problem may be due to improper patching of the system files. Please turnoff the UAC control before patching the files. You can turn on UAC after the procedure is complete. Just read the instructions carefully.

Thank You.   "

I followed all the instructions you\'ve said in the readme file (incl. back up all imp files as well as copy \""Full glass.exe\"" into the StartUp folder).nAfter restarting, my desktop turned BLACK without ANY ICONS or ANY wallpaper appearing on it. I got the task manager opened by ctrl+alt+del. I cud\'nt find the file \""Full glass.exe\"" running on the task manager after restarting the comp (which it shoud do as i\'ve placed the file in the start-up folder. I guess that is why the desktop is black). Then I ran the VistaGlazz uninstaller and also ran \""Uninstall.cmd\"" and \""UninstallCleanup.cmd\"" from the folder \""MrGRiMsIcons\"" using the task manager (as that is the only thing i\'m able to run now on the desktop!!). I cant use my Windows 7 OS now to do anything. Please do tell how to fix this mess! and get back my old desktop, asap!"
