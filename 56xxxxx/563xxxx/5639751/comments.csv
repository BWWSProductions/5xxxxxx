Great movie! Nominated for Oscar and another 15 wins & 3 nominations. 

And fellows, this torrent has subtitles in English and Brazilian Portuguese."

I'm sure this is a great upload, but there's little point uploading if no-one seeds, including the uploader. Only 10 days seeding? Bah!"

,altoburgo,2010-12-03T11:52Z,"what do you mean 10 days seeding? I'm seeding EVERY day from 8pm to 8am Sydney time!

EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!"

That bad. 
Don't let the size fool you."
,altoburgo,2011-03-25T12:03Z,@cinesimon I'm sorry but I'm not a ripper. This is a hard movie to find so if you have a better copy share it before you say something like that.
