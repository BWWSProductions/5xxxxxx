When two troubled teenagers meet, they discover an extraordinary empathy for each other that will lead them on the most emotionally painful journey of their lives.

Both David and Lisa have experienced loneliness and terror and suffer from different mental conditions. He is obsessive and fears touch, while she acts childishly and talks only in rhymes in order to prevent her other persona, the one she calls Muriel, from coming out.

David and Lisa's meeting in a mental health facility for disturbed teeangers also brings them under the watchful care of Dr. Jack Miller. What now unfolds is one of the most moving, tender and heart-rending stories, which eventually sees David and Lisa being forced to confront their problems and reach out to one another. The moment when they finally touch will live with you forever.

Sidney Poitier, Lukas Haas and Brittany Murphy deliver intensely powerful performances that explore every emotion and the tremendous healing power of love.
