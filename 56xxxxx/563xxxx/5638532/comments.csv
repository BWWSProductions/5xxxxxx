,arunkch,2011-02-07T06:43Z,Brothers and sisters... I tried the whole WWW for subtitles. I can't find the ones that match for these three movies. I found some but they have synch issues. If I manage to sync them they aren't long enough till movie dialogue completes.. They are fast. Please help me. If somone has the English Subs for these three movies please throw them via some links. I'd be grateful.
