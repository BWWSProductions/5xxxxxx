,PXT0R0,2010-06-18T04:33Z,"The fact that people download from you should be thanks enough. I see you are as full of yourself as you are proud.

If anyone wants to watch naruto episodes, there are tons of sources such as...

http://www.narutoget.com/

This is one of the best sources were you can watch every episode or movie. Every thursday at 9am eastern time on the dot.

This uploader doesn't realize why people share and that its really a thankless job. You should look at how many people download your ups and that should be thanks enough. Instead you act like a 12 yr old and demand thanks. You don't even use descriptions or post screens when its appropriate. 

Maybe if you shut up about your pc, you would be even more appreciated and wouldn't get cheap thank you's from pinheads that feel threatened to do so."
