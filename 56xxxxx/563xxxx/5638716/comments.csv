,newmouse,2010-06-20T06:11Z,"I have most of the previous DLC's installed.
When I put this Torrents BioPersistentEntitlementCache.ini file into
The My Documents Mass Effect 2 folder I get the Overlord DLC Authorized BUT all the existing DLC's are now shown not Authorized.

IF I use the existing older BioPersistentEntitlementCache.ini then I get the older DLC's but these new Overload ones are not authorized. ????
Any Bunny help ???
This ini file is in an unreadable format so I can't read or edit it.
@@@@@ "
,fadi299,2010-06-20T13:13Z,"this download is fully working, thanks uploader!. anyway make sure to apply the 1.02 crack after installing this DLC, otherwise you'll get the ""instert the original DVD"" message.....


just like the other DLCs, i found this one to be pretty boring, i've only been playing it for an hour or so and it's nothing special at all!, non of the DLCs approaches the quality of the vanilla game...


the vehicle controls are awkward and not that much better than the mako from the original, atleast in the original you had massive open.ended enviroments to explore and play around with, in ME2 the enviroments while they look pretty are very small, confined and linear......

i'm really starting to think the original ME was better than the second!......"
,cousland,2010-06-20T16:28Z,I have the tptb rip version of mass effect 2. will this download work with it?
,newmouse,2010-06-20T21:28Z,"I wrote the first post here about not getting all the DLC's shown as Authorised .
This Torrent & the other same size almost same name  Torrent are clearly fresh re releases out today .
Perhaps the problem has gone.

And yes it should work with the TPTB version.@@@"
,TheVGamer,2010-06-20T21:43Z,"Doesn't work for me. I have other dlc's and installed these ones, rewrote that ini file, but still have that error. Any ideas?"
,mastros,2010-06-21T00:00Z,wtf..guys listen the game open perfect im going to land to the planet to find overlord and then not responding!!
,matelian,2010-06-21T08:18Z,"if u have Authorization problem for the old DLCs then u have to apply the DLC crack named giveme2entitlment.exe or something like that and it should work fine also u have to re-apply v1.02 crack from gamecopyworld and it should work fine, I already finished the first mission."
,Doshunn,2010-06-22T16:30Z,I dont know how to install the game. Can someone please tell me how to do so ? I've extracted all of the rar files into a folder. I tried launching the ME2_EqualizerPack.exe and the ME2_Overlord.exe but one doesnt seem to do anything and the other says that i have to install the game first. Please help me somebody. Thanks !
,Doshunn,2010-06-22T16:43Z,I've just done some research and checked all the rar files using a sfv checker and all of the fies downloaded are fine.
,newmouse,2010-06-23T22:53Z,"To work with existing DLC's I think this is the way.

Install this & put this ini file in the My Documents Mass Effect2 replacing the older ini file..
Now run the GiveEntitleMents crack patch that came with the older DLC's .
It will write over & add to this Overload ini.
Then all DLC's should work @@@"
,Doshunn,2010-06-24T19:55Z,"Newmouse, when you say 'install this', what exactly do you mean  by 'this' ?"
,Doshunn,2010-06-24T19:57Z,"And when u ask me to put the file in the path in My Documents, its sounds like the mass effect 2 folder already exists in My Docments. This isnt the case for me. Am I misunderstanding or is there something I need to do first ? Thank you."
,nick1ss1gndon,2010-06-25T00:07Z,"I've got the same error as mastros.  When I click land at the point where I've reached Aite, the game stops responding, and I either have to quickly open the task manager to resume normal function of my computer, or completely reboot as Mass Effect hijacks my system resources.  Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,forthetie,2010-06-26T05:28Z,"used newmouse's way and it worked perfectly

pretty much just install this (as in this torrent duh) and run giveme2entitlements

also the hammerhead is nothing like the mako :P"

Please don't tell me to run an exe and not say where the hell it is, been looking all over for it on the interwebz now grrr!"
,Sags95,2010-07-03T06:03Z,Does this work if i have real copy of Mass Effect 2?
,Dhatzster,2010-07-07T21:42Z,"WTF are the real disk demands of the installation? shit tells me not enough on selected disk, but it didn't let me select a disk and my C has 2.2GB empty. and how the F is the failproof install for those who have the first DLC pack? ARGH! those retarded oversimplified installers."
,xKerberos,2010-08-16T13:11Z,"Sags, I don't think so. At least not without making it half pirated so to speak since you're cutting it off from BioWare's server if I understand correctly. I'm tired of paying the 7 usd though. 7 to some of you is 30+ in my country."
,Cyrez60659,2010-08-27T01:20Z,"You can find the giveme2entitlements.exe in these torrents:

,facechubb,2010-09-22T20:55Z,"Maybe my torrent client's settings just suck, but I'm getting 0kbs down right now, and for that matter, all my torrent downloads suck as far as time goes.  Are people seeding this?  
Is there a surefire way I can make my downloads quicker?  I'm running Vista Home Premium SP2 32bit, and I'm using Bitcomet.  Are there better clients?"
,blazzox,2010-10-02T19:57Z,"i had the ""ini"" problem when i first installed zaeed addon, then katsumi. i have overwrited the prefious ini and the game woldnt start so i just copied the original crack for ms 2 and it worked...
try that maybe it would work "
,somedude.1001,2010-10-17T16:05Z,"Can someone make a torrent of all available DLCs?
As of right now its very difficult to find DLCs. Some arent even exist or their torrents are already dead."
,AznAssassin,2010-10-21T11:02Z,LOL well i am going 2 try and see if this works since everyone on this page is complaining about this. This the best torrent for this DLC i can find so we'll see...
,AznAssassin,2010-10-21T11:03Z,"@somedude.1001

I managed to get all of teh DLC's from torrenting. Most should be on piratebay. Some u'll have to go 2 other torrent sites e.g Kasumi DLC I got from a random site. "
,somedude.1001,2010-10-30T06:32Z,Thanks mate!
,tanknitro,2010-12-05T02:38Z,"guys, I installed the dlc and got it running but after I finish the first mission, and I go to the firewalker to leave, the game freezes and doesn't respond. Help will be much appreciated."

,crayZ32,2011-05-24T04:21Z,"Just wanted to confirm, you can pirate all of the DLCs and add them on to a legitimate version of the game as long as you have givemeentitlements.exe. Thanks for the upload :)"
,poaspdfjsaojdfosa,2011-06-15T16:03Z,i have the same problem like tanknitro
