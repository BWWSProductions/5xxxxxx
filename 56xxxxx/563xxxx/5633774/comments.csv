[V],-jonny-,2010-06-24T14:00Z,Should be in the Highres category.
,fretnoise,2010-06-30T02:05Z,"Thanks for the upload, this is great. Unfortunately, there are some hickups with the MKV video. Episode 2, for example, has an issue right from the beginning, near 0:08. Problem happens with VLC 1.0.3, 1.1, and my Samsung LED TV. 

Have to manually jump over this point, otherwise video will stop playing. 

Other than this, video quality is really great. Thank you."
,fretnoise,2010-06-30T02:11Z,Please ignore my comment. Everything works great. The problem was me.

Cheers."

Yeah it's pretty messed up in that one. In some of the other episodes the audio isn't synched either, but it's less noticeable"

,lattari,2012-06-03T16:16Z,What do you mean 480p? The file size seems regular for 720
