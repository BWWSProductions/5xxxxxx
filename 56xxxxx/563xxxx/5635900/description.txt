Over the course of Christian history there have been times of revival when the Holy Spirit is powerfully manifested among the people of God. One of the most far-reaching revivals ever took place in 1904 in Wales. 
In this program you will see how the revival broke out and how it changed lives and impacted the entire society. Through use of contemporary letters, interviews and photographs, this program examines the 1904 Welsh Revival through the eyes and thoughts of the Revivalist himself, 26-year-old Evan Roberts. From his conversion at 13 to the outbreak of Revival in November, 1904, the story traces the steps in his spiritual development from the coal mine and blacksmith's shop to the grammar school at Newcastle Emlyn and the actual outbreak of Revival at his home church of Moriah Lougher.
 Many are convinced we urgently need spiritual revival in the world today. God worked through 26-year-old Evan Roberts many years ago. Viewers are finding this program a strong stimulus to seek a new manifestation of God's power in our day and age.
