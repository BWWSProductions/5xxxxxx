[T],gamerguuy,2010-06-17T13:42Z,You need winrar(google it)Open winrar and then browse to the directory where you have saved these files after that click on one of the files and then click on extract.Hope this helps!Looking forward for your reply....

,OSiRASE,2010-06-20T07:58Z,"Works fine, the people with the application load error are complete fucking morons. It's so simple that I'm not even going to tell you how to fix it.

Jesus mother fucking christ what is the world coming to..."
,age373,2010-06-20T16:56Z,@OSiRASE Good for you...I hope you are happy now...
,HolyEx,2010-06-22T00:42Z,You don't have any idea why the screen just goes black and nothing happens when I launch the game do you?
,Simski,2010-06-22T14:16Z,"I'm getting the application load error on Win 7, haven't found out how to fix it yet.
HolyEx, is your graphic card good enough? Do you have DirectX installed? Try running dxdiag from Windows->Run."
,Aevis,2010-06-22T23:19Z,"Works fine, but the AI does some weird shit... Just spams lands all the way through game. Nothing else. Is there any fix? It gets kinda boring to play those kinds of games..."
,darthge,2010-06-23T00:45Z,"i cant make this work, this crack have a incopiable file, what did u guys do? "
,Eleron,2010-06-23T09:50Z,Trojan....again. Do not download it
,ArchNova,2010-06-23T15:27Z,Norton and AVG shows that Steamclient.dll is infected with packed.vmpbad!gen1
,SnowbmX,2010-06-25T18:46Z,trojan here aswell...
[T],gamerguuy,2010-06-26T18:18Z,That is a normal thing.Cracks are always detected by the anti viruses  because these cracks do not have digital sign and certificate and thats why.
,Jok3r219,2010-07-01T16:36Z,im not familiar with mounting .bin and .cue files....what exactly do i need to do after i extract with winrar and have those two files on my desktop?
,Jok3r219,2010-07-01T17:45Z,"if someone could make this a simple iso image that would be fantastic...i keep getting ""application load error 5:0000065434"""
,MickoZRC,2010-08-22T16:09Z,"hi people.I have installed MtG duels of planeswalkers an' of course doesn't work.I did everything you said,but nothing.He say ""your system does not meet the minimum specification to run Duels of the Planeswalkers"" I don't know anymore what the do.Some say it doesn't work on Windows XP.Tell me is it true ,if is not what i do..... "
,kolayhe,2010-09-12T19:50Z,"the dll is in fact a nasty little virus, the skidrow torrents for this game fuckup the computer and gave a test machine of mine blue screens constantly, and it had more than the required specs

dont download these skidrow MTG games..."
,dinksmallwood,2011-01-06T02:53Z,"Works for me (no virus either).
Working fine on Windows 7 desktop.  I also have it working perfectly on a HP 311 netbook so I doubt any respectable desktop should have trouble."
,Mesto53,2011-06-02T06:50Z,"I've popped this on the other two torrents, but let's make the trifecta to hopefully pool together what we learn..
To save some grief, you need Service Pack 3 in order to play (I'm on WinXP).  Also, to change your name.. I used good ol' ''Cheat Engine"" hex editor, changed all of the instances of SKIDROW to what I want, now they know who's name to say. :) Hope this helps guys, Thank you gamerguuy!"
