One  Night In Paris  is a video depicting Paris Hilton and her then-boyfriend Rick Salomon engaging in relations. 
Although Salomon was initially blamed for leaking it onto the Internet, those allegations have never been substantiated.
 The video was released shortly before Hiltonâ€™s TV series The Simple Life debuted, causing a sensation. Salomon originally sued Hilton for defamation when Hilton claimed publicly that she was "out of it" and didnâ€™t know what she was doing during the filming of the video. 
Hilton also sued Salomon over the release of the tape, but settled out of court in July 2005. According to reports, Hilton was awarded up to $400,000 and planned to donate a percentage to charity. 
However, in a 2006 interview with GQ magazine, she stated: "I never received a dime from (the video). Itâ€™s just dirty money and (Salomon) should give it all to some charity for the xxxually abused or something.
