TvTeam has come to be the only source, that I trust for burn tested dlds. Most all the rest seem to leave there material encrypted, to where they can't be encoded and burned, which is a terrible waste of dvd discs! Could you please upload a movie called ""Gang of Roses"" ?? There's only one available on TPB and it's rars.. Thanks for your consideration, and all the great movies!"
