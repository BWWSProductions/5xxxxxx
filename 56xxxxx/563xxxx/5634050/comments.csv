nice torrent maar er zit geen keygen bij"
,beserke121,2010-06-18T18:47Z,"Is the CS5 Keygen by X Force in there?


Also, since your screenshot has a mac serial, does that mean that this upload can be used to install cs5 on macs?"
[T],NLUPPER,2010-06-18T20:14Z,"@Night-Shine

Open ISO 1 Met Ultraiso en wedden dat je de KEYGEN ziet

@beserke121
KEYGEN is inside ISO 1 open it with Ultraiso"
,Night-Shine,2010-06-19T00:06Z,"NLUPPER bedankt 

ik dacht dat het gewoon een los programatje was

Night-Shine"
,beserke121,2010-06-20T01:32Z,"@NLUPPER
Gotcha. Thx. But can I use these two isos to install cs5 on a mac, since the keygen has a mac serial."
,beserke121,2010-06-20T01:33Z,"Also, can we apply updates to this? When I had CS4 (torrented version), I could apply updates, but is that the case for this torrent?"
,beserke121,2010-06-20T02:08Z,"Sorry for so many questions, but I do have one more: How do you install with 2 isos? Do you mount the first one and then install, then when it asks you for disc 2, unmount disc1 and mount disc2? I don't have double-layer dvds so I'm not sure how this is gonna work."
,beserke121,2010-06-20T20:55Z,"@NLUPPER
Forget the last question. Does the Activation Disabler only run on Windows? If so, does that mean that these two isos can't be used to install cs5 on a mac?"
,beserke121,2010-06-20T21:21Z,IT DID NOT INSTALL ACROBAT!
,cheno1115,2010-06-21T17:56Z,"@beserke121 You can just get Acrobat 9 from any other torrent here on tpb. The programs are separate, so they wont conflict with each other. It's also the exact same Acrobat released in CS4 so its not any different."
,Pollux101,2010-06-21T18:14Z,"The fact that Acrobat is not included points to the fact that this is probably the trail version and not retail.
Can anybody confirm that Acrobat is not included and if Encore works? Because Encore will install with the trail version but won't work. "
,beserke121,2010-06-21T20:25Z,Encore works.
,wtfwtf222,2010-06-21T20:34Z,"this is the actual release. if you want the acrobat, it is seperate and doesn't come with the 2 dvds. "
,TR2n,2010-06-21T22:01Z,"What am i doing wrong?

When i try to open a program im getting a trail message. (by all of them)

U only have to double click disable_activation.cmd right?

Or do i have to put this file in every adobe file and then double click it?"
,Pollux101,2010-06-21T22:23Z,You only need to run disable_activation.cmd once. You don't need to place it in the installation directory. When using it in Vista or 7 make sure you run it it as admin. If it doesn't work the install text even tells you how to do it manually. 
,Pollux101,2010-06-21T22:24Z,Oh and it looks like the real retail release. Encore works and during install I saw some third party stuff flash by. But still strange that Acrobat isn't included. 
,TR2n,2010-06-21T22:47Z,"@Pollux Thx for the reply!

I did run the disable_activation.cmd once,
and it work when i started photoshop,
but when i tried to start it for the second time it gave me the serial expired(or something) message.

Maybe an error in my system? (win 7) 
I wil try a second install
FOR THE RECORD my cs4 also seems to have problems with registation stuff after about 2 days of install. :s"
,Ooinn,2010-06-22T00:14Z,"Which 'Acrobat' are we talking about? the Acrobat 9 Pro that's listed in the description or Acrobat Reader?

-still in the process of d/ling this; so that's why I'm asking-"
,jgoodwin27,2010-06-22T04:06Z,"I didn't download this one specifically but I'm getting a error opening encore saying that 'it cannot run on royalty free activation' or some crap like that, but i put in a cracked serial, ran an activator switched out the .dll and blocked the host files, 

what am i doing wrong?"
,Pollux101,2010-06-22T22:17Z,"@TR2n: Make sure you run it with the elevated rights (right click activation disabler and select 'run as administrator') If it doesn't work change your host file manually as explained in the readme. 

@Ooin: We're talking about Acrobat Pro

@jgoodwin: You probably have a trail version, then Enccore won't work. Get this version instead.

@Dizzydancer: No experience with Ultraiso. Try it with Daemon Tools Lite. Mount ISO 1 one and when the installer says so mount ISO 2. Worked for me. "
[T],NLUPPER,2010-06-22T23:14Z,"@Pollux101

Thanks for your answers, good job.

Most of my uploads game from a server, so i can not always answer the questions, if my source give incorrect info i can nothing do about it.

I have installed this version on my win vista x64 used Ultraiso, mount it and when it ask for 2de dvd unmount and mount, works fine with me.

Sorry my English, i am dutch."
,wtfwtf222,2010-06-23T00:43Z,can we update this? 
,TR2n,2010-06-23T00:46Z,"Ok THX, it works now! (i hope for long time:p)

Before second instal, i deleted old cs4 files(forgot about those on first install) 

Then i richt clicked activation disabler and run it as administrator. (i just double clicked it on first install)

And before second install i put the line 127.0.0.1 adobe.activation.com line in host file.

Maybe the first 2 methods above were enough, i dont know, but it works now.

TY for upload(NLUPPER) and comments(Pollux101)."
,Pollux101,2010-06-23T18:17Z,Yes updating works........for now at least. 
,drofnil,2010-06-25T17:06Z,The Keygen has a trojan. Are people just using it anyway?!?
,Harutik_11,2010-06-27T11:35Z,"@drofnil its a false positive, dont worry about it."
,delshwaria,2010-06-27T16:39Z," install_color_finesse3_win.txt

it says
to install Color Finesse 3

well please tell me how to do this. thanks for the upload-- I have been looking for a working version of this everywhere. thank you very much."
,Pollux101,2010-06-28T13:18Z,Virustotal has 15 of 40 scanners report a Trojan on the keygen but they are almost all generic. So most likely a false positive.

,wilsen3,2010-08-13T09:41Z,"This torrent works great. installed on 2x win7 x64 and 1x win7 x86 systems. 3x times all OK.

the only problems i had was with Indesign and Illustrator (both programs closes themselves after loaded fully in windows). the rest of the CS5 programs work great with the activator. 

however after countless trials - found the solution. this solution worked out well for the 3x installations i mentioned above. [hope it does to you]

03. when prompted for serial, choose trial version (without serial)
04. complete installation

- Adobe Illustrator (program closes itself without explanation/error message as soon as it its fully loaded)
- Adobe Indesign (program closes itself with an error in the activation process after it is fully loaded)

06. close all programs and restart windows
07. upon restarting, mount installation disc 1 and execute installation again
08. when prompted for serial, choose trial version (without serial)
09. select to reinstall ONLY those ADOBE programs with error - i.e. Illustrator and Indesign
10. upon completing the reinstallation of Illustrator and Indesign, terminate any internet connection (not sure if this step is necessary but I did read some other adobe activation instruction to switch off internet connection - no harm trying anyway)

The reason you are not allowed to edit your host file is a stupid user account issue on Windows 7 (maybe Vista too, i never used it). Even when you're an administrator, you're not really an administrator. Windows is very protective of its system files. 

You must either right click on notepad icon and choose ""Run as administrator"". Then you can save the file in the system folder. 
Or you can save it elsewehere and then drag it into that folder. On the prompt you just have to click and accept that you're an administrator.

You should also check your Folder Settings in Control Panel so that ""Hide extension for known filetypes"" is not checked. This as Notepad likes to save the file as .txt, and if it does you need to remove it otherwise the hosts-file won't function. "

,mkcpys,2010-09-05T06:49Z,"My first comment on the Bay.
I couldn't help comment on such a damn fine upload.

Thanks NLUPPER! You kick @SS.

Directions are simple for those who know what they're doing.

I suggest 1) Mount DVD1 & copy the keygen rar file to desktop and run in Sandboxie. 2) Run the install with the two DVDs using the serial generated from keygen 3) While the install is running add Adobe IPs to the hosts file 4) After the install is done run the ""disable_activation.cmd"" and you're done.

I don't think there are any viruses, but I run keygens in Sandboxie anyway.

Here's some help for the noobs.

First, I suggest you use two tools to help you install Adobe CS5 Master Collection from the 2 .ISO (DVD Image) files. 

1) Daemon Tools Light (Google it): As long as you're using it for ""personal use"", it's free. While you can use any cd/dvd emulation program for mounting .ISO files I suggest the free Daemon Tools. You will use this tool to ""mount"" the .ISO file so that your computer sees it as a CD/DVD Rom disk, and lets you run it.

2) Sandboxie (Google it): Sandboxie is a free program that allows you to run programs sandboxed so that they can't make changes to your system. You will use this tool to run the keygen inside the first .ISO.

Install both of these programs first.

The previous instructions by chostetler15 work just fine, however, here are my updated instructions.

1) After you've downloaded the files, mount the first .ISO file (MasterCollection CS5 D1 Win.iso) using Daemon Tools. It's really easy to do. Right click on the file and select ""Open With"" -> ""Daemon Tools"". 

2) Once the file is ""mounted"" your computer will treat it as double layer DVD and you can run it, but before you run the install you'll want to browse the DVD in windows explorer and under the ""Crack.win"" folder you'll see .rar file called ""xfadobe-master-cs5-keygen.rar"". Copy the .rar file onto your desktop.

3) Once the file titled ""xfadobe-master-cs5-keygen.rar"" is on your desktop, right click on it and select ""Run Sandboxed"". This step is important because you can never be sure. Better save than sorry. Generate a key while running the keygen in a Sandbox with Sandboxie. Now copy that key and use it later when Adobe's installation asks you for a serial number.

4) Now you can run the installation from the mounted DVD. You can start the installation in a number of ways, but the easiest way is to go to the DVD drive under ""Computer"" in the start menu and double click the DVD drive. The Install will start right up.

5) The install is pretty straight forward. Just enter the serial you generated when the installation process asks you for a serial.

6) About half way through the install it will ask for the second DVD. All you have to do is open Daemon tools Mount and Drive Manager (right click on the Daemon Tools icon in the notifications bar). Inside the Mount and Drive Manager click the ""Umount"" icon and click the ""Add File"" icon. A windows explorer dialogue will open up , so just browse to the second .ISO (MasterCollection CS5 D2 Win.iso) and open it. Now you will notice that Daemon Tools added that .ISO file to the ""Image Catalog"" (above in the Mount and Drive Manager window). Select the second .ISO and click the ""Mount"" icon. Now you've mounted the second dvd. If you haven't changed Windows (Vista/7) default a window will pop up and ask you what you want to do with the DVD, but you can disregard that. Just go back to the Adobe installation and click ""Continue"" in order to continue the install. 

7) While it's installing you should edit your hosts file. In order to do this:

Click Start â€“ search for â€œNotepadâ€œ, right-click and select â€œRun as Administratorâ€œ. This should launch notepad with elevated privileges. Now, open the host file from the File menu by going to Computer -> C: -> Windows -> System32 -> Drivers -> Etc -> hosts

Open the hosts file, add these lines under where it says # ::1 localhost (So it will look like this):

# ::1 localhost
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127"
,mkcpys,2010-09-05T06:53Z,"One more thing for the noobs. I forgot to mention the obvious. You'll have to unzip, or unrar, the xfadobe-master-cs5-keygen.rar file first, before you can run the keygen in Sandboxie. I suppose you could run the unzipper/unrar program in Sandboxie as well, but that's not required."
,montypi,2010-09-06T12:43Z,"I gotta wonder... Although I'm sure this is legit looking at comments and the number of seeders, why the hell is this master collection about 13GB, whilst the Mac version is only about 6GB?"

My firewall is set to allow adobe to update, and my hosts file is OK, anyone have any ideas.

Dear Adobe

Fuck you for selling this piece of shit software for more than 5000$! 

This program is not even worth a price tag of 50$ - 20$ or less! 

I believe that is one of the major reasons why I/we ''normal'' people, choose not to buy this and decides to download it for free instead.

Think again Adobe; greed is killing your own businesses.

Mount cd 1, start autorun
Didn't use keygen but a key that was posted here (1325-1190-0233-3931-5450-9127)
When setup asked for CD 2, unmounted CD 1, mounted CD 2 in MagicISO and let it finish the job.
After installation I downloaded and installed the Camer RAW plugin and that works perfectly too.

The program did ask me to register once now and I assume it will keep on doing that once in a while, since it's a 'forever trial'. But that doesn't bother me, I just saved â‚¬1000,00 :)"

,kane2111,2011-02-24T02:44Z,"It sorta works, but there is still a major issue.  First of all, I had to follow the steps listed on page 9 by depressao to prevent the application from constantly asking for a valid serial key.  Those steps involve replacing the amtlib.dll in various folders of CS5 with a patched versions.

For a little while, this worked perfectly.  I had no issues.  However, I'm not sure if it was because I rebooted or relaunched teh application, but it soon had a major problem I'm unable to fix... Dynamic Link no longer works.

If I'm in Adobe Premiere CS5 and try to send a sequence to After Effects, I'll get an error that says: ""adobe dynamic link requires adobe production premium"".   Additionally, if I attempt to render a sequence using Adobe Media Encoder, it will launch Adobe Media Encoder, but the sequence never actually gets added to the queue... I think this is because Adobe Media Encoder uses Dynamic Link in order for this process to work.  (Note:  you can still export directly from Premiere, but the inability to use Media Encoder's queue is a problem)

All the research I have done says that the solution (for legit copies of CS5) is to simply ""launch Premiere... click on ""help"" and then ""deactivate"" to temporarily deactivate CS5... then re-launch Premiere and reactivate with your serial number.""  ... However, my ""deactivate"" button is greyed out... which suggests to me that the crack/patch only worked temporarily and that teh app is now permanently in trial mode .    

Any suggestions to fix this?"

,kane2111,2011-03-15T19:51Z,"It doesn't actually work.  I doubt it's ""working"" for anyone who claims it actually is working.  

Let me explain:  All the ""activator patches"" are actually doing is just keeping the software in demo mode.  This might be fine for some things, but it actually leaves certain applications limited.  

For example... if you try to use Premiere CS5, the adobe dynamic link will NOT work.  It also will limit Adobe Media Encoder to only 5 exporting formats.  You can tell it's not working, because if you click on ""help"" the deactivate option will be permanently greyed out.

Now... I've noticed that if I replace the ""patched"" amtlib.dll with the ""unpatched"" amtlib.dll, I'm able to run the software and it will once again ask me for a CD key.  I put in one of the various keys I've seen mentioned on this forum and everything goes back to 100% activated (with dynamic link working, with tons of export options in Media encoder, etc).  Then I replace the amtlib.dll with the patched version and It continues to work 100%.  However... I think anytime I reboot my machine it reverts back to being locked into trial mode (with limited features) ... I'm not sure how that is happening.  I definitely have my hosts file updated... seems there's something that keeps catching it's a bogus CD key."

,SaturnHex,2011-04-07T22:10Z,"Downloaded and working. Decided to make a guide based on what I did.

1. You will need to edit a host file in your system to keep adobe from phoning home. Here's how if you haven't done it before. http://win711.blogspot.com/2009/12/how-to-disable-activation-for-any-adobe.html

2. Now use Daemon Tools Lite to mount the first iso. Don't bother mounting them both at the same time.

3. Run the disable activation script included in the first disc (not sure if this is needed with the first step host edit but I ran it anyway, also you may have to run as admin). Run the first disc .exe as you would any normal DVD. Adobe installer will open. Skip CS Live registration if you wish.

4. Use one of the keys as provided by rajput145 on page 10:

1325-1263-0034-6192-0472-9778
1325-1157-8207-7707-9798-6532
1325-1319-1010-6434-1955-4619
1325-1870-2938-9873-5356-2624
1325-1174-1834-0596-8505-0323
1325-1271-7898-3364-1803-3655
1325-1823-6020-0958-5549-2729
1325-1177-2533-5307-9327-8593
1325-1960-8746-4023-7312-2320
1325-1095-0854-7085-2679-7165

5. Let the installer run, when it asks for the second disc, unmount the first iso and THEN mount the second. Click continue.

Opening a program should work the first time with no prompts for serials or activation. Its safe to update all the programs using Adobe Application Manager. And yes you can burn these to physical discs if you want."

,Sandiles,2011-04-28T20:39Z,@ljak its not that the serial doesn't include those programs but its probably because you need a 64-bit system to install the programs. I recommend that you try to find an earlier version of the programs you wanted.
,BainKB,2011-05-01T21:20Z,"SaturnHex's GEM OF INFORMATION helped a bunch. 

For hosts files that cant be edited here's a way for you all :) 


1.       From command line: cd \%systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc  
2.       attrib –s –h –r hosts  
4.       Once finished adding the line: attrib +s +r hosts  "
