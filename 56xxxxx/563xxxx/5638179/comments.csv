,Cradleofa,2010-07-04T21:00Z,can i get password for rar..
,ron292001,2010-07-05T10:05Z,"It isnt a rar file.. After watching it i have to say its a crap cam very dark in lotS of parts of the movie.

Id wait till a better copy is uploaded.."
,blueridgedew,2010-07-10T13:59Z,"ron292001... Are you a complete bottle of flavored shit? These movies are for free! People like you make me want to spit on you when I see shit written like what you just wrote. The movie isn\'t shit folks, but yet I think that it was done rather well for some of what I have downloaded off of any sight like this. I give it a v7 a7 for sure, and well worth the download... thanks for the upload, mrgspott"
,clllare,2010-07-13T16:55Z,great cam A7 V8 decent dl!!nthanks to the uploader.

,af257,2010-07-15T06:05Z,For a cam A7 V9
,af257,2010-07-15T06:05Z,Thanks for the upload!
,NitLions,2010-07-16T08:05Z,"People need to stop saying \""for a cam its blah blah blah.\"" That shit means nothing to us since even the scale becomes your opinion at that point. If you are one of those dickbaskets that needs everything to be perfect you would rate \""for a cam\"" low on the scale. If you are more chill and just happy to get a free movie u may rate it higher \""for a cam.\"" Based more on how easy or hard your scale is rather than the movie itself. Rate it on the regular scale, we can see that its a cam b4 we open the page. If I see a 4, 5 and I read its a cam then I know thats not all that bad. When I see \""for a cam\"" we really have no fucking idea at all what it might look and sound like from your rating. This whole comment of mine is very cuntish, I know, but I think it to be true so deal"
,McFloyd,2010-07-17T02:45Z,"To NitLions:  I agree with you about trying to have a common \""standard\"" for rating and doing the best to not have opinions skew that.  But this... [\""If you are one of those dickbaskets that needs everything to be perfect you would rate \\\""for a cam\\\"" low on the scale. If you are more chill and just happy to get a free movie u may rate it higher \\\""for a cam.\\\""]   This is exactly what you are preaching against and then you say the same thing in the next breath.  I think the majority of the community DOES rate along the same scale and that is that 10/10 is DVD quality.  If the file is of HD quality then add that as a note in the comments with the 10/10 rating.  Naturally, a cam rip will be lower and I agree, it would be more helpful to the community if the scale wasn\'t personally adjusted for this obvious loss of quality."
,musik88,2010-07-19T13:57Z,good quality for cam and 530MiB. thank you mrgspott
,JJthePirate,2010-07-27T10:27Z,"SEEDING as soon as its DL'd, my net connection is nice ;) doing around 3,000kb a sec."
,rhyswilliams999,2010-07-27T22:33Z,"A very good cam, congrats to you mrgspott. The film was good and the quality is definatly good enough for it to be worth downloading. will seed for a good while (least 3x). the speed was very good (250kb/s got it in under an hour) 
Many Thanks. "
,Okelliegh,2010-07-30T21:43Z,"Decent cam, A6 V5.

McFloyd is right, too... when I see ""A9 V9 for a cam"" I know that user is a douche that doesn't know what the fuck is going on. Tool Bag. Give us an honest rating, a perfect BR rip can net an A10 V10, DVD's A9 V9... But we all know cams especially without a good telesync overlay are just shit. Free shit, thanks to the uploaders, but still shit.

So for the love of torrents and bandwidth that isn't free, be objective so that we can have some kind of honesty around here. Yes, honor among thieves can exist.

Thanks mrgspott for a decent, free upload and all the work you did to get this here. Also, grats on the pink skull and keep the free stuff rolling.

Remember, seed, don't leach."
,magee89,2010-08-08T11:10Z,Apparently some people would quite happily eat dog shit because It's free.

,aaaahh,2010-10-14T02:16Z,"@shinobiXRT:
the Jesus??
and btw Christ means king or something like that so he can say wtf he wants, it's a free world ey? so stop your fucking dictatorship christianity fuckhead

+ thx mrgspott

ps. i agree with those who said the rating  system should be like bluray = 10/10 (it's the best out there) dvd = 8/10, and that the quality should be measured by that standards and not against other cams .ds"
,belask,2010-10-18T03:46Z,print is bad however not bad for a TS.
,shinobiXRT,2010-10-20T18:06Z,"@ aaahhshole

shows you what an idiot you are, you DONT know what christ means, and I am not christian, you typical ignorant athiest zombie"
,aaaahh,2010-10-20T19:00Z,"hahaha christ isnt Jesus's name you know, its a form of the greek word for messiah which means ""the anointed one"". and you are more a zombie if you are forced  by your parents/country to believe what some HUMANS wrote like 1400-2600 years ago instead of forming your own oppinion... but you are prolly muslim and you dont have any freedom so not that strange that you think as you do..."
,laned130,2010-10-20T19:29Z,"Why do ppl want to rate the quality regardless of the format?! It seems totally illogical - why restrict the range like that?

The only ppl who wouldn't understand are the ones who've never seen a CAM/TS. There's no real way of telling whether you'll find cams acceptable without watching one: at which point it would be helpful to know how this cam compares with other cams."
