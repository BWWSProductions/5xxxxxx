           Blustery funnyman Lewis Black hits the stage for this          
           Comedy Central special, which finds the comic using his        
           wry observational humor to skewer everything from              
           Washington politicians and the tanking economy to cell         
           phones and getting old. Filmed at the landmark Fillmore        
           Detroit theater in 2009, this film also finds Black            
           ranting and raving about religion -- especially when           
           mixed with politics -- and much more.
