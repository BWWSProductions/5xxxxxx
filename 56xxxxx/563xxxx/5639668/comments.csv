,TheBigHase,2010-06-21T15:57Z,"""The Passing"" still crashes - but I'm getting used to it lol "

,laitblade,2010-06-22T04:22Z,and im confused about the options 3 and 4 
,TheBigHase,2010-06-23T16:06Z,WARNING! My Adaware has found a Trojan in the update exe! So that is the meanest thing u fucking fuck! Asshole! SOB!!!  And this is no fake post from me! Just found out and give warning to others ! Please report if u find s.th. too! Yeah u sure a damned motherfucker hope u get banned from TPB ASAP!!!
,TheBigHase,2010-06-23T16:10Z,"Sry it was AVG who gave a sudden Alert ! It's a Trojan called ""Delf.RPA""  ! "
,TheBigHase,2010-06-23T16:18Z,"It's the ""Update.exe"" which is in the L4D2 Programfolder! My AVG is going mad with warnings all of a sudden! Pray to your god which should be the devil from my guess that we never meet in real life, BASTARD!"
,trimidogg,2010-06-24T11:18Z,"""TheBigHase"" why you keep on following my uploads and tank shit you really are just a fucking retard also we already been thro this AVG fake alert dude go get a life and don't login to insult thro internet if you have balls do it in real life stupid "
,TheBigHase,2010-06-24T17:40Z,"Why? A Trojan is nothing to mention? I see! OK I did explain to you some things on your other upload link  BUT if u mean I don't have balls , wrong u are  cos I would like to meet u in person a lot especially after u offended my mother - but that may not happen since I won't tell you where I come from and u won't either so what! But I do have balls you can count on that! Actually argueing on the net is useless but I have never offended anyone - only in defense and in our case it could be a misunderstanding as it started but I will never apologize ! YOU went too far - that's a bottom line! And I am just someone who does give feedback and support or tries to help  - others don't have the balls doing even that! (not u )  And: if u know how to fix the prob with ""The Passing"" whay not telling others!?  Also I told u before that everything else runs fine with no prob! And I did THANK YOU didn't I !?"
,K.I.A.,2010-06-27T17:45Z,"Doesn't ****ing work for me! :((((( When I try to run NOTHING happens...I've pressed ""Enter"" multiple times but nothing happened. The crack is screwed I think. What the **** should I do?!!! PLEASE HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!!!"
