,verdentPI,2010-06-19T07:38Z,"cool, good job k1llj0y, this version is probably the best one out there.   it's too bad nobody wants to seed it tho, i've already uploaded 22 gigs so far and i'm the only one seeding it now?"
,ajdoms,2010-06-20T21:43Z,will it work in 3.71 m33-2? and/or is it okay to update my psp to higher system or will it affect my downloaded games? i just worried that if i update it i won't be able to download games on it... thanks..
,Morphined,2010-06-21T13:25Z,"Hangs up during the mission ""Infiltrate the US missile base"" chapter 4. Probably a hardware issue.

@ajdoms
Upgrading to m33-6 5.00 won't do any harm, as the game won't run on your CFW probably"
,k1LLj0y,2010-06-22T14:51Z,"@verdentPI
I stopped seeding also I was the only one. I start seeding again now
@Morphined
I'm past that lvl and had no hangups. It mite be your hardware. Are you on a 2000,3000? "
