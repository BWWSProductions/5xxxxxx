,hortonofdoom,2010-09-22T18:44Z,Doesn't work with Win-7 64. Guess its too old because it says i dont have enough memory. Im pretty sure my memory fuck the brains out of lucas arts anyday soo its either broken or not working for win XP +
,DeadlyBlueHack,2010-12-24T13:42Z,"Ok this is a great game i haven't seen for years and YES this torrent does work (I have Windows 7 64). After downloading extract file to location of your choice. Open file and click on install.exe, the game will then install (although when the installer was finished it did freeze, and I had to use task manager to exit it, but it did install) The contents of the file will change and you will see a Game folder now. In the game folder there will be a file named Battlefields.exe drag it and create a shortcut on your desktop. After that it should run fine, it did for me, although I did notice it plays better if you change your monitor resolution to 800x600 while you play and change it back to whatever when u r finished. I hope this helps everyone out, and also i am looking for an invite to demonoid if anyone can send me one my email is DeadlyBlueHack@live.com......SEED TILL YOU BLEED!!!!!!!!!!"
,gambitjack,2011-02-02T05:32Z,hey i didnt figure out how to get rid of that box thing. i can not fully install the game... what should i do?
,TheTrueLM,2011-07-19T11:54Z,"I got the game to install and it's working fine except for that there is no sound once I enter into a skirmish game.

I went back into the system files for the game and found out that none of the sound files work. I tried to play them in my Media Player, but none of the sound files play sound.

I checked the other voice sounds, etc. they's working just fine, it's just the sound effects don't work.

Anyone know a fix for this? I'm going to download another SWGB torrent and move the sounds from the new one to this torrent version and see if that works. Otherwise, help would be nice."
