Honkytonk Man and Rob Black Don't Join Awesome Bomb Fight Radio!

It turns out that Rob Black is still in jail and Honkytonk Man failed to call in due to "getting some black pussy!"... but we thought it was gonna happen so here is the write up we had

Joining us first will be the Greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time!! The Honky Tonk Man! The longest reigning IC champ in history is coming on to give us the low down on the new Legends of Wrestling Music Tour he is embarking on with Jimmy Hart, Koko B Ware, and Hillbilly Jim. We also want to talk with him about what Jake The Snake said about him on the show a couple weeks ago, TNA, Eric Bischoff and all the other controversy HTM keeps himself surrounded with! Then! Fresh out of prison after a railroading on obscenity charges we are going to have one of the most controversial figures in the history of wrestling... the owner of Extreme Associates adult entertainment company.. the former owner of XPW Wrestling ROB BLACK! The former owner of XPW now hates pro wrestling and pro wrestlers and is coming on to lay it all out for us. Black is never short on words or opinions and this interview looks to be absolutely explosive to the max! Honky Tonk Man's Official Website
