This is the last matchup for Season Seven!!

Vendetta steps on the mat for some last minute practice going into the world renowned Summer Vengeance Tournament. Vendetta is a past Ultimate Surrender Champion, and no wrestler has ever won the title twice. Vendetta wants to be the first.

Allie Haze has no hope of winning. However, she doesn't know that, and honestly puts up a heroic effort. Oh she gets her ass kicked, her pussy fingered, and is forced to submit 5 times during the match, but she never gives up or gives in. This wrestler will be one to watch next season.
