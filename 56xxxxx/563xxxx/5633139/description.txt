Storyline:

When a notorious, highly sophisticated counterfeiter murders his partner, Secret Service agent Richard Chance (William Petersen)
launches a furious vendetta to capture the man responsible.
But master counterfeiter Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe) is always just one step ahead of Chance in William Friedkinâ€™s thrilling, suspenseful crime drama.
With violent shoot-outs and a turbulent chase scene reminiscent of Friedkinâ€™s own The French Connection, To Live and Die in L.A. broke with tradition by making
the ostensible hero as morally reprehensible as the villain he pursues.
Clashing with bureaucratic obstacles, Chance is forced to break the rules in order to procure cash for a sting operation, but the risks he takes snowball
into an avalanche of violence and moral repercussions, leading to a morally ambiguous cul-de-sac from which there may be no return.
