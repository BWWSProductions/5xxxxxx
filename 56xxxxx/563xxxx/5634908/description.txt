Cheap thriller about a female vistor from the future!


From IMDB:


Prof. Erling and his financial backer Victor build a prototype time machine to snatch objects from the past. Latest find, a statuette, radiometrically dates to 5200 AD! When this draws colleague Richard Hedges to the island lab, Erling reveals that 20th-century objects put in the machine seem to be "traded" for analogous future objects by intelligent life. And on the sly, Victor's been trying to get a living visitor. Does the future need help, or is the present in danger? Written by Rod Crawford <puffinus@u.washington.edu>

Plot holes: Carbon 14 testing cannot reveal future dates (a possible alternative would be to show a relatively recent artifact date impossibly old because it came from the future).


Plot holes: The Carbon 14 method does not work with metal objects but only on materials that were once living (or part of a living organism). In other words: the method can be applied to such materials as wood, leather and bone - but not metal or mineral.


Factual errors: Professor Erling claims he didn't know the statue was radioactive after he carbon-14 dated it. However, carbon-14, in addition to being itself a radioactive isotope, would certainly reveal the presence of any existent radioactivity.


Factual errors: Although the narrator claims the first satellite launched by "man" was in 1958, it was actually the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 that was first on October 4, 1957. Interestingly, the first *American* satellite, Explorer I, was indeed launched on January 31, 1958 (February 1 in GMT).


Boom mic visible: In the scene where the two scientists to whom Dr. Hedges has sent the statue for analysis discover it is radioactive, the shadow of the boom microphone can be seen on the window blinds.
