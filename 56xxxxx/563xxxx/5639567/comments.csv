MOVIE- Raavan is a total disappointment everythingwise.
Unfortunately, Raavan is high on hype, but low on substance.
specially Govinda 0/10, please stop acting & stay at comedy circus! In one word, Pathetic.

anyways thnks xrg for this quick rip, xrg rockzz

,JadeBoy,2010-06-21T20:48Z,"I agree with spinNET1..

Overhyped movie...the director thinks if the camera is shaky, he's making the movie look cool. Well, its not cool, Maniratnam."

,empty3,2010-06-24T15:25Z,"Thanks.  Finally - ENglish subs!  I have a hard time finding hindi movies with working subtitles.  if anyone can direct me to more hindi movies with english subtitles, I would appreciate it - I am a Canadian trying to learn the language.
dhanyavad!"
,sandpanda,2010-06-25T01:21Z,"@Team-xRG Hey there, I want to download this movie but my Hindi is not fluent.  Can you tell me how to insert Subtitles bro?"
,boyinmoonlight,2010-06-25T23:51Z,Downloading it hope i wnt face any prob and hopefully print is also gud to watch interestingly :)
,empty3,2010-06-26T02:09Z,"sandpanda:  I don't know anything about computers, really.  I use the VLC media player it gave me ENG subs automatically - I find it is the best player to use for this reason.  "
,waqastariq,2010-06-27T13:06Z,"Bhai XRG, why everything in .mp4 now? I can not watch them on DVD Player now. As you know most DVDs play .avi .mpg.

,wierd-old-guy,2010-07-03T21:37Z,"From the standpoint of an American watching an Indian movie:

I was impressed with the cinematography, the scope of the editing, the music & the smooth transition of intensity to story-line.

Friends say this is simply a remake of Ramayana conceptually. I, unfortunately have nothing to make that comparison. To me it's all new.
The women are beautiful, the activity is fast, it's relatively captivating. I enjoyed it.

But then I am comparing it to Hollywood, which has lost most of it's magic & produces 2 or 3 good flicks a year at best. And MOST of THAT is re-makes of truly great concepts. There is little new & original; so I am not expecting wondrous films on a continuum from ANYONE.
To me, it was worth watching."
