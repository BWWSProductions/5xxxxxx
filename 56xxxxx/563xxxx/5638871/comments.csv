Works 100%"
,seven0fnine,2010-06-24T10:22Z,"Yes, this actually works. Thank you for this!

Remember people, you have to reboot twice. First after you run the program and select UNinstall. Then another reboot after you run the program a second time and have selected Install.

So TWO reboots.

Also, for it to work you HAVE TO access microsoft.com/genuine and click the two different buttons there, following the on-screen instructions. 

Here is where some people get an error that the Microsoft Optimum Download thingy did NOT complete correctly. And a s a result the second button is grayed out and not functional.

In order to avoid this problem you MUST click on the top download bar, right under the Explorer toolbar. You will see a small MS Security Shield and a text saying that the website wants to install something.

You HAVE TO let it install this or you will never complete your verification and activate Windows 7.
