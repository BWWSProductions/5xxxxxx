                   Windows 7 Loader v1.8.4 (x86 & x64) - By Daz



Release date: June 19 2010 (06/19/2010):


About Windows 7 Loader v1.8.4 (x86 & x64) - By Daz
**************************************************
The easy and safe way to activate Windows!
This is the loader application thats used by millions of people worldwide, 
well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and 
is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. The application 
itself injects a SLIC (Software Licensing Description Table) into your system 
before Windows boots, this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.


Features
********
- Can be run as a standalone application
- Works well with all system languages
- Argument support for silent installs
- Can be used for pre-activation
- Application integrity checking
- Custom error handling
- Support for hidden partitions and complex setups
- Can work alongside Linux's GRUB or any other boot manager
- Works with TrueCrypt and many other types of hard drive encryption applications
- Add your own certificates and serials externally
- Offers certificate + serial install only for users with an existing SLIC 2.1
- Automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)


The rundown
***********
- This will run on x86 and x64 systems
- This can activate all Windows versions at the same time, 
  just install it on each 
- No core system files get modified
- No extra processes are run so you have nothing eating at your RAM 
- All key parts of the exploit are encrypted with a custom encryption 
- The exploit runs before Windows so it's harder for Microsoft to prevent 
- The exploit patches all necessary tables making activation look authentic 
- The application will select the best profile for your system during install 
- Each and every user has a unique version of the exploit installed on his/her
  system

Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.

* Note: 
Windows 7 N and E editions will only be supported 
when OEM SLP serials leak for them editions.


Application integrity checking?
*******************************
Hover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed 
application information.

Note: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around 
the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path 
is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. 
You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
