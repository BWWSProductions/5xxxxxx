2010 release from the Florida-based Alt-Rockers. Since coming together in 2007,
VersaEmerge have earned attention for their distinctive blend of powerful Pop
sensibility and inventive Post-Hardcore sonics. Fueled by lead
guitarist/programmer Blake Harnage's relentless experimentalism and Kusterbeck's
expressive and energetic vocals, the band has already unleashed a formidable
body of work.
