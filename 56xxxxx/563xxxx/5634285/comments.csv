,drrenfield,2010-06-22T15:17Z,Please seed - a couple of seeds bailed out and left lots of folks stuck at 84.5% :-(
,barrygateaux,2010-06-23T00:01Z,"it was the original uploader that bailed

why upload a torrent if you aren't going to seed it to 100% ?

ah well, let's give him the benefit of the doubt for the moment - maybe his computer's on the blink or something...."
,barrygateaux,2010-06-26T00:05Z,"this is ridiculous

darrencaf - we need you to seed it to 100% first - otherwise no one can get it"
