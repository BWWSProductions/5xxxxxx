Downloaded the torrent. I followed djDEVASTATE2009 instructions but no luck running the game.

I installed Fly II mounting the image file with Daemon Tools. Installation with no problems. When I ran the game it only appeared the welcome screen and then just nothing happened.

I unistall the game with Control Panel and delete the registry with  TuneUp Utilities.

I burned the image with Alcohol. Once again the installation of Fly! II had no problems. When I tried to run the game the Welcome screen appeared and nothing happened.

I have a Dell Vostro MiniTower 220 with Windows XP Pro SP3. 

If some knows the solution please post it here.

I downloaded this game as I have been a long time fan of the fly series from terminal reality, and can't find it in any stores where I live.  After I installed this game the same thing happened to me as to the other user...  it loaded a splash screen and just hung.  I then updated the game with 2 patches and same problem...  Frustrated and disapointed I walked away from my computer and made myself dinner, when I came back a while later I was pleasantly suprised that an options window popped up and after configuration the game worked perfectly.  I am running a 3.8 ghz quad core in XP 32 bit.  For most people waiting a long time for a game to start working is not in there interests, but if you love this game as much as I do, load it up, go do something else and come back.  Keep in mind that users with slower cpu's or running different O/S may not get the same result as me.  I also found a manual online in pdf format and enjoying this game quite a bit.  So once again, if you are dying to play this, just load it and watch tv for 1/2 hour or something.  It's a terrible price to pay but hell I love the game so much I'm willing to tolerate it.  I suspect the delay is due to the game trying to detect video as the option screen that pops up is for selecting direct-x modes and screen res.  This problem however may not happen in old computers however I don't have one to test.  Many thanks to dj for uploading this and I also noticed there are map/scenery addons as well as the patches.  Just search google and you will find. Happy flying!  :)"

I loaded it on an Acer laptop also XP but with 2xMobile Intel 945GM Express Chipset and everything works perfectly.  

Can anyone please suggest a fix for my LG. I downloaded the latest updates and I am runnning Service Pack 3 on both laptops.

FSX works perfectly but has a very poor instrument panel experience.

Thank you from Jay, a very keen 1,500 hour Private Pilot."
