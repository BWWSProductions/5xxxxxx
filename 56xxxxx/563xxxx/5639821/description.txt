Release Notes:
Same video as before....with line audio.It had a bad crop and flicker noise etc, but still nice, well made a avs script with
some filters in it....tweaked the RGB, slightly changed the saturation on the source, didn't seem to bad, added a deblock filter
added a sharpness filter, and a smoothness, it made the video look pretty damn good.... it took just over 9hours to encode but
well worth it...looks pretty sweet if you ask me Audio had a bad crackling noise, removed most of it as we could. Enjoy.
