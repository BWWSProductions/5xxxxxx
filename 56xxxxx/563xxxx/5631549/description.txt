Plot

This video was inspired by the Beatles' Yellow Submarine movie, the animation aspect. There's a little bit of [that] in there too. The video begins with Kesha waking up next to her love interest; she then proceeds to run away while being chased by the man. They are later seen on a boat singing while digitally animated water is added, it then cuts to a scene of all animation. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.
