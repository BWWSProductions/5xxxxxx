I don't mind uploading 1 MB/s if i get 400-500 KB/s in return. Cheers."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-06-16T02:55Z,"Good idea to have 2237 x 2.00 MB pieces.
aoloffline's has 4 MB pieces, so it is slower."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-06-16T03:02Z,"haha, I just realized why is this torrent so fast, because it connects to a semi-private tracker where the peers seed like mad ;-))) (Merci mult romanilor)."

If you don't know & don't understand something it doesn't mean others ""say stupid thing"" and rather stay quite. Lastorrents site is known for it's very fast Dl/Ul, thx to the generous romanians there, and I realized this torrent was added there too under the same hash and so all those peers connect to us.
This torrent is and will much faster then yours, take care. "
[V],IndexTrance,2010-06-16T09:05Z,"Have to barge in and say something. I always download my torrents from 'aoloffline' because then you know you wont get any rared pieces and always great download speed. Just connected to this movie by 'aoloffline'  and my down speed is 3.5/ MB down so i strongly doubt that this torrent beats that speed. Anyway, take care and thanks for the upload tho."
