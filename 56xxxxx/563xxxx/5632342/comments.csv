,irontowngeek,2010-06-17T02:08Z,"I agree.
Been sitting on this one for six hours,and nary a bite.
I'm ready to chuck the thing.
Think maybe he's harvesting IP addresses,or just a noob?
I get a hit on it in BT about every 10 mins,then it goes away. "
,irontowngeek,2010-06-17T06:15Z,"I was hitting around 250kb for about 20 secs,when the bottom fell out.
1 seeder and 24 leechers when I hit 250kb,and now a lowly 1.5kb with 1 seeder and 24 leechers.
What gives?"
,oracle12,2010-06-18T02:11Z,"apolagies for the slow start, but the oldest one has only been seeding for a few days, and thus will take a while to get going, as I am the only one seeding the full file. It will pick up as more of the leechers have more to seed so bear with it, I plan to seed these files indefinately. 
I've just finished and uploaded  4/5, so only part 5 to create. probably have it done for the weekend"
