There was a signal loss for approximately one and a half minutes beginning at about 13:10 in hour 3.  I edited out most of it, but left a bit in so you can get a sense of what happened.

Alex talks with author and a former intelligence agent of the British MI6 John Coleman. Beginning in 1969, Coleman began publishing a series of monographs and cassette tapes documenting the existence of the Committee of 300 and the New World Order. He is the author of Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Committee of 300, Pearl Harbor and Beyond: An account of Treachery and Treason, Gun Control: An Attack on the Whole Constitution and publishes World in Review [magazine].
[from 5:00 until 17:00 in hour 4]

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
