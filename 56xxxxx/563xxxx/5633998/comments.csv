[T],GWpirateGW,2010-06-18T00:36Z,"@heavydiamond thanks dude. 

@noel_lee the flv after converting to ,avi did not read any return stats on ratio. But the audio/visual is very decent. No heads or talking 3rd party or slanted focus. It is one of the better quality cams.

After somebody watches, kindly give us feed back, so others know what to expect & sorry that the file is insanely huge, did not have time to convert the sizing smaller."

,Teeeger,2010-06-23T06:47Z,"It's really tiny picture.  Won't take up whole screen.  Very low quality for 2.42 Gb.  

Found a better one at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5635815/The_Karate_Kid_2010_CAM_Xvid_LKRG

It's still a cam picture but it's a hell of a lot better than this."
