Ok just got home, armed with a new bong, so I better finish this before I forget, hehe.

Using Windows XP with IE7(yeah I prefer firefox, but this works) I simply go to watch a online video.  Once on that page, I proceed to erase all cookies and temp files.

1. delete cookies and temp files in ie 7 or 8.
2. watch online video.
3. go to ie 7 or 8 tools/internet options/ settings(in middle of the window that opens that reads Temporary Internet files View Files.
4. Click for biggest file (should not be many if you deleted the temp files before viewing the video.  It should be in a .flv format.

5. Use a flv converter(I actually used You|||Tube Downloader, which is free) to convert the flv file to a format of your choice.

Hope you guys enjoy

Source...Ripped from a online source, converted the flv file in the temporary file cache to avi. i used a simple flv to avi converter which lacks proper size conversion, hence this enormous file size. It was converted at the highest settings.
