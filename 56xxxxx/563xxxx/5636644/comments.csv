rips getting better
keep it up "
,Saleen90,2010-08-08T10:44Z,I am extremely curious how you are ripping and recording these files. This is by far the best compression I have ever scene. It looks full high def and is only 1.63 GB. Please let me know what programs you are using.
,netrek,2010-08-20T06:18Z,PROPER! THX MATE
,raafi123,2010-11-10T06:25Z,"i'm actually shocked/suprised at the quality Vs size of this movie Cloverfield. i have to save IceBane in my fav.

the Quality of this move is very good! for those of you who prefer the A/V rating
A= 10
V= 10

again i like to mention i'm suprized at the quality(Resolution: 1280 - 720, very good img) VS the size(Total Size: 1.74gb ONLY) 
how do you do it O.0?

Cloverfield is a sifi thriller, with lets say an unexpected ending. i personally enjoyed this movie, and would recommed. this movie has got mixed reviews, some loved it some din't. watch this movie, enjoy the good quality, decide for yourself.
thank you IceBane"
