Ron and Fez 2010-06-17-R&F-CF64k

Editor's Note: I'm missing about 10 minutes of the show (at around 1 hr. 34 min., during the Entourage giveaway), because my recorder decided to be an asshole. Didn't have a backup in place today, so we're stuck with this unless someone comes along with the missing bit. Apologies for that. New recorder in use tomorrow; shan't happen again.

I don't even listen to the Ron & whoever is in-studio besides Fez Show.
Sounds like a good show, I just don't have the time.
