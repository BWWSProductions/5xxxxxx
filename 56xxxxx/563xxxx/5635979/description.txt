This is his last album and was nearly complete when he died in February 1990. Some background vocal and the strings on "I go to pieces" were still to be added.
Jeff Lynne is producer for tracks 1, 3, 6-8 and tracks 2 and 10 together with Mike Campell. Tracks 4, 5 and 9 are produced by Mike Campbell. Tom Petty appears on tracks 1, 6 - 8 on acoustic guitar and background vocals. So if you feel a little of Traveling Wilburys' you know why.
