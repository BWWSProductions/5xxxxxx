I have been working as a professional subtitler and know how much work it is. You have probably gained much experience by now and found your own routines, but there are new and betters tools available all the time if you do some googling. Moreover, there are often subtitles already available if you do some more googling, at least if the DVD has been released in some other language.
Any language will contain the time codes, which is a big job in itself, so that you only have to translate with the same time codes. Professional subtitling has strict rules for when a title shall appear and how long it must be displayed according to the number of words.
Modern films are always produced with subtitles in mind. We professionals get a copy of the original (English) dialogue, often with time codes already set, and only translate these.
Please click on my blue username above if you want to study my technique with optional multisubs. And please send me a private message at the Forum (click below) if you want more communication.
And please remember that this is a Swedish site, so that you don't use words like ""foreign"" without specifying your own nationality."
