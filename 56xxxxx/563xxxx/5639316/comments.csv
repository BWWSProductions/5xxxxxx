It's a slow melodic rock tune from somewhere betweeen the very late 70s and the early 80s. I am not quite sure and maybe I am wrong but the band could be ""Highway"" from Germany because they have a song named ""Up and down the highway"". Any idea or even at your hand? Im still looking for an album of this band since quite a long time. Thanks for any info or upload."
[V],80zforever,2010-06-21T05:42Z,"someone08, I think the song is on the Higway's 1977 lp Up and Down the Highway. They were a German band trying to sound American. Kind of soft rock to progressive. As a matter of fact their 1982 lp Highwaves was not bad but I don't think I have any records from them."

I know this is a bit off topic, but what's the deal with the Quarks single from rare hits vol.45 ""mechanical""...i am quite impressed with that track but cannot find any info about the band. Did they have any other singles? I searched high and low but the Quarks I found don't seem to be the same folks. Thanks for any tips"
[V],80zforever,2010-06-25T19:41Z,"Hey z-nith, they released only one single, the other song is called Working Model. Here's some info on them: http://www.discogs.com/Quarks-Mechanical/master/196364"
