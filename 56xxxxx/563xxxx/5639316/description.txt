I have been listening to some of these songs for almost 3 decades and I still love them! What an amazing genre synthwave/minimal wave is. Now I normally pick what I think is the best song on the mix and that becomes the opening song. However this time it does end with an awesome song that has been my all time favourite synthwave tunes.  Happy listening!
