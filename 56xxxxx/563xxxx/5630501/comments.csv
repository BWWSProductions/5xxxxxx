,sg71,2010-06-16T05:44Z,Is it really too much to ask for a simple paragraph outlining what the torrent is? Even a link to someone else's description. TvTeam have always been good in the past but recently things have been getting lazier.

I feel sorry for whoever might have paid to see this.
Probably from the same makers as quantum apocalypse."
