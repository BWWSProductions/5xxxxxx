The Red Eyes, Melbourneâ€™s Dub/Reggae monster band, continues to wow audiences with their unique sound, combining masterfully produced beats, soulful, heartfelt lyrics and grooves, with shake the house dub rhythms that have set a benchmark for Australian Dub/Reggae.
 
Founded in 2002 as an 11-piece act, The Red Eyes describe themselves as a bit like the hotel California â€“ you can check out anytime but you can never leave. Now with a core group of 7 multi-instrumentalist musical talents, performances can feature up to 12 members onstage, with their recordings including over 30 of Australiaâ€™s most talented musicians. The band is led on stage by enigmatic front man El Witeri who draws on his New Zealand upbringing and Maori heritage for inspiration.
