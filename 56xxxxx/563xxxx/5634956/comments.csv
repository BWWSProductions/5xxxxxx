,ZenRhino,2010-06-18T14:37Z,"I was wondering if you have a documentary from HBO called ""Gasland"" about the dangers of natural gas drilling? I saw a segment about it on Morning Joe (msnbc) and was shocked to see a guy be able to set his tap water on fire out of the faucet! Thanks in advance for any help on this!!

Oh yeah - LAKERS!!!"

,harakeeri,2010-11-18T03:59Z,"great win!....on free throws -.-""
and farmar's gone now. Spurs got their streak back and New Orleans is something to behold. I highly doubt the Lakers will have a 3-peat.

Miami Heat, Orlando, Bulls and the 17-time champions Boston Celtics also stand to say ""NO"" the a Laker 3-peat. Kobe got to hustle his ass if he wants to be half the basketball player Michael Jordan is. And that's an even more impossible feat than a 3-peat right there."
,harakeeri,2010-11-18T03:59Z,"*to say ""NO"" to a Lakers 3-peat"
