,gabriel1475,2010-06-19T08:24Z,"For a low-budget project, extremely well done! 

However, the dialog (in places) is really bad, and has that ""written by a student/noob? vibe, and trying so damn hard to sound like the ?Big Boys?. Otherwise, most all of the other departments did a fabulous job in keeping this project somewhat believable and non-""studenty"". But again, some of the dialog is comically bad, and trying way too hard. And makeup department....really? Nice job of having a scene in which the shine off the lead characters scalp takes precedence over everything else happening. That is a makeup/DP/LD/camera operator, fail!

Overall, a monumental effort. But bad/unbelievable dialog (in parts), laughably bad CGI, and really bad lapses in judgment both during, and also in post production, will keep this from going as far as it might have. I rarely see a project which is winning so heavily in most all areas FAIL so miserably in some fairly minor ones. 

Learn from this, kiddies. CGI is NOT supposed to draw attention to itself. And it's even more (if thats possible) offensive when it not only draws attention to itself, but in a way in which the audience is like ""wow, that's some 1st year CGI work"". Pathetically bad CGI harms a film more with it in, then if it was edited out.  So what if those scenes werent there? Cut out the bad flesh, so the body can live, noob editor/director.

Use your heads people, you obviously have some brains since the overall look and feel of this project were so good. Fire whichever idiots are dropping the ball, he/she/they are screwing up the value of this project."

Yeah, they made this for free... The donations only played a part after the fact and they will directly affect FUTURE episodes. So the episode you're ripping to shit was made for free. So lighten up, don't call willing, dedicated, inspired, hopeful people working for zero dollars 'kiddies'  just because you were expecting a masterpiece. Future episodes will benefit greatly from the donations, not from nit-picking criticisms. Maybe talk about what you liked about the episode? No one's going to look at ""shiny foreheads! trying too hard! bad cgi! Noob director!"" and say ""hey, he's got a point, let's use money we don't have to pay for Avatar-level cgi, a make-up crew, a new director and a lack of ambition!""

This 'review' should be disregarded - it's clearly biased towards criticizing inexpensive aesthetics and making generalized gripes that peak at 'failing miserably in fairly minor' areas.

Give it a shot, people. It's no summer blockbuster but it's interesting and worth a watch."
