Here's a color grid example:

Not complaining, the picture quality is great. And I definitely appreciate people uploading these.
This just gives you a sense of what's being cropped out, and how warped this video is.

(PS - This is the same file as all of the other Toy Story 3 torrents so far, just named differently and slightly stretched vertically) "
,cllgegrl,2010-06-21T06:52Z,I thought the quality was very decent. video 7 / audio 7. Thanks for the upload. :)
