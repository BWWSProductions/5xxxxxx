Bermeja Island was once marked on Gulf of Mexico maps.
Its position was used in treaties to demarcate maritime
elements of Mexico/USA territorial limits in the Gulf.

But it seems to have disappeared and is no longer
marked on maps ... which could move desirable sub-sea
mineral resources into the US' territorial sphere.

Mexico's conspiracy theorists are on the case.
'There is no doubt the gringos are behind this.
Let's not forget that they stole California.'
