Is the audio bad on this one?"
,pdilla,2010-07-01T09:36Z,"V=7
A=10

Hardcoded subs
(Not sure how many times I can stand seeing ""Metal scraping"")
1280x536 
NOT 720p
No problems with audio"

,Smuggles,2010-07-02T16:47Z,thank youuuu
,DaveK92,2010-07-16T22:22Z,"720p is 1280x720 but only at 16:9, if at any other aspect ratio such as 2.39:1 it won\'t be 720. Think of it this way, 720p = 1280 width."

,rapolton,2011-01-08T17:45Z,"Subs were not hardcoded, was able to turn them on and off easily."
