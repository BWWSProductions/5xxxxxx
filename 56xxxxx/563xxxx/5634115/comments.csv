From the game's website forum:

I've verified that all of the sounds and models that have specifically been mentioned so far are indeed in the game. So the possibilities of what is going on is:

1) Your install is pretty broken and you should reinstall
2) You are playing the demo and there is something I need to fix
3) You are playing a pirated version of the game

It's an awesome game, hopefully a fixed torrent appears soon, or this one gets fixed."
,esharoth,2010-06-21T20:57Z,"Someone made a fix for this, I don't want to make a separate torrent for it because it's really small. Just search Google for the terms ""din's curse missing models"" and you'll find it, it's an archive that you'll have to download and place in the Assets folder of the game."
,blargx,2010-06-22T00:39Z,"FIX FOR MISSING TEXTURES:


1. Download this: http://www.shareup.com/Dins_Curse-download-51725.html
2. Install to a different location than this torrent's installation.
3. Copy and replace the ASSETS folder into your cracked installation.
4. Play the game.

Or you can be cool and open the install package in WinRAR and pull the assets folder out."
,blargx,2010-06-22T04:17Z,"Nevermind, that didn't entirely work, just got missing shadow.mdl.

Still looking for a fix."
,blargx,2010-06-22T06:08Z,"This is just an expanded demo. I have been unable to find the complete assets cab files. 

I had a full install of Din's Curse 1.000, sadly though I deleted it. If anyone can upload it, using the crack from this torrent we can have a full release. I'd do it myself but I lack the files."
,blargx,2010-06-24T03:56Z,"Eh sorry about the quadruple post, but the fix is here:
http://www.mirrorcreator.com/files/0BIWUNL9/MissingFilesModv3.zip_links

1. Unpack the contents of the archive to your Din's Curse/Assets folder
2. Play the game.

Note that this doesn't actually contain the sounds/textures, but it prevents the game from crashing due to missing textures. Creatures or elements that this fixes will appear to be solid white."
