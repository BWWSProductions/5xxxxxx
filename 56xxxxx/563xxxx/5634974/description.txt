#### caligari trueSpace 7.6 ####

This 3D modeling package has been released to the public according to the website. It didn't seem right (to me) that 3DS Max should get all the hype around here.

I will seed as long as possible, but if anyone wants to help grab the files off of http://www.caligari.com/ 

It was posted that the site may get shutdown by MicroShaft at any time. Enjoy something free for a change! I did not include trueServe and truePlay in this. If there is interest I or someone else can post a new torrent. I will (probably) also be posting a torrent that includes all of the tutorials and training coarse

trueSpace7.61 workspace only
This is the full 3D authoring package with no time restrictions and no license restrictions on how you use it. This version is the latest release from Caligari with many bug fixes and improvements to the Link Editor. This version has had the legacy Model side removed and features only the new tools in the workspace side. The manual and videos from trueSpace7.61 should be used.
