                           =============================






Between 1968 and 1972, the world watched in awe each time an American spacecraft voyaged to the Moon.Only 12 men walked upon its surface and they remain the only human beings to have stood on another world.

In The Shadow Of The Moon brings together for the first, and very possibly the last time, surviving crew members from every single Apollo mission which flew to the Moon, and allows them to tell their story in their own words. Beautifully shot, this riveting first-hand testimony is interwoven with visually stunning archive material which has been re-mastered from the original NASA film footage - much of it never used before.
