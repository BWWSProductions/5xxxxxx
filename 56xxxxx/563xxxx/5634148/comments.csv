,BinaryProcess,2010-06-18T05:02Z,"Hey TV Team, I love you guys but where is Ep1? Seems some of my favorite reality shows don't get any love... Design Star is missing as well. Thanks for all you do though, this is the only way I can watch TV."
,Klimt_Westwood,2010-06-18T08:53Z,Is there any chance for S01E01? Any outside links?
,surrealchereal,2010-06-19T16:12Z,"The first show is over on Bravo and Hulu

,laptopdog,2010-06-19T17:54Z,"You can only see those if you're watching from America - a lot of us aren't in the USA though. So I would really, really, really appreciate it if you would upload episode 1 or if someone could tell us where to find a torrent of it!

Thanks for any help anyone can give me - I'd really like to watch this show but I want to see the first episode first if at all possible.

Cheers to all!"
