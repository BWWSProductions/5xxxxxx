,DjenghisKhan,2010-06-18T17:03Z,"It's bigger & slower ... added with software you may never want on your machine. And since ""hot"" is the most crappy expression I know - it might just be that!  "

,remie234,2011-04-23T14:27Z,"Thx , nice download , but if you download windows 7 and after that you download the theme is better ... "
,soldierofthelam,2011-06-15T14:04Z,"this isn't the real alienware people, get a clue,
its a modded out Windows 7 piece of junk.

Alienware has the command hub,
Alienware doesn't have the gay music playing during install,
Alienware comes with certain logo's and user pix avatars, this doesn't have!

It Amazes me how not one single person can upload a true Alienware install disk since its been out."
,femin,2011-10-20T19:35Z,do this need a key
,insane319,2012-02-20T04:15Z,"so ive had this downloaded and installed on my laptop for a while now... but now i want to return to my old windows and it wont let me system restore to default or anything before this, how do i remove this??"
,no1isanon,2012-02-20T18:03Z,@insane319 you cant just restore you have to reinstall whatever you had before
