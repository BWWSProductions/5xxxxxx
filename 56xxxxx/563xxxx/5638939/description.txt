This is a beta release, keep it in mind please.

Has been tested on a 2nd Gen iPod touch (none MC)
with iPod2,1_4.0_8A293, worked fine. Did not need
developer UDID.

Will not work with MC (late model 2nd Gen Touch).
Have also heard that it does not work for 3rd Gen
Touch. 

Unsure of what IS and IS NOT supported. So if you
have success, please comment.
