The mixtape is born! Call it a little present from me before I drop the big fourth album Method to the Maadness this summer, For now, hereâ€™s quick thing I threw together in a week (7 days for real). The tapeâ€™s called Jack Bauer: The 7 Day Edition and I named it that because I felt like Jack from â€˜24â€² working to a deadline to get this shit done ever since I opened my big fuckinâ€™ mouth and said that I could do it. But yes, I does this!


This is a very good mixtape! I couldn't find it as a torrent so i thought i'd post it as my first. Enjoy!!
