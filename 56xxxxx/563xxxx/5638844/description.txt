Desc: Hwang Jang Lee, the undisputed lord of the 
boot, stars as a traveling bootman who falls 
victim to a local boot gang, or so they think!
Hwang reunites with his boot buddies from Hitman
In The Hand of Buddha to deliver a tour-de-force
action piece.

Notes: The 2nd of the 9 bootleg kungfu dubs. I found
these in an old box of VHS tapes cleaning up my 
basement. If you're into poorly dubbed wacko kungfu
movies, where a punch makes a high snapping noise,
and lip movements don't match the dialog, these are
for you. Once again, I love the cockney accents on 
these chinese people, LOL. The Pan&Scan is from the
VHS, not my doing (it's most obvious on "THE END" 
at the end.) Again, if you know the original movie,
please enlighten the rest of us.
