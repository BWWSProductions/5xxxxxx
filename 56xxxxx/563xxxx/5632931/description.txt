Thousands of German PoWs were forced to work
in Britain after WWII. This is part of the tale.

In the same general area, there are details
of a disputed 1989 book called 'Other Losses'
at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Losses

This book claims that a million or more German
PoWs died in Western Allied (ie - not Russian) 
hands in the period after the end of WWII.

I was very sceptical about many of the book's
findings when it was first published, but I've
become less so as this other stuff surfaced.

I'm still not convinced, but something stinks.
