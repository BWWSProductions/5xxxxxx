,fumideh,2010-12-23T23:45Z,"Torrent does not work under Win 7. The install button does work but you need to be patient. The keygen was applied successfully but at startup a serial number is still required before the app will run. The bugfix.reg does noting that I can discern.

Bad torrent and poor description on how to successfully install this app."
,fumideh,2010-12-24T01:14Z,"I take the above back but still stick by my comment about the mediocre instructions.

The Serial Number, along with the Machine ID and Activation Code are all visible in the keygen app after selecting Sound Foirge 10.0 series from the drop down box.

Enter the Serial when Sound Forge starts, select register on another computer option and save the file with any data. Clicking forward brings up the space for entering the Activation Code. Follow that and viola.

This should allow you to test the full functionig app before you buy."
,vladocq,2011-01-14T23:10Z,"The torrent does work with Windows 7, you just have to right click keygen and run as administrator and you should be fine."
,doratho,2011-01-20T18:47Z,"This torrent is fine. The steps u have to follow are:
1. Install it.
2. Add Keygen to the installation folder (PROGRAM SHOULD BE CLOSED OR NOT OPENED)
3. Run keygen as ADMIN and click PATCH (DO NOT CLOSE KEYGEN)
4. Run program
5. Next... Copy Serial from keygen (DO NOT CLOSE KEYGEN)  and click next until they ask you to register online or by another pc, GET THE 2nd OPTION
6. Neeeext until it ask u the activation code, get it from the Keygen.
7. U should have this program running."
,SixStringSlinger,2011-02-12T03:52Z,"Sony Sound Forge 10 Series installation instructions:

 1. Uninstall the old version of SoundForge & delete every Sony/Soundforge related file or folder
     you can find. (this step is really important). Now clean the registry and restart your computer.
 2. Install the new SoundForge software, but do not run it after the installation is complete.
 3. Now run the Sony keygen. (You don't have to run it as administrator)
 4. Select SoundForge 10 Series from the drop down list.
 5. Click on patch and make sure you select ""C: / Program Files / Sony / SoundForge Pro 10"".
 6. The software will patch itself within this folder...you'll see a ""Patched Successfully"" message.
 7. Now copy both the Serial (164-etc) & Authentication code (54 characters) from the keygen
     and paste them into the spaces below. (Don't click on the generate button).

                            Serial:
     Authentication Code:

 8. Now close the keygen software.
 9. Click on the ""SoundForge Pro-10"" icon to start the registration process.
10. Select the ""Register from another Computer"" option and click next.
11. Copy and paste the 164...Serial number from above, (15 characters) and click next.
12. Fill in the useless, fake personal information section & save file to wherever (Documents).

14. The Sony SoundForge software will now be fully activated and ready to use.
15. Keep this info' for future installation reference."
,SixStringSlinger,2011-02-12T03:55Z,"You should copy and paste these instructions above into notepad.
It will be easier to follow."
,RAND0L,2011-02-23T06:00Z,@doratho great comment u saved me from my huge headache by saying run as admin
,npat0,2011-02-24T19:44Z,Followed everything to the dot.it just DOESN'T patch says error while patching files.tried re-installing too :s
,npat0,2011-02-25T09:41Z,Sorry I take that back.must remember to run as ADMIN. fantastic torrent thanks uploader :)
,Cormack,2011-03-09T00:48Z,works. thank you
,bob50ar,2011-03-27T14:50Z,"@sixstringslinger. I did everything that you have instructed, but I keep getting an error message while trying to install the patch. Why is this happening? Plz help!!"
,DullJack,2011-04-05T02:04Z,"SixStringSlinger's instructions are correct, except for 1 thing. You must run the patch as an administrator. If you are getting errors while patching and know you are patching to the correct directory, exit the patch and restart it as administrator. 

Also, if your authentication code comes back valid every time, you most likely patched the 9.0 version instead of the correct version. You need to re-patch. Make sure you have ""Sound Forge 10.0 Series"" selected and re-run the patch program to the install directory."
,pierat9,2011-10-05T23:04Z,"Works like a charm, cheers ears"
,AnamikaMogha,2011-10-20T15:10Z,Thanks for the software..
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-11-18T16:53Z,"thx mate but...
I wish it would work. It works only once and next time I open it I have to go through all the steps again to uninstal/re-install it... 
Maybe only with win 7 64 is the case (I always run everything as admin though).
I hope some day will be uploaded a version that works and less hassle pls with the installation ;-)
I'm glad for those who succeeded. "
