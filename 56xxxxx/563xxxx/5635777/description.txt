Larger-than-life German actress Marianne Sagebrecht stars as Rosalie Greenspace, a German bride raising a wonderful family in Stuttgart, Arkansas who she delights in providing gift after gift of goodies that are procured by her newly acquired talent of buying via "ze vonderful credit card." The more she spends, the more clever she becomes at spending; the only problem is that she has virtually no money - the credit cards are all linked to fake names, accounts, addresses, et cetera. This spoof is a playful comment on America's consumerist frenzy.
