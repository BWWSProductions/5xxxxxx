I got some of her photos from the Kindgirls site.
This site gives me a chance to look out for certain Met girls.
By the way,you seem to know a bit about Met-Art,can you give me some idea where this was taken?
The water is is black,with amber currents. Its stunning geography.
I have seen this same place,in other photography.
Just curious."
,gonusanti,2010-06-16T23:22Z,"Funny that you've mentioned that, because when I pasted together the bio I saw somebody mentioning that a different set of Berry was shot in Priozersk near Lake Ladoga ( http://www.thenude.eu/Berry_A_14746.htm ), so it could be around there.

Aleksa's set (see another torrent by me) was in the same stream and that was also by Paramov.

I hope that will help a bit LOL"
