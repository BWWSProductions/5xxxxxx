Wubi is an officially supported Ubuntu installer for Windows users. It can install and uninstall Ubuntu in the same way as any other Windows application. It's simple and safe.

Want to check out a Linux Ubuntu distribution without losing your windows system? Wubi allows you to install any flavour of Ubuntu you want and have a look before you comit to setting your system up as dual-boot or linux only.

Download Wubi and one of the many versions of Ubuntu (check out my other uploads for some versions for students/teachers, for home theatre systems or for muicians) then start Wubi and follow the prompts. It could not be easier!
