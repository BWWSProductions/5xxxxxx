james cotton - fire down under the hill 


Fire Down Under the Hill is the first release for the Telarc label by blues harmonica legend James Cotton. These ten acoustic tracks combine new tunes with the traditional Delta style passed down to Cotton directly from Little Walter and Sonny Boy Williamson. Backed by his regular road band, guitarist Rico McFarland, pianist David Maxwell, and vocalist Darrell Nulisch, Cotton's exquisitely gritty harp playing still sounds great. ---by Al Campbell
