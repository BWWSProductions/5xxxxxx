THE FEAR CHAMBER is a â€œdriven cop enters the mind of a serial killerâ€ saga, not unlike many of the derivative works inspired by the successes of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and RED DRAGON. Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles) is the detective on the edge, drawn back into a police investigation with great trepidation after being wounded by a diabolical murderer. What tips off the fact that this is an Asylum-style product is a scene directly lifted from SILENCE, where the villain pretends to be a victim (only instead of wearing a cast and trying to lift a heavy chair into a van, itâ€™s just a dude in a wheelchair asking for change, luring in his prey through the force of his personality). THE FEAR CHAMBER does make a few tepid attempts at being different from the Thomas Harris adaptations, such as making its protagonist a psychic instead of merely a perceptive investigator, and having the slayer steal body parts from his victims to sell on the black market instead of wearing them Ed Gein-style.
