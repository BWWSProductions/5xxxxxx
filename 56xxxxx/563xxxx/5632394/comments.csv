This is NOT the concept album Kalevala (A Finnish Progressive Rock Epic) from Musea Records. It is a single album of opera. I'm not going to rate it down, because I'm actually quite enjoying listening to it, but ULer PLEASE change the title so as not to deceive people."
,v1gor,2010-08-10T14:46Z,"Yes, exactly right gearofwar. My silly mistake; i'll correct as soon as i can (TPB seems to give ""error"" when attempting to edit existing torrents at moment). -This Matti Rag Paananen's operatic ""Kalevala"" is quite rare. I bought it straight from the artist after hearing about it on radio. Absolutely loved it, and immediately wanted to share it with all."
