,jumpingphil,2010-08-21T01:31Z,"Don't forget Joda before Farnorth.

I think school/college and familly took their tolls, which is fair enough.
Thanks to both Joda and Farnorth for doing these, and now thanks to emuparadise.

And yes, I also would like to know when the next release will be.

Many thanks for what you have done so far."
,redisnotdead,2010-08-24T11:05Z,"Awesome, man. I don't really have time to pick each and every single release by hand, and was desesperately looking for packs now that Farnorth is gone.

You frickin' kick ass!"
