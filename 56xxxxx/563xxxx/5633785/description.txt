Well, it's all the Nintendo DS ROMs from 4901 - 5000. Properly renamed as per Advanscene dats. This release has some pretty great titles:

Picross 3D - A pretty great 3D Puzzle title.
Megaman Zero Collection - Well, you know, Megaman ftw : )
Tetris Party Deluxe - Nothing like some classic russian tetris.
Japanese versions of Pokemon Pearl and Platinum
..& tons more stuff!
