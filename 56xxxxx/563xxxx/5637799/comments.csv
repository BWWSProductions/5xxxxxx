Not complaining, the picture quality is great. And I definitely appreciate people uploading these.
This just gives you a sense of what's being cropped out, and how warped this video is.

(PS - This is the same file as all of the other Toy Story 3 torrents so far, just named differently and slightly stretched vertically) "
