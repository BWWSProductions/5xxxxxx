[V],adultvideotorrents,2010-06-19T05:17Z,please take a screen shot of the problem so I can fix it. 
,N2U4EA,2010-06-20T02:41Z,I can not take a screenshot because when I press your link it looks like 100 or so links try to open and I have to ctrl-alt-link out of IE to stop whatever it is you are trying load. I use adblocker and will not load another browser to support your links.
[V],adultvideotorrents,2010-06-20T18:11Z,Well I can tell you the sites are 100% safe and we are the last to even attempt any bad malware but I will look at all our advertisers to ensure they are meeting the code.
