NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Killers V2

First off many thanks to ELEKTRI4KA for the video ;-)  The audio is off a special friend thanks m8
Right the video source was pretty nice only major issue was the colouring....well off but otherwise very nice cam.
The audio is some decent cam audio....got some depth to it,that is usually lacking on cam audio...the first 30 secs theres some
noise but that clears up.
Work done...well made a script containing a smoother,sharper,denoise,rgbeq balance and ran it over the video.....to us the videos
colours are still not  right by any means but are lot better than they were ;-)
Audio just needed to be synced up......8cuts or so and got it there.No other work as been done to the audio.

Enjoy.
