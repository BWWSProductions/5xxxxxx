,illiria,2010-06-16T03:13Z,With all due respect (and thanks for the upload) - why in the world 192 kbps?
,illiria,2010-06-16T03:13Z,"Oh, wait, even 128. Eep..."

I'll be buying the album later but it would've been nice to listen to in the car until I got it."

My bad, it's not released yet.

It must be just a rip from his Myspace page."
