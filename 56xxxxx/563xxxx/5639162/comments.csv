The time and effort you go to make these shows available are duly acknowledged I?m sure many coast to coast listeners who are unable to listen to the show on radio such as me as I live in England appreciate your time. I love the shows about ancient aliens do you happen to have Ancient Astronaut Theory 02-03-08 and Crop Circles & Anomalies 09-23-09?

,Lyrian,2010-06-21T04:29Z,"No need to tanx.
i have those shows and i will
upload them today."
,mkmacabre,2010-06-21T07:47Z,"Yeah,

I am also in England, and without these uploads, i would NEVER get to hear C2C! Can you imagine that? Never hearing C2C again? 

Doesn't bear thinking about, so thank you Lyrian ;)"
,mkmacabre,2010-06-21T07:50Z,"Furthermore,

You are proving to be the most consistent up loader of C2C since Zug went AWOL, (WTF happened to Zug?) but in addition, i REALLY like the fact that you add the basic show description to the title track, i mean, while i am archiving these shows ... that REALLY helps!!!!"
,Lyrian,2010-06-21T18:08Z,"Don't worry i will upload c2c forever
until government shut me down."
