,drewuivm,2010-07-19T01:00Z,"anyone had luck installing this? I've copied to an SD card in the ""garmin"" folder but the nuvi 255w does not see the map"
,mentally82,2010-07-21T20:02Z,"@ drewuivm ...did you follow this steps ?

1. Create a folder on the memory card called ?Garmin?

2. Copy the downloaded ?gmapprom.img? file into the Garmin folder on your SD card.

3. Rename the ?gmapprom.img? to ?gmapsupp.img? on the SD card.

4. Insert the SD card into your Garmin GPS, and browse to your map information on your Garmin GPS and you should see the new maps selected. This can be found on the device via : Tools>Settings>Map>Map Info. (Note: The SD card must remain in your device if you want to use the maps.)

P.S. If you did ...and is not working ,sry mate"
