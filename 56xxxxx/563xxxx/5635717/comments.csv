,equazcion,2011-03-30T05:43Z,"1. Extract the first RAR file. The others will extract automatically. 

2. Run the EXE in the root folder. It may ask you to reboot, do it.

3. Run the patch EXE in the patch folder. May ask you to reboot again, do it again.

4. Run rr.bat in the patch folder.

5. Run Ghost. When asked for a serial, enter one of the serials in ser.txt in the ser folder.

Then you're done.

Just thought I'd help out with some instructions. 

Worked nicely for me, thanks. Win7 x64."
