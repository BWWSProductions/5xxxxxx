Hi TPB, this is Glitch,

I am reposting this torrent after updating a few important
things, namely the installation guide and batch file.  All
else remains the same.

The comments from the previous posting is as follows:

""Good work, soldier!"" That's how they say that, isn't it? ;-)
I'm still interested in finding out HOW this magic is done exactly, partly because I use an x64-system from time to time. But nonetheless this is another big leap in the right direction (I can't stand JAWS as my primary screenreader, it talks too much; so I was never really desperate for these goods).

Thanks! Downloading now, please everyone seed!

Hi tpb,
good work! This crack really works fine. Is this crack also available for 64 bit? The previous crack for 11.0.756 was also available for 64 bit Jaws. I don't know how difficult it is to modify these two files under 64 bit Windows, but in fact, I think it is not so difficult because that crack doesn't use driver signature things.

I managed to ""tweak"" the DLL-file quite efficiently; not the main executable file, though. So if anybody is savvy enough to go and do this... ;-)

Hi TPB.
Glitch has a 64 bit crack for jaws 11.0.1447 and it works very well.
He sent me an email with the crack.
If you want it, please comment and I'm going to upload it for you.
Thank you very much and have a nice day.
Keep up the good work Glitch!

Adi.

,supanut,2010-06-23T14:03Z,"Lol thanks a lot!
Have not try it yet, but will try after I finish downloading a 13GB game. Lol, I have not turn off my computer for days now, because I fear that it will make download even slower, and I had even refuse to reboot after avg has updated.
Maybe I will try it sometimes next week, before reformat my computer."
,supanut,2010-06-27T14:39Z,"Me again;
I had tried it this morning, and it works great!
Hint you can do an update from build 756 to build 1447 and apply the crack, if you don't want to reinstall Jaws. That method works for me."
,trekball,2010-07-05T16:00Z,"Hi all,

anyone knows anything about the new JAWS 11.0.1461 built? Will there be a crack available for that as well?
I understand there habe been quite a few fixes in there.
Thanks and keep up the good work!!"
,supanut2000,2010-07-18T10:27Z,"Until now but still no crack for Jawds 11.0.1461?
Come on! I'm totally fet up!
When will it be out? Where can I get it?
I seriously need this, I don't have that kind of money to purchase the thing! it's over THB10,000!"
,hgerald618845,2010-08-04T18:47Z,"Ok this torrent works perfectly fine, easy todo easy to install, maybe a use of alittle prior knowledge to install, but maybe that doesnt count, awsome work Glitch, XD, so awsomeness dude, my machine i used it in was a Dell d800, pentium banias, windows XP, and we're good, like i said awsome job, as of 11:47 AM 8/4/2010 still seeding, \m/"
,lanceroxas08,2010-08-07T16:15Z,"hi tnx for de upload of jaws but can you also help to have a mobile screen reader software like the code factory mobile speak 4.5 because it has many features than the nuance talks 5.0 and it support more phones even blackberry, samsung, lg, motorola, htc and many more chek codefactory.es I hope many readers help with this"
,supanut2000,2010-08-10T09:16Z,"When will the new crack be release?
I think I had waited about 2 months now and there is still no updates.
Maybe is there's a Jaws crack that works on more than 1 versions of Jaws? Like a dongle emulator that trick the licencing service that the Jaws copy is authorized? I found one long ago, but that worked only up to Jaws 10."
,ZYKA,2010-08-21T12:44Z,"Maybe somebody have Mobilespeak 4.5, or Nuance Talks 5.01 crack? Send for me to z.kazlauskas@gmail.com please."
