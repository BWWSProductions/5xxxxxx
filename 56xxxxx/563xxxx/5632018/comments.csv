[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-19T19:59Z,"episode 20 is Something Something Darkside
and partial terms of endearment has not aired yet"

[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-19T21:05Z,"yea that is my fault, i was thinking of the cleveland show (21 eps in season 1) but partial terms of endearment is supposed to air tommorow, when it gets on the net, i WILL upload for you guys"

,oversoul53,2010-06-20T02:28Z,"is someone ever gunna upload the volume 8 DVD? It has episodes FOX-y Lady - Dog Gone and I still don't see it. I figured MacTV woulda uploaded the season 7 dvdrip by now, since volume 8 has thr remaining season 7 eps he needed. and the American Dad season 4 as well "
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-20T06:19Z,"i can upload american dad season 4, are you sure u cant find it?"
,oversoul53,2010-06-20T07:48Z,"yes positive, can u upload it all as a dvdrip? and if u can upload the first half of season 5 (second half of volume 5) that'd be great too. Cuz I know each DVD set has the first half of one season, and the 2nd half of another"
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-20T08:54Z,"ive only been keeping the 720p rips. but im upping for you now,and season 5 is already in my list of torrents just click my name"
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-20T08:59Z,"Here is American Dad Season 4 720p For you

,oversoul53,2010-06-24T08:47Z,"I have another question, are the first 8 episodes here DVD rips?"
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-25T22:23Z,no they are 720p hdtv rips
,oversoul53,2010-06-26T03:17Z,"*sigh* I'm still waiting for someone to upload Volume 8... it has the second half of season 7 and the first half of season 8, episodes FOX-y Lady - Dog Gone, and I want these because the DVDs ALWAYS have extra scenes and uncut audio. And I'm not looking for an ISO rip, no I hate that, I'm looking for DVDRip, .avi files. but it seems no one on this site has yet to buy the DVD. that one guy uploaded a special feature from disc 3 but nothing else, bastard.... -_-

so if no one uploads it by next month I'll just go buy it and do it myself. "
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-26T03:51Z,i found the dvd rips for seasons 1-7 and i am downloading for you now. ill up when they are done
,oversoul53,2010-06-26T05:32Z,"I already have seasons 1- 5 and the first half of season 7, I just need the 2nd half of season 7 and the first have of season 8.

so far this is the only season 7 with DVDrips I could find

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5018581/Family_Guy_Season_7_DVDrip_AND_TVrip

remember seasons are different from volumes. lol. each volume since 5 has had the second half of one season and the first half of another.


Vol 6 Was 5 and 6 
Vol 7 Was 6 and 7
Vol 8 was 7 and 8

so I'm looking for Volume 8, I already have the first half of season 7, I need the second half (from Vol 8 DVD) and the first half of season 8 (from the same DVD)"
,oversoul53,2010-06-26T05:37Z,"btw, if any of the season 7 DVDrips came out before 2010 then it's fake. cuz in order for somone to make a DVDrip of the ENTIRE season 7, the would need volumes 7 AND 8, and vol 8 didn't come out til 10 days ago, sooo... yeah..."
,oversoul53,2010-06-26T05:41Z,"btw, DVDrips have uncensored audio, and extra scenes

TVrips have age icons on the top left, and sometimes pop-ups on the bottom, and the credits are usually cut out. that's how u can tell the difference. so far all the season 7 dvdrips I have found have mixed season 7 for volume 7"
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-26T22:44Z,im pretty sure the stuff im getting now is all dvd rip up to half of season 7 will post when done downloading all episodes
,oversoul53,2010-06-27T00:47Z,"u said HALF of season 7 right? I already have it then. I'm looking for what was on the vol 8 dvd, second half of season 7 ,and first half of season 8.

but thanks anyways, I appreciate the effort. :)"
,Christian420,2010-06-29T03:36Z,are these ripped from TV?
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-06-29T18:40Z,yes HDTV rips
,jannici,2010-07-13T17:09Z,"I can\'t get these to play at all.  What player are you guys using? I tried media player with every codec I could find, and I tried using Dvix and the Dvix player.  Nothing seems to work."
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-08-03T19:48Z,"Use VLC Media Player if you cant play it, it plays anything, also you probly dont have all the codecs, google all in 1 codec and download and install it"
,jannici,2010-08-19T07:30Z,"I tried the all in 1 codec, but I didnt have any luck with it.  I download VLC media player and it worked like a charm.  Well, the bright side of this is, I have been looking for an excuse to throw Windows media player out the window for a long time.  Ill never use Windows media player again."
[T],JUGGALOTUS420,2010-08-21T04:22Z,"Yea windows media player is picky about what files it plays, especially the HD Files. VLC is DEF one of the best media players you can get."
,Zoaroark,2010-08-27T04:15Z,"question,  do you know how to get futurama season 6 in 720 p? thx"

,JackTheForest,2011-01-05T09:32Z,"Perfect, even for PS3!"
,BC,2011-02-08T21:07Z,not a real 720p

,ScootyMcCooty,2011-03-02T19:16Z,"Love all ur torrents.
thanks so much
very good quality
great for the ps3
will seed as much as poss
:-D"
,finisher489,2011-08-06T18:02Z,Nice!! This is a TVRip
,finisher489,2011-08-07T19:16Z,"Thanks dude. I'm guessing this is a TVRip since DVDRip's are never 720p. I think the only popular HD channel that gets Family Guy in the USA in 720p is it's original channel, FOX. I'm also downloading Laugh it up Fuzzball the Trilogy (Family Guy Star Wars) Blu-RayRip 1080p. I think it's the only Blu-Ray episodes of Family Guy"
,finisher489,2011-08-18T03:41Z,I just realised that this is properly the only HD torrent around for Family Guy Season 8
