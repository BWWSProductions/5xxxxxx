,CraZyXHeaDX,2010-06-22T22:01Z,worked fine for me. wizzle dizzle did find an update in the iso still but patched it no probs. As for burn fails try slower burn rate. anyone alse using neogamma r7> regionsettings> Force video=Wii> Patch Video=All>Back to menu and run game from disk. Thanks for the upload and speed. Great torrent!
