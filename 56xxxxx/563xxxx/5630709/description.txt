A video tour of the G20 Fence line in Toronto taken on 15-Jun-10. Includes footage of the financial district.

This earned me a talking to from the cops, apparently I was setting off alarm bells (figuratively) over the security area as I did this.

The cops were polite enough, but fuck 'em anyways considering the masters they serve. You lie down with dogs, you get fleas.

Come out and protest on 26-27-Jun and make your voice heard.
