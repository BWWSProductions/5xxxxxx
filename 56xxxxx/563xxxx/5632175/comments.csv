,lilars26,2010-06-17T01:34Z,Thank you 20-40.
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-17T06:34Z,"@lilars: Thank you.

@Gublet: I would watch ALL games on TV, I always do (11 WCs so far). If I see some game with anthological value (what I doubt judging from the direction taken on last one in Germany) I would encode such game, definitely. So far, nothing good and obnoxious frikkin Vuvuzela Horns."
,sanyam123,2010-06-17T07:29Z,"thanks 2040...
so which team you are supporting this time?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-06-17T07:42Z,"I always have been sympathetic for US team. I spotted their certain uniqueness when they beat Portugal while ago. If they play, football looks as it supposed to.
And I like Brazil too, of course.
But so far, only Asian teams have shown the heart..."
