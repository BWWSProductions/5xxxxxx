Welcome to one of the most remarcable names in F1 realistic simulators...!


                          ----------------------------------
                         |THE F1 CHALLENGE 2010 MOD(English)|
                          ----------------------------------
 


I've downloaded the F1 Delux 2010 from a torrent, then i've erased the two "*.dic"(dictionary files) that were found in the OPTIONS folder, inside the game's main folder..., so this way i've made the menu and all the rest turn to English...!

I've also had a copy of F1 DELUX 2008, so for making the audio turn to English as well, i've only overwiritten(not erased) the folders named "Pit" and "Commentary" within the "Audio" folder from F1 DELUX 2010's main folder, with the same folders from F1 DELUX 2008's "Audio" folder, thus using the English speaking crew and such from the 2008 MOD to the 2010 one...!

I've also put the 2008's intro as it is the best F1 challenge intro so far from any mod..., hope you enjoy it!

You only need to extract the archive somewhere on your hard drive, make a shortcut, and you're ready to roll...!:D


KEEP ON SEEDING IT FOR A WHILE AFTER YOU'VE DOWNLOADED IT...! IF YOU HAVE IT..., SHARE IT AS I DID! CHEERS!


Good luck and have a nice ride!;)
