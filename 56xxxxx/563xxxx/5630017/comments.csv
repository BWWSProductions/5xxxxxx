,dm011,2010-09-14T15:53Z," Using the Windows Program Compatibility mode
When you use Windows Program Compatibility mode, many of the most common issues that prohibit earlier versions of programs from working correctly are resolved. If you run a program and it does not function as expected, it is recommended that you run the program in one of the compatibility environments. To run programs in Windows Program Compatibility mode in Microsoft Windows XP, follow these steps:

   1. Right click on the link of the program that you want to fix.
   2. Click on Properties.
   3. Click on the Compatibility tab.
   4. Click on Run this program in compatibility mode and select one of these:
          * Windows 95
          * Windows 98
          * Windows NT 4
          * Windows 2000
   5. Under Display settings, click to select the mode that you think that is necessary for the program to work correctly:
          * Run in 256 colors.
          * Run in 640 X 480 screen resolution.
          * Disable visual themes.
   6. Click Apply, and then click OK.
   7. Double click on the program.

Notes

    * The Compatibility tab is only available for programs that are installed on your hard drive. Although you can run the Program Compatibility Wizard on programs or setup files on a CD-ROM or floppy disk, your changes will not remain in effect after you close the program. For more information about an option on the Compatibility tab, right-click the option and then click What's This.
    * If you click to clear all the options in the Compatibility tab, you will restore the default settings."
