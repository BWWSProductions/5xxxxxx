Band mates JIM ASHWORTH and BRYAN FREEZE formed Dr. Wuâ€™ in 2002 after growing up and playing in various bands starting in the late 60â€™s. The name was taken from a favorite Steely Dan song that encourages us to live life to the fullest and strive to be the very best that we can be. With this as their goal, they set out to record their â€œTexas Bluesâ€ Project Volume I â€œFort Worth Artistsâ€â€¦ a long overdue recorded history utilizing guest appearances by musicians who have made Fort Worth a global mecca of top playersâ€¦ especially great â€œguitar slingersâ€.
