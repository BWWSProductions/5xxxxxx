I downloaded the torrent, mounted the image and and that stuff, and got it installed. I then copied the cracks to their respective places, and the game works fine. But when i go to start a new game or before i enter a battle, the game just stops and goes back to the desktop. I was wondering if you could suggest a way to fix this problem please"

What are you even talking about noob? All the readme's in my torrent are in English.

Go post your spam someplace else."
,MationMac,2011-03-14T19:48Z,"@h4xu-54-2
It's not spam.
It is the readme file from the russian download with alot of seeders."
,h4xu-54-2,2011-03-20T20:45Z,"@MationMac

It is spam because he was referring that i had that Russian Readme in my torrent. If he wants help go post on that torrrent not mine. It has nothing to do with my torrent at all. That is why I called it spam Sir. He also posted 4 times in a row thats called spam too. *points to urban-dictionary*"
,winterstellar,2011-05-04T05:21Z,"i have the same issue with game crashing. i went to instant action, selected mos eisley conquest, add map, launch.. and it disappears off of my screen and i am on my desktop again.. 

i followed the link for realtek updated driver, downloaded it and ran the .exe. it uninstalled my current driver and rebooted my computer and installed the new driver successfully.. 

now the game is still crashing and, also, my headphones no longer have sound. "
,winterstellar,2011-05-04T08:52Z,"ok to update.. i saw someone mention device manager.. typed it into start menu and updated my drivers from there this time and got my headphone sound back.. that ill be the last time i get a driver update from a site link instead of updating str8 from my pc with device manager.. 

so then i uninstalled the game and reinstalled.. drivers all up to date and game is still disappearing when i try to start mos eisley... and every other map i tried.. i tried it on 1.0 and 1.1 same result.. 

im on vista my drivers are up to date and i have been trying to use ""instant action"" mode.. giving up at this point
"
,winterstellar,2011-05-04T09:05Z,oh but i can play if i choose disable at options > sound > mixer config... but i don't really like playing swb2 without sound
,h4xu-54-2,2011-05-05T09:16Z,"@winterstellar

I have the latest Realtek Drivers and it does not crash for me at all.

And from what it sounds you uninstalled the new drivers and installed the old ones again From Device Manager *if i understood you correctly*

There should be no reason why you can't go to the manufacturers main website and download the latest driver. That is perfectly safe. I would understand if it was not from the main site but you downloaded it from the main site. *if you followed the link from the first post*

Device manager does not always give you the very latest Driver.

Also with your sound not working did you even think to try and change the settings? They could have been wrong."
,nikolikos,2011-05-10T11:14Z,what extra does it has ?
,Jogarayzz,2011-05-12T03:41Z,Anyone wanna play online? get hamachi and let me know we will play. email jogamaster07@gmail.com and put lets play online in subject
,h4xu-54-2,2011-05-12T08:03Z,"@nikolikos
Maybe Read the Description?"
,nikolikos,2011-05-21T22:30Z,"So the only extra is some change to graphics and magicdisk ? It 's a pity ! I was waiting new levels , characters and just new things !"
,h4xu-54-2,2011-05-23T10:40Z,"@nikolikos

I included pretty much everything you would need to play this on MP and use patch 1.1

If you wanted magic hacks with new levels. Why not ask Lucas-arts to make you a whole new game? Star Wars Battlefront 3 maybe? *sarcasm*

There are plenty of mods for this game on mods sites if you want new maps/skins etc."
