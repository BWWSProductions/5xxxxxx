,DSIN,2010-06-19T17:28Z,@siddhart... Brrips of hollywood movies in hindi..thats rediculous...i mean hollywood movies r best enjoyed in english...if u watch it dubbed u r missing an awful lot...
,h_khan_online,2010-06-19T19:28Z,DSIN is 100% right.
,DSIN,2010-06-24T12:06Z,"@siddhart i watched fight club first in hindi....& i liked the movie....next time i watched it after couple of years in english the movie became my all time fav...i mean edward norton is known for his amazing acting & dialogues...& dubbing suxx.
i bet u won't understand pulp fiction in hindi or u'll hate it...the original dialogues r wat makes that movie 1 of the gr8est...so i prefer movie as it is made , hindi dubbing just makes it worse.."

I am thinking about RIDDLER FAN CLUB!!!!
what do you think? LOL...."
,mikecj,2011-01-26T14:11Z,"beware! i don't know what you lot are watching this guys uploads on?! I am watching off of a LaCinema Classic HD, through HDMI to a 37"" Sony TV. With these i am getting poor quality! Pixelated blacks and over-sharpened edges. I will stick to the 1GB+ file sizes, until someone can actually deliver on this kind of promise! Nice try, thanks for sharing, it's close but it's not quite there yet. If only you didn't over-sharpen and lower the export size so much!
let the onslaught commence!"
,thefast5,2011-08-06T09:29Z,"hey..wat do mean by subs -""HardSubbed"" ??"
