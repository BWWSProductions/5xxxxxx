,mister15,2010-09-15T17:30Z,"WTF? ""Remarkable"" and ""Supremely sophisticated"" history of islam in Spain? Hahahahaha. I need a glass of water....now, tell me, where did this ""sophisticated"" culture go after Spain kicked it out? Is there any remnants of it in the islamic world, because if the muslims had it in Spain, it had to be all over the muslim world..but wait...there is no such world in muslim countries....and the ONLY REASON it was there in Spain, is because it WAS ALREADY THERE when the muslims came!! Makes sense doesn't it? That the muslims then paid some artists and builders to build them some temples, mosques and fortresses that had a ""islamic ""style, doesn't mean they invented, created or developed anything themselves! And so when they left....life went back to normal for the Spanish people...but the ""remarkable"" islamic culture just died out....hm.....now why is that. The muslims DID NOT invent math, algebra or anything, they got this from India and the persians, who were NOT MUSLIMS. They got hold of some books, translated them and brought them with them...it's not the same thing as inventing them. Just google algebra and persia/india vs islamic history and it's all there. "

The science, culture, philosophy didn't disappear. We're using them still. After the fall of Al-Andalus (muslim Spain) hordes of scholars came from christian Europe to translate the books that weren't burned by reconquista priests. 
Many books were kept as scientific standard for the next 200-300 years after he fall of Al-Andalus.
Also, the reason you don't know any historical names of science that were arabic is because all names were latinized.

As for your claim that the knowledge was already there...I don't even know should I bother to respond to it. Learn a bit about history. I'm having a strange feeling you didn't even watched the documentary.

As for the reason why this brilliant civilization declined and ultimately disappear can be answered by one of their own scholars Ibn Khaldun whose books were kept as foundations of sociology for couple of centuries in Europe.

The reason your ignorant mind didn't heard about Moors doesn't mean they didn't do anything important, you intellectually very poor person!"
