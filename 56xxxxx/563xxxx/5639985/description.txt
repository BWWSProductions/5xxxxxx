Skies of Arcadia Complete set up for the PC. Includes both cd1 and 2 of skies, direct GDI rips and the nulldc Emulator, and instructions on how to set up the emulator to run the game. I uploaded to zip instead of .7z as the first two torrents did not correctly identify the data, that is in making the torrent file and trying to seed it did not see the files correctly. so hopefully this takes care of that.


This is everything in one package for the pc. There is the same errors as everywhere of nulldc which include

some problems with audio and video speed in the cutscenes.
the green select on the magic and special moves not being transparent, there is a workaround for this in the .txt

You can play this full screen.

By all means scan away on this but i found nothing virus or maleware wise.
