"Jump (for My Love)" was the opening track (and third single) of the Pointer Sisters' 1983 album, Break Out.

Released prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics games, the song's video featured footage of athletes competing in track and field events. The song was the second of four Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles in a row for the sisters in 1984; it peaked at #3 in July. It also appeared on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart and reached the Top 10 in the UK, peaking at number six.

The original title given to the song simply was "Jump." The title was modified to "Jump (for My Love)" prior to its release to avoid confusion with the Van Halen song Jump, which was released earlier the same year.

The song netted the group a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1985.

The song was featured in a gay-themed movie in 2002, "The Trip," an epic gay romance that traces the relationship between two men from their initial meeting in 1973 until 1984. In 2003, this recording was used in the movie Love Actually.

Break Out is a landmark album by the Pointer Sisters released on November 6, 1983 by Planet Records. Featuring mostly electro-dance tunes, the album gave the Oakland, California-based trio the biggest success of their recording career. The album spawned four top ten hits - "Jump (For My Love)", "Automatic" and "Neutron Dance". Later editions of the album included their 1982 hit "I'm So Excited" from the previous album of the same name. Break Out sold well over three million copies, made the group darlings of MTV, and won the group two Grammy awards and two American Music Awards.

The Pointer Sisters are an American  pop/R&B recording act from Oakland, California  that achieved mainstream success during the 1970s and 1980s. Spanning over three decades, their repertoire has included such diverse genres as pop, disco, jazz, bebop, blues, soul, funk, dance, country and rock.

The group had its early origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in 1969 (without a record deal) as "Pointers, a Pair". The line-up grew to a quartet when Anita Pointer joined, followed by Ruth, who joined in December, 1972, right before they recorded their debut album. They achieved their greatest commercial success later as a trio consisting of Anita, June, and Ruth, after Bonnie left the group to commence a solo career in 1978.
