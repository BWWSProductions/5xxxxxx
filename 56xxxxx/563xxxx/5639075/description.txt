The Joneses - Criminal History Revisited (LA sleaze rock)

2009 Full Breach Remastered CD

Collection of The Joneses best songs, including rare and previously unreleased tracks. 

One of rock's best-kept secrets, The Joneses were too glam for punk, and too punk for rock. They ruled the 80s LA trash scene with their bluesy, dark, voodoo sound that makes them tougher, rougher, and, well, sleazier than the rest. In a league of their own.
