Opening Night At Rodneys Place (1989) brings back Sam Kinison, then adds Rich Little, Heather Thomas, Chuck McCann, Ron Jeremy, Tim Allen, Jeff Foxworthy and more good-if-not-well-known comics for another Dangerfield nightclub. This is the longest show here at 90 minutes and Greg Travis is the funniest new guy here. There is also an odd send-up of The Tonight Show with McCann as Ed McMahon and Little as Johnny Carson, and several segments of an equally odd spoof of Sherlock Holmes.
