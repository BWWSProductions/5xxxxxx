Old Man River - You're On My Mind (EP)(2010)





Old Man River is the stage name of Australian singer-songwriter Ohad Rein, and the name of his band. In 2009, "Sunshine", co-written by Old Man River, won the 'Blues & Roots Work of the Year' category at the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Awards.





Ohad Rein was born in Sydney, Australia. He moved to Europe with his family at a very early age before moving to Israel in his formative years. Spending many years abroad he finally returned to Sydney. He collaborated with Sydney band Gelbison, touring with the band and co-writing some of the tracks which appear on his debut album Good Morning. This led to the side project Nations by the river, which combined Gelbison with Luke Steele from Sleepy Jackson.


The single "Sunshine" (could have been a Beatles song) became the station's most played song in the summer of '06 and was used as a theme for Channel 7's Sunrise. The single "La" reached #83 on the German singles chart, topped the Japanese Radio Airplay chart and was #6 on Italy's airplay chart. "La", "Trousers" and "Sunshine" all received significant airplay on Triple J.

The single "La" was featured in the 'New York Lotto Powerball - Mega Millions' commercial.
