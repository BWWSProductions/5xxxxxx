Release Information:
DogFighter is a fast paced, arcade aerial combat game with arena style
gameplay values. Players can compete against up to 7 opponents in 3
multiplayer modes, or go solo in 6 single player game modes, using beefed
up biplanes sporting over 20 different offensive and defensive weapons.
Using a state-of-the-art flight model and controls, ensure that players
will have unprecedented command of DogFighters craft. Complete control
of the craft, combined with easily executed advanced manoeuvres such as
the Barrel Roll, give DogFighter players the tools they need to master
the skies.
With environments built to both slay and save you, the environments in
DogFighter offer the player a more interactive experience than is usual
for the genre. Players can enjoy piloting their craft down mining
tunnels, through pyramids and active volcanoes, in environments designed
to deliver a more varied, more interactive gaming experience. Fly low,
fly fast!
Take to the skies against up to 7 players in classic multiplayer game
modes such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the flag.
Use several advanced server options to enable variations on the normal
game modes by including the likes of Insta-Gib, Turbo Mode and Black
Death.
Easy-to-fly flight model with the controls you need to execute advanced
manoeuvres such as Barrel Roll and Immelmann Turn.
Beautifully created environments that are as much a player in the game
as the people piloting the craft.
With seven unique craft and over 20 different weapons and defensive
measures, DogFighter caters to all game play styles.
