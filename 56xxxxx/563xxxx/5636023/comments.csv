,asscore,2010-06-20T04:28Z,"And you are on TPB why?

Everything gets pirated.  No-one is special or will receive special treatment.  If I couldn't download the game for free, believe me I wouldn't be buying it."
,Ic4ruz,2010-06-21T02:38Z,"Whoa....you uploaded a indie game made by a startup company wich problary has no money.

Congratulations asshole.

mehlolkek: I agree.

asscore: If you aren't going to pay for (it's friggin 12$ on Steam) then you should just leave it alone."

,sar59,2010-11-24T01:38Z,"Hi Uploading any torrent is OK... If u like the stuff support the creators, developers by purchasing the stuff... Why so much fuss. torrents all about sharing and full access to test the product, instead of burning money over junk.. :)"
,stealth_invader,2011-03-10T10:04Z,"hey,, i have been downloaded this torrent, but there is no extension.. how can i open this file ??"
