,DragonRider65,2011-07-02T08:28Z,"Thank you very much for the upload, man, I really do appreciate this. I had a ton of Lynda.com tutorials and then my freakin' Western Digital External Hard Drive crashed on me and I lost EVERYTHING! This is the second one too; first Western Digital 1.5 TB Hard Drive=Dead in less than seven months; SECOND 2TB External Hard DRive=dead in less than four weeks. Moral of the story; Western Digital needs to go back to the f*cking drawing board!!!"
