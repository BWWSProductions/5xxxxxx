,kimiani,2010-06-16T05:41Z,thanks for this grt film...........does this hav extras?
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-16T05:54Z,@kimiani - Yes it does it says in my torrent description. All of my torrents come with extras.
,punisher_latin,2010-06-16T07:17Z,thanks amigo!!!!!
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-16T08:36Z,Can someone pls upload a DVD9 copy of this movie perhaps djfred or ctang . 
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-16T08:39Z,"But hi thanks mikemelo , u the man "
[T],ctang,2010-06-16T14:17Z,"since MM uploaded this, i have no reason to go out and rent this just to put it up in dvd9...if i already had it i might but chances are since now i already have it, im not going to rent it"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-06-16T15:52Z,@Metal1Dead - Why do you want a DVD9 copy.... The DVD9 copy is 4.9GB. All I did was remove trailers and reduce the bit rate of the extras and compressed the video by was 12% and you want a DVD9 copy???? Explain to me the logic in that and I will personally put up a DVD9 copy.
,hyster13,2010-06-17T02:18Z,"LOL!!!!! 

Yeah, get 'em Mike!!!!!!!

LMAO!!!"
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-17T04:25Z,"""compressed the video by was 12%"" , thats why i want a dvd9 copy . When i see a dvd5 copy of a movie on pc and i am like 15 inches away from the screen ,i see that the movie quality at some parts are really low . Also when the movie is touched , very rarely errors occur in the ripping process , like a slight skip in the movie or something like that . 
I know most people favour dvd5 copies on dvd9 copies . But there is a way to make the both parties satisfied , thats by uploading a dvd9 copy .The dvd5 fans can use clonedvd to covert dvd 9-5 . 
Look dude it would really be amazing if the movie is not touched , that would be great , thats all wat i am looking for . I don't really care if it is dvd5 or dvd9 , just the movie and menu is left untouched . For example ""cloudy with a chance of meatballs by djfred"" the movie is untouched and quality is really stunning. i hope u now know why a dvd9 copy is highly appreciated .

Thanks for ur works 
PEACE"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-06-17T05:32Z,"hmmm, i always convert my dvd9s to dvd5s with nero7 (old as fuck but i swear by it) and i never lose any quality...  weird.  i am a picky person when it comes to quality too.  i guess im just a dumb ass.  i should go to hell.  

and i dont watch movies on a 17"" computer monitor, i use my backlit, dnie, hdtv, with rear projectors and all sorts of really expensive shit in it.  my tv cost me $4,000.  im 24 years old and LOADED... fuck me!"
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-17T06:21Z,"lol , zombifuzz and why the hell in evry dvd5 copy the movie is compressed to dvd5 or tounched  .
And u said ""i never lose any quality... weird"" , hell ya thats wired , u know if a dvd5 copy was viewed on a 42"" lcd , u will fcking notice the a disaster . 
ITS LIKE PLAYING XBOX360 on a 30"" and above LCDs , boxs man boxs [pixeled quality].THats why ps3 rocks, blue ray man .

But we are not talking about gaming here but about movies , by the way ,i watch djfred,ctang,hjsn1 and MM movies on a 14"" inch monitor and still see some low quality on dvd5s but not on DVD9."
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-17T06:26Z,"I hope now MM it make sense and anyone [the top dvdr rippers ] could u pls pls upload a dvd9 version of tis movie as well as the tooth fairy and thanks alot , ur work is appreciated evn if its a 5 or 9 copy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
[T],ctang,2010-06-17T16:55Z,"@metal1dead: you sure do complain a lot about getting something for free...why dont you just go rent it, its only $4 max and it will save you from complaining so much...just saying because no matter what, it sounds like you wont be satisfied"
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-17T19:11Z,"Man , i am not complaining , u now if there was only a fcking movie store in my area i would purchase my movies from there . 
And u r saying rent !!

,Metal1Dead,2010-06-17T19:18Z,"Also u guys say that u r taking requests !!!!!!!!!!

*Shutter Island - dvd9 

My requests not complains man "
,punisher_latin,2010-06-17T22:54Z,thank u for this movie very very good!!!!!!!!!!
[T],ctang,2010-06-18T02:16Z,"@metal1dead: we do take requests but when you request something that is already up, such as this torrent, and you complain about slight compression then we arent going to put it up...i could see if you were talking about 8Gb that was compressed down to 4.37Gb but when you're talking 4.9 to 4.32 then then no way...i stand behind MM on this one"
,hyster13,2010-06-18T03:51Z,"LOL!!

Get 'em Ctang!!!

LMAO!!!"
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-18T05:04Z,"u know wat i think we started at the wrong foot here , lets start fresh . I didn't know the actual size was 4.9 gb don't blame me man !!!!!!
Anyhow thanks "
[T],ctang,2010-06-18T14:10Z,well ok...if you want to be the better man then we can start fresh...fine with me...i will forget all about the comments on here

,Metal1Dead,2010-06-19T07:35Z,"oright dude checking it out , but offcourse after download completed !!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks by way "
,Metal1Dead,2010-06-19T07:35Z,"meant ""by the way"""
,OctopusCrime,2010-06-21T07:01Z,"Might I suggest using DVDShrink to re-author the dvd and keep just the title, ditch the menus.  Keep the 5.1 and subs and keep a better compression ratio?  Quality over quantity!  I'd rather have a better quality movie and no menu as I'm sure most would.  Granted, if you can keep all and still come in at 100% compression ratio then do it, otherwise, the movie should take priority.

BTW, thanks for the upload.
