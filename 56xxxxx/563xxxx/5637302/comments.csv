All of them have nice sizes already and ready to be used in a nice way in the emulator , so just download the latest emulator version for example and then enjoy this 5 games for less than 2 giga space in the hard disk computer .

NIce idea this file and certainly doesnÂ´t maded sense to upload one by one all of them in short size files ...

Happy gaming !!!"

[V],globeplus,2010-06-19T16:36Z,"They run nice generally speaking , one or another game can need an adjust on the emulator because the framerate but all of them are perfectly emulated and what a nice size for this pack of games and i repeat with me is not possible that game , probably are lot of files out there for that .

Happy gamng this file users and for less than 2 giga , 5 nice games instantly in this nice emulator ready to go just the keys to be configurated ."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-19T19:23Z,"ThatÂ´s ok marky2033 but some games can real have a low framerate at some moments but it is also true that the configurations and a nice computer can help .

Happy gaming !!! "
,anand86,2010-06-19T20:01Z,"Hey Globe,
I tried to play No More Heroes on Dolphin. But got great amount of lagging and couldn't play. I am thinking if dolphin can play Forgotten Sands nicely then why not No More heroes. It is 2-3 years old game. Is there any site where I can see list of compatible games for Dolphin, just like Pcsx2 have it on net. I wonder could I play Dead Space Extraction and Red Steel 2 on Dolphin? or just the platform games like Mario."
[V],globeplus,2010-06-19T21:10Z,"To anand86 :  forgotten sands works great with the included patch that i have in the file , without that you can reach the menus .

I have here a informal nice list of compatibility but some games that are not playable can work with nice patches but not all of them and this patches are tough to make or work and of course some games can work better with some emulator versions than others :
