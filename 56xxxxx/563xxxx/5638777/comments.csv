,DigDug555,2010-06-25T23:26Z,"Your work and effort on this torrent is definitely appreciated but, that being said, there are a few questions: 

Since you obviously put a lot of work into recording and seeding this, did you include source and recording info (gear used, location, lineage, etc.) for the concert?  And most glaringly, why not convert the WAV files to lossless FLAC?  They are much smaller files, less prone to corruption and have built-in fingerprints to check if the file does become corrupt.

Thanks again for your work, taper.  Btw, there's another source for this show here > http://www.nyctaper.com/?p=3369"
