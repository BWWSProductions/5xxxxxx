- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   The first studio album in six years from the legend, Glenn Danzig. It is an
   awesome album. Get high and sacrifice a goat. The inside of the digipack is 
   hilarious, so look at my pics.

   "Glenn Danzig is a name that permeates, infects, and ultimately makes strong,
   the very soul of hard rock. Through the legendary charge of his pre-Danzig
   days with the Misfits and Samhain, the man whose name helped form the very
   backbone of today's punk, rock and metal movements. The singer s music has
   consistently mutated high-tension hybrids into a focused whole; and it
   continues to evolve. The entirety of this work is continually studied and
   applied in today s metal and rock communities but as the saying goes: often
   imitated, never duplicated. Danzig s sphere of influence is something to
   marvel.

   With over ten million albums sold, multiple world tours and influence beyond
   the realm of mortals comes Deth Red Sabaoth, Danzig s first album of new
   material in six years! With his Jim Morrison-goes-punk croon, signature
   visuals and raucous live shows the new album is a logical step forward in
   Danzig s musical growth. Laced with Glenn s lycanthropic growls and
   blues-inflected wailing, the music itself emits a spectral glow to rival the
   highest points in the man s extensive discography."
