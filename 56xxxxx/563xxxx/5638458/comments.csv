,Watatsumi,2010-06-20T00:02Z,"there are some image quality issues for a few seconds in the middle of the action.

Looks like the digital receiver had some heavy signal noise interference that it could not compensate for even though the error correction was supposed to help

Even so, it has good overall quality."

,SD_rocks,2010-06-21T01:00Z,Watatsumi is right. Because of those noise interferences the subs thai I am trying to use now get out of sync after the disturbance.
,SD_rocks,2010-06-21T08:28Z,"if the disurbance is troubling you too then get this one.
