We shall go back to the dark thick forest together with Shiva3.

With the first notes of our magic rituals of sound, the wood spirits reveal to us starry skies from luring faraway space and the sound of the shaman's tambourine.Thus starts our sacred ritual of the atmos. Our reunification with the wood and wild nature that is the source of wisdom and understanding of the universe. We shall assemble all the magic creatures near our large bonfire ofunity and perform the Dance of the Universe and sing a song of MotherEarth's. We shall regain the nature of our true sources of existence.
