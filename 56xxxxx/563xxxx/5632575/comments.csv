,oracle12,2010-06-18T02:07Z,"I'm still creating them, currently up to and seeding 4/5"
,oracle12,2010-06-18T18:48Z,"apolagies for the slow start, but the oldest one has only been seeding for a few days, and thus will take a while to get going, as I am the only one seeding the full file. It will pick up as more of the leechers have more to seed so bear with it, I plan to seed these files indefinately. 
I've just finished and uploaded 4/5, so only part 5 to create. probably have it done for the weekend "
