,mondeo98,2010-06-18T17:24Z,"Why does it insist on starting in French ?

I can't change the language to English... Why is that ???"
,ervidel,2010-06-18T20:07Z,because it's fucking French version. who the fuck doesn't distinguish English from French?
,mondeo98,2010-06-18T22:19Z,"It says: Lenguajes - EN

Stupid us for thinking that it actually would be in english...

DOH !"
,ervidel,2010-06-19T12:04Z,"that's not what I meant Doh!

It wasn't an attack on us! On the stupido who seeded initially stating it was in English! He/she obviously does understand the difference. Missed school I guess?!"
,ervidel,2010-06-19T12:06Z,has anyone else found an English version? I don't want to start downloading all different versions like a stupido and have all sorts of different lingos but English.
