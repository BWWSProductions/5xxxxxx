[V],jainmehul,2010-06-22T05:29Z,"Hey b.... just wanted to ask you something.....VBR Are the best??.....i mean you wil laugh at me if i ask u now bcoz u have explained me that...,bt many people comment like it should have been 320 CBR...... bt i think many people hide the low quality of their rips by converting it to 320 CBR and one of them is NOFS...well he is  a ver good uplolader bt only some of his rips are low on quality!!!"
[V],bubanee,2010-06-22T06:44Z,"J.. can't comment on Nofs i only ever grabbed one thing off him... thats the problem with public sites 
""do you know what your really getting"" as for the argument of Nofs.. i actually read a good comment by xerovy on his drake upload..
if he is transcoding and flogging stuff off as (Retail) and pulling it off.. he has certainly fooled a lot of people... but everyone to there own! we all do our own thing... 
are you thinking of doing 320CBR! as in a transcode! or CDRip... "
[V],jainmehul,2010-06-22T06:53Z,"wow!!! i m not talking about nofs....he is a great uploader!!!!
i m just telling that people here have very less knowledge about mp3 files..... i will never upload any stuff in 320 CBR!!!!!!!!!!...."
[V],bubanee,2010-06-22T07:04Z,"o.k i thought thats what you were getting at with Nofs... yes i suppose he is good at what he does.. 
no more about Nofs... :))
MP3 is confusing to some peeps but others don't give a shit..lol.. 
anyway i only dropped in to look around all the sites and i saw what you uploaded just now :)))) 
here's a good one to keep an eye out for... 
3oh!3 - Streets Of Gold 
See Ya!! "
