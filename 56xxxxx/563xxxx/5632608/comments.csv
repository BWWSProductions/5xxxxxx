,phish2525,2010-06-17T19:30Z,Thank you so much for uploading all of the shows so far- the band sounds amazing and is playing so tight right now!  Thanks for the hard work!
,bmcelvan,2010-06-17T20:04Z,"Definitely SBD, more than likely LivePhish...sounds terrific! Much much better than the previous shows uploaded so far...THANK YOU!!

mpcteck: do you have the other shows from this tour...could you upload those as well?

Thanks and WELL DONE!"
,bmcelvan,2010-06-17T20:06Z,Wow...I'm an idiot...you are the person doing all the posting. Thanks...where did you get this source - as it is SBD and the others are not?
,mpcteck,2010-06-18T02:23Z,"bmcelvan  - I have been getting all of these from (d)emenoid. I could not tell you if they are all from the same source there though, but I would imagine that they are. Maybe they finally started getting their hands on the SBDs.

phish2525 - You are very welcome. Don't they sound awesome?! Can't wait to see them in Indiana.

To everyone else - sorry there are still so few seeds. We have just a few seeders right now with a lot of people downloading, so please keep downloading so we can turn the numbers around."
,phish2525,2010-06-18T02:59Z,Stuck at 99.8% for most of the afternoon?

,VTGREEN,2010-06-18T15:57Z,"I'll be seeding all day, but im also stuck at 99.8%, cant listen to moma, jones"
,shortfuse3776,2010-06-18T16:34Z,I'll also be seeding but stuck still @ 99.9 the show is sounding good waiting on Mama dance & Stealing time 
,phish2525,2010-06-18T17:15Z,Wait until you all hear last nights show...dankest DWD I've ever heard...threw it down!  I was doing a live audio stream via ustream.com

,momerath,2010-06-20T16:01Z,"Thanks for this! finally made it to a show after 12 years and this is the one we saw. cant believe this dl hit 1.7mbps and then froze at 99.8. I i will seed this for a month once finished, shit i might not ever remove it! Its called p2p SHARING people! not grab and go!"
,phish2525,2010-06-21T21:32Z,"Come on, seed this one, I've been stuck at 99.8% for 5 days...someone come back to seed for the rest of us who are waiting for the ending!  Thanks!!"
,anonymo99,2010-06-21T23:18Z,"Thank you so much!!!

Any chance at the two nights in Hartford, and the two at SPAC?"
,mpcteck,2010-06-22T01:46Z,"So i am out of town for like three days and it looks like the other seeders that we did have dropped out during that time. I am just about to start seeding again.

Also, I would love to make some more torrents for the newest shows but I cannot get them from (D)emenoid anymore without logging in, and their registration is closed. Hopefully, someone will hook me up with an invite code."
,mpcteck,2010-06-22T04:59Z,"Anyone paying attention and stuck at 99.8 percent or whatever should stop downloading, and once the number of seeds pick up, redownload. I will keep seeding, but I think everyone will be stuck for a while otherwise. 

Pro uploaders - Have I done something wrong with my upload to cause this?"
,shortfuse3776,2010-06-22T21:25Z,something is strange I've tried that & I'll get to 99.9 the it goes back to 99.8 but the songs are playing for me any way so I'll keep sharing thanx
,phish2525,2010-06-22T23:52Z,Anyone got Hartford SBD's??
,xantus954,2010-08-02T03:35Z,"Someone please seed this one again, Please!"
