Hi to all downloaders,

I just discovered that I've missed two English subtitle files for episodes 12 & 18, so I've uploaded them to my Skydrive account and you can download them if you want as they are perfectly synced with their files.

Here are the links:

,gidninja,2010-06-23T03:25Z,"**thx so much for providing season 2!! finishing season 1 on netflix and season 3 is due out in the fall on TV. Hate to miss season 2 cause it didn't come out in time on retail dvd =)  **  

the Episode 12 file gives me a ""mux is wrong"" error when i goto burn the files to dvd.

Thought maybe it was because, when i imported Epi.12 to burn, it already showed me that attached was an .srt. However when i watched the Epi. there were no subtitles. 

So i removed the .srt and added the individual file you provided from the link below and that failed as well with ""mux error"" message.

Guess i'll just burn the Epi with no .srt.
I suspect i'll have same error with Epi.#18"
,gidninja,2010-07-07T18:08Z,"actaully, ive discovered its for episodes 12 and 19.
18 was ""white tulip"" and there is an SRT for that.
Its epi. 19 ""The man from the other side"" that has no ""usuable"" srt.
I say usable because i opened the file and found all this:

-------------end sample-----------------------

which is maybe why you didnt have any usable SRT files. 12 and 19 are both filled with this ""mess"" of links and texts and whatever else.
and both are exactly the same content"
