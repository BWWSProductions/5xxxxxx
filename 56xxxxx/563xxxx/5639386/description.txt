The game was released on 28 April 2010 but nobody seems to have cracked it so I'm uploading this in hope that someone will. Maybe they are waiting for a retail copy because this one is from steam.
The installation language is russian.
The game language is russian and english and maybe more. I don't know. I just hope someone will crack it. 
I've never installed it but I'm sure it doesn't work.
