As I previously mentioned I am in the process of archiving and re-uploading my entire collection of Chomsky materials.

Due to a hard-drive failure the process has been somewhat delayed.

Thanks go to temptation for his attempts at resurrection.

Patience will reap it's rewards.

Till then here's the (almost) full collection of Chomsky/Finkelstein/Zinn,etc torrent files I originally uploaded or helped seed for so long..

I just hope that most are still active.

They will all be available (plus much, much more) in due course!
