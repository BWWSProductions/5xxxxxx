,christer.26,2010-06-21T23:36Z,"Sorry...The only thing the crack do is to replace a modifyed jhook.dll in the Jaws 11 directory ...All?? It also disabled the activation dialog box witch normally appear when you boot up your computer. This is done by adding a simple text string in the jhook.dll file. The backside of this method is that Jaws after 5 minuts after starting the computer turns into a ""delay mode of 0,5 seconds"" and therefor will respond slowly at the user input of the keyboard. This is a part of the protection of Jaws and not the ""cracked jhook.dll"" If yoou start Jaws without the crack the program will ask for activation and runs fine in 40 minuts. If you restart Jaws again without rebooting the computer a message will pop up ""trial time expired...bla, bla..."" If you then activate ""run as demo"" Jaws will quit. If you don't respond and activate ""run as demo"" the program will automatically slow down after 5 minuts when NO INPUT IS GIVEN... This is NOT WORTH downloading sincbecause Jaws will slowdown significant after 5 minuts after the computer has been rebooted!!  Would be interesting to scan the registry before Jaws starts up and after terminating and hopefully find a registry value with prevent Jaws running without restarting! ...Sorry, but this RELEASE in not worth downloading because of the huge slowdown and this is not related to the crack itself but a part of the protection!! A good working crack should also contain jfw.exe and it is not present in this release.... "

I basically run it and ignore the request to activate and it runs just fine. Iam just a bit dissapointed it doesn't have the arabic language since my aunt is blind and was hoping i get in arabic, but english would do."
