These songs take me back to good old days of college radio, where we played underground music. We played what was not the norm, we played what we felt that deserved a lot more hell of an attenton. Now thanks to the net, that underground music is re-discovered and 80â€™s revival is a fact now! Ladies and gents, here's Vol 49! Enjoy, seed and comment! And one big thank you to Mikeyten for track no. 9. You have an awesome taste man!
