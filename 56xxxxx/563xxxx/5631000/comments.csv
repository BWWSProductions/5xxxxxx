,gunga66,2010-06-20T21:36Z,Please check audio. Was out of sync for me.

,PHREEBO,2010-08-05T17:15Z,"The audio was out of sync for me too. I was able to fix it with mkvmerge GUI (it's free).. Took just 30 sec to mux the fixed audio track...> Open mkvmerge GUI and drag the MKV in the input area. Check just the audio track & under format options set it @ a delay of -222ms then mux (it will give you another MKV file with just the fixed audio track), then mux that back with the original video (uncheck the old audio track and use the new one) - (TIP: add file, don't append)... While your at it, you can drag the srt in there too. Other than that, great job MKVGuy, thanks again."
