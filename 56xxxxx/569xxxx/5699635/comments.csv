,ioannisarc,2010-07-18T12:24Z,Thank you very much.
,suewolf,2010-07-18T13:52Z,"Thanks again for everything.

Have you heard of a special Make magazine edition called Prototype Lab? It was issued in May, about Arduino and Lego and maybe more.

Do you have the May 2010 issue of Circuit Cellar? #238

Also any Everyday Practical Electronics from 2010 except January.

Just a request ... anything you can do will be deeply appreciated.

Thanks again."
,suewolf,2010-07-18T14:14Z,"Oops ... sorry ... the magazine is Prototyping Lab, a Make: Projects, and it looks like it is in Japanese, and thus probably only sold in Japan

,suewolf,2010-07-18T14:22Z,"Ha ha, maybe I should just shut up about that. And it isn't Lego -- looks more like NanoBlocks, though I didn't know they had gears. Much to most of Make: stuff has been translated into Japanese, but it looks like this one is being sold in Japan exclusively, or at least before the USA. Sorry if I caused any problems. I do still need the Circuit Cellar and 2010 EPE editions.

Thanks again."
