      Jimmy Doherty embarks on a quest to reveal the hidden lives of
      farmyard animals. He finds out about chickens: often taken for
      granted, what really goes on inside their brains? On a farm in
      Devon he finds out how chickens decide the pecking order. He also
      tries to find answers to questions such as how do chickens
      communicate with their chicks? How can chickens look in two
      directions at once? And can hens really change sex?
