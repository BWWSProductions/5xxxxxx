If it weren't for my late father, a passionate lover of jazz, chances are I would never have bothered with John Coltrane--and quite possibly the whole genre altogether. If "A Love Supreme" and "Blue Train" are two of this saxaphonist's best albums, then "My Favorite Things" has to rank a close third. Never before have I heard such a lovely reinterpretation of the classic title song as performed by Coltrane. His warm and inviting sax glides with ease through this 13 minute piece, which is also highlighted by the excellent piano work of McCoy Tyner. The lively "Summertime" is just flat-out perfect and shows Coltrane at his most expressive and skillful, and the bass and drums, from Steve Davis and Elvin Jones respectively, blend nicely into the mix. "My Favorite Things" is a classy and elegant CD that's required listening for anyone who is into jazz and also interested in this incredibly talented saxaphonist. This is such a wonderful album. Have worn out my cassette recording and am glad to have a digital copy.
