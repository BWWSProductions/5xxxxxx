[V],jainmehul,2010-07-29T13:11Z,can anybody comment on thequality???...
,gunnyg,2010-08-14T14:41Z,"mate, if these are Blu-ray rips then why are they in 720x304 resolution?"
,midurix,2010-09-08T22:46Z,Dvd resolution is 720/704 Ă 480/576 so there isn't point in this being a blu-ray rip over a dvd rip really apart from getting 5.1 sound. I do love h264 for a codec but i think i will stick to kingdom releases.
,yopepoy,2010-11-12T09:42Z,there are still few people who has a low processor. thats his reason not to make it to 720p.
,dearghoul,2010-11-12T23:04Z,"Thanks mate. 
Thanks to the studio - Don't worry, yo didn't lose any money - I wasn't gonna buy the dvds anyhow."
,spunkster,2010-11-16T03:09Z,"@midurix  - yopepoy is correct. Not everyone has newer computers or graphics cards capable of playing full HD, but BRips are still WAY clearer and better than DVDrips. I've learned this recently and started trying to aim only for Brips between 1-2gb, which is as large as my system can play them smoothly without suffering much quality. For those with super old systems, not much drive space, or who want to burn onto CDs, 700mb rips are fine. For you and anyone with a newer system and the HD space to spare, there's full 720p and 1080p rips out there. Different strokes for different folks."
