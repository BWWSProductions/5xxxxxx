The Spencer Davis Group was a mid-1960s British beat group from Birmingham,
England formed by Spencer Davis with Steve Winwood and his brother Muff
Winwood. Their three best known songs are "Keep On Running", a number one in
the UK Singles Chart written by reggae musician Jackie Edwards; and "Gimme
Some Lovin'" and "I'm a Man".

Winwood left in 1967, to form Traffic before joining Blind Faith, then forging a
career as a soloist. After releasing a few more singles the band ceased activity in
1968. Davis started a new group in 2006, although only Davis remains from the
1960s line-ups

The Spencer Davis Group was formed in 1963 in Birmingham when Welsh
guitarist Spencer Davis recruited vocalist and organist Steve Winwood and his
bass playing brother Muff Winwood. The group was completed with Pete York on
drums.Originally called the Rhythm and Blues Quartette, the band performed
regularly in the city. They signed their first recording contract after Chris
Blackwell of Island Records saw them at an appearance in a local club; Blackwell
also became their producer.

The group's first professional recording was a cover version of "Dimples", but they
came to success at the end of 1965 with "Keep On Running", the group's first
number one single. In 1966, they followed this with "Somebody Help Me" and
"When I Come Home". For the German market the group released "Det war in
SchÃ¶neberg, im Monat Mai" and "MÃ¤del ruck ruck ruck an meine grÃ¼ne Seite" (the
first is from a 1913 Berlin operetta, the second is a Swabian traditional) as a tribute
single for that audience, Davis having studied in West Berlin in the early 1960s. By
the end of 1966 and the beginning of 1967, the group released two more hits,
"Gimme Some Lovin'" and "I'm a Man". Both of them sold over one million copies,
and were awarded gold disc status. These tracks proved to be their two bestknown
successes, especially in the U.S. Jimmy Miller was their producer.

In 1967, Winwood left to form Traffic; his brother Muff moved into the music
industry as A&R man at Island Records. In a joint venture, the soundtrack to the
film Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush featured both the Spencer Davis Group
and Traffic. After the Winwoods' departure, the Spencer Davis Group regrouped
with the addition of guitarist Phil Sawyer (ex-Les Fleur de Lys) and
keyboardist/vocalist Eddie Hardin (ex-A Wild Uncertainty) This line-up recorded
several tunes for Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush and released the "Time
Seller" single in July 1967; the b-side, "Don't Want You No More," also received
radio
