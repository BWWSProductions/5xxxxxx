Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 60 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



Ernesto lives in a state of constant limbo: He's excited at the prospect of obtaining an exit visa, and terrified at the thought of wasting away in Havana. But when this conflicted Cuban falls deeply in love, he realizes that sometimes one must make sacrifices in order to achieve true happiness. 

Ernesto has been trying to leave the country since he can remember. AnaÂ´s family left Cuba on a raft but she decided to stay behind. From the moment they met, Ana and Ernesto fall hopelessly in love but Ana knows she canÂ´t ask Ernesto to stay behind, and he knows he canÂ´t ask her to leave with him.
