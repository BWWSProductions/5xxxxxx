I am having an issue with Captivate 5... it installs fine but the when I open the program it just hangs on the loading window... i have installed 5 times and still can figure it out... any idea what I can do to fix it?  Many thx"
,MICR0S0FT,2010-09-02T07:40Z,"@bill1111: Try clicking on the loading screen and give it a while (10 minutes), and it should load up. I had this issue with Illustrator.

@thethingy: Works great as all of your torrents seem to work great and NO VIRUS'."
,digimike50,2010-12-19T05:06Z,Nice one - thanks!

,allbhat,2011-03-18T08:42Z,"Hi TheThingy

Can you please give us Captivate 5 for MAC?"
,lollygreen,2011-05-09T01:31Z,"I installed this fantastic program on my last computer (64 bit) tried to install in on my new computer (32 bit) and I get an error message when it first starts to install saying Installer failed to initialize. Plese download support advisor to detect the problem.

I went to the other link and downloaded and followed the Clean install.  I still got the same error message.

Any suggestions?"
,dna15,2011-06-01T17:07Z,"Hiya Thingy,

Do you have any plans to upload Captivate CS5.5 or the new eLearning Suite with CS5.5 updates?

Thanks in advance.

,koolgreece,2011-06-22T05:15Z,"Hi

Thanks for everything. I greatly appreciate all that you've done. "
,Purethat,2011-06-29T00:19Z,"Hi there, new to this stuff, would like to ask a little help.

I've done all as instructed, as Installation begins it says to insert disk.

Would appreciate help on this. 
Thanks."
,uhlersoth,2011-09-24T19:28Z,"Hi thethingy!
Doing an awesome job! Any idea when you may be able to put the Adobe e-learning suite 2.5 out for us poor plebs?
If not that, then Captivate 5.5 would be of incredible use!
Huge thanks for your superb work!"
,yusglas,2011-10-21T14:52Z,"Hi thethingy, iam running windows 7 and after installation it just sits at the loading screen, any ideas? Thanks for everything else, they work great !!!"
,jaquesmusic,2011-11-06T16:10Z,"i must be blind or stupid or just plain overlooking something here but, serials, etc? all i got was the program itself but nothing else, no read mes or anything of the like"
,jaquesmusic,2011-11-06T16:13Z,"oh and by the way, thethingy....... youre frikken awesome. i dont know who you are or where you came from but i do know that you single handedly improved the quality of my life. i'm hoping youre a ridiculously hot brunette female because liking you as much as i do is going to otherwise jeopardize everything i think i know about myself."
