,EmbMe,2010-07-18T15:56Z,"Very Very poor quality, only in black and white, And as stated, ONLY the rules (but barely readable at some points). Lot's ov' Crooked pages, so do expect yerself a /facepalm if yer ever would wish to print this out."
,tradigadu,2010-07-27T22:42Z,Unfortunatly this is FAKE! This is actually not the 8th edition of Warhammer rulebook. It's a lot older rulebook (3 or 4th ed. i think). And the quality is extreamly poor.
,tradigadu,2010-07-27T22:44Z,I was supose to press - not +
,CarlTildt,2010-08-08T14:09Z,"@tradigadu: This is Not a Fake! But very bad quality scan! barley readable! 

Worst quality scan I've ever seen!!! But if you can stand the super-crappy quality of this PDF it might give you a hint of the new rules. 
However I really hope somebody could give us a better scan. Maybe A full colourscan of the whole deal!? This is only 182 pages (of about 500). The rules, the magic lores and some new magic items.
Like mentioned before, crooked pages, some pages where the text vanish or vanish behind the edge! All thou the alternative at this point is to pay 60 Euro at GW-store, for basic rules :(

Hope we will se a better copy soon, and the new armybooks to, when the come out!"
,dougdoberman,2010-08-09T06:40Z,"This is a (poor-quality, black and white) scan of the abridged 8th Edition rulebook which comes with the ""Island of Blood"" boxed set.  It contains ALL of the rules and references necessary for gameplay, without the fluff of the hardbound rulebook.  While a full-color, cleaner scan of the full book is desirable, this IS what it claims to be. "
,Aiwass77,2010-09-29T22:48Z,"@CarlTildt, or you are the uploader (and a lier), or you are a moron. Tradigadu is right this IS A FAKE. I've been playing Warhammer since 18 years and this is just and OLDER AND BULLSHIT SCAN OF AN OUTDATED RULEBOOK.

Just downloaded and DELETED to not share CRAP. Shame on you."
,Wythel,2010-10-01T12:56Z,"This IS the 8th edition, just look at the damn rules inside (and the copyright 2009 at the end btw....)
But it's also true it has really bad quality."
,BRIMSTONE79,2010-10-20T08:58Z,"This is ok quality. The pics are not good, but I printed this book and it is ok. Belive me - any compendiums at the University are far worse. 
Ty for the upload. 
Not happy? BUY THE BOOK, CHEAP ASS!"
,BRIMSTONE79,2010-10-20T08:59Z,"Ok quality. I've printed it, and use it for gamenights. Noone has complained.
Not happy? Try buying the book ;-)"
,brynolf11,2011-02-13T18:13Z,"Bah, the text is perfectly readable, quit moaning! That's all that matters. There is a scan with better quality here if you care so much: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5969014/Warhammer_8_th_eighth_edition_rulebook"
,stuweyp,2011-06-27T09:51Z,"To clarify: these are the current (8th) ed rules - i have 7th ed at home and these are updated;
The main text is perfectly clear and legible, only some of the italicised captions on pics and borders are slightly less clear (but still legible) mostly because of the black and white photocopy. But seriously, it's a 27mb file, what did you expect? full colour HD?"
