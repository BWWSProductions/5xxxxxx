Please use Vlc player for playing these movies. nnMoreover, The spoken language is not English, but BENGALI. So, Subs are must."

,arthoheen,2010-08-22T11:18Z,"Thanks a lot for this awesome collection. Great job. Quality is good on most of the films.
There are a few problems with some though (viz. ""Teen Kanya"" has an average quality. ""Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne"" is incomplete. The audio on ""Sonar Kella"" goes progressively out-of-sync.)"
,rahsoft,2010-09-29T21:34Z,"I have one obvious question.
since these movies are in non english ( I know because I saw ghare baire on channel 4 ) is there any english subtitles for these movies ?
thanks"
,tillidie007,2010-10-05T17:26Z,"@Rahsoft, Sorry for the late reply.

Except for two movies (Chiriakhana, Seemabaddha), all are either provided with .srt files or themselves hardsubbed. Please use vlc for hassle free watching.

Enjoy."

Just a warning that VLC doesnt particularly like the video files of Jana Aranya. I had to restart VLC three or four times in order to watch the whole film."
