I'm in Canada and I plan to stop by HMV (music store) sometime this week. I'll see if I can find it, and if I do I'll defs upload in lossless."
,krisdes,2010-11-05T04:24Z,Omg its not even 320 kbps or FLAC :(
,krisdes,2010-11-05T04:29Z,"@Llamaduck

Yea that would be greatly appreciated. I mean lossless would be good (but think of all the seeders you need) but I'm happy with 320kbps"
