NOTES 


FIRST CHOPPED THE VIDEO UP INTO SECTIONS TO CROP OUT THE BLACK BARS IN SOME SCENES OF THE CAM, ADJUSTED THE COLORS, CONTRAST, SATURATION, RAN A DEFLICKER AND A FEW OTHER FILTERS TO SMOOTHE THE VID.  THEN  IT WAS TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER. THEN RAN THE AUDIO THROUGH A COUPLE FILTERS TO ADD SOME BASS AND MAKE IT SOUND A LITTLE MORE DYNAMIC, BUT IT IS CAM AUDIO SO ONLY SO MUCH CAN BE DONE. CHOOSE TO RESIZE TO 1.66 BEING HOW THE CROP WAS OF THE SOURCE CAM COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL FILM.



PLOT


In a happy suburban neighborhood surrounded by white picket fences with flowering rose bushes, sits a black house with a dead lawn. Unbeknownst to the neighbors, hidden beneath this home is a vast secret hideout. Surrounded by a small army of minions, we discover Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), planning the biggest heist in the history of the world. He is going to steal the moon. (Yes, the moon!) Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad. The world's greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo, Edith and Agnes.
