The most you will reach from downloading this will seemingly be 97.4%. However I, as well as other downloaders who've reached the 97.4 % level have actually downloaded 100% of the actual video file from this torrent and you can feed off of us anyway. Only the sample file and a torrentday spam text file are not fully downloading. You can always copy the usable .avi file to another folder and leave this torrent up if you want to ""seed"" the .avi file for other downloaders. Enjoy !"
,Leib,2010-12-19T04:55Z,PS - I went ahead and extracted just the .avi file and re-uploaded this torrent so there will appear a seeder. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6051150/Rabbit_Run_1970_Same_.avi_as_TASTE_but_no_other_files  Although after 1 hour TPB is not showing a seeder on my torrent I assure you that you will see a seeder once you start downloading.
