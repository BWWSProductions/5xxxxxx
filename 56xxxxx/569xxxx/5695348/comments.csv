This month?s edition of the Webby Award-winning series, starting July 15th, will feature a second annual retrospective of the past year?s best performances and guests all narrated by Daryl. The highlights include a medley with legendary Motown singer-songwriter Smokey Robinson, a live concert in Jamaica accompanied by reggae icon Toots Hibbert, a session alongside old Philly soulmate Todd Rundgren, a collaboration with Fall Out Boy?s Patrick Stump, as well as episodes touting newcomers such as promising tunesmith Diane Birch, emerging country star Jimmy Wayne and Boston bluesman Eli Paperboy Reed. The episode?s emotional peak comes with a tribute to T-Bone Wolk, the longtime musical director for Daryl Hall and John Oates, playing the appropriate ?I Miss You.?"
