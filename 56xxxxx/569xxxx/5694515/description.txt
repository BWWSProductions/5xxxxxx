         Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files revolutionizes paranormal     
         programming by investigating the evidence witnesses post      
         on the Internet every day. Have you ever seen a photo or      
         video online and wondered, "Is this real?" This is the show   
         that will answer that question.Heading up the Fact or Faked   
         Paranormal Files team is Ben Hansen, a former FBI agent       
         with a life-long fascination with the paranormal. Now,        
         having left the agency, he leads a young team of intrepid     
         investigators who will convene to dissect the latest          
         unusual images and decide whether they merit further          
         investigation. Grainy videos will be brought to life as       
         the team conducts thorough and elaborate experiments in       
         an attempt to recreate the phenomena, and Ben will make       
         the final choice which cases will require a trip into the     
         field. Once an investigation is underway, the team will       
         talk to witnesses, carry out experiments using the latest     
         in high tech detection devices, collect physical samples,     
         and determine whether a case should be debunked, or whether   
         it's a baffling paranormal mystery that might even put the    
         team in danger. It's all in a day's work for the dogged       
          investigators of Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files.
