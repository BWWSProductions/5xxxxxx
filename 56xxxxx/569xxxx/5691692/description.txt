  The lead character, called 'The Bride,' was a member of the     
  Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, lead by her lover 'Bill.'     
  Upon realizing she was pregnant with Bill's child, 'The Bride'  
  decided to escape her life as a killer. She fled to Texas, met  
  a young man, and on the day of their wedding was gunned down by 
  an angry and jealous Bill (with the assistance of the Deadly    
  Viper Assassination Squad). Four years later, 'The Bride' wakes 
  from a coma, and discovers her baby is gone. She, then, decides 
  to seek revenge upon the five people who destroyed her life and 
  killed her baby. The saga of Kill Bill Volume I begins.
