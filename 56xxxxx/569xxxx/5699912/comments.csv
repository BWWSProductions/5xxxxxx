,THEADreaNaL,2010-07-27T10:25Z,You're welcome :) !
,redox1,2010-08-17T10:03Z,"That is some nice compression. Excellent quality for such a small file size
Episode 4 is not working for me - only plays 3:17 then dies"
,THEADreaNaL,2010-08-23T16:38Z,"@ redox
That shouldn't be happening. Try re-downloading the file."
,eliel77,2010-09-28T03:52Z,"episode 4 is really only 3:17 min lenght. Its a problem with your rip adreanal or your upload. downloading it again wont solve the problem.
but overall great upload, all the others files are working fine. Thanks :)"
,THEADreaNaL,2010-09-29T15:58Z,"@eliel77
Cann't be a problem with the rip, I have played it over and over again on my own computer. But since more than 1 person is having the same problem, I'll re-download it and check myself."
,THEADreaNaL,2010-09-29T16:06Z,"I must apologize. Somehow, there is a problem with the uploaded file. The file appears to be only 3min 17secs long, and will play only as far on WMP. You should try VLC player, it will play out its entire length."
,THEADreaNaL,2010-09-29T16:54Z,"I owe you an apology. Somehow, the file uploaded DOES have a problem. Episode 4 appears to be only 3min 17secs long. It will only play that long in WMP. However, if you have VLC player, you can view the episode for its its complete length. "
,QuailHill,2010-10-17T20:14Z,"great quality.
cheers."
,Marcholi,2010-11-06T03:40Z,"Great work, thank you very very much dude, great quality 2.

THEADreaNaL, on my computer everything is fine except Episode 1 & 4 which is not a big deal i can still watch them on the VLC Player instead of QuickTime Player, but i did try to transfer the whole Season to my PS3 and then i can see at least on 9 Episodes it says Unsupported Data. 
Is there anything i can do so i can watch them on my TV rather than my Computer.
Many thanks."
,THEADreaNaL,2010-11-08T17:34Z,"@ Marcholi
Sorry, really can't help in that regard, unless you can hookup ur pc with ur TV instead of your monitor, or burn the whole thing on DVDs."
,BubbaWut,2010-11-14T21:30Z,"@Marcholi
Google a program called PS3 Media Server. It can transcode these (or most any other) video file on the fly from your PC to your PS3."
,nlmi,2010-11-22T14:05Z,I can not find any subtitles for this torrent.
,harakeeri,2010-12-10T10:39Z,"Episode 4 is somehow corrupted..even when I open it with VLC, it say's that it needs to repair the video then just plays until 3:17"
,twexile,2010-12-20T20:08Z,a9/v9
,twexile,2010-12-20T21:03Z,"I have found that the reports of S01E04 - The Arrival are true, however it plays just fine using vlc player once it has repaired it."
,samich-thor,2010-12-21T11:49Z,"For those of you having problems with the 4th episode, i suggest that you read this article:

http://techblissonline.com/repair-fix-avi-files-broken-divfix/

after i did exactly like in this article, the video file plays fine on BSPlayer and Media Player Classic.

By the way, thanks for a great share :)"

thx, tryin that now, seems to be working"
,.Leto.,2011-01-07T09:55Z,"So I've downloaded the first episodes of this torrent to see what quality was like -> deleted immediately. Too much compression so not worth dowloading if you intend to watch this on a big screen. The show looks good though so I'll be looking for a much better source, which shouldn't be difficult at all."
,Unit431,2011-01-19T09:38Z,"The ripper/uploader screwed up the aspect ratio. They've manually changed it to 16:9 (widescreen) from its native 4:3 (fullscreen). As such, it looks noticeably squashed. Looks rather horrid. 

If you're watching the show on your PC, get VLC Media Player, play an episode and go to Video -> Aspect Ratio -> 4:3. Looks MUCH better."
,Unit431,2011-01-19T17:22Z,"Ok, looks like the aspect ratio problem is only present in the pilot."
,sukdink9999,2011-01-23T20:58Z,"Half the files won't play on xbox...

... but thanks for the upload... "
,BandarenIBaren,2011-02-06T22:16Z,"As people allready pointed out the pilot is a cropped 4:3 streched to 16:9.

Everything on the left and right side is missing, so some things is hard to follow, like seeing what she's reading on the screen.

Pity!"
,bigboss-x,2011-03-07T20:55Z,"I've only watched up to episode 5 but the quality of episode 1 and episode 5 are quite poor, ep1 is cropped really badly, and episode 5 has some awful sound issue. Ep4 wouldn't run properly and i had to repair the episode to get it to play. I hope the rest of the episodes are more consistent in quality"
,maryl2310,2011-04-02T12:48Z,thanks!!
,teasolves,2011-07-31T21:59Z,You can fix episode 4 with vlc player.
,EtienneKlein,2011-08-01T14:07Z,You are freakin' brilliant man. Thanks a lot ;)

,lostspoil,2011-08-12T11:37Z,goddammit.. fucking americans you're willing to kill people for much less then having produced a bullshit series like lost etc.. how is it possible that osama is dead while lost producers can keep on doing their crap productions... 
,2b2o,2011-09-20T17:55Z,"Awesome series and awesome upload. Besides the episode 4 issue I noticed that episode 16 should be renamed to the following: Fringe S01E16 - Unleashed.avi

Thanks again!"
,mesays,2011-09-22T09:42Z,"I got episodes 1 and 4 from adifferent source after reading the comments but I have watched every other episode from your upload and must say a9 v 10 very well done thank you so much, I also grabbed your season 2 upload, is season 3 coming soon?"
,QWESTSUX,2011-10-01T04:02Z,"A/V: 8

Good quality considering compression to small files"
,swedish_man,2011-11-28T17:59Z,"Ep4 can be played in VLC, when it asks if u want to repair u repair and the file should be perfectly wacheable."
,TedLilly,2011-12-11T21:18Z,thanks for the up 
,Keithuk,2012-04-02T21:41Z,"I downloaded Fringe season 1 from another source and episode 4 plays for 48 mins but it stops half a dozen times you have to skip bits then it carries on.

If users are having problems with episode 4 then I won't bother with this one."
,RoflWafffles,2012-04-11T23:47Z,"People, please seeeedd D:"
,ohdeus,2012-04-25T20:13Z,"cool, thx!"
,Latterday_Lazarus,2012-05-27T18:11Z,"I tried putting these onto my PS3 and Episode 1,2, 15, 17,18,19 and 20 were either unsupported data or corrupt data.
They work just fine in Gom Player though.. Thanks for the upload, I'll just upload the individual episodes that messed up again."
,lovecat66,2012-06-11T01:01Z,"THX ! Great TV Show, I LOVE it ! However S01E04 includes only the firstis fuckin 4'00 minutes !!! Why don't you upload the WHOLE part ?!"
