this is a hacked version of pokemon emerald where you can play as mario instead of the regular character, i've also used Mastermind X's hack so it will have a day & night function as well, the file is in archive format and requires 7-zip to open, you can get the program for free from 7-zip.org, you need a gba emulator to run it, i recommended vbalink which is a modified version of the gba emulator visualboyadvanced except this one has a multiplayer function, you can get vbalink from vbalink.info
