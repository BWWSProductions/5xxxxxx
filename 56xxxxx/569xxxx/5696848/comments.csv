,rd1822,2010-07-20T22:00Z,"One Statuory Warning here Please do not watch Inception if ur a DumbFuck and if u belive that all that movies should be made for is cheap entertainment...'coz more than a film this is a Brain Exercising/Brain Teasing adventure...I do not remember a movie at whose end i stood up and clapped and made the rest of them clap...a movie which is Unbelieveably well concieved, well written, well directed and well performed...i was lucky to pay just 170 bucks and be able to watch this spectacle...but believe if i had paid a thousand bucks to watch this one...i wouldn't have repented a penny...this film shows all of us in the Indian Film Industry that we are centuries behind from them...James Cameroon showed the world the power of Technology in Film Making with Avatar...Chris Nolan shows the power of human mind's imagination, the power of screen writing, the power of Film Making with the basics...This Film to all students of Film Making is a Class U mustn't miss for ur life...and to the ones who like their brains being stretched go and see how Chris Nolan has sex with ur brains and gives u orgasm after orgasm...Pardon my language please but am just belittled,enthralled, and mesmerized by the thought of the writer... just waiting for a good print to download"
