Benidorm is a six-part comedy series from Derren Litten, (co-writer of The Catherine Tate Show), which features a strong ensemble cast of some of the finest comedy talent in the UK.

Set in the Solana all-inclusive Resort, Benidorm follows regulars and first-time holiday makers on their journeys abroad. Benidorm regulars for twenty years Jacqueline and Donald are enthusiastic middle-ages swingers who rarely leave the hotel. Known as 'The Oracle' because of his computer-like knowledge of trivial facts and figures, Geoff Maltby is on holiday with his mother, or PA as he calls her, but keen to hide the fact. Gavin and Troy are on their first break away together after setting up a successful hair salon. Kate and Martin's marriage is at braking point after only one night in the resort. Then there are The Garveys; a Lancashire family who are on their first holiday abroad. Janice and Mick plus Janice's mother - the sun-worshipping, chain-smoking Madge who can always be guaranteed to have a bad word for everyone.
