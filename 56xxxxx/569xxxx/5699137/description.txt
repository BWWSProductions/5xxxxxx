Cat Shit One - Episode 1

From Ain't It Cool News:

"Director Kazuya Sasahara from Studio Anima has confirmed that the first episode of the CG series will be completed by August of this year. Currently, it is targeted for a Japanese release, with international plans yet to be formed. Scheduling for episode two is also still undecided.

Motofumi Kobayashi's original Cat Shit One manga was released in North America by ADV in North America as "Apocalypse Meow." It was a didactic history of the Vietnam war with the American soldiers depicted as rabbits (a pun, USA GI as in usagi, as in the Japanese word for rabbit) and Vietnamese as cats (Koreans as dogs, Japanese as chimps, Russians as bears, ect). Originally aimed at an audience with an interest at military matters, narrative was used to stage a look at the nature and history of the conflict.

The animated project looks to be inspired by Cat Shit One '80, though updated to reflect a post Cold War situation.

Thanks for gridlink from Echelon Software for the heads up! Check out their first game Black Powder Earth. It looks like something that will appeal to the Cat Shit One audience."
