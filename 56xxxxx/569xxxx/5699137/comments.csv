,SebastionSynn,2010-10-09T10:05Z,"very good CGI, smooth throughout except for one section, interesting storyline even though i couldn't understand what was being said cause the subtitles didn't work for me but i could follow what was going on.

 episode 2 whenever it is finished and released should be very interesting as well. lets hope it's released soon."
