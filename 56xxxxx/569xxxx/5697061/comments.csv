,mikexxxryan,2010-07-17T07:35Z,"Fake.  I love how these fakes put up a ton of phony uploads and rip off an established uploaders moniker (MAX, IMAGINE, etc).  They seriously think we are stupid. Why do they do it?  They are after your IP address so they can report you to your IP who then cuts off your internet account.  Fuck \'em.  nnThis is fake.  Report here:nnhttp://forum.suprbay.org/nnUploader\'s account will be closed and their IP banned so they can\'t upload anything anymore."
,garycooper,2010-07-17T09:35Z,how can you tell that they are after your IP account. a friend of mine download a film of the piratebay recently and they got a letter saying they owed a company money for downloading a film torrent
