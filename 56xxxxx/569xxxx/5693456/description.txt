         Most people experience something rare or exceptional          
         once or twice in a lifetime, but Zahi Hawass, unimpeded       
         by his tireless lust for adventure, lives many                
         lifetimes in a single day; Zahi moves from a dig site         
         in Saqqara...descending deep underground to uncover           
         a cache of mummies; to the Workmen's Cemetery; and            
         finally, discovers a rare and important piece of Egyptian     
         history...a beautiful anthropoid sarcophagus from the 26th    
         Dynasty! After a day like that, anyone would be ready to      
         end their day...not Zahi...he's going to party at one of      
          Cairo's latest hotspots!
