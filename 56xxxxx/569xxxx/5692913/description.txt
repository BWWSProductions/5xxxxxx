In This Moment - A Star-Crossed Wasteland (with bonus tracks)

IN THIS MOMENT continue to carve out their own unique and exhilarating chapter in the hard rock genre. This group is collectively defined by their undying belief in themselves and this confidence and strength is conveyed perfectly through their new material. A Star-Crossed Wasteland was produced once again with acclaimed producer Kevin Churko (Ozzy Osbourne, Five Finger Death Punch) and the results are game-changing. The foundation is now in place for IN THIS MOMENT to catch fire in a big way.
