PLEASE do not complain because they are not separate tracks, so I found so I seed
use the cue to split into separate tracks, and foobar to play

as all the Mosaic Select this is a Limited Edition 5000 copies, I decided to seed here since I saw there are many fans of this genre, and this collection well worth the download

063861-2 Boogie Woogie Man Vic 27505
063863-1 Barrel House Boogie Vic 27504
063864-1 Cuttin' The Boogie -

Note: Some LP and CD re-issues incorrectly title Boogie Woogie Man as Boogie Woogie Jump with the matrix 063862-1 assigned to it. And although the Victor artist contract sheets do list a Boogie Woogie Jump (with matrix 063862-1) to have been issued on RCA Victor LEJ-1 (10" LP) and RCA Camden CAL-328 (12" LP), no metal part or test with that matrix number exists in the vaults and both these RCA re-issues use the common 78 take (-2) of Boogie Woogie Man. Not included in this set is an alternate take (-1) which is almost identical to the issued take, and a -3 which is the same as the issued take. Some discographies cite -1 for the 78 release, yet the Victor file card states "#1 unsightly light grooves" and the only take marked for release was -2.
