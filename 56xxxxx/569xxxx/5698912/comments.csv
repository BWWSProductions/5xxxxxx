[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-07-22T05:48Z,"Oh come on guys! This is the slowest bloody torrent I have ever seeded. Nobody is uploading much but expecting to download. Tip: You can download more if you upload more. It's reciprocal. 
Start bloody sharing!
If you don't have a +1 ration by the time you finish then you aren't doing your responsibility."
,BadMoses,2010-08-02T18:05Z,"Hey Timmy, can I get some seeding on your 14-10-08 and 7-10-08 bookpacks, also wanted to know if it's cool if I combine the bookpacks with other ebooks I collected to upload as an entire library?"
[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-08-04T17:29Z,"BadMoses, uploading them now. As for the book pack you want to upload, go for it brother!"
