,Hokum6,2010-07-16T16:00Z,Wright now i got confirmation on one torrent tracker  that this version working with lates 1.02 patch but i did not tested yet...
,Hokum6,2010-07-17T01:02Z,"I have tried out this crack and it work PERFECT! Great job SKIDROW wizards,S!rnHere is link for crack only...rnhttp://d08.gamecopyworld.com/?r=pc_dcs_black_shark&c=20664&d=2010&f=sr-dcsbs!7z"
,Hokum6,2010-07-17T01:03Z,"sry, let me try one more time... ;)rnrn  http://d08.gamecopyworld.com/?r=pc_dcs_black_shark&c=20664&d=2010&f=sr-dcsbs!7z"
,cheekycheek,2010-07-19T15:14Z,Lets try seed! :D
,a1adin,2010-07-19T21:41Z,"Hokum6, that link is for v1.0?? so it works with v1.02? Please confirm."
,wabbit1959,2010-07-20T01:15Z,"A1adin I don't know if Hokum6 will ever answer you but this is the exact same size as the NON working Skidrow ""cracked"" game that has been posted everywhere. I wish I knew for sure but I'm not going to put the effort into it unless I hear otherwise. If it does work with the 1.0.2 patch it will be the first one on the internet. I think you are the same one I have been talking to on MUF and Teh.
If this is the Skidrow version it's only the 1.0.0 version, AFAIK"
,wabbit1959,2010-07-20T01:28Z,"The link Hokum6 pointed to is Definitly only for the V 1.0.0, Anything other then that is very rare. there is a crack for 1.0.1c that requires jumping through a lot of hoops and using alcohol 120% to leave a Russian disk image mounted while playing the game. I'll wait for a real crack for patch 1.0.2 and just learn on this version until that comes out. They say if you can fly the v 1.0.0 then v 1.0.2 will be real easy apparently it handles better lol."
,Hokum6,2010-07-20T01:40Z,"Afirmativ Aladin,my combination is win7 X64+ Russian DVD version+1.02 russian patch + skidrow 1.0 crack (1.6MB) from gamecopyworld site-in that order. Working perfect."
,Hokum6,2010-07-20T01:47Z,"There is posibilty that this crack is only for russian version but i'm not shure.Anyway,dont get confused with 1.0 marking,it is probably some mistake in the naming of file...Do you use win7?Win7 and starforce is not in love so cracking is much easyer... "
,Hokum6,2010-07-20T01:49Z,"Oh yes i almost forgot, dont listen Wabit 1959.He is probably some ED lover guy...;)"
,Hokum6,2010-07-20T01:51Z,"NHF, just kidding... ;)"
,Hokum6,2010-07-20T02:10Z,"Guys,dont get confused with '1.0' marking, it is probably some mistake in naming of file...But, there is posibilty that this crack is only for russian version(which is not so big deal in 1.02,only need to rename one folder and english meny is there) so maybe this is problem...
Just ask if you need help..."
,Hokum6,2010-07-20T02:11Z,"Duh,posts is buging,sry for duplicating posts... :("
,AJaromir,2010-07-21T13:56Z,Can someone confirm if it works with ENG online version 1.0.2?? I made something as crack but it works on 98%
,pakster,2010-08-23T13:38Z,"hello guys,

I tried downloading the http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5716371/DCS__Black_Shark_%5BENGLISH%5D%5BEagle_Dynamics%5D_2010_TRiViUM version and is working perfectly with every update of the game. When you mount the image go to the folder called ""TRiViUm"" . In that folder there is a file called ""4Dummies.png"" follow the instruction from this file to use with the keygen... works perfect !!!!. and works multiplayer also.. :D"
,PKM9000,2011-02-28T23:38Z,This does work. I'm glad I tried it before buying because this sim is proper shite. 
,hortonofdoom,2011-03-05T16:19Z,Im using win 7 64bit and damn i can't play the setup won't start.
,wengy78,2011-04-16T22:09Z,"How do you get this to work? I've downloaded this torrent, and installed it. I also downloaded the Skidrow crack from the GameCopyWorld site, although I see it's also included on this Skidrow disc image. I copy the contents of the crack into the program folder:

C:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\Ka-50\bin\stable

The game works fine right up until I try and actually fly, then it pops up an error message saying it can't find a common.dll 

I noticed the crack has one additional folder called ""x86"", have I put the crack files in the wrong place?
