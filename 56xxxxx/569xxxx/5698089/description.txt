About this game:
Mr. Potato Head is once again stepping up to the microphone as the M.C. of Fun to rally families and friends together to play a new lineup of Hasbro-inspired games in Hasbro Family Game Night 2. This package includes five popular games: Operation, Jenga, Bop-It, Pictureka, and Connect 4X4. Each game will offer an Original Mode reflecting traditional board game play and Advanced Modes, including the all-new "Hasbro Family Game Show" which shifts players into party mode with Mr. Potato Head as the master of ceremonies. Players will feel as if they've been transported to a live television game show studio complete with an audience, a spinning "Challenge Wheel" and the opportunity to win big virtual prizes. In addition to providing new and exciting ways to play, the Wii version will allow fans to completely customize Mr. Potato Head, pick new themes, and obtain new trophies to add to their collection.
