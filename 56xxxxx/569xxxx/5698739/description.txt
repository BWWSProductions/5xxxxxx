PLOT
For a price, any organ in your body can be replaced. But it can also be repossessed.

Set in the near future when artificial organs can be bought on credit, it revolves around a man who struggles to make the payments on a heart he has purchased. He must therefore go on the run before said ticker is repossessed.
