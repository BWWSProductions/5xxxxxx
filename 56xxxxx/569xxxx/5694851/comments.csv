,lucyfan98,2010-09-17T21:30Z,"Hey Greenbud1969, I was wondering if you possibly had a movie called Two Came Back? I have been looking for it for many years, and all I have found is one with Swedish subtitles that would never download. If you possibly have it, could you e-mail me and let me know? Thank you,
