This is a really cool Tull show from 1980 with the classic formation, in the last part of Stormwatch tour and near the end of Tull's golden age.
This is a really interesting material from an german TV show, alternating cenes of an Ian Anderson interview with songs from a show in Munich. Rare stuff!
