The first demo for Shitwizard, the greatest band since the Jonas Brothers to appear in modern mainstream music. Compelling vocals, intricate guitars, groovy percussion, and bass that grounds an radical foundation. 
Shitwizard was formed in March of 2010 when Jimmy "Shit" Jones decided to pick up a guitar, and to his surprise, he found out he was the greatest guitarist in the world. He quickly found Billy Roberts while he was creeping around the local elementary school, and asked him if he wanted to be in his band. What came next was magic. As Jimmy raped Billy with his guitar, Billy let out these wonderful shrieks, to which the entire neighbourhood came out and watched in awe. 2 Police came, and instead of arresting Jimmy, they asked if they could join the band. That is how Shitwizard formed.
