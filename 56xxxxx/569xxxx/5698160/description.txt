Back in 1965 Inga Swenson was better known as a
stage actress. But people from my generation
(the 1980s) know her as Mrs. Krause in the
BENSON sitcom.

And for us fans of classic TV, Inga had the
title guest role of Inger Cartwright (Hoss'
mother) in the BONANZA flashback episode
"Inger, My Love". A few years later she
made her own PASSWORD appearance playing
against famous movie actor James Mason.
