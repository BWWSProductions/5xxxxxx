What young boy doesn't wish for his very own giant robot?  Every kid fantasizes of a mechanized friend that can tower over bullies and adults alike, take you to strange new places, and basically make you into the coolest kid on earth.  Well, Jason's dreams are about to come true, or at least that's what he thinks when he finds a giant cybernetic hand sticking out of a crevasse near his desert home.  What will his inventor grandfather and stubborn kid sister think of his ultimate toy?  And what other trouble will the earthquakes that unearthed the giant machine man cause?
