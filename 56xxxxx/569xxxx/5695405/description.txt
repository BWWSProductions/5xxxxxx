Okay I have uploaded a few videos that have been optimized to play on the HTC HD2 Mobile phone, but they will play on anything that supports MP4

And by optimized, I mean they are as big as the screen handles and at a bit rate video and sound wise that would not get noticeably better if they were higher.  A couple are older video√¢
