A couple are older video?s and so not real sharp, but Undisclosed desire by muse was Hi Def to start with and will be the sharpest one I have put up.n	nNOW AC3, there appears to be nothing yet out there that will handle/play it on the HTC HD2 at this time.  So I have to re-encode everything pretty much that I have as most of my stuff has AC3 sound.nnSo over the last couple of days I have thrown many formats etc at my new phone and found that the format I have used is the best for the HTC inbuilt player and the windows media player.nnNow neither of the 2 players handle avi/divx codecs unless the output container is an mp4 and then they are not true divx .nnHowever coreplayer does handle avi/divx and almost every other popular format and has some handy features, like making the screen more colourful etc.  (But not AC3 Sound)nnNow the program I used to convert these is free and it?s called (SUPER ?), and it converts almost anything to anything and it also has a volume boost which is handy to boost the volume on video?s as AC3 ones I find are hard to hear on the external speaker unless boosted.  My main gripe against the HTC HD2, lousy inbuilt speaker, but I knew that before I bought it.nnhttp://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.htmlnnThese are the settings I usednOutput Container (MP4),  Output Video Codec (H264/AVC), Output Audio Codec (AACLC), Video Size ,(800x480), Frames (30), Bitrate (1536),  Sampling Freq (44100),Channels (2),  Bitrate kbps (224), Volume boosted by 50db              nnEnjoynGarfieln"
