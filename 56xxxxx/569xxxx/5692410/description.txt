"Fragmentos da Vida":
"In a building site, a worker agonizes, after an accident, and tells his son about the virtues of honest work, but he's not heard. Turned into a vagabond and having mean people as company, the youth decides to get arrested in order to find a solace against winter. When he finally decides to follow his father advice and get himself a job, he falls under the influence of a policeman, under the false accusation of robbery." Quote from IMDB.
