10 Things You Didn't Know About Avalanches

Iain Stewart travels across breathtaking mountain ranges and glaciers to reveal ten remarkable stories about avalanches. Thousands of avalanches happen throughout the world each year, and yet the chaotic turbulence inside an avalanche remains a mystery. Scientists have had to put themselves right inside a raging avalanche to find out more. In this film we discover how the deadliest avalanche in history killed 18,000 people in just a few minutes; how Hannibal's army was devastated by avalanches as he crossed the Alps to fight Rome; why an avalanche was key to one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time; and how global warming may increase the rate of ice avalanches in the future.
