,olmenvk,2010-07-17T15:34Z,anyone got subtitles for this?
,olmenvk,2010-07-17T15:35Z,great up btw. A:9 V:9
,Goham,2010-07-17T22:23Z,Is this the real deal?
,Goham,2010-07-17T23:06Z,"It?s the real deal, nicely done"
,Goham,2010-07-17T23:37Z,"I take it back, without subs this is useless..."
,djhansson,2010-07-18T16:38Z,The scene group fucked up again. They've made a real.repack though that includes the subs.
,steve4,2010-07-30T09:31Z,Agree on audio problems. The mp3 audio stream is rated at an unusual 122 Kbps and my media player does not like that. Why not the more common 128?
,djhansson,2010-08-03T23:36Z,"Regarding the problems, there's nothing I can do about that. It's the scene who's fucked up..

Although there are more better release's of this one out.

And im glad someone enjoyed this one."
