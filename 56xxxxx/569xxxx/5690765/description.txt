Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Platinum 

Like the previous two games, the objective of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is to complete a series of preset scenarios by successfully building, owning, and maintaining amusement parks. Players can research and build theme park rides such as merry-go-rounds, chairswings, bumper cars, gravitrons, log flumes, and ferris wheels, among many others. In addition to using preset designs, players can build their own roller coasters, laying out individual track pieces, choosing direction, height, and steepness, and adding elements such as corkscrews, loops, and on-ride cameras. Foliage and landscaping is customizable to fit the theme of the park. RollerCoaster Tycoon requires players to balance finances and their guests' happiness by adding merchandise shops, food stalls, and hiring staff to repair rides and clean up messes. To finance construction, players can raise concession or ride prices or take out loans. New rides can be researched over time to expand the park.
