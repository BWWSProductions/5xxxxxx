      The Dragons are back and hungry to secure themselves the best
      deal. These may be challenging times economically, but that
      hasn't deterred the nation's entrepreneurs from pitting their
      wits against the multimillionaire investors. Devon-based
      vineyard owner Geoff Bowen hopes his unusual business
      proposition will tempt the Dragons, inventor Derek Cozens
      thinks that road signs are so last century, and Kirsty Henshaw
      hopes the Dragons will be tempted by her frozen pudding business.
