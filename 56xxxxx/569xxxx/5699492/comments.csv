,omegafox84,2010-07-18T22:09Z,"@GUYMOVIE: you're welcome. i might upload some more JC movies in the future. for right now though, Armageddon or 12 Rounds?

@ctang: no problem man. glad i had something you wanted. since you're always uploading movies for everyone else, i do have the ""wax on, wax off"" trilogy and can get that up for you soon."
[T],ctang,2010-07-18T23:33Z,thank you so much...dvd5 or 9 i dont even care :)
[T],ctang,2010-07-18T23:36Z,"i know the imdb link is at the top of the page, but if you put one more space in the description it will allow that link to also be a hyperlink and not have to copy and past...just a suggestion :)...i have to say again thanks for these and the wax on, wax off trilogy!!!"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-19T05:23Z,k man i'll wait for the release of 12rounds and armageddon man.........
,omegafox84,2010-07-19T06:32Z,"@ctang: sure don't mention. did you mean i should put an extra space before the http? if so, i'll give it a try on the next torrent. thanks for the tip!"
[T],ctang,2010-07-19T17:57Z,ya thats what i meant :)...just finished rush hour 1 and now on to rush hour 2!!!

,omegafox84,2010-07-21T21:16Z,@GUYMOVIE: that's fine. i'll have Armageddon up for you next.
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-22T08:16Z,thank man looking for it......
,omegafox84,2010-07-23T23:49Z,"@GUYMOVIE: sorry, i'm not able to rip the Armageddon dvd onto my hdd. i was able to do it before to get this copy but can't seem to remember how i did it. is there another movie i can do for you instead?"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-24T05:20Z,s man the whole lot of JC movies u got to upload for me please try all the movies he ever acted.....
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-24T05:23Z,and also please try for American Pie:The naked mile no one helped me with it except ctang...he too don't have this one
[T],ctang,2010-07-25T20:23Z,"omegafox:  the best way to copy DVD's is dvdfab in my opinion...there may be better ways but getting the newest version has always worked best for me...you can find it here or damn near every warez site that is available

i will see what i can do about the naked mile guymovie...i already have a ton of requests i am filling by you and others though so when i get to it i will get to it, that is if i even find it"
,omegafox84,2010-07-25T23:33Z,"@ctang: yeah, i've tried the most recent DVDFab as well as 2 older versions, plus several other programs but nothing seems to work. tried full disc & main movie. it always gets hung up at the end of the rip. i've watched the movie all the way through before no problem. it's clean with no major scratches too. the only thing i can think of is that i've noticed it has two angles. i've tried ripping both at the same time and each separately, but still nothing. it's quite frustrating considering i don't even care much for the movie! lol. thanks for your help though!"
[T],ctang,2010-07-26T06:44Z,"i will rent it and see what i get...since its an old release it only costs me 75 cents to rent :)

by the way, i finished all 3 Rush hour movies and they are all great :)...cant wait for the karate kid movies...i will be out of town for the next few days moving out of my apartment so i wont be downloading or uploading anything til after that so if you had something other than the karate kid movies to upload then you can do them...i dont want you to feel obligated to do them if i cant even download them"
,omegafox84,2010-07-26T11:11Z,that's great to hear. i haven't uploaded any new torrents yet as i've been doing some downloading and wanted to make sure i seeded enough before starting on anything else. have fun with the moving! :)
