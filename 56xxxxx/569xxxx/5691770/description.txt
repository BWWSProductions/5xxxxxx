Release Notes 
Source: THANKS to slugger and TA!

Not a bad cam,However it did have it's isssues. Most of the issues where only
minor though. It does seem like it has part of screen cut off again,this is
probably due to zooming in too much. Also has different crop positions,so we
cropped to the widest frame. Ran a low deblocking filter,adjusted the colors,
denoised,contrast & saturation,brightness,etc. Audio is just CAM and has
people laughing in it,so don't expect too much. Enjoy=]
