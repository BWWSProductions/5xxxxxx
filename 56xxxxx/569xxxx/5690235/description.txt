Russell Gray performs the 18 solos on cornet from Arbans `bible`, accompanied by Leyland (arban collection II) & Fodens (arban collection I).

Ive also included the 14 studies as played by Paul Mayes on cornet, accompanied by John Alley on Piano.

"The arban collection Volume 1 featured a Courtois, Arban model cornet from the 1870s owned by Mr Arban himself...volume 2 I chose to record this cd with my new Yamaha Xeno Cornet."

Enjoy :)
