,killalott,2010-07-14T19:21Z,...any feedback appreciated as its my first torrent :)
,pisces681,2011-02-11T04:33Z,"killalott! I would LOVE to have the accompaniments in all 3 speeds uploaded pretty please! I have looked around for them but cannot seem to find just the accompaniment on the internet. At a high bitrate like 256kbps would be amazing.(: And incase he doesn't respond, if anyone else has them, PLEASE upload them! It would be greatly appreciated."
,pisces681,2011-02-11T05:36Z,Or even better.. Would be if you could rip the accompanying cd as FLAC or some other lossless audio codec.(:
