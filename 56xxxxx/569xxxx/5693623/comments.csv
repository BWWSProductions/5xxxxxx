,kiande,2010-07-15T08:18Z,Please help to seed when you are done downloading. And also please make a comment so that others can believe that this torrent actually is real. Thanks :)
,nittany,2010-07-16T06:54Z,HD copy of A-Team already?  What is the source? There is no way this can be a bluray rip or DVD rip already.rnrnI\'m gonna wait for several people to confirm this is real before I spend bandwidth downloading it.
,Torx8,2010-07-16T08:26Z,that picture doesn\'t look like HD.. just because you stretch a movie to 720/1080p doesn\'t make it HDD.. lol..
,icherche,2010-07-16T09:21Z,"V = 10, A = 7nthe real thing 720, doesn\'t seem to be resized, sound obviously from different source, still the video is nice :)nn"
,kiande,2010-07-16T12:14Z,"The movie is ripped by a staff member at a digital cinema in russia. the orginal sound is ripped from another source... so the quality of the picture is optimal.rnrnVideo 10/10rnSound 7/10rnrnThere isnt any better versions out there anyways, what can you expect. I did as best as i could. I got it from a russian private tracker.rnI just wanted to be nice to upload it here. thats it."
,Nidas,2010-07-16T12:19Z,"Looks like DVD-quality to me on a 50\"" plasma. Pretty good dvd-quality, but not 720p.nnAudio is a bit canny and NOT 5.1 or even 2ch DTS. Possibly line.nnVerdict - R5 LinennV: 9 for dvd, 7 for 720pnA: 6"
,Nidas,2010-07-16T12:24Z,"kiande:nnSharing is nice, but you should have written a bit more info, like video source and audio source, channels and quality.nnSome people are more picky, some less, but it\'s nice to have some info to base your choice on.nnHD-rip 720p sounds to most like a blu-ray rip with good quality audio, not like an R5 with crap audio."
,kiande,2010-07-16T12:28Z,"ahh, yes. And because i say ripped from a digital cinema, that does not mean that its filmed on the screen (TS). It?s digitally ripped. And nittany: what picture are you referring too? If you are referring to the poster picture on this site, that was just to have a picture there."
,kiande,2010-07-16T12:30Z,Nidas: sorry about that. I will do that next time. :D
,kiande,2010-07-16T12:35Z,I can get it in perfect audio. but i gues nobody wanna see it in russian :P
,J33SEJ,2010-07-16T13:26Z,Having done my research by checking the user\'s name and seeing as they have been a member for a while and even have good comment\'s posted by a skull certified member on one of there other torrent uploads im going to dl this giving it the benefit of doubt but with a grey area over the catagory it\'s in! rnFrom the sound\'s of this it should be in the regular top 100 movies as an R5 perhaps! Will comment again once dl!

,J33SEJ,2010-07-24T01:28Z,Kiande How's the future looking for an up of inception!???? ;-)
,kiande,2010-07-24T06:40Z,J33SEJ: I have posted a request.. Now we just play the waiting game ;)
,nickthedick,2010-07-29T07:56Z,"And now for an informed opinion:

The quality is mediocre.  It's slightly better than a widescreen DVD rip.  It is not a digital rip.  I'm not sure how they transferred it, but it is NOT full framerate, which makes fight/action scenes a bit of a blur.

There are hard-overlayed Russian subtitles.

The sound is somewhat flat and distorted, but tolerable.

If you want to watch this on your phone, go for it.  If you want to watch it on your flat screen with surround sound in your living room, wait for the blu-ray rip."
