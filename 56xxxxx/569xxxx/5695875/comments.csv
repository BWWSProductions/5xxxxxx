,TheEmpathicEar,2010-07-19T03:07Z,"You might want ""Google"" the process of completely removing AnyDVD? Or, look over the comments posted on other AnyDVD torrents to get some ideas? I never have any trouble with this, but I have seen a lot folks that do."

You have to uninstall AnyDVD, then run Foxkiller v.7 or v.8, which you need to google up. 

Then you may install this ver. of AnyDVD, but do make sure to unplug the Internet and uncheck the auto update box. THEN reboot and reconnect the Internet. 
"
,gio.gemelo,2010-07-21T01:09Z,"I disconnect from the Internet. I use FoxKiller v8 after uninstalling. I installed AnyDVD 6.6.7.0 and nothing, AnyDVD says: Your Trial Period has expired. I search anydvd.chk file in C: \ ProgramData\SlySoft\AnyDVD\anydvd.chk, does not exist."
,gio.gemelo,2010-07-21T04:00Z,"I could register it after with the Key in this torrent  after uninstalling AnyDVD 6.6.7.0 and then I use a file called AnyDVD Registration.msi by EDiT using the option 3, ""remove reg"" that I found in the Internet."
,fredpc,2010-07-25T12:41Z,"Here is my fix...follow it to the letter 

1) Uninstalled the old version of anydvd 
2) Make sure your disconnected from the net
3) Install the new anydvd 
4) If it asks to reboot (do it )
5) When the computer restarts anydvd will load (you will get trial version) now close anydvd 
6) Add the key (which is usually a reg key)
7) Open anydvd and you should have a fully registered version 
8) If you get ""trial expired"" don't worry move on 
9) Do a search for anydvd.chk and delete it or rename it to anydvd.bak.......you will have to enable hidden files and folders the locations are as follows 

for xp the location is:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD\AnyDVD.chk or anydvd.lic

for vista:
C:\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key or anydvd.lic

for windows 7 the location is:
C:\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key or anydvd.lic

10) Now open anydvd you should have a fully registered version while your there go to settings and disable updates 
11) You can now reconnect to the net
12) Enjoy  

ps some of the newer versions are using a anydvd.lic file which can be renamed or deleted

sathanas65..........came up with another option with anydvd.chk file......open with notepad delete entries and save and then right click on anydvd.chk and select properties......then select read only..........this will work as well"
