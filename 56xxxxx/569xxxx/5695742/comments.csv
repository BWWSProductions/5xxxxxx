,skookie5,2010-07-21T03:48Z,"BTW, for anyone who wanted to known, this is in 320 kpbs bit rate (its the best for any who are unaware- use this torrent over the other top one- which I am asuming is far lower via file size). Thanks Uploader!"

,suss2it,2010-11-20T09:06Z,"BTW for all those people that think this is really 320 it's not. They took already leaked version and simply transcoded it to 320. That doesn't increase the quality. If you want proof, add the songs to iTunes and check the ""comments"" ID tag. The other groups' tags are still there."
