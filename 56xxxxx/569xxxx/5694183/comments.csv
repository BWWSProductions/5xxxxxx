Proposition 8 was the straw that broke this camel's back. I am officially an ex-Mormon!"

So you are not religious anymore cause your religion promoted morality?  What a tool."
,lokust167,2010-10-17T03:04Z,"@Run408 - So you need religion to be moral???
What kind of logic is that.I am an atheist and i definitely dont need a religion to be good to other people.No heaven, no hell,no god.
Peace:)"

You believe inequality, judgment and prejudice is moral? Ha, you're the tool! 

PS. Jesus said ""Judge not lest you be judged."" You're only human, you're just the same as everyone else. Don't think you're any better than anyone else because you believe in religion. By judging, you're doing the opposite of what god wanted. Last laugh's on you mate. "
