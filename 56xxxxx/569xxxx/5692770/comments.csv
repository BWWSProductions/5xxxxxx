WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO SEED A LITTLE OF WHAT YOU CONSUME.

,johne86,2011-02-27T23:24Z,I do not care for the resolution it in my opinion reduces the quality. My suggestion to anyone who wants superor quality download this one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5286737/Die.Hard.Quadrilogy.720p.BluRay.x264-VERSATiLE or hell if you think it's too big try this one; http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5019375/Die_Hard_Box_Set_BDRip_H264_5.1_ch-SecretMyth_(Kingdom-Release)
