JOHNNY THUNDERS : VOLUME 11 Â PARIS DAZE & NIGHTS

MPEG-2 720x480 NTSC 4:3 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
1) WITH PATTY PALADIN @LA PALAIS, PARIS FRANCE, 1984 Â  Â 
Patty jumps on stage to do a number with Johnny, Very rare Â  Â 
and classic. The quality is very good but the sound does cut out for a Â  Â 
couple of minutes. VERY RARE Â  Â  Â  
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
2) GIBUS CLUB, PARIS FRANCE, 1989 Â  Â  Â  
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
The infamous acoustic show where Johnny is really in a bad way. Â  Â 
The footage even has backstage film of Johnny so out of it he Â  Â 
has trouble lighting his cigarette. Johnny even starts a fight with an Â  Â 
audience member. This is a longer and more complete cut of this Â  Â 
than was on a previous volume. Â  Â  Â  
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
3) JOHNNY THUNDERS AND THE ODDBALLS, @ GIBUS CLUB, PARIS FRANCE, 3-11-1989 Â 
A great performance. Johnny Does a full set and ROCKS. If you watch Â  Â 
the acoustic show from the same year you wont believe the it was shot Â  
during the same era.

Have fun!
