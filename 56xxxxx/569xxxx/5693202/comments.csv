,a1adin,2010-07-16T21:10Z,"Does this skidrow work?rnA lot of people on the net say that you can not control all the aircraft, you can only watch.rnrnPlease verify."
,a1adin,2010-07-16T21:22Z,a lot of people on other forum say that skidrow version does not work. nYou can not control the aircrafts. nYou can only watch. nPlease verify.n
,spoutnik0,2010-07-16T22:08Z,I confirm. Cannot gain control on a plane. Alt-J not working. It seems that the developers have included cracking protection mecanism.
,vacaap,2010-07-16T22:24Z,"I too confirm that!!! nnThough it works with the crack (\""bin\"" folder) folder from the ARTiSTs version after the update!"
,a1adin,2010-07-16T22:59Z,how about TPTB version v1.2.1? Does it work?
,spoutnik0,2010-07-16T23:29Z,ARTIST version ??
,vacaap,2010-07-16T23:31Z,"yes, ARTiST version found on this site"
,spoutnik0,2010-07-17T00:09Z,ok thanks. but it seems that it\'s 1.2 not 1.2.1
,a1adin,2010-07-17T05:41Z,"v1.2.1 is TPTB version, not ARTIST. Also found on this site"
,vacaap,2010-07-17T11:30Z,"I installed the SKIDROW version and applied the SKIDROW update 1.2.1 then copy the crack (\""bin\"" folder) from the ARTiST version and it works really great!"
,spoutnik0,2010-07-17T13:15Z,Thanks Vacaap. when you open mission editor->menu->help->about what is the version displayed ?
,vacaap,2010-07-17T14:16Z,"@spoutnik0 : tried that, the version displayed is 1.2.1"

,Skyrat70,2010-07-21T02:29Z,"Hey, just ran down (ok it's like 65 miles round trip) to Best Buy and picked-up Lock-On Platinum for $19.99.  Hard to justify all these headaches with cracks and such now that it's out in retail stores, and at such a good price.  Of course I only can speak for US stores."
,fenriir,2010-07-24T15:36Z,"i got same problem
if you only installed the game and updated to 1.2.1
and you use crack from skidrow. 
you can go multyplayer but not getting control of plane. you also see a full list of servers.
