First torrent attempt=fail
Hopfully I can now properly seed the torrent.

     This is the raw Japanese game from the popular manga/anime, Bleach. The game Bleach: Versus Crusade, is a direct prequel from its brother, Bleach: Shattered Blade (which is currently available in America (English)).

     The game itself is AMAZING! Its suprisingly close to where the anime/manga is currently and supplies a great story and variaty of characters.

     It works very well on DVD+R\'s (not quite sure about DVD-R\'s). And if you are using this on a Wii with Backup loader, you may experience a blue screen with the Error 002 when you try to play. No worries! Just install this using the WAD Manager in Homebrew:

It should work like a charm!

Comments welcome for this is my first upload!

Thanks!

P.S.
Considering that not everyone knows Japanese, I have found a rough translation of the Menu:

MAIN MENU

Versus
Training/Practice/Tutorial

Urahara Shoten/Usrahara Shop
Extras (Figurines, sound test, pictures etc)

Along with the translation came some helpful gmae controls:

Swing the wiimote and you can fight with the zanpaktou, hakuda (hand-to-hand), or whatever doesnt use the reiatsu.

A is to use a special. A+Z creates a super special.

B is to use another special. Adding Z (B+Z) Creates a super special as well.

C is Shunpo or Sonido. If you stand still and hit \'C\' you will be launched in the air; to stay in the air you have to keep shadow stepping.

Z doesnt do anything that I am aware of other than when you combine with A and B.

The D pad: up is to switch characters on your team,
           down is to get help from your team mate,
           left and right are basically the same thing as down.

+ is pause
- doesnt do anything

1 and 2: A+2 is like A+Z and it will give you the same effect.

To use bankai when your green meter reaches full, hold Z and shake the nunchuck down and they will use bankai or whatever they use.


So that is how you play Bleach Versus Crusade. Hope you all found this helpful!
