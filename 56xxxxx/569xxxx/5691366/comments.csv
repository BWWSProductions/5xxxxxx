,MisterDB,2010-07-15T05:07Z,"TDK213 - I\'m sorry I don\'t have access to that episode of After The Catch.nnNor do I have access to a better quality (HD) signal to source from.  nnI do hope that some will find it useful, even though both the video and the audio are compressed to a higher degree than some other uploads.nnPerhaps the smaller file size will be worth it.nnI hope you are able to find that episode you are looking for. :)"
