And here's part 100! Many thanks to Brad for great rip of Q-Feel record. Also thanks to Edward for contributing to some of the records I posted in this series.

Now we have some great stuff in here, awesome power pop/new wave record from Fay Ray, great dancepop/synthpop music from Q-Feel and brilliant new wave record from the Aussie's The Venetians which is hard to come by. Now some info on Shock Headed Peters. Appearing (and remaining) as a bit of a mystery in the UK in the mid eighties, the Peter's main man and grey eminence, Karl Blake(Ex. Lemon Kittens) was then enthusing about Black Sabbath and Vanilla Fudge in interviews. This was, at that time, about the most unfashionable thing you could do. Blake's mannered and very English vocals fit oddly with the early hard rock sound at the core of this project. It's a bit like T.S. Elliot fronting Steppenwolf. Add finely judged classical orchestration and sinister, if deeply obscure, lyrics and the result is a unique and unforgettable sense of disorientation. 

Anyone interested in early English Goth and industrial music should definitely give this a listen. The Peters were contemporary with those movements, although never a part of them, and they beat most of their representatives for atmosphere hands down.
