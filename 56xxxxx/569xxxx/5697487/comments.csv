,rtrifunov,2010-07-17T18:10Z,Congratulations 80z for the 100th issue of the rare 80s albums series. You gave considerable effort uploading rare gems and you should know that it is appreciated. Please don\'t stop with the good work. Cheers
,Maxpayne33,2010-07-17T21:19Z,YES!  Congrats on your 100th DL!  I was also a DJ and Music Director from 1979 - 1987 (Minnesota) and I can say you have unearthed GEMS!  There are TWO that I once owned but lost in the shuffle.  Gary Myrick & the Figures and The Producers 1st LP.  I always look 4 them and I see trax but not the LPs.  PLEASE Upload for a Lifelong Fan!!   I and Future Generations THANK YOU!
