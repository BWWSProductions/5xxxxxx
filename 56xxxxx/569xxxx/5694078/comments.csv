,paddy0099,2010-09-18T16:52Z,what?  this seems to go to some toolbar download?
,Blushiftr,2010-09-22T05:04Z,paddy0099 - I think you may have clicked the wrong 'Download' link. Make sure to click the one that has two arrows and says 'Download this Torrent'. The others are advertisements for other products (such as a toolbar)

,fuckcunt,2011-04-29T01:35Z,"So this page say ""Texted language(s):
English"" but just slightly later it says Subtitles Korean... Fail..."
,SergeantSpoon,2011-05-09T11:37Z,"Downloaded is finaly completed, a nice 500 kb/s. 

Quality is really nice, certainly 9.5/10.0. But the size of the episodes are a bit on the big side. 2.3 GB an episode. 

If you have a lot of free Harddisk space, you should really download this. Subtitles are included. Although they are a bit messed up in the first season, played with VLC. 

Thanks for uploading this massive Torrent! For a die hard Dexter fan, I thank you. This is a really good collection piece for my external harddisk. "
,ej00262,2011-06-16T18:54Z,My average up is three times that of my down.. Been download for 24 hours now and barely topped 3 GB. I'm capping my up at >50kbps if no other seeders will help
