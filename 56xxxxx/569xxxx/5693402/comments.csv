,maotao11,2010-08-23T03:10Z,wow 720p pretty good when i download it il post how good actually the quallity is
,jbwzrd213,2010-08-25T20:00Z,"The video quality is slightly compressed to the point where it's noticeable.
All the voices play mostly through the left speaker whereas the music plays through the right. It leaves for a weird experience. when you're watching it.

Besides those two points, this torrent is golden. =)"
,ShadyMase,2010-09-17T11:17Z,"Get Ojosoft Total Video Converter. Maybe converting from MP4 will fix the compression and the audio problem.

Should have left it in Blue-Ray"
,Basher_101,2010-09-22T12:49Z,Convert mp4 to what...? :S
,saiy2k,2010-11-08T17:30Z,nice film.. thx for de up :)
,yopepoy,2010-11-14T17:36Z,"mp4 and mkv is the best container for blu ray.
mkv is much smaller than mp4.
but mp4 is ready for apple tv.
and xvid avi really sucks for blu ray!"
,ObsidianSorceron,2011-02-17T06:29Z,I downloaded it but have NO idea how to play it.. What am I doing wrong? please help? It wont play in WMA or anything and I miss this movie. Could someone PLEASE help me?
,dmovieman,2011-02-26T02:35Z,"@obsideonsorceron
Download VLC player, it plays just about everything you can throw at it."
,Ninja_Inferis,2011-03-03T11:04Z,Excellent Download. Great quality and Excellent Download Speed. +1 from me!
,phillyblunt23,2011-03-13T22:28Z,i just watched the original before this and said fuck it and watched this one RIGHT after... OMG there is a HUGE difference in the quality of the movie not to mention all the shit that was added to this one... i love it... during and after the fight with sephiroth it was way longer in this one and when he got his face cut in the one it stayed with him during the rest of these scenes with kadaj (not sure if i spelt it right but w/e) but in the original it wasnt there because sephiroth didnt hit cloud like that. and the scene with zack... too cool... just got finished with crisis core a couple days ago and almost on the 2nd disk of FF7 for my psp... oh the nostalgia is great... anyways AMAZING torrent... i give it 12 stars lol 
,eivelice,2011-04-13T12:00Z,"it plays and file format is mp4, but it cannot be sync to ipod or iphone, also it cannot be converted by7 total video converter or winx hd video converter. so it can only be played by a computer with codecs, anyone knows what converter can i use for this?"
,mina_saleh,2011-04-29T09:18Z,for eivelice you can use (format factory) it worked for me

,Darth_AJ,2011-09-10T19:29Z,"agree with jbwzrd213, awesome up but the sound of voices coming from left speaker and music from right is kind of weird.

I love it anyway!"
,sixor,2012-02-06T04:34Z,"works ok, the vid could have been better, the english sucks, japanese is a lot better"
,tall70,2012-05-28T00:51Z,"Audio voice is not just coming from one side, but all other sounds stereo is backwards. Person walking from left to right has audio from right to left, ohh. Ok thanks for effort, but i'm getting something else."
