I\'ve read over two dozen books about the CIA, and I\'m born and raised in DC.  None of their premises are realistic, even slightly.nnWhat is the agenda?  To convince people that having the CIA operate inside the country, outside the constitution, is going to make us safe?  That it\'s okay?  That it\'s acceptable if the people don\'t look or talk like us uneducated blue collar fools?nnI mean, really?  This pilot is so fucked, you would think the writers would try harder, but they must assume that the viewer is even more ignorant of intelligence agencies and the geography of DC, and our constitution and the principles of a democratic society, than they are.nnThe writers of this show must either live in LA or NYC.  They probably dreamed up all of these scenarios based on the agenda they are paid to portray in a positive light, like, oh, I don\'t know, domestic CIA activity, which has always been outside their mandate and even legislated against, because we are a democratic society ruled by a constitution.  nnIt seems like there are many political or corporate entities or interests who despise the constraints of the constitution.  They will deny that they are anti-democracy, or anti-US-Constitution, but none of those things work in their favor, so they secretly HATE it, and want to encourage everyone else to abandon our principles in exchange for their hyper-profitability and extreme control over markets, people, resources, etc.nnThis series is actually making me question all of USA Network\'s shows.  Royal Pains?  I guess I\'m supposed to accept that the royally rich god annointed wealthy were chosen by god to have a lot of money, get special medical care, and live in really large mansions.  Because god said so.nnI suppose this new series wants us to accept the CIA operating inside US borders.  Even though they\'ve never had any official, publicized authority to do so.  Even though they\'ve always had a secret mandate, never before admitted, always denied, to do nefarious things, shady activities, against US citizens.nnThis is yet another example of how the various interests and powers use our media to manipulate public thought."
,Jankavkee,2010-07-14T18:13Z,"@PhilLesh: they make \""crap\"" like this because no one could stand to watch a show about people like you...if you\'re the real deal, that is. There\'s a reason why TV is called entertainment, dude...time to leave DC"

,varilthes,2010-07-17T18:52Z,"@ the enigmatic PhilLesh12-nnBecause an organization based in gathering Intelligence would obviously omit its on land from those sources of intelligence and then tell the entire world of their intentions because secrecy in gathering intelligence is unnecessary of course.nnIm sorry Phil but your laughable attempts and discrediting a show seem to lack direction and intelligence. Maybe if the CIA were to assist you next time you write a \""Speech\"" Comment you\'d fair better. Oh wait i forgot they do not operate on American soil LMAO!!!!!!!!! nnIts viewers like you that make this show possible."

,tclaw1984,2010-09-17T10:42Z,"wow phil- are we to believe that secret islands crash airplanes and have shape shifting black smoke living on them? Are we to believe that a suave man named Bond, James Bond changes his appearance every ten years but somehow manages to remain a youthful agent of the British government who manages to constantly get himself involved in issues way out of their jurisdiction? Are we to believe that a talking robot was left behind to clean up Earth and discovers a plant? Are we to believe alice really fell into wonderland? DUDE ITS %$@&ing ENTERTAINMENT. You need to seriously have your fracking head examined. Thats right ahole, i managed another tv reference."
