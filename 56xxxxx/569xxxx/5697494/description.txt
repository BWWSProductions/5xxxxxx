[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
This time we re done the video, and lowered the orange more, but not over because their is some dark and some other
scenes which didn't look so orange :hmmm: so...anyway so tweaked the saturation, added low denoise, a touch of sharpness
and then changed the rgb colours, we actually started doing this one last night..send audio to locke to sync but he got
drunk so...we used imagines thanks;)...once again tried to keep under a gig and keep a decent bitrate...the line audio
don't seem to be the best but it's better than the cam :)..Sorry on delay others things came up
