That way it gets out sooner, as I can upload to 2-3 people at a time a lot quicker then I can to 10 at a time, and its more important to get the full upload out quickly to a few people who can send it to many imo. peace and enjoy."
,RS232C,2010-07-17T18:28Z,"I\'m going offline in a few. I\'ll be periodically return to seed though, so no need to give up. This torrent is going to need others to help seed it, and not just disconnect when you have it. I only have a upload of 100Kb/s"
,ioannisarc,2010-07-17T19:09Z,Thank you very much.
,RS232C,2010-07-23T22:20Z,"Just so everyone knows, it appear everyone getting this is bailing on seeding it for others, but I will periodically return to seeding my torrents for at least a week or so. beyond that it'll be hit or miss, and the community will have to help each other...as it should. There are far more then whats listed on the tracker helping and receiving.  "
,Up-loader,2011-02-03T15:32Z,"Hey there RS232C,

I think the minimum that we could do to help ppl share stuff is seed their torrents after the download completes. Besides, I love to play Guitars! This is one of the Torrents that I will seed as long as possible to help ppl out, obviously once the download completes.. :)"
,RS232C,2011-05-09T16:25Z,"I agree up-loader, you honor peer to peer, and thus ensure its future."
,RS232C,2011-10-16T00:20Z,if y'all are interested here is another upload of mine: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5698230/Guitar_cord_Bible
