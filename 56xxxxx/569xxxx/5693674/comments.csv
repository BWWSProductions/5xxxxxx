,Tamarind777,2010-07-31T04:56Z,"Mr. Duh-kins is perhaps the most incapable ""Biologist"" there is. I can't believe this bloke has a PhD. When you listen to him, all he spews is his religious beliefs and no science at all. He uses philosophical arguments to explain every bit of his science, which is so dumb."

Dawkins is so cool!"

,ossielmais,2010-12-21T13:56Z,"I agree, the way he uses his philosophy just ruins it - especially with his bizzar theories... for example he says that electrons travel all around the universe (in a circle) to be able to react with the OTHER side of the electron it was bonded to in the first place. I understand if you find this confusing... I do as well. 
But thank you for UL."
