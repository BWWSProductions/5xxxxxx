,Exitman13,2010-08-18T09:30Z,NOT new movie...this is the first movie...new movie is called Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang
,braumabull76,2010-08-20T16:18Z,"To all who are not familliar with the titles of this film it is only called The Big Bang in the U.K. and Europe only. Here in the US the movie is called Nanny Mcphee Returns. Having said that, this is the real thing considering the fact that this movie came out in thee U.K. on March 19, 2010. In the U.K. this movie came out on DVD and Blu ray on July 19, 2010. So CHEERS TO THE UPLOADER FOR A FINE JOB and STOP LEAVING THE WRONG COMMENTS.
