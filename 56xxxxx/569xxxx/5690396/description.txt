                    Adult multi-species puppet comedy about five  
                    animals who hang out in the back yard of an  
                    inner city pub - metrosexual fox Nelson;  
                    pedigree It-bitch Destiny; wannabe tomcat  
                    Marion; cynical pigeon Kali; and sociopath  
                    Vince. Nelson visits a petting zoo, where he  
                    discovers that getting a stroke isn't always a  
                    pleasant experience. Marion saves a child from  
                    drowning, but Destiny dupes him out of his  
                    chance to win an Animal of Courage award. Kali  
                    falls for a muscular crow that turns out to be  
                    female.
