      In Undercover Boss high flying business executives leave the
      comfort of their corner offices to go on an undercover mission
      to examine the inner workings of their company. With the US
      version of the show a huge hit in America recently, six more
      British bosses take on the challenge. The first film of the
      series follows David Clarke. David has been Chief Executive of
      Best Western since 2005. He's a stickler for perfection, always
      looking for ways to better the brand, and has been the driving
      force behind several Best Western community and charity
      projects. David spends five days undercover as new recruit 'Andy
      Green', and his discoveries are mixed.
