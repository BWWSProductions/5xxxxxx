,johnnyangus,2010-07-16T23:00Z,doesnt anyone have a version thats not half cropped ffs?????
,johnnyf1ve,2010-07-17T08:09Z,"Ok if you guys can\'t get videos to play on your PS3 I\'ll tell you how to do it correctly: Share a folder in windows and simply go to network and sharing center>>File/Media sharing = ON. Load your PS3, WHAT!? OMFG I HAVE A MEDIA SERVER!?!?!?!? lol... Congratulations you now don\'t need to burn transfer or do anything with your video files. Just share them on your network, and use your windows media server on your PS3. I watch everything this way at home."
,steven4,2010-07-24T05:50Z,thanx.......
,cpr05e,2010-07-25T01:54Z,"besides the fat headed curly haired woman that couldnt keep her unusually large melon out of the way of the camera, the camera only covered about 2/3's of the screen. And im not sure how many times it happened but there were certain parts that didnt make sense because they were not included in this d/l. I only really noticed at the end that there had to have been at least 10 minutes of the movie cut out. "
,johnnyangus,2010-07-26T19:17Z,holy fuk god damn shit crap...doesnt anyone have a version that not cropped to shit and is the whole movie.....btw uploaders...u dont have to cut the shit out of the movie..im sure we have all watched crap uploads and r really not that fussy overall...as long as it clear and audio is understandable u dont have to do nething...just fyi

,ccima,2010-08-16T00:32Z,"Don't waste you time downloading!!!!!
Worst torrent of all time!
The audio is horrible and almost half of the screen is missing!"
,Blast89,2010-08-18T08:57Z,"Some of the screen is missing, and there's a gap toward the end. Watchable for a cam though, and it works."
,philfromwpg,2010-09-12T06:37Z,Just finished reloading my computer from this trojan! Stay away!
,sabunimwil,2010-09-19T20:09Z,"ccima
Did you even bother to read the comments from the author of this torrent? I guess not. Just be thankful that it's free and move on. Unless you can do better that is."
,antoonb,2010-10-18T09:01Z,Sorry to say but a shit quality on this movie. Wait for a proper dvd rip.
,B.Genaaid,2010-10-30T21:27Z,"Seeing comment with ""Trojan inside"" makes me wonder how many stupid idiots there are on the net that actually use their main PC to download material which has the possibility of containing a virus? Be smart.. use another and use Linux Ubuntu, run (if you want for your bit torrent client) WinXP in virtual box (like in Win7) and before you start downloading, make a snapshot (function similair to restore point in XP) of your system... Use a good Firewall to see what traffic is generated by what program so you can see if there really is a virus ... or tracker... and for playing will VLC almost play everything.
If you get a virus, disconnect... remove virus (from sandbox) and reload snapshot. 2 minutes work... reconnect and start downloading what you want (may:))
Oh and for the ones posting the virus warning.. 9 out of 10 in order of some movie company LOL as if..."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-02T15:47Z,DELETE this.  Wasting peoples time.
