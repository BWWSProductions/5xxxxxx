Man you are annoying!! Like you are any better, you genocide supporting piece of shit! Go f*ck a camel, and go someplace that people want to hear your hate propaganda. EAT SHIT AND DIE!

,acdoja420,2010-07-21T00:09Z,"I look at the comments to find quality etc.  I have never entered a comment myself, but I feel I have to after reading these comments.  For everyone, don't even humor this obviously ignorant and racist individual. Really, his name is israelis_r_pigs should tell you right there he has a problem.  I've never seen comments like that before while trying to watch a movie.  Don't even give him the time, but to you that already have, I hear you. Hopefully this will be the first and last comment I ever post.  
Thanks to raymond and all else here"
,bookman451,2010-07-25T15:49Z,"Hi bit of a noob regarding subs. How do I get them to work.
Can I input, say withvso  convert x to dvd, to
play on a dvd"
,evilbrian69,2010-08-12T03:21Z,"bookman451 - firstly, the subs file needs to be EXACTLY the same name as the movie file, but with the srt extension at the end.

Put both the movie file and the srt file in the same folder, if they're not there already.

Then use ConvertxtoDVD to make your dvd and the subs will be automatically included on the DVD.

Enjoy!"
