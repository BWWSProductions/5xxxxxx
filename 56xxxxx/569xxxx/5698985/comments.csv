,picmagic,2010-07-21T13:19Z,When download complete can anyone tell me if i need to change any settings on img burn to write. I know it has to be booktyped as a dvd-rom and writen at 2.4 but any other settings to change? i have tried a few discs now in my 2003 s60 that don't work. I am writing to veb dvd+r dl which should work and my old original disc works fine. thanks for any advice.

,rsmartins,2010-12-11T12:31Z,"These instructions are missing the basic: this file is an image file. Most people fail to suceed because they simply burn the files into the DVD, which of course is not recognised by the Volvo navteq system.

For the sake of clarity, here goes detailed instructions:

- Open Imgburn
- Choose option ""Write image file to disc""
- Select the mds file as source file
- Choose 2,4x write speed
- Burn to any DVD Double Layer (8.5Gb)

Now Volvo Navteq should be able to read it."
