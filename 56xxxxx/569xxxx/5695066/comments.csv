,Rewt528491,2010-07-18T09:17Z,"Just google for ""Free WMA MP3 Converter"" and convert the flac's to 320kbps lossy mp3 format yourself...

Don't mean to be rude but seriously just google it...

Almost all MP3 players support flac format anyway. Zune does, iPod and iPhone do, and so does Sansa mp3 players."

and others.  FLAC kicks ass!  It's lossless, so what you'd get in a huge WAV or AU file, you get in a compressed and DRM-free and FOSS format.  There are many many many converters for FLAC to MP3 or whatever you want.  Just look up ""FLAC"" on Wikipedia.  Nice up, drawdevm2000!  Thanks!"
