Superman Returns was released in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio which means that, no matter what, there is going to be black bars above and below the image.  That is how the movie is encoded.  The person behind this torrent simply removed those black bars when encoding this release.

You should take 2 seconds to conduct a Google search before you try to shit all over something free."
