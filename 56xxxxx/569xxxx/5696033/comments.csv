With great power, there must also come great responsibility - and when those in power abuse it, it's the people's responsibility to remove them. The year is 1933, and New York City is not-so-secretly run by corrupt politicians, crooked cops, big businesses - and suave gangland bosses like New York's worst, the Goblin. But when a fateful spider-bite gives the young rabble-rouser Peter Parker the power to fight the mobster who killed his Uncle Ben, will even that be enough?

Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Face
Peter Parker has a lot to be hopeful about. The Spider-Man is the beloved town hero; President Franklin D. Roosevelt is in the White House; the spiraling economy is on its first steps toward recovery; and with Norman Osborn out of the picture, organized crime in New York has lost its major player. But all is not well in 1934 America - dark forces are at play in the world, and a power vacuum in New York crime is quickly - and violently - being filled! Now Spider-Man must contend with a vicious new breed of killers, criminals, and maniacal death-dealers, reimagined from some of the greatest and deadliest foes of the Spider-Man! "

Spin-off one-shot from X-Men Noir: Mark of Cain.

Wolverine Noir
The Bowery, 1937. Jim Logan, the fiercest knife expert in New York, runs a seedy detective agency called ""Logan & Logan""...along with his useless, halfwit brother, Dog. They're the best at what they do. But when a swanky dame named Mariko Yashida struts into the office, she opens up a world of hurt for Logan, forcing him to revisit his painful, bloody past. 

X-Men Noir
Peter Magnus is a rookie cop on the beat, unable to outrace the shadow cast by his big-shot cop father. His sister, Wanda, is a socialite in deep ten large to Creole Club proprietor Remy LeBeau - the kind of debt she'll be lucky to pay back with just cash. Their father, Eric Magnus, is chief of detectives, corrupting the Brotherhood of New York's Finest from the inside out.  And Xavier? That discredited shrink sits in a jail cell, wondering what in the world his little refugees from the 'Xavier School for Exceptionally Wayward Youth' are up to now. Other than staying one step ahead of Magnus, that is. But now Jean Grey is dead. And nobody is allowed to care - nobody that counts - because who cares about one of Xavier's dead grifters? It's not like there's an angel out there looking out for what's right. Or is there?

X-Men Noir: Mark of Cain
Thomas Halloway and the surviving X-Men have traveled across the world to Madripoor, where they've put their skills to use as treasure hunters. Their target - the elusive and very valuable Crimson Gem of Cyttorak."
