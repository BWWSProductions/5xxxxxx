If you like your celebrities devastatingly lampooned and brilliantly 
skewered, Kevin Bishop hits the mark (and the Brad and the Gok) over 
and over again in the return of his breakneck-paced series.

The high-speed dash through the channels takes in anything from David, 
the new Mitchell brother in PeepEnders ; Michael Macintyre Undercover 
to Billie Piper's next project, Diary Of A Call Centre Girl and a 
British High School Musical.
Simon Cowell, Harry Hill, Brad & Angelina, Cheryl Cole, Katy Perry 
all get the merciless treatment and there's Pointless
Movie Prequels and other Daily Mail giveaway DVDs; Parkinson/Emu, 
Best/Wogan in a Frost/Nixon remake style and hilarious ads for Piii 
games such as Free Paper Giver Outer.

Lily Allen, Heston Blumenthal, Katie Price, Derren Brown (well, 
his taxi-driving brother, Darren) - No one is safe from Kevin and 
the gang's brilliant p-taking scattergun.
