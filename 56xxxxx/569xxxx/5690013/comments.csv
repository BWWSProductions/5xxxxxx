,omegafox84,2010-07-17T10:54Z,@ctang: what was with all that software upped yesterday? i had started to download one of them but my antivirus scanners detected malware & whatnot.  i\'m assuming someone else got on your account or something?
[T],ctang,2010-07-17T18:52Z,those definitely weren\'t from me...i deleted them as soon as i saw them
[T],ctang,2010-07-17T19:12Z,i will upload software occasionally but they will have an actual description...wont just say download this
[T],ctang,2010-07-17T21:43Z,agentbay: i changed it when this happened...i really dont know whats up with mikemelo...im thinking maybe that he doesnt know what email account he has linked to tpb and cant recover his password...i havent had contact with him for about a week or so now so i really dont know whats up with him...i suggested on his most recent torrent to create a new account and leave a comment letting people know whats up
