To the guy who requested Reluctant Stereotypes. I thought I had sold this lp but it was in great shape gathering dust on the shelf. Enjoy it if you're still around. Also listening to it again after many years, I kind of like it more now. For those unfamiliar with this band, the line-up was Paul King (vocals), Paul Sampson (guitar), Steve Edgson (clarinet), Tony Wall (bass), Colin Heanes (drums). Yes you guess it right. That's Paul King of the 80s band, "King".
