         A scientist discovers footage on his security camera that     
         even he can't explain a sailing ship from the 1800's is       
         home to a ghostly crew; 19th-century slaves who tried to      
         escape on the underground railroad still use a country        
         house as a hiding place the spirit of a jilted bride          
         haunts the hotel where she plunged to her death; and a        
         shopkeeper is terrified by the entities in his basement,      
          which was once a morgue in the Wild West.
