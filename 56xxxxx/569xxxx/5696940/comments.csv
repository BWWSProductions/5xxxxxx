,Spitven0m,2010-07-24T22:34Z,"Thanks for this upload i was put off by the lack of comments and i thought this album might be poor because of the released songs but after hearing it i am really liking it its just as good as his earlier stuff, i was'nt even gunna download it but now ive heard it i am buying it :D"
,obistefkenobi,2010-07-28T17:05Z,"llcooljono123, ishywozere makes a very valid and good point. Even if it's a legit torrent it still does seem very dodgy. So I suggest you shut the fuck up and learn some mannors before you comment again. Thanks."
,tippeetom,2010-07-29T09:19Z,thnks man nice up
,-R3ap3R-,2010-08-11T22:55Z,Why the fuck has this loser got an album ... this is proof that music is shite these dayz ... 
,boyetronic,2010-08-13T14:14Z,"thanks for this amazing torrent!
also, if you notice that there are over 500 others seeding, that is generally the sign of a good torrent."

,kamieakamasha,2010-10-23T20:26Z,his voice sounds to me like Dappy's from N-Dubz? does anyone know why? lol
,Droidboi,2010-11-06T19:58Z,"@ishy & obistef - If it's got good seed2leech ratio then it's good, nobody shares s***.  @kamie - it's coz Dappy copied him all over the shop, N-Dubs are nothing but a chart artist!  And, finally, @-R3ap3R- Shut the fuck up, you obviously know nothing of his skills or history so just, please, go back to your pissy little Fiddycent and the talentless maestro Lil' Wayne...  If you gotta hate, don't do it here, we have better things to worry about than children with no idea.  Now begone."
