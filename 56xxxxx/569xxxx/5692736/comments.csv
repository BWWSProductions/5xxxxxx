,sunbleached,2010-07-15T08:24Z,@jolangel1 - please don\'t post links to irrelevant crap under the torrent comments. Do I want Bangaladesh songs or wallpaper? No. Thanks for wasting my time.
,sunbleached,2010-07-18T03:51Z,"you need a modded xbox 360 first. Hopefully you have that already. Then yes, you need to burn to a dual layer disk. Most people it seems, myself included, use Verbatim. I have sometimes used other dual layer discs, and 2 failed the burn process.  I personally use imgburn to burn the discs - because its free, and because you can easily set the layer break to 1913760, which you HAVE to do [change it in the write settings]. Some people say that since this value is set in the .dvd file, you don\'t have to.....I wouldn\'t know, Ive never tried just to be safe. Anyhow you can easily find many guides by GOOGLEing \""how to burn xbox 360 game with imgburn\"". There is a very good guide at forums.xbox-scene with screenshots you can easily follow."

,nincow,2010-07-29T02:41Z,"Doesn't work. At least on my end. Tried a single layer DVD+R (due to the file size) and a dual layer verbatim with no luck. Used imgburn and used the proper layer break (there's only one as far as I know). The latter yields a dirty disc message, which can't be true given the system is new, the media is new, and all my other originals and backups (with the same media) work just fine. 

Two coasters, no Death Smiles. Doh. "
