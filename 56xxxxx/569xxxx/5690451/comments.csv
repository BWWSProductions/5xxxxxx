,RJX1979,2012-03-10T14:22Z,"I'm not too happy with this torrent, A is good, V is good but for some reason every episode, be it in VLC or WMP, freezes once or twice for about 30 seconds. Every episode! This is annoying since you miss parts of the show.

I don't know if this a problem on my PC but I've never had this before with any other video files so I thought I'd just drop it here, since I think it's torrent-related.

So good torrent, but low on anti-freeze..."
,RJX1979,2012-03-10T14:31Z,"forget what I wrote before, I just noticed my torrent wasn't finished yet...

Yes, that is stupid.
