[T],mrgspott,2010-07-16T16:00Z,"that video player is a suggestion. if your machine carries the correct codecs any media player will do. and on a side note, you have kids and still talk like that? ashame"
,SSfrostic,2010-07-17T02:24Z,omg your trusted and upload a movie that is missing half of it? lol your torrent is a disgrace!!!
,Posterus_Vis,2010-07-19T05:51Z,Wow. VLC is a really great media player. Or Media Player Classic. Both of them shit all over WMP.
,gorian,2010-08-02T07:29Z,I'm all for hating people who make you download media players... but we're talking about VLC here. If that isn't one of your standard media players you're using something crap.
,toulin2003,2010-08-03T22:14Z,mrgspott keep up the good work and don't listen to the idiots that complain about how crap this and that is. if they want a better copy then they should just wait until the dvd comes out or go watch at the movies and pay 15 dollars a pop. if it wasn't for people like mrgspott for doing this then there would be peer to peer sharing at all. so much thanks even though the video source is a low quality and i know you tried your best to make it better.
