Hey Nicholas Sparks fans! If you love The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, Dear John or any of his other tear-jerker books, then you'll love this one I found from a new writer called Jeff Rivera.  Don't let the first few pages fool you, it's not a ghetto book. You're going to love it and cry at the end just like I did.
