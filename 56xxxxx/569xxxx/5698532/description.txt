Storyline:Danny Wright has bad luck: his only child has died, he's lost his job, his wife may be losing faith in him, and a tree has just fallen through his kitchen. But he's a gee-whiz optimist, on his way to Mexico City to pitch a deal. When complications arise, he has to stay a few days, and his path criss-crosses that of Julian Noble, a burned-out executioner (don't call him a hit man, he facilitates fatalities) who constantly drinks, smokes, and chases women of all ages. They chat at a bar, Julian is offensive; they spend the day at the bullfights, Julian asks for help with a killing. Danny is repelled and entertained. Where can this relationship go?
