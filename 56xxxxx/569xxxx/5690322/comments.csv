,simonsays15,2010-07-28T03:45Z,"Hello, works fine :) but could you re upload with an English version too?"
,Albertorayman,2010-08-02T17:57Z,Keygen is trojan
,hombero,2010-09-01T06:14Z,"FIX FOR ENGLISH:

1) Open the downloaded folder,
2) Open the ""payloads"" folder,
3) Open setup.xml in notepad,
4) Below the line ""fr_CA""
ADD: "" en_US ""
(without the quotes)
5) Save the file and exit notepad
6) Run the setup.exe file as before
7) Enter generated serial key from the keygen
8) Follow the install process and done!

I tested this, and everything seems to work as it should,
Thanks DeGun for the torrent!

,jasongrey88,2011-03-08T15:17Z,hey guys can you help me?.... will this also work with 32 bit?.... and why is this 2 gig?... flash pro cs5 is like 8++ mb only right?... I only need to get flash pro cs5 for my project and its really important... and my internet isnt that fast and wouldn't be able to download 2 gig... (because of limited data per month) what files can omit but would still be able to get flash pro and make it work?
,maxgamble,2011-03-10T21:00Z,"jasongrey88: it should work with 32 bit. idk about the rest of your post.

@DeGun, or anyone that can help, I'm having a few issues. One is that it keeps telling me that the serial I'm putting in (from the keygen) is invalid. I've tried a couple, idk if the last one I put in worked or not.

But my main problem is that I don't know how to do the cracks or anything. There's a shit ton of folders and files in the download, I can't find anywhere in the folder I installed Adobe in for them to go, and I don't see instructions on what to do anywhere in the download. What do I do for the cracks? Which files/folders contain cracks?"
,NrutoVmpy,2011-06-12T20:39Z," ~      Help please      ~

Patching the file doesn't work for me. I tried manually adding the 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com line at the end and saving the file but it says I need administrator privileges. Which doesn't make any sense to me because I AM the administrator to this computer.... 

Someone help me, this is getting me extremely frustrated. I almost considered BUYING CS5 because it bothered me so much :'(!"
,uthappam,2011-07-03T08:22Z,this is bullshit:/....in this i found 2 extremely dangerous viruses with my avg security.......this made me sick:(....dont ever do this again....
,sholden,2011-07-24T17:43Z,"For anybody complaining about a virus and the intsallation being the wrong language. Only download the keygen. Download the trial version of flash from Adobe. This work's for most Adobe Products. I have use it for Premiere, Photoshop and this. Good Upload"
