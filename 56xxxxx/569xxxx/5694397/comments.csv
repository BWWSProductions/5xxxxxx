,pat2260,2010-07-17T08:04Z,You know....I.R.P never has a nice thing to say....nothin\'.  Him and his other Israeli hater buddy whose name escapes me right now are so tiresome.  Constant negative feed back...constantly...everywhere I go.  Someone\'s lookin\' for some attention....obviously....it\'s obvious.......crystal fokkin\' clear.
,funkymonkey1967,2010-07-17T13:19Z,"well said pat, i dont normally write comments on here, as the wingers, moaners,freeloaders and big girls, dont deserve a response, but when they start getting racist, it realy winds me up, they realy need to start thinking outside the box, so come on all you racists, lets keep your rants, for your rallys, or where ever it is you learn this stuff , and give the uploaders some love, remember , green skull = we love you :)"
,wira020,2010-08-12T14:07Z,"Hye there, does anyone know where i can get english subtitle of this movie.. i'm having problem understanding their accent.. thanks.."
,dablade80,2010-11-06T23:50Z,"I actually made a tpb profile just to comment on here, thanks BONE! reason I downloaded this movie was I just recently got into Law and Order UK (huge Law and Order fan) and in the 3rd episode, Vice, there was this absolutely SMOKING actress who played this young prostitute with the hottest accent and most beautiful eyes. I had heard she was in this movie too, so I look forward to watching it and seeing if she is!"
,Stephencarter93,2010-12-20T12:58Z,Why doesn't the sound work ?
,redecouverte,2011-02-14T19:39Z,Why doesn't anyone say anything about the Audio/Video? That's kind of what people wanna know when downloading stuff. 
,Redsie22,2011-04-10T09:26Z,"Great movie. Great quality. A=10/V=10 :> Thanks, Bone!"
