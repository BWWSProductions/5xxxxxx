"Too Late For Goodbyes" is the first single (the second single in the US) from Julian Lennon's 1984  album Valotte. It featured the harmonica of Jean "Toots" Thielemans, and it was a top-ten hit in the UK and the US, reaching number six in the UK Singles Chart in November 1984, and number five on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in late March 1985.

"Too Late for Goodbyes" peaked at number one on the US Adult Contemporary chart in 1985, spending two weeks at the top of this chart. With this single, Lennon accomplished something that his father (ex-Beatle John Lennon) never did, but all three of the other ex-Beatles (Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison) had done; namely, have at least one song top the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart.

The music video for the song was directed by Sam Peckinpah.

Valotte is the debut album by singer-songwriter Julian Lennon, the son of ex-Beatle  John Lennon. It was released on October 15, 1984 on Atlantic Records in the US and Canada, and Charisma/Virgin Records for the rest of the world. It was recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama and The Hit Factory in New York City. The album would be certified Platinum (shipments of more than 1,000,000 copies).

John Charles Julian Lennon (born 8 April 1963) is an English musician and songwriter, and the first son of John Lennon. He is the only child of Lennon's first marriage to Cynthia Powell, and his godfather was Beatles' manager Brian Epstein. He was named after John Lennon's late mother, Julia.

Lennon's first-ever tour in the spring of 1985 was documented as part of the film Stand By Me: A Portrait Of Julian Lennon â€” a film profile started by Sam Peckinpah, but directed by Martin Lewis after Peckinpah's death.

Lennon has been seen in several films including The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (1996, but shot in 1968), Cannes Man (1996), Imagine: John Lennon (1988), Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll (1987) and had a cameo in Leaving Las Vegas (1995) as a bartender. Julian provided the voice for the title role in the animated film David Copperfield (1993) and was also the voice of Toby the Teapot in the animated special The Real Story of I'm a Little Teapot (1990).

Julian Lennon is also the producer of the documentary called WhaleDreamers  about an aboriginal tribe in Australia and its special relationship to whales. It also touches on many environmental issues. This film has received many awards and was shown at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.
