But by now, they\'ve released two collaborative albums of elegantly debauched Nancy Sinatra/Lee Hazlewood-esque torch songs, 2006\'s Mercury Prize-nominated Ballad of the Broken Seas and 2008\'s Sunday at Devil Dirt, and they sound perfectly natural next to each other.nCampbell and Lanegan now have a third team-up album on the way, titled Hawk. Vanguard will release it on August 24 in the U.S., and in the UK, it\'s due August 16 from V2/Cooperative.nLanegan sings on eight of the album\'s 13 songs, and singer-songwriter Willy Mason also guests on two. Former Smashing Pumpkin James Iha plays guitar on \""You Won\'t Let Me Down Again\"". The album features covers of two Townes Van Zandt songs, \""No Place to Fall\"" and \""Snake Song\"". You can click here to stream one of the album\'s tracks, \""Come Undone\"".nCampbell and Lanegan will play the Barbican in London on September 10 and Belle and Sebastian\'s Bowlie 2 ATP in Minehead, England in December. There\'s also a U.S. tour planned, though none of those dates have been announced yet.n"
