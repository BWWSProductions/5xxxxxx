Originally billed as Brian Poole and the Tremeloes, the group were signed to a
record label by somebody who thought they had more potential than another
then-obscure group, the Beatles. They had some successes, taking Do you love
me to number one on the UK charts and having other major hits with Twist and
shout, Candy man and The three bells, but after that Brian Poole decided to go
solo. It turned out to be the wrong decision for him and he faded into obscurity,
but the remaining Tremeloes went on to bigger and better success, finding a
new lead singer but also developing harmonies.

I have never seen a compilation that included the Brian Poole tracks as well as
the more famous recordings of the Tremeloes after he left - you have to buy a
different compilation to get them - but this is the best Tremeloes compilation I
have yet seen.

Silence is golden is their most famous song. It was a cover of a Four Seasons
song that became a British number one hit and a major American hit, just
missing the top ten. Here comes my baby was written by Cat Stevens who was
unknown at the time. The Tremeloes had a huge hit - top five in the UK and top
twenty in America. After that, Cat was able to have hits with his own versions of
his songs.
