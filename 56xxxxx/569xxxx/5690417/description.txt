This album charts the birth of synthesised pop music in the 1980s and ultimately
the roots of contemporary electronic dance music.

The importance and continued popularity of 80s pop is not to be underestimated,
and the emergence of serious synthesised music producers in Kraftwerk, The
Human League, Heaven 17, The B.E.F., OMD, Yazoo, Ultravox, Talk Talk, Japan,
Devo, Sparks, Gary Numan, New Order and The Pet Shop Boys, all of whom
massively pushed the boundaries in experimenting with (mainly) Roland synths in
this era, ultimately showed the way for the house and techno producers of the 90s
to the present day.

Within this more serious side there was also some brilliant, pure synth - pop from
The Thompson Twins, Scritti Politti, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Thomas Dolby,
Simple Minds, Propaganda, Erasure, China Crisis, Belouis Some, The Lotus
Eaters, A Flock Of Seagulls, Howard Jones, Blancmange and The Associates.
As with the 2 preceding Anthems releases we have cherry picked a mix of the
biggest commercial tracks in addition to the most important and influential ones
making it a truly fantastic collector√¢
