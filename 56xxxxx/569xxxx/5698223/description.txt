NONE OF MY HDTV MOVIE RIPS HAVE LOGOS!

The sequel to Young Guns, the Brat Packers (Emilio Estevez, Christian Slater, Lou Diamond Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland) are on the run from the law and making a break for the border. Sutherland is yanked from his school-teaching job back East and extradited for trial, until he's liberated by the other members of the gang. Jon Bon Jovi adds to the Rock-Stars-in-the-Old-West feel of this one.
