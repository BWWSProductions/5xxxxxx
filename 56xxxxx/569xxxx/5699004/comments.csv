Parlor Hawk - Hoarse And Roaring (2010)




Whether you have seen them on stage or had only privilege to hear their music over the internet, it’s obvious that the fellas from Parlor Hawk love what they do, and love each other. Frontman Drew Capener has been playing the Provo-circuit for a few years, at times with band members and sometimes on his own, but it wasn’t until 2009 that Parlor Hawk as a band truly began to develop from a deep connection of friends.

Starting with the original drummer Andrew Gessel, stemmed a relationship with TJ Nokleby (a long-standing friend and guitarist from Seattle) who then introduced Drew to Seattle-bassist Andrew Dyer. Following a summer full of recording and writing under the production of Joshua James and McKay Stevens at Northplatte Records, Mark Garbett (keys, vox) joined Parlor Hawk last fall, as well as drummer Jay Tibbitts.



Drew started songwriting when he was 16, mostly writing about, “girls...love, and my family."" While none of those early bits have survived into Drew’s modern recordings, the themes are very much still the same, albeit more maturely. Parlor Hawk’s songs are beautifully woven into sincere proclamations of the truest loves and human compassion, richly enhanced by melodic dynamics and haunting instrumental and vocal harmonies. It’s no wonder that their long-awaited debut album, “Hoarse & Roaring” has been mutually released under the Northplatte Records and Intelligent Noise labels this month.

Don’t let the seriousness of their music distract you from the brotherly bond that has brought them together. Parlor Hawk has a chemistry that will keep us all on our toes for a long time to come.
