,noctiluca,2010-07-21T01:51Z,"Damn!
Another worthless production by the crapmeister-general (= 2LionsTeam)
Wide-screen cramped into a 4:3 box
Very poor image quality.
I downloaded and deleted already after 30 seconds of watching.
Don't download this; you'll just be wasting time and bandwidth.

,noctiluca,2010-07-22T23:18Z,"Crappy image quality
Widescreen (1,85:1) cramped into a sorry ass 4:3 box.
This guy tkillaah seems to be specialized in converting worthless low-quality AVI or such into DVD-format and trying to make us believe it's a DVD-Rip.
Maybe that's his alternative to jerking off in front of a Pamela Andersen poster, who knows...?
But what I don't understand is, how he manages to make all the comments to his other post disappear.
Look at all his other posts, where all the original comments have disappeared and have been replaced by meaningless 1-letter-posts..."
,tkillaaahhh,2010-07-23T02:10Z,"i'm sorry, i have to correct myself, this is idd a very bad version of the movie, don't download this, the problem will be fixed soon"
