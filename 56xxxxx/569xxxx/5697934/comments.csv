FUCK YOU ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been nice, I have begged, I have pleaded and only a few people have put their hands in their pockets and sent some cash.

To those that have sent cash I need say nothing here.... to all you other fuckheads - donate or go the fuck away for ever!

20-40 thinks that most of YOU don't read the comments.
I think you do and choose to ignore - it is someone elses problem!

Fuck you! It is OUR problem.

You have been getting 20-40 torrents from me and others since his PC died. That well is drying up assholes - yes you!

For those that still don't get it - you will start paying more for your torrents in the future. 20-40 will be gone ompletely and NO-ONE else can do what he does.
So save a few dollars now and pay hundreds down the road.

All you 'so-called' fans with your 'hope' and best wishes' with no substance make me SICK!

If this peice of vitriol annoyed you - I have at leat achieved something. If it has penetrated your brain and you have made some calculations then send some money and get The MAN himself back in business.

This is not a scam or fraud or anything like that. This is anger at an ABUSIVE group of people who won't help THEMSELVES by helping somebody else.

CAN YOU HEAR ME!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCKERS!

@ Moderators - Fuck off and leave this comment up and un-modified!

This is legitamite, not a scam, not a fraud or anything shady. Just a plea for help for the BEST encoder/upper that exists today!

Please help us to buy 20-40 a new PC.

So far 4 people (REAL fans) have donated cash to the cause. ALL of us are on minimum income (pensions etc.) and we could find the extra cash. 

Be one of the Few that will make the difference. Do NOT be one of the many,so far, that say 'someone else will donate'. PLEASE!
