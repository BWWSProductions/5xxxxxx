This Book is about nothing less than providing a new, world-wide, exhilarating focus on hemp-kitchens and hemp-bakeries. Through our efforts we are advocating a more conscious use of hemp products. Specifically, we seek to ensure that in the future this unjustly persecuted, divine plant resumes its ancestral place in human life.

The foundation of our efforts is the book "Berauschend Gut Backen mit Hanf" and its new English translation: "The High Art of Baking With Hemp". The German version of the book is available from AT-Verlag & Nachtschatten Verlag and can also be ordered through AMAZON. The English book.pdf is available under a "Creative Commons License". A print copy of the english version can also be ordered through Create Space or AMAZON Int. NEW: Available Ebook reading formats @ SMASHWORDS!

50 cents of the profit from every book sold goes to the IACM http://www.cannabis-med.org, an organization that advocates internationally for the legalization of cannabis for medical use.
