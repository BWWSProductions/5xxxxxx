Typical piss-ant ungrateful tpb user. This guy put some good work into capping and uploading this - for you to wine like a bitch because it doesn't work on your gay little console.
Put on a hat, go for a walk to the electrical retailer of your choice and buy a Playstation 3 you shallow cnut.
It'll play on one of those, dimshat."
,PurityDeath,2010-12-05T06:13Z,"I don't bother playing BS on a console for no reason but I have a feeling it's your own inability to make it function on your X-Boxes, not the file itself.
Just like 90% of the problems people have not being able to view movies on their comps is their own failure to DL codecs or understand the functions on their own video players."
