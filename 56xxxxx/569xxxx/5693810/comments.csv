[V],Murlok,2010-07-15T15:44Z,"To protect themselves against unintended loss of their data, most companies create images of the system and data drives of all their network computers, and store them on high-performance servers. Many employees, however, like those in the support or sales departments, do a lot of work using their notebooks. If they accidentally overwrite important customer data or sales figures, or when a system error suddenly occurs, putting things right again will not come cheaply. Creating images of data and systems, on a regular basis, will prevent annoying circumstances like this from taking place and can help you avoid longer downtimes or time-consuming restorations!nnImportant Features at a Glancen?
