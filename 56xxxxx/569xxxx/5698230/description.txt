Enjoy.
I will seed this until like 5-6 people get it at least, and come back periodically and reseed as well, but this torrent as all my torrents will, need for others to not just grab it and run. I only have a 100K upload speed, so for me to continue bringing in uploads, others have to take the torch and continue.
