I'm back to seeding this again. once more, others need to keep it active. doing the work scanning it, making it into a pdf / etc took effort, but I just do not have the Bandwidth to seed this for eternity.....Others need to continue where I cannot. and good luck to you all who are learning guitar. I still enjoy playing mine."
