,garymalone1701,2011-06-19T19:10Z,My God  the quality is great! Downloaded 1 episode to check the updated fx and everything.  Going to download rest and share as long as possible. Thank you for posting and the hard work you did is appreciated.
,FatFreddy61,2011-10-08T14:16Z,"the only reason i'm not dling these is because you didn't include the episode names in the filenames! that's just plain disappointing, especially since i've never seen most of the series."
,LordHumungusNOS,2011-11-01T04:04Z,Has anyone seen TOS - S02E06 - The Doomday Machine. That was one of the best space battles in TOS. Was any goodies added?
