,pmyy,2011-05-01T00:12Z,"Video stutters in places, tried with several different players and codecs. Not a big deal, but annoys the crap out of me.

Audio was ok though."
,Biscuit101,2011-05-19T19:19Z,"Fast Download, no probs.

Over-compressed though, video quality low and sound suffers."

,raexneol,2011-11-21T22:48Z,"@zioh318

That episode is actually s1 ep21; it was unaired and misplaced in the middle of s2 here. So, yeah, it's a bit confusing, but it makes sense if you put it in order."
,wiezimag,2011-11-26T17:05Z,"Ignore s02e11 (like someone else said, it's really s01e21) and watch e12, I think besides that everything's just fine."
,TedLilly,2011-12-12T05:59Z,thanks for the up 
,dangrath,2012-03-06T00:14Z,"@zioh318 hello moron. Thanks for the spoiler.  PUT  ***SPOILER ALERT*** if you are going to say anything about the fucking show content. DAMN!!!


Video quality note: it's great, thanks for the upload."

11 	""Unearthed"" 	Frederick E. O. Toye 	David H. Goodman & Andrew Kreisberg 	January 11, 2010 	3T7670 	7.72[12]
A seventeen-year-old girl, Lisa (Alice Kremelberg), comes back from the dead. Fringe Division investigates, and it is soon determined that at the same time, a soldier named Rusk was murdered, making them believe Rusk's consciousness has possessed Lisa. The team discovers Rusk is on a mission to take revenge on his wife who had him killed. Walter posits that, due to a heavy radiation exposure, Rusk's energy wasn't completely expended, and thus able to possess Lisa. Rusk possessed Lisa long enough to deal with his wife and until Lisa is eventually able to purge him from her consciousness. The episode was produced as part of season 1, as Charlie Francis is seen alive in the episode. However, it went unaired until season 2. "

,boombap2,2012-05-08T22:11Z,"Download speed was very fast, thanks seeders.

There's a problem with most, if not all, of the files though.  I played them in 5 different media players, and only VLC plays them pretty well.  With the other programs, there's a lot of stuttering and flickering throughout the episodes. "
,Trigun83,2012-05-20T20:59Z,"stuttering with all files i did update codecs and players, these are the players that are not working:
 kmplayer, vlc, bs free, mediaplayer classic. no idea what is wrong on these files or my codecs but first time happening that no player is working..."
