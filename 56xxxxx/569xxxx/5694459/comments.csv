,telep_man,2010-07-19T20:42Z,"The 2nd movie looks ok, but the 1st one is kinda crappy. Not much, just a lil. Anyway thanx"
,qbiggums,2010-09-02T21:20Z,"the 1st one seems more like a screener than a blu-ray rip, haven't watched the 2nd one yet"
,qbiggums,2010-09-02T21:27Z,"nvm what i posted, i did a bit more browsing on 28 days later and ive learned that the movie was shot by a camcorder so the quality is by no means the uploaders fault"
,Arrowdodger,2010-09-20T19:19Z,Any subtitles?
,osriccc,2010-11-10T09:50Z,"Second one looks great. First one looks good too but has the aftercredits CUT OFF... And there's a very annoying framedrop at the very beginning when Jimmy is yelling ""hello!"". For anyone wondering... The 28 Days Later + 28 Weeks Later torrent is basically the same. So if framedrops annoy you. Avoid."
,samuelk44,2011-01-10T05:02Z,Seed?   Anyone? Please?
,umarnawazkhan,2011-03-24T07:09Z,can't find any good 28 Days Later & 28 Weeks torrent this looks like xvid format. DVD rip or worse. dark in some places or maybe the movie was made like this.
