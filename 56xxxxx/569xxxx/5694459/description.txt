Encoders Notes: Most of the 28 Days Later was shot using a 16mm Canon DV camcorder making it look grainy and dull but its how the director Danny Boyle intened it to be and the reason why they look more like a DVDRip than a BRRip however the last 10 minutes of the film were shot in HD 35mm so the ending looks better than the main film.
Still exellent films though so enjoy and seed !
