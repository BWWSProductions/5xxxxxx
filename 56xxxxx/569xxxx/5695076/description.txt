This is another "feel good" flick. Danny takes the lead role as a tour rep
in Ibiza for "Young Free & Single". It's hot, loud and sexy, which is what
every guy wants on holiday. It's also a race to see which rep can win the
prize for most sexual conquests. The reps handle endless nights,endless
booze and sex the best they can. The only down side is their manager, an
arrogant selfish bitch who makes their lives hell at every possible chance.
This is a fun, easy going movie based on the cult novel of the same name by

Darren Daniels is a deeply insincere talk show host whose show "Tabloid TV"
uncovers the darkest secrets of even the most virtous celebrity guest.Every
personality is queuing up to be seen on the russian roulette of talk shows,
despite the one-in-five chance of humiliation. Darren is introduced to the
malevolent Vince who leads him on an erotic romp that concludes with
terrifying violence.Can Darren escape his own sinister skeleton in the
closet,or will he become the ultimate victim of his own creation.
Danny plays Joe Public who is both the MC on the live set of the
"Tabloid TV" show and also does a voice over during the movie.
Sadly this is a rarely seen film that is hard to find, yet it shows
an accomplished and subtle side to Danny's acting, a worthy
addition to his professional portfolio.

out of control, the thuggish sports fanatic is prompted to reconsider his
brutal lifestyle and make a change for the better.

In the era when Britain's criminal elite fled for the safety of Spain in
order to escape the long-arm of Margaret Thatcher, a young scoundrel from
the tenements of South London finds the allure of money, women, and drugs
leading him down a dangerous path of self-destruction. Assigned the task of
delivering a large sum of money to an ex-con named Charlie (Tamer Hassan)
in Puerto Banus, English lad Frankie (Danny Dyer) becomes hopelessly
enamored with the laid back lifestyle enjoyed by the cheeky playboy and his
loyal ensemble of British ex-pats. Though it isn't long before Frankie is
named Charlie's second in command, the situation soon begins to heat up when
loyalties start to shift and business takes a back seat to pleasure. There's
no doubt that Frankie has a flair for the criminal lifestyle, though by the
looks of things he's getting a little too comfortable with his newfound
position of power. When Frankie succumbs to temptation and begins romancing
Carly (Georgina Chapman), the flirtatious girlfriend of psycho gangster
Sonny (Roland Manookian), it begins to look as if the lawless apprentice's
whirlwind criminal career will soon end with a bang.
