When worlds collide sometimes you get something unusually magical.
And guess what? Saiyuki is such magic.

NguyÃªn LÃª's fifth album for ACT is performed by LÃª himself (guitars), Mieko
Miyazaki (koto and vocals) and Prabhu Edouard (tablas, percussion and vocals)
and as you might guess, there's a strong Indo jazz and trad Japanese elements
with ambient, modal and Offramp themes throw into the genre mix.

The opener 'Sweet Ganesh' sets the tone but on the meditative groove but the
addition of Hariprasad Chaurasia on bassuri flute on three tracks almost steels
the show (erm, CD); 'Autumn Wind' is sublime (think Yusek Lateef in Nepalese
temple looking down on the world).

The other two are 'Mina Zuki' and 'Sangam' and both all are supeb. 'Mina Zuki'
is more uptempo with a bit of a Greek Island influence along with Mieko on top
form on this one. 'Sangam' even includes some chorus vocals but it's one for
guitar heads but all four of them get to solo - this is possibly the most
instant track on the album.

But it's not all about Nariprasad's flute, as a trio 'Mayur' and 'Hen Ho' are
like a modern indo-jazz fusion (of a McLaughlin/Santana period); it's so post
jazz-nodding there should be a Big Chill/Womad gig next year at least. And
whilst at it, 'Nanae Goromo' takes the concept to the extended prog extreme and
'Azur' is Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence 'revisit' in a Saiyuki vibe.

The title 'Saiyuki' is taken from a 16th Century novel by Wu Cheng'en and it
means "Journey To The West". And the music is like that as these guys are so
open, 'Izanagi Isanam' even sounds a little risquÃ© on the vocal introduction
(would Osunlade love to remix this one? I think so).

This is a absolutely fantastically original album and all from Kevin Le Grand to
Jez Nelson to Nihal to Pathaan to Gilles Peterson, they all should be on this
one as Saiuki is so now and what with Portico Quartet and the Bei Bei and Shawn
Lee collaboration, this is hitting the crossover world/spiritual jazz in all the
right places. This is a truly 'joyful encounter'.
