Lee Simon is an unsuccessful novelist turned travel writer who immerses himself 
in celebrity journalism following a midlife crisis and subsequent divorce from his

with performers, models, and other players in the world of entertainment, Lee 
increasingly questions his purpose in life. He blows numerous opportunities due to

 and successful.
