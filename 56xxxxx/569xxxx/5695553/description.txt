Uploader Comments:

Action/Comedy/Softcore as only the late great Sidaris could do. This is the one that started the Bullets, Bombs, & Babes theme that he later perfected. Basically a Russ Meyer for the mid 80s and 90s, who really liked to blow shit up.
According to some guy on Amazon, Leonard Maltin called this one  "a loose remake of his 1973 film Stacey"

There will  be much more to come if they're wanted. I have 8 others from the collection, including one his son (Christian Drew Sidaris) directed. I considered doing all 7 of the Andy directed films as one collection, but decided that my connection and lack of seedbox doesn't warrant such a massive single upload.
