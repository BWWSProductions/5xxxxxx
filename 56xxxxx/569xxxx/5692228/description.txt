NUTRITION's 3rd EP: DARK SECRETS (2010)

01) Into The Forest of Molech

02) Weaving Spiders Come Not Here


DARK SECRETS EP: Based on the ceremonies and secrets of Bohemian Grove, and recorded in a slightly more raw, dark and traditional Black Metal format (compared to Nutrition's usual 'over-the-top' style).

================================================

In early 2009 artist/writer and ex-vocalist
of Tokyo's Detritum, Jeremy Mauney, had the
idea to create a black metal band with sci-fi
elements basing song/lyrical content around his
own extraterrestrial research.

After posting classified ads online looking for
interested musicians, Jeremy was approached by
Roland La Goy (of Inlaid Rust and Molestation).
Ideas were exchanged, and NUTRITION was born.
