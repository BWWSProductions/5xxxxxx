[color=Maroon][b]It?s the greatest phenomenon in musical theatre and this weekend you can share in
the excitement ? with an exclusive 11-track Phantom Of The Opera CD absolutely
FREE inside The Mail on Sunday.

This unique CD features a fantastic selection of songs, specially chosen by
composer Andrew Lloyd Webber himself, from the magical original Phantom Of
The Opera and his brilliant sequel Love Never Dies.

The Phantom Of The Opera has been a spectacular success ever since its first
performance back in October 1986.

Now a global hit, it remains a huge draw on the London stage and is the longest
running show on Broadway.

The love story that forms the heart of the narrative still beats as strongly as ever.
In the plot of the original Phantom, heroine Christine Daae believes that an angel of
music is teaching her to sing.

In fact he is a disfigured genius, The Phantom, who lives in the bowels of the Paris
Opera House.
