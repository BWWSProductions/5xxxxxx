,shiverz718,2010-07-14T23:35Z,"Ok Globe, I\'ll say it.  The user interface is horrid.. It\'s way too crowded and the music and beeps aren\'t very pleasant.  The purpose of the program - it works just fine; it opens up the emulator for the particular game system you want to play.nnIt\'s a good effort and you are a great uploader,  just giving you my opinion."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-14T23:54Z,"To shiverz718 : i can?t be more disagree with yournopinion , you have lot of space for any of available games systems , it is just a matter to get used to the user interface and with a tool with all of this games systems certainly the available space for the interface make sense , for other side , this is a tool about games , so a nice informal way for all the games systems is perfect then you just select in your free wish what game system you want to play , more : make sense have a button explaining the emulator configuration , certainly make sense run the game system to the wished emulator and more than shore that is nice have a easy inclusion of new games no matter is the game system , so generally speaking certainly a very nice and appropriate  interface , just a matter of a little practice that?s all and the FIRST TIME USER TXT included IS TO READ , not for decoration of the emulation tool , configure the glomulator emulators then it is ok to play around any of the available games systems and you have a searcher to help getting more easily as possible new games . Enjoy your Glomulator + , happy gaming ..."

[V],globeplus,2010-07-16T08:20Z,"Hi , the Glomulator GOLD is now close with real a few hours of work in front , this comment just to give some generic information about the cheater extra tool , with the cheater the user will learn the generic work for using cheats and lot of the available games systems that is possible with a work with a little attention , with this cheater not only the user will get a more easy as possible general access to the use of the cheats but also a few games systems , the ones that was possible already have the cheats in a nice pratical way to be used , this is a deep research work that can always improve if a new useful thing is finded then with a small update it is easy to actualise the cheater with somthing new that is useful , this CHEATER is the normal upgrade consequence analising the all work in this ultimate emulation tool for the PC , why ? because we got first the nice game systems with nice emulation running ok with the front menu then we needed games games to play and maybe actualise the emulators then we got a searcher integrated and after having the games systems running fine and games we probably want cheats to help play tough games to be played in some games sytems , games that welove to play but looks borring and tough playing without extra help , why ? because we are concentrated hard on the game with real pleasure and we want to keep going but at a certain point of the game the lives not too much and maybe we loose and we want to keep playing because we are loving neeing playing the game , WHAT NOW ? WHAT`S THE SOLUTION ? we get cheats that work with the game and then maybe we can keeping pplaying that nice game that we really love it to finish ... Ok , my friendly users the CHEATER can be useful for many games in some games systems but if you are playing a game that you feel that the cheats not really needed because you get the sensation that you can manage the gameplay ok , so in that ones you can play in the normal way , what i mean is you don?t need to be obececated to play every single game with cheats , that depend on the game that you want to play . All right , that?s all and the Glomulator GOLD with a CHEATER it will be available today . Enjoy your Glomulator , happy gaming ..."

,tibrusjer,2010-08-08T21:52Z,"Great that you have combined most game systems in a program, but the user interface is too crowded with unused buttons and bleeps..

And your program just servers as a hotkey function to the real emulator softwares..
Wished for a more robust program, with more build-in functionality.

Last but not least, you should listen to the users of the program, shiverz718 wrote that the UI wasn't good at all, and I agree.

Good concept, but you need to redesign the UI.
Btw, experiencing some minor lag in the UI too 'cause of the overcrowded button layout."
