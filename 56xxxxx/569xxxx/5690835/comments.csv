,repsolfireblade05,2010-07-14T08:37Z,"thanks guys ,,"
,PhilLesh12,2010-07-14T09:09Z,This is only the first hour of their two hour special final season episode.nnWhen will the second hour be uploaded?
,PhilLesh12,2010-07-14T09:16Z,"nevermind, they were hyping this on tv and radio ads all week, to maximize their profit off of Phil Harris\'s death.  They made it sound like it was a two hour special, but obviously they just meant that after the catch was the second hour.nnBesides, it\'s not like anyone didn\'t learn about his death 5 months ago."
,gary63693,2010-07-14T18:34Z,"@ PhilLesh12, Why do you have to announce his death before people even see this episode? seriosuly pal, ur a tard and i hope others feel this way. You ruin it for others, ask questions like this on the next episode"
,WOOOOO56,2010-07-14T20:19Z,"gary63693--nnWhat did PhilLesh12 ruin? nnLike he said, Deadliest Catch made it public that he died 5 months ago.nnIt was already known."
,magilum,2010-07-14T22:15Z,"They also showed the ending in every commercial I saw for a week now, so get a grip, it\'s not a spoiler when they give it away in the commercials."
,frydfairy,2010-07-14T22:18Z,I only found out he died a couple of weeks ago.  Not everyone knows
,gary63693,2010-07-15T01:16Z,"I havn\'t seen this in any commercial, this was the first time i knew he died and probably thousands of others didn\'t know either"
,ceemcgee,2010-07-20T05:58Z,"It was headline news (on some channels) the day he died or the day after. If people don't know about it but most do, it's not a spoiler. R.I.P. Captain Phil Harris"
,ceemcgee,2010-07-20T22:26Z,"Thanks for the up TvTeam! If anyone is looking for S04 E04, I uploaded it on PB!
