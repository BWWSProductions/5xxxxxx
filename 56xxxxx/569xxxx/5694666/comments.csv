,conanismyidol,2010-07-19T05:26Z,"Thanks so much!!

And Eskimomann, I don't think she has an album out yet. As of now, she doesn't even have a record contract with any label. Hopefully she'll get signed soon and make an album!"
,bsipe216,2010-07-19T21:05Z,"Yeah, as far as I know, this is her only song besides covers.  She supposedly has enough songs right now for an EP (4-5 track CD).

Sidenote: I find her live performance of this song to be significantly superior to the studio version.  Way more grit and emotion in her voice live.  "
