 On being demobbed at the end of the war, Canadian flyer 
 Laurence Gerard returns to France to discover who       
 ordered the killing of a group of Resistence fighters   
 including his new bride. He identifies Vichy            
 collaborator Marcel Jarnac, who is reported as dead     
 himself. Not believing this, Gerard follows the trail   
 to Argentina where it is apparent that Nazism is also   
 far from dead.
