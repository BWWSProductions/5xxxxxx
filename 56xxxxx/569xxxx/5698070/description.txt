      As part of the First Cut strand, showcasing bold, bright and
      original documentaries by up-and-coming film-makers, Ruth Kelly
      directs Girls on the Pull, following three women who are on a
      quest to stop pulling their hair out. Hair is a
      multi-million-pound industry. It is a potent sign of femininity,
      sexuality and health. As a nation, we are obsessed with it: we
      preen it, cut it, style it, dye it and spend millions on it
      every year. Losing it can be devastating. Yet across Britain
      thousands of women are literally tearing their hair out. They
      suffer from trichotillomania, an impulse-control disorder that
      causes people to pull out their own hair, often to the point of
      extreme baldness. This First Cut film explores the reasons
      behind this by meeting three women living with the condition who
      are desperate to get their hair-pulling under control.
