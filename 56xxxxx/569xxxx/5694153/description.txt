Johnny Vegas, returns as Moz, the ultimate slacker, 
in a brand new series of the multi-award winning 
comedy drama Ideal.

With his girlfriend Jenny quite literally in a coma, 
Moz decides to turn over a new leaf and abandon his 
career as a weed dealer. In fact, he's even promising 
to make the ultimate sacrifice and get a proper job! 
Yet despite his best efforts, Moz soon finds himself 
dragged into a criminal underworld of shootings and 
human trafficking.

Then, the unthinkable happens: Moz is busted by the 
police...

With it's distinctive blend of comedy, menace, and 
romance - and even some very bizarre song and dance 
routines - series 5 takes viewers into riotous new 
territory.
