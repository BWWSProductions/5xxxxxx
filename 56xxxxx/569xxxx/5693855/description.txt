"The Girl on the Glass Mountain" refer to a fairy tale
or story, briefly mentioned in one scene. It has no 
relevance to this episode.

This is a routine story, but what's interesting to 
point out is that as the 14th show of the season 
to air, Clu Gulager is back in the opening credits.
However, Deputy Sheriff Ryker is nowhere to be seen 
in this episode or the next one.  

In fact his boss Sheriff Abbott turns up
briefly in the end, so Ross Elliott appears again.

Steve Raines, who played cattle drover Jim Quince
on RAWHIDE for many years is a Shiloh cattle drover 
named Wingy in this episode. He's the guy with
the mustache.
