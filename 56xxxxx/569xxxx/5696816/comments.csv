Thanks for all the Johnny Thunders dvd's.
I have a problem with Mondo 12.
When i try to burn it in DVD Shrink, i get an error. It says: failed to open file
VTS_01_6.vob.

Do you have any idea why?
I've had no problems with the others.

Again, thanks for all the uploads:)"

that's odd, there is no VTS_01_6.vob file, only VTS_01_1 to VTS_01_5.
I don't use DVD shrink to burn my DVDs so I'm not sure what's causing your problem.
cheers  "

Will you upload volume 13?"
