Warlords battlecry II.

Installing guide:

Install by opening .iso file with winrar or daemon tools (included in torrent)

Patch it (included)(1.04 patch)

Install Daemon tools (Skip this step if you\'ve got it already ofcourse.)

Mount the .iso file in Daemon Tools.

You should be good to go.

If your on windows 7 and you crash alot, or some of the units are invisible do this:

Go to BattlecryII.exe > Rightclick > Compability > Windows XP (Service pack 3)

And i think that\'s it.

Good luck and have fun.
