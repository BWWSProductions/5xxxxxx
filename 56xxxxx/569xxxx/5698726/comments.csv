,motley666,2010-07-18T20:56Z,"I tried to upload this game but it was a .daa file and for some reason tpb wouldn't let me. Great game, a classic."

,st1llGOD,2010-07-24T10:20Z,"Thank you chabs :) I just needed to download my own torrent, thought it would make me re-download it, but it didn't. Oh yeah by the way thanks :)"
,unholysouli,2010-11-28T21:56Z,"Go to BattlecryII.exe > Rightclick > Compability > Windows XP (Service pack 3)

I'm currently running Vista and all the units are invisible , I got no idea what you mean by ""gt"" can I get a little light on this plz, cheers..

Looking like a good game..."
,unholysouli,2010-11-28T22:00Z,I understand now... no problem found compatibility..
,unholysouli,2010-11-29T03:30Z,"Ok I tried the compatibility thing, Units Are Still Invisible...
The only difference I can see is that my service pack is xp service pack2....

I am running Vista."
,st1llGOD,2010-12-18T02:31Z,"Unholy, I'm sorry, i can't help you any further than the description of the video. I haven't played this game in ages, that's just what helped me. Sorry."
,SmashCannon,2011-01-23T11:29Z,"Hey buddy. Um, I downloaded everything and followed the instructions step by step, and can access the games menus and stuff, however as soon as i actually set up a game and it loads and I pick my starting units everything suddenly crashes and I get a message saying ""WB2 has stopped working!"". Anything that might help? I run Vista Ultimate and attempted to download 'Windows XP (service pack 3)' but can't due to a message saying it's not the right platform for the update. However I look at the comparability mode and it's running 'Windows XP (service pack 2)'. You couldn't guess how confused I am right now. My brother then downloaded it on Vista and his works fine..."
,st1llGOD,2011-02-11T17:42Z,"Smashcannon, if you've followed the instructions in the video, it should work. It's only tried on W7 and Windows XP, so I'm sorry, i can't be of more assistance on Vista."
,Rembo7,2011-07-17T09:08Z,"Hi, I'm having problem with installing it. It asks for a CD. Where can I find the crack file?"
,JamesObscure,2011-12-30T09:25Z,"hey just a quick question, when mounting do u just add the WBC.iso ? 

then burn it to a disk?
can u use a dvd-r 
or only a cd-r
cause my cd's only have 87mb
and the iso is 600+ so any suggestions :)"
,JamesObscure,2011-12-30T09:30Z,ok wtf i've mounted the WBC.iso and burnt it to a dvd and cd yet it still asks for the disk when i go to play it :/
