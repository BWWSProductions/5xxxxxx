Two lifelong friends discover that growing up sometimes means growing
apart in this gritty British drama.Charlie(Paul Nicholls) and Justin
(Roland Manookian) are a pair of best friends who grew up together in a
rough-and-tumble London neighborhood,close enough that some of Charlie's
pals jokingly refer to Justin as "the wife." Charlie and Justin are the
de facto leaders of a group of toughs,including Damien (Alexis Rodney),
Francis (Danny Dyer),and Tommy(Sid Mitchell),who make a living through
petty theft. As the boys grow into their late teens, it becomes obvious
that they are not going to be following the same paths in life. Tommy
decides to join the Army and Francis loses interest in the gang after he
gets serious with his girlfriend. Charlie has been going through changes
of his own, especially after the death of his father (David Thewlis), and
while Justin has no real ambitions beyond a life as a small-time criminal,
Charlie is smart (and practical) enough to begin thinking of a different
future. Charlie is offered a good-paying straight job by his cousin Hector
(Richard Driscoll), and he begins pursuing a relationship with Blondie
(Dani Behr), a young woman a few rungs higher on the social ladder. But as
Charlie moves forward, Justin seems stuck in neutral, and as they begin to
drift apart, Justin finds himself increasingly disenchanted with his best
friend's new life.

Mean Machine

1hr 35mn / 1.44GB 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291341/

The classic Burt Reynolds football-behind-bars flick The Longest Yard
crosses the pond. Danny Mehan(Vinnie Jones) was one of the biggest stars in
football,until he was caught rigging a game during a championship tournament.
In the wake of this scandal, Danny's career takes a nosedive and his life spins
out of control, until he finally ends up in prison for three years on an
assault and battery conviction.Danny discovers there are a number of football
fans behind bars who still hate him for fixing the game,but Danny has one
powerful fan in this prison.The warden(David Hemmings) is a devoted football
supporter with a taste for gambling;he's been trying to assemble a semi-pro
team comprised of the prison's guards, but Danny is just smart enough to know
this would seal his fate with his fellow prisoners. Instead, he offers to put
together a team of inmates, who can play practice games against the guards.
A new inmate,Sykes(John Forgeham),gets wind of Danny's idea and arranges an
exhibition match between Danny's new team and the guards, though Sykes'
motivation is more than just good fun. A powerful bookie,Sykes lost a fortune
on the game Danny threw, and expects betting to be heavy for this game. If
Danny and his men win, Sykes could make back the fortune he lost, but if the
guards come out ahead, Danny's goose is cooked. Can Danny turn a gang of losers,
misfits, and violent psychopaths --including muscle-bound lunatic Monk
(Jason Statham), creepy but loyal Billy the Limpit (Danny Dyer), tough guy
Massive (Vas Blackwood), pyromaniac Nitro (Robbie Gee), and enthusiastic
but out-of-shape Raj (Omid Djalili) -- into a proper team with a fighting
chance of winning?
