Japanese/Cantonese/Mandarin/English audio. No subtitles."
,jaded2482,2012-02-05T19:01Z,Everybody loves this movie it's been translated into a lot of languages for that reason.  My question is: Is the english audio the version before Disney got a hold of it. I'm downloading it so if you can't answer me I'll find out soon enough.
