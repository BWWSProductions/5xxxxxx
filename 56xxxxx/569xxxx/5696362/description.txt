Alex talks with regular Friday guest Bob Chapman, publisher of the the International Forecaster newsletter, a compendium of information on business, finance, economics and social and political issues worldwide, which reaches 10,000 investors and brokers monthly. Chapman became a stockbroker in 1960 and retired in 1988. For 18 of those years he owned his own brokerage firm and was probably the largest gold and silver stockbroker in the world during that period. Starting in 1967 Mr. Chapman began writing articles on business, finance, economics and politics having been printed and reprinted over the years in over 200 publications. He owned and wrote the Gary Allen Report, which had 30,000 subscribers.

Alex also covers the latest news and takes calls.



[I don't have the most recent issue of Bob Chapman's newsletter to pass along as a bonus today. Rather that including nothing extra, though, I'm adding a recent article by Web of Debt author, Ellen Brown.  This essay is titled, "How Brokers Became Bookies: The Insidious Transformation of Markets into Casinos."]

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
