The Hunt for Derbyshire

In September 1980, a typhoon south of Japan plagued the Pacific Ocean. Caught in the thick of it, the British freighter Derbyshire struggled to escape. Without even an SOS, she vanished with 44 lives aboard. After 14 years, marine experts using SONAR technology finally found her scattered on the bottom of the sea. Did the storm or a structural flaw in the ship's design kill the crew? Using underwater footage, animations of the sinking, and interviews with victims' relatives, we search for the truth.
