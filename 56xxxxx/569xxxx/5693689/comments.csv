,javed8,2010-08-03T11:08Z,"I don't know what sndhandsmoke is talking about.  This works perfectly on my Iphone 4 running 4.0.1.

Your phone has to be JAILBROKEN and patched with APPSYNCED 4.x"
,s0mer4ndom1diot,2010-08-28T23:35Z,"iphone 3gs on firmware 4.0.1 worked for me!
1. jailbreak your device
2. follow this guide to download and install appsync
http://www.redmondpie.com/appsync-4.0-for-ios-4.0/
3. restart device, install free app from official appstore, reboot device
4. drag this .ipa file into itunes, go to app section on device and check this tomtom app. click sync and VOILA!"
,DanQuiros,2010-09-01T01:08Z,"I uploaded this and I can confirm that I had it working perfectly on iPhone 3G 3.0.1 and 4.0, and also iPhone 4 with 4.0 and 4.0.1. Obviously the 3G was kind of slow, but it works very fast and stable on the iPhone 4.

""sndhandsmoke"" probably has no idea how to jailbreak or appsync, or even know what that means. Now is super easy to jailbreak your iPhone and install the AppSync patch.

On your iPhone open Safari and go to: jailbreakme.com and slide to jailbreak (there's no way it could be easier than that) and then follow ""s0mer4ndom1diot""'s guide.

Thanks to everyone else who confirm that is working fine."
