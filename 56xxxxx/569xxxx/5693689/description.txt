TomTom Navigation v1.4.1 USA-Canada Maps .ipa for iPhone and iPod Touch.
I tested it myself in my own iPhone and everything seems to be working just fine. It should work for iPod Touch as well.
For those with the map crashing problem on previous versions this is the solution, at least it was for me.
