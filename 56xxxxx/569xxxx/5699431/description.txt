Rock Me is a single released by the American  glam metal band Great White in 1987. It was a breakout hit for the band, and still receives significant airplay on classic rock radio. The original version clocked in at over 7 minutes, with the radio and video versions being trimmed down to between 3 and 5 minutes. Strangley, many of the lyrics to the edited versions are different from the original, though the music track remains the same.

Once Bitten... is the third full-length studio album released by the American rock band Great White. It was released in 1987 and sold a million copies after their next album became a success. "Rock Me" became a hit single and is one of Great White's best known songs. Once bitten... became a commercial success, going Platinum a few years later. In the UK, the tracklisting was strangely altered, losing four new tracks and replacing them with songs from 1986's Shot In The Dark, as well as a live version of "What Do You Do."

Great White is an American hard rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1978. The band gained popularity during the 1980s and early 1990s. The band released several albums in the late 1980s and gained airplay on MTV  with music videos for songs like "Once Bitten, Twice Shy". The band reached their peak popularity with the album ...Twice Shy in 1989.

The band continued to release new material into the 1990s, although none of their material charted in the United States. In 2003, the band made headlines when The Station nightclub fire led to the deaths of 100 people in West Warwick, Rhode Island, including the band's guitarist Ty Longley, who had been a member of the band for three years. Great White made a comeback in 2007 with the release of a new album and an accompanying tour.
