[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
Quite a few releases out but i don't see any encodes of 700mb of the movie so....anyway tweaked the colors changing the gamma
lum saturation, rgb colors lowering yellow, slightly increasing cyan and touch of red. changed the brightness and contrast and
gave it some sharpness, overall pretty decent r5 audio is orc's synced by imagine. audio is pretty good based on line audio
little bassy but pretty good :) anyway sure 1 or 2 will still want a 700mb one :P
