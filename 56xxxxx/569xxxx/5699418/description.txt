Break It Down: Cargo Truck

After more than 600,000 miles of hauling cargo, the Volvo FH12 Globetrotter has reached the end of the road and is headed for a breakdown. In Sweden, a country known for its "green" initiatives, Volvo's goal is for 95 percent of the truck to be reused or recycled. We'll watch a team of experts rip it apart, beat it up and melt it down. Then, at 10 feet tall and packing a 700-horsepower punch, we'll see it reborn, even bigger.
