Adam Rogers' third Criss Cross CD as a leader focuses exclusively on his
challenging original works. Joining the guitarist are four superb musicians:
tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, pianist Edward Simon, bassist Scott Colley, and
drummer Clarence Penn. The many twists within the opener, "Labyrinth," are
finessed with ease by the group, while Rogers adds a bit of distortion to his
instrument for the intense "Tyranny of Fixed Numbers." The extended workout of
"The Maya" is built upon an ostinato bass pattern, with Rogers and Potter
playing in unison until the piece opens up and the bassist's role is freed; then
the leader works his magic with an inventive solo. "Apparitions" is truly a
haunting melody as Rogers and Potter introduce the theme, with Penn gradually
adding background percussion. The finale, "Moment in Time," is an intriguing
low-key ballad, omitting the piano and tenor sax, while Colley (a veteran of
guitarist Jim Hall's trio) responds to the stripped-down setting with some of
his best work of the session. Highly recommended.
