...highly doubtful you are getting 500 mbps down...please do your research..only people that would get that is on a lan network"
,wtftpb,2012-05-12T04:21Z,...and maybe CERTAIN COMPANIES
,excelguy,2012-05-12T18:39Z,Why would anyone in their right mind want to see this with English voices? Only kids and Americans cant understand good voice acting. 
,rezolute,2012-05-25T19:54Z,"@excelguy

you sir are an idiot. just because YOU like subbed anime, doesn't mean its better. Everyone has their own opinion. I prefer to watch dubbed mainly because I don't want to have to read subtitles. But there are times when I prefer to watch subbed anime either because there is no dubbed, or I don't like the dubbed voice acting. The voice acting in the dubbed Spirited Away is great, and for you to think it sucks, is just plain stupid."
,iwantmypot,2012-07-04T23:29Z,"For some reason the download said complete, but only the first 31 minutes were downloaded. It ends while she is on the way to the top floor to get a job."
