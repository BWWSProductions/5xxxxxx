,kakeyed,2010-07-20T00:29Z,"Jesus H, Bak-er! 

If you look at the description it says in plain english that it's a CAM. To top it off, there are 4 Screenshots to look at. That should give you an ideal on the quality of the movie, or do you still need someone to help you hold your dick when you piss."
,quikkr,2010-07-20T02:40Z,"Anyone know of a release that has the whole movie (including the dance recital scene?)  Almost everything out there is missing 10 minutes :(

Thanks for the upload Raymond!"
,MissMido,2010-07-20T23:32Z,"not very clear visual, and doesn't show whole screen.  part in the middle is completely cut out (how long exactly, i don't know). screen sometimes fades to darker a bit.  good audio."
,SSfrostic,2010-07-21T05:30Z,@PCGOD95991 stfu noob if you look this guy is uploading shit that has already been uploaded 15000 times he is just changing the name of the files and uploading it to get his rep up and that to me is retrded as site admin need to start watching and demote ppl that do this shit!!!
,Dibba67,2010-08-28T13:07Z,@SSfrostic   -  and where are all your quality uploads??
,lingitsheshark,2010-09-24T23:46Z,"@SSfrost - i agree with you but not your language. It is frustrating to try to find a decent cam version of a movie, and infinitely more frustrating when you find you're dling the same file over and over. maybe they're putting up all these torrents b/c different groups of people edited the same file and want to see whose is more successful. when somebody else offers a different version, i'm sure we'll all dl that, too."
,lingitsheshark,2010-09-24T23:49Z,"@Dibba67 - what exactly are you saying? that somebody who hasn't uploaded anything can't point out that many people try to pass the same file off as many different ones? or even upload the same file several times to make it look as though they have more? look thru despicable me torrents and tell me how many times raymond's name comes up, then say something."
,dopeydave420,2010-10-01T16:42Z,"Im with the quit fucking reuploading shit as your own what are you so fuckin sad you need rep for online torrents that sux anyway to impress people, who the fuck post why dont you go buy it then on a fucking torrent site? you must be the biggest fag ever"
,trikimiki,2010-10-30T12:50Z,Another great film from raymondhome    many thanxs fae bonnie scotland
