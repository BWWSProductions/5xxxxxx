,pepperjack,2010-07-21T11:15Z,"write it up to being a bit new at this stuff, but I D/L this one and for some reason it will not work on the old psp. I've put it in videos like all my mp4's and it seems fine until I go to play it and it tells me ""This video cannot be played"" Is there something stupid that I have missed with your torrents? thanks in advanced. "
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-21T14:20Z,"@pepperjack i cant promise the videos will work on old devices. I suggest u upgrade ur firmware to the lastest on ur ""old psp"" u can also try just renaming the file to mp4 instead of m4v"
