,joeconor,2010-07-17T13:36Z,"This file is completely virus-free, and thanks to mrgsapott for the effort. nnThe picture is good for a CAM.  However, the sound, while in-sync, is not great. Not mrgsapott\'s fault - s/he\'s only working with what they were given - but maybe download only if you\'re really stuck for a copy.nnV - 7/10 (for a cam)nA - 4/10nnBut yeah, no virus whatsoever. 8axter is talking shite.nn"

[T],n2kmaster,2010-09-11T22:12Z,this got the blurriness fixed or no? I wanna fix my versions blurriness and looking for a copy that the night scenes are easier to see. Maybe my 1080 dpi version that comes tonight might turn out better.
