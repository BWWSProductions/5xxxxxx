,cbfo80,2012-02-11T04:55Z,Virus embedded in the files. Once downloaded it will add other torrents to your download list without authorization. Do not download!

Are you some sort of retard?

Can you not work a torrent client?

The files in the torrent are listed ON THIS FUCKING PAGE!"

It does NOT add anything to your torrent client. However, if you look at the torrent the Uploader has included a folder called Torrent Files. Inside that folder are .torrents for you to add to your client if you wish. These are other torrents that the Uploader has put on TPB. So now what's the problem again?

Thanx Konashine!"
