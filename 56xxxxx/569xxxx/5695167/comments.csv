[T],SgtRlee,2010-11-08T10:44Z,"There's a peer who's up to 99.8% but got stuck and can't complete this torrent. I've had the same problem on two other torrents and have figured out that it's a corrupted text file. If you stop the torrent, do a ""Force Re-check"", then look in the files section, you will see the videos are at 100%, but one at 99%, though the complete video is there, uTorrent just stops because it can't go on to verify the text file. Just download the original text file i uploaded for you at the link below, stop the torrent in uTorrent, and replace the corrupt one in the folder. Now right click on the torrent and select ""Force Re-Check"" when complete start the torrent. (sometimes you need to remove (Not Delete) the torrent from uTorrent, then redownload it above which will do an automatic ""Force Re-Check :) "

[T],SgtRlee,2010-11-08T10:46Z,"just enter in ""zshare"" between the dots"
