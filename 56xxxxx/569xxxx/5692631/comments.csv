Getting a ""Hostname Not Found"" error, I can't seed. Trying to fix the problem."
,BuzzMe,2010-08-10T05:40Z,"So, @appleXs, that was several weeks ago.  Any luck getting the issue resolved?  Kinda looks like not, as there's no seeds..."
,appleXs,2010-08-10T07:56Z,"No, it's still not working. :/

I asked in the suprbay forums, but even they were puzzled."
