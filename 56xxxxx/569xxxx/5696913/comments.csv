,justincha,2010-07-17T06:51Z,"hey Dark_anth and those TRYING to download.... I\'m a first time uploader and i misspelled the bittorrent tracker so you have to right click the torrent, click add tracker, then add an \""r\"" in bittorrent, and click ok. really sorry about that. my isp was being really slow when i was uploading the torrent to TPB and the captcha has a 90 sec timeout so the description was messed up... I also forgot to add an \""e\"" in Forever. I\'m a spelling fail Iknow. When i try to edit the spelling and add a description, the save button doesn\'t do anything. Sorry again."
,justincha,2010-07-17T07:03Z,i also apologize for my uploading speed. i have no idea why it\'s so slow...
