Plot: Keeping Mum starts in Flashback with sweet lovely Rosemary "Rosie" Jones (Emilia Fox) making friends as she takes a train for some distant holiday spot. As the Train inspectors look over her trunks they spot blood oozing from the bottom. It seems that young Rosie has dispatched her husband and his mistress with a clear conscience. In the present in the town of Little Wallop, England we find Gloria Goodfellow (Kristin Scott Thomas) trying to manage her life with her husband, Walter (Rowan Atkinson) a hapless Vicar whose idea of affection is a kiss on his wifes hand. Daughter Holly (Tamsin Egerton) has discovered her libido and how to use it and young son Petey (Toby Parkes) is bullied consistently at school. When the new house maid Grace (Maggie Smith) arrives, she immediately begins to take a subtle but firm hand at managing all that is wrong with the Goodfellow household and adjusting the collective mindset of the occupants. The main problem it seems is Gloria and her inner strength, as she longs for affection from Walter, she is distracted by the attention of an American Golf Instructor Lance (Patrick Swayze) who intends to bed the needy Gloria as an addition to his trophy collection. Grace executes a series of changes that leave more than a few citizens wondering where everyone has gone and empowers everyone in the Goodfellow house to take more control over their destinies.
