That the file is a .gcm. nnGCM is just a renamed ISO, all you have to do is change the extension.nnIs you can\'t see the extension of the image go to My Computer ----> Click Tools ----> Folder Options ----> View -----> Uncheck hide extensions for known file types and change the extension of your image to .iso or .gcm depending what filetype you want to change your image to."
