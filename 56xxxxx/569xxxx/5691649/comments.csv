,twenty40,2010-07-14T16:58Z,"@seenoevil47: 1-5 have been upped. 6. would be encoded right now and left on mercy of houruoha or Jon. I guess that\'s all \'cause people never have bothered to do three clicks and get my e-mail address publicly available on Facebook. Only 12 people have done that, and they have everything I have encoded during this unfortunate time."
,twenty40,2010-07-14T17:11Z,"@seenoevil47: LOL. If you do not mind relatively lower quality, 100.Questions.S01E06.H264[lepton].mp4 as 53.1 MB is part of torrent TV.Soup.du.Jour.July.1.2010 and I suggest you to take just what you need, because 320p could be upped or not. It is not in my hands.rnEncoding is fine, I have watched that one and I have been wondering why I did not encode ep. 6 when I saw your question."
