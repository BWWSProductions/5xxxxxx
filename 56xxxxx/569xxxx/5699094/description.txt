In 1982 Britain fought it's first major naval engagement since Suez.
The Falklands Play depicts the back-room planning and debates that
went on Downing Street and the White House in the lead-up to the military
confrontation which ended with the Argentine surrender at Port Stanley.
Patricia Hodge as Mrs Thatcher, leads a cast that reads like a who's-who
of top British actors... 

This is neither a war film, nor is it suitable for Thatcher haters.
