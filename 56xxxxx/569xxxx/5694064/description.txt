                      PLOT                       
                                               
                                                       
     

        The Doctor and Romana receive a distress signal and arrive  on
        Chloris,  a  lush  and  verdant  world  that  has  only  small
        quantities  of  metals, all  of  which are  controlled  by its
        ruler, Lady Adrasta. Adrasta keeps  order with the aid of  her
        Huntsman  and  his  wolfweeds -  mobile  balls  of vegetation 
        - while  a band  of scruffy  thieves, led  by Torvin, organize
        raids on her palace to steal whatever metal they can.

        The Doctor identifies the distress signal's source as a  large
        eggshell-like structure in the forest. He is taken prisoner by
        Adrasta's guards and, in order to escape, leaps into the  Pit 
        - the entrance to a cave system into which all those who incur
        Adrasta's wrath  are consigned  to be  devoured by  an immense
        green globular  creature living  within. The  Doctor, with the
        aid  of the  elderly soothsayer  Organon, discovers  that the
        creature is not  an unthinking killer  but an ambassador  from
        the planet Tythonus,  which has a  lack of chlorophyll  but an
        abundance of metal.

        The Tythonians had hoped to trade with Chloris, but the  first
        person their ambassador Erato  encountered on arriving in  his
        eggshell-like  ship  was Adrasta,  who  took his  communicator
        device  and trapped  him in  the Pit  so as  to preserve  her
        monopoly on metal. Erato retrieves his communicator and  kills
        Adrasta.

        He  then  warns the  Doctor  that the  Tythonians  have set  a
        neutron star on a collision course with Chloris in retaliation
        for his imprisonment. With the Doctor's help he is freed  from
        the Pit and, out in space, spins an aluminium shell around the
        star, allowing for it to be pulled off course by the  TARDIS's
        gravitational tractor beam and thus saving Chloris.
