 When mobster Walt Radak tries to trick independent      
 trucker Steve Randall into transporting stolen furs,    
 Steve alerts the police, and Walt's young brother Al is 
 caught and held for a cop-killing. When ruthless Radak  
 tries to extort Steve's help in clearing Al, Steve and  
 his young wife flee for their lives, only to find that  
 the police are also in pursuit. With every man's hand   
 against them, Steve and Anne must repeatedly abandon    
 their temporary refuges. Finally, one midnight, the     
 showdown...
