[Sci-Fi/Extraterrestrial Post-Black Metal]


In early 2009 artist/writer and ex-vocalist
of Tokyo's Detritum, Jeremy Mauney, had the
idea to create a black metal band with sci-fi
elements basing song/lyrical content around his
own extraterrestrial research.

After posting classified ads online looking for
interested musicians, Jeremy was approached by
Roland La Goy (of Inlaid Rust and Molestation).
Ideas were exchanged, and NUTRITION was born.

The lyrical content of NUTRITION's songs
focus on detailed 'extraterrestrial' research,
