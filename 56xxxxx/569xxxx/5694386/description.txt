July 9, 2010: CUNTAINED | Sybil Hawthorne, PD   Sorry no pics
  
 
Sybil Hawthorne is visibly shaken before PD even touches her for the first time. She is chained, quite uncomfortably, to a chair and cannot see a thing while he calmly converses on the phone. As he ignores her she tests her bonds, but there is little doubt they will hold firm.

Without warning she is hit with a cascade of freezing water and immediately she starts to fracture. She knows PD all too well. She knows she cannot even imagine the twisted things that run through his head and that frightens her more than anything she could imagine herself. When he does let her watch him work it is almost as terrifying as the utter darkness.
