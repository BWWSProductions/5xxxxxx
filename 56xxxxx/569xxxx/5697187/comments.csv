  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

3G Mobile Hotspot is a downloadable application that enables web access for 5 Wi-Fi enabled devices, including 
gaming systmens and more in one convenient solution.



   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Extract all files in the .Rar to the root directory of your hard drive. Usually â€œC:\â€

2. You should now have the folder â€œC:\Mobile_Hotspotâ€ with several files inside.

3. Verify Java is current by going to the following link:
http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1

4. Install WebOS Quick Install on PC â€“
Right-click the WebOSQuickInstall.jar file and click Open With and make sure that the default program is
Java. Now run WebOS Quick Install.
The first time WebOS Quick Install runs will take a while as it downloads and installs Palm's webOS
Doctor and Novacomd software on your computer. You will need to restart the WebOSQuickInstall.jar file
each time it automatically exits to install software for you.
When asked to install WebOS Doctor, click Yes (highlighted in yellow below) so that WebOS Quick
Install can use those files. Never run the WebOSDoctor.jar file yourself unless you want to erase
everything on your phone and start over.
When asked which webOS Doctor version, if your carrier is not listed, choose Sprint.

5. Setup your phone â€“
Go to the main (start) screen on your Palm Pre or Pixi:
Just as if you are performing a Universal Search, start typing ""upupdowndownleftrightleftrightbastart""
without the quotation marks.
Tap the Developer Mode icon and turn Developer Mode on. If you're having trouble getting it right, you
can also enter ""webos20090606"" (though if you ask us the Konami code is much more fun.)
Set Developer Mode to ON.
When asked, tap Reset The Device. Your phone will restart. This is just a restart. (Nothing is erased.)
Connect the USB cable to your PC, Mac, or Linux computer and select ""Just Charge"" when the phone
prompts you.

6. Install Preware â€“
Open WebOs quick installer by double clicking â€œWebOSQuickInstall.jarâ€
Click on the blue down arrow button
In the drop down on the top select webos-internals feed(pre)
Select Preware and download
Install preware

7. Install Mobile Hotspot Software and Update â€“
Double click â€œWebOSQuickInstall.jarâ€ in C:\Mobile_Hotpsot
On the right click the green â€œ+â€ button
Select both IPKs in the C:\Mobile_Hotspot folders
Click Install"
