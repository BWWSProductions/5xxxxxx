GENRE ..............: Drama  Medical

Hawthorne takes place at Richmond Trinity Hospital in Richmond,VA., where the strong-but-caring
director of nursing, Christina Hawthorne (Pinkett Smith), continuously fights battles she often
knows she won't win. Whether treating the homeless woman in front of the hospital like a human
being or trying to talk a suicidal cancer patient off the ledge, Christina must challenge hospital
administrators, heartless doctors, apathetic colleagues and a system that sometimes
forgets it's there to serve the sick

Recently widowed and the mother of a smart, willful teenager, Christina juggles her career with
her equally important role as a single parent. Between the two, she barely has time for herself
and has difficulty keeping things together. But she knows she has to and can't give up on anyone.
That's what her passion requires it's what it takes to be a hero
