Novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) doesn't remember the blinding blizzard that sent his car spinning off the road. Nor does he remember being nursed back from uncosciousness. All he remembers is waking up in the home of Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a maniacal fan who is bent on keeping her favorite writer as her personal prisoner...for the rest of his life!
