,PleaseDontBanMe,2010-07-18T05:53Z,Will this work for online multiplayer once the crack comes out or will it be single player only?
,Luvarian,2010-07-19T01:39Z,"It more than likely won't work for multiplayer as Bliz has decided to remove the LAN play, and I haven't seen anything that can mimic a legit CD key that'll get past battlenet."
,Deflectant,2010-07-19T07:08Z,"Doesn't let me install. LoL

Says I have to wait to 7/27/2010. I tried to trick it by going offline and manually switching Windows to the date, but it said it needed an active internet connection. "

,hootieman,2010-07-20T02:51Z,This game is going to fail like Command and Conquer 4 did
,SatanicRU,2010-07-20T04:14Z,Why there is still no dvd version on pb? It is only week left until release so some guys must already have it :/ Hope it doesn't require anything beside simple crack which will be made in a few days to play in single mode :)
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-20T12:51Z,"There was a clone dvd on here its gone now. the link was 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5697488/StarCraft_2_Wings_Of_Liberty_Clone_DVD

And its not the Chineese working on a crack its the Koreans. if anything. theres not alot of chatter on there tho normally games on tpb get flooded with spam and flamers.
People are working on it some say they have it installed but lie they only get this far then hit ok then it fails.

,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-20T12:53Z,"Sorry for dbl post forgot to say this and cant edit.

@ hootieman

CnC4 failed be4 it even was brainstormed. nothing can fail as much as that game. the last CnC game i played that was good was generals. but CnC prime was when it was owned by westwood."
,SatanicRU,2010-07-20T14:07Z,"@ SIL3NTDE4TH

it was the same digital copy as here :("
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-20T14:28Z,"^ thats sad. I thought it would be.  it be funny if the Retail cd was only and Auto run, Install.exe and the 2-3 tomes."
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-20T15:51Z,"I hope a crack comes out. Early-est Wend's

But truthfully i dot think one will till  the 27th. 

A collectors Ed box was released early but he could not install till the 27th! The game requiring a internet connection is going to make it hard for crackers.

So if u can get around the Date "" that it gets from blizzard"" 

 to get the game to launch the installer you will see this
http://j.imagehost.org/0181/retailcrkV7.jpg

and when u hit install it Errors Out and needs A Decrypting Key "" that it gets from blizzard. ""

Stopping the game from contacting blizzard wont be hard after the decryption  key is released. and they can get the game installed.

The game wont even install if u change the date and turn off the internet.  The Game Requires an internet connection active just to install"
,WeD@,2010-07-20T17:08Z,"I hope there are lot of folks working on this.
First one to come up with crack will be more famous than Britney Spears :)"
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-20T18:00Z,"^ that is true.
But The First to crack it Be4 release date.

I don't think it be as hard after wards. "
,lordseger,2010-07-20T19:31Z,well considering that they cracked COC 4 wich requiers a internet conection i dont think this one will be any harder
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-20T19:37Z,I got that game. a few days be4 release from wall mart. i ddont remember it needing an active connection to install. just to play
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-20T20:40Z,"I don't understand why so many people  torrent this when u can download it for free from blizzard.
"
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-07-21T00:19Z,"DONT download that torrent ABOVE it contains Rootkit! (Trojan)

SIL3NTDE4TH please don't recommend things that could screw someone PC mate."
,Fr0zen_Junk,2010-07-21T03:22Z,"@ SIL3NTDE4TH
That torrent was taken down 3 times already.Most probably the uploader has multiple accounts,there were comments on the 1st torrent saying ""it works"" even though there were no seeders or leechers yet...The point is he's changing his user and making multiple comments,fooling others into downloading his trojan."
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-21T03:38Z,Not true. I been Rss feeding this site all day since i work at my computer. it first showed up around 4 hours ago.  and 1 of 19 scanned showed anything it had a chance of being real. but after talking to people in the thread its most likely fake.
,artlthepolarbear,2010-07-21T04:51Z,So am i don't really care for online but will the campaign work or is it set up that you need a Internet Connection at all times to play
,cheese101,2010-07-21T05:08Z,cracking this game seems very complicated...
,Fox201,2010-07-21T05:27Z,"Hey, thanks! Really looking forward to a crack!"
,Lucky13s,2010-07-21T07:26Z,"Wow are you guys fucking kidding me? Theres actually a torrent for this?

Blizzard has this up on their site morons, they've been allowing people to download it for awhile now.

No there is no crack, and there wont be, it 'must' be activated before it finalizes its installation - this isnt the entire full game yet, it gets patched on july 27th when its activated.

You're all wasting your time."
,shitfuckpiss,2010-07-21T08:12Z,well that's a little demoralizing
,asferot,2010-07-21T08:44Z,"@Lucky13s Implying I give damn about your ranting! I will wait, no matter how much time it takes!"
,Teirs,2010-07-21T08:48Z,"There is nothing at blizzard that says you will have to download a patch for it to work, and even if you do 7 more days and someone will get it activated and find that missing piece and reprogram it and paste it as a torrent to work. Also More then likely you will just have to get around the activation part. Soon as I get the money I am buying this game, which won't be till october which sux. But hey when I do I will be buying an origonal copy and fallout new vegas. "
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-21T14:04Z,"Q.) Will there be unique codes for shipped games vs digital games?

A.) Yes, both game client types (digital and physical) possess unique game activation methods.

AC.) If a player purchases the digital game client, the player will not receive a copy of the game activation key. Instead, the StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty game license will be added to the purchasing Battle.net account automatically. This is how World of Warcraft digital game clients function, as well.

AC.)If a player purchases the physical game client, the player will need to manually add the game activation key included in the boxed set to his or her Battle.net account. By adding the game activation key, the StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty game license will be added to the Battle.net account.

Q.) What exactly is region specific for activation?

A.) Game clients that are downloaded online or installed from the physical box set will only connect to the region for which they?re made. Therefore, in order for a player to log in and begin playing, both the StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty game license and the installed game client must be from the same region. If the game license and the game client don?t match, the player will be unable to login.

AC.) For this reason, we do not recommend using the early digital download option if you?re also purchasing the physical game client, as the risk of ending up with a game client that doesn?t match your game license is much higher. Please also note that the time saved by unlocking and installing the digital download is negligible when compared to the time required to install the game using the physical DVD.

Q.) Will I be able to use my shipped SC2 activation code on the digital installer?

A.) Once the game activation key is added to your Battle.net account and your game license is active, the option to download the client online will become available.

AC.) Please keep in mind, though, that if you try to download the game client early via the digital download option, you will want to make sure that the region of the game client you?re downloading matches the region of the game license that will be shipped to you later on. If your game license region doesn?t match the downloaded client?s region, you will not be able to login.

AC.) To clarify further, if a player purchased the North American version of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty from a store on July 27, he or she would need to ensure that the digital game client downloaded is also from the appropriate region (in this example, from North America). Otherwise, that player would be unable to login until the North American game client is installed.

Q.) Are there any differences between a physical copy of the game and a digital downlaod?

A.) I saw this question elsewhere, and thought it was worth answering here.

AC.) There are no differences in what each version of the game provides. All the files are exactly the same, but you obviously don?t get the box, DVD, or manual.

Q.) Is the activation code tied to its game client region, or is it just the game client that is region specific?, and if so, which is the key for matching it with your Battle.net account region?

A.) Game activation keys, game licenses, and game clients are all region-specific. As noted above, if your game license and installed game client regions don?t match, you won?t be able to login.

AC.) If the country associated with your Battle.net account (viewable in Battle.net Account Management: https://www.battle.net/account) is accurate, you should be directed to the correct regional download when visiting this page: http://beta-us.battle.net/en/info/digital-purchase

AC.) If you have already purchased a physical copy of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, but still wish to download early, you will need to make sure that the regional download matches the region for the physical game you purchased."

,repodepotman,2010-07-21T16:07Z,"My guess is this will make it difficult to crack until the game is released and the crackers have a chance to look at the packet exchange to emulate the battlenet authentication.  we might have to wait until the game is released to play it for free :P.

,maffti,2010-07-22T02:12Z,"@SIL3NTDE4TH
Your comment caught my attention... PIRATED games WORKS online, not on retail/legit servers but on private made, if not use hamachi over lan. Note: I did not say that all games work but most of them. But just like you say, SC2 will be harder to crack and near to impossible to get online games working."
,jobush,2010-07-22T04:00Z,"I think you guys should all go ahead and just buy the game. I asked a friend of mine to pick up the CE in the states while he's gone there for a trip.
It're really worth it."

This is going to be epically hard tbh"

,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-22T18:35Z,crack Crack... CRACK lol cannot wait
,jinzouningen,2010-07-23T21:55Z,"in offline mode it needs a regional only- auth code plus cd key and most likely means they need to match, and part of the game should not have to be patched from online otherwise people with no internet would be sol. possible still but shouldnt it be like cracking autocad, authcode generator sends back code and code translates to cd key ? just wondering ehe"
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-23T22:09Z,So if you do not have internet you cannot even install and play this game since it REQUIRES internet to verify release date etc. people pirate and crack because they dont like being forced to meet ridiculous criteria to even install a game.
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-23T23:53Z,Because I hate everyone especially the hackers I see in the first one characters running around i hitting every thing and infinite health on buildings characters etc. so all I will ever use this for is single player campaign nothing more.
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-23T23:58Z,The reason I pirate games is because once I finish the campaign which is usually way to short I dont play it any more to me playing the same levels or even new created ones is still to repetitious for me its like watching the same episode of some thing over and over again.
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-24T00:00Z,I donjt like playing with others due to cheating hacking assholes that dont shut up and I only like campaigns a game with a story not just senseless fighting 
,Scullyy,2010-07-24T00:01Z,if people cant crack the game that is a good thing imo
,mlgnom,2010-07-24T00:07Z,So if I get this right. This download will not let me play the single player since I have to wait for a crack which will probably arrive together with my legit version which costs me 25 GBP
,truestatic,2010-07-24T01:01Z,"Pat, plenty of people are amped to play the single player.  No need to talk trash about it.  Different people enjoy different things."
,igor584,2010-07-24T01:16Z,"OK. For the idiots that still hand around this torrent and shot at people for wanting singleplayer. The reason people want singleplayer is because there hasn't been a strategy game with single player worth mentioning in about half a decade, maybe more. And primarily people who are waiting for this crack are players of the original starcraft that want to see the story without having to smash the keyboard 300 times per minute, and pay half the game they wont play. Not everyone wants multiplayer, and blizzard has always delivered a whole game, single and multiplayer.
And not eryone has cash to spare for the game RIGHT NOW, so some of us want to play singleplayer before we pay and get on with the multi. Or create a few fun maps before that."
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-24T03:17Z,Damn right
,Camaris85,2010-07-24T04:19Z,"Fuck yea Igor! your fucking right! i been waiting 12 to kick kerrigans ass! and that patbateman asshole talking about multiplayer....jesus!!!!, maybe he is a korean freak!"

,jsummers,2010-07-24T06:39Z,"I bet the folks at Blizzard are reading all of this and laughing their assess off while we scurry about like rodents trying to get something amazing for nothing.

I am a pirate, so that may come off as hypocritical, but once in a while a piece of media, be it music, film, or videogame, comes along that deserves every bit of compensation for which it asks.

If Piracy and Capitalism are to coexist longterm, its going to take some concessions from both sides. As a community, if we were to admit defeat here and all go purchase this title, it would send three huge messages across the world.

1) We are not petty thieves.
2) We can and will give compensation for media that is truly DESERVING of it.

... and 3) We are a commercial and economic force to be reckoned with. We are many, we have conviction, and we believe in the consumer's right to choose.

We are the ones in power, not the MPAA or RIAA. If we make this concession and reward excellence, perhaps others will follow suit and put an end to the monotonous carousel of bland, recycled garbage media.

It's one thing to, in your own mind, be fighting the powers that be... it's so much more to actually change the world."
,totocows,2010-07-24T07:06Z,"A True definition of hardcore gamer is a person who can spend hours playing single player games. This isnt my own definition, its true. Alot of people will simple buy this game for the single player campaign. Hell at first thats all I wanted it for, until i got hooked on the beta. I pirate games that I do not think are worth the money of paying for. Starcraft 2 is a game that is worth the money it costs to buy it. If i wanted to play a super old mario game or something then I sure as hell wouldnt go buy an old nes and a game cartridge, when i could just download it off line in a second. I dont like to use my ability to pirate things as a way to get every thing for free. I just use it when I wouldnt buy the thing even if I couldnt pirate it. Every one should try and do things this way instead of Just getting every thing for free. If your a fan of something, pay for it. Here is a list of some games I have pirated with the pirate bay.

Resident evil - Code Veronica

The Legend of Zelda OOC

FEAR

The Sims 2

The Sims 3- i could have just borrowed this from some one i know but it didnt fell it worth the effort.

Alice 

warcraft 3- I one had a legal copy installed on my computer but lost it

Resident Evil 2

Thats pretty much it. But as I was saying, most of these games are very old and some can not even be bought for pc. Sure i could get other games that have maybe just come out for pc but i choose not to becouse I would be taking advantage of the People who made these games .

I kind of went on a rant there and maybe lost touch with what the main subject was about to begin with but, i still beleive that the ideals i have expressed are very important."
,liopoulos,2010-07-24T07:53Z,can som1 give clear instructions how to install this please?
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-24T07:53Z,I fully agree with if it deserves it buy it but most are not even worth the bandwidth to even download it.  I will download test hate it and trash it or go to the store usually online and gladly pay to play.
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-24T07:54Z,U cannot install/play not yet at least.
,somedude.1001,2010-07-24T10:38Z,"@pat.bateman

So according to you people who enjoy playing single player games are 12 yrs old newbs? Well fuck you then, Ive been playing video games since before the internet and likely before you were even conceived and now I still enjoy single player games. Most people of the older generation do.

And pat.bateman? (Pattrick Bateman?) What kind of jackass nick-names himself after a fictional serial killer?"

,sus2912,2010-07-24T12:46Z,"the game will be cracked but not before the release date becz skidrow the most likely group to crack it will require the packets and all to create a crack as he did for splinter cell,ac2 and pop without any problem.....so people can download this and can play the sp as soon as the crack comes out and it will come out in 2-3 days after release....while skidrow group will leave a msg on developers server hacked by skidrow :D......just wait and watch...there is nothing that cant be cracked now a days and the companies also knows about it as when asked by the media that how strong is ur protection the ans was not a single thing in this world is protected everything can be cracked the protection just give us some time and allow us to sale the game to the gamers who cant wait...certainly i can wait....about the multiplayer.....splinter cell was cracked and after using that crack i was able to play on ubisoft servers with legit copy person as i tried with my friend and i was able to get the achievements also and use the points to redeem something...:D so if that can be cracked this one will also be cracked doesnt matter if they need to create a simulator for it...they will crack it...and we will be able to play sp in 2-3 days and multi in 1 week or so....so who ever whats to buy it...go ahead and buy it but plz dont spam here that u should buy the shit and all...plz stop

so plz stop and if u have a legit copy of course after 27th play it otherwise wait for the crack for sp first thn mp soon..."
,Giblodyte,2010-07-24T12:53Z,Can you losers stop bickering about single vs multiplayer and american psycho. I don't want to have to look through 10 pages of bullshit comments just to find out if the crack has been released yet.

,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-24T13:41Z,"Where did u get skidrow from. There is not Guarantee skidrow will be the one that cracks it.
Both reloaded and razor have had to make there own installer in the past not just skidrow.

2-3 days after will be the earlyerst. Its going to be hard to take the INTEGRATED Battle net in the single player out. Due to at all times the game constantly is talking to blizzard due to The friends list and achievements.

And multiplayer. well That may happen eventually. but not a week. the PvPGn Team i be lave it took then a year or more. to make a fake battle net. for people to use instead of lan.
http://pvpgn.berlios.de/index.php"
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-24T13:59Z,"Just so people can see this on a new page of comments asking for a crack.

To crack this game Be4 The 27th will be hard heres why.

Active internet connection required
Needs Date And Time Auth From Blizzard.
But then when u get pasted that.

The game Is Encrypted and needs a Key ""Thats Region Pacific ""
The Decryption is also Region Pacific.
The Retail And Digital copy Both Use Different Encryption. and Different Key "" also Region pacific 

And after The 27th.

Then after the games Installed. Its Always Going to try to Connect to battle net. Due to It's Friends List Integration Into Single player. And achievements. You would have to play as a guest since it asks you to log in to battle net be4 u play the Single Player. so u can have your friends list.

So its crackable it will be hard. but we all know not be4 the 27th."
,Zakafein,2010-07-24T14:52Z,"I'd RARELY say this, but this is Starcraft ppl!!!  I'm so buying this."
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-24T14:52Z,"LoL your here? Wouldn't that make u One of them.
Im here in case a crack does come out. I did not down load this from here. in fact I diffident download anything at all. Because

1. I can Down load the correct one for my region Free from blizzard faster then this torrent.

2. If a Crack comes out It would have to be scene and Scene releases come bundled with the game. And for this game it would have to be a custom installer.

3. I payed 108.11 for the Collectors Ed Because Im a Blizzard But more Of a Starcraft fan.

If by small change a crack did come out be 4 the 27th Its just becasue im tired of waiting "
,MrTTAO,2010-07-24T18:20Z,"this is the uncracked game.
you need a crack to play this.

there will not be a crack for THIS release before the game is released, because it also has special DRM that requires an active internet connect to verifiy the date (after the 27th) to prevent installing before the release date.

There is no point for anyone to spend effort trying to crack a DRM that expires in literally 2 days, so they will just let this DRM expire, and spend their time and effort cracking the rest of the DRM.

Either wait for a different release that comes precracked, or wait until the 27th to get a crack for this release."
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-24T18:38Z,for people saying they are grown etc you need to grow up your selves I am 27 and have been waiting for a nother starcraft for YEARS be for they canceld starcraft ghost.

,daemon1129,2010-07-25T04:23Z,"@pat.bateman  What kind of fool goes to THE pirate bay to talk about not pirating...First of all, I don't give a fuck if this is the greatest game or not, if I want to pirate it, I will pirate it.  Not every single person are like you, lots of people pirate games then buy it afterward.  If you don't do that, that's fine, but don't think your opinion means anything to others.  Personally I have already pre ordered starcraft 2, but I wouldn't go ape shit because not everyone does the same thing as I do.  Plz grow up and don't go hating on pirates when your at their website.

,zullbar,2010-07-25T04:39Z,"They can Crack for you play Campaign, but a emulater for battle.net 2 is very hard to be make....
I think about 2 mounts or more after the game was playable on july 27!

So, wait the game on july 27 firts and 1 week for the crack be perfect or more..."

You can download this from blizzard legally

I also recommend using a program like 
http://www.peerblock.com/
Tell it to Block Schools. Government / Country's.
I run peerblock all the time. but i have a huge white list to unblock blizzard and Steam.

It will help if u run it be4 you start torrent. and untill all the red lines dissapeer when your done.
They can still ping your house i been pinged up to 30 min later."
,SIL3NTDE4TH,2010-07-25T14:04Z,"Also. If the torrent have a lot of trackers. only keep the ones you know or for the site.

,truestatic,2010-07-26T04:30Z,"Digital download is basically Blizzard's own torrent of the client, exactly like this file.  If you own a Blizzard game and have it registered to a battle.net account you can do a digital download through their downloader and install it with that, kind of like Steam."

Does anyone else get this? Is there a way to fix it? The installation shuts down after you press Ok."
,Ashukh,2010-07-27T00:09Z,"  You guys need to understand the difference between when a game has DRM and when it is ENCRYPTED. 
  Digital Rights Management software prevents you from playing a game (unencrypted) unless you have specific checks in place, once the DRM software in the game is satisfied with your authenticity it lets you play the game. 
  Encryption means that a game has all of its data jumbled up so even if you open it in a program, it is all a meaningless jumbled mess. The Starcraft 2 installer  is ENCRYPTED (the .MPQE parts), there is no such thing as a 'crack' for an encryption because there is nothing to bypass. They only way to decrypt the game is to put in the 30 digit alphanumerical key that blizzard will put out on the 27th. Unless you have the key or figure it out, you are not getting into the game files. Starcraft 2 is encrypted with Salsa 20 (and one other cipher)- a 256 bit stream cypher that is encrypting Starcraft 2. Trying out all the passwords (brute-forcing) for a 256 bit encryption would take a very very very long time for any PC, it will not happen in 2 weeks.
I hope you guys understand this and stop asking as to why a 'crack' for the installer is not out yet."

I wanted to try DREDPOOL's method so I followed the link.  I even created battlenet account to initiate download.  But that thing gave me login error over and over and now it says too many attempts.  Sigh.  (very discouraging and I wonder if it works now at all?)

So I haven't even installed the game yet.  I have your crack downloaded and took today off for some gaming... DREADPOOL's instructions seem little incomplete for my tech knowledge level.  

Stun, could you please walk us through once fully?  Sorry I have installed about 20-30 cracked games before but this is very different.

FYI - I'm a North American user with this EU version copy and the crack you provided.  ( I was able to unrar that crack so I don't need to get that fix file, yeah?)

1. Solution by Dzeko : http://user.xthost.info/dzako/Starcraft2.txt

2 For those who have problems with autenticating download :

use : http://capnbry.net/wow/downloads/WoWTorrentEx-4.zip , download it then drag iStarCraft_2_EU_en-GB icon on extractor icon (don't click it it wont work)

You should get .torrent file in folder.

Open it with normal torrent client let it create folder and start downloading for a while.

Stop this torrent

Close torrent software

Put orginal torrent Installer Tome 1.MPQ, Installer UI 1.MPQ and Installer UI 2.MPQ into this folder

Open torrent software again

Force check files

When it finished software should recognize that you have ~99% complete.

Start downloading missing 1%

Worked for me, sorry for my english i'm kinda drunk.

1. Go to Blizzard website and download the Digital Downloader/Installer

2. Install the game. When it asks you to activate, just press skip.

3. Download that crack that's been floating around.

4. Start SC2. It should update a patch. Once it is done, exit out.

5. Copy over the crack files to the locations listed in the readme of crack folder.

6. Start the game and enjoy!

Being vague only makes you hated and barraged by more questions, so do yourself a favor and be specific. Links, pl0x."

Works PERFECT!"
,stopngo,2010-07-28T05:25Z,"OK, for those that couldn't understand Analter's explanation let me give it a go:

1. Attempt Dzako's instructions FIRST: http://user.xthost.info/dzako/Starcraft2.txt

2. If that gives problems then download this: http://capnbry.net/wow/downloads/WoWTorrentEx-4.zip

3. Extract those files into a directory. Then get the downloader you got from Dzako's instructions and place it in the same directory as the extracted files.

4. Drag the downloader (which is named StarCraft_2_EU_en-GB.exe) onto the executable that you extracted (which is named WoWTorrentEx.exe)

5. This will create a .torrent file

6. Open this file with your torrent downloader (I use uTorrent) then once it is opened STOP the download. This makes the torrent downloader create the files for it to download.

7. Now copy your COMPLETE files from your ORIGINAL download into the new torrent download directory. The Files to copy are: Installer Tome 1.MPQ, Installer UI 1.MPQ and Installer UI 2.MPQ overwriting the files that the new torrent created.

8. Have the torrent downloader (uTorrent) force check the new torrent. Once that finishes it should say it's ~99% done. Let it finish that download.

9. Now try that installer and see if it works for you. 

I have tested everything but the installing of this way, so can't verify it works. But it looked like that worked for a lot of people."
,SaGgYmcGRILL,2010-07-28T05:42Z,"ok, stopngo is a cool guy.

I just checked blizzard website, and now you DO have to buy it in order to download the digital copy. Sorry, prior to the 27th, you could download it without buying a copy. 

I would just try another torrent, as this one didnt have an installer that worked for me"
,Fart Crack,2010-07-28T05:48Z,"@sargentb

that language pack error message pops up for me sometimes, but the game keeps on working. 

i never had the problem you had with it quitting out, and I've played about 7 missions.


Try the Starcraft 2--Repair option (its one of the choices in the Starcraft 2 folder in the bottom left Start button, I forgot what its called, sorry lol but you know what I mean).

It should hopefully fix the issue. Then just redownload the patch and redo the crack. "
,stopngo,2010-07-28T05:48Z,SaGgYmcGRILL: Did you complete the original download?? If so then I don't know why it would stop like that. What you could do is tell it to not download the MPQ files in the new torrent and only download everything else. Then copy the newly downloaded files to your MPQ directory. See if that works.

,desertlizard,2010-07-28T11:40Z,"I think the files in this torrent are corrupt. I did the torrent method to get the installer (instructions provided by stopngo earlier in these comments) but after I started uTorrent, shut it down, put the downloaded files from this torrent there, did the force re-check, and it started downloading the remaining stuff, I noticed that the big files were 99% complete. Here's a screenshot:
http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/4453/interestingo.jpg

Anyway, at some point either bunch of files got altered. But the fact is that now I got it installed without any problems (used to always get that long-ass ""error 2"" thing no matter what). Can't get it to start though, but I think that's because my computer (CPU specifically) is subpar. I get the initial wallpaper, and it reads ""initializing maps"" but I didn't have the patience to wait it out (assuming it would've helped). OR I managed to mess up something else.

Anyway, now it's at least installed."

Then follow these steps:
#1) Download this torrent file and r27
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5719797/Starcraft_2_Wings_of_Liberty_r27_FIX_-LiBERTY
#2) Before extracting the iso file, copy the ""lty-sc2ret"" from the r27 into the ""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY"" folder and then extract the iso out
#3) Using an iso reader software(I used alcohol 120%) and copy the files inside out to another folder
#4) Run the install
#5) Let Blizzard patch and update
#6) Copy the ""Battle.net-patch.MPQ"" into the ""Battle.net"" folder
#7) Copy the ""SC2.exe"" into the Versions->Base15405 folder
#8) Run ONLY the StarCraft II.exe file in the Starcraft folder, not the SC2.exe
#9) If you have an error saying ""Error opening Starcraft 2"", or it stops at 70% update, or asking you to pay for full purchase, go to Support-> Repair and after the fix re-do step 6-8."
,cousland,2010-07-28T11:49Z,"guys,quick questions.

do we absolutely HAVE to download 2 versions just to get this to work?
and what's with everyone having problems even if they do it right?
can you save MANUALLY thoughout the missions?"
,ferrari_freak,2010-07-28T12:04Z,"So far I don't think you can save manually.
Im having some issues in game.
My building shortcuts on the SVCs dont work- i.e. normally I would press B then S to build a supply depot but it doesnt work.
Also if I click on an area on the minimap I should be taken there right, not just ping it?"
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-07-28T12:14Z,"@cousland Answer is NO you don't need 2 version you can choose this one electronic download but crack is not included or the retail version with crack, and yes you need to save is manually."

THIS IS THE EXACT SAME TORRENT, BUT IT HAS SOME OF THE MISSING FILES FROM THIS ONE. Your torrent will ""check"" the missing files and should download from 99.4%, so it'll only take you about 5-10 mins to finish downloading.

2. load default setup to reset every OC values in your BIOS, especially MEMORY [Ram] must reset to default settings!
3. Save and Exit
4. Wait until your Windows boost up
5. Run StarCraft 2 Installer again and Vivo la!!!!! ITS INSTALLER NOW WORK LIKE CHARM!!!! YEAHHHHH!!!

for some reason, Bilzzard Installer are crap or something because its can't catch up my CPU and RAM overclocked so its failure to installation...

NOTE 1: this tips work for peoples who loved to overclock your PC by pushing hard CPU and RAM! so you need to reset them to default values first. When your installation is completed, just back to BIOS and set your OC again to maximize your performance of PC!
NOTE 2: for peoples who didn't OC, just try my tips to see if this work for you :) try to reset your RAM timing and clock would helps you
Enjoy!"
,Guttlecod,2010-07-30T14:33Z,"So somehow I managed to get rid of one error message, but now I got:

-Please insert the DVD labeled ""Starcraft II disc"". 

Any idea how to bypass this?
Or should I download Reloaded version (from scratch), like I should've done in the first place"

If you guy's cant use the MapEditor, then you've done something wrong. I can use it without any problems. "

,mlech,2010-07-30T21:29Z,"To fix errors with this torrent and crack it properly.

Step 1:  Download the Reloaded Torrent and follow instructions there.
Step 2:  If you already have downloaded this torrent,  be sad like me, delete this torrent, and download the Reloaded Torrent"

,Horwa123,2010-07-31T02:47Z,lol... man just start game from last save game and you can finish the campagin... dont start SC2 exe and that is it... -.-
,josh8673,2010-07-31T05:35Z,Thats what he is saying he is doing^^^  The problem is you still end up at the main SC2 home page where it blocks you out.
,XxMeccaxX,2010-07-31T06:20Z,"lol right, sry probably should of been more descriptive...anyways it keeps you at the main screen like josh said, but i read on another thread that after the 1.0.1 patch update, if you try to reapply the crack it should possibly fix the issue and you can continue playing saved/campaign. Havent tried... if someone has plz post and let us know"
,viwp88,2010-07-31T07:57Z,"As XxMeccaxX has said the new update will not let you play your saved games so just copy the crack back over and it will undo the update and you can keep playing till a new crack comes out.

Copy the ""Battle.net-patch.MPQ"" into the ""Battle.net"" folder

Copy the ""SC2.exe"" into the Versions->Base15405 folder"

Guess nothing is truly free anymore, the time I spent getting this far is still not worth it yet. Im getting to the update, but its failing at end because apparently my SC2 Editor is mismatch. I better be doing something wrong, it better just be the heat :P Help appreciated "
,HaI3,2010-07-31T09:23Z,"never mind, I got it working. It appears though when I transfer the crack, it starts to re-load the update and same error pops up about mismatch. It only goes though the entire update if you have original files. Then I started the game, but I need to create a battle.net account, even if I just want to play as guest. I keep thinking to copy the cracks again but then remember it re-updates. Still, help appreciated.."
,Firewolf5,2010-07-31T14:49Z,"Herrr, there is 1 thing that i cant understand.

Today i woke up, updated 1 more time starcraft 2 from blizz... and liberty crack stopped... than i came to install the crack all were speaking of... the reloaded 1, where save and load button appears and works. 

But now.. all new missions i go into only have the gameplay speed option ""fast to faster""
But if i load any other previous missions i?ve been trought, the normal and slower speed appear.

Anyone knows how to enable At least the ""normal"" speed? ;/"

,Darkly47,2010-07-31T20:48Z,"EDIT:
ok theres a torrent for AI skirmishes but the difficulty is set to hard, and you can control or team share much, btw though anti viruses will claim its a trojan though.

,CtrlAltLife,2010-08-03T09:18Z,moo
,dante22,2010-08-05T03:29Z,"""just follow (stopngo) informations:

1. Attempt Dzako\'s instructions FIRST: http://user.xthost.info/dzako/Starcraft2.txt

2. If that gives problems then download this: http://capnbry.net/wow/downloads/WoWTorrentEx-4.zip

3. Extract those files into a directory. Then get the downloader you got from Dzako\'s instructions and place it in the same directory as the extracted files.

4. Drag the downloader (which is named StarCraft_2_EU_en-GB.exe) onto the executable that you extracted (which is named WoWTorrentEx.exe)

5. This will create a .torrent file

6. Open this file with your torrent downloader (I use uTorrent) then once it is opened STOP the download. This makes the torrent downloader create the files for it to download.

7. Now copy your COMPLETE files from your ORIGINAL download into the new torrent download directory. The Files to copy are: Installer Tome 1.MPQ, Installer UI 1.MPQ and Installer UI 2.MPQ overwriting the files that the new torrent created.

8. Have the torrent downloader (uTorrent) force check the new torrent. Once that finishes it should say it\'s ~99% done. Let it finish that download.

9. Now try that installer and see if it works for you.

for me... its all work nice and when i do force check they stop checking on 95% not 99%... and you let them download that 5% for short time =))
and when torrent download missing files... just start instaler and that is all !!! work for me :D""

That totally worked for me too, thanks.
Awesome game btw, probally getting a copy to play bnet."
,MultaTuli,2010-08-06T11:15Z,"First of all, I want to thank everyone who's helping to solve all these problems many of us have. There are already many solutions posted for all kind of errors. 

There is though an unsolved problem some of us are having: What can you do if the installer prompts the message ""Please insert the DVD labeled Starcraft II disc"" ?

I'm using the ""StarCraft 2 Wings Of Liberty Digital Download-WW"" download to run the installer.
With DaemonToolsLite I mount the ISO downloaded from ""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY"", but still the installer is asking for a DVD.

(I've also tried to run the installer from ""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY"" but he's giving me the ""No installer data could be found"" error.)

So my question is: How can you get rid of the ""Please insert the DVD"" prompt?

Any help is appreciated!

but i managed to sort it out so it came up with my torrent programe and followed the rest of instructions it re checked it then added the missing files and when i clicked install it inatalled ... no error 2 crap ,
