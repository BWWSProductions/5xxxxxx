A: 9
V: 9

Some of the subs are missing.. but u can google em and paste it into VLC player. OR just learn a bit english will do. Its really not hard to understand.. Anyways. More seeds will help people get it too! They've earned it. ill upload it for a week or 2. about 600kb/s, not much but I got allot more stuff to seed."

tsMuxer, mkv2vob. xvid4psp and multiAVCHD also choke on these. Something wonky with the encodes. 

I needed to convert these to m2ts and finally was able to.
1. Extract AC3 with MKVExtract

2. Convert to mp4 AVI with MKVBoxer

3. Open AVI and extracted AC3 in MKVMerge. Select only the h264 and ac3 streams, merge to MKV.

4. Extract streams from new MKV with MKVExtract

5. Now mux the streams from previous extract with tsMuxer to an m2ts file. Be sure to change Change FPS to 24000/1001 and change level from 5.1 to 4.1

Crappy way to do it, but the only way I've found that lets me get my m2ts file and keep the original 6 channel ac3."
