A great deal of house music presented to you by Jeppelepsi.



I get tracks each day, mostly new stuff but sometimes oldies.
I will update weekly with new hot tracks so always download the latest torrent!
There will be new tracks in each torrent and instead of adding a new torrent with ALL my music over and over again, I decided to update only the new stuff. I will make a rar file and name them with "Husbehov Edit #X" (X=The higher number, the latest version) so that you who already downloaded an earlier version of my Husbehov will be able to know which torrent you will download next time.

All songs are 320 kbps but I use Audacity to cut songs where I think they should start. That's why in the description it says 128 kbps. The quality doesn't get worse, it only says so in the description.
