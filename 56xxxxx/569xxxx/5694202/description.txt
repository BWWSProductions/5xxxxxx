BALLADS (1962) finds John Coltrane's classic quartet (which includes bassist Jimmy Garrison, pianist McCoy Tyner, and drummer Elvin Jones) gathering force as a unit and turning their skills to a softer, warmer sound than is usually be found on the team's recordings from the time. Some critics accused Coltrane of capitulating to commercial pressures with this release, but that reaction overlooks the gorgeous performances on "You Don't Know What Love Is," "I Wish I Knew," and others. A beautiful album, and a great entry point for those who might otherwise find Coltrane's '60s work too abrasive. ~ CD Universe
