,jczak,2010-07-26T17:01Z,Make sure to mount the iso with Toast and not with Disk Utility. If you're getting no-cd errors that's why.
,Kthrnl,2010-08-23T17:16Z,"Can't make this work. Says: The path ""the sims complete.localized:the sims"" contains a slash (/), backslash (\), or period (.). Please remove the character from the appropriate Folder's name and try again.

What is it that I'm supposed to remove?? What have I done wrong??

Please help!"

,ntrs,2011-07-06T18:26Z,"this is awesome. works perfectly
just mount with toast titanium, you can find a free download just by googling.
does anyone know how to play this in a windowed mode? like 800x600?"
,dxmw,2011-08-05T06:36Z,"um, I'm running OS X Lion but I really want to play this version of the Sims - it will not work on OS X Lion though, will it? Since it's a PowerPC app and PowerPC apps are not supported on Lion anymore? "
,ArtieChoke,2011-08-15T05:31Z,"@dxmv

You answered your own question ;)"
,SpencersNoise,2011-08-21T06:50Z,"I'm also having the ""remove characters"" issue, can't seem to find a way around it. Anyone find a solution to this? I used Toast to mount, and everything seems fine other than this incredibly frustrating obstacle... I need my sims..."
,AmirZahir,2011-09-21T00:01Z,"Guys com on when you are having troubles with the issue......
.....""path ""the sims complete.localized:the sims"" contains a slash (/), backslash (\), or period (.). Please remove the character from the appropriate Folder's name and try again.""

Just drag and drop The Sims Folder to your desktop and then install from there...

But i already did that and it asked me to please place the ORIGINAL SIMS CD INSIDE.... TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION IF ANY ONE HAS ONE PLEASE ANSWER THANKS I AM ON A MACBOOK..... 
THANKS! :)  "
,AmirZahir,2011-09-21T00:07Z,OK UPDATE THIS IS ONLY FOR PC NOT MAC BULLSHIT ITS AN .EXE FILE THAT YOU NEED TO INSTALL FUCK THIS! :(
,andisa,2011-12-11T20:03Z,"this works perfectly, thanks!
just mount the iso file with toast titanium and then copy the whole folder ""The Sims"" to your computer (this is to solve the issue with the file name which contains slash, backslash etc)  and then go in that folder, double click on the file ""The Sims Complete"" and play! you don't need to install anything

cheers!"
,frankenpants,2012-03-13T14:44Z,"Got it working perfectly via the following:
1. Mount with Disk Utility and copy 'The Sims' directory to your local drive
2. Eject the Disk Utility mount and remount with Toast
3. Open the application 'The Sims Complete'

As others have pointed out, it'll only work on 10.6.x and below. If it doesn't - you may not have Rosetta installed (as it's optional). You can manually install it from your OSX install disc."
,RedbiT96,2012-04-14T08:54Z,"i can't seem to mount the image on toast, can anyone help? 
i mounted it with DU, but when i dismount and remount with toast, it doesnt mount, can anyone tell me how to do this with a bit of detail? it would be much appreciated :)... i really want to play this game"
,colindelong,2012-04-26T04:45Z,"I have tried just about everything to get this to work and I can't get it. It either says the path contains a slash, backslash or period when i try to open with disk utility or when I use Toast, it shows two images on my desktop. When I use one of them, it does the same thing as before and when I use the other one, it shows the application as an exe file. What the heck am I supposed to be doing????????? I even tried mounting with DU, copying files, umounting/ejecting, remounting with Toast...no go. I have Rosetta installed. Running Snow Leopard. Am I retarded?"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-05-04T12:27Z,it works but its not full screen
,RainsTK,2012-06-21T22:48Z,OMG its works what u have to do is download toast titanium then open the dmg file with it then mount it then drag the sims folder to your applications folder then go to applications and find the sims folder then find the sims complete and click it AND DONE
