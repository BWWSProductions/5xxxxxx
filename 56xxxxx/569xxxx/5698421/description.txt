        |   A collection of about 170 mostly commercial games for RISC OS.     |
        |   The collection is divided into three different formats.            |
        |                                                                      |
        |   ADF - These are disc images that work with Red Squirrel,           |
        |         Virtual A5000, Virtual RPC, Arculator and RPCEmu             |
        |         emulators.                                                   |
        |   APD - These are protected disc images that work with the           |
        |         Arculator emlulator.                                         |
        |   ZIP - These are standard zip archives that must be decompressed    |
        |         within RISC OS (to keep the filetypes) and will decompress   |
        |         with such programs as !SparkPlug and InfoZip. You can find   |
        |         a copy of !SparkFS in our previously-released Apps Pack 1.   |
        |                                                                      |
        |   Compatability of these games will be fairly random, some           |
        |   will be RISC OS 2 only, some RISC OS 3 only, some won't work       |
        |   on a Risc PC and some won't be StrongARM compatible and some       |
        |   will only work on the Risc PC or newer.                            |
        |                                                                      |
        |   Our thanks to the work of releasers TOSEC who had previously made  |
        |   some - but by far not all - of this material available before.     |
