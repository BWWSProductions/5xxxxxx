,drunkend1,2010-07-14T15:04Z,the above two comments are span don\'t click on the web address.
,drunkend1,2010-07-14T15:12Z,"nPS. if you like the game buy the original i only provide this for people who are unable to buy the original due to the game not being available in their country ie India and for those who cannot afford it, if you can spend $50 in clubs u can easily spend the same amount to buy the game so dont be a scrooge and buy the original if you have the means. n"
,f.e.a.r.m.e.,2010-07-14T17:11Z,is this game working now?rni stil got the old version but i cant find a good update..:( this one works fine?
,drunkend1,2010-07-14T20:14Z,with the new 1.3.37a release the game works perfectly but due to the update the player profile gets reset to level 1 so you end up loosing all your stats.
,f.e.a.r.m.e.,2010-07-14T22:36Z,ok thx but still its not very funny to get prestege 10 again and unluck all things it took me like 2 months...
,drunkend1,2010-07-14T23:16Z,"ya i know same story with me was up at 70 but then u could use a level hack if you really need your level 70 back but hacks are hacks and im ok with starting all over again anyways i always use the M4A1 what it lacks in damage power it covers it up in accuracy and range, works for me"
,alex1907,2010-07-15T01:00Z,i gonna try it i hope it works

,Driftingnfsc3,2010-07-16T06:59Z,wow....need more seeds ): there is only one..if i get this fully downloaded i will be seeding until there are a decent amount of seeders....apparently there is only one right now...if atleast ONE guy can finish downloading....and they don\'t be jackasses and leave without seeding a good amount...then this torrent will live...SEED DAMMIT!
,Sk8r2K9,2010-07-16T17:09Z,guys if it takes forever to dl try gettin the old version then using the manual update cache to update 1.3.37a trust me it will be much quicker
,Holdean1,2010-07-17T04:23Z,Could everyone change your upload to 20mbps :\\ I\'ve uploaded a gig already and most peoeple have done about 20mb.
,Driftingnfsc3,2010-07-17T06:32Z,"@holdean: i uploaded 4.54GB...cmon man, if there are only like 10 people donwloading this, this wouldn\'t take long to get many seeds...there are 154 leechers, and one seed..."
,drunkend1,2010-07-17T19:52Z,"people please seed i have uploaded 22gb of this till now but some how the seeds remain at 1, if you have completed your download please seed, at least get a ratio of 1 if not more"

,Sk8r2K9,2010-07-28T14:20Z,"i just started the game it says ""the beta for MW2 has ended"" is there a new update?"
,f.e.a.r.m.e.,2010-08-02T17:26Z,ya wtf is going on??
,drunkend1,2010-08-04T12:36Z,"the game has been updated again if you tell tell me what build ur on i could give you the new updates the game updates itself but sometime has to be updated manually the build version should be in the lower right corner of the screen, in the last week they have updated the game maybe 6 times so it can be a challenge keeping up with it"
,g-rom67,2010-08-07T12:32Z,"Hi, first thx a lot for this great torrent.
But when I launch the game (iw4mp.exe or AlterIWnetLauncher.exe) it says :
The main\iw_22.iwd file is incorrect. You might have used the 'Update' package while having an old version.
Click OK to be directed to the alterIWnet download page.

How can I fix it ?
OS : Windows 7 (64 bits)"
,g-rom67,2010-08-07T18:53Z,"iw_22.iwd problem fixed !

Open Device Manager (Windows key+R > devmgmt.msc). Find your network adapter. Uninstall the drivers. If your PC needs to restart, do so. If not, use Device Manager to let Windows reinstall the adapter's drivers again. Confirm that your internet works after the installation finishes and run MW2."
,deathsound95,2010-08-24T14:02Z,I hope this one works good because a long time ago I had alter and it was awesome.  I got a new pc now so I don't have it anymore.  I download pre-final alteriwnet from tpb and it works but it says that the MW2 beta has ended and I can only do pm.  want to play online.  Probably gonna buy the full version.
,AdvGamer99,2010-10-30T13:15Z,WOW!!! 1.5MBPS SPEED! I am amazed!
,pirate_blues,2010-11-10T21:38Z,"i just need AlterIWNet version 1.3.37a, Can u please tell me where can i get it. plzzzzzz"
,razor2281,2010-11-12T23:22Z,"thanks,great torrent it works perfetly...! THX I SEED"
,Mrsukurac,2010-11-23T21:23Z,"OK guys, I need help! :)
This is not working for me (win7 64bit). 

I extracted it, send the shortcut to desktop, but when I run it I get a window where I can connect to Official AlterlWnet Server (Status: Offline), and when I hit Connect I get a new window where I have only next options:
Play Online
Options
Main Menu
Quit

I don't want to play it online, and even if I want I cant! It it connecting forever to some server...

So what do I do? Is there any solution?"
,Mrsukurac,2010-11-23T21:26Z,"I forgot to tell you, if I choose Main Menu the game exits to desktop and I get an error report which says ""alterlWnet has stopped working"" !"
,LOLiverPB,2010-11-24T00:55Z,doesnt work. bullshit.
,drunkend1,2010-12-01T21:08Z,"@ LOLiverPB if you dont know how to...
