      Stand Up for the Week is a new late-night series of edgy
      satirical takes on the big stories and themes of the week, as
      seen through the eyes of some of the country's best comedians.
      It's hosted by Patrick Kielty, with a regular team of stand-ups:
      Rich Hall, Jack Whitehall, Andi Osho and Kevin Bridges; who give
      their uniquely incisive take on the week's politics, sport and
      celebrity news. Filmed at the Koko club in Camden, London, the
      show is recorded in front of a live audience with celebrities
      and politicians packing the bar. Plus, in a regular guest spot a
      topical public figure or celebrity guest has to endure two
      minutes in 'The Chair'. This new show is intelligent, spiky and
      above all, outrageously alternative.
