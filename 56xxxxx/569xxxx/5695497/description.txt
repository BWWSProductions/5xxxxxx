Vibe (8/94, p.116) - "...Jamaica's surest shot at America's R&B hit parade is so damn good that he even croons baby talk choruses...and actually gets away with it..."
Musician (8/94, p.90) - "...Hammond insinuates himself deftly within insistent melodies buoyed by bauxtie-heavy basslines and slick but not syrupy
 arrangements..."
