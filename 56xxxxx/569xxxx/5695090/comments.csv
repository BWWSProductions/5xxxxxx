,islandmonkeyjsy,2010-09-22T20:15Z,"I have this already.  I haven't downloaded this one, but the .img file looks the same.  The installer package is the same for ALL versions except Starter.  The key you use unlocks the additional features - if you install features your key doesn't include then they are installed as a trial.

Hope that helps!"
