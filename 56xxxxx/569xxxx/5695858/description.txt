Osho Musicians - Veeren

World Percussion Sample Library

Library contains several dozen of persussions.
Each instrument is recorded with several different articulations
(different kinds of hits). Some include up to 30 or so types of hits.
This makes it possible to play each instrument with much more
realistic range. In some cases, it will not be even possible to
detect if samples played in some piece of music are not real instruments.

For example, a conga set contains over 40 diferent hits.
On the top of it, several different conga sets were recorded
to give you even a broader range of sounds. Some of the best
congas, Sol, are presented.

The accent is placed not to create the typical hits you can find
in plenty of sample libraries, but to create a largest possible variety
of sounds.

Recording was done using some of the best microphones available,
such as Microtech Geffel UM-70 and AKG-460.

Recording was done directly to digital recorder.

These samples are copyrighted but permission is given to all Osho
musicians to use them for free. Who knows, may be one day...

Enjoy.
