Synopsis


Bachelor David D'Costa lives a relatively poor life in Bombay. He literally worships Member of Parliament Chaturvedi, and is even willing to die for him. He did not attend his mother's funeral as he was busy doing party work. Now David is married, his wife, Mary, is pregnant, his friend, Mahesh Sandaliya, a boot-legger, wants him to go to the hospital, and it is with reluctance that David accompanies Mahesh. He introduces Mary to Chaturvedi, and with his blessings they name their son James. Then one day while he was busy obstructing rail traffic, he gets arrested, is lodged in a cell, and is bailed out by Mahesh. When he returns home he finds that Mary has committed suicide. She left a note blaming Chaturvedi for molesting her. An upset David goes to confront Chaturvedi, is intercepted by Police Inspector Roop Kumar Sahay and Dr. Varma, the evidence is destroyed, and he is blamed for Mary's death, arrested, found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He asks Mahesh to look after James and teach him to hate and be a criminal. Twenty years later, David is discharged, he goes to visit Mahesh and is shocked to find that Mahesh has changed, he is no longer a boot-legger, he now lives a wealthy life-style, he wants David to forget the past, and live with his CID Inspector son James, who he has re-named Vijay. David is devastated with this news, but is determined to avenge his wrongful conviction and Mary's death, so he sets about to kill his tormentors one by one - the only obstruction he faces is none other than Vijay - who has sworn to protect all three men under any and all circumstances.
