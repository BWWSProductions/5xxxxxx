Africa's Lost Eden - Gorongosa National Park

It was known as 'the place where Noah left his Ark': 4,000 square kilometers of lush floodplains in central Mozambique, packed with wild animals. But 15 years of civil war took a heavy toll - many species were almost completely wiped out for meat. Today, conservationists battle to restore the park to its former glory, and save it from present-day threats that could destroy it forever.
