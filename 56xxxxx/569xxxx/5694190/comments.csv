,neDav,2010-09-14T03:36Z,"Video and audio 8, however this movie is a joke. It sucks to all high Hell."
,ffejrxx,2010-09-23T11:36Z,"this is way better than the actual film

,ianpark01,2010-09-25T22:50Z,marc09 where does it mention XOLWOX... it was uploaded by anonymous... torrents of such i never download anyway... pink & green skulls all the way lol
,ffejrxx,2010-09-27T08:51Z,"if you pick the pink skull for this torrent, it says XoLWoX"
,sean6528,2010-10-04T01:33Z,the video is 1mb over what a cdr will accept... why would you go to the trouble of downsizing a video to around 700mb for disc size if it doesn't fit?
,sean6528,2010-10-04T01:34Z,also now I get to wait like 30 mins to cut a bit off the end of the video so it will fit. great.
,dlectro,2010-10-05T17:18Z,"@ damostatus & neDav
What are you talking about? Video and audio quality 8? This rip is horrible, video is blurry as hell, and the audio contains a constant noise and cracking at loud voices. It's like a very lame VHS rip!"
,popo420,2010-10-22T17:41Z,"Video = 10
Audio = 10
Movie = -1000

Great quality torrent, audio and video both near perfect.

The movie is fu**ing terrible though"
,healthygrillingtomatoes,2010-10-29T13:44Z,"A-8 V-5

I played this on both VLC and Media Player. The video framerate is off and looks choppy and is quite noticable but still watchable. I have no other problems with any other downloads.

PS this movie is fucking disturbing."
,DesolateBeauty,2010-12-18T07:25Z,"Perfect download!
Video=10
Audio=10
AND it even has subtitles for the asian guy, which is VERY rare to find on here! Thanks!!"
,Punkertjeuh,2011-01-02T21:54Z,"Video is choppy and I don't think this movie is worth downloading a 6gig blu-ray seed.
Popcorn horror movie, you probably never want to see it again after the first time.
That pretty much covers it.
But hey! that's mine opinion ;-)"
,curfewz,2011-01-24T20:02Z,"Great torrent!  If you are VERY VERY VERY picky with A/V then you might want to find another link.  For me, this was perfectly fine.  All I care about is that the movie is watchable and not a dirty cam.
A: 8
V: 8"
,Cesmo,2011-03-31T14:44Z,"Pretty good torrent no virus.
A q:7
V q:6"
,Mayuri,2011-04-14T02:45Z,The only problem that I have with this rip is the quality of the video. It doesn't appear to be DVDRIP. It's just too poor of a quality. If you don't care for the quality then this is for you. The English subtitles are good for the none English spoken language.  Oh and for those people who want to talk down to this movie... why are you here? If the movie sucked so much then why do you bother searching for a download? These kind of pages are for the fans. Fuck off if you're a hater. THIS MOVIE ROCKS! Way to go Dieter Leser aka Dr. Heiter!
,iamhelix,2011-04-26T06:51Z,"the shock value only gets you about 15 minutes of viewing time, after that the movie is no longer entertaining in the slightest, its like 1000 other horror / gore movies and below average on the plot."
,Skruzer,2011-04-30T12:57Z,"not bad quality for 700mb, very quick download. only took about 10 minutes"
,hallumet,2011-05-01T21:22Z,The video quality is horrible. Not worth downloading. 
,tengeta,2011-05-10T10:01Z,Normally I don't watch this kinda shit but after that South Park episode I've thought the scenario through enough times that I probably can't be that bothered by seeing the actual film.
,AFCRyan,2011-06-07T18:11Z,Not a great DVDRip if I'm 100% honest ... Thank you all the same uploader.
,ziki,2011-06-20T00:19Z,"the video is lagging :( choppy on VLC and on SONY home theatre as well...
thank you for the upload, but I can't recomand at all."
,kane1314,2011-10-07T20:05Z,"The quality of this is great, both on my lap top and PS3, so if your having a problem its the device your using to watch the movie not the movie itself."
,fluster84,2011-10-15T15:22Z,"The video and audio quality is terrible for a 700MB dvdrip.. I dont why so many people are rating it as 10/10

V 4/10
A 5/10
M ?

Havent watched the movie yet.. So just played it for like ten minutes and turned it off. There are much better quality rips out there."
,JakeThe44,2011-10-15T21:50Z,Okay quality... Movie is a waste of life and energy. F-in garbage.
