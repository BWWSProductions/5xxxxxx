
Since yesterday I am using another userid to upload my music video files as Pirate Bay has cancelled my old userid for reason unknown previously.

Dutch Top 40 period 2003-2004 DVDRip [SH@R].avi

This file is especially uploaded for the Dutch people. At that time the Top 40 was (and still is) very popular. The songs are all of the period of 2003 to 2004, some of the video clips are in black/white and most songs are play backed.
