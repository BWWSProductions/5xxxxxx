,FernFrond,2010-07-12T22:04Z,I remember this game. It was fun. I did glitch where  you fly on a grenade against a wall all the time in that game but the hackers ruined the online play so I just hacked to not die from them flying around and shooting rapidfire bazookas and skyrunning etc which made it unwholesomely fun since I couldn\'t die. If I turned it off they pwnd me.
