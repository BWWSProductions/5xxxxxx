...................................NFO:.................................................Ice.Road.Truckers.S04E05.Trapped.on.Thin.Ice.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM


Jack Jesse rushes to save an Alaskan town with an emergency fuel 
delivery, but a blinding storm stops him cold on the thin ice of 
the frozen river road to Nuiqsut. Lisa Kelly gets her big chance 
to step up when she's given her first oversize load, but as she 
battles the elements and the law, Lisa wonders if her trucking 
skills are up to the test. Ray takes a night run as a favor for 
the boss, but he makes a trucker's worst mistake when he reaches 
for something on the dashboard. The rubber meets the road when 
Alex's trash talk stirs the sleeping Polar Bear and a hell bent 
Hugh Rowland races to Coldfoot to even the score.
