Louis Prima (7 December 1910[1] ΓÇô 24 August 1978) was a Sicilian-American singer, actor, songwriter, and trumpeter.
Prima rode the musical trends of his time, starting with his seven-piece New Orleans style jazz band in the 1920s, then successively leading a swing combo in the 1930s, a big band in the 1940s, a Vegas lounge act in the 1950s,
and a pop-rock band in the 1960s. In each of his musical endeavors, he incorporated his exuberant personality into his act.
In 1967 Prima's distinctive voice and jazzy delivery landed him a role in Walt Disney's animated feature The Jungle Book, as the raucous orangutan King Louie.
