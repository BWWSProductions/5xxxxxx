It saves you writing up a list of whats in the torrent as well.  If you ever do a repost where I can see what I\'m getting I might download it but I won\'t bother downloading 16 gigs when I have no idea if I already have whats in there or if the rar file will even open.nnThanks anyway, but I won\'t download this.  Good luck with your next torrents.  Try to make a list of what you have next time or leave it uncompressed so people can see what\'s inside and take what they want."
