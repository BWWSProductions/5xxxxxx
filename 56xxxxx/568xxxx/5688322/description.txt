The Alex Jones Show
Monday, 12 July 2010

:: NOTICE ::

Today is the day Alex changes from a 4 hour format to a 3 hour format for his weekday broadcasts.
He announced this with little fanfare on-air July the 1st, he needed the extra time and energy for working on his current film [re: chemtrails]. He did not say if then or since whether this was to be a permanent change.

It seemed today that even Alex himself was a little confused by the change.  At the end of the final [3rd] hour, he said: 
"Coming up in the next hour I'm going to get into all the military take-over drills, Marines on the streets of L.A. This is mainstream news, MSNBC. That's coming up in the next hour."

That confused me a bit too, so I checked on the Prison Planet Forum and found an "official" posting there stating:
"Alex Goes Back to 3 Hour Weekday Shows Starting July 12, 2010 -- But ALL 3 hours will be televised live at www.PrisonPlanet.tv."

Please check my blog for a little further discussion of this.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
