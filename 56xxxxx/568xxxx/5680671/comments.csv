Thanks for the upload!!!"
,pradlo,2010-07-25T06:25Z,"It's easy to enable cheats (on R4) for this specific rom dump.

Just download R4CCE, use it to edit the cheat file and change the identifier for Dragon Quest 9 (US) from ""YDQE 23A95403"" to ""YDQE 6692DAD2"".

Then save the file, put it on your SD card and cheats should be available."

Yep I was just about to post about changing the above for cheat purposes :) and this works on R4 am using that as I can not get Ysmenu to work with cheats o almost forgot al upload the ysmenu moonshell combo on the weakend :P"
