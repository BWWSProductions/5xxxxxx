Morehall Water Gardens and Fishery was once a successful garden centre, with fishing ponds with an on site cafe, but one of the owners pulled out of the partnership and business was too much for the only owner and he sadly closed the site. 
But it has now re-opened and living a new life as a day ticket fishery with match bookings available.
Morehall Fisheries has either a 10 peg or a 15 peg pond available for matches. These can be blocked booked for club matches.
Morehall Fisheries is located between Deepcar and Oughtibridge on Manchester Road (A6102).
There are currently 2 ponds available to fish and they are the largest ones in the fishery. Although I am aware that the other 2 ponds should be available to fish soon. 
The ponds are well stocked with Carp, Bream, Roach, Ide, Golden Orf, Rudd, Chubb and Tench there are fish weighting from ┬╛lb to 7lb upon last stocking (April 2010)
Morehall Fisheries is a very peaceful and friendly site, it is well maintained and looked after. 
The site is open 6am while 10pm 7 days a week and is always manned.
There is plenty of parking available which can be seen from the majority of the pegs.
There are female and male toilets available on site and also tea and coffee is sold.
I also believe the bailiff will allow night fishing upon request.
