,TheEmpathicEar,2010-07-13T02:58Z,"Hmm, can someone confirm?"
,stormvader,2010-07-13T08:35Z,Is this only for 180 days or is it permanent?
,user41263,2010-07-13T15:04Z,is it for Volume License or Retail?
,epdm2be,2010-07-13T16:15Z,The readme says its only for volume license.
,epdm2be,2010-07-13T16:16Z,stormvader: the readme also says that you have to re-run the activator after 180 days. so it\'s obvious its an 180 activator.
,CRimsonEagleX,2010-07-17T01:19Z,"This is a 180 day activator. Btw red, in my AVG paid version the KMS Activator is comming up as a threat - \""potentially harmfull crack\"" Your uploads are safe and I just want to remind everybody that this is a safe download and that I fixed the issue by letting Resident Shield allow the exception incase anyone has gotten stumped."
,CRimsonEagleX,2010-07-17T01:30Z,But can someone please tell me why I am only activated for 30 days?

,LightTheRebellion,2010-11-03T19:03Z,"I downloaded one of these Windows Office 2010 activators that contained a Trojan that was activated on October 29th.

It was CycBot, which attempts to clone your system using CRC checks and ***CANNOT BE CLEANED/REMOVED*** I used four programs, including Microsoft Forefront, which is designed exclusively for businesses, and it was still there.

BE AWARE OF THIS AS YOU WILL HAVE TO REFORMAT YOUR HARD DRIVE."
[T],RedHatcc,2010-11-18T03:06Z,"Just a note, if anyone can provide me with proof that my torrent(s) contains a virus, I will remove them.

It is very common, VERY common for certain patches/cracks/fixes to contain similar functions as a virus. Some of the best cracks from the top groups almost 50% of the time will fail a check at virus total. 

If you feel insecure, do not download, if the pink skull means anything, just seed and enjoy. "
,derelikt,2010-12-28T10:50Z,Works perfectly. Be sure to extract both the mini-KMS_Activator_v1.053.exe AND office.sfv.  Both files are needed for installation.  Thanks Red!
,shilalydawg2,2011-02-14T17:16Z,"KMS services always show up as false positives with most anti-virus programs. If you don't trust his pink skull, don't download. It's there for a reason.

Great upload. Thanks a ton."
