Fun Facts

Starting when The Angels were a pub band their song "Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again" has received an iconic response from audiences. Whenever Doc Neeson sang the words of the Angels' classic love song 'Am I Ever Going to See Your Face Again?' back came the ingenious response: 'No way, get f**ked, f**k off'.[14]

Whilst outside Australia this may have been seen as a negative response, from an Australian audience and in the context of the Australian sense of humour this was recognised as high praise.
