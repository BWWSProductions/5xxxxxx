Konashine I hope you can fix this error and let us know so we can actually DL the files. I appreciate your hard work and will retract my comment once the issue has been resolved. Thank you again and we look forward to seeing more of your work"
,Lixifer,2011-03-06T12:27Z,@ zepplyn:  There are many seeders and the files are downloading fine so the problem must be on your end I'm afraid.
,mancbhoy,2011-03-12T19:29Z,"just downloaded this no problem good sound and video (audio is english) @zepplyn element not found is a problem at your end i think its something to do with the location of were you save your downloads or sumat, Thanks for the upload  Konashine, downloading season 2 aswell :)"
,klaximopark,2011-06-23T12:31Z,This torrent is all good - thank you!
,DoABackflip,2011-07-10T07:26Z,101 files? wtf
,Saki33,2011-09-08T17:15Z,"@ DoABackflip It's only 8 files if you select just the vids or 16 if you include the subs. 

I also am puzzled by the inclusion of all those extra torrent files but no need to include any of them in your download. "
,JarlaLeach,2011-10-16T21:53Z,"A couple of the English subs are out-of-sync, but that was fairly easy to fix with Subtitle Edit."

Audio is really low though, and particularly the voices are low, so you gotta turn it up real loud."
