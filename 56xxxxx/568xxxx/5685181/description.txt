Synopsis

Domingo plays Paula (the daughter-in-law of PareÃ±oâ€™s original character) who has her own business of fake bags available on the net. Sheâ€™s married but is fighting the urge to have an affair with her delivery driver. Gutierrez is Marilou, a beauty queen and a recent widow whoâ€™s now in a fierce battle with her late hubbyâ€™s relatives over inheritance. Cristine Reyes is Wendy, a promo girl whoâ€™s always on the lookout for wealthy customers and blind to the sincere affections of a man of simple means. Mercado plays Ada, the illegimate daughter of Sabel (played by Locsin). Ada is your typical career-driven woman except that she is also a single mom to a young boy which she barely has time to take care of; thus she enlists the help of her mom. Calzado is Tere, a nurse whoâ€™s nursing a broken heartâ€”howâ€™s that for ironyâ€”who now faces the dilemma of taking care of the girlfriend of the man responsible for her heartache. King plays a spoiled brat who gets a bitter taste of real life when she begins work as a junior PA at a TV network. Also in the cast is Cherie Gil, Mylene Dizon and Eula Valdez.
