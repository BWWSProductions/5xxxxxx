PrisM Notes:
Right....this is NEW LINE Audio and sounds pretty sweet it has NO CAM AUDIO in so a proper TS. now onto video.
pretty poor all round to be honest...saw few different cams, even had a 720p HD Cam of it, but has a bad crop on the right :(, so we chose this video, 1stly fixed all the colors to what i thought balanced them through the movie, still not perfect but...tweaked both the brightness and the contrast as source was not very black and was more blue. Tried a different and new video denoise seem to do a good job...added a Slight sharpness filter but not to much, and some other random stuff anyway enjoy nice TS, we filtered the line sounds pretty good....and a really good job to CrackmaN for another good sync took him 10Minutes :D

credit PrisM & UPLOADERX BIG BIG BIG TIME & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
