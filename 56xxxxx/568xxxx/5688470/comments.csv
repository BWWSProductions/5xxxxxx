,Lassik,2010-07-14T11:36Z,"Wow... This actually pissed me off. The quality starts off at about v5/a8 but then towards the middle of the film it goes to v1/a8 and stays that way for basically the rest of the movie. It gets so blurry that you might as well be just listening to the audio because you can barely make anything out. nnWhat pisses me off about this is that you get hooked in to the story and then the video goes to shit. Had I known that this was going to be half-movie-half-audiobook, I wouldn\'t have bothered.nnDon\'t get me wrong, I don\'t hold anything against the uploader or the guy with the camera. I really appreciate the effort. I just wish I had of waited for a better copy. My suggestion to anyone interested would be to wait."

Jeez.....

A/V ok to about 50% of the film, after that we see the camera trying to obtain focus during the dark scenes. (who are plentiful)"
