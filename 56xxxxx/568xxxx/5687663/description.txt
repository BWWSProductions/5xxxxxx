Endgame (sometimes capitalized ENDGAME) is the twelfth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth. Released on September 9, 2009, it is the first album featuring guitarist  Chris Broderick, following Glen Drover's departure in 2008. It is also the band's last studio album with James LoMenzo (although he will be featured on the upcoming Blood in the Water: Live in San Diego DVD).

The album debuted at number 9 on the Billboard 200. Two successful singles were made for Head Crusher and The Right to Go Insane. The latter song in its peak reached position 34 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. On December 3, 2009, it was announced on the official Megadeth homepage that "Head Crusher" had been nominated for "Best Metal Performance" for the 52nd annual Grammy Awards, the band's first nomination in 13 years, since Trust.

On March 18, 2010 Endgame was officially declared gold by the NAPC, selling over five-hundred thousand copies worldwide (which makes Endgame the bands best selling record since 1999's Risk). "Endgame" has sold 125,000 copies in the United States since its September 2009 release, according to Neilsen SoundScan in April.
