,pixiesmiles,2010-07-15T09:29Z,"TKBrand,  download a little free utility here:  http://www.7-zip.org/download.html  called, \""7-zip\"".  It is well known and many people here use it.  After you finish downloading all of the files in the Huge.S0103.Live (etc) (and after you have 7-zip installed), double click the file ending in .rar. 7-Zip will pop up, tell it to extract the file (I normally point it to my desktop as a place to store the extracted file).  When it\'s done, go to your desk top and look for your .avi file.  Then play it in windows media player. :)  (if there is no .rar file -which in this torrent, there is-, the best way to extract the rar files is to select all of the files, right click and tell it to extract in 7-zip. From there, follow the same steps.)nnHope that helps. :)nnnscenebalance... thanks for the torrent.  Much appreciated!"
