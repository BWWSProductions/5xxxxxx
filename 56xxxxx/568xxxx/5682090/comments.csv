[V],phatwarez,2010-07-12T13:26Z,Sure right after you buy me a new computer and HDTV service. It takes me 4 hours~ to encode a single 45 minute documentary. I don\'t have time to go back and re-encode it if I miss some setting like aspect ratio. You can easily change your playback settings. Source is 352x240 NTSC broadcast tv.nnIf you can do better on 8 year old hardware while still fitting under 350mb lemme know. Otherwise please don\'t spam all my torrents saying they\'re shit.
