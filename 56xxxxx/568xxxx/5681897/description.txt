Gangsters: Rayful Edmond III

Drug kingpin. Born Rayful Edmond III on November 26, 1964, in Washington, D.C. Edmond's parents, Rayful Edmond, Jr. and Constance "Bootsie" Perry, were both government workers who moonlighted as drug dealers. Perry, who heavily doted on her seven children, began teaching Rayful and his siblings how to deal narcotics and prescription drugs while they were all very young. Rayful was pulled into the drug trade at the age of 9.

School proved to be a respite for Edmond, and the young man flourished in the classroom. A good student and talented basketball player who was popular with his classmates, Rayful was on the fast track to college. His life at home, however, drew him further and further away from a promising future. By the age of 18, he had already dropped out of college to make easy money cutting cocaine for a local dealer.
