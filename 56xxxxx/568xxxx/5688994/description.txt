PLOT
TIME OF THE WOLF reunites award-winning French actress Isabelle Huppert with director Michael Haneke after the international success of their celebrated film, The Piano Teacher. In addition, TIME OF THE WOLF features an A-list cast of France's top actors, including Olivier Gourmet (The Son, Read My Lips), Beatrice Dall (Betty Blue) and Patrice Chearau (the director of Intimacy and Those That Love Me Can Take The Train). An extremely timely and prescient piece of social commentary, TIME OF THE WOLF follows a family's difficult journey immediately after an unknown apocalyptic event. Haneke never tells us what happened, or where, or when, but instead puts us directly into the terrifying aftermath, with all of its confusion, uncertainty, and danger. As all social laws and codes are suddenly overturned, Haneke asks us to find our own way through. TIME OF THE WOLF is Haneke's most intense film and also his most hopeful.
