Though likely no one is buying a Nine Inch Nails concert disc for power ballads and jazzy lounge numbers, the set list does a fairly good job of balancing out the most hardcore numbers with a few slower bits, lesser-known album tracks and the \""poppy\"" hits, like \""Head Like a Hole.\"" But the biggest risk of all is that Reznor refuses to turn the show into a hit parade, playing just about every track off the band\'s most recent album -- 2005\'s \""With Teeth.\"" It\'s a gambit that works, as the crowd eats up every song. Whenever Reznor does finally decide to call it quits, one thing is for sure -- he won\'t go out quietly.nnThe track list is as follows: 01. Love is Not Enough / 02. You Know What You Are? / 03. Terrible Lie / 04. The Line Begins to Blur / 05. March of the Pigs / 06. Something I Can Never Have / 07. Closer / 08. Burn / 09. Gave Up / 10. Eraser / 11. Right Where it Belongs / 12. Beside You in Time / 13. With Teeth / 14. Wish / 15. Only / 16. The Big Come Down / 17. Hurt / 18. The Hand that Feeds / 19. Head Like a Hole."
