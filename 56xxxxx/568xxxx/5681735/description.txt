Work done:

Here we go with our version of Predator.Thanks to IMAGINE for the audio.Not the greatest
cam to work with.Its a dark movie to begin with but we think it came out pretty good.
we adjusted the aspect ratio and so forth.now we wasnt going to do it but with all the pms
we said why the hell not so here it is.did normal stuff we always do brightness,contrast,
saturation.black levels ect.Now we used the same audio as imagine so it has the same 
cam audio in the same places.hope you all enjoy.from team flawl3ss.
