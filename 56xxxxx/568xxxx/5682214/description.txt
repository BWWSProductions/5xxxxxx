GSA Cleandrive description
A software application that can help you to get rid of most of the privacy violations you get each day.

It is a common problem that almost anything that you do on your PC can be spied out by others. There is a wide market where money is made by simply tracking your online behavior and habits (what you like to search for, what sites you surf,...).

If you don't want that your privacy will be fully destroyed, you should do something against.

Privacy Protection

It deletes all internet traces (like the web sites you have visited), recently opened files (like your last played video files) or even the logs that show what programs you have run lately (for example a game you have started in office). This award winning antispy software deletes your history of activities on your PC. Erase tracks that could be used to steal your identity (Identity Theft - someone else pretends to be you).

System Optimization

The program will help you to make your machine faster. The longer you have a system, the more programs you install, the slower your system will become. By cleaning up unused files and temp directories of your applications, it will result in a much faster and stable system. You will be surprised how much more free disk space you will get after a cleanup.

Fast Analysis - Easy to use

GSA Cleandrive is extremely fast. You can cleanup your system within seconds (depending on your configuration). The program is available in 26 languages (Arab, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Malayan, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish) to make it easy for you to use all the unique features.
