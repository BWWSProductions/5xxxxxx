Spent quite a bit of time looking for a rip of this, to no avail - purchased this off a seller on discogs and away we go!!

Beautiful endeavor from a few of the Air Liquide boys Jammin' Unit & Walker + Rising High alumni Caspar Pound & Laurence Elliot Potter!!

I encoded this in FLAC for the purists + High Quality [192-320kbps] VBR Stereo MP3 - simply tick the box(es) with the folder(s) of files you wish to download and torrent this little rarity.

Please ask questions or use your favorite googler if you're not sure of what to do with these files.  Question, comments & uprates always welcomed...

As always, seed seed til your eye dem bleed!

much love,
frosty
