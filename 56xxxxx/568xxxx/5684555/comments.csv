,hijklmn,2011-03-26T17:56Z,are these the edited versions from the-N or the non edited mtv versions?
,hijklmn,2011-03-27T23:30Z,"good quality video and sound. and it is the un edited version. the only problem is unlike when daria was aired on tv and they had popular songs from the 90's and early 200's as insert songs and ending songs, they are now all replaced with some generic music, which im guessing mtv did when making the episodes for sale for dvd. and season 1 ep 3 and for are misnamed. ep 3 is college bored, and ep 4 is cafe disaffecto.

thanks for the ul!"
