Release Notes:
Right very late on this release but still a few want it, came out a touch small wanted about 1gb but never mind. but wanted
quite small as quality is very poor, anyway, used imagines first 2minutes as they encoded it from the darkinnocence cam.
mux to the video then encoded video, used a heavy smoothness filter on it, tweaked all the colors, but they change throughout
so it's pretty hard to get the same sort of color throughout, added a slight sharpness filter onto it and video denoise.
also used a brightness and contrast filter to try and get rid of some of the brightness, but it didn't do to much but some effect.
used a deblock filter and some other random stuff. first few minutes have black bar, ive left them their so you have the correct 
resolution throughout, with no bad AR. anyway done some other stuff to it also can't really remember encoded it few days ago.
was waiting on a HD cam but it didn't come through . Anyway take it or leave it Enjoy!
