IMAGiNE NOTES
Right sources used were the russian dvd9 and the sweet line audio we were given by TA ....thanks to all
Well the audio was sweet,j ust done a little tweaking as it was abit too loud and what not.
The video source was nice, like most R5's but need that little tweak here and there.
Work done......firstly we ripped the video with a simple little script we made, using crop, resize, white balance, sharpness etc...
Then we resynced our audio we were given ... also added the russian audio track for the end credits.
Now we've grabbed a few and noticed some oos parts ... check around 53mins, roughly 200ms oos. In all honesty we grabbed them to use instead of resyncing from scratch, hence the reason we noticed the oos parts, so in the end we redid the sync ...
also hence the delay getting this out.
