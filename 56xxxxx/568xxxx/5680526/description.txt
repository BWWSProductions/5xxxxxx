Encoded by 20-40 (twentyforty) and uploaded by me at his request on his behalf. Please enjoy and know that 20-40 wants to be uploading torrents himself but his PC is dead.
The torrent was encoded on an old PC that crashes every 10 minutes and still he persevered and made this file.

Please go to his page and read comments on Craig Ferguson shows torrent. Please consider donating to getting him a new PC and back doing what he does better than ANYONE else.

A fan, 
Jon
