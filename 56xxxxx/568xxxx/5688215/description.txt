A hundred sixty miles off the coast of Baja California, a 
team of world-class anglers will land one of the most challenging 
fish imaginable: the great white shark. Unlike any other catch ever 
attempted, they'll lift an SUV-sized shark onto a platform, mount a 
long-lasting tracking tag by hand, take measurements and DNA samples, 
and release it unharmed... all within minutes. Marine biologist Dr. 
Michael Domeier uses advanced tracking devices to help uncover how 
this predator lives, with the ultimate goal of conserving and 
protecting this endangered species.
