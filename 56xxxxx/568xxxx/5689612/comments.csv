,famemon78,2010-07-13T15:56Z,Brother u keep uploading new stuff at the rate of knots ! which is great but u should keep an eye on ones that are left incomplete due to lack of uploading on ur part. Im specifically referring to Numb3rs S5 D3 .. we r all stuck at 74.3%! besides u didnt even bother uploading the rest of the discs in that season! what good be a lone disc for the people who spent all their time downloading it in the hope of having the complete set??!! Please atleast come back and finish uploading that!
