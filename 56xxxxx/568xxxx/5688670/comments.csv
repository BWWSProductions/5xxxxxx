,tuneli,2010-08-08T21:31Z,"Nvm just downloaded a version that worked from a different torrent. Otherwise, nice work!"
,Mookus,2011-02-11T05:36Z,"Any problems found with subtitles can be solved much more simply then trying to hunt for another elusive single episode, as I had to do.  This torrent has any of the episodes needed to fix that issue.

,Emmentaler,2011-05-09T16:58Z,"@tuneli, sinisterz
VLC has a problem with the subtitles, media player classic seems to work

@Uploader
would like to see subtitles on the special because the ones included are problematic."
,samonewbo,2011-07-28T13:57Z,can anyone explain what i do after downloading the torrent and codec please? I'm sorta new here.
,zingmars,2011-10-27T11:07Z,"The goultard special doesn't seem to be working for me - VLC doesn't show subs at all, while MPCHC seems to display these subs wrongly - http://i.imgur.com/EwuTk.jpg . It's the only episode that doesn't seem to be working properly though (and seems to be the only episode that uses different encoding settings that the others).
Still a good torrent though, would recommend it to others."
,95Luther,2012-01-06T19:17Z,"some of the files are in windows movie maker files and well i can't watch them 
i have no idea what to do"
,Logrin,2012-03-10T16:34Z,"Ditto on goultard having nonsensical subs. But again, other than that FANTASTIC upload. Shame about that one episode though."
,austin20111,2012-03-26T21:44Z,"Zingmars if you havent done this in Media Player Classic, right click the view screen, go to Subtitles, then hit ENG (or whatever language you have)"
