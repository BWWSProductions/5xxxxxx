STAGE PROFILE:

The longest stage of this yearΓÇÖs Tour will present the pack with another opportunity for a grouped finish. The route is not very hilly and the riders will be well sheltered since there is a lot of forest, in the foothills of the Morvan range. Even if it is not a totally flat terrain, we will not see a grand battle like those we are used to on the passes. A word of warning though: if the weather is hot, this could affect the outcome. It will all depend on the team which takes control of the race, because if Cavendish is riding well and is sure of winning the stage, then his team will give it their all. Otherwise, which sprinting team will be capable of closing the door on the others?
