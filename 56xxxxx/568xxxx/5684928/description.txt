Family gatherings in the South are a unique experience. Getting together with
relatives I managed to avoid the entire year. The guests of honor were typically
Jim Beam, Evan Williams, and of course, Jack Daniels. But that doesnÆt mean
Grandpa left his moonshine at home. Oh no, he brought it. You could be sure of
that the next morning. Maybe it was the moonshine that fueled the front yard
brawl between Uncle Earl and Bubba. On second thought, it could have been the
way he insulted Dale Jr. You know Uncle Earl just wonÆt stand for that. Nothing
some good ole ôFamily Traditionö from Hank Jr couldnÆt fix though. Not a moment
too soon, either. Someone just broke out the last case of PBR (or Pabst Blue
Ribbon, for those of you who donÆt know Southernese), and itÆs time for Walker,
Texas Ranger.

Okay, so portions of that description could be embellished, but I refuse to say
which ones. I prefer to hold on to some integrity. Can you blame me? And why am
I telling that story in an album review? Because HellyeahÆs new album, Stampede,
is like a Southern family gathering. Beer drinking, trash talking, laughing,
fighting û just an all out good time. But when your friends ask what you did
over the weekend, you might just opt to keep it to yourself.

For those unfamiliar with Hellyeah, hereÆs some background. Two dudes from
Mudvayne (vocalist Chad Gray and guitarist Greg Tribbett), a dude from
Nothingface (guitarist Tom Maxwell), and two dudes from Damageplan (bassist Bob
Zilla and drummer Vinnie Paul). You might also recognize Vinnie Paul from a
little band named Pantera. But, while youÆll get some Pantera influence in
Hellyeah, donÆt expect too much. This band is a Southern swagger infused
variation of Mudvayne, or as I like to call it, Mudvayne for rednecks.
(Remember: no harm meant. I have rednecks in my family, too.) You can take Chad
Gray out of Mudvayne, but you canÆt take Mudvayne out of Chad Gray (meaning you
get no variation in his vocals û at all).

The first four tracks, ôCowboy Wayö, ôDebt That All Men Payö, ôHell Of A Timeö
and ôStampedeö, are all pretty good songs with killer hooks. I can absolutely
envision a club full of people singing along with the band on these songs. If I
drank a couple of beers, I might even sing along, too.

ôBetter Manö has an intro so similar to MetallicaÆs ôUnforgivenö that James
Hetfield might come looking for Chad Gray. Well, if he wasnÆt so busy feuding
with Dave Mustaine, Tom Araya, and that other guy from Anthrax. Lars might be
free to pick a fight though. After the vocals start, I swear I hear two coconuts
being smacked together (a la Monty Python and the Holy Grail) to simulate the
sound of a horse trotting. Once I heard it, it was tough to drown out. The song
itself is a slow ballad thatàtrot trot, trot trot. Dear Lord. Can someone please
get that horse out of here?

ôPole Riderö gets thrown in to fill the ôobligatory song about a trashy
stripperö quota. ItÆs been done before û over and over again. Hell, even
NicklebackÆs done it a few times. And if theyÆve done it, itÆs safe to say we
can move on already.

Stampede is sure to be the summer soundtrack for good ole boys at bonfires, at
pool halls, and mud bogginÆ in 4 wheel drive trucks everywhere. ItÆs a bit
gimmicky, but definitely a fun listen. So go ahead and give the album a few
spins. We wonÆt judge you, and weÆll be sure not to tell anyone. Your secret is
safe with us. Maybe itÆs not a great album, but is it worth a few listens?
Hellyeah, man.
