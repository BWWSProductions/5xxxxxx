William Dorn decides to get back at all the people he blames for the overdose 
death of his daughter and the break up of his marriage, so he decides to go on a 
bombing spree. His first target is his daughter's old high school, which he all 
but destroys. His next target is the mental hospital where his daughter was when 
she died and his final target is the feminist organization his ex-wife was a 
member of. However, during his attack on the hospital there are two people who 
witness this action, a creepy rapist named George Fromley and his victim, a 
young mute girl. When police detective Geronimo Minelli is assigned to the case 
he must find Fromley to keep him from striking again, but to keep him alive 
before the Dorn makes him his next victim.
