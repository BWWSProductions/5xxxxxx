,boomshockalocka,2010-07-13T02:28Z,"Looks like WDM is out of the game. I liked there releases, I always got the 128Kbps and it was nicely edited. The rest of these releasers make sloppy stuff then flame WDM cause they do better."
,nukethem,2010-07-13T03:15Z,"Even if it\'s not edited as well as WDM, i appreciate anyone who uploads the show for us.  thanks."
,boomshockalocka,2010-07-13T03:27Z,"@nukethem: Yeah I ended up getting this one too, cause it\'d be tomorrow EST before WDM put theirs up, even though it\'s already on 4share."
