,ajkid93,2010-07-26T16:39Z,Seed please? Been dling this for about 2 weeks and only on 5%
,ODBC,2010-10-26T00:05Z,Thank you for sharing.
,honuuu,2010-12-02T21:42Z,perfect sharing but seed please :(
,Davemmanc,2010-12-20T22:12Z,S01E21 is actually S02E11. Season 1 only had 20 episodes.. 
,Prodigy720,2011-02-04T11:14Z,S01E21 was an un-aired episode that was shown in the middle of season 2. If you watch it as if it was episode 11 of season 2 you will be surprised to see an agent who died in season 1 magically resurrected from the dead with no explanation like i did! 
,randumbuser420,2011-02-07T16:07Z,What is the source of these rips? TV? Blu-ray? 
,severed1314,2011-02-19T14:00Z,@Ace  Its called good quality. Go DL your shit quality and fuck off.
,azidtrip,2011-03-01T03:00Z,"Please seed everyone. This torrent deserve to grow. Everything needed included. Subs, 720 HD, what more can you ask?. Seed please. Its lousy 6 k here, esitmated 10 WEEKS. Cmon, dont be greedy. SEED, SEED."
,azidtrip,2011-03-01T03:05Z,"Ace1982

YOU are a ungreatful leeching lamer. This torrent is not a wast if you want quality. Yes its slow now. But if people get off their ass and start seeeding more it speed up. Instead of complaining you can rather STFU and GTFO over to eztv website and leech 720 linked from there. My 2 cents..."
,nittany,2011-03-19T11:54Z,"Ridiculous size for only 2 seasons, unfortunately this is the only good quality Fringe torrent on piratebay right now....argh

Wish somebody would take this as a source and make it around 20GB or so using h.264 codec or something."
,anpe91,2011-03-24T17:48Z,"@Ace

I think it's you who's smoking crack in your moms basement while downloading dvd quality episodes with half a megabyte internet connection to your 30gig hdd.

Otherwise 50gig for two seasons in HD is nothing to bitch about."
,Tiny Turtle ,2011-04-04T19:38Z,"43 episodes in 720p (and the 21 of season 1 clocking in at ~49-51 minutes instead of the typical 43 minutes) and the total file size is 48.44 GB. That means an average size of 1.12GB per episode which is about what a 720p episode usually weighs in at, so what in the world are you tossers bitching about? 

What would be an acceptable size according to you then?"
,dead_rekon11,2011-04-11T01:20Z,please seed!!!!!!
,fillinthisspace,2011-05-14T05:13Z,"@Ace1982,

,rogersmith,2011-07-19T10:17Z,"@nittany Goodfilms has season one  bluray since back in janurary.  I appreciate the upload but i was not impressed with the video quality. although the bluray episodes are about 2.2 gigs per, they are totally worth it in my opinion."
,tru_envy,2011-07-23T05:56Z,"@ace  
We definitely could be smoking some crack but you don't like to share. 
@konashine
It's fine, not everyone is happy with their lives, some have to be trolls."

I See on the episode guide it says that season 2 has 23 episodes; there are only 22 here, and episode 22-23 is a 2 parter, but the duration for ep.22 is only 40something mins.

,asdasdsdfefdgh,2012-05-17T00:26Z,S02E11 is missing and all episodes after that are misnumbered (i.e. E12.mkv is actually E13).
,kevduch,2012-05-17T11:03Z,"Pay attention... From the description: 

""Fringe.S02E11(an Ep. of Season 1, ""Unearthed"") is renamed Fringe S01E21.


So

Fringe.S02E12(aired January 14, 2010, ""Johari Window"") is renamed Fringe.S02E11

Fringe.S02E13(aired January 21, 2010, ""What Lies Below"") is renamed Fringe.S02E12

Fringe.S02E22(aired May 13, 2010, ""Over There: Part 1"") is renamed Fringe.S02E21

Fringe.S02E23(aired May 20, 2010, ""Over There: Part 2"") is renamed Fringe.S02E22""

On another note, 27 days later and I am finally done downloading. Will seed for a while."
