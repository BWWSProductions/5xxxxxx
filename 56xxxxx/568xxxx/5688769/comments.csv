,UnderGroundAudioEngineer,2010-09-15T05:41Z,"Tired of MP3's? Want Better Quality?
Download this Soundtrack in FLAC!
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5689674/Inception_OST_-_Hans_Zimmer_-_FLAC#filelistContainer

FLAC stands for Free Loss-less Audio Codec and is one of the most efficient Loss-less Codec's out there.
A FLAC encode can reduce file size by over 40% and maintain ALL THE QUALITY of the original CD's WAVE :)
A program like Toast can burn these files to a disc giving you a perfect CD QUALITY BURN.
A program like Audacity can quickly convert these files to .wav for playing on a PC or .aif for playing on a MAC!
You deserve better audio quality! Once you go FLAC you never go back!"
,UnderGroundAudioEngineer,2010-09-15T05:43Z,"Oh, and a program like VLC Media Player can playback FLAC files directly!"
,Harutik_11,2010-09-24T02:51Z,"The track ""Time"" just blows me away.
Hans Zimmer is the present and future!!"

,Wolfareon,2011-03-28T22:18Z,"This is one of the best made soundtracks ever !
Hans Zimmer is valuable. "
,apeyboy,2011-05-07T05:07Z,Amazing score. On par with kick-ass and the dark knight.
,harkolo,2011-05-27T14:22Z,"Track Mombasa is impossible to play correct either with 320kbps or lossless FLAC without very high end audio equipment.

The bass track is very complicated and multi-layered so it will sound hollow or simply distort a typical headset or stereo system."
,KeizerHalil,2011-06-17T21:59Z,This is what god has on his Ipod :)
,FreeHugz,2011-06-23T20:33Z,"Thank You so much!
I love Inception OST So much. Hans Zimmer has aways been my favourite Composer. "
,ScoreGods,2011-07-17T18:17Z,"POOR in quality !!! Not worth downloading !

@ Uploader

Uploading albums of master composers like Hans Zimmer  only makes sense if UNTOUCHED

Uploads are welcome in full albums

1. Wave
2. Flac

If anyone needs to encode into MP3 learn the way how it is done just right. Follow the instructions while encoding, make sure you do NOT run other applications while encoding (like working in Photoshop or another audio application while its running) Doing so ends in bad quality- like so many uploads here.

MASTER COMPOSER = Top notch quality in composing, recording and ""mastering"" 
The chance you make mistakes with YOUR audio file is rather high unless you are an audio engineer or other pro with a lot of sound studio experience.  

Do NOT touch the audio files else the upload gets a negative quality rating. 


Enough said"
,Johngoundry86,2011-07-30T08:13Z,Flac would be perfect for this quality of music! :D
,pkisme,2011-09-29T03:34Z,"@harkolo and ScoreGods - 

1) well, for starters MOST of us can't tell the diff anyway.
2) Most of us don have the attention span to figure out which audio hardware to buy to get accurate representation of various lossless formats.
3) if most ppl here really want quality they wld have move their ass out to the stores (or online stores) n get the real thing... they wldn't be here."
,wtflol19,2011-10-22T02:11Z,"@ScoreGods
wth dude, it says MP3 320 in the torrent title.

why even bother if you don't think its acceptable?  Its 320 cbr @ 44.1 kHz, good enough for me.  Go get the flac torrent and chill out.

Torrent is good quality."
,bladegery,2011-11-01T09:58Z,"Thanx, man!"
,Aim_To_Maim,2012-03-16T11:50Z,"@ScoreGods = self proclaimed elitist format police fuckwit, why download anything then dick, go buy a fucking $50.000 CD player! Get a life jerk off the quality of the upload is absolutely fine for us mere mortals."
[V],rndmfrd222,2012-03-26T17:12Z,Cheers :)
