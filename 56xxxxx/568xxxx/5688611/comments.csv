[T],RedHatcc,2010-07-15T00:20Z,"It doesn\'t do much as far as visual themes but it does increase the stability, speed, and security. nnPlus 7/13/10 Microsoft quit supporting SP2 so its time for everyone to upgrade :P. I think SP3 has a support life until 2014+ ?"

[T],RedHatcc,2010-07-18T07:25Z,"You can find some theme software on TPB that will allow you to customize windows to look pretty cool. Although I must warn you before you download it, read the comments because alot of people like to infect them and install trojans/keyloogers to them. Idk why lol but you can test those files at virustotal.com before you install them to ensure they are clean. "
