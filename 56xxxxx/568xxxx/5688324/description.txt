Rex Harrison astonished his fans by donning a Nazi uniform in the British suspenser Night Train (originally titled 

Night Train to Munich). Actually he's a British agent, working undercover to rescue a Czech inventor from the 

Gestapo. The inventor's daughter (Margaret Lockwood) becomes the unwitting pawn of a genuine Nazi (Paul von 

Hernreid, just before he became Paul Henreid) during a long train ride from Germany to France and back again. 

Director Carol Reed never denied that his inspiration for Night Train was Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (both films 

were written by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat). The homage was solidified by the presence in Night Train of two 

carryovers from the Hitchcock  film: those ardent British cricket fans Charters and Caldicott (Basil Radford and 

Naunton Wayne). Night Train was liberally adapted from the Gordon Wellesley novel Report on a Fugitive.
