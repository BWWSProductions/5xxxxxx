Jake Humphrey presents coverage of how Fetal19 is notihng but a leech whore.  He goes into detail about how Fetal19 does nothing but complain about the hard work others do to try and bring you all coverage of the 2010 F1 season.  Every F1 torrent you will see Fetal19 whine and cry about how there isn't enough information given about the torrents he is about to leech and not share back after he is done leeching.  Eddie and David also bring up the fact that Fetal19 is only seen on thepiratebay.org because it is the only torrent site that allows you to leech and leech and leech but you do not need to contribute back to the scene.  Will Fetal19 survive in this crazy torrent scene?  Only the rest of the F1 season will tell us.

**On a more serious note.  Here is the British Grand Prix ripped by none other than TDMK1.  You can expect great quality in audio and video (as you do with all TDMK1's rips).  Enjoy and help seed to take some load off of TDMK1's bandwidth.
