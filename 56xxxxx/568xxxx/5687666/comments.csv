,twatsnapper,2010-07-13T07:26Z,Any chance of uploading the European F1 GP race?
,YiNG_YaNG_6o4,2010-07-13T07:46Z,European GP has been here the whole time.  You probably got a little confused cuz they call it Spain GP.nnhttp://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5653427/2010.06.27-F1.09.Spain.Race.BBC2_UK_[TDMK1]
,Cornflower,2010-07-13T20:53Z,"So, does anyone know where I can get my hands on the race, but in better resolution?"
,Cornflower,2010-07-13T21:08Z,?n
,YiNG_YaNG_6o4,2010-07-14T02:21Z,this is already in good resolution.  nobody is gonna rip it any better than tdmk1.  if you want better resolution .... pay for hd channels.  but then again ... i don\'t think BBC broadcasts F1 in HD.
,twatsnapper,2010-07-14T07:15Z,"Thanks for pointing that out to me YiNG_YaNG_6o4, yes very confusing title name"
,Cornflower,2010-07-14T11:04Z,"Dear YiNG_YaNG_604:nnOf course there are better resolutions. All the races this season so far have been ripped by several persons in better resolution.nAccording to the information available on this rip, it\'s only 320 (or similar), which is not a good resolution. 576 or higher would be preferrable.nAlso, with risk of being flamed, let me point out that several tests on the TYT forums have shown that it\'s better to increase resolution and decrease bandwidth if you are concerned about space. The reason being that there\'s not a linear progression of size to resolution with the proper algorithm (i.e. X264).nRegardless, I\'m very grateful that you have provided this rip."
,tdmk1,2010-07-16T23:32Z,"Dude, thanks for uploading this - I have had all sorts of torrent session issues trying to upload this... Was a bit confused when it finally worked this evening and was told by the system that it already existed! ;)"
