Grotesque   Tactics:   Evil   Heroes   is   an   ironical,
story-intensive fantasy RPG with  tactical  elements.  The
game follows young recruit Drake, who has  failed  at  the
military academy exam. Humiliated and frustrated he  wants
to end his life by  jumping  into  the  throat  of  brutal
mushrooms. But then he learns that hes not the  only  one
disappointed and that there are others  who  cant  go  on
with their lives.  He  comes  across  the  last  depressed
remains of the kingdoms army which return  badly  injured
from an all or nothing battle. One of the survivors is the
most  popular  hero  of  all  mankind:  Holy  Avatar.  The
arrogant knight in shiny armor tells you  how  a  suddenly
appearing sect crushed the whole kingdoms army. The  land
Glory is overrun by  creatures  of  the  Dark  Church  and
whats even worse, HE, the mighty Holy Avatar, was  beaten
the first time in his life.

Now it is on YOU, Drake, to recruit a force and fight  off
the Dark Church before the  population  learns  about  the
defeat and runs scared. However, all the lands heroic men
are deadly injured or already dead. Only the most  dubious
and criminal creatures are left, deeply hidden in the high
security dungeons. Well... and there still  are  the  most
evil creatures of all: WOMEN! Yet they have no  choice  if
they want to  rescue  the  land  from  the  Dark  Churchs
fanatic claws. Established are the Evil Heroes!
