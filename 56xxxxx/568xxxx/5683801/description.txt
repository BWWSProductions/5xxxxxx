Cool Animated Movie with Spanish Dolby digital surround audio.

Plot: Astranought lands on an alien planet where live is pretty much the same on earth only with little green men.


I accidently uploaded the wrong audio as I'm new at this stuff, but if you're spanish and have kids(or even grown-ups, this is a real fun movie!


Enjoy!  If you like it, Buy it.  I'll try to get the English one up soon.

So far, I'm ripping to TS VIDEO.  I think I figured out how to make it mp4 and x264, but I haven't figured out how to turn it into .avi yet. any help would be much appreciated!

gracias! :P
