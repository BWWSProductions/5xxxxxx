This is the entire Cache of AlterIWNet's updater. 
To use it properly, you must put it in your root Modern Warfare 2 directory.

1. Download the updater linked on our website and extract it to your Modern Warfare 2 directory.
2. Extract cache.7z to your Modern Warfare 2 directory. 
3. Start iw4mp.exe, it will update you with the latest steam_api.dll and small client files.
4. Game will start.

Using the OTHER manual-update method will cause you to NOT be a part of our P2P update system.
That means you may not be able to receive future updates.
