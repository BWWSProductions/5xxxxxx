,harkolo,2011-05-27T14:32Z,"Great soundtrack. My only gripe is that the song ""Mombasa"" is impossible to play correctly on my normal headphones or stereos.

I analyzed the audio with software, and it probably has the most complicated, multi-layered bass track I have encountered in any audio file.

It sure can play normally but it sounds hollow on my meagre audio setup. It muddles in some sections, this is not the fault of the file but the fact that very few headphones in the world can reproduce this massive soundstage and bass at the same time."
