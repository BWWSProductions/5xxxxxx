     Stoned Ripping Project was founded in 2003 with the sole aim      
     of providing the scene with the  best Rock & Metal vids from      
     all around the world.  We do this for the love of the music,      
     and of course,  for fun. Despite the ease with which you can      
     find  streaming videos online today,  we feel that releasing      
     high quality rips, free of restrictions, is as important now      
     as it has ever been.
