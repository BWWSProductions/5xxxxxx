,hole1,2010-07-16T12:20Z,"For those who are having some issues with the DTS track, just download and install MKV Toolnix 4.1.1 (released on July 3rd) and remux it, you must selectn\""No Compression\"" for the DTS stream under the \""Extra Options\"" tab."
,custard123,2010-07-17T09:01Z,not all movies are 16:9 as it seems is the case with this one. its quite normal to see this resolution - 2.35 : 1nnit easier to upload the file without the resulting black borders that would be present on a hdtv to keep file size as small as possible.nn
