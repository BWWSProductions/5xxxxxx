This is legitamite, not a scam, not a fraud or anything shady. Just a plea for help for the BEST encoder/upper that exists today!

Please help us to buy 20-40 a new PC.

So far 4 people (REAL fans) have donated cash to the cause. ALL of us are on minimum income (pensions etc.) and we could find the extra cash. 

Be one of the Few that will make the difference. Do NOT be one of the many,so far, that say 'someone else will donate'. PLEASE!

Thanks 

@All New Guys
Please keep the torrents on, do not remove them after you are finished with download. Keep Ratio above 1:1. And dont worry your ISP donot charge you for the uploads. So help Others. sharing is Caring. God Bless "
,linkass,2011-01-11T12:30Z,"I always seed torrents, but I noticed a prob with the torrents I downloaded from twenty-forty (also a few others). Even after I finish downloading, the torrents won't seed. Uploading speed is always 0.01kb/s. It does not always happen, but with unfortunately, all the TV show torrents I download have this glitch. Anyone know what this is?"
