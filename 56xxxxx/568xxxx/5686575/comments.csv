This Screener of Grown ups is at best OK, now don't get me wrong its great to see this so early and the quality is fine and the audio is in sync, But there is a saturation issue i think witch makes it more orange witch is a little weird and the picture its self is pix elated but the size of the file u can't go wrong with so i say get it but dont expect too much...

P.s Yes the water mark has been smudged out for convenience Thank u!     "
