This is to complete my previous post  to compile all the studio albums released by Embrace from 1998 to 2006. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5365949/Embrace_-_4_Studio_Albums_[2000-2006]


The Good Will Out is the debut album by English rock band Embrace, first released in 1998.

The album achieved critical acclaim as well as success in terms of sales, going gold on its first day of release, becoming one of the fastest-ever-selling debut albums by a British artist, and going on to sell over 500,000 copies domestically.

On an interesting note, songs from the "The Good Will Out" have been used in many football montages. The song "My Weakness Is None of Your Business" was used as theme to the Republic of Ireland's 2002 football World Cup exit to Spain. The song "Now You're Nobody" was also featured on a Nike commercial at the end of the France 1998 World Cup.
