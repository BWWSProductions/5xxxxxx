Plot:  A retired MMA fighter is lured back into the ring by a shady promoter seeking a big ticket brawl.  A TapouT production starring many UFC stars.

Just when you thought "Undisputed 3: Electric Boogie-woogie" set an impassable bar as this year's worst MMA/fight film, along comes the magnanimous "Circle of Pain".

On Deck: Weekend at Bernie's, the acting was better from Bernie.
