I fixed the song "The Enemy Within" problem so now it works, and i added in Disc 3 of "Rush In Rio" since it was missing that.... also, i added the album "Chronicles"  to the discography so now it is complete, it has every one of their albums and everything is MP3@320kb\s quality so you can enjoy it on your IPods and MP3 players... this is the Complete Discography of Rush, the album listings are below. there is 31 albums and each has its album artwork.... I Hope You Enjoy! =)


P.S. I'll be seeding this for a week or three but please people, if you can seed this torrent without it being too much of a problem, do me a favor and seed it please... Remember, Sharing is Caring! =)
