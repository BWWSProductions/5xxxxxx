The Best Of Johnny Winter (2002)

Johnny Winter is an American music legend. Since his first appearance on 
the pages of Rolling Stone in 1968, Johnny has epitomized the fiery and 
flamboyant rock and roll guitar hero. Yet Johnny has continually returned 
to the blues roots from which his music sprang. If American electric blues 
is your gospel, this album should be one of its cornerstones of faith.
