         Convinced that some view food from America's heartland        
         as inferior to what can be found in Manhattan or San          
         Francisco, host Anthony Bourdain travels to Denver,           
         Columbus and Austin, among other cities, to prove that        
          great food can be found anywhere.

         We're sick of following whatever drunk moron in OMiCRON       
         screwed up the numbering on this show a couple seasons ago,   
         so we're going to use the correct numbering from here on,     
          and encourage others who do this show to do the same.
