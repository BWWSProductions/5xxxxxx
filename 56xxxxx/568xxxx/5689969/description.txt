             ABOUT THE SHOW           
                                                                    
                                                                              
  The shock ending to OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE series five left fans uttering       
  expletives as Cheryl stabbed Gerard in the neck with a broken bottle and    
  he, in turn, fired three point blank bullets in the direction of both       
  Cheryl and Pascalle.                                                        
                                                                              
  The New Zealand response to the season finale was phenomenal and it         
  quickly drew international attention to the show: half an hour after        
  the episode aired, OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE climbed Twitters trending list       
  to the coveted #1 global position, making it the most tweeted subject     
  in the world at the time and driving a hoard of curious international       
  twitterers to find out more about this outrageous show.                   
                                                                              
  So its fair to say that the premiere of OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNEs sixth season  
  is the most anticipated series return in New Zealand television history.
