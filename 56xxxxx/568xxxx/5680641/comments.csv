,jarrks,2010-07-18T22:21Z,"Thanks. But I got problems with the audio. In stereo headphones I can hear a speech from right channel only. I assume it's something with that 5.1 sound, but I can't figure out how to set mplayer options. In VLC it's the same."
,allrockedout,2010-07-21T05:33Z,"half of the movies audio is only coming out of the left speaker, weird never came across something like this before. like the spoken parts come out on the right only and the movies music on the left"
,xenl,2010-07-25T07:55Z,thank you.
,yowhatttup,2010-07-26T12:21Z,"Audio 10, Video 10. Great quality. Decent movie. The concept was good, but the execution was weak. A little too long as well at 2 hours."
