GSA Radio Stream Recorder description
Software to record internet radio station streams to MP3 , ACC or OGG format.

Using the GSA Radio Stream Recorder application you can record almost any music freely from the internet.

More than 8000 Radio Stations and over 100 genres to choose from
There are many so called internet radios who stream music. With our product you can now record that music directly to harddisk without any technical knowledge.

You don't even need to know the name or URL of such an internet radio to record. Simply search within the program for your favourite genre or artist and the program will try to deliver a matching radio station that you can chose to record.

There are a lot stations who play 24 hours all kind of music from a specific genre. So if you plan to record e.g. only Classic Rock, feel free to pick such a station and see what it gets you.

You can record not only one station but as many as you want (or your internet connection lets you).

Additional artist information (band history, images)
Unlike any other program, we offer you not only this, but the ability to see details about the playing artist. See a band history and pictures. See on what album this song was first published. Go directly to the artist's website, buy the whole album or simply visit lastfm or myspace.

Listen while you record
While recording songs, you can also listen to each radio stream and see if you like it or not. If you don't want a song or artist, simply put it to the filter so you never wast time again with something you don't like.
