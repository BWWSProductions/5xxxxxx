Storyline:
A retired MMA fighter is lured back into the ring by a shady promoter
seeking a big ticket brawl. Dalton Hunt (Tony Schiena) was the greatest
fighter in the world when his career came to a sudden and tragic end. 
Subsequently abandoned by his family, Dalton retreats from the spotlight 
until a sleazy promoter presents him with an offer he can't refuse. 
The reigning champion has yet to encounter an opponent he can't pummel 
into submission, and Dalton may be just the man to teach him a little 
humility. But in order to get back into fighting shape, Dalton will 
endure a grueling training regimen under a mysterious coach who won't 
accept anything less than 100% dedication.
