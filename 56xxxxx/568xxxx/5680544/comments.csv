[T],on.off.on,2010-07-10T20:49Z,htctouch im happy theres people like u.. u make it worth my while to make these rips... I watched some of my own stuff on my tv and i have to say that they look very good. Megui is a good program but even the most simple program can be better.. Its all about settings and tweaking. But alot of people dont understand how crazy good the H264 codec is... even without any settings done to it.. my release are downgraded in settings so most of the handheld devices can play them.. but i could make them look alot better in same size if they were just for tv\'s and pc\'s =) But i want to thank all the people whom seed my torrents it an honor to make these movies for you all! =)
,htctouch,2010-07-10T21:02Z,"always wid u buddy keep rokin \\m/nn yeh i agree h264 is way betr thn .avi if ripd properly.nm realy loving this .mkv containers these days.they r of small size even wid high resolution.n its quality isnt bothered mch whn ripd in 400-500 kbps.[acc to my observation]nonly drawback is its not playble in players,ipod n stuff i bliv.othr wise it total rox."
