I finally got around to finishing the subtitles for the only two episodes of 

Upstairs, Downstairs I have attempted. It is a more difficult job than for normal 

movies.The dialects and accents mixed in with occasional faulty audio recording 

made it impossible even to make a guess as to what is said in several places of 

"I Dies From Love". These places (phrases) are put in parentheses, rather than 

replaced by a series of dashes or periods, so you can see my best guess. I am 

gaining skill in recognizing mistakes in subtitles during subsequent viewing. So 

perhaps later I will come back and correct the mistakes in this upload. 


Remember, these are your subtitles. Do with them what you will.  If you don't like 

what I've done, get yourself a copy of Subtitle Workshop and teach yourself how 

to edit my words. As time goes by perhaps some of you in a younger generation will 

pick up my work and improve it and extend it.


Many old people here in my retirement home say they would have enjoyed 

watching the movie better if it weren't for the "silly" letters at the bottom of 

the picture. After watching movies with subtitles displayed (for my wife's 

benefit) I have developed a desire to have subtitles displayed on all videos, 

regular television shows or not. It seems to me now that experiencing the spoken 

word with two senses (sight and hearing) gives me a better comprehension of the 

story.
