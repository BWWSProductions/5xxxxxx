Breaking The magician's Code - Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed 1998-2008


Breaking the Magicians' Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed is a series of television shows in which the methods behind magic tricks and illusions are explained.
The series is made by production company Nash Entertainment. The first four specials featured incognito magician Val Valentino as the Masked Magician, who performed large-scale illusions and a few smaller-scale close up magic tricks before revealing the secrets of the tricks. The Masked Magician was promoted as a well-known magician who wore a mask to avoid recrimination from fellow magicians. Criss Angel thinks that the "revealing" is false and they are not talented or creative enough, which he said during an interview with The Straits Times over telephone from Las Vegas to Singapore. Indirectly, he said that those are not how magicians did those tricks.
The title alluded to the magician's code: the promise by working magicians not to reveal the basis of their tricks, or else risk getting blackballed by fellow magicians.
