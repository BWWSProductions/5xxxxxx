Fallen Decade is a Canadian thrash metal band formed by the former Cradle to Grave singer Greg Cavanagh and a bunch of hardcore dudes from Newfoundland and this is their debut album Under No God. I had no idea how they would sound so I was expecting metalcore or some other shit like that. Instead what I got was a high-energy thrash release. Short, fast and aggressive is the best way to describe this record, but that high energy is not the only thing to like about this album.

There is a ton of riffs to dissect on this record; they're just not that easy to follow along. The musicianship level is what you expect from a band that plays this type of music, there are blazing guitar leads found here, you can hear the bass perfectly, the drumming does not get too out of control and for a small band they have solid production values. Songwriting-wise, there is enough variety that I don't feel that I'm listening to the same song ten different times.
