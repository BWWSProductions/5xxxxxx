Phish 5-20-87 at the Ranch in Burlington, VT.

Awesome set from a very early Phish.  Trey's hair in this one is crazy long, its quite amusing.  Video quality and camera work are subpar, but any Phan of old Phish should be adjusted to that kind of trouble.  Besides, its worth it for the audio, the quality of which is good, and the set is AWESOME!
