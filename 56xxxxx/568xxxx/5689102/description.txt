Power 90 is not P90x

Power 90 is the prequel to P90x and is designed as the first installment. Once you complete Power 90, then you can graduate to P90x (Power 90 Extreme). I suggest you read the program guide front to back and the calenders to choose the program that works for you. This comes with ALL of the videos and documents you would get if you were to order it yourself. I suggest using VLC media player.
