,UnknownAlly,2011-04-10T11:44Z,"I did P90X for 1 month and lost 10 lbs without following the nutrition guide. I did eat healthier, though.

The workouts maxing at 1 hour, 30 minutes was too long for me. So I ended up never finishing. I'm going to buy P90 in a couple days. I'd like to have the official thing."
