The ISO name is very long so rename it to something shorter before you try and extract/mount the file. rnrnHelp seed and enjoy the latest update to windows7 in one piece.rnrn"

,supanut2000,2010-07-26T14:58Z,"Guys do not download this shit!
I tried it and it gives me expiry date of like June 2011!
And I believe if you remove it, it will fuck up your comp and you'll have to reinstall Windows 7!
Use this at your own risk! No support from MS, and neither will MS provide support for betas."
