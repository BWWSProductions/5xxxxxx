,stevejobs42,2010-07-12T05:57Z,no previous torrents and it hasn\'t even aired yet
,PhilLesh12,2010-07-12T05:58Z,FAKErnrnThis is the only torrent this user has ever uploaded.
,PhilLesh12,2010-07-12T05:59Z,"@stevejobs42,rnrnit has aired already, but tvteam and eztv haven\'t uploaded it yet, so this guy is obviously a fake."
,bdawg04,2010-07-12T06:01Z,"we\'re all slowly moving around 72%, but yeah, it has aired on the eastcoast. i\'m assuming it\'s a fake cuz like the guy above said, tvteam hasn\'t released yet"
,ichthyostega,2010-07-12T06:03Z,.WMV file on a TV show or a movie it\'s always a fake!!!
,PhilLesh12,2010-07-12T06:13Z,"it doesn\'t just air on the east coast.  It airs at the same time all over the country, so in eastern time, it airs at 10pm, but that means it airs at 9 pm in central time zone.  On the west coast, it airs at 7 pm.  All at the same time.rnrnOf course, HBO West will air it at 10pm pacific time, but that means it is playing at 1 am on the east coast."
,yadayadaya,2010-07-12T06:19Z,"Regardless of who or what, it would have aired across seas by now."
,stevejobs42,2010-07-12T06:21Z,1000 leechers and another fake torrent went up already? damn
