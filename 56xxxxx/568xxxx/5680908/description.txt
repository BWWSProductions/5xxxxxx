--------------------------------+ Notes +-------------------------------------

    Paper Tongues, of Charlotte, NC, plays for the people. Fusing  
    massive rock n' roll melodies with fiery hip hop beats, the    
    Charlotte band conjures an infectious, incendiary sound on     
    their A&M/Octone debut. Embracing elements of rock, funk, rap  
    and soul, seven individuals have created something you         
    haven't before. It's music for dancing, crying, loving and     
    living. Paper Tongues are a collective of artists, and this    
    record is their first masterpiece.                             
                                                                   
    The Paper Tongues self-titled debut album was produced by:     
    Brian West (Nelly Furtado, K'Naan, Bela Fleck), Mark Endert    
    (Maroon 5, Gavin DeGraw, Madonna), John Fields (Switchfoot,    
    Jimmy Eat World), and up-and-coming producer, Nicolas          
    Balachandran.
