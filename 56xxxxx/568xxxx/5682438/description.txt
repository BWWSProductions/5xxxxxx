GSA Autostart Cleaner description
Clean up all your autostart places and context menus and make your PC faster

GSA Autostart Cleaner will help you clean up all your autostart places and context menus for a faster PC.

Did you ever wonder why it takes so long until your computer starts up? Did you ever wonder why so many programs load when you turn your pc on? Did you ever wonder why everything is so slow or why you leak of available memory?

Get rid of these useless programs. With GSA Autostart Cleaner you can. It will search all places in your operation system where applications leave their autostart entries (registry, ini-files, bat-files, autostart-menus). Then you can choose if one is really needed or if it can be deleted.

This speeds up the whole boot process and finally resulting in a more stable system. Autostart Cleaner finally makes it easy for everyone to clean up his PC. In addition you can also clean the unwanted entries in the context menus from your explorer.
