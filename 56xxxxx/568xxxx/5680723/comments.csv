This is normal version of Total Commander with plugins there is no Virus or Infection!!

Universal Extractor donâ€™t give you a shit!!, why? because Total CMA Pack is packed in Unicode version of NSIS so this is why you get this shit from universal extractor, universal extractor donâ€™t know how to unpack this & handle with this file!!!
You write that this have no infection & have clean installation, but you use universal extractor & found some danger ""goodies"", hahaha lol you donâ€™t have any idea about software & computers......

If your computer starts behaving erratically after installation donâ€™t install it, or even donâ€™t use the computer â€˜case u r stupid! I use Total CMA Pack from a years & all work perfect & smooth.

I hate when somebody leave comments when he donâ€™t know what he talking about....!"
