In the 1980s, two members of New York's Lucchese crime family led a murderous campaign for power. Vittorio 'Little Vic' Amuso and Anthony 'Gaspipe' Casso - also known as Vic and Gas - broke the Mafia's code of honor with their brazen acts. They trafficked drugs, tried to 'whack' John Gotti and killed members of their own 'family.' Ultimately the entire Mafia turned against them. them. Manhattan Mob Rampage examines how Vic and Gus's killing spree changed the mob forever.
