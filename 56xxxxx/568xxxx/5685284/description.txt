Here are a few songs that we originally aired on the radio, but i downloaded the original audio file and separated into individual songs.  I put the apporopriate metadata in each track.  Only the songs Devastation Pill, Lincoln Ave., 15 Minutes, Welcome to the Real World, What's It Gonna Take are included because that's all there was! this band reminds me of Sevendust a little bit and have good vocals. These guys are from Spokane WA and here is their website: http://www.londongetdown.com/
