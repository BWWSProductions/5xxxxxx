[V],hiest,2010-07-12T19:11Z,"@Noir{1337}rnrnI dont believe this guy who claims to be Noir.He came in my section and wrote that i should not upload Noir\\\'s torrents, Well if you were real Noir then you would have never behaved so cheap, Noir never has time for all these complaints...., And He is not a cry baby......, If you are real noir then you should first warn the other guys who have uploaded 80% of Noir torrents here in TPB, I have uploaded only 1 torrent of noir.If you are real noir, Then write a comment in your section of 133x.org, That no one should upload your torrent in TPB.rnrnOnly then i and rest of TPB members will believe that you are real noir....According to my experience , Noir is a very prestigious and sincere unloader in 133x , he never behaves cheap , He never cries and complaints about others, He is a master peace, Moreover he is the senior most moderator of 133x.rnrnrnrn@JUICESIMrnrnThanks for your support mate...."
