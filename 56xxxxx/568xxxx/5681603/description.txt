    The radiation from a fallen satellite might have caused the recently     
    deceased to rise from the grave and seek the living to use as food.      
    This is the situation that a group of people penned up in an old         
    farmhouse must deal with.                                                
                                                                             
    ----                                                                     
                                                                             
    Imagine being holed up in a filthy dilapidated building, surrounded      
    by pale-faced hollow-eyed creatures, unable to call for help, while      
    before your eyes zombie-like beings commit the most unspeakable acts.    
    Yes, a night of performance art at your local coffee house is            
    something to be endured. But then so is a Night of the Living Dead!      
    Shocking at the time for its graphic portrayal of the titular living     
    dead feasting on pieces of the dead dead without even a hint of table    
    manners or personal hygiene, what is most startling to modern            
    sensibilities is the performance of the guy in the white pants who       
    looks like Joaquin Phoenix. He manages to actually be worse than         
    Joaquin Phoenix! And if you're a fan of inexplicably hostile,            
    growling men then you have hit the jackpot (you may even throw away      
    your laserdisc collection of the films of Robert Loggia!).               
                                                                             
    Mike, Kevin and Bill spend the better of a night with the Night of       
    the Living Dead.
