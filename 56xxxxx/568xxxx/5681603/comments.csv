,azmoth2,2010-07-14T12:34Z,Quality: video/audio? Is it as good as the definitive Millenium Edition? I hope it is not that diabolical 30th Anniversary edition? Thanks.
[T],Skymocker,2010-07-15T09:19Z,why did you upload this twice?
,azmoth2,2010-07-16T14:41Z,"Avoid this at all costs. The cocksucker who uploaded it has introduced some stupid/wacky commentary into the audio and it goes on and on and is so shite/lame. Whether it was part of the original dvd who knows or cares? Die motherfucker for not putting it in your torrent description. Video is very, very good however. ? demuxed from stealthmaster\'s grainy video his audio and muxed this correct audio in to this one after getting rid of its crappy audio track. Fuck U jerk off I beat you!"
[T],Skymocker,2010-07-17T08:26Z,"@azmoth2 thou art ignorant.  The first word in the name of the torrent is \""Rifftrax\""."
,azmoth2,2010-07-17T12:55Z,I\'m joking man. I know what it is. My feeble attempt at being humorous like the awful audio commentary. Thanks.

Cool upload though. If its a good copy I will definately seed. Thanks..."
,DrNorton,2010-07-22T08:17Z,"The quality is perfect. This was a great Rifftrax movie. When the redneck guy talks about beating off the zombies... PRICELESS!

Thanks a lot and will seed..."
