,jamesk5,2010-07-12T09:09Z,how does this work? do i just install it into the fsx folder if so that didnt work plus i tried to install it into the pss folder didnt work
,realfsx,2010-07-12T17:43Z,"Just run the installer if u have ur fsx folder set to the default. The font file will install to ur C:/Windows/fonts folder, if this is not ur default windows drive u need to find the font file, baloo.ttf file and place it in ur Windows/fonts folder"
,jamesk5,2010-07-13T19:26Z,thx it works - but another problem lol whenever i turn on the ap the plane pitches up then pitches down. up down up down. any ideas???
,realfsx,2010-07-14T15:58Z,"yh i realize that the auto pilot does that, im going to be working on that and i will upload another fix for that. However u can fly the plane manually and practice base turns and so on until the fix is available."
,jamesk5,2010-07-14T17:22Z,ok cool - thanks for plane its awesome!
