,Uncle_Fuzzy,2010-07-21T18:32Z,"Thanks for the post, ab2539.  Unfortunately, this book fails to satisfy at the end.  Well and knowledgeably-written, though predictably plotted, the author falls flat at the ending because of total improbability. The first three fourths of it will have you on the edge of your seat but after that, Winnie the Pooh offers more intellectual stimulus."
