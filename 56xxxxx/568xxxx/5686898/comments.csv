,hiadoken,2010-07-12T18:02Z,I\'ve bookmarked your tracker so I can get new eps as soon as they come out. Remember though that most people are only willing/able to use the pirate bay -that\'s why it\'s so popular. Isn\'t it better to store all the torrents in one place where everyone can find them?
,RThsA,2010-07-13T08:34Z,"\""Isn\'t it better to store all the torrents in one place where everyone can find them?\""nnHence them being on our tracker? There are more people than me doing series for Cartoon-World after all.nnMy point is that TPB itself doesn\'t generally increase much torrent traffic or anything because of other groups out there that release first with crappier quality like Cartoon_Palace. Those guys have the status on here where people bother looking at their encodes. I don\'t have VIP status or anything like that so it looks like a random upload of questionable quality."
