        Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz look for hidden memorabilia by digging
		through junk piles, abandoned barns and neglected garages. This
		series follows Mike and Frank through small towns and back roads
		for a glimpse at this little-known side of the antiques business.
		Whether tracking down a one-of-a-kind Ferris wheel or sizing up a
		vintage Harley-Davidson, they must be prepared to verify an
		object's history and judge its value. The pressure mounts as they
		strike the ultimate deal, find just the right buyer and turn
		around the item fast. Sometimes they make a buck; and sometimes
		they walk away with little more than the history of an item.
