,oddmanoutgt,2010-07-16T21:57Z,Can anyone tell me if this torrent includes the closing ceremony (where Shakira sings)?  Or is it just the final game?   Either way thank u very much for the upload.  Iker estuvo FENOMENAL!!!  Hala Madrid!!!
[V],pluto999,2010-07-17T14:12Z,"final ceremony is nearly a gig and 120 mins of football = 3hours+ of movie as it requires higher bitrate so just do the maths, is it possible? The answer is no.nnThank you neonrainbow.. where is the chitchat before and after the game?"
