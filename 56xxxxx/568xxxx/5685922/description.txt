Dungeon Siege is a computer role-playing game developed by Gas Powered Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios. Chris Taylor (from Total Annihilation) showed Dungeon Siege years in production for the first time at E3 2000. The Mac version was published by MacSoft and released on April 25, 2003.

The gameplay  is a mixture of pause-and-go tactical management and point-and-click action. The mechanic is highly similar to that of latter Ultima games (so much so that fans have recreated certain Ultima titles using the Dungeon Siege engine), and to a lesser degree, action RPGs like Diablo or early action role-playing games like Nox. The Dungeon Siege quest is highly linear and involves constant hack and slash battle, similar in some ways to platform and beat 'em up games.

The game engine allows content creation and modification through a released toolkit. New content and modifications are called mods or siegelets. There are many mods created by amateurs available for download on the internet, with features ranging from new graphics to completely new character development systems.
