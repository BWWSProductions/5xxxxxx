,asighkick,2010-07-12T03:43Z,"My condolences on the loss of the World Cup to Spain.  Sorry that I cannot comment further as I much prefer Rugby because it is more enjoyable to see a goal every few minutes rather than once per month!  I do concede that it is a skilled game both in tactics and acting!nnI already have Series 3 of X Factor and will wait until you are able to upload Series One (if you have it) or the XTRA factor for Series 1, 2 or 3.nnBaai Dankie for your uploads (my feeble attempt to remember some Afrikaanse).nnnn"
[V],verovenlo,2010-07-12T04:27Z,i uploaded season 1 already check herernrnrnhttp://thepiratebay.org/search/the%20x%20factor/3/99/0/
,asighkick,2010-07-12T16:32Z,"Yeah, thanks - didn\'t realise that you had uploaded Series One way back in March.  Unfortunately there are only 5 of the 20 torrents actually seeded :(nnAlso, they stop at the Top 4 performances and Results....possibly another four episodes missing.nnIf you find time, are you able to reseed them one at a time, starting at 01?  Even one every two or three days will be fine.. thanks."
