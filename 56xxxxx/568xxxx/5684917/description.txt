"We were going through our notes and came across a band out of Denver named Accordion Crimes. We donΓÇÖt remember where we heard of them or in what context. The name doesnΓÇÖt ring a bell at all and if you look at their MySpace, they have barely any plays on their songs, which is strange given how awesome their music is. We canΓÇÖt even find much written on them. Not even a Pitchfork  review yet?? WTF??"
-This Hearts On Fire

Post-Punk, Lo-Fi, Indie Rock at it's finest.

Enjoy
