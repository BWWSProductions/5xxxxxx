,P2P_DownUnder,2010-08-17T16:08Z,Cheers ;)
,Nicklesbe,2010-08-19T02:40Z,"Hey Hey, Im sure this is a great download if your using a PC. But its kinda garbage if your using a PS3 like I do. Why must it be broken up into 2 Cd's? that's not really the problem tho. The first CD works fine but for some reason CD 2 is unsupported data, now why is this? I find that extremely fishy, or at least badly done. This is a good download tho great if you have a PC based entertainment system however for us console users this download is only half good and not worth the download. "
,remedyVenom,2010-08-20T04:24Z,"It`s so similar to 'Repo! - the genetic opera', because it is based on the same novel.
So it`s not a stolen concept really, 
it`s based on the same book.
(the novel&author were credited in the end titles)
Good movie btw. interesting to watch."

,patman3k,2010-11-14T23:13Z,Don't download... 
,ElCapitanJackSparrow,2011-03-15T23:44Z,Yes...indeed it is like Repo: The Genetic Opera....but it's a little different...not so futuristic as Repo: TGO and not a musical...also in TGO the organs weren't artificial...but the concept was totally stolen I will say that...all in all im sure it'll still be a good film
