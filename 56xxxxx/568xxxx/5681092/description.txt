NOTE: Glad to see ya back around KB. Cant wait for ya to get back in action. :D Continuing the legacy of great quality, KiNGDOM releases... ;) I dont even want to hear it. :lol: Framerate fixed, all is good now. I know it seems like it was 5x, but the first 2 I did were from the XViD which was not great at all. Then the 2 rips from the DVD had a bad frame rate, so here is v2 of the blurred dvdscr. Sample included with motion parts. Sorry bout the previous releases, wont happen again. I was just determined to get it right, as I usually do. TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. ;)
