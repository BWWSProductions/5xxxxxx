,FieroGT,2010-07-14T04:08Z,"i wasn\'t gunna say anything, but sherriff89... how stupid are you? READ, this is AC3. 6 channels.(most voice comes from the center).   u either don\'t have yer center channel on, or yer shit is setup wrong... set yer player to stereo..  i\'m sure ALL vids that were ac3 haven\'t been playin right for you.."

This movie was originally a british comedy, drop dead funny. I feel this is a sad duplication of a truly funny movie. I would encourage everyone to watch the british version first, and then you will understand my low rating of this very poor ""copy"". "
