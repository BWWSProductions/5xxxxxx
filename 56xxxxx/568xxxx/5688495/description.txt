PROPER NOTES

SKIDROW previously released Silent Hunter 5 with the first
of Ubisoft's new DRM shown to the gaming world. While this
first attempt at cracking the new protection, it seemed to
work at first, but soon you will notice that you can't
advance through the game campaigns. The game stays in this
frozen like state so no matter what you do it will remain
unchanged. You can't complete your objectives and then
gain new ones like you should which makes this game
unplayable at that time and needing a proper crack.
ViTALiTY is here to present an alternative crack to this
new protection, one which doesn't require server emulation
and allows you full access to the games features. Enjoy!
