For Thomas Andrew Tresser, aka Nemesis, the world of metahuman espionage is never what it seems. After his recent "reeducation" at the hands of the Global Peace Agency, Nemesis finds himself thrust back into the real world with enemies seemingly around every corner. Tasked with uncovering the truth about his mission and the true identities of those hoping to unleash a great evil on the world, Nemesis is forced to confront the fact that he may not be able to trust anybody in the universe - including himself.
