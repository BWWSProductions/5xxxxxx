Release Notes:
Right many releases out, heres ours ...1stly made a avs script to resize image and tweak the chroma, then loaded into
vdub and i tweaked the colors, lowering the yellow and red, increasing the cyan slightly and added quite a bit of 
brightness...AR Was naff on source, got the correct now , also blurred out the watermark for people who didn't want
it...didn't change the frame rate...just forgot but took too long to encode already to bother with again, added a heavy
deblock filter and a smoothness & sharpness filter. overall looks alot better imho but take it or leave it
