Release Notes:
I took the elektri4ka (thanks elektri4ka) 720p,
I don't know if it's "a real 720p" or an upscale but still the video is
much better the DVD-9.
I checked all the LiNE sounds and IMAGiNE/TA (thanks IMAGiNE/TA) was the best
(in sync and quality).
And then I just muxed them together .

And about the subtitles, the elektri4ka release had hardcoded English
(like the DVD-9) on foreign parts, but also Russian only on foreign parts .
I prefer having a few Russian subtitles in 720p over having 480p without them.[/code]
