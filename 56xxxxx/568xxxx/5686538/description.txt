Release Notes:
Right this is the DVD9 Upscaled because a couple people ask for us to try it and if it came out good release. so in
my opinion it came out pretty good. 1stly thanks to wreck for his help on the avs script . tweaked the colors 
throughout, changing the red lowering the yellow slightly increasing the saturation. Increased the brightness quite
a bit because was pretty dark. Touched the contrast also. Done some other bits also. Overall it looks ok for an upscale
and pretty happy with the output. Hardcoded english subtitles for Foreign parts... Anyway don't normally do upscaled stuff
but if you don't like it move on. Enjoy!
