Serious Sam returns to the roots of first-person shooters, serving up big guns, hordes of enemies, and plenty of attitude. The entire game is steeped in an ancient Egyptian theme, with locations that range from claustrophobic temple passages to wide-open arenas, and with surprises lurking around every corner.

The monsters are uninspired, but Serious Sam substitutes quantity for quality. Enemies do little more than blindly rush at you, but when dozens are converging on your position at the same time things get hectic in a hurry. Fortunately there are plenty of health, armor, and ammunition packs to pick up along the way, so expect a sore trigger finger after fighting all the way through to the game's epic end battle.
