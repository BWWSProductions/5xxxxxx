,Konkor,2010-07-30T16:08Z,"It is fake, I ran this in a sandbox and it pops up with spamware virus warnings trojans the lot. Besides a 10th lobby is a modified disc you CANT do this with a USB or anything else without being able to run the modified disc. So dont try anymore USB tools."

Lazy PB people is why I don't use this site much!

Take out the trash already!!!"
,KennedyJ,2010-10-21T23:57Z,"@Konkor Actually, it's not a modified disc. The xbox is modded, and the modded files for the lobbies are like 6-8GB. But yes, you're right, this is fake(392KB) LOL. Good try, ""ExEn MoDz""."
