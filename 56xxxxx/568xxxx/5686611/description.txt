The Easybeats were a rock and roll band from Australia. They formed in Sydney in late 1964 and split at the end of 1969. They are regarded as the greatest Australian pop band of the 1960s and were the first Australian rock and roll act to score an international pop hit with their 1966 single "Friday on My Mind". The Easybeats manager was former Sydney real estate agent, Mike Vaughan.
The band's line-up exemplified the influence of post-war migration on Australian society. All five founding members were from families who had migrated to Australia from Europe: lead singer Stevie Wright and drummer Gordon Henry "Snowy" Fleet were from England; rhythm guitarist George Young was from Scotland; lead guitarist Harry Vanda and bassist Dick Diamonde were from the Netherlands.
