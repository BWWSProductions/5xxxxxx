FLAWL3SS NOTES
Thanks to IMAGINE for the audio. Not the greatest cam to work with. Its a dark movie to begin with but we think it came out pretty good.
We adjusted the aspect ratio and so forth. Now we wasnt going to do it but with all the pms
We said why the hell not so here it is. Did normal stuff we always do brightness, contrast, saturation, black levels etc.
Now we used the same audio as imagine so it has the same cam audio in the same places. hope you all enjoy. from team flawl3ss.

UPLOADER NOTES
BRIGHT SCENES ARE WATCHABLE BUT DARK SCENES GOES OUT OF FOCUS & A LITTLE DARK...AUDIO GOOD MOST OF THE MOVIE...SOME PARTS THE AUDIO IS LOW QUALITY...THERE IS ALSO SOME HISSING IN THE BACKGROUND...BUT THE BEST OUT SO FAR...OH WELL IT'S FREE...PLEASE COMMENT :)
