,michaeljmcgregor,2010-12-11T08:57Z,The producers of the entire BBC Poirot Series have loosely based their movies on the writings of Agatha Christie's novels.  Why they have done this I do not know but the result is taking masterpieces of writing and changing it to a piece of crap.  Don't waste your time in downloading this but instead download the EMI movie of the same name with Albert Finney and an all star cast that is true to the original text (made around 1979 or 1980).  Call it madness but I purchased this entire series by the BBC - about 70 at 20 bucks a pop and was never happy with any of them.  The only one I did not have was this one as you only got it if you joined up for the whole lot and had to pay by credit card.  Finally I have searched it down and it is truly the final disappointment of them all.

EMO SH*T

Not like the episodes you are used to. 

Also, has a mark in the bottom right corner... and the sound effects are really loud. You cannot hear some of the conversation.
Also there is a huge thing you wouldn't expect.... and other little things.

Basically it's cr*p.
If you have time to waste, watch it.

Good: ending music is great"
