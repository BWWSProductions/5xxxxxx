I spent four days at Geller√•sen racetrack on my 2001 Yahama R1 with Dunlop Sportsmart Sportmax.

Day 1 was SMC Broms och Kurvkurs (braking and cornering training) at level 4 fastest group.

Day 2 was CSS California Superbike School level 1 yellow group

Day 3 was CSS California Superbike School level 2 yellow group

Day 2 was CSS California Superbike School level 3 white group


The .AVI files was made with a rearmounted POV1

The .MP4 files was made with a frontmounted GoPro HD Hero at 720P 60fps


At least two .AVI and one .MP4 is missing, the GoPro gave me an error message once and the POV1 had the memory card shake loose the last two sessions on the last day.


This is training days where we are working on learning specific skillsets each session, so everyone is supposed to ride at no more than 85% capacity an any time.

Overtakings are supposed to be done carefully and with respect to other riders.

On CSS, the first session is always on only one gear (about 4:th) and no brakes, at later sessions we can use 2-3 gears and careful braking. Only the 5:th session is with all gears and full braking.

I pretty much choose the 3:rd gear around the track, sometimes 2:nd to practice "pickup" with a bit more drive after some corners. Hard braking only if i had to pass someone on the straight beore the corner.

Lap times for me was around 1.30 under those conditions. The fast guys do this track at around 1.15 and the race guys is down to 1.05 or so.

The videoclips are probably extremely boring and uninteresting unless you were on the track yourself and ended up ahead or behind my bike...

Please help me seed the files you download!!!
