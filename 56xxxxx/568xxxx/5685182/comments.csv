,uilka,2010-08-03T22:22Z,anybody got it to work on windows 7 64bit?
,stuffer,2010-08-11T15:10Z,Is this the one with cracked .exe or something that works?
,Jaakkima,2010-08-20T10:53Z,"Works on XP32 OK but on Windows 7 64-bit home premium cant get usb-emulator running, it installs but it is its not signed driver and remains es yellow exlamanation status and then mastercam says no SIM found. Anyone solved this problem?"
,XymonSez,2010-08-26T11:20Z,Works fine here with Windows 7 x64. Use Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider. Google it and follow instructions to get the emulator running.
,ryno_,2010-08-28T06:00Z,I second the above comment.  It does work great in Windows 7 x64 as long as you use the Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider.  DSEO 1.3b is what I used and make sure you disable UAC in windows also.   I overlooked that dseo needed UAC disabled at first and after 5 minutes of going through the instructions I disabled it and it worked immediately.
,stv123,2010-09-02T23:43Z,I have tried but can not get it loaded either. Keeps telling me there is no sims loaded. Try to run NHapsX and it finds no hasp. Any suggestions?
,dglover,2010-09-13T18:29Z,will this work with windows xp?
,joedesu1,2010-09-30T03:29Z,Can someone write a step by step install?  I cant seem to get that dseo program working right. And i disabled UAC.  After install mastercam says no sim detected. Running windows 7 pro 64 bit  Any help?
,PartCreator32,2010-10-29T12:55Z,"Thanks Everyone! I had McamX3for about 1 year before I figured out what you were all trying to explain. Got X3 going a month ago, now You gave me X4, Works great, use DSEO. and for some reason, I have to have my ethernet cable pluggedc in ! BUT GREAT JOB, THANKS !!!"
,scottb08,2010-10-31T17:55Z,"-* Got it working on Windows 7 build 7600 x64 *-

Here's what I did:

1) Open up the run dialog box (start, run) and type hdwwiz
2) Click next, Select to install hardware manually. Next.
3) Choose ""Show all Devices"" Next
4) Select ""Have Disk""
5) Browse to the ""..\USB-Emul_Win64 folder from this download. Select the vusbbus. Next, let it install.

Additional Notes
Driver need to be digitally signed
5a) Don't worry about Windows errors that the driver isn't signed and wont work properly.
5b) Disable Window UAC (google it)
5c) Google/download dseo13b.exe
5d) run dseo13b.exe (run as adminstrator)
5e) Enable Test Mode
5f) Reboot!!!
5g) Once restarted, run dseo13b.exe again (run as adminstrator)
5h) Sign a system file, put in ""C:\Windows\System32\drivers\vusbbus.sys"" (without quote marks)
6) Reboot!!!

1) Install mastercamX4-web.exe, use any name for company name.
2) Select Sim Type > NetHASP
3) Run ""mastercam_x4_nethasp_crk.exe"", browse to C:/mcamx and select mastercam.exe click start then OK.
4) Run ""mastercam-dealer-unlim.reg"" to use Mastercam with Delear type of license or ""mastercam-industrial-unlim.reg"" to use it with Industrial  type of license.
5) Copy mastercam.exe from crack folder and replace the one in C:/mcamx
6) Go to C:/mcamx and run the NHaspX program. Make sure it is set to ""NetHasp"" for sim type and ""Local"" for mode. Then hit read, then Ok.
7) Reboot!!!
8) Enjoy!"
,PartCreator32,2010-11-22T01:17Z,"Sorry Don't know what was up with the ethernet cable thing, but it works now. Vista 64bit. I used ""DSEO"" to install the driver. When I shut down laptop I lost it, So I Used ""Ready Driver Plus"" to keep Mcam working. Great Torrent Thanks ! I deleted the ""584B4AE9"" folder, runs a few hrs, then the folder pops up again, causing ""NO SIM"". I have to keep deleting the file ! Anyone know how to fix this? I'm in school for Mcam and this program allows me to do my homeork at ""HOME"", not drive 30-40 minutes to school for assignments. THANK YOU EVERYONE ON TPB"
,PartCreator32,2010-11-24T01:17Z,"Anyone have the same problem of "" SIM LOST "" starting to happen hourly to me ! HELP I'm ready to go back to X3. I have 6 months of school left and I'm spending more time reinstalling HASP than doing homework.   HELP !!! THANKS FOR THE TORRENT THOUGH, LOVE IT !!"
,ForFun00,2010-12-10T02:18Z,"TAL! it works after fout trials. This is what works for me.  Using WXP, SP3. I have more than two HD.
IMPORTANT: 
	Uninstall Mastercam Previous versions
	Copy the installation files to C:\Mastercam_X4, or AT LEAST the ""USB-Emul_Win32"" or it will not work
	For faster install, disconnect internet, exit ZoneAlarms and Spyware detector

USB-Emul Win32 Setup (not confirmed if it works or not, not tested)

1) Open folder ""USB-Emul_Win32"" and run ""install.bat""
2) Wait until system will find and install new devices.
3) Reboot!!!

1) Install mastercamX4-web.exe, use any name for company name.
2) Select Sim Type > NetHASP
3) Run ""mastercam_x4_nethasp_crk.exe"", browse to C:/mcamx and select mastercam.exe click start then OK.
4) Run ""mastercam-dealer-unlim.reg"" to use Mastercam with Delear type of license or ""mastercam-industrial-unlim.reg"" to use it with Industrial  type of license.
5) Copy mastercam.exe from crack folder and replace the one in C:/mcamx
6) Go to C:/mcamx and run the NHaspX program. Make sure it is set to ""NetHasp"" for sim type and ""Local"" for mode.
	Then hit read (it may say ""Local netHASP not found""),
