,Ralphski,2011-01-11T07:26Z,Na.. It IS good
,jenchai,2011-05-29T09:50Z,"Audio sucks, for movie like Top Gun, you should go atleast 700k for bitrate. 

AC3 is 438k. Not quite good since its an action movie with clarity of sound is important. Video seems more than fine. And DTS or Dolby Digital should also be the medium of Audio codec not AC3.

Such a shame, a little bit less on video bitrate and more on audio would have made it perfect."
