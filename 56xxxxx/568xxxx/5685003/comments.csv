,good_Movie,2010-12-08T19:53Z,Please upload an complete 1080p blue ray Rip of the first season - PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!!
,asdasdqweasd,2011-04-22T23:10Z,Why is it filled with torrents? Advertising for free stuff? No thanks. Skiping them has no effect since they are so small files.
,Blackout046,2011-05-04T21:58Z,"Too much space consumption for just 720p. I know it's because of the 22 episodes in high resolution, and each one of them is 44 minutes long. Just thought 1080p would demand to hog so much HD space, not 720p..."
,fsn0w,2011-05-05T20:49Z,Seed plz! I've been downloading this since 4/30 with a speed of ~5kB/s :(
,ProtoX4,2011-05-24T02:14Z,"@Blackout046 Each episode is 1.09 GB. Multiply that by 22 and you get 23.98, plus all the other stuff the uploader put in. it's the same for every other hour-long (42 minute uninterrupted) show. 1080p would be much larger."
