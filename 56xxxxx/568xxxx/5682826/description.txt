IMAGiNE NOTES
Sources used were the the xvid from RelizLab... Thanks Mate...  And our own line audio :)
Work done... We used a few filters on this one to help it out as it's not the best video or audio sources on this one. Used a smoother filter, sharpness filter, white balance filter, rgb eq, contrast and brightness levels... Also increased contrast as the source looked washed out.
Another thing... Towards the ending, there are a bit of autofocus issues in the video... 
Nothing we can do about this sorry...
Now onto the audio... This audio is not the best as we had to do some chopping 
on this one. Our line had some bad areas that had to be removed, so we used 
some cam audio that we we're given by a friend and cut in the 3 places that 
needed it to bring you a full release... :)

UPLOADER NOTES
BRIGHT SCENES ARE WATCHABLE BUT DARK SCENES GOES OUT OF FOCUS & A LITTLE DARK...AUDIO GOOD MOST OF THE MOVIE...SOME PARTS THE AUDIO IS LOW QUALITY...THERE IS ALSO SOME HISSING IN THE BACKGROUND...BUT THE BEST OUT SO FAR...OH WELL IT'S FREE...PLEASE COMMENT :)
