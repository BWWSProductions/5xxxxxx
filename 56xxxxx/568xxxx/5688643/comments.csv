,greensmoke1313,2010-07-13T02:59Z,appreciate the ups but whats with the jpg? windows sucks ass to view comics. unless you are doing it on a portable device. just curious if there is something i\'m missing
,greensmoke1313,2010-07-13T16:04Z,jpg wont work in comic readers like cd display or comic rack.
,nighthel,2010-07-13T18:57Z,@greensmoke1313 : compress the jpgs with winrar/zip and replace the filename with cbr/cbz resp. if u unrar a cbr u get jpgs
,nemo9fish,2010-07-13T20:03Z,"Actually Linux\'s Comix program works pretty well on these jpgs. Just use Comix to open up one of the jpgs and you are good to go. I agree though, cbr/cbz is better."
,greensmoke1313,2010-07-13T20:37Z,worked great! thanks for the info
