,TheWolfmann,2010-07-15T00:58Z,"Absolutely not bad for a cam. I say the video quality is about a watchable 6. The sound though is worse, let\'s say a 5.rnrnI\'d wait for a better quality copy, but for now, this probably is the best option there is on TPBrnrn(i\'m going to delete this copy anyway)."
,nbdelboy,2010-08-05T18:15Z,"Don't know if anyone new this but the R5 was supposedly released today, so i'd wait for that if i were you but if you really want to this movie download this or the flawl3ss TS release. :D"

to use what player. I think 3x something.
No one can force me to use any player.
Unless I am blind. It's a con job. Find 
another copy. I was unlucky to click on
to that copy."
