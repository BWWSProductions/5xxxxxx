,miggelsson,2010-07-20T18:57Z,THESE FUCKING SUBS DON'T WORK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Arszzka,2010-07-27T09:56Z,How do you get the subtitles working?
,ltcmdrData,2010-08-06T04:39Z,"Subtitles worked for me in my video player, but my dvd maker can't use .idx and .sub format subtitles. I found some that would work, .srt format. If you guys want them, you can find them here:

http://www.sub-titles.net/en/ppodnapisi/podnapis/i/815039/evangerion-shin-gekij-ban-ha-2009-subtitles

Hope they help, they worked for me. They are also a little more visible than the white subtitles that came with this file."
,AFewBolts,2010-08-31T18:18Z,Tried the subtitles that came with the torrent and also the files suggested by users and all I'm getting is Chinese text. Can someone explain why these English subtitles are showing up as Chinese on my system?
,Syteri,2010-09-06T21:01Z,The subtitles worked for me after I extracted it from the .rar file in the subs folder. They're easily to read in full screen however they do have some minor miss translations/grammar error. The english audio is very soft though.. I keep having to turn up the volume just to hear them. Overall the video and audio is great.
,Syteri,2010-09-06T21:02Z,"People experiencing the chinese text. I use VLC Media Player. There are 3 subtitles and it seems the video is set to default chinese subtitles. However there is english, you just need to go to video and select it."
,JooPe666,2010-10-02T18:23Z,"Why no english audio track? The japanses voice voers sound FUCKING retarded, the characters sound ridiculous and corny FFS..."

Thanks for the upload. I really appreciate it."
,RawrRawr123,2011-02-01T04:22Z,@JooPe666 Seriously? Japanese dub? Please don't watch any more anime. Ever.
,VisionVirus,2011-02-06T14:40Z,"@JooPe666 The show was made in Japan by a Japanese company, they aren't Japanese voice overs its the actual audio for the show. You're an idiot."
,aienment,2011-03-27T18:03Z,Great upload mate. Thnx a lot.
,Elwopoh01,2011-04-27T19:46Z,Why cant it be in english like the first one?
,Mrsir,2011-05-15T13:33Z,@Elwopoh01 Why cant u be japanese like this movie?
,talassa,2011-05-26T15:34Z,"couldn't use the subs files format from this torrent.

but the links refered by ltcmdrData has .srt subs that seems to work well.

thanks for the upload! ^^"
,the-chojin,2011-07-07T17:35Z,great upload  need to extract subs and drop them into the cd1 and cd2 folder but then subs only work on some players and burners dont recognise them either so i had to dl a new version of the film with working subs 
,snowfairysjoy,2011-07-17T23:43Z,I feel like punching the people who complain about japanese dubs? seriously WTF it is in japanese to begin with and frankly those voices are WAY better then english dub. SERIOUSLY you people are just sooo freaking annoying!
,tetris11,2011-10-17T23:30Z,"Relax. He's referring to the familiarity of the TV series which had English Dubs. 
I'm surprised that no one has yet dubbed this movie."
,schlierkamp,2012-02-14T09:03Z,"@Elwopoh01 If you actually appreciated anime, you would enjoy subs better than English dubs. You have to watch enough to get used to it. Chill the f out."
