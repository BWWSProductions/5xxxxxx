,sherriff89,2010-07-14T03:55Z,"Does this one actually have the audio for people talking, or like your other one where theres only the background noise?"
,brdavs,2010-07-14T12:17Z,The UK original is miiiiles better imho.
,FDNG,2010-07-18T18:57Z,"700?320 is not HD, please note that. But there is one thing that concerns me: I loved the British original. Is this new version better, or more amusing in any way? I guess we just have another example for US picking up great, but America-wise unsellable movies and torturing them. Tell me if I'm wrong."
