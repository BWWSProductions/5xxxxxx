.Ice.Road.Truckers.S04E05.720p.HDTV.x264-MOMENTUM

Jack Jesse rushes to save an Alaskan town with an emergency fuel
delivery, but a blinding storm stops him cold on the thin ice of
the frozen river road to Nuiqsut. Lisa Kelly gets her big chance
to step up when she's given her first oversize load, but as she
battles the elements and the law, Lisa wonders if her trucking
skills are up to the test. Ray takes a night run as a favor for
the boss, but he makes a trucker's worst mistake when he reaches
for something on the dashboard. The rubber meets the road when
Alex's trash talk stirs the sleeping Polar Bear and a hell bent
Hugh Rowland races to Coldfoot to even the score.
