,crapsound,2010-07-31T18:40Z,"The game works but it skips the character selection screen.
And no it's not a demo version, the TiNYiSO folder is in the image...mounted image...open the virtual drive and its there."
,eboknight3,2010-08-01T07:59Z,I have got it downloaded but I do not know what to do next. Please help.
,crapsound,2010-08-10T16:22Z,"1. Unzip the file (t-as2con.rxx) first.
2. Use something like DAEMON Tools to mount the "".cue"" file.
3. Like what is said: Install.
4. After installing open the virtual drive (like how you open a folder) and you'll see the TiNYiSO folder...well you get the rest I guess."
,rmen0.0,2010-10-21T20:38Z,"The ""crack"" leaves the game in demo mode. It still wants a reg key and still only works for a few minutes before self-terminating."
