,pariahdog,2010-10-21T12:32Z,"Thank you so much for this upload. There are currently 2 seeders and 4 leechers in the swarm. If the seeders happen to read this please force superseeding if you can. I have a 4.3 megabyte/sec (35 megabit) upload capacity and I will seed this to at least a 2:1 ratio due to its rarity (I usually stop at 1:1). I can multiply your upload speed,  but I can't upload what I don't have."
,Kel163,2010-11-04T05:32Z,"Just enable initial seeding in uTorrent. I'm still seeding this, so now leechers from me will do so too."

But this isn't such a bad news. :)
This torrent contains only DVD music version.
I've worked on my own project called ""Roswell Restoration"".
This means that all of The Original Broadcast songs of Roswell Musical Soundtrack is RESTORED!

Basically, this project was started on Demonoid and been uploaded there on 05/31/2011. Now I've uploaded Roswell Restoration project here, if someone is interested:
