This is PSS's 777 that was initially made for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, but i modified it to work with FSX. 

I have been searching for a realistic Boeing 777 for FSX and the only one i came up with was Wilco Pub's 777 but that has some major flaws with the fmc, cold and dark start ups and other stuff.

I made an installer to install to your FSX folder


To access the overhead panel you need to go to the view toolbar and select it from the instruments panel menu.

Liveries are included as well

Enjoy.......
