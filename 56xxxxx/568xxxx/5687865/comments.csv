,LenaIsAPirate,2010-07-17T20:09Z,Is this a safe torrent?
,ghalan,2010-07-18T00:39Z,"Yup .I scanned it with bit defender before i uploaded it ,and everything was ok + The stuffs aren\'t affecting your game. You know there are some custom objects that if you add in your game,they make it crash. Well i am using the entire pack and everything works perfect, no problems with loading,no problems with virus etc."
,TCryptT,2010-07-21T20:10Z,"Very nice torrent everything installs and runs perfectly.
ghalan you should compress your torrents because i compressed the torrent with 7z and compressed 1.42GB to 302MB and its very big difference!!!"
,TCryptT,2010-07-24T18:06Z,Scaned it with ESET Smart Security and found no virus`es
,N1K2,2010-07-26T19:23Z,"In your info it says it's illegal to sell anything related to the Sims 3 on other sites. Well, FYI, EA changed the EULA to allow that type of stuff, and they've shown tons of support for those paysites before, even before the EULA change. 

Simply put, EA does not care. Paysites still do need to be destroyed though.

Get tons of free CC (Custom Content) you would normally have to pay for at paysites.mustbedestroyed.org Click the main link on the top of the site. (You mentioned the site, but never posted a link)"

,SC4922,2010-08-07T19:26Z,"I only have Sims 3-- not the expansion packs (I don't want them).  Can I use only the items that work for the original game? Will the launcher be able to tell which items don't need the expansions? 

I don't care about using every item. I just want to use the ones that don't require expansion packs. "
,wjziv,2010-08-11T16:59Z,"How do i fix the ""Regional install code is different"" Error? "
