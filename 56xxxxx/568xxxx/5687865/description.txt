What does this torrent include?

 For sure if you like ΓÇ£The Sims 3ΓÇ¥ created by EA Games, this pack will make your day. We all like to have new stuffs in our game, but the biggest problem is when we access a site and it asks us for money or to upgrade to premium account to download them .Well I must tell you that selling anything for SIMS 3 ,that is not on the official website is illegal. So all the downloading web sites,that are asking us for money are illegal . But I am here to help you,and offer you a lot of objects/clothes/hairs/lots(that you can get by paying) for free.. I told you ,this torrent will make your dream come true.

I donΓÇÖt take credits for the works inside the torrent. I can tell you that all of them work fine without causing any crash in the game.

So donΓÇÖt contact me for designing new objects,I am simply collecting objects that are for sale,and giving it to you for free.
