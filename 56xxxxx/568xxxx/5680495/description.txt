Katt Williams, who got his big break as the scene-stealing, fast-talking pimp Money Mike in the film "Friday After Next", currently plays Apempnamedslickback on TV's animated series "The Boondocks" and appears in MTV's Nick Cannon Presents: Weild 'N Out. Not only is he one of today's fastest rising actors, he's also one of the most hysterical stand-up comedians on the scene. Returning to his hometown of Cincinnati, Williams says and does exactly what he feels, provoking nonstop laughter on everything from sex, relationships and parethood to his shattered L.A. illusions. In his first full-length solo DVD, Williams connects with his audience like few other comedians as he pipms out some street-savvy advice and outrageously funny observations.
