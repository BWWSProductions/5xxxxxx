----------
 
  
  Music & Me is a Nate Dogg solo album released by Elektra Records in 2001. It received a fair amount of critical and commercial success upon release. Its popularity was led by the hit single "I Got Love" which reached #33 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart. The album's success was also because of its various vocal guest appearances from Dr. Dre, Xzibit, Kurupt, Fabolous, Ludacris, Pharoahe Monch, Snoop Dogg, Tha Eastsidaz, Jermaine Dupri, B.R.E.T.T., and Lil' Mo. Most of these guest appearances turned this into more of a hip-hop album than an R&B album. The album includes production by Bink!, Dr. Dre, Mel-Man, Battlecat, Damizza, Fredwreck Nassar, Mike City, Bryan Michael-Cox, Megahertz. According to SoundScan it has sold 400,000 copies to date.
