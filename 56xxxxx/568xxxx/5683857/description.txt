Red Star Red Army Chorus, Red Army Chorus or Alexandrov Ensemble. In 1949 the ensemble was named officially the A. V. Alexandrov Soviet army twice red-bannered and red-starred song and dance ensemble, so it was not the Red Army Choir any more. In 1978 the ensemble was renamed to the A. V. Aleksandrov Soviet army twice red-bannered and red-starred academic song and dance ensemble.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union the ensemble was renamed the A. V. Alexandrov Russian army twice red-bannered academic song and dance ensemble.
