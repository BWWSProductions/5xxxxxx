However why upload it in RAR format.... not that annoying just don't understand why, is there some particular reason to upload in RAR format? I'm genuinely curious, does it help speed? Things in RAR format make me worry about hidden files and viruses. 

That being said...

Awesome upload, great quality Thank you very much scenebalance!!!"

Many files are uploaded in places where size is limited, also several RAR files makes for easy repairs if one part is/gets broken."
