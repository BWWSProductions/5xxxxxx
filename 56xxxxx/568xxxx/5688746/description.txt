         Go back to a time before the invention of artificial          
         light and experience a world petrified in the pitch of        
         darkness...when fear ruled the night. Throughout the ages,    
         real and imagined terror existed in the absence of light,     
         and nighttime was anything but relaxing. Our predecessors     
         cowered in caves to keep from being eaten alive. During the   
         Middle Ages, brutal bandits went on the prowl and roadside    
         ditches became death traps. Also in years past, the devil,    
         werewolves and vampires were staunchly believed to stalk      
         the night. With no artificial light, the black night sky      
         of Galileo's gaze could illuminate every star without a       
         telescope. This chilling special explores all the reasons     
         why the dark was so feared throughout the eras. It takes      
         you around the globe to places where real night still         
         exits, and examines our modern-day fear factor when the       
          lights go out during blackouts.
