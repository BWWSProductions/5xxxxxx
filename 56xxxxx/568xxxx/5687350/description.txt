Crash 'n' Burn is a racing game where the focus is on aggressive and dangerous driving. The game features online support for 16 players and is Eidos' first online console game. Choose your car, paint it and personalise it. Build it up with new components, giant spoilers and reinforced fenders. Supercharge it, fill it with nitrous and take it to the back street circuits of Miami, San Francisco, L.A. and New York. Your primary objective is to take first place; your secondary objective is to run everyone else off the road. The aim is not just to win races, but to survive them!

Climax's Brighton studio, the developers of MotoGP for the Xbox, is the developer behind the wheels of this blistering online racer.
