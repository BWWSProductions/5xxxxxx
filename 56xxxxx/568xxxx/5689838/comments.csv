[T],brodahisou,2010-07-14T11:23Z,"Albatross Exploding Funny Books was a small publisher founded in 2002 by Eric Powell and Robin Powell for the sole purpose of publishing Eric\'s creator owned book The Goon.  The eccentric name of the company was inspired by Monty Python\'s Flying Circus and the metal band Iron Maiden\'s song Rime of the Ancient Mariner based on the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem of the same name.  Luckily Eric and Robin\'s risk came with reward as the Goon almost instantly generated an internet buzz and turned into an independent hit.  Shortly thereafter Dark Horse Comics came calling and the Goon found a perfect fit and permanent home with the Oregon based publisher.nnWhile the Goon thrives at Dark Horse Comics, winning five Eisner Comic Industry Awards since moving to the publisher, and Eric continues to publish new projects through them, he always missed his independent comic roots and regretted having to walk away from the company he and Robin worked so hard and risked so much to begin.  So in order to keep their publishing company going, Eric decided to release small specialty projects through Albatross Exploding Funny Books starting in 2009.nnThe first of which is Eric\'s first sole creator project since the Goon.  An all ages book called Chimichanga, which is a whimsical tale of a bearded girl named Lula living in a freak circus that has fallen on hard times.  However, when Lula makes a trade with a witch, she becomes the guardian of an egg that hatches into the possible saving grace for the circus owner.  Chimichanga was originally created when Eric was asked to pitch an idea for an animated television series.  Unfortunately, the concept was not picked up by the network.  But Eric\'s two sons loved the characters so much that he decided to created a three-issue comic book series based on the idea."
