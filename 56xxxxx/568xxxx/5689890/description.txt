Assume the role of the flamboyant Rico Rodriguez â€“ an undercover CIA operative specializing in regime change - as he tries to overthrow the corrupt government of San Esperito. This rogue South American island is suspected of stockpiling WMDs and itâ€™s your job to negate the threat to world peace. It could be to your advantage that this tropical paradise is about to implode as various factions vie for power â€“ it just needs a gentle nudge in the right direction. Just Cause offers the freedom to tackle your assignment however you want: play the islandâ€™s factions off against one another; incite a rebellion among the masses; or build alliances with rebel forces and drug cartels. The game world consists of 1,225 sq. miles of mountains, jungles, beaches, cities and villages which can be explored by land, sea and air. And you will have at your disposal a varied and exciting array of vehicles, planes and watercraft.
