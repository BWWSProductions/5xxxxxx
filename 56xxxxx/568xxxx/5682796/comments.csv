,chronkid,2010-07-12T04:34Z,Legit! .. Works as VR describes. Thank you for the info VR!
,t_P50,2010-07-12T15:55Z,"Horrible HORRIBLE video quality starting from the part when they try to get some sleep in the hideout. Completely out of focus for 99% of the time starting from that point. You can get a gist of the plot etc. from watching it like that but if you want to enjoy the movie, skip this.nThe video source is actually the same as this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5686507/Predators_2010_TS_READNFO_XViD_-_IMAGiNE but the audio is improved. Most of the conversation still impossible to make out.nnV2/A4"
,tom444422,2010-07-12T17:47Z,Agreed with the above poster. Still thanks to SAFCuko09 for putting it up but am gonna wait until theres a better copy around.Obviously VR sets a different standard to whats watchable :(:)
