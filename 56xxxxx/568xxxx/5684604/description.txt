Osho - Bodhidharma - The Greatest Zen Master - Remastered

This is a remastered version to improve sound quality and remove
the defects of the source material, minimize the noise, rumble and
other distracting sound characteristics and make the voice sound
more intimate so your contact becomes closer.

Note: The source material quality is pretty bad and there is limit
to what can be done to correct defects.
