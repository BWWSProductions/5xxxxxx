It is preferable to use that version unless you have your reasons to download the discourse only version."
,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-10T21:40Z,"Osho was formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his teachings led members of his cult to poison over 700 people in The Dalles, OR in 1984.  He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his 'teachings' are the same - dangerous and insane.  "
