The other one had an issue but the site wouldn\'t let me delete it for some reason.nIf you have any troubles with this one, the primary page for it is on Demonoid (that\'s also the tracker).nnThese FLAC files are the original rips from the Simon & Schuster audio CDs that I used for \""Absolute Pimsleur\'s Japanese [Release 2]\"", which was an MP3 release. You can still find that one around somewhere if you search for it, but its original page/content was lost. The real MP3 release is ~1.87GB and is unarchived (you can select individual files/tracks)."

,halofubar,2010-08-24T22:10Z,"As of today (8-24-10) I noticed that this torrent is missing from Demonoid. Not sure what happened to it, it was very well-received and constantly seeded. So... looks like for now we should just be happy that it is also here. :)"
,AJSaK07,2010-11-30T16:36Z,"Amazing! Great stuff, thanks for sharing something really important for those trying to learn Japanese!

I wonder why anybody else has left you a comment... this damn leechers, they just download and they don't even say thanks and btw too bad that this torrent was erased from demonoid :( but like you said ""we should just be happy that it is also here"".

Thanks for sharing!"
