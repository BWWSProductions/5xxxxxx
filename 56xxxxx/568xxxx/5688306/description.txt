Absolute Pimsleur's Japanese FLAC contains the complete set of the Pimsleur Japanese audio language learning programs (levels 1-2-3 or Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced) in a lossless format that can be played directly or converted to your favorite codec type (mp3, ogg vorbis, etc). This is the definitive set to have if you're interested in learning Japanese or providing one of the hitherto mentioned conversions for others!

Included in this release:

    * Pimsleur's Japanese Level 1, 3rd Edition [30 Lessons, 30 Readings]
    * Pimsleur's Japanese Level 2, 2nd Edition [30 Lessons, 30 Readings]
    * Pimsleur's Japanese Level 3, 2nd Edition [30 Lessons, 30 Readings]
    * Miscellaneous Books/Texts including the Owner's Manual, all optional

Each lesson is about 30 minutes long, and the readings cover different cultural aspects and are expected to be read after you've completed all of the lessons for that program set.

Enjoy!
