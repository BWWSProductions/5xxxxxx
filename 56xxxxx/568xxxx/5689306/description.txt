Step into the armored suit and become one of the most-fabled Marvel Comics characters in this game inspired by the second Iron Man movie. Iron Man 2 may not give you a taste of Tony Stark's billionaire lifestyle, but it more than makes up for it by overdosing on Iron Man action. Amped up gameplay delivers a more explosive experience for this sequel, with new environments to blow apart, new enemies to fight against, and new ways to take them down. Use Stark's lab to develop new technologies and customize your suit for each mission in an original Iron Man storyline created just for this game.
