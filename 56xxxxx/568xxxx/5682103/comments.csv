It skirts over the well known history without any other witness or expert input. He harps on about Dunkirk being a major failure by Hitler which is incorrect, Dunkirk was a major British achievement, but those soldiers were never used to protect the British Homeland anyway and it mainly came down to Radar the RAF and fighter production which would have applied even without Dunkirk. nnThe most frustrating thing about this documentary is the dreadful editing. I suspect this may have been originally made in 4:3. Here it is widescreen and heads are constantly cut off or it\'s positioned badly at the bottom of the screen when it should be the top and so on.nnIt\'s as if this was made by a history teacher in a school for his class of 12 year olds. A very unprofessionally made and screened result."
