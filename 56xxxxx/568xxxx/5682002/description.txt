History Explorer: Sinking by Sabotoge

John Chatterton dives the remains of a ship recently found off Florida whose past is as illustrious as her demise was mysterious. The Eleanor Bolling was the workhorse that carried Admiral Richard Byrd on his 1928 Antarctic expedition. But after Byrd's return to a New York City tickertape parade, his historic ship was soon forgotten and eventually sold in 1937. Renamed the Vamar, she began service as a cargo carrier in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. In March 1942, as the Battle of the Atlantic raged and German U-boats savaged Allied shipping, the Vamar left Florida headed for Cuba. The weather was fair, the seas calm, when suddenly, she sank without warning. Was she torpedoed? Did she hit a mine? Or was her captain in reality a Nazi spy who sank her as an act of sabotage
