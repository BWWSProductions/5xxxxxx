Before you start installing Vadis so, change the computer date to 2005-01-01. Then follow the description how to install Vadis.


To avoid having to change the date every time you use Vadis, you can do this:

To change the file, follow these steps AFTER you Vadis installed on your computer:

Open Windows Explorer

Click on Local Disk (C :)
Click for info
Click on the Windex
Click on the ini
Right-click on cdinfo and choose properties, uncheck the write-protect the box and click ok
Double-click cdinfo, look up the year 2005 in three places and change's to tex 2015, click the archive when you changed the dates and select save.
Then turn down the window and start Vadis how it works Vadis in 2015 without having to change the date on your computer every time you use the program."
