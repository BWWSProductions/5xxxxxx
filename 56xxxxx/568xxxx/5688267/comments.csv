,redactedwv,2011-09-08T22:00Z,"Great quality, a/v-wise (as always w/ TvTeam).

Interesting show too. Well done/acted. The lead actress is really good. I'm only on the third ep, so i dunno if it ends 'well' - but it's good-to-above average tv/mystery stuff.

Though at this point i'd like to strangle her uncle.... Or beat him to death... Can't decide.

Anyway: Recommended all around.

Thx again to all s/'ls and TvTeam."
