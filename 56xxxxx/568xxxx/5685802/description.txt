Aquazone Deluxe for Mac and PC

Aquarium simulation game as close as you can get to the real thing. Fish live, breed, and die within the virtual aquarium that you set up. This game is old. I believe the first edition came out in 1993 this one is circa 97-98 and is for Windows 95. This is the edition before Smith-Micro took over the Aquazone series from 9003Inc and turned Aquazone into a crappy screensaver app. I love this game, and is a must try for aquarium enthusiasts. Sadly, I don't see this game offered around the net anymore so I am starting this torrent to keep it alive.

This program is confirmed working on a PC with XP and Macs with Classic OS installed. It is confirmed NOT working on Windows 7 64bit, other than that I am not sure

The torrent is just the Aquazone CD ISO file
The disk contains:

Neon Tetras
Leopard Catfish
Angelfish
Black Mollies

I have alot more fish as seperate add-ins which I may add in another torrent later if anyone wants them.

Enjoy :-)
