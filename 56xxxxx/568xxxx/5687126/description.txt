  The Intellivision is a video game console released by Mattel in 1979.
  Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the 
  introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600. The word intellivision 
  is a portmanteau of "intelligent television". Over 3 million Intellivision 
  units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console.

* Intellivision can be considered the first 16-bit game console, 
  as the registers in the microprocessor, where the mathematical logic 
  is processed, are 16 bits wide. It can however be considered a 10-bit system 
  because the CPU's instruction set and game cartridges are 10 bits wide.

* The Intellivision was also the first system to feature downloadable games. 
  Although, without a storage device the games vanished once the machine was 
  turned off. In 1981, General Instrument teamed up with Mattel to roll out the 
  PlayCable, a device that allowed the downloading of Intellivision games 
  via cable TV.

* Intellivision was the first game console to provide real-time human and robot 
  voices in the middle of gameplay, courtesy of the IntelliVoice module.
  The voice chip used, the SP0256 Orator, was developed jointly by Mattel
  and General Instrument.

* Intellivision was the first console to feature a controller with a
  directional pad that allowed 16 directions. The disc-shaped pad allowed
  players to control action without lifting the thumb and was considered by
  many Intellivision users to be a useful innovation. However, the ergonomics
  of the "action" buttons on the side of the controller were poor, and the
  disc-pad was perceived by potential buyers as unfamiliar. Along with cost,
  this was one of the factors in making the Intellivision less popular than 
  the Atari 2600. However, it is interesting to note that the method of
  controlling movement on the Intellivision, with the thumb, is emulated in 
  many subsequent video game controllers. The joystick-style controller, as 
  seen on the VCS, has not been widely emulated on later consoles.
  A third-party joystick attachment was available by around 1984,
  that was installed by opening the controller and fitting the paddle over
  the disc. A flange around the hollow plastic conical joystick held it in
  securely when the controller's upper cover was replaced; and a much easier
  joystick control was the result. The Joystick was about three inches in
  height; it could not be gripped by the entire hand.

* The Intellivision was also the first game console or home computer to offer
  a musical synthesizer keyboard. The Music Synthesizer keyboard was designed
  as a secondary add-on for the ECS, and was intended to lead to a series of
  music-oriented software titles for both educational and entertainment
  purposes, but only one title, Melody Blaster, was ever released.


  The 1980s saw the dawn of the home video game system. One of the most
  popular was INTELLIVISION - Intelligent Television! During its ten-year run,
  Intellivision sold more than 3 million game players and 10 million game
  cartridges. It became the favorite of many gamers who still long to play
  these games today - 30 years later! Rediscover what the frenzy was all
  about: these pioneering games, with their simple, blocky graphics, are as
  fun and addictive today as they were back then!

  * 10 original games including: Astrosmash, Night Stalker, Shark! Shark!,
    Las Vegas Poker & Blackjack, Snafu, Space Armada, Skiing, Motocross,
    Super Pro Wrestling, & Super Pro Football.
