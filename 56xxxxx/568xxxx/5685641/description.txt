Commodore Microcomputers was one of a pair of computer magazines published by Commodore Business Machines in support of their 8-bit home computer lines of the 1980s. The other was called Commodore Microcomputers. It was published Bi-monthly.

Commodore Microcomputers initially primarily served Commodore's business customers but as those users standardized on CP/M and later MSDOS, the coverage of the two magazines essentially overlapped, with the last official Commodore Microcomputer magazine issue published  onNovember/Dec 1986. Starting January 1987 both magazines were switched from a bi-monthly to a monthly schedule and retitled Commodore Magazine.

* Issue 1-10 were known as the "Commodore Newsletter of the PET Users Club"
