,BondClint,2011-09-25T21:55Z,"@ willbeonekenobi - Never say Never again was distributed by MGM too but it wasn't produced by Eon Productions like the rest of the James Bond movies, in fact you can find it on DVD but not in the boxset with the other movies but seperate and distributed by Warner Bros. & MGM, there's also another version of Casino Royale from 1967 starring David Niven and Peter Sellers but wasn't produced by Eon Productions too but MGM distributes it.

Never Say Never Again is a 'remake' if Thunderball in a way, still worth to watch like all the other Bond films, I can't say anything about the 1967 Casino Royale because I haven't watched it.

Info about Casino Royale (2006)  - The DVD edition of Casino Royale didn't contain DTS audio, but the European and American release of Quantum of Solace did contain DTS audio and they're not Ultimate Edition.

Dr. No - Die Another Day were released as Ultimate Editions, except Never say Never again."
