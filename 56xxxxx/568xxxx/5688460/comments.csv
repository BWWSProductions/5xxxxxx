,slipknot0,2011-04-10T18:51Z,"it says that it cant find some .dll file
is anyone else having thus problem???
im reinstalling xp"
,slipknot0,2011-04-10T19:28Z,smwdmif.dll
[T],RedHatcc,2011-06-23T02:36Z,"Yes you can use the product key and it will be legit. Also, if you are missing a .dll file or any files while loading setup (initial blue setup screen), try a different cd-rom/dvd-rom and/or ram. Its confusing to explain, but works. 

Been awhile, but you can also drop these files on your hdd and run the winnt.exe in your 32 folder, and start the setup as a gui. But the basic pop in the disk and reload is always the cleanest method. GL"
[T],RedHatcc,2011-06-23T02:36Z,my correction (i think lol) winnt32.exe
