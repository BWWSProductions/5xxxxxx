Players can join in on the action at any time in the co-operative multiplayer mode to form a team of up to four players. Together, teams can navigate through ShrekΓÇÖs two realities while solving mind-bending puzzles, and fending off RumplestiltskinΓÇÖs army of baddies.

A single-player experience is also offered, which allows the player to switch between the four characters as needed at any time.
