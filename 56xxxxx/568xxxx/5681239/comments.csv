,nzkfc,2010-07-12T09:02Z,"Ok if you can upload the farmingsimulator.xml file that would work, cannot believe you don\'t test your games before uploading >"
,nzkfc,2010-07-13T11:25Z,"Ok....... so I\'m determined to get this to work, so far I have downloaded two cracks from TpB but none work, however I found the solution for all of it cept the crack for this edition.nn1. Install gamen2. Don\'t install crack, run the game.n3. When it asks for CD key use: RLDST-5JCYP-FZ5FJ-JTJA3-XPHM9n"
,kevmeister95,2010-07-26T03:04Z,"there are some good mods out that work on this as well...

http://www.farmingsimulator.com/  has some good mods

http://www.ls-mods.de/downloads.php  has mods but I'm not sure about how they work with an unregistered version..."
,troxtrox,2010-07-26T03:41Z,"As nzkfc outlined, first start the game with the original exe's, enter his serial key... THEN replace the exes with the cracked ones and it works.
Otherwise it gives a ""no CD"" error.

Now what i need is a manual for this thing, the game has precious little indications.
Then for an update to 1.1 and another crack."
