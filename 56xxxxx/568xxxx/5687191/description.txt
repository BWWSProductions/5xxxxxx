France, 1648: Richelieu and Louis XIII are dead, the new king is a minor, and the Duc de Lavalle is in virtually open rebellion, scheming to seize power. As a last resort, Queen Anne summons the heirs of the original Musketeers to her aid...including Claire, daughter of Athos, who when she chooses can miraculously pass as a boy, and wields as fine a sword as any. All their skills will be needed for a battle against increasing odds. One for all and all for one!

This is a special one -- not exactly a pirate movie, but definitely high adventure! Another special thing about this is that it was taken from a Master tape, used for broadcasting.

Also, it may be old news, but I heard this afternoon that 20th Century Fox closed it's department dedicated to releasing their old films on DVD and stopped all restorations. So, if you enjoy these ripping adventures, PLEASE go out and buy the DVD!

Enjoy!
