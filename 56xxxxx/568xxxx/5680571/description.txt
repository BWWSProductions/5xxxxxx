Milenge Milenge is a story of love and destiny between Priya (Kareena Kapoor) a student and an assistant choreographer in Mumbai and Amit (Shahid Kapoor) who lives in Delhi.

Priya is an orphan who hopes to have a family of her own and keeps a diary outlining her dreams and the type of man she wants to meet – someone who does not drink, smoke or tell lies. She is skeptical when a tarot reader, Sunita Rao, predicts that she will go to South Africa and find the love of her life in seven days. She is pleasantly surprised when she is selected to go to a Youth Festival in South Africa.

Amit, who is from Delhi, also goes to South Africa and he is everything Priya does not want in a man. Amit and his friend break into the girl’s dorm and while they are being chased by a matron, Amit enters Priya’s room and is struck by her beauty. He steals her diary and makes a copy of it and replaces it.

Knowing exactly what Priya wants, he pursues her and they fall in love but their happiness is shattered when Priya realizes he has read her diary and lied to her. She breaks up with Amit despite his protests. He tells her it was destiny which brought them together. 

Priya decides to test destiny and asks Amit to write his full name on a fifty rupee note and buys a notebook with it. She writes her full name and phone number in the book and gives it to an old book shop. She feels that if destiny really meant for them to be together they’d find the note and the book again and find each other.

Three years later Priya and Amit are engaged to marry different people. 

Will the fifty rupee note and the notebook find their way back into Priya and Amit’s hands and bring them back together? Or does destiny have other plans for them?
