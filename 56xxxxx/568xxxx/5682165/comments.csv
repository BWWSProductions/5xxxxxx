,zmm22,2010-07-13T21:57Z,"my video is all messed up...the feet aren\'t even attached to the legs, faces aren\'t attached to heads, hands to arms, etc. help?"
,chill06,2010-07-14T05:15Z,@MuttleyPTnDrag all the files to desktop and then app.nn@zmm22nI\'m having the same problem bro.
,rei-chan2,2010-07-14T14:48Z,"I have the exact same problem with zmm22.nnLegs, teeth, arms, all detached from rest of the body, even when the characters move. every single character\'s body is messed up, basically..nnAnyone know what can be done?"
[T],x___x,2010-07-14T19:05Z,Install the engine first then copy the bully application to your applications folder (simply drag) then run it. Works fine for me but it does crash when i quit the game but this isn\'t really an issue.
,RtI76ADps,2010-07-16T10:25Z,yeah everything is fine for me. Except when I go into town it will just randomly quit so it gets quiet annoying when i have to repeat what I have just done! Any chance there is a fix for this?
,MuttleyPT,2010-07-16T12:36Z,Thank for the help. It works perfectly. It does crash when I quit the game.
[T],x___x,2010-07-16T18:38Z,If your computer locks up after the crash when you\'ve quit the game simply hold down the cmd key & the alt key and press escape. It will kill the process.
,dunl7982,2010-07-16T19:46Z,i figured out why it randomly crashes. it does not have the v 1.2 patch. how to install the patch i have no idea but thats why it randomly quits.
,RtI76ADps,2010-07-16T21:36Z,yeah you are right it does need the v1.2 patch. I tried to install the patch in crossover but that didnt work. Anyone know how to install the patch.
[T],x___x,2010-07-17T16:42Z,I\'m having no issues and didn\'t need to patch it.nnWhats gone wrong?
,dunl7982,2010-07-18T05:41Z,ummm well after about ten minutes of play I have to try and save as much as I can because my game randomly crashes. This started around when I started going into town. I did a little research and found out that a patch was released to fix the problem. Also the game crashes whenever i try to load a game or go to the main menu
,RtI76ADps,2010-07-18T12:02Z,yeah i have the same problem as duni7982. have you made it to town yet because it only happened once i went to town?
,dunl7982,2010-07-18T22:25Z,yes RtI76ADps I have. I have done one or two missions out there but it takes way too long to mess with because of the constant crashing. It is a great game and thank you for the upload but we need a patched version of it 
,dunl7982,2010-07-19T21:47Z,can somebody please figure out how to patch this game. it is becoming unplayable
,RtI76ADps,2010-07-20T12:47Z,I agrreeeee HOW DO I PATCH IT GRRRRRRRRRRRR
