To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the start of Ray Galton and Alan Simpson???s remarkable and prolific writing partnership, the duo reworked four favourite scripts originally written for television.? Of particular interest was The Offer, a programme which in its original form developed into the highly popular Steptoe and Son TV series: the new version was relocated to the north of England and starred Freddie Jones and John Thomson as the bickering father and son.


1: Clicquot et Fils
M Clicquot has a plan to improve his ailing business. Richard Griffiths and Josie Lawrence star in the funeral parlour comedy.
A firm of undertakers in 1920s France has fallen on hard times, usurped by its more modern rivals. What it needs is a really sumptuous funeral - an old-fashioned, publicity-gathering blockbuster... With Richard Griffiths, Roger Lloyd Pack and Josie Lawrence.

2: Naught For Thy Comfort
Richard the airline purser has a loving and grateful wife. Or does he?
If, after having been dumped by your wife, you decide to commit suicide, you would think somebody would try to stop you. You do not expect the Samaritans to moan about being phoned in the early hours of the morning. With Robert Dawes and Nina Wadia.

3: A Clerical Error
Conman Caleb is out of prison - and into more trouble...
A con man who dresses as a clergyman to get money for religious charities is asked to talk a would-be suicide down from a balcony. With Keith Barron and June Whitfield.

4: The Offer
The story of Albert and Harold, father and son rag-and-bone men, who cannot live with and cannot live without one another. This piece was later developed to become 'Steptoe and Son'. With Freddie Jones and John Thomson.
