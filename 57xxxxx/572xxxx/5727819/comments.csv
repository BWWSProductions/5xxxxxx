,itworks22,2011-08-07T22:24Z,"Straight forward to download/install/overwrite - no problems at all - no worries about viruses/trojans.

I have tried several undelete programs with mixed results. 'Recover My Files' does seem to offer greater results and still be relatively easy to use. 

Big thanks to the uploader."
