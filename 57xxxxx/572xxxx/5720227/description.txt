Os fuzis (The Guns) is, arguably, Ruy Guerra's greatest political film. The action is set in Brazil's semi-arid, underdeveloped Northeastern backlands (the sertÃ£o ), and Guerra uses numerous devices, in addition to location shooting, to give his film the look of a documentary. The film's plot and sub-plot weave together the political problems of the oppression of the villagers by the military and by the forces of fanatic religious mysticism, but unlike many Latin American political films, Os fuzis not only avoids facile political solutions, but it also features complex characters and interpersonal relations.
