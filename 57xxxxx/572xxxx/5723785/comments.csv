We have mapped the human genome and can see mutations in every generation.....   

This is good if you believe in magic. Just don't be a hypocrite and not believe in Santa. 

Ask youself did I get past grade 10 or have failing marks on graduation... If yes then you probably get into crap made for the uneducated."

This is the reason why this is shared, not the themes of using the said constructions to gain power.  There are also people interested in Pyramidology and the connection to the Hebrews storing the Ark there."

These two men were Nikola Tesla and Thomas Henry Moray. Look them up and you will find connections between what Les Brown says and what these men proved in science. I'm not saying I believe everything Les Brown claims in this video, but he makes a connection that helps me furthur understand the energy Tesla and Moray spoke so dearly about."
