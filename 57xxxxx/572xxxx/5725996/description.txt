The Wreckers were an American country duo formed in 2005
by Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp, both of whom had
solo recordings before the duo's foundation. In 2006, the
duo released its debut album Stand Still, Look Pretty,
which produced a Number One single on the Billboard Hot
Country Songs in its lead-off single "Leave the Pieces."
The album accounted for a Top Ten hit on the same chart
in "My, Oh My" as well. After its release, both Branch
and Harp returned to being solo singers. Harp has since
had Top 40 country success of her own with the single
"Boy Like Me".
