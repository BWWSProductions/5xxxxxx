FLAWL3SS NOTES
Thanks to CiRiTH for the source and the audio.
Not a bad TC from our friends the chinesse. There is some slight ghosting here and there but not bad. We did our normal stuff. Saturation, gama, contrast and brightness and some sharpening.
Also the audio for the end credits is not there. Hope you all enjoy. From team FLAWL3SS.
