It always takes longer to download when a torrent is new.

Thanks again to the uploader :)

Picture is very close to DVD, except it's cut a little on top and bottom (as are all others TC's out there). Sound is decent, let's say 6/10."

Audio is a bit poor compared to how good the video is but after a little while you hardly notice it.
Good copy worth watching.
Thanks to the uploader."
