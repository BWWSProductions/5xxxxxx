,rdevil13,2010-08-10T04:49Z,"There are quite a few fake/misidentified tracks in this set. Glitter & Grease is not a ""new single"" and the demo has never leaked. This track is a fan-made mash of 30 second clip of the demo that exists and the live version from Gaga's Monster Ball tour. Silly Boy was not recorded by Lady Gaga & Rihanna. It's Eva Simmons. There are about a dozen tracks floating around the internet that are mistakenly attributed to Gaga. For list of fake tracks check the Gaga wiki,  Gagapedia.
And The New Album Sneak Previews are not from her 2011 album. Gaga has confirmed that she will not include on her forthcoming CD any of the demos that have leaked in the past year. "
