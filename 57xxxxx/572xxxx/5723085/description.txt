1992 After The Dance- Historic Collaborations    CD  Shanachie 99006 
 


This breathtaking album showcases a series of spellbinding and perfect dialogues between two masters of acoustic guitar. Although normally classified under "folk", the album is an extraordinary and seamless fusion of blues, jazz, celtic/British, bluegrass and baroque counterpoint. The music combines strong and catchy melodies, driving rhythms and strategically advanced composition. 
An extraordinarily intense driving energy pervades this album, and as the last few notes echo in your ears, you are left with the feeling of having been in the presence of pure, bright liquid light, emanating from a pitch-black background. The pieces are hauntingly beautiful, each track highly distinctive.

This album is a master course in dialogue and composition. I've listened to it an uncountable number of times, and I'm still learning from it. If my house caught on fire and I could rescue only one album, I would choose this one.
