,simple89,2010-07-30T17:57Z,anyone can confirm if this works?
,mamotz,2010-07-30T19:38Z,"only works for new campaigns, cannot load saved games."
,Yamcha67,2010-07-31T01:38Z,It doesn't work for me... =/ How the hell did you guys get it to work.. 
,Yamcha67,2010-07-31T14:43Z,I got it working.. I had to rip my bro's starcraft 2 DVD.. I couldn't get the StarCraft2 available for download online working.. It wouldn't do anything when attempting to install.. anyway if you can find a working .dmg or .iso this will work
,luc1992,2010-08-01T05:52Z,"so i have tried to apply the patch (by following the instructions mind you) and i cannot get it to work. First of all even though the version appears to be the base15405 the instructions call for, there is no battle.net-patch.mpq. i can only find a battle.net.mpq file in the battle.net folder. 
so i try to replace that one and when i launch the game it tells me some files are missing and apple gives me an error message about compatibility. 
i am running snow leopard on a core I5 macbook pro. 
if someone who got it to work could post up some more detailed instructions i would be very thankful.
Also i have downloaded the game from here, the one that appears at the top of the ""top 100"" mac game torrents.
thanks again.  "
,iSkepsis,2010-08-01T06:23Z,"I'm soooo confused. I am currently stuck at the main screen of the game. It says I have to register a battle.net account. That is obviously why this crack is here. Under the crack instructions, it says to replace the sc2.app at /StarCraft II/Versions/Base15405/. What does that mean?"
,Tam-Linn,2010-08-01T06:38Z,Same Problem as luc1992
,iSkepsis,2010-08-01T06:45Z,Ok so figured ou the replacing part. I proceeded to replace them without trouble. Then I click on the new sc2.app and nothing happens. What am I doing wrong? Please answer!!!!

that is the error message i get when i start up the game with the torrented patch"
,Sheepinatorx,2010-08-01T06:52Z,"@ luc1992:  If you let SC2 update all the way so that you can actually get into the main menu of the game, and then you quit and go back to the /Starcraft II/Battle.net menu, there is a file called Battle.net-patch.MPQ.  However, when you reopen SC2, it has to reupdate and (at least for me) it got to 70% and gave me an error message.  This is worth a shot though for you.  "
,Sheepinatorx,2010-08-01T06:57Z,"@iSkepsis:  I have the same error message, I tried replacing different parts of the StarCraft II Editor, using both TextEdit and Terminal, but to no avail.  I have a feeling that somewhere in the StarCraft II Editor there is a line of code that requires changing, but it eludes me."
,luc1992,2010-08-01T07:23Z,"i solved my problem, for the explenation you guys can check out the comments on the game download page on this site (it is at the top of the top 100 mac games ATM)
good luck! 
i got everything to work except the saving part like everyone else .. ."
,b3rx,2010-08-01T17:22Z,"@luc1992: I was able to get to the 3rd mission. Here are my steps.

1. Saved from mission 3.
2. Quit the game.
3. Start SC2.
4. Start Campaign.
5. Go to menu and click on load."
,PraiseTheLard,2010-08-03T00:04Z,"Install the game, let the installer connect to the internet, skip registration. Update the game and check after for battle.net-patch.mpq. When its there, replace that and the SC.app in the Versions folder. It works for me but its not a 100% crack. You'll need to start a new campaign everytime you want to load your game."
,PraiseTheLard,2010-08-04T03:41Z,"Actually, starting the tutorial is an easier way of loading your game. I just installed a copy on my friends laptop (windows) and I swear from the Razor1911 crack theres gotta be a newer one coming for Mac."
