Many people still have equipment that is not flexible enough to allow them to blindly download with any confidence of being able to actually USE what they grab."

download and install ""Daemon Tools Lite"" http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads

""mount"" (load) the iso file, and it will auto-play in windows media player. Region doesnt matter, nor should operating system. (Using win7 + wmp)"
