Alternate version of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, consisting of the three original shorts which comprised that film.  The fourth short is also included.  Combined DVD/LD source.  The original three shorts are encoded to the lowest common denominator so the bitrate is not high; they are not remastered so the video is rather noisy.  (imdb tags not included as there is no way to include 4 of them.)
