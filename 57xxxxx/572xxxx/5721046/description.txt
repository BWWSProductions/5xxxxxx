I could never find a Sims 2 Torrent that had all working expansion packs and stuff packs so i pulled the best peices from different torrents and made the pefect Sims 2 torrent. It even comes with the full version of MagicISO 5.5 to "mount" the .iso files.

I read the comments and most people don't know how to mount an image well i'm here to tell you how.

Instructions:

MagicISO: (Important! Install this before you do anything! (Unless of course you already have it installed.)

(You will need WinRAR to open)

Step 1:
Go to whereever your "Sims 2 with all EPs + Stuff.rar" is, in my case it's in my Downloads folder.

Step 2:
UnZip the files from the Archive into your downloads folder.

Step 3:
Once MagicISO 5.5 is installed you can do one of two things:

Step 3.5:
Go to your UnZipped "The Sims 2 with all EPs + Stuff" folder and go to the "Sims 2" folder and right-click the "...disk 1.iso" file. put your mouse over the "MagicISO" option and choose the first sub-action which is "Mount The Sims 2 - Disk 1.iso" It should ask you if you want to create a virtual drive, select yes.
But for it to actually mount you have to open "MagicISO", Click on "Tools" then click the third sub action "Virtual CD/DVD-ROM" then click (The Drive may vary from computer to computer.) "E: No Media" and search for the "The Sims2 - Disk 1.iso" (If you are to lazy to (Step 4: Go to "My Computer" and run the Vitual drive like you would the CD/DVD drive.) Then just simply remount the "The Sims2 - Disk 1.iso" and that should do the trick. 

To Remount:
(Click on "Tools" then click the third sub action "Virtual CD/DVD-ROM" then click (The Drive may vary from computer to computer.) "E: No Media" and search for the "The Sims2 - Disk 1.iso"

Final Step:
Repeat steps 3.5 and 4 untill they all are installed. 

*NOTE*
The "Bon Voyage", "Free Time", "Apartment Life" and all the Sims 2 Stuff packs were originally seperate Packs I added to the torrent, 

*Edit*
In my Point of view, The Sims 2: Nightlife has the best loading music to listen to while waiting so If you want to listen that then Install "Nightlife" last and go [url=http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4090563/Sims_2_NightLife_Cd-Key_Crack._By_Toppel]here[/url] but instead of downloading the torrent, uncheck all files except TSBin. Download that then replace it with the one in your "The Sims 2: Nightlife folder. Create a shortcut and boom you're done!

If you are too lazy, then proceed to the final note.

*INSTALL "SIMS 2: SEASONS" LAST!!!*

Read the "Instructions.txt" File for all the information.
To Install "The Sims 2 Apartment Life-RELOADED you'll need an .nfo file viewer.
You can download a really good one here.
