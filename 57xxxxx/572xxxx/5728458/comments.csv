,SaGgYmcGRILL,2010-07-31T19:52Z,CAN SOME1 PLS TELL ME HOW U REPAIR THE BLOCKS?
,bordaddy,2010-07-31T21:24Z,i have downloaded this new fix cuz the last one i downloaded i was missing one block so i opened all the par2 files and and all the blocks are here and when i opened these par2 files it created other files i copied and paste in the original starcraft digital download folder and its still doing the same thing it did before. i just dont know how to use quick par. is there any way someone can do a step by step and maybe clarify what i should be doing with this quick par and where i should put the files it creates. thanks
,bordaddy,2010-07-31T21:40Z,so i downloaded the other patches you uploaded and i was missing one block so i downloaded this one and i think i just dont know really how to use quick par but i opened all of the par2 files and no blocks are missing. i copied the files that quickpar created into the Starcraft 2 digital download folder and tried to install it and still same thing. could someone do a step by step of what i should do and where i should put all the files from quickpar. thanks

1) First download installer fix here

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5725541/Starcraft_2_Digital_download-WW_installer_fix__2

2) Then once you've downloaded that put the par files in the root directory (the one with the file ""installer tome.mpqe"")

3) Quickpar will tell you if you are missing any MPQE files, there should be three, installer tome and to other installer files Installer UI 1.MPQ and installer UI 2.MPQE

Make sure your those other two files are not corrupt.

4) unzip the rar file SC-WW installer fix.rar into the  root directory where the Installer tome file is

5) there should be a directory off the root called installer.app

6) Installer.exe should be in the same directory as the MPQE files

7) Run the installer

,5demonz,2010-08-03T16:47Z,There can be no trojan they are par files you dumbass not executables.
,bordaddy,2010-08-04T22:53Z,no trojan for me. only thing i wish this game had was skrimish against the AI. guess you can only play campaign and Challenges :(
