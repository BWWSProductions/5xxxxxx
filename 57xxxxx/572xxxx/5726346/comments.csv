Ugh, yes even in the 80's their was a few cuss words (just an an fyi though). Peter Cullen is a F'in savior! Not only did he do Transformer movies then, he did ones now (included the video game) and now doing brand new TV series coming out this year called; Transformers: Prime"". Sorry, got carried away cause he's like a god.............

,DropKilla,2010-07-31T07:33Z,"@Alia: What do you consider a ""DVD"" here?"
[V],Alia_Erenel,2010-08-09T17:07Z,"A DVD is a full DVD rip. When it's the main movie only, it's simply goes to Movies."
