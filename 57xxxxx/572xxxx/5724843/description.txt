Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.

On with the update release information:

Aliens Vs Predator Update 4 to 6
================================

Update 6
========

New Features:

- Predator Focus Attack now knocks you down between 9-12m

- Alien Focus Attack damage has been returned to it's correct
values

- The chance to spawn on occupied/blocked friendly spawn
points and consequentially knock players out of world is
reduced

- Joining a Dedicated server which is running on non-standard
ports, leaving and then hosting a player match, will now no
longer cause any clients who join the hosted match to lose
connection upon starting the game

Update 5
========

New Features:

- Enabled XP gain, leaderboard updates and associated
achievements and skin unlocks for non-ranked games as well
as Ranked Matches. Now the differences between ranked and
unranked games is that in Ranked Matches, skill-based
matchmaking, team balancing and other Ranked Match
associated rules are enforced and in Player matches they are
not. You are now unable to have a game that does not update
the leaderboards, or award XP.

- Major overhaul of low-level networking code for
player-hosted (i.e. not Dedicated Server) games in order to
improve connection stability and pings.

Bug Fixes:

- Prevented runaway memory consumption under D3D11 if an FMV
is playing when you lock (ctrl-alt-del - "lock computer")
your machine with an NVIDIA card.

- Several "groups" issues have been fixed, including a
reported issue with Group leaders causing group members to
disconnect from Games if they leave and then join another
Server.

- The spawning system has been tweaked, so that players will
have a reduced chance of spawning very close to other
(enemy) players.

- Server start up crash which occurred on Win 7 32bit Home
Premium has been fixed.

- Several Server stability (crash) issues have been fixed

Balance Changes:

- Flamethrower primary fire now ignites target if 25% of
health has been depleted. Flames will now continue to burn
until target is dead, or target extinguishes flames. Base
damage is unchanged.

- Alien leap attack now causes the knockdown flinch on all
targets from the "long distance" range. Damage is unchanged.

- Alien tail attack now causes the light attack flinch, which
does not "root" the target. Damage is unchanged.

- You are now not able to jump and start a melee move in the
air/until the jump has completed, or initiate a melee move
and then jump until the melee animation has finished.
Affects all species.

- Stealth attack has had some tweaks to reduce the potential
for an initiation to occur from outside the allowed "angle"
and range has been reduced from 8m to 6m

- The Predator flinch ranges have been equalised with the
Aliens, and as a result can now be knocked down by a counter
(from any species), or an Alien leap attack that
successfully lands.

- Knockdown leap distance is now between 9-12m instead of
6-12m. Affects Aliens and Predators.

- Predator maximum leap distance is now capped at 12m (in line
with Alien) and is not modified by vision mode.

- The Marine block will now only block 50% of an incoming
light attack damage value instead of 100%.

Update 4
========

Client:

- Fix for a Skybox rendering problem in D3D11 build on Nvidia
Fermi cards

- Various small D3D11 optimisations

- Fixed rare bug where clients would get stuck on the loading
screen.

- Fix clients not seeing the 'custom match' flag updating in
the 'Browse' screen when the dedicated server was changing
settings after initially hosting a match without changing
any variables

- Use an R prefix for rcon command output text upon
successful receipt of a rcon command

- Prevent windows cursor being stolen when starting in
windowed mode but then doing ALT-TAB immediately.

- Show (and sort) dedicated server search results as they come
in instead of waiting for search to complete before
displaying anything.

- Fix extraneous Team appended to MOTD text when joining
game in progress

- Invitations to dedicated server games now work.

- Fixed all dedicated server games showing as "at lobby" in
the server browser, regardless of being at lobby or in
progress.

Dedicated server:

- Fixed "Ghost players" being created on a server if the Steam
backend could not be reached for authentication when someone
connected. These appeared in the player counts when browsing
servers, and in the server details player list when viewing
servers in the Steam client server list.

- Added more info to server console when players
connect/disconnect, and print out the player list in the
command window (including scoreboard) at the end of each
game.

- Use an R prefix for rcon commands and echo command output
to server console as well as sending it to rcon client.

- Enabled logfiles (writes out console output and some command
line errors only to files in logfilesdedicatedserver). You
can still override the logfile directory by specifying
-logdir on the command line and if you do so any logfiles
from a previous session will be archived in a directory
called logfilebackups.

- Small performance optimisations

- Dedicated server species ratios' commands check for unset
values and report the default values instead of the invalid
value (-1). The dedicated server was correctly setup in this
case, but the command feedback text was inaccurate

2. Run Aliens.Vs.Predator.Update.4.to.6.exe and install
3. Copy the cracked content from SKIDROW directory to your
