,micnor14,2011-12-29T05:05Z,"Confirmed additional bugs/meddling 

Most map files have been modified with level_starts spawn adjusted BELOW the map! Cheeky bastard!  Someone find a way to select which files are updated (like only core-files, not the maps) so i can play in DX11 mode with a gaddamned skybox! If I get around to it, I'll comment a temporary fix, then maybe even a modified installer. Maybe. 

ChronicDCJ is one MAD BRO?!"
