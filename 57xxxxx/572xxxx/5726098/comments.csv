,retardoface,2010-07-30T07:21Z,"ya ive been using dbpoweramp, wat do you mean highlight them, i recorded this vinyl at 96/24 but my soundcard does not have windows 7 driver so its probably just 44.1/16 and i know its 44.1 but i need to find out if its 24 or 16 bit.



Btw do you suppose someone by the name of retardoface will receive a trusted symbol next to the name hehe "
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-30T07:38Z,"by highlight them i mean click on it, leave your pointer there for a second, and a box should pop up with all the info.

you can request a purple skull on the superbay forums, but i wouldn't do it till you've got at leased a page and a half. the mods can be a little unforgiving if you jump the gun..."
