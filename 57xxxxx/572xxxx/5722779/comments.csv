,gfw4lyfe,2011-01-17T09:19Z,"You're going to upload a ""720"" rip and not even use 5.1 audio? FAIL. I'll move on."
,mikecj,2011-01-26T14:13Z,"beware! i don't know what you lot are watching this guys uploads on?! I am watching off of a LaCinema Classic HD, through HDMI to a 37"" Sony TV. With these i am getting poor quality! Pixelated blacks and over-sharpened edges. I will stick to the 1GB+ file sizes, until someone can actually deliver on this kind of promise! Nice try, thanks for sharing, it's close but it's not quite there yet. If only you didn't over-sharpen and lower the export size so much!
let the onslaught commence!"
