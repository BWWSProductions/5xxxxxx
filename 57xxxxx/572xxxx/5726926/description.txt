An American art appraiser, Patrick Donovan, is sent to Venice to evaluate three paintings 
belonging to the famous Galleria dell'Accademia. The company that insures the paintings 
has hired Donovan's employer, the International Center for Art Authentication, to verify 
that two Bellini canvases as well as the crown jewel of the museum's collection - 
Giorgione's 'La Tempesta' - are originals. Donovan contacts Allart van Beuningen, the 
director of the Accademia Museum, examines the two Bellinis and confirms that they are 
authentic. But before he can check 'La Tempesta', with floodwaters rising and the Galleria
closed to the public, the painting is stolen by assailants who attack Donovan and Van 
Beuningen's beautiful adopted daughter, Chiara, a professional art restorer who works at 
the Museum. When the painting gets stolen, Donovan has to turn into a detective in order 
to try to track down the thief and recover the canvas.
