,choobaloob,2010-07-30T12:47Z,"Why do all the 14.3 mb blank files make up this movie? I have never downloaded a movie comprised of files like this, think I can smell bullshit? I shouldn't expect any less from a Makam though...."

I've seen MANY movies packed in this format, it's not uncommon, although people would like to see a noRAR. However, it doesn't mean it smells of bull shit. After all, I can take a porn AVI and rename it to ""Jonah.Hex.2010.DvDScr.avi"" and it would actually be bull shit... It's not in the packing. Trust the uploader / comments. ;)"

Stop taking drugs! "
,cyber_d9,2010-07-31T14:31Z,so how do we repack to one video file?
