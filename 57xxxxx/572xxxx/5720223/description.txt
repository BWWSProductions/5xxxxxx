Great music here, performed absolutely flawlessly: an exuberant English polyphonic Latin mass setting of the late pre-reformation period (contemporary with Taverner), interspersed with liturgical chant.

I'm going to quote part of an Amazon review here, as it sums up this great CD:

"It is superb. [...] Other choral groups I am familiar with such as The Tallis Scholars, and the Sixteen, use female singers for the treble line. Here on this CD boys are used. They sing with remarkable clarity, and sweetness of tone the recording is wonderfully atmospheric.[...] All in all it is a stunning Cd."
