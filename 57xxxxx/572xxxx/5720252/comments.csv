what about the art book? any chance of uploading it"
,Arkinats,2010-07-28T16:38Z,"I've thought about scanning the art book. But the book is hardback, and the pictures go right to the spine so scanning it while still bound would result in pictures missing about an inch where the spine runs. Also, its like 500 scans so would be a pretty time consuming process... maybe next week when i've finished part of the campaign."
