,tannhausser,2010-07-31T17:25Z,"@Delusional_Fate: If you are so fucking grateful go to the church, and make it a catholic one, so you can be fucked in the ass to increase your gratefulness."
,repsolfireblade05,2010-07-31T17:44Z,Instead of hanging shit on each other .Why not comment on A/V quality you fucken morons..cheers ray
,nohajc,2010-07-31T17:51Z,"It's not an ordinary CAM. Yeah, video is still the same (probably from IMAGiNE judging by the resolution) but since it's marked as TELESYNC, audio should be better. I personally welcome any improvement. The cam sound was just horrible, maybe now I could actually watch the whole thing."
,imbackagain0101,2010-07-31T19:37Z,many tnx

,Rzi,2010-08-01T00:32Z,Don't complain it's free and personally i will wait for a proper rip for a movie as good as this. I would like to see this in a theatre though.

,Amaximus,2010-08-01T03:22Z,"Wait for a good rip, this will just ruin it for you. Vidcaps look horrible"
,jamde5201,2010-08-01T05:37Z,"Dont even know why theres a ""TS"" in the title..

Please replace that with CAM so people understand what they're downloading."
,Lekoaf,2010-08-02T14:39Z,"After just watching the sample:
A: 8 / V: 5
Quite good for a cam."
,sexto57,2010-08-03T04:47Z,"I hate all these idiots who get a stick up their ass whenever someone asks about v/a quality or says the release is shit. I'm getting tired of the whole ""it's free, so don't complain"" bullshit. If the release is shit, then it's shit. Don't expect me to say it's amazing, if it's shit. Sure, it's free, but so is dog shit on the street and I'm not gonna eat THAT either and say it's apple pie.

I mean, if YOU have the right to make me waste 700MB-1.4GB of my bandwidth, then I sure as hell have the right to call your dog turd what it is: SHIT>"

horrible video quality, don't download this. wait for a dvdrip"
,LunarBear,2010-08-08T10:15Z,the quality of the video was crap. but it's still better than nothing. cheers ray.
,LunarBear,2010-08-08T10:20Z,"@sexto57:
Personally I reckon your allowed to say its shit for the benefit of everyone. But still its your own fault that your bandwidth got wasted. A sample is included, so you should have looked at that first."
