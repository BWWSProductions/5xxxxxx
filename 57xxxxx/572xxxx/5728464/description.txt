PrisM NOTES:
Right...very late releasing this since we got audio tuesday, been a little busy, but tweaked all the colours, didn't wanna lower saturation to much because would make other scenes look poor.
changed the RGB Colours, shadow colours, and some other bits.
Added a sharpness script.
Video had small black bars changing on different scenes, due to cropping on the video originally, i left these intact so you didn't lose any video :)
There's the few seconds at the start still missing, but it is nothing really whats missed.
Was going to use other cam source but they are very poor...
Audio is pretty sweet.

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
