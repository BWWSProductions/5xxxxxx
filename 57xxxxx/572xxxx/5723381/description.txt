Here is the 2005 IFC Greg the bunny movie parodies, the best of anyway cant find the full thing.

as per wikipedia...


In August 2005, Greg the Bunny returned to the IFC, in a series of short segments, both old and new spoofing movies such as Annie Hall, Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink, Fargo, Blue Velvet, Easy Rider and Pulp Fiction. The cast for these segments primarily features puppets Greg and Warren Demontague, with appearances from Count Blah, new character Pal Friendlies, and returning character The Wumpus. Tardy the Turtle and Susan were unable to appear in the IFC series because they were the property of FOX.
