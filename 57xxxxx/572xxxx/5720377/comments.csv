A = Fine

M = Too clichéd and flat for my taste. Gets a bit corny and boring after a while. "
,darkblademk,2010-09-14T07:18Z,"Good actors, but the story is one of the WORST ive ever seen, total bullshit, not worth watching definitly! 2/10"

,tonym2112,2010-09-18T15:32Z,"First off...Thank you extremezone! you can always be counted on for great quality ups!
Now, I have never posted anything but thank you's but I have to say: what makes some of you douchebags think we want your opinion of a film?
Most of you sound (and type) like you are 15 years old. I don't give two shits about what you think of a movie's script or an actor's ability. Shut the fuck up, download the torrent, thank the uploader and MOVE ON!
Sorry for the rant extremezone"

,sweetcandy,2011-03-04T17:06Z,Movie is such a mess! Starts like a good story and then ends up galloping towards a complete disaster. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! Not worth the time.
