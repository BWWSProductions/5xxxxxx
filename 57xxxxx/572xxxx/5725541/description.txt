INSTALL FIX FOR

StarCraft 2 Wings Of Liberty Digital Download-WW  #2
-------------------------------------------------

I've created an install fix for everyone who can't get the digital
download release to install.

Here's the fix, note I've included par files to check to see if your 
files are corrupted.  the PAR2 files check your MPQ's to make sure they
dl'd ok and the installer is in the RAR file, you merely need to unrar
the installer in the root where the MPQ files are


1) extract the files to root MPQ directory
2) Ensure that the installer.app directory exists and that you unrar'd
it correctly
3) Install quickpar
4) Open the par2 files to check to see if your MPQ files are ok
5) Install should work if everything checks out


MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE FILES TO SEE IF THEY ARE CORRUPT, the installer works %100 I've tested
it on 2 seperate machines, if it doesn't work for you some of your files are corrupt.

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CRACK

To get crack working once installed

Run the game a few times WITHOUT the crack, get all the updates, then copy over the crack.
