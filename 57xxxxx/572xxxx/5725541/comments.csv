1 files is damaged,
installer tome 1, WHAT DO I DOO to fix this?"
,5demonz,2010-07-30T02:52Z,Did par2 say you needed blocks? how many?
,seekthetablet,2010-07-30T04:24Z,""" The file ""fileset.base\Mods\Core.SC2Mod\Index.SC2Locale"" in archive """" could not be opened, because an error 2 occurred. If this problem persists, please contact Blizzard Technical Support. (MPQFile::OpenFromArchive)""

I did the par2 check, said I was missing one block from ""Installer Tome1.MPQE"". I cut it to another folder and downloading the main torrent again; it checked ""Installer Tome1.MPQE"" and it came up at 98.5% done and downloaded some more, and another 5MBs as a separate file (ruh roh)...I put the ""Installer Tome1.MPQE"" back into the main folder after it said it was 100% downloaded...and still wown't work and par2 check says 1 block is still missing."
,bwcprettyboy,2010-07-30T07:51Z,"@ 5demonz this was better, however just as seekthetablet said one (1) block is missing from ""Installer Tome1.MPQE"" so if you don't mind can you post a few blocks so we can repair this file and get this show on the road, lol. thanks "
,SpiderGod,2010-07-30T21:54Z,It says I am missing 4 blocks... so what do I do? 
,OUTLAWXXXX,2010-07-31T00:36Z,"what is an MPQ? how do I use quickpar and open par2 files? none of this is making any sense, I have the same errors..."
,OUTLAWXXXX,2010-07-31T00:40Z,"none of this is making any sense to me? what is an MPQ directory? I have no starcraft directory because it won't install to begin w/ I unziped the first fix and replaced the installer and Installer.app w/ the one that came in the .rar. 

don't know how to use quickpar at all though"
,5demonz,2010-07-31T07:18Z,"If you're only missing a couple blocks go here - 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5728458/StarCraft_2_Wings_Of_Liberty_Digital_Download-WW_corruption_fix_

If you are missing too many blocks you need to redownload / re-check the the files against a torrent who's files are not corrupted."
,SIIIIICK,2010-07-31T10:39Z,"Use the link that 5demonz put up, Fixed mine so I could install it!!!!

and I downloaded the damepc digital download one, so it worked for that one!!!!!!"
,mr.fluffy,2010-08-11T21:23Z,"For those having trouble with this
- Extract the lty-sc2ret.iso with winrar or some other similar software. 
- Unrar the content in ""SC2-WW fixed Installer.rar"" from this torrent and replace the originals in the folder where you ectracted lty-sc2ret.iso"
,mr.fluffy,2010-08-11T21:27Z,don't forget to copy the crack once installation finishes
,robiris,2010-09-12T15:34Z,"At mine it says:

That file : Installer UI 2.MPQE is the problem..
It could'nt open it, and then the installer exits..

Any Help?"
