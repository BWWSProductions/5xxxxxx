,seederGR,2010-08-16T10:28Z,why do you swedish people always hardcode the subtitles? i really dont get that.
,AtotehZ,2010-09-01T22:59Z,"Hear, hear. People can hardsub themselves if they want to. Would be better if you linked to a guide of how to do it and put the srt file as a separate file at the side."
