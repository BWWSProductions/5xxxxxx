The complete first season of Sanford and Son. 

These files use the M4V extension, MP4 container, and H.264 (AVC) encoding. If you have any problem playing the files, the simplest solution would be to download the VLC media player, which can play damn near anything.

Please seed if you want me to upload more seasons, otherwise I won't bother.
