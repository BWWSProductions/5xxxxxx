,krisha,2010-07-29T12:24Z,still get the error
,bwcprettyboy,2010-07-29T12:55Z,"First of all the so called ""par"" files weren't included and second what the hell are you talking about? 

Can you break this down for some of us that are fresh off the boat and have no Idea what you're talking about when you say ""extract the files (what files) to root MPQ directory"" what exactly does this mean? 

I've been trying to interpret your instructions for a few hours now and still can't get anywhere with this. I don't know if my files are corrupt because the ""par"" files aren't here so you may want to check this again and re-upload. Thanks for your time"
