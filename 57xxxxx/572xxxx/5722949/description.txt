INSTALL FIX FOR

StarCraft 2 Wings Of Liberty Digital Download-WW
-------------------------------------

I've created an install fix for everyone who can't get the digital
download release to install.

Here's the fix, note I've included par files to check to see if your 
files are corrupted.  the PAR2 files check your MPQ's to make sure they
dl'd ok and the installer is in the zip file, you merely need to unrar
the installer in the root where the MPQ files are


1) extract the files to root MPQ directory
2) Ensure that the installer.app directory exists and that you unrar'd
it correctly
3) Install quickpar
4) Open the par2 files to check to see if your MPQ files are ok
