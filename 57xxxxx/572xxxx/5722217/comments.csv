Dumbass

[T],megadethmen,2010-07-28T19:24Z,"As i know the ""Reloaded"" crack works only with the ""Reloaded"" version (of the game). This works with other version too ... so i dont know."
,Svaargod,2010-08-04T16:38Z,"Let the game update ,after that simply put the crack and other files in the right place.Works like a charm!"
,Valtrex666,2010-08-12T07:12Z,"Game Crack Works Great!
Just Install the game from disk or another source, let the game install and restart computer. Then let the game UPDATE ""which takes a few minutes."" Then launch and exit game. Open crack and replace existing files in the ""Game Directory"" with the replacement files. Be sure to open each folder and copy the hacked files across and not just the entire folder or needed files already in the installed directory will be deleted. (Simply copy and replace the exact files in the Main installed directory with the exact files in the Crack folder. 
Your Installed directory should be something like
D:program files/StarCraft II"
