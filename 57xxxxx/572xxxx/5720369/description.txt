Release Notes:

Life Of Agony, a name not easily forgotten. There was always something unique
and interesting about this band that has kept fans enthralled for over two
decades. Whether it was the intensity of their live performances or the haunting
melodies & lyrical content, this group radiated a passion and emotion that
struck a chord in the hearts of misunderstood youth all over the world. Perhaps,
it was the underlying message of strength, hidden within the group's tales of
despair that made such an impact on people. For most listeners, understanding
that the songs came from a genuine place, based on actual experiences made the
message really hit home, that they were not alone.
New York's crossover legends Life Of Agony spawned in the Summer of 1989,
tearing through the underground scene with an undeterred aggression, obtaining a
loyal and devoted cult audience in the process. The outfit caught Roadrunner
