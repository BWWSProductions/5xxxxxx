,dislexic,2010-12-10T23:46Z,"Downloaded past halfway....most of the episodes aren't to bad...it's not in wide screen...they seem to all be in normal tv format...4:3 or whatever.

I've only found one episode that's a hectic fuzzy...but the rest...meh. not the worst in the world...but not exactly 1080p. I'd say it's worth it.

Thanks for the up man!"
