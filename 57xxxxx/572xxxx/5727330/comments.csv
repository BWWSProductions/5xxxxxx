You're the ''THIEF'', since you're here @ TPB, rather a pirate! xD"
,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-08-20T20:46Z,"movies are fine but they are all rar files ..itll take an hour or 2 to unrar them all and put onto disks arrgghhh please no more damn rar files

if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !"
,Snapperhead1,2010-10-10T00:52Z,"THANK YOU @zeitgeistmandvdrip 

You go to all the trouble of collecting these movies, and you leave them in RAR format???  What a moron.  And on top of that, half the movies are in 2 CD format.  The days of expensive blank DVDs are gone.  Now I know why the seed count of this torrent is so low........."

,tyler45241,2011-02-01T05:08Z,Nice Up! I'd hate to have to find and DL these all one by one. Thx.
,Dramat,2011-06-03T11:35Z,"Thanks Johnny!
Gr8 collection. I was surprised though to see in it Terminator Salvation. I was convinced that it was a computer simulation..."

,narcarsiss,2011-08-23T04:27Z,Now howabout the 720P version

,michaelrwatson,2012-04-08T11:17Z,"2129 files?!? I never liked RAR files, and now i'm sure i don't like them. Thanks but no thanx. Much easier to find the particular rips you want and just download em."
