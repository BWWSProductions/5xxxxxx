Women of the Holy Kingdom
2006 Running Time 50 mins- Discovery Times Channel
Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, Maiken Baird

In Saudi Arabia, women need permission from their male guardians to study, work and travel. They are also forbidden to drive and to mix with men in public. Now, a growing number of Saudi women are challenging these traditions and are clamoring for more rights, filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid documents the emerging women's movement. Obaid also interviews religious clerics and young working mothers who denounce change and label the women's movement as immoral.
