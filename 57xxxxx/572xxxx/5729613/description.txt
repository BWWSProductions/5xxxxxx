DESCRIPTION
=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a half-hour live-action/animated
series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions on NBC primetime in 1968, based
on the famous Mark Twain characters.


PLOT
=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Huckleberry Finn (Michael Shea), Becky Thatcher (Lu Ann Haslam) & Tom Sawyer
(Kevin Schulz) were constantly on the run from Injun Joe (Ted Cassidy), who
sought revenge on them for testifying against him in court, Tom & Huck having
witnessed Joe's murder of Dr. Robinson. The episodes which ensued thrust them
into various make-believe fantasy worlds; their surroundings were animated,
while Huck, Becky and Tom themselves remained live-action.

The series itself aired from September 15, 1968 to September 7, 1969 for 20
episodes, airing Sunday evenings on NBC-TV at 7:00pm/6:00pm Central. It was
later syndicated as part of The Banana Splits and Friends series.

On cable, repeats of this show (without the original opening sequences) aired
on Cartoon Network and its sister channel Boomerang.

In December 1968, Gold Key Comics published a one-issue New Adventures Of
Huck Finn comic book, based on the episode "The Curse Of Thut" (which aired
around the same time).
