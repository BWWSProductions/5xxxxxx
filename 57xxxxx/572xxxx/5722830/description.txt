NOTE: Glad to see ya back around KB. Cant wait for ya to get back in action. :D Continuing the legacy of great quality, KiNGDOM releases... ;) The source had Hardcoded Swedish Subs throughout, I would of blurred it but decided to crop the subs as they were hard on the eyes. Its still better than whats out IMO. FIXED THE SYNC ISSUE, TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. ;)
