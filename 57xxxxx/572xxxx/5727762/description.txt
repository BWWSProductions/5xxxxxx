Psychic medium Dr. Christian von Lahr discussed the history of Atlantis and how it ties in with 2012 prophecies, and coming climate and Earth changes. He posited that the lost continent of Atlantis was actually Pangea, the supercontinent that existed millions of years ago, and that was how the Atlantean culture easily spread because the land mass was interconnected. We don't see the direct remains of Atlantis because its main sections were sunk under land masses, through the splitting of the tectonic plates, he explained. Parts of Atlantis are located under the Andes Mountains in South America, and the Himalayas in Tibet, he continued. 

2012 is a highly important juncture, marking the "midpoint" of human existence, and according to ancient texts "when we reach this point it means that all the major lessons that were necessary for man to serve his purpose will have been learned," said von Lahr, who noted this would be a time for spiritual progression. The Atlanteans reached such a midpoint, shifting from androgynous type-beings to male and female, so that they could further evolve, he detailed. 

Physical Earth changes will increasingly occur as we approach 2012, von Lahr declared-- he reiterated his earlier prediction (from the 1/1/10 show) that in August 2010, a volcanic eruption will trigger other volcanoes to erupt in the Ring of Fire region of the Pacific Ocean. "Major cosmic activity on the sun will affect us," gamma waves coming from the center of galaxy will be hitting us around Dec. 21, 2012, and we could also see changes in the Earth's magnetic core, he warned. One defensive strategy to lessen the effect of the gamma rays would be to put gold in the atmosphere, he proposed. 

Oil Spill Update
First hour guest, ecological biologist David Blume talked about how bacteria can eat up some of the oil from the Gulf spill. However, the bacteria is taking up a lot of the water's oxygen which leads to a die-off of ocean life. He also noted that the dispersants used on the oil just make it look like it's gone, but it's still there on the surface.
