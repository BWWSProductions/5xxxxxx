Neighbors From HÐµll centers on the Hellmans, a typical, all-American suburban family, with Balthazor; his wife, Tina; their two children, Mandy and Josh; and their dog Pazuzu. They're your average family who happen to hail from Hell. They have been sent to Earth to pose as normal suburbanites with a mission to keep humans from drilling their way to Hell. Their task is made all the more complicated by Balthazor's growing affection for humans and their odd but endearing qualities. But, as long as they follow Satan's acronym "Snorfindesdrillsalgoho" (Seem Normal, Fit In, Destory Drill, Save Hell, Go Home), the the Hellmans have nothing to worry about.
