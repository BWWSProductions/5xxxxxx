             Caribbean islands; islands full of secrets, mystery and     
             the spirit of romance. These islands are both beautiful     
             and lethally dangerous. Centuries ago the waters of this    
             region were teeming with pirates and adventurers... and     
             frankly, not much has changed since then.                   
             Many books have been written about the Caribbean basin      
             and many films have depicted it.                            
             Now you have a unique chance to visit these places          
             yourself and personally witness the everyday life of        
             drug-dealers, bandits and the Mafioso. You'll be able to    
             take part in various mysterious events and get involved     
             in fights between various hostile forces, or just admire    
             the luscious tropical environment while drinking the        
             traditional pirate's liquor - rum. The Caribs are           
             waiting for you!                                            
                                                                         
                                                                         
             Features:                                                   
                                                                         
              - White Gold: War in Paradise is the new project from      
                game developers Deep Shadows. White Gold is the          
                spiritual sequel to 2005's popular game Boiling Point:   
                Road to Hell                                             
              - The main hero arrives on the islands in order to         
                investigate a series of mysterious events, but he        
                instantly ends up in troubles that only you can help     
                him with                                                 
              - White Gold: War in Paradise is not a direct              
                continuation of the Boiling Point: Road to Hell          
                storyline, but a successor in atmosphere and gameplay    
                mechanics. A superb mix of RPG elements and FPS combat,  
                vast open areas, hostile groups and factions, diverse    
                vehicles and weapons, and a story full of sudden turns   
                and surprises awaits you                                 
              - The project is being developed on Vital Engine 3, the    
                new in-house engine created by Deep Shadows, which       
                includes all modern technical features, such as Shader   
                Model 3.0 and various post processing effects including  
                HDR (High Dynamic Range), motion blur and a host of      
                others. In comparison to Vital Engine 2, the physics     
                system for vehicles has also been greatly improved.      
                Moreover, some of the new engine's strengths are         
                destructible objects, which will be taken advantage of   
                everywhere in the game, and the support for a huge,      
                unified playing area                                     
              - The character development system has also been heavily   
                altered to become more interesting and flexible. One of  
                our major innovations is a system of perks that affects  
                the game experience a lot and greatly extends the        
                variety in which it is possible to improve your          
                character
