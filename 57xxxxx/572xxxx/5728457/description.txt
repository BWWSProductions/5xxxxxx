Another Country is a studio album by singer-songwriter Tift Merritt. It was recorded in the summer of 2007, produced in L.A. by George Drakoulias, and released on February 26, 2008 by Fantasy Records.

For her third album, Tift Merritt took hiatus with a piano in Paris and came home with her most personal and powerful songs to date. Merritt has described the writing as a plainspoken look at the distance we all attempt to cross: between two people, between one heart and the rest of the world.

In its first week of release, the album's first single "Broken" reached #1 on the Americana Radio Chart compiled by the Americana Music Association.

Tift Merritt (born January 8, 1975) is an American singer-songwriter. She has released two studio albums for Lost Highway Records and one for Fantasy Records.

Her live albums so far are Home Is Loud released in 2005 and Buckingham Solo released in 2009.
