Nice setup you have there, youssef, btw! Talking of GPU applications, I hear it can be quite complicated to program so many 'cores' to work together without conflict, especially if several cores are working on the same task. Still, here's hoping...

Oh, and I wouldn't worry about upscaling too much - at best, it's a good guess, and at worst, it can add artifacts. The resolution is not really there, after all. 
And don't be too hard on the old mp3 - 320kbps is still good quality, and it can be played anywhere!;)

Thanks again

All the best!"
