This is the brand new sequel to A Very Potter Musical, an unofficial musical stage adaptation written and produced by students at the University of Michigan. Released on July 22, 2010. 

I have ripped the video files and encoded to 2 DVD-5 disc images. The play itself is over 3.5 hours long in two acts. Act I is on the first disc and Act II on the second. I've added a simple title menu as well. The DVDs were mastered from the 480p video files ripped using a firefox extension. I had trouble getting the audio to stay in sync with the HD videos for some reason. I have tested playback of the image in VLC, and burned discs in both my cheap Insignia DVD player and a PS2. Burn at a low speed to avoid errors. 

Anyway, I created the A Very Potter Musical DVD also available here on Pirate Bay, and thought I'd do the same for the sequel. It's really funny and has more great music.
