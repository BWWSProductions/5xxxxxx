More and more Web sites are being rewritten as Ajax applications; even traditional desktop software is rapidly moving to the Web via Ajax. But, all too often, this transition is being made with reckless disregard for security. If Ajax applications arenâ€™t designed and coded properly, they can be susceptible to far more dangerous security vulnerabilities than conventional Web or desktop software. Ajax developers desperately need guidance on securing their applications: knowledge thatâ€™s been virtually impossible to find, until now.
Ajax Security systematically debunks todayâ€™s most dangerous myths about Ajax security, illustrating key points with detailed case studies of actual exploited Ajax vulnerabilities, ranging from MySpaceâ€™s Samy worm to MacWorldâ€™s conference code validator. Even more important, it delivers specific, up-to-the-minute recommendations for securing Ajax applications in each major Web programming language and environment, including .NET, Java, PHP, and even Ruby on Rails. Youâ€™ll learn how to:

Â· Mitigate unique risks associated with Ajax, including overly granular Web services, application control flow tampering, and manipulation of program logic
Â· Write new Ajax code more safelyâ€”and identify and fix flaws in existing code
Â· Prevent emerging Ajax-specific attacks, including JavaScript hijacking and persistent storage theft
Â· Avoid attacks based on XSS and SQL Injectionâ€”including a dangerous SQL Injection variant that can extract an entire backend database with just two requests
Â· Leverage security built into Ajax frameworks like Prototype, Dojo, and ASP.NET AJAX Extensionsâ€”and recognize what you still must implement on your own
Â· Create more secure â€œmashupâ€ applications

Ajax Security will be an indispensable resource for developers coding or maintaining Ajax applications; architects and development managers planning or designing new Ajax software, and all software security professionals, from QA specialists to penetration testers.
