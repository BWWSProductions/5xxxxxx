im running HTC desire which has been rooted and running the free version of rom manager, im a bit of a newb to all ths (just rooted the handset today and only bought it yesterday) so any help or guidance would be appreciated.

cheers keep up the good work, youve got enough up her to keep my desire happy for a good while.

oh and by the off chance any tips on installing froyo 2.2 on my handset using rom manager (download link would be nice aswell if you could)

thanks agian mate, will seed til i bleed."
[T],xxThugxx,2010-08-18T02:06Z,"i also have a desire, im not a big fan of rom manager tho, in my opinion you should flash the unrevoked version of the clockwork mod recovery, then you can just download a custom froyo rom from somewhere like xda-developers and flash it from recovery "

[T],xxThugxx,2010-09-05T01:38Z,"the new version of htc sync is out now that supports froyo, its easy without htc sync to install apps though, when you connect your device set it to disk drive mode, copy any .apk to a location on your sd card. then when you disconnect your device use any file explorer to navigate to where you copied the .apk's. then just click on them to install"

It'd be great if you would =)."
