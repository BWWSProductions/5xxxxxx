          The mad and evil scientist, Dr. Clayton Forrester, has
   created an evil little scheme that is bound to give him world 
   global domination but first thing's first. He plans to torment 
   Mike Nelson and the robots by sending them a real stinker of a
   film to watch called, "This Island Earth." He is convinced that
   this movie will drive them insane. And since the guys cannot
   control when the movie begins or ends, they are forced to witness
   the true horror that is this awful movie that has a lobster creature
   dressed in slacks. But will this be the ultimate cheese that breaks
   the boys' spirits? It's up to one test subject's quick wit, sharp
   sense of humor, and utter intolerance for cinematic garbage to foil 
   the plans of the scientist and to save the Earth.
