,femtilappen,2010-08-03T01:14Z,thanks allot if this works!
,nofear24,2010-08-03T16:01Z,Does this have maps for south africa? Does anybody have maps for SA? thanx
,tgcleader,2010-09-14T11:36Z,Can I just install this one and then after download the North America Maps on the application? Cause I had the 8.0.616 North America version and that was registered as professional and let my download any countries maps and that worked on android 2.1 but I now have android 2.2 on my droid x and that one no longer works.
,tgcleader,2010-09-14T14:54Z,Update tried the same exact process except I added the NA folder to the root of the copilot folder which is the North America Maps and it worked perfectly thanks for this.

Where can i find the serial code?

Many Thanks."
,Sweeeet,2010-09-21T02:06Z,"I had 8.0.something installed before, but it stopped working after I upgraded from Android 2.1 to 2.2, so I uninstalled the old version but left the copilot directory with my maps on the SD card. When I installed this version, it did not ask me for a registration key or maps. It worked immediately.

Thanks for the upload, works very nicely!

P.S.: The app asks for the permission to send SMS messages and to initiate a phone call. These requests are not a sign of a malicious manipulation as the official Copilot version asks for them, too."
,hectorc01,2010-09-26T23:18Z,Thanks for the uploads had loads of them all work a treat. Dont suppose you or anyone has satski?? Thanks in advance keep up the good work
,goodz,2010-10-11T00:29Z,"I installed the problem. It works like a charm. Serial worked as well. The big problem is on step 5 in the instructions. I tried to copy the maps to
sd\copilot\EU
and to \copilot on main disc but it still cannot find any maps. I get 2 options when I start Copilot,
1. Download maps
2. Get maps through computer
Noone of them seems to work as well...
Please guide me who to fix this.
Thanks for the upload! "

,k_anka,2010-10-24T19:51Z,"Has anyone tried the Copilot Central 2.0 software with this installation? I would like to backup my settings and import POI's from my old navigator.

Does it work or do I risk my installation on my phone?

Great torrent - works fine on HTC Desire with Android 2.2."

,blackfly_uk,2011-01-28T20:03Z,"Has anyone else had hinky stuff happening with thier e-mail accounts after installing this?

Maybe coincidence, but my default mail setting on my PC and my push settings on my droid both got changed. 

Was working fine and I know I didn't touch them."
[T],xxThugxx,2011-03-01T00:45Z,"blackfly_uk, i don't know exactly what your accusing me of, but i take pride in all my uploads i can assure you any issues you are having, has nothing to do with any of my apps."

[T],xxThugxx,2011-05-21T20:34Z,"dUDE5000 you need to free up some space, android wont let you go below a set amount of internal storage when installing apps, usually 30-35mbs, once you install you can move the main app to your sd card, and reinstall the apps you uninstalled."
