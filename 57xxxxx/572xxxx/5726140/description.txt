Rammstien - Sonne

Lyrics:
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, out

Everyone is waiting for the light
be afraid, don't be afraid
the sun is shining out of my eyes
it will not set tonight
and the world counts loudly to ten

One
Here comes the sun
Two
Here comes the sun
Three
It is the lightest star of all
Four
Here comes the sun

The sun is shining out of my hands
it can burn, it can blind you all
when it breaks out of the fists
it lays down hotly on the face
it will not set tonight
and the world counts loudly to ten

One
Here comes the sun
Two
Here comes the sun
Three
It is the lightest star of all
Four
Here comes the sun
Five
Here comes the sun
Six
Here comes the sun
Seven
It is the lightest star of all
Eight, nine
Here comes the sun

The sun is shining out of my hands
it can burn, it can blind you
when it breaks out of the fists
it lays down hotly on your face
it lays down painfully on your chest
balance is lost
it lets you go hard to the floor
and the world counts loudly to ten

One
Here comes the sun
Two
Here comes the sun
Three
It is the lightest star of all
Four
And it will never fall from the sky
Five
Here comes the sun
Six
Here comes the sun
Seven
It is the lightest star of all
Eight, nine
Here comes the sun
