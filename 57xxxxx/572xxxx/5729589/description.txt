These are a host of files related to the death of Pat Tillman. This includes:

-Statements from his mother and brother
-News articles from ABC News, the AP, Sports Illustrated, and others (a URL is usually supplied at the top of the document)
-Army docs (from their "investigations") from the ESPN.com archives
-Photos

I hope that these can be of practical assistance.
