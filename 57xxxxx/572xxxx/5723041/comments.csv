[V],RobbingHood,2010-07-29T22:41Z,"@Bosnian_blod 

Your problem is known as a dummies problem of people who don't read the install notes. So they don't know that the codes work in pairs.
You could try the patch instead, but most likely you're just trying to fuck up this torrent, so go ahead and make my day."

I'm following the instructions properly, but when I run the patch off the keygen, I click on the directory, but after I select the 'shared plugins' folder, it gives me an error.

Same thing happens if I don't select the plugins folder.

Help?
Thanks btw, hoping to work with this asap, LK 25HM video needs to be made for WoW"

Right-click the rar file, click ""Extract here..."", unzip with WinRar. Note: your computer antivirus might find malicious, potentially threating programs within the file. THIS IS A FALSE POSITIVE. It does this with most unknown .exe files. It is not a virus. Get a better anti-virus like avast pro!

Moving on...

Go to your Control Panel.
Find Network Connections.
Right-click active connection and disable.
Why? Just in case when it asks to Activate, no unwanted connections will come through and keep you from activating.

Disconnect from the internet.

Open the folder that was extracted called ""SSV.MST.HD.PE.10.0.179_[RH]"", then the folder ""Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10.0.179"".

Install application ""sv.moviestudio.pe.10.0.179"". Do NOT run it yet.

Go back to the ""Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10.0.179"" folder, open the folder called ""Keygen"". Turn off your sound if you want to ignore the annoying techno 
music. -_-

Right-Click ""Sony Products Multikeygen v1.8"" and run as Adimnistrator. Press ""continue"" button on the splash page. Press ""Patch..."" button in the keygen program. It will open a window. It will ask you to locate a folder to patch. Find ""Program Files"" and expand the list, locate ""Sony"" folder. Expand the list. SELECT on the folder ""Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10.0"". Press OK to patch that folder.

Once again it will open a window. It will ask you to locate a folder to patch. Find ""Program Files"" and expand the list, locate ""Sony"" folder. Expand the list. SELECT on the folder ""Shared Plug-Ins"". Press OK to extract.

If it asks for an activation code, copy it from the keygen.

You should be good to go to RECONNECT to the internet."

Like I said, I apologize, I can see how frustrating it is to have to answer the same question so many times, but so far I have not seen this question asked (I looked extensively at all the prior questions and answers to see if they would assist me and no dice).

,BigPDogg,2011-03-16T07:45Z,"First off, I never really leave comments. I have to say that the instructions can be construed as somewhat unclear, BUT even a moron could figure this out. So for those of you that were unsuccessful, you either have the shittiest, most virus infected computer in the world; and/or your a total idiot. Here are some clear instructions for yew N3WB5:

Installing Vegas Movie Studio HD Platnium 10.0 for dummies.

1. Download the damn torrent.

2. Unrar the shit out of the file named ""SV.MST.HD.PE.10.0.179_[RH].rar""; if you dont know what that means, then kill yourself.

3. Once all the files have been extracted, you want to run and install the shit out of the file ""sv.moviestudio.pe.10.0.179.exe"", located in "".../Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10.0.179/""

4. After installation is complete, find and run the file ""Sony Products Multikeygen v1.8.exe"", which is located in "".../Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10.0.179/Keygen/""
*ITS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU RIGHTCLICK THIS KEYGEN, AND ""Run As Administrator"", OR YOUR DUMBASS WILL BE STUCK BEHEAVLED AND SPUN BY THE THOUGHT, ""Where did I go wrong?""

5. After reading the hater message on the super fake cracker of the millenia click Continue. Select the product you want to criz-to-the-ack; in this specific case its ""Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10""
"
,BigPDogg,2011-03-16T07:46Z,"6. Just to spice it up, pick a number between 419 and 421, and click the ""Generate"" button that many times.

7a. Once you have your super unique sn and act code, then click ""Patch ..."" Now browse and find your Vegas pro folder. By default, if your primary drive is C:, then the location will most likely be at
""C:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10.0\"" and click Ok
*if it is not, your an idiot for changing the default directory, and having to double think this step.

7b. Another window will pop up, and this time find the Shared plug-ins folder (which will be located in the same Sony folder as well). Click Ok, and some magical shit will begin to happen. If it gives an error, your an idiot. Go back to step 4, and re-read that shit thoroughly.

8. Go ahead and get a glimpse of your Vegas Pro software now. Start it up for the initial run and you'll be asked to enter in some info. Copy and paste the serial number from the keygen, to the software registration.

9. When asked, select the option to ""Activation from another Computer"". An html will be composed, which can be discarded.

10. Go back to the keygen, copy and paste the Activation/Authentication Code, and keep nexting the registration till you bust a nut and hit the homescreen.

If you've made it this far, you've successfully hooked yo shit up, and should rejoice by fist pumping and moonwalking simultaneously to digital insanity's music."

,BlowBye,2011-03-30T23:28Z,"Many thanks RH. Again.

This is 10 outa 10 in the two regards that counts here: The torrent and the software.

Torrent: Downloaded in literally less time than it took to brew a cup of coffee and a sandwich. Real easy install, up and running in less time than consuming said cup of coffee and sandwich. I let the software phone home on a test PC with no problems. Also ran an update check from within the software too and that came through with no problems either.

The software: This software kicks some *serious* butt. Sony branded it in the ""home studio"" category together with the likes of Corel Video Studio Pro, PowerDirector and such. But make no mistake that this is a much more serious piece of video editing software than the others. I've tried some of Sony Vegas Platinums competitors and they do not stand a chance when it comes to actual real life usage. I tried it at home out of curiosity but now use it regularily at work for piecing together short but professional looking display screen promos. It is a pleasure to work with plus ""the people upstairs"" have taken positive notice. Do the tutorials and you will be in production in less than 45 minutes for good looking output and the progress from there is real quick if you want it to be, every week I go through the help to find new and pretty damn amazing functionality. When/if you can utilize 100% of the functionality of this software you have most likely progressed to making good pro work with this software. I'm definitely not a video editing pro but it took me less than a week to get recognition at work with this software.

Which is why I feel pretty bad about cheating Sony out of their bucks so I have asked the company to go from a ""trial"" to a full license. At less than a 100 bucks it was a no brainer. In a way this torrent sold at least one more license for Sony : )"

If you click patch button before you choose platinum 10.0 you will install wrong patch and later activation code will not work. I think that is the problem of most ppl here who have problem because everyone says activation code is not working"
,ljbew,2011-06-03T03:22Z,Thanks Robbinhood & bigdogg 
,SlimAce,2011-06-06T20:30Z,The serial works.. I've tried the keygen over and over step by freaking step.. same with the patch.. the ACTIVATION KEY DOES NOT WORK
,Ido013,2011-06-07T05:41Z,The key-gen is not a false positive. It's pretty much a multiple threat virus. Doesn't mean a VIP here doesn't upload viruses this is the pirate bay after all.

Get a grip of yourself and get Sandboxie. That'll explain your rant."
,Ido013,2011-06-08T10:14Z,Sorry about that didn't know about sandboxes before. So I am grateful for this new learning experience thanks!
[V],RobbingHood,2011-06-08T20:44Z,"@Ido013 

Virusscanners don't make a difference between recognizing a false postive and a real threat. That's why most people think that every av detection is a real threat.

,BeaSTWiTHiN6669,2011-06-29T00:03Z,"Hey, I'm just wondering if this will work for x64bit. I had recently 
downloaded Vegas Pro 10 from K-k's torrent and it works fine, 
But why use that when I can get this and all the goodies too lol.
I will see if I can just merge the effect folders and get the goodies on 
my Vegas pro 10, if not I'll just delete the old and keep the new. 
I just hope this works for x64bit. I'm starting to wonder why I 
ever chose x64bit. 

Cheers

If you fail to run it as administrator it may not patch the file. I found this out myself with trial and error. I am running on Vista so I do not know if that is needed on other OS's"

I´m doing all how it must be, but it doesn´t works for me. I´ve tried both my notebooks, 32 and 64 bits and the problem is when it asks for the ""shared plugins"" folder.

Someone may have got the same problem? Please!!"
,dani332,2011-09-29T17:37Z,"Problem solved, thanks to all, if someone have some kind of trouble please contact me  I´m here to help, I must admit that the problem was in the generation step that must be clicked before patched, and this information isn´t in the install notes, but I like to thank you all that have posted a step by step instruction and for you RobbingHood for the excelent torrent!"

The Sony Products Multikeygen v1.8 did not work at all. Did all that was instructed and it would not patch. directed it to the install DIR and also shared blah blah taht it said ... and it would either go back to the install directory screen or error out..... I did however do the other one and it worked! Cheers"

All your virus software triggered is a false positive. 

Goolge false positive and Sandboxie, cause obviously you can use the info."

,Raza82,2012-02-07T09:04Z,"it works fuckin awesome !!!

if anyone of you having problems like, keygen detected as TROJAN virus :S

Then grow up plz.....a KEYGEN is always........always detected or considered as a VIRUS by any antivirus program......nothing to panic.....just allow it in ur antivirus program or disable realtime scanning/protection for few minutes........you may re-enable it after you have successfully installed & cracked the VEGAS.

by the way ""RobbingHood""......thanx a million dude :)"

 I downloaded this torrent from you and I have been faced with quite a sticky predicament. Now I am a total n00b with torrenting and I was wondering if you could help me. Basically. Whenever I try and open the multikeygen, I get a message saying ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the permissions to access the item"" Could you possibly give me a hand with this one?? thank you very much."
,inoksvere,2012-03-22T11:41Z,"@RobingHood Dude, I'm following the instructions to the dot. However, the activation code that was generated with the serial code isn't working. You have explained on several pages to people telling them that the codes work in pairs.

However, i'll hit generate: enter generated serial code, hit next, hit register later, enter activation code that was generated with that same serial code entered before, invalid code. So?"
,wvyno,2012-03-25T06:43Z,"Flawless installation. Just followed the directions and just tried to import some media into the program... seems to work fine. Haven't tried to edit or render anything, but it looks good. I can see how some people might mess up the installation process, but just read all the steps before starting and it should work fine. Avast didn't detect any viruses. I skipped Sound Forge, FYI. "
