Oh WOW, what an absolute horror!

Of the hundreds of perfect uploads 'thethingy' has provided, there was this one, slightly less than perfect, just waiting for you.  

What a waste of your ever valuable time, huh? Gosh, d'yuh think maybe it was planned to hurt you that much? 

You are beginning to bore. Would you mind keeping it to yourself?  . . . please?  Thethingy is a jewel among rocks.  "
