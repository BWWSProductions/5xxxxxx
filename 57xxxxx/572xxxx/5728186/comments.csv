,jon4fun,2010-07-31T17:09Z,"@ All - On a sad note it is now time to say goodbye to 20-40. As far as I know, there will be no more files from him.
Pledges are still coming in but they have not been as many nor as genorous as was hoped. I am still hopeful that it will work out but 20-40, as you may have read, is not.

I want to thank all those who have contributed and if you haven't yet then please consider doing so. He is not dead yet, only dying and without doing his 'encoding/upping' his death will probably be sooner rather than later.

That's all for now. Except to say that I have a few older movies and the odd item from 20-40 that I may UP in the next few weeks.

Please check here and on his last torrent on his homepage for any updates.

Thank you
Jon

P.S. my apologies to anyone who has read the comments from 'drs1982'. I hope he hasn't upset or annoyed you, believe me he is not worth it."

,believenu,2010-08-01T04:20Z,"I am sorry to hear that we will not hear from twenty forty soon.I feel for him in respect to his comments advice and just his view of the ""world"" I wish there had been something I could do but as someone in a limited income level the most I could give back is to share as seed. My own comp has been causing me no end of grief so I haven't been able to get in touch I shall though jon soon hopefully. Is there anyway we could send parts to help fix said computer as some of us friend may have something of use and even if not usable on his comp perhaps could be traded/ bartered for other things of use. I will mention and perhaps we could find a ""agency that could get something to him more on that in e-mail to follow tomorrow.from your friend from across the pond. remember seeding is sharing.."
,bender1110,2010-08-02T15:11Z,"I'd be happy to do encodes, but my upload speed isnt really fast enough to do initial seeds."
,jon4fun,2010-08-02T20:45Z,"@ ALL - I will be UP'ing some shows in memoriam of the genius that is 20-40. Gone but NOT forgotten.

They will be using his tools so expect same quality and small file size BUT do not expect them to come out quickly as my PC is not powerful enough to do the encodes quickly.

Preliminary schedule (as I can get them downloaded/encoded and UP'ed).

Sherlock E02
True Blood E07
The Gates E06
Hung E05

More will be added (or subtracted) as the week goes on.

Cheers
Jon
P.S. No haters allowed - DL the shows from another source."
