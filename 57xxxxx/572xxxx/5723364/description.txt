+----------------------------- 2010 VERSION ---------------------------------+/
 -------------------------------- *FINAL* -----------------------------------/
 
 
This is the NEW, UPDATED, and absolutely FINAL 2010 version of The Meditation
DVD. The earlier 2008 version, now extremely outdated, is rubbish compared to
this version. The old one contained 397 files. The new one contains 991 files. 
This 2010 new version is tagged "Meditactics" while the outdated lacks this tag.
 
1000's of hours of work have gone into designing this DVD.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           But first watch the groovy and very informative video trailer 
        about the DVD and the project. The trailer is all over the internet 
                         and also included on the DVD.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
WHAT IS THIS?
  This is a complete guide to meditation in both theory and practice for 
everyone. From the complete beginner to the expert. It is also an extensive 
library on meditation, containing material from some of the absolute best 
scientists and teachers in the world, all recognised experts on the complex 
topic of meditation.
 
 
It contains:
10 Hours Video (29 Video Clips)
97 Hours Audio (28 Audio books on 91 CDs converted to mp3 files)
10 000 pages of eBooks,
 
... all this on ONE single DVD
(or put the files on your hard drive, usb-stick etc).
 
 
  Check out the very user friendly and well designed manual/booklet (60 pages!)
  Online preview version:

  The manual is of course included on the DVD.
 
 
HMM, BUT WHO CARES ABOUT MEDITATION ANYWAY?
  If you enter the word "meditation" on an internet search engine you will get
about 30 million hits. Jon Kabat-Zinn's talk at Google Tech Talk about mind-
fulness meditation has been watched by over 600,000 people onThere
are now more than 200,000 research papers about meditation on the world's
biggest medical database PubMed. Anyone with a human brain and a nervous system
seems to benefit from meditation according to modern science. And we are not 
talking about some flaky pseudo-science here, but about ordinary clinical main-
stream medicine. So, although the reason why people are interested in meditation
might differ a lot, the benefits are for everyone, and they are many.
 
Mind training has been studied and proved helpful in the many areas: 

     PERFORMANCE - Efficiency, productivity and creativity, attention, 
                   transforming habits
   SOCIAL SKILLS - Communication, conflict management, kindness, 
                   social courage
 PHYSICAL HEALTH - Sleep quality, pain management, immune system, 
                   stress reduction, skin health
   INNER BALANCE - Empathy, emotional stability, concentration, 
                   stress management, spiritual development, anger management, 
                   dealing with depression
 
Every single claim above is supported by academic references on the DVD.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
WHY SO *MUCH* STUFF?
  There are so many kinds of people. Material which suits one person may not be 
appreciated at all by another. We want to give you the whole range and depth of 
meditation. If you give this DVD to someone they get the most complete
introduction imaginable. It is still equally beneficial for the expert.
 
BUT WILL I NOT GET TOTALLY LOST IN ALL THAT MATERIAL?
  No, you won't. The carefully designed and indexed colour booklet, complete
with screenshots, detailed info, tagging and much more will guide you along, 
according to your liking and taste. Everything from really simple topics to the
complicated and advanced material are indexed so you won't get lost in any way.
 
SO WHAT ABOUT THE SCIENCE, HEALTH AND SPIRITUALITY PERSPECTIVES? DO YOU TRY TO
COMBINE ALL THREE OF THEM INTO A BIG UNIFIED WHOLENESS?
  No, we don't. You can choose to do that, or NOT to do that. We just noticed
that people like meditation for different reasons, be it scientific, health-
oriented or spiritual. We wanted to make everybody happy by giving them all
three dishes, the best ones we could find. So, you pick the pieces you
want. We are agenda free. Use what you find helpful and discard the aspects
which you do not find of value. Furthermore, it is not the intention of the
designers to promote any particular religion, scientific organization,
movement, or belief system whatsoever.
 
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?
  We hardly know ourselves. From the viewpoint of both Western and Eastern
philosophy that really is not a easy question to answer at all.
 
WHY DID YOU DO ALL THIS?
  Because Meditation rocks! And we want to make you glad.
And also to contribute towards making the world a bit more sane. Our way of
doing this is to provide powerful theoretical frameworks plus practical tools
which can be used to train and develop a healthier, sharper and more caring
mind. Our hope is that this DVD will be interesting, amusing and helpful.
 
BUT REALLY, WHAT IS THE BIG FUSS ABOUT?
Whether we are talking about individual or collective well-being one thing is
certain: just as our cultural environment affects our inner worlds the opposite
is equally true; our interior structures, our states of mind, do affect behav-
iour and external structures and therefore society. It is a dialectic relation
and not a one way lane, and meditation according to some theorists is the
quickest and most certain means for internal growth. Plus it has neurological, 
behavioural and psychotherapeutic data to support its effectiveness.
  It goes without saying that meditation/mind training has a great capacity to
deal with an impressive variety of both individual and social problems in an
extremely cost effective way. This is equally true to other kinds of education
in general. Meditation should not be understood as some kind of egocentric
anti-worldly navel-gazing, but as a practice that has effects on many social-
relational aspects of life.
 
SO YOU MEAN MEDITATION CAN BE BENEFICIAL IN MANY DIFFERENT FIELDS?
  Only if we were complete idiots would we believe that all problems in the
world would disappear because of mind training. But it would likewise be quite
ignorant not to use and benefit from, and further evaluate, its range of effec-
tive potentials. There is a huge need in our society to generate healthier,
more compassionate and insightful ways of responding to our life conditions.
Anyone who watches the evening news notices this. The quality of mind
determines the quality of behavior. And the quality of how we act in turn
determines the rules of social conduct which shape our culture, thus giving
rise to the kind of society we will have to live in, as well as conform to.
Many other important factors besides mind-training, are necessary to examine
and apply on a practical level. If this will happen there is a slight chance to
make both individuals and societies in this world evolve in a little bit less
miserable way.
 
WOW, THIS DVD REALLY ROCKS! CAN I HELP THE PROJECT SOMEHOW?
  Oh, yeah! That is certain. Use your imagination. There are many ways. You 
might like to help distribute the DVD. Or you might like to buy a few empty DVD 
discs, burn copies and share them around. Or you could share it on the net.
Spreading the word is also extremely helpful! If you like you could write a
review of the DVD on your blog. Facebook about it! Tweet it!
 
WHY SHARE THIS DVD?
  There are numerous reasons why you might want to distribute or copy this DVD.
Perhaps you want someone to enjoy some of the experiences you have had.
Perhaps you have a friend or relative who would be helped by specific parts of
the DVD. Perhaps you know someone who is interested in personal development, or
someone who is depressed or suffers from physical pain.

                     The effect of this DVD on our culture
                   equals the effort we put into sharing it.

UNBIASED QUALITY GUARANTEE
  Most of the people featured on this DVD are either M.D.s or professionals with
PhDs in the subjects they teach. The few without academic qualification are
acknowledged meditation masters, including nuns and monks, who have devoted
their entire lives to intense and skilful practice. Both scientists and
persons committed to different spiritual traditions are represented. What they
have in common is that they are all recognised experts on the complex topic of
meditation. Thus it can be clearly stated that this product in no way promotes
either strange cults or suspicious swindlers, i.e. individuals or organizations
who try to make a quick profit on the basis of the recent popularization of
meditation in the public consciousness.
