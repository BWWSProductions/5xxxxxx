 Release Notes
 -------------
 Source: Toy.Story.3.2010.TC.720p.x264-CiRiTH [THANKS!]

 English Hard Coded subs for non English Parts. According to source nfo it was
 taken from a dual-1080p chinese telecine containing two video streams side by
 side and cropped down to just one. Very Nice Job guys! 

 OK,well it has some ghosting issues,not much could be done there. Adjusted
 colors,sharpeness,contrast,etc. PrisM's LiNE was used(Thanks guys!). Not sure
 who actually synced it,but thanks to them to. Video is actually really nice
 and does however have the occasional Chinese subs at the bottom of the screen.
 However,should do until retail is around. Enjoy!=]
