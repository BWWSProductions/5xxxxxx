There's no doubt about it,Michael Collins Piper, the author of Final Judgment, is one of the Israeli lobby's primary targets today. Repeatedly and bitterly attacked by propagandists for Israel, Piper is undaunted, despite the fact his life was publicly threatened by Irv Rubin, violent leader of the terrorist Jewish Defense League. Once, after discovering an illicit wiretap on his home telephone, Piper noted wryly, 'The Vatican didn't put it there."
