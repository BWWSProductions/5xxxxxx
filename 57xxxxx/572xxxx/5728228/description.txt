           Filmmaker Kimberly Reed returns home for her high school       
           reunion, ready to reintroduce herself to the small town        
           as a transgender woman and hoping for reconciliation with      
           her long estranged adopted brother Marc. Things are            
           complicated by the shocking revelation that Marc may be        
           the grandson of Orson Wells and Rita Hayworth, forcing         
           Kim and her family to explore questions of sexual              
           orientation, identity, severe trauma and love.
