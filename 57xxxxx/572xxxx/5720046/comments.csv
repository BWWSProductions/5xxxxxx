Springer 2010 | ISBN-10: 9048128870 | 260 Pages | PDF

The thermodynamic properties, reactivities and electronic properties of molecular compounds and materials depend on structure. Therefore, an important basis for progress is to fully appreciate and fundamentally understand the intimate relation between structure and function.

Structure and Function describes various fundamental aspects of structures, dynamics and physics of molecules and materials. The approaches, data and models discussed include new theoretical developments, computational studies and experimental work from molecular chemistry to biology and materials science."
