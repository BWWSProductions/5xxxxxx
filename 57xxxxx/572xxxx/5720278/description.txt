Director Sam Peckinpah's film The Wild Bunch is a powerful tale of hang-dog desperados bound by a code of honor. It is said that The Wild Bunch rates as one of the all-time greatest Westerns, perhaps one of the greatest of all films. In 1994 it was restored to a complete, pristine condition unseen since its July 1969 release, and this new high-definition transfer showcases it yo renewed blood-and-thunder effect.
Watch William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan and more great stars saddle up for the role of a lifetime.
