BatÃ´ is a living cyborg.
His whole body, even his arms and legs, are entirely man-made.
What only remains are traces of his brain and the memories of a woman.
In an era when the boundary between humans and machines has become infinitely vague, Humans have forgotten that they are humans. This is the debauchery of the lonesome ghost of a man, who nevertheless seeks to retain humanity. Innocence... Is what life is
