,michaelrwatson,2010-07-31T23:00Z,"Ok, i got that huge sample, and.... although the resolution is good, it's not watchable. The video has regular, nauseating flicker rolling across the whole image. That's why it's listed as a cam and not a ts. Thanks for the effort though."

For a cam this was v9 a8. 
I noticed hardly any flicker. The sound was a little bit off. Overall a great DL VERY watchable. This was way better than most of the TeleSyncs that I have watched. Cams just don't get any better than this.

Thanks for the upload."

This CAM is definitely watchable. There is no serious flickering as in the other torrents of this movie. And the file size for sample video is fine. 

Video: 8
Audio: 7

This is the best CAM version out there now."
