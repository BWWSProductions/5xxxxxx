,rippar86,2010-07-29T04:25Z,"The significance of this collection of data is the fact that it demonstrates the fears the tech community has had for years about social networking sites publishing personal data on the internet. It's different to say a handwritten register of users since the digital data of millions can be recorded and parsed in a couple hours. As Porkster said the records were already public but no one has yet to gather all the data and order it in such a way that it becomes information, which this directory at least practically demonstrates the concept of.
If a botnet had run this data mining racket maybe it'd be possible to get the entire facebook community's data? At least those dumb enough to leave it on the default settings (which have shared more and more info to the public almost exponentially over the last 3 years)."

It's just gathered information, which anyone of you can grab from Facebook itself legally.
It's not in any kind a hack as some are assuming.
What you find here can be found on Facebook.
And accounts which privacy settings are set correctly you'll get 0 Information about them.

However it's interesting enough to see that a high number of people are interested in this subject.

I WILL KILL YOU ALL!!!"
,cyanidesandwich,2010-08-02T03:00Z,"This torrent is a joke, people.  While I know that Facebook could give a fuck all about your privacy, and I'm pretty sure that they do sell a lot of your personal details to the highest bidder, there is absolutely nothing in this torrent that proves that, so if that's what you're looking for, then you're going to be disappointed.  If you're looking for some way to map names to zipcodes, email addresses, URLS, etc., you are going to be disappointed.   In face I can't really think of any real use for this data other than for some pretty useless statistics such as ""How many Facebook users named Bob Jones have public profiles?""  

If you want to hate Facebook, that's fine, you can join the club along with me.  However the contents of this torrent shouldn't be the reason for you doing so."
,cwgate,2010-08-02T04:16Z,Facebook censored this!  A bit late eh?
,repeaterepeater,2010-08-02T06:18Z,whoa! this is exactly why i am looking at autarchynow when it gets up and running. encrypted social networking is the future.
,maxfactor2050,2010-08-02T06:34Z,"@plasmafox2038

no offence to you in particular; nor am do I intend to offend you by getting personal.
hope you understand:)


But I fail to understand->

If a sane person who is FULLY aware of the risks of visiting a CSW (Commercial Sex Worker), has peno vaginal (or any other orifice) intercourse with such a person (man/woman/ transgender) ends up getting an STD (sexually transmitted disease).

NOW, if such a person/ customer puts it on the CSW for his disease, in your opinion is THAT the correct thing?

Facebook is in a certain ""business"" model.
(and so it a CSW)

Their primary objective usually would be ""revenue"".

Its ""US"" who ought to watch our back..
(cause I rarely know of a Sex Worker shouting at the top of their voice to warn us that STD's are in store for those who have unprotected (and sometimes even protected) physical contact with them)

Just my two pence. Hope you re-view the first paragraph that no offence to you.

@cyanidesandwich: much agree with every word @cyanidesandwich has put above.

God Bless and Keep Happy
