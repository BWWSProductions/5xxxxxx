Does God exist? Does science prove it or give us reason to doubt?

Doug Holloway (David de Vos), a family man on the verge of finacial and marital ruin, embarks on a journey to find his birth father, Dr. Eugene Holland (Victor Lundin). Dr. Holland is on a mission of his own - to prove the Holy Grail of physics - the Theory of Everything - that may prove the existence of God. His greatest challenge? Completing his quest before a degenerative brain disease (CJD) claims his ability to reason. Soon the two journeys become one as the men struggle together to rebuild their family and find new hope in God.

A moving story of family, faith, and theoretical physics, The Theory of Everything will inspire you to "Envision the Possibilities."
