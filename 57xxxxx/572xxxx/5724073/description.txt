Academy Award-winning actor and space enthusiast Morgan Freeman executive produces,
hosts and narrates this exploration of the greatest mysteries of the universe. This new
series, produced by Freeman's Revelations Entertainment, seeks the answers to the big
questions: Are we alone? Where did we come from? Is there life on other planets? From
the latest work at NASA and private enterprise facilities to the latest theories from
futurists and physicists, this series looks at black holes, colonizing the planets,
string theory and more. Science Channel invites viewers on the journey as Morgan
Freeman picks up where Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" left off and explores the new frontiers of
what is beyond earth.
