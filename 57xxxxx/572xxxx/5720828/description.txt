yurune: (from yesterday) So, are these really MP4s or FLVs? Flash Video in an MP4 containter?

   The files from the server that I grab are mp4 extensions, for example todays 3rd part on the server is DEGRASSI-1007-EP-CLIP03.MP4... doesn't fully answer the question, but from what you have said it seems to be FLV in MP4 container.  I just take it how its given!



I was delayed today... work and life happen, but here you go, Enjoy


Fun Fact: I didn't watch this show until recently when someone recommended it. 
Then watched s1-9 in about a month,  I didn't even get to watch the s10 I've uploaded until last night! ( I have a thing about watching tv in order :P )
