It's a good show isn't it?  I had never heard of it until November 2007, when I was randomly flipping the channels.  After watching several episodes, I liked it so much I stopped watching it, and went back and watched Degrassi Junior High, Degrassi High, School's Out, and The Kids Of Degrassi Street.  Then I started with Next Generation, watching all seasons/episodes in order of course (like you I have a thing about watching tv in order).  The show from the 80s/90s is just as good as the current one.  I am loving season 10! Thanks for uploading it! :D

PS - You might not like The Kids Of Degrassi Street, since it's about elementary school children, and the problems they have are not controversial and ""adult"" like the other series.  I liked it though.  You can definitely see the genesis of Degrassi.  There are several actors from the other series in it, but none of the same characters, so you don't have to watch it first, in fact I watched it after Degrassi High."

and wow all 9 seasons in one month :o. lol but yes good show, I started watching it when I was younger and have become completely obsessed again recently. Theres like 4 seasons in the middle I've missed but now that it's all new people I don't really feel the need to catch up :P."
,P2P-ftw,2010-07-28T08:29Z,"if you missed the middle seasons, you missed a lot... like many shows you can pick it up and watch, but you will get it more if you have more info...  

btw the web extras are amazing, and you kinda need to know to appreciate"
,yurune,2010-07-28T12:51Z,"Wow, I didn't catch that you watched seasons 1-9 in ONE MONTH!  And I thought I did some serious marathoning.  It took me 2 and a half years to get through 1-9, including DJH, DH, SO, & TKODS, but still.

Btw, it's fantastic we're gonna have 48(!) episodes this season.  I hope they will double that for season 11.  Eventually we will have a new Degrassi episode for every day of the year.  I guess that's why you don't see all the characters in every episode.  I've noticed Riley only shows up in the episodes all about him.  I think they should built an apartment complex next door to the set, and have all the actors and crew live there so that can film 24/7/365."
