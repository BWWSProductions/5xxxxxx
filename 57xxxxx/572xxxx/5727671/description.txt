PLOT

Imagine every cell phone, radio, and television in your city suddenly broadcasting the same mysterious signal over and over. Now imagine these "terminus" transmissions evoking violent, uncontrollable, psychotic chaos from everyone who comes in contact with them.

The Signal invades the minds of everyday citizens living their workaday lives and having their sordid affairs. Suddenly struck by the power of the insidious transmissions, they are compelled to kill or be killed. Complicating matters is a zombielike resistance some characters have to the idea of remaining dead. The story violently explodes, blending bloody gore with psychological satire, for a truly original horror experience. The Atlanta filmmaking team of David Bruckner, Dan Bush, and Jacob Gentry tell the eerie tale in three parts (cleverly called "transmissions"), shifting perspectives to draw out a larger story that explores dark secrets and fears as well as jealousy and betrayal.

Not for the faint of heart, The Signal will nonetheless satisfy those looking for a smart exploration of the power of media to mutate our minds. It is truly inspired independent filmmaking that will stalk viewers from every dark corner while examining the surprising human madness lying deep within. 



REVIEW


If you want out and out horror, then it's not for you.

If you want something original and clever, with bizarre scenarios and witty banter, and a gruesome twist......then here it is! I watched this with no preconceptions, and was totally entertained throughout.

It manages to mix Bloodied gruesome horror, dark comedy and savage humour with absolute finesse, and definitely makes you think what you would do if you was in the exact same situation.

I will admit that the first two parts of the film were the most entertaining, but it still didn't end with any disappointment.

Well worth watching!
