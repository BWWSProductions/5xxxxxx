No court in the world would prosecute anyone for watching/downloading this on the grounds of child pornography.  It was massed produced.  She was an ""underage"" girl that slipped through the system and became mainstream adult entertainment.  The only thing that makes her popular is that she lied about her age and said she was two years older than what she was when she made this movie..boring..."

Not going to comment on the legalities, since that depends on the country."
,JJammin1,2010-08-02T03:42Z,"In the U.S. they do prosecute people in possession of illegal Traci Lords videos under child pornography laws. If any performers engaged in sex acts in a pornographic video, photo, etc. are under the age of 18, it is considered child pornography in the U.S. and many other countries."
