A most excellent 80's film. Starring Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter.

----
Two dopey dudes are failing in school, a visitor appears to help them out. A most excellent adventure follows thereafter! Dude, I'd put more for the synopsis, but it'd ruin the whole film. ;)

ENJOY!!!

P.S:

To EASILY put on a DVD:

1. download a free video converter 
(http://download.cnet.com/Free-Video-Converter/3000-2194_4-75024034.html)

   -Don't trust the "does not work" comments. Once downloaded, go on 'Video Info' and
    set the year date to '1987' or something. It's what I did to beat the pop up that 
    says "Invalid Date" or some shit. :)


2. open up file once downloaded, and convert to DVD Format.

3. once converted it's as simple as using Windows Movie Maker to make a dvd.

4.  Enjoy your bodacious copy of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, dudes! ~~~MM


P.P.S:
