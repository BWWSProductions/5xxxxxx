Belinda Jo Carlisle (born August 17, 1958) is a Grammy Award-nominated American singer and best-selling author. Carlisle gained worldwide fame as the lead vocalist of The Go-Go's, who made history as the first all-female music group to write their own songs and play their own instruments to top the Billboard charts.
