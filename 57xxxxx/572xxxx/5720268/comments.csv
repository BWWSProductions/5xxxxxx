,vivatpb5776,2011-06-27T23:01Z,"@mirrormaster82: Seems like we have a bunch of movie critics on here. No one gives a good rat's ass what you think of a particular movie. The comments section is used to submit comments on the quality of the .torrent, not the opinions of some no name person. If we wanted to get a review of the movie, we would call up Ebbert. Get a clue.

For everyone else, the audio and video quality of the movie is good. The screen resolution (720*400) makes it tricky to stream to a larger television. If you do, be prepared for a loss of quality. I used mkvmerge to remove any extraneous content as well as convert this from a .mkv to a .mp4. Thank you uploader."
