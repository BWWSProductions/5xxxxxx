Storyline:

A re-envisioning of George Romero's apocalyptic horror classic. An unexplained plague has decimated the world's population--and yet, the dead aren't dying.They've become zombies, stalking endlessly in a quest to feed on the flesh and blood of the few remaining living.A ragtag group of desperate survivors in a Wisconsin town seek refuge in a large indoor mall, where they must learn not only to protect themselves from the ever-increasing zombie horde, but also to co-exist with each other as a last bastion of humanity.Sealed off from the rest of what used to be the world, the group uses every available resource, in their against-all-odds fight, to remain alive and human.
