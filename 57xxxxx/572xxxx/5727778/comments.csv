,W_Irizarry,2010-08-09T15:07Z,This torrent is legit.  Thanks Carter67!  The best thing about this is that it doesn't use a crack that can potentially be a virus on your computer.  I won't download torrents that have a modified .exe file anymore because of the potential danger.  BitDefender and Ad-Aware both say this is clean.
