Keith Green - Rare Concert Recordings (Unreleased?)

These rare recordings of Keith Green Live are not available for purchase anywhere as far as I know. They reflect the musical talent and energy of Keith's Live concerts back in the early days.

This collection is released on July 28th, 2010 which is a special anniversary for Last Days Ministries. http://www.lastdaysministries.comÂ Â Exactly 28 years ago today, Keith Green who was 28 years old died in a plane crash with 2 of his children and a wonderful family who were visiting their ministry. 28/28/28

If you are blessed by these recordings then please support Last Days Ministries financially. If they are available for purchase somewhere then please buy them and delete these files. I have searched the net and cannot find these anywhere for purchase at this time.

May God bless you and we will see you in Heaven!
