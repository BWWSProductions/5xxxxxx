Description: 
The BAFTA-winning Coast journeys around the British 
Isles and beyond to see how shared seas unite us all.
The voyage continues along England's south-west coast 
from Dorset, through Devon and onwards to the tip of 
Cornwall.Neil Oliver performs the lead role in an extract 
from Shakespeare's The Tempest on the stage of a 
remarkable coastal amphitheatre near Land's End. 
Neil discovers how this unique theatre was built thanks to 
the obsession of one woman determined to stage the 
Bard's famous play in the open air next to the sea at her 
home in Cornwall. Neil also explores the lasting legacy of 
black American GIs who came to Britain to prepare for D-
Day.Nick Crane ventures out into the infamous Portland 
Tidal Race to see how this fearsome tidal surge creates 
some of the roughest waters in Britain, surprisingly close to 
the tourist beaches and Georgian splendour of 
Weymouth.Miranda Krestovnikoff goes in search of a 
family of white-beaked dolphins. These elusive cold water 
creatures are rarely seen off the English coast, so why is 
this group so far south?Mark Horton has privileged 
access to the historic dockyards at Devonport to see 
where the wooden ships of Nelson's navy were built, 
Mark reveals how the steel fleet of the modern Royal 
Navy still relies on the age old skills of woodworking. 
Alice Roberts is following her nose to discover what 
gives the sea its distinctive smell; it's the unmistakable 
whiff we associate with holidays, but for many animals 
it's a smell that spells the difference between life and 
death.
