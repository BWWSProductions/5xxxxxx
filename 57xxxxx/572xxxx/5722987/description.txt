[note]
[color=orange]
Usual work done.  I personally rip the english subtitle off from VOMiT's DVDR release and
sync it perfectly with my release.

Continuing to provide QUALITY which is our priority. Special filters used which takes a lot
of time to encode. For those who wait you know what your getting and we dont disappoint.

This release has been encoded to be 100% compatible to all players.

Colors, brightness and contrast untouched same as source. We do not touch source to preserve
the picture the way it was intended to be shown.

Standard filesize implemented to make this release DVD burn friendly.

This release has been burned and tested to play on a standalone divx player.

For best results play on:
PC - KMPlayer (ver. 2.9.4.1435)
PS3
XBOX 360
Popcorn Hour
Divx standalone player
WD TV HD media player
