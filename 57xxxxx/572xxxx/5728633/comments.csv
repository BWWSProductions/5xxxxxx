Now it's +1 / -7 (-6) 

Maybe just some spammers, or maybe because TPB is buggy atm."

I know, he bent over for me and picked up the soap. Just ask my homegirls, they saw him do it.

P.s. He was soft and sensual. No regrets. NO REGRETS. "

,jimraso,2010-09-25T17:39Z,"I totally recommend this software. I bought this before it was ripped off unfortunately. ;(

It works better and faster than handbrake, megui, mkvmerge for hdtv ts stream rips. I'm doing 2-pass 10gb h-264 re-encodes in less than 2 hours, where as handbrake was taking 8 hours for a 2-pass.  If you have an nvidia video card, this prog uses CUDA booster.  This makes it 4 times faster than anything out there for re-encodes. i rate this product 10/10"
