,dove91,2010-07-28T20:19Z,"@anchre : sometimes reading from an external hard drive or from a cd/dvd causes this,try copying the film to your main hard drive and playing it,unless you are already.  hope you fix it anyway."
,moviz247,2010-07-28T21:56Z,thanx buddy
,chitshunks,2010-07-29T02:10Z,"I rarely review samples, but I did this time.  It wasn't bad.  I will probably download the entire thing later.  I guess, if I'm judging by the sample, I'd say it's like a/6, v/6-7.  Of course, I'm rarely picky if I can see and hear what's going on.  My 2 crappy cents."

,SkywalkerYanni,2010-07-30T11:00Z,"HI, I want to download movies with a 1080p res but all the files are so massive. I dont mind downloading 900m-1.5gig movies but like 4gigs for one movie is huge. ANy one know an uploader of somthing that uploads 1080p movies at a decent file size. I mean if thiis guy can get 720p ones to 500mg there must be a way .
Thanks in advance."
