,CharlieTann,2010-07-31T17:50Z,"Yes there are 30 episodes, I'll be uploading disc 3 & 4 sometime in the next week. I want to give these a few days for people to download. I can't get more than a 95kb/s upload speed!!! Yes I said 95 KB/S!! It is shit so I'll only be seeding these for the next 3 or 4 days so it would be helpful if a couple of you could seed it. BTW even if your not interested in the old commercials please watch them, they are hilarious, especially one of the cigarette commercials. They promote how they will IMPROVE your health.  And DAMN Anne Francis is HOT!"
