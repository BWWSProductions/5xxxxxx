,Pathiic,2010-08-13T09:02Z,Contains a Trojan called Alureon.CT
[T],carter67,2010-08-14T19:01Z,Fellas you do realize that cracks and the like are of a similar type programming to virusus and most antivirus software reads them as dodgy when really their harmless except to the software they are designed to interfere with...This upload is Clean.  
,Whosit101,2010-09-03T14:21Z,"The Alureon Trojan is contained in the programs executable, not the crack.

Which means that either the program contains some type of malware (not totally unbelievable), or someone has modified it as well.

I couldn't find a clean site that offered downloads of older versions to test if it was."

,sabbas123,2010-12-19T02:40Z,"after using i got problem with this crack first is warning by avg and the second is if we start the program through the starter file it shows unregistere version, starting with crack file it's working"
