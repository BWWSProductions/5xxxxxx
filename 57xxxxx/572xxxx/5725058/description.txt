- On Eve of Major Protests, Federal Judge Blocks Key Provisions of Arizona Anti-Immigrant Law

A federal judge in Phoenix blocked key provisions of Arizona's notorious anti-immigrant law on Wednesday, hours before it was scheduled to take effect. US District Judge Susan Bolton ruled a partial injunction would apply to the portion of the law that requires police officers to stop and interrogate anyone they suspect is an undocumented immigrant. The law sparked mass protests across the country and a boycott of Arizona. We speak with Isabel Garcia, co-chair of the Tucson-based Coalition for Human Rights.
