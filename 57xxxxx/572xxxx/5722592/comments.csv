,RMJ13,2010-07-28T23:45Z,can you save game in this version or is this CRAP too?
,Squiglet,2010-07-29T07:52Z,"Whe I copy over the Update folder and the Update.bat and try to run it, it tells me: 

There is no patch file to apply




What am I doing wrong? Anyone else encountering this issue?"
,finallygotitworking,2010-07-29T10:05Z,"i got it working without installing again. I installed from the DVD (could be any real SC2 install tho) and started the torrent in the starcraft installation folder... thought it was a mistake at first but it's actually convenient. Once it finishes downloading in the installation folder, stop the torrent from seeding. Run update.bat as admin. Then go back to torrent client and force recheck of files. torrent should now be 99.4% or something, so start it again and in a few seconds you can play the game!"

,mobiuss,2010-07-29T21:06Z,"thanks for torrent i write this text on all stacraft 2 torrents because real info for how to installs game is, install game offline when you get message that you must be online click on orange button on right side of screen and enter code from reloaded nfo, when game installing use skip if installer try to go online, now next when is game fully installed, dont go online, but first copy support and updates dir and updates.bat from reloaded crack in your game dir, now click on updates.bat to install patch when is finished copy Battle.net, Versions dir and StarCraft II.exe to the install dir, play the game.

have a nice day all!!!! "

,mobiuss,2010-07-31T14:34Z,"first time when you start playing game click start campaign, later when you finished missions start game from your saved files in documents\starcraft II saves"
