,Mr.Wolfe,2011-05-13T10:58Z,"In some cases that could be considered lucky, mokho. I've had downloads that took a couple days to complete before. Some, if they had stayed slow, would have taken up to two weeks or longer. One time I even had one claim it would take 9999 years to finish, but that went down about an hour later. I think that one was a connection problem on my part."
