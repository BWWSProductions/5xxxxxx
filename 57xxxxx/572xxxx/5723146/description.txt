Documentary telling the story of the day that music rocked the world. Bob Geldof
recalls how, after 12 weeks of manic preparation, the big day finally arrived. But
would it work, would the punters watch, and more importantly would they part with
their cash?

Bob Geldof and his team recall their fear of how the whole thing might fall apart at
any minute. Stars from the day itself - , Queen, Paul McCartney, David
Bowie, U2 and a whole host of others - remember walking out to face a crowd of
72,000 and a global audience of billions. And those who watched it at home,
including Tony Blair, JK Rowling and Helen Fielding, recall how they didn't miss a
minute of this extraordinary event.
