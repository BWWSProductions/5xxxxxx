ADOBE PHOTOSHOP PLUGINS [thethingy] aamkmaacp

Knoll Light Factory

Photoshop co-creator and Star Wars effects guru John Knoll developed Knoll Light 
Factory to mimic the reflections from a very bright light source as seen through 
a camera's lens. It's proven to be one of the most popular plug-ins for both 
Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. Knoll Light Factory goes far beyond the 
typical lens flares found in Photoshop, with over 100 great presets, real-time 
previewing, and 19 powerful flare tools for creating your own custom effects.

Custom lens editor and elements
Choose from 19 different flare elements, and layer them to create just the 
look you want. Real-time previews give you instant feedback, and 16-bit 
rendering reduces banding and creates better-looking output. Obscuration 
layers enable objects in the scene to partially block an effect. Once you've 
got just the look you want, it's easy to save your own presets for future use 
in Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.

Photorealistic lighting effects
Knoll Light Factory's effects are based on the real-world physics of light 
passing through glass lens elements of all kinds. Give your photos the 
characteristic look of inexpensive digital cameras or legendary Panavision 
lenses. Apply sci-fi effects such as Arc Welder or Distant Quantum or add 
subtle sparkle to jewelry, movie posters, or nighttime scenes.
