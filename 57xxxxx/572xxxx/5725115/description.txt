From optimumreleasing.com, I bring you (dix rips of) Sweeney! and Sweeney 2.  The movie(s).

I have taken the time to incude the credit soundtrack also (from Sweeney!) for a giggle.

Ripped using DVD Magic 5.5.0

Seem like good rips, sorry if they suck - I just spent 4 hours of my life doing this, I can't be arsed to check 'em first.  They seem good - but - comment.  That's how we all get a good/fair deal.

Fact is, this is guarateed to be value for money!

SHUT UP, YOU SLAG!  YOU'RE NICKED!



P.S. My ISP has me on 25K up.  Be patient!!!  24/7 seed...


Peace to all, love to all, smash the NWO : Sharing is caring...
