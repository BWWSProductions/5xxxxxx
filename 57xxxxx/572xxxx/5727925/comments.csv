,seiferd,2010-08-03T19:54Z,"Are we sure there is no malware in this one? ClamXav didn't detect anything on the other one that got pulled. 

Anyone got intego who can run a scan?"
,seiferd,2010-08-03T20:17Z,"Just scanned myself, looks clean!"
,kl20,2010-08-07T13:16Z,what's the serial number for this??
,kl20,2010-08-07T13:20Z,"I found the install numbers in my downloaded files, but when I entered it, it said it wasn't valid. Help on this?"
,kl20,2010-08-07T13:29Z,"Sorry everyone, this is my very first experience with Pirate bay, please excuse all the questions. :) When I tried to use the product key when asked, that's what came up as ""invalid"", but I just entered the Word key, and it worked immediately. Thank you!"
,astro123,2010-08-08T06:59Z,"Works great! Couple of hints:
1. The main serial number is for the Beta 4; not sure why this was included. In this beta, you need to enter the individual serial number for each app (Word, Excel, etc.) and then each one works fine.
2. If you are trying to patch the expiration, there is a bug in the script posted by ""sixer"". Replace the TARGET line with the following:
TARGET=""/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/MicrosoftComponentPlugin.framework/Versions/14/MicrosoftComponentPlugin""
That should work much better."
,astro123,2010-08-08T07:00Z,"In the above, make sure the TARGET is a single line, not two lines as it appears in the browser."

Will Wanderers Expiration Patch work for it?"
,becoo1,2010-08-17T11:03Z,There are rumours around that this version contains a keylogger (malware). Can somebody confirm? Thanks
,becoo1,2010-08-17T22:27Z,was a hoax! file is clean :)
,scud11,2010-08-29T15:03Z,"HELP! During installation (double clicking on *.dmg) it asks me for password, then I take it from file ""OFFICE 2011 BETA 6: MUV37..."", I click ""OK"" - and I have got information ""wrong password or user name"" - WHAT SHOULD BE A USER NAME? what I do wrong? For what I need patch command? HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP! "
,kl20,2010-08-30T19:03Z,"I see the ways around the expiration date (thanks for that!) but you're speaking to a 'computer language' newbie - so I'm unsure WHERE to input all the given information, to bypass the trial period. What file do I need to go into to bypass the trial and enter in your given information? Thank you in advance. All of it is much appreciated! :)"
,Ness4114,2010-09-02T04:50Z,"I'm sorry, I have no idea how to run the patch given by Sixer.  Can someone help?"
,ecf1965,2010-09-02T21:49Z,"@sixer
Can you tell me how to apply the expiry patch? Do I do it in Terminal? I'm not as technical as some.
Thx"
