Also, the instructions are very unprecise. Where do I install the game? What do I do with the language.txt in the crack file? What do I do with the ""Steam install replacement"" thing?"

,thethrush,2010-07-31T15:40Z,explain please how to install this game? i don't understand how to use Steam for it.
,spag007,2010-07-31T16:36Z,Same hre as thethrush. Please explain how to install step-by-step.
,spag007,2010-07-31T16:38Z,Same here as thethrush. Please explain how to install step-by-step.
,spag007,2010-07-31T16:38Z,"sorry for the double posts, I wonder why that happens."
,spag007,2010-07-31T17:02Z,"Nevermind, I got it!

Thethrush, install the game in the ""program files"", then copy the crack and the language file to c:/programfiles/commander-conquestoftheseas.
After that, add steam_api.dll to your antivirus exception list. THAT was my problem. The antivirus prevented the game from being launched because of this.

If you use AVG like I do, go to tools, then advanced settings, then resident shield, then excluded files.

And no, you do not need Steam for the game to work."
,thethrush,2010-07-31T17:33Z,"but how can i install the game?
when i launch file steambackup.exe - nothing happens %) this is the problem?"

,nsag,2010-08-01T10:34Z,"1. Unrar.
 2. Burn or mount the image.
 3. Install the game. Additional redistributables that may be needed, are in
    the destination dir.
 4. Copy over the cracked content.
 5. Play the game.

,ChiefCustard,2010-08-03T12:01Z,"Great torrent as per usual, thanks reloaded!

TO INSTALL THE GAME!!
(this is just a repeat of spag007s post as he was spot on)

Run steambackup application.
(it will come up asking for install location)
Set it to program files, (or program files x86)
It will then install.
Add steam_api.dll from the crack folder to resident shield.
Copy it to the game folder in program files along with the language file
Add the steam_api.dll that you just moved into your programs files folder to your resident shield also.
Run the game exe.
Have fun playing the game
buy it to support the developers
:)"
,mr.keda,2010-08-03T15:21Z,"my problem was that i have to instal that visual c++ thing and propably direct x and VC_RED too, these files i could instal after when i instaled game, after i instaled (These files) i was able to launch game, but it crashed, so i reinstaled the game but i dont uninstal c++ thing, direct x and VC_RED. When i reinstaled and copied cracked comtet the game work, hope this will be usefull for thoose who cant get the work. And yeah, after that i updated the game and instaled that dlc package too, dont be afraid from that glitch from main menu, after i played historical battle its disapered. "
,Gurra98,2010-08-03T18:47Z,"I have followed the instructions, but I still can`t make it to work. I have even installed it twice, and I get the same error: ""This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem"". Has this anything to do about the virus alert, and putting the files into safe?? I haven`t done that, since I do not how to do it, I have ESET NOD32, if someone could help me?
I need some help here, I have done everything I can to get this started."

,entrity,2010-08-14T14:54Z,Any reason why it doesnt show up in program files?? i cant find the install dir to copy crack over please help
,bahamor,2010-08-17T19:18Z,"Hey dudes, i figured out the ""not existing dir"" problem. Acutally I had the same problem on win 7 64 when i wanted to install in program files x86. So what you do instead is to install it in a some dir that you dont need administrator things.

Fox example most if you have multiple partition that you use for windows and other for files backing etc then use the second one.... I hope this is clear..."
,entrity,2010-08-20T01:46Z,"ah that fixed it, thanks alot"
