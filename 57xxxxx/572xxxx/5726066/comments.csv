,arsnic,2010-07-30T16:26Z,"Sorry for all of you waiting, I'm maxed out at seeding at 100 kB/s. By the way the crack has been added to the mac>games directory."
,jakhead,2010-07-30T22:45Z,Installer.app doesn't launch. There a step I'm missing?
,jakhead,2010-07-30T22:52Z,"Nevermind. Found a solution, on google. You'll need to modify permissions:
$ chmod 755 /Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/InstallerLauncher


$ chmod 755 /Installer.app/Contents/Resources/Installer.app/Contents/MacOS/Installer "
,jvhester,2010-07-31T00:01Z,I made a name on here just to say thanks.  And please seed when you're done people.
,it4lian,2010-07-31T02:37Z,"How do I use those instructions to change permissions? I really don't know anything about computers, less about a mac, so could you please help with a list or specific steps? Thank you very much"
,arsnic,2010-07-31T04:33Z,"@it4lian

You need to either use Spotlight and type in terminal then enter or go to Applications>Utilities>Terminal

Once you have done that type in:

cd [Download Directory]

This means if you have utorrent or whatever set to download to your Downloads folder you would type:

cd ~/Downloads

Next type:

chmod -R 755 ./SC2-WingsOfLiberty-enUS-Installer

This should change the ownership of the files on your computer to your account allowing you to run the file.

Please People share, I've uploaded nearly 20 gigs and I'm still the only seed!!!!"
,it4lian,2010-07-31T05:38Z,"I have the folder on my desktop to have easy access to it. I did what you told me and all this came up. Is it O.K?

,Tam-Linn,2010-07-31T06:39Z,I Love You.  will upload at 800m/s for 24 hours
,arsnic,2010-07-31T07:09Z,"First off @Tam-Linn:

Thanks.

Second @ it4lian:

Sorry you may need to add the word sudo in front of the line chmod -R 755 ./SC2-WingsOfLiberty-enUS-Installer

So,

sudo chmod -R 755 ./SC2-WingsOfLiberty-enUS-Installer

It should then prompt for your password, so something like this should happen in terminal:

YourComputerName:~ UrUsername$ cd ~/Downloads
YourComputerName:Downloads UrUsername$ sudo chmod -R 755 ./SC2-WingsOfLiberty-enUS-Installer/
Password:
YourComputerName:~ UrUsername$

At this point you should be done. Close terminal and run installer but be sure the files have reached 100% first or else you might cause problems."
,it4lian,2010-07-31T07:38Z,You guys are awesome! Thanks for all the help and patience. I appreciate it. Hope that someday I can help someone like you helped me today. Many thanks.
,WhoaD.rug,2010-07-31T16:15Z,"@arsnic

Thanks for your terminal instructions and got it to work.

However, the installer runs now and I let the app connect to the internet (maybe to verify the app as legit?) and it requested the Starcraft Disc.

I didn't let it connect the second time, and it still has the same request.

Is this because I am lacking a crack?"
,arsnic,2010-07-31T17:13Z,"@WhoaD.rug

I bought this game myself and downloaded and installed and was never asked for a disk. Once I was asked for an activation key and just skipped that screen. Sorry I wasn't asked for a disk so I can't be much help here. I do know the crack is on tpb under Games>Mac if you need it."
,it4lian,2010-07-31T18:39Z,Anyone have any idea where the save files are located in the Mac? Many thanks in advance
,arsnic,2010-07-31T19:09Z,"Well most by default download to your Downloads directory. What torrent program are you using? uTorrent, Transmission, etc"
,arsnic,2010-07-31T21:11Z,"@it4lian

The save files are in your Documents folder under the Blizzard folder."

,luc1992,2010-08-01T05:53Z,"so i have tried to apply the patch (by following the instructions mind you) and i cannot get it to work. First of all even though the version appears to be the base15405 the instructions call for, there is no battle.net-patch.mpq. i can only find a battle.net.mpq file in the battle.net folder. 
so i try to replace that one and when i launch the game it tells me some files are missing and apple gives me an error message about compatibility. 
i am running snow leopard on a core I5 macbook pro. 
if someone who got it to work could post up some more detailed instructions i would be very thankful.
Also i have downloaded the game from here, the one that appears at the top of the ""top 100"" mac game torrents.
thanks again.  
(P.S i have been seeding for the past hour or so since my download completed and i see that the number of seeders has increased considerably and so has the number of completed downloads, i would like to think that i participated somewhat to this :P) "

,Tam-Linn,2010-08-01T07:17Z,"@iSkepsis,

step by step,
1)downloaded game 2) applied the ""sudo chmod -R 755 ./SC2-WingsOfLiberty-enUS-Installer"" thing in the terminal. 3) opened installer while connected to internet, then disconnected to run installation. 4) reconnected and tried to apply patch/ was told my Starcraft Editor glshadercompiler hash didnt match up 5) tried applying crack but there was no battle.net-patch.mpq to replace as instructed by the crack
6) tried relaunching and reapplying patch but got same message.

all this on a 13' mac 2.26 core dua with 4 gb memory and a geforce 9400m

having uploaded 60 gigs im hoping to get this working"

,luc1992,2010-08-01T07:20Z,"ok so i solved the problem, what i did was reinstalled but let it patch completely at the end of the installation (let it patch up until you can click play on the launcher) once that is done apply the patch as per the instructions and voila! i was able to play the first 2 missions no problem, but like everyone else, even if i saved the game manually i cannot come back to it once i exit the game. hope someone will find the solution to this soon enough!"

I click the installer and nothing happens.

I've tried every combination with the terminal.

,b3rx,2010-08-01T14:09Z,"@luc1992: I was able to get to the 3rd mission. Here are my steps.

1. Saved from mission 3.
2. Quit the game.
3. Start SC2.
4. Start Campaign.
5. Go to menu and click on load."
,luc1992,2010-08-01T14:23Z,"@b3rx - wow thanks, i had not thought of that. looks like you are one of the few, if not the only one that has discovered a workaround for that! 
I started a new campaign and than from the menu on mission 1 loaded my previous saved game and it worked like a charm! Granted you need to load the first mission every time you want to play but thats not to bad!
thanks!!"
,R.Deckard,2010-08-01T14:53Z,"There is a way to load a saved campaign, i found a way around this...you just gotta advance in a campaign and normally save it. then when you load, start a new campaign game, and from the first mission battle map (in-game) select load, and load the campaign from there you've saved. Takes a bit of time, but works."
,b3rx,2010-08-01T15:19Z,"@luc1992: no problem. its just a workaround though. would enjoy not to have to reload mission one just to be able to load my save file.

just here to help."
,arsnic,2010-08-01T16:10Z,"Ok, to explain a bit, the cd command causes terminal to change directories, so if your SC2-blah folder is on the desktop you type:

cd ~/Desktop

if in downloads type

cd ~/Downloads

Second as I posted before this is just the legit installer directly from battle.net. I bought the game so I have no idea what problems you could face with the crack.

Lastly, yes you can transfer games load old games just place them in your Documents>Blizzard>StarCraft II folder. And once I quit while playing a campaign and upon starting again it automatically loaded and once it didn't I think it's something they need to work on but it will only load if the game had saved prior.

Happy seeding, happy playing. Well worth the $60 bucks."

,the_modem,2010-08-02T06:39Z,"heres what I've been able to get out of the comments

open up terminal, Applications > Utilities
type 
cd [Download Directory]

This means if you have utorrent or whatever set to download to your Downloads folder you would type:

cd ~/Downloads

Next type:

sudo chmod -R 755 ./SC2-WingsOfLiberty-enUS-Installer

a password entry will appear, type in your password, you wont see it, then press enter

This should change the ownership of the files on your computer to your account allowing you to run the file.

now keep your internet on during the entire installation, get the patch at the end, then wait for it to be 100% done and click play.

you will reach the menu but you still have to login to battle.net so quit the game

download the mac crack
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5726851/StarCraft2_[k]_by_zeorge_008.dmg

then go into the folder with starcraft II in your applications

go into the battle.net folder and replace the Battle.net-patch.MPQ with the one in the patch

then go back to the starcraft II folder > Versions > Base15405 and then replace the SC2 file with the one in the crack.

then start star craft II again. This is an amazing game after I finally got it working, totally worth the trouble."
,jisor,2010-08-02T09:28Z,"the_modem: Good summary. 
However, there are still a few bugs with the crack.
1. I have to totally disable the internetconnection to get the game running. Tried blocking the app with Little Snitch, but the patcher launched anyway, gave an errormessage about the patch, and then exited.
2. You have to start a new campaign to be able to load the game. Not the best solution maybe... ;-)

Hoping for a better crack soon.
