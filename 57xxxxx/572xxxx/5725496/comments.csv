,Mr_Echoo,2010-07-30T16:30Z,"You know, it's not like the games are expensive at GOG.com (most cost $5.99), so you might as well buy them from there and get a quick and stable download..."
,kowalump9,2010-07-31T00:21Z,So what? It's more expensive than downloading and burning on DVD's ; ) In GOG.COM some games were too expensive than they worth.

,Tarmaren,2010-08-01T03:45Z,"I'm usually all for sharing things that doesn't really have a reason to not be free but GOG is the exception.

One of the reasons is that what they are doing is actually working for the demise of DRM. They've shown that No DRM is a strong selling argument and have got many customers because of it.
So as a pirate you're shooting yourself in the foot."
,Rondelek,2010-08-01T16:31Z,Every single installer gives me alerts from my anti-virus software. After installation of Gorky 17 porn advertisements started appearing on my desktop. FUCK YOU.
,reloadro,2010-08-03T13:58Z,"Any seeds for this ? No one finished ? I'm in need only for the septerra patch , Ive got the original CD , but it seems valkyrie studio dropped support for this game and doesn't have a patch for the audio skip in windows 7. "
,sn34k3rs,2010-09-19T18:54Z,"Well, at this point, the only way to get GOG's games, as I also would support someone distributing games like they do, is via torrents and sharing with friends, since they are shut down as of today."
,blackpantha,2010-09-27T01:36Z,"I did my best to download the games from other torrents and add em into this one. Got us to 66.7% I will continue to try to hunt them down and see if we can get all the way, please do the same if able. :D"

,Sh1ka,2011-02-12T16:41Z,Are these files clean?
,Jakkal666,2011-04-14T20:40Z,"A couple of the games are just a few megabytes in size, it's probably a bullshit-torrent full of malware, viruses and what not.."
