Ive tryed all the methods but i cant get it to work!
@StudentGR
Strange did you used the fix too?
If yes reinstall and apply only this update!
the fix fixes only the language selector so it is not very important :D"

Thats true that saved games from previous version dont work.

PS. thanks for this update and keep it going =)"
