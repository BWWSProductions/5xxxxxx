[T],xxThugxx,2010-08-01T14:23Z,"did you copy the folder called gangstar to sd/gameloft/games? if not you can donwload it the normal way off gamelofts servers, just make sure you have your device in aeroplane mode when you launch the game, it will then ask you to activate either wifi or 3g, click the one you want and wait for the download to complete "
,bdp2166,2010-08-10T08:35Z,"dl and install worked fine but in-game many textures are whited out, buildings and my character"
,doggywuff12345,2010-10-05T12:32Z,"same as above, many textures including the character are whited out. I'm running Android 2.1 on a samsung galxy s."
,gxe16,2010-12-05T15:27Z,The same. Im running Android 2.1 on Sony Ericsson xperia x10i
,ShapeBox,2010-12-18T21:49Z,"Awesome!! Thanks, THUG. Those having problems, you need Android 2.2 for this to work properly.

I have this on Desire with Android 2.2, works flawlessly.

Gameloft made a mistake not bringing this out in the UK. This is the only way I can get it. :]

Thanks again."
,cuteboyshash,2011-01-08T00:50Z,"hey xxThugxx

thanks for all your android posts.

i have installed gangstar and followed the install instructions, still when i start the game in airplane mode, it asks for download either from wi fi or 3g.

do i need to install the data via 3g?

please let me know.

thanks a lot. :))"
