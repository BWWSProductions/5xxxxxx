Here are the first 4 videos from Saaya Irie. They are in flash format.  They are ripped from a fan site that put up the full DVDs in flash. They range from about 45 to 55 minutes long with the exception of "Bloom" A video put out when she was about 15 years old. (I Believe)

The first 2 videos had no name, just numbers...

001
002

The came...

Little Legend    and then...
Bloom

I adding a short internet extra that coincided with her age around the 4th video.

Convert them yourselves. I recommend ConvertXtoDVD. Put the first 2 videos on one disk and the videos 3 and 4 plus extra on the second. That's my take on it anyway. 

Enjoy, seed, and DON'T bitch. Go to Ebay if you have a problem. 

The other 5 videos are available for a total of 9.
