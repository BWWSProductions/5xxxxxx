,biglittle1,2010-08-24T18:08Z,The picture quality is great. I have a WD TV Live media player hooked up to my hard drive and I am not getting any sound though. It's showing DTS sound in the info on the media player but nothing.

I haven't downloaded the movie but if the format is MKV, try the freeware ""mkv2vob"" to convert file. In Configuration, ""Always Transcode DTS"". If the file is more than 4GB, have File Splitting = FAT 32.

@makyura

Download VLC Player"

In order to hear DTS/DTS-HD/DTS-HDMA audio tracks you need to connect your WD TV Live media player to a DTS-capable amplifier or receiver with an optical digital (Toslink) cable. Then DTS sound comes out loud and clear through your 5/6/7.1 speaker system."

,jerome_o13,2011-02-23T02:55Z,can this video be converted to any other formats?? or is it executable on VLC either??
,lattari,2012-03-12T19:05Z,Just get VLC and hook a HDMI cable to Tv and voila
