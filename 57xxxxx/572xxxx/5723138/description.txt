Full of scatological humor, this unrated comic romp stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as the dim-bulb title characters who get more than they bargained for when they try to return a briefcase left at the airport by socialite Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly). Unaware that the case is crammed with cash intended for the baddies who abducted Mary's husband, the two cretins set out on a cross-country trip to find her -- with the kidnappers not far behind. (Unrated Version)
