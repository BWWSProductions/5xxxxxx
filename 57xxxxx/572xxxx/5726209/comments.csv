,highlander777,2010-07-30T08:00Z,What is this? The link is to The Biggest Loser and the summary sounds like American Idol. What show is this?
,tripper511,2010-07-30T20:18Z,"Here's the IMDB link for the show: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666667/
 It just came out, it's with Life Coach Guru Anthony Robbins."
,semprini,2010-07-30T23:52Z,"This is the real deal.  Ignore that it says ""the biggest loser"" in the description, it's the first episode of Tony Robbins' new show."
,StOrMbEaR,2010-10-14T22:33Z,"Thank you, this is great!
It's been a long time since I could enjoy an American reality show.
When comes the next episode?"
