This is a direct DVD rip of Kung Fu Panda in Google's new open-source WebM format.

**************************
*** BIG FAT DISCLAIMER ***
**************************

WEBM IS A VERY NEW CODEC. THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WHATEVER SOFTWARE YOU USE TO PLAY MOVIES DOES NOT YET SUPPORT IT.

More info here:
www.webmproject.org/

If you're on Windows, you will need to download the DirectShow filter to enable playback in Windows Media Player:
 
http://code.google.com/p/webm/downloads/list

Alternatively, a development build of VLC will play it (on any OS).

The current nightly build of Chromium (Google Chome dev build) plays the video fine, but trips up heavily on the 6 channel audio.

**************************

Why am I uploading this?: There's currently NO WebM content on TPB, and I thought it needed some. 

Why Kung Fu Panda?: This was ripped primarily to demonstrate the codec, and it's the first DVD I picked up that had a progressive scan video track, and the audio didn't require amplification. It seemed good for the purpose of demonstrating what you can cram into a CD-R with WebM.

Why WebM?: It's the new HTML5 standard codec. It has no patent restrictions, or any restrictions at all for that matter.
