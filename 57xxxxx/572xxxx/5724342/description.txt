This unspectacular episode has several famous 
and familiar guest stars from that era.

Character actor Frank Overton gave one of his 
final performances (as Sam Atkins) before his 
death in April 1967. Frank was also seen in 
episodes of BONANZA and Star Trek around that 
time. According to the IMDB he was only 47, 
but he looked much older.

His two sexy blonde daughters were played by 
Lynda Day George (as Judy) and Carole Wells (as Kathy).

Former "Laramie" and "Wagon Train" regular 
Robert Fuller plays Kathy's husband Clint.

Jocelyn Brando (Marlon's gray-haired  older 
sister) appears as Ida Martin -- the widow 
of Trampas' friend, who was killed.

The new old man in Ida's life is played by 
Russell Thorson.

Kent McCord, who would soon co-star for many 
years on the "Adam 12" police drama, is one of the miners.

And finally there's the sheriff, played by Phillip Pine.
