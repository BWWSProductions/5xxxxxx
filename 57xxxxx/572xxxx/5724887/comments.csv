I really want to watch this."
,gurubai,2010-08-11T08:22Z,have patience. i am seeding more than 50 person at a time.
,muzm_an,2010-08-12T14:40Z,"gurubai,

I appreciate your efforts, but it would be nice if those 50+ people would increase their upload bandwidths.

I am on a 100 MBit line here, and all I am getting is 0.3 kB/s download while doing minimum of 150 KB/s upload.

BTW, why is there 0 seeders if *you* re seeding."
,gurubai,2010-08-12T15:06Z,"@muzm_an,
I agree with you. It would be better if they increase their upload bandwidth.

I don't know why its showing 0 seeders. but I;m still seeding."
,SOLOinc,2010-08-13T04:04Z,"Does anyone know if this can be played on something like the Dune HD 3.0? I know that can play BD ISOs, but I don't know what kind of format this torrent is in. Thanks!"
,gurubai,2010-08-13T05:09Z,"use ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 3 to play it.

,StormnHunt,2010-08-28T19:57Z,"It works great, if you have a 120HZ tv with a graphics card that supports 120HZ and and 1080p, when using Arcsoft this looks better than any other bluray I've ever seen, in my opinion."
,roryt,2010-09-10T11:16Z,"why are there over a 1000 files in this torrent? I've always dl'ed the 6-10gb size 108-p bluray rips but am interested in trying out one of these ""TRUE"" bluray rips to see how much better it really is. 

with all these files though, is there some obstacles to get through just to play the thing? I just want to put it on my external HDD and play it on my tv thru my media player. I see people mention things like ""arcsoft total media player"" which I have never heard of..."
,vermin,2010-10-09T13:37Z,"""arcsoft total media player"" which I have never heard of... . 
Then you Google and learn basic info about 'how to play bluray discs' before spamming like an infant. "
