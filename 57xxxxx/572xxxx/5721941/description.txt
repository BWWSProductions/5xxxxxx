           The town of Westbrick is a rough place to live in. It is       
           here that the young rookie cop Matthew lives with his          
           wife. Meanwhile, notorious serial killers Billy and            
           Barbara embark on a killing spree in order to get              
           notoriety. Matthew gets his first assignment with his          
           much older partner William when he unfortunately crosses       
           paths with Billy and Barbara. William gets killed in the       
           line of duty by Billy and Barbara but that's not enough        
           for them: they torture and brutally murder Matthew's           
           wife. Things get even worse for young Matthew when he          
           loses his job, being wrongfully blamed for William's           
           death and now charged with murder. Matthew finds himself       
           isolated; there is no reason to count on a corrupt legal       
           system and even less of a chance of being found innocent.      
           He goes on a rampage for vengeance and slowly turns into       
           a mad psychopath just like Billy and Barbara.
