Music : Classical : MP3/Variable


This is a very expressive and colorful, but not overstated recording
. I picked it up a number of years not knowing anything about the performer, but it was the only complete recording in the store at the time. I was impressed the first time I played it, but since then, my enthusuasm grows for it every time I hear it. Only later did I learn that in addition to being Antal Dorati's widow, that she has recorded all of Haydn's piano works and just a few other albums--I will surely be on the lookout for them. I only wish she had recorded more widely.
