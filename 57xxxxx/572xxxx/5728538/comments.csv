,gadriam,2010-07-31T09:49Z,"It's the first eztv failure i've seen, but it doesn't change the fact that it's irrevocably broken. Still no fake, though. It just doesn't work."
,highlander777,2010-07-31T12:10Z,This is a partial video of the episode. I was wondering why the file size was so small.
,mykbyts,2010-07-31T15:08Z,This doesn't even play. VLC plays it but everything else says its corrupt and it doesn't play the whole episode...
,GungaDan,2010-08-02T18:16Z,It has some serious encoding problems and then just chops off at about 26 minutes. :(
,Bluetack,2010-08-04T08:41Z,"TPB staff are still not sure whether to keep this damaged file because it's not technically a fake.

The people at EZTV however, have already replaced it, calling it a ""Rel2"":

FQM also has a good one:
