,TheReborn16,2011-05-06T03:27Z,"A: -10 (audio doesnt even match the people talking and not even good timing with the movement of there mouths, it looks like there lip syncing)
V: 9"
,Valor958,2011-05-09T04:17Z,"An MKV file is a Matroska video file which is just another video file format. You may need to download a different video codec to play it but it works fine. VLC player is a great player that I have never needed to update additional codecs for, and many highly recommend it. IF you want a codec pack, try http://www.cccp-project.net/ , the Combined Community Codec Pack. It's great and last time i had to dl it, it came with an assortment of players as well. 

As for the 'lip syncing'... this is a dub of a Swedish film so things won't be perfect. If you don't like reading along with the speaking, then settle for the dub."

great looking movie and  very small file

this is  dubbed into english and is the original swedish version

i found the properly synced subtitles at subscene  for this  movie,, so just read the subtitles and dont look too much at their mouths moving and youll be fine

thanks for the time and effort  for the torrent"
,masterpiece007,2012-06-22T07:42Z,Not YIFY. Anyways better than the English version. :) A=9 V=7
