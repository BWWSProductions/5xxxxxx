,OmniNegro,2010-07-28T22:37Z,"1. Unrar.
2. Burn or mount the image.
3. Install the game. When the game is installed in offline mode, a message 
   will be displayed that you need to be online. Click the orange button to 
   enter a media key: G8MN8UDG6NA2ANGY6A3DNY82HRGF29ZH.
   If you have an internet connection enabled during setup, at the end of 
   the setup, the autoupdate starts, close the autoupdate window.
4. Copy over the update files (ONLY ""updates"" dir and ""update.bat"" file)
   to the install dir
5. copy Blizzard Updater.exe from the iso folder Crack\Support to your install directory StarCraft II\Support and run update.bat.
6. Copy over the cracked content (""Battle.net"", ""Support"", ""Versions"" dirs
   and ""StarCraft II.exe"" file) to the install dir. "

,Rogue2529,2010-07-30T13:11Z,"I have great news for who can't install StarCraft 2 because some shits of these error [can't find, dirty, corrupt etc.]

First, excuse my English because English is not my first language! Thank you.
Second, make sure your StarCraft 2 is ""Complete"" not some crap like ""Digital Download"" or something like that!

So here very very simple steps from me, IT IS YOUR OVERCLOCK! yes! overclock!

1. Go to your BIOS setup
2. load default setup to reset every OC values in your BIOS, especially MEMORY [Ram] must reset to default settings!
3. Save and Exit
4. Wait until your Windows boost up
5. Run StarCraft 2 Installer again and Vivo la!!!!! ITS INSTALLER NOW WORK LIKE CHARM!!!! YEAHHHHH!!!

for some reason, Bilzzard Installer are crap or something because its can't catch up my CPU and RAM overclocked so its failure to installation...

NOTE 1: this tips work for peoples who loved to overclock your PC by pushing hard CPU and RAM! so you need to reset them to default values first. When your installation is completed, just back to BIOS and set your OC again to maximize your performance of PC!
NOTE 2: for peoples who didn't OC, just try my tips to see if this work for you :) try to reset your RAM timing and clock would helps you
Enjoy!"
,jonique,2010-07-31T05:13Z,"For those who have Installation problem/error (MOUNTING tru PowerISO/Daemon) Pls follow my intsructions:
1. Unrar SCII files to your desired place.
2. DON'T Mount, Just open the ISO file using Daemon or Power iso.
3. EXTRACT the files to your desired place.
4. Voila.. You can now run SCII Exe without errors!

Cheers to Reloaded and to the Uploader!

BTW.. Rogue don't confuse people.. OC'ing doesn't fix software errors. IT CAN only enhance your gaming exp. but doesnt resolve errors."

,iagolima,2010-07-31T20:13Z,there is a way to play on skirmish on this version. it's a little complicated but worked perfectly for me: http://www.warezshares.com/index.php?/topic/94742-skirmish-vs-ai-using-starcraftiiwingsofliberty-reloaded/
,iagolima,2010-07-31T20:16Z,"differently for other ways, you can also select the difficulty with this."
,cracksmoker,2010-08-02T05:28Z,"LOL, game works fine for me.  And its awesome.  If it makes you whiny bitches feel better, go ahead and talk shit about a game you can't even play."
,SaudiHasim,2010-08-02T19:17Z,"i downloaded it at 1mb/sec 

after installing this game i did put bettle.net patch in battle net 
and sc2 in base 15405

pressed sctart craft exe and got screen sort of screen saver no buttons etc just a cursor.

dont know what happen 

any advice?"
,copyofnight,2010-08-12T13:07Z,"IF YOU GET AN ERROR: ""There is no patch file to apply"" there is way around, you did nothing wrong it's seems there are different versions of Blizzard Updater.exe

FIX: Go to CRACK Support folder and copy Blizzard Updater.exe to your game Support folder and overwrite the old one. Now if you start Update_RU.bat it will work!"
,aand,2010-09-03T00:34Z,"1. Install the game from the ISO. At the end DO NOT PRESS ""NEXT""!!! (press [x] to exit, so you'll bypass update)

2. Working campaign crack:
