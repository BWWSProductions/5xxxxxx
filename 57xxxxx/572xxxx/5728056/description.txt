C E L E S T E
- (1976) Principe Di Un Giorno -

Celeste means heavenly, according to the music they play. The pastoral mood sometimes reminds me a bit of Trespass from Genesis. Very calm, tranquil and pleasing music at the risk of falling asleep before reaching the end of the record. Nevertheless, 'P.d.u.g.' is without fail an excellent album. Released in 1976, it had been recorded two years before, as the instrumentation (in '76 mellotron was dead) already suggests.
