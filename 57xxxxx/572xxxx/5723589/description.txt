Pulse is a live double album by Pink Floyd, released through EMI Records on 29 May 1995, in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records on 6 June 1995, in the United States, containing songs from their albums.

The album was recorded during the band's Division Bell tour in 1994, specifically the UK and European leg, which ran from July to October 1994 . The tour was sponsored in Europe by Volkswagen, which also issued a commemorative version of its top-selling car, the Golf Pink Floyd, one of which was given as a prize at each concert. It was a standard Golf with Pink Floyd decals and a premium stereo, although it had Volkswagen's most environmentally friendly engine, at Gilmour's insistence.
