[V],jainmehul,2010-07-29T08:49Z,BRip in 300 mbs??...is it that you ripped this from a bluray disc??bcoz the resolution is not of a blu ray
[V],MKVGuy,2010-07-29T09:38Z,"when we say DVDrip it means the source is a original DVD, when we say BDRip it means the source is a Blue-ray disc but when we say BRRip this means the source is a BDRip/BRRip which is being re-encoded.. about the resolution, I am not saying its 720p rip who's resolution is like 1280:xxx, hope it clears all your doubts about the title of the rip and the resolution thing attached to it..
guys please correct me if I am wrong.."
