,JesMe247,2010-07-30T13:14Z,Hi mate----It would be nice if you at least included a preview with your themes.
,jblack110,2010-07-30T16:12Z,There is a ScreenShot Folder that you can download to preview the theme
,rastas959,2010-08-02T14:14Z,wouldn't it just be easier to up a screenshot to your torrent so we can view it before we dl anything!
,jblack110,2010-08-14T20:27Z,"everytime i post the links to the screenshots they never show up.  so i got tired of dealing with it.  now i just include a screenshots folder for the preview.  If TPB was so anal and allowed tags like [img][/img] like most torrent sites on the net you would be able to see the preview up front.  But since they don't I have to do it this way.  You could also visit 1337x, since that is where I always post first"
