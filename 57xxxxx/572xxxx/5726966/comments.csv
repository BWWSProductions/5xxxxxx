,Tleilaxu7,2010-09-29T11:29Z,"great download thanks, just one question i installed the crack and it shows that it is registered, but when i go to start a one player solitare game it tell me that the program has to be registared to change the opponents deck, and also how do u play online against other people, it keeps asking me for a username and password"
,svinotd,2011-02-07T22:37Z,Well hello. i've just registred the first time for few years using the pirate bay just for say that i thank you for this thread. MWS was always hard to keep up to date for me so i left MtG and i hope i'll connect back to this gorgeous game.

Why not instead let this fine work stand for itself, instead of trying to use it as a platform to fuck others over?"
,Mr_n_MrsDreadJonny,2011-03-01T10:39Z,"once im done Removing infections and repairing any ( if there are any) damaged files, i intend to repost ( with all credit for the hard work of collection to go to InternetNinjacy ) and add card set updates current as of 1/31/11......this may take some time to do as i am not so nearly skilled at making these things work nicely like internetninjacy is but give a brother a few and well finish this right"
