2012 - In an increasingly uncertain defence environment, a deadly new arms race has begun. In an attempt to secure her boundaries, Britain has deployed the very latest sub-sea military technology.

Beneath and beyond the front line, these are the adventures of the HMS Goliath. A 55,000 tonne M-Class nuclear stealth submarine, prowling 5,000 metres below the surface. Manned by idiots.

The idiots in question consist of lunch-loving Captain Paul Wade, old school Commander Alison Fairbanks and the frustrated Lieutenant Jack Trainor (pronounced "Tren-oor").


www.comedy.org.uk Review: 
[quote]An interesting series which has its peaks and troughs. The show contains good ideas and parodies, however we found the distinction between some of the characters' voices confusing (which may explain why one of the characters was replaced between series). Also, the recurring joke about Trainor's name does get a tad tedious after a while.[/quote]

A third series of six episodes is being made.
