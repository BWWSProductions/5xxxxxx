,garbagedrew,2010-09-24T20:52Z,Don't waste your time. I have never had so many problems with a video file before. The only player that works is VLC player and even then several parts are horribly blurred. I recommend downloading a better quality version encoded with a more compatible codec. Nice attempt but this download is unsuable for me.
,Scary B,2010-10-10T22:07Z,"I just confirmed playback with Media Player Classic, Divx plus player, VLC player, Windows Media player, and even Cyberlink PowerDVD. The quality is great throughout considering it's only 650kbps. I can only assume the person with the problem does not understand what is needed for MKV/H.264 playback.
I prefer Media Player Classic home cinema edition, and use the K-lite codec pack.

I am guessing the many hundreds/thousands of other people that have downloaded this are happy with the quality and h.264/mkv format."
