,imunionjack,2010-12-17T10:38Z,Ta muchly for these. I have all of his books and all very dog eared. I used to commute on the train for a long time an hour each morning at 6am and read them on the way to work. ASitting with all the suited snobs reading their times newspapers and Id be pissing myself laughing at how descriptive his books are. One of our best authors IMHO
