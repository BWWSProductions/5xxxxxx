Too switched; those who rely on a foreign language subtitle might get confused unless the translator is really very very good.
The movie certainly doesn't deserve more then a 6* in my opinion.
The rip I find way too big for the quality (pretty much pixelation flickering through the whole movie) on a big 1080p TV. I seeded over 8.0 Ratio then deleted the file, I wasn't impressed about the movie at all.
If you're very fond of Julianne Moore you must see:
Blindness (2008)(HD-1080p x264 5.1 BDRip) Eng Ger multisub

The movie is a lot more interesting and the picture is stunning even though File size is 5.74 GiB for a 2Hours movie.
