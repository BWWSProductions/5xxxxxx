Markets! Finance! Scandal! Movies!

Max and Stacy look at the latest scandals of the enemies of box-office futures, the octogenarian issuing threats and Goldman: the Movie, starring Divine? Or Tony Blair? 

In the second half of the show, Max talks to fund manager Michael Krieger about the dangers of a failed presidency.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
