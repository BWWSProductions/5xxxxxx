For decades, theories and controversies have swirled around the question of the true
origins of the Dead Sea Scrolls -- one of the greatest archaeological finds in history. 
We'll go beyond enclosed glass displays to examine actual scroll fragments up close 
and explore the caves where they were found. Then, we'll examine a new clue to the 
identity of the scrolls' writers -- a 2,000-year-old cup inscribed with a secret text. 
Could analysis of this finding unravel the mystery?
