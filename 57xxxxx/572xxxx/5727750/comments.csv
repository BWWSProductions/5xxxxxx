,Krypten,2010-08-10T11:25Z,Yeah. Norton 360 reports the keygen as a trojan horse. I do not recommend using the keygen in this torrent.
,kraziaznvtboi,2010-08-12T10:06Z,"Do some background research before you make empty accusations.

Scanning any kind of keygen will yield some kind of result. It's called heuristics, look it up.

If you want solid answers, look on the uploaders psttorrents and see his comments instead of using some crappy AV to spoon feed you the answers.

Anyways, works great and thanks a lot carter67.

File is just a false positive and if you don't believe it, fine. go download it somewhere else."
,cz-aldaris,2010-08-17T16:37Z,"Works fine, thank you."
,rfella,2010-09-04T20:59Z,"Thank you for the trouble in making this .

,jdperez2003,2010-09-10T09:51Z,"hi

[T],carter67,2010-10-26T00:22Z,"Right guys lets get 1 thing straight, I bring all sorts of potential risks to myself uploading SAFE software for you guys to download and use, if your av scanners flags a keygens/crack as a virus Firstly you should be thinking Hmmmmm STRANGE why would a guy with a pink skull get away with uploading a virus,  Then secondly your thought pattern should now be Right, this doesn't make sense!! Perhaps you should then investigate why this is happening, and you would then discover that keygens/cracks are of a similar type of programming to real viruses  and your shitty A/V software is that poor it can't tell the difference....INSTEAD YOU ALL RUN AROUND SHOUTING FIRE FIRE FIRE RUN RUN RUN WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!!! oh well nevermind just a thought. PERHAPS ALL YOU NOOBS SHOULD JUST STAY AWAY FROM MY UPLOADS THEN NONE OF THIS WOULD MATTER. ;)"
,theoriginalphantom,2010-11-09T00:16Z,"@carter67
Well said mate. Have had a few of your uploads and never had a problem. Can understand those that get the AV warnings being a bit worried but really cant work out why they dont do some homework and learn something about this sort of thing.
Anyhow, many thanks for this."
,globalpuffer,2010-11-30T06:56Z,"Has anyone noticed how it's aways the crappy AV's like NORTON that say the ""Keygen is a Trojan - run away run away!""?  I suppose if someone is dumb enought to use, trust and pay for - Norton - then they are dumb enough to avoid clean free software and have AV that consistantly fails when a real virus sneaks in."
,globalpuffer,2010-11-30T11:37Z,"Oh, and uh, no virus/trojan, scanned with Avast Version 5.0.677 using virus definition 101129-1.  The keygen works like a charm.. Thank you!"
