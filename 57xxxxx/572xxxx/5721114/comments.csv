,TheEmpathicEar,2010-07-28T13:39Z,"I am sorry. In my haste to upload this, I forgot to check the HD/Blu-Ray settings.

This is NOT an HD/Blu-Ray key!

Again, I am sorry."
,brianxxx,2010-07-28T15:39Z,That's ok by me. I don't have Blu Ray!!!!!! lol

Thanks for your help!"
,mikemp3,2010-07-30T11:13Z,Yes it installs and registers just fine but like most other cracks for the lastest AnyDVD versions it has an error when scanning a DVD and therefore is its no good.
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-07-30T16:53Z,"@mikemp3

Did you reboot your PC after finishing the install? Also, rebooting sometimes clears these errors anyway."
,mikemp3,2010-07-31T23:25Z,"@TheEmpathicEar
Yes its been days since I installed this copy and many reboots. By the way its not just this torrent its most of the recent versions I have got hold of, from any where. I will just have go back to a working 6660 version that does work. Try it on something like ""Hurt Locker"" and you will see what I mean. I am on WIN7 64"
,jameskrueger3rd,2010-08-01T01:00Z,"@mikemp3
Any cracks, exe's, ""silent installations"" are likely to mess up your program and later updates. 

With AnyDVD use clean keys only. Cracks and exe's are worthless and often block later updates.

,mikemp3,2010-08-01T23:28Z,"@jameskrueger3rd when do you know that a Registration Key is not clean, I havent seen (or used) a fixed exe for Any DVD yet. They always look just like this one ""click to change the reg flie"". As I can (and now am) use a previous version 6660, I just assumed that that one (6660) was either fixed properly or AnyDVD has booby trapped recent releases. "
,mikemp3,2010-08-01T23:29Z,"If you can get this version to work with DVD,s can you tell me the best way to clean my system for this one to function. I dont want to reinstall every time AnyDVD have an update though. This one installs and registars just fine but fails to work with  a DVD just an error page : ""clean disk , faulty disk, region not set page."""
,mikemp3,2010-08-01T23:46Z,Sorry my reply comment keep getting deleted.
,dot.pic,2010-08-07T11:51Z,It DID NOT WORK due to new secure mechanisms by Slysoft...
,RR92,2010-09-03T05:11Z,"Worked for me, thank you for the upload. I followed these steps:

1. Removed previous AnyDVD and the registration information
2. Rebooted
3. Installed new AnyDVD
4. Copied reg file to install dir, executed
5. Rebooted"
,Angel1st,2011-11-03T11:59Z,"I have tried the step by step as show on comment here and on the info and nothing worked. I'm still with my old version before this version. What you need is a ""Patch"". Just like the one I've got is a patch that patches up the AnyDVDTray in order to make it ""full version""...it's the only way I know it works..."
