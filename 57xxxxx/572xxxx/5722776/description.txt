Yo Frankie [Game MultiOS - Eng][TNTVillage]

Yo Frankie! (code-named Apricot) is an open video game made by the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation, originally scheduled for release in August 2008. It is based on the universe and characters of the free film produced earlier in 2008 by the Blender Institute, Big Buck Bunny. Like the Blender Institute's previous open film projects, the game is made using free software. Yo Frankie! runs on any platform which runs Blender and Crystal Space, including GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.
