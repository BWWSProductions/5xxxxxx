PETER JACKSON As Canadians continue to push the idea that Hip Hop isn't
dead...It lives in the North. As Canadians continue to push the idea
that Hip Hop isn't dead...It lives in the North
Peter Jackson always believed that Hip Hop was his life and was
determined to convince other to believe in his dream as much as he did
Jackson knew that if he was to survive in this industry he was going to
have to take to the pavement himself to make it happen. Today he is not
just an artist who has recorded hundreds of songs, or toured as the
supporting artist for legendary rappers, he also boasts a promotions
company and a clothing line. Peter Jackson and his team 90Nickel are not
just a group of rapper they are a local Hip-Hop franchise

Peter Jackson has appeared on over 50 mixed tapes in North America
working with names such as, DJ Rated R, Potent Product, DJ Diggz, DJ
Dollah , and more. He released his own mixed tape titled, Business as
Usual hosted by DJ G-Spot of Shadyville DJ fame in 2007. Jackson quickly
followed it up with two more compilations, Fly Society, featuring fellow
90Nickle member, and Hustler's Tears, both hosted by DJ Bedz, the Denver
Nuggets official DJ, and Denver, Colorados Shadyville DJ. In 2008,
Jackson began working with executive producer Sheldon Moore, who has
years of experience working with artists such as Citizen Kaine, K-OS,
Big Pun, Jahiem. Together they produced and released Peter Jackson's
first EP titled, The Introduction, with features from Jmore, Emmerson
Just Brooks, Toya Lexus and Royce da 5'9. The first single from the EP,
Come on Over, featuring Jmore is currently receiving radio rotation
across Canada after being picked up by Toronto's Flow 93.5 FM

This young artist is tenacious and determined. His lyrics are insightful
and he is willing to challenge the boundaries of the Rap and Hip Hop
industry we know today. At times his rhymes are hard and unapologetic,
but he can also captivate a club with a beat and an unforgettable hook
