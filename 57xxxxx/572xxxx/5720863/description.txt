As Maya Angelou narrates this powerful documentary, she
reveals the story of a brave group of people who fought
Hitler with the only weapons they had: charcoal, pencil
stubs, shreds of paper and memories etched in their
minds. These artists took their fate into their own hands
to make a compelling statement about the human spirit,
enduring against unimaginable odds.
