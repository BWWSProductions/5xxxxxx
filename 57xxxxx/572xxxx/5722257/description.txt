NOTE: If you saw this torrent posted before, it was an improper release.  It was missing an episode in season 2.  The download speeds were also off.  There were too many things wrong with it, so I decided to re-release it.  I apologize to anyone who tried to download the previous one.  Now, with that said...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a high quality, full resolution (unlike other torrent out there), high profile h264, dvd rip of the Comedy Central, Adult Swim t.v. series "Home Movies".  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on my 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.

Some of the files are slightly large for a 1/2 hour show, however the extra Director's Commentary audio tracks take up a little extra space.  The size is still quite reasonable for a complete series.

Average file size: Season 1: 225mb - 250mb

Container: MKV
Video: x264 - High Profile Settings
Resolution: 720 x 480

Audio 1: English, AAC Dolby Pro Logic II
Audio 2: English Director's Commentary, AAC Dolby Pro Logic II

Note: The extra Director's Commentary tracks are not included in every episode on the DVDs (and therefore not in the rips).  However, many of the files do include this extra track.

Hope you enjoy!!

Please comment if you like the quality so others can be assured to download.

Please seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!
