,OILFAN79,2010-09-15T05:08Z,"thanks alot, this show kicks the shit out of anything made by seth mcfarlane"
,JBirkenau,2010-10-03T22:50Z,"Excellent work.

All's great.  Seems the squigglevision made it tough to deinterlace/decomb (whatever you did) at certain points (not often or noticeable enough to avoid the files), so I don't fault you for that.  Just observing.

Thanks!  Will seed often."
,JBirkenau,2010-10-23T02:24Z,"I've uploaded enough to quit for a while without a guilty conscience.  Not many others care to seed.  Assholes.

Do you not realize how this shit works?  Here's a quick explanation:

Torrent is uploaded -> There is 1 seeder -> Leechers comes along -> They finish -> If the initial seeder must, he will quit seeding to work on other torrents -> Leechers must SEED or the torrent DIES.

You can find many torrents with an age of multiple years.  Have you ever downloaded any of those?  Without people SEEDING after LEECHING, you would not have been able.

As meech said: ""upload AT LEAST as much as you've downloaded.""  That is good advice.

I, however, upload as much as possible until I must focus on other things.  Now is the time I must leave.  Good luck.  Keep this wonderful torrent alive, please!  I will return when there are not any more seeds."
,pilotwings_64,2011-01-15T01:47Z,"are all of the audio commentaries available on the DVDs available on this torrent.  If so, I will seed 1/10."
[V],meech,2011-01-21T01:55Z,Yes...any commentaries that were on the dvd are in the files in this torrent.
,jerrydink,2011-02-16T01:04Z,Come on people...please seed!
,paperclipeo,2011-10-15T21:17Z,"If the quality is as good as I hope, I will seed indefinitely. Also I have stuff I forgot I even uploaded 3 years ago that are still being seeded. (changed computers and downloaded my own torrent because I had lost the files, and the speed was GREAT) So the system works, if everyone is on board and does their part. "
,Jason310M,2012-03-25T15:53Z,"Holy shit low seeders (3) but am getting 1.5 down, excellent torrent, will definitely be seeding too after finished. Thanks."
,chemdan,2012-04-30T21:30Z,"I just spent four days downloading this unwatchable mess. Any sort of on-screen motion results in a big nasty explosion of artifacts and blue flashing squares. Already tried with VLC, MPC, and WMP with all my codecs updated. If I wanted to see cool colors I'd get a kaleidoscope."
,You_Are_A_Pirate,2012-05-02T22:56Z,Took 1d 14h. Video looks nice and both audio tracks sound great. Thanks meech!
