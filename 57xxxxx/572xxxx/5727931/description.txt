The main goal of this project is simple: Just have an updated Ubuntu ready to install, with multimedia support and some cosmetic changes!

Ubuntu 32bit 10.04 fully updated, full compatibility, nothing in the main core is changed, so you can update normally

US English only (you can enable other keyboards and languages during/after installation)
All Gnome events sounds working!! (menus, pop-ups, windows open/close/maximize, etc...)
Some applications already installed, all free from repos
Samba already enabled, no need to download anything
Many tweaks 
Other repos can be enable in synaptic with just a click
