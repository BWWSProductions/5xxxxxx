----------------------------
29 July 2010. Wikileaks has added a very large new file to the Afghan War Diary [wikileaks.org[slant]wiki[slant]Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010]:

    Insurance file: 1.4 GB

    (SHA1: cce54d3a8af370213d23fcbfe8cddc8619a0734c) 

The file, ""insurance.aes256,"" is ten times the size of the seven other files combined. Appears to be encrypted with AES Crypt [www dot aescrypt dot com]. Wonder if it includes the 15,000 Afghan files withheld, or the original raw files, or perhaps much more, pre-positioned for public release (""insurance"") against an attack expected to come from DoD and Justice or parties unknown. A passphrase to be distributed or published widely in case of a takedown.

Anybody got a AES Crypto passphrase to share? Send PGP encrypted to: cryptome[at]earthlink dot net. Cryptome public key: cryptome dot org [slant] other-stuff dot htm#pk

,xxan,2010-11-27T11:20Z,"The novel phrase, ""history insurance,"" not heretofore advertized by Wikileaks, may refer to another Wikileaks protective measure or it may be a pointer, code word or passphrase, even one of the likely multi-level passphrases for the ""insurance.aes256"" file.

A search of torrents turned up a handful of hits on ""history insurance,"" but none appear to be related to recent actions of Wikileaks. However, shrewdly, Wikileaks could have pre-postioned a slew of protective measures before the bombshell campaign started, perhaps as early as the initiation of Wikileaks in late 2006 if not well before then by Assange and collaborators to create a secret ""historical"" air-gap between the measures and the public venture. These would be unveiled as necessary commensurate with threats unveiled, but never fully revealed despite rubber-hose interrogation -- ""rubber hose"" an Assange nick for an encryption program.

Assange and the security wizards advising Wikileaks are unusually gifted at long-range deception and protection, some sell those arcane and lucrative services to spies, governments, banks, businesses, billionaires and other criminal cartels -- and give freely to those targetted by highly-profitable and nutty secrecy peddlers. A few provide operational security for the Internet and digital communications and know their weaknesses and strengths, hideaways and byways for genuine and phony actionable intelligence, financial lawful and outlaw rings and where their dirty money is hidden. Yes, among them are ex-NSA officials and their exceptionally adept contract researchers as unbound by NDAs and secrecy agreements as Bradley Manning and others deeper inside not yet unveiled. What they know is what James Bamford in ""The Puzzle Palace"" (paper, p. 461) explores of the NSA dilemma of what to do with data gathered on corrupt officials in the US and elsewhere other than bury it as unminizable foreign intelligence despite pleas from law enforcement agencies.

No doubt when the password is revealed, the encryption method will be revealed too.
It could encrypted in AES256 and then Serpent and then Twofish, why not ?
Truecrypt offers this as an encryption cascade system.

And there is not the slightest chance of the password being guessable,
or all alphabetic, or all numeric, or all hexadecimal.
It will be a meaningless jumble of stuff with at least 2^256 possibilities."

Manning is accused of leaking unflattering information about the Afghanistan war to WikiLeaks, but hasn't been convicted of -- or even tried for -- any crime.
     Manning is being held at the U.S. Marine brig in Quantico, and according to Greenwald:

Manning has been subjected for many months without pause to inhumane, personality-erasing, soul-destroying, insanity-inducing conditions of isolation similar to those perfected at America's Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado:  all without so much as having been convicted of anything. 
     Torture is outrageous and un-American, demand fair treatment of Private Manning by going to the following URL :  

http://act.demandprogress.org/go/23?akid=45.326698.TIM73u&t=1

One day we're in the Middle East, next we're going to be in Asia, who know where else, this country's executive branch and legislative branches are out of control. The constitution protects US against the government, not the other way around. If we don't invade them physically, our crumbling economy will bring them down along with us. It doesn't matter the way we're heading this country won't be around another ten years. Look how Rome fell, their empire was too vast, spread too thin. They were so invested in living above their means while invading other empires and so focused on ""being the best, smartest, toughest, richest"". Look how they ended, their capitol was sacked and destroyed. Same thing will happen to us unless someone is willing to keep their asses (the government) in check. And I'm a liberal.

Surely, numerous numbers of the smaller files might have 32 character blocks of text, or 32 numeric fields in a database? Has such a possibility ever been considered? With that concept, you need only identify the correct file, already in wide distribution, to use as the password. Even if something very bad happens, you only need to suggest a particular file name to get released, and don't have to rely on distributing an obvious 32 character string of random alphanumeric characters. My slow 2004 era computer bogs down just opening the folder containing the files... But maybe it's something to look into? Maybe some of the 9-11 pager/text logs are exactly 32 characters?
