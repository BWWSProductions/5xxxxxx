Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.

========================================================
Release Notes:

Right...very late releasing this since we got audio tuesday, been a little busy, but tweaked all the colours, didn't
wanna lower saturation to much because would make other scenes look poor. changed the RGB Colours, shadow colours,
and some other bits. Added a sharpness script. Video had small black bars changing on different scenes, due to cropping
on the video originally, i left these intact so you didn't lose any video, theirs the few seconds at the start
still missing, but it is nothing really whats missed. was going to use other cam source but they are very poor...
Audio is pretty sweet. Enjoy Movie is very very good!
