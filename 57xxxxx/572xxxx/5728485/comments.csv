,doug360,2010-08-17T06:04Z,@eliz82 why the fuck don't u upload some shit instead of complainin about shit u didn't pay for?
,armyrecon,2010-08-19T06:03Z,Ok slight concern here.  Dowloaded and watched the vid was great quality i use little snitch to block outgoing connections without approval but noticed that mediacom  blocked my internet. i called them up and asked them why my connection was blocked and they said copyright infringement for downloading the movie inception. how is this possible?
,Musupalace,2010-08-20T19:21Z,"Yeah i could see it begin possible. But you'd have to get 3 Notices before they could cut you off. I dont think they can without warning... Without legal problems them self's .. That begin said, You could also be a spammer just trying to turn people away.  In the end im not scared of getting my internet cut off for downloading.. Ill just end up stealing others if thats the case.. Media corps can suck my nuts.. Take from the rich- give to the family...  And my family thanks you..   "
,dlarrym,2010-08-25T20:58Z,"@armyrecon, the other person saying that you have 3 times before they perm. cut you off. They cut me off (MediCom. . .same provider as you) and in MY case, It was cut off for the 1st incident, I had to go to there office and sign a paper basically swearing I'll NEVER EVER do this BAD thing again, and they turned my cable/internet service back on. About 4 months later, It happened again, This time there was no way out, I was BANNED from Mediacom!!!!!!! NO prosecution took place, but they quickly ""washed there hands"" of me. My advice to you is to research what providers you have in your area, and then look at which ones report bit-torrent activity on a given account to the MPAA and which ISP do not. I know for a fact that AT&T will not cooperate with the MPAA citing that to do this was invasion of the privacy of there subscribers. I don't know which others are of the same practice? Ultimately, from what Mediacom told me, the MPAA cannot effectively track internet users that are downloading bit-torrent files without the ISP helping them with the tracking of said users. Since AT&T WILL NOT help the MPAA, (or anyone else), they are a safe bet to goto for your internet service. The drawback is that there standard DSL package isn't quite as fast as Mediacom's and other basic service plans. AT&T does have a DSL service that runs at 8Gb per sec, instead of the regular DSL service that is about 3.5 to 4 Gb per sec DATA transfer rate. So its a matter of what your willing to do/pay to fully protect yourself. I understand the cost of said services may not fit your budget, but you should look into it more, a solution is out there. Not even to get into the many apps that can protect you better then Little Snitch.

There is an interesting article at this site. It is about a judgment that SIDES WITH TPB!!! stating that ISPs are not obligated to be the ""copyright cop"" for the MPAA or any other organization. A HUGE BLOW to the investigators of copyright infringement. I couldn't quickly find this, but a LIST does exist on the net that has every ISP provider in the US and a chart showing which ones report Torrent traffic to the MPAA or other ""copyright police"", and which ones don't. It has other info not related to torrent activity as well. ALSO I don't think it was posted on the net for the sole purpose to show which ISP will protect you, but it inadvertently does show these ISPs. I have been with AT&T and do not use LITTLE SNITCH or anything like it, and for the last 2 years have not heard even a Peep about anything!!!! GOOD LUCK. If I can find that damn list, I'll upload it as a nit torrent so EVERYONE can benefit from it. ALSO many companies that use LINUX use Bit Torrents to distribute company info to there employees out in the filed and to other company related needs and is perfectly legal. This is another BEBFIT to us as well. By making the BIT-torrent P2P file sharing a needed and legit means of transfer of information, it makes it very hard to snuff it out. The same argument back in the 70's was brought up about VCR's. The MPAA wanted to BAN VCR's use in the home, citing they would lose profits from people copying movies and distributing them to others. This attempt was squashed due to a US law that states any technology that can be shown to have use that benefits people, cannot be banned unless it can be shown it has no use but to do illegal activity. The MPAA tried to show this and to stop the sales of VCR's and BETA-MAX machines to the general public. However, it was shown MANY MANY uses of VCRs and BETA-MAX machines in the field of education, making instructional videos for training purposes, news gathering, and so on and so on. So the more ligament  uses for BITTORRENTs the better! 

Sorry about the LONG comment, I am just trying to bring ANY helpful info to aid in keeping this amazing place and others like it UP and RUNNING. 

Hope this helps EVERYONE!"

To you all that were asking what you need to play this. You will need a pirated version of WINRAR to open the first file in the series, then the Free Version of VLC MEDIA PLAYER (can be downloaded from their website -- google it). To tell you the truth, this copy is not going to be worth it, but proceed. :() watermellon lips lol. "
,pjuser,2010-10-07T04:32Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i just got my internet temporarily disconnected for this torrent, so understand that IT IS BEING MONITORED."
,Wezzy101,2010-10-10T00:40Z,"no need to use a pirated version of winrar free one does just fine, or use 7zip a free open source one. never seen the problem with rars to be honest it isnt hard to open a file some people are just fucking lazy"
