[V],MKVGuy,2010-07-29T21:10Z,"@siddhart, I don't find it anywhere, I will rip it as soon as possible.."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-07-29T21:11Z,"@siddhart, sorry about my last comment, yes got it, you have provided the wrong spelling, I googled it and found the correct one.. will rip it.."
,kzrockz,2010-07-30T00:18Z,"hey bro,also do other parts of that series(the girl who...)"
,PHREEBO,2010-07-30T01:06Z,"Very good work MKVGuy, thanks.
TIP: I suggest you contain the subtitles inside the mkv files. This is a big part of what 'Matroska' is all about; to have such files within one mkv file. I use mkvmergegui in the mkvtoolnix kit. I use KM Player to access such tracks, works great."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-07-30T03:25Z,"@kzrockz, will think about it..

@PHREEBO, I did this is past but some people were not liking it, but I want to do so that is why I am MKVGuy other MP4Guy would have worked for me as my title , I will mux them in my future releases and will again see the response of the users.."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-07-30T03:39Z,"The only version I can find over torrents is the last one, sorry about the rest two.."
,siddhart,2010-07-30T03:50Z,"@MKVGuy
thanx man.....
and also plz make sure its i english..... "
,PHREEBO,2010-07-30T04:41Z,"Note to my other comment: Containing the .srt subtitle inside the .mkv with mkvmerge played fine for me with the latest versions of KMPlayer, VLC, Kantaris Player, and CCCP. You can still turn the subtitle on or off with 1 mkv file, no .srt needed after the merge. I takes about 30 sec. to do this with mkvmerge. Likewise, one can extract subtitles from an mkv with MKVExtractGUI if need be. All the tools I mentioned are free and easy to find. Thanks again MKVGuy."
