Release Notes:

"Accelerated Evolution" draws from the many facets of Devin's multi layered
musical personality. Combining huge melodies with heavy brutality and moments of
spine tingling bliss, the album is a perhaps a more accessible affair than his
previous release (the densely, organic masterpiece "Terria"). The album also saw
Devin assemble a new line up of musicians to breathe new enthusiasm into the
tracks.
