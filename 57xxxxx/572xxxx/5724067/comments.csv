,zxz555,2012-01-05T18:27Z,"Excellent! I have not watched all of the episodes but the ones I have watched have been complete, in sync and good quality. Thanks to anon for the torrent!  

@calospanz: you can right click the iso file after it has dl'd and choose ""disk_image_mounter.app"" from the ""open with"" menu. This will display the files in Finder. You can then play them by hitting space bar."
