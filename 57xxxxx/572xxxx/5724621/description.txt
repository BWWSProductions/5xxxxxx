ADOBE PHOTOSHOP PLUGINS 

ToneMapping 

The Tone Mapping plug-in processes High Dynamic Range images in order to
reveal their details in highlights and shadows. The resulting image can 
then be converted into an 8-bit or 16-bit file that shows the whole 
dynamic range available in the original HDR image. Because the tonal 
range has been compressed while maintaining local contrast, the tone 
mapped image is ready for display on standard monitors and prints.
The Tone Mapping plug-in can also be applied to a 16-bit image resulting
from RAW conversion.
