,decie,2010-08-01T23:28Z,How yuo install the game? There is no setup???? 
,EchoZulu,2010-08-02T01:38Z,"Nice.. Thanks
Had a problem with the steam file, but allowed it through my anti virus and all worked great.

Is it just me, or is there no tutorial or instruction manual for the game."
,xRedster,2010-08-02T07:59Z,"Can't find the cracked content...... Unless I somehow already passed that step. Eitherway, the .exe file won't work."
,EchoZulu,2010-08-02T11:38Z,"The crack file can be found when you ""explore"" the mounted image that you unrar, (BEFORE installation)."
,mr.keda,2010-08-02T19:48Z,"This is first time i get the problem with instaling the game, could someone please tell me which files I have to use to install the game, because when I unrar then I mount on ultra iso, the only thing that i can run is that steamback...thing, when it finished the file is apromaxly 2,xx gb big when i copy the cracked content in my game folder then when i click on exe it says something about side components... sh%t like that :D:D

,POLICEX,2010-08-02T20:51Z,"IM JUST GUESSING HERE BUT SOMETIMES AVG DETECTS CERTAIN FILES AS VIRUSES SO BEFORE YOU MOUNT THE IMAGE
GO INTO AVG AND RIGHT CLICK  RESIDENT SHIELD THEN SELECT OPEN ,UNCHECK THE TICK BOX THAT SAYS RESIDENT SHIELD ACTIVE THEN CLICK SAVE CHANGES AND IGNORE ALL WARNINGS 
NOW MOUNT THE IMAGE INSTALL THE GAME AND COPY THE CRACKED CONTENT FROM THE DISK IMAGE OVER TO THE INSTALLED GAMES FILE 
HOPE THIS WORKS FOR ALL THOSE WHO R HAVING DIFFICULTY'S "
,POLICEX,2010-08-02T20:52Z,DONT FORGET TO ENABLE RESIDENT SHIELD AFTER YOUVE FINISHED

,Gurra98,2010-08-03T19:11Z,"mr.keda: WHat is that c++? Where did you get it? I have followed your threads, and it looks like I have the same problems as you did. Could you please help me, and give me some instructions how to make this work? I have installed it twice, but the only thing I get is this error: ""This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem"". I need help, I can`t get this to work!!"
,Sun Tzu,2010-08-13T03:13Z,"After i installed the game and moved the crack i try and run the game. Then it tells me its missing d3dx9_42.dll. I then proceed to procuring that .dll and try again. This time i get to the initial start up. My screen goes black for a second or two before it crashes. A window pops up with the option search for a solution online or close the game. When i click the details button it tells me that there is something wrong with another .dll named storm3dv2.dll. Anyone know what the problem might be?

Yours sincerely,"
,PaulMc92,2010-08-15T00:17Z,"How do ""copy over the cracked content"", and is it just the folder named cracked?"
,PaulMc92,2010-08-15T00:17Z,"How do I \""copy over the cracked content\"", and is it just the folder named cracked?"
,symbest,2010-09-03T21:28Z,"This how you install (according to my experience) :

1) Extract using Winrar to a new folder
2) Mount with Daemon Tool lite
3) Valve Steam Install will appear, then choose your install dir (ex : C:\Program Files )
4) open install dir (ex : C:\Program Files\Commander- Conquest of the Americas ), open ""DirectX"" folder, double-click ""DXsetup"", begin installation until finish.
5) Open ""Studio_Redistributable"" folder, double-click vcredist-x86, begin installation until finish.
6) explore mounted image, open Crack folder, copy all files, paste in install dir.
7) Double-click the application file (ex: Commander)
8) Play and enjoy the game. "

This happened with another steam game.  Any suggestions for me?  I have no idea how to access the game.  Thanks for the help!!  (And I am in administrator on my laptop)"
,Crimsonmori,2010-12-05T05:17Z,@mehlev i was having the same problem as you until i right clicked and told it to run as administrator then when i looked into my program files it was there. i hope that helps you 
,coldheartzero,2011-01-01T19:09Z,"If you're on Vista you must install it using admin privileges. Also, it's EXTREMELY buggy, and if you happen to be using a video card that's a year old you're going to experience a LOT of graphics issues. The developers websites says their is a patch that's going to address these issues, however since this is a steam crack only a steam patch will fix it. Since you can't download a steam patch, well, you're fucked. It's playable once you learn the eccentricities of the anomalies, but it's irritating. When I was programming for Westwood making a game this unoptimized for even year old cards would of cost us our jobs."
