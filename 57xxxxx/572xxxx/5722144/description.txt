...................................NFO:.................................................The.Biography.Channel.Kirstie.Alley.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

Kirstie Alley won an Emmy for playing Rebecca Howe, the 
neediest soul in the bar where everyone knows your name, 
and then won a second in the made-for-TV movie, David's 
Mother. She has also starred in the enormously popular 
Look Who's Talking movies as well as her own sitcom vehicle, 
Veronica's Closet. Now, though, she's more known for her 
continuing struggle to keep her weight under control - 
a battle she has both won and lost over the years.
