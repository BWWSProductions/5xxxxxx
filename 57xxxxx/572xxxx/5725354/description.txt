info :Steal This Film is a film series documenting the movement against intellectual property shot in Sweden and released in August 2006, combines accounts from prominent players in the Swedish piracy culture (The Pirate Bay, PiratbyrÃ¥n, and the Pirate Party) with found material, propaganda-like slogans and Vox Pops.

It includes interviews with The Pirate Bay members Fredrik Neij (tiamo), Gottfrid Svartholm (anakata) and Peter Sunde (brokep) that were later re-used by agreement in the documentary film Good Copy Bad Copy, as well as with PiratbyrÃ¥n members Rasmus Fleischer (rsms), Johan (krignell) and Sara Andersson (fraux).
