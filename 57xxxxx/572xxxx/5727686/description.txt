On one side is an army of gunmen dead-set on springing a murderous sidekick from jail. On the other is sheriff John T. Chance and his two deputies: one a drunk, the other a cripple. Place your bet.
John Wayne is Chance in Rio Bravo, a lean western classic packing solid heroics and a strong emotional core. He's joined by Dean Martin as the drunken deputy, Walter Brennan as the old coot, whose spirit outmatches his hobbled stride, Ricky Nelson as a youth out to prove himself and Angie Dickinson as a scarlet woman with her eye on Chance.
Director Howard Hawks lifted the western to new heights with Red River (1948). Capturing the legendary west with a stellar cast in peak form, he does it again there.
