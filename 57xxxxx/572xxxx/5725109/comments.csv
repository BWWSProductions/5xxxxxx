,SlabOfMeat,2010-07-30T03:52Z,"Not gunna lie, i just took the folder n uploaded it."
,SlabOfMeat,2010-07-30T03:58Z,"If the setup does not work try running wmplayer.exe :)

If that works, replace in Program Files/Windows Media Player and make shortcuts, etc."
,Axel_81,2010-07-30T04:24Z,"really, it doesnt work under 32bit system.. U have 64bit, arent U ?"
,SlabOfMeat,2010-07-30T05:05Z,"I am sorry that it is not working for you. :(
I have windows 7 x32.
Please tell me any errors you are getting.
Also please try using administrator rights, or turning off UAC. :)"
,SlabOfMeat,2010-07-30T05:10Z,"Please tell me any errors you get. Also try running it as admin.
Also, restart your computer and press f8 constantly. Then enter safe mode with networking.
Try installing again. :-)"

,lhlinux,2010-08-06T20:09Z,Copying the folder the program is installed to doesn't mean that it will work on any other computer.... There are plenty of required DLLs and other files required to make it run. Do you really think that WMP12 is only 2.14 MB :/
,_silent,2010-10-28T02:13Z,I think it only work on windows 7
,CkRich,2011-01-30T05:59Z,You made a copy of an already installed program from a folder in your computer...I sugest if you have the WMP 12 installation disc that you instead try making an ISO file from that.
