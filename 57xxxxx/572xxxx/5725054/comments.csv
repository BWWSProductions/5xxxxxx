 Game is NOT working on M3i Zero with 4.8 x. Updated my card system to V4.8d X and V1.6 firmware - still not working :S"

ive tested this rom on m3i zero with 4.8d x and is working fine , so i advise you to check your equipment and make sure you are unpacking ROM correctly and transferring to SD in correct manner"
