I am doing this on behalf of 20-40 (twentyforty), these are HIS encodes that he takes hours to do on an old PC. 

IF you want to get the files as they come out from the MAN himself, i.e. 20-40, then please drop me a line at jon_4fun@hotmail.com (there is an underscore in the address - jon_4fun) and I'll get you 20-40 contact details. Please put 20-40 in the subject line of your e-mail so that I can find your e-mail easily.

I will only do 1 file at a time as I have a low upload speed. IF 20-40 was back you would be getting MORE files & FASTER. I would ask those who can to look at the MU attached file and DL the file directly and then help with initial -seed. The more seeders the faster the next files will be UP'ed

PLEASE consider donating to getting him a new PC. Consider it an investment in getting the best torrents available. It will save you money in long term as soon 20-40 files will not be available at ALL. He is only able to encode on an old PC that he resurrected and that crashes every 10 mintues. It will soon die and then we won't even be able to e-mail him.

I am asking you to consider how much money he saves you by providing HIGH-QAULITY & SMALL FILE SIZE torrents.
Just spend a few minutes and consider if you have to resort to getting every file as some crappy .avi at a minimum of 350MB???

Any all contributions are welcome and NEEDED, even a few bucks could make the difference.

At this time, I would like to thank those fans who have already sent cash and those that are going to; on behalf of 20-40 'Thank you'. Your e-mails and support are hugely appreciated. Every little bit helps, no matter how small the amount. Together we can get the master of H264 small file size back doing what he does better than anyone else.

A fan, 
Jon
