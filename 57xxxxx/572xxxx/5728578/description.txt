"Why Do Fools Fall in Love" is a song that was originally a hit for early New York City-based rock and roll group Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers in 1956. It reached No. 1 on the R&B chart, No. 6 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart,[citation needed] and number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song was ranked #307 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

The song helped to make Frankie Lymon a household name and would make him a rock and roll pioneer, paving the way for later teen prodigies like Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson, whose careers also took off at the age of 13.

Diana Ross released a cover version on the RCA label in 1981, peaking at #7 on Billboard's Pop Singles Chart, and number four in the UK Singles Chart. The success of Ross' cover helped reintroduce a new generation of audiences to Lymon[dubious â€“ discuss]. A remix of Ross' cover peaked at #36 on the UK charts in July, 1994.
