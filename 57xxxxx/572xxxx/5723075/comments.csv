,SaGgYmcGRILL,2010-07-28T22:43Z,"thxs dude,

hopefully this 1 is the same."
,iblish,2010-07-28T23:11Z,@globeplus so custom maps with bots/ai can be played with this upload without any internet connection
[V],globeplus,2010-07-29T00:02Z,"To iblish : i didn?t guarantee that but it is absolute intact game and to run the game you don?t a internet connection because is already updated and ready to go , in all the other available isos you need to wait a installtion than a borring update that can take a long time with a need of a internet connection and sometimes you don?t finish the upadte than you need to wait to repeat and try again , sometimes you have to try to the support to fix the update too and many times the usr can get problems with the first install and then neding a 2nd or 3rd install until have the game ok to play , with this file nothing of that happen it is only the game waiting for you to be played and it is absolute ntact like the original iso and less close 700 mb anyway . "
[V],globeplus,2010-07-29T00:04Z,"To iblish : to complete the before comment , you don?t need a internet connection to play the game , so you can check that specific situation inside the game with tranquility ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-29T00:22Z,"I already write 2 comments but not showed for the moment , maybe this one it will be ok : with the game ready to go like i have you don?t need a internet connection for playing the game like with the original iso where you need a internet connection to the update and that is needed or the worked executable will not work properly and it is many isers needing more than 1 installation and a borring update that can take time and problems before have the game ready to go , so you can try inside the game that , that?s all ."
,iblish,2010-07-29T00:36Z,sorry to disturb again.so do i need battle.net account to play custom maps

[V],globeplus,2010-07-29T03:19Z,"To iblish : not shore but probably , you have the single player campaign available , the rest i am not really shore and it is like that for any file , search pirate bay or the net for tips ."

,nkm10gt,2010-07-29T07:35Z,"Hey globeplus.
I always appricate your work and download your release whether it have very few seeds because i like your work, so please upload the APB( All Point Bulletin) game, I am waiting for this game for many weeks, and 1 thing more can you guys upload the FIFA WORLD CUP 2010 with sound and with full version?
Waiting for the reply. Thanks."
,Netarangi,2010-07-29T09:46Z,A 6.4gig rip.. Omg. Was hoping for under 2gig atleast. :(
[V],globeplus,2010-07-29T13:34Z,"To nkm10gt : the allpoints bulletin is a open urban world massive multiplayer online , so for torrents probably tough to use , the other one don?t make too much sense , it is more a matter to wait for the fifa 11 when comes out , it is true that the wwi version is without sound but ok the gameplay . To finish this comment just to say that i have all the pleasure in work all the nice games . Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-29T13:39Z,"To netarangi :  well my friendly user i was thinkinng that too and i always have that expectation but this game have a 97 or 98% compression ratio with the game folder that means that the best you get if you try a compression with 7zip for example is a few mega less for all the game folder , so under this circunstances having the game ready to go and with close 700 mb less than the original iso is really positive and it was needed a hard work for that for more ridiculous that sounds , the game is absolute intact including videos and sound because i can?t touch them and certainly i didn?t want to prejudicate the gameplay , to finish my friendly user we have to accept the 6.43 gb for this and still a nice work , believe me ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-29T18:02Z,"I repeat to the generality of the gamers out there that my file have the game absolute intact for close 700 mb less and ready to go , what in the case of this game means that the user only have to launch the executable not passing for possible constrangiments with new installations or borring updates that can take too much time and needed to be repeated anyway . Thank you everyone and my work is always the search in facilitate more as possible the life of the user when running the game ."
,Toshiya,2010-07-29T19:06Z,"I'll probally wait for a version with all the Movies ripped, I don't care about the Story, and Since my main attraction are the skirmish modes, and those are not supported at the moment... I'll have to wait for a while.

Non the least, Thanks for the Torrent :)"
,nkm10gt,2010-07-30T09:15Z,Thanks Globe for the reply.

,daMouse,2010-07-31T03:26Z,"Already defeated by game patch. Oh well, I got to see how boring it looked."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-01T21:33Z,"To peter123gan :  you can try apply the patch but backup your game folder first and if the patch needs installation and don?t let you browse you need another technique to try to incorporate the patch in the directplay mode file , create an empty folder and put the patch on it , then right click mouse on the patch and try a 7zip extraction for example , if you will be succedeed with the extraction then you need to finf out where the extracted files make sense inside the game folder and apply them , remember always to have a copy of the game folder intact to prevent any executable problem .

,9898562325,2010-08-02T12:53Z,"is it working
?"
,ccr123,2010-08-02T14:56Z,"working good, not great, but it works just fine if u start the game with your last save. 
go into 'my docs' find the last savegame, right click on it, open with starcraft ii.exe, in case the updater starts shut it down, it will immediately load your last checkpoint, exit the game with alt+f4, and that's it. 
thanks globe!"

,MP7560,2010-08-03T09:07Z,"First, Great torrent :)!

Is there any way to update this version of the game to 1.01 and apply the razor patch so that we don't have to go through the editor to play skirmish?

I tried autoupdating but got stuck at 88% where it kept saying that one of the md5's didn't match.
"
,MP7560,2010-08-03T15:43Z,"Don't worry actually, deleted some files and rebuild them using Blizzard Repair then applied the razor crack. For some reason though, skirmish maps only appear on the Razor '2' profile....strange.

anyway thanks again for the torrent:)"
