,Spurge42,2010-08-03T15:07Z,Update:  Got it working . Thanks .
[T],xxThugxx,2010-08-03T15:54Z,"yeah it will do if you disable your data connection, thats why you put it in areoplane mode :D"
,sjorsbig1,2010-08-03T22:24Z,"can't i run the game because i have android 1.6 perhaps?
the site says i can run it but i can't and i have followed the instructions as given in the discription so it's not my fault i think.. 
please give a solution!!
i want to play the game so much!!"
,sjorsbig1,2010-08-03T22:26Z,and in wich directory do i have put the com.gameloft.android.GAND.GloftSPAW.HeroOfSparta.v3.1.2.apk file????
[T],xxThugxx,2010-08-04T22:57Z,"you can delete the .apk once you have installed its not needed, you can use it to install from any location you want, i dont have a 1.6 device to test anymore, just 2.1 & 2.2 so i cant test wether it works on 1.6, maybe you should udate your rom to eclair or froyo and see if you can gey it to work then "
,sjorsbig1,2010-08-14T20:57Z,"oke:)
thank you very much.
i don't know if i'm going to root my phone because someone else has than also access to my phone right?
and i don't know if I use an other rom that i hold the same interface as i have right now. (the blue theme from sony ericsson) because i don't want an other interface.
what are exactly the disadvantage of rooting?
thanks:)

Rooting does NOT give someone else access to your phone.

It's a bit like this;

With an ordinary android phone, some settings and features are ""disabled"", because the regular user doesn't need them.

Some apps (like changing roms etc) uses more advanced features and require more access to your phone, and that's what ""rooting"" does."
,sjorsbig1,2010-09-03T19:04Z,"this is so weird!!
if I download the trail game from the site of gameloft is the game working and if i try to install the game downloaded from here it says it can't install it...
someone a solution?????"
,sjorsbig1,2010-09-09T16:14Z,"not needed anymore.
i found by myself a solution.
thanks anyway"
