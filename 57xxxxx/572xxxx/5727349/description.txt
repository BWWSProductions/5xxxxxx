The adventurous pianist, composer, and bandleader Jason Moran added guitarist
Marvin Sewell to his band on 2005's Same Mother. Sewell is back and melding
further with his own funky blues-based playing on Artist in Residence, which is
a far-reaching jazz record combining elements of post-bop, New Orleans jazz,
funk, blues and even post-20th century classical music to Moran's array of
shades and colors to play with. The repetitive sampled spoken word loop by
Adrian Piper which acts as the ground for both the opener "Break Down" and
"Artists Ought To Be Writing" is a bit h jarring when the band lights up under
her. As she chants "Break down the barriers/Break down, misunderstanding/Break
down, the artworld/Break down, the artist/Break down, the general public . .,"
the band uses it (looped continually through the piece, even in the solos) to
ground everything in a circular rhythmic principle. Just as unsettling is Alicia
Hall Moran's soprano vocal in near Webern-like lieder as the introduction to
"Milestone" atop Moran's lilting piano before the band kicks it in prosaically
at the one-minute mark. She frames her wordless vocal just as Moran's left hand
begins to spin out a melodic figure for everyone else to play around, though the
entire piece sounds like an intro. Bassist Tarus Mateen and drummer Nasheet
Waits earn their keep trying to ground this piece as it spirals to near and far
Eastern shores. But it gets so much stranger as the improvised bass intro to
"Refraction 2" begins to introduce the players almost sideways, and where melody
and harmony appear almost as if by accident. Yet it's all motion, building,
falling, spilling, and being contained within a harmonic grid that is nearly
wide open. The breakdown theme restates itself only to become more fleshed-out
as narrative essay in "Artists Ought to Be Writing," but the solo piano that
follows is so speculative it never really takes off. The long-ish improvised
intro that finally gels as "Rain" is the album's most exciting tune. From its
cryptic, elliptical movement into a full-fledged angular yet funky post-bop
tune, it is breaking apart by its end nearly 12 minutes later. People may
initially have a hard time with Artist in Residence. But it moves so freely and
yet so purposely that it draws the listener into its unique soundworld slowly
but deliberately, and offers plenty for the effort.
