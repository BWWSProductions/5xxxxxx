,QborT,2010-07-29T07:59Z,WTF is up with your that pic hosting company brego45?  Using one less virus based might be nice...
[V],brego45,2010-07-29T17:12Z,@QborT  All my torrents and links are virus free and clean this has been clarified many times till now
,QborT,2010-07-29T21:50Z,"I'm sure your torrents are virus free, you don't get ""skulled up"" for nothin.  But the hosting site is horrible.  No if's, and's, or but's about it.
