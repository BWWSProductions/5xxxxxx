and...  The shocking true story of serial killer William Bonin (Scott 

Leet), who stalked California freeways in search of victims to murder, 

mutilate, and rape from May of 1979 through June of 1980. A deceitful 

charmer with a hair-trigger temper, Bonin could go from benevolent citizen 

to murderous psychopath in the blink of an eye. Throughout the course of 

his crime spree, the killer and his small group of deeply-disturbed 

accomplices succeeded in claiming at least 21 lives before their reign of 

terror came to an end. Tipped off by a former associate who suspected Bonin 

may be the "Freeway Killer" authorities had been searching for, police 

promptly began staking Bonin out, and awaited the perfect moment to make 

their move.
