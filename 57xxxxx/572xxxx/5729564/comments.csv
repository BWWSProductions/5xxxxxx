,xpmule,2011-12-27T07:17Z,"Clearly stated information that is often left out..
Good job.
I meant the its a mixed source release (tv-rip+dvdrip)
Season 1 and 2 are DVDrips
Season 3,4,5 are TV Rips

Also since season 6 is done you could probably update your torrent now ;)

Good job and thank you"
,mafeki,2012-01-05T12:05Z,"Does anyone know where I can get ""In your thighs"" by Shawn Coleman featured at the end of the 5th episode on season six? If i'm not mistaken it's like a parody of that peter gabriel song."
