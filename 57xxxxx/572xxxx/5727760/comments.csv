Like Rolling Stones - Hot Rocks, ccr chronicle, black sabbath selftitled, beatles magical mystery tour, acdc back in black.

id appreciate if you could do those with your new method of lower volume. Your aerosmith rip sounds amazing, brings back memories of long trips with the tape deck playing that music.
