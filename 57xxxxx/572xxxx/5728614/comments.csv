,zonker,2010-07-31T18:19Z,"I couldn't get ""Edit torrent"" to work, so:

In the wake of strong U.S. government statements condemning WikiLeaks' recent publishing of 77,000 Afghan War documents, the secret-spilling site has posted a mysterious encrypted file labeled ""insurance.""

The huge file, posted on the Afghan War page at the WikiLeaks site, is 1.4 GB and is encrypted with AES256. The file?s size dwarfs the size of all the other files on the page combined. The file has also been posted on a torrent download site as well.

...

Cryptome, a separate secret-spilling site, has speculated that the file may have been posted as insurance in case something happens to the WikiLeaks website or to the organization's founder, Julian Assange. In either scenario, WikiLeaks volunteers, under a prearranged agreement with Assange, could send out a password or passphrase to allow anyone who has downloaded the file to open it.

I saw that after I created this torrent. However, the hash on that other torrent was different from the hash on this one and I wasn't sure why. I did an SHA256 checksum on the file in this torrent and it matches the checksum on Wikileaks' site. So I thought it wouldn't hurt to upload this one too."

,bluecar5556,2010-12-17T06:34Z,"     Did you hear the shocking news?  According to  http://www.demandprogress.org  Glen Greenwald reports that U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning is being tortured.  Manning is accused of leaking unflattering information about the Afghanistan war to WikiLeaks, but hasn't been convicted of -- or even tried for -- any crime.
     Manning is being held at the U.S. Marine brig in Quantico, and according to Greenwald:

Manning has been subjected for many months without pause to inhumane, personality-erasing, soul-destroying, insanity-inducing conditions of isolation similar to those perfected at America's Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado:  all without so much as having been convicted of anything. 
     Torture is outrageous and un-American, demand fair treatment of Private Manning by going to the following URL :

To demand an end to Private Manning's torture and call on the Army to give him a trial or set him free, also go to this URL :
