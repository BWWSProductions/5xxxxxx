For you stranded guys ...
Change the language:
--------------------

There's a file called 'General.opt' in:
~Rise of PrussiaROPSettings

Open it up and on the nearly beginning change the setting ...

###
2. *** General interface choices ***
// language (0: English; 1: Francais; 2: Espanol; 3: Deutsche)
Language         = 4
ThirdLanguage    = 4
###

... to your preferred language (e.g., while '3' means 'Deutsch'):

0 = English
1 = FranĂ§aise
2 = EspaĂąol
3 = Deutsch
4 = Russki
5 = Italiano

Serial:
-------
Take e.g. this one:

RAAA-LAAA-DAAA-AAAA-AAAA-6548



-- Hope it helps

,rightjack,2012-06-19T13:30Z,"Please ignore the above comment, another vista problem with admin permission before opening the file.
I have changed the language numbers to 0 (English), however the game remains in Russian."
