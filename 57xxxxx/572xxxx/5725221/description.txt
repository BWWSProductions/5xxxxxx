Richard Thompson and his guitar.  Really that's all you need.  Recorded live at New York's famed Bottom Line, Thompson rolls through 17 tunes of evidence that he is the most under rated guitarist and lyricist of our time.  The songs are all great, the playing is of course spectacular.  Vocally, I get the feeling that he wasn't in full voice on this night.  He clears his throat several times between song lines, so maybe he was fighting a slight cold.  I've heard him stronger, but he still sounds great.  This isn't the album I would play for a Thompson beginner, but for the initiated, it's quite a treat.  Best cuts are "Beat the Retreat", "A Heart Needs a Home", "I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight", "Never Again" and "Meet on the Ledge".  But really, they're all good.
