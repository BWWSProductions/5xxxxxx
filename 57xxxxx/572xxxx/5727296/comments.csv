,PhilLesh12,2010-07-30T20:59Z,"The irony of this documentary is that it ignores a blatant fact.  No matter who they think ""discovered"" America, whoever it was discovered that there were ""indians"" living there.

I'm not sure how one can discover something that is already inhabited.

thanks phatwarez."

Yes, but someone came here first. It may well have been ancestors of Native Americans, but SOMEONE DID, IN FACT, discover North and South America. Completely illogical to suggest that someone was always already here."
