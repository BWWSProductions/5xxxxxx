     Chimaira's video for Destroy and Dominate.  If you'd leeched      
     our tv rips of this video, you'll notice the dvdrip differs in    
     that it has concert footage in place of a few computer effects,   
     hence why we tagged tagged this Concert Version. :-)              
                                                                       
     Also, as with our NTSC tv rip, this video has has some dupe       
     frames during parts with computer effects.  And, we left this     
     as standard anamorphic since that's the widest frame to crop at   
     (for the beginning concert footage).
