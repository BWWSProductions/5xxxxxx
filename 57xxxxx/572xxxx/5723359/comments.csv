,pimmyjalmer,2010-09-11T13:39Z,"For some reason the audio has this annoying tapping sound whenever anyone is talking. Sounds like morse code. It's definitely this video file (thought it might be my sound card). None of my other vids do this.

Great quality video, but the audio is annoying.

I regret dling this over the HDlite one. "
