From Wiki:



Erik Schrody (born August 18, 1969 in Valley Stream, New York), better known by his stage name Everlast, is a Grammy-Award winning Irish-American rapper and singer-songwriter, known for his solo hit "What It's Like" and as the front-man for rap group House of Pain.

He is also part of the hip-hop supergroup La Coka Nostra, which consists of his former House of Pain mates, Danny Boy and DJ Lethal, along with Underground rap veteran Ill Bill and Irish-American rapper Slaine. On July 14 of 2009 they released their debut album A Brand You Can Trust on Uncle Howie Records and Suburban Noize Records.

Everlast was born in Valley Stream, New York of Irish descent.[1] His grandfather was of German descent. Emerging as a member of the Rhyme Syndicate, Everlast's first solo album Forever Everlasting (1990), largely made possible by MC Ice T, was a disappointment both critically and commercially. Following the album's failure, Everlast teamed up with DJ Lethal and high school friend Danny Boy to form House of Pain. The group was signed to Tommy Boy Records, and their eponymous debut album (1992) went multi-platinum, spawning the successful DJ Muggs produced single "Jump Around". This song was also remixed twice by Pete Rock, one version featuring a verse from him and one without. The album also featured Cypress Hill member, B-Real, on the song "Put Your Head Out".

Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish American hooligans (Lethal is actually of Latvian heritage), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative Judgment Night movie soundtrack. The group eventually disbanded in 1996 with Everlast pursuing a solo career.

Everlast's second solo album Whitey Ford Sings the Blues (1998)-- which was released a full eight years after his solo debut and after he had a major heart attack Ã¢
