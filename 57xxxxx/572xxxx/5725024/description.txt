Uploader note:
This is Copolla Restoration edition made smaller for all of you who has slow
internet connections. More than 9h of epic movies takes only 1 DVD and includes
hardcoded Italian speech subtitled to English...

Regards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew.


1. UNFINISHED movies HAVE synchro problemms. This is the nature of highly
commpressed content. Also there seems to be the problemm with Haali Media
Splitter. If you are using Media Player Classic please make sure you have
enabled INTERNAL FILTER for MP4.
2. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you actually seen it. If you HAVE LIKED this
release tell others about it. If you dont tell it too but dont forget to tell
why, so I could learn from your opinion providing you something better in the
future :).
3. I can confirm the xbox360 will play it through WINDOWS media center extender.
Read this forum http://www.avforums.com/forums/streamers-network-media-players/1107552-what-xbox-360-like-media-extender.html
4. My releases are different than anybody else, so they SHOULD NOT be compared to
any existing scene rules. I belive if there are different rules for Telecine
and for DVDRip there can be also different rule for FASM QEBS releases. If the
scene will overregulate itself, prohibiting new ideas to come it will soon
become like our goverments.
5. If you like the movie, gratitude the creators by going to cinema, buying
Bluray/DVD or any other possible way.
6. The movies can be directly streamable throught WWW, by Adobe Flash Player
version 9 or higher.
7. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. If you write something
directly in assembler it is usually much faster and takes much less size,
than the same thing written in C, Java etc... It also means FAchman SoofMan
- founders of FASM :)
8. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is the h264 commpression method
optimised directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved
, each revision bringing quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard
x264 encoding is explained by the same reason XVID encodes are better than
DIVX3.
9. FASM recommends IMGBURN for burning those files into DVD.
10.Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source
(Bluray Rip) should also work with this release.
