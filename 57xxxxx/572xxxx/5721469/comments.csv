,HQS,2010-07-28T16:10Z,"Finally!!! I know the problem!!!

I copy my save game folder to my document (from Liberty version), I don?t see load button in menu. I can only start new campaign.

Thanks extremezone!!


"
,VittGen,2010-07-29T13:52Z,"Ok... first of, you can NOT save with the Liberty version.
Now, i got it working for Win XP pro SP3 64 and it works like charm, but the .nfo isn't very precise so here is what you have to do:

1. Unrar
2. Mount image
3. run installer exe
*I did the setup while online to the internet but i guess it's the same as offline (except from the part of enterning the media key)
4. After the install is done the autoupdate window will pop up.... close it ASAP
5. Go to the crack folder.... copy ALL THE FILES except of the update.bat and paste them in the game folder (make sure you replaced ALL THE FILES)
6. Then go to the crack folder again and run update.bat
7. After update is over, go to the crack folder and copy ALL THE FILES one more time, and paste them to the game folder again (basically you replace ALL THE FILES for a 2nd time after update)
8. Enjoy the game
*If you run the game and it asks for a battlenet acount you did something of the above wrong... (i did at first aswell, so try makin all the steps right)

*For all those who ask if this version supports multiplayer... its a PIRATED version so NO... it doesn't

*Also, saves work 100%

Hope this helped"

,Rogue2529,2010-07-30T13:10Z,"I have great news for who can't install StarCraft 2 because some shits of these error [can't find, dirty, corrupt etc.]

First, excuse my English because English is not my first language! Thank you.
Second, make sure your StarCraft 2 is ""Complete"" not some crap like ""Digital Download"" or something like that!

So here very very simple steps from me, IT IS YOUR OVERCLOCK! yes! overclock!

1. Go to your BIOS setup
2. load default setup to reset every OC values in your BIOS, especially MEMORY [Ram] must reset to default settings!
3. Save and Exit
4. Wait until your Windows boost up
5. Run StarCraft 2 Installer again and Vivo la!!!!! ITS INSTALLER NOW WORK LIKE CHARM!!!! YEAHHHHH!!!

for some reason, Bilzzard Installer are crap or something because its can't catch up my CPU and RAM overclocked so its failure to installation...

NOTE 1: this tips work for peoples who loved to overclock your PC by pushing hard CPU and RAM! so you need to reset them to default values first. When your installation is completed, just back to BIOS and set your OC again to maximize your performance of PC!
NOTE 2: for peoples who didn't OC, just try my tips to see if this work for you :) try to reset your RAM timing and clock would helps you
Enjoy!"

,j-d-uk,2010-07-30T15:20Z,"This is coming down at 5-9Kb/s with a ETA of 1-2 weeks a typical example of leeching cunts taking the piss on a new game release. Happens all the time, pure selfishness, they get it for free and still can't even share it for a few days wile downloading it, unfuckingbelievable! I now have to sit here and watch this torrent and kick 'em off.

How to deal with this I find is to use utorrent 2.0.2 instead of limewire ect..
For the torrent your downing click on the peers tab and see who is uping and downing the most and pick the best and remove the leechers. Also it goes without saying to have your upload speed set to unlimited. Because I pick those people and they pick me for doing the same.

After I've done that I'm now getting 400-600 Kb/s, not great but I can live with that. This can degrade as people come on and people come off the torrent and so you need to check back every few hours to keep it coming down the pipe quick.

Good luck with the leech squishing, in time all will know who the leechers are as they'll be the ones complaining about slow download speeds, I say you reap what you sow, so good enough for them!"

,VittGen,2010-07-30T15:54Z,"@Jaymz82
Instead of mounting the .iso try to extract it with 7zip(or simmilar program) and run the installer from the extracted folder..."
,VittGen,2010-07-30T16:00Z,"And btw, for all those who keep asking or complaining about the torrent not supporting multiplayer or skirmish.... You are downloading it. It's free. On the .nfo it says that it supports only campaign and map editor... So you either go buy the game, or download it here for free and enjoy the campaign... 
ps. I hope that at some point they will make a crack""fix"" to play the skirmish but i don't think the pirated version will ever support multiplayer... it usually never does (especially for blizzard products). "

No you don't. If you are installing it with internet off at some point you will have to insert a media key(it says which one it is at the .nfo) but that's it... and if you install it with internet on there's no need for that media key either.

Before this one I was using the Direct download + some crappy crack that wouldn't let me save and I'd have to load by double clicking the autosave files in the folders

To get the update to work for me though not only did I have to change the cd support to cd updates, but I also had to add an @pause, otherwise it wouldn't do the update properly (before it'd just breeze through the .bat file without doing updates.
Not sure if that's what fixed it for me but it did work right after I did that.

,toadpilz,2010-07-31T02:41Z,"all people who have dsl have crippled upload speed per definition,
lets say the max possible is about 10% or their download speed,
you cutie complainer, it is not physically/logically possible for a new torrent to run fast cause of that fact, even if everyone is uploading to their max,
try to think about it for once you stupid stupid pussys,
it needs time until the torrent has enough seeder who do NOT download anymore and who can use their mini upload speed completely for giving back,
how difficult is that?

I cant install the game anyone know how to fix it."
,qwerty17,2010-08-01T03:11Z,"My SC2 works now 
this is what i did

1.Crack this SC2-Liberty using Reloaded's Crack 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5723363/Starcraft_2_Wings_of_Liberty_Reloaded_Crack_Only

2.Then Crack it using Razor 1911's Crack
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5730029/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper-Razor1911-CrackOnly

and this is what i did for the MAPS

a folder inside

C:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\Battle.net\Cache
or just directly inside the
C:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\Battle.net\Cache folder?

If in case it was the inside another folder, what was the name of the folder containing it?[/quote]
Inside of the folder chache you will see a bunch of folders

00
0a
0b
...
etc

at this point u have to use the search system, look for the extension *.s2ma in the chache folder to find them, the maps will have names like:

0e639dfeb6bbe18f5a859b5059dd6e296a7a19d1c902f538c250545fc7dd5658.s2ma
or
1f720f0a950a29e6a77bddd4d3e4986faef7c6773066f61e9e4688242ec2538a.s2ma

Copy all the maps to a folder in your desktop, then u can rename it from *.s2ma to *.sc2map

the best method i found was using a batch renaming
you can do this opening the notepad and writing this parameters

rename *.s2ma *.sc2map

and save it as .bat
example: SC2Maprename.bat

then put the .bat file in to the folder where u put all the maps and execute it
so now you have all the maps whit extension *.sc2map :D
and now u have to open 1 by 1 with the editor map and look for the name of the map and change it
to see the name of each map in the editor go to

Map --> Mapinfo


in the ""info"" tab u have to change the ""Locale"" from enGB to enUS to see the name of the map (in enGB dont show it i dont know why, in enUS and the rest of the countrys it showed)


Well i hope this will helped you"

Note:
*1st Disable Anti-virus before cracking.
*If you're encountering a problem about
keytro.exe install sandboxie then choose 
run outside sandboxie.

3. Install the game. When the game is installed in offline mode, a message
   will be displayed that you need to be online. Click the orange button to
   enter a media key: checknfo.
   If you have an internet connection enabled during setup, at the end of
   the setup, the autoupdate starts, close the autoupdate window.

4. Copy over the update files (ONLY ""updates"" dir and ""update.bat"" file)
   to the install dir 

!!!
 AND : Replace the ""Blizzard Updater.exe"" 
(in the Support folder of your installation repertory)
by the cracked one 
(in the Crack folder of the mounted image)

3. Do not use the liberty crack, instead download this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5730029/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper-Razor1911-CrackOnly

4.Run Razor1911SC2_COPY.exe

5. Run keytro.exe IM: if keytro stops responding, go to notepad and type : \""start keytro.exe\"" (without the quotes) and save it as a .bat file IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE KEYTRO PROGRAM.

6. Run the .bat file you saved.

7. It will go through this whole thing about how awesome razor1911 is and stuff.

8. When prompted hit F2 once. The screen should flash very briefly.

9. Run the game.

I plan on buying the game for myself but I really want to be able to casually play Starcraft 2 with two or three of my friends without purchasing 4 separate copies. That's bullshit.

In my opinion, the lack of LAN play is probably hurting their sales for more than one reason. 
A) It pissed people off
B) My friends wouldn't have even bought Starcraft 1 if it wasn't for us playing LAN (with all the same copy) at my house...

I was going to buy this game to play locally and casually with my friends. That is the only way I enjoy RTS and since my most important feature has been excluded from my favorite RTS, I am extremely distressed.

I don't want to buy it anymore, and I don't even want to download it."

I did nt read every comments before but this surely works :
There is ONE little failure in the instructions :
You have to replace :
Support\\Blizzard Updater.exe
by the cracked one before making the update.

So the instructions are :

2. Burn or mount the image.

3. Install the game. When the game is installed in offline mode, a message
will be displayed that you need to be online. Click the orange button to
enter a media key: checknfo.
If you have an internet connection enabled during setup, at the end of
the setup, the autoupdate starts, close the autoupdate window.

4. Copy over the update files (ONLY \""updates\"" dir and \""update.bat\"" file)
to the install dir

!!!
AND : Replace the \""Blizzard Updater.exe\""
(in the Support folder of your installation repertory)
by the cracked one
(in the Crack folder of the mounted image)
!!!

and run update.bat.

5. Copy over the cracked content (\""Battle.net\"", \""Support\"", \""Versions\"" dirs
and \""StarCraft II.exe\"" file) to the install dir.

6. Play the game =)

If after copying over, the update.bat doesn't work and says 'no patch to apply etc.', what you need to do is run the update.bat from the original iso image or disc, once it's updated, then copy the files over as per instructions, so update first , then copy. However do NOT copy over the starcraft.exe file or the game won't work, so copy the battle.net and other folders but keep the original installed .exe file and everything will work perfectly."

,Jack_Raiden,2010-08-26T06:40Z,"Works exactly as described if you read follow the official instructions in the NFO (with one exception). A user will be created which allows access to entire campaign (with saving). No achievements (obviously), and no skirmishes (without Razor1911 update/keytro). 

Two critical points:
1. DO NOT AUTO UPDATE. As stated in NFO. 
2. COPY ""BLIZZARD UPDATER.EXE"" to destination before running the ""UPDATE.BAT"" batch file. Required for me. Not stated in NFO.

I will definitely be buying this game at a later date to enjoy the full game and support Blizzard. The DRM, reviews and pricing led me here. (Also: Die Activision.)

@hellblaza: Uninstall it all and try again. DO NOT AUTO UPDATE, everyone. Even with Razor1911's release which states to."

,clipandgo,2010-08-30T04:59Z,"Guide to install correctly and play on skrim.
SC2 Install
1.Download this torrent and this crack by razor 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5730029/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper-Razor1911-CrackOnly
2.Open the IMG with damon tools or magiciso.
3.Install when you get asked to register with battle.net while installed simply skip.
4. Once the install is complete I would suggest letting the updater run for a couple of seconds then close..(Make sure not to let it update!!!)
5.Next move all the contents of the crack folder(Besides the battle.net folder)to the game folder(where you installed the game/Make sure not to put the battle.net folder in there)
6.Run the Update batch file.(It will update for a 1 min or 2)
7.Put the contents of the razor crack into the game folder(sc2_copy.exe and sc2_copy.dat and keytro or some shit like that)
8.Run sc2_copy.exe then run keytro.
9. While keytro is running press F2 then ESC to exit it.
10.Done. Now just run Starcraft 2 and enjoy.
11. Sign in as guest and choose razor 1,2 or 3.

Skrim
1. Download 
http://sc2.nibbits.com/assets/starcrack-allin1/
2. Put it where ever you want( I would suggest the game folder)
2.Google sc2 maps
3.Create a folder in the game folder and name it Maps
4. Put all your maps in there
5. RUn sc2allin1 and Load the maps
6. Select your settings and play

I hope this helps out everyone, If you any questions ill try to help you out."

,AppleRoot,2010-09-04T19:59Z,"For those people who receive the error ""There is no patch file to apply"", here was a work around for me, assuming you worked yourself through the first 4 steps of the nfo file:

1. Edit the Update.bat file by right clicking it -> Edit.
2. Change the line ""cd Support"" to ""cd Updates"".
3. Go to Start -> Run or hit Windows Key + R
4. Enter ""cmd"" and hit enter
5. Use the command ""cd C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II\"", without the quotes and obviously use the directory path to where you have installed StarCraft II
6. You should be in the installation directory now. Type in ""Update.bat"" and hit enter.

That should do the trick. Just continue with step 5 from the nfo file. Good luck."
,StopReadMyName,2010-09-05T00:16Z,"IT WORKED FOR ME, but with some minor changes to the RELOADED.NFO. There it is what you have to do:
1. Unrar.
2. Burn or mount the image.
3. Disconnect from the Internet.
4. Install the game. When the game is installed in offline mode, a message will be displayed that you need to be online. Click the orange button to enter a media key: G8MN8UDG6NA2ANGY6A3DNY82HRGF29ZH.
5. Copy all the Crack dir. content to the game dir. Connect to Internet and run update.bat.
6. Copy again the Crack dir content to the install dir.
7. Play the game.

,jszipsp,2010-09-23T02:35Z,"ok guys heres how i did it 
-unplug your internet cable(or turn off your wifi) THIS enables OFFLINE MODE the easiest way

-Install the game. When the game is installed in offline mode, a message will be displayed that you need to be online. Click the orange button to   enter a media key 

-i copped all the contents from the crack folder EXCEPT the starcraft II .exe to the installation dir. and ran the update.bat

-then i coppied over the starcraftII.exe 

swet game launches
now i got to log into battle.net and i dont think i should use my sc1bnet account

@ jszipsp Like most of them I had lots of hits before I could play in single player mode.Thanks to ur comment it helped.

For those who wants to play in single player mode here are the instructions :

1) Either burn or mount with daemon tools.

2) Switch off the net.

3) Install the game by clicking ""installer"".

4) Click the orange colored button & enter the serials that are provided.

5) Copy all contents from the crack folder except ""starcraft II"" to the installed folder and run update.bat.

6) Then copy ""Starcraft II"" & run the game.

7) It'll ask to log in. Exit the game.

8) Copy all contents from the crack folder to ur installed folder again.

9) play the game & enjoy."

guys listen up, I have the universal solution for everyone who's having errors. You don't need to download anything, no cracks, no dodgy methods.

all you need to do is edit your Update.dat as extremezone has said, but change things more thoroughly. unfortunately the instructions in the nfo that comes with the iso is poorly written.

this goes for pretty much 98% of the errors i'm seeing on the comments here and other sites:

Universal Instructions:
1) Install SC2-Reloaded. Cancel auto-update if you're online, or install with media key while offline.
2) Copy EVERYTHING from the Cracks folder over to your Starcraft 2 directory. Yes everything, don't listen to the original instructions.
3) Cut/Move Updates.dat and ""Updates"" folder into your ""Support"" folder (this is where the Blizzard Updater.exe is)
4) Rename Updates.bat to .txt (or open with Notepad) and delete EVERYTHING and replace with this ... :
@echo off
@echo Updating...
cd support
""Blizzard Updater.exe"" --locale=""enGB"" --patchlist=""sc2-1-22280-x86-Win-enGB-bnet-bin"" --patchlist=""sc2-5760-6699-x86-Win-enGB-bnet-base"" --patchlist=""sc2-15405-16117-x86-Win-enGB-campaign"" --patchlist=""sc2-15405-16117-x86-Win-enGB-game"" --patchlist=""sc2-15405-16117-x86-Win-enGB-locale"" 
@echo Done.

Or if you want to do it yourself, all you need to do is remove the ""../Updates/"" before every sc2-xxxx update file.

Now save and close. Rename back to .dat and launch. Starcraft 2 will now update the files from that Updates folder without any errors or auto-close. 

Once update is done, launch Starcraft 2.exe :) "
,extremehelper,2010-09-26T17:12Z,"**** CONTINUED *****

Then after the update has finished (I forgot 1 last step)

Copy all the files from the ""Crack"" folder over to your Starcraft 2 directory AGAIN (1 more time ; 2 times total) and now launch Starcraft 2.exe

it should work like a charm, no game validation required, skips straight to single player screen etc. :)

enjoy guys :)

remember spread the universal instructions, don't download these dodgy cracks or waste your time on lengthy methods, just rename the Update.bat and go with the simple process.

peace."
,extremehelper,2010-09-27T15:54Z,"please everyone try the Universal instructions on page 18 of the comments, you don't need any dodgy cracks or length methods or big extra downloads. just follow simple instructions when editing update.bat and you WILL be able to play! "

------------------------------


NOW, when he mentions put everything into the SUPPORT folder, make sure you move the --contents-- of the UPDATE directory (copy paste) into the SUPPORT folder as well (in addition to update.bat, the one you edited as per above), and not just the directory. Or else it can't find the updates.

,selryam,2010-11-18T21:20Z,"I had a good bit of trouble with this one but I got it to work. The instructions given didn't help at all. Maybe this will help someone not have such a headache. 

1. Extract the many lty-sc2ret files into a single .iso image.

2. Use a virtual drive such as Daemon tools to mount the .iso 

3. run the installer file. I actually had a hard problem getting that file to load, I would click on it and it would start to load and nothing would happen. I fixed this problem by copying the entire cd onto my harddrive and running the installer from my computer.

4. click to skip activation when your installing.

5. After its done installing let it update.

6. Enter the game then exit it again.

7. From the LiBERTY folder on the .iso

put the SC2 file in the C:\Program Files\StarCraft II\Versions\Base15405 folder and replace the one in the folder.

put the Battle.net-patch file into the C:\Program Files\StarCraft II\Battle.net folder and replace the one in the folder.

8. From this point on the game will try to update if you run the game. You dont want it to update again so you either hafta play the game offline or halt that program from the internet with your firewall. If it does update I think you can fix it by copying the LiBERTY files back over again.

Ok... first of, you can NOT save with the Liberty version.
Now, i got it working for Win XP pro SP3 64 and it works like charm, but the .nfo isn't very precise so here is what you have to do:

1. Unrar
2. Mount image
3. run installer exe
*I did the setup while online to the internet but i guess it's the same as offline (except from the part of enterning the media key)
4. After the install is done the autoupdate window will pop up.... close it ASAP
5. Go to the crack folder.... copy ALL THE FILES except of the update.bat and paste them in the game folder (make sure you replaced ALL THE FILES)
6. Then go to the crack folder again and run update.bat
7. After update is over, go to the crack folder and copy ALL THE FILES one more time, and paste them to the game folder again (basically you replace ALL THE FILES for a 2nd time after update)
8. Enjoy the game
*If you run the game and it asks for a battlenet acount you did something of the above wrong... (i did at first aswell, so try makin all the steps right)

*For all those who ask if this version supports multiplayer... its a PIRATED version so NO... it doesn't

*Also, saves work 100%

Hope this helped "

,jeffabe3,2010-12-27T11:06Z,"Finally found the best crack here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5971047/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_v1.1.3_Update-RazorDOX-[tracker.BT
No need for other programs like the SC2allinone.
Fully working Campaign and Skirmish modes on the game itself.


To everyone having problems this is how i did it:
1. Install any fresh copy of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty (Fresh install to remove all the previous cracks)
2. After installing stop the game from updating
3. Run SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch from the download
4. Run Keygen as Administrator (THIS IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE GUEST ACCOUNT WORKING!)
   (To run as admin on XP simply shift+double click)
   Click OK then QUIT.
5. Run sc2_copy
6. To play the game, use the SC2Switcher.exe located at the install folder starcraftII>support to prevent the game from updating.


Windows xP/7
Starcraft II enGB version, not tested on enUS."

now i take the folders (listed in step 5) created from the install and over wright the ones in the cracked group of folders with them including the .exe file.
now i try to play the game and it updates.. for a long time... and then i press the play button and all i can do is nuthin. i have to sine into a blizzard account, so hesitantly i do... and i have to register the game with a CD key with my account. this is all i can do, i just wanted to play the campaign and offline AI skirmishes to try it out for a bit.
i know im doing something wrong like how i dont run the ""update.bat"" file.
but i dont know how, its not there. if anyone can help me id appreciate it. this is my first time trying this out and its not as easy as i thought it be. i also have a hard time understanding the instructions"

Completely reinstall the game.

Double click on updates.bat and let the game update.

Copy all files and folders in the crack folder except the updates.dir and paste them in the folder where you installed the game.DO NOT COPY AND PASTE THE UPDATE.DIR folder the game will not work if u do that."

4: Go to the lower right and then press ""map sites...""

6: Launch in map-editor (and edit map if you feel like it - not recoomended though.)

7: find the saved map in SC2ALLin
Then the best part;

8: add the number of players, your class, difficulty etc, and PRESS LAUNCH! :D

Installing? Playing? Bugs?

If you have problems playing it;
1: Reinstall the game, stop the update before it starts.
2: copy the ""Updates"" folder and the ""update.bat"" file into the folder on C: where you installed it.
3: Run the update, and THEN put the other files (Battle.net, support, Starcraft II.exe and Versions folders into install folder)
4: play =)

Still problems? "

Installation went as followed:
Mount rld-scii with Daemon
Intall; click the little orange button (looks like an orange yield sign in the bottom right corner of the install window) this prompts the key entry

After game is installed it got a little tricky....

1) Copy all the files in the crack folder to the Starcraft Directory on your comp
MAKE SURE THE CRACKED ""UPDATES"" FOLDER TRANSFERED OVER TO THE STARCRAFT DIRECTORY

2) click the update batch file approx 1kb
    this will open a command prompt window     followed by updates

3)  REPEAT THE CRACK PROCESS AGAIN BY MOVING ALL THE CRACKED CONTENT INTO THE STARCRAFT DIRECTORY!!!!! this will stop it from asking you for a login!!!!!

MAKE SURE STARCRAFT IS NOT RUNNING WHEN YOU REPEAT THE CRACK PROCESS

kamutef:
Guys, managed to get this working but you need to make some adjustments:
If after copying over, the update.bat doesn't work and says 'no patch to apply etc.', what you need to do is run the update.bat from the original iso image or disc, once it's updated, then copy the files over as per instructions, so update first , then copy. However do NOT copy over the starcraft.exe file or the game won't work, so copy the battle.net and other folders but keep the original installed .exe file and everything will work perfectly.

Thanks kamutef xD. "

3. a) disconnect ethernet cable or disable your network adapter.
b) Install the game. A message
   will be displayed that you need to be online. Click the orange exclamation button to
   enter a media key: Get it from the NFO file.
4. From the ""crack"" directory copy ""updates"", ""support"", ""Versions"" and ""Battle.net"" directories and ""update.bat"" file to the directory where you installed the game.  Run the ""update.bat"" file.
5. After updating, copy the ""Battle.net"", ""Support"", ""Versions"" dirs
   and ""StarCraft II.exe"" file again to the directory where you installed the game.
6. Re-enable your internet, etc.
7. Play the game
Enjoy."

You'll probably be able to work out all the problems before you've even downloaded the torrent.

2. After installation is completed close the auto updater.
3. Copy ALL of the files from the crack folder to the install dir.
4. Double click on ""StarCraft II"" in the install dir and play the game.
NB: I tried running ""update.bat"" before playing the first couple of times I installed the game but it wanted me to log in to play. DO NOT run this file after copying the cracked files across and it should work fine straight away."

the hell you are doing. Seriously just go buy these games and save the rest of us 

who know what we are doing the hassle of reading your half wit comments about how 

you can't get something to work or that there is a ""virus"". Most torrents contain 

everything needed to run the program (unless otherwise stated) 

1. Get firefox with noscript, adblock, ghostery, betterprivacy.
2. Get peerblock and figure out how it works.
3. Get a firewall program (legitimately pay for it) like Zone Alarm or something 

that allows you to prevent these programs from calling to it's home website further 

making things hard for you to use the software or having it disabled.

This is just basic stuff I'm sure others can add to this incomplete list of ways to 

not have problems with torrented files. The main thing is to use that thing between 

your ears and learn how to have reading comprehension and study skills."
,P0tH34D,2011-07-15T21:35Z,"Hey guys, 1st of all thanks to the uploaders, i will seed as much i can. 

Also thanks to ""VittGen"", he originally posted this and he helped me a lot since i had troubles.

This is what you have to do, (worked for me in no time):

Ok... first of, you can NOT save with the Liberty version.
Now, i got it working for Win XP pro SP3 64 and it works like charm, but the .nfo isn't very precise so here is what you have to do:

1. Unrar
2. Mount image
3. run installer exe
*I did the setup while online to the internet but i guess it's the same as offline (except from the part of enterning the media key)
4. After the install is done the autoupdate window will pop up.... close it ASAP
5. Go to the crack folder.... copy ALL THE FILES except of the update.bat and paste them in the game folder (make sure you replaced ALL THE FILES)
6. Then go to the crack folder again and run update.bat
7. After update is over, go to the crack folder and copy ALL THE FILES one more time, and paste them to the game folder again (basically you replace ALL THE FILES for a 2nd time after update)
8. Enjoy the game
*If you run the game and it asks for a battlenet acount you did something of the above wrong... (i did at first aswell, so try makin all the steps right)

*For all those who ask if this version supports multiplayer... its a PIRATED version so NO... it doesn't

*Also, saves work 100%

,slimy79,2011-07-29T23:25Z,"Hey! Great upload & seed guys, thanks!

I almost have it working perfectly. I did as P0tH34D said and everything seemed to be working out. Opening movie sequence where Mr. Dude is gettin' strapped into his suit/prison deal. Very cool.

Then I'm taken to what I'm sure is supposed to be the main menu: kind of a spacey background with a Saturn-looking planet back there, epic music, stars or space dust whizzing across the screen, but, that's it. There are no buttons, no options, nothing to click. It's a blank screen. I can't even 'escape' out or minimize the screen; I have to cntl+alt+del in order to activate my task manager just to leave the screen. 

I'd appreciate some further help or suggestions; or even if no one knows it'd be cool to get an 'lol' outta somebody at least. Heh.

Thanks in advance!"

,kwong,2011-08-25T20:37Z,"elturbo9077 -
It sounds like you made the error of letting the software connect online, where it automatically updated beyond the 1.1.3 Keypro crack.

If so, it is best to reinstall (all offline!).   Then follow the directions in the separate 1.1.3 update download for the OFFLINE update and crack.  It may help to disconnect your network cable to make sure you stay offline.

Be sure to NEVER make a link to starcraft.exe.  Instead ONLY use links to SC2Switcher.exe (offline Blizzard melee maps) or to SC2ALLin1.exe (for downloaded maps).

Every 30 days, you will see the message that you ""must"" log on online to authenticate.  No problem here, just a minor annoyance.  Rerun the Keygen.exe that comes with the 1.1.3 update, and the problem goes away for another 30 days.  

I find it convenient to keep a ""Starcraft 2"" folder on my desktop with links to SC2Switcher.exe, SC2Switcher.exe, and Keygen.exe, as well as notes I make to myself about the game and various maps."

Starcraft II has a trial version and a full version (similar to WoW) and you need a battle.net account for both of these.
This will simply grant you the free version which has limited maps and multiplayer, due to blizzards online authentication, and is probably used by people who can't get the blizzard downloader to work.
If getting a slow speed just head over to battle net eu or us and grab it for free to try before buying (yes blizzard are greedy bastards but they are fair.)

After a few trials and errors, this is what worked for me:

Do this:
1. Unrar.
2. Burn or mount the image.
3. Kill your internet connection (or tell your firewall not to let the installer have internet access when it asks to in the next step, it doesn't matter which, just don't let it get out).
4. Install the game. When the game is installed in offline mode, a message will be displayed that you need to be online. Click the orange button to enter the media key: G8MN8UDG6NA2ANGY6A3DNY82HRGF29ZH.
5. Copy over the update files (the ""updates"" folder and the ""update.bat"" file) to the folder where you installed the game (the one suggested by the game installer is a ""Starcraft II"" folder in ""C:\Program Files"" for 32bit systems or ""C:\Program Files (x86)"" for 64bit ones).
6. Copy over the cracked content (""Battle.net"", ""Support"", ""Versions"" folders and ""StarCraft II.exe"" file) to the folder where you installed the game.
7. Run ""update.bat"".
8. Repeat step 5, i.e. ""Copy over the cracked content (""Battle.net"", ""Support"", ""Versions"" folder and ""StarCraft II.exe"" file) to the folder where you installed the game""
9. Play the game.
10. When you can, buy it.

1. Unrar (Nevermind this one, just mount.)
2. Mount image
3. run installer exe

5. Go to the crack folder.... copy ALL THE FILES except of the update.bat and paste them in the game folder (make sure you replaced ALL THE FILES)
6. Then go to the crack folder again and run update.bat
7. After update is over, go to the crack folder and copy ALL THE FILES one more time, and paste them to the game folder again (basically you replace ALL THE FILES for a 2nd time after update)

,mvanzie,2012-03-10T22:02Z,"To begin the installation, you need to be connected to the internet.
When installation begins then disconnect from the internet immediatlty
when you are prompted to activate your game online, then simply choose the ""skip"" option.
When the installation is complete it will say finish and come off the screen

Go to your insatllation directory and follow these instructions

	1.	copy over the ""updates"" folder from the cracked folder
	2.	Copy over the update.bat file from the cracked folder.
	3.	copy over the ""support"" folder from the cracked folder.
	4.	Run the update.bat file. A black screen will pop up saying (updating) followed by another smaller screen
    		that shows progress of the files being updated.								
	5.	This will close after it is finish.
	6.	Now copy over the ""versions"" folder and the ""battle.net"" folder from the cracked folder.
	7.	Finally, copy over the ""starCraft2.exe"" folder from the cracked folder.
	8. 	Run the exe file and play the game. Only the campaign option is available.
		If this does not work, then you did something wrong along the way and you should uninstall and re-install
		following the instructions properly.
After all of this you can turn back on your internet and have no problems. I would suggest not updating if you are ever prompted to do so.
I havent been prompted but i just started playing.
Lastly, when you close off and come back at another time to play, you don't start the game from the ""exe"" file because you won't be able 
to load your saved file, you'd have to start from the begining. TO start from a saved spot go to the StarCraftII folder in you ""Documents"" folder
you can access your saved or unsaved files from there.

,KC_Dopey,2012-04-15T09:09Z,"i`ve been looking through all the pages...and was quite shocked...people just really seem retarded or mentally ill if nearly everyone has problems with installing and running this game

so i`m gonna do a full insruction all by myself, just so you all blockheads know how to play this...here we go

1.get a F&^$*% new COMPUTER(coz many errors are coming just coz u have low pc, or low drivers or s^%t like that) and also Windows 7 is preferrable for gaming

2.Mount the WinRar folder u`ve downloaded with POWERISO ( if u r using Daemon tools or s#$% like that u cud just aswell die, coz the program F#$$&%^ sucks and many stuff u mount with that will probably have issues and bugs)

3.Install the game( i strongly recommend to any  except C(or where your windows files are) - just dont download there, thats all)-i recommend downloading online, just make sure u STOP the auto-update before its finished,and even if u already updated like 3% or smth like that-doesnt matter

4.Go to the file u`ve DOWNLOADED, extract all the content from CRACK folder into some new folder created anywhere possible

5.COPY the #updates# folder and update.bat and PASTE them into the directory with the game u`ve INSTALLED, overcopying every file

6.(VERY IMPORTANT STEP!!!!) after u`ve copied the updates, make sure u go to your game INSTALLED and run update.bat and update da sH$T- ye and if u do this step before or after some others, game wont run at all, haha

7.Copy and paste all the rest files from your NEW FOLDER with cracked content into the INSTALLED game directory, overcopying every file of course

8.run the game. Strange thing was, when i run dat exe. file (F&^$^%&^ OVERCOPIED ONE) from the ACTUAL folder, the screen just turned white so just close all your folders, go to your desktop and run the game from there

9. HAVE FUN!!!"

,shizello,2012-04-21T19:03Z,"I have a downloaded copy of SCII Liberty RELOADED and a copy of 

Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_v1.1.3_Update-RazorDOX (the separate 1.1.3 patch 

update by Razor) and I was able to install SC2 with campaign and skirmish AI 

available to guest mode.

The missing in-game clock in this RELOADED version (1.0.3) was bothering me, and 

I didnt want to download another 7gb so here's how to update to the ver 1.1.3 of the 

game.

After you download the torrent here, download: (around 200mb only!)
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5971047/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_v1.1.3_Updat

e-RazorDOX-[tracker.BT

Then the installation of everything:
==StarCraft II Wings of Liberty-RELOADED part==
1) Disconnect Internet
2) Mount rld-scii.iso
3) Run Installer.exe

When the ""Unable to Connect"" message appears, click the small orange triangle in 

the lower right of the window and enter:
G8MN8UDG6NA2ANGY6A3DNY82HRGF29ZH

After 100% install, skip the activation screen, and the game closes.

Now nevermind the other files inside the RELOADED version, onto the next...

==Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_v1.1.3_Update-RazorDOX part==
4) Open the .001 file using Winrar and extract it somewhere
5) Inside the extracted folder, run SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch. It will finish patching til 

1.1.3 only.
6) Run sc2_copy.exe in Razor1911 folder
7) Once finished, run Keygen.exe in Razor1911 folder, press OK and ""license 

generated"" will appear
8) Run SC2Switcher.exe inside your StarCraft IISupport folder, located in your 

installation directory of StarCraft II (in Program Files, most likely)
9) Login as Guest and choose Razor 1, Razor 2, or Razor 3

If it asks to create an account since you cannot run as guest in offline mode, keep 

trying step 6 just to make sure the keygen is installed."
