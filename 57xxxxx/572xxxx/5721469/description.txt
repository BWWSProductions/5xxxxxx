So why do you need Starcraft II? Well, 11 million Starcraft fans can't be
wrong. The original Starcraft made its debut in 1998, and it quickly became
one of the most popular real-time strategy games of all time. Since then,
we've been waiting with bated breath for the sequel, which has been hinted
at and teased since its official announcement in 2007. So why did it take
so long? Because that is precisely how long it took to fill it with the
perfect amount of awesome. It's a continuation of the epic struggle between
the human Terrans, the insect-like Zerg and the psionic Protoss. Fans of
the original will see some familiar faces, as well as a cast of new heroes
as they do battle across the galaxy with veteran, upgraded and brand new
unit types. To remain consistent with the game's new-millennium feel, the
Battle.net gaming service has been completely revamped to offer noticeable
enhancements and new features in multiplayer mode. The fun of Starcraft II
is not limited to those who played the first Starcraft, however. Even if
you were a toddler when the first game came out, you'll be able to choose
your faction and jump right into the fray.
