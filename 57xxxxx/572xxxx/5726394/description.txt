Police Chief Jesse Stone, who was suspended by the Paradise, Mass. Town Council, 
begins moonlighting for his friend, State Homicide Commander Healy, by investigating 
a series of murders in Boston, leaving Rose and Suitcase to handle a crime spree in 
Paradise on their own. Jesse pours his energy into his work in an effort to push away 
his twin demons: booze and women. When his investigation leads to notorious mob 
boss Gino Fish, Jesse's pursuit becomes hazardous.
