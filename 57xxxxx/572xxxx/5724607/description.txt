ADOBE PHOTOSHOP PLUGINS 

Toonit 

An easy way to give your photos that sought-after cartoon look.
ToonIt! Photo uses Toonamation technology to process your image and create
cartoon effects like shading and lines. This Adobe Photoshop cartoon plugin
frees you from time consuming techniques like rotoscoping and hand painting.

An easy-to-use interface and custom controls give you unlimited flexibility.
Pre-made combinations of cartoon settings get you started quickly. No other
cartooning solution produces such good results, especially with faces and
figures.
