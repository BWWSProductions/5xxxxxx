Robert Jordan & Brandon Sanderson  - Wheel of Time 12 - The Gathering Storm
The (kdx) pdf file will read well on a kindledx without having to scroll the screen or read horizontally.

There is also a normal size version of the book that is tidied up for people that just want a nice clean copy of the book and dont have a kindle.

I got sick of always reading my PDFs horizontally and I cant get any file conversions programs to work reliably. The kindle can automatically crop white space so I figured out a simple way to make PDFs look nice on the kindle, Its pretty obvious what I did when you open the (kdx) file.

All the other versions of book 12 were a mess, I spent a long time cleaning this up. There are still two words in itallics at the start of some chapter that I couldnt decipher.. but in general it is a very clean copy.


I have also included rtf/doc format so you arent locked in to my PDF choices.

My seeding will be erratic so be patient.
