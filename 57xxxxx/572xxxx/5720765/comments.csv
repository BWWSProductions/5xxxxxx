,crowie1985,2010-07-28T15:56Z,does this have subs for non english parts?
,ianpark01,2010-07-28T21:29Z,Are subs hardcoded for non english parts and does it have the edited/censored scenes ?
,sammmytm,2010-07-28T22:46Z,"i downloaded it. Its real yet its 127 minutes. and imdb says its supposed to be 140 mins so im guessing those scnes are cut.. and it comes with english subs. 

For a dvd rip... V:8-9 A: 9.5"
,kilx,2010-07-29T01:56Z,"same as r6 and, no on hardcoded"
,ianpark01,2010-07-29T02:44Z,Cheers for the info troops much appreciated ;)
,Madmovies,2010-08-03T02:12Z,Forget this one. The aspect ratio is WRONG.
