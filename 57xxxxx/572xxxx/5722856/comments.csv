Before creating Start Menu 7 program, Author spent a lot of time to understand how a human brain works with visual information. That?s why Start Menu 7 is so easy and natural to use for everybody. The list of menu items is alphabetically sorted, so you can easily find any program or command by its name. Open any location on your PC with a single click.

You can create, modify, and reorder items in Start Menu 7. So it?s easy to create a list of the most used locations, popular directories, and virtual folders to access them with a single click.
There is a special Run button to access seldom used locations without adding them into menu.
Start Menu 7 has a customizable Power Buttons panel.
With Power Timer feature you can delay any of power management operations.
