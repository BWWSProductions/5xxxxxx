I collected the songs I like of my favourite gospelgroup during the last 10 years. This quartet was very famous during the period 1930-1960. See also information in WIKIPEDIA. Not of all the songs have a good sound quality. Some songs I recorded it from AFN Bremerhafen on the mediumwave years ago. 

So I hope you will enjoy these songs.
