Battle Stations: Corsair - Pacific Warrior

Its strange bent wings and long nose made the Corsair one of the most distinctive fighter planes. First flown in 1940, it was the world's fastest single-engine fighter, with a diving speed of more than 500 m.p.h. Designed for use on aircraft carriers; it proved too hot to handle during deck landing. Adopted for land use, Marine Corsair pilots decimated the Japanese Air Force in the Solomon Islands. Finally, Corsairs went back to sea and defended the Navy from kamikaze attack.
