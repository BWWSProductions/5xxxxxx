Guitar hero Robin Trower, has often been compared to the late Jimi Hendrix,
for his Strat-fueled bluesy/psychedelic style. Trower, launched his career in
the 60s with band Procol Harum, he then went onto launch his solo career
signed to Chrysalis records.

Robin Trower initially found fame in the late 1960s as the guitarist with
Procol Harum, recording six albums before embarking on a solo career in
1973. Forming the Robin Trower Band with Scottish bassist and vocalist
James Dewar, formerly a member of Frankie Miller's band as well as Stone
The Crows, and drummer Reg Isidore, this line-up recorded Trower's debut
Twice Removed From Yesterday in 1973, followed by his breakthrough hit
Bridge Of Sighs the following year. With a title track later covered by both
Metallica and Opeth, the album was a US Top 10 hit. Reg Isidore was
replaced by former Gypsy and Sly And The Family Stone drummer Bill
Lordan for 1975's For Earth Below, which, like Robin Trower's previous three
albums was produced by former Procol band-mate Matthew Fischer.
Originally recorded for radio broadcast on the Swedish Broadcasting
Corporation at Stockholm's Concert Hall on 3rd February 1975, Robin
Trower Live captures the power trio at the height of their collective powers,
with Dewar's bluesey vocals and Trower's Hendrix inspired guitar licks to the
fore. This set is completed by their fifth release, 1976's Long Misty Days. A
Tale Untold: The Chrysalis Years 1973-1976 is augmented by the rare bside,
'Take A Fast Train', single edits of 'Day of The Eagle', and 'Long Misty
Days', previously unavailable on CD, and finishes with the previously
unreleased 'Let Me Be The One', a rare outtake from Long Misty Days.
