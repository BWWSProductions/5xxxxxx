Release Notes

Source: Toy.Story.3.2010.TC.720p.x264-CiRiTH [THANKS!]

English Hard Coded subs for non English Parts. According to source nfo it was
taken from a dual-1080p chinese telecine containing two video streams side by
side and cropped down to just one. Very Nice Job guys!

OK,well it has some ghosting issues,not much could be done there. Adjusted
colors,sharpeness,contrast,etc. PrisM's LiNE was used(Thanks guys!). Not sure
who actually synced it,but thanks to them to. Video is actually really nice
and does however have the occasional Chinese subs at the bottom of the screen
However,should do until retail is around. Enjoy!=]
