"If I Die Young" is the title of a song written by Kimberly Perry and recorded by American country group The Band Perry. It was released as their second single in June 2010, and serves as the lead-off single to the group's self-titled debut album, which will be released on October 5, 2010.

The music video, which was directed by David McClister, premiered on CMT on May 27, 2010. In the video, the band is shown setting Kimberly Perry in a canoe before pushing it off into the river. Kimberly's mother and her love interest are shown plucking flower petals and visibly depressed that she has left them. Eventually, her canoe begins to take on water, and her brothers come back for her. When she gets back to her house, her mother and love interest embrace her. Throughout the video, the band is also shown performing with their instruments inside of the house.

"If I Die Young" debuted at #57 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of May 29, 2010. It also debuted at #92 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of July 24, 2010.

"If I Die Young" is a mid-tempo accompanied by acoustic guitar, banjo, and fiddle. The song's female narrator describes being content with the life she has lived, assuring others that if she were to pass away at her young age, that she would have no regrets. She recognizes that once she's gone, that people will seem to notice her absence: "And maybe then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear the words I been singinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ / Funny when you're dead how people start listeninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢." So, she states that "if [she] die[s] young," then her family left behind should "save [their tears] for a time when [they're] really gonna need them."

The Band Perry is an American country music band composed of Kimberly Perry (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano) and her two brothers: Reid Perry (bass guitar, background vocals) and Neil Perry (mandolin, drums, accordion, background vocals). The group signed to Republic Nashville in August 2009 and has released two singles: "Hip to My Heart" and "If I Die Young." Both songs will be included on the band's self-titled debut album, slated for release in October 2010.
