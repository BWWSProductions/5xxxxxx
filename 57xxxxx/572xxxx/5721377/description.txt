The Arrivals 

This Series Explores the Revelations in World Religions Regarding the Arrivals 
of the Antichrist Dajjal, Imam Al-Mahdi, and The Second Coming of The Christ. A 
Work Inspired by Hashemsfilms and of Course the Words of the Noble Qoran, The 
Holy Bible, and The Torah, The Arrivals is a Joint Production by truthseekers 
Noreagaaa, Mani Shah and Achernahr.

One God, One Original Msg. and that is the ultimate truth. a truth that does not 
benefit those in power.

We expect to be attacked with discrediting campaigns from various parties who 
are not in favor of The Arrivals or the Divine Book gaining such a wide 
audience. We believe that the genuine viewers understood what our films 
represented, & will be able to see through the lies, propaganda, & personal 
attacks, to focus on the positive and uniting msg we worked hard to deliver. 
If I have shed any light, or exposed any meaningful truth that has helped 
improve this world in any way, then all the credit is due to Allah(God) the 
absolute Creator, and only the mistakes have been mine.
