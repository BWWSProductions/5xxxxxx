Navdesk 5.55.003 (2008)

Unfortunately, this is the newest version I have so I hope it will help anyone with a lost or damaged disc. As we all may know Navman support is almost non existent for those of us who have already paid.

Adobe reader has been removed from this file as it is outdated now and newer a version is available from here: http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/

This is my first torrent so if all goes well, look out for further releases from me.

Good luck,
