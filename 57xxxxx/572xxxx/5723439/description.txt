Andreas Scholl her performs a varied selection of English songs, accompanied by viol consort.  These are interspersed with instrumental-only works.

This is one of the finer CDs of this repertoire.  There are a couple of well-known pieces here, but most are undeservedly less well-known.  The recording quality is excellent, and Scholl is his usual brilliant self.  Quite a bit of texture here, but as always, I end up thinking that he is almost too perfect - a little more abandon would not have gone amiss (he even whistles well!  Track 11 ...).  Anyhow, I can highly recommend this CD.  Some really yummy stuff here :)
