Get Cape Wear Cape Fly
With a moniker taken from a computer game and a laptop for a backing band, 20-year-old Sam Duckworth is a very modern social commentator. An angry young man fired by his desire to escape his Southend home, Duckworth documents the ills of ignorance, prejudice and mass consumption; his brand of folktronica shares more than just its Essex roots with Jamie Cullum and Billy Bragg. "Don't let people make you think just because you're young, you're useless," Duckworth sings in Once More With Feeling, and his maturity is never in doubt. Turning campfire protests contemporary, he injects acoustic rhythms with broken beats, and emboldens retro keyboard melodies with violin and trumpet over his raw, rasping vocals. Duckworth's style can get a little samey, but his passion is infectious. Rating: 4/5
