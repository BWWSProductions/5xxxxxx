As part of our commitment to long time support, Salix Live 13.0.1 is now available for download.
Salix Live 13.0.1 is a maintenance release made with all the software that was present in Salix 13.0.2a standard iso. This includes Salix new GTK system tools, as well as any bugfix & security upgrades that have been added to Salix 13.0 stable repository. Salix Live installer & LiloSetup also benefited from a number of improvements, various bugfix & new translations.
We hope this release will be useful to anyone still using Salix 13.0 series either by choice or necessity. With it we are closing our 'Live' development cycle for that series & will now fully pool our resources towards SalixLive 13.1 for which BTW an alpha iso should be available for testing sometime in the next few days.
