[V],globeplus,2010-07-30T18:09Z,"This game was requested here and there for some users at my blog then i decided to take a look and see the possible work on the game and the game is really fun with many missions in a GTA syle environment then i tought that the lot of fans of the GTA games out there didn?t mind probably to take a look on this one and the game was worked too by the Rockstar Games like for GTAs , s i think if you are a gamer that like GTA games , you will not be disappointed taking a look on the gameplay of this one . Play and enjoy this funny Rockstar game ... "
[V],globeplus,2010-07-30T18:16Z,"The final size that i get is really positive , with everything nice and intact i get less 1.3 gb than the original pc-dvd iso , it is in directplay style , the user only needs to run a executable to be playing the game .
Watch videos about the game including a little bit of the gameplay in the next link :

[V],globeplus,2010-07-30T18:34Z,"The globeliveshow is not me making streaptease or something , the included videos are recorded live and then the available videos stay in the channel player to be watched anytime by the users , i decided to create this extra link in the way that watching a little bit of the gameplay of the games or useful videos can be interesting and praical from the point of view of the user while downloading the file for example , so if i find something that in someway can be useful to the users i make the work , not really beeing worried about number of viewers but the games videos recorded are in there to the possible viewers watch anytime they want . Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-07-30T18:56Z,Just a quick question in the perspective of the possible viewer : CAN BE NICE OR NOT TO TAKE A LOOK ABOUT THE GAME INCLUDING THE GAMEPLAY THAT YOU ARE DOWNLOADING IN A NICE AND EASY WAY ?
[V],globeplus,2010-07-30T21:35Z,I HAVE THE WALKTHROUGH AND A LITTLE BIT OF THE GAMEPLAY TO BE WATCHED IN THE LIVESTREAM FOR THIS GAME . enjoy your game ...
,ishist,2010-07-31T16:42Z,The .ARC was corrupted
[V],globeplus,2010-07-31T17:33Z,"To ishist :  you need a restart of the computer and try again the extraction , the background applications probably consumed necessary ram to the extraction be executed correctly , in jast case if even with that the extraction don?t work just reeinstall the freearc program , one way or another you will get the file extracted but dont forget that is necessary close 1 gb ram to make the extraction ."
,hiteshbisht16,2010-08-01T10:17Z,"thx globe for this game i never herd of this game before just checked out its gameplay and it looks good :)

,Dacard,2010-10-21T02:38Z,"Hey Globe, just want to say fantastic rips, I have been Following your work for a while now, every single one I have has worked, needing only a little playing around to get it working (huge fan of your just cause 2 rip).

I wanted to know if you can get a 1.20 patch out and working for this rip, it fixes so many problems.

IF YOU ARE MISSING TEXTURES, there is a kinda crappy fix (but worth it for this game) you have to limit you memory
 (windows key + R) then type msconfig in the window, you need to limit to 2000 or less, works for me."

,Humankillerx,2010-12-20T07:33Z,So I downloaded the Freearc software but it's not working. It just gets stuck at 0.1%. I don't know how to fix it.
,zumbajovi,2010-12-28T23:58Z,"No problems with instalation, but the game works just a few seconds, after i reached the Headmasters room and watched the scene, starts a load that never ends. I tried 3 times. 
Even in a short gameplay you can see a lot of graphical bugs, but if the gameplay works fine I donĂÂ´t care about it.
Using win7 64 bits, i5 + 4 gb ram + video 5770."
,noysecomplaint,2011-01-17T23:27Z,"Everytime I try running it, it says ""This application has failed to start because XINPUT1_3.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."" Do you have to install it first? Cause there's no installation of any sort there. Can anyone help? I've tried extracting it 3 times, restarted my computer, uninstalled freearc and installed it again. Nothing seems to work."
