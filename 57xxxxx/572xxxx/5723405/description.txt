Finally got a hold of the audio book. It is unabridged. This book is a great start to finish history of America neither condemning the founders and framers nor avoiding their faults in context. Let the reader decide.

A final note, my connection is sluggish so, I expect it will take a while to seed the full book but be patient. I will not stop seeding.
