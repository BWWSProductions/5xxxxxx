,sjorsbig1,2010-08-02T17:02Z,"i can't install it:(
it says: nova could not be installed on this phone.
i have an xperia x10 from sony ericsson and it has android 1.6.
does anyone know a solution?

[T],xxThugxx,2010-08-02T17:51Z,yeah i think you may need eclair+ the 3D drivers were shit on donut 
,king_nothing_,2010-08-03T12:12Z,"This worked the first time I ran it, and then after that I got the ""this is not an original copy of N.O.V.A"" error message.  Uninstalling and reinstalling did not help.  And no, I didn't forget to turn on airplane mode.

Any ideas?"
[T],xxThugxx,2010-08-03T15:49Z,"this is one of the newer gameloft games, with there hyped up drm, it causing all sorts of trouble, the best i can suggest for now is, to go to settings/application, find nova in the list and clear the data, then make sure you put your device in aeroplane mode every time befor you run it and it wont check with the gameloft servers, i know its not a fix but it works lol"
,0lVoiDl0,2010-09-02T04:44Z,"I got the same thing using a samsung epic. 

Moved nova to the games folder then installed the .apk

I left airplane mode on the whole time. Tried starting the app with airplane mode still on. Game required airplane mode to be turned off. Closed app turned airplane mode off started app got ""this is not the original copy of n.o.v.a"".

I guess the workaround does not work on all phones or just HTC phones."
,0lVoiDl0,2010-09-02T04:52Z,Also there is nothing to clear in app settings after the app stops working so unless you have an HTC device don't bother.
,doggywuff12345,2010-10-05T13:33Z,"yeah do a hack for devices with omap procesors becuase most of your other uploads are for devices with snapdragon processors.

But thanks for everything else Thug, most of your uploads work fine"
,shadwphox,2010-12-10T00:40Z,i have the android 2 and this download does not work at all. :/ dude
