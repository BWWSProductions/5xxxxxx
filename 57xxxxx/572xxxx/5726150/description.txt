People seemed to like the last rare book, so here is the sequel to the legendary 'Issue at Hand' from James Blish. Some brilliant deconstructions of A.E. Merritt, Theodore Sturgeon, Algis Budrys, and others. This is one of those books I find myself re-reading time and time again, and decided I needed an electronic copy of. Enjoy!
