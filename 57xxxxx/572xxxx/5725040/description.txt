Leatherneck Magazine of the Marines (or simply Leatherneck) is a magazine for United States Marines. Its name derives from the slang "leatherneck" for a U.S. Marine, referring to the leather-lined collar or stock of the original Marine uniform. It was first published as a newspaper by off-duty Marines at Marine Corps Base Quantico in 1917, and was originally named The Quantico Leatherneck. In 1920, Leatherneck became an official Marine Corps publication under the auspices of MCI, and was moved to Headquarters Marine Corps in Washington, D.C. In 1925, the format was changed from a newspaper to a magazine. During World War II, many of the Marine Corps' combat correspondents were assigned to Leatherneck. Leatherneck Magazine of the Marines is frequently referred to as the Reader's Digest for the Marine Corps because of its broad content range telling the Marine Corps story, yesterday, today and tomorrow.
