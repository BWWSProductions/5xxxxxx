"Auditions #1"

Famed chef Gordon Ramsay conducted a nationwide 
search for the best home cooks in America, and 
through a series of exciting elimination 
rounds, will turn one of them into a culinary 
master. Joining Ramsay on the judging panel are 
restaurateur and wine maker Joe Bastianich, 
owner of some of the most-celebrated Italian 
restaurants across the country; and Graham 
Elliot, the youngest four-star chef in the U.S. 
and mastermind behind Chicago's first 
"bistronomic" restaurant. In the series 
premiere episode, home cooks from all over the 
country present their signature dishes to the 
three judges in the hopes of being awarded the 
coveted MASTERCHEF apron, which guarantees them 
a spot in the next round of competition.

Enjoy :)
