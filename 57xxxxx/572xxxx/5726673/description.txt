Like Sam Jackson was the model for Nick Fury in the Ultimate Marvel universe, DJ Sinatra has cast Notorious BIG as his Ultimate Kingpin. This album is all 100% exclusive blends and interludes from DJ Sinatra, so you know how that is; no yelling in the middle of the track, no crap and a wicked package deal. Enjoy.
