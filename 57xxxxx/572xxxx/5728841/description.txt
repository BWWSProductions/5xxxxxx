PLOT

A new Disc Jockey is shipped from Crete to Vietnam to bring humor to Armed Forces Radio. He turns the studio on it's ear and becomes wildly popular with the troops but runs afoul of the middle management who think he isn't G.I. enough. While he is off the air, he tries to meet Vietnamese especially girls, and begins to have brushes with the real war that never appears on the radio.


REVIEW

I wasn't alive to witness most of the key events of what is happening in GMV, but I had a good understranding of it. I have to admit everytime I see it the movie always makes me laugh. But I imagin if you know the events of Nixon, the Vietnam war, the pope and the other events mentioned in Good Morning Vietnam, you will only find it funnier. Robin Williams plays Airman Adrian Cronaure, a DJ with a sense of humor that always makes everyone smile. He is brought into a military radio station to do morning shows, and atracts an incredible amout of fans and listeners. The troops in the field love him, with all his hilarious antics and with him playing the greats in music. But the brass can't stand him and are willing to do anything to get him thrown out of the job. The humor is real enjoyable for everyone young and old. Robin brings in yet another great performance that pleased me, my friends and my whole family. 7.2/10
