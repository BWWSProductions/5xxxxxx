,nittany,2010-07-30T04:56Z,"Damn, I hate when there are two audio tracks in a movie.  The WD TV Live refuses to play files that have 2 audio tracks.

Why can't you do what the secret myth release group does?  Include the 2 channel audio track separate.  For the smaller percentage of people that want to play this file back on the xbox, they can add that audio track in.

Surely there are more people that want the 6 channel then 2 channel, I doubt that many people play back torrented movies using the xbox.  It can't even handle mkvs, wait to strict on it's format handling.


Thanks for the upload, it just sucks that the popular WD TV Live can't handle dual audio tracks."
