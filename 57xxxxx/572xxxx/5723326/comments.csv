Thanks for the upload ;)"
,sociopaten,2011-08-26T21:01Z,Hm. Seriously. I have tried like fifteen different English subtitles out there. None of them are in sync.
,Ruby_pirate,2011-11-14T19:26Z,"Thanks for uploading, BUT the audio of this torrent is IN ITALIAN. There are no German AT ALL. I thought that audio would be in german and we will have the option of italian audio and/or italian subs. So MAKE SURE you make this clear NEXT TIME. Thanks."
