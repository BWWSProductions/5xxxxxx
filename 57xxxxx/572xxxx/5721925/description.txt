"Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)" is the well known theme song from the 1976 film A Star Is Born. It was composed and performed by Barbra Streisand with lyrics by Paul Williams. The song was released on the soundtrack to A Star Is Born.

Streisand earned an Academy Award for Best Original Song, her second overall, as composer of the song. With "Evergreen", Streisand earned a Grammy Award for Song of the Year as well. She and Williams also won Golden Globes in the category of Best Original Song for the song.

The single was a worldwide success, spending three weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and six weeks atop the adult contemporary chart. This was Streisand's second Hot 100 #1 song (following "The Way We Were" in 1974), and her third chart-topper on the adult contemporary chart ("The Way We Were" and 1964's "People").

The song's famous opening couplet, "Love, soft as an easy chair, love fresh as the morning air," almost didn't appear that way. Williams wrote the morning air line first, but Streisand told him, "flip those first two lines, because it sings better. "Williams agreed, saying "TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll probably laugh us out of the theatres for starting a love song with a line about a chair, but I think it works better that way."

A Star Is Born is a 1976 rock music film telling the story of a young woman, played by Barbra Streisand who enters show business, and meets and falls in love with an established male star, played by Kris Kristofferson, only to find her career ascending while his goes into decline. It is a remake of two earlier versions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the 1937 version was a drama starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, and the 1954 version was a musical film starring Judy Garland and James Mason. This version was the highest grossing of the three films.
