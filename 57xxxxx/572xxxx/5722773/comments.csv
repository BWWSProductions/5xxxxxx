,bennyboytx,2011-01-03T02:17Z,this is good...although i have some songs that you don't in my library :) reply if your interested.
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2011-01-03T06:29Z,Yes I am interested! 
,bennyboytx,2011-01-10T05:43Z,"Okay well mainly there are some acoustic songs your missing, but I'll just start listing stuff, sorry if i mention something you already had.

FOB did a VH1 unplugged special that i believe i ripped the audio off the youtube recordings. Only way i think they were released. 4 songs there

Acoustic songs, Patrick did alot of stuff. You got all the bonus CD content but I found a acoustic of Growing Up that I believe you don't have

Welcome to the New Administration was some weird fake radio broadcast with an annoying DJ anyway they did 2 demo songs there that were never released. Lake Effect Kid and Catch Me If You Can

There was a something titled Leaked in London which included live performances of thriller golden dance dance and others ( 3 of them are on the infinity on high bonus CD) but your missing Golden and Our Lawyer Made Us Change The Name Of This Song. 

And if this even counts, Patrick did an episode of ""live at Daryl Hall's House"" where they did covers of a songs like i dont care and sophomore slump & what a catch donnie. I downloaded the episode and ripped the audio but that was a little extreme on my part :P i'm a big fan if you couldn't tell.

If you want these just comment again?

,poisoN.,2011-04-06T00:32Z,"Missing ""Reinventing The Wheel To Run Myself Over"", but otherwise great torrent."
,Fazzie_,2011-04-19T03:20Z,"Worst Quality torrent I have ever downloaded, sorry."
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2011-04-20T03:14Z,"You only say worst quality because of the fact that it is all 128 kbps. If you want it higher, go somewhere else or buy the music your self. But you will not get a more organized, properly labeled torrent than this. "
,blodgrahm,2011-06-19T17:40Z,By far the worst fucking bullshit ever yes you may have alot of there songs but the majorty of them are fucking god damn remixes pure fucking bullshit if your gonna try to call it there discography  then it should be whats on there cd's not the remixes of all the songs you douche bag try again sometime when you can actually have the right shit dip shit
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2011-07-10T09:47Z,"Blodgrahm, fuck off. I clearly put in the last sentence that I had their remixes in this. 

If you don't want the fucking remixes, delete them. This is a quality torrent as the rest of the nonstuck up comments and the rating reflect. 

If I'm the dipshit, then why is it YOU that's bitching about something that you can fix your fucking self in all of about five minutes by deleting the songs you don't want. 

And it's not 'mostly remixes'. Dumb fuck. It's called INCLUDING THE BONUS TRACKS. There are 12 songs on here that are remixes, 7 acoustic versions of songs, 18 live songs, and one marching band cover of a song. That makes 38 songs. There are a total 136. That means about one third of the songs on this can even PARTIALLY fall under 'remixes'. The rest are all fucking legit tracks.

One third is NOT majority, fuck face. Don't call me a dipshit until you check your own fucking facts. Get your head out of your ass and the shit out of your eyes and ears. "
