The first album available stateside from Helsinki's Regina, Puutarhatrilogia (which translates to Garden Trilogy) doesn't contain a single decipherable lyric, for us non-Finnish speakers at least, but one doesn't need to understand the trio's native tongue to enjoy their breezy electro-pop. To mention St. Etienne as a touchstone isn't too far off, especially with Regina singer Iisa Pykari's lilting, sultry delivery, just replace the baggy grooves with more of a jazzy shuffle and some surreal detours. During "Tapaa minut aamulla," Pykari's exotic melody seems to borrow equally from Western and Far Eastern scales, eventually leading the light, Balearic-kissed song through a storm of cascading piano keys that come down like a summer rain shower. The same piano wrenches up the tension in the skeletal leftfield house-pop of "Saanko jÃ¤Ã¤dÃ¤ yÃ¶ksi?" and helps steer the album towards slightly darker, more mysterious territory which arrives a few tracks later with "Sinun tÃ¤ssÃ¤ salissa," a song whose sampled sitars and poly-rhythmic pulse recall the Knife on a magic carpet ride. An enjoyably diverse outing, fans of the aforementioned shouldn't hesitate.
