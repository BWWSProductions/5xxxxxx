Plot:

A show about nothing, or is it? Seinfeld revolves around the everyday lives of four single New Yorkers. Jerry Seinfeld (as himself) is a comedian who's next door neighbor, Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards), is a professional moocher, the brains behind several get-rich-quick schemes, and is over at Jerry's apartment more than his own. Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dryfess) is Jerry's ex-girlfriend who he remains good friends with. George Costanza (Jason Alexander) is a short, stalky, bald man, who for most of his life, lived with his parents.

Seinfeld, said to be a show about nothing, was actually about a lot. It showcased the lives of four friends who would discuss their lives as they ate at their favorite cafe, Monk's. Seinfeld will go down in history as the show that revolutionized TV.

I found a small issue with ""S3.E14-The Pez Dispenser"", the audio track was a commentary, other than that this is a GREAT release! Thanks!"
