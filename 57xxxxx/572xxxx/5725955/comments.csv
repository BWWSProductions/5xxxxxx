,mcpspmicro,2010-08-26T17:12Z,why does no one have the correct song for track #8? everyone has the remix instead of the original version..
,loveVII,2010-08-27T20:19Z,"The original song isn't by Usher, mcps. It's by Justin Bieber. Usher is only in the Remix, hence why the remix is the one on USHER'S CD."
