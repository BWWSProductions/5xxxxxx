,Meatus,2010-08-07T01:54Z,So is it a DVD rip or not? I don't want to take the time if it isn't.
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-08-07T09:35Z,Yes it is a dvdrip
,EdgarS789,2010-09-04T21:33Z,"Synch is improved, but still not perfect. Strange subtitles in some wierd (Scandinavian?) language are still there."
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-09-06T10:47Z,"thanks pal, the video was all i had to work with at the time, just wanted to get it out quickly to rival the out of sync version. It was my first effort at syncing by the way...... ;)"
,moviequeen,2010-10-18T07:08Z,Wow!! The audio is totally out of sync. really ruins the movie in my opinion.. I only got like 2 minutes in i think
,joeyerin,2010-10-28T19:41Z,"i downloaded this a day or 2 ago.. beautiful quality btw.. but downloaders beware, the riaa or mpaa is watching this torrent. just got an email and phone call from verizon with a copyright infringement notice for this"
,predygreen,2010-10-28T23:04Z,"this video is not ""Synced"" i couldn't even deal with it that's how bad it is"
,i-pirate-shit,2010-12-09T08:22Z,"mosty out of sync piece of shit ever. if using VLC, delay audio till it hits 5000 exactly, should be good then."
,trikimiki,2010-12-09T21:28Z,"When will u people stop downloading from arseholes called ""anonymous"" its always the wrong shite movies


OH FLOWER OF SCOTLAND WHEN WILL WE SEE"
,AxMataz,2011-01-22T19:25Z,This is like 5 seconds out of sync. And the bottom's cut. Useless.
,xspx,2011-04-03T13:19Z,"agree with AxMataz.. 
video and audio are not synced, and bottom is cut, sometimes pop up swedish subs from tv or something.. useless! don't download!"
