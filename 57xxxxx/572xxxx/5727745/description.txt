A Pretty Good Way to Foil the NSA 
 
How easy is it for the average internet user to make a phone call secure enough to frustrate the NSA's extrajudicial 
surveillance program? 

Wired News took Phil Zimmermann's newest encryption software, Zfone, for a test drive and found it's actually quite 
easy, even if the program is still in beta. 

Zimmermann, the man who released the PGP e-mail encryption program to the world in 1991 -- only to face an 
abortive criminal prosecution from the government -- has been trying for 10 years to give the world easy-to-use 
software to cloak internet phone calls. 

But make no mistake: to eavesdroppers, Zfone is anything but routine. The protocol is based on SRTP, a system that 
uses the 256-bit AES cipher and adds to that a 3,000-bit key exchange that produces the codes callers can read off to 
one another. It has been submitted to IETF for approval as an internet standard, and by most accounts is strong enough 
to defy even the most sophisticated code-breaking technologies, from a hacker's packet sniffer to the acres of 
computers beneath Ft. Meade. 

That makes Zfone the "most secure telephone system anyone has ever used," according to PGP Corporation's CTO Jon 
Callas, who worked with Zimmermann on the protocol.
