[V],joshua13,2010-07-31T02:30Z,I believe they are natural . Implants can generally be spotted by the different way they respond to gravity as opposed to tissue. Implants are firmer and so don't sag as much. They are also generally more rounded and uniform than natural breasts. Personally I don't like the term fake. Variety is the spice of life I say
