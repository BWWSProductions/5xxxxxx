Synopis: The Celliers are just like any other family, every one of its members is as mad as a hatter. Mady, a 60 year old housewife, spends her days with never a good word to say about her children and husband Henry, a strange man who seems to have been in regression ever since his retirement. Antoine, their eldest son, is incapable of running a business. Alice is obsessed with painting depressing pictures of madonnas, and Annabelle, a nurse working in an intensive care unit, is desperately trying to save the family by reading them the future. When Alice meets Jacques, a lonely policeman, he changes everything, until it all gets set off... for good or for bad. (Film Affinity)
