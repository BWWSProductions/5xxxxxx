i have an xperia x10 from sony ericsson and it has android 1.6.
does anyone know a solution?
thanks "
,ballisticz,2010-08-03T10:30Z,is there something missing from the install instructions? Everytime I try after following these steps it asks me to download additional data
[T],xxThugxx,2010-08-03T15:52Z,"sorry the data i included was only for armv7 chipsets eg snapdragon, if you have a omap chipset, (milestone/droid/droid X/galaxy ect) you will have to download the data from gameloft, you should have no problem doing it tho "
,ballisticz,2010-08-06T08:05Z,"ah ok thanks, i ended up getting it to work some how.. but having the same problem with NOVA so I'll just download the data"

all you have to do when the torrent is downloaded :

1. put the assasinscreed folder in to this path - sdcard/gameloft/games
2. copy the Assassins Creed.apk file onto sd card
3. turn off wifi and data connection
4. open ES file explorer or App Installer, tap on Assassins Creed instalation
5. launch the game
6. programm needs to download additional data - when this appear, tap Yes, then tap WiFi or DataConnection (in the game) and download the data
7. play the game"

,Arkane87,2011-01-24T03:24Z,"Hey xxThugxx, would it be possible for you to get Spectral Souls for us, as well as the extra data folder required to play the game?"
,killmove,2011-03-17T05:01Z,"Works great on my Galaxy S using Andriod 2.1.
NB. After following the downloading the data from Gameloft, go back to Airplane mode before you continue as the game restarts and will try to log on to their servers to register the game, hence the fake program notice.
@wallerius2003, simply uninstall and reinstall in airplane mode and follow my tips to enjoy the game. Always launch the game with 3g and wifi off."

1. Turn off data connection and wi-fi.
2. Run the game.
3. When it asks you to download, minimize the game and turn on data connection or wi-fi and return to game.
4. Press yes and it will download.
5. After it has finished downloading, turn off wi-fi or data connection and play the game...! :)"
