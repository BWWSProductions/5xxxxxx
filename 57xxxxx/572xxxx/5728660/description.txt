Silver Rain includes seven original Marcus Miller compositions including "Bruce Lee", an homage to the martial arts master which captures Leeâ€™s energetic spirit and features alto saxophonist Gerald Albright known for his work with Anita Baker and Quincy Jones. Amongst the many guest artists is the amazing Kirk Whalum, a musician who has an impressive solo career and who was featured on The Sun Donâ€™t Lie. Since that time Marcus looked for an opportunity to work with him again, but never found it until now. Kirk who infuses his jazz with gospel overtones is the latest in a great line of Texas tenors that include Illinois Jacquet and Arnett Cobb. Gregoire Maret, a young harmonica player who works with Meâ€™Shell Ndegeocello, Pat Metheny and Cassandra Wilson has also lent his incredible talents to the music of Silver Rain. Kenny Garrett, who has recorded and toured extensively with Marcus is back again to play an incredible solo on a cover of Princeâ€™s "Girls and ! Boys". This tune also features the fantastic Macy Gray. In her voice you hear the character of both Tina Turner and Billie Holiday, but Macy has a vocal style that is uniquely hers.
