,floydiantrooper,2010-09-03T00:55Z,"@Damien74 - Hold your hands away from the keys friend for thethingy deserves no such comments like that on his posts. thethingy is like my best pirate mate on here and I completely respect what he has done thus far. He has saved many of us tons of headache on here and I currently have all of his software and it is NEAR PERFECT WORK EVERY TIME. So, don't look a gift horse in the mouth and hold thy tongue chap."

I have used several of your PS CS5 releases with no issues  this seems to be giving my a little problem.  I'm running win 7 x64 I've installed this plug in and each of the files has a lock on it and I cannot see them in the filter menu. Can you help?

Thank You"

Geez, guy, 'thethingy' is the absolute wrong person to comment negatively on--whether he erred or not!  He may be the Internets most popular person with hundreds of perfect uploads. Please, give the guy a break. 

Could there be a possibility that you have created the error . . . Hmmmm?

Questions are a display of maturity. A blaming voice is usually left behind with childhood.  "
