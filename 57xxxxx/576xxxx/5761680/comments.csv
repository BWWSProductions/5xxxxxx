This may seem thick but what does the ""PiZ"" on the end of most of the filenames mean?"
[T],on.off.on,2010-08-14T15:37Z,"Piz means Psp,ipod,zune... or maybe he just needs to take a piz?? lol"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-14T16:48Z,"@ omegastoo - it means PSP, iPod, Zune, it is a reminder of what it is compatible on. It is what PT and HR did, so I am doing it too. 

@ OOO - lol"
,omegastoo,2010-08-14T17:22Z,"I must need something lol. Cheers lads, sorry for sounding thick, HR started putting PiZ on the end ages back and it just never clicked what it stood for as his earlier stuff didnt have it. Brain fart lol."
