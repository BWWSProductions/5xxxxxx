,Shotobuke,2010-08-28T02:34Z,Yes and I have noticed this with all of NLUPPER releases. They all have some sort of skipping glitches in them somewhere in the movies. While not entirely annoying I would check some settings or whatever software is being used to rip these.
,Escfrh0m3,2011-03-22T10:30Z,i'm ripping some blurays to and i noticed that skipping glitches for me most of them are the subs try to turn them off and see. or sometimes the copyright and need to rip again
