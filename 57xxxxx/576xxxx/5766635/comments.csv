Regarding the Androzip, which was recommended by the seeder, I personally prefer the ""ASTRO File Manager"" - advanced file manager with many extra features. By the way it's completely free and can be downloaded from the Market or from http://www.freewarelovers.com/android/app/astro-file-manager if you cannot access Market for whatever reason.

And please keep seeding!"

try out linda manager... it beats the hell out of androzip!

stun it would be great to know when this was compiled ???"
,Sundappen,2010-08-26T19:40Z,"""Android Software Collection 7-24-10.nfo""

From within the pack, which indicates this is a rerun of an older release."
