Acclaimed singer-songwriter Lloyd Cole plans to release Broken Record â€” the former Commotions  leaderâ€™s first full-band album in a decade â€” this September, and reports that heâ€™s â€œhappy we got these songs finished because Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll make another record like this again.â€
The 11-track album, Coleâ€™s first since 2006â€™s Antidepressant, finds the musician ending his â€œself-imposed exile as a would-be folksinger.â€
Cole enlisted the members of his â€œbaby bluegrass band,â€ the Small Ensemble, as well as Joan Wasser, aka Joan as Police Woman, and ex-Commotion Blair Cowan. The project is being funded, in part, by 1,000 fans who paid $45 for the deluxe edition of the album before it was even recorded (theyâ€™ll get a second disc with 15 outtakes). The experience of working with a band again, Cole writes, was â€œrewarding, perplexing, fabulously enjoyable and heinously stressful.â€ He adds that, â€œSinging with a rock and roll band in the studio I felt exactly as I did in 1987 or 1995, and then I would see my reflection in the glass of the gobo and wonder who this old guy wasâ€¦â€
Cole is planning to do press for the album in Europe in July and September and play solo dates during those trips; heâ€™s also working to schedule a European tour with the Small Ensemble in October and November, plus heâ€™s tentatively planning to play shows throughout the U.S. and Australia/New Zealand in early 2011.
