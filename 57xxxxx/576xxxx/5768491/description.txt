Pilot :
Frank Gregorio is a successful psychiatrist, loving husband, and doting grandfather to the two children of his eldest daughter, Lana. When the universe conspires to introduce him to karaoke through both a patient's parent issues and his precocious granddaughter's birthday party, Frank rediscovers a long-suppressed dream of becoming a professional singer. While his wife, Angelina, believes he is just practicing to sing at their younger daughter's upcoming wedding, Frank befriends a karaoke aficionado, Lydia, a femme fatale who has other plans for the would-be crooner. Simultaneously the sarcastic and harried Lana grows increasingly neurotic about her post-pregnancy weight and flagging marriage and contemplates solutions in the form of plastic surgery and an affair with a hunky and charismatic police officer. Like father, like daughter? How will this close-knit Italian American family cope with the decisions Frank and Lana make?
