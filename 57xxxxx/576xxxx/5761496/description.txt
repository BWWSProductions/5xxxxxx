Wim Wenders says,
\"Fashion. I\'ll have nothing of it. At least that
was my first reaction when the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris asked me to make a short film
in the context of fashion.\"

\"The world of fashion.
I\'m interested in the world, not in fashion! But, maybe I was too quick to put down fashion. Why
not look at it without prejudice? Why not examine
it like any other industry, like the movies
for example?\"

\"Maybe fashion and cinema had something
in common. And something else -- this film would
give me the opportunity to meet someone who
had already aroused my curiosity, someone
who worked in Tokyo [Fashion designer
Yohji Yamamoto].\"
