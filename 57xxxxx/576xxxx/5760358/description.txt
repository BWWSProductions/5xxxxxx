I discovered there was no seeded torrents of either of Danny Elfman's Batman scores in FLAC anywhere online.

This had to be corrected!

Included are FLAC rips of Batman and Batman Returns, both by Danny Elfman.

[b]THIS TORRENT DOES NOT HAVE ANY OF THE SCORES FOR THE CHRISTOPHER NOLAN FILMS OR THE JOEL SCHUMACHER FILMS, only Tim Burton's.[/b]

Well, I found a torrent of Batman Returns in FLAC. Those flac files are included.

I then bought a new copy of Batman OST and ripped that with EAC and included that with a log file.

I don't always do my flac rips with EAC, sometimes I use other rippers that rip into lossless wav format and then use FLAC Front-End to convert it to FLAC format. The reason? EAC is still in beta mode and tends to lock up (the application) on me sometimes and does not work. In this case, it worked flawlessly. (Reason I am explaining this is because one douche actually COMPLAINED on my last soundtrack release (Inception in FLAC) that I didn't include a log file...over FREE music...)

So here you are, there's a log file for the Batman OST album...



Enjoy
