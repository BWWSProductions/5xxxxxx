,Nbitz,2010-08-14T10:44Z,"I love Paradox games, but I don't buy them, you want to know why I don't buy them ?

Bugs.

Don't get me wrong, PI is great, their customer support is unmatched but they should not release buggy games and later sell patches as if they were expansions. 

I learned this the hard way by paying for HoI 2 and EU III, which worked ... eventually ... after paying extra for 2-3 patches."
,EPDJ,2010-08-15T12:19Z,"Well, I would have to disagree, in my opinion the additional mods for EU3 were nothing more then patches to the original. In fact, I would say that the MMU mod is the essential ""patch"" for that game to make it worthwhile. I gladly would spend 60-100$ for the end result, but not for each major update(HTTT, IN) in addition to that. I have a lot of respect for the work they do, but buying an incomplete game is not what I like to do. 

As for Vicky 2, I have to say that so far, it is by far the least error-ed intial release by paradox(which is what they were aiming for). Unfortunately, it does come with major gamebreaking bugs. You will notice that major nations will collapse due to extremely overpowered rebels(along with artisan fulfillment problems).. causing the entire world economy to crash at times. 

I was highly anticipating Vicky 2 since I am a huge fan of the original... and so far, I have to say that I am not disappointed. Before I shell out the money to support a company that I truly admire(although... I have noticed that some of the PR figures for the company have outright denied fixing their own mistakes or have gone as far as to insult a customer), I am awaiting the anticipated 1.2 patch, which 'should' fix most, if not all, of the critical errors that were missed during testing.

In any case, I HIGHLY recommend this game for fans of this genre and when the new patch comes, I would suggest supporting this company by buying the game despite its availability here. They are one of the very few companies to continue supporting their games long after release and they listen to their fanbase often. To top it off, they are pretty much one of the very few companies that do not put theft protection on their games. (think about the problems that arise with companies that use Starforce or other horrible malicious 'protection' programs). That alone is VERY respectable. 

On a personal note, I would love it if Stun or someone who has registered their box, could release some of the fan-made temporary fixes to the current release (especially: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=492091). 

I have done a little modding of my own, but I am far from experienced and as I stated before, until 1.2 comes.. I will not buy a partially-working game. I doubt anyone will help, but its worth mentioning. 

I would also like to give props to Stun/Skidrow for this release, I had downloaded the Outlaw version, but nothing beats a proper install.

Thanks again ^^"

,Yashrim,2010-08-16T18:26Z,"First off, ignore Nbitz, he's said the same thing on about 20 different websites about this game. That said... like all Paradox games (with the exception of mount & blade, which they did not develop, just published.) it CAN NOT BE PLAYED out of the box.

They screwed up the pops (the #1 aspect of your empire since the population dictates everything) by not balancing their needs... basically the farmers and unskilled laborers will be filthy rich, while all of your skilled craftsmen die from poverty, or more likely... revolt and burn down your empire.

They screwed up the life ratings and terrains, so that means colonization is impractical, and territories aren't realistic.

Politically, the map is inferior to the original, and a lot African and Asian countries have been left out.

On the note of the map... It's damned useless! You have to zoom all the way out to get a map that shows you political boundaries properly, and they went on the side of making it look pretty, rather than being practical, so it's too vague to make out anything but the largest nations (worthless for Europe.) and in that view, you cannot see anything going on. If you zoom in though, you have the opposite problem, you can only see what's going on, but ALL OF THE MAP MODES LOOK THE SAME so you can't make anything out.

Oh, and as for one of the two things that really made Vicky stand out from other Paradox games? (The other being the population system) THE EVENTS! They promised events in the thousands during development... and what do we get? Damn near zilch. It's not even as if the events are hard to code, or that they had to be made from scratch. The mod projects (namely VIP) from the first could've been damn near ripped clean from the mods and inserted.

In summary? Paradox... When you make a damned sequel to a game, you don't just have to add the features that happen to already be in your new engine and convert the gamestyle over... YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF CONTENT THAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL! (and I'm not counting the mods.) It's actually required to mod this game in order to play it at this time.

As for the horrible CTD and blackened screen bugs? Yep, I get them too. I can't be sure what the cause is, but there is one thing for certain, this game runs like crap on multi-core PCs, and it may have something to do with that. Regardless, you're lucky to go one game-year without a CTD.

On a final note, don't even bother with asking on their forums. Everyone who's allowed to post is a yesman, and the PR people are total douchebags. They'll outright lie to you and deny many issues even exist, then insult you. Furthermore, they purge their forums of any mention of a CTD bug existing. My advice? Wait a year or two before downloading this game, at least until after the inevitable expansion, and it's been modded to some degree.... The original only had it's primary mod finished earlier this year, and the game was released in 2003."
,Nbitz,2010-08-17T22:48Z,"@Yashrim What do you mean ? That was the first time I gave that answer on any website.

Do you know me ? Because I don't think you do, and neither do I. So STFU before you judge me bitch."
,Yashrim,2010-08-18T01:58Z,"Nbitz?
lmfao, are you fucking serious? Well, if it's really not you, try looking at every other review and most torrents out there, there's somebody ranting almost the exact same lines.

Update on bugs;

Blackened Screen and CTD will both be significantly reduced if you NEVER EVER USE THE TERRAIN MAP FILTER! Also, I believe some of the lockup issues are tied to this game being a complete memory hog, and how the tick system (turns) works. If your page file ever fills up, the game obviously will slow down for a moment, but the game seems to continue trying to process turns beyond what it's able to during the slowdown, and then some sort of errors occur. This might actually be tied to the game's problems with multi-core processors.

Still, DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS at least until patch 1.2 has been tested, unless you plan on fixing all of the game's problems yourself. (admittedly, in my boredom I've already created an anarcho-liberal/fascist (they can't decide...)

Also, it seems this engine not just has issues with multicore, it also has issues with NVIDIA cards. Does anyone know if there's a fix for the compatibility issues here? I'm at a loss.

And I have to reply to this post as well: 

""still can't get Fertilizer profitable. Seriously, I won't be able to play this until VIP2 is out. ""

Hotfix2 is very playable as far as I've seen but other than bugs some game concepts are just hard. 

You can get fertilizer profitable even in the original you just have to play England. The reason for this is the economy is silly prestige based instead of price based. Meaning if there is little demand high prestige (England) gets to sell first, so if they build fertilizer factory first and you play another country they can sell and you cant sell to anyone except your own pops. If you cant sell anything it will never be profitable. Also factory buys all the input even if it can sell less say 50%. So you buy 100% input and sell only 50% of product you make quite a loss. So it is essential that you sell everything, you can do this if you build factories to cover your internal markets + your sphere of influence (SOI) within your own SOI you can also sell first even if England has higher prestige, so that's your market. Also pops need money to buy and the game only shows you ""desire"" not if they can actually afford it. You can track your imports and exports this is most important under ""market activity tab"". If your country imports something, you know there is actual demand where they can pay for it. So if you build a factory that produces previously imported stuff there is a guaranteed market for it in your country. Fertilizer will only be profitable for England under most cases it has the tech for it to build it early, and it can sell the stuff with its huge internal market and SOI. 

once again get hotfix 2

,Yashrim,2010-08-26T01:12Z,"Well, I'm giving the hotfix a shot, a bit surprised just how enormous the needs of the pops are though compared to vanilla. Though, I'm not sure why, but I seem to be having trouble assimilating pops now... might just be too early in the new game I started though. It doesn't look like they adjusted assimilation in the hotfix from where I looked, did I miss something or is it just a temporary side effect of the needs change until the world market gets up and running?

Also... do you have any idea how to fix the bugs with the map tweaking out? (going black?) I'm pretty sure it's something to do with Nvidia cards (mine surpasses the requirements, but it's average at best.) and I've noticed a lot of other people complaining about it."
,RickyVIP,2010-08-26T09:21Z,"Sorry no idea on the graphical fixes, these are dependent on what kind of setup you are using. I can tell you I have Nvidia but the map never went black as of yet. 


The pops needs are increased (only luxuries mostly, look at life needs they are very fillable) is a workaround to the way paradox set up the economy. If a farmer becomes too rich he will but the money in the bank and there it usually just rots, only can be loaned out to other governments. So the banks sucking up too much money and just sitting on it perpetually ruins the economy, this is why luxury needs of farmers et al were increased so they wont save millions at game start but buy things and keep the economy going.  Now theoretically the game could function on a small amount of money, prices would fall to compensate and all would be well just lower prices? WRONG. Paradox only lets the prices move a little bit around the original price which they set in a file... 

Assimilation: Assimilation in the game does not actually come from the ""assimilation"" mechanic but mostly from promotions demotions and migrations. This is because the game is single core so performance is most important. So there cant be that many pops around late game with England you will see all those POPs who are 2m strong in india for exl. So there must be as few pops as possible so for example there must be only 1 type of beurocrat in a state, all others will simply ""join it"" not make their own pop... So you have 10 yankee crats who are catholic, everyone who wants a job as a crat there will instantly become yankee and catholic... So really the promotion mechanic is like 100% assimilation because of the performance concerns. So when the hotfix sets promotion demotion and migration to fix some other bugs, this is the side effect slower ""assimilation"" (really promotion demotion and migration). People will demote and migrate without jobs or when starving. If your econ is decent there wont be many migrations or demotions. So you wait till your RGO fills up and invent techs that reduce the size that will get emigrations going. Also residency policy will keep your main culture from emigrating and let all the minorities emigrate abroad. "

Not only do you get the most recent of mod patches/fixes, but you support a very good company, one of the very few that makes games of such depth and quality(and mod-ability). Unfortunately they choose to release their games too soon, but as such, they continue to release fixes and patches for years after the initial release.

Anyway, below is an update to VRRP and another good mod 'POPDemand mod'. Both are UNTESTED.

http://www.mega.upload.com/?d=B4XU4FS2 (PDM 7.8)

The mod/application below is designed to fix the error presented by colonies that won't become a state due to the requirement of needing 1% of your bureaucrats of an accepted culture(for instance, in vanilla, the USA is pretty much unable to make their established colonies of oklahoma, oregon, etc into states because the bureaucrats are of native-american culture, not yankee/dixie. Further directions/information/proper download can be found in the paradox mod forum[serial registration not needed]): 

http://www.mega.upload.com/?d=HFJ3FZV0 (Bureaucratic Assimilator 1.2.2)

Both files are untested, they have been releasing them too fast for me to keep with either. I have only played up to 1.07 of VRRP and 7.6 of PDM.

Both mods will continue to get even better(as did Magni Mundi for EU3), I am just posting these to make the game decently playable. BUY THE GAME! 

Once paradox releases an official patch that solves the critical issues, I won't post updates to the mods. I would have never learned about these games if I didn't first download it from sites like this.

As for RVVP, copy all of the folders in the RAR file EXCEPT the localization at first, then after.. go into that folder and move the localization files one by one into the localization folder. For whatever reason, there was an issue with the normal 'click and drag' method to the main directory and one of the localization files wasn't overwriting or moving into the folder, causing crashes.

Look at Great Britain; they raped all of South east Asia and China IRL. The world was pissed, but what were they gonna do about it? Great Britain was a fucking world power. Tbh, I think Infamy should also work as a fear factor (as in, ""Wow, this guy has 60 infamy, we better agree with him because he might declare war on us"")."
,EPDJ,2010-09-19T04:20Z,"Well, I also think there is a bit of a glitch with AI and how much infamy they gain, I saw the UK declare on Siam for full conquest and they only had 6 infamy...

I understand what you are saying about the UK taking india, SE asia.. and some of china.. but they do it at such an insane rate that I find it unreal. They seem to declare on one colonial power after another, rather then fighting wars with other great powers(they only seem to get mixed up in the war between belgium/NL, and a few versions ago, with the US over new england[which was a bug]).

I also don't like how they put just about every major colonial power under their sphere after a while. China inside of the UK sphere? japan under the us sphere? seems... a little much. They should be limited to the smaller non-civs.

The UK had an amazing sense of organization and logistics, but they weren't unstoppable behemoths, they had a lot of pressure from other major countries of the time. 

In any case, its still a great mod, I just hope they fine-tune it a little more.

36 downloads for 9.0 ..  quite a leap from the other versions, for only a day of downloads.

Anyway, here is 9.1 of PDM, this 'might' be the last update for a handful of days. From what I read.. ""Checksum is QMRP. Now I'm off to move house. ""

I haven't had a chance to test it, but I plan to in a couple hours. VRRP seems to be planned for an update on sunday(some time tomorrow). 

enjoy~"

,EPDJ,2010-09-19T16:01Z,"Its not that bad, they just got in over their heads with the pop/economy system. I would give it a handful of patches and it should be polished enough for some great mods to adapt like MMU did for EU3."

I hope they will not mess to much with official patch 1.2. Only thing that bother me right now is the damn jacobins rebels spawning everywhere after 1870 or so and the broken laissez-faire economy (because capitalist AI is stupid)"
,EPDJ,2010-09-27T01:28Z,"I can't get my hands on that modding mod, it doesn't appear to be anywhere outside of their forums. If you are pretty serious about making a mod, I suggest buying the game.. you would not only have access to experienced fellow players, but people will be able to test your mod and give you feedback/bug reports. 

@Kooh
They are changing quite a bit, you can read the different logs in the forum, if you do some searching. There us a lot to be fixed. As for the jacobins, the mods I posted fix that for the most part. The only major country that I have seen completely conquered by rebels is China. I am hoping that 1.2 will come out in a couple days as paradox has been saying."

2) Run the launcher.
3) On the bottom left, it says 'Check for Update'. Click that to download the patch.
4) CLOSE THE LAUNCHER.
5) Install the patch.
