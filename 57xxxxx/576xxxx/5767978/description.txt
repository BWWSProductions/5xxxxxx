Journalist Gary Matsumoto discussed his research into a dangerous and experimental anthrax vaccine, referred to as "vaccine A", that has been administered to U.S. soldiers since 1991, and which he contends is the cause of a host of maladies known collectively as Gulf War Syndrome. 

Are You Superstitious?
In the first hour, Ian spoke with cognitive development scholar Bruce Hood about superstitions -- notions that cannot be explained by scientific inquiry and seem to run counter to natural laws. Hood pointed out that everyone has some amount of superstitious belief by posing the following questions: 

â€¢Could you wear clothing that belonged to a serial killer? 
â€¢Could you swap your wedding ring or other sentimental object for a duplicate? 
â€¢Could you stab a photograph of a loved one through the eyes with a pair of scissors?
To further illustrate the power of superstitions, Hood referred to a study that found more Californian Asians die on the fourth day of the month than any other day. The Chinese and Japanese words for the number 4 sound just like their word for 'death', he noted. Rituals, such as those performed by athletes before their games, can help people gain a sense of control over their superstitious beliefs, Hood added.
