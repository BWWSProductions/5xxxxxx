    * In Spiderman 3 â€“ It took three years to create the visual effects required to portray the Sandmanâ€™s powers. To understand the dynamics of sand, various experiments were conducted with sand (launching sand at stunt men, splashing the stuff around and pouring it over ledges). Sand sculptors were also consulted for advice.
    * Spiderman 3 is the only film of the trilogy not to feature Spider-Man swinging through the city at the end.
    * Venom is never referred to as Venom. Sandman is only called Sandman once â€“ during a newscast sequence near the filmâ€™s climax. New Goblin is never called New Goblin â€“ the closest this comes to happen is Peter calling him â€œGoblin Jr.â€
    * Spiderman 3 is the only film in which the Main villain (Sandman) survives at the end."
