Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 60 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can\'t continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



In Spanish - NO subtitles, sorry.  :-[ 

Popular South-of-the-Border singing stars Pedro Infante and Libertad Lamarque head the cast of Escuela de Musica (Music School). Ms. Lamarque plays a prim-and-proper music teacher (complete with glasses) who traffics in the classic. Infante costars as the inevitable pop-music lover who introduces the heroine to the baser pleasures. Along the way, Libertad reforms the hard-drinking, womanizing Infante, so it can be said that both characters get what they want by film's end. Escuela de Musica is a virtual catalogue of what was then playing on the hit parades in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Cuba.
