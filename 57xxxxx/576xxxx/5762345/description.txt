Here is Philip Glass' infamous Einstein on the Beach, the 1976 opera in four acts. There's two and a half hours of music here on this 1979 4 CD set, performed by the Philip Glass Ensemble with Michael Riesman conducting.
This is fine music. Better than Glassworks in my opinion.

Format is 256k VBR AAC. The names of the songs are shortened to, for example, 'Act 3/2: Dance 2' as opposed to 'Glass: Einstein on the Beach: Act 3, Scene 2: Dance 2'.
