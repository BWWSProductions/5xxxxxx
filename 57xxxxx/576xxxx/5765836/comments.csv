A bunch of ""Mythbusters Wannabees"" attempt to use the scientific method to investigate ""phenomena""???

Paulding light is a general aviation aircraft landing at an airport.

the vehicle being ""pushed uphill"" is in fact going downhill.  There are numerous places around the country where the visual perception of an upward slope is actually, in fact, a downward slope.  Packanack Lake NJ is the most famous, and was featured in an 80's program that fully explained this phenomena.

BTW, what's up with the ""former FBI Agent"" guy?  He's way too young to have worked his way through other law enforcement or military service to become an FBI agent.  Did he maybe just work for the FBI, in an administrative role?  Or did he wash out of training or something?

This show is a fucking joke.

But thanks for uploading it, I'm criticizing the show, not the torrent."
