,theoriginalphantom,2010-08-15T02:06Z,Got a message come up saying I being reported for piracy after installing this program. Not really bothered but thought others should know.
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-15T03:01Z,"something on your machine blocks the editor for the hosts file !

enter:
"" C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\ ""

and add this 2 lines:
127.0.0.1	     www.pgware.com
127.0.0.1	     www.swiftdog.com

and save hosts file

""Spy bot search and destroy"" edits hosts file too and does this blocking any other program to edit it any more... 

it happens in rare cases not because of this but because of specific conditions on user's machine...such as a sealed hosts file...

[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-15T12:05Z,"Throttle speeds up connection only by optimizing machine settings regarding the internet connection which might happen on all systems, by the way. It cannot however exploit the ISP ! just optimizing local machine settings...  more exactly setting registry to allow full speed, given by ISP and local hardware...

which in case of MICROSOFT OR MICROSOFT  WINDOWS ... ;)) , IT HELPS !"
