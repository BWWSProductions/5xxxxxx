,dstar2,2010-09-19T11:29Z,"The quality is pretty good, but subs are by a non-native english speaker and it shows - much of it is not understandable - however, you wouldn't watch a movie like this for the story anyway ;-)

As far as the martial arts go, it's pretty impressive but not the match of Ong Bak 2. Unlike its predecessor, this one is full of supernatural hocus pocus even though the fights are still 'real' and not done with special effects. But the movie is mostly about said supernatural bullshit and the fights are a second class citizen.

Get this if you want closure to the story of Ong Bak 2, otherwise give this a miss."
