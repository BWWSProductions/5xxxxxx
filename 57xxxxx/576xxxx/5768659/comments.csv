NFO notes ::

Some of the users reported that there were glitches in the last release.
I suppose it's not the encoding problem but a breakdown of the seeding disk which caused the trouble after a preliminary check.Now I'll provide a repack release for those who had downloaded the movie last time.You guys only need to point to the original file in UT and do a HASH, glitches can be removed easily."
