In the near future, the U.S. transforms warfare by testing lethal remote-controlled robotic drones on the front lines.  To the worldâ€™s superpowers, the technology is something to be coveted and stolen.  To a group of state-side fun-loving hackers, it is the ultimate video game.  When the hackers see a group of rebels hijack a drone transport in Kazakhstan, lock out the military from controlling the drones, and take the technicians hostage, they realise that they are the only ones who can save the lone surviving technician and get her out of Kazakhstan alive.
