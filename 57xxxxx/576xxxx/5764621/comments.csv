Konnie Huq presents a look back at all the highs and lows of the 2009 series of The X Factor, from the auditions - held in front of a live audience for the first time - through to the dramatic live final, in which Joe McElderry beat out Olly Murs to the title. The show features interviews with last year's finalists in which they reveal how they felt about their experiences and what life has been like for them since the series ended. Konnie also talks to the judges and previews the new series."

Is there any way that you could seed Season 2, Episode 11, 28 and 30. i really wanted to see the year of Shayne Ward, since he is my singer of these series.

,asighkick,2010-08-19T04:14Z,"Hi again,
Just wanted to thank you for reseeding X Factor Series 1 as requested.  

Because we suffer poor connections here in NZ, I have arranged for a neighbour to also seed the complete season as we get it.

So far we are both seeding S01E01, 05, 08, 09(Results), 11(Results) and 14(Results).

Last time I looked, there were no seeds (but plenty of customers) for E09, E11 (Performances) and E13 (Results), E14 (Performances) and all of E15 and E16.

Will do our best to keep this series alive as long as possible.

Thanks again.
