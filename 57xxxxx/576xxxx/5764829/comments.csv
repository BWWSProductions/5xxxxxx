if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !
if tpb is down try downornot.com to check if its down and report its down on suprbay.org forums
lastly seed the files your getting..the way bittorent works the faster you seed ( upload) the faster you get ( download) so set your client eg utorrent to seed at its maximum amount for your isp speed"
