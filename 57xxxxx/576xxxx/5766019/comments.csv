,biorisk,2010-08-17T00:38Z,I've been a big fan of kingdom-release for a while now but I'm wondering why recently some of the files are being uploaded as .mkv.  Will this be permanent or can we expect to see PS3 compatible formats again?  I appreciate the work.  Please let me know.  Thanks

I hope this answers your question. :)
