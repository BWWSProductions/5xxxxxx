Madness - The Lot (Box Set 1999) [Contains 6 Early Madness\' Albums, Original Recording Remastered]



Madness were at the forefront of the early-1980s UK ska explosion, injecting the music with pop hooks and their own cheeky humour. The Lot collects their six albums in one convenient, 77-track package and features all the classic tracks--\"One Step Beyond\", \"Baggy Trousers\", \"Prince\", \"Night Boat To Cairo\", \"Our House\"--performed with customary zeal by Suggs and the boys. Remastered and beautifully packaged, with a 36-page booklet, as well as the familiar battered Doc Martens on the cover, The Lot is the ideal collection for all two-tone fanatics.
Along with the Specials, Madness were one of the leading bands of the ska revival of the late \'70s and early \'80s. As their career progressed, Madness branched away from their trademark \"nutty sound\" and incorporated large elements of Motown, soul, and British pop. Although the band managed one crossover American hit in 1983, the band remained a British phenomenon, influencing several successive generations of musicians and becoming one of the most beloved groups the country produced during the \'80s.
Madness box set includes all of the studio albums from the band\'s first run from 1979 to 1986, leaving out only the 1999 reunion CD Wonderful. It also leaves out the various compilation records (e.g., Complete Madness, Utter Madness, and Divine Madness, as well as the U.S. release Madness). Rather than reproduce the original album covers, The Lot pairs off the six albums into three distinct periods: the early \"nutty\" ska of One Step Beyond and Absolutely; the early-\'80s experiments with a more mature pop sound on Seven and The Rise and Fall; and the more slickly produced, darker-toned pop of Keep Moving and Mad Not Mad. It\'s a clever packaging strategy, though the art direction could stand to be a little more attractive. The box set also features a color insert with comments from the band about each album. American fans should beware: the enclosed edition of the 1984 album Keep Moving is the British version and consequently does not contain the singles \"The Sun and the Rain\" or \"Wings of a Dove\". In any case, The Lot offers strong evidence that, for all of their hit singles, Madness was an excellent album band as well.

The album peaked at number 2 and remained in the British record charts for over a year. One Step Beyond... has a much heavier ska influence than later Madness albums.

The Rise & Fall is the fourth album by the British pop group Madness. This album saw Madness at their most experimental, exhibiting a range of musical styles including jazz, English music hall and Eastern influences. NME described it at the time of its release as \"The best Madness record\". It has often been retrospectively described as a concept album. Although initially conceived as a concept album about nostalgia for childhood, the concept was eventually dropped, though the original theme is still evident particularly in the title track and the album\'s major hit \"Our House\". Although the band had previously been avowedly apolitical, the track \"Blue Skinned Beast\" was an overt satire on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her handling of the Falklands War, paving the way for more political comment on subsequent Madness albums.

Mad Not Mad is the sixth album by the British ska band Madness, released in 1985 (see 1985 in music). It was their only album not to feature founder member Mike Barson, who had left the group the year before. Only a few weeks after its release, the writers of NME included this LP on their list of the 100 best albums of all time. The band themselves have been less satisfied with the album. In a BBC Radio 1 interview in 1993 Suggs described Mad not Mad as \"a polished turd\" (referring to its glossy \'80s over-production).
