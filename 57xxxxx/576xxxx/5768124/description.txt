In a landmark interview, Alex talks with former director of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, Hamid Gul. Mr. Gul recently characterized the "leaked" Wikileaks documents implicating him in a string of attacks against US and NATO forces in Afghanistan as "malicious, fictitious, and preposterous." 
[2nd half of hour 1, through 11:30 in the 2nd half of hour 2]



Alex also welcomes back to the show film-maker, broadcaster and former broker and options trader, Max Keiser. Max is the host of On the Edge, a program of news and analysis, and also hosts Keiser Report, a financial tabloid. He formerly hosted The Oracle with Max Keiser on BBC World News and previously produced and appeared regularly on the TV series People & Power on the Al-Jazeera English network. In addition to his broadcasting work, Keiser is known for his invention of "Virtual Specialist Technology," a software system used by the Hollywood Stock Exchange.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
