1993 Anime Dragon Half

Xvid 640x480 29.97 fps 

Audio: 128kbps Mp3 in Japanese
Hardcoded Subs: English

I own the disc so if anyone really wants a rip of the english dubbed version I can do that also.

To me the english speaking re-dubbers dont capture the feel of the animation as much. Thats why I did Jap audio with eng subs...

Dragon Half (ãƒ‰ãƒ©ã‚´ãƒ³ãƒãƒ¼ãƒ•, Doragon HÄfu?) is a manga created by RyÅ«suke Mita and serialized in Monthly Dragon Magazine from 1988 to 1994. It was adapted into a two episode anime OVA series in 1993.[1] ADV Films licensed the anime series in North America.[2]

The story follows Mink, a half human/half dragon teenage girl on a quest for a potion which will turn her into a full human so that she can win the love of the legendary dragon slayer Dick Saucer.

The story (which is a parody of the Dungeons and Dragons genre) is very tongue-in-cheek, and pokes fun at a number of anime clichÃ©s,[4] most notably its overuse of super deformation and its wide range of genres in a similar way to anime such as Excel Saga. Much of the manga contains references to role-playing games and occasionally either other manga or anything that begins with the word 'dragon'.
