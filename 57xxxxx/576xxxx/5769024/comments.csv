you look like a soldier in halo, there is a coool HUD, improved handling, modified cars and lots of cool stuff. although its great i found a few bugs:
when u hold shift, u can hear the horn, but the camera wobbles. when u press shift, the view changes, but it stops in place and if u drive out of ur field of view, u wont see the car. the game dialogues are in russian although there are english subtitles. anyway, great job. waitin for GTA SA"

There's no way to make money!  You complete missions but you don't earn a dime!  Forget about buying property, etc.

You die instantly if you get shot.  You can't even pass the second mission because you can't avoid being shot by the chefs.
