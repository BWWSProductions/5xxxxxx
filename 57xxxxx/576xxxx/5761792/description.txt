What a fantastic textbook â€” it builds upon the foundations of Keppel and Birnes' Signature Killers  and incorporates so much more information and analysis in a much more academically appropriate package than a paperback book. As a former student and teaching assistant of Dr. Keppel's, I am overjoyed to see this book in print and think that it is an amazing resource for those who do not have the opportunity to take a class with Dr. K. ... I have already placed this book on my recommended reading list. ... To date, I have always brought my well-worn copies of Keppel and Birnes' Signature Killers and Geberth's Practical Homicide Investigations  to each guest lecture and told the students if they are interested in these areas, they need to purchase these two books as essential resources. ... Again, this textbook is fantastic and is the best academic reference on this topic that I have seen to date.
