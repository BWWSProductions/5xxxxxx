Ceberano is a member of the Church of Scientology, after being brought up as a practicing member since childhood. Ceberano believes public hostility towards the church is linked to "people with vested interests everywhere. We have in the division of the church some very strong viewpoints as regards to psychiatry. I mean, we quite blatantly believe psychiatry kills. And I think it does â€” it kills the mind and kills self-determinism and kills the right for a person to be an identity," despite the fact that Scientology has consistently been linked to intimidation, fraud, burglary, smear campaigns and character assassination since it's inception.[6][7]
