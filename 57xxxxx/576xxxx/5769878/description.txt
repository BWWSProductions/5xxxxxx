SYNOPSIS: Many films have drawn from classic Japanese theatrical forms, but none with such shocking cinematic effect as director Masahiro Shinodaâ€™s Double Suicide. In this striking adaptation of a Bunraku puppet play (featuring the music of famed composer Toru Takemitsu), a paper merchant sacrifices family, fortune, and ultimately life for his erotic obsession with a prostitute. Criterion is proud to present Double Suicide in a stunning digital transfer, with a new and improved English subtitle translation.
