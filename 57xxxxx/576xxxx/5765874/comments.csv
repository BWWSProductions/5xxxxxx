I'm gonna keep seeding after its done of Course :)
By the way do you got old movies?
I'm looking for desperate measures (1998) with Michael Keaton & Andy Garcia,this fucking movie is bad ass & no sites to to download it :("
,fatboy_17,2010-08-16T08:59Z,"Just downloaded this, I rate it for a DVDrip as:
A:8
V:8

A little bit pixelated and the audio sounds somewhat tinny. It does appear to be a dvdrip, but not the best quality one.
Worth the download however for a smaller filesize (EG not the 1.4GB version)."
