,ddawg,2010-08-16T09:19Z,A link to a third party site is unacceptable as a track list and album info.  Get off your lazy but and present it right.  Winamp makes a track list in a snap.  Amazon gives you all you need. Just copy and paste.  You're just plain old LAZY!
,lolablau,2010-08-16T11:10Z,"maybe you try the file list - the ""12"" where it says ""Files""
you will expierience that a complete list of files opens in the box below where you can read it.
no reason for producing redundant information all the time ..."
,lioliolio,2010-08-16T17:37Z,"ddawg, thx for the input, but I find it by far more informative to get the - sometimes very complex - information about a release and all its versions from an accurate online source like discogs.
often you can see videos or hear music samples there and then decide if you still like the music or download just the tracks you like.
I am not too lazy uploading accurate information but I prefer to improve discogs database and then to link the result, everyone can edit discogs. and it is only one klick away. as of my opinion this is how the internet works, sorry ...."
,WillDBeest,2012-01-15T11:49Z,I have got the other Sabres albums you have put up here and just wanted to say thanks for all of them!
