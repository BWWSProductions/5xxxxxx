,pb1000,2010-08-22T01:40Z,"suzygaga, yes, once you've downloaded it, you can then burn it onto a DVD-R."
,agro_pudding,2010-09-09T03:20Z,@coolio3121  the first upload had spam attached to it and was encrypted so it would only play if you paid to download a unique player. Be careful with IMAGINE's downloads

A:8
V:4

Still not bad though, I love the series so I gotta hand it to ya."
