NOTES: 


IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Step Up 3 

Right,first thanks to boobies for the audio,synced by Lu ....nice work guys.The video is the russian video 
off UG,so thanks to them aswell. 
This was just a quick clean up job and then muxed with boobies already synced audio. 
The source video was dark and colours were off.....so made a light script to change the brightness,contrast,white balance, 
rgb colours with some added sharpness 
Video source itself was also cropped and as camera movement.....and also in some scenes top of some peoples heads are missing and 
there is a fair amount cropped off the right. 
Oh also,even though the name is 3D it is actually in 2D......before ya ask 
Anyway enjoy
