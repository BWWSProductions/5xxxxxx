Step onto the pitch and play professional football your way in FIFA 09. This year's edition features new customizable mouse and keyboard controls that deliver deeper, more intuitive command over your squad for more fluid football action. Now utilize the mouse as a point-and-click tool to send teammates on runs, make pin-point accurate passes, and blast powerful shots on target. Plus, you have the tools to draw up trick moves using the mouse or perform one of 32 skill moves in your arsenal, including new scoop turns, rainbow flicks, heel-to-heel knocks and ball rolls just like Ronaldinho.

FIFA 09 on PC also now features new, leading-edge visuals that deliver graphics that exploits the power of hi-spec gaming PCs, as requested by PC gamers. Star players are featured in photorealistic quality with remodeled likenesses that show off skin tones and muscles in greater detail for ultra-realistic action.
