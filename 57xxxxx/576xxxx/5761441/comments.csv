,crushh12,2010-11-12T15:09Z,"Evryone i have a FIX!
first you must download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5291982/CXZ_Game_Engines_%5BMAC%5D. This is a CXZ Port that will allow you to run the game.

Once it has finished eject all mounted volumes and then open the dmg/zip/rar file again. Open FIFA 09 and it runs beautifully !"
,alifun,2010-11-13T23:32Z,"confirmed working on mac mini snow leopard with CXZ game engine. Just google it or smth and it should be fine.
Graphically I can't tell if thats a lot worse, but it works."
,rmoul20,2010-11-18T04:47Z,"i have the cxz game engines prior to this game and the game still doesn't work. almost a great port. 

qutaiba1 - download pro evolution soccer 2010. it is an official port and a good game"

,Lucas121,2011-05-07T00:55Z,"I have the same probem as everyone else, the game runs fine until any sort of gameplay (parctice, game, anything) starts up.
