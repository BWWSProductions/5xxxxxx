In Burn Zombie Burn the player controls a character called Bruce, against a never ending horde of various zombies. The objective of the game is kill as many zombies as possible before he dies, whilst reaching certain score thresholds that unlock more of the game. The game is an arena based shooter. The core mechanic, as described in the gameâ€™s title, is about setting zombies on fire. In order to score high, the player has to set zombies on fire and each zombie on fire adds to their score multiplier. Burning zombies are also more dangerous as they run faster and deal more damage to the player if they get too close.

The game is split across six levels with varying layouts. Each level also has a unique event that is triggered by the â€œBig Red Buttonâ€. Attaining three consecutive weapon combos activates the button. Each event will normally help the player in some way but later in the game they can also harm him.




There are four game modes in the game and all are available on startup. However, unlocking levels within each mode has to be done by the player. There is also an optional Tutorial present.

    * Freeplay â€“ The simplest of the four modes; as the player just has to survive and score high.

    * Defense â€“ This has the player protect Bruceâ€™s girlfriend Daisy, whoâ€™s stationary and normally positioned in the center of each level. In order to protect Daisy the player must set zombies on fire and kill enough of them to produce a health pickup for Daisy.

    * Timed â€“ The player starts with a five minute limit and he has to kill flaming zombies so that they drop a time pickup, which replenishes the timer.

    * Challenges â€“ There are a total of ten challenges in the game, with varying objectives. These normally isolate certain game mechanics and place them in tougher scenarios for the player to complete.
