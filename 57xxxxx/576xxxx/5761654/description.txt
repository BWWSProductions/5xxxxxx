PLOT: Summer vacation in Mountain's Edge, a sprawling 
two-square-mile subdivision of three-story half-million-dollar 
catalogue homes in suburban Denver. At the heart of the subdivision, 
its own fleet of soccer fields, manicured and gleaming - a game in 
play, a swarm of 12-year-olds running from end to end, moms and dads 
in that "off-duty Hollywood" look. At the foot of the subdivision: 
The desert to one side, long and dry, and endless-looking. To the 
other side, a span of high-desert foothills, rolling upward into the 
greener, higher mountains. It is here that two sets of kids - neighbors 
in both landscape and loss - will wake one morning to find that their 
paths begin to resemble that of a character in their favorite mythological 
book series. What they don't yet know is that an invisible darkness 
following them is what they make it out to be - themselves, their fears 
about their parents, the frequency of change in their lives, and the 
instability of a world lived on the mountain's edge.
