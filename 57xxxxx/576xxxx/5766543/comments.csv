,parasites,2010-08-17T08:51Z,"Warning.
Do not click on Party Poker. 
It puts Antimalware Doctor on your computer. Antimalware Doctor is  rogue anti-spyware, a total scam. It will give you nothing but trouble. It stops you from using your computer. Also Party Poker puts this a annoying popup on your screen when your on the net.
I have a few computers and how I know its coming through facebook is thats the only site my daughter goes on. and its only that coumpter thats infected."

I personaly hated this movie and thought it was just tooo damn cheesey.  No wonder JCVD didnt want anything to do with this film.   I thought the role Jason Statham was horrible.. I found it stupid how he that he would ride a crouch rocket and it was trying to apear cool to a young generation.  But it was just stupid.  I want to drop kick Jason statham in the head.  What a waste of my time"
,Felesar,2010-08-22T07:49Z,"Really been letting us down lately on the up's Ray... audio here is wicked bad. Not your best up brother.
Find a better version. The poor audio here kills the film. Just saying."
