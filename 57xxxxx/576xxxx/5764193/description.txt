This program helps you create photo albums and share them with friends as e-mail, Web photo albums, or print-outs. The installation runs quickly and the program launches automatically. The interface is not that impressive, but all functions and features work magnificently. For example, most programs make you enter a menu to rotate an image, but FotoFusion does it with one click. You can browse, enlarge, edit perfunctorily, and line up or auto-jumble images into a collage, the software helping you all the way through. You can increase the size of your collages with a roll of your mouse wheel. All the functions are lined up as buttons at the top, right under the menu, making this the only program wherein the main menu is the waste of space. The bottom line is, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better program for sharing your photos.
