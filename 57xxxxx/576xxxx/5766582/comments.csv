[T],ctang,2010-08-16T21:08Z,ok i got my hands on date night and it will be next and then the next karate kid and then the naked mile (got another copy of it)
[T],zombifuzz,2010-08-16T21:24Z,"hey man long time no talk.  i actually thought you didnt upload any more because i started typing ""DVD R"" into the search bar rather than ""Ctang"" and your uploads didnt come up.  i wanted to thank you for Kick Ass & Cop Out.  there were too many comments those torrents pages so i figured id leave it here so you could see it.  now i know its best to type the uploaders name into the search rather than just ""DVD R"".  i would have missed out on some great quality movies.  hope all is well man."
,GUYMOVIE,2010-08-17T05:02Z,thank you.....and the karate kid is new one or old one?again thanks for naked mile...looking for it.
