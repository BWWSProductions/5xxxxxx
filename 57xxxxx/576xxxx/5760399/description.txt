Plot:
"Edge Of The Empire" is based on a 1973 novel by Sanya Pholprasit. Set in southern Mongolia over 1,000 years ago, a small tribe called Tai was a colony under the power of the Great Han who enslaved them. Oppressed by the Han, the Tai unites to strike back for their freedom, justice, and country. This Thai historical epic revolves around heroes who sacrificed themselves to fight against the invasion of intruders and sought for the freedom of the country.
