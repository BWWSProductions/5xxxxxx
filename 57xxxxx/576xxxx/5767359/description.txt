Jejune is the name of a band which formed in the mid-90s at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. The three founding members, Arabella Harrison, Joe Guevara and Chris Vanacore, met while studying at the college. The band relocated to San Diego, California, in 1997.  Many of Jejune's songs fit the construct and sensibilities of the emotional hardcore genre.  Intimate verses of melodic, melancholic reflection ascend to choruses of extreme musical and emotional intensity. Among similar bands of the time, Jejune's use of blended male/female vocals and pop sensibility helped to make them stand out.
