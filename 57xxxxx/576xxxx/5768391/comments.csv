,Gngrlss,2010-08-17T03:07Z,"Because this is such a large torrent, I suggest that you download each .iso individually. That way, you'll be able to get a full dvd quicker. Once one is downlaoded, start the second one."
,oversoul53,2010-08-19T04:59Z,"now I have a question, after I burn the discs I'm trying to rip all the episodes off of them so I can put them as .avi files on my computer.

what's the best program for this?

I tried Magic DVD Ripper, but they come out blurry

I tried Bitripper but they come out widescreen

and I tried a freware program called ""Convert DVD to AVI"" but the audio is unsynchronized with the video, and the file sizes are way too big"
,oversoul53,2010-08-19T06:05Z,"EDIT: I found a good program, and it rips the files VERY nicely, they are crystal clear, but now I have another issue... usually the dvdrips I download are about 175mb a piece, but mine 330mb for some reason, why is that? and how do I make them smaller?"
,oversoul53,2010-08-19T07:49Z,"the hell with it, I give up... everything I try turns out with a jumpy image or low audio.

I have a request Gngrlss, can u or anyone else who downloaded this, please upload all the episodes as .avi files?

I've tried but I just cannot seem to get good copies... :("
,Gngrlss,2010-08-19T07:50Z,I assume you mean you usually download individual episodes that are 175 mb and you ripped the episodes from this and they are 330 mb? I imagine that is because you ripped them straight from the dvd so they are higher quality than a tv rip. You could probably re-rip them and tinker with the settings to make them lower quality and therefore smaller.
,Gngrlss,2010-08-19T07:52Z,I'm not going to rip all these into individual .avi files. Someone else please feel free to do that. Why not just mount it and watch? Or burn to a dual layer dvd (if you can)
,TheEnlightened,2010-08-21T04:17Z,"For anybody that's having a problem watching this great torrent I have a solution for you! 

Please download the VLC Media Player @ http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

Then install it & just open the VTS_02_0 Vob File on any of the disks to play any episode. BTW, you can even convert any episode using the VLC Media Player too!

So thanks for the torrent Gngrlss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,MrSketchtastic,2010-08-21T13:00Z,"Well this is SEASON 7 not SEASON 8.Some people say in U.K it's season 8,but that's sounds stupid.Still pretty good rip."

,oversoul53,2010-08-21T13:44Z,"@MrSketchtastic 

it's VOLUME 8, not season.

the Family Guy DVDs are different than most shows.

this volume contains the 2nd half of Season 7 and the first half of season 8

S07 Episodes 10-16

S08 Episodes 01-08"
,Gngrlss,2010-08-22T04:29Z,"Glad to see we're getting some seeders. I know it's a big torrent, but what do you expect for straight dvd rips? WITH DELETED SCENES EVEN! I hope everyone enjoys these as much as I did and shows their appreciation by seeding!

By the way, deleted scenes and such are on disc 3


@MrSketchtastic: Nobody said anything about Seasons, as oversoul53 explained, FamilyGuy releases their dvds through volumes that include the second half of one season and the first half of the next. So yes, this torrent is exactly as advertised.

@TheEnlightened: If you're able to get to the vob files, then that means you're able to mount the iso, which means you can just open the disc in any media player, as I said I use VLC, I also have HP QuickPlay on my laptop which works quite well. I find it less confusing to just run the whole disc. That way, you get the dvd menus."
,MrSketchtastic,2010-09-03T08:19Z,oh ok sorry ...still a very good rip  people please seed 19.26 gb we need at least 100 to speed it up i been downloading disc 2 for a week now
,TheEnlightened,2010-09-06T13:30Z,"@MrSketchtastic 

Please stop complaining about seeding as there are plenty of seeds already. I suggest you learn how to configure your router or port so you can download at a faster rate. There are plenty of videos on YT that will show you how whether you're using Bittorrent or Utorrent. "
,MrSketchtastic,2010-09-09T05:31Z,"@TheEnlightened shut the fuck up I wasn't complaining,I don't use wack ass bittorrent or utorrent..i use limewire and every other torrent is just as fast with little seeders I'm just having problems with this one it's damn near 20 gigs with eleven seeders jackass "
,TheEnlightened,2010-09-11T02:48Z,"@MrSketchtastic 

Don't get upset with me just because you happen to use Limewire for torrents. If you would only use a better program like Bittorrent it wouldn't have taken you a week to download 1 disc. So your ignorance & name calling only shows that you're a complete fool!    "
,MrSketchtastic,2010-09-12T22:04Z,"@TheEnlightened  I didn't mean it actually took weeks to download ,I mean it took more than a few hours I was being sarcastic.Limewire is fine,bittorrent sucks limewire instantly starts the download bittorrent takers forever and it's slower...this actually took like 24hrs to download disc 2 ....disc 1 like 4-5 hours for some reason. "
[T],karl2802,2010-10-20T11:54Z,Is it me or have I just spent a long time d/l disc 3 to find out it's disc 2 again? Thanks for the u/l though.
[T],karl2802,2010-10-20T13:32Z,Scrap last comment. It was just my virtual drive being stupid! :@ Thanks again for the u/l.
[T],trialNerror,2010-10-22T08:49Z,"Thanks a ton for upping this.  Works with no problems here.  If you don't mind, may I post a repack of this so each disc fits on one standard dvd-r?  I've checked playback quality and it still looks real good.  All original aired ep's, subs, extras, and commentary still included."
,Gngrlss,2010-11-14T19:57Z,@trialNerror: Feel free to do whatever you want :)
