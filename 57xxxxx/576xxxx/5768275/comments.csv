Only peck1234 upload the best office 2010 but only for few days then gone. Luckily i downloaded it. Pls thethingy upload the real & true office 2010 /w good & real activation, no offend. We are not dumb we can also download trial ver in microsoft. Don't waste our time & bandwidth."
[V],thethingy,2010-08-17T01:42Z,"dexdrex007, well you say your not dumb but clearly you are an idiot, you cant download this from Microsoft unless you have a technet subscription which since your monitoring pirate bay then clearly you dont have one, you think peck uploaded a real one but you are to thick to realise he deleted it as it was 180 day activation, ALL office 2010 retail and corporate editions are 180 day activation so clearly you are to stupid to realise that you can simply activate again after the 180 days and its just not hard and if I had a monkey and a spare 5 minutes then we would have the worlds first office activating monkey. Now if you are so concerned about having to activate something twice a year then buy the fucking thing but you will still have to activate 2 times a year."

,pirate-love,2010-08-17T08:55Z,"Actually, there are two ways to activate Office 2010. The first option is KMS. The second option is MAK (multiple activation key), which is a product key that only needs to be applied once and then the software is permanently activated.
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-workspace-help/activate-volume-editions-of-microsoft-office-HA010381834.aspx?CTT=5&origin=HA010354227 and http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee624349.aspx

Retail versions (single-user licenses) of Office 2010 purchased from electronic stores cannot use KMS for activation. In order to do so, they must be converted into volume license. So retail editions use MAKs, but the amount of allowed activations are very limited based on the EULA of the product suite. However, the MAK for volume license versions allow as many activations as a company needs. Also, VL versions using a multiple activation key can have the amount of activations increased if the product key has reached zero. 

I have a x86 Office 2010 Professional Plus VL permanently activated through a MAK that I got from Baz2017. I also have thethingy's KMS activator saved on my computer. Using KMS is better than nothing at all or going for OpenOffice, especially if you are thinking of replacing your old office software with this or if you never had MS Office before. KMS is a valid method of activating Office 2010. Regardless of whether you download a KMS activator or find a working MAK, both do the same thing: activate your new software. I recommend using what is available to you."

,tacojew22,2010-08-29T04:30Z,"Wow, Dex is a little bitch!"
[V],thethingy,2010-08-29T06:18Z,"unix66, it doesent last for just 180 days, what you think after 180 days it self destructs or something?, it activates again and as you are clearly stupid then all office apps are now 180 day activation, the trials are 30 day and you cant download this as its from technet"
,pirate-love,2010-08-29T07:04Z,"unix66, you're confusing KMS activation with a trial extender. The activators thethingy uploaded do more than just rearm trials. Trial versions from the official site expire in 30 days. Trial extenders are limited to only 5 rearms, which equals 180 days. After the 180 days from the trial extender, the trial is no longer activated and every application in Office 2010 goes into reduced-functionality mode.

However, KMS activators (which work on full VL versions) have unlimited uses, which means that someone can continue activation of added 180 days as many times as he/she wants. The suggested amount to run the activator is twice a year. (KMS requires renewal every 180 days.) Although, since there aren't any limits of how many times the activator can be used, one could manually renew the software on a daily basis so it's always at ""180 days."" Some KMS activators even reactivate automatically before the 6 months are over. These KMS activators are meant to simulate the KMS hosts corporations use. So if you're using KMS on a full version, it does not only last for 180 days.  You can use the activator multiple times either before or during the initial 6 month period to continue activation. Every time you reactivate, it gives you another set of 180 days."

,Tuzito,2010-09-04T04:28Z,"Hello fellas, Im not a rookie in software-related stuff but I have much to learn yet... so I ask:

It is possible to download the Office2010 trial version from http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/try/ (to get get this earlier) and then use some rtm activator to get it functional?
Is there any difference or you get the same result if you download the torrented version?

Thanks in advance for any answer and VERY SPECIAL THANKS for the thethingy (I've posted in other torrents pages of yours). As long as I become a pirate too, I've never see another uploader keep track for their stuff or take the time to write-back for both good and crap posts. It says a lot of you as person. Please continue and, from Peru, this humble pirate recognizes your time and work.

,pirate-love,2010-09-04T07:46Z,"Tuzito, yes, you can download a trial from MS, use the trial product key you're e-mailed to install it, and then use an activator to convert that trial version (which is retail) into volume license so you can use KMS activation. Raz0r's O2ACK 1.6 won't work since it doesn't list home and student, home and business, and professional within its retail to VL converter. I recommend CODYQX4's Office 2010 Toolkit and EZ-Activator. http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/18746-Office-2010-Toolkit-and-EZ-Activator. According to the read me, CODYQX4's toolkit will convert your office suite into professional plus since there aren't any VL versions of home and business, home and student, or professional. 

There are more steps involved if you download the trial, but it's the same result."
