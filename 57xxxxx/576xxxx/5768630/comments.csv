,LindaM77,2010-08-17T17:12Z,Thanks a lot!!
,TruthCouncil,2010-08-18T02:15Z,As you know; much appreciated!
,yz144,2010-08-18T05:01Z,"seems like everyone can play this but me... ive tried WMP, VLC, quicktime, Itunes, nothing works... wtf guys?

thanks."
,BrookesDad,2010-08-18T05:56Z,I cant either. tried everything yz144 did including programs like divx and nero in the offchance. nothing doing
,yz144,2010-08-18T22:48Z,"I wish he would upload them in the normal 1 part .avi or something instead of this 3 part .mp4 BS that doesnt play in any program?!?

it sucks, degrassi S10 was doing good until E16 :("
,mc_homes,2010-08-18T23:24Z,this worked fine for me in vlc.  you should upgrade your vlc or klite codecs and use mpc and stop complaing pz144.  you should be appreciative instead of being a little bitch.  and i thought ep 16 was the best so far in season 10.  most of season 10 has sucked so far.  ep 17 and 18 were ok but it both the pregnancy and the pedo are reused storylines.  that kinda sucks but better than trivial hooking up plotlines i suppose :p
,TruthCouncil,2010-08-18T23:42Z,These play perfectly fine for me. I use VLC. Make sure yours is updated I guess?
,P2P-ftw,2010-08-19T03:03Z,"yz144
""I wish HE would"" way to generalize :P and get your codecs fixed.

TO THE REST WHO CANT PLAY, THAT DIDNT DELETE  TRY Media player classic. ANOTHER FIX ive been told to to rename the file format from MP4 to FLV"
,strawberry_kiwi,2010-08-19T23:33Z,"Doesn't work on my VLC, but I followed advice from here and downloaded Media player classic and it works great!"
,yz144,2010-08-21T06:11Z,"I tried downloading the latest version of VLC and got a .dmg file that I cant open.

my windows media player classic doesnt work. says it needs a codec even though I have them all... well thought I did. these are the only files ive ever had a problem with... the other ones are uploaded in .avi format...

its nice because I put them on a USB stick and put them in the xbox 360 and play them on the big screen. sometimes I have to watch them on the laptop but I cant even get them to play on the laptop.. guess ill have to wait until someone else uploads the torrent elsewhere or try to download another version of VLC.

thanks anyways."
