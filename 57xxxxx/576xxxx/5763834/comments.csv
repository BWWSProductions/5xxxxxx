I once knew a microsoft tech. specialist that made house calls to important people and knew his stuff.  He taught me one of the most important things about all computers is to leave them on.  I understand laptops aren't possible but desktops for sure.  We have a 20 year old HP that works still with no major hardware issues ever, we had to replace the fan once, that's it.  Just food for thought.  
Thanks for the torrents, the seeding and all that jazz, keep up the good work : )

And don't be so crazy people! 
This movie is a kinda shitty 1980's flick anyways, that's why there's only 2 available torrentz."
