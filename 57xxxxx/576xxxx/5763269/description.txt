The Timeâ€¦ Five Years After the Nuclear War. The Survivors.. Post-Nuke Thrill Freaks Lookin' for a Kick.
Able to exist, to senseâ€¦ to feel everything but pleasure.
In a world destroyed, survivors break down to those who can and those who can't. 99% are Sex Negatives. Call them erotic casualties. They want to make love, but the mere touch of a person make them violently ill. The rest, the lucky one percent, are Sex Positives, those libidoes escaped unscathed. After the Nuclear Kiss, the positives remain to love, to performâ€¦ and the others, well, we Negatives can only watchâ€¦, can only comeâ€¦toâ€¦ CafÃ© Flesh.
