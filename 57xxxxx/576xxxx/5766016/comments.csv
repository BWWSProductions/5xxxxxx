Thornography does not.

Damnation and a Day was the last great album.

I included Nymphetamine just 'cause there is some worthy material.

The albums that followed are shit however."

""Albums that matter"", fuck that. If you loved any of Cradles work, there is no exceptions. To realize the real perfections it does take some time, so stop being """"""ignorant"""""""

Also, you don't have to dick ride a band if you like their music.  Some albums are good, some are god-like, and some just aren't - what's ignorant is people thinking they're obligated to like anything they truly think is shit, simply to appear ""loyal.""  I can still appreciate the genius and beauty of Damnation and a Day while cringing at the thought that this once-amazing band would turn to something akin Glam Metal.  You should listen to the things you enjoy, not the things people expect you to enjoy."
