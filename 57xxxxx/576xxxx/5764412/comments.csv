,redrain7,2010-08-15T06:22Z,"This would be an Amazing idea!!  I'm always trying to watch Charger games, but I live in Oregon and have to watch them through streaming sites.   It's also impossible for me to watch them on days I work so this would be awesome!"
,prowlerkdc,2010-08-15T15:17Z,"I would love it. A year or so ago I tried to offer a bunch, including playoff games and not too many people were interested. The leechers dried up really fast. If you get more interest than I did, I will be glad to contribute some!"

[V],phatwarez,2010-08-15T20:44Z,I get a bunch of sports channels including the nfl network which just replays games all day long. A lot of the time games come on at the same time other people are watching tv so I can't always rip primetime games. Do you guys care if they're 0day?
,redrain7,2010-08-15T22:21Z,I wouldn't mind at all if the games were released a bit late.  I would definitely try and get the word out.  I think the only reason there's not that many people is because no one know about it.  I've seen thousands of people on streaming sites where the quality is horrible.

,Dumler,2010-08-16T15:32Z,Fantastic! Keep 'em coming matey! So if I understood you have NFL Gamepass? or what? 
,MADILI,2010-08-20T09:14Z,"Keep up the good work man, if somebody is looking for more games try this site:

The best one I found so far, it's all about nfl en college football!"
,kow626,2010-08-29T16:56Z,"please keep 'em coming! i'm a buffalo fan and nfl network in my area decided not to air yesterday's cincinatti game. they changed it to another game and that sucks for me. i went online looking for torrents since i wasn't home to catch the live stream. that's how i discovered you. whenever you up the cinci/buff game, i'll dl it, watch it, gauge the quality, and if it's good, i'll put the word out. if you can release them faster, that's even better!"
