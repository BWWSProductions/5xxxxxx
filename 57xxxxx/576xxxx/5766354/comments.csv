idiots
great rip, big tanks to the uploader and the ripper :)
mp4 container: avc video + aac audio (stereo only, I prefer stereo to 5.1)
to play use mpc-hc or vlc or ffdshow+haali media splitter!
google them."
[V],Alia_Erenel,2010-09-10T00:16Z,Cheers.
,laned130,2010-09-10T03:22Z,"A: 8
No glitches, and in sync throughout, but only stereo.
V: 9
Again, no glitches, just a couple more artefacts than I would expect for this file size.

Overall, very watchable. Many thanks for the up."
