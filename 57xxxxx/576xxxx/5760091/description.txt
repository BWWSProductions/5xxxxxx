Here we have Wolfgang Sawallisch conducting both the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Berliner Philharmoniker, playing Johannes Brahms' complete orchestral works. This 7 CD set is fantastic, and definitely worth a thorough listen.

The works on here include:
All four of Brahms' symphonies (if you download anything, download the 4th Symphony, it is sublime)
Both of Brahms' piano concertos (played by Stephen Kovacevich)
Tragic Overture
St. Anthony Variations
Schicksalslied (Song of Destiny)
Academic Festival Overture
Violin Concerto in D
Mozart's third violin concerto (I don't know why this is on here...)
Double Concerto
Horn Trio in E flat
Two Songs Op. 91

I tag my classical music very strictly. See http://www.scene24.net/1203.html for details.

Format is 256k VBR AAC. This should sync up very nicely with iTunes.
