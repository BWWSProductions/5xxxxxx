,Salchichon,2010-08-17T00:19Z,Poppedtart is there a way to put subtitles in my ipod?
,biorisk,2010-08-17T00:44Z,Hey PT I've been a big fan for a long time now and have really enjoyed the quality of your work.  I notice that I've never had a problem playing anything I get from you on my PS3 and was wondering if there is anybody else that you know who puts up similar movies with the same .mp4 extensions?  Thanks for everything you do.
[V],poppedtart,2010-08-17T02:17Z,I am not aware of anyone other than HR.
