Fresh off the Comiket presses, it\'s Touhou Project 12.8, Fairy Wars, also known as Yousei Daisensou ~ Touhou Sangessei

Continuing the story begun in the Sangetsusei manga, Fairy Wars tells the story of the day Cirno declared war on the three faeries, Sunny Milk, Luna Child, and Star Sapphire.. Among others.

From the Touhou Wikia:
\"Cirno freezes the bullets instead of dodging them\".

From Cirno\'s perspective, bullet patterns are denser than usual, forcing her to use her \"secret weapon\", the Ice barrier. The Ice Barrier freezes bullets, allowing Cirno to destroy them, giving her more room to dodge.
