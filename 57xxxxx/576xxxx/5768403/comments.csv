,scorted,2010-08-18T01:45Z,"Much better copy. Audio is decent, more than watchable. V5 A5. Thanks for the upload!

My 2p... Just a shame the film is utter rubbish. I was expecting a real oldskool 80s action flick, wow, what a letdown and it doesnt even have a half decent plot to save it. :("
,spursxspurs,2010-08-18T02:01Z,"the sample sounds much better that the others 
a7 v7,

i ranked the ratings based on the sample video. 
again, good work raymondhome 
thanks for the upload"
,hwb3517,2010-08-21T02:00Z,very watchable but yes the audio is very powerful i watched on vlc used the equalizer also the eng subs over cerilic/russ subs was cool id say a9 cause it is so powerful but out of sync at one point but comes back not annoying or anything just there  v8 because of people in front of screen
,hwb3517,2010-08-21T02:06Z,@spusxspurs thats why you use vlc so you can adjust the bright and contrast thru tools and adj sound on eq
,blazzox,2010-08-21T23:28Z,"ok

,franjuacisco,2010-08-25T00:18Z,v/5 a/7
,redox1,2010-08-25T18:00Z,Not a bad movie. Not a classic but some good stuff in there. Watchable print but probably worth waiting for dvd to get a better look at the fight scenes.
,swakkenhammer,2010-08-26T03:08Z,"@hulkslim
Maybe Chuck Norris also?"
,swakkenhammer,2010-08-26T03:10Z,"@hulkslim
