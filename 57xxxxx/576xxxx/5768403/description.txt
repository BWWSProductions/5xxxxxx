NOTES
The Expendables russian video source ............ thanks
The Expendables.mp3 ............ OWN
The Expendables.srt file ............ CLASSiFiED and OWN, thanks

Right where to start ... well first thing we did was make our own .srt file and hardcoded them.
The subtitles are mainly made up of the subs classified did ... but they missed a few so we translated them ourselves.
For the subtitles we opted not to blur the russian text but go over it in yellow english subs.
The video ... this was a small file with low res and was filmed at a bad angle ... also slightly cropped.
Well we fixed the angles and then filtered the video changing the contrast, brightness, rgb colours, hue, sharpness and also reduced the glares, which in turn makes it a little dull.
The audio was nice but very powerful and lots of bass ... so we filtered the audio and lowered the levels ... still some distortion on very loud scenes but overall very nice line indeed :)

Now just to let users know ... the relizlab video seems to be upscaled along with alot of other videos of this popping up ... Just incase you wonder why we have opted for a low res. Well even we have upscaled this, but not too much other wise it looks worse.
Heres some screens to show you the difference.....
