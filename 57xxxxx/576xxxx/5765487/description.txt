Crossing the Line.
Documentary series following the traffic police as they enforce the law on some of Britain's busiest and most dangerous roads. In Brighton, 'smash and grab' raiders have been doing a little late night shopping, and the police helicopter has teamed up with the traffic cops in the hunt for the gang to make sure they don't get away without paying. Near Hastings, the cops have got another battle on their hands, dealing with raging motorists who ignore the law.
