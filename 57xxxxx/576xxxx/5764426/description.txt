A remix/mashup/megamix/medley I did with various songs from my two favorite currently-active female musicians. :P [Some males who collaborated with one of the two are also sampled in this]

This is the 3rd mix. 
[The included video (otherwise-static image with lyrics subtitles) is based on the slightly-different 2nd mix]


Artist: DJ Royal [Yeah, I do figure there are others who also use that name]
Album: The K.L. Flaga Megamix
Date: 2010
Genre: Mashup

Included files:
Track 1 - The song [FLAC]
Track 2 - K. Flay, MC Lars, Aesias Finale vocals [FLAC]
Track 3 - Instrumental [FLAC]
Track 4 - Lady Gaga, Colby O'Donis, Space Cowboy, Wale vocals [FLAC]

lyrics [TXT]
further notes [TXT]

* I did not have stems or acapella/instrumental breakdowns for some of the songs I used, so the vocal tracks carry some instrumental and the 'instrumental track' is basically a reinforcement.
