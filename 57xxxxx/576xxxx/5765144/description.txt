The Fagans are one of Australiaâ€™s pre-eminent folk music families, known for their spine-tingling harmonies and musical versatility. Folk revivalists Margaret and Bob Fagan are joined by their son, ace bouzouki player James Fagan and his partner Nancy Kerr, fiddle player extraordinaire, as well as their daughter Kate Fagan, acclaimed folk-roots songwriter.

The Fagans are an internationally-based band. Margaret, Bob and Kate live in Sydney, Australia, while James and Nancy live in the UK where they perform as a duo and with concertina player Robert Harbron. James and Nancy have netted two prestigious BBC2 Folk awards including Best Duo. Kateâ€™s debut album Diamond Wheel won Australiaâ€™s National Film & Sound Archive award for â€˜Best Folk Albumâ€™.

Bruce Elder (Sydney Morning Herald) described Kate as â€œa major Australian talentâ€ and compared her songwriting to Joni Mitchellâ€™s. Margaret and Bobâ€™s fine singing and rich folk repertoire have earned them a respected place in Australian folk history. Together The Fagans take their audience on an uplifting and powerful journey with their great repertoire of songs from Australia, USA & the British Isles.
