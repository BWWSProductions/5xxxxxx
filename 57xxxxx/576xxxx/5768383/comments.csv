,spitzu,2010-08-17T11:05Z,"I don't usually ruin movies by watching cams, but I skimmed through this and it is fairly watchable, more so than most.

A6/V6."
,3_3_3,2010-08-17T11:35Z,"sample is a5 v5 , it has an head silhouette half way, so my guess is that this would be a CAM rather than TS"
,beerman100,2010-08-17T14:03Z,"@3_3_3

 TS refers to the sound only, not the picture. So yes it is a cam, however it has line audio (ie. it has been recorded through a theatre headphone jack).

So yes it is a cam (picture) TS (sound)."
,spitzu,2010-08-17T23:39Z,"Well, I just watched the movie and I would like to revise my ratings.  Thanks for the upload, but it was dark as hell throughout the entire movie.  I couldn't tell what the hell was going on most of the time.

A6/V3"

beerman10 has already corrected you, and for the benefit of others reading comments i can confirm that your comment should be ignored by all, you should learn at least the basics of the subject that you decide to comment on or shut the fuck up, because you have only proved that you are an idiot with your stupid comment.

You have contributed NOTHING and SaM has a large history of shared torrents so how dare you even attempt to downgrade his ACCURATE description of this torrent with your idiot remark.

Get an education or shut up!"
,michaelrwatson,2010-08-18T02:07Z,"@beerman100, @da7id

You are both wrong (moreso than 3_3_3 in fact).

A TS (telesync) is a CAM (yup) that can sync with the frame rate of the projector, e.g. 24fps. Some high-end cams can do this. And, as one of you dumbfucks also noted, a TS also requires line audio to be considered a ""TS"". 

Thus, THIS IS A CAM because it has flicker (not terrible but noticeable), even though it has line audio.  "
,michaelrwatson,2010-08-18T02:09Z,"Hmm, but having said that, it's a good cam. FOR A CAM. Check out the sample--it shows how much flicker there is."
,michaelrwatson,2010-08-18T02:13Z,"WHERE THE FUCK DID MY COMMENT GO, you FAGGOTS?"
,beerman100,2010-08-18T03:24Z,"@michaelrwatson

Your comment stated I was wrong and a ""dumbf**k"", then you essentially agreed with what I said. 

I never insult people or put them down & I won't start now, even though in your case - I'm tempted. 

I merely helped out someone to make it easier for them to use TBP to their advantage.

Please, lets keep things civil. All the best.

,michaelrwatson,2010-08-18T03:46Z,"@beerman100:

You wrote ""TS refers to the sound only"" but TS *does* refer to the picture too. So, you were only half right. Sorry for the f-f---- though... hasn't been a good day in Wisconsin."

,3_3_3,2010-08-18T09:55Z,"@da7id
I was merely stating that it looked like a cam, it has silhouettes of the audiences heads. A good TS is filmed from the projector booth on a high definition camera, with an audio line in, preferably on a quiet night when there is no audience to interfere with the result, this is not the case with this film. My comment was a lot more useful to others then your derogatory comment towards me, perhaps it is you that should seek an education."
,da7id,2010-08-18T17:10Z,"@3_3_3

now you are confusing teleCINE with teleSYNC, looks like you don't need any outside assistance to bury yourself in a hole YOU dug!

-> the use of direct (line) audio makes this a TS

-> NOT a CAM (which would use the shitty mic on the recording device)

RTFM or STFU noob"
,notherdaysgoneby,2010-08-18T18:12Z,"All these terms are loosely used because none are technical terms. But unless it is a screener, it is some sort of cam. I speak with experience. To make a TS the best way is to go to a drive-in. Use the time before the movie starts to position your camera. Before you leave the house get one of those radio walk man's. You can get them at the dollar tree. Then a jack that is quarter inch on both sides. Radio shack can hook you up. Plug one end into your walk man after you have tested a station with head phones, the other goes to the mic input on your camera. Record something for a minute or so and then hook your camera up to your TV and test the sound. Too loud and the sound gets distorted, too soft and you can barely hear it. Once you have your sound level it is a good idea to tape the sound button in place. Your ready to record. With the camera on your dash, you can talk, laugh, eat pop corn and no matter what,. you have a perfect audio track, as long as you remember to bring head phones and make sure you get the right station before recording. Other types of TS's are cams that have had Audio that was recorded from what I just talked about put on top of a film recorded with out it originally. A screener is a real DVD that is sent to a video store sometimes months before the release date for store employees to review to better sell the DVD when it gets released to the public. I use to work for a video store so I got them all the time. The real ones often start with the trailer of the film and goes right into the movie with out any features or a menu. Most have words that will come and go on the screen to let you know it is not for retail use. Cams and TS's are often augmented by people with programs to squeeze out a better looking/sounding product. I hope this clears up the cam- TS debate. many users/up-loaders/down-loaders have a different idea as to what a cam/TS and Screener is. and sometimes a TS can look and sound so good you are not sure if it is a screener, because some screeners are not quite as good quality as the official DVD anyway. So it is always a good idea to just download what you want and see for your self if it is good. When I want something i will often download 5 or 6 versions at the same time and see what seems the best. The last one I got of this had such bad sound quality I could not even tell the difference in who's voice was talking. "
