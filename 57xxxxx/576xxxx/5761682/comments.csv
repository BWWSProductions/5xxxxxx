,vandergraaf100,2010-08-17T12:39Z,"Dont know what a TS is but if this is one then it stands for total shit! Dark, Out of synch and damn near impossible to watch! DONT BOTHER WAIT FOR THE DVD!!"
,Vegas68,2010-08-22T22:22Z,A TS is like a Cam it's Crap the R5 Should of been Released Already.This is Crap it's the Same Shit that's Been Posting on here Since April.That's Why I didn't DL.because I know Parts are taken out and the Sound is Awful @ vandergraaf100
