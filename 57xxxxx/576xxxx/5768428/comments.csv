,stervendehoerenkachel,2011-06-24T20:02Z,"I don't know, watched the first episode and it was very weird. It's not showing much, saw a guy who cut his fingers twice and a lot of information about why they cook.
Pretty strange, first challenge is barbecue. How many restaurants use a barbecue to cook a meal on?"
