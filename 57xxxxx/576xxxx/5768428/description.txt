Great cooking competition show. Actually shows occasional cooking instead of made-up drama! Format is currently being destroyed by Gordon Ramesy as Masterchef US, but the Australia show was worth watching. Got all these episodes from TPB, but will seed the entire season for a while in case somebody would like to watch.
