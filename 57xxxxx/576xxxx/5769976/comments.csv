,Grim1028,2011-02-22T11:12Z,"Ok, the description box is for you to list a description about the torrent, not to bitch about people not seeding, rave about some stupid anti-virus program, or brag about your money and time waisting ""supercomputer"". So hows about posting an actual fucking description instead of a link to wikipedia you lazy idiot. If you're gonna upload a torrent, then DO IT RIGHT!"
