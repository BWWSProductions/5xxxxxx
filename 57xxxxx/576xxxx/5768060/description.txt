We are pleased to announce that Open Home (full version) is now at its 4th major version v4.x . Here is a list of note-worthy changes/enhancements/features/bug fixes:

* Allow users to set the default fonts to any home screen widgets. Please note that only default fonts are changed 
  because some widgets have custom fonts and we donâ€™t want to give override them. (menu/more/font & color/Widget font)

* Performance enhancements from android 2.1, now home screen scrolling is much smoother, force close issues are gone 
  for Motorola Droid and HTC Nexus One

* More home screen animations and effects, including an experimental 3D cube transition effect  
  (menu/more/Open home setting/3D cube)

* Live Wallpaper is now supported on Nexus One

* Home Chooserâ€™s default setting check box now works as it should  (menu/more/home chooser)
