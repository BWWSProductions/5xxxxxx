,Chrikkex,2010-09-16T14:57Z,"Excellent quality despite the compression, thanks! The torrent's subtitles are out of sync though, but that's not a problem since you can deactivate them."
,Blushiftr,2010-09-22T08:15Z,"Good Quality and fast download for the size. As another poster said, the subtitles are off. Not a big deal, you can just turn them off."
