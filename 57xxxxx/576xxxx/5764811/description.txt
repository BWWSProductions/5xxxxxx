Description:
Discover what all the other encyclopedias leave out

This is the superbly satisfying compendium of weird factoids too interesting to be contained in your average encyclopedia. Daring to cross-reference the un-cross-reference-able, to alphabetize what cannot be alphabetized, and to deliver the highest concentration of fun that can fit in one book\'s spine, this information is too useless to waste:

In Denmark, pigs go \'knor\'; in Germany, horses go \'prrrh\'; in ancient Greece, dogs went \'au au.\' Italians sneeze \'ecci ecci.\'

A teacher in Italy was disciplined in 1996 for passing students exam answers hidden in salami sandwiches.

In 1957 the U.S. air force completed a survey of the Atlantic Ocean but refused to divulge its width on the grounds that the information might be of military use to the Russians.

In Paris in 1740 a cow was hanged in public following its conviction for sorcery.
