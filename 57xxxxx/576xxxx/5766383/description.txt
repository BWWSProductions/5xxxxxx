[quote]Son of ClichÃ© is perhaps one of the most important radio series ever produced by the BBC. Aside from the fact that it is subversive, intelligent and at times satirical, as well as excellently written and performed, it also formed the basis for BBC TWO's most sucessful sit-com ever. And yet, other than a few Dave Hollins: Space Cadet transcripts, the series is barely documented at all, and most Red Dwarf related writing barely acknowledges its significance.[/quote]

[b]Notes: Son Of Cliche mostly come from home cassette recordings (BBC7 don't seem to have them!)
I stuck them into a cleaner to reduce some of the tape hiss.[/b]
