,matt040,2010-08-16T01:39Z,"how is the quality?
any screenshots please...."
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-16T10:25Z,"It is the best quality to the date. An original DVD-R. If you have a rapid connection, do not hesitate and take it, it will be fast, there are multiple private trackers allowing interchanging peers... private trackers that you will not see but profit by it ;) . Private trackers that are renowned for having speed unlike public ones"

,adityajuneja7,2010-08-17T16:03Z,"fast download??

where from>>

it does not go above 300 kbps"
,SuperVegitoSSJ2,2010-08-18T02:48Z,"@adityajuneja7 O.O My speed remained constantly above 450 kbps and downloading took just like an hour at the most,if your speed doesn't go above 300 kbps then that must be the max speed your net plan is capable of.

@do_not_delete_me_blindly Thanks a lot man,this must be my third torrent download where my speed constantly remained above 450 kbps.There is hardly any difference between any http download and this torrent.
