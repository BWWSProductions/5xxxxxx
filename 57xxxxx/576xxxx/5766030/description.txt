Adopted from the streets of Nasaf by King Sharaman of Persia, young Dastan grows up amongst royalty and quickly earns 

his place as a mighty warrior and prince. As his brothers Garsiv and Tus plan battle strategies, a spy sends word that 

the Holy City of Alamut has been supplying weapons to enemies of Persia. Taking matters into his own hands, Tus orders 

an attack on the sacred city and upon its fall Dastan encounters the beautiful Princess Tamina. When King Sharaman dies 

under mysterious circumstances shortly after, and Dastan is accused of his murder, he flees with the princess on a 

harrowing mission to clear his name. Learning from Tamina the true motives behind Alamut's invasion, Dastan must embark 

on a perilous quest to stop an evil mastermind's plot for ultimate power with a mystical weapon that can control the 

very fabric of time.
