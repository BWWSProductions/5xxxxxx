Brother Clyde is an alternative rock musical group, formed in 2009 by
country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The band initially was to consist
of Cyrus, Jeffrey Steele, John Waite and Phil Vassar. However, in June
2010, Cyrus announced a new line-up for the band, as well as the release
of its debut single, "Lately." The group released its self-titled debut
album on August 10, 2010.
