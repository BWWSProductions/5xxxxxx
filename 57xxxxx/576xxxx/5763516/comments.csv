,PHREEBO,2010-10-15T12:27Z,"WTF?? > DOWNLOAD YOUR aXXo FILES FROM aXXo ACCOUNTS < ??!!
This might have come from aXXo years ago, but abhi is a poser for posting that, this is not an aXXo account, there are no aXXo accounts now, just aXXo fakers. FYI: aXXo came from darkside RG and was on mininova and made comments there, but both are no more.
If you want this collection, get it from Booster2, it's a better rip and the swarm is bigger."
