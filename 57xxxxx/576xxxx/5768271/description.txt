                    The Day Simon Decided It Might Be a Nice Idea  
                    to Surprise His Mother with a Gift.      
                    Simon brings his mum Tanya an extravagant gift  
                    which she refuses to accept. He also tries to  
                    convince her that maybe she shouldn't marry  
                    Clive. It's Liz's birthday, but nobody seems to  
                    care, and Grandad has news from the doctor  
                    about his cancer scare. When Simon decides he  
                    might write a play for the theatre, the family  
                    aren't impressed.
