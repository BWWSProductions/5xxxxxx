COMMENT:
David Axelrod is one of the great artists who has some really great, really rare albums tied up in private trackers that thrive off extreme privacy (Waffles, etc.). We've forgotten our sharing roots with things like this...why share to some and not others? Who gives us the power to say who can and cannot get the same access as another? This is the world we live in but we don't have to always accept it. Do what you can to end their exclusivity; this is just a small part,I urge you to keep it going. Thank you for your time.
