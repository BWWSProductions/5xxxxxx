,wetsnay,2010-08-17T02:59Z,"Hello TT Sir, first let me begin by saying your work is impecappable. 5 ***** 

I have a question.  I have been using your MS Office 2010 RTM.14.0.4734.10 along with your 2010 Activator. NO Problems it has been working flawlessly. 

Recently I picked up a Virus and re-installed 7 ultimate then attempted to install the same product above. I am now receiving the MS Product Activation Failed Notice and this copy of MS Office is NOT Activated. 

I have noticed that you are now running a nice looking new activator and what appears to be a new download for 2010 OFFICE. 

Please advise.

Thanks for your time and once again your seeds are THE BEST. 

Have a good one

I opened the ISO through the DVD it was put on and everythings running...so don't know about this whole ""activating"" part everyone is talking about.

Why does OSPPSVC.exe always appear when I start any program?

x86 is 32 bit right? So if I got Win 7 64 bit it wouldn't work right?"
[V],thethingy,2010-09-13T23:16Z,"birdbird21, (not from Notts are you?), x86 is 32bit and the OSPPSVC.exe file is a Microsoft office file that I think is for activation http://www.runscanner.net/lib/OSPPSVC.EXE.html"
