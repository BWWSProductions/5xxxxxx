           In an old apartment building on the wrong side of the          
           tracks, two women, unknown to each other, live across the      
           hall on the second floor. Galia is an assassin involved        
           against her will with the local sex-traffic mafia. All         
           she wants is to reunite with her little daughter that she      
           left back home in Russia. Eleanor is a grocery store           
           cashier and a battered wife. She dreams of winning the         
           lottery and running away from her abusive husband. Galia       
           and Eleanor don't know each other, but as neighbors they       
           share two things: an adjoining wall and a strong need to       
           plan their escape. As Galia disobeys her latest contract,      
           a woman target, and Eleanor discovers that she's               
           pregnant, the two women decide to take action against          
           their oppressors in a fight for survival and freedom.
