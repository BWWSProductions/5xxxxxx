'A Total Vote of No Confidence in the Obama Presidency'
August 16, 2010 â€¢ 8:49AM

A high-ranking former U.S. government official, who is now on the board of a number of Fortune 500 companies and has close ties to the Federal Reserve, reported that, at a recent gathering of top corporate officials from around the United States, there was a "total vote of no confidence in President Obama," over his administration's wrecking of the entire U.S. economy.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the ex-official described a climate of "profound uncertainty" over the future of the United States, calling Obama the "worst American President in my lifetime," when it comes to the real economy. He described a total freeze in any capital investment or job creation, because "no one knows what this Administration is going to do." He described the consensus of the people with whom he met last month: "We are already in a deep, prolonged Great Depression."

While he chastised the former Bush-Cheney Administration, he emphasized that the Obama team has gone way beyond the disasters of the Bush-Cheney era. "Valerie Jarrett is the designated liaison of the Obama White House to the business community, and all she does is shake them down for campaign money. It is a total disconnect, and there is no way out." He acknowledged that Lyndon LaRouche had been "way ahead" of everyone else, in clinically diagnosing the Obama disease.
