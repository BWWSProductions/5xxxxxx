- After Over Four Decades, Justice Still Eludes Family of 3 Civil Rights Workers Slain in Mississippi Burning Killings

As the Justice Department announces it has closed nearly half of its investigations into unresolved killings from the civil rights era, we look back at the 1964 murders of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, the subject of the new documentary "Neshoba: The Price of Freedom." Although dozens of white men are believed to have been involved in the murders and cover-up, only one man, a Baptist preacher named Edgar Ray Killen, is behind bars today. Four suspects are still alive in the case. We play excerpts of "Neshoba" and speak with its co-director, Micki Dickoff. We're also joined by the brothers of two of the victims, Ben Chaney and David Goodman. And we speak with award-winning Mississippi-based journalist Jerry Mitchell of the Clarion Ledger, who's spent the past 20 years investigating unresolved civil rights murder cases; as well as Bruce Watson, author of the new book "Freedom Summer: The Savage Season That Made Mississippi Burn and Made America A Democracy."
