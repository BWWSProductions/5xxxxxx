Who but John Bedini would retrieve a discarded tape-drive motor from the trash can at NBC and have the vision to convert it into a very efficient little radiant energy battery charger?

In this video, John demonstrates how this capstan motor was converted to provide the sharp pulsing necessary to invoke the radiant energy to drive his system. The brushless tape-drive motor with dual Simplified School Girl (SSG) circuit.

And, being John Bedini, he also provides some unique insights into his motivation for releasing this technology into the public domainâ€”and much more!

Bedini Technical Services Manager Rick Friedrich weighs in as well with his iterations of this motor, now handily bundled into kit form (which can be purchased from his Website) for amateur experimenters to assemble and become familiar with the technology.
