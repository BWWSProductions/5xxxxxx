,xMajesticMeteorx,2011-02-20T16:03Z,"It's a rar file ya'll.  Some of ya can't open those.

Anyway, I'll be back to confirm or deny if it's a ""Fake.""
I gotta check, 'cause sometimes certain msg boards and blogs send trolls out to scream ""Fake"" when it isn't.
But so help me if I ever am able to reconnect with the Swedish guys that run this thing, I'll have them fry the ISP addy of anybody that screws around on here with password torrents."
[T],despo1ler,2011-02-23T05:34Z,"nothing wrong with this torrent, it's exactly what it says on the label, a PDF format EBOOK. It is the title that is given and it is, as far as I can tell by a quick scan through it, complete. 
 It's also interesting to know that this is a series of books, if the film is the success it looks like it should be we will be seeing the rest of the series over the next cpl of years and often reading the book before watching the film can be much better than after. so tyvm for the upload"
