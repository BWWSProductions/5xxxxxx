           Jean-Paul, recently retired, is a hypochondriac... Anne,       
           his wife, is cheating on him with a former office              
           colleague... His daughter Cathie, divorced and mother of       
           a five-year-old son, lives with Philippe, a "fine" young       
           man whom Mathieu, Cathie's gay brother, calls the              
           "retard". After Jean-Paul discovers a small spot on his        
           hip, the family balance literally implodes. Cathie             
           announces that she's marrying "the retard", Mathieu gets       
           dumped after his hesitation to invite his lover to             
           Cathie's wedding, and Jean-Paul accidentally learns that       
           Anne, his wife, is cheating on him. Arguments, settling        
           of scores, insults... Jean-Paul, Anne, Cathie, Mathieu         
           and Philippe are spared nothing! And together cross            
           through a small zone of turbulence...
