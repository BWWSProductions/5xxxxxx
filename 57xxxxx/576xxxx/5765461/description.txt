Plot :

The film follows Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired master car thief who is forced to return to Los Angeles and his former trade to steal 50 cars by Friday morning for British crime boss Raymond Vincent "Carpenter" Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). Raymond is threatening to kill Memphis' younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) through the compactor after not making the deadline. Memphis quickly reassembles his old crew, including his mentor Otto (Robert Duvall) and old girlfriend Sway (Angelina Jolie).


When Memphis arrives at Calitri's salvage yard with the final car, Calitri reneges on their deal, deciding to kill Memphis. After Kip arrives to save him, Memphis heads into the warehouse to settle the score with Calitri, saving Castlebeck when he shows up unexpectedly and sending Calitri falling to his death. Castlebeck lets him go before the police arrive. Later, back at Otto's, the gang celebrates, and Kip gives Memphis a gift: a Shelby GT500 which is heavily damaged, which Otto claims "is a heap, but in a couple a weeks will be a stream-line butterfly".
