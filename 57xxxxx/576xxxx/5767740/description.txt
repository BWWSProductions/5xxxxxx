"Diana Extended: The Remixes" is a remix album released by American soul singer
Diana Ross in 1994.

Six tracks were reworked by some of the biggest names in the industry at the time
and cover Ross' career as a solo artist and as a member of The Supremes, with
Frankie Knuckles updating "Someday We'll Be Together" from 1969.

The set also contains a track released during the diva's stay at RCA (see "Chain
Reaction").

The seventh track is "You're Gonna Love It" a track from the album The Force Behind
the Power. The version on Diana Extended: The Remixes is a short remix available
previously on a 12" single.

The album was only moderately successful on both sides of the Atlantic, reaching #58
on the UK charts and #68 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, while missing the Top
200 entirely. "Someday We'll Be Together" was released as a single and peaked at #
7 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts (April 1994).

The US version of the album was released on Motown, and European/Japanese
versions on EMI. Tracklistings were the same, but special editions were also issued.
Many remixes, including those by Joey Negro, weren't included on the album but
instead only on the many singles released for the club market.
