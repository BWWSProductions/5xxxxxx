Osho - Philosophia Perennis Vol. 2 - Remastered

This is a remastered version to improve sound quality and remove
the defects of the source material, minimize the noise, rumble and
other distracting sound characteristics and make the voice sound
more intimate so your contact becomes more intimate.

P.S.
Some people just download and go away like it is not "their business"
what happens after them. Well, then you are in a wrong company most
likely. This is not the place for you if the only thing you care about
is your own skin. You won't get what you are looking for. Just forget
about it.

Other people download and if they do not see crowds of people downloading,
they don't seed either thinking "well, there is no one interested it seems".
Are you sure?

People may come tomorrow and they may not come in huge crowds.
You have been taken care of one way or the other. Do you care about
anybody else?

Basically, all Osho torrents should have at least 50 seeders each,
and that is from a specific data samples. But what we have instead
is about 1 person out of 50 seeding. Do you think "your problems" are over
once you download it but do not care to seed? Think again...

The bottom line: if you don't seed then you "don't care",
and if you don't care, do not waste your life on Osho to begin with.
Just get lost, and that is about the best thing you can do to yourself.
If your sensitivity only extends to your skin level, then it is phony.
It is just the same ugly ego trip, accumulating, accumulating and
accumulating, hoping to get to "heaven" one day. Sorry, no such pleasures
will be provided in this case.

Otherwise, enjoy.
