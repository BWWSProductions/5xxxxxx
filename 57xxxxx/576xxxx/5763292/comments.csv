HOW TO INSTALL

1. EXTRACT THE FILE YOU DOWNLOADED USING WINRAR OR WINZIP (programs arefree on the internet)
2. ONE YOU HAVE EXTRACTED, RUN THE ""SETUP.EXE""
3. INSTALL THE GAME
4. GO TO THE RAZER1911_REPACK FOLDER AND COPY THE FILES FROM THE BINARIES FOLDER IN BOTH THE MP AND SP TO THE CORRESPONDING BINARIES FILE WHEREVER YOU INTSTALLED THE GAME.
4. RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR
5. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN OFFLINE WINDOWS LIVE PROFILE ALREADY INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER, CREATE A NEW PROFILE BY SCROLLING DOWN IN THE WINDOW TO ""CREATE OFFLINE PROFILE""
6. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS
7. PLAY

Your welcome.  Next time go look it up."

I am using windows 7 ultimate. Here's what I did:-

1. Mount iso using Daemon tools.
2. Install
3. Copy files from the crack folder found in the  iso to there respective folders.
4. Run Bioshock2Launcher.exe

I didn''t have to update or use any sort of file not included with this torrent.

1.Install the game as it says with all the cracks in place. I used the alternate crack download.

2. Run the game using the launcher.

3. When the Games for Windows Live box appears in the game, press ""Create New Account.""

4. When a window comes up that says something along the lines of ""Windows Live requires an internet connection..."" DO NOT PRESS THE CONTINUE BUTTON ON THE RIGHT. 

5. Instead, scroll all the way down to the bottom of the information. It will say ""If you do not wish to experience the benefits that LIVE has to offer, you may -create a local profile-"" Click on ""Create a local profile"" and name it whatever you like.

,0Figment0,2011-08-05T11:22Z,"Ok, when I downloaded this it was just an ISO which I simply mounted. I ran into ONE little snag, so I figured I'd post to explain EXACTLY what I did.
1. Mount the ISO how ever you wish. Personally, I use either MagicISO or PowerISO.
2. Install as normal
3. Once installed (This is where I got bound up with the Missing Disc error) Unzip the ISO file (I use WinRar). There are folders you need in there. Razor1911_repack and Alternate. Unpack these somewhere. Copy the contents of those into the Bioshock 2 Folder replacing the old files.
4. Launch the game.
5. When it asks to create an account, scroll down and create a local profile.

,FloydHunter,2012-04-05T09:18Z,"Ummmmm, Excuse me, maybe I'm new to this(i doubt it but..), how exactly are you supposed to play this game, when it wont 1. save due to the fact that 2. you need a product key and 3. have to be signed into your xlive account? 

I don't know how others can get this to work when he's missing half the description on how exactly to get past this part. 'You are missing the video link and the how to create an xlive account link'

Fail until fixed."
,ram789,2012-04-19T09:03Z,"hey can anyone upload the dlc's for this game??

,Toolman535,2012-05-02T04:27Z,"*For those having problems running the game*
- Download torrent and install using Daemontools
- Extract game files from iso using Winrar/7Zip
- Open game file location and move BOTH MP and SP crack files into game file
- Run game

*For those having problems saving*
- when asked to sign in click make new profile
- in wall of text scroll down to the only link in the text, highlighted in blue
- make offline profile under whatever name
- PLAY BIOSHOCK 2!

Hope this helps!"
,Toolman535,2012-05-02T04:36Z,"And just to clarify some concerns,

Those that received a letter from your ISP its not the game being watched its your ISP watching you.  

If your game crashes during loading or cinematics its not the torrent, its your computer, try updating drivers or investing in a new computer ;)"
