KISS
Soboba Casino, San Jacinto, California
07/27/07

This is the show KISS performed without Paul, who became sick before showtime. Gene came out and asked the audience if they still wanted to go on without Paul. Of course, they did.

It's an audience recording, it's not perfect, but it's listenable.

I'm putting it up as someone requested it, and thanks to jmoore who provided me with the show and thanks to the original taper (where ever you are)
