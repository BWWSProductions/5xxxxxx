,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2010-08-18T00:04Z,"FOR ANY MOVIE RIPPERS OUT THERE, I HAVE JUST FOUND THAT THE VERY BEST RESULTS FOR THE ""IPHONE-4"" COME FROM A PROGRAM CALLED MEDIACODER, USE THESE SETTINGS:

FORMAT - H.264 (Normal)

RESOLUTION - 480x320 (iphone/ipod Touch)

FPS - 25 fps

VIDEO BITRATE - HIGH (768 kbps)

AUDIO BITRATE - HIGH (128 kbps)


I PERSONALLY FOUND THESE SETTINGS FITTED MY IPHONE-4 SCREEN FAR BETER THAN SOME OF OOO`S.... 

BY THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS FREE, DO A GOOGLE SEARCH FOR MEDIACODER & GET THE IPOD/IPHONE CONVERTER"
