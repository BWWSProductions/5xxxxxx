A female music professor, mother, and wife (for the second time) begins to experience severe depression and we come to find out that there had been a past episode that resulted in her divorce from her first husband and her daughter when she was very young. We get to see the current impact of depression with her second husband, its impact on her now 13 year old daughter. There are scenes of medical and psychological intervention, her befriending a music student (with a past) both as a professor and later as companions who support each other. There is ultimately the professors having to make difficult decisions regarding her decision, her treatment, and resolution of her relationship with her husband, daughter, and now her female friend with mixed results.
