,Capt_Minus,2010-08-17T18:27Z,"Guys we getting same error no option than using the Temp fix for making jeppview work with 1016. 
Windows XP:
Double-click the time on taskbar.
Click the Time Zones tab in the Date and Time Properties.
Select a time zone that enables the \'Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes\' option at the bottom.
\""It worked for me\""

Windows Vista/7
Click on the time on the taskbar.
Select \'Change date and time settings...\'
Select \'Change time zone...\'
Select a time zone that enables the \'Automatically adjust clock for Daylight Saving Time\' option.
Select OK, then OK again "
,Enveloppe,2010-08-17T19:27Z,"POSSIBLE FIX FOR JEPPVIEW OR FLITESTAR

--------------------------------------------------------
I think I might have the answer to solve the error problem.

Just follow these steps:

1. Change the date of your computer for the 31-12-2008

2. Install the patch for the Jeppview Cycle 10-16

3. Then download and install the patch from this link: 
http://www.jeppesen.com/documents/  support/aviation/patches/StyleSheetsUpdate.exe

4. After that start Jeppview or Flitestar

5. Finally you can change the date of your computer to the correct date.

--------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy!

Post comments if it works or not!

,vaccaro1966,2010-08-18T09:53Z,"Thank you!

I can't understand what error others talking about.
W7 64 bit here and no problems installing it.
I dunno how you guys install but here how I do it:

* I never use update option within JV.
* mount image to your virtual drive and let it autorun.
* enter the coverage codes and click next.
* do the same for disk 2

That's all. It never failed."

You can get it only after registration.

Thanks,

,glounk,2010-08-18T15:47Z,"the guys haveing problems with the installation like me are those  living in a country without daylight saving time (DST)...so it is quiet anoying to run jeppview with dst because we have to re-get out of this time fonction all the time otherwise you'd go to work or a rendez-vous one hour earlier .....lol.

,jkgxx,2010-08-23T04:27Z,"After updating 1016, I lost TEXT TAB as well. Also FlteStar doesnot work with DST off."
,Enveloppe,2010-08-24T02:57Z,"For Capt_Minus and everyone else who have the TEXT TAB issue.

The reason why the TEXT TAB is missing after installing the Jeppview Cycle 16-10 is because of the StyleSheetUpdate.

You have to uninstall it or maybe you gonna have to reinstall everything.

Sorry for the inconvenience."
,Capt_Minus,2010-08-24T07:22Z,@Envelope thx for your help. but has anyone regained text tab after reinstalling and updating stylesheet. I have installed stylesheet but havent reinstalled jeppview...has anyone tried envelope trick and got text tab back in win xp?
,Enveloppe,2010-08-24T22:03Z,"To Capt_Minus

I had the the same problem as you with the TEXT TAB not loading when starting Jeppview or Flitestar.

I had to re-install everything without of course installing the StyleSheetUpdate, and now it works fine for me.

So I suggest that you try to do a complete uninstall of Jeppview and Flitestar (I used Revo Uninstaller Pro (TORRENT LINK BELOW)) and then re-install them without the StyleSheetUpdate.

Send me feedback please!
