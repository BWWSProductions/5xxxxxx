[T],ctang,2010-08-17T05:08Z,there is no loss in quality on the main feature for this...i reduced the bitrate to 2200kbps on the trailers to make the main feature 100% quality!!!
[T],zombifuzz,2010-08-17T08:17Z,"well i like EXACT copies of dvd-r's.  i like when people dont touch ANYTHING!  or else i dont download/seed.  so when i see a dvd-r that has things taken off/out of it, i delete it immediately.  i dont waste discs on crap.  dont change what you are doing ctang.  keep it the way you are doing it.

hows that?  i felt left out while reading everyone elses wonderful comments!"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-08-17T09:20Z,"oh i almost forgot (cuz im a douche)... thank you ctang for another great movie.  you are quality at its best, hands down."
[T],ctang,2010-08-17T09:23Z,"i didnt take out the trailers because the dvd9 version of this about 4.4gb and needed to be slightly reduced to be a dvd5...i took the bitrate from about 4100kbps down to 2200kbps so i could maintain 100% bitrate on the menus, main feature, and special features...the only loss of quality is in the trailers...i do something that most people would just overlook and have some quality loss in the main feature and yet some people still dont like it...you could go buy it if you dont like what im doing...i have never heard of complaining about 100% quality on a main feature...who actually watches the trailers and is like omg i can see a pixel...thats just being nit-picky...and by the way, you shouldnt see any pixels in  the trailers unless you have a tv bigger than 75 inches because thats what i have and i didnt see any pixels in the trailers...well with that im done for the night...goodnight"

I left a request before but had no sort of response, so here I go again hoping you can help.
The film is called Who is Cletis Tout? starring Christian Slater and Tim Allen. 
Any response either way would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance, I HOPE."

[T],FatFreddy007,2010-08-17T22:08Z,"ctang: a little Spanish here to remember the love for the teacher Spanish :)
Ahora entiendo, en Cop Out yo he visto la estructura del DVD y vi que tiene los comandos ordenados y un menú corregido, yo pensé que tú habías hecho este trabajo, de todas maneras has hecho un gran trabajo y me gusto mucho."

[T],ctang,2010-08-25T02:23Z,i dont have that movie and i probably wont get it...sorry
,sweetg1223,2010-08-26T04:22Z,"Sorry, I may be overlooking this, but is this by chance the extended edition, or the normal theatre version?

And of course, thanks a ton for the upload. It's always appreciated."
[T],ctang,2010-08-26T22:28Z,unfortunately this isnt the extended version its the 88 minute theatrical release
,sweetg1223,2010-08-27T01:46Z,"@ctang, Not a big deal at all. I still am very grateful for this great addition to my library. Keep up the good work."
[T],ctang,2010-08-28T02:02Z,your very welcome...nice to have someone that actually says thanks after a download (not that a few others dont)
