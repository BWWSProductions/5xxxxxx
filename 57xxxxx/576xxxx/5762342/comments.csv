,mommyducky,2010-12-14T19:37Z,I wish there were more people seeding this. I was so excited to find it but there aren't any seeders. I guess not everyone can appreciate the amazing art that is this show! Thank you for sharing it. I will definitely seed it once I have the whole thing. I hope more people will get into it. Everyone should see this.

I have no problem watching other videos and movies so I'm assuming it's a problem with this particular file. I'm so disappointed. I was so excited to find this and now I realize it's a dud. 

IF anyone else has downloaded it and it works for them, let me know what you did. Judging by the lack of comments, I'm assuming nobody else has downloaded. And even though nobody will probably download it (because not many people want it), I will tell you that it does NOT work so do not download it. I'll keep trying to find it somewhere else and hopefully find one that works. If anyone else finds a working one, please tell me! Thanks so much!! Much love!

I cannot thank the uploader enough for this AMAZING rare upload!!! I have always wanted to see the original stage production and never thought I would get the chance. Your hard work and generosity do not go unappreciated! I will be seeding this for as long as possible. :]"
