I made a torrent previously - it was my first torrent and it didn't work (sorry!  Still new to this!)

I've burned in the default subtitles for the English version of this movie.  As you may know, there are like 4 or 5 different languages spoken - so I didn't add the info in the normal text spot.

So this is my second try on my favorite movie :)

Loves to you all!
