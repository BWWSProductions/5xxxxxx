,kiasu1,2010-09-05T11:02Z,"Haven't watched the video but as a university science lecturer, the people who reject creationism or intelligent design out of hand are close minded. There is tremendous evidence for sudden spontaneous explosions of life. Where is the evidence? Not in Darwinism or Religious belief, it is in the only real evidence we have, the fossil record.

Read and interpret it without your dogmatic belief system getting in the way and you will find that the fossils (and geology) tell a story that can be interpreted in two very different ways.

This series does not deal much with the invalidity of creationism; that has been done by others smarter than I. This deals with a particularly dishonest pro-creationism video."
