Engineering an Empire: The Byzantines

Leaving the dusty history books behind, ENGINEERING AN EMPIRE takes to the streets -as well as the sewers, mountaintops, jungles and beyond- to trace the magnificent physical achievements and technologies of past societies. Host Peter Weller travels around the world and, assisted by cutting-edge computer renderings and note-perfect dramatizations, far back in time to chronicle the innovation and architectural brilliance that gave birth to modern civilization.

Experience street-level life in ancient Greece and China; track the expansion of history's most ambitious cultures like Rome and Byzantium; and marvel at the touchstone achievements -the Parthenon, Tenochtitlan, the Great Wall, Chichen Itza, and many more- that defined the past and awe us to this day. Computer enhancements and location filming transport you to the very sites where empires thrived and collapsed.

ENGINEERING AN EMPIRE breathes life into the past, reanimates the achievements of the history's greatest civilizations, and illuminates the ingenuity and boldness of our forebears. This magnificent DVD collection of the entire series will leave you stunned and amazed.
