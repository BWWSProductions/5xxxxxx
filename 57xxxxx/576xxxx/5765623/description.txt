NOT MY RIP, this is:

 Prince of Persia The Sands of Time 2010 R4 NTSC DVDR-playON, 

yes its sad, 99% sure its a DVDshrink job, they kept all the audio and everything and shrank it to a  DVD5. 
They then removed Spanish and Portuguese sub, to make room for custom added Roamanian sub.


I don't know whether to thank them or just.... wait for the BluRay.

but I am re-uploading it here anyway, for those who want it, 
specially the ESp/PT speaking community.

 
BE WARN....video can't be more than 2000 kbps for a big action movie.
