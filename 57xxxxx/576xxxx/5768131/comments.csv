,pooloop,2010-08-19T04:21Z,"i would say that would be a big NO,if you can get yourself on demonoid,you might,and i say might,be able to send albiondean/zoltangera...as he is known there a private message...but you have to be a member,downloads are free just like here,but as you must see the other file in the torrent says downloaded from demonoid,it has to be upped there first.for them to except it,you can check to see if they are taking Registrations,which they are not at the moment,or you need an invite code from a member...any Bad Language or things of the kind will get you and your invite warned or banned.............but there is no way you will get an email address on a torrent site,can you imagine the crap he would get............think.......

i talk to the dean alot on demonoid(great guy btw)but one things for sure he wont like being bombarded with a load of crap....the fella is a legend there as well........as i said think"
