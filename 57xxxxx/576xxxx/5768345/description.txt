Think funky. Think smooth. Think sunshine and warm summer evenings with 
friends. 80s Groove is all of these things and so much more.

Featuring such musical legends as Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, Earth Wind 
& Fire, Aretha Franklin, James Brown and many more, you know this album is 
going to be special before even pressing play!

But when you do decide to get down with the 80s groove vibe CD1 will kick 
off with the world-famous Rufus & Chaka Khan song Ain't Nobody. Its cool, 
calm and collected sound succeeds in soothing the soul and melting away 
life's problems, allowing you to relax and enjoy the great tracks yet to come.

During the next three and a half hours you'll hear such classics as Never 
Too much (Luther Vandross), Thinking of You (Sister Sledge), Ain't No Stopping 
Us Now (McFadden & Whitehead), Got To Have Your Love (Mantronix), I Can't Go 
For That (Hall & Oates), Sexual Healing (Marvin Gaye), Roses (Haywoode), 
and that old favourite, Lovely Day by Bill Withers.
