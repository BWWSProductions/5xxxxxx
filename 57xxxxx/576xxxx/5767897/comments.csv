Do i have enought batteries for the fleshlight and most of all how long do i gotta stand out all this talking? The horror! The action!    
,BakusPT,2010-08-20T07:03Z,@cocobanana_888 go fuck yourself in the anus... propaganda is what you re doing with that fag comment... just watch the movie and shut the fuck up...

,nodatalog,2010-09-17T08:39Z,"oh! what a shitty 'Hollywood like' movie that is. Just to listen to the music during the attacks, I want to puke.  Black hawk down (2001), Stalingrad (1993), these are great war movies. But this piece of craps full or cheap morale and sorry ass feelings ain't. This is a movie for GAY!"
,PhilLesh12,2010-09-26T06:01Z,"You kiddies who grew up with ""Rambo"" as a classic make me laugh.  

If you're older than 25, then you might have some experience watching real war movies.  If not, well, then you'd think that ""Black Hawk Down"" is a classic war movie.

This movie might not be a classic, but it is closer to one than any ""war"" movie made in the last 20 years.  

Sure, it's not a ""Saving Private Ryan"", but that is just a good movie, not a good WAR movie.

This movie was actually very entertaining, and took an aspect of World War One that I only had a cursory knowledge of, and gave it a lot more depth.  They don't go into a lot of detail about the mining operations during World War One in school, if at all.

I'm glad I saw this movie."

,MyFootHurts,2011-06-21T22:21Z,"I'm still yet to find an australian who knows how to take criticism of anything vaguely australian-related without exploding in a fit of indignant, herpa-derp patriotic rage.

Thank god they aren't powerful or important enough to start wars over it."
,losinal,2011-11-25T14:45Z,"Excellent movie, definitely a 9 for me.
Audio and video are a 9 as well."
,engineeringchick,2011-12-21T22:35Z,"MyFootHurts I think ur getting aussies confused with yanks. Unlike them, we can actually take a joke/crticisim at our own expense, provided its ACTUALLY amusing/acurate!"
