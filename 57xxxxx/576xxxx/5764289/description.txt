Edge of a Dream is the twenty-second album by Scottish folk musician Bert Jansch, released in 2002.

The title track is given a rock treatment, and two tracks are baroque instrumentals. The remaining songs are roughly equally divided between bluesy numbers and folky ones. The album features Bernard Butler (of Suede) on electric guitar, and Adam Jansch (Bert's son). "Gypsy Dave" is not the well-known folksong, but an instrumental duo with Dave Swarbrick, dedicated to him. It is probably the best track. Hope Sandoval (of Mazzy Star) sings the lead on "All This Remains", and Loren Jansch takes the lead on "The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood". "Bright Sunny Morning" is a solemn description of the fall of the World Trade Center.
