Manny is the toughest convict in a remote Alaskan prison who, along with fellow inmate Buck, makes a daring breakout. Hopping abroad a freight train, they head full-steam for freedom, but when the engineer dies of a heart attack, they find themselves trapped, alone and speeding toward certain disaster without an engineer and the barrels are out of control. Until, that is, they discover a third passenger, a beautiful railroad worker who's just as desperate and just as determined to survive as they are.
