Shelter is the second album by American roots rock band Lone Justice, released in 1986.

Singer Maria McKee, a small woman with a gigantic voice, belts like a countrified Aretha Franklin and each of her five successive "yeahs" sounds more explosive than the next on the opening song "I Found Love".
Maria McKee's work moved centre stage for this album, but it is well backed by significant contributions from Greg Sutton and Shane Fontayne within the band and by Little Steven as writer and co-producer.
