             Tales for a Winters Night - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

Tales for a Winters Night brings together eight Arthur Conan Doyle mystery classics that originally appeared in the Strand magazine between July 1898 and January 1899. When first gathered into one volume in 1908, the book was entitled Round the Fire Stories, since the author recommended that they be read ideally round the fire upon a winters night.
Unabridged.
