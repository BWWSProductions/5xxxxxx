,michaelrwatson,2012-04-14T05:59Z,"@som919: You are a retard. There is no reason to watch any movie in 720p (with the possible exception of Star Wars 1-6 and Star Trek 1-12). Besides, it sure wouldn't fit in 300MB."
,vreyhr676y,2012-06-03T11:09Z,"ThePirateBay: Magnet to Torrent Script - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/129375

you'll need FIRST to install Scriptish: http://scriptish.org/downloads/ to run the script

You'll be downloading the torrent from torcache.net, but not all magnets have been converted but you'll get the magnet link over there too.

Enjoy."
