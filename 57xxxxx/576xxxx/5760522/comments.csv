@wielkidupek - Mobi is usually a far better format than anything else aside from epub. Just download Calibre to convert mobi to anything."

ok, it's a .mobi but you can find (on line) converters which work perfectly : yup, you get at once a .pdf, perfectly readable !
(like over here : http://www.online-convert.com)"
