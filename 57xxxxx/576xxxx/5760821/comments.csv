It sounds rather muffled in comparison. The 2008 Re-master from the  1970-1975 boxset (Virgin SACD) is much clearer and sounds like a veil is lifted. You can hear the music much better and there is a much better soundstage. 

So get that one and forget about this one."

,bartoko,2011-09-08T23:41Z,So is it the Definitive Edition 1994 remaster or the original release? I'm hoping it's the unremastered version but I can't tell without comparing  
,bartoko,2011-09-08T23:42Z,"I mean, in the artwork folder the back cover shows Definitive Edition written, but maybe it's just a back cover the uploader got from a random Internet search. I hope this can be clarified"
