Try to upgrade your Acrobat Reader - you need Acrobat 7 or higher.

Und Danke, papiertiger"

On my computer Adobe Reader displays the file correctly. Maybe you should update your Reader?

I recommend Evince for viewing pdf files. Or just ask Wikipedia for a ""List of PDF software""."

Is not so heavy as Acrobat Reader"
