This episode featured the first Virginian 
appearances of John McIntire and his wife 
Jeanette Nolan as Clay & Holly Grainger. 
It's a well-acted story, about Shiloh cattle 
and other beef becoming infected and quarantined, 
but this was an unofficial introduction to new characters.

Charles Bickford, who played John Grainger from the start 
of the 5th Season over a year earlier, was very sick when 
this episode was filmed.

He died not long after in November 1967, so John McIntire 
entered as his brother Clay for the next 3 years. 
McIntire had also replaced Ward Bond on Wagon Train 
when Bond died in 1960.

Guest Stars John Anderson, Dabbs Greer, Virginia Gregg, 
and semi-regulars John Bryant as Dr. Spaulding and 
Russell Thorson as the judge.
