Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine at allmusic.com:

"It's hard to deny the influence of Trent Reznor on How to Destroy Angels, the group featuring the Nine Inch Nails mastermind, his wife Mariqueen Maandig, and his longtime collaborator Atticus Ross, but HTDA isn't quite NIN fronted by a female. Maandig's presence isn't incidental; having her as the focal point shifts the tone considerably, giving the music a dreamy quality even when things get quite gnarled and ugly, as they do on "Parasite." Draped in twisted, processed guitar gunk, "Parasite" is recognizably Reznor's, as is the electro-throb of "Fur Lined," and the ominous undertow of "BBB," but HTDA's debut EP doesn't consist of dressed-up leftovers from "The Slip": some of Reznor's obsessions remain recognizable, but having collaborators opens up the music and Maandig softens it, giving this EP a different feel despite some familiar sounds."
