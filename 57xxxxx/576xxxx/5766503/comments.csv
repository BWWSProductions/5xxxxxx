Throughout his career, Trent Reznor has generously shared his music with listeners for free. He does not need the money; he is happy to be able to share his music with as large an audience as possible. He would not mind at all that this torrent running
Go and take a look at his ""seed0"" account here on TPB to see for yourself. 

Enjoy the music, everyone, and please seed. For every 1.0 ratio you seed back, you earn a Good Karma Cookie!"

So why did he recently sell a bunch of old equipment on ebay?"
[T],kimeesteres,2010-09-22T21:59Z,"On nin.com, Trent said, ""Weâ€™ve been going through the NIN touring and studio rigs and are getting rid of a large selection of gear and equipment the band is no longer in need of.""

There is no official word yet about where the money from the auction sale is going, but it may go to charity, or it may just get funneled back into buying brand new equipment when he decides to tour again.

Trust me, Trent is not living in the poorhouse due to torrents. Go and check out his 'seed0' account here on TPB."
,sucksucker,2010-11-06T02:07Z,"The only thing that the seed0 torrents, and Trent making The Slip and Ghosts free proves is that if he wanted to give THIS away for free, then he would do it himself."
[T],kimeesteres,2010-11-07T22:24Z,"To sucksucker: If you have a moral problem with people sharing audio and video files for free, then what are you doing with an account on ThePirateBay? Just wondering..."
,sucksucker,2010-12-02T19:17Z,"Because I also have no problem with illegally downloading.
I am a copyright infringer, and proud of it.

The different between you and me is that I call a spade a spade and can accept that something can be WRONG while I am doing it.
This release was NOT free, was NOT intended to be free, and is NOT morally justifiable, despite whatever you may say about it.

I don't care that you've shared it, but that you think there is nothing wrong with sharing it.


BTW.  You're as bad as the swedish prosectors if you think everyone uses thepiratebay for illegal purposes.
There are plenty of free, legal and moral torrents on thepiratebay."
,sucksucker,2010-12-02T19:43Z,"I just saw your comment on my suck torrent, which confirms that you've totally missed the point.

I am not elcapizzo, and I'm not saying ""everyone should buy this so Trent gets paid""

This torrent is awesome, thanks for sharing it, I love illegally downloading things that people illegally share.  
But do not, for one instant, believe that it is not wrong to share something illegally.

I know sharing and downloading things is WRONG, but I don't care."

Please ignore the 5 negative votes on this torrent. They are all from the same user -- sucksucker. He is a troll who can't be bothered to seed his one torrent, which has managed to accumulate 122 negative votes.
I've been seeding this torrent for almost a year, and he is the only person who has ever complained. 
There's always one loony in every crowd! :)"
