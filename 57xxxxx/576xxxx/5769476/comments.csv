,refuse2useausername,2010-10-21T04:33Z,"episodes entitled ""sacrifice"", ""the captains hand"", ""downloaded"" and ""lay down your burdens"" part 1 and part 2."
,K-sad,2010-10-31T19:19Z,"@refuretouseausername, 

I have those episodes, it's from 16 to 20. Maybe you didn't select them when you were downloading it. 
Thanks Houruoha, this is a good torrent. 

V-8
A-10
This is not HD but it's clear and good enough, i enjoyed it. Thanks again. I've already uploaded 7GBs, i will continue seeding till 500Gbs hopefully. "

,amnesiac_radar,2011-07-22T17:26Z,"Brilliant, thanks for a good torrent and nice quality. Mkv converts well to Vob."
,piratiinho,2011-10-08T16:29Z,"As good as the first season, thanks!"
,b1tshifter,2012-01-26T19:20Z,"hey guys, first off a huge thanks for this - caught on mighty late to the awesomeness of battlestar but am absolutely loving it. 

Can anyone help though - episodes 4,6 and 18 aren't working for me, they're recognised as MKV files but no thumbnail is displayed and I get a 'problem encountered' message when I try to play them. I have already tried deleting the offending files - rechecking the torrent and redownloading them but they're exactly the same as before. 

I really hope someone can help or maybe provide some decent links to torrents for the episodes that aren't working (I'm stuggling to find any with a decent amount of seeders). 

Thanks in advance for any help - may the lords of kobol bless anyone who can offer assistance :P"
,b1tshifter,2012-01-28T16:12Z,Okay actually I fixed it! For anyone who encounters the same problem that I did - just convert the non-working files to a different file type and then they play okay. 
,JRaiden,2012-04-05T10:47Z,"Gigantic thanks houruoha. Pretty great quality *considering* file size (120 MB?!), as good as most scene SD (non-HD) releases."
