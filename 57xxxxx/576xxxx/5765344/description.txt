Release Notes:

If you thought you knew the Hoosiers, think again. Three years after
they first stormed the charts with their feelgood brand of fizzy pop,
with singles such as Worried About Ray and Goodbye Mr A; and
shifting over half a million copies of their debut album The Trick To
life, the pop trio return with a brand new sound which slots them
straight into 2010 whilst firmly establishing their pop base.

The Hoosiers are a band whose primary aim is to push the boundaries of
pop, and the new album The Illusion of Safety does just that. Out are
the skippy beats, perky melodies, lashings of falsetto and nods to 70s
soft rock that defined their previous sound, and in come synths,
dancefloor-friendly beats, a dash of Giorgio Moroder and triumphant,
multi-tracked choruses that recall the pomp of the Pet Shop Boys Go
West. 


SEED AND ENJOY!!!
