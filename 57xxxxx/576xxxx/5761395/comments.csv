,HalcyonJedi,2010-08-14T04:34Z,"Game installs great, but gives me an error on launch that states ""Steam Application is not running"" then exits... anyone have a fix?"
,xEarthshaker,2010-08-14T05:32Z,"Thanks a lot for this, was looking forward to it, since the release date.

@HalcyonJedi : just install steam?

Anyway, games runs just fine !"
,shahita,2010-08-14T12:43Z,how to play on LAN?
,joebobmcslob,2010-08-14T16:43Z,"installs, but when i click the launcher, it says ""steam client is not running"" abd exits even though i have steam installed..... help please"
,TiGORiN,2010-08-14T19:14Z,@joebobmcslob: You have to UNINSTALL Steam not install it. Uninstall it completely from your computer and the game will work.
,fireflicker01,2010-08-14T20:08Z,"hey man.. i had mounted and installed the game.. then copied the files from the TiNYiSO folder. after that, whenever i launch the game, it says ""PQ2 has encountered a problem and needs to be closed."" what should i do? please help me"
,Redundantos,2010-08-14T22:07Z,Works like a charm. Thanks!
,HalcyonJedi,2010-08-15T07:21Z,"I don't have Steam installed, and never have... it tells me Steam *HAS* to be installed to run the game... can someone explain what needs to be done?"
,IndigoAK,2010-08-15T23:08Z,"You do not need to uninstall Steam for this game to work.

I have Steam installed under Windows 7 64-bit and the game runs fine, even when Steam is running.  The overlay pops up and everything, though Steam will not report that I'm playing the game."
,xdfgh,2010-08-15T23:12Z,Where is the crack.exe file you fucking noob uploader? All I get are NFO files.
,xdfgh,2010-08-16T00:17Z,Size dose matter Mr.NoDick
,crusader8466,2010-08-16T03:08Z,"Works great and I had no problems. Simply mount the .bin file, install and copy over the cracked .exe and the steam.dll thing and it worked.

No idea what these fools are talking about, about uninstalling steam to play this. I have steam going and have even added the game to my steam games tab. The only problem is that for some reason the steam overlay doesn't work on this game, but that's no big deal."
,Everoth,2010-08-16T07:14Z,"It downloads really fast but so far i have not been able to try it, i keep getting this error  Steam Client is not Running."" "", i know i draged the exe from the tinyiso folder to the namco folder, no problem with that, but i kept getting an error when i tried to move the Steamclient.dll one, it sais "" Invalid MS-DOS Function ""i can try again and again but it will never move over there, that might be the root of the steam client problem, i will apreciate any reply or way to fix this, keep up the good work."
,FinomTuroRudi,2010-08-16T17:25Z,PandaCloudAntiVirus found powerquest2.exe suspicious and renamed the file.
,FinomTuroRudi,2010-08-16T17:27Z,"Fix: Puzzlequest2.exe, of course."
,Ezel,2010-08-17T02:29Z,Works fine for me. I had steam installed and running and there was no problem playing the game. Haven't tried it without steam running though.
,adumb_h,2010-08-18T08:04Z,"The game doesn't load for me. 

I get a ""PuzzleQuest2.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close"" error. Game installs fine, and I copied the contents of the TinyISO folder. Also have Steam installed...



I'd appreciate any help!"
,mr1black,2010-08-18T12:07Z,"Works perfectly on win 7 32 bit! Read .nfo file if you're stuck. You don't need Steam... erm... app... account... client... Anyways, you don't need steam... :)"
,KaliK0t,2010-08-18T12:47Z,does the crack support multiplayer?
,Everoth,2010-08-18T22:13Z,"Ok for those that have the problem of the steam client nor running, here its the problem, the steam client that its on the tinyiso folder is not working on your system. so download this one, add it to the folder like you did with the .exe and it should work.

Hope it solves the issue."
,HalcyonJedi,2010-08-20T00:22Z,"Ok - so I reinstalled the game, and copied the puzzlequest2.exe and steamclient.dll files to the game directory. Immediately after launching the game the screen goes black like it's going to load, then I get ""PuzzleQuest2.exe has stopped working"". I'm running Win7 Enterprise 32bit and even put the application in XP SP2 compatibility mode and same results - anyone else had this same issue?"
,adumb_h,2010-08-20T07:00Z,"I get the Puzzle Quest startup pop-up where you select a language, then the ""encountered a problem and needs to close"" message after I hit okay.

Windows XP 32bit, tried new vid drivers and rolled back to old ones...I dunno man. I wanna play this game. So sad."
,_-Syt-_,2010-08-26T18:41Z,"I apologize if this is a stupid question.   But where is the steamclient.dll and PuzzleQuest2.exe files that everyone is saying to copy?    

I have installed many games from this site,  and have never had a problem locating the cracks,  but I simply cannot find it.  

I have the Puzzle.Quest.2-TiNYiSO folder,  and it has a TiNYiSO NFO file,  and many .rar files,  and after extracting them,  I have a .bin and a .cue.   But I have no cracks."
,Wazzaa123,2010-08-27T01:57Z,"Mya, there are no crack files in the torrent anymore. The file is simply not there after you've unrared the rars.

And because there is no other release for this game on tpb, we will have to wait untill they upload a proper fix for this."
,purnadi,2010-08-28T12:54Z,"hey bro.,., how to mount this games it's make me confuse.,., is this virus or what???"
,Kooblukhan,2010-08-31T19:34Z,"First, if you are looking for the crack, i assure you it is there.  When you mount, click open folder to view files and open the Tinyiso folder to find it.

Second, whenever i try to run the game after copying over the crack, i get the error Application has failed to start because D3dx9-etc.dll was not found.  I guess thats a game file but I have no idea why it isnt there.  Same problem after re-installing.  Any ideas?"
,Kooblukhan,2010-08-31T19:36Z,"And to clarify Syt and Wazza, you have to mount the .bin file, with Magiciso or something."
,RickyTheFish,2010-09-01T11:07Z,"The steamclient.dll will not copy to the hard drive from the TiNYiSO folder; every time I try, I get the error ""invalid MS-DOS function."" I've tried through the command prompt as well as through Explorer, and neither way works.

Is there a workaround? Without that file, this game is unplayable."
,RickyTheFish,2010-09-01T11:13Z,"My mistake... if anyone is running into the error I posted about above, this apparently happens if you mount the BIN file instead of the CUE file. When I mounted the CUE file, the steamclient.dll file copied just fine. The game works perfectly."

,lordzippy,2011-01-26T15:14Z,"bit different to other games have installed, as in the crack is in the image mounted drive. once i had found that works 100% fine. mount the cue file then copy crack from your virtual drive and happy days. game itself seems a bit of a stepdown from pq warlords but will still play for many hours. thanks thenoobish"
