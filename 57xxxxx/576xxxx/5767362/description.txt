Description: If humans were as varied as dogs we would range in height up to 22 feet tall 
and in weight more than 1,000 pounds. In the ultimate canine ancestral story, NGC traces 
the genetic journey from wolf to dog, taking viewers back 100,000 years to meet the 
"mother of all dogs." It's no accident that dogs evolved this way, as humans have been 
selectively breeding them for around 14,000 years to serve our needs as laborer, 
companion, hunter, herder and warrior, as well as to suit our aesthetic fancy.
