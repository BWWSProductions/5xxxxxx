As for the movie. This is you basic hack and slash guy movie. There is nothing at all interesting or intelligent about the script. 

The set designers couldn't even go so far as a couple google searches or a phone call to understand roman camp strategy and configurations.

Though discipline had slipped in the legions by the time of Hadrian, roman soldiers dig. It's what they did. Everyday, before bed they could build a 16foot spiked ditch and wall with a wooden rampart atop. Every morning before they marched they would tare it all down again so as not to leave satisfactions behind for the enemy to exploit.  

This movie is just a list of historical errors but that's my two cents.

drink a couple beer and leave your brain at the door."

click on the link near the bottom of this webpage that says forum and then read through the tutorials at suprbay. If you still need help ask the people there, but they are more then likely just going to tell you to look at the tutorials because there are so many. "
