Explores sisters, in their twenties, their parents, and family dysfunctions. Kay is 
gangly and slightly askew, consulting a fortune teller and then falling in love with 
a man because of a mole on his face and a lock of hair; then, falling out of love 
when he plants a tree in their yard. Sweetie is plump, imperious, self-centered, and 
seriously mentally ill. The parents see none of the illness, seeing only their cute 
child. Kay mainly feels exasperation at her sister's impositions. Slowly, the film 
exposes how the roots of Sweetie's illness have choked Kay's own development. Can 
she be released?
