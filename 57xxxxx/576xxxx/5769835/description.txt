Show Nfo: Ted Crisp claims his executive job, head of R&D in huge US industrial conglomerate V , is the best in the world. In fact even his six-year old child sees straight trough his predicament: the orders Ted gets from airhead VP Veronica Palmer, or through her from the board, are absurd and/or evil.

Review - What a fantastic show. It is a hilarious satirical commentary on the offices of scientific research and technology companies. It is amazing how to close to reality some of their material cuts for those of us that work in R&D departments. It is also a very 'fun' show, the writers must really enjoy having a decent budget to make spoof advertising for their pretend corporation. Sometimes it is good to stand back from life and take stock of the really important things, and this satire certainly jabs away at the ludicrous of the modern office environment, where being creative requires a constant battle with the middle-management Ogres.
