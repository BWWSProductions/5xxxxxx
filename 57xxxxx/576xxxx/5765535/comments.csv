Interestingly, many people left during the play. Like, more than would be expected. I think they may have been offended by all the swearing.

As someone with mental illness I thought this was a very good adaptation - somewhat similar to Book of Mormon -- it both mocks and enlightens and respects regarding the mental health community at large.

Anyway, thanks for posting!"
