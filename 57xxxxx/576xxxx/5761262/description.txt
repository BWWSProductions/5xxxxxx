Chambers was a BBC radio (and television) sitcom. It was written by barrister Clive Coleman. 
The radio version was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in three series between 1996 and 1999.

John Fuller-Carp, a barrister in charge of Forecourt Chambers. His coleagues are Hilary Tipping, a rather ineffectual young man, and Ruth Quirke, initially a rather militantly left wing feminist. After Lesley Sharp left the role after the first series and Sarah Lancashire took over, Ruth became more of comic neurotic.
