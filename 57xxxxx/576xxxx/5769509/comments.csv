,psiphity,2010-08-17T15:48Z,"Alright guys I got this patched version to work finally. I'm running it on a DSonei  (running the evolution ware) cart I had to turn the memory down to second from highest option and shut off real time save. once in a while the text will malign (words wrap slightly wrong) like a word continues where it's not supposed to but I can get past the apple and into painting and it shows no sign of freezing, though I can not get it to work on my (real) R4i with 2.7b or 2.3b That's ok by me though. this is good for now, thanks guy. I've noticed all games with auto save as part of their programming require me to shut it off on the carts options to work."
,psiphity,2010-08-17T15:50Z,I forgot to mention I shut the cheats option off as well.

yeah your right , its a japanese fix and all the jap files have been changed with english dump files so you may get some jap language later in the game buy it should suffice till flashcards get firmware updates released"
,MenOrNicer,2010-08-17T20:02Z,Where can you find this game that works on V1.32? Thx 
[T],simmyboy80,2010-08-18T00:18Z,"@menornicer

you cant the previous Rom i posted is a clean patched rom and this is a homemade patch done with dslazy in which a cracked jap rom was used and all jap files were deleted and replaced with english files , just have to wait for firmware upgrade from your specific flashcart provider and hope they include this game in the fix list"
,psiphity,2010-08-18T11:05Z,"After my last post I went back and updated my Supercard DSonei with the very newest Evolution software for it (out in july) and it now runs the first rom of Art Academy (perfectly) you posted as well as the Tetris Party Delux which I had also had a problem with. Also with the lowered memory and cheat off. Thanks a great deal Simmyboy80. got Evolution for supercard dsoni from filetrip. SO far everything i have wanted either runs from the Supercard DSonei or my original R4i sdhc (real not clone), I just often have to update software for newest games. write me and I'll send a list of those games running from them."
,antisocialdino,2010-08-21T16:09Z,"Didn't work for me, get's to the stalk on the apple in the first lesson and then freezes everytime"
,antisocialdino,2010-08-21T16:10Z,"No joy, freezes on the tutorial still, same as your other torrents on here and kickass"
[T],simmyboy80,2010-08-21T23:37Z,"@antisocialdino

look at psiphity's comments above yours and its quite evident that freezing issue has been resolved with this patch , sorry its not working for you"
,vivien12,2010-08-23T08:48Z,It doesn't work on R4i. The only thing I see is a big white screen when I start the game
,xmassacre,2010-08-24T00:42Z,"Thanks simmyboy80 works flawlessly on r4 wood v1.12 much appreciated, keep up the good work!"
,Tabbystar,2010-08-27T00:29Z,"I can confirm that this torrent is good but it only works on updated R4i. I have one original R4, an R4i V1.4 and a later R4i 1.4 with 1.24 kernal update (July 2010 release) and it will only work on the later. Blank screens all round on the other two. I have done three lessons now and no crashes  (my apple sucked). Only slight hiccup is the text is a bit broken up, but still understandable. "
,Tabbystar,2010-08-27T11:33Z,"Update: unfortunately, my husband did a couple of excellent pictures and then all save data became corrupted. Tried all three slots but same problem and all gallery photos have been lost. Lessons can still be done as the new levels remain open, but work cannot be saved. I would gladly buy this, but it seems shops are out of stock! It DOES work but be prepared to lose your masterpieces. My crapple (crap apple) is gone too!"
,Izzet87,2010-08-30T17:09Z,No joy on DSTT with custom 1.17a

DS Lite, Acekard 2.1 w/4.23 FW"
,omgrobotz,2010-09-28T02:53Z,"@ supergoodnacho

This works perfectly on my Nintendo DS Lite with Acekard 2i and AKAIO 1.7.1. Try using AKAIO firmware instead. Guarantee it will work then. :)

Thanks uploader!"
,hugo0007,2010-10-09T00:46Z,"hurray this one finally worked on my DSi version 1.4 with R4i gold with latest card firmware here the links http://www.r4ids.cn/index.htm

,MrAwesomeSince85,2010-10-09T03:48Z,"Works on my DStwo, but the tutorials are all misplaced in the text explanation. I can barely fully understand it. Is that normal?"
,MrAwesomeSince85,2010-10-09T03:50Z,Thank you
,Death-Dude-72,2010-10-27T14:47Z,"This looks cool but.. I always wondered how you can download games for cartridge systems. How can you download a DS game on the computer and get it to the ds? Anyone wanna explain? Cuz the only things I've downloaded from here are books, applications, and PC games. Thanks a lot if you can help! "
,kreem,2010-11-21T10:23Z,"@Death-Dude-72
Seeing as nobody else is willing. In order to play downloaded NDS roms you need a cartridge (of which there are many - some good,some bad) and also a sdhc memory card (usually supplied with the cartridge when you buy it) then you download the software needed to get the cartridge to work (they can't supply the cartridge 'ready to go' as it's illegal) then it's just a case of waiting for kind people to rip the roms from the cartridges and put them on here - then you just download the rom and copy it to the sdhc memory card - then get pissed off when it doesn't work (but works for John Doe with his different cartridge) The internet is a vast source of information Death Dude - you could have found the answer in 2 clicks yourself if you even bothered to look."
