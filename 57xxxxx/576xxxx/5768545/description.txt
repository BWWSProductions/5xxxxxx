Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 60 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can\'t continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



If you are NOT interested in LGBT topics like this film portrays, then just do NOT download it or waste anyone's time by making stupid comments - just move on to another torrent. Personally, I'm not interested in drag, but I AM interested in the cultural significance of this film. If you have an open and intellectually curious mind, then download this and enjoy. Also, this DVD was obviously made from a VHS recording, so please do NOT expect DVD quality in sound or video.

Butterflies on the Scaffold  documents the real-life creation of a drag nightclub. Staffed by transvestite singers and dancers, the cafÃ© has become a bastion of social acceptance within a macho realm. La Guinera in Havana plays host to the determined performers who prove a little courage can go a long way. Backstage glimpses are interspersed with interviews of the working-class players. Butterflies on the Scaffold teaches that people everywhere share a common need for acceptance.
