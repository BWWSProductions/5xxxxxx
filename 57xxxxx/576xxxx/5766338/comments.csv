,borgsten,2010-08-16T12:21Z,This is the REAL DEAL! Best 320 rip so far & HQ covers. Thx!
,slywrp,2010-08-21T22:09Z,This sounds superior to that other 320kbps release.
,triggerfinger,2010-09-03T15:11Z,"Since there is two 320 kbps releases in the website, i downloaded Helldorado and Final Frontier songs from both, i can say that other release is better, since it has better bass sounds. in this release you hardly hear drums etc."
,halcyonwild,2012-03-08T21:37Z,"Or is this one better.  Sounds better than other torrents somehow.  better at some sections than the one I commented earlier. 
Might just delete this and buy it because album is worth buying. "
