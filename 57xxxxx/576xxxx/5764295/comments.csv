Ok, most of you downloaders probably already figured out that the torrent title of this torrent is not correct...
When you download this torrent and open it in your torrent program (eg Utorrent, Vuze etc.) it will download Part 2 of the concerts, so all the files in the description of this torrent (the concerts from 2000). The description of this torrent is accurate!


This is the second part of the Elliott Smith concert torrents and part 1 can be found here:

Part 3 can be found here:

Enjoy and please remember to keep seeding!!!!
I simply cannot keep all torrents alive myself and once they're finished uploading I stop uploading so it's really up to you all to keep them alive and available for others!!!
Part 4 is in the making, so keep checking for updates!!!

Ciao!"
