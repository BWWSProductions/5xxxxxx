Like any 'definitive' collection this one most decidedly isn't, in fact it's something of a ragbag - BUT it is most certainly excellent and while not the last word on Martin's career to date is a pretty good inroduction to what he does. There is a fine range of material here, all of it - bar the stomping 'Lakes of Ponchartrain' showcasing his quite remarkable ability as a guitarist (and occasionally banjo player). His voice is a more variable instrument veering between the rich and effective to the annoyingly whiney but even when the latter is the case his magnificent guitar playing more than compensates. It's the instrumentals, however, that really stand out, 'First Cut Is the Deepest' and 'Plains of Waterloo/James Connolly' in particular, though the songs 'Shawnee Town' and 'One More Day/Boots of Spanish Leather' are fine performances. Just occasionally his arrangements slip into the over-fussy ( the introduction to 'Clerk Sanders' for example ) but we can forgive him a few small lapses for such overall excellence. Highly recommended and only misses the five stars since I ( and probably most other fans ) would quibble about some of the items included here on a so-called definitive collection
