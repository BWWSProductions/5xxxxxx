,dukeofurl,2010-08-25T23:30Z,"This is great, but would be a whole lot better if it didn't have subtitles, especially for a language that it is in to start with.  Do you have this without subtitles?"
[V],meech,2010-08-26T13:23Z,"dukeofurl:
The subtitles are ""soft"" subtitles.  Meaning, they are optional.  They are NOT burned into the video.  You should be able to disable them in the media player that you are using.

In Media Player Classic, you go to the Play menu in the menu bar, then Subtitles, then uncheck ""Enable"".

In VLC Media Player, you go to Video -> Subtitles Track -> then click ""Disable""

I'm not sure, but I think in Windows Media Player, you go to: Play -> Lyrics, Captions and Subtitles -> and click ""Off""

If you are streaming them to your t.v. via PS3 Media Server, you go to the subtitles options and make sure ""Definitely Disable Subtitles"" is checked.

Those are the only programs I use.  If you are using a different program, just go to the Help portion and search for keyword: subtitles.  I imagine you should be able to disable subtitles in any media program that's out there."

So I include the subtitles for his sake (and others who may be in the same boat as him).  That way he can keep up with the show better.  "
,euzorab,2010-09-02T19:40Z,"keep including the subtitles. I like them for same reason as your brother in law.
Thanks"
,TheOriginalCoda,2011-04-11T22:58Z,"Yeah subtitles please... When I hear something like ""We are currently on route to the q'ptah system to meet jgu'tph g'noftlek"" I like to know that my ears are not deceiving me ;-)"

,2old2bs,2011-12-25T02:08Z,Thank you meech for all 3 start trek series. Fantastic job and i will be seeding till the end of time. Any chance of doing Battle start Galactica?
,Laolaohot,2012-06-27T12:53Z,"I am amazed how badly people are seeding these days.
Most of the time downloading this, i am about an average of 20 kb/s.

Does this have anything to do with people limiting their connections? Either way, it's annoying as hell"
