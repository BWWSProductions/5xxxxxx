Take control of the whole of ancient Rome as you build and defend your own towns and cities and finally take on responsibility for the capital itself. Just beware of the marauding lions and barbarian hordes.

Despite what the name implies this has relatively little to do with Civilization, beyond a similar interface and a number of wonders of the world to build. Thatâ€™s not necessarily a criticism though as your start practising your city planning skills, creating homes and work for your citizens and guard towers to make sure theyâ€™re protected. Interestingly the primary focus of the game is on increasing the quality of your housing and therefore the social status of your citizens â€“ which in turn brings in more taxes. There are some annoying bugs, and the concept is hardly a new one, but if you prefer your video games a little slower paced then this offers plenty of entertainment.

There are a number of missions where you have to build your city against the clock, either to combat natural disasters such as brush fires or to make sure youâ€™re ready when an enemy army comes knocking at the town gates.

The developers of CivCity: Rome are British studio Firefly who were responsible for the Stronghold series of castle building simulators. The CivCity name is expected to become a whole new series of games.
