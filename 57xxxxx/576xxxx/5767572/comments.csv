,Shadydie,2011-10-25T11:23Z,"djDEVASTATE2009  The file "" d3dx9_27.dll"" was not found, I extracted the file with Winzip and my windows is XP SP2, Hash checked is ok, What is the solution?"
,malachai32,2011-10-26T23:04Z,Works OK on Windows 7 x64.
,malachai32,2011-10-26T23:23Z,"I had the same problem (The file "" d3dx9_27.dll"" was not found) when I first started playing it. Was about to try and install it from a DX9 Feb 2006 update (I'm on DX11) when I decided to try the game executable in the folder rather than using the one in ""CivCity Rome.7z"" in the archive. The game now runs OK on my system: Windows 7 x64."
,wepopew,2011-10-27T22:58Z,"Thannks man!
