           Things are not going well in the depression-era town of        
           Castle Gate. Mr. Ribaldi, a mysterious rich man with a         
           disfigured face and an abrasive personality, has just          
           bought and moved into a long-vacant mansion. Bonnie, an        
           adolescent girl who loves to sing, ends up working for         
           Ribaldi so that her family can stay in their house. But        
           Ribaldi is quite an accomplished musician himself, and he      
           is soon giving Bonnie voice lessons. Meanwhile, local          
           businesses are being shut down by foreclosures, and the        
           townspeople suspect Ribaldi is responsible.
