,Nabarun,2010-08-14T23:12Z,"h3ll4b0y, u shut up. I like apb's stuff, but he is the only one who seems to screw up every time. At least, he is the only ""NOTICEABLE"" one. He must be doing something wrong. And mind your language. And learn some spellings and punctuations while you struggle through your prepubescent horrible dad-fucked miserable life."

If when one of you searched, try something else. I put an Asterisk (*) with no space beside the movie's name and I got here instantly. BE creative and quit whining. . . . ESP. over movies and media you are getting for free due to the hard work, time, and kindness of others. Everyone needs to take a deep breath and remember and understand that the use of this site is a privilege, not an entitlement. NO ONE is guaranteed use of this site and its features.  These movies, songs, apps, etc, etc, don't end up here from the tooth fairy."
