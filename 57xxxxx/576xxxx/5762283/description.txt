Meredith Godreau is the lone voice of Gregory and the Hawk. It's her sweet, angelic, unsure delivery that we hear leading every song. Unlike her other albums, you won't make the mistake of calling this simply as acoustic pop or folk. There are instrumental passages here and there, accompanying Meredith's haunting melodies which bring her sound closer to the idiosyncratic, noisy, dreamy, experimental indie pop hallmarks. But the spine of these songs are unmistakably the girl with a pretty voice, in her bedroom, writing these exquisite songs, so delicate they feel like they'd collapse under her own whisper.
