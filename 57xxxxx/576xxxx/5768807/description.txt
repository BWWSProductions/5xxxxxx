I scanned this book as I thought it may be of historical interested.

This series, Around the World Program from the American Geographical Society was published about 1965 in UK by Odhams Book. It is not listed as being available on the AGS website.

The series was two tone printed with a centre insert of coloured stickers.

Aimed at the youth market it was neither scholarly or, viewed from these more enlightened days, politically correct.

I scanned the pages and recompiled as a pdf with only the double pages reduced to fit.

If there is interest, I will scan others in the series although not until 2011.
