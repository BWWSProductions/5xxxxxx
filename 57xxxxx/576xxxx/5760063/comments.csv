,Amol_Gh,2010-10-21T05:00Z,I have been attached to this web-site for the last 2.5 years and this is the worst seeded file I have ever come across for a 4GB+ file. I'm an Indian and I appeal all those Indian seeders for this file to seed as much as possible for this one. This is not only an Indian heritage but an international one. I myself will seed **atleast** five-times the original size after completing. But SEEDERS: PLEASE SEED. THIS IS SIMPLY PRECIOUS INDIAN HERITAGE.

,tester4u,2011-07-13T05:30Z,"This serial is a good BUT there is big FLAW in its historic story

Alexander did not defeat Purushothan(Porus)
Greeks were good in the plain battle fields but they were not in gorilla wars and they never fought against elephants and wild tibitan dogs whcih were tamed and trained buy Indian armies in those days, his favorite horse was killed in the battle by the Pourus elephant and  he was seriously injured by the Indian king Porus,
In those conditions he and his generals lost stomach for any more war with porus and came to truce with purushotham.

the so called Great army of alexander could not even defeat a small kingdom of porus which had only 85 elephants, alexander and his generals came to know through their ally king amby,  that magaha kingdom has 5000 elephant infantry and realized the bitter truth and retreived through a safe passage given by the brave king Purushothan (Porus) for which alexander gave some small kingdoms to porus.

Just imagine an army of horses standing up against an army of elephants and wild tibetan mustiffs,
you will get the picture :)"
