The movie is based on the 1961 Hungarian film drama KÃ©t fÃ©lido a pokolban (Two half-times in Hell), which was directed by ZoltÃ¡n FÃ¡bri and won the critics award at the 1962 Boston Cinema Festival.

The film was inspired by the true story of Dynamo Kyivs players, who defeated German soldiers while Ukraine was occupied by German troops in World War II. According to myth, as a result of their victory, the Ukrainians were all shot. The true story is considerably more complex, as the team played a series of matches against German teams, emerging victorious in all of them, before finally being sent to prison camps by the Gestapo. Most of the team were killed there, but a few survived.

Escape to Victory featured a great many professional footballers as both the POW team and the German team. Many of the footballers came from the Ipswich Town squad, who were at the time one of the most successful teams in Europe. Despite not appearing on screen, English World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks was closely involved in the film, working with Sylvester Stallone on his goalkeeping scenes. Sports Illustrated magazine said the game is marvelously photographed by Gerry Fisher, under second unit director Robert Riger.

Les Shannon, the ex-Burnley player, choreographed the actual game presented in the film. The movie also credits PelÃ© as the designer of plays. Gordon Banks, World Cup winning goalkeeper, coached Sylvester Stallone. The game was filmed in the Hidegkuti NÃ¡ndor Stadium in Budapest, Hungary. In the film, PelÃ© plays a character from Trinidad and Tobago rather than, obviously, his real-life native land of Brazil (which was involved in the war only in 1945).
