Another good movie. It is getting boring, you guys are putting out good quality every time. 
I did find one of the 3 movies of yours that I just downloaded needed DIVX to run it on the computer, but that is not a problem, I am mearely mentioning it for other downloaders. Audio 10/10, Visuals 9/10, Sync 10/10
Thanks also to Seeds & Peers, the download was fast. 
I am disappointed that there is not another comment here to give others an opinion."
