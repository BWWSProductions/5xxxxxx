The 1945 Paramount cult classic from the same director who did THE UNINVITED with Miss Russell a year earlier.   THE UNSEEN has been withheld from DVD by MCA,  who has owned the rights since 1958.   This copy,  taken from a DVD of a 1970\'s U-matic copy of a 1958 TV release print,  has been re-mastered to restore as much as possible of the original contrast ratio and the Oscar-nominated sound.   To be fair,  it is now only watchable.  The versions being sold on eBay are not.

Complete and ready to burn to single-layer DVD.
