DC8 includes features like a Big Click Filter which will automatically repair the extremely large clicks created by a cracked or badly gouged record.

It has a Direct Spectral Editor which provides you with the ability to manually attenuate or interpolate very long-lived noise events found on live recordings like coughs, whistling, chair movement and other unwanted spurious signals. We have also augmented the performance of the manual interpolator through the use of a combination of time and frequency domain techniques.

DC8 includes two very useful restoration effects called the Sub-Harmonic and the Overtone Synthesizer. These new effects help re-create the lost lower and upper octaves of a recording adding more life to your restorations.

File support has been extended to Broadcast Wave (BWF), FLAC, and Ogg Vorbis.

The built in CD burner now supports Disc-at-Once (gapless) CD creation along with CD text support. DC8 also supports Data Disc burning capability.

The DC Tune Library has expanded capability allowing you to use the Multifilter and all of its effects and presets on files being played. The DC Tune Library also now includes shuffle play and repeat play modes.
