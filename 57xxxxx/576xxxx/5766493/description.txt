Barry Grossman's sitcom -- apparently one of the few series to be commissioned on the basis of an unsolicited submission to the BBC script unit -- was picket-fence stuff dealing with the clash of cultures in a north London Jewish community.  

The settled existence of Orthodox rabbi Abraham Fine is disturbed by the appearance of a brand-new Reform synagogue led by the vivacious Su Jacobs, a youthful and decidedly non-traditional rabbi, who sets about introducing the Hillsend area to the wonders of the world-wide web and her profound views on the importance of cosmetics.  

The storylines poked a certain amount of fun at both leading characters, mainly through the agency of Abraham's long-suffering wife Sadie, unarguably the true wise teacher of the series, who befriended Su and strove to keep the peace with varying degrees of success.  

Cast:
Tracy-Ann Oberman as Rabbi Su Jacobs
