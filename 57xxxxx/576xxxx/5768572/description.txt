          As two young girls embark on a quest for         
          a legendary treasure, they discover an even        
        more valuable prize - the enduring power of       
          loyalty and friendship - in Gold Diggers:           
           The Secret of Bear Mountain. Beth (Christina          
             Ricci) and Jody (Anna Chlumsky) couldn't be         
            more different. Beth is a city girl who has         
           just moved from Los Angeles to a small town       
              in the Pacific Northwest: Jody is a rough-         
                and-rumble tomboy who's right at home in the
                woods and lakes surrounding her hometown.
                Together they trace the decades-old legend
                of Molly Morgan, who may have stashed a
                fortune in gold in the labyrinth of caves
                in Bear Mountain. Climaxing in a hair-raising 
                chase in the spooky mountain caverns, it's
                a 24-karat tale that sparkles with humor,
                warmth and breathtaking excitement.

                   Two years ago we gave you a Laserdisc
                 rip of this 90s Disneyish kids classic.
                 Now that Universal has been kind enough
                 to offer it as a print-on-demand DVDR in
                 their Vault series, we're of course
                 bringing you an updated DVDRip.

                   Gold Diggers seems on the surface to be
                 your typical kids-go-on-a-wild-adventure
                 type of film, but it has something to offer
                 that most other titles from this genre
                 don't: Christina Ricci and Anna Chlumsky.
                 For those who don't remember Anna, she's
                 the girl you had a crush on when you were
            a kid and just finished watching My Girl.         
             Here she plays a tomboy with terrible hair,         
               and this time it's not her mom who's dead,           
               but rather Christina's dad. In the end              
              this movie is more about the developing            
           friendship between the two girls than it           
           is about gold or treasure maps, but                  
              there's still plenty of adventure to go                 
               around.

            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.

                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.

                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           
         get back.
