A selection of Breakcore and electro gabba or whatever ya wanna call it

A wild and unusual selection ripped from a stack of cd's found in an empty trailer at a teknival!

Loads of rare and hard to find tracks from the likes of Aaron spectre, Bong ra, Enduser, Duran duran duran, Ebola and others.#

A musical treat/experience/torture

Enjoy!!
