Two giant creatures terrorize tourists on the Big Island.

Roger Corman helped unleash Dinocroc in 2004. Then he let loose Supergator in 2007. In 2010 these rampaging reptiles will collide in an epic smackdown of Syfy proportions: Dinocroc vs. Supergator! Cult filmmaker Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Return of Swamp Thing) serves as fight promoter. The late David Carradine will make one of his final appearances as a referee in-between these two toothy titans.
