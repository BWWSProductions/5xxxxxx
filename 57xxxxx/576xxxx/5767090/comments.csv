,jdgraves,2010-09-22T15:36Z,I was wondering how to get the subtitles to work. I should know this but I don't. I want to burn this off. I would appreciate any help.
[T],HenryGT,2010-10-12T16:16Z,"if you want English subtitles do this --
go to subtitles folder
copy the English subtitle .srt file and paste it to the folder where .mkv is. and rename the .srt file with the .mkv's name.
now you have .srt and .mkv files with same name.
ex:-  Romance.mkv
        Romance.srt
now play the .mkv in your player.thats all subtitles will work ! enjoy!"
