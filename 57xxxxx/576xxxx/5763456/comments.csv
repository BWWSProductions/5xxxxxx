,chong67,2010-08-18T17:42Z,"I keep getting that annoying pop up each time I open the program about configuration and remind to register thing even though I hit Never Register.  I have put in the serial # already.

Any way to stop this?"
,ArclightX,2010-09-13T06:12Z,Thank-you Thank-you!
,chong67,2010-09-17T05:28Z,"I found the answer.

To prevent the annoying pop up, right click and Run as Admin and that will disable it."
,amz_101,2010-10-07T17:14Z,"This is a great torrent!  I have not idea why it's got -16, but it's a clean torrent that works flawlessly.

Scanned with AVGFree 11"

,remedy2,2011-02-02T05:05Z,"Norton detects possible virus in file pd11_pro.exe (not the keygen)

I downloaded Perfectdisk 11 pro (PD11_Pro.exe) from the Raxco website and scanned it with norton and no virus was detected.  

I recommend users tread carefully before installing this program.  I installed it and recently had someone hack my Yahoo mail account with difficult a password so I possibly had a trojan/keylogger on my comp.  Whether it is related to this file or not I'm not sure.  If its not sorry, just looking for connections. Do what you will with this info."
,Mathlol,2011-05-21T00:09Z,"Another one.  Still the best out there. 

You CAN do upgrades.  So don't run to the immediately released 185s that state ""don't use updates"""
