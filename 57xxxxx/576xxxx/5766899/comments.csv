Secondly, I won't go as far to say that those who got it working were intentionally saying or ""supporting"" Robbing here. 

I'm merely curious as to whether i've done anything wrong, because the instructions were rather vague besides blocking WindowBlinds and patching. Besides, Robbing isn't the kind of uploader that uploads shitty torrents anyways."

,g0dsize,2010-08-27T23:48Z,"@ Robbinghood: How about replying to some of the people with legitimate concerns rather than resort to trolling on your own torrent?

With that out of the way, this torrent is the same as countless other WB7 torrents - it patches, but the program is still shareware/trial, with or without your net connected.  WB doesn't connect to the net to check your trial period anyway, it uses your PC's date and the install date."
,rjjgenius,2010-08-28T13:15Z,"---->>>RobbingHood

Sir, your Windows Blinds 7.1.273

Doesn't work in my Windows XP. Still it always says that it is a Shareware."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-28T15:01Z,"@rjjgenius 

The term shareware just refers to the fact that it's not freeware, so that won't disappear. 

The info aboput how to use the patch is very simple and clear, and if it doesn't work for anyone then that's not because of the patch. Before torrents are posted here they have been tested by a lot of reliable user, and all possible issues are known by then. 

So far I haven't read any concrete issues here about activation besides some vague complains, even thought the program apparently is working. So everybody is welcome to complain if after the trial period the prog cannot be used anymore."
,Devione,2010-08-28T16:20Z,"Ok, I take that back. 

It seems now that if I apply a new skin, the popup with a countdown that does move and decreases is present, however if accessing the program directly and applying other installed skins the popup and countdown asking for purchase does not move / decrease.

This crack works. Thanks alot Robbing."

I did. I blocked all Windowblinds from accessing the internet as well. All I got was one countdown timer that gets stuck at ""30 days remaining"" and a pop up countdown that actually decreases in time.

I was merely curious as to what AeonOptic did to get 14881 days left."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-03T01:22Z,"@Minee22

A false positive does not mean that the file in case contains an infected file which can be removed.

Many keygens etc contain (some of the same) signatures, scripts, or binaries etc which are also used by 
viruses. That's why some av scanners may say that a file contain the recognition pattern of a known virus.
And since a virus scanner doesn't make a difference between a good and a bad virus most people just think 
that every detected file is a bad file.

However, sometimes a third party added a bad virus to a clean file. Usually such files can simply be 
extracted by, for example, WinRAR. The repacked and extracted file may contain the original file and 
another infected file or more. In that case the infected file(s) can simply be removed/deleted. 

In other cases a detected file may be extracted while all extracted files belong to the original file.
Removing any from the extracted files and repacking the clean files as an .exe file may result in a 
not working .exe file. 

If a keygen or patch is detected but cannot be extracted you can also use, for example, Sandboxie to 
safely test the detected keygen or patch, and to check if and where possibly infected files are stored.
Everthing stays within Sandboxie, but in the end also Sanboxie is not 100% safe. Another way to run and 
install files safely is by using a virtual machine (VMware is pretty populair).


Note that sometimes you'll need to run some keygens etc outside Sandboxie or VMware to have them working.


Bottom line: Just don't use any suspicious files if you don't know what you're doing. There's too much
to explain here, but a lot can be found and learned through internet (and/or google etc).

BTW: Most of the above is mentioned at the bottom of my torrent descriptions and included Readme.txt files."
,XMercer,2010-09-05T17:57Z,"I downloaded this torrent, followed the instructions, etc. However, when I go to re-color a theme, it still says it's the trail version, and I can't recolor it.

,Soluna,2010-09-11T04:18Z,"Well, I did as the instructions have told me;

I disable internet before and during installation.

After installation, I used Windows Firewall to block each and every program inside the Stardock folder from the internet.

I patched the program by running as Administrator, and the patcher said that it was done.

The counter is at 29 days now; I suppose I should let it drop to 0 to see how it goes.

And it's counting down as a trial. 28 days left. I'm gonna let it go and see how it goes. This is on Windows 7 Ultimate x64 from this site.

My friend, who is using Windows XP Home 32-bit, followed the same method, and got the 14,896 days. So that could be an issue with Windows 7, and maybe Vista?

I'll repost when the trial runs out and let you guys know."
,SLeePYG00,2010-09-14T05:55Z,"UPDATE: I just changed from a downloaded skin (Wincustomize), to Aero Clay, it switched over, then when I changed back to the downloaded one, it reset the trial time to 30 days.

I did what that user did and it worked the same way. I just changed my theme to one of their themes, then I changed it back to what I wanted, and then the counter went back to 30 days. I would have never found this myself since I would never change.

,VenusAnnie,2010-09-18T17:19Z,"Oppareul - The reason that you get that error is because your anti-virus is trying to block you from opening the file.  A lot of anti- virus programs will treat piracy software like viruses, so you never know if the file is really a virus or not unless you try to figure it out yourself.  (Ex. file size, icon present when not blocked, etc.)

1.) If you use AVG, open it's main console and click tools -> settings and select PUP Extensions on the left.  Click add exception and browse for the file you want to have the scanner ignore.

2.) Click Excluded files (under resident shield) and then click add and find the file you want the resident shield to ignore.  (Just an FYI, Resident shield is what AVG uses to actively protect your system.  When you browse a directory, it will scan that directory for you and it also scans some things in the background as well.)

Hope this helps.  The file should open and give you an icon if you refresh the folder.  =)

5. Select any ""stardock"" theme, it will be applied.

I am running 32 bit windows as administrator, and no matter what I do I cannot get the patch to run. Moreover, it seems I have been denied access to the patch fullstop, as though the file itself were protected. I have also tried running it through the command line, with no results save the reply that I do not have access to the file.

It may be worthy of note here that after some frustration I attempted to copy and paste the file but was restricted even from that.

,jesus.,2010-10-12T21:58Z,"Geez, this uploader really shouldn't ever work for customer service.  Reading through all the comments and after having this torrent installed on my computer for 30 days, I can tell you that after 30 days, a window still pops up saying 14000 days are still remaining, but the trial is EXPIRED.  You CAN NOT apply any Stardock or downloaded skins after 30 days are up.

What you CAN do, however, is momentarily reset your computer's clock to a date within the 30 days that you installed the software.  For example, I installed a month ago, so I simply reset my computer's clock to 1 week ago, tried to apply a downloaded skin, and it WORKED!  I then reset my computer's clock back to the correct date and it's still running as I type this.

I can't say whether this is attributed to the crack or just some flaw in Stardock's trial process, but it works if you don't mind doing it every time you start up your computer.

TL;DR: set your computer's clock to a date within the 30-day trial period, apply skin, set correct date, repeat when you restart your computer."

If you expect me to solve everybody their problem for free then you're wrong, especially if they talk like jerks.

,VenusAnnie,2010-10-16T03:29Z,"OK, I'm not sure how long this works, but I may have fixed a long overdue issue no one ever looked into.  I ran SysInternals Process Monitor (Microsoft product) and watched what the system was doing when Window Blinds checked if it was expired or not.  I noticed that it no longer says it's a trial all the time and it started allowing me to apply themes after using the Adrian patch.  (I'd imagine that this one's patch will be a fine substitute.)  So, here's what it was checking and how to fix it.

1.) Open C:\Windows\win.ini

2.) Remove the following lines:


[zktrpliAorkjhkW2]
weddpnnhgh87hjhkj16=1284437609
[sotiiperlpard]
ttttladrsariae=634200289869042460

I patched as suggested and when I used the suggestion from VenusAnnie I was able to find only one file and a similar file to what she suggested to remove. I removed both and now my trial is for 14,937 days and I'm happy. Thank you!"
,SnapplerX,2010-11-05T06:20Z,"I can't figure this out. I have had WindowBlinds 7 before, then i uninstalled it after the trial ran out. Then, I saw this crack came out so i reinstalled it, and used this crack. Everything was going good, except it kept showing the day count and it was going down. So i thought it might keep working, but when the trial ran out, it stopped and i uninstalled it. I reinstalled, used the crack, and now all the applied themes change to Windows Classic. I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling, rebooting, apply D/L themes and preinstalled themes in different orders one after another, I tried the VenusAnnie trick (this was after it already started going to Windows Classic), I even waited a month and reinstalled it. Nothing. It keeps changing the theme to Windows classic. Applying windows Aero changes it back, but thats it. Nothing else works. It looks like its gonna work, you see the screen blur and the little sign that shows the theme is applying is there, but when its done, it just changes to classic.

Please help me out here, I been trying this for so long and I can't figure out the problem. 

Thank you so much."
,VenusAnnie,2010-11-09T18:35Z,"@SnapplerX - Try this solution.

1.) Uninstall everything.
2.) Do my trick I posted.
3.) Clear your temp files:
     %WINDIR%\TEMP
     YOUR_USER_DIR\AppData\Local\Temp
     YOUR_USER_DIR\AppData\Local\Stardock (Purge anything for WindowBlinds in this dir.)
     YOUR_USER_DIR\AppData\LocalLow\Temp
     YOUR_USER_DIR\AppData\Roaming\Stardock (Purge anything for WindowBlinds in this dir.)
     Program Files\Stardock\Object Desktop\WindowBlinds (Remove this directory.)

4.) Open Run and type regedit and search for Stardock and Windowblinds and remove all instances it finds that pertain to WindowBlinds.

5.) Reinstall, crack, and use the tweak I described.  Here it is again:

Edit %WINDIR%\win.ini and remove the following:

[zktrpliAorkjhkW2]
weddpnnhgh87hjhkj16=1284437609

NOTE: If you only use WindowBlinds and no other Stardock products, just go through and remove anything Stardock related.  Also, I use this method to clean up old programs that seem to be causing similar issues to what you are having.  I didn't try it with WindowBlinds, but this should work.  It's good to do this anyway."

Thank you for the reply. 
After following all of your steps, it still does not work.
Now, it still switches to classic mode but its different. 
Now, it shows like seven instances of wbload.exe in my task manager processes tab.
Also, it keeps popping up that there seems to be an issue with your installation of windowblinds. would you like to fix it? Yes or No.
Neither button does anything and it pops up every time i try to apply a theme.
I have tried every combination of reinstalling, restarting and all the other steps but nothing works.
If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it."
,VenusAnnie,2010-11-16T02:10Z,"By the way, my tweak will extend your usage for as long as you need, but I found that it will show the 30 days remaining stuff when you restart your computer, but reapplying my tweak resets the timer.

@SnapplerX - This may or may not work, but repeat my instructions once again, but this time don't install the included crack.  As my tweak is a timer reset tweak that modifies what the program checks, it may not be necessary to modify the actual program itself.  I think the trial does everything the full version does, but it just stops working in 30 days.

Let me know if that works, I'd be interested to know.  Oh, and the broken installation bit is because of the crack.  It looks strange to the program is all, so I don't think it's an issue.  Either RobbingHood's crack or another crack I tried said that it would say it once, you click OK, and then it stops bothering you, but won't hurt the program.  If it keeps doing it, then yes, something was installed/cracked wrong and we can keep working on the fix.

I'll keep working with you whenever I have a chance.  This is the most difficult program to crack I've heard and I know a lot of people just leave people hanging on here.  Where's the caring in sharing is caring when people don't help people?  lol"
,SnapplerX,2010-11-18T02:29Z,"@VenusAnnie
Thank you for being patient with me.
Its still not working.
I did everything you said and now its weird.
Instead of changing to classic, it now changes to windows standard. But, the buttons (close, min, max) do change to go along with the theme i picked. I did not crack it and the error window still pops up that it needs to be fixed. I have tried clicking yes and no but its still pops up every time i try applying a theme.
Also, the 30 days left window now appears.
This is very strange. 
I went through the entire registry and every file that even contained the word 'windowblinds' (using EFS) and deleted them all (the ones that actaully had anything to do with the program).
It still not working."

,mite_jan,2010-12-03T22:10Z,"i've got an idea but i don't know if this will work
you don't need even cracks or patches for this
install windowblinds 7 and write down the date when you installed it . Use windowblinds till it expires and the day it expires change the date you've installed it
so the only thing you need to do is change your day after every 30 days when it expires
WHAT DO YOU THINK GUYS ?"
,tonymorcom,2010-12-06T00:44Z,"Using windows 7. Have patched as per instructions carefully deleting every bit of old install inc registry entries and doing search of computer. Challenge is that every time I open wb it writes to the winini file the following:[zktrpliAorkjhkW2]
weddpnnhgh87hjhkj16=1291592619 It does not matter how often i delete it it just reappears again. There must be something else somewhere that is allowing this to be written. There is no mention of the other bit that it was suggested to be deleted in an earlier post. Any ideas guys. Have tried it all several times now with same results and incidentally still get 30 days message appearing."
,MrSmithr,2010-12-10T10:35Z,"The patch isn't a great one. It just removes the ""buy now!"" button mostly. Doesn't work after trial runs out even with the suggestion. Although i am a pirate and always have been i bought a serial code while it was on offer :). "

,supanut2000,2010-12-28T14:48Z,"For future downloaders I would recommended trying it inside a virtual machine eg vmware/xp mode/virtualbox/vpc2007.
Also disable shared folders!
Also create a snapshot before starting the program installation so you can revert things back!
Also read all comments before downloading torrents!
Bottom line is that, do not download things from bullies."
,derrrface,2010-12-28T20:40Z,I'll stick with 5.5; works great and doesn't require as many system resources as this build.

,crazeeeej,2011-02-07T18:31Z,"Complete Step by Step On how I got my WindowBlinds7 Working

Specs: Windows 7 Ultimate Platform 32bit

What I Did:

1.) Downloaded This Torrent AND DISCONNECTED FROM ALL INTERNET CONNECTIONS AVAILABLE (CRUCIAL! Do not forget this part)

2.) Installed WindowBlinds7

3.) My BitDefender blocked the patch.. so..

4.) Reboot in Safe Mode

5.) Extracted the patch again.

6. )Paste it in:
C:\Program Files\Stardock\Object Desktop\WindowBlinds
(depends on where you installed WindowBlinds)

7.) Run the patch as administrator.

8.) Reboot in Normal Mode

9.) Go to Control Panel - System And Security - Windows Firewall - Advanced Setting - Outbound Rules. Create a new rule to block sevenconfig.exe in the WinBlind directory.

10.) Applied a theme in WinBlind. The 30 days trial pops up.

11.) Reconnect to the internet.

12.) Go to C: - Windows and copy the win.ini file.

13.) Paste it a partition without your system. Usually in drive D: and edit it. Delete the find delete lines similar to these

[zktrpliAorkjhkW2]
weddpnnhgh87hjhkj16=1284437609

[sotiiperlpard]
ttttladrsariae=634200289869042460


13.) Saved the file and paste it back to C: - Windows. Move and replace.

14.) Go back to WinBlinds folder and edit sevenconfig properties. Set it to read only.

15.) Downloaded a theme from www.wincustommize.com

16.) Run the *.wba file. A Notification will appear on the system tray from WinBlind. Click to apply the theme.

17.) There it is. The trial period will pop up again.

I was so happy to see those digits that I had to make this right away to help those people like me. I am not sure that this will entirely work all through out the usage of Windows blind. 

Most of the credit goes to RobbingHood and VenusAnnie !

Go Pirates! argghh !! xD"
,crazeeeej,2011-02-07T20:15Z,I've notice that txt generated by winblind are sometimes still added in the win.ini.. i've tried erasing them again and made my win.ini read only. hope it still works. xD
