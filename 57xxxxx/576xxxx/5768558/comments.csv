[V],torrentzone,2010-08-18T05:59Z,"Since when is commenting on your own torrent considered spam? People don't have to click the links and it is a way to verify the legitimacy of the content. Besides, other uploaders include nfos with private tracker advertising and you allow them to continue to do so.

Guess it doesn't matter anymore, seeing as the site is closed. TPB really needs to come up w/ a better messaging system b/c I had no idea these comments were being removed."
