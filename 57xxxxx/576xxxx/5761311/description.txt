PLOT: A young man named Victor realizes the shortcomings 
of the Utopian ideals on the hippie commune where he was 
raised. Victor's mother is funding the commune where the 
guru Insley hypnotizes and seduces women with a technique 
he calls "running." Insley manipulates the minds of these 
women so that they give him their bodies and all their 
worldly possessions. Victor's childhood love, Becky, returns 
to take care of her deathly ill father. Victor, haunted by 
visions of Becky's death, is desperate to save her and himself 
by escaping from the polygamous cult. Preoccupied with Insley's 
free love philosophy, the adults of the community overlook the 
painful reality that the self destructive behavior of their 
children is most certainly due to early exposure to sex and drugs. 
To afford an escape, Victor tries to sell weed but is cut out by 
rivals competing for Becky's affection. Finally, Victor is torn 
between getting money from his mother who is entirely under Insley's 
influence, dealing with the violent drama of his drug-addled friends, 
and staying to save Becky as she spins out of control.
