,usghkh,2010-08-19T10:40Z,anyone  care to comment? Is the activation embedded or after install you have to manually do it? since i am looking for clean windows aio without any patch
,Rubby1,2010-08-24T03:47Z,I downloaded this and it came in at 4.9 GIB and doesn't fit on a standard DVD.  Anyone figure out how to burn this??
,spyked3,2010-08-25T07:58Z,try unpacking it with WINRAR and see if you can shrink it down somehow... That's what I'm trying right now.
,surfeit,2010-08-27T10:44Z,"I've installed win7 ~100 times and never created a dvd. Creating an installable USB flash drive is easy and well documented. Search ""install windows from usb"" This works for vista as well. Of course, the pc bios must support booting from a USB flash drive. An easy way to bypass changing bios is booting with a blank (or zeroed) hard drive and the bootable USB flash drive."

,iferhat,2011-02-13T20:40Z,"FYI ppl I have downloaded this and seeded a little long time ago. For my PC I chose to install Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit with alien activation and have had no issues at all. Updates still work and I recommend it to any body after a stable, proper and hassle free Windows 7 ANY VERSION!

wtf the fck was that question?............................................................



ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh i remember

If you have downloaded this and the ISO does not fit in to a standard 4.7gig DVD when attempting to burn, try and find those Double Layer DVD's NOT DUAL LAYER (double layer) which are over 8gig and burn this ISO at 2x speed only'. It will work!

Top DL i give it five hundred stars (500) stars
