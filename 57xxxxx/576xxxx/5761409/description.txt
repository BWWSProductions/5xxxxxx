                    Pete Versus Life is a new five-part comedy  
                    drama starring Rafe Spall as struggling young  
                    sports journalist Pete Griffiths. Although well  
                    meaning, Pete often lacks the emotional  
                    maturity required to deal with life's more  
                    intricate problems. He wishes that life had  
                    clearly defined rules, like sport. But life  
                    isn't like sport, as Pete is only beginning to  
                    realise. Pete goes to a party where Jake, a  
                    friend but also a rival, reveals an intimate  
                    detail about his sex life. Pete promises to  
                    keep it a secret, but then proceeds to tell  
                    everyone.
