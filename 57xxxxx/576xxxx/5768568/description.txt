          a horde of nasty, pint-sized demons from a

          a classic battle between good and evil as           
           the three kids struggle to overcome a                 
             nightmarish hell that is literally taking

                The Gate is a classic 80s horror film with a     
              child protagonist and an excellent assortment      
              of stop motion effects and Harryhausen-esque       
              creatures.                                         
                                                                 
                This is from the Special Edition DVD released    
              by Lionsgate, as far as we know the first R1       
              English language widescreen release. We've         
              actually been sitting on this for some time        
         unsure if there was ever a previous release or       
          perhaps a German widescreen release with English       
            audio but best we can find this does not appear         
            to be the case. The good news is this DVD very         
           closely resembles the same copy we've seen floating   
        around from a Showtime HD airing. It also appears     
        to have better color and a more accurate aspect         
           ratio than the other widescreen copies we've seen.         
            If its a dupe, oops! Otherwise, enjoy!                 
                                                                  
                                                               
                                            
                                                 
                      -+ Who We Are +-                  
                                                                   
                                                                    
            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.
 
                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.
 
                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           
         get back.
