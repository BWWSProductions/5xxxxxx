Foundling -- the stunning new effort by internationally acclaimed singer-songwriter David Gray -- begins with those evocative and somewhat mysterious words. What follows is an extraordinary song cycle of rare and timeless power that bears a rather fitting title. As people today may or may not remember, the word "foundling" is defined as "an infant found after its unknown parents have abandoned it." And as Gray puts it with a warm laugh, "Foundling sort of arrived at my door without my asking it to, so it felt very appropriate for this album."
