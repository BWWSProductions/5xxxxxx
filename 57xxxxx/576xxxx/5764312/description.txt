    The trials and tribulations of a sea otter pup growing     
    up on the coast of California.                            
    The Californian sea otter is one of the rarest, and      
    possibly cutest animals in the world. So when a sea       
    otter mum decides to have her pup amongst the yachts of    
    a millionaires' marina, it is a unique event. The mum     
    must teach her baby how to dodge the boats and find the  
    food in this busy harbour. However, the arrival of a      
    tough male sea otter signals disaster for the family.      
    When mum is attacked, the poor pup is left on her own     
    and must fight for survival.

     The BBC classify this episode as episode 3 of the         
     2010-2011 season, TVRage lists it as 29x17, bu the       
     previous run from 2009-2010 season was S29 so this by   
     all rights should be S30, however this could all change  
     at a later date, as usual it's a mess, something else to  
     be aware of is not all episodes seem to air in HD with   
     this particular series.
