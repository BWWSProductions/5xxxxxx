Metal Health is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Quiet Riot. It was released on March 11, 1983, bolstered by the #5 hit "Cum on Feel the Noize" and the #31 hit "Metal Health". It knocked The Police's Synchronicity out of #1 in the U.S. The album went on to sell more than 6 million copies and it is considered a classic among heavy metal fans to this day. However, some critics such as Allmusic [1], perceive it as a one-hit wonder, owing to Quiet Riot's relative lack of critical and commercial success with following albums (and subsequent disintegration) towards the end of the 1980s. The title track was ranked #35 on Vh1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs.

The band went on a tour the same year and also supported Black Sabbath on their Born Again tour in the U.S.

Slick Black Cadillac is a re-recorded version of the same song from Quiet Riot II.

The song Thunderbird was dedicated to guitarist and ex-member Randy Rhoads, who died in a plane crash on March 19, 1982.
