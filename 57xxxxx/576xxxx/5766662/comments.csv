,some-young-guy,2010-08-17T22:55Z,"@redrum, right click on the torrent in uTorrent and go to ""bandwidth allocation"" and set it to high.  This will decrease D/L time"

,bac1,2010-09-28T13:02Z,"People are getting slow speeds because of anti-peer-to-peer efforts by HBO. They hire companies to create fake seeders that only serve you incorrect data and then send you a cease and desist letter. When there's a torrent with a ridiculously large number of seeders it's usually because of this activity. Just use PeerBlock and your speeds will be fine, plus no C&D letter."
