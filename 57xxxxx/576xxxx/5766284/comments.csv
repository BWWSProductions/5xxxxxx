[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-17T20:39Z,"@ Lovejam, I will have to check episode summaries and watch and figure it out, but I am going to do my best to get the missing episode. I hope DVD-Rips become available soon, cuz then I will encode those. 

@ Everyone - Sorry guys. (-_-)  It looks like am going to be re-encoding most or all of my torrents with my old settings, but in the mean time I will release new stuff with my new settings. (*_*)"
