          If you've seen TV wrestling, you know what       
          a "caged" bout is. In Cage, it's for real;         
        two testosterone-pumped behemoths are placed      
          in a cage where they duke it out to the death.      
           Lou Ferrigno plays the muscle-bound Vietnam           
             vet who is finagled into cage-fighting by a         
            group of mobsters. Reb Brow, the man whose          
           life Ferrigno saved in Nam, finds himself         
              (through a series of ludicrous plot twists)        
                facing his former savior in the dreaded cage.  
                                                               
                 Tagline: A mentally handicapped Vietnam vet    
                          is tricked into taking part in a      
                          deadly contest of strength.

                 Lou Ferrigno, the world class body builder      
               and two-time consecutive Mr. Universe winner,     
               known for his movie roles as Hercules, Sinbad,    
               and the Incredible Hulk, stars here in Cage       
               and Cage II as a mentally disabled war vet.       
               According to many fans, Ferrigno puts on one      
               of his best and most unlikely performances in     
               Cage, a film likely made chasing the succes of    
               other big tournament fight films of the 80s.      
               For what they are both Cage and Cage II are       
               surprisingly good movies for the genre while      
          also managing some time on the topics of mental     
           disability and the bonds of friendship.               
                                                                    
              They're low budget, they're cheesey, and they've     
            got more than one unintended gay reference, but      
         by golly they're a fun watch. In this case the       
         DVD actually needed more cleanup than the              
            Laserdisc but no worries they both look quite             
             good now.

            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.
 
                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.
 
                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           
         get back.
