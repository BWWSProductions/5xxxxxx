[b]Earthsearch Mindwarp:[/b]  Mindwarp is a 3 part radio series based on the Mindwarp novel by James Follett. 
The series was first broadcast on BBC7 in 2006, beginning on April 2, and the episodes were 45 minutes long.
While it has only a loose connection to the Earthsearch series, it sets the stage for it, and contains many familiar plot elements and character traits. There you are, living deep underground, going about your daily life when you think, ;Hang on! Something;s not right here;What about the outdoors?; Well, that's just a myth ; something to frighten children. A threat for those who disobey the Guardian of Destiny. No one questions why things are as they are. No one wonders if there could be something more.-----


[b]Earthsearch:[/b] Some years before the story opens, the huge Earth starship Challenger, on a mission to find Earth-like planets for colonization, encountered a meteoroid shower that killed all of the adult crew and seriously damaged the ship. The only human survivors were four babies - two boys, Telson and Darv, and two girls, Sharna and Astra. The four have been raised from childhood by androids and tutored by two disembodied voices called Angel One and Angel Two. Most of the humans believe the voices are real angels, but Darv is more suspicious and believes they are actually computers.
