[V],Ekolb,2010-08-14T04:19Z,"It's XviD Codec and AVI format. The feed was from my satellite.  We been having bad weather and anyone that has a satellite will understand what I mean.

Frames get broken for short second but can cause havoc when encoding.  To keep the Audio in sync, some frames have to be removed which gives  you the skipping frame.  So it's not your player, it's just encoding method when above happens. Hope that explains...  Cable is more reliable then satellite as it doesn't go out during rain storms.  :)"
