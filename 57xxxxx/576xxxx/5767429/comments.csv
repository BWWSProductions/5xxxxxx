[T],SgtRlee,2012-01-27T03:06Z,"Just watching this cool video and i decided to visit this page and noticed 4 peers here so just give me about half an hour to reseed this for you fans (yes, i seeded this when i first got it, but i've been trying to keep all my posted torrents alive with the stupid Comcast 250GB cap per month. Real smart move on their part,not! They cap you at only 250GB, then try to sell you FASTER internet so you can get to that cap quicker...?  '.'"
