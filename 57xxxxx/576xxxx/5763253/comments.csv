Thank you for the encode/upload.

I know you may disappear tomorrow when your PC gives up it's final life BUT it is good to see you here again.

Cheers

I have just UPed Craig Ferguson 13th August.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5763539/Craig.Ferguson.2010.08.13.Anna.Kendrick

He has resurrected his old yet again and is trying to UP as many torrents as he can before it dies AGAIN.

He cannot UP this show himself as there is not enough interest and the system he is using to provide torrents is severely resticted. So I am doing this in his behalf.

,lilars26,2010-08-14T15:28Z,Thanks 20-40.I really have been enjoying this series and it looks like I'm not alone.
,CarolR,2010-08-15T02:00Z,"20/40 - I feel your pain... my job status (or lack there of) and my finances are the reason why you are a God to me. I have had to cancel TV, downsize my internet to 3mb DSL, cancel cell phone, etc. Without you my life would suck to the fullest. If I had the extra I would send you anything I had, because you are worth it and you've earned it. I am sorry I cannot. I thank you, from the bottom of my heart for what you have done, and anything you can still try to do for those in our situation. "
