[T],insinuendo,2010-08-15T23:22Z,The best version out there!
,improveurself,2010-09-19T07:31Z,"this rip has a couple of errors of sync (image/sound) at the 48' and 56'. i tested with vlc and mkplayer with the same mistake. not a perfect copy

by the way the sound it is not so great as usually a dts must be: big size for a movie  that is not worth it

take this advice:
get a small copy

anyway
tks to insinuendo..."
