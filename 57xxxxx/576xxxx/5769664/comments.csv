,AmbiquitY,2010-08-28T15:34Z,"Come on somebody please seed this, this torrent is awesome!!!"
,Parajunk,2010-08-30T17:18Z,so many downloaders and so little seeders.... 
,Parajunk,2010-09-06T16:35Z,"yow gap filler, fill this gap! 

slowest download ever known..."
[T],tzanev,2010-09-14T15:13Z,"Total fail... Check out my Chase & Status uploads. Not comprehensive by any means, but they are seeded."
,Thegapfiller,2010-09-20T13:19Z,Sorry if its slow guys says i have uploaded it one and a bit so someone should be seeding! My UL is rubbish! and @tzanev your chase and status torrents are balls
,J35T32,2010-09-26T15:01Z,"Can someone piece seed this stuck @ 70% 
thanks in advance :) "
,J35T32,2010-09-26T15:18Z,i have a 25MB UL as long as someone can seed enough to get me the last 30% i need i will seed it :)
,Parajunk,2010-09-26T22:04Z,stopped at 70% for a fue days now.. please seed
,Parajunk,2010-09-29T21:43Z,this truly sucks
,J35T32,2010-10-01T15:39Z,well if the original uploader would mind his torrent and start seeding again i could grab the remaining 30% and then seed long enough to get a few more people seeding atleast. i have 25MB UL and 100MB down so it shouldnt be an issue to get this seeded and circulating. just need thegapfiller to seed out the last 30%
,vdumble,2010-10-07T12:20Z,ok I know I probably sound dumb but how do I seed something anyway?? I don't even know what it means. Can someone please explain how I do it?
