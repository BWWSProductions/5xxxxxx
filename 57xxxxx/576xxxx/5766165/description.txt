In a single moment, everything changes. Seventeenyear- old Mia has no memory of the accident; she can only recall riding along the snow-wet Oregon road with her family. Then, in a blink, she fi nds herself watching as her own damaged body is taken from the wreck... A sophisticated, layered, and heartachingly beautiful story about the power of family and friends, the choices we all make?

 Everyone thinks it was because of the snow. And in
a way, I suppose thats true. 

 I wake up this morning to a thin blanket
of white covering our front lawn. It isnt even an inch, but in this
part of Oregon a slight dusting brings everything to a standstill as
the one snowplow in the county gets busy clearing the roads. It is wet
water that drops from the skyand drops and drops and drops not the
frozen kind.
