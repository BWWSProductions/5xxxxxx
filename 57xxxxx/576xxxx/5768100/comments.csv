There's also a great Amiga emulator UAE4DROID , it's free on Android market for those interested in emulation.

Thanks again Thug~"

,Spurge42,2010-08-18T14:53Z,"The Atari2600 emulator is called Droid2600. It's only new.  You can see it on the Android market.

Thanks for all your other stuff also :)"
,rapsn1,2010-08-22T01:05Z,"do u need qwerty keyboard or so to use this emulators, or can I just use my screen and maybe volume/home/back/menu buttons ? Im using Galaxy S."
,fenixt,2010-08-22T02:43Z,Are these full version or lite?
,caimstear,2012-01-20T00:33Z,"I don't know if you're still on here, But how do i get this to work? I downloaded a gba_bios.bin file to use as a bios, but just when i select a rom, it won't load it, but it will still be running on my phone."
,Capnmaf,2012-03-24T06:46Z,"I'm having the exact same issue as caimstear. Is Gameboid possibly corrupt? I've tried two bio's and three different roms (all pokemon ones :P) and it seems to try and start the game, and then closes it immediately.

Gbcoid however works like a charm. Thanks for the torrent."
