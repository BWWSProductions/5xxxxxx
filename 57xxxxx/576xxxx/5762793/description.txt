This is a book of wisdom and understanding. It is not meant to speak to those not on the path of realization, truth and love, and is therefore neither pretty nor overly verbose. Instead, the aphorisms and truths will be reached by being dragged into the same mindset as the author, the same awareness and journey.

May you attain all you wish.
