      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


Release Notes: Includes 2 Rebuild PS2 games to DVD Format, Both Pal and a Ntsc 
               Patched Version. The Screen offset on the Ntsc game isn't perfect 
               but its the best it could be patched at and hardly noticeable. You 
               can play Virtua Cop with just your controller but it sucks, get 
               yourself a Ps2 LightGun and enjoy the game how its meant to be 
               played. Virtua Cop Elite Edition only came out in CD-R Pal Format  
               for the PS2 which is why I upgraded it, hope you like it.
 

You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

Relive the Arcade days of Virtua Cop again on your Ps2.

Virtua Cop: Elite Edition is a combination of Virtua Cop 1 & 2.

You play a cop who has been called out to deal with a certain situation, armed with your trusty sidearm. Enemies pop out from behind most objects and a reticule lights up around them to let you know they are armed and dangerous. You have to have quick reflexes as innocent people pop up which need to be protected.

There are 6 levels in all, 3 from each game and these levels have multiple stages. With the three difficulty levels on offer, along with the modifications you can make in the options setup such as the number of continues and auto reload and taking off the enemy indicator, you can make the game as difficult or as easy as you wish. There are multiple paths on some levels so there is some incentive to replay the levels.

There is a 2 player co-operative mode which can still be played with two light guns or you can use the Dual Shock pad. Training is also available. Even though this an old Sega Saturn game, it hasn't been improved much for the PS2 so expect a smoother gameplay of the older graphics.


Features:

* Featuring over 15 stage through 6 different levels.

* 2 Play Cooperative mode, training mode, Gallery, and a high score ranking table.

* This surely regains its crown as king of the shooters.

* Supports NAMCOs G-Con 2 Light Gun.


Game Pics Included.


Burn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  

Burn at 8x or 4x Speed.

Use Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't 
working.


(A DVD-RW probably won't work use either DVD-R or DVD+R)


If Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.
(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)
