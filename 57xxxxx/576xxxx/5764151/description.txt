DVDneXtCOPY iTurns does not violate COPYRIGHT LAW
DVDneXtCOPY iTurns does not disable any DRM* Protection. iTurns uses a feature inside the DRM Protection that allows you to make Audio CD copies of your purchased content. This does not violate US and European law because it is not circumventing and is part of DRM. Instead of illegally defeating copy-protection measures, iTurns uses an innovative, technically optimized process that records original files as they play and legally burns files to a virtual CD-RW drive on your hard drive, saving the recordings in unprotected digital formats. *Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a copy protection technology that is designed to restrict the illegal distribution of copyrighted music. Forms of control can include restrictions on the use of certain music players, how many times a purchased music file can be burnt to CD or the number of computers it can be transferred to.
