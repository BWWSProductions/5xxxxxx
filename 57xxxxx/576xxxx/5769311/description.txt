John Lawrence Finnegan, better known by his stage name Larry Finnegan(Some have him listed with stage name \"Larry Finneran\")(October 10, 1938 â€“ July 22, 1973) was an American pop singer.
Born in New York, Finnegan\'s only hit in the U.S. was 1962\'s \"Dear One\" (Old Town), which went to #11 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and climbed to #1 in Australia. The recording had sold one million copies by 1966, earning a gold disc. 
In the mid 1960s Finnegan moved to Sweden, where he had more hits. In 1966 he started his own record label SvenskAmerican, which published his own records - for example the singles \"Good Morning Tears\" and \"Bound for Houston\" - and also records with the Swedish group Sven-Ingvars. Finnegan recorded several records in Swedish, such as \"Maria, min vÃ¤n\" (Maria, my friend) and \"HÃ¤lsa hem till mamma\" (Send your greetings to my mamma) in 1967. After that he moved to Switzerland, and in 1970 back to the United States.
