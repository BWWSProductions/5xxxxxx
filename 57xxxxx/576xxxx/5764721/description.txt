    New York Times culture reporter Robin Pogrebin talks to John
     Leguizamo.
 
     Notes: I went for the optional size on this one since the
      bitrate (and image quality) sky rocketed at 700mb, now it's
     much more "normal".
 
     The Divas are here just to chillout and kill some time..
    If you need to get a hold of The Divas for whatever reason,
   you should know how to do it.
