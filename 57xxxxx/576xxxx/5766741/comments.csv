,Poodleface,2010-08-16T22:33Z,"Some strange audio problems with this torrent - it sounds almost as in another video is playing concurrently in the background. Don't know if this is a part of the episode, but it seems unusual. Anyone else have this?"
,trujayree,2010-08-17T02:21Z,Same problem here. Its almost like there are two audio tracks playing at the same time. Otherwise excellent quality as always.
,fatality54,2010-08-18T19:12Z,ive got the same problem to. like i hear some of it but only like if it was a loud part i would hear it 10 seconds later.
