Translinear Light CD

Coltrane plays piano and organ, and is joined by her sons, Ravi and Oran, both of whom play saxophone with impressive authority and sensitivity (some of the album's best moments feature the two in dialogue with their mother). The Coltrane family ... Full Descriptionis flanked by a stellar cast, which includes drummer Jack DeJohnette and bassist Charlie Haden, among others. The set list includes traditional hymns, Coltrane originals, and new readings of songs by John Coltrane ("Crescent," "Leo"), all rendered with fiery intensity and transcendent purpose.

Alice Coltrane's first studio album after a 26-year break from recording, and her last before her death in 2007, TRANSLINEAR LIGHT is one of the artist's finest albums. Like masterpieces from the 1970s such as UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS and TRANSFIGURATION, TRANSLINEAR LIGHT weaves Eastern modalities, gospel fervor, and avant-garde explorations into improvisational compositions that pulse with exquisite beauty.

Uncut (p.76) - 3 stars out of 5 - "Here, she eschews the harp in lieu of piano and Wurlitzer organ, both of which she plays to shimmering, transcendent effect."

The Wire (p.52) - "[W]hen she catches fire, you can feel that where once she appeared a little blinded by her husband's light, much of that radiance is now hers to emanate."

JazzTimes (pp.80-1) - "TRANSLINEAR LIGHT channels the raw magic of Alice Coltrane's classic early albums....Seamless, and wholly refreshing."

Mojo (Publisher) (p.102) - 4 stars out of 5 - "She intricately weaves ebullient, piercing improvisation with inspired tonal, harmonic, raga explorations and reflective, gentle antiphonals."
