Elektra Records and HBO have joined forces once again for 'True Blood: Music From The HBOÂ® Original Series Volume 2.' 
The album follows last year's Grammy Award nominated 'True Blood:Music From The HBOÂ® Original Series,' 
which featured tracks from the acclaimed HBO drama's first season, including the sultry theme song, 'Bad Things' 
performed by Jace Everett. Volume 2 follows suit with an all-star track list including Bob Dylan, Beck, 
Lucinda Williams with Elvis Costello and more.
