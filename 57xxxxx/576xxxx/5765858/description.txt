Los Angeles, 11th July 2029. 3 billion human lives ended on 29th August 1997. The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day. They lived only to face a new nightmare, the war against the Machines...Ten years ago: The Machines of skynet sent a terminator from the future to kill Sarah Connor. They failed. Now: The machines will try again. Their new target: The future leader of the resistance--Sarah's son young John Connor. As before, a lone warrior will be sent to protect him. The only question is... Who will reach John first?


Note: This release contains the latest revision (LA4 - 8/3/92) and an emulator (Mame v0.139.1.0), which emulates the game as if you were playing it on the original arcade machine (guns not included). I've preconfigured it (1 player, Pixel Aspect, Free Play) and disabled the crosshairs from mame (no double crosshair).


Extras: Launcher (T2.exe), 5 High res Icons and the original Operations Manual


Install: Extract & Play
