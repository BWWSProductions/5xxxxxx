What a waste of a quality movie =_="
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-16T21:41Z,"@ cap1985 - I am sorry I had already done it and uploaded it before I had changed the settings, I promise I will redo it with my current settings. (^_^) "
,cap1985,2010-08-17T05:31Z,"@The_Day_Walker: Wow, this would be super awesome, thank you!

Could you please do Futurama S06E08 again, too? Your release of episode 9 is perfect :)"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-17T20:29Z,@ cap1985 - It looks like I am gonna redo just about every torrent that is was not encoded with my new settings.
,cap1985,2010-08-18T08:13Z,"Awesome man, love your new settings :D

Might I ask if you already have some Disney classics in the pipes? I loved Aladdin & Lion King by OOO, would be rad to build up a nice collection."
