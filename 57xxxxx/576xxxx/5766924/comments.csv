Many DTS-s on blue-rays are futile just to make the disc sexier and sell better.
They are like when you convert a 198 KB/s music album to 320 KB/s then upload it, wishing for more attention (peers) & to be able to upload it to sites where they allow uploading only from 320 KB/s upwards quality music.  I got fulled a few times with such torrents, when I realized my 192 KB/s song sounded better then the damned fake 320 KB/s song."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-08-17T14:47Z," Sample is only 12 MB(all my samples are small) to encourage you to download it.
 See if your system (cpu, videocard) can play it, if not go for the 720p version (CINEFILE). 
MPC will play it easier, softer and louder  then VLC."

However it seems difficult to play the non-english audio ON A TV. Any ideas anyone ?"
,Orbtastic,2011-09-30T12:40Z,If you want to hear a non-English soundtrack you will need to remux the audio soundtracks you want to the mkv file using mkvmerge. It's fairly painless and isn't system intensive.
