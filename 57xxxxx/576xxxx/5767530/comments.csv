This is my first Torrent. Any advice or suggestions are welcome.

Ques: I released this Torrent 3.5 hrs ago and have 2 Seeds and 28 Peers. But my uploaded data is sitting at 0b??

Am i doing something wrong??

Peace"
,786AAA,2010-08-19T11:15Z,"Okay: All is working well now!
Except the first 11 full Leeches became just that 'Leeches' - If we dont seed this whole thing does not work!

Seed or go home.... "
