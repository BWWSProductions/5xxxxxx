,XJRacerik,2010-08-17T05:07Z,I thought I had labeled it- it's the Pirate Bay database from just before the tracker was shut down.
,GrawCube,2010-11-03T18:56Z,So what's in the database?
,XJRacerik,2010-11-11T17:53Z,"Everything that the pirate bay was connected to before they had to move from sweden. All videos, all games....EVERYTHING. It's in a format to allow us (any of the downloaders) to host a pirate bay 'branch office' for lack of a better term."
,Tidosho,2011-01-24T02:08Z,"This is the FULL thing, even the frontend site? Awesome! Keep seeding guys, I want to host a copy, and convert another copy of the frontend into my own torrent site, as I'm now getting used to the TPB site!"
,Tidosho,2011-01-24T02:09Z,I promise to try and seed this indefinitely once finished on my seedbox ;)

,JoabW,2012-03-09T22:28Z,"Agree with FRITZBox, awesome. Thanks"
,IMUSA73,2012-03-22T01:53Z,That is pretty awesome... but now I think people can  get a more compressed version of this..
