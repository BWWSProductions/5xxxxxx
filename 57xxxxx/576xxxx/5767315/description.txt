 Description:
 The fifth set of groups audition in front of the judges and the audience.     
 After they have all performed the phone lines are opened for this week's      
 public vote. At the end of the show Emma reveals that Cherish and Funky Little
 Choir have finished second and third in the public vote and will have to      
 perform in the wild card showdown. She then announces that Truedynamixs have  
 topped the vote and gained a place in the final. After Cherish and Funky      
 Little Choir have performed again the judges decide to give Cherish the wild  
 card. Those that have made it though via the wild card also return and perform
 once again. The judges then have to decide to put Swish through to the final  

                                Enjoy!
