,hello40204,2010-08-16T20:59Z,no screens and the bigger file quality picture is really dark and blury. my take on this one is smaller file. more pixels and less quality. which means really bad

A:V:M - 3:7.5:IDK YET.

It might destroy your External HD or Like it did to me, your 8GB Cruzer Thumb Drive.

BUT I FIXED IT, ;-)

Hardware doesn't work without an OS, or Drivers.

Thank you Froggie100.

,29385729-Unknown,2010-08-17T06:12Z,"I Tried to Copy the File Again, ""The Expendable"" it worked... It Copied this time, after I fixed the 8GB Cruzer Thumb Drive.

Idk what happend the first time, but it wasn't good, it helps though to give others a heads up, if somthing like that would happen...

I know that I've worked very hard to get almost 1000 movies on my 1TB hard drive, and if there were a virus, sorta like the one that tried to knock out my SanDisk 8GB Cruzer Thumb Drive, and there were other people out there that were like me, trying to get MAD Movies, A Movie Collector if you will, that they'd want to be warned if there were a Virus on there.

BUT....

As soon as you saw my message on here, you'd just delete it anyways, and they wouldn't know about it... lol, but you can't be online and watch this page all the time, so ...


How do you embed a virus into an Avi File, just wondering...


If you didn't try to take out my 1TB hard drive, and if it was someone that intercepted the transfer on BitTorrent, then you don't have anything to worry about Froggie100.

Very Watchable, The Best Copy out of 3 different people.

THANK YOU FROGGIE100, THANK YOU. AWEOSME, I WANTED TO SEE THIS SOOOO MUCH, ... THIS MOVIE LOOKS SO PROMISING.
