,sad4life,2010-08-16T16:05Z,off course.
,hello40204,2010-08-16T21:16Z,"so what is it ? sarcasm or actually a blown up dvd .
wish he had a sample . when is it suppose to come out in blu-ray ?"
,Sn0rF,2010-08-16T21:41Z,"OMG. I don't think this is even a DVD upscale, the quality is at best the same a my DVD rip... If you upload 720p, then upload 720p, not this crap! I watch it at my 50'' plasma, and it is horrible."
,JamieA242,2010-08-16T21:52Z,i wish you could flag torrent on piratebay for things like viruses of misleading incorrect content
,JoTrash1,2010-08-16T22:01Z,"This is a joke! An upscaled version of the DVDRip, even the aspect ratio is wrong! Audio goes mute after 6 minutes!

V/1
A/0"
,pizzahut123,2010-08-17T01:02Z,i just downloaded this and the quality looks like fucking dawg shit. remove this garbage NOW!
,nittany,2010-08-17T02:34Z,"So the quality is no good then?  Hmmm, why is this called bluray when it's just upscaled?

Maybe that pink skull should be removed from DibyaTPB or maybe this was just a simple mistake of mislabeling?"
,allrockedout,2010-08-17T04:20Z,good attempt atleast
,abhinav.atul,2010-08-17T06:25Z,"Hey, Blu-Ray doesn't come till 14th September. Stop packaging DVD stuff in Blu ray category."
,greensmoke1313,2010-08-17T07:05Z,"i understand we shud be grateful for free shit, and it wud be fine if it was labeled as a shit copy but why call it bluray rip? this wud be shitty vhs quality. Not cool"
,scalpar,2010-08-17T13:34Z,"you can rate torrents! ever seen the +/- thingy top right where it says ""quality""?"
,Ghost_of_Sosaria,2010-08-17T15:52Z,Audio goes off 45 seconds into the movie :(
,720plover,2010-08-17T18:47Z,"I know its free

No way this is bluray. "
,M4JOR,2010-08-17T18:54Z,Just sat down to watch this after work and the audio mutes after so many minutes waste of bandwidth!

,-Leto-,2010-08-18T08:24Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS, IT'S A FAKE.
I just finished dowloading this, picture quality is really bad. It can't be a Bluray rip, picture is really too blurry. There's also something wrong with aspect ratio."
