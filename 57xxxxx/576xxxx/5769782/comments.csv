You had made such good progress thanks to the harrassment of knockX2 and now you are gonna pull this relabeling shit again??? WTF is wrong with you???

Just give credit to the original rippers like you have been doing recently."
,dlha29,2010-08-20T08:44Z,"i do not know what happened but shortly after I started downloading this file, my computer became over ran with a whole bunch of viruses. Since this file was the only thing I was downloading at the time, I have to assume that it was the cause. I really hope there was nothing attached to it. I have never had this problem before with anyone registered with this site. You might want to check the file just to make sure. :) But it did download fast. I just couldn't check the quality of it."
,punk420,2010-08-20T16:01Z,hope it's better than twilight....
,XoLWoX,2010-08-20T18:21Z,None Of My Torrents Have Virus must be your computer already had a virus
,punk420,2010-08-20T19:47Z,"no virus, no fakes..."
,punk420,2010-08-20T19:54Z,"this movie is disgusting....
don't waste ur time, otherwise credit to the uploader..."
,some-young-guy,2010-08-22T13:36Z,"I once contracted viruses from TPB while surfing with Internet Exporer.  After resurrecting this machine a friend suggested using Firefox with NoScript which blocks out most unwanted and untrusted scripts from loading while surfing on TPB.  I suggest changing browsers unless DBANing your hard drive and reinstalling every program sounds like a great time.  Once you change to Firefox, click;

Tools/Add-ons and search for NoScript and enable it.  Then come back to TPB and on the bottom/right of your browser click the ""Options"" tab and allow ThePirateBay and you'll have no more problems."
,NIN13,2010-08-22T23:18Z,K IDK if anyone else had this problem. When I play it there is no talking just music. Did this happen to anyone else?
,gastonfouche,2010-08-28T08:51Z,"some-young-guy.
the torrent isnt the problem, over the past few months Ive noticed a lot of the Ads have viruses built in.. so it really depends on the ads on your screen not the torrent your downloading.

secondly, all browsers allow you to turn off scripts (not just FF). but by doing so you miss out on a lot of functionality on most websites.

the best way to avoid viruses is to install anti-virus software.. the best free one i have found is AVGFREE.. ou can download at avgfree.com it blocks all the lil buggers for me. :)"
,omega45,2010-08-28T11:16Z,"I agree with gastonfouche, I am finding virus's in the ads that are attached to Pirate bay site.....My computer always alerts me of them.
And thanks for the upload, it is fantastic......you are the best!!! Thanks again...."
,bychance,2010-08-31T01:51Z,"mkiller, there is a reason  XoLWoX has a pink skull. It means that his uploads are clean.
 Now I will say that my anti-virus program has detected trojans and malware several times
 lately when I click on different T.P.B. pages. but thankfully Avast cought them in time. It
 makes me wonder If anti-P2P agents are at work with the advertisers."
,mkiller,2010-08-31T23:38Z,so tell me if it is clean why the hell when i got 11% like most of the times when it happens its at 10-15% and a nice fake antivirus(this time was something worse) self installs... and yes my antivirus got it in time too but still its stupid AND tell me if it is clean can u plz explain me why his upload is from 17/08? when the movie only came out 18/08??? explain that to me plz 
,mkiller,2010-08-31T23:41Z,oh not to meantion i ve pop -up blocker and i never install the add ons on any website my antivirus blocks them all only when i downloaded this torrent i got a really big torjan this time i was suprised i tought it was antimalware doctor but it wasnt dont even know the name of that shit must be new or something
,phyregdss,2010-09-01T01:54Z,"Vampires Suck was leaked about 3 months before it ever hit the screens. Perhaps this is why the movies date is before the release. There were over 100k downloads of it before it was yanked from whatever site got it. Maybe it wasn't yanked, all I know is that G4 did a short bit on it in their FEED 2 weeks before it was released. "
,physixmaster,2010-10-11T00:37Z,"Rule one of having a virus is..... ITS NOT A VIRUS.
They don't exist in the modern age its malicious software/trojans etc etc none of which can be executed properly in a video player unless you haven't kept your video player up to date or it has serious vulnerabilities, or the codecs you downloaded were dodgy. Just FYI a Virus is a self replicating executable line of code inside a seemingly legit application that spreads, hence its name. Due to the complexities of a modern Windows installation (the OS most bad things run on) its near impossible for a virus to run and even if did what purpose would it serve? Crashing a computer is the last thing a ""hacker"" 'and I use that term loosly' would want to do. Access to the information is what they want and no one wants the info on your personal computer because, in short, no-one cares and its useless. "
