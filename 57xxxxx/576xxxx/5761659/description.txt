thanks Flotzilla !!!!!!!!!!!!
covers included

yes, this is the version WITHOUT OVERDUBS
do you think they did overdubs only in the Rock in Rio cd ?
just for starters, listen to the track "08 The Evil That Man Do", at 1:19 ... Bruce f***s up the lyrics ...
there are other overdubs, but you can find it for yourself, HAVE FUN !!!

the recording of this bootleg is very good, probably taken fro FM Broadcast
