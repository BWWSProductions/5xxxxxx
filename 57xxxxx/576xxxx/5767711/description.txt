SYNOPSIS: The backstabbing criminals in the shadowy underworld of Jean-Pierre Melvilleï¿½â‚¬â„¢s Le doulos have only one guiding principle: ï¿½â‚¬Å“Lie or die.ï¿½â‚¬Â A stone-faced Jean-Paul Belmondo stars as enigmatic gangster Silien, who may or may not be responsible for squealing on Faugel (Serge Reggiani), just released from the slammer and already involved in what should have been a simple heist. By the end of this brutal, twisting, and multilayered policier, who will be left to trust? Shot and edited with Melvilleï¿½â‚¬â„¢s trademark cool and featuring masterfully stylized dialogue and performances, Le doulos (slang for \"informant\") is one of the filmmakerï¿½â‚¬â„¢s most gripping crime dramas.
