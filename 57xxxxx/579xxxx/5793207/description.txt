Y-y-yes Sir, I sure have. A-a-after allâ€¦Sir? You hadnâ€™t heard from me in quite a while so you thought youâ€™d better just go ahead and call, huh? W-w-well, Lord, I tell ya, well just last nightâ€¦this same time last night, Iâ€™s a planninâ€™ on talkinâ€™ ta you. I-I was a layinâ€™ there watchinâ€™ that olâ€™ television, that olâ€™ Jay Leno ya know was on the TV. I said to my wife, I said â€˜Hon, ya know as soon as olâ€™ Jay gets off the television we oughta get on our knees and talk to the Lord.â€™ Thatâ€™s what we said. And I wish to goodness weâ€™d a gone ahead and done it, but we didnâ€™t. But I tell ya Lord what Iâ€™m gonna doâ€¦Iâ€™m gonna start doing that. I sure am. Iâ€™m gonna say my prayers tonightâ€¦whether I need to or not. Yes Sir. Sir? Yes Sir, I go to church. Yes Sir, every Sundayâ€¦Iâ€™m a faithful church member. I sure am. Sir? Did I go last Sunday? Yes Sir, I went last Sunday. I went for morninâ€™ preachinâ€™â€¦wonderful church. Sir? W-what did the preacher preach on? Wellâ€¦uh, you know how the preacher is, donâ€™t ya? He preaches on the platform. Oh! Y-yeah, I understand. W-well h-he taught mostly about the Bible. Sir? Oh! W-well he referred toâ€¦h-h-he talked about M-m-matthew you knowâ€¦no, no I donâ€™t believe it was Matthewâ€¦I-I-I believe it was Mark. Noâ€¦no, that was a couple of months agoâ€¦uh uh, now letâ€™s see. Now I remember it was uhâ€¦Sir? Sunday night? No. No, Lord I didnâ€™t make it Sunday night, Lord. I-Iâ€¦Sir? Uhâ€¦Bonanza. Yes, Sirâ€¦w-well Sir, ya know, I would have gone. I was a planninâ€™ on goinâ€™. But I got ta sittinâ€™ around on Sunday afternoon a thinkinâ€™, and I said to myself, you the next dayâ€™s Monday andâ€¦Sir? Yes Sir itâ€™s been that way a long time I reckon. But I got thinkinâ€™ that I need my rest. And Lord itâ€™s so cotton-pickinâ€™ hard anymore to go to church on Sunday all day and, and night, and then have to get up the next morninâ€™ and w-wellâ€¦Sir? Sunday before last? Well, Lord ya know, you just picked on a couple of bad ones here. But you know, I work so hard all week and Sunday before last was such a pretty day and everythingâ€¦and I didnâ€™t go to church, Lord. I tell ya, I went out andâ€¦Sir? Oh you know where I went, huh? Yes Sir, I caught two bass and one croppy. Sir? What time did I get home that nightâ€¦from fishinâ€™ ya mean? Wellâ€¦it was about 10:30 that night. Yes Sir, it was probably a lot later than if Iâ€™d gone to church that nightâ€¦but fishinâ€™ is different!â€¦It ainâ€™t church. Well, I couldnâ€™t a gone to church noways cause my wife was a home sick and somebody woulda had to stay with her. Sir? Lord, yes Sir Lord! Iâ€™m so glad you asked that question! Yes Sir, Lord, Iâ€™m a good steward. Yes Sir, I sure am! Youâ€™re talkinâ€™ about stewardâ€¦you mean tithinâ€™ and givinâ€™ to the church and all? Yes Sir, yes Sir I give to the church. I sure do. I give to the church every Sunday. Sir? Yes, Sirâ€¦every Sunday that I go. I gave 58 dollars to the church last year. I sure did. Cause after allâ€¦Sir? What do you mean you donâ€™t think I understand what stewardship means? Ten percent?â€¦Of everything that I own belongs to you? Well yes Sir Lord, I-I know about that, but I tell ya, right now you just kinda called at a bad time. You just picked a bad timeâ€¦weâ€™re in a recession down here ya knowâ€¦and the thing done turned into a depression for meâ€¦and and I just canâ€™t give any more, Lord, than that right now and andâ€¦Sir? Ten percent. Wellâ€¦I gave that fif-fif-fif, well that money ya see last year. And after all thatâ€™s a little more than a dollar a week you knowâ€¦Sir? How much do I make? Youâ€™re talkinâ€™ about money still? W-well, it was a little over ten thousand dollars. That donâ€™t tally out too good, does it Lord? W-well, now now I-I know that and ya know, and I told ya before and and as soon as I get that boat motor paid for, ya know I just got the thing and and you know my wife? I thought ya might. Well Lord, she can just walk across the floor and fall on somethinâ€™ ya know. She did that the other dayâ€¦broke her hip bone. Y-y-yesâ€¦ten percent. Y-yeah Lord, but if I donâ€™t pay off, pay off this boat and motor, theyâ€™ll come and get itâ€¦ and then I wonâ€™t have one. Sir? You think if I donâ€™t start paying my tithe, I ainâ€™t gonna need no boat and motor down here? Yes Sirâ€¦that was cleared upâ€¦completely clear. It sure was. Sir? Around my kids? Influence, ya mean? Well yes. Iâ€™m a good Christian in front of the kids. Lord, never do we do anything in this here house or say anything that be wrong in front of our children. No Sirâ€¦not a word. I donâ€™t believe in it. And thatâ€™sâ€¦Sir? What did I say when I got my thumb caught in the linen closet? You heard about that? Wellâ€¦I was just standinâ€™ there, Lord, you know, and all of a sudden this door here come out from nowhere, and and my thumb was in the way, and and it hurt so bad, and and it was awful and I saidâ€¦well Lord, heh heh, never mind what I said. Butâ€¦Sir? Praise? Yes Sir, I give praise. Yes Sir, I sure do. Iâ€™s a readinâ€™ the Bible the other dayâ€¦I picked it up and it said in Theesaleenians to give the Lord the praise. I sure did. But I tell ya Lord, it was just a little hard to find a place to give the praise when I got my thumb caught in the closet door. Sir? Yes Sir, I sure do. I love that preacher! Heâ€™s a wonderful man! Thatâ€™s the preachenist dude Iâ€™ve ever seen. I-I love him. I sure do. Sir? If heâ€™s such a wonderful preacher then why donâ€™t I start doing more of what he says? Well, Lord, I-I thought I did pretty much what he says already. Sir? If Iâ€™m doing all he says, he must not say a whole lot, huh? Well, Lord, maybe you shouldâ€™ve called him instead of me. Heh, heh. Oh well, that was just a thought anyway, Lord. Sir? Yes, I know that Lord. I know that and youâ€™re right. You sure are. This is one of the very few countries that weâ€™ve got that we can work in You without violating those man-made laws. Yes Sir and I-Iâ€¦Sir? Yes Sir, I realize that you must love us dearly and giving your Son to die on the cross, Lord, you know. And I do appreciate itâ€¦I sure do. This phone call has meant a lot to me. Sir? Oh, you gotta go now? Well now I tell ya Lord, I appreciate ya callinâ€™, and and thanks for reminding me and all, and Iâ€™m gonna start doing better. I-I think I need toâ€¦Sir? You think I need to, too huh? Well I am. Iâ€™m gonna rededicate my life right now, Lord. I sure am. And Iâ€™m gonna start tithing my tithe, my ten percent, and paying my debts Lord, and Iâ€¦yes Sir and Iâ€™m gonna go to church on Sundayâ€¦and Sunday morning worship preachingâ€¦and every time Lord they have church, Iâ€™m gonna be there Lord and take an active part in it. Sir? Yes Sir and pray for othersâ€¦just like theyâ€™ve been praying for me. Yes, Sir Lord. Now now you know how dependable that I am, and Lord you can depend on me for doing that. Heh, heh. OK Lord, and thank you, I thank you so much for callinâ€™, hear? Good bye, now. Whatâ€™s that dear? Who was it on the telephone? Never mind. You wouldnâ€™t believe me if I told you who it was. Was it the wrong number? Well no, it wasnâ€™t the wrong number. Believe me, the man has my number. In fact I think he probably has a lot of peopleâ€™s numbers. But I tell you one thing, the next time the phone rings, you can answer it. You needed it a whole lot worse than I did.
