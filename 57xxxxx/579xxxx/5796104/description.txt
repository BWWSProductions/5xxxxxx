Peter and Gordon were a British Invasion-era performing duo, formed by Peter Asher and Gordon Waller, that rocketed to fame in 1964 with "A World Without Love" and had several subsequent hits in that era.
Peter Asher's sister, actress Jane Asher, was dating The Beatles' Paul McCartney, so Peter and Gordon recorded several songs solely written by McCartney, but credited, as most compositions by either were at the time, to Lennon/McCartney. Those hits included "A World Without Love" (U.S. #1), "Nobody I Know", "I Don't Want To See You Again", and "Woman". "Woman" is credited to "Bernard Webb"; McCartney used this pseudonym to see if he could have a hit song even without his famous name attached to it. The song reached number 14 in the US and number 28 on the British charts.
