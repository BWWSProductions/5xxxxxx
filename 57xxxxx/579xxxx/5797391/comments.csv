You might want to start and cleanup the free space of the partition you store the partial downloaded files lol !!

It has something to do whit the way you delete your files (unsecured lol) !!

,monitg,2010-09-10T07:59Z,Is nero best to write this torrent to a DVD. I want to run this on a standalone dvd player...
,koolie,2010-10-11T09:16Z,"monitg: Yes, use Nero and select DVD video from the choices on the left (or first screen) then drag the Video_TS contents into the Video_TS folder.
Nothing goes in the Audio_TS folder.

gotmib: see above. There shouldn't be any audio files. These VOB IFO BUP files are your video audio infomation and backup files in DVD format. The audio is slipstreamed in these files, so again, nothing goes into the audio folder. If you are not getting audio while trying to run this (not from a DVD) on your computer, then either a) turn speakers up :D   (or/and)
b) download the latest audio codecs. That sounds like your problem....not this torrent. :)"
,Jasonofcompsci,2010-10-24T04:04Z,That's crazy.  4 Gigs.
,puchtomos,2010-10-27T08:17Z,can you upload some screens??
,Warshark73,2010-11-04T05:47Z,"@Jasonofcompsci:

Yes, this is a rip of DVD files intended to be burned to DVD in order to play in a DVD player; not meant to be watched on VLC / MPCStar / WMPlayer / etc. Almost all torrents created for this purpose are around 4.35 GB in total size."
,BigJRM,2010-11-07T02:32Z,"Downloaded it yesterday, watched it today. Great upload. I checked it on my computer with DVDXplayer to make sure it qould work, burned it to a dvd with PowerISO and then watched it on our TV. many THANKS for a GREAT upload."
,rob1961,2010-11-09T21:51Z,Is there a version of this that is English and not Russian?
,DarkWolfDK,2010-12-07T12:05Z,"Hi Sailo.
Thx for the upload!

one thing i dont get is why you mood or custom the sounds/subs?

Is it for getting better quality or making it available in more languages?

What should i call a file when i copy it from a retail dvd and dont modify it?

I want the real DVD features and originals even if its not in my own language.
Could we start out using retail DVD rip so that people know its a retail and not a modified DVD?"
