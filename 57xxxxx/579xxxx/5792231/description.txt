A remix/mashup/megamix I did with two songs from two of my favorite currently-active musicians. :P

Artist: DJ Royal [Yeah, I do figure there are others who also use that name]
Album: Bad Internet Romances (Are Not Real Romances)
Date: 2010
Genre: Mashup


(A Scholar and A Physician produced the Lars song, as well as providing some vocals. Piney Gir simply provided guest vocals on the Lars song, with some of their lines also used here)

I'd been a fan of MC Lars' music since late spring of 2009; however, that interest was kicked into high gear when I saw Lars live in early December of that year. Gaga, in recorded form, followed only a few weeks later. Affecting me so heavily in such quick succession, I felt I had to combine the two. In general, the idea here was to combine two of my latter-day favorites, however distinct they are.

The concept of Gaga's lines about bad romances seemed to integrate well with Lars' Internet-specific examples, so I ran with it. The original project idea called for a simple combined lyricsheet; I somehow decided to actually implement it sonically. Thus it begins. (This was the first mashup I was inspired to make, even though it was the third that got put onand ThePirateBay)
