Before they founded Nelvana animation studios, three young men created the definitive primer on the Canadian whites, that short period of time when Canada had national superheroes.
And what a roster of superheroes! The parapalegic spy Major Domo, the Inuit Goddess Nelvana, the underwater nazi-hunter Iron Man, all-Canadian action hero Johnny Canuck, and many more.

This book features never before seen black and white artwork from the original comics, as well as very rare colour pages.

A must have for fans of comics and Canadiana
