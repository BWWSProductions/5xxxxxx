@acaca 

Lower the video settings, special effects etc. I didn't have any problems with this game. Some lags, but nothing serious. Save often, as these games can crash sometimes."

Seems like you need to turn on the subtitles. From options.....:)"

I've tried just playing anyway, but there are so many images and textures missing and the game goes to a black screen and won't progress when I try to start the first conversation."
