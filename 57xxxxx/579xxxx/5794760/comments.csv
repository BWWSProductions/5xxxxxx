,Immortal.darkness,2010-08-30T17:20Z,"Hey Riddlera THE EXPENDABLES R5 is out and there is 720p upscaled version is also available...
Can you pls do that before your tv shows..
Thanks mate"
,Ryaar,2010-08-30T20:48Z,"there are 3 dark knight exceelent prints available :

1.By RiddlerA
2.By MicroStar(KickAss)
3.By Scorp

all 3 of them are nearly 1gb

but the best that i think is of Scorp's thats the 3rd one...coz it is 1080p and res  1920*1080
i.e. far superior to the other two..
go here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5641063/The_Dark_Knight_BRRip_m1080p_[2008]_[Eng]1920x1080-1GB

,Steven633,2010-12-31T19:01Z,"Excellent A/V, but how do I get rid of the Subs? 

Ive tried deleting the .srt files, but there still there?? Am I missing out something here? 

I downloaded Once Upon A Time In Mexico.mkv the other day, it had subtitles that I also could not get rid of??"
,farcry2,2011-01-18T07:26Z,"thanx..........
can u upload batman movies of 1992 , 95 and 97....ie Batman Returns , forever and robin"
,technosailor,2011-06-10T06:24Z,"I'm greatful for this movie, I just simply love the new batman movies and the quality is theater quality, but it can be improved, I usggest the following:
Audio: HE-AACv2 (SBR+PS, yours is SBR only) AAC 6CH 64Khz Kbps
Video: MPEG4 H.264 not AVC, H.264 compresses a little better with a litle better higher quality.

Please can you get the 'Director's Cut' version or this is the one?

The movies of 1992 , 95 and 97 are crap (ridiculous fantasy) compared to the new movies, which are realistic."

,Vantek,2011-07-24T19:28Z,"Riddler you are simply amazing. Absolutely size-effectiveness, the less impressive movies in minute size and decent quality, the visual masterpieces (like this one) in bigger size and perfect quality, always exactly the way I wish for! "
,vab63vab,2011-08-11T05:01Z,"awesome print.....
@steven633 - if you are using vlc, just right click on the video, go to videos submenu, then on subtitles and disable it...."
,coooldude,2012-01-08T18:00Z,"AWESOME PRINT...
THANXXX... FOR THE SAME.."
