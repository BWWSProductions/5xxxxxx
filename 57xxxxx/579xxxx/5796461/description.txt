New York City's love affair with the Allman Brothers Band dates back to the time

of the old Fillmore East. Now, in what has become a rite of spring, the band pulls 

into town every March for an extended string of shows. To the fans who flock into 

Manhattan each year from all over the country, these shows are known simply as

"The Beacon Run".

After an Allman Brothers Band show at the Beacon, you come away redeemed, happy 

down to the bone. You walk out into the cool night, and a little piece of that time

less magic sticks with you. At its core, this is a blues band, and the redemptive

powerof the blues is in the way they can transform universal pain into white light

and pure joy. And no one does this as well as the Brothers.
