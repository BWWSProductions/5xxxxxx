[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Piranha.3D

Where to start :hmmm: well lots of work went into this so will go through the sources first ....
Well as most of you now already now the Demedic release was actually cam not line audio.....hence the tag on this release.
Video wise it was not too bad,some weird colouring throughout eg strong on green and red,then it changed to strong yellow etc also
it was really heavy on the chroma,had a slight angle and black borders at angles aswell.Also needed the ivtc fixing along with the 
other normal stuff.
Oh and also the first 5mins 37secs are missing on it ;-)
Audio was half decent cam on it.......better than normal and you could/can hear whats being said fine.

Right the russian source.....the video on this is blurred due to the 3D effect and also suffers from the same colour changing as Demedic
release....guessing thats because of the 3D ;-)
This release was also over cropped compare to Demedic release but quit alot,special at the bottom.
Audio ,well it was russian so ......

Now onto work done,first thing was to find the join on the two videos so we could cut them and join them together (at a later stage).
Then it was a case of filtering the videos,first we did the Demedic one as it was our main body of the film.
For this we used a quad filter first to allow us to crop freehand,so we could crop at any angle allowing us to keep all the video.
Then it was a case of doing a script to change all the colouring to try and make them more natural and also lower how strong they were.
Also used a smoother,sharpeness,ivtc,brightness,contrast,deblocker and resize aswell in the script.
We also slightly filtered the audio in adobe audition,changing the EQ.
Now the for the russian video ....we used more or less the same script,but changed the values slightly as needed.Also we had to resize the video
on this to match the video res on the other video so we could append them together.

Now  that only left the russian video needing audio.....for this we used our line audio,we just basically needed syncing.And once done we muxed it to
the cam audio and save as 1 file and then re-encoded it,so there should be no oos issue in convert x ,if you convert it :P
Only reason we didn't use the line for the whole film is because it had too many problems :( 

Well that cover everything i think so enjoy :)
