One of Alfred Hitchcock's few outright comedies, Mr. & Mrs. Smith  arrives on DVD with a standard full-frame transfer that preserves the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1. The English soundtrack is rendered in Dolby Digital Mono. English, Spanish, and French subtitles are accessible. Supplemental materials include the theatrical trailer and a documentary about the film's production. This fine disc is also available as part of the nine-disc Alfred Hitchcock: The Signature Collection.
