On Saturday, 28 August 2010, several musicians from around the world each wrote and recorded a song. These songs were completely conceived and finished on that day with no pre-planning, save for marking that date on the calendar. 

The next day, all the songs were collected and put together as an album. 

On Monday, 30 August 2010, the album was released as a free download by BFW recordings.

Music from Pyotr, Alex Gloworld, Anthing, Ketsa, Elpixa, Oneiro, i AM esper, Bing Satellites, Rogue Spore, SineRider, Chris Fordham, False Awakening and Phillip Wilkerson.

A chilled mix of ambient, shoegaze, IDM, drone and much more.

A beautiful album.
