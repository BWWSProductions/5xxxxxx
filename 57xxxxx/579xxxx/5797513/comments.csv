Thanks for all the uploads, but i must disagree in the 21st century thing, there are still many thousands of us that would like the race as divx as many of us watch them on our dvd players, and many like my self cant play mp4 on my dvd player, and thus forces me to watch it on my pc. :-( i have this big tv and no way to watch F1 :-("
