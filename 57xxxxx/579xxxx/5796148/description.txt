Plot:

 
Barney Ross leads the "Expendables", a band of highly skilled mercenaries including knife enthusiast Lee Christmas, martial arts expert Yin Yang, heavy weapons specialist Hale Caesar, demolitionist Toll Road and loose-cannon sniper Gunner Jensen. When the group is commissioned by the mysterious Mr. Church to assassinate the merciless dictator of a small South American island, Barney and Lee head to the remote locale to scout out their opposition. Once there, they meet with local rebel Sandra and discover the true nature of the conflict engulfing the city. When they escape the island and Sandra stays behind, Ross must choose to either walk away and save his own life - or attempt a suicidal rescue mission that might just save his soul.

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..... The Expendables

Here we are with a nice R5 this time. Right first off we we're sent these 
files this morning and have been working on a few other projects so sorry 
for the delay on getting this out. 
Work done on this one was we made some subs and hardcoded them for all non english parts....
Then we made it brighter,lowered the chroma,slight change in rgb colours,white balance,sharpen,crop and resize.
Audio is from the DVDSCR that was released by iND and about 30 seconds from the R5 beginning to make it full audio
as the iND release was missing audio for that part.

Enjoy folks
