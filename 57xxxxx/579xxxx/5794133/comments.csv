,helldant,2010-08-30T21:22Z,"@cotter22 it's a bdrib just that the quallity is lowend so it would fit on 700disc, a bdrip on 700 is better quality than a dvdrip on 700"

When playing through USB on my plasma, sound is well fucked up."
,Jack_Raiden,2010-09-03T12:27Z,"What has ViSiON done to themselves? They even tried to (insanely) overcompress 5.1 AC3 audio at *192 Kbps* (32 Kbps/ch!). Wow.

This is the biggest load of fail I've ever seen from ViSiON, I didn't even believe it was from them. They are lost. I guess the writing was on the wall, though, with all their horribly over-sharpened /contrasted /saturated releases.

There are still quite a few good release groups out there. SANTi comes to mind, or FLAWL3SS. And many individuals who know what they're doing as well."
