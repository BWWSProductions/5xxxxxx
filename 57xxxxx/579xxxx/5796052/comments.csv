,moleksajr,2010-08-29T05:39Z,"This is the absolute best copy out to date. Although I just noticed a larger R5 AC3 version that got uploaded while I downloaded this. 

Great work as always TvTeam. I DL a lot of TV shows from you as well. Thank you for your time and efforts"
,moleksajr,2010-08-29T05:59Z,"As for those that come in and check things out and rely on others comments on a brand new torrent. DOWNLOAD IT AND CHECK FOR YOURSELVES, THEN SEED!!!!!

You're probably the same leechers that don't even bother to upload back what you downloaded. With new torrents it is a big deal to get them established."
