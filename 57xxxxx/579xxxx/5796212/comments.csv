,PhilLesh12,2010-08-29T06:31Z,"why did you guys mislabel the torrent linked below?

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5696704/Kate.Plus.8.S01E03.HDTV.XviD-CRiMSON

It claims to be episode 3, but the files in the torrent are clearly labeled episode 1.

What's up with that?  I have a hard byte limit and get charged extra when I go over.  5gb a month.  

Thanks for costing me about twenty dollars more this month!"
,ToneZone,2010-09-10T08:18Z,You clearly downloaded it even seeing that it was the wrong episode.  Take your whining to THAT torrent and NOTICE what you're downloading before bitching.
