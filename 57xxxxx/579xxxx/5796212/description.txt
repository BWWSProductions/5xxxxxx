         The suburban house of two young cousins is filled with        
         scary encounters after a demonic ceramic giraffe is brought   
         into their home. The Heritage Park Museum of the first        
         Mormon settlement in Utah is haunted by the disembodied       
         presence of a young boy. Mobsters who were gunned down in     
         the 1930's haunt the employees and patrons of a gentlemen's   
         club. An innkeeper from the 1800's inflicts the pain of his   
         brutal murder on an unsuspecting guest. A woman is shocked    
         by the ghostly words written on her bathroom mirror by        
         the spirit of a Revolutionary War captain who has followed    
         her home. And then an elderly couple comes to grips with      
          the fact that they don't live alone in their home.
