IMAGiNE NOTES
SOURCES:
VIDEO: The Expendables DVD9 R5.... A Good Friend Thanks Mate :)
AUDIO: The Expendables DVDR 2010-iND & about 30 seconds from the R5 to fill the gap :)

Here we are with a nice R5 this time. Right first off we we're sent these files this morning and have been working on a few other projects so sorry for the delay on getting this out. Work done on this one was we made some subs and hardcoded them for all non english parts.... Then we made it brighter, lowered the chroma, slight change in rgb colours, white balance, sharpen,crop and resize. Audio is from the DVDSCR that was released by iND and about 30 seconds from the R5 beginning to make it full audio as the iND release was missing audio for that part.

UPLOADER NOTES
IF YOU ARE DECIDING BETWEEN IMAGiNE & ViSiON R5...THE DIFFERENCE IS IMAGiNE IS HARDCODE SUBS, RESOLUTION & ViSiON VIDEO SEEMS MORE SMOOTH...AUDIO SHOULD BE THE SAME...PLEASE COMMENT :)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
