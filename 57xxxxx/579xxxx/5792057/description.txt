The Navy has OKâ€™d a reality television show about the military bomb squads  risking their lives defusing explosive devices. Well thatâ€™s one way to make those â€œIce Road Truckersâ€ and crab fishermen look like wusses. The show is called â€œBomb Patrol: Afghanistan.â€ I guess it sounds better than â€œI Enlisted for the College Tuition, Get Me Out of Here!â€ The show will be on the G4 Network. The problem of course is that this could easily be handled in a tasteless and exploitative manner, or as TV networks call it â€œbusiness as usual.â€ The first indications from the G4 Network donâ€™t look good. Their promo material stresses that the soldiersâ€™ patrols â€œcould put an EOD tech wearing a 70-pound protective bomb suit in direct contact with a potentially deadly IED.â€ At least theyâ€™re not calling the show â€œSurvivor: Kandahar.â€ The problem is that theyâ€™re teasing it with the possibility that some of those involved may not survive. This is an abomination. Why donâ€™t they just call this show â€œPimp My Militaryâ€? Besides, if I want to see an explosion on reality TV, Iâ€™ll just watch Teresa on The Real Housewives of New Jersey.

Reality can be ugly, especially when it involves Glenn Beck. This weekend is Glenn Beckâ€™s big â€œRestoring Honorâ€ rally. Glenn Beck restoring honor? Thatâ€™s like using Mel Gibson to restore civility. Beck is taking over the Lincoln Memorial on the 47th anniversary of Martin Luther Kingâ€™s â€œI have a dreamâ€ speech there. If Martin Luther King were still around, this would make him wake up screaming. The rally headliners are Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin. Itâ€™s kind of like a Woodstock for conservatives, but Iâ€™m sure this one will feature a lot more mud. As far as Iâ€™m concerned, the mere presence of Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin at the Lincoln Memorial qualifies as vandalism to a national monument.  Glenn Beck says â€œwe will reclaim the civil rights movementâ€¦.â€ Reclaim? I didnâ€™t know conservatives claimed it in the first place. Is that what you were doing with the water cannons and police dogs? Glenn Beck is completely rewriting history for the sake of a bunch of old peopleâ€”the kind of people who didnâ€™t like that history back when they were forced to live it. These are people who spent their lives hating the legacy of the Civil Rights movement. Now Glenn Beck is telling them they donâ€™t have to hate itâ€”they can co-opt and distort it. The bottom line is clear: Glenn Beck comes not to praise the Civil Rights movement, but to bury it.
