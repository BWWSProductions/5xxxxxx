Hong Kong's new long haul carrier becomes the 189th airline in the World Air Routes series.
In the cockpit of the B747-400 you will fly the airline's maiden route from Hong Kong to London and back.

After a company presentation by the CEO, Flight Ops and Ground Ops Managers you'll descend from the mountain to CLK Airport in the cable car for some amazing views of the Airport. We then meet the crew who brief us on the flight are ready for takeoff in the cockpit of the 747-400.

Both Captains give a very extensive presentation of the aircraft, the route, the operation and many other details pertaining to the airline and last, but certainly not least, we take to the sky for the first ever air to air footage of a 747 over the English coast!

Enjoy, and again REQ either Air Canada 777 or Iberia A346
