,kght22,2010-08-29T10:56Z,"looks like it is working, please be patient i don't have the fastest upload speed in the world, i hope in a day or two we can get a few more established seeders"
,kght22,2010-08-31T18:49Z,"raised my upload to 100kbps, might not sustain it indefinately, but will for now.  the torrent is approaching 2.0 available. please don't drop out, every bit that goes out and comes back in counts, i've uploaded 17.5 gig so far myself, and will continue uploading for some time to come (i want to see this torrent established) i also must apologize to the origional uploaders of these files for not including their txt files, i did keep your names in tact on the videos, and if someone is curious about who it is they can find out. as my uploading name states: i didn't do it"
,kght22,2010-09-06T00:22Z,"glad to see that this torrent seems to be established, DO NOT thank me, thank those who's names are on the videos in this link; they are the heroes. i apologize to anyone who is annoyed by my use of their uploads to make this torrent, i only wanted to give back a season of my favorite show in a package"
,bleedndie,2010-09-16T15:08Z,seed plz am keen on this already uploaded twice as much as ive downloaded
,kght22,2010-09-22T04:36Z,"seeds please give up some more bandwidth, there are over 100 of you and my download speed is under 100kb, i uploaded this in the hopes that it would be available in a decent ammount of time later. bleed's request was compleatly reasonable seeders please seed, there are lots of you, and i allready spent my time and bandwidth uploading it"
,kght22,2010-09-22T04:40Z,"i'll say this once on this package, 50kbps up from everyone here will be more than enough to make down nice and fast, and more up is always better."
,MastemaJack,2010-09-27T05:38Z,This is not the full season. The last episode is suppose to air in November.
,zerokiller13,2010-10-02T22:55Z,"Jack is right, the rest of the season will be completed on 11/11-12/16 up to episode 16. im just estimating. love the show. keep on seeding."
,kght22,2010-10-17T06:04Z,"i wasnt aware that that was a continuation of season 4, i thought it was supposed to be the start of season 5, when the rest of season 4 is completed i'll upload a second part for this and upload an updated version with all episodes"
,disgorge6667,2010-10-19T12:32Z,What program do i play it on? Windows media?
,xShoot4WarAmpsx,2010-11-01T03:34Z,When I play some 720P MKV files on my computer the video always plays in slow mo does anyone know how to fix this?
,kght22,2010-12-03T22:39Z,"use media player classic if you have problems playing it, although i'm not sure if you can enable 5.1 output on media player classic (i dont use it) but i do know that these will play on media player classic without downloading anything else, and if you have any problem playing them on media player classic you can only blame your own computer."
,kght22,2010-12-22T23:12Z,"i will be uploading the rest of season 4 under my (ididntdoit) tag soon, once that is seeded; i will start a full upload of season 4 with all the episodes in one download. they will all be 720p of cource, although on the later episodes i now lack the ability to tell if the sound is properly encoded, but its just a few episodes and my bet is that its right."
,kght22,2011-06-25T00:23Z,"well, i didnt do it, drop this torrent and seed the full season 4 torrent"
