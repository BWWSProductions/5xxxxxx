,hypno777,2010-09-26T07:54Z,Can someone please help and give detailed instructions on how to install this on PS3 (v.3.50)
,6oxtynin9,2010-09-26T23:01Z,"Don't bother with this torrent, will not work on PS3. Not properly ripped, missing the BIN file (THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE). Again, THIS WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR PS3. Don't waste your time. This is 10 and a half GB of BULLSHIT."
,dr4v3n,2011-02-02T06:06Z,"No new comments? Guess I will dload and try to get working. last comment said no bin file, those are easy to get these days thanks to GH's CFW. Will post back if I can get it to work."
,gabriel816,2011-03-07T00:45Z,it didnt work for me.  i have a 120GB slim running Geohots CFW 3.55 and gaia manager
,MotorLund,2011-04-19T16:52Z,"No point in wasting time downloading this. The game doesnt work. Its either error 80010017 or the console will hang before loading the game.

Thank You for wasting my bandwidth."
,piratas34,2011-07-18T17:56Z,already updated to 1.05 version so if you dot have installed earlier updates in your ps3 it won't work
,Yargh!,2011-07-28T19:09Z,"This does work. Although you have to extract the ISO from the Rar and then extract the files and folders from the ISO. After all that I found my files ended with ;1 and because of that they would not show up. Delete all the ;1's from your pc or rename them in Multiman. It was kinda a pain and idk why I didnt download one of the other versions but when its all said and done, it works perfectly!"
,vidoes_r_ezy,2011-10-02T03:27Z,is it possible just to download a game and burn it onto a cd and play on a non-jailbroken PS3
