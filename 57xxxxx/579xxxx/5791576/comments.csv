Stop Making Sense is a live album, the first track is David Byrne playing ""Psycho Killer"" on an acoustic guitar using a boom box for the drum track.  The first track on this download is the studio version of ""Psycho Killer"" that is on Talking Heads: '77.  Many of the tracks are studio versions, but a few of them are live.  Bottom line is somebody looked at the tracklisting for Stop Making Sense, then pieced this torrent together from various studio/live albums and called it ""Stop Making Sense [Special Edition] (1999)"".
