,schranzx,2010-08-29T21:36Z,where is the seeder gone???stuck on 37.3%!!!!!!!!Come back i really want this!!!will seed forever!!!
,cena1991,2010-08-30T11:19Z,"here i am....but i can't seed all the time...so if it stucks,don't panic..."
,schranzx,2010-08-30T21:41Z,"ok so i installed the vst,but when i go to load it in my host(FL studio)a message pops up saying registry error please check to see if it is installed correctly,or something like that,any idea's??"
,cena1991,2010-09-02T12:50Z,"that never happened to me...i regularly installed VST and sound library...loaded sampletank in FL Studio,registered it,find a folder with library and it's working.."
,schranzx,2010-09-02T19:03Z,"its happening with Miroslav Philarmonik too,it loads in stand alone mode but it just dont work in fruityloops,would it have anything to do with a registry software programme that i have installed?just throwing thoughts out there."
,cena1991,2010-09-02T21:15Z,"I don't have any problems with Miroslav Philharmonik either...i think maybe you should re-install fruity loops,or maybe the whole Windows...i don't see any other solution"
,schranzx,2010-09-02T22:55Z,"really?s***,ive never had this problem before with any vst,ill just have to delete and pass on,thanks anyway man great upload,i seen on the standalone."

i'm doin' alright around 61.4%, but download speed kinda dwindles over time, again, cuz' there is not a big number of seeders. :O"

,Fipsycho,2012-03-16T13:22Z,"Ive installed it but I can't get a singe sound out of it. It sais : ""PART 1 : INSTRUMENT NOT FOUND"" every time I click to load a sound. I've tried to reset the root on preferences but it didn't work. I suspect it has something with authorization to do but when I installed it, it didn't ask for any authorization code :S If some one knows what I should do to make it work please share :(( really need this"
