Ripped from CD with Exact Audio Copy. Converted to LAME VBR Mono MP3 with dbPoweramp, quality setting -V6.

I have combined the stories into one large mp3 for ease of importing into iPods.

When imported just right-click the file in iTunes, select 'Get Info', Select the 'Options' tab, change the 'Media Kind' to Audiobook and tick the 'Remember playback position' box.

For playback on a PC I recommend foobar2000. Just right-click on the Cue-sheet, choose open with foobar & the player will open with each story listed as a separate index.

If you want to burn audio CDs, you can split the stories up losslessly with Medieval cue splitter.

The stories that are too long to fit on one CD have been indexed in two parts.
