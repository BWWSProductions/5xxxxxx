Anna Zilboorg is the kind of artist and craftswoman who comes along only rarely. Her previous book, Fancy Feet, integrated a unique color creativity with traditional fiber folk traditions of Turkey. In 45 Fine and Fanciful Hats to Knit, she presents nine basic hat shapes, from a fairly standard (but colorfully interpreted) beret to amazing geometric structures such as an onion dome and a six-pointed star (knitted in two layers). Enjoy breaking the constraints of knitting "normal" hats and set yourself free. For those who really want to follow directions, Zilboorg's charts are unusually clear and her directions are brief and uncomplicated.
