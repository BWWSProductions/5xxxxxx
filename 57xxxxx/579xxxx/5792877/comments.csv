What's the difference between this torrent and http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5796826/[RS]Acronis.True.Image.Home.2011.v14.0.0.Build.5105.Bootable.Res ?"
,principlemajor,2010-08-31T13:00Z,"Oh yeah nikita, I tried the Magnet link same day and it downloaded it to my C: drive and i had prefer to sue my slave drive for security reasons.
Anyway it was a nice upload. i tried it on one pc and backed up the system and sames the back up to a pc on the network. It went flawlessly.

Tell me the differentials and how it should be done.
If I make a full backup and maybe one or two weeks later I want to do a differential backup or lets say like backup only changes made since my last backup. If I am to restore the backup and still see my last changes I made when i did the incremental backup, how do i restore the backups?"
