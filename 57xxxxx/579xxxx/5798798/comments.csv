Useless torrent."
,SimpleSim0n,2011-02-14T23:31Z,"@sonofwill learn to read!

You are a moron and are too stupid to deserve a Mac or this game. The keygen worked perfectly!"
,te-zamen-is-kracht,2011-02-19T11:23Z,"nothing wrong with the key-gene... but...
No possibility to adjust it in the game.
After having started the game... There is NOWHERE within the game-menu to be able to register and place/add the serial.
So this way even a key-gene is useless. Lucky enough there are hundreds of card games available on the internet that have just as many card-game combinations included. 
But... If someone could be able to explain how to register the serial within the game... Well... Then this torrent and the following key-gene is useful."
