                         Land of Confusion - Disturbed



About The Artist

Disturbed is an American rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1996 when musicians Dan Donegan, Steve "Fuzz" Kmak, and Mike Wengren hired David Draiman as their singer. Since the band's formation, they have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, making them one of the largest grossing rock bands in recent years. The band has released three consecutive studio albums that have debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200.


Description

The most recent cover version was by American rock band Disturbed, from their third studio album, Ten Thousand Fists. The song became the fourth single from that album. Vocalist David Draiman commented that the aim of covering the song was, "taking a song that's absolutely nothing like us and making it our own."
It was accompanied by a music video animated by Todd McFarlane, known for his work with the Spawn comic book series and the creator of Spider-Man Anti-Hero Venom. McFarlane had previously animated the music videos for the songs "Freak on a Leash" by Korn and "Do the Evolution" by Pearl Jam. According to McFarlane, the music video is "a big view of the corporate world and how it all ties into just one big beast for me... The world is run by one giant thing, which is driven by greed and lust."


Plot

The video starts out with The Guy, Disturbed's mascot, falling to earth. It then shows military forces sporting a dollar sign within a circle of white that is within a field of red, followed by legions of black-clad soldiers reminiscent of Adolf Hitler's Schutzstaffel (Protection Squad), belonging to different countries. The video then shows The Guy, escaping bondage from chains, as the military forces continue to assault cities. Later on, leaders of various nations of the world are shown sitting at a table with the same dollar sign on it. Eventually The Guy confronts some soldiers, who sport patches with the dollar sign symbol, and stirs the people around the world to revolt and kill the soldiers, and then flags of various nations of the world are shown, with the final flag sporting the dollar sign. The Guy then leads the rebels to the United Nations Headquarters  where they slaughter the U.N. representatives and finally the overweight businessman who, when destroyed by The Guy, explodes into dollar bills.


Lyrics

I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger has gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Oh, superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow?
The men of steel, these men of power
Are losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go around
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
When the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright all through the night
In the wake of this madness, as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

Now, this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for

This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to
