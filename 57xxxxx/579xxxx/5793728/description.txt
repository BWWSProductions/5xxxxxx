Film version of the like-named novel by Japanese writer Shiba Ryotaro. 26 episodes, non-translated. This is a DVDrip, but have in mind that the film was made in 1966.

This is a collection of stories about the Shinsengumi - a special police force of the late shogunate period. You'll see the core of the corps - Commanders Kondo Isami and Serizawa Kamo, Vice-Commanders Hijikata Toshizou and Yamanami Keisuke, captains Okita Souji, Saitou Hajime, Nagakura Shinpachi, Harada Sanosuke and others, and follow some stories about their life and death - mostly fictional, I suppose, but based on primary sources.
