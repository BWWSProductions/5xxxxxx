Recently back from playing their first ever Warped Tour in the USA, St Albans post-hardcore group Enter Shikari make a welcome return to Reading and Leeds festivals.

A crowd favourite, Enter Shikari invoke a mean mosh-pit with their urgent electronic racket. Their most recent album Common Dreads had Radio 1's Zane Lowe singing their praises and they turned out a thrilling set at Reading and Leeds 2009, as well as a surprise acoustic set on the BBC Introducing stage.

Well and truly in prime touring mode for 2010, Enter Shikari are sure to pull off a cracking set when they re-acquaint with their faithful UK fans at the NME/Radio 1 Stage.

*Not being an avid Enter Shikari fan and with no available info I am unable to provide the tracklisting for this set.*
