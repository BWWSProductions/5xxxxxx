Sentient Creatures lectures series: Rupert Sheldrake â€“ October, 8
Dr. Sheldrake's lecture was about the way the mind extends beyond the brain, as described in his new book "The Sense of Being Stared At, And Other Aspects of the Extended Mind" (2003). He discussed the implications of a field theory of the mind for sentient creatures, natural and artificial.
