After living in Shanghai for three years, Sarah, her husband, Jason, and their young son, Sammy, return to North America for a family funeral. But something strange is going on.

Sarah turns to a mysterious pharmacist who warns that her son is being held in a death grip by a living corpse. Sarah must find out what the spirits want if she is to save her child.
