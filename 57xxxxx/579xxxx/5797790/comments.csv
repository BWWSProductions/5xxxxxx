Only issue is track 11, ""Your Guardian Angel,"" is silent from 3:55 onwards. Sounds like it's the end of the song, 'cause it fades away, but there's still minutes of a silence.
Not sure if it's caused by a faulty download on my part, or if the file itself just has that silence in it for some reason."
,vivalaaar,2011-07-15T13:45Z,"Hi Jacoby1, I heard that the long silence after that song is actually part of the song itself, as a dedication to someone who died, I think? You can check the internet for that. I also thought it was a glitch, but it isn't. :)"
,neodreamer55,2011-07-16T00:40Z,"No, that silence is always there. I originally had the actual CD (so I don't feel like such a pirate) and the silence was there too. No worries, the torrent is good. =)"
,Jacoby1,2011-07-24T09:28Z,"Fantastic. :) Makes sense, I suppose. Thanks :)"
