LOSSLESS quality, recodec from FLAC to ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
using \"ffmpeg -acodec alac\" so is ready for drag and drop in iTunes.

Due to poor amount of lossless hardcore, post-hardcore, metalcore and
deathcore I'm starting a series of uploads
using other downloads from DD websites and blogs.
