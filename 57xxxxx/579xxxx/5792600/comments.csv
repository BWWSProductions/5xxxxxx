,bytor10464,2010-10-06T01:05Z,"Chatt, they have somehow integrated an ""autoupdate"" feature that will not allow you to run the program any more unless you now ""update"" to the newest version which, of course, then reverts you back to the non-PRO version..... you got any ideas to work around that????"
