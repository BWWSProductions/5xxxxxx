It's not ""an rar file,"" and the format is not unknown, it's in compressed rar format you dumb fuck!  The file is not damaged, maybe your files are damaged, and you're brain damaged! you fuck!  This torrent is real and is funny as hell.

It's not polite to drop the F-bomb, even know his grammar is horrid.

But it is a .rar file, it's split up however so just make sure you downloaded all of the parts."

Apoligies then.  Just didn't want you to spam the comments with ""fake"" since the files worked for me.  Try downloading again.  Or go into your client and recheck pieces against the file hash."

""Four Lions tells the story of a group of British jihadists who push their abstract dreams of glory to the breaking point. As the wheels fly off, and their competing ideologies clash, what emerges is an emotionally engaging (and entirely plausible) farce. In a storm of razor-sharp verbal jousting and large-scale set pieces, Four Lions is a comic tour de force; it shows that-while terrorism is about ideology-it can also be about idiots"""

Hope this helps. ONLY if a .RAR files is password protected, does it become a hassle. However, this download is not that way, Not sure what your gripe is??? 

Thanks SAFCuko09!"

The only point in .rars was because there used to be a limit, back in the day, of what you could upload.

And you didn't offer a Linux program."

Movie isn't as good as I expected though. It may be the British humor but I didn't find it funny. Plus I don't think that it's a good idea to portray terrorists as idiots because that may lead people to underestimate them. Those that blow themselves up may have an IQ of 50 but their commanders aren't stupid."
