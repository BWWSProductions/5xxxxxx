,zoombas,2010-09-01T19:54Z,"Dont download or SEED this sh1t. Motherfucker rippers ripped only 1.5 GB and install takes 1 hour. Assholes. What is point of saving 1.5 GB if we have to wait 1 hr? We can directly download Skidrow's ISO of 5.7 GB.Go fuck your mom uploaders, instead of wasting our time. Pigdick suckers. Unleashed's family should be raped by donkeys in their asses in public till they bleed and die."
