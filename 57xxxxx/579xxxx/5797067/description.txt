The merged version of Kickassia - The Movie

Description:
A guy known as the Nostalgia Critic decides to take over Molossia, a small nation (micronation) owned by only one man. Together with the team of Channel Awesome, including the Nostalgia Chick, Filmbrain etc., they try to take over this land, and they name it... Kickassia!

I think I will post a DVD version of this at a later time, including English (and perhaps other languages) subtitles.
