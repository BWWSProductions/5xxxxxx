First disc of "7/7 The Big Picture" - new documentary investigating the July 7th, 2005, London Bombings. This first part of the series deals with the day itself and analyses the official government narrative, which turns out to be full of contradictions, inconsistencies and factual errors.

We were not told the truth about what happened that day.
