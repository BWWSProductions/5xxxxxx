this rom should work with woods 1.12 firmware if original r4 you have , if r4i then wait a couple of days and i will try and post up a patched version "

:)"

nice upload , keep up the good work"

glad it works for you , i would stick with woods firmware for all my rom;s as the patches i initially use are for woods and m3i zero , only on rare occasions will i do a further patch for DSST R4i and Acekard"
,nightwalker840,2010-08-27T22:42Z,"cheers , I will be following you for updates , "
