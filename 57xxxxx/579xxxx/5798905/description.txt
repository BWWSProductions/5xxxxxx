"Before After" - Vol 2

This Japanese TV show, is a house remodeling show that each time a top class architect reforms a horrible house in Japan.

The architects in the show are called Takumi, meaning grand master, whose ideas are always amazing.

They focus on using all the space available, reusing as much material as possible, and improving the owners standard of living through style.

Here is an exampleã€€of the show...

Although the series is ongoing, this Volume series I uploaded was recorded in the later 90's. Still, the designs are pretty amazing.

Sorry, I was not able to find any subtitles for this, so I started creating my own until I got tired of it. Episode 1 has some of the important parts subtitled but I never finished. If you would like to help me with translation, please let me know!!
