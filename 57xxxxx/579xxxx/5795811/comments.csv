[V],80zforever,2010-09-02T00:10Z,"JonYo, they have an lp that was released in 1983. Dance It Off is off that record."
,JonYo,2010-09-02T03:39Z,"I found this about them:

Do you have either of their 7"" singles or their one full length album?"

,nonsentence,2010-09-05T23:27Z,"80zforever, you have introduced me to music that I was too young to remember.  I was born in 1981 and do remember the sensibilities of the 80s, but as an adult, I have come to find treasures.  

I respect your choice to probably end it on 50, but you will be missed sorely by many people.  My wife lives in China and loves the music you share.  

The mixes help us locate music from the albums.  Best wishes!"

,eddiexx,2010-10-17T23:47Z,"strange ive not heard ONE of all of these series... i suppose theres a reason to call them ""hits"" in any way, to me they are just ""rare"" nothing more"
