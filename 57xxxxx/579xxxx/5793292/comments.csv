,robertification,2010-09-01T15:11Z,"@subtracting and others:

this is only clothes + cars etc. , you can't run it!

However, there will be dlc available that can be run at the 9th of september..."
,robertification,2010-09-01T15:12Z,"and with that i mean missions, yes."
,Special1st,2010-09-01T20:54Z,"I have a legit Mafia 2 copy. If I put these DLCs into Steam and launch the game it says ""The xx DLC seems to be installed, but it was not purchased. Purchase the DLC to use."" Can I still use them or they don't work with Steam ?"
,DrDean,2010-09-02T00:17Z,"@Special1st

I believe you can use these with the Steam version,  but you have to mod steam_api.dll. Don't worry, it won't get your account disabled or anything. It fakes Mafia 2 into thinking you're running the game through Steam even though you're not, so it can't check if you purchased the DLC. 

http://mafia-empire.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=20.0;attach=19

Download that, go into your Mafia II/pc folder and backup your original steam_api.dll, then go into the release folder of the link I sent you and paste it into the Mafia II/pc folder. If you feel unsafe doing this, then don't, but if my word means anything to you I give you my word it's safe."
,xxzzjxj,2010-09-02T22:31Z,"Can't get it to work.. The DLC's are in the ""Downloadable Content"" menu in-game, but it's not selectable. Can't see any new features too."
,DrDean,2010-09-03T01:08Z,This only adds a few vehicles to your garage and some new clothes to your closet. Doesn't do anything involving gameplay or story.
,punk420,2010-09-03T18:00Z,"guys plz help me...this crack doesn't work.....
the mafia 2 window is poping up and the app terminates automatically.....
plz help me if u can,....."
,DG777,2010-09-03T19:22Z,"the only DLC that works is the War Hero one -- Renegade DLC causes instant CTD and the rest show up in the menu, and the names of the clothes/cars show up in your garage/closet but the models don't load and you can't wear the clothes or take out the cars

so basically this is useless unless you want to wear the army uniforms Vito wears at the beginning and drive around in two different kinds of Jeeps that are really slow"
,Special1st,2010-09-04T00:26Z,"@DrDean

I got them working ! Thanks man !"
,yupzter,2010-09-04T16:11Z,"Can someone send the file ""m14_sounds_1.sds"" without the quotes.... This one seems corrupt for me..... thank you.... this file is the only thing that blocks me from playing this game..."
,kaitoukid44,2010-09-05T00:31Z,"they are all working fine! PERIOD!

,aboodyksa,2010-09-08T07:11Z,"@DrDean

,Juppie902,2011-07-24T15:30Z,"Russian DLC pack from 1C. niiiice !
as i read, Betrayal of Jimmy, Jimmy's vendetta and Joe's adventures are already included in this ? (in addition to vegas, greaser and renegade and war hero ?)"
,BadBoy4448,2011-08-17T01:03Z,"I got the Renagade Pack to work... What i did, i removed the renegade pack from the dlc-folder, started the game, closed it and put the renegade pack back into the dlc folder :D"
,cheesedelux,2011-08-22T01:01Z,"I just tested something else with the content in this and it went perfectly.
If you have a legit copy of Mafia 2 on Steam and don't want to use awkward workaround programs to fool it into thinking you're not playing the game so it can't check for DLC purchase, you can go to, for example for the Made Man pack: Mafia2.DLC\pc\dlcs\cnt_made_man\sds and copy the contents of the folder over to steamapps\common\mafia ii\pc\sds, the game doesn't recognise the new models as being a DLC (They're not under the pc\dlc) directory and lets you use them without issue.
Note: I'm using the freeroam mod, which MAY be the only reason the vehicles are in the garage, as the mod places them there anyway but they lack the actual car data so can't be used and are invisible - unless you do what I described above.
Sorry if this doesn't work for you.
Thanks for the torrent."
