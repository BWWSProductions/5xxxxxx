Carl Jung was known as the "founding father of the New Age," yet sought to avoid any public association with mysticism or the occult. Author (and founding member of Blondie) Gary Lachman joined Ian Punnett to shine light on this misunderstood facet of Jungâ€™s career. 

In the first hour, comedian Harry Shearer discussed his new documentary about Katrina, The Big Uneasy.
