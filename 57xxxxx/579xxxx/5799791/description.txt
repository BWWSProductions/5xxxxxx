FLAWL3SS NOTES
Here we go with our version of The Other Guys not the greatest screener non the less a watchable one. We want to thank our friends are IMAGINE for letting us have it. We did our normal stuff to it we brighten the movie along with saturation, contrast, denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it. We cropped the black bars and we blurred what was left of the timer after cropping. Many thanks to IMAGINE. We did our best with it and still has some faults but all in all not bad. You have been warned. Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS

credit FLAWL3SS & BDK & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
