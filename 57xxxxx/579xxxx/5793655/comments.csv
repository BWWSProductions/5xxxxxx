,Buzz1969,2011-07-23T22:13Z,"Works like a charm.
Copied the download on SD-card, put the hidden little on/off-switch beneath on 'off', inserted the SD-card, put the switch back to 'on' and the C710 started immediately with too, so it seemed, an automatic reboot.
Only thing I needed to 'correct', was the input of date and time in the Mio-sofware itself. In IGO8 it can be adjusted but it can not be saved.
Thanks."
