[Release Notes]
It's the album the entire dance scene has been waiting for. After months
of hard work and creativity, the number one DJ in the world delivers his
fourth artist album. Armin van Buuren is proud to present to you:
'Mirage'. Armin: "Mirage has been the biggest project I've ever worked
on. There's so many hours in this. Work started two years ago when I
actually built a completely new studio for this project. Many new
techniques were used and most of all I had so much fun creating this with
the many people that are involved. It was a journey, an epic one!" '76',
'Shivers' and 'Imagine' are still etched in memory of millions of dance
music lovers. Fresh memories will be made as soon as the album hits
stores on September 10th 2010. 'Mirage' reveals a side of Armin his fans
haven't heard yet and takes in its listeners with new and surprising
collaborations. Within the 2 years of endless jamming and producing,
Armin invited artists like Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Ferry Corsten, BT, Nadia
Ali, Guy Chambers, Christian Burns and Adam Young of Owl City into his
studio.

As the first single of the album, Armin chose 'Full Focus', an
instrumental track set to fill arenas, clubs and scorch across the
festival terrains set up for the summer of 2010. Armin:"The first track
of the album has been a sure shot in my sets for quite a while now. I
decided to come back with an instrumental trancer right before summer and
all the big festivals. Half of my new album will be instrumental trance,
but with the sound of 2010."

Right after summer, it's time for the full 'Mirage' album to take over.
Inspired and influenced by many different types of music, 'Mirage' is
more diverse than any other Armin album before. His collaboration with
Sophie Ellis-Bextor, 'Not Giving Up On Love' is a perfect example of
that, combining the best of both worlds. Armin:"The Nervo Sisters, Sophie
Ellis-Bextor and me met up to write the vocals for 'Not Giving Up On
Love'. I was thrilled to work with them on this. We gave it a more analog
feel with some real drums, to give it a pop-rock feel. We also put a
piano top line on the track and then the vocals of Sophie, which I think
is a win. It's a lush summer tune with an epic vocal that gets stuck in
your head and cheers you up!"

'Mirage' is filled with musical fusions and surprising interpretations,
from the orchestral masterpiece of title track 'Mirage', deep trance
track 'I Don't Own You' and housy 'Feels So Good' to the eerie 'Take A
Moment' and feel-good 'Drowning'. 16 tracks that highlight how Armin has
matured as an artist.
