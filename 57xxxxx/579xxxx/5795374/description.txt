This new series focused on the four presenters visiting various workplaces and training with their staff for five days. These work experiences included a salon, a building site, a martial-arts training class, The Royal Marines Commando training camp, a Fire services training course and a ranch in Arizona where they train to be cowboys.

But despite this it became the biggest hit in MTV UK history and is still the only UK series to go stateside
