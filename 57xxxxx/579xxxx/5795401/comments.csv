,AZkiller7,2010-08-29T02:27Z,"@9898562325
Please make sure your system meets at least the minimum requirements. It is necessary also to update DirectX and Visual C++ runtime even if you PC configuration meets the requirements mentioned above."

I don't suppose anyone could help me figure out what's wrong? Please and thanks :)"
,AZkiller7,2011-04-02T20:45Z,"@IcyDragonPolaris

Apparently you're using an Intel on-board graphics solution, i assume you've configured the emulator to use DX10. Try using DX9 instead, though built-in graphics are not known to function properly in PCSX2."
,druid513,2011-04-18T03:35Z,"thanks EZ works, but Ultraman Fighting Evolution 3 requires 2 controllers to play co-op mode. Its no problem to play VS mode with my keyboard, but I cant access co-op mode, maybe pcsx2 cant detect my 2nd set of controller on my keyboard.  "
