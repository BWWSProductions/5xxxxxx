Convert X to DVD - Best Software out there!"
,watbol,2010-10-20T05:53Z,"Yup, it's a flicker'er.(not bad though)
I used VLC-Player and corrected 90% with the Video effect = Motion Blur
Tools - Extended(ctrl-e], Video effects tab, motion blur.
Play with the slide bar While watching.
Too much makes the movie run together.
Keep the setting more to the left than center.
Other than that... Very Good, Nice 16:10 Full-WideScreen movie.
Keep up the Good Werk¡!

Image modification, then motion blur.
