 Kid Dynamite was a Philadelphia-based melodic hardcore band consisting of drummer Dave Wagenschutz, guitarist Dan Yemin, and vocalist Jason Shevchuk, as well as original bassist Steve Farrell and eventual replacement Michael "Spider" Cotterman. The band put out two full-lengths before lead singer Jason Shevchuk left the band in order to finish film/editing school; the act subsequently disbanded. They also featured former members of highly influential New Jersey melodic hardcore outfit Lifetime, and future members of a number of acts including None More Black, Armalite, Paint It Black, Higher Giant, and The Loved Ones.
