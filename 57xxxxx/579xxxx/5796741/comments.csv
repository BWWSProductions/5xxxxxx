Thanks LonnyJ"
,betataster,2010-08-29T17:10Z,"LonnyJ, apprecoiate the effor but the 12/13 file you used in the last torrent is missing the ending so if you used the same one again then same problem. The bad file ends with Pete Bethune having just entered the Shonen Maru bridge (ZOMG SPOILER!). That is NOT the ending of the episode (no more spoilers)."
,LoonyJ,2010-08-30T01:44Z,"This is not the same file. I personally ripped this one from ""On Demand"" and encoded it myself. It is the full episode."
,ScottdMac,2010-08-30T12:13Z,OK for me Thanks again lonnyj
,ScottdMac,2010-08-30T12:13Z,seems OK to me - thanks LoonyJ
