 An artifact known as the "Tablet of Order and Chaos" is shattered into
 pieces during a skirmish between Spider-Man and Mysterio, causing
 problems with multiple Marvel Universe realities. Madame Web calls on
 four versions of Spider-Man from four realities to assist her in
 bringing the realities back into balance: the Amazing Spider-Man,
 Spider-Man Noir (a 1930s version of Spider-Man), Spider-Man 2099 (the
 Spider-Man of a possible future), and a symbiote-bonded Ultimate
 Spider-Man. The Spider-Men are informed that villains in their
 respective universes have received enhanced powers due to the fragments
 of the tablet in their possession. Each villain possessing a fragment
 is granted power to accomplish what they desire most: defeating the
 Spider-Man of their respective universe.
