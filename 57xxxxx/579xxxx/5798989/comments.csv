,jayzee679,2010-09-15T14:01Z,"beerswagger2007.... What's wrong with asking a legitimate question in the comment section? There's no reason to verbally attack someone who asked for help. If you ask me the ""fucking dumb fuck"" is YOU for answering with such an ignorant comment. Stay off the comment boards if you can't offer help or an answer to someone's question, You fucking nerd fuck. "
