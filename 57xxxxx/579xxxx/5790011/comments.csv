zo ik leuk vinden

This is PERFECT - just like the retail version. It definitely is Blu-ray, it's pixel perfect. Only problem we have here is with the assholes who won't seed.

Please feel free to download this torrent, I shall be seeding this permanently at 5mbps 24/7 (My Mac is never turned off!). Please kindly help seed as well.

Thanks NLUPPER002."

I shall also be seeding it 24/7 at 5mbps minimum, so you'll download it in no time."
