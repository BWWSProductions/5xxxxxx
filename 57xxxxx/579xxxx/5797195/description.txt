Proper reasons:
other release is "NOT" a R5 source but the already also out P2P DVDSCREENER.
The real R5 has completely different aspect ratio: 2:37:1 instead 1:85:1.
Real R5 has "russian" forced subtitles and not "english"
Real R5 has better colours.

other note:
many new groups are spamming lame things:

The.Expendables.2010.DVDSCR.XviD-BiG (name of RAR's is "Prism........R01 etc
Prism is a KNEW p2p group an the release is the same RENAMED)

WHo spam this SHIT???? the A.M. releases are TRADED too, this is the real problem
what about the scene security if insecure users trade from Peer 2 Peer these shits?????
