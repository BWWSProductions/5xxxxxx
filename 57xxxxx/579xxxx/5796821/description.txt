              The TARDIS materializes in 1963 to find the human race       
              crushed by the Daleks. The Doctor embarks on a quest to      
              the Dalek planet to correct time and save the last           
              survivor of Humanity - Amy Pond!                             
                                                                           
                             Blood of the Cybermen                         
                                                                           
              The Doctor and Amy materialize in the Arctic - where         
              members of a survey team are turning from flesh to metal     
              and digging something sinister from under the ice that's     
              been waiting thousands of years - an army of Cybermen!

              With the TARDIS caught in a time riptide, it's up to Amy     
              to save the day or leave the Doctor trapped in the void      
              forever. Meanwhile, a dangerous entity is roaming the        
              TARDIS corridors and it hasn't been fed for a very           
              long time...
