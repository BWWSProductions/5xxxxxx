Installing stuff on your computer will make it slower, does not mean that this torrent is the culprit. This game works just fine, for all of you that are having ""can not fine file xxxx.dll"" and such reinstall your Visual C++ or Java that should work. Look for the .dll files here: http://www.dll-files.com (where I find what I need) If you're still having problems, then maybe games are a little advanced for you.

As for the ""Friggin Awesome computer"":
How about these apples:
ASUS Crosshair IV Extreme, Phenom II X6 4.6GHz oc'd, OCZ Z-Drive 1TB SSD, 1.8TB WD Raptor, 16GB G.SKILL Ripjaws Series DDR3 2000 oc'd, Ascension Duality case, ASUS ARES 4GB Limited Edition Graphics Card oc'd, 32in display, Cooler Master Silent Pro Gold 1200W, Windows 7 Ultimate x64.
BlueRay Burner and Dvd burner
Duel Looped Liquid cooling(CPU, GPU, RAM)
Fan Controller(for the fans I still use to cool the rest of the components)
Full Disk encryption with preboot authentication

Custom built by me
Now that's a awesome PC."

,sixor,2011-11-02T13:13Z,"thanks, works perfect"
,701bsm12,2011-12-28T07:41Z,"Very Fast download, very fast set up. However I couldnt open it because msvcp71.dll was missing.
Just type it on google, go to the first link, download the fixer not the zip file. It will do a scan saying how many dll files are msssing form your computer, then you will only be able to fix 10 of them without paying for the full version. I fixed 10, tried the game again and done, easy, plays Perfectly. I dont no if the scan or the fix 10 errors part fixed it but its as simple as that, you dont have to move or replace or copy anything into your files at all. 

Thanx for the great upload, definetly a +1 for me. Will seed :) Thanx bro"
