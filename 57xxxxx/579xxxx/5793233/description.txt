Scott Wesley Brown (born June 4, 1952 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American CCM singer and songwriter.

Brown recorded for Sparrow Records for much of his career, recording more than 20 albums; his songs have been covered by Petra, Pat Boone, Bruce Carroll, Sandi Patty, Amy Grant, and others. Brown has also worked with organizations such as Promise Keepers and Campus Crusade for Christ, and was a pastor in San Diego.[1] He toured extensively internationally. Before recording songs and touring with dozens of artists, he met a young, unfamiliar artist, Steve Camp, fresh out of high school, who would also sing backup while playing acoustic guitar with Brown on I'm Not Religious, I Love the Lord, just the year before going on his own, where he had a successful solo career. Occasionally, while his 35+ year friendship with the future label-mate (Camp) escalates, he went on tour with him, singing a bunch of songs, at the same time, traveling on the road with him, as well.
