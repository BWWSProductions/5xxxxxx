,probuilt,2010-08-30T07:24Z,I've noticed a huge leeching/ seeding of the standard def. torrent.  Why doesn't this torrent have the same or better following?  Who really watches standard def any more?
,mattberry,2010-08-30T08:10Z,That is some fucked up leeching going on. Hope they die of aids.
,yuriprimes,2010-08-30T16:23Z,"This shitty seeding has been pretty consistent with TvTeam. I've been on this torrent  for at least 8hrs. I love you guys but I'm never dl one of your torrents again.

What is this shit?

VLC does not support the audio or video format ""undf"". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.

Awesome. Guess I'll start over and get the eztv copy."
