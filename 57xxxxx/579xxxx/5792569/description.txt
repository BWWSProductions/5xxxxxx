Robert Calvert - Blueprints from the Cellar (mp3)

Ripped by myself (sparhawk451) using EAC (secure mode) and encoded with LAME (~192kbps VBR) from a CD that was released (or re-released?) in 1992.


A very rare album that is a collection of some excellent solo material by Robert Calvert (of Hawkwind fame) in a pre-production state, alot of which was never properly recorded and released due to his tragic death from heart attack in 1988.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECORD!
