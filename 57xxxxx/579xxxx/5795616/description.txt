Much appreciation to anyone who downloads my torrents as I upload them in their
full original quality without any compression and include any and/or all extras!

And a special appreciation to anyone who can or is willing to seed some or any of my torrents for as long as possible as my upload bandwidth is only around 70kB/s and even though I seed the lowest seeded torrents 24/7 as often as possible so that at least all my content remains constantly available... my upload bandwidth will only stretch so far obviously... and I have a lot of other content I'd like
to make available!

So leechers... try to always be seeding SOMETHING when you're using your P2P software if at all possible!

Otherwise at least upload and seed some sort of content of your own.

In anycase... enjoy people!
