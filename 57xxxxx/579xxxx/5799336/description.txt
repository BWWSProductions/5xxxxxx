Abraham-Hicks 2010-07-24 4-hour Video Workshop

This is a 4-hour Subscription Video Workshop (+4CDs) which was recorded in July and streamed during September and is being shared with you by Abraham-Hicks Torrent Community. See info text inside.

Every month, we are buying a new complete video workshop from â€œVideo Playlist Subscriptionâ€, at a cost of $50 per month and share it with one another via torrents. Our intention is to connect with those that are attracting Abrahamâ€™s material via torrents and with those that want to help us to make it available in a sharing format that is easy, economical and simple. 

If you would like to be informed of new torrents and about new developments of our common interest, let me know by E-mail AbeAllows@boxbe.com

Details about the quality of Video file:

The original file was 1.8 GB, which was split into 1-hour sessions, volume was added and converted into mp4 format (1 GB). The original quality is not as good as the previous (August) video but it is as good as it is viewable from: 
https://www.abraham-hickslawofattraction.com/MyAccount/video_playlist.php
The conversion into mp4 seems to made it more pleasing to watch.

If your computer does not play this video, you could try â€œMedia Player Classicâ€ It does a good job at playing it:

Jerry & Esther Hicks 
http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php

For over 20 years Esther & Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year. Their work is derived from the teachings of "Non-Physical Source Energy" whom they refer to as "Abraham".

The Teachings of Abrahamâ„¢ are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.

â€œThe thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.â€

Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham â€” whom Esther calls â€œinfinite intelligenceâ€ and Jerry refers to as â€œthe purest form of love Iâ€™ve ever encountered.â€

Thank you to all who participated to make this possible!
