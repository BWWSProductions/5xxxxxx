This movie is SO fuckign bad you might grab the closest blunt object to your person and beat yourself to death after watching it.

The overall rating for enjoyability is low. I only watched the whole movie cause I had already spent the time to get it. The story is weak and has more holes in it than a colander. There is no real point in this movie no great revelation, no great action scenes, only thing it has for it is great actors given shitty roles to play. In my opinion my time and your time is worth more than this movie gives to you."

There is a backdoor something or other in every thing that you download or they just ghost ur IP address and surf the internet as you.

A=9

Great action flick with a lot of gun slinging and knife throwing. Statham and Stallone make a pretty good team. Lot's of explosions and one liners, not exactly Shakespeare, but then again I'm no pussy. Watch it if you are into old-school ass kicking and not that fake CGI bull shit. Not bad for a 60 year old man who broke his neck during filming by Stone Cold."
,QuentinH94,2010-09-03T21:53Z,"this film sucks, hard. there are so many thing, that don't make sense, are just plain stupid, and numerous other thing, in this film.

the quality is that, of DVD. But, again, the film, itself, sucks, hard. Jet Li is the only thing that makes this worth watching, and he's not in it, long enough. So, please, all of you, spare yourselves, don't download this. And, to those of you, that are seeding, please, spare the world, STOP FUCKING SEEDING!

this film needs to be destroyed, from existence. all these people, that liked it, probably also like stupid ass games, like halo.

Well... I could rant, about this, for ages, but, I won't. Basically, just... stop, right now, stop seeding, stop downloading, stop considering to watch this."

The movie, however, is terrible. Worst shit I've ever seen. Glad I didn't have to pay to watch it.

And also: I run on a pretty bad internet conection, and downloaded it in less than 2 hours, so seeders are not a problem. Stop complaining! "
,QuentinH94,2010-09-04T05:06Z,"I hate to have a comment conv', but whatever... If they had just said ""worst ever"", no, but, if they said the bit, about Jet Li, yes, I would've avoided it. this is very much a stallone movie, the others have very bit parts. And I, personally, do not like stallone. But, many do, and they would probably enjoy this film.

And, I suggest not stopping; I've found very many virus comments, on here, and when one sees that, they should avoid the torrent. Yes, the person could be lying, but... they could be telling the truth, too. So... I'd rather be safe. you could try ignoring the people's opinion(s), though."

Need your help a bit. I've downloaded this version of Expendables and another version, and both versions have no audio when I play it?? The picture is there, just no audio, and its on both of the Expendables downloads that I downloaded! I also downloaded Robin Hood and that works fine and with audio. Can someone help me?"

In the United States, a new law proposal called The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) was introduced last week, and there will be a hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee this Thursday.

If passed, this law will allow the government, under the command of the media companies, to censor the internet as they see fit, like China and Iran do, with the difference that the sites they decide to censor will be completely removed from the internet and not just in the US.
