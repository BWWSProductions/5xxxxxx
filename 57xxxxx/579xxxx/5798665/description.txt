Review:

The Essential Michael Bolton is up-close and personal; backstage and onstage, on video, in the recording studio and in interviews. For the first time on DVD, this is the perfect visual accompaniment, comprising the promo videos to all his hits between 1985 and 1995 (originally released on VHS as Greatest Hits: The Videos 1985-1995) and a 1992 concert originally released as This Is Michael Bolton.
