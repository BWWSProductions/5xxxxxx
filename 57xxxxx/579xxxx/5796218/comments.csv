Naruto Shippuden Seasons 1 & 2 are also in my collection now so once some people are finished with this one I'll Be more than happy to upload them Better quality and still dual audio. Hope you guys will appreciate it. IF there are any anime suggestions I'll be more than glad to find them and upload them here to The Pirate Bay

idk if english is still being dubbed but as of 2009 its first 5 seasons are."
,MrQuackers,2010-09-26T23:03Z,Hmm. I can only seem to find the movies and OVA's of that one. Probably because they're still being released in the US so no ones given full episode downloads yet. I'll check in on it regularly and see what I can do.
,MrQuackers,2010-10-13T09:40Z,If anyone needs a seed I'll come back and seed. I just need you guys to say so.
