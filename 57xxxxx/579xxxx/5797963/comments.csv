your ""server"" must be screwed up again."
,PhilLesh12,2010-08-30T07:48Z,"zero seeders connected and zero bytes downloaded after an hour of downloading.

uTorrent didn't even create a folder and files for this yet.

You guys used to be the most reliable and fastest uppers on TPB.  What happened?

Might I suggest you narrow your offerings?  DUBLIN5 is blazingly fast, but they only up a few torrents a day.  Eztv has a good selection, almost as comprehensive as yours, and their download speeds are somewhere in between yours and DUBLIN5's.

Could you guys just be stretching yourselves too thin?"
,PhilLesh12,2010-08-30T09:35Z,"Wow!  

This is still a DOA torrent.

Dead On Arrival.

Seriously, TvTeam, you guys really have deteriorated.  You used to be one of the best, if not THE BEST.

Now, your torrents are more often shitty, frustrating, non-functioning.

Keep it up TvTeam. Thanks for your effort like usual."
,QborT,2010-08-30T17:16Z,"TvTeam is not stretching themselves thin.  It is a bullshit game they have started to play.

They are adding in a packet of garbage information so nobody can complete the download.  It is their attempt at creating a larger swarm."
,PhilLesh12,2010-08-31T01:33Z,"No, this one was just not doing anything for 11 hours and 40 minutes.
