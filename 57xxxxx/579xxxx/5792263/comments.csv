[V],maestral,2010-08-27T07:27Z,"My comments are not working rite for days. and my have 17 songs :P I checked it, it's legit. Quality is great and.... I only reuploaded what I get from somewhere else."
[V],maestral,2010-08-27T07:32Z,"my uploads are: 1. rare, 2. slow (30 kb/s up max) and 3. 100% legit and clean ;)"

,vampheart,2010-08-27T14:59Z,After just finishing listening to the album i can hreby confirm that this is 100% real. If you like the bank and like this album then i ask all of you who download this to consider buying it officialy to support the band... i know for sure that i will buy it when it comes out over here in the UK... once again thanks uploader for this release and great quality... :)
,vampheart,2010-08-27T14:59Z,i meant BAND lol
,Arseni91,2010-08-27T15:48Z,Track 13 Ishfwilf (I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) 0:00 - 1:35 BLANK ?? WTF !?
[V],maestral,2010-08-27T17:05Z,"Probably because song 13 and all songs after it are BONUS tracks. So theres usually pause between those songs and regular part of the album.

1. Remnants 
2. Asylum 
3. The Infection 
4. Warrior 
5. Another Way To Die 
6. Never Again 
7. The Animal 
8. Crucified 
9. Serpentine 
10. My Child 
11. Sacrifice 
12. Innocence 

Bonus Tracks 
13. Leave It Alone 
14. ISHFWILF (U2 Cover) 
15. DWTS Live 
16. Stricken Live 
17 Living After Midnight

@vampheart: I know I will buy original. After all IT'S DISTURBED :D"
,D3vi1dog,2010-08-27T18:51Z,"bad torrent?? the file downloads to my desktop and when i try to add it to my itunes library or play them, the only ones that work are living after midnight and stricken live. but they all work thru windows media player. ive downloaded and re downloaded it and still the same and a friend is having the same problem"
[V],maestral,2010-08-27T19:09Z,"I've played it in winamp, and add it in my mobile phone. They all work."
[T],Skymocker,2010-08-27T19:19Z,works perfectly in VLC.
[T],Skymocker,2010-08-27T19:20Z,"@ D3vi1dog   ""bad torrent??""

I removed my torrent of disturbed - asylum because maestral's was better.  'nuff said."
[V],maestral,2010-08-27T19:46Z,If you have any problems with internet music (mp3s) do what I usually do. Burn it and them rip it from that cd. That removes all problems.
,Disturbedphobia,2010-08-27T21:09Z,Hey masestral. i tried burning it to a cd and then ripping it but it didnt work. is there another way?
,tebu91e,2010-08-27T22:51Z,WOO HOOO!!! THX!
,RnRTeeM,2010-08-28T00:18Z,"THANKZ!!!!!WILL SEED!!!
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS CD!!!
"
[V],maestral,2010-08-28T03:10Z,"I think you 2 are fake. lol. No uploads, whining about fresh stuff, and it's working for everybody else. I even burnt it and tried ripping from CD. It ripps like any other CD. After burning it, even if there is some protection, that would be lost due to format conversion."
[V],maestral,2010-08-28T03:12Z,"Anyone else have these problems except 2 guys with no uploads to confirm their story?

Cheers, and N-joy all of you who wanted this album."
,Sacrado,2010-08-28T04:09Z,"I realize this is a new account with no uploads, but I thought I'd just say that I can't seem to get iTunes to play the music from this torrent or the other torrents of Disturbed's new Asylum album.  Not sure why it doesn't work.

That being said, my other music players, like WMP and VLC, play the music just fine, and the quality is great.  Thanks for the upload!"
,Vemados,2010-08-28T04:09Z,"Yeah, actually. I registered just so I could ask about this so I don't have any uploads but when I put this on iTunes only the last two tracks show up. I have no idea why"
,Raco0n,2010-08-28T04:34Z,"I also had the problem they said, the files open fine in media player but only living after midnight and stricken open in itunes"
,Rachet101,2010-08-28T05:38Z,Thanks for this bro great upload =) no problems in itunes for me. 
,D3vi1dog,2010-08-28T06:31Z,"i also created this account to ask questions on torrents cuz honestly idk what the hell im doing with zip files on games, etc. so i need help. i dont even know how to upload anything. im not knocking this torrent, i was just askin why its doin this for only a few people. im about the biggest disturbed fan out there and im pumped as can be that u guys put the album up on here. but i did have to rip it from the cd to get it into itunes."
,d3rrty1,2010-08-28T07:52Z,"To anyone who has trouble with adding these files to iTunes, do this:
-Google and Download Audacity and Lame for MP3
-Open the program and go to Edit -> Preferences
--Make sure to click the File Formats tab and at the bottom check to see if MP3 Export has Lame 3.98 and if it doesn't, click Find Library and point to it.  Also, make sure that after it is pointed to, you change the bitrate from 128 to 320 to preserve the HQ bitrate.
-Export each song back into the folder and overwrite the song already there. 
--Oh, and a side note, if anyone DOESN'T like the silence at the beginning of track 13, just use Audacity to remove it and export it back into the folder and overwrite.

They will work 100% if you export and overwrite the files.

Cheers

BTW, the last track is not from the album but from a Judas Priest tribute CD. 

maestral, great upload for sure. Great quality! And thanks for introducing me to the song Living After Midnight."
[V],maestral,2010-08-28T20:02Z,Thank you d3rrty1. Problem solver for all of you Itunnerz :D
,RnRTeeM,2010-08-28T20:06Z,"NO PROBLEMS HERE, PLAYING IT ON BADASS SURROUND SYSTEM SOUNDS GREAT, AND PLAYING IT OFF MY I-TOUCH!! AWESOME! THANKS ""maestral"" cheers!"
,RnRTeeM,2010-08-28T20:13Z,SO FAR YOUR IS THE BEST ENOUGH SAID!!!!
,mindizzle,2010-08-29T03:43Z,i downloaded the file and none of the songs except the last two will go into my music library 
[V],maestral,2010-08-29T05:37Z,"Music library on what? WMP? IPOD? something else? I listened to entire album on my comp in winamp, on my mob and even burn it to cd. They all worked for me."
,DarthzeroProductions,2010-08-29T07:55Z,"Well, i be damned. this noob actually uploaded something worth it ;) jk jk Maestral"
,JH360,2010-08-29T09:21Z,"I had the same problem as mindizzle; only the last two tracks would go into my iTunes library. The way I sorted it out is to open them up in GoldWave, then save them as completely new files. They worked perfectly after that, and they sound excellent."
,RightClickMouse,2010-08-29T12:16Z,"I think the problem that many users are having (myself included) are with iTunes, not your torrent. When I tried to add the album to my library, only the last two files would should. While I have no idea what caused this, I have found a solution. Download a tool called ""MKWACT"". It is normally used to convert between lossless files, but with the LAME plugin, it can convert to MP3s aswell. Decode the downloaded files to wav (it will detect an error with the MP3s, just let it do its job) then convert them back to 320k MP3s. They will all then import to iTunes with almost no quality loss. Buy this album, it is awesome (I pre-ordered mine around a month ago, and it should ship when the Uk release comes!)"
[V],maestral,2010-08-29T17:28Z,"Well, this is probably from I-tunes as it wasn't suppposed to get on cd stores till 31st of the month. Probably is that. I never asked for the source, when you get working copy of something like this one you don't ask much ;)"
,pxndxcarlos,2010-08-29T18:18Z,THNKS.... FUCK IT .. I LOVE THIS BAND...
,nismomad,2010-08-30T02:44Z,good clean torrent full album 2min to download thanks uploader
,njtsx,2010-08-30T02:52Z,"Not often I have this issue... I also had the problem with iTunes (Mac). Only 2 songs would import correctly. I used Toast to convert, all seems well. If you have extra time (and software) go ahead and DL. Otherwise, download elsewhere."
[T],V413HAV,2010-08-30T12:59Z,"Thnks Dude, I Jus Verified & This Is Original Stuff Guys, Frequency Reaches 20mhz In Adobe Audition. Worth Download. Not Like NoFS Shit...Bloody All His Albums Are Re-Encoded."
,DisturbedTalent,2010-08-30T23:55Z,i almost nevver comment on stuff but disturbed is just so amazing i had to make an account and comment on it! amazing upload thank you!
[V],maestral,2010-08-31T01:58Z,"I'm thanking you all for seeding this one ;)

P.S. I ordered my Copy of this to get it on original when it's available, so I'd tell you to do the same if you can afford it. Disturbed deserves it. I might upload FLAC version of it (from original) when I get it if somebody doesn't UP it first till then.

Cheers guys"
,latenitee,2010-08-31T03:22Z,niceeeeee thanks man
,grmrepr,2010-08-31T06:55Z,"yeah, good quality, but the files don't get along with i-tunes very well... I would recommend another torrent if you are going to be using them in itunes..."
,Somacruz_92,2010-08-31T10:35Z,I've been waiting forever for this!!!
,devilsadvocate80,2010-08-31T22:06Z,Great upload and great quality! There is about 1:30  of dead space before ISHFWILF. Am I the only one?
,devilsadvocate80,2010-08-31T22:07Z,Great upload and great quality! There is about 1:35 of dead space before ISHFWILF. Am I the only one?
[V],maestral,2010-08-31T23:32Z,"It's not dead space, it's pause between regular part of the album and BONUS tracks. I already post that as a comment here.
It's like that on all cds with bonus tracks."
,jk911,2010-09-01T00:08Z,anyone got the decade of disturbed dvd yet that would be great
,daugystik,2010-09-01T01:56Z,"Great upload, I had to use audacity and LAME, I got help from d3rrty1, but that was my plan initially, thanks, I'll seed for you"
,DevilFragment,2010-09-01T06:48Z,"For everybody having that problem with the itunes importing, just convert the files to mp3. I used Koyote's converter, google it, it's free. "
,mikehurst594,2010-09-02T06:49Z,HELL YEAH!!!!! Thanx maestral sounds EXCELLENT!!!!! ;D
[V],maestral,2010-09-02T07:38Z,"Thank to you all, this one made it to top 100 audio torrents. You can all enjoy the glory ;D"
,kylon100,2010-09-02T11:55Z,"Cheers for the iTunes fix explanation.

,ohiobuckeyefan1387,2010-09-02T22:55Z,"Thanks d3rrty1, you saved me and probably a lot of other people lol, great torrent maestral also!"
,sweetaboutme,2010-09-03T12:01Z,i made an account just to say thanks. It downloaded super quick & sounds great! 
,Frostbyte88,2010-09-07T12:18Z,"Thanks for uploading and for all the seeders!
Sadly my uppload speed is too low to seed(80 KByte/sec), i apologize for that."
[V],maestral,2010-09-07T22:54Z,Mine is 30 k/sec and I'm optimistic ;)
,ltcmdrData,2010-09-09T00:23Z,Thank you bro! 
,zingmars,2010-09-10T06:22Z,"To get ride of the blank part in Ishfwilf use program called audacity. It's easy to use and it's free.
The Uploader should note that in the description too."
[V],maestral,2010-09-10T08:24Z,"I already mentioned it in comments, as it's not possible at the moment to edit torrents. It's usuall pause between regular part of the album and bonus part. You don't remove that on none album."
,AskingEric,2010-09-10T08:36Z,thx for the awsme music and the koyote format changer without tht i would hv been lost
,The3vilM0nk3y,2010-09-10T23:18Z,Why upload in a format that most everyone has to convert. Just seems pointless.
,stormsend,2010-09-11T00:20Z,the koyote changer took 10 mins to download and install and convert!!! very impressed rocking on my iphone now fantastic +1
[V],maestral,2010-09-11T07:41Z,"Format is mp3. I get it that way. It works on comp., on mobile phones, you can burn it to cd. I didn't know it has some problems with Ipod, as I don't use it. It works great on everything else."
,r4k1c,2010-09-11T23:35Z,great! thank you very much :D
,fallengz,2010-09-14T05:33Z,fucking lame. 
,{me},2010-09-14T08:44Z,"Thanks for the up and the great bitrate.

@The3vilM0nk3y most everyone will not convert these. Apple has a thing for using unusual or nonstandard formats, which is one reason I choose not to support them."
,{me},2010-09-14T08:56Z,"Download in 2mins 11secs @ 1.8MBps (my limit)
Can confirm clean, complete and rockin!

Thanks again maestral"

,Brakkis,2010-09-17T17:01Z,"So I these are all downloaded as Mp3, so what exactly am I supposed to be converting them to so they'll work on iTunes?"
,ThreatSignalQc,2010-09-19T18:16Z,Count me in as another fast seeder :).  Thnx for the GREAT upload!!!
,Joshman13x,2010-09-19T21:26Z,"Yea the file conversion is a real pain in the freakin ass, but this torrent downloaded in like 15 minutes so i'll just download a converter and it'll be fine. you people need to stop bitching, although maestra you might want to make your new torrents in mp3 format since it's the most common. "
