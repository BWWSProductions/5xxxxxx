,xiIix,2010-08-28T13:31Z,"Ripped games do not work in multiplayer. How many times does this have to be repeated before ti sinks in for you people? Finding a ripped game that works online is rare. The rule of thumb, is that if it's ripped, it will not work online unless EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE NFO!"
