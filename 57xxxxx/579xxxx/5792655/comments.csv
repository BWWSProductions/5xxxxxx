,Crazy-Scamp,2010-08-27T17:07Z,"if its the same as all the others then there will be probs, .dll errors."
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-08-28T10:38Z,"It works, but after I clicked ''run windows'' in the game itself, I haven't been able to start this game."
,drahic,2010-08-29T11:06Z,"All working fine to me. I dont have problem with install and pysich..
Just follow what is written and install all 3-Psycho,and other 2. 

Thanks!!
btw- the game is full of glitches and bugs..!!The boat is flips and sinking around.

I downloaded a patch from shipsim.com but then i lose sky and sea.."
,wandel_nl,2010-08-29T18:58Z,"IT WORKS!!!

After a little bit of searching it works.
First of all you need a very good computer with ar least 2Gb memory , Pentium 4 or higher and a good graphics card. If you don't have these, then forget it. The game ask a lot from your computer.

Installation.

The installation language must be ENGLISH. Do not use others, otherwise you get a language faillure. At the end of the installation you het tree extra installations, like activeX physics etc. Install them all. After the installation is finished copy the content of the Skidrow to the folder.
Then start the ship simulator. It can take a few minutes when you must fill in the serial number.

Then it starts. 

What I am looking for is the documentation of the Ship Simulator. Like using keys etc. Where can I find these"
,fatpuzzyeater,2010-08-30T05:26Z,i have tried at least 5 times to get this to work i did everything it said soo why am i getting dlll errors while others say it works?
,Moonbootsfc,2010-08-30T05:56Z,If your getting the dlll errors its beacuse you didn't install physX and microsoft redistributable Visual C++ just after ship sim installs. It gives you 3 boxes to tick. Make sure you tick them all and install them.
,gman543,2010-08-31T02:42Z,"how do you find the installation directory.
where is the installation directory.
and the game is giving me error messages .dll what is that from"
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-08-31T12:22Z,"BLACK SCREEN ERROR:

Developers response:
''We don't know why this happens on the steam version of the game. The boxed and download version from shipsim.com doesn't seem to have this problem. Only for the steam version. We've tried everything but no solution so far''."
[T],Coolguy33,2010-09-02T13:38Z,"After installation it comes up with 3 boxes to tick:
Direct x
Physics
Microsoft Redistributable Visual C++

I have ticked them all but it wont install Direct x or Physics. All it does is come up with error messeges.
The weird thing is that the game starts to load up after but then it just goes to a black screen and does nothing."

,WIN705,2010-09-03T22:38Z,"Don't worry if you get dll errors,because if (like me) you CAN run the game NO MATTER WHAT YOU ENTER AS SERIAL IT'S INVALID,DON'T UPLOAD SHIT LIKE THIS FUCKHEAD!"

[T],Coolguy33,2010-09-04T00:50Z,"Got the game to run but when i changed the resolution higher to 1680x1050 and restart the game it don't work. All i get is a black screen. Have reinstalled it over and over but it still does the same thing with the black sreen.
Aaaaarrrrrrghhh.....this is just bullshit man! "
[T],DjAligator14,2010-09-04T12:40Z,blame the game and for some reasons the crack not me. This game has a lot of bugs. I upload this game because it work for me if the game gave me some error on starting it or playing it then i won't upload it. For those who post idiot comments think more before you post them!
[T],Coolguy33,2010-09-04T17:53Z,@DjAligator14 does it look like i'm blaming you and yes i do think before i post idiotic comments pal. All i'm syaing is the game worked and now it don't. simple! The game developers obviously have programmed this game very badly. Even when i had the game running there were glitches and until they bring out a patch there are gonna be problems. Shit happens. It will work for some but not for others.

,remali9004,2010-11-05T16:45Z,"Here is the solution:
Well. the game need to install (It's better to find from your own the latest DirectX, Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable anf the latest FhysX from Nvidia. 
And other way is to download the demo version
from the original website of the game.
It contains correctly all the above programs.
Also you have to be sure that you have the latest vga graphic drivers.
Well, the game can be install fine on win7.
WinXp needs to go to programme folder and right click to file QuestViewer.
Set compatibility to win98/winMe2000.
That was the cause the game crashed after setup

Hope I helped.
It's a good game with GreenPeace missions."

I have found away of Fixing the .dll problem
or if you get the infinite Splash screen problem.

1.) Uninstall the Game.
2.) Mount the Image with any program (e.g. Deamon Tools)
3.) Browse the files on the Disc, find Setup.exe and RIGHT CLICK and choose RUN AS ADMIN
4.) once setup has completed make sure you tick ALL 3 of the Boxes (even if you have one of them installed already!)
5.) Copy the contents of the Skidrow folder to your installation Directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Paradox Interactive\Ship Simulator Extremes)
6.) Run the Game and it should work!

 if it still doesn't work send me a Tweet on twitter @minisackboy and I'll help you.
