,kiraburu,2010-09-12T19:23Z,"man, you have to specify that this is an ISO, not made with the psjailbreak/groove exploit. THIS DOESNT WORK WITH THE EXPLOIT. You can not copy this anywhere outside the .iso and you can not burn it either. So now is useless, lets hope some homebrew can do the trick with this type of file. THX ANYWAY.- "
,hungryman521,2010-10-30T11:10Z,"wait, does this actually work for PS3? I thought that the PS3 was still not hacked. Before I download this can somebody explain how this would work. Do you just burn this onto a CD and stick it in your PS3? I am also pretty sure that there is no such thing as a 5 GB CD. Anyway any help would be appreciated. "
