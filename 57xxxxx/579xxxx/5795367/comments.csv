The band released the Killing All That Holds You EP themselves a year later, and started to develop a local following for their Tool- and Deftones-influenced alt-metal. Killing All That Holds You was eventually expanded with four additional studio tracks and some live acoustic material. 10 Years signed with Republic/Universal, and in August 2005 their major-label debut appeared. Autumn Effect was produced by Josh Abraham (Staind, Static-X), and set up a 10 Years tour with Disturbed that ran through the fall."
