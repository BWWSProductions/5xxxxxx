,lucky99,2010-08-26T15:13Z,"Thanks for the Upload, Audio is slightly out of sync, fortunately I fixed it with a program called YAAI, i adjusted the audio by -200ms, it fixed the problem."
,lucky99,2010-08-26T16:59Z,"Actually, the sync issue seems to be related to a slight problem with the frame rate as it becomes more out of sync as the video goes on. I have been trying to adjust this for an hour, i think I have finally fixed it by slightly lessening the frame rate. I am about to watch so I will post again later"
,lucky99,2010-08-26T17:39Z,"I normally like to try and fix dodgy avi's, but this one goes in and out of sync all over the place, so i have given up.  Thanks for the upload, but frustrating to watch due to audio out of sync issues."
