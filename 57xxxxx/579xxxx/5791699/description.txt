           When a couple is taken hostage in their home by an             
           intruder, a simple home invasion robbery turns into            
           something much more complicated. The wife may, or may          
           not, know the intruder; and the intruder may, or may not,      
           have previously crossed paths with the husband. Can a          
           couple survive once they have been exposed to each other       
           for who (and for what) they really are? Is the intruder        
           actually there just to rob them? What are they each            
           trying to hide from him and from each other?
