Dark On Fire is the fourth studio album by the British band Turin Brakes. The band spent 2006 writing and recording demo songs. These songs were tested live on a UK tour in November 2006. After this, Olly Knights and Gale Paridjanian teamed up with their live band and producer Ethan Johns to put the album together. The album was recorded in two different studios in London in early 2007. The band took a break from recording sessions late January because Gale's wife was expecting a baby, but in March 2007 the band finished the recording sessions.

The album was released on September 17, 2007 and entered the UK chart at #36. Special edition copies come with the 5-track bonus EP "Something Out Of Nothing."

The album was released to mostly generally favorable reviews although some reviewers found the new highly produced full-band sound to be disappointing. Others hailed the album as a return to the quality of 2001's The Optimist LP . Though the album sounds more glossy than previous efforts, it is in fact a mostly live recorded effort. This is significantly different from the previous albums. The band credit Ethan Johns with the idea for this approach. Playing the songs live to an audience helped shaping the songs as well
