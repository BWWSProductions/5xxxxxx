,Athmnt,2012-01-06T17:25Z,"Did not work. After discompressing all the 34 parts this contains, I got a Damaged new Compresed rar file. 
Double compression seems to fail commonly at least on my pc, forcing me to re-download and 3.25 GB? not worth it
The download of the Iso alone, even if its size was bigger, works for me.

Thanks anyway and I'll keep looking"
