v3.1.5.564 is from 5 July 2008 - over 2 years old."

How about providing some information that anyone with half a clue wouldn't already know.

It's comments like yours that give the Comments sections of public Torrent sites such a poor name for being so often filled with halfbaked comments.

Blacktroy was mistaken in calling this Release the ""LATEST"" version.

If you knew anything about the way Videoredo was produced and released you would know that the beta tag means nothing with respect to VideoRedo's versions of TV Suite EXCEPT in relation to the particular versions ability to handle wtv files - something they still haven't managed to conquer in version 4 (hence TWO YEARS worth of betas). Nonetheless every version subsequently released is still a ""LATER"" version for all the usual VideoRedo functionality (other than the handling of wtv files - something which this Release obviously doesn't do either).

Even this site has on offer a ""LATER"" version than this which is more bug free and better than the one being offered here.

So before throwing in your 2 cents worth, it's preferable to learn about the product and the versions.

For people who want the latest trouble free version of this product, get it from this Torrent: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5200849/VideoReDo_TVSuite_v3.1.5.565_%5BPC___ENG_DEU%5D

- which was released nearly a year ago on this site!  That is a better and LATER version that the one in this Torrent.

And given that you both can obviously read and write, have you ever considered reading CAREFULLY, ie. taking some care to comprehend instead of persisting with ignorance.

I will deal with your inanities one by one, wasting my time doing so - but only for the benefit of other readers - because you two have shown a reluctance to be informed.  Accordingly, do NOT reply further once I have corrected your miscomprehensions. Instead, READ CAREFULLY, take it in and try to learn something."

Trin02: Okay, if you say version 4 is not a beta or pre- release version, why then is not available for sale?

IT IS FOR SALE!  You need to buy a licence to use version 4 for over 15 days (the trial period).  Theyâ€™ve removed it from the purchase download link because newbies like you complain if buying a version where one aspect of the program still has bugs â€“ hence they put the old non-wtv version for sale as a first point to fairly earn the purchase price â€“ but make no mistake, version 4 is what they wanted to have working bug free long ago (and IT IS bug free OTHER THAN the wtv x264 aspect) and what they would have loved to continue offering from the download link if they hadnâ€™t encountered unforseen problems.

Trin02:  Usually software companies only sell their final versions, beta or pre-release version are for testing. 

Firstly the whole premise of your question displays how patently you have missed the point!  The SOLE point of discussion is whether the tag â€œLATESTâ€ applies to this release.  And even those with low intelligence should be able to recognise that is is NOT.  That is enough to dispense with this whole sorry issue. But Iâ€™ll continue in furtherance of your education.  

You need to familiarise yourself with the workings of small software providers.  They often sell their beta versions when they believe they are near completion promising any purchaser that the licence wll be good for the final version.  This is not an uncommon practice for small operators.  Just read the Forums and try educating yourself before posting inanities."

,registered1,2010-09-12T15:52Z,"Trin02:  ""Please don't argue, this is the final version that the VideoRedo site offers. Why is so old? I don't know, ask them."" 

It s so old because they thought they had solved the problems with MS's new file format but for numerous reasons (read the Forums) the problems have proven to be very difficult to overcome.  Nonetheless the LATER versions are still more advanced in their handling of non-wtv x264 files - hence why the release I mentioned above (and many releases subsequent) are still LATER (and better) than this Release!

If you read my original post instead of blanketing yourself in ignorance, you would understand the relevant point â€“ but it seems that your reluctance well outweighs your ability to reason.

So here's the SALIENT point once again: This Release is NOT the â€LATESTâ€ version and is definitely NOT the version that any smart user is looking for, given that it has been available from many sites for over 2 years! Has it sunk in yet?

And if it still hasn't sunk in, just look at the number of seeders on the Torrent that contains the LATER version.  ... The penny would have dropped by now for even the slowest of people."
,registered1,2010-09-12T16:02Z,"BLACKTROY: ""You say that version 4 doesn't handle .wtv files from Windows7 Media Center"".

Can you prove yourself to be a greater fool than you already have thus far.  It's bad enough you post false and misleading titles â€“ which is the source of the whole problem â€“ but now you have to go further by showing you are unable to comprehend simple English.

What I wrote was clear to anyone with basic comprehension skills, namely, that the AIM of version 4 is to add wtv & x264 support â€“ that is its whole raison d'Ãªtre!!! And that aim is still something they haven't managed to fully achieve â€“ even though they have gone a fair way (they even at one stage hoped they had succeeded ... but upon release, found that the overwhelming feedback received meant more work was required).  Just read the Forums and try and educate yourself.

I'm sure poor trin02 (who clearly has good intentions) would not have been so foolishly drawn into this discussion if you had been honest in your titling.

The SOLE issue from the outset has been your false & misleading use of the term ""LATEST"" paraded in Caps in the title of this Torrent.  That is THE ISSUE!

If you (or anyone reading this) wants to win some kudos, don't waste your time with false titles and stupidity but rather keep your eye out for a version 4 Release â€“ that's what all the clued up people have been waiting for â€“ and for a long time now.  See this old release (April '10) on this very topic 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5512241/Videoredo_TVSuite_4.20.5.600_%28needs_cracking_%29_-_this_new_versio

As for the two of you, do NOT respond to this post. You are just wasting my time with your ignorance.  It's not my job to educate you after already doing so once.  Once should be enough â€“ even for slowbie newbies."
,registered1,2010-09-12T20:18Z,"you are just an out and out fool.

The LATER verions are not full of bugs, you cretin.  They just have issues with respect to wtv & x264 support.

Apologies to Blacktroy for attributing a comment made by trin02 to him.  The overwhelming stupidity of what has been written and the fact that the posting of long comments on this site tends not to work that well in Firefox (hence the repeated posts and half posts) led to the incorrect attribution.

The points made all still remain correct.  Blacktroy made the initial labelling error and trin02 has been on a mission to display his abject ignorance about this product.  And what a display he has made - you have absolutely proved beyond any doubt that you don't have a clue.
