,htosor,2010-10-09T06:51Z,"Fast download, decent quality, not great though, I'd give it a V7. Watchable though. Hard to find subtitles, and I only found them without the chinese bits translated. Here's the link if anyone's interested: http://subscene.com/english/The-Karate-Kid-AKA-The-Kung-Fu-Kid/subtitle-359766.aspx"
