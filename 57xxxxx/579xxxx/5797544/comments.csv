,timmiej1993,2010-08-30T20:33Z,"You might not post fakes, but you do post fake titles.
You say: 720p
NOT.

Resolution...: 1280x544
which means:
544p

I really hate people who don't know technology."
,swiftprods,2010-08-31T00:01Z,"That's gotta be the DUMBEST thing I've heard said on here in awhile, LOL. It's 720p because you have 1280 pixels going across in width. 544 is just the container height after the top and bottom black bars are cropped. Only tv groups leave their 720p res intact at 1280x720. 1280x544 is HD-ready at a 1:2.35 aspect ratio (anamorphic widescreen -> usually remastering old movies with a 4:3 aspect ratio to be able to view correctly on a widescreen television).

1280x720 is HD-Ready at a 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen)
1920x1080 is Full HD at a 19:9 aspect ratio (widescreen)

So to answer your question, yes, 1280x544 is 720p. If you care to expand your knowledge on this subject you might wanna skidoodle on over to this site...

Have fun! =)"

@timmiej1993: you need to study a little before you criticize someone. I understand enough about technology to me, including this. The rest I do not care whether you hate the laity in the subject or not"
,Karaokesteve,2010-08-31T19:20Z,"this is an excellent release except for the fact that I was jewed by the ""English Foreign Parts"" in the subtitles description. It's actually some weird fucked up russian looking shit. Other than that, it's amazing... but i just wasted a dvd blank on this because nobody can read the shit."
,Karaokesteve,2010-08-31T19:36Z,"no it does not, you'll have to hardcode them yourself. but they're included"
,david_blainny,2010-09-12T10:01Z,Best Movie 
,TheOriginalDaniel,2010-09-21T16:09Z,"whats ""English Foreign Parts (SRT)"" mean? this doesnt have hard coded subs does it?"
