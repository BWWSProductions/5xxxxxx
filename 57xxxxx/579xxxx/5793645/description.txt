"  This fine set, recorded on November 30, 1956, has been reissued several times, often as a John Coltrane date, but make no mistake, this is a Tadd Dameron session, and his elegant compositions are its key component. Coltrane was fresh off playing with Miles Davis in 1956 and was still a year away from heading his own sessions and three years away from recording Giant Steps, so it might be said that he was in transition, but then when was Coltrane not in transition? Dameron wisely gives him plenty of space to fill, and the rhythm section of John Simmons on bass and the great Philly Joe Jones on drums (not to mention Dameronâ€™s own characteristically bass-heavy piano style) give Trane a solid bottom to work with, and if the spiritual and edgy emotion of his later playing isnâ€™t quite in place yet, you can feel it coming. But again, this is Dameronâ€™s date, with each of the six selections an original Dameron composition. Thereâ€™s so much to marvel at here, including the Bahamian rhythms of the title track, â€œMating Call,â€ the gorgeous build of â€œSoultraneâ€ (often the title when this set is issued as a Coltrane date) and the undeniable grace and elegance of â€œOn a Misty Nightâ€ (based in part on the melody line to â€œSeptember in the Rainâ€). The straight blues piece â€œRomasâ€ is also a lot of fun, particularly for Coltrane. Mating Call, or whatever title it sports, whether under Dameronâ€™s name or Coltraneâ€™s, is a solid and frequently overlooked gem. Donâ€™t hesitate to pick it up. "
