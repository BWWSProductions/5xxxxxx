,jon4fun,2010-08-29T14:33Z,"@htctouch - I know you are a fan of 20-40 and so you must know that he is working on an old resurrected (many times) PC.

We are lucky to get any encodes and are only getting torrents as they get served by an FTP service that he pays for.

I know it is 'just your opinion' but THINK (about all circumstances) before you write.
