Close Encounters of the Third Kind - deleted scene.avi

From Disc 2 of the Collector's Edition of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" DVD.  Deleted scene # 4.  ""At the Airport" (4:31) is just plain weird. After some scratchy leader tells us that footage of "Chicago O'Hare" will be inserted later, we get to see "Air Force Research and Development Command" commandeer an airliner that was buzzed by a UFO and politely take all the passengers' film. Meanwhile, in a limo outside the plane, Truffaut tells Balaban once again to "translate his feelings and emotions" Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥ then tests Balaban by having him translate passages from a steamy romance novel." http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/c/closeencounters.shtml

Coast to Coast - Aug 26 2010 - Linda Moulton Howe - Close Encounters.mp3

Second half of the third hour of Linda Moulton Howe's program on Coast to Coast AM.  "British scholars Robbie Graham and Matthew Alford recently uncovered a 1978 interview with Steven Spielberg in which he said about his then-newly released movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, "I really found my faith when I heard that the government was opposed to (my) film. If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then I knew there must be something happening." Graham & Alford investigated the Spielberg quote and his link to political powers that manipulate information about UFOs and other sensitive subjects in Hollywood productions." http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2010/08/26
