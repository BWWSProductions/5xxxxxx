This album is a tribute to the oldskool/rave music which I grew-up listening to through pirate radio stations and old Amiga tracks. It was made around 2001 and all the tracks were made in FastTracker II, but they've been remastered for this release (track 4 was made in only 4 channels!). 

All tracks recorded in 320kbps LAME mp3

Tracklisting:

01 - Introducing Dr Evil
02 - Sweet Obsession
03 - Sweeter Than Wine
04 - LSD On Toast

Hope you enjoy.
