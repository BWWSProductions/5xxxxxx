Tackling all of the 1,945 general-use characters through one of the highly organized component analysis systems described in these reviews may be more of a learning task than some Kanji Clinic visitors are ready to take on. Kanji Isn't That Hard! is recommended for those who have more limited goals, or who would simply like to get their feet wet using component analysis to learn kanji.

Takebe's text covers 414 characters. The majority of these are "kyouikui" kanji-- the 1,000 characters learned by Japanese elementary school children-- but others are more advanced general-use characters. Takebe's first 192 characters are explained in Japanese with an English translation beside each, and the last 222 are explained only in Japanese (with furigana provided for every kanji in the explanation). Illustrations accompany the first 192 entries.

In his text, Takebe offers 24 "rules" for understanding how kanji components fit together in individual characters, and gives examples that illustrate each rule.
