Where do you place .minecraft in windows 7?"
,ReaperOne1Two2,2010-08-28T13:56Z,"Host of torrent if you would add my instruction to the discription it would be great. I'm putting down steps to install the game AND play multiplayer.

__________________________________________
                            Instructions
__________________________________________

1) First Make sure you downloaded the correct launcher for your system along with the server files and .minecraft.

2) Drag your .exe file to your desktop or .jar depending on what system your on.

3) Next drag your server folder to your desktop(The entire folder not just one the one file or else it will spam your desktop with files) This step can be ignored if you have no plans to ever host.

4) Now for the .minecraft folder. If you don't get a play offline button when failing to log in this is where you messed up like so many of you posted. Open run from Start->All Programs-> Accessories and type in %appdata% and drag your .minecraft folder into here.(Yes the whole folder)

5)Now run your .exe to see if your window pops up asking for a login name just hit login then play offline.(Your done right now if you have no interest to play online).

6) Now for online play. Your server must be in lan so you will need to use hamachi etc.. Run the exe inside the server folder atleast once then close it.(Ignore this step if your not hosting ever)
"
,ReaperOne1Two2,2010-08-28T14:08Z,"7) Activate lan server. Inside the server folder you ran the serverfile in atleast once you have many new files. One file is called server and it's a PROPERTIES File.
Open this with notepad(If you really cant find out which file this is open both in notepad. *Hint* It's the One that doesn't already open in notepad). This can be done by right clicking going to properties and clicking change.

8) Now for the part where you actually get the client to connect to the server with multiple people without kicking them out. Everyone by default is named Player by default
and no duplicate names are allowed. You will need a memory ediot of some sort.(Not allowed to put this part probably but dl this one) www.softcows/com/memory_editor_faqs.htm.

9) After the memory editor is installed open the game and goto the multiplayer connection screen but don't connect. Now open the memory editor and put the Search value
as player and data type as string. You'll get quite a few results but you want to edit the only one that is Value=Player and Type=WideString.Right click edit and connect to lan server of your choice. The name must be 6 letters or less and if it's less add spaces."

Sorry responded earlyier but it didn't submit. When on the game on the multiplayer screen after hitting play offline open the memory editor click Add task and add javaw.exe(It should show up when the game is open). Then you make sure the Search value is on Player and Data type is string. Then just select the only string listed as Player with Widestring to the right. Right click hit edit and change Player to anything and make sure it is equal to 6 charcters space counts. Then right click on it again and hit refresh and join a server of your choice. You can close to memory editor at this point.

@dzuwno 
That's another bug unrelated to to this. I saw it mentioned under the FAQ I think on the site or something. Just type it in google and you'll probably find it or the forums. Has something to do with the system clock I think. If it's your first time launching and connecting to the server it's loading lag due to generating the map. Look in all directions for like 5 seconds and see if that fixes it. It should go away.

@ EnvuxiFreaK
You forgot to hit add task an choose javaw.exe Check emans response for funn details.

@ex1ver
I heard someone else mention that try to run as administrator I think fixed it. That or the forums, haven't had the problem so I can't fully say. You may have somehow installed it wrong. If your on a mac nothing I can really say.

I don't have a mac eaither so I can't say. My instructions only apply to windows."
,ReaperOne1Two2,2010-08-29T02:41Z,"@matlon 
Those server properties are generated inside a file called server the first time your run the server.exe basically. Then you open the server file with notepad and change online-mode from true to false so it should read online-mode=false instead of online-mode=true.

That only is for running a server to make it so it doesn't check if the players connecting are using a valid login. To play offline basically drag .minecraft into the folder using %appdata% in run, then running the launcher that was in a folder you downloaded. Then you just type in anything or leave it blank hit play then hit play offline.

If your not hosting a server you can ignore the minecraft server properties."

Already done that, basically all you can change is maxplayers and the server port and wether it should be online or offline.

It seems like that's the way it is right now, it's still in developement."

Did you try running the Minecraft on Windows 7 because I too have it on my Mac but when i ran it on that OS the mouse sensitivity in game would freak out. Did you experience this as well?"

1) If you see anyt that says like Player*gun*hold etc... ignore those and make sure your on the multiplayer screen when doing it there should only be one that has a value of just Player with widestring.

2) You didn't edit the server value to false. Check a few others asking it also on page 2.

@dzuwno
There's a few mods on the forums that have a workaround for the furnace and bucket. There's nothing that can be done about the rest till the game maker fixes it as it's just not programmed fully atm.

@calvinmc5
go to whatismyip to figure out your online ip and fully do the instructions. 

@JoinX same as dzuwno nothing can be done.

@totte1127 You just have to make sure you edit the name Player in memory editor before joining. How far are you getting with it?

@Fodalite If I remember the address generates a new one every time so I can't. There should be only one correct Player it sometimes shows up as Player | Just keep trying ones till you get the right one. It's normally 2nd one down.

@Leetn00b lol yah quite a few people didn't realise you have to hold click down to actually break stuff. You can't just single click it.

@DJX3 at best make sure all drivers are updated etc... other then that no."

Yes, if the server settings for online-mode=false and verify-names=false on the server. It's also the full game. Onlines a bit buggy at the moment.

Keep trying each one till you find the right one. They generally always spawn in the same spot on the list by default.

Drag the .minecraft folder to c:\Windows\Users\name\appdata
\roaming If I recall. IT should be something like that. The path I gave may not be 100% correct but should be pretty close.

@lamerlade
There's currently no fix for that in online as it's not fully programmed yet. You can kill critters with cactus and lava or falling. There's also no enemy npc's and bucket/forge is glitched badly without a server mod that can be found on the sites forums.

You need to use Player not player with a capital P.

For anyone getting the 3 widestring issues your not using Player is why it's doing that. Cap's count. This is why I couldn't seem to check why anyone was getting that.

@christian
Same issue as above. Fix it to Player not player and edit the only one that appears. IF somehow your still getting the issue WalterWulf007 has the other problem you may have. 

@WalterWulf007 
Your english is easily understood for the most. 

You don't actually need hamachi also to connect to servers unless you specifically want them. You can connect via internet to the servers even in offline mode. Best place to find servers currently is the forums."

Make sure he didn't somehow mess up verify-names=false and online-mode=false. There's literally no difference between this client and the bought one other then login names which if server has these set anyone can join.

You didn't replace the old .minecraft file in %appdata% under run.

If it doesn't go away after a few minutes on the first run of the game or when your running a farther distance and has random spikes for a bit due to new parts of the map loading make sure you have updated graphics etc... You can also try to run it in single core and see if that fixes it. Try asking there forums also they probably have a better solution.

     Bad video card drivers!      
      -----------------------      

Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.

No problem, trying my best to help out although I take a bit to respond due to other things. Well try to narrow this down to see what's causing it. 
I am fairly certain it is currently caused by the server setup not having the correct settings. If your not the serverhost make sure inside the server properties file that online-mode=false
and verify-names=false. I can also throw up a test server which I don't leave up normally for you to try on also.

@Blazinghavocx
You forgot to move the .minecraft folder to %appdata% under run.

It sounds like currently you have a firewall blocking connections or your ports are closed on your router. I added you and put the invitation comment as From TPB but you blocked me as if you have downsyndrome as soon as I said Hi.

@Antivenom
It may be a ports/firewall issue. If you leave an email I will add you and throw up a test server real quick for you to try on which will give the answer right away.

,EbilPhish,2010-09-09T13:09Z,"I made some instructions for Ubuntu users as the native libraries are not included on Ubuntu 10.04. They might be in the next Ubuntu 10.10 though.

Just dump the Minecraft.jar file anywhere you want (I made a dir in /opt which is the semi-official location for such packages)

Put .minecraft in your home directory.

Ubuntu users need the java monkey engine libraries. These are for Maverik but we can extract just the necessary .so file and it works fine:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/i386/liblwjgl-java-jni/download (this has .so file, 32bit gives error on my 64bit version)
http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/amd64/liblwjgl-java-jni/download (64bit version)

Extract the package with (Change package name):
dpkg -x ~/Downloads/liblwjgl-java-jni_2.4.2+dfsg-3_amd64.deb /tmp/lwjgl
Find the usr/lib/jni/liblwjgl.so and dump in in ~/.minecraft/bin/natives

java -jar /opt/Minecraft/Minecraft.jar

That should probably work, but you might also need to set your Java to the offical sun build, haven't tried it using the openjdk:
apt-get install sun-java6-jre (or is this sun-java6-jdk? just install both, you might need to add another repo or something, just Google it)
update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun

There is some error about libjinput-linux64.so but it doesn't seem to matter. You could probably track it down in packages.ubuntu.com and do the same extract thing if you want)."

1) Nope, there's no auto update with this as far as i'm aware of.

2) What have you tried to do the reskins?

Normally you just open the minecraft.jar in the bin folder within .minecraft in %appdata% using winzip then just drag and drop your new skin over the old one. Haven't tested reskins on multiplayer.

@bo_waleed55
Currently I don't want to go dl screencapping software to do that. Although when multiplayer is fully functioning I may make a picture one. If anyone else wants to take on a video one that would be nice.

all will need to do to play is follow this steps
1) Go to start and click in RUN ( or just press windows + r ) , when the menu opens type in the box %appdata%.
2) it will open a folder , so get the .minecraft folder ,you have downloaded ,and put it there ( in %appdata% that opened with your command )
3) Now open your Laucher ( see your OS laucher )
4) The game will open with a login screen , let it in blank , press ok and put play offilne =)



it worked for me and my friend try it out"
,Dragday,2010-09-11T14:51Z,"@S3BBY

7) Now to join your server go to multplayer and type 127.0.0.1
8) to your friend to your server get your ip ( type myip in google ) and send to your friend + the port of the game .
9) Remember to unblock minecraft and minecraft server at firewall.

,Dragday,2010-09-11T17:36Z,"@Dig1taL
Make sure u have searched for Player ( with capital in P ) and as string... i think if u search for player ( without capital ) it will find 3 players with widestring.
So search for Player

And to connect to your server try 127.0.0.1 instead if localhost"
,Dig1taL,2010-09-11T21:24Z,"Thanks, got it working :)
My sister connected from our network too.
Problem though - I can't delete or pick up any blocks. Why's that?

Also, if I close the server and open it again, will it make a new world? Because me and a friend want to make a world that we can both use and build up like, a whole town of buildings and things.

This wont work if the map changes every time the server closes. If that happens, how do I stop it from happening?"
,kyler45,2010-09-11T21:51Z,can you please upload the newest version?
,Dragday,2010-09-11T22:28Z,"@Dig1taL

i had the same problem of the blocks when i created for the first time. in the menu ( the screen you need to let open to run server )  type there save-off
them re-open your server .
everytime you want to save something in your world type in server screen save-all.

I had also problems to save what a have done in my world with my friend.
So i got a map from single player ( go to .minecraft/saves/ ) and you copy a world from there.. for example World3. Paste it at your server folder ( the folder that have server.properties ) .

Remeber also to change name level-name in server.proprerties to the current world you will use.

Try this =)"
,Dragday,2010-09-11T22:36Z,NEW VERSION PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
,Dig1taL,2010-09-12T00:55Z,"Thanks for your help Dragday :)

But just one question.
What do you mean the menu where I type save-off?

Do you mean in the server.properties file? Or in the place where I type 127.0.0.1? I'm confused, sorry."
,Dig1taL,2010-09-12T01:23Z,"I've also come across a few other problems.

,ReaperOne1Two2,2010-09-12T02:55Z,"@DiablousIgnis
You didn't move the .minecraft folder to the right location. Follow steps on where to put it or check a few of the pages, I had full path posted somewhere if you don't have run.

@S3BBY Do as Dragsays you don't log in with any account.

@TRWartune
The server host didn't put online-mode=false and verify-names=false inside the server files.

@Dragday thanks.

@Dig1tal 
Currently mobs can't take damage. The new version also has the same issue but actually has enemy mobs atleast. They can only die to lava etc...

As for a new world everytime that doesn't seem right. Run the server as administrator and don't play it till it says like done or something like that.
Also you can't break blocks in the spawn area within 30 squares. Just a note incase that was your no loot issue. I haven't ran into any save issues as dragday has.


@lauriraudla 
Yes, we do need someone who has a good source to put the newest versions. I'm going to check 4chan and a few others to see if they have the newest version yet. If I manage to be first to upload a torrent i'll put better instructions then what's around."

Anyways, for the most part everything seems to be going smoothly. However, I can't find a way to SAVE my stuff when on my LAN server.
The landscape and stuff stays, but my inventory empties out every time I relog, as do chests and stuff.

Is there any way around this?
