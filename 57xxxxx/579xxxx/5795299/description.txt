History Never Repeats - The Best Of Split Enz is a compilation of hits by New Zealand rock band Split Enz. Initially released in the US in 1987, then in NZ/Aus in 1989, the album has been through many variations and reissues over the years and probably stands as the band's best-selling compilation.

Released by the band's Northern Hemisphere record label A&M Records, this version included the band's hits on the label. It was re-packaged in 2002 as The Best Of Split Enz - The Millennium Collection as part of Universal Music's "20th Century Masters" budget-priced series.
