This is my first torrent so please don't hate on me, just tell me what I'm doing wrong!

This is the UK edition of In Your Honour (spelt the English way), which include the UK Bonus Track "The Sign". I figured since there aren't that many HE-AAC torrent out there, I thought I'd fill the gap for those who want to save space on their AAC players (these files will work on iPods, tested with my iPod Touch). Hopefully, this will be the first of many to come, if all goes well!

Bitrate: 80kbps (VBR) - encoded with the HE-AAC codec, so although the bitrate and file size may seem small, it is great quality!
