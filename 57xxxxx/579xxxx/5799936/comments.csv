All hail the ones that risk there necks and reputations to CAM movies and upload them.

DONT FORGET TO SEED ATLEAST A 1:2 RATIO, that means you've shared the movie with 2 more ppl(if im correct, correct me if im wrong) and have done your part in keeping the torrent community alive. I ALWAYS SEED BTW."

,7thSense,2010-09-14T11:12Z,"the movie isn't that bad. It's a stupid movie, but it has a handful of hilarious scenes that make it worth it. Everyone raved about the hangover which was entertaining, but doesn't make you LOL unless you're easily amused. But Macgruber isn't as good of a movie yet some of the funny scenes can make you roll."
,fuckerr,2010-09-14T21:42Z,"Hey guys please visit this guys torrents as well he needs our support n the quality of his torrents is as gud as FXG...n u can make ur requests to him as well...he'll definately try to fulfill them..click on the link below..

,griffinmills,2010-09-17T03:23Z,"""DONT FORGET TO SEED ATLEAST A 1:2 RATIO""

I agree with your sentiment but this isn't really a sustainable ratio don't you think?  At some point you'll need every person to take more than 1 copy of the movie in order to achieve this ratio..."

,ryan_ir,2010-09-19T02:52Z,To everyone who thought the acting was horrible obviously knows nothing about movies.  It is a parody type movie and it's more about cheesy lines and storyline than anything.  The acting was fine because that is what it what meant to be.  You just don't get the humor.
,raecy86,2010-09-19T21:41Z,"I love this movie!!  The acting is SUPPOSED to be horrible you guys.  Its a cheesy action flick.  If its not your style, just say so.  I think most ""romantic comedies"" are absolutely horrible, but I just dont watch em.  Hah.. Anyways, if you like cheesy movies, this is absolutely hilarious! My friend and I watched it last night and couldnt stop laughing the whole way through.  
Thanks for sharing it!"

,the-dude1982,2010-09-25T06:53Z,Hahahahahahaha funny movie :)
,Savestar,2010-09-25T16:28Z,"This movie had potential .It had a plot .It had some nice looking actors .It had all the outter structure .But inside was a tiny fart from the tiniest mouse on this goddamn world!
No jokes .Unless you consider ATTEMPTING to joke as jokes!
Lameness would be a proper susbtitute for the idea of comedy the writer must have thought of!
I not just wasted my time looking this movie to the end, to see if there EVER, EVER possible would be just one GOOD JOKE ..and there was not ..I also wasted time to download it ..
I can say only ONE THING good about this .That the download filled me with anticipation that it might be an awsome and hilarious movie .If The FXG team havent looked at this utter garbage before upload it, I can not blame them!
If they did knew, and they figured : Oh what the hell, there is probably a minority of big proportions out there, that MAYBE would like to see this lameness!
So for that a BIG THANKS FXG!
PS : Note to self : Spend more time reading others rating on PB! :)"

In fact, just a few months back I was on a Mythbuster marathon and after the ""macgyver special"" eppisode I'd decided to watch some of the show again, and it was hallarious how absolutlely stupid the show I loved as a kid as an adult..

I wonder how many people badmouthing this movie are off the generation mark enough to not even get the joke of what they're making fun of.."
