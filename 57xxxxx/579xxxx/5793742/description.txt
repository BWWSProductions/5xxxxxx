Rolf Zaeschmar is a longtime Columbine shooting researcher whoâ€™s been on the case for over ten years. His many writings on the internet, often posted under the handle, â€œStarviegoâ€, have introduced whole new audiences to a relatively unpublicized side of the attack, one which has been derived from the government documents related to it. In addition to working with the Columbine evidence, Rolf has also made connections between the profiles of other â€œrandom rageâ€ spree killings such as Red Lake, Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University. His work deserves the attention of anyone interested in any aspect of the mass shooting phenomenon which plagues society today. Rolf was good enough to talk to me and give his thoughts on the Columbine shootings and related events.
