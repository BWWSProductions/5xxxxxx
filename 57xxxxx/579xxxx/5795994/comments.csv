,Enemy_Hero,2010-09-04T05:17Z,"This isn't a HD rip. according to wikipedia ""Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will release a single disc DVD, a single disc Blu-ray, and a 3 disc Blu-ray combo-pack in the US on September 14, 2010"". So how could this rip be out yet? The video is good quality, but i wouldn't compare it to a Blu Ray. But the sound is shithouse, everytime i get a HD mp4 it has poorly encoded sound, usually AC3. The audio is full of chops, which makes it in sum parts unwatchable."
