LOSSLESS quality, recodec from FLAC to ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
using "ffmpeg -acodec alac" so is ready for drag and drop in iTunes.

Due to poor amount of Lossless hardcore, post-hardcore, metalcore,
deathcore, etc I'm starting a series of uploads sharing them myself
using other downloads from DD websites and blogs.

First torrent upload so I will accept any comment to improve next shares.
