NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Takers aka Bone Deep 2010

Right source was not too bad for a cam ,but suffered from a flicker,camera movement and the normal 
cam issues eg glares,colouring .....
We decided it was not worth the time it would take to cut this up into loads of pieces and crop and reszie each 
part.....if it was better Q then we would have.
What we did was maded a script and cropped everything we could without going into the film itself....then we added 
whitebalance,denoise,sharpen,rgb eq,brightness,contrast ,fix ivtc ,to the script and then dropped it into xpress to make a dvdr.
After all the work thr flicker is still there so you've been warned 

Oh the audio was just a straight forward strip and remux job.

Enjoy the flick
