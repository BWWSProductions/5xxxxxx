,CharlieTann,2010-08-28T19:34Z,I forgot to mention there is also a preview of EE in the rar as well. That's why there are 21 files instead of 20.
,tri895,2010-08-29T02:23Z,thanks man
,flirtygal1974,2010-08-30T05:11Z,someone please seed as i will too  
,CharlieTann,2010-08-30T06:17Z,"Flirtygal, i set the torrent for forced seeding at 400kb on vuze before i left for the weekend. i'm still a noob at this so i hope forced seeding didn't screw something up. hopefully there's no problems with my computer. "
,flirtygal1974,2010-09-01T07:01Z,"still nothing 0.0% :(  no ones seeding ?
I would really like to get this and any more  ."
,CharlieTann,2010-09-01T18:10Z,"i don't know what's going on. i made this torrent the same way i made others and there were no problems with them, i have it set at forced super seeding and last night i noticed there was 9 leechers so some people got it, didn't they? 
it might be my new fios modem/router but i'm able to seed the torrents i've downloaded."

But a BIG favor first... can you please seed for a while again? I am a MAJOR seeder of your first videos, but never got to finish episode#5. Can we get to the finish on this one? I will seed this for YEARS! "
