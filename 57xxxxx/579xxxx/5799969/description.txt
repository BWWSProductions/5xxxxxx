What is USB Block?
 

USB Block is a data leak prevention software that helps you prevent copy of your data to USB drives and CDs/DVDs that do not belong to you. It is a permission based software, once installed, the program asks you to set and confirm a password which it uses to allow access to your own USB drives, External drives, CDs, DVDs etc., while blocking every other drive. This prevents illegal copy, leakage and duplication of your private files and folders.

 

In addition to data leak prevention, USB Block also prevents spread of viruses and malware by not letting malicious USB Drives, CDs and DVDs access your PC without your permission (password). The program also blocks unauthorized network computers & non-system drives, keeping malicious activity as far away from your computers as possible. If you use your computer at home or have several PCs in your office, installing USB Block on every computer is your ticket to safe computing.

 

USB Block prompts for a password every time an external device is accessed. If you enter the correct password, the program allows full access to that drive, however if you deny access, no file can be copied or leaked from your PC to that drive. The program also maintains a list of authorized devices for you so that you wonâ€™t be prompted for the password next time. This way, you can allow access and transfer data to your own drives while continue to block others.

 

USB Block is unique not only because it offers data leak prevention by blocking all drives, devices, ports and slots from which data can be leaked; but because it blocks devices even in Safe Mode, making it impossible for hackers to copy data from your computer. Furthermore, the Program Files folder of USB Block and all the files contained in it are delete proof i.e., no one can delete and uninstall the program without your permission (password). 

 

USB Block also monitors and keeps a record of what devices have tried to access your PC by whom and when. Additionally the program also monitors and keeps a log of illegal program deletion attempts, unauthorized uninstall attempts as well as invalid password attempts.

 

Furthermore, you can also activate Stealth Mode to prevent from being discovered. USB Block works perfectly on all 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows 2008 Server, Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Window 2003 Server.
