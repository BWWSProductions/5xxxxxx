[V],globeplus,2010-08-27T20:01Z,"To trysis3 : you need to improve your attention reading the instructions.txt of the file , please read it carefully and then say something about it . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-27T20:03Z,Concluding the before comment you have 2 folders to be included on a converted folder after the close 15 minutes conversion work and that 2 folders have the music and the videos .
[V],globeplus,2010-08-27T20:10Z,Thank you to all the users that was expecting a new version of the file from me with the new skidrow crack and with all the videos with voices worked . thank you .
[V],globeplus,2010-08-27T20:53Z,"This DLCs file is reported from me (tested) as good to use with this super file , click on the link and follow the inside instructions :

[V],globeplus,2010-08-27T22:08Z,"As a work consideration i have to say about the videos and was forgetting to say that not only they really look very similar in the picture comparing to the originals but also the sound of the videos was improved a bit , not meaning with this that the originals have really low sound but the frequence of the sound not high as that and that can really depend on the cpmputer volome of the user , the basic volume is medium , so it looks not a complete confortable sound besides of course that you can heard the voices correctly , what i mean is and i am saying this without any desconsideration at all is that a little bit more high general volume help in the constant audio sound of the videos and just that . thank you ."

[V],globeplus,2010-08-27T23:08Z,"To thankuforurhardwork : thank youfor your point of view but it looks no matter what i do that my work is always somwhow beeing bullshitted , if i have 2 first files that i answered the requests of many users quickly as possible and followed the improve of the files best as possible and this with lot of work , now that i have the best file possible for this game it looks like doesnÂ´t really matter and many other files is already available but i do the work more positively as possible when it is possible following the interests of the users , somehow no matter how hard and positive is my work that it is looked like a banal thing or something and other guys with a bullshit work trying to look that they knows everything and his work is ok , well i always look in someway that i am beeing victim of a kind of scheme to importunate to the prism that the other guys want , like my work have some kind of trouble and they are detentors of the reason , well the true is that all of that is a lie and my work no matter what for more ridiculous are trying that my work looks is more competent and have more work , i just donÂ´t feel that it is correct having the best work and others looking better just because are spreading bullshit more as possible under the circunstances of the files , but beeing better or not my competent work is available and i was with the users since the first moment that was possible to do any work . Thank you and please donÂ´t take for seroius this general analysis of a hard work uploader that still beeing the best option for the users getting pratical files ."
,trysis3,2010-08-28T00:28Z,"Sorry globeplus but can you please tell me the names of the music folders and where can i put them ?

[V],globeplus,2010-08-28T12:17Z,"Hi everyone , i got yesterday a ocasional zone maintenance for my internet connection and i was about 11 hours waiting for my internet connection be back , the service says that probably just the normality now for long time as possible and maybe donÂ´t happen again in this close times , once in the while the internet service need to make a maintenance to keep the service in more good condition as possible to the internet users , before this one the last maintenance was more than a month ago but that donÂ´t have a fix period of time for that but certainly not be needed all the time . I am back and the file now start going with normality again just keep your downloadings speeds and thanks to the users that was helping more as possible under the circunstances but this type of things are needed times to times to keep the best quality on the service . Now , to trysis3 : you have a folder called music with 3 other folder inside , Game  ,Menu and Radio , you move the music folder and the video folder to the sds folder after the conversion work , it is very strange you are asking me that because that is clearly in the instructions.txt that comes with the file , to hiteshbit16 : i already work the lost planet many time ago i think you mean the upcoming lost planet 2 , well it is no doubt that if it is possible i will work all the new upcoming pc games better as possible , the users can count on me for that . thank you and now everything back to normality ."

Thank you!"
[V],globeplus,2010-08-28T19:23Z,"To mafiaPlayer : that is not usual as that but use trainer like this . run the trainer then run the game executable , when you are really inside the game playing press the Numpad1 key and thatÂ´s it you will have forever the maximum health but the keys on the trainer because they work are not to be joking around , i mean that donÂ´t click on the numpad keys that give the extra functions defined by the trainer constantly , so in this perspective , run the trainer , run the executable and click when itis possible inside the game less as possible on the keys to get the functions , like that is more safe and the numpad functions for weapons are only avaibale at points of the game that you can use guns , so the trainer work fine but inside the game and respecting the more as possible the gameplay of the game , clicking to many times on the keys in a constant way can originate circunstancial crashes because the user is changing attributed values to give the functions all the time , so using the trainer be more disciplinated as possible using for example the functions of the trainer whhen they are possible to be used and always with the game really running not at the menus . i hope this help but i still saying that is usual as that but never mind ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-28T19:34Z,"TRAINER OPTIONS : NUMPAD1 - unlimited life (click once inside the game , NUMPAD2 - no reload , NUMPAD3 - unlimited ammo and NUMPAD6 - all weapons , this 3 numpad keys is to be clicked once in places of the game where the guns can be used , NUMPAD4 - unlimited money (click once when money it is accesible and necessary) and finally NUMPAD5 - unlimited timer (click once when driving for example) , i hope with this this the trainer users get the correct way to use the trainer . HAPPY GAMING ..."

,xXENDGAMEXx,2010-08-30T11:31Z,Well just follow given instructions game works great even on the 8400 geforce gs jsut play in low resolution . As for the game awesome graphics nice sound but realism was not thought of by the devs U can assure you of that. I can take multiple bullets in first chapter and live you get to where you fight the guy after u come come its retarded you can pound the shit outta him but he can just throw one simple jab and ur done i mean talk about stupid?
,tacos4uced,2010-08-31T04:52Z,ok so i installed copyed  and i click mafia II it starts to load then crashes to desktop has any one had this problem or know how to fix it

Dude having The Same Problem"
,absoliutusblogis,2010-09-01T12:54Z,"Globe, can you please upload the right music file, or I'm doing something wrong (by not doing anything) that don't hear any radio stations. Also, I have this weird screen blipping of fog after the 1st mission which was with no screen blinking. Any ideas?

,kekozauros,2010-09-01T21:32Z,"Ehm, I know this kinda of a silly question, but bare in mind that I'm still new to this, the first instruction says that your suppose to extract the ""arc"" file. The problem is, I can't find the ""arc"" file :P So, where do I find it? :P"
,absoliutusblogis,2010-09-02T19:59Z,"So. I somehow managed to fix the blinking screen and death by one blow just by restarting the game from mission 1. The music is still missing. Again, please, Globe, upload the music files. Thanks."

[V],globeplus,2010-09-08T00:18Z,"To Joekker : beside the effort in create amusing files in a Batman enemy style you still need to keep your attention to interpretate well the work and you get doubts in things that can be obvious , my text is more than understandable and this to the absoliutusblogis user because the real problem was that he didnÂ´t follow the instructions correctly , i donÂ´t have the intention to win a prize for my english but certainly understandable enough to the normal use of the files and they are lot of files out there in many years to comprove that and finally just to say that the new dlc Jimmys Vendetta is tested and approved for this file , just use the piratebay search , happy gaming everyone  and letÂ´s try to make sense with ourselfs when criticising the others . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-09-08T00:20Z,"JimmyÂ´s vendetta is tested and approved to this file. Thank you and i donÂ´t work the dlc because he have a short size and the work on the dlc files are good enough for not justifying my work , so please just use the piratebay search to get the dlc ."
