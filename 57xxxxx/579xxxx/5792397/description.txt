Release Notes:
Right...sorry on delay, been at work and that , anyway as we took a little longer to release...thought id do a nice
encode of it...and of course is jennifer aniston , anyway, used the video from UG Thanks...loaded into vdub, fixed
the brightness a little, lowered contrast to make it not so bright on the eyes..lowered the chroma, and then the
rgb colours, tweaking them all pretty hard. Used a deflicker filter as it had a slight strobing effect going through 
it, and a really light smoothness filter. Overall imho video looks pretty good...we chose the UG Video as it slightly
less cropped top and bottom , Video compressed very well...hence the smaller size.....

On another note....we are looking for 1 more video encoder, and 1 more audio syncer to join us, feel free to get in
