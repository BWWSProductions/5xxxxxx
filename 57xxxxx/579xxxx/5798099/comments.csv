,1124,2010-09-03T22:08Z,No i dident say it was the loders fault.I was only asking for help. i have tried WMP and GOM player. the problems are at the same spot. could it be my uTorrent. i know that if you watch a movie that isnt 100% its the same problem. I suspect that is the problem. it says 100% but it isent?

I suspect that is the problem. it says 100% but maybe it isent? I Have experienced this problem whit a lot o downloads.
,Vegasbob,2010-09-19T12:25Z,no I have to agree i've been useing GOM player with these same eztv torrents for TB for awhile now and for some reason the last half of this season something the did to the encodeing is makeing it hitch and glitch randomly in the program now. Never had this problem before wit eztv torrents so I don't know what's going on. I will try VLC but I do not like it as it does not have a way to set the left/right arrow keys to go +/- 5 seconds like in GOM.
