\\\"Not your usual Laserdance album, \\\"Ambiente\\\" instead lives up to its name and offers more of a space opera-style beautiful journey through peaceful star systems. The two tracks dedicated to D.M. van Vliet \\\"The New Reunion\\\" and \\\"Timeless Zone\\\" make a comeback from the last album \\\"Changing Times\\\" and fit much better into this setting, than the fast paced dancy predecessor. Perhaps this album can be seen as a more thorough way to express the loss.\\\"
