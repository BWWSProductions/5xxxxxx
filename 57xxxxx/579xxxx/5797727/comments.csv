,abccba2,2010-09-10T23:00Z,"I've tried to download this torrent several times over the last week, but there is a problem with TPB's hosting of the torrent file and it won't download.  All other torrents are OK.  Guess this will die unless someone re-lists it with a new torrent.  Shame, I really wanted this and can't find it anywhere else."
,abccba2,2010-09-14T12:13Z,Update:  The torrent won't download but the magnet link does work in utorrent but not in vuze!

,trubs1,2011-08-18T08:58Z,This is not GB Ordinance Survey maps. It appears to be a vector map with the addition of trig points. It a single .img file to get it into map source you need to split it back to tile files. see gpsundergound to find out how.
