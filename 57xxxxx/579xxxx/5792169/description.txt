Overview:	Tian Yuan is a mercenary tasked to destroy the Shaolin Temple from the inside. Disguised as Liao Kong, a holy monk of the Golden Light Temple, Tian Yuan challenges the High Priest of Shaolin for the rule of the temple.
While Tian Yuin is defeating the High Priest, the Royal Guards of Emperor Tang overrun the Shaolin Temple, killing all in their path. But a small band of Shaolin disciples escape with the Holy Robe. Without the Robe, Tian Yuan will never rule Shaolin. Truly spectacular battle scenes and authentic training sequences make the quest for the Holy Robe an unforgettable journey. This is the full uncut original release of this classic, newly remastered! 

Cast:	Yu Rong Guang  ||  Donnie Lee  ||  Mandy Chow  ||  Lo Han Ma Holy Robe of Shaolin Temple is a great 80's martial arts flick that fits in alongside movies like THE SOUTH SHAOLIN MASTER. It's a superbly shot and choreographed film with a ton of great acrobatic fast fights.

The tone of the film is pretty serious throughout and the film doesn't fall prey to bad comedic moments alot of other films from the period unfortunatley did.

While it's not exactly a classic, it's a film that's worth seeing if your a fan of the genre as it has some great fight scenes similar to those in SOUTH SHAOLIN MASTER and MARTIAL ART MASTER WONG FEI HUNG and shows the origins of Yu Rongguang who was in some of the better 90's era films like IRON MONKEY, although in this film he plays a villian.

another bonus is that the DVD version is widescreen,
