,naveed094,2010-08-30T09:52Z,I think its same.
,yesbos,2010-08-30T10:28Z,"Jaxx89 & naveed094, Guys both are same, and both are ripped from same source dvd. Different is quality, this version has low resolution, low bit rate and low sound quality than 1.4G version. (Actually different is cant identify, if u just watch this release.) I suggest u gust to download the sample file at both versions. Then decide, whether u need good quality bigger size version or normal quality. If fact, if the movie length is less than 120min, then 700mb version has better quality,and u loss only 5.1audio. If the movie is worst, obviously don't need better quality too. So its up to u decide which to download. Just try what i mentioned above and say thanx to uploader. :)"
