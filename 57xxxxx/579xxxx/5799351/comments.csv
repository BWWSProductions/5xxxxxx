playing FLVs shouldnt be a problem to no one now a days."
,cheater71,2010-09-05T22:57Z,"I've never seen a good quality FLV. You always upload the lowest quality stuff, sometimes cut up into several parts in the worst formats. 

If anyone wants good quality uploads keep looking. You won't find them here. I think he just downloads the dubbed streams and uploads them. "
