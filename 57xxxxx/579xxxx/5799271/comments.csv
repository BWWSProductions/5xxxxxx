I wonder what is on your list for this month? .. Would you consider ""Secret Window ""

That's because of the letterbox... the black bar below and above a movie... if those are included it should amount to 720... those black bar arent included while ripping/reencoding because it's just a waste and would only trouble certain monitor size... 

Thanks for this RiddlerA... I'm just downloading it for collection.. have seen it in cinema before and I regret it.. it's not a very good movie, but maybe my nieces and nephews would like it... thanks! Any chance you'd do 12 monkeys and Sliders soon?... ;P"

audio is a bit overblown (if you go above 150% it gets clippy). nonetheless all dialogue is clear.

video wobbles sometimes, but i'm not too sure if  it's a ""desert water vapour"" effect. doesn't seem to be so. otherwise, the 720p quality is pretty good most parts.

movie is great!"
