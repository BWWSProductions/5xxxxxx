,funkywds,2010-08-30T04:41Z,why rars?  WHY!?!
,ciocio800,2010-08-30T04:50Z,"Because this whole business thrives when people DON'T seed, duh.  Everyone knows that..."
,carlseverson,2010-08-30T04:50Z,I am confused... I thought this wasn't airing until monday due to the Emmys.... yet it's probably not a fake as I have downloaded some of your torrents before... I'll find out I guess
,plzseedthistorrent,2010-08-30T04:53Z,I would wait IMO
,sonozx,2010-08-30T04:58Z,"why ? why? why? why? ...hah?

,stoever90,2010-08-30T04:58Z,Thanks! Great speed for me atleast! I will keep seeding all day :0)
,Aethenoth,2010-08-30T05:02Z,Wish it wasnt rar'd but its the first one loaded.
,Aethenoth,2010-08-30T05:04Z,"@carlseverson wiki episode guide shows it airing tonight, so I'm leaning on real.. let you know in a few minutes"
,toeFloss,2010-08-30T05:04Z,seriously rars ? get fucked

,carlseverson,2010-08-30T05:17Z,"HBO.ca says it's airing monday... On HBO.com, it's airing tonight. Go figure. "
,juliet33,2010-08-30T05:18Z,"I am new to this so please bear with me, I apologize in advance, but what is RAR?"
,stoever90,2010-08-30T05:20Z,Its real. And why are u complaining about rar.? takes 2 minutes to unzip it :p 
,shampy26,2010-08-30T05:21Z,0/74 seeding.. heh first isn't always best. plus i got a virus detected when i started.. so not going to trust this. i don't even see this torrent when i search anymore!
,juliet33,2010-08-30T05:23Z,ty
,juliet33,2010-08-30T05:29Z,"I got a warning as soon as I came on the site, is this normal?"
,ElmoHatesMudbloods,2010-08-30T05:35Z,"If it was on tonight I would think there would be several uploads by now...but he also has a green skull. Got like 3 hours until it is finished, so who knows."

,ReekRend2,2010-08-30T05:40Z,"That's weird, this page currently says 82 seeds but the swarm is downloading as if there's only one and we're all at the same %."
,dukikobra,2010-08-30T05:42Z,"its still airing on EZTV!!!!!!!!!

,WOLFiZNASTY,2010-08-30T05:42Z,"It takes 1min to extract Rar files, why complain.

Anyways this if the fastest ive ever dled and episode, reaching 1mbs.. 

ill post in a bit but im sure its real thx scene."
,dukikobra,2010-08-30T05:44Z,why rars ffs
,KP001,2010-08-30T05:47Z,What are rars?  Im new to this.....
,ReekRend2,2010-08-30T05:49Z,"Ask anyone who already watched it, it did air tonight.

RAR = google it.  And really it's annoying but bitching that hard?  Upload your own.

Sometimes ads/comments here try to inject redirects to malware pages, get a decent antivirus and reload the page or go back or stop the redirect from loading.

I don't think it's fake but they did get it up the fastest I've seen after airing..."
,WebPersona,2010-08-30T05:55Z,"I've heard it provides a measure of safety for the up loader to convert to rar's.  That way, they aren't uploading an episode of T.B. just a bunch of compressed files. Idk for sure though."
,ElmoHatesMudbloods,2010-08-30T05:57Z,@WOLFiZNASTY 1mbs? No you are not you fucking liar.
,Reviewer,2010-08-30T06:03Z,"You people bitch soooo fucking much when it comes to free uploads. Honestly who cares if it's a RAR, if your computer takes more then 30 secs. to unrar a file, then you probably shouldnt be here to begin with. 30 secs out of your pathetic lives. 

Yes it's real, yes it aired tonight on HBO regardless of the emmys, (which it did not win). Next epidsode will be Sept. 12 and if you dont like RARs EzTV and TvTeam already uploaded theirs."
,juliet33,2010-08-30T06:04Z,Im soo confused
,juliet33,2010-08-30T06:06Z,@ REEK- Thanks- not getting comments all at once- and damn some of ya'll are moody as fuck!@
,juliet33,2010-08-30T06:21Z,.
,Sharak23,2010-08-30T06:59Z,"lol seeds went down from 46 to 12 since I started the torrent. Thanks for seeding once you got yours. 

 While this is a new torrent, ATLEAST seed for the next 2 hours while you go watch the show. That is not asking for alot. ATLEAST, because it is a new torrent and needs seeds!!!!!!!"
,Wykd_Wolf,2010-08-30T07:08Z,It's NOT real. Inside the first rar is a SECOND rar that is password protected.
,WhoDateBeDare,2010-08-30T08:38Z,"OK, newbie day 2.
Happy to share my bandwidth within reason.

Anyone care to comment on what to set my download and upload speeds to.  In a way thats fair?

Or perhaps to post a hyperlink to instructions discussing uTorrent and this site.

Convert me now while I'm interested.

I had sworn off torrents 5 years ago as I got caught out with 'cooking bad' episodes uploading far far more that I down loaded.

Also, I pay for my bandwidth here.

It's not part of a package deal.
So I can't start it and go to bed.
I have to baby sit it.

,Aethenoth,2010-08-30T09:04Z,Torrent is fake. 549MB file extracts to a 19MB video clip. Check out EZTV for a faster reliable d/l. so pissed at this one.. i have class at 8am and im trying to stay up to d/l so i can watch this...
,WhoDateBeDare,2010-08-30T09:48Z,"""Check out XXXX for a faster reliable d/l""
Is that spam or can anyone else confirm for a newbie day 2?
one from immerse
one from fqm 
which one?"
,tarball8,2010-08-30T09:53Z,"RARs are pointless.   They offer no advantages.   The technical reasons offered for distributing RARs in a torrent make no sense.

RARs do offer disadvantages though.  Not so much the inconvenience of unpacking.  Mostly it's keeping around an extra set of files just to seed long term, which most people don't want to do.  I know don't.   Why not just see from the playable file?   You can't download a single file, or see the actual file names of the package either.

Still, it's a minor issue & Kudos to the team."
,fuzzy30,2010-08-30T10:04Z,"10kb - the torrent takes days. 3233 seeders? i guess nobody is seeding, can anyone tell me why the true blood torrents are the slowest of all time!"
,greenclown,2010-08-30T20:56Z,its real.. just decompress one of the rar files and theyll all decompress into one complete avi file.
,hypnotoadtrance,2010-09-11T22:41Z,"I can attest to the speed.

1.6 mbps easily.

And that's including the fact that I use Comcast, which THROTTLES torrents."
