Tweaked the video here and there its actually better than the screens make out ....


Raised the saturation a touch added a sharpen filter hence the bit extra file size and altered my fave input/output levels filter to try and sort out the brightness..Got rid of some of the orange colouring thats throughout..Its still not great but its not too bad really

This is labelled a cam as the others are wrong its not direct line audio just pretty good cam audio ....

Enjoy
