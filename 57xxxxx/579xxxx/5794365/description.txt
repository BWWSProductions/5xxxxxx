Here we go with our version of The Other Guys not the greatest screener non the less a
watchable one.We want to thank our friends are IMAGINE for letting us have it.
We did our normal stuff to it we brighten the movie along with saturation,contrast,
denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it.We cropped the black bars and we blurred what 
was left of the timer after cropping. Many thanks to IMAGINE.We did our best with it
and still has some faults but all in all not bad.You have been warned.Hope you all enjoy 
from team FLAWL3SS
