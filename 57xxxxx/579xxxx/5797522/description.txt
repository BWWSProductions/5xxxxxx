2006 After The Goldrush â€“ The Dawn/Pye Anthology 1973-1977    CD  Castle Music CMDDD1 430 

A Geordie folk trio (Brian and Irene were husband and wife) from Gateshead who first attracted attention when their cover of Neil Young's â€œAfter The Goldrushâ€ made it to No. 21 in the UK and No. 22 in the US. This track was also included on their first album, which is well worth a spin and on the â€œHas It Dawned On You?â€ compilation. It is sung accepela (without instruments). Much of their material was melodic with harmony vocals and acoustic guitar. There are similarities to David Crosby and Steve Stills here, but their music was influenced by US country-rock too.
