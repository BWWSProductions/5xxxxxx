                    How Not to Cry at Weddings.              
                    Everyone is getting ready for the wedding -  
                    Clegg wonders if his suit smells of mothballs;  
                    Alvin flirts with Stella when she returns from  
                    the hairdressers; Hobbo thinks he needs to go  
                    for the sympathy vote; and Toby is determined  
                    to look his best at the wedding in order to win  
                    back his ex-wife. Everyone arrives at the pub  
                    for the wedding, but Glenda receives a call to  
                    say the bridegroom has done a runner so they  
                    head off with a weary bus driver who promises  
                    to take them all to a nice restaurant.
