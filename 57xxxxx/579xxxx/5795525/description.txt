Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming

Starred Review. Oreskes and Conway tell an important story about the misuse of science to mislead the public on matters ranging from the risks of smoking to the reality of global warming. The people the authors accuse in this carefully documented book are themselves scientistsâ€”mostly physicists, former cold warriors who now serve a conservative agenda, and vested interests like the tobacco industry. The authors name these scientistsâ€”all with powerful connections in government and the mediaâ€”including Robert Jastrow, Frederick Seitz, and S. Fred Singer. Seven compelling chapters detail seven issues (acid rain, the dangers of smoking and secondhand smoke, the ozone hole, global warming, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the banning of DDT) in which this group aimed to sow seeds of public doubt on matters of settled science. They did so by casting aspersions on the science and the scientists who produce it. Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at UCâ€“San Diego, and science writer Conway also emphasize how journalists and Internet bloggers uncritically repeat these charges. This book deserves serious attention for the lessons it provides about the misuse of science for political and commercial ends. (June)

Review

â€œNaomi Oreskes and Erik Conway have demonstrated what many of us have long suspected: that the â€˜debateâ€™ over the climate crisis--and many other environmental issues--was manufactured by the same people who brought you â€˜safeâ€™ cigarettes.  Anyone concerned about the state of democracy in America should read this book.â€â€”Former Vice President Al Gore, author of An Inconvenient Truth

â€œAs the science of global warming has grown more certain over the last two decades, the attack on that science has grown more shrill; this volume helps explain that paradox, and not only for climate change. A fascinating account of a very thorny problem.â€â€”Bill McKibben, author of Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet

â€œNaomi Oreskes and Erik Conway have written an important and timely book. Merchants of Doubt should finally put to rest the question of whether the science of climate change is settled.  It is, and we ignore this message at our peril.â€â€”Elizabeth Kolbert, author of Field Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate Change

â€œThere can be no science without doubt: brute dogma leaves no room for inquiry. But over the last half century, a tiny minority of scientists have wielded doubt as a political weapon to halt what they did not want said: that tobacco kills or that the climate is warming because of what we humans are doing. â€˜Doubt is our productâ€™ read a tobacco memo--and indeed, millions of dollars have gone into creating the impression of scientific controversy where there has not been one. This book about the politics of doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway explores the long, connected, and intentional obfuscation of science by manufactured controversy. It is clear, scientifically responsible, and historically compellingâ€”it is an essential and passionate book about our times.â€â€”Peter Galison, Joseph Pellegrino University Professor, Harvard University, author of Einsteinâ€™s Clocks, PoincarÃ©â€™s Maps

â€œWith the carefulness of historians and the skills of master storytellers, Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway lay out the sordid history of tobacco industry protectionists, who framed the debate as scientifically â€˜unproven,â€™ gaining decades of market share for those merchants of deathâ€”who knew all along the risks of their products. Merchants of Doubt shows that some of the very same individuals were part of the plans to frame the climate change debate as unproven, using the same tried and true tactics of misrepresentation of facts, non-representative scientists, and industry-friendly legislators. Again, tried and true public re-framing of reality worked. But now all this chicanery is exposed for the deception it has been in Oreskes and Conwayâ€™s powerful and timely work.â€â€”Stephen H Schneider, Professor, Stanford University, author of Science as a Contact Sport: Inside the Battle to Save Earthâ€™s Climate

â€œA well-documented, pulls-no-punches account of how science works and how political motives can hijack the process by which scientific information is disseminated to the public.â€â€”Kirkus Reviews

â€œSweeping and comprehensiveâ€¦ Oreskes and Conway do an excellent job of bringing to life a complex and important environmental battleâ€¦ [a] darkly fascinating historyâ€¦ Merchants of Doubt is an important book. How important? If you read just one book on climate change this year, read Merchants of Doubt. And if you have time to read two, reread Merchants of Doubt.â€ â€”Grist.org

â€œNaomi Oreskes and Erik Conway smoke out the Merchants of Doubt.â€â€”Vanity Fair

â€œIn their impeccably researched genealogy of denialism Merchants of Doubt, Conway and Oreskes show that a key group of figures in global warming denial earned their spurs in tobacco-industry-funded attempts to discredit the links between smoking and cancer. "â€”New Humanist

â€œBrilliantly reported and written with brutal clarityâ€¦ The real shocker of this book is that it takes us, in just 274 brisk pages, through seven scientific issues that called for decisive government regulation and didn't get it, sometimes for decades, because a few scientists sprinkled doubt-dust in the offices of regulators, politicians and journalistsâ€¦Oreskes and Conway do a great public service.â€â€”Huffington Post

â€œIn their fascinating and important study, Merchants of Doubt, Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway offer convincing evidence for a surprising and disturbing thesis. Opposition to scientifically well-supported claims about the dangers of cigarette smoking, the difficulties of the Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars", the effects of acid rain, the existence of the ozone hole, the problems caused by secondhand smoke, andâ€”ultimatelyâ€”the existence of anthropogenic climate change was used in "the service of political goals and commercial interests" to obstruct the transmission to the American public of important informationâ€¦Because it is so thorough in disclosing how major policy decisions have been delayed or distorted, Merchants of Doubt deserves a wide readership. It is tempting to require that all those engaged in the business of conveying scientific information to the general public should read it.â€â€”Science

â€œMerchants of Doubt, by the science historian Naomi Oreskes and the writer Erik Conway, investigates a sort of reverse conspiracy theory: ecoterrorists and socialists are not the ones foisting dubious science upon us; rather it is deniers who are running their own well-funded and organized long-term hoax. Several previous works have ably illuminated similar themes, but this one hits boneâ€¦[Merchants of Doubt]  provide[s] both the historical perspective and the current political insights needed to get a grip on what is happening now.â€â€”OnEarth

â€œAll in all, Oreskes and Conway paint an unflattering picture of why some scientists continue to stand against the overwhelming scientific consensus on issues at the center of public discussion.â€â€”USA Today

â€œEver wonder how the terms liberty and freedom got all tangled up in fake science, how industry friendly think-tanks got their start, or what motivates scientists to sell out beyond the obvious? Merchants of Doubt expertly follows the historical twists and turns to answer all those questions and more in exquisite detail translated into entertaining narratives easily digested by readers from all backgroundsâ€¦ This book should be a staple for any scientist and progressive, especially those whose work intersects public policy. Merchants of Doubt will not only leave you better equipped to combat the propaganda now packaged and fed to an unsuspecting public as legitimate science on a daily basis, it is a meticulously researched and wonderfully written.â€â€”Daily Kos

â€œAfter enduring decades of inexplicably persistent news reports casting doubt on the fact that cigarettes cause lung cancer, pollution harms the planet, and nuclear weapons are extremely dangerous, one might be forgiven for wondering if the same mob of misguided mercenaries might be behind them all.

â€œAn important book â€¦ The next time a friend or Fox News commentator or political candidate assaults you with the claim that â€˜climate change isn't happening or â€˜isn't caused by human activities,â€™ you will recognize the source of their colossal misunderstanding. The good news is, honest science wins in the end. The bad news: The earth is heating up while this artificially heated debate rages, though Merchants of Doubt, if widely read, should help douse the media flames.â€ â€”Minneapolis Star Tribune

â€œMerchants of Doubt might be one of the most important books of the year. Exhaustively researched and documented, it explains how over the past several decades mercenary scientists have partnered with tobacco companies and chemical corporations to help them convince the public that their products are safe â€“ even when solid science proves otherwiseâ€¦Merchants of Doubt is a hefty read, well-researched and comprehensiveâ€¦I hope it sells, because what it has to say needs to be heard.â€â€”Christian Science Monitor
