Have seen one of your old torrents - Jay Graydon 6-cd. Would it be ossible to reactivate it again????

If not all of them then the two live albums - it would be fantastic if you could make it.

Thanx in advance

Pushing my luck here :-)

Would you have a copy of the Jay Graydon Live in Japan all star concert- if you do could you PLEEEEEEZZZZZZ load it up. Have been looking everywhere for it - with little luck.

Thanx again - Jennerden"
