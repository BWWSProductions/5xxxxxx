I will continue seeding it for a week or two with a few pauses, I guess, then it's up to other people to keep it alive...
And big thanks to those who made the rip's!
You know who you are."

Doesn't anyone have a dvd of ""Oh Brother""? Please rip (DivX 720x416 or better, app. 700MB, eventually make two parts if necessary) and upload.
It's the only missing Coen Bros at TPB, exept for the .iso containing a video ts folder of 4,26GB size."
