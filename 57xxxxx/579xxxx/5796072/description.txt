This is a collection of 12 Coen Brothers films. They are all rips found on TPB - none ripped by me.
I just upload it now, as I can't seem to find other active torrents for their fantastic catalog.

("Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" is missing, since all I found is a "video ts" folder of no interest.)

The films included are all DivX encoded .avi files of good quality (full length, no trailers):

Barton Fink
Blood Simple
Burn After Reading
Crimewave
Fargo
Millers Crossing
No Country For Old Men
Raising Arizona
The Big Lebowsky
The Hudsucker Proxy
The Ladykillers
The Man Who Wasn't There

And throwing a bone for the enthusiasts, as well:

The original "Ladykillers" from 1955 w/ P. Sellers and Sir Alec Guinness is included for comparision.
