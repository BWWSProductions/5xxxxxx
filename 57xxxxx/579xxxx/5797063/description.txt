                   The No Asshole Rule â€“ Robert I. Sutton

We all know them or know of themâ€“the jerks and bullies at work who demean, criticize, and sap the energy of others, usually their underlings. It could be the notorious bad boss or the jealous coworker, but everyone agrees that they make life miserable for their victims and create a hostile and emotionally stifling environment. Fed up with how these creeps treat others and poison the workplace, Sutton declares war and comes out calling them exactly what they areâ€“â€certified assholes.â€ Caricatured in sitcoms such as The Office, these brutes are too often tolerated until irreparable damage is done to individuals and the organization as a whole. Suttonâ€™s â€œno asshole ruleâ€ puts a stop to the abuse in no uncertain terms. Similar rules have transformed such companies as JetBlue, the Menâ€™s Wearhouse, and Google into shining examples of workplaces where positive self-esteem creates a more productive, motivated, and satisfied workforce. If you have ever been a victim, just reading Suttonâ€™s analysis brings calm relief, empowerment, and reassurance that youâ€™re not alone.
