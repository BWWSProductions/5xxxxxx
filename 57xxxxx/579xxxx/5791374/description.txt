Two men fortify a nondescript British apartment so it can serve as a prison, and then kidnap a woman and tie her to a bed.

Vic and Danny are a pair of ex cons who spend several days elaborately soundproofing and reinforcing the walls of a small apartment. Vic is hard edged and domineering with a fierce suspicious streak, while Danny is weak willed and will do nearly anything Vic asks of him. We soon learn what Vic and Danny were planning as they grab a young woman off the street, take her back home and tie her to the bed. The young woman is named Alice Creed, and she comes from a wealthy family; after taking some snapshots of her, Vic fires off a ransom demand to her father, asking for Â£2 million in exchange for Alice\'s safe return. Vic is convinced he\'s executing the perfect crime, but it becomes apparent that not everything is going as planned; Alice is smarter and more resourceful than he imagined, and Danny\'s allegiances can be manipulated in ways Vic never anticipated...
