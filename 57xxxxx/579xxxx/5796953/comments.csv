http://download.wbr.com/inceptionscore/InceptionBonusTracks.zip

If the link requires you to login, simply go to http://www.inceptionscore.com/ â€” the button to click is center-bottom of the page. You can supply any E-mail address you like, as the download occurs directly in the browser versus them sending you some sort of custom download link.

Finally, I note the following about the two tracks:

13. Projections

Primarily a compilation of cues from other tracks on the album. While it's nice to have it for the sake of completeness, there's very little (if anything) new here.

14. Don't Think of Elephants

This is the real winner in the batch, and in fact it's surprising that it wasn't included on the album proper. It contains the cue from the zero-gravity hotel hallway fight, the cues from when the van is plummeting from the bridge, and a couple of other elements that are not found elsewhere in other tracks on the album."
