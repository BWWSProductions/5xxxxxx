They finally put the two bonus tracks up online for free download: http://download.wbr.com/inceptionscore/InceptionBonusTracks.zip

But I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m sure most of you, like me, don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really want to download from Warner Bros. So I included it in a torrent with a bunch of trackers so that should in the invent warner bros take that link down or track the downloaders from it everybody has an alternative download method.

The two tracks are in mp3 320kbps format, drm free, and official.

You can find the rest of the soundtrack to inception in FLAC format here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5689674/Inception_OST_-_Hans_Zimmer_-_FLAC


Enjoy :)
