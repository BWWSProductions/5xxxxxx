,LittleMrJ,2010-11-02T22:28Z,"This is NOT an English version. On install, you're promted to choose either Spanish, French, or Italian. The spoken dialog is the only thing in English, but there's no way to turn off the subtitles, & all the menus & in-game control panels will be in the language you choose at install... NOT worth it, unless you're fluent in (or studying) one of the 3 languages... This is a reseed of an older torrent which was properly posted as 'Deus Ex 2 - French/Italian/Spanish'... I have no idea why 'Eng' is in the title here. Lame."

Had you read the title closely you would note that you have spoken language and subtitle.  The title says it is a DVD5 Eng sub Ita, meaning spoken language is English subtitles are Italian.  Pay more attention and you might not make stupid comments about not know why it says Eng in the title."
