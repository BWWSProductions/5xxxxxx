THAT'S MESSED UP THAT YOU'RE ATTACKING PEOPLE LIKE THIS, ANON."
,qwertyDave,2011-03-09T06:30Z,"This is not a virus. This is a simple pdf that passes the scans of an up-to-date Avast! antivirus scan. 

The book is a good copy of the original. I have the paperback copy of the book, and this pdf is exactly what I would want from a pdf version. 

Again...not a virus. Not even a false positive. "
