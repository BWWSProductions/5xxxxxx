Plot:
Fisherman Matthew Boyd (Richard Dreyfuss) is fishing in Lake Victoria, AZ when a small earthquake hits, splitting the lake floor and causing a whirlpool. Boyd falls in and is ripped apart by a school of prehistoric piranhas that emerge from the chasm and ascend the vortex.
Jake Forester (Steven R. McQueen) is admiring attractive tourists in Lake Victoria as Spring Break begins. He reunites with his old crush, Kelly (Jessica Szohr), before being chased off by her boyfriend. He meets Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell) an eccentric pornographer, and Danni (Kelly Brook), one of his actresses. Derrick convinces Jake to show him the hot spots on the beach for filming a pornographic film.
