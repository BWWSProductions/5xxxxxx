,Yaggy,2010-09-04T20:30Z,"Sorry mate. There ain't nothin' I can do about that. Bound by the ISP uploading speed, which is not very exciting. A typical DVD9 takes about 3-4 days to download. I will be seeding till a good 100 downloads take place. So, please don't fret. You'll get it sooner or later.

Good things to those who wait!!!"
