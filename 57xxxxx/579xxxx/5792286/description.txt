You see, the letter â€œLâ€ was well-represented in my media library even before I caught Gaga-fever. Very well-represented. Hence the â€œ[L3 Mix]â€ subtitle.
The idea here was to bring together one of my latter-day favorites with some of my classic favorites. Most know how much Led Zeppelin rocked, but Lynyrd Skynyrd is â€œmy other favorite misunderstood recording artist with a name starting with L.â€

Please note that Iâ€™m at least leaving Stairway and Free Bird alone. :P

Anyway, a few of Gagaâ€™s songs seem to be thematically similar to material of the type that male rock stars have been producing for decades (not to discount the other material coming from either). So, it seemed logical to combine â€˜em.

This mash is dedicated to three of the performers on the originals, all of whom left us too soon. Letâ€™s observe a lack of silence for John Bonham, Steve Gaines and Ronnie VanZant. ;)
