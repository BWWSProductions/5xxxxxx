Release Description:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Super Text Search is a utility which enables you to quickly search files 
   for text. In plain ASCII text files it also allows you to replace text. 
   You can search anything from a single file to an entire drive for any 
   text you need to find.

-  Both plain text files (program source code, batch files, HTML files, etc.) 
   and binary files (word processing and spreadsheet documents, PDF files, 
   databases, even executable programs) can be searched, as can files 
   archived inside ZIP, CAB or RAR files.

-  In addition to simple searches for words or phrases, the program allows 
   you to use regular expressions (as found in Grep utilities, which will be 
   familiar to the more technical among you) to perform more advanced 
   searches including wild cards and various types of pattern matching.

-  After performing a search, files containing the search text can be viewed, 
   edited or opened in their associated applications. Search results can 
   also be printed or exported.
