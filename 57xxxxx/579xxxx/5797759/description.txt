The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 29 August 2010


[sebaygo1]

:: NOTE :: Today's broadcast consists previously aired interviews.

The Infowars web site describes today's show thusly:
"On this Sunday Edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Texas Congressman Ron Paul, author of End The Fed and The Revolution: A Manifesto. Additional guests include retired FBI agent Don Adams, who contends Lee Harvey Oswald could not have killed John F. Kennedy, and Joel Skousen, founder and chief editor of World Affairs Brief, a weekly news analysis service. Mr. Skousen talks about Chuck Baldwin's article, Top Secret America: The Rest Of The Story, and the dark side of America's army and secret police."

It appears that Alex recorded a short into in which he mentions today's date [Sunday, August 29], but he stopped short of saying the show was "live."

Ron Paul from August 18
Joel Skousen from August 19
Don Adams from August 26

In his intro for the second hour, Alex does say that this is "an encore, best-of" presentation.



The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
