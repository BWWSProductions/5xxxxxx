BBC Proms  2010 - [Jamie Cullum and the Heritage Orchestra] [MP4-AAC] (oan)



Singer and songwriter, pianist and guitarist, jazz leader and pop collaborator 
Jamie Cullum has been doing it all for a decade.

In a highlight of the Late Night Proms series he joins up with the Heritage Orchestra, 
the forward-looking, boundary-crossing collective formed six years ago to play at 
London's Cargo club. Soon they were recording a session for Gilles Peterson's 
Radio 1 show and appearing at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Cullum has devised a 
wide-ranging programme that also features new arrangements and some special 
guest appearances.
