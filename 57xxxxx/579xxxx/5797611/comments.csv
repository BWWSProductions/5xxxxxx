,w0lfsban3,2010-08-30T03:21Z,"Very much appreciated.  Coverage of motorcycle racing here in the U.S. leaves much to be desired, and that's being mild about it.  Thanks again."
,DMWill,2010-08-30T07:32Z,"I agree with w0lfsban3.  BBC coverage is hands down the best; Speed just doesn't do it justice.

and thanks tdmk for the race!"
