,SammoSammy,2010-10-21T07:20Z,"Fantastic! Been looking for singular EP torrents and it wasn't going well, now I've gotten the closest I ever have to having a complete collection. Wish these guys would come down to Aus, I'd love to see them live and get some merch!

,Silver-xombie,2011-11-26T02:00Z,Does this have that old Courage the Cowardly Dog song that they did a while back on here?
,RogerMadoff,2011-12-16T12:01Z,Fantastic stuff.
,paper_mp3,2012-01-25T03:13Z,It works.
,chadcopper,2012-06-08T22:11Z,"WTF??? Well, it certainly seems to be an exhaustive discography, very nice. But over 50% of the tracks not only have NO info (album, track #, even bit rate) but seem to be some file configuration where you cant even ADD the info yourself--??? If anyone knows some way to add hte info to these tracks, I'm all ears. The comparitively FEW tracks that have any info are at 128, maybe as high as 160."
