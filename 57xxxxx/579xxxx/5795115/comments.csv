If anyone pls upload it, i will be thankful to him for the rest of my life."
,twangling_jack,2010-09-19T00:44Z,"Actually, the version everyone SHOULD want/need is the full screen version. It's how the film was shot. Sure, Raimi might say he approves of the widescreen version, but the uncompromised full screen version is definitely superior (imo). I would also love it if someone could upload the BDRip of that. "
