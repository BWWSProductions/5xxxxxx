A Christian Manifesto 
 
by Francis Schaeffer 
 
 
Twenty-five years ago, the late Dr. Francis Schaeffer gave a message at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It was called A Christian Manifesto and it was based on a book he had published the year before with Crossway. While people familiar with the Communist Manifesto might cringe at the use of that word, Dr. Schaeffer intended it to be rallying cry in response to a less familiar, but equally destructive, declaration called The Humanist Manifesto that emerged in 1973.

This message has since been credited as one of the most influential set of ideas in guiding how Christians engage in the public square and in the world of ideas. The late Dr. D. James Kennedy hosted Dr. Schaeffer for this message and preserved much of the legacy of his ideas after Dr. Schaeffer passed away in 1984. Dr. Dobson, Tim LaHaye and other Evangelical leaders were also shaped by this influential message.

So what were those big ideas 25 years ago that have so influenced the role of Christian engagement ever since? We've pulled out a few of those in the selected excerpts below. Watching the video of this presentation can give you the full context. The datedness of the clothes, hair and production quality provide even greater contrast to the timelessness of the principles Dr. Schaeffer presented.

Going back to those ideas can give us perspective on what motivates the older generation of active Christians among us and can provide those who have come on the scene in the meantime with context for the challenges that remain Ã¢â‚¬â€ as well as the timeless call to be faithful in their generation.
