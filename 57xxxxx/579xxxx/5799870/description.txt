The band's second and final album, released in 2002 on Grenadine Records.


I won this CD through a campus radio trivia contest. According to Wikipedia, the band included "Ian Blurton (ex-Change of Heart) on guitar and vox, Al Kelso (ex-The Dinner Is Ruined) on guitar, Randy Curnew (ex-Ursula/Cash Brothers) on drums, Sam De Medeiros bass, and Brendan Canning (Broken Social Scene) on bass"; the album was produced by Daryl Smith.
