    Patrick Stewart narrates a landmark three-part series      
    on the world's last mountain gorillas.                    
                                                             
    Titus the gorilla king faces the biggest challenge of     
    his life. He's lived longer and sired more offspring       
    than any other known gorilla, but his time as a great     
    leader may be coming to an end. The mighty silverback    
    has a little orphan in his care - and both their lives    
    hang in the balance.                                       
                                                              
    In Uganda, young silverback Marembo is back with his     
    raging hormones and desire to be dominant - he's sure     
    to shake things up a bit.
