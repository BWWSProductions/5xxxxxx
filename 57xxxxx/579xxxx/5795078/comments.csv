You should have new type of DVD-DL writer drive like HP and TDK DVD+R DL, burn it with MAX Speed
XBOX must be moded to run backup DVD's
most of XBOX360 torrent games after extracting RAR files will have .iso and .dvd files

do not change names of them and select .dvd file with imgburn and wait for about 30 min's and done, take the copy and play the game"
