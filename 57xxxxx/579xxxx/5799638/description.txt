Alex returns to the airwaves on this Monday. He talks with Paul Joseph Watson, the editor and writer for Prison Planet.com. He is the author of Order Out Of Chaos. Watson is also a fill-in host for The Alex Jones Show and has been interviewed by many publications and radio shows, including Vanity Fair and Coast to Coast AM, Americaâ€™s most listened to late night talk show. Paul talks about the worldwide effort to ban deadly flu shots and other topics of importance.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
