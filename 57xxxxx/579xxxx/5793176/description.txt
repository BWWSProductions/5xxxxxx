 The crack was not made by me, so credits go to whoever made the original "PMDG_BAe_JS4100.DLL".
 I`m not a coder or anything like that, this is just something i`ve figured by myself and i made this account just to share it with the comunity, so if anything goes wrong blame it on yourself :D

 I`m using a cracked FSX with cracked Acceleration, under Win 7 ultimate, this may or may not work with other instalations but it worked fine for me. 
 P.S. i`m not looking for any kind of recognition, if you enjoyed the torrent leave some kind of feedback, or not, keep the flaming for yourself because i`ve already stated i`m not a coder, cracker or whatever, i`m just a dude who looked for a SP for this plane for ages now, and figured i could help others in my position. 
 Sorry if i`m double posting but i can`t find my original torrent anywhere....
