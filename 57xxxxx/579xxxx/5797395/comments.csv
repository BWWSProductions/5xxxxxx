,DaBigSky,2010-09-01T18:42Z,The Jews A (short) History:  Became God's chosen people. Rejected God and set up a King. The kings lead the people astray and God sends them to exile. The Jews came back from exile with the stain of Babylon. God sends Jesus to get them back on the path; they kill Jesus and persecute his followers.  God sends the Romans to wipe Israel off the face of the earth as Jesus foretold.  Remnant Jews are scattered to other lands where they continue to stir up shit.  The lords and Kings occasionally put them in their place. They become JEW-lers and Bankers.  Use their ill-gotten wealth to oppress man for their gain of world domination.  They have chosen to take on their own by corruption and force what God promised them only if they remained obedient to him. If this truthful statement is hatefulâ€¦.you hate the truth.  Which makes Jesus is the biggest anti-Semite of them all and if you want to hate that you are showing your true colors.  Anti-Semite=truth lover=Godly.  Hate the sin love the sinner.
,Adrian16807,2010-10-25T21:33Z,"In what way was Jesus an anti-semite? If he himself is a Jew, is he thus going to persecute himself? I agree that the Jews have sinned, (and yet still are; but be careful to point fingers, we ALL have sinned and fallen short of righteousness.) In there turning away from God, they have given rise to allow the people of the nations to blaspheme (Bible says so). But I can give you more than just Jewish people who are the Elitist and who probably have their share of 'ownership' of the world. The NWO is not a conspiracy unique to Jews; nor will it be. The anti-christ will turn against the Jews in revelation. By then it will be against the Jews. Most people forget that. None of this voids the everlasting promise to Abraham (otherwise God's promise to Israels physical seed is made void, Is God one that he should lie?) We should bless Jewish people, and Israel, even still. But should we sponsor their sinning? No, but by blessing them and trying to remove corruption, we may be blessed by God removing or (probably more rampant) corruption in conspiracy; but we should try not to overlook them and paint them all as 'bad' and then not try to even bless upright people. They are 'blinded in part'; but there are them in Israel who can see. But by giving to Israel we should not neglect these either; give to the poor, remember the widows, destitute, orphans ect. In these also God will bless. Remember Romans - Just as he has broken of branches (of Israel, Jews), and grafted us in; BE CAREFUL not to gloat and say the Jews were taken out so that I (Christians) can be grafted in to God's covenant. He has the ability to graft them back in and take us out, and they are the NATURAL branches, we are not. Do look down on them - or HE might look down on us..."
