"Stuck Like Glue" is a Sugarland single released to radio July 23, 2010. It is the first single off their upcoming album The Incredible Machine, set to be released October 19, 2010. "Stuck Like Glue" debuted at #44 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of August 7, 2010, and debuted at #20 on Billboard Hot 100 the following week.

The music video was released on August 6 on VEVO. Similar to Pink's "Please Don't Leave Me," the video portrays an alternate interpretation of the lyrics. The narrator is an obsessive ex-lover in denial who ambitiously attempts to stay close to her past boyfriend by multiple "absurd" actions that cause trouble for her and grief for her ex-lover.

Blake Boldt of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs-up. His review called the song "oddball" and "interesting," praising Nettles's vocal stylings as well as the production.

Some stations have edited out the song's reggae bridge as well as a portion which uses Auto-Tune.
