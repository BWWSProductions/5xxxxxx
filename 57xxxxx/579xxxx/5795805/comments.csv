[T],Knaster,2010-08-29T00:01Z,Will i get banned from steam if i use this on my bought game?
,deathtrooper30,2010-08-29T01:49Z,lol
,RDCMrT,2010-08-29T04:14Z,"Nice, just wanted to go complaining about the game COMPLETELY ending after you finish it.
The maker of this rules !!!"
,thankuforurhardwork,2010-08-29T04:52Z,sweet o.o
,xiIix,2010-08-29T05:10Z,Thank fucking god for this. I hope it works well.
,xiIix,2010-08-29T05:41Z,"This is kind of odd. The map is bare with no landmarks, though some of them show up as you get close to them, and not all the cars show up in the garage. Also, it breaks if you try to go into the tuning shop."
,tspooner,2010-08-30T08:34Z,"how do you get this to work?
i dowloaded it and everything but it is not working"
,tspooner,2010-08-30T08:53Z,this doesnt work worth a dried up turd
,A700,2010-08-30T10:43Z,Hey anyone know where i can save my progress in the free ride???
,mrpras,2010-08-30T16:39Z,"you can drive around and the garage has lots of cars but you start with $500 and there's not much to do..

There are plenty of opportunities during the campaign where you can just drive around, so personally I just went back to the original.

It also wipes your current game, so back it up :)"
,tspooner,2010-08-31T05:27Z,"can sombody email me and explain to me how i get this to work

gui-man like it says and that s that so extract it to MAFIA 2 FOLDER THEN PC THEN SDS ENG THEN GUI AND ENJOY !"
,gamervtc,2010-09-04T15:24Z,just extract it as it says mafia 2/pc/sds_en/gui and then the freeride will be unlocked 
,gamervtc,2010-09-04T15:52Z,hey tspooner try it like i ve wrote it has to work it works for everyone but you if u don t know what your doing don t diss on  others buddy try it like ive wrote
,Chabs232,2010-09-09T13:55Z,"Is it ""Unlocked"" or ""Added"" ?
Because this feature wasn't placed by the 2k devs... That's for sure. I ended the game twice in normal and hard and nothing has unlocked, so it's more like an addition."
[T],ADHDerby,2010-09-09T16:50Z,"""Enables"" is probably a better desctiption, it enables the pre-existing free-ride option.

New version (Update 2): http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5821243"
,danam22315,2011-07-27T02:57Z,"This really does work!

I have a question, can you save in freeride?

By the way if you take the Smith Custom 200 Police Special from the garage, the buttons that usually change the radio stations turn the siren off and on!

But be careful! As soon as you take this car out of Joey's yard, you will be wanted by the police!
Also, you can't get the cars fixed at the garages ! (at least not the ones with the wrench sign outside).  "
