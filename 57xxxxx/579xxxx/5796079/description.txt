The Libertines had the sound turned off on them midway through 'Time For Heroes' during their Reading Festival set tonight (August 28).

There was no explanation as to why the band had to leave the stage, although video screens showed fans being crushed at the front of the stage. Just as Carl BarÃ¢t was about to launch into the solo of 'Time For Heroes' the sound was turned down until the band were playing without people being able to hear them. Roadies then ran on to tell them they could not be heard, and the band left the stage.

They returned after a couple of minutes, with drummer Gary Powell coming on first and playing a similar drumbeat to Queen's 'We Will Rock You'. Shortly after BarÃ¢t, Pete Doherty and John Hassall followed, with the band then launching seamlessly into the solo of 'Time For Heroes' and completing their set.

As with their previous gigs this week, Doherty and BarÃ¢t said little to the audience, although they did hug and kiss each other throughout. The band's set was also exactly the same as last night's at Leeds Festival.

With no more gigs scheduled, the reunited band did not give any clues about their future as they left the stage, although all four members did come together at the front and hug and bow in front of the audience.
