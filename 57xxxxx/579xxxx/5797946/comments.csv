,DejaRayne,2010-08-30T18:40Z,"what is up with everyone not wanting to seed this?!  this is ridiculous..it may be better than last night, but barely..and for the one on the first page, i dunno how you got this downloaded in 10 mins unless you came at a time when people were actually seeding more than a couple kb/s...i've download all the past episodes with close to or at 1mb/s speed..i've never had to download an hour show this fucking slow.."
,nitrus0x,2010-08-30T18:45Z,"to everyone bitching about shitty download speed, or lack of seeders:

1) just because it says 40k seeders does *NOT* mean you will be able to connect to all of them

2) do a little research first, don't expect everyone to hand feed you everything -- google is your friend

3) tutorials -> http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=43"
,SelleBel,2010-08-30T20:13Z,Great!! I love the show ;)
,baron9876,2010-08-30T20:42Z,"wish people would fuck off about shit speeds, if it's shit quality fair enough but it's free and you sayin please seed please seed like little girls aint gunna make anyone seed for longer"

,pentjak3,2010-08-31T04:15Z,I dont understand why people complain about how long it takes to download just use utorrent i get these episodes in 5 minutes or less they download at 3 mb/s or sometimes higher
,pentjak3,2010-08-31T04:17Z,I actually dont understand why people ever complain its free stuff on the internet be grateful even if it isnt a good version or high def as long as your tv is good it still comes out decent

Thanks for the info! But if all you have to do is nothing then how are people choosing not to seed?  I use Limewire and I see that it is uploading.  How is it a choice to seed?"

although i think you technically have to have downloaded the whole torrent to be called a seeder, the act of uploading is seeding.  the act of downloading is leeching.

just make sure you have uploaded as many MB as you have downloaded for each torrent so you have helped keep it alive for the next guy."

just make sure you have uploaded as many MB as you have downloaded for each torrent so you have helped keep it alive for the next guy. (an upload/download ratio of 1)

if you dont have problems with using all you broadband quota you can seed to a ratio of 2, 3 or 50 to be nice."

,NonSeq,2010-09-13T18:29Z,"Technically it is merely 'copyright infringement', not 'stealing' in the ordinary sense of the word. 

'Stealing' is commonly used to refer to actual property that is taken from the owners without permission/payment. 

As there is no physical 'property' here, there can be no 'stealing'. 

That's my legal analysis, if it helps!!"
