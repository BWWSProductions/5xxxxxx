,blakkmask,2011-04-01T12:30Z,"the FLAC format is for NO LOSS of audio quality.
Meaning no sound quality is lost during the compression of these files, unlike other formats like MP3 or WMA.  You Just have to be set up to open them"
,Neeza,2011-07-29T02:00Z,"yes,just get FLAC program and it decodes .flac files back to .wav files.   .flac files uses 50% less space then .wav files. And NO Quality LOSS=] Awesome=]

Besides,winamp plays .flac files and it is much better quality then any .mp3 or .wma files."
