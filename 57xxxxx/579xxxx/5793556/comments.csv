720  576

576 is not HD!!!"
,brutalspoon,2010-11-29T18:12Z,"@raterillo:

It is HD, you spoon. Although resolutions are referred to by their vertical pixel count, video being HD or not is dictated by the horizontal pixel count. 1280x720 (or 720p) is fine assuming the video is in a 16:9 aspect ratio, but with wider aspect ratios it's still high definition but you have fewer rows of pixels for the same overall quality.

This movie was shot in Super Panavision which had an aspect ratio of 2.2:1 (or close to 20:9), so if you were to download it in 1280x720 then you'd just have epic letterboxing anyway. Thankfully whoever ripped it had the sense and decency to crop any letterboxing and upload it to you the way it was filmed. Be grateful.

Thanks for the upload! I'll be sure to seed it when I can."

Downloading it right now, will check back when I get a look at the quality.
This Torrent seems promising."
,Ratmanslim,2011-02-02T18:24Z,"Wow, 2001 on 720p. I'm gonna give this boring movie one last try this weekend when I have a lot of time to waste. I've always hated it (loved the book, though) because it is so dull. sooo slooow. Maybe cool to watch something float around for no reason back in 1968, but today that's old school.
   The ending is pretty awesome and fucking scary in the middle of the night, but the hours leading up to it.... my god it's boring.
   Well, well... as I said. I'm gonna give this one last try. =)"
,_Yvy_,2011-02-11T08:38Z,"@Ratmanslim: you need to put yourself in an... erm... esoteric mode, then the movie is fine.

after reading the book I finally understand it ;-)

Thanks for the upload !!!"

,rippervanwinkle,2011-05-21T22:30Z,"It seemed like a very good rip but there is some ringing (edge artefacts). These may well be in the source or maybe the encoder  got over enthusiastic with the sharpening.  

Does anybody have some screens of the original bluy-ray to demonstrate/compare?

Here's a screen at 30 mins, uncompressed png.  Look at the character on the left in the grey suit and see the halo around the suit against the red chair.  Also see the zinging edge around the character in the centre and the woman in black on the right.  Oddly this looks much more apparent and obvious when seeing the movie than when looking minutely at the screenshot.  It is quite distracting.  Most of this rip looks superb and you won't notice any issue but there are several scenes where the oversharpening can make you wince.

Anyway if anyone can confirm if the original blu-ray has the same artefacts or not that would be great."

Big thanks to the uploader of this classic film.

Now tell Rick Flair that's his cue...Woooooo!"
