PrisM NOTES:
well there are releases out tagged as DVDRip, by others, obviously that is from P2P Russian DVD9 ... anyway, so i tagged this as r5 as it's region 5 dvd with russian dvd menu makes R5 ... anyway enough balling :P Just encoded a nice 1.4gb Rip adding only sharpness ... the sync was way off on the encode, had to fix which i decided it was 1690MS in the end oos, maybe it's slightly off, but just slightly. Burnt this to disc easily watchable nice quality. Enjoy! //prism
