THE DRESDEN FILES SEIZOEN 1(2007)NL Sub NLT-Release (divx)

The Dresden Files tells the story of Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne), a regular guy with an irregular life â€” he's a wizard, a practitioner of magic who uses his unique abilities to solve the cases that come through his Chicago storefront office; call it the next evolution in forensics.

Harry lives in the same work-a-day world we live in, but he can also operate in the world of the supernatural, the metaphysical, and the unexplainable. Dresden unravels otherworldly schemes and crimes and does battle with the forces of darkness, all while keeping his true activities veiled from Lt. Connie Murphy (Valerie Cruz) of the Chicago Police Department.

The governing body that supervises wizards is called the High Council. The Council enforces the rules and makes certain that nobody in the mundane world ever knows what's going on in the supernatural world. In Chicago, the Council's Warden is Morgan (Conrad Coates). 
Morgan is Harry's probation officer. Five years ago Harry used black magic to kill his uncle Justin Morningway. 
The Council ruled that Harry did it in self-defense, but Morgan suspects otherwise.
He would be only too happy to catch Harry in another transgression.
