PrisM NOTES:
Right...sorry on delay, been at work and that :P, anyway as we took a little longer to release...thought id do a nice encode of it...and of course is jennifer aniston :), anyway, used the video from UG Thanks...loaded into vdub, fixed the brightness a little, lowered contrast to make it not so bright on the eyes.. lowered the chroma, and then the rgb colours, tweaking them all pretty hard. Used a deflicker filter as it had a slight strobing effect going through it, and a really light smoothness filter. Overall imho video looks pretty good...we chose the UG Video as it slightly less cropped top and bottom :), Video compressed very well...hence the smaller size.....:)
