This is an episode of Comedy Central Presents featuring Steve Marmel.

The quality is acceptable, but not ideal. I recorded this from Comedy Central's website, so the several bits are slightly clipped when the commercial breaks would start. But it is in order of its original broadcast. 

If they ever broadcast this episode again, I'd like to replace it, but I've waited 2 years for it. This is one of 3 episodes they have not shown in reruns in that 2 year time (Victoria Jackson (311) and the first Marc Maron (102) being the other two).

But it's better than nothing.

I do have all of the other episodes, except for Victoria's, so if there's one that someone needs, let me know.
