 I really enjoyed this movie VERY much. Danny's character was emotionally intriguing and curious. SO refreshing to see actor's wrap themselves around real emotions rather than hollywood crap where they pump out a facade of fakeness. So many hollywood movies are stupid and fake that even the actors have gotten fake in their every day lives(yea, see Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for example). 

 I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars. Maybe it just caught me on a good night. Thanks for the upload. "

Brilliant film! Lots of twists. British actors are the best, this film proves it.
Thanks."

,mufuti9,2010-10-04T17:02Z,"something is wrong with the sound, right channel is a LOT louder than left, at least on headphones 
(no my headphones are working flawlessly)
Sound quality overall is mediocre at best, video quality is good for a 700mb dvdrip but please, if you dont know real quality please stop rating everything with a 10.
