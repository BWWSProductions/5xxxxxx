Height : 536 pixels

that means 720p
I know it is not correct, but ppl who search for 720p movies will miss this if you insist in mentioning the exact height.

Height is different everytime, so better stick to the moniker 1080p (1920 wide) and 720p (1280 wide). 
That is what most expect, understand and search for."

you should do some googling yourself. 720P does not mean the height will the resolution will be 1280x720. Due to the different aspect ratios of films a lot will actually be less than 720 in height.

On a blu-ray the rest of the 720 would be filled up with black bars. Because these films get ripped the black bars are cropped hence the smaller height of the video.

If the height was stretched to fit the full 1280x720 the film would look crap because the aspect ratio would be completely wrong.

Looking on IMDB the aspect ratio of this film is 1.44:1 which will not fit into the full 1280x720. For that you need a film like Defiance or Saw 6 which have an aspect ratio of 1.85:1"
