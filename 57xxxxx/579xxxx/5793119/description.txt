           Set entirely in one location, the film follows four            
           strangers who become trapped in the elevator of St.            
           Julian-a decrepit, inner-city building. An assassin, a         
           religious zealot, a mother, and a thief...just moments         
           after being confined, it becomes clear that one of them        
           is mortally wounded. As the minutes tick by, a battle for      
           survival ensues where each of them is forced to examine        
           their sordid ties to St. Julian-the building, as well as       
           the legacy of the religious figure.
