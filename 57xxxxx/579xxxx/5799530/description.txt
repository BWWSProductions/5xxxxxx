The Price of Fear was a Horror/Mystery Radio serial produced by BBC Radio during the 1970s. The host and star of the show was Vincent Price.

This show stands out in Price's radio career as some of the episodes were based on fictional adventures of Vincent Price himself, playing himself, while others had him merely introducing the macabre tale of the week. Twenty-two episodes were produced; writers on the series included William Ingram, Stanley Ellin, Richard Davies, R. Chetwynd-Hayes, A.M. Burrage, Elizabeth Morgan, Rene Basilico, Roald Dahl and Price himself.[1] Fifteen of the episodes were rebroadcast by BBC Radio 7 in the spring of 2010.
