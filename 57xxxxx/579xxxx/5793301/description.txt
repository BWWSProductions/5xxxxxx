NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..... The Other Guys

Here we are with another nice screener for everyone to enjoy. Well for this
we made a short script to crop then resized it, adjusted the white balance, contrast,
and added a sharpening filter. The colors on this seemed slightly cold, to much blue.
So we toned those down as well as a few other rgb adjustments. We elected to crop a 
small timer on the very top of the release instead of blurring it, not much at all is cropped.
There are also occasional property of watermarks on this as well so expect to see those. 
The audio was just a straight forward demux and then remux to our rip to keep the AC3 audio.

Enjoy folks
