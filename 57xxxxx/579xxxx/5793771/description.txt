Before & After is the 4th album by New Zealand singer/songwriter Tim Finn. After his split from Crowded House Tim went to work on his next solo album.

This album is an interesting mix of Tim's own material as well as material from other projects he had worked on including the Finn Brothers project with brother Neil (most of the material had been used on the Crowded House album Woodface), & ALT.

Interestingly enough, for this album there was a different producer for almost every track on the album giving it a varying feel all the way through it. Notably, Tim himself produced or co-produced 7 tracks, while Crowded House keyboardist Mark Hart co-produced 2.
