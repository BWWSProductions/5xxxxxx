Dead on the Dance Floor started off back in November of 2008. Since then it has taken off to become what we are today.

Whether it be music you can jam to alone in your room, or music you can throw down and punch a baby too, chance are, we offer it. Our EP, This Has Just Begun was recorded at Chin Music Studios with producers Don DeBiase and Jonny Burke, and dropped on April 27th, 2010. You can pick up our EP on iTunes for $5.94. We are currently looking for a permanent guitarist, there are details in our blog. You can expect a new six song EP from us hopefully sometime this winter
