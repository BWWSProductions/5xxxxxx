[T],Sunblock.,2010-08-28T21:38Z,"Why flash:

1. To make it more complicated. Just download/burn dvd is to easy. :P
2. They make the dvd readers fw so they cant read/wont read DVDR disks. And for a reason.

How to:

Google ""how to flash xbox 360""


To burn xbox games u will need ""Verbatim dvd+r dl (8,5GB)"" Its the best dvdr out there for xbox 360 games. I have never failed with this dvdr.

A small guide."
