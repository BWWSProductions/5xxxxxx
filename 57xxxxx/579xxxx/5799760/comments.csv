[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-31T05:15Z,"@ Everyone - Robin Hood 2010 R5 AC3 XViD - IMAGiNE was just released I will download and encode it in the morning and have it up in the next 24 hours along with several requests. 
Hung, The Big C, Weeds. and some other stuff.

A note to everyone -  
Starting tomorrow, I will be seeding each torrent for a total of 3 days and will stop seeding it at that point, so it will be up to you guys to keep seeding in order to keep the torrent alive. If I have to continue to seed like 20 older torrents and 10 new torrents, I will not be able to release stuff as fast and as much stuff as I /you would like me to release. The reason for this is, seeding 30 torrents from the seedbox is causing problems (like system overload) and it ends up resetting and deleting my torrents from the clients, so I have to take time to re-upload the torrent file and it slows down things. If I see that an older torrent needs seeding or if someone requests a re-seed, I will be more than happy to seed it again.

Sorry guys and gals, I dont mean to B$TCH. (*=*)

@ htctouch - As soon as a better copy is released I will encode and upload it. (^_^)

@ One_Burnt_Potato - I am not sure if anything will come close to - Step Brothers - (that movie was just pure funny and awesome), it is in its own league. "

I doubt anyone will be able to get boiler room, its not been released, no reviews, no nothing. It says it was for 2008. But theres nothing for it. Its probably a movie that died during production."
