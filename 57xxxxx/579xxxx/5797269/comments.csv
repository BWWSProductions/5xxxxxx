,BlazedNConfused420,2011-02-28T05:08Z,"I agree with @Maariuz on this one.... Phatfish I'm glad I don't know you personally bc you obviously have absolutely no sense of humor. Kevin Hart is one of the best Comedians going today and if I'm not mistaken I believe this dvd /comedy album, Seriously Funny, went #1 on the charts so get your facts straight faggot "

You guys really seem to be f'd up in the head to get that worked up over another man's opinion.. Reminds me of a time I dared say I don't find Dane Cook funny.. Weirdos were buggin like they know the dude.. These celebs aren't getting crazy over who has better fans, so yeah, get a life."
