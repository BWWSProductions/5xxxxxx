Although a few of the songs are unfortunately cut of just a little bit too early in the end, so not the full song is there, not a big problem on most, just ""you're out of my life"" is it a bit disturbeing onm when the last beautiful note just cuts of almost when it starts! :/

Dont think you could change that song to a bette, and also the other few with the same problem? Would be great!

Thanks!"
