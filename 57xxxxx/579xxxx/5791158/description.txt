Plot:
The story begins in traditional video style, as several of the film's characters are recorded and asked a series of questions about why they dance. The film then cuts to Moose and Camille Gage who are both dancers and attend New York University. Moose is majoring in electrical engineering after promising his mother that he would not dance anymore. He soon stumbles upon a dance battle, meeting Luke and his House of Pirates dance crew and later teaming up with them to compete in the World Jam dance contest against their rivals, the House of Samurai dance crew. Moose and Camille are best friends but Moose doesn't seem to see that Camille is in love with him. The two fall out during the film because Moose lies to Camille about dancing and she feels like he can't talk to her anymore. Camille feels that Moose doesn't have time for her anymore and tells him she misses him and feels like he doesn't miss her at all. Moose tells Camille that he misses dancing but misses her more and that she is his best friend in the whole world. The two make up on NYC streets by dancing to a remix of Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers. Camille tells Moose that he can never give up dancing as he was born to do it. Moose then helps out Luke by giving him additional members for his crew including Camille and The MSA Crew from Step Up 2: The Streets. Luke meets a girl named Natalie at his club and quickly takes notice of her dancing abilities, enlisting her to become part of his crew and hoping her talent can bring them to victory. However, he is unaware of Natalie's true motives.
