On a shakedown cruise of the Prometheus, the ship's hyperdrive regulator becomes 

irreparably damaged. A nearby planet was listed on the cartouche of addresses 

found on Abydos and thus may have a stargate. After a short jump towards the 

planet, the naquadria reactor overloads and must be jettisoned. After the reactor 

explodes above the planet causing damage, the fate of SG-1 and the crew of the 

Prometheus is in the hands of a once Goa'uld-controlled world that they're off to 

a rough start with.

With Anubis heading to Abydos looking for a valuable artifact known as the eye of 

Ra, ascended Daniel Jackson contacts Colonel O'Neill and the rest of SG-1 to have 

them go to Abydos and find the eye before Anubis. With the help of Daniel, Jonas 

and Carter find a secret chamber where the eye is kept but not before O'Neill, 

Teal'c, Skaara, and a group of defenders are overrun and trapped inside the 

pyramid housing the stargate. But Daniel also finds a tablet, written in ancient, 

suggesting that there is an Ancient city, lost for thousands of years, that give 

Earth weapons with which to defeat Anubis. But the only way to get the tablet back 

to Earth for further translation and for the search for the lost city may be 

Daniel breaking the high rule of ascension and to destroy Anubis. If he doesn't,
