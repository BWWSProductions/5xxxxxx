Summary

It was one of the largest mass sightings in UFO history. In
1997, hundreds of people reported intensely bright balls
of light forming a "V" shape in the sky over Nevada and
Arizona. Some claimed to see an enormous, slow-moving
aircraft. But what's behind the bizarre occurrence later
nicknamed the "Phoenix Lights"? Was it an alien armada? A
top-secret military exercise? See home video and hear from
eyewitnesses who provide a vivid glimpse into what it
was like on the ground that eerie night. Join a team of
rocket scientists, physicists and engineers as they use

the mysterious sightings
