                    The Pale Horse.                          
                    Miss Marple is shocked at the brutal murder of  
                    her old friend Father Gorman. When she receives  
                    a list of names through the post, sent by  
                    Gorman moments before his death, she vows to  
                    seek justice for her friend. A clue leads her  
                    to The Pale Horse, an inn run by three   
                    modern-day witches who claim to be able to kill  
                    by black magic. Then another person is found  
                    dead, and Marple must go to dangerous lengths  
                    to solve the mystery. Are the murders really  
                    being committed by magic or is there something  
                    even more sinister at work?
