I downloaded this hoping that this torrent (uploaded by a VIP) would be fine. I left this to download and when I came back I had spyware scanning software telling me I had worms/virus/malware etc usual crap!

Then it pretended to be Windows Security telling me it had detected a virus and then eventually it came up with BSoD (blue screen).

Even after a reboot and logged in it kept running this pretend software after your card details and crashing to BSoD. Safe Mode was disabled and system restore had been disabled. I could not access the registry and on msconfig a program called foobar2000 kept replicating itself.

I managed to resolve the fault though so whomever wrote this left out flaws in this virus and should learn to develop a more stable virus then this crap.

If anybody else has got this problem reply to this and I'll try and help you guys out.


AVOID THIS TORRENT!!!!!"
