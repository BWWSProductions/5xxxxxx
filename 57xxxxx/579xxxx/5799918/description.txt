Freedom Scientific JAWS 11.0.1461 32bit (by Glitch)


Hi TPB, this is Glitch,

Here is the 32bit crack for JAWS 11.0.1461.
The installation and cracking instructions are
exactly the same as in my previous releases.

Once again, I am not the creator of the crack.  However,
I hold the packaging, batch file, and installation guide
to my name.  The installation guide is included in the
.rar file.

Enjoy.

JAWS (an acronym for Job Access With Speech) is a screen
reader, a software program for visually impaired users,
produced by the Blind and Low Vision Group at Freedom
Scientific of St. Petersburg, Florida, USA.

Its purpose is to make personal computers using
Microsoft Windows accessible to blind and visually
impaired users. It accomplishes this by providing the
user with access to the information displayed on the
screen via text-to-speech or by means of a Braille
display and allows for comprehensive keyboard
interaction with the computer.
