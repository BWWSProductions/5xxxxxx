To anyone getting into Deftones be aware that there are many, many great songs that are not featured in this album. I would strongly suggest downloading the entire album discography (dont worry about the singles and live stuff straight away) and listening to the albums in chronological order.

Personally I think Adrenaline, Around the Fur and White Pony are the best Deftones albums. I notice that there doesn't seem to be one song from Adrenaline on this best of album though."
[T],jonnoel1,2010-10-18T12:32Z,I would have to agree...this is by far NOT the best of the Deftones
