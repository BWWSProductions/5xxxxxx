The Smiths were the definitive British indie rock band of the 80s, marking the end of synth-driven new wave and the beginning of the guitar rock that dominated English rock into the 90s. Sonically, the group was indebted to the British Invasion, crafting ringing, melodic three-minute pop singles, even for their album tracks.
