Barely escaping from nefarious dognappers, an adorable puppy named Beethoven adopts the unsuspecting Newton family -- and promptly grows up into 185 pounds of romping, drooling, disaster-prone St. Bernard! Unfortunately, even after proving his canine credentials to mom and the kids, the heroic hound gets nowhere with uptight dad, George. But when a beastly veterinarian makes Beethoven the target of an unspeakable animal experiment, George becomes the only hope for saving the Newton's furriest family member.
