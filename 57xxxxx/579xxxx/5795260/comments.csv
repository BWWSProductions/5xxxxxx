Why? There are plenty of them around. There is also a Portable version, but a 575MB portable makes me think we have lost something... :o)"

Would it be possible to make a portable out of Smac 2.7 ? You can find a working torrent here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4595868/Smac_2.7_beta_for_Vista_and_Windows_7

Thanks in advance!"

Unfortunately SMAC registers itself taking account of the machine where you installed it, and comes out as unregistered when runned on other machines, or even in your own if you restore an old backup. You can always re-enter your license, but it's not the good kind of a Portable. Doesn't work even using ThinApp to make it Portable so, unless you don't want to enter the license anytime you run it, no portable..."
