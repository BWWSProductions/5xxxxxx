,iknowyoudont,2012-03-14T21:11Z,Thanks for the up but this version isn't the original. In the beginning you can faintly hear some dialogue from Mitch during the waves and him rollerblading with a buddy. IIRC there are also other parts of the film that are missing (I think even one consequential scene).
