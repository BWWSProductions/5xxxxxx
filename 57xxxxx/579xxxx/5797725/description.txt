Sick of The Radio recently started a string of cover albums, in tribute to the legendary home music genius, R. Stevie Moore. The 13 tracks on this release are from the first 4 volumes and I\'ve picked them particularly for their accessibility and hopefully, if not already, they\'ll turn you to Mr. Moore\'s own music.


All recorded in LAME @ 320kbps Mp3

Tracklisting:

01 - Play Myself Some Music (Jason Falkner)
02 - California Rhythm (Roger Ferguson and Ethos)
03 - Showing Shadows (Dr. Tim\'s Banana Paradise)
04 - Love is the Way to My Heart (Dr. Doug)
05 - World\'s Fair 2001 (The Listing Attic)
06 - Norway (Yukio Yung)
07 - I\'ve Begun to Fall in Love (Sean Moore)
