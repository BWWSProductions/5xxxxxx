,jenstt,2010-08-27T00:50Z,I keep getting dll errors :s and i thought release was today?
,RDCMrT,2010-08-27T13:34Z,"Fuck dude, what is this.
When starting the game i had to set my resolution at 1024 x 768 cause of the "" run windowd""  setting.
.
When setting to fullscreen and 1028 x 1024, it locks up the screen whatever you click, resulting in a system crash.
Physx install doesn't work either.
.
Yes i copied EVERYTHING !"
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-08-27T15:03Z,Physx install doesn't work
,LColCAF,2010-08-29T08:04Z,Works fine for me...Takes a he.. of a long time to load but it works!!!
,Moonbootsfc,2010-08-30T05:57Z,If your getting the dlll errors its beacuse you didn't install physX and microsoft redistributable Visual C++ just after ship sim installs. It gives you 3 boxes to tick. Make sure you tick them all and install them.
,wazaanl,2010-08-31T08:43Z,"downloaded and installed the game the way i should of.. didn't get a serial key request but when I start the game now it says: "" your language setting is not supported"" does this have something to do with the fact that I didn't enter a serial key somewhere?"
,wazaanl,2010-08-31T08:54Z,"Error: ""Language setting is not supported"" could use some help here :) cheers"
[T],Coolguy33,2010-09-02T13:42Z,"After installation it comes up with 3 boxes to tick:
Direct x
Physics
Microsoft Redistributable Visual C++

I have ticked them all but it wont install Direct x or Physics. All it does is come up with error messeges.
The weird thing is that the game starts to load up after but then it just goes to a black screen and does nothing."

I have ticked all 3 but it wont install Direct x or Physics. Only Visual C++. All it does is come up with error messeges for the other 2.

[T],Coolguy33,2010-09-02T13:52Z,Looks like i got carried away with the comments. My bad lol
,Sensation90,2010-09-02T23:57Z,"Don't worry if you can't install PhysX and DirectX
if you go to your Ship Simulator Extremes installation folder (where you installed the Sim(mostly it's C:\Program Files\Paradox Interactive\Ship Simulator Extremes)) and then go to the tools map, there you will find the .exe's for the PhysX and DirectX. Hope this helps for you!
Thanks for uploading btw! Works perfectly!"
[T],Coolguy33,2010-09-03T14:14Z,"But i already Have PhysX, Direct X and Visual C++ installed on my pc"
,Guuru5,2010-09-03T16:35Z,"Having the same problem as you, Coolguy. Was not able to install dx or Physx. Think it was caused by that admin. rights shit. Physx was already intalled on my computer too. I went to tools in the installation directory "" Paradox interactive ""  as sensation90 describes. I only had to install Physx to get the game running. GL"
[T],Coolguy33,2010-09-04T00:42Z,"Got the game to run but when i changed the resolution higher to 1680x1050 and restart the game it don't work. All i get is a black screen. Have reinstalled it over and over but it still does the same thing with the black sreen.
Aaaaarrrrrrghhh.....this is just bullshit man!"

,remali9004,2010-11-05T16:50Z,"Here is the solution:
Well. the game need to install (It's better to find from your own the latest DirectX, Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable anf the latest FhysX from Nvidia. 
And other way is to download the demo version
from the original website of the game.
It contains correctly all the above programs.
Also you have to be sure that you have the latest vga graphic drivers.
Well, the game can be install fine on win7.
WinXp needs to go to program folder and right click to file QuestViewer.
Set compatibility to win98/winMe2000.
That was the cause the game crashed after setup
procedure.
Hope I helped.
It's a good game with GreenPeace missions."
,108703,2010-12-21T21:06Z,"Error: ""Language setting is not supported,"" does anyone have a solution? please?"
,Viper426,2011-01-26T02:41Z,"Wow is this game ever buggy as hell. Not only did I have to go out on my own to get the VC++ redist, DirectX update and physX (because the installer was apparently made by rabid monkeys), but there's a 60% chance that the entire thing will crash when loading a mission. From what I've read it's not an issue with this torrent - every torrent I've found has similar issues described. Boy I'm glad I didn't shell out money for this 3rd-rate software. Props to SKiDROW for the rip, mad hate to VStep for shoddy work."

and the Ferry Pack DLC ?"
