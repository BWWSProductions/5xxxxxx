SHAMANIC PHYSICS

Shamans see the world as made up of vibrations, using resonance between individuals to effect healings. In part one of this two-part series, Fred Alan Wolf discusses his efforts to explain shamanic realities in terms of modern physics. He suggests that shamans interact with parallel universes and are able to enter into the world of the dead.

In part two, Wolf describes in greater length his interactions with shamans among the North American Sioux Indians, in the jungles of Peru and in England. He confesses that he observed many things among the shamans that were unexplainable to him in terms of modern physics, noting that the shamans he worked with were loving healers who touched him in a deep and nurturing manner.

Fred Alan Wolf is a physicist and author of Space Time and Beyond, Taking the Quantum Leap, The Body Quantum, Star*Wave, Parallel Universes and The Eagle's Quest.
