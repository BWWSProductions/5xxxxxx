There are 2 more Dvd's that I can't seem to find torrents for.. one is ""binoo's birthday"" and the other is ""the best of toopy and binoo""... will you by any chance be posting those ones up?

Thanks Again :)"

""The Best of Toopy and Binoo"" is not needed as the other DVDs have those episodes.

""Binoo the Brave"" seems dead as there is only one user with 98.5% uploading. If someone has it, I'll keep it going for as long as I can.

""Binoo's Birthday"" is the only DVD not available via torrents. It's finally available for purchase (if others were, more would buy them) so I think I'll buy it instead."
