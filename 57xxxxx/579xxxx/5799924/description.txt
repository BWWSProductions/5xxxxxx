The Underdog Show - Animated - Originally Aired - (October 1964-November 1967)


I Was Amazed When I Got This Series Completely Downloaded. Because I Noticed

That Someone Did A Lot Of Video Editing (Very Time Consuming) By Putting These

Episodes Together (Editing Out Comercials) The Show Was Always Leaving Us In

Suspense Sometimes Until The Show Was Scheduled To Run Again. As Most Of The

Episodes Were Broken Up Into 3 Or 4 Parts. (MY HATS OFF TO THE PERSON OR PERSONS

WHO DID ALL THIS EDITING)!!!  EXCELLENT JOB !!!



Further: These Are The (ORIGINAL) Shows (Explanation Below) "Underdogs Super Energy

Pill"


                       // Underdogs Super Energy Pill //

The "Underdog Super Energy Pill" Was First Introduced In Episode 10. (1x09 - 1x12) â€œZOTâ€œ_PT 2 Of  4_(10-??-1964)

Before taking one, he would often Say: "The Secret Compartment Of My Ring I Fill / With An Underdog Super Energy Pill".

Several Episodes Show Underdog Losing The Ring, & Being Powerless. Since He Must Take Another Pill As His Super Powers Began To Fail, He Would Say "Without My Super Energy Pill / I grow Weaker & Weaker & Weaker Still".

When The Series Was Syndicated (Re-Run) In The 1980s & 1990s, The Scenes Of Him Taking His Energy Pill Were Edited Out.

Animation Fans Lambast This As A Form Of  Political Correctness, As They Believe The Scenes Were Removed In An Attempt To Prevent Any Glorification Of Drug Use.


So Here In These Shows Beginning With Episode (1x09 - 1x12) We See Underdog Taking

His Energy Pill When Needed. (You May Not Want Your Children Watching These
