This album has been widely dispersed via file sharing networks and fan trading over the years. In the meantime, Crow's songs were recorded by major artists such as Celine Dion and Wynonna Judd.

The single eventually reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, propelling the album to number three in the US Billboard 200 album charts, selling over 5.3 million units there as of January 2008 [1][2].

For this reason, sales of the album were banned at Wal-Mart stores.[3]

Live at Budokan 2002



From an Amazon user review:


There really is no comparison between the fairly muddy recording of the backing band in Central Park and the crisp, defined sound captured on _Live at Budokan_, by tour engineer Bruce Knight and a recording staff provided at a local Tokyo studio. The main beneficiaries are Tim Smith's amplified-acoustic rhythm parts and Jim Bogios' drums, and in particular the drums receive excellent definition where they had sounded as dull thuds and crashes previously. The balance between Sheryl's vocals, the backing vocals of the guitarists and the drummer and the instruments as a whole is superb, as good as any studio recording I have heard. 

More subjectively, this captures a well-rehearsed, energetic band at peak performance and in command of a broad rock vocabulary. "A Change Would Do You Good" sounds progressively better since its studio release, the best performance on _Live in Central Park_ and the hands-down rocker of the show at Budokan. As an inside joke for fans of hers who share her Sixties favorites, the song begins as a faithful if transposed nod to the Who's "I Can See for Miles" - perfect, now that I've heard it - and ends with one verse and chorus of "I Can't Explain." The band nails it, especially Bogios' simon-pure reproduction of Keith Moon's work and Sheryl's perfect, snarling evocation of Roger Daltrey. The slower songs in her catalog hit just as hard as the rockers, and this marks the first time "Home," probably her most sadly beautiful song, appears in a live recording available on CD (you'd have to buy her 1999 DVD before now). 

However, I hope this is the second and last time "Strong Enough" appears on one of her live albums. I skip that track almost as quickly as "Closer to the Heart" on any Rush live album - it's on every last damn one of them, and it wore out its welcome on the studio release. 

In short, _Live at Budokan_ is her best live album of the two released, and has her best performances bar none of the Lilith Fair stuff, the DVD, or other collaborations I have heard. While it doesn't capture all of her strongest songs in one album, no one CD could, and it comes closer than any album produced yet to summarizing her appeal as a live performer. It would also be an excellent buy for someone who wants a best-of compilation, until her label releases one.

Wildflower is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, first released September 27, 2005.

Detours 2008


Detours is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow. The album marks Crow reuniting with Bill Bottrell, who produced Crow's debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club and briefly worked with Crow on her 1996 self-titled album. The album returned to Crow's forte in roots rock. The album has sold over 700,000 copies worldwide as of 2010.

It was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category for Best Pop Vocal Album on December 4th, 2008.

Detours was recorded at Crow's Nashville farm and features fourteen of the 24 songs put to tape. The first single is a folk-rock anthem, "Shine Over Babylon". Crow told Billboard in the summer of 2007 that the song "is very environmentally conscious, in the tradition of Bob Dylan." The single ended up being a radio airplay release only and from that "Love Is Free" was confirmed to be the second single from the album, to be released in early 2008.

â€œ	I'm really encouraging artists to write about what's going on, because we seem to be very distracted by some lightweight topics. I think it's time to start writing about the reality of what's around us.	â€

In additional comments on her Web site, Crow describes the single as "an every way a desperate cry for understanding. Perhaps it is even a battle song in the face of fear."

The album is said by critics and fans to be a fairly political album. "This is the most honest record I've ever made. It's about being forced to wake up," says Crow.

The second single is "Love Is Free" which, in Crow's own words, is "inspired by New Orleans. What struck me about it is the stoicism of the New Orleans people, they are very spiritually based. You can see it in their eyes that they aren't going to give up, they are going to rebuild." So far "Love Is Free" has gained much airplay in the States and has already begun to enter the Billboard charts: the U.S. Hot 100 (#77), the Canadian Hot 100 (#53) and the Japanese Hot 100 (#10).

Perhaps coincidentally, while the New Orleans-inspired single was distributed and its allusions were noted by Crow during appearances on American television, the album itself was released on the day of Mardi Gras.

100 Miles from Memphis 2010


100 Miles from Memphis is the seventh studio album from American singer and songwriter Sheryl Crow. The album was written and produced by Crow, Doyle Bramhall II and Justin Stanley and features the musicians Tommy Sims and Chris Bruce.[1] On this album she ditches her country and pop-rock past in favor of a vintage Memphis-styled, soul-inspired record. Although an extraordinaire on such instruments as bass, piano and acoustic guitar, Crow concentrates on singing throughout the album, which features some covers, including Citizen Cope's "Sideways"[2] and The Jackson 5's "I Want You Back".


In the Unites States, "100 Miles From Memphis," was the Billboard 200's second-highest debut. The album which starts at number #3 with sales of 55,000 copies is the singer's eighth top 10 album.[7] In the second week, the album drop to number #8, with sales of 24,000 copies.[8] In the third week, the album fell out to number 16.[9]In the fourth week, the album fell to number 23.[10]

In Canada, the album has sold 4,600 copies in its first week, debuting at #2 on the Canadian Albums Chart,[11] losing to Eminem's Recovery, which sold 28,000 copies. To date the album sold 110,000 copies in the US.

100 Miles from Memphis has received positive reviews from music critics. Knoxville.com calls the album "sonically impressive" and Sheryl Crow's "most ambitious release so far", although not impressed with her voice, noticing a disconnection with the sound. They gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5.[21]

BBC also gave 100 miles a positive review, calling it a "mix of white soul, rock and reggae" and praising the partnership between Crow and producer Doyle Bramhall II. The album is considered to be a nostalgic move for Sheryl, for a time when soul had an upbeat message. Crow's excitement is noticed throughout the record.[22]

Billboard magazine says "100 miles is a path Crow was certainly wise to tread", praising her celebratory mind frame and the joyous mood of lead single "Summer Day", as well as "Peaceful Feeling" and first track "Our Love is Fading". Keith Richards' swagger is also noticed on the reggaefield "Eye to Eye".[23]

Mojo Magazine finds Crow in a peaceful state of mind, after adopting her two sons, Wyatt Steve and newborn Levi James. At 48, she finally "returns to her roots". Mojo praises producers Doyle Bramhall II and Justin Stanley (Amy Winehouse) in their pursuit of "shimmering Memphis sound" and calls ballads "Stop" and Crow's cover of "Sideways" two of her most "vulnerable and classy performances". The album is rated 4 out of 5 stars.[24]

The album was made BBC Radio 2's album of the Week for the week commencing July 10
