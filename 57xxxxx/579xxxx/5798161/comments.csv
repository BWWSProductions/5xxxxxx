,prab489,2012-04-29T15:00Z,"Start Up Black Screen and Mode not supported Error
When the game loads, the monitor stays black with the floating box saying “mode not supported”. You can hear the game sound and game content loading, but can’t get to display the video. It happens because of the video settings, and you need to follow the steps below to get it to work.

Start up the Mafia 2 and then DON’T TOUCH the mouse again until the monitor problem is fixed and follow these steps.

Listen for the nVidia logo to start and press Esc.
Another video will play, press Esc again.
Wait a second and press Esc once more.
You are now at the Main Menu. Press Down arrow 1 time and press Enter. (you should hear click sounds as you navigate the menus).
You are in Options Menu. Press Down arrow 2 times and Enter.
You are in Video Options. Press Down arrow 1 time, then hold down the Left arrow until the click sounds stop.
You are going to change the Resolution to 640×480. Press Esc, wait for a second and press Enter, wait 5 more seconds and press Enter again.
If you did everything right then you should now see the Video Options menu on screen. Use the arrow keys or mouse to set the resolution up to 1024×768 (or whatever your monitor can handle), press Esc, press Enter to accept, wait for screen change and press Enter to accept again.
Now fully exit the game, restart the game and hope that it saved your changes.

,prab489,2012-04-29T15:01Z,"Mafia 2 Doesn’t Start after loading Splash Image, Resolution Problem
When you click Mafia 2 executable, game starts with splash image which disappears after a while and then nothing happens.
Go to

C:UsersyourAccountUserNameAppDataLocal2K GamesMafia IISaves

and open file “videoconfig” with notepad and change all 1′s to zeroes (0′s).

Within that file you will find something like:

0 0 1680 1050 1 0 0 1

Change it to:

0 0 640 480 0 0 0 0

This will solve this issue and game will start normally and looks better.If the file/folder doesn’t exist, create it.
