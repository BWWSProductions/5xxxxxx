Plot:

Lara Croft is tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an object from ancient legends which supposedly contains one of the deadliest plagues on Earth, before evil Nobel Prize-winning scientist turned bioterrorist Jonathan Reiss can get his hands on it. The key to finding the box, which is hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, is a magical luminous orb that serves as a map. Lara finds the orb while exploring the submerged Luna Temple following an earthquake off the coast of Santorini, but it is stolen by crime lord Chen Lo, who in turn plans to sell the orb to Reiss. Lara recruits an old lover, Terry Sheridan, a former mercenary and Royal Marine who had spent his last couple of years in prison in Kazakhstan, to help her track down Chen Lo and the orb.Among the action sequences that take place during this time are the duo's entry into mainland China, a fight scene in suburban Shanghai, and a leap off the then-under-construction International Finance Centre skyscraper in Hong Kong, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay. The orb later reveals the location of the Cradle of Life to be somewhere near Kilimanjaro in Africa. Lara sends this info back to Bryce back at Croft Manor. After the transmission, Reiss and his men had infiltrated the mansion and captured Bryce and Hillary. Meanwhile, Lara and Terry begin to fall in love with each other again but Lara starts to back 
away from him.Lara meets up with Kosa, an African friend who serves as her translator as they obtain information from a local tribe about the Cradle of Life. As the expedition starts, many of the tribesmen are soon killed by Reiss' soldiers and ends with Lara being captured as Reiss' helicopter starts to land. Reiss threatens to kill Bryce, Hillary, and Kosa unless Lara leads him to the Cradle of Life. Soon they face perils such as a forest full of shadow monsters that kill immediately when they sense movement. When it comes to entering the Cradle of Life, there is a pool of highly corrosive black acid which holds the box. During this time, Terry arrives, frees Reiss' captives, and catches up to Lara.Following a climactic fistfight between Lara and Reiss, Reiss is knocked into the acid pool by Lara after he is distracted by Terry. When the couple tries to leave, Terry attempts to take the box as compensation for finding it, but she staunchly refuses to let him leave with it. Despite her love for him, this results in Lara being forced to fatally shoot him in self-defense just after Terry draws his own gun. Lara places Pandora's Box back into the pool, and realizes that some things were not meant to be found.
