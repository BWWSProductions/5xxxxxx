,scarred1977,2010-10-25T19:18Z,what happened to the second part of this series? the diplomat (aka false witness) is a two parts mini-series... the blu-ray release contains the full two episodes and has 188 minutes... this torrent only has one video file which is only the first episode... please release the second episode or at least change the title of this torrent because it is misleading... thanks... 8)
