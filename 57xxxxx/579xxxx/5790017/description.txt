    Comedian Alexander Armstrong always knew his family        
    background was likely to be privileged, but he's keen     
    to find out exactly how posh he is...                    
                                                              
    Appropriately enough Alexander's journey begins with       
    Burke's Irish Landed Gentry, a register of Britain's      
    landed families. He quickly finds his own name listed    
    under his mother's family name, McCausland, and decides   
    to follow this line to find out more. Moving up the        
    family tree he finds a relative who holds an honoured     
    position in the Royal household of the day.              
                                                              
    Delving into more family papers, Alexander finds a         
    letter from a direct ancestor over two hundred years      
    ago, complaining about the shortcoming of her wastrel    
    eldest son Edward. Alexander discovers that Edward        
    inherits his baronetcy from a cousin and that foul play    
    is suspected. Alexander's aristocratic roots are          
    confirmed.                                               
                                                              
    Searching even further back following a fascinating        
    trail of ancient documents Alexander finds out that he    
    has even more titled relatives descended from one of     
    the richest families in Britain and intimately            
    connected to the King. One is a Royalist military          
    leader during the Civil War, who ploughs all his money    
    into the King's cause. But in a curious twist of fate    
    he ends up being tried for High Treason and finishing     
    his days in a most unexpected way.

    was a problem with the original airing, so we waited for
