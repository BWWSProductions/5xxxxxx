I tried for several months to reastablish my account but to no avail. So i am forced to re-register under a different name. Since then, There has been a few changes to the bay. If somone would be so kind as to show me how to post a preview in top right corner of torrent, i would be very greatfull. I used to use a couple of host sites but tpb are not excepting them anymore and i seem to be having probs with the one people usualy use. Thanks everyone and i hope you like the mags. Took me a long time to get a compleat set."
,asc11,2010-08-30T03:39Z,"Do you mean a picture near the top of the ""Details for this torrent"" page? On the page where you enter the info to upload a torrent, there's a box for you to put the URL for your picture -- next to ""Image tag from bayimg"".  Before you use that, you have to upload your picture to bayimg.com .  It is easy.

Or can you have some other kind of preview on the ""Details for this torrent"" page that I don't know about?

Or are you talking about some kind of preview on some other web page?"

[V],sonilem,2010-08-30T15:24Z,"Firstly thanks for your help asc11 and Skymocker. I am with it now, and will give it a go. Secondly, can someone tell me why when ebooks is packed with porn mags including about 50 of the very same mags i have uploaded has mine been moved to porn."
[V],sonilem,2010-08-30T15:38Z,"Can i ask why when e-books is packed with porn mags, including at least 50 of the very same mags i have uploaded, has mine been moved to other porn. And thank you Skymocker and asc11 for your help with my prob. I will give it a go. I remember the nightmare i had last time. Every time i found a host site i understood tpb banned it. LMAO."
,asc11,2010-08-30T19:18Z,"Some admin decided to put stuff, including (and I hope not limited to) yours, in the ""right"" category. Maybe that happens only sometimes. And, of course, nobody who is allowed to re-classify older torrents has done the work."
[V],sonilem,2010-08-30T21:31Z,"Just thought it was me they disliked lmao. But i just thought with pdf's going in E-books and it being packed with porn mags, my torrent would get a wider audiance. Never stopped to think about who would have access to it. Thanks for all your help. I will put them in other porn from now on. Got a massive collection. Just need to wait until i have organized it all. Cheers asc11."

[V],sonilem,2010-08-31T18:44Z,"No probs my friend. Plenty more to come. I just need to organise the folder. Which could take a while, but it will be worth it i promise."
[V],sonilem,2010-09-20T13:42Z,Oh tell me about it! I had vip statess and over 1400 uploads when they decided to float everyones torrents to every paid file sharing site going. Yes they do make money out of our hard work. Fuck Copyright and fuck the haters. I dont care what people say as long as i can share for free.
