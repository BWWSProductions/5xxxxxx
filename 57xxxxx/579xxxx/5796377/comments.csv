,the_sinner_soul,2010-10-23T01:58Z,"hey guys, i'm having a problem with the download n was wondering if anyone could do me a favor n help me out here! :) i'm stuck in 16.3% n although the program ( BitTorrent 7.1 Build 22153 ) shows 264 seeds and 538 peers, i'm not having any download progress. i'm having this problem with several other torrents, however other torrents are just doing fine! i usually have 70 kbps download speed and the internet connection is doing fine as always. i've tested the internet speed and there's no problem with it, and according to BitTorrent the port forwarding is ok as well! please, if anyone have any idea it would help me a lot, sorry again for the interruption n thanks for the upload... :) "
