The 3 books are Hyperspace, Parallel Worlds, and Physics of the Impossible.  Hyperspace is a scan and is in the .djvu format.  I couldn't get it to open with anything other than WinDjView.  WinDjView is an executable and is included but it is NOT A VIRUS.  If you don't trust it you can read about it here:
