           Named by Variety as "One of the top ten comics to watch,"      
           comedian Loni Love has taken stand-up comedy to new            
           heights. As a regular panelist on E!'s hit late night          
           show Chelsea Lately, Loni has quickly emerged as a comic       
           force to be reckoned with. Her passion for making people       
           laugh and ability to relate to the audience has                
           catapulted her into comedic stardom. Growing up in the         
           projects of Detroit, Loni has never forgotten the people       
           and places that made her the entertainer she is today.         
           And now, in her one hour comedy special, Loni regales her      
           hilarious experiences from all over the country and            
           proves why she has earned the title, Lone Love: America's      
           Sister
