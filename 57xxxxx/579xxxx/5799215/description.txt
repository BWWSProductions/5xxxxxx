The â€œDirectorâ€™s Cutâ€ of Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars sees the games not only realised on new formats, but also featuring hours of brand new content, making it ideal for newcomers through to die-hard fans. Amongst the changes and additions are the following:

    * In a move that will delight fans and enrich the experience of first-time players, a whole new story arc has been written for Nico. This tale of murder and ancient mysteries provides a wealth of background to the original plot, as well as an emotional and exciting exploration of the hidden secrets in Nicoâ€™s family
    * All new character facial animation, based on work by legendary comic book artist Dave Gibbons (Watchmen, Beneath a Steel Sky), improves the visuals for both versions of the game
    * Puzzles have been adjusted to utilise the unique opportunities made available by the DS and Wii interfaces
    * An all-new Help System recognises when players are stuck, and prompts them with context-sensitive hints, each beginning with cryptic nudges and eventually offering clear solutions
    * A diary for both George and Nico records the events experienced so far acting as a resource for players needing to remember key details, and enhancing puzzles
