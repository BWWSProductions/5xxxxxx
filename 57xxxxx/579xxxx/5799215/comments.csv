,dno256,2010-09-12T20:30Z,@Zein17 You gotta replace the crack which is on the disc. It should work then
,DLoThuggin,2010-09-15T17:27Z,"Hi. I downloaded both Postmortem's and TiNYiSO's version of this game. I install the game. I then replace the crack.

The game starts up fine. When I actually play, the background is in white. I can't really see much. Except for Nico and the Corpse. Has anyone else expierenced this problem?

I have windows 7. GFORCE 250 GPS Core Series GFX Card. Is it the crack or Windows 7? I'm confused. Much help greatly appreaciated :)"

,Kirbyroth,2011-01-21T21:35Z,crack dosent work says invalid ms dos function when i tired to copy it over
,theangelofold,2011-01-22T12:08Z,"The game works great, it's truly fantastic and brings back memories. However, I do urge everyone to support the company responsible for this product, Revolution, as it is a relatively small software developer, and buy the game (the games are quite inexpensive). I currently own all the games, fully paid at launch prices, showing my appreciation for undoubtedly a very well made product."
,KG75,2011-04-21T23:56Z,"No crack came with the download, doesn't work here. "
,gipper82,2011-05-15T08:15Z,thanks so much! loving the game so far^^
,Pilari,2011-06-07T05:53Z,"!!!PERFECT TORRENT!!!

- really nice seed (I received it in 30min)
- simple iso
- crack included!

so for the whiners and downers above :

1. download
2. use iso with virtual clone drive (or burn)
3. run setup
4. copy the file that's in the tinyiso map
5. paste it in the general map of the game
(so where you installed the game, normally Program Files etc etc)

And the fun can begin! :D

I only explained cause games like these should get way more popular! Adventure games like these atleast challenge the mind and are a great example proving not all games are zombie food.

So all try & enjoy! Thx for this great torrent and the great seeding that comes with it :) "
,Pilari,2011-06-13T18:17Z,"well I completed game already AND without any troubles EVER! 

so don't be a hater just because your system sucks...

this torrent is perfect, good seed - simple working install - and no virusses what so ever!"
,endo3,2011-06-14T17:26Z,"why i can't install the game, i keep getting this error that i can't copy a number of files, tryed reinstalling and redownloading a couple of times and with different rip team copyes"
,jfdc,2011-08-23T12:55Z,"this is a perfect,clean torrent!Well done bone man,4people having probs,thats what i did on vista 32bit:

,rockinsoul,2011-11-11T14:57Z,"I cannot figure out how to install this.  I have read the instructions, mounted with daemon, installed, but it asks for a verification code.  The tinyiso file is a system information file which will not open.  I have copied it into the program folder in program files, but still it won't work.  Can anyone help on this issue please?  Thanks in advance :)  Thanks for the upload btw"
,yogdagon,2011-12-23T20:22Z,Thank you all. Works just fine.
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2012-01-25T21:18Z,"Excellent, thank you very much my friend! But does anyone know a way to extend the box and make it full screen?"
,LiveInABox,2012-02-22T16:42Z,@TheBlackWhirlwind in options tick full screen. Works perfectly though TBH the original is better than the directors cut.
,gamefreeze,2012-03-20T02:10Z,Anyone have any advice on the crack copied and pasted a few times uninstalled and reinstalled and redownloaded still asking for aserial number any help appreciated thx
,Vynuxys,2012-04-02T13:40Z,"guys, the crack doesn't appear to be in my folder. i think it might be an antivirus that removes it during the download or corrupts the file, i don't know - but it's not in the download folder for me. i even tried disabling my antivirus (avast) and redownloading but still nothing. any advice?"
