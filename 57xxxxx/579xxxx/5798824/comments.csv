,vector1818,2010-08-31T14:32Z,"OK were do i start with this movie.is it worth me writing a review,well stay tuned and you will find out.lets just say this is gonna be a very lazy review.after watching this movie,i can say that I've broke my record for the worst movie ever made and I've watched thousands of movies.it starts of were 28 days later did,a deserted London.it doesn't take a genius to guess how many survivors are left as says the movie.one as got a drinking problem,another one thinks hes rambo etc.they have a strall round London trying to figure out whats gone on,which takes nearly all the movie and then a awful little twist at the end.this movie is a disgrace,how can they make tripe like this these days is beyond me.there's know story,the acting is truly addismall.the actors were so miscast,and at at times just embarrassing.if there was one movie that didn't need to be made than this is it.danny dyer will do any movie thats thrown at him as long as hes getting a paycheck at the end of it,its a joke.i would rather watch home made bread rise in the oven than watch this movie again. its the worst movie on the planet by a long way i cant stress enough.please people stay away from this tripe,its not even worth bird feed.do some bird watching,anything just to stay away from this TERRIBLE movie "

,dsgjsd2,2010-09-01T21:54Z,"After 45 minutes? Some psyko with painted face (is this those flicks you must be high) remove nail from crosses, a person spends at least 20 minutes exploring  the concept of a empty city . A grunt keeps pointing his gun in all six faces if they dont give up their names(me??! Adolf Hitler and you asshole with gun sublimation for dick case syndrom in metric tons?). A 10, v 10 but the first 45 sucked methan."
,harpzsr,2010-09-02T02:50Z,this film is crap ....... dnt waste your time...

thanks for upload"
,thexend,2010-09-03T11:45Z,"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER WATCHED.

Seriously.  Worst director ever.  The story DRAGS on for 30 minutes of 3 people just walking around empty london, and they are not even talking.  A big waste of time.  No character development, horrible acting, and no real plot.

F-"
,snilloc,2010-09-03T14:18Z,"Very, very funny.  

I am sooooo glad you lot watched it for me and saved me the bother.  

Thanks to the up-loader and thanks to all of you for the entertainment:)"
,Agent.25i,2010-09-03T16:48Z,"THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE!!!!

Yea, as some say, it was slow building but what an ending! 

All you movie noobs complaining it was too slow, or that nothing was said for the  first bit... have you never heard of tension before, lead up, or anxiety???

@Vector, refrain from any more reviews in the future please... yours was ""addismal"". lmao you fuckwad."
,Agent.25i,2010-09-03T16:52Z,"Amazing movie.
Unless you're an ignorant american with the attention span of a 2 year old with ADD."

,dawnthief,2010-09-04T17:21Z,"I should have listened to these reviews....was this a made for TV film?  Shit was boring, and nothing really happens. 

Honestly, nothing really happens - retarded purgatory movie."
,rapanui84,2010-09-05T00:51Z,"MAJOR FAIL!

What a fucking ANNOYING, senseless piece of shit movie. Honestly i ask myself why and how such movies get produced.

Oh and the ACTING is also horrid.

Definate waste of time this one."
,Mulreay,2010-09-05T14:42Z,Well it has got Danny Dyer in it so it must be shite!

,pigsikk,2010-09-06T10:32Z,this movie is terrible. worst movie ive probably ever watched..  ive seen some bad shit but damn this was jus crap..i normally like tamer hassen too...
,cheesburgerWalrus,2010-09-07T10:43Z,"Despite all the BAD reviews this movie got i actually think that it is watchable... not too bad, a little dry but what do you expect from an brittish film... its not any worse than shawn of the dead or lesbian vampire killers... LOL... i know thats not saying much..."
,weasle316,2010-09-10T04:01Z,"Why don't you all shut the fuck up and use the comment section for what it was meant to be used for.

If your not rating the audio and video or correcting stupid fuckers, leave your 2 cents out and go to Imdb to bitch about it.

Audio 10/10
Video 9/10"
,werthers,2010-09-11T02:44Z,It's got danny dyer in it that is all you need to know stay clear of it! Shite and that's coming from a brit
,DedRed,2010-09-11T08:32Z,"This movie keeps you guessing as to what is really going on right til the end. Most of the time I can tell you the ending of a movie after 5 minutes, this one ... not a snowballs chance in hell. I'm still not 100% clear on the very last seen but it is interesting and cause for thought. If you think Shakspear is a rapper then this movie is not for you. If you think the Transporter series of movies are works of art then this movie is not for you. If you think the word religion is another way of saying redneck, then this movie is not for you. If you enjoy movies that come up with creative ways to tell a story then you'll like The Last Seven."
,sheeplee,2010-09-11T11:56Z,DEDRED SHUT THE FUCK UP.WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU BLABBERING ABOUT?THIS MOVIE IS CRAP.
,qwert9876,2010-09-13T00:16Z,Dont get why people are saying bad things about this movie. I thought it was great. Can be a little slow at times but it was well done overall with great ending. A10/V10 
,dsgjsd2,2010-10-09T22:08Z,agent.25: Tension: What have that voodo dude removing nails from crosses have anything with what ever to do for starters or walking around at least 20 minutes and yelling and only smash one puny car (low budget?). I got it after 5 minutes (that empty city concept). The magnificient end??!! They all have got killed in bomb explosion.
