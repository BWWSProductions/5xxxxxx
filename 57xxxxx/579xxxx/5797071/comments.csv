,Agrippa,2010-08-31T10:53Z,"Oh for fuck's sake.....  Are you nitwits aware of a thing called Google?

Peter F. Hamilton is a SCIENCE-FICTION writer and this is a SCIENCE-FICTION book.  And you are a pair of royal numbnuts."

Suppose the genome project was a waste of money."

The past 4-5 sci-fi books I've read I've had to wait Â½-1 year from the were on the market until I could buy them non-hardback. 

I would have paid *more* (slightly :-) for a paperback! (Â½ year ago, when I was holding the hardback in my hand, was *really* tempted to buy it!).

... And now I got an ebook reader! ...And dl it. Not proud of myself... :( Will try to remember to buy it. I have all his other books..."

I 'll buy the softcover eventually"
