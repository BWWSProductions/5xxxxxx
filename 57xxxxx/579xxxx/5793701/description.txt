Drumlin Bay, Cornwall, 1790s - Tamsyn Trelawney is the greatest smuggler in all of Cornwall. 
However, things would be a bit easier if her drunken father Jago stopped claiming her successes as her own.

Tamsyn often has to face trouble with the local authorities, in particular ruthless Captain Marriot. 
Things change however with the new arrival of Major Thomas Falconer.
He refuses to believe that a woman could be responsible for all the smuggling, therefore she usually manages to avoid capture.
