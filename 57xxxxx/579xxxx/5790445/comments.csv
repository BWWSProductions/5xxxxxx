,ISeeCake,2010-08-28T15:05Z,"Crazy-Scamp

I tried but it didnt helped :(

I run Windows 7 64 bit"
,Lobster_Ear,2010-08-28T19:12Z,I have the same problem as Ieatcake and I tried crazy-scamps solution but it didnt work. Also my anti-virus program is telling me that a few of the files including the mafia2.exe are carrying a virus
,Furkan0707,2010-08-28T19:24Z,"Yes , its working .. Im in chapter 3"
,Lobster_Ear,2010-08-29T01:29Z,So is anyone else having my problem? I'm really worried about the virus thing. None of your anti-virus software detected a virus? I can't be the only one.
,varnav2,2010-08-29T11:19Z,"You must have latest PhysX and latest DirectX, both are in the 3rd folder, but it is also recommended to update graphics drivers."
,varnav2,2010-08-29T11:20Z,Lobster_Ear: Some antiviruses consider cracks and cracked files as viruses.
,JoshF136,2010-08-29T11:35Z,i get a mafia2.exe error everytime i try to play it
,varnav2,2010-08-29T16:31Z,"And, well. Mafia 1 was much, much better!"
,Crazy-Scamp,2010-08-29T19:03Z,"Guys Try This 

1. In The Unzipped Folder Goto ""3rd"" Folder

2. Run And Install ""PhysX_10.05.12_9.10.0512_SystemSoftware""

3. Open Unzipped Folder

4. Click ""launcher"""
,JoshF136,2010-08-29T19:53Z,still doesn't work
,Lobster_Ear,2010-08-30T00:25Z,"Is there a specific place in the C: drive where I should place the folder?

Also when I go to the properties of the main folder it has ""Read only"" checked and whenever I uncheck it and go back in my properties it's checked again."
,smoin1110,2010-08-30T02:36Z,"ALL WORKING FINE TILL NOW

THIS IS A GOOD TORRENT!! WORTH DOWNLOAD!!!

Thanks Varnav! Good Work :)"
,Lobster_Ear,2010-08-30T07:31Z,"Well I finally got it to work. All I had to do was make an exception for the Mafia II folder in my anti-virus software. The only problem I have now is when I exit the game my screen is dimmed, but unless someone here has a fix for that all I need to do is hit ctrl alt delete to fix it."
,ISeeCake,2010-08-30T12:08Z,"Lobster_Ear

I try that when i get home"
,varnav2,2010-08-30T16:50Z,"""when I exit the game my screen is dimmed""

That's a common problem for any version of the game."
,ISeeCake,2010-08-30T17:34Z,It worked!! ty Lobster Ear
,Lobster_Ear,2010-08-30T21:12Z,Happy to help :)
,Lobster_Ear,2010-09-01T22:17Z,"The game is working for the most part but I do get frame rate problems in specific areas and I know it's not my PC and it crashes every once in a while, but that's it"
,vaqar001,2010-09-02T03:35Z,Great Job Dude now this is what i call a download... Globe screwed this game up trying to reduce the size... once again great job...

,liver44,2010-09-03T12:33Z,i have tried all the methods suggested to get this to work but i still get the error so can someone please give me a detailed solution. 
,liver44,2010-09-03T20:54Z,PLEASE HELP!!!
,Sailaman,2010-09-11T00:58Z,"Ok, tried all the methods. Issue is, do I need to dl Phoenix or can I unzip with WinZip? Everytime I try to unzip with WinZip access denied and cannot extract the file. There a new crack file out or something?"
,MetalGeared,2010-09-19T03:27Z,"got it to work but..... major frame rate problems, almost everytime i go into a fight i lag almost to the point where it takes a second for me to move, but when i get in a car the lag goes away for some reason, other than that, good torrent"
,varnav2,2010-09-22T19:07Z,"Those mazafakaz sold just a half of the game and release DLC's to sell it to us again and again. They may fuck yourself.
Don't buy this game because that's a kind of fucking marketing scam. Download it here."
,nadroj72,2010-09-28T19:26Z,"everytime i double click the launcher, i get an error saying windows cannot access the specified path. i have updated physx and everything and i am running on administrator. idk what to do"

,guigui456,2011-01-23T16:03Z,"came back here to say that the game works flawlessly, I'm at chapter 15 right now, and everything is perfect
at the beginning I had an issue (MafiaII.exe stopped working), when I lanched the game, had to go to ""3rd"" directory and install PhysicX, probably because I have an AMD/ATI graphic card
after that, it all went smoothly thanks uploader"
