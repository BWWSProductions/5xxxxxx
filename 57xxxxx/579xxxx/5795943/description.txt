LOSSLESS quality, recoded from FLAC to ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
using "ffmpeg -acodec alac" so is ready for drag and drop in iTunes.

Due to the poor amount of lossless hardcore, post-hardcore, metalcore
and deathcore music torrents I'm starting a series of uploads using
other downloads from DD websites, forums and blogs.
