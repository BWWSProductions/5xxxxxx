Arthur Smith throws open the doors of his palatial Balham pad and invites an audience in for an evening of music and comedy. 

Arthur turns his own personal residence into a little club where a specially invited audience come to see some of the finest comedians and musicians perform music in the kitchen, comedy in the bedroom, and meet unexpected guests in the bathroom.

In Series 1 Pippa Evans was a regular, while guests across the series included Milton Jones, Stephen K Amos, Mickey Flanagan, Paul Sinha, Benjamin Zephaniah, Matt Holness, Stewart Lee and Glenn Tilbrook.

Guests on the second series include John Hegley, Andrew Lawrence, Miles Jupp, Richard Herring and Phill Jupitus.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: 
[quote]Setting the show in Smith's house give the episodes of this programme a very intimate feel, providing the listener with the rather unique feeling that they are at the gig too - something missing from most stand-up output on the radio.

If there is a weakness with the format it is that - like most of Radio 4's stand-up output - if you'd come across one of the acts before you will probably already have heard their routine. There is a lot of recycling of gags taking place in Arthur's house![/quote]
