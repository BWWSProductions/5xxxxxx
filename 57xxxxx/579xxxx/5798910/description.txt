"Before After" - Vol 4

This Japanese TV show, is a house remodeling show that each time a top class architect reforms a horrible house in Japan.

The architects in the show are called Takumi, meaning grand master, whose ideas are always amazing.

They focus on using all the space available, reusing as much material as possible, and improving the owners standard of living through style.

Although the series is ongoing, this Volume series I uploaded was recorded in the later 90's. Still, the designs are pretty amazing.
