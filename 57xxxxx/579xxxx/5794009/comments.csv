I tried this myself, there is no need to add the included registry item, just install the version you want (32 or 64 bit) and it will register itself automatically.

Good Question ? the Rarreg File Is the key to the software.. It Get's Automatically Imported During Installation. UNLIKE other uploaders Tend To Put The File in a ""Crack"" Folder And Tell U To Copy and Paste It To Winrar Installation FolderAfter Installation. Well I realized No need For That. Let Me make people Life a Little Easier By ""Just Install"".

Ur Such A Dumbass, Posting Link To a Filesharing site And To A File that actually Needs An Extracting software to extract it,,, LOL

Ammm What are u Really Trying To Say.. ? Winxp winvista Is NOT WINDOWS ????"
,cbDejaVu,2011-01-30T02:42Z,The winrar-32-BIT-393.exe file is infected with MSIL/Injector.CY Trojan.  It is definitely not a false alarm as I found a couple of text files that ended in .dat after I installed this that contain my email passwords for hotmail and gmail in one file and a second file with messenging passwords in it in the winrar directory after I installed this (which at first the anti-virus didn't detect until I ran a manual scan)  Once running a virus scan on my system found that that file was infected with MSIL/Injector.CY trojan variant.
,LllMEz,2011-01-30T22:58Z,@azek95 how can you say it worked like a charm on Windows 7 but you dont recommend it for windows users? You fail.

,tomy_pond007,2011-03-02T12:41Z,"Thanks blaze69 for awesome upload .

For all who facing trouble registering the software , if you have a previous version of Winrar then replaced it with this version you will face ""40 days trial"" problem like I had myself . to solve this :

1- Uninstall any previous ver of Winrar
2- Install this ver
3- Open the winrar
4- Create a ""rarreg.key"" file and put ""0"" in it and save it //without """" of-course
5- Drag n drop this file to the Winrar program window to remove any previous keys 
6- Drag n drop the ""rarreg.key"" file comes with this torrent in the same previous way to register your key 

enjoy

and for the record , you may skip steps 4,5 and do step 6 at once , but I prefer the clean way :-)
