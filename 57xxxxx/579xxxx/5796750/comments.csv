,mr.spok,2010-08-31T20:20Z,"hi, it is possible to directly copy it into PS3 without burning it? i mean just copy all files from iso into backupmanager folder in PS3? can anybody try it and tell us if it works with PSjailbreak USB or one of its clones (X3jailbreak, PS3key, PS3stinger, etc.)??? thanks"
,SamuDeAur,2010-09-04T16:40Z,"@mr.spok you can but need a sort of external HD or your own from ps3 connected via usb to sata.


great upload cant wait for more let the party begin!"
,mr.spok,2010-09-04T19:43Z,"i know that we can, but what about directly connect PC with PS3 and copy it - nobody on net confirmed with proof that downloaded games are working yet (why they dont just upload backups from PS3/PC): jailbreak removes protection & splits files for FAT32"
,torrenthelper201017,2010-09-09T15:06Z,@mr.spok have u tried to use a media server between your ps3 and pc it might just do the trick
,Chrisbassi,2010-09-15T16:37Z,Eboot.bin Error
,farzadsux,2010-09-21T21:24Z,Don't waste your time. Bad rip. It's a .iso file inside the rars. Extracted the files and placed inside the appropriate BLES00073 folder and does not boot via backup manager. EBOOT.bin is corrupt.
,ZackFairFF7,2010-09-23T16:39Z,"Não Funciona.
É uma iso, provavelmente não foi feito o backup usando o backup manager.

Not Works.
Its a .iso, probally not backed up with backup manager."
