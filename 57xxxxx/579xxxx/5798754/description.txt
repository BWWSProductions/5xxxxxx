I made this compilation CD of some rare and fast doo wops of some of my favorites.
Most of them are in The Marcels style with a lot of bassinging.

I also made front and backcovers in a 50Â´s look. See the bayimg link. Measurements:
Front 240 x 120 mm, and back 150 x 118 mm.

Please leave an comment if you like it.

Will seed this until I see thatÂ´s it going by itself, then I delete the torrent from my computer so
itÂ´s up to you to seed so others can download it.
