 Media7 is producing a special, one-hour programme for TVNZ 7's Spotlight     
 on Science and Technology Month.                                             
                                                                              
 This show will explore some of the many problems that journalists face in    
 dealing with developments in science and technology. It will also consider   
 some of the frustrations that scientists experience when they have to        
 explain their work to journalists.                                           
                                                                              
 We will also be joined by other science communicators like Radio New Zealand 
 Producer Phil Smith and Alan Samson who gave up science journalism for       
 academia& and Young Scientist of the Year Rebecca McLeod from Otago          
 University and David Haywood, RNZ Science Reporter will add their            
 experience and expertise.
