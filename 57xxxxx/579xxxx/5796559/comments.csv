,mndwrd,2010-08-30T21:07Z,"i done all instructions exactly and the key is accepted after that a message says ""blacklist corrupted ,update databases""and when i update nothing is downloaded and finally says update failed. i downloaded zip updates for manual update and the same happens ,please help "
,Pusher65,2010-08-31T01:44Z,"Works ok here and updates on Windows 7 x64. Downloaded latest trial version, followed KasperskyLAB's instructions 1-3. Didn't use the code in step four and didn't have to use step 5, I just deleted the old key and re-activated the trial version and did step 6. 2048 days ! Thanks and much appreciated."
,jerz83,2010-08-31T17:25Z,"Nice one KasperskyLAB... thanks for sharing the step 6 and also to the uploader. that's what i'm looking for. and to all the dumbass, just follow the instructions and stop complaining coz this crack really works. i have something to share, for those can't activate KIS2011 using 11111-11111-11111-11111 and can't browse the key file.. you may use this handy tool http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5767162/Kaspersky_2011_Key_Changer_(Drag-n-Drop)_Activator_Time_saver_by . this method is same as activating via command prompt."
,jerz83,2010-08-31T17:49Z,"another thing... for those who had experienced ""blacklist corrupted ,update databases"" maybe you using the version 11.0.0.232. Just uninstall it (using uninstaller softwares, run ccleaner and clean temp files/registry etc), download and install the latest version 11.0.1.400. Most importantly, follow the cracking instructions up to step 6 (kasperskyLAB's instruction), and it will work 100%."
,sparkylad55,2010-08-31T18:01Z,Works perfectly. Just make sure you browse to correct folder (C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 ) as the default doesn't include the last bit. Did have a problem on first restart. Got an error message and kaspersky didn't start. Reinstalled the genuine product and it recognised the 2048 day key.
,sparkylad55,2010-08-31T18:05Z,Thank you ThumperTM you are a star.

,steve81262,2010-08-31T21:20Z,I followed all the instructions from 1 to 6. It gave me 385 days on KIS then after the update it says licence blocked...
,Magnetostorm,2010-09-01T05:16Z,"Worked well for me, Happened not exactly with instruction but I got 2048 days!! Expires april 9, 2016..:)...Thanks ThumperT"
,jerz83,2010-09-01T09:37Z,"for those who failed. uninstall your KIS/KAV 2011. use an uninstaller software and ccleaner to make sure it is uninstalled without traces. download and install the latest KAV/KIS 2011 version. follow the 6 easy steps. be sure that the crack was installed in the correct folder C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 .. if you don't know how to do step 6, go to kaspersky website, there's an instruction there on how to add exclusions. failure to do step 6, the 2084 days key will be blocked. another thing, if you done it successfully, then update the KIS/KAV 2011. 2 separate updates will be given to you."
,pochoman15,2010-09-02T04:08Z,Gracias funciona super bien THx bro
,torrent143,2010-09-02T04:15Z,"WoW! This thing REALLY WORKS on my win7 64bit! *****/*****

1st. A Very Big Thank You to ThumperTM! Great Work Dude!

2nd. Thanks to jerz83! for telling us to uninstall the older version of Kaspersky (using uninstaller softwares, run ccleaner and clean temp files/registry etc), then to install latest version 11.0.1.400.

3rd. Thanks to KasperskyLAB! for a very well informed instructions.

Peace Out!"
,tuhin619,2010-09-02T09:58Z,"hey... i ve dwnloaded this crack. everything went fine.. license were for 2084days... all i cud get is ONE time update... 2nd time update is not possible.

don't just believe me guys.. I may b wrong. try it by urself..."
,rambo180,2010-09-02T18:40Z,"nope, ok, i've followed ALL instructions in these comments, still can't seem to get it.

Downloaded latest version on KIS 2011,
installed it,
closed it,
used crack on folder C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011,
opened it,
entered 11111-11111-11111-1111X,
browsed to find key starting KIS...,

now it currently says i'm protected for 349, but judging from comments, I don't think it's going to last.

So I couldn't do step 6 because the file wasn't there, which leads me to believe that the crack actually didn't do anything. when i used the crack, i browsed to the folder and it took me back to the first window of the crack. when i tried to press it again to make sure it worked, an error message came up in German, which said something about restarting Windows. Having restarted Windows I still can't get it to work. Can anyone tell me if I'm using the key wrong because all of theis restarting and uninstalling/installing is VERY frustrating. thanks"
,rambo180,2010-09-02T19:00Z,"aaaaaaaaaaaaahahaha shut my mouth...

i thought 'enable protection' was the same as 'enable self-defence'. found it now!!! 2048 days!!! Thanks ThumperTM!"
,bricolerph,2010-09-02T22:50Z,"Followed all 5 steps per ThumperTM. My kaspersky 2011 11.0.1.400 says ""incorrect key activation date."" Clicking the ""Fix it now"" button makes the ""License management"" window appears, with 2 tabs:

Tab 1:

XXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXXXX [Key] Active
Commercial for 2048 computers for 2048 days
Valid from 5/12/2016 to 1/4/2018 11:59:59 PM
Incorrect activation date

Tab 2

XXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXXXX (X)
Commercial for 2048 computers for 2048 days
Will be valid from 10/3/2010 12:00:00 to 5/12/2016 11:59:59 PM

I cannot update Kaspersky; the Update Center cannot be accessed, whether the update is set to automatic or manual.

Adding KasperkyLAB's 6th step does not change anything.

What should I do to fix activation date error and enable updates?

Please, ThumperTM, KasperskyLAB, or anyone: HELP!"
,bricolerph,2010-09-02T23:41Z,"The above is what happens when using the KIS key; using the KAV key activates the program with a 2049-day license, BUT switches to Kaspersky Antivirus even when you installed Kaspersky Internet Security.

Maybe a different KIS key is needed? Do you have another KIS key that works, ThumperTM?

Your upload works 100% for KAV, but not for KIS."
,bricolerph,2010-09-03T00:07Z,"OK, got KIS working now and updating--with 2681-days license!

What I did was to upgrade KAV (2048-days license) to KIS (trial version), then used Thumper TM's other KIS key, following the instructions here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5788270/Kaspersky_Internet_Security_2011_Working_keys__ThumperTM_

KIS 11.0.1.400 is still updating. Will report back if anything goes wrong from hereon.

Thanks again, ThumperTM! Upped this torrent's rating to +9."
,DoodleBop,2010-09-03T00:11Z,"bricolerph@ He didn't use the KIS key you retard .. he used the KAV key provided with the crack.

It seems like the Key is valid from 2016 to 2018, its actually of no use."
,bricolerph,2010-09-03T02:57Z,"If an IDIOT like you, DoodleBop, could only learn to read properly, you'd learn something. As it is, you may just need to go back to whatever hole you were ditched by your wicked momma or your bad karma.

As I've written, the KIS key in this torrent resulted in an activation date error and inaccessible update button. The KIS key in another ThumperTM torrent worked well, enabling update.

Two issues remain for me:

1. As Nootysurf noted, Kaspersky detects hacktool.win32.kiser.tp in wtsapi32.dll. This may or may not be a false positive and you may or may not add this to Kaspersky's exclusions to remove the warnings. I guess one has to choose whom to trust--ThumperTM or Kaspersky.

2. Kaspersky seems unable to update after the first update, getting timed out at every subsequent attempt. This seems to confirm what a previous commenter noted, but am still observing.

If others could also report objective observations, we could help one another to develop and improve useful and brilliant hacks like this one.

Be not like this useless DoodleBop creature who only manages to show its being intellectually challenged and homophobia every time it crawls out of its rock!  "
,derwantus,2010-09-03T15:23Z,"Thanks for the nice work! However, mine gave me 348 days and not 2048. Any reasons why?"
,jerz83,2010-09-04T07:41Z,"i had this experience after 2 days when i successfully done the cracking instruction. the key just got blocklisted. so i had to find out why. i had this idea to add also wtsapi32.ini which was extracted from the k11crakv1.exe in the exclusion list. i've tried it, delete the key, install the key again, exit the KIS2011, and open again the KIS2011. after that, i was surprise it was not blocklisted anymore. as of now so far so good. i don't know if the .ini was also important to be added in the exclusion because it is just a plain text file. anyways, this crack really works! i've already tested it on five computers."

,sk1viking,2010-09-05T20:55Z,"WORKED FLAWLESS THANKS TO THE UPLOADER

JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TOOK 2MIN TO 

GET 2048 DAYS ACTIVATION."
,bricolerph,2010-09-06T13:08Z,"ok, i've tried this for several days now. No problem with activation, indeed. I got 2681 days. There is a big problem with updates, however. Kaspersky would not update, or would present problems updating, after the first time. There is also a big problem about Kaspersky not starting at all. I've had to get Kaspersky repair itself several times to get it to start. Each time the activation is acknowledged by Kaspersky (no problem here), but the databases need to be updated all over again, from zero.

Unless these problems regarding updates and startup are solved, I have to thumb this crack down: -20!

Any solution from anyone? "
,jerz83,2010-09-06T17:11Z,"@bricolerph: i never experienced that problem. as of today my KIS2011 with this crack is running so well, no problems with updates. what key did you use?"
,jerz83,2010-09-06T17:49Z,"@bricolerph and to all: i would like to share to you what i did in order for this crack to work on my pc. at first attempt i also failed. KIS was not functioning well at start up and it never opens. so i decided to uninstall and install it again. it's a very painstaking job coz i've done the process 4 times but no luck. so i decided now to use revo uninstaller and ccleaner making sure there's no kaspersky traces left even the settings and activation i made previously. after the long process of uninstallation and installation process. bingo! i finally manage to make KIS working again. then i disabled self-defense, and close kaspersky. i installed the crack in the correct folder then i added the wtsapi32.dll in the exclusion list . after that i got this problem. i can't browse the key.... my last resort is to use command prompt activation method using kaspersky key changer drag and drop. i use the key for KIS2011 which was included in this crack. i successfully done the activation. then i tried to update. the update process was too slow. they gave me 2 updates. 1st was asking for a restart. so i restarted my pc. 2nd update was successful and fast. after 2 days the key was blocked. so my solution (even if i'm not sure if it would work) is to add the wtsapi32.ini in the exclusion. i restarted my pc, uninstall and install the the same key again. wow, it was not blacklisted anymore. until now it is running smoothly. i don't know why others having problems with this crack. this crack is just like the previous cracks used for version 7, 2009, 2010. but the only difference is you must manually add the files extracted from the crack on the exclusion list. i hope this long story telling will help you."
,bricolerph,2010-09-07T01:39Z,"DO NOT USE THIS CRACK EVER! I have tried to get this to work (see my previous posts here), trying everything, even jerz83's suggestions. Again, the crack activated my Kaspersky IS 2011 for 2681 days. But I encountered problems with updates and Kaspersky not starting. Finally decided to uninstall Kaspersky and this crack until I could find no traces of them. Now, I can no longer install Kaspersky--not 2011 or 2010. Something seems to interfere with Kaspersky's install process--the installation goes well until Kaspersky is about to start, then NOTHING!

I can only conclude that this crack has somehow taken over my system, wreaking havoc at my antivirus/internet security.

Now, I am still open to suggestions as to how my problems may still be remedied and this crack made to work. BUT please do not simply insist that this works or repeat ""solutions"" already presented before this post. They simply do not work.

Unless anyone can give concrete solutions (and no namecalling, please), I have to warn everyone against using or downloading this crack and declare it A NASTY MALWARE. "
,avik1988,2010-09-08T05:41Z,THANK YOU!
,jerz83,2010-09-08T13:33Z,@bricolerph: here's my suggestion if it's ok for you. You should try it to another PC if you have. Just for a test. Maybe a pc with a newly installed OS. Let's say it's just for experiment purposes in order to isolate the problems and find solutions. is it ok for you to do that?
,rambo180,2010-09-16T19:35Z,"OK, a bit of a warning, I had this working perfectly for a few days, now whenever i try to start up kaspersky i get 'kaspersky has stopped working' and it immediately closes. so i now have no internet security at all. whether this is a problem with the crack or with windows though, im not sure. anyone else experienced this?!?!?"
,jerz83,2010-09-17T16:25Z,@rambo180: im also experiencing that kind of problem as of now. my analysis is that this is due to kaspersky updates. i think this crack does not work anymore. kaspersky can now block pirated users even if it's using anti-blacklist crack. i hope we can find solution for this.
,miszry,2010-09-18T20:24Z,The KAV is Working...the KIS is Not Working :( any solution the keyfile was blocked and it doesnt start after i turn on my Pc...Any solution...9/17/2010/

i restarted , after UPDATING kis, it BLOCKED KEY....

any help ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????"
,jackpentium,2011-09-15T20:52Z,"it's quiet funny how activate this crack. so, here's what i did:
1.disable self defense and close kaspersky
2.open k11crakv1.ex & choose your install folder
3. start kaspersky and (still don't) enable self defense
4. in fourth step i tried to enter the 11111-11111-11111-11111 number, but no response. kaspersky still give me the 3 method to activate: commercial, kaspersky antivirus trial, and kaspersky internet security trial.
5. i was hopeless, i choose the 2nd (kaspersky antivirus trial) via internet.
6. voila! it gave me 2049 days remaining before kaspersky expired.
7. enable self defense.

Note: i use the ""kav11.0.0.232en"" version downloaded from FileHippo, not the last version of kaspersky 2011.

Now i'm updating mine after 1 time crashes my windows and 3 times install and uninstall kaspersky (use kaspersky remover to uninstall) because the ""Kaspersky Anti-Virus 11.0.2.556"" version."
