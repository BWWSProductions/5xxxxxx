,AtomSoft,2010-08-26T19:54Z,Still using Russian Video... Why? I want to be able to read all the little messages on the side and stuff. Your telling me no one got english video?
,leracos,2010-08-28T11:14Z,"FFS why cant someone just go see it in theaters, take a pad and paper, and copy down the English text and type up an SRT file? lol Then we wouldn't NEED the English text version.

I'd do it, but I'm out of town on business. Probably shouldn't be pirating shizzle on the company's dime/T3 line..."
