Work done:


Here we go with our version of Scott Pilgrim.Well this was a dark movie and we brightened as 
much as we could with out ruining the black in it.We did our normal stuff to it as we said
we brighten the movie along with saturation,contrast,denoiser and finally a sharpen filter
to it.The audio is from IMAGINE and aside from the ocassional static and another radio 
station coming in about 3 or 4 times it's very good better then cam that's for sure
so you have been warned.Many thanks to EleKtriKa and IMAGINE.Hope you all enjoy from team
FLAWL3SS
