Identical twins Oliver and Oswald Deuce lose their wives in a car crash caused by a swan.
The brothers, who are zoologists, become obsessed with the death and decay of animals.
 They both have a relationship with Alba, the driver of the crashed car, 
who loses first one leg then the other. When Alba dies, the twins film their own death.
