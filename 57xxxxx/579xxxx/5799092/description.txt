This file is an .MP4 of The Worthless Virtuoso (to be watched on Ipods and other portable media devices.)
The Worthless Virtuoso is a silent comedy/drama directed by Curtis Mutter. The film was shot entirely on Super 8 Plus-X reversal stock, and while the gags are certainly inspired by the work of Chaplin and Buster Keaton, they are all original (or at least an old, well used gag in an original context.) Production began in late 2007 and finished June 2010.
