,One_Burnt_Potato,2010-08-30T00:13Z,How is this out already? It only just came out in cinemas? Good movie
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-30T01:10Z,"@ One_Burnt_Potato - With R5s you never really know when it will be released, cuz they (Film Companies) are constantly changing the release dates. It was released or it got leaked, anyways enjoy the great movie! 

@ everyone - man oh man, I cant wait for September 1, 2010. Why, you ask, because my cap (Internet Bandwidth Cap) is reset, cuz I went over this month big time, I hope I dont get a call or letter, fingers crossed. (=_=)

I am currently working on several releases which include - Sons of Anarchy S02, The New Adventures of Old Christine S03, Burn Notice S01, Fringe S01, several Stand-Up packs, several XxX packs, and a couple of movie packs.

Also, I start college tomorrow, So wish me good luck! (*=*)"
,One_Burnt_Potato,2010-08-30T01:34Z,"@Daywalker  Letter? As in you need to pay more for the internet? I dont get it.

Good luck... I go back to grade 11 on september 7 I think ):"
,bara-d,2010-08-30T02:17Z,"i have just downloaded it from another source :(

,zero.nine20,2010-08-30T02:47Z,"here comes again!!!
tnx a lot mate...
were do i download the THE GHOST RIDER...for my psp..tnx"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-30T03:25Z,"@ bara-d - To answer your question, Mine is better!
Why you ask? - 
I used a better source (an R5 source, that had better quality and more detail).  His source was VISIONs DVDSCR -  
Mine is better quality, it is a smaller file size, it is at a bigger resolution (480x208), mine is in the .m4v format which is iTunes / iPod friendly format, mine is compatible with more devices and looks better on more devices.
Plus mine is being seeded from a seedbox and it already has 40 seeders.

I hope that that answers your question. (^_^)

@ One_Burnt_Potato - No, I am not worried about paying more, I am worried about them cutting me off (dropping me), cuz tthey are the fastest Internet provider at the current moment in my area."
,One_Burnt_Potato,2010-08-30T04:59Z,"Yo Daywalker, have you seen this movie that came out last year?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/

Its called ""The Human Centipede""   LOLs, If you have time to encode this one, that would be great. If your full up thats fine. No one has done it for psp and ipod yet

Heres the plot.

Two pretty but ditsy American girls are on a road trip through Europe. In Germany, they end up alone at night with a broken car in the woods. They search for help and find an isolated villa. The next day, they awaken to find themselves trapped in a terrifying makeshift basement hospital along with a Japanese man. An older German man identifies himself as a retired surgeon specialized in separating Siamese twins. However, his three ""patients"" are not about to be separated but joined together in a horrific operation. He plans to be the first person to connect people via their gastric systems. By doing so, he plans to bring to life his sick lifetime fantasy, the human centipede
