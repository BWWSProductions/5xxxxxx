Charles Dutoit (born 7 October 1936) is a Swiss conductor, particularly noted for his interpretations of French and Russian 20th century music. He has made influential modern recordings of Hector Berlioz's Romeo et Juliette and Maurice Ravel's ballets Daphnis et Chloe and Ma mere l'oye.

In 1977, Dutoit became the Artistic Director of the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal (OSM). During his tenure, the recording profile and reputation of the OSM increased. He has earned more than 40 international awards and distinctions, including two Grammy Awards (USA), several Juno Awards  (Canada), the Grand Prix du President de la Republique (France), the Prix mondial du disque de Montreux (Switzerland), the Amsterdam Edison Award, the Japan Record Academy Award, and the German Music Critics' Award. He and the OSM made many recordings for the Decca/London label. Dutoit resigned from the Montreal Symphony in April 2002 after a bitter dispute with the musicians' union.
