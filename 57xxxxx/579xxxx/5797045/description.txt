Hazen Street (also known as Hazen St.) is a supergroup that formed in early 2004.

The band features Freddy Cricien and Hoya of New York hardcore band Madball; Toby Morse of melodic hardcore band H2O; David Kennedy of post-hardcore band Box Car Racer, Over My Dead Body, and later Angels & Airwaves; and Mackie of The Cro-Mags & the Bad Brains. Chad Gilbert of Shai Hulud and later New Found Glory co-wrote and helped record every song on the album, but he was soon dismissed from Hazen Street by New Found Glory's record label due to a contract dispute. He was replaced by Mitts of Madball.
