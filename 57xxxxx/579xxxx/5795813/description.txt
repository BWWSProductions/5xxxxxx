           Four Lions tells the story of a group        
           of British jihadists who push their             
         abstract dreams of glory to the breaking        
           point. As the wheels fly off, and their          
          competing ideologies clash, what emerges        
               is an emotionally engaging farce. In a           
               storm of razor-sharp verbal jousting and        
              large-scale set pieces, Four Lions is a           
             comic tour de force; it shows that-while      
          terrorism is about ideology-it can also       
                     be about idiots.
