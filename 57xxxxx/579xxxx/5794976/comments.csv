,OILFAN79,2010-08-31T02:51Z,"@trin02 - djfred stopped uploading so he wont reseed any torrents AND if you read the descriptions he deletes the movies after he uploads them so he doesnt even have the files.


I dont want to sound like a hypocrite requesting something after that rant but ctang do you have Just Buried from 2007 with Jay Baruchel?

Thanks as always"
[T],ctang,2010-08-31T14:01Z,no i dont have any of those movies unfortunately...i do the same thing...if people want me to do more movies that means i have to delete movies from my computer...if i upload something in dvd9 that means i really cant reseed because i compress everything and put on a dvd5 disc...sorry about your bad luck trin02 and oilfan79...i cant help

[T],ctang,2010-09-02T18:50Z,your welcome...is this movie even worth watching...i havent watched it yet...saw it has less than 3.0 on imdb...wow
,trytryagain1,2010-09-02T19:36Z,You know I personally don't watch that much T.V. I mostly dl this stuff for my kids and wife.  The other day I heard them laughing pretty hard during some parts of the movie so I think it might be worth checking out.
