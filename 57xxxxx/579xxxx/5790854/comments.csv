,Rohan151,2010-08-27T03:02Z,"It's working on my machine just fine. Horrible game, though... runs really badly on my computer which, while not cutting-edge, is quite powerful. It's not optimised in the least, the engine is terrible, you have limited camera control, and there are issues with the sound.

It's a shame, because this could be fun in the hands of a competent team... perhaps this is the beta copy? I don't know, but as it is, it's not worth anyone's time."
,martronn,2010-08-27T08:27Z,This is the real thing everyone. works fine for me all the way. but the game in it self is crap. i think ship simulator 2009 is better.

Jeg har gjordt som der stod i NFO filen, men den lukker ned før spillet er loadet...

Hello Thistane

How did you get the game to work??

I did as was written in the NFO file, but it shuts down before the game has finished loading"
,MBenjo,2010-08-28T19:38Z,"@rubeonline: -.-"" 3.5GB is needed for the INSTALLED GAME(!!!), not for the download (DVD)..."
,santos182,2010-08-28T23:26Z,"Cant play. I installed and copyed content and then when launching the game it opens the steam in the ship simulator shop page. 

What should i do next? It never shows the activation key screen.

I'm not getting it."
,santos182,2010-08-29T02:40Z,"Uninstalled Steam.

Now it stucks on the Ship Simulator loading image.

Any sugestions?"
,stickasaurus,2010-08-29T05:37Z,"Installed fine, the only thing it didn't install was Physx. Online works. Great torrent. :)"

,drahic,2010-08-29T22:37Z,"it is best to wait a couple days to  Vstep publish  patches and then re-download the game. 

Olso u can see the other people have many problem and they are pay for this game.

,Moonbootsfc,2010-08-30T05:57Z,If your getting the dlll errors its beacuse you didn't install physX and microsoft redistributable Visual C++ just after ship sim installs. It gives you 3 boxes to tick. Make sure you tick them all and install them.

Just a 1024x768 small black screen, nothing happens."
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-08-31T12:49Z,"BLACK SCREEN ERROR:

Developers response:
''We don't know why this happens on the steam version of the game. The boxed and download version from shipsim.com doesn't seem to have this problem. Only for the steam version. We've tried everything but no solution so far''."
,BloodtakerR,2010-08-31T18:00Z,Any help with the black screen error???pls :(
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-09-01T13:21Z,"New update!
Steam has given an update for the game.
You can only download the update if you start the game via steam."
,Tasher80,2010-09-02T00:07Z,"So I was able to install the game just fine. I copied the SKIDROW files to where they need to be. I started the game, entered a random serial. I was able to get to pick a free roam or campaign. After that it won't let me select a boat. I can see the boat names and click on them but it won't let me advance any further or go back. I also can't see the actual boats just their names. Any ideas?"
,kimmey,2010-09-02T01:30Z,"http://www.shipsim.com/downloads/updates 

No prob :)"
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-09-02T11:43Z,"That isn't the update to solve the black screen problem. That is the update for the game itself.
The black screen upon startup is caused by corrupt files from the STEAM download. The same as this torrent.
Only if you have bought the game from steam, it will download a special ''steam'' update for the game."
[T],Coolguy33,2010-09-02T13:39Z,"After installation it comes up with 3 boxes to tick:
Direct x
Physics
Microsoft Redistributable Visual C++

I have ticked them all but it wont install Direct x or Physics. All it does is come up with error messeges.
The weird thing is that the game starts to load up after but then it just goes to a black screen and does nothing."
,litty123,2010-09-02T17:03Z,"Iv followed all the instructions!

,remali9004,2010-11-05T16:49Z,"Here is the solution:
Well. the game need to install (It's better to find from your own the latest DirectX, Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable anf the latest FhysX from Nvidia. 
And other way is to download the demo version
from the original website of the game.
It contains correctly all the above programs.
Also you have to be sure that you have the latest vga graphic drivers.
Well, the game can be install fine on win7.
WinXp needs to go to program folder and right click to file QuestViewer.
Set compatibility to win98/winMe2000.
That was the cause the game crashed after setup
procedure.
Hope I helped.
It's a good game with GreenPeace missions."
