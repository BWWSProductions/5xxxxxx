Jesus, why the hell are there so many? They really milk these things as much as they can don't they? It'd be nice if they made an ""ultimate"" edition that had them all for like $80 or something. Something really nice like the Forza 3 Limited Edition. That was a killer box, albeit quite small, it was still super high quality stuff you get."
