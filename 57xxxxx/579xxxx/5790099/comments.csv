,pzsmith,2010-08-30T11:25Z,Blacktroy have you managed to sort out the 10 digit activation code which is needed when you try and import any AVCHD clips in this version of AVID? Thanks for your help in advance.

,CarolR,2010-09-20T01:37Z,"I'm having the same problem as 1TWISTED.
Everytime I click on ""Download This Torrent"" 
I either get an internet error or a page comes up stating ""No Input File Specified""
I am not even getting to the point that the file is loaded into my client, so I can't ""continue"" to DL.
I have received this message in both IE and FF and have turned off all Firewalls, etc. It is almost as if the torrent/file no longer exists.
Thanks."
