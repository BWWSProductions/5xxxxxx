Avid Media Composer - the preferred choice for top-level professionals engaged in the production of film and video, and for independent producers, and for new post-production. A great tool for creative work: support for tapeless production technologies, work with any format, multikamerny HD installation and much more. 

The perfect combination of freedom of choice between different options of systems Avid Media Composer, which is best suited to the different projects: from an autonomous system with the software without additional hardware support to complete the hardware-software Avid Media Composer / Avid Digirtal Nonlinear Accelerator (Avid DNA) .

Installation of different formats on one timeline

Combining in one time line HD, SD, DV, kinoformatov and permits, as well as Avid AVR and Meridien JFIF without rendering, transcoding, or re-digitizing. Editing DVCPRO HD and HDV without rendering. Multi-chamber installation in real-time HD, SD and DV video. Support 24p. Ability to capture 24p from IEEE-1394.
Avid Media Composer is compatible with the environment Avid Unity and Avid Interplay.

Support for Sony XDCAM and Panasonic P2

Save your time! Now, Avid Media Composer, you can carry out installation of the material with Sony XDCAM and Panasonic P2 without predzahvata. Support for Sony XDCAM includes the installation of copies of low-resolution, DV and IMX in high resolution.

Avid DNxHD encoding

If you're working with HD, then you need the industry's first codec HD - Avid DNxHD, which allows you to keep the original quality HD images one by one with bandwidth comparable to that of SD. The new format Avid DNxHD delivers incredible quality of high resolution and maximum savings amount of disk space, providing an opportunity to work with the project in HD between several workstations. The flow rate of 145 Mbps (with 8-bit video in 4:2:2) and 220 Mbps (with 10-bit video in 4:2:2) with permission 720p and 1080p / i.

10-bit color correction in real time
Avid Media Composer has an effective color correction tools based on the technology of Avid Symphony. One click you can analyze the color and color correction of the entire sequence.

Support for Panasonic Varicam off-speed
Capture and playback from cameras Panasonic Varicam.

Image stabilization by using SteadyGlide
Now you can automatically stabilize the footage, which, for whatever reasons, such as camera shake, become unfit for use in the project. As a result, you will greatly save your cost and time to work.

FluidMotion

With FluidFilm you can create slow motion effects and "fit-to-fill" (stretch to the desired length) from any video using patented pixel morphing technology. Control the speed and position is performed by means of keyframes defining the curve. You can also make your 30i footage 24p or video form with function FluidFilm.

SpectraMatte Keyer

Keying can be a difficult task when working with 8mi bit format, such as DVCPRO HD. Now you can create high-quality keying and replay it in real time using a 16-bit technology SpectraGraph. Interactive environment helps an editor quickly find the key keingovy color, without wasting time on the method of "spear".

Working with GOP

Media Composer system now can work with the structures of MPEG GOP, having size smaller than the standard 15 frames. This feature allows users to export HDV material without rendering the entire sequence.

Record 4-channel audio through a microphone
4 channel audio recording straight to a time-line, without spending time on the capture and assembly of the material. During the dialogue or narration, you can record on a time line of several voices at once, which will greatly reduce the time for voiceovers.

Watching videos in full screen mode via DVI output
Now you can display SD and HD content in full screen mode on the LCD monitor, using a standard DVI connector.

Professional tools for working with film material
Each system features built-in Media Composer Avid Film Composer metadata management. The seizure of material from 24p to 25p in real time, as well as automatic synchronization of video and audio sources. Also, when working with film material available additional metadata such as: Timecode, KeyKode, DPX, VXF and UNC.

Work Directly with RED Using the Newly Improved AMA
With Media Composer 5, AMA (Avid Media Access) has been completely reengineered, so you can work natively with more file-based media formats now and in the future. With the new and improved AMA, you can speed up RED workflows by directly accessing RED files (.R3D) in Media Composer without having to prepare them through MetaFuze (all footage is scaled to HD frame size). Plus, you have access to its full metadata and color management data too.

Edit QuickTime Formats Natively
Get native access to all popular QuickTime formats, with full access to clip metadata. Thanks to AMA, you can natively access and edit any movie that can be played in Appleâ€™s QuickTime Player (including Apple ProRes and .mov files captured by Canon 5D and 7D cameras) right in Media Composer â€” no transcoding, rewrapping, or logging and transferring required.

Drag and Drop Video and Audio to Edit
Get comfortable â€” with Media Composer 5, you can truly edit the way you like. In addition to the standard way of editing, you can also now directly manipulate elements in the timeline to edit video and audio. Drag and drop clips anywhere you want on the timeline to rearrange sequences. And grab a clipâ€™s in or out point and drag to trim a scene, dialog, or music.

Get Full-Quality HD-RGB Processing
Keep those finishing jobs in house, and deliver the highest quality color and effects work, with support for full-quality 4

4 HD-RGB color space processing in Media Composer. With the higher resolution detail, you can perform color correction, keying, and effects work with greater precision and ease. And if you have a Nitris DX-based system, you can digitize, process, monitor, and output (output in Symphony systems only) projects in HD-RGB, using the two HD SDI connections to handle the high-bandwidth resolutions.

Monitor Video Externally through Matrox MXO2 Mini
If you donâ€™t have a Nitris DX- or Mojo DX-based system, Media Composer 5 opens the door to third-party workflows, enabling you to monitor video externally using the Matrox MXO2 Mini interface, which is available for Mac and Windows systems. When paired with Media Composer software, MXO2 Mini becomes a dedicated, high-quality monitor-only solution for file-based or workgroup production, so you can view your video work in real time without any major expense.
