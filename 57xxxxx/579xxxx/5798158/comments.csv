,enjoyresponsibly,2010-08-30T17:25Z,"Very good quality, would give the video 8 out of 10, and the audio 9 out of 10. 
The video does get pixelated in a few scenes, but doesnt really affect the viewing experience. Also, bit of a shame that the native aspect ratio is 4:3, (when viewed in vlc.)

Overall Rating: 9/10 
Best out there so far!"
