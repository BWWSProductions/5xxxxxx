Is there life after death? Indiaâ€™s most renowned Vedic authority presents startling evidence of the soulâ€™s
incredible journey after death. Srila Prabhupada tells how the soul travels from body to body, and how we
can end the cycle of birth and death by reaching Lord Sri Krishnaâ€™s ultimate abode. An excerpt: â€œThe simple
process of chanting the names of Krishna will reveal what one is, what God is, what the material and spiritual
universes are, why we are conditioned, how we can get out of that conditioning â€” and everything else,.â€But 
isnâ€™t it true that the essence of Christâ€™s teachings is about how to live in this world? Canâ€™t you drop your
concern for the next world and still be Christians?

Thatâ€™s like saying you can drop hope for a communist revolution and a classless society and still be a 
communist.

But hope for heaven diverts you from making earth a better place to live in. You Christians are really 
traitors to the earth.

No. Throughout history it has been precisely those who believed most strongly in the next world who did 
the most to improve this one. Thatâ€™s what you would expect. If you believe the road youâ€™re on goes nowhere,
you donâ€™t take it too seriously. If you believe it goes to somewhere important, you keep it up. If a pregnant
woman thinks her baby will be born dead, she does not take much care of it. If she hopes it will have life 
after birth, she takes care of her pregnancy.But concern for the next world is escapism.Who talks the most 
against â€œescapismâ€? Jailers. Think about it........................
