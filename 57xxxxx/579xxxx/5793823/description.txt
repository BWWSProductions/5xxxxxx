Common Ground:  Voices Of Modern Irish Music  1996

Thre isn't much documentation on line about this CD except for a few reviews 
on Amazon and a Common Ground website. The site has some information about singers/artists who contributed and information about the the various songs...  I can only describe this as an ecclictic mix of Irish artists peforming new and traditional songs.  The complilation features artists including Bono, Sinead O'Connor, Davy Spillane, Pual Brady, Christy Moore and Maire Brenan.  

Disc ripped to FLAC using EAC.  Covers, log and cue sheet included.
