,lilgruber,2011-01-13T04:04Z,"This might not bother some people, but it bothers me. There are multiple versions of many of the songs in this download that are exactly the same. I personally, don't like having multiple copies of the same song on my hard drive, as I don't have unlimited space on it, and it also makes organization confusing. Again, I might be nitpicking, but it may be something to take into account."
,freedomdwarf,2011-02-13T12:14Z,"@lilgruber:
Did you not stop to think that many artists release albums with duplicate tracks??
Thats how the record companies make their money - a handful of new songs & a couple of older ones thrown in there to make a new album... then they re-release ""The Best Of"" or ""Greatest Hits"" albums! New money for old tracks that cost bugger all to produce.
Some of us actually LIKE to save/burn albums by their original content whether they have duplicates in other albums or not.
If you don't like duplicates then only download the tracks you want and make up your own compilation. If you can't work out how to pick out bits from one torrent then don't bother with it & stop griping!!"

,riquemion,2011-07-21T19:39Z,"tnx for the upload!

it's a weird thing. someone gets into all the trouble of ripping his cd collection, starts uploading it and making it available to the world. You can download the files for free, and still some people start whining that its not good enough for them! Now look what happens when I clicked on lilgrubers little name, a page appeared which said ""Your search did not match any torrents.""... never gone into the trouble to upload something yourself mr little grubbery? 

one word: ""pathetic""

And you're right nymersic, I should just have ignored this :)"
,djh101,2011-08-03T04:49Z,"Much appreciated. And in response to lilgruber, you know you can uncheck the files/folders you don't want to download. And even if you do download them... you can delete them.

And riquernion, you really think he knows how to upload a torrent if he can't even figure out how to uncheck a checkbox?"
,aliburns,2011-08-28T18:01Z,stop whinging LILGRUBER its free.
,nosh99,2011-09-21T09:16Z,"WTF is ""simon e gartfunkel""?"
,mxyzptik,2011-10-11T07:43Z,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
,Land_Shark,2011-11-03T08:58Z,"Thank you so much rayuela69!

And btw it's not that hard to get rid of doubles. Go by name in iTunes and you can delete that way... SO hard to do T_T"
,kukis200,2012-04-26T17:58Z,"stop bickering!
