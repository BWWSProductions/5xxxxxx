,garbagebag,2010-08-31T12:27Z,"Kewl, cheers!

But I don't suppose anyone has a version with the extra 6 track that the itunes pre-order version lists:

17. Breathe In Deep
18. Take Me Where I Wanna Go
19. I Surrender
20. Love Too Hard
21. Virtual Friend (Acoustic Version).
22. Mirage (other version).

Cheers again!"

@garbagebag : i guess we should wait till the album is released :P :P "
,TMHKR,2010-09-05T00:34Z,"At the end of the ""Full Focus"" track, what are those strange sounds? It's like someone is unlocking the car with keys on a highway. Was that supposed to be in the final, original release, or it's an error? I haven't heard this anywhere else, on any other track...

Oh, and yes - if you look at the track-list on the official Armada Music web-page, you'll notice that the ""Full Focus"" track is shorter than 4:42 - it ends exactly before those ""strange sounds""."
