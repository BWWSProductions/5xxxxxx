,pjthunder,2010-09-12T13:10Z,Why do people have to fucking hard code the fucking subs? Why can't they just use their fucking heads and use a subs file included in the video? This pisses me off when people hardcode the damn translations into the video itsself...!!

,FRivera,2010-10-01T12:37Z,hey ppl is this any good for a person who likes the occasional mindless fun movie (spidermen xmen true lies aliens kickass etc) but thinks that most 80s flicks are so cheesy they could only cater to teenagers (I'm 28)??
,kchamz,2010-10-05T19:00Z,this movie is very funny i think. these actors are all so cool which makes this movie more like comedy.
,chaosheritage,2010-10-12T20:39Z,"Excellent rip, thanks m8."
,fucko31243,2010-10-20T14:44Z,"great movie, pjthunder stfu, what does it matter if they are hard coded or not, if you need them you need them, this makes it less hastle for people who just want to burn it and watch it in a dvd player without having to put the subs with it and then convert it into one file, its free, go cry somewhere else."
