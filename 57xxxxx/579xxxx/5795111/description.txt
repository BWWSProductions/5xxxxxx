Plot outline:
Stage fright leads Alice down the rabbit hole, through the looking glass, and into the pool of tears of Wonderland. Here she meets the oddest creatures imaginable, where doors lead into trees and claustrophobic halls where you shrink to three inches or grow to ten feet and get stuck in a vault. You can take tea with a Mad Hatter and play croquet with a Queen made-up as a playing card, listen to singing trees and talking flowers, or get advice from a hallucinating veteran caterpillar. But everything has a purpose, and the purpose here is to make Alice confident; it's not all fun and games.
