,usghkh,2010-08-30T20:28Z,"nicrip, thanks
any idea why movies are not in true HD aspect ratio like 16:9 ?"
,som919,2010-08-30T20:57Z,"superb

thankx man"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-09-01T09:28Z,"@ usghkh 

Because Black bars are removed, so the aspect ratio changes
It is still a 720p rip"
[V],pluto999,2010-09-01T18:13Z,The movie itself in first place ain't in 16:9 aspect ratio.
[V],pluto999,2010-09-01T18:14Z,"Aspect Ratio:
1.44 : 1
