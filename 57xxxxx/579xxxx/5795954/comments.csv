I've just discovered hubert, and was looking for this, can't believe you have this on here, your rare albums are awesome, I love the 80s and late 70s stuff the most, your collection is brilliant! that calling all girls is wild, I've been looking for that, there have been a few I've found in your collection that I've been looking for, then forgot about, you are a gift from heaven truly. the 80s was the period, most creative time, thank you for your wonderful collection. contact me sometime, I'd love to talk about your taste in music and stuff, we must be about the same age (no homo, lol)
