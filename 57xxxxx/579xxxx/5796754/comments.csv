,mr.spok,2010-08-31T20:21Z,"hi, it is possible to directly copy it into PS3 without burning it? i mean just copy all files from iso into backupmanager folder in PS3? can anybody try it and tell us if it works with PSjailbreak USB or one of its clones (X3jailbreak, PS3key, PS3stinger, etc.)??? thanks"
,kiraburu,2010-09-09T22:16Z,"spok its time to ""experiment"" all that...if you have a device to do the trick them try it. By now i cant get one but im downloading and seeding to help make some momentum to built a sharing scene here. ALL OF US MUST DO THE SAME. 'cos more great thing will come, may be sooner than we think."

,anastako,2010-10-03T11:42Z,"1) its no use to download if you have not jailbroken ur PS3 no need to even try of u have FW more than 3.41 

2) no need to burn anything if you have the appropriate tools "

,gani.slimshady,2010-10-31T02:06Z,^what's corrrupt?
,makeshift27015,2011-01-16T20:38Z,"1) This has been incorrectly packaged. You do not play PS3 backups from ISO at the moment. You must unpack the ISO using Winrar or similar.
2) You MUST have a jailbroken PS3 to play this game, and if you have a jailbroken PS3, chances are you know how to play games.
3) THIS DOWNLOAD DOES NOT WORK, AS THERE ARE NO PATCHES IN IT FOR IT TO WORK FROM DRIVE. And since I can't find the patch online, there is no way to patch this backup to run with the PS3.

As can be seen there, this game, so far, is not playable. Tested myself as well."
