Release Information

TrackStudio is an ultra-configurable bug/issue
tracking system and workflow engine that can be
used to track the progress of any kind of task such
as issue resolution, requirements gathering,
desktop support handling, project monitoring,
hardware deployment, staff hiring and document
management.

Install Notes

1) Unpack & Install
2) Run KeyMaker (java -jar KeyMaker.jar)
3) Overwrite original licene file in /etc with the
generated one.

Notes:
If you dont have an extra JRE installed, you can
use
the JRE which comes with the program. Easiest way
is to copy the keymaker to the correct dir and then
execute "java -jar KeyMaker.jar". This way you're
not
forced to install some JRE just for some keygen :)

Dirs:
Windows:
C:Program FilesCommon Filesi4jjres1.6.020bin

Linux:
/jre/bin

Attention: The lic file is generated at the place
from
which the java binary is called =)
