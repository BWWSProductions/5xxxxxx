         Relentless demons, writhing serpents, the lake of fire and    
         final judgment from the god Osiris. Ancient Egyptians         
         believed that these and other terrifying obstacles            
         challenged their pharaohs in the afterlife. The hieroglyphs   
         in the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I most clearly illustrate the     
         12 perilous gates a dead king had to navigate to achieve      
         resurrection. Enter Seti's tomb with National Geographic      
         Explorer-in-Residence Dr. Zahi Hawass as he traces this       
          king's arduous journey through the netherworld.
