Farrell & Farrell was/is a husband-wife duo that recorded albums in Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) from about 1977 to 1991. Our music ministry took us literally all over the world, including several trips behind the Iron Curtain before the wall came down. Prior to officially being Farrell & Farrell, we had several groups, including the one that made our first recording, Millennium.
