Someone marked -3 but that's often just some spammer's work. 
I'll comment once it's downloaded."

,zingo_punkbuzter,2010-09-20T22:46Z,"hi.

the first episode was great, but when i watched the 2nd and 3rd i was like; ehhh, wasn't this a KD-release? at least that was what i thought when i saw the picture u've added there neonrainbow.

i don't know what happend or where the prror is, but the 2nd and 3rd episode's audio quality is very poor, im watching this on a 42"" 200hz tv, and 7.1 surround reciever and a 12inch subwoofer, but uses 8ch stereo automaticly unless the digital input detects 5.1 surround or better. but.... still these 2 movies is the only ones i've got among the other 200 movies on my HDD that sounds like i was watching this with some laptop-speakers, or built-in-monitor speakers.... and in episode 3 i hear clicking sounds from time to time, besides some wierd music is pretty loud behind the original sound.

pls man... you are the only one who have uploaded these 3 StarWars episodes in HD, would really like if you could fix the sound tho.

besides this torrent, i love KD-releases"
