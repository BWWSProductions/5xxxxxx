,StanlyManly,2010-09-14T09:54Z,"Audio: 7 (a little to low, a little too loud sometimes, no biggie)

Video: 7.5 (DVDrip-ish, very good)

Movie: 7

No watermark, for whoever was asking.  This movie was actually pretty funny.  It's not the best Sandler movie, but it's a good movie to watch with the wife or something.  Thanks for the upload!"
