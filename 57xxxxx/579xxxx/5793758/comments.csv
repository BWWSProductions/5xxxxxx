,filee360,2010-08-28T12:47Z,oh and let me know what you think when youve got it
,thecursed,2010-09-01T20:38Z,"@piratelionheart:

You are so lame that you shouldn't be allowed on the Internet. Your puny torrent sucks monkey balls compared to a proper lossless rip like the one you're trying to talk down right here. Based on your comment you are probably too ignorant to even grasp as much. Please shut the hell up and keep your false advertising ON YOUR OWN DAMN TORRENT PAGE.

@filee360:

Thank you very much for your effort. Flawless. Sorry about the flaming above but some idiots I just can't handle."
,pira7e,2010-09-02T12:42Z,Thanks for the flac upload!
,RogueFIST,2010-09-06T02:26Z,"@thecursed
100% agree about piratelionheart, completely crap torrent"
,filee360,2010-09-06T14:22Z,"Well lets be fair, this is flac,  a lot different from the original mp3 format that can be created from flac files. 

Remember with mp3 you lose quality based on how its encoded and also the KBPS for a said section on a song.

Flac is ripped directly from a CD and then can be directly changed into MP3 first time round that allows good quality based tracks. (Depending on your chosen encoder. I.E Nero for Me)"
,tantheon,2010-09-21T00:01Z,AMEN Thanks for the Up the other advertised version on this post SUX mad props on first Up man
,newskinout,2011-05-21T07:07Z,Thank you :)
,vvn...,2011-06-26T10:29Z,@filee360 Actually mp3 is a very old and inefficient compression algorithm and has nothing to do with 'high quality'. Thanks for the Up.
