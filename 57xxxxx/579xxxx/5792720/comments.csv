,tapper101,2010-08-28T04:30Z,"Only seen about 10 minutes so far, and I like it quite a lot. It don't seem like an amazing movie, but I've already had a couple of laughs, didn't soak my pants, but it's kind of funny.

Download!

,tapper101,2010-08-28T06:05Z,"Story (and kind of a review):
It's a movie about friendship, lies/truth, love and about sticking up for yourself. 
It's a rather generic story about two friends, which are also work partners, one is a complete douchebag and a sex addict and the other one is the typical romantic nice guy. Andy, the nice guy, follows a girl to a group meeting for sex addicts (hence Group Sex), not quite knowing what he's getting in to. Getting good friends with the members of the group and they're distracting him from his job, creating a dispute with his work partner (the douche). Andy has to choose between his friend and work partner, and his new found friends at the sex addict meeting.

It's not an amazing movie, nor an amazing story for that matter. You'll have a couple of laughs and you'll enjoy yourself, but as I said earlier, it's quite generic. It's the typical hollywood medium budget comedy film with B-list actors..

I do recommend that you see the movie, but don't expect too much of it.

These bottom-feeding worms are posting a heap of these *.wmv 's at the moment.

Running in Win Media player links to a phony ""DivX"" codec site which installs Vundo (and like) trojans -see; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vundo for an exact description of the symtoms this induces..

Look out for "".wmv"" files and dicky user names - ""TvTeam"" - wankers .."
