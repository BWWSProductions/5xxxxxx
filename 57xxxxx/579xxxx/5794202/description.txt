Title:  	Microsoft SQL Server Development
Category: 	Development & Programming
Presenter: 	Paul Nielsen
Paul Nielsen believes SQL is the romance language of data. As such he's a hands-on database developer, Microsoft SQL Server MVP, trainer, and author of many books including SQL Server 2005 Bible. As a data architect, he developed the concepts of Optimization Theory and Nordic - an O/R dbms for SQL Server, and writes the data architecture column for SQL Standard magazine. Paul supports the SQL community as the Director of Global Community Development with the PASS (Professional Association for SQL Server). You may have seen Paul speaking at a PASS Summit, SQL Open in Denmark, or SQL Teach in Montreal. His website is www.SQLServerBible.com.
