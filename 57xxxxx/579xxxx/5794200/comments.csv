,lozory,2010-08-31T10:17Z,so is this just a re-encode of the other bad quality DVDSCR out there??
,lozory,2010-09-11T22:58Z,"o well i got it anyway since h264 has potential but no, v7/10 for a dvdrip or maybe 8 if you real generous. bummer"
,LackThereof,2010-09-14T03:55Z,"screening copy watermark pops up at regular intervals, never seems to obscure the action.

Quality is not what I would expect from a 700mb SD h264 encode.  Block artifacts very noticable in some scenes.  Low bitrate Divx/Xvid source?  Or maybe the screener DVD's Columbia's handing out now are unusually low bitrate.

Definitely watchable, better than a cam for sure.  Most of the movie looks very good.  "
