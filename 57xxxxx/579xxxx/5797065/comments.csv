,Truther111,2011-08-01T07:43Z,"this Beginnings 6-part presentation by Eric Hovind is a great introduction to the truth of creation, presented with clarity.  Its ~40 minute length segments are more palatable than Dr. Kent Hovind's 7-part Creation Seminar 3-hour ones, which I also recommend for much more information.

altho i downloaded this from JustPirateBay2011's torrent,  thank you, awaken888, and God's blessings for this upload and many more."
