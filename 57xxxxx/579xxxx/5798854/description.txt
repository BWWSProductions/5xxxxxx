2007 King of Cards    CD  V2 VVR104862P 

2007 release, the fourth from this Mercury Prize-nominated British singer/songwriter whose sensitive style has drawn comparisons to Nick Drake, David Gray and Colplay (amongst others). With King Of Cards, McRae continues down the same emotional path, but with a rich, undeniable warmth in the production that may help introduce him to a wider audience. 11 tracks including 'Set The Story Straight' and 'Bright Lights'
