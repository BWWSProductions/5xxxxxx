,azisco,2011-04-03T21:49Z,"You probably didn't copy the crack. Once you've mounted the ISO, open it by going to my computer, right clicking on the disc, and clicking ""Open"" or ""Explore"". Once you're there, you should see a folder that says Skidrow. Open it, and take those files and put them where you installed the game. If you put it in the right place, a popup should come up asking if you want to overwrite some files, which you do.

I'm going to download this, hopefully it supports LAN because that's what I need it for."
,battle21,2011-04-04T03:13Z,@Askalin the SKIDROW folder is in the iso file you just mounted.

,ouzomezes,2011-09-13T14:51Z,"I googled for sins of a solar empire 1.32 and came up with several links to this file ""Sins.of.a.Solar.Empire.Trinity.v1.32-RADiANCE.rar"" (TPB doesn't let me post the link directly), and it seems to work. It seems the 1.32 update is on file hosting sites since 25-8 but no torrent sites.

It's the full game (I couldn't find a standalone crack) and I scanned it with prevx and security essentials before installing. I can't believe this is in the open since 25-8-2011 and noone bothered to upload a torrent yet, (I'm on a shitty 50kbps upload btw).

Please scan for viruses before installing, I could be terribly wrong and this could be full of bad,bad stuff but atm it seems fine. Oh and if it's legit, upload and seeeeeeeeeeeeeed..."
,ouzomezes,2011-09-19T12:10Z,"C'mon guys, where is everybody?!

I've been playing the 1.32 version every day for the last 5 days and everything works.
Take a look, the 2nd screen shows the deconstruction ability which is available only in diplomacy 1.3 and newer.

i used to be able to play the original sins of a solar empire, but that was a while back, i know how to install these and had no problems, and almost everything always works, just not this one and I need it, can someone offer any advice, thinking maybe i might need another directx file or something, i have ran into that before but i havent found anything talking about that being a fix online?  please help out if you can"
,1PirateDude,2011-12-26T05:43Z,"Installing Sins of a Solar Empire: 
- Mount or Burn ISO with Demon Tools or PowerISO, Install the game by d-clicking the dvd or running setup if not automatically pop ups.
- Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD then paste it to your installation directory and overwrite   
- Play it.
- if done correctly then it means u did it right.

Game rating 9/10

thanks marianos! good torrent!"
,nate1991,2012-01-06T23:34Z,"So confused. I cracked correctly, I can play the original part of the game no problems. Everytime I try to open Entrenchment it gives the SDactivate.exe error. When it does run it asks for my registration info. I have no idea whats wrong. My friend DL'ed the same torrent and his works perfectly all 3 games. I did the EXACT same thing as him, mounted, installed, cracked, it still doesnt work. "

just google for virtualclonedrive (it's much better than daemon tools) and once you have found it you install it.
when you have installed virtualclonedrive you just double-click your downloaded iso file (the biggest file you've downloaded) and virtualclonedrive will automaticly open the file ;)"
