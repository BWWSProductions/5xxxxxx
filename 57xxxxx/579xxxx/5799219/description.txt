NEW SEED. Please keep this seeding as I have limited bandwidth. I will put up Season 1 first and after I see 4 people with full seeds I will put up Season 2 etc until all 4 seasons are seeded. I am waiting to receive Season 5 and will seed it last.

I'm a big fan of this show and unfortunately there are some pretty crappy torrents available for these shows and all in an .avi format

I rented the DVD's of Las Vegas and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each episode. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using Handbrake with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

Known problems: NONE on Season 2. 
I tried to fast scan through each episode after I ripped it and watched samples of each episode for audio and video quality checks. 

There are no subtitles or alternate languages.
