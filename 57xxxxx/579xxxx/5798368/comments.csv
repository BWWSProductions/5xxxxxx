In the past, I have no problem whatsoever with your reencode.. video and audio was great... but this time, the sound was bad.. it sounds distorted with noticeable skipping in a few parts... it's also louder than normal I think... the video is good... just the sound I think...

I dont know what's wrong and I want to stress that I've had no problem with your uploads before... but thanks for all your hardwork.. I really appreciate you doing small rips.. If it were'nt for you, I had to download 500mb file for 3 days before I can watch my favourite series.. thanks!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-08-30T23:50Z,"Sorry to hear that. Problematic are few shows, where first 30 seconds (""In previous episodes"")louder  by 240% than the rest. Than - every segment between the commercials has different sound (AC3) matrix - 2 channels for fifteen minutes than 5.1 surround next fifteen and so on and on...
It is problem How Is Aired, and not How is Encoded by me. It took a while to even figure how to cope with that shit.
I was thinking to drop shows that causes problems. True Blood, Hung, Entourage for sure.

It would save hours of my time (for every such show I must demux the sound, load it into sound editor and mux back - then encode as any other show)  and - you'll have nothing to worry about."

,wira020,2010-09-05T04:07Z,"Oh, I thought you used other upload source and just reencode it to make it smaller.. sorry then.. I hope you'd still do episode 12 of true blood.. it's the last one for the season... once again, thanks for all your hardwork..."
