,RuneRifle,2010-10-19T15:10Z,"There should be these in the .rar:

Folder: Crack
File: RiskII.iso
File: RuneTorrents.nfo

,gedner,2010-10-19T21:30Z,"ok, worked after second download;)"
,badassdesi,2010-10-30T10:05Z,"Is this going to work on windows 7? i downloaded it tried to install but not sure whether im doing something wrong or this simply wont work on windows7. Did this file work for anyone using Windows 7? if yes, could you post instructions? Thanks. "
,RuneRifle,2010-10-30T14:35Z,"Well I run windows 7 ultimate x86 myself, and it should work.

Have you tried running it in compatibility mode?"
,badassdesi,2010-10-31T03:24Z,"adjusted that too to run in XP, SP2. issue is as follows: game interface is loading to the main menu, if i am making a selection, its not returning  the selection immediately. however, if i throttle out of risk II and come back i see my selection loaded. Never seen this kind of error. "
