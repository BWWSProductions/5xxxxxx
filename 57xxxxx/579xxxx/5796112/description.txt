REVIEW:
David Hazeltine evidently salutes pianist Bill Evans on this Venus CD, as eight of the nine songs were recorded by Evans for Riverside and the 

late pianistâ€™s influence is definitely a part of Hazeltineâ€™s style (though the Japanese liner notes make it difficult to confirm for sure). 

Accompanied by two sympathetic musicians, bassist George Mraz and drummer Billy Drummond, Hazeltineâ€™s interpretations of standards like 

â€œBeautiful Love,â€ â€œAlice in Wonderlandâ€ and â€œWhen You Wish Upon a Starâ€ are lyrical and to the point. The lively setting of â€œHow Deep Is the 

Oceanâ€ and loping treatment of â€œTenderlyâ€ also merit praise. Hazeltineâ€™s sole composition is â€œFor Bill,â€ a fluid piece that is also reminiscent of 

Bill Evansâ€™ approach to the piano and writing. Beautifully recorded, the only problem with this CD is Jan Saudekâ€™s tasteless cover photo. ~ by
