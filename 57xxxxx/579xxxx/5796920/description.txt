Laides and Gents,I present to you the Ultimate Doom Soundtrack synthesised by an old NEC computer with FM synthesiser(OPL-3 chip) and recorded by Audigy 2 ZS(line out(NEC) -> line in(Audigy 2 ZS)) using ASIO with sampling rate 96 khz and bit depth 24 bits.All recording done with Sound Forge 10.Due to the low levels of analog noise no noise removal has taken place.No EQ,no nothing.Just recorded,cut(some tracks were repeating) and compressed using highest level of FLAC compression.
If you'd like me to record the Doom 2 music or any other game music that uses MIDI files,request in the comments.
