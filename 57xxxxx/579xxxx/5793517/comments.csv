 dude ur specialty is hindi movies u will get more and more seeder if u try to reduce ur file size. and mkv has better encoder setting that's why it contain good quality that's why im requesting to u .
if u dnt like then dude i apologize to u "
[V],Team_xRG,2010-08-30T09:38Z,hehehehe :D frm now u will get .mkv For Sure For Upscale n BRRip ;) n AC3 aswell :)
,yesbos,2010-08-31T09:53Z,"xRG, i agree with Envader. There will be slight quality different between same mp4 and mkv file using same source and rip to same size. (one must be genius to identify it) 
So, keep on working in mp4, bcos it support in most devices. I don't have a problem whether u rip in mkv or mp4, but i think mp4 format is fare for all. Think that too!"
[V],Team_xRG,2010-08-31T15:40Z,"first guys there is no difference in quality cos of mkv or mp4 they are just contianers ii mean video quality
it depends on encoding 
mp4 does not support dts audio
mkv does another advantage of mkv in mp4 u can only rip till 4 gb it would not contain larger size.. mkv dies..
and mp4 needs aac audio cos it some times have problem with ac3 
so u see mkv is only a container which contains various streams like video audio :) "
[V],Team_xRG,2010-08-31T15:42Z,"and u said use mkv at small sizes
manu people use divx player for watching movie and if u know those rippers u mentioned use x264 like i did in this rip
it wont play on divx players :) 
so many people request me to upload 800-900mb xvid (avi) so that they can play and quality is also comparetively better than 500 mb x264(mkv or mp4) "
,scrpzking,2010-09-01T06:23Z,"Like many others I prefered that you ripped in mp4 format as most devices support it and it counts as a dominant format as of late as most households own a ps3, xbox or apple device. plus you get to hook it onto a big screen tv and enjoy it (like me) and mkv is only playable on the computer itself. Though your rips never fail in quality I hope you would consider ripping them in mp4 again because your still ripping them at the same size and I was opting for your rips because of the mp4 format.

If anyone does know any quality mp4 rippers let me know, I'd appericate it.

I think we should have a poll...mp4 or mkv

MP4 for me
