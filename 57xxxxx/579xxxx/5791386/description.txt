Cromok Full Discography
=======================

Cromok is a thrash metal band from Malaysia. They are known to be an otai band (where the term otai refers to old-timers or pioneers) of thrash metal music.

Their song structures are characterised by very simple riffs and minimalist drumming overlaid with complex guitar solos.

History
-------
Sam, Karl, Miji and Din were Malaysian students studying at the University of Wollongong, in Australia, where they decided to form a thrash metal band. While in Australia (as a three piece band), Cromok went on to achieve a steady following and a large fanbase[citation needed], and eventually returned to Malaysia. Din died becouse of Denggi Fever in 1996, but the band continued as a trio.

In 2005, Sam announced that they were going on hiatus and that all band activities are suspended. Lead guitarist Hillary Ang rejoined his old band, Search, thus adding to the speculation of a break-up (and the end of Cromok).

Style
-----
The group sings in English. They are also known to have at least one instrumental track in every album. Sam uses a teutonic thrash vocal style, while the band\\\\\\\'s music sounds similar to the Bay Area thrash metal.

Cromok also often experiments with Malay cultural music elements and sounds, adding Malay elements to their artwork.
