[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-28T15:30Z,"@ One_Burnt_Potato - No, it is not the same as The Boondock Saints, but this show is very funny, IMO.

@ kombatrat - I plan on going to the store and buying season 1 in the next couple of days. The reason why I am going to buy it is cuz I could not find DvDrips of season 1 anywhere and also cuz I love this show, But if anyone finds season 1 and or 2 (DvDrips) please leave the link here or send me an email with the link @     movi3sdir3ct@hotbox.ru "

,One_Burnt_Potato,2010-08-29T03:18Z,"Hey Daywalker

Is it possible for you to do this movie? I know it was banned in some countries, because It is supposed to be really gruesome etc and if you could do the remake whenever it comes out that would be great. Thanks

Heres the original

and heres the remake  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242432/ 
Thx i've been wanting to see this movie for a long time but can never get a hold of it."
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-29T04:04Z,"@ One_Burnt_Potato - I will gladly do both!
