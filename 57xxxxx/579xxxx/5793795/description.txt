The whole cast is funny as hell! So at least try 1 episode.

Huey Freeman: [while shooting at each other with BB guns] Why does it always have to end up like this?
Riley Freeman: Cause you's a bitch. 

Robert 'Granddad' Freeman: Mr. Wuncler, I'm... sorry about the whole, you know, my grandson shooting your grandson out of the window thing. Are you mad?
Ed Wuncler: In 30 years, that boy will be the President of the United States. And he'll still be a fucking idiot. Now, are we gonna have that drink or what?
