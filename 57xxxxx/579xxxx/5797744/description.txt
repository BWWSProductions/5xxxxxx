Deadliest Warrior is a television program in which information on historical or modern warriors and their weapons are used to determine which of them is the "deadliest" based upon tests performed during each episode. The show is characterized by its use of the data compiled in creating a dramatization of the warriors' battle to the death.

The show is hosted by three commentators: Geoff Desmoulin (biomedical scientist and high speed camera operator),[3] Dr. Armand Dorian (medical consultant), and Max Geiger (simulations programmer). All three provide commentary throughout the show, as well as technical details of each weapons test. The show is narrated by Drew Skye.[4]

Season two had 13 episodes and began airing on April 20, 2010, with the last episode airing on July 27, 2010.[5]

The show was originally developed by Morningstar Entertainment, and has since moved to production company 44 Blue.[6] The Show Runner (Senior Producer) in the first season was Tim Prokop.
