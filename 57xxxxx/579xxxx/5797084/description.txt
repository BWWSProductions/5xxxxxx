- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   A full-length debut is a pivotal moment for most bands, but for PhoenixÃ†s The
   Word Alive, itÃ†s a battle-tested triumph. Produced by Andrew Wade (A Day To
   Remember, VersaEmerge), the band's first album is a challenging,
   genre-bending opus that fully showcases the considerable abilities of one of
   heavy musicÃ†s true rising talents.

   Awesome cd! Buy it next week along with the other like 6 awesome cds that we
   might have pre'd ;D
