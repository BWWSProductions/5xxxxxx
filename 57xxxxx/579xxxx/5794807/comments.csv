,bluegeek9,2010-09-03T10:32Z,I've watched this .iso like 8 times in the last week.  Not sure what you are doing wrong.
,Robert012488,2010-09-28T18:34Z,"I just Downloaded this; I am still seeding it as 2 others are on still. I tried converting it to the Video-TS; using isobuster but it came up with 2 corrupted sectors so the sound is garbled and there is to Picture. I tried the convert again using Winrar, no bad sectors showed; but sound and picture is still garbled...I will hunt around to see how to fix it. One Bad Sector was in the Beginning; and this sets the ISO up for Sound and Picture. The other was in VOB8. There was a 1.73 GB Version listed on TPB; I will try that also. I will post back on what I come up with. The Bad Sectors on large ISOs sometimes come about when the Providers Reduce the Bandwidth so that even though your Torrent shows 100% - it is not 100%. I use Comcast in Russia and they are always screwing up my large ISO's' as they split up in the Torrent a little different each time on uploading. Better to make a Video TS the shrink it."
,Robert012488,2010-09-28T18:50Z,"Hi Again: the 1.73GB from TPB version had no seeders showing upon starting; however, I found another version 544 MB on BTJunkie - this has seeders. so I started this also. I also started the 6.44 ISO image through a sector rebuild software; probably will take all night to locate bad sectors and dump in some dummy data or rebuild; I don't know how the program works. Will post again."
,Robert012488,2010-09-28T20:28Z,"Hi Again: I just used Power ISO and Mounted the ISO Image and it plays ok - perfect sound and picture. I will see if I can shink with DVD Shrink the VIDEO TS File that shows on the Power ISO Mount..

The Iso Image may have been just assembled a little different, so that not all software works with the ISO. 

So, hopefully TRIN02 reads this and has kept the ISO."
,Robert012488,2010-09-29T14:07Z,Hi Again I tried burning the ISO using power ISO on a Dual Layer DVD; The DVD plays in my Player.. where the 2 bad sectors are; you can see some pixels for an instance - no big deal. So Power ISO must be doing some type of Repair on the Sectors as it burns or mounts the ISO; once burned - each vob file plays ok on VLC..
