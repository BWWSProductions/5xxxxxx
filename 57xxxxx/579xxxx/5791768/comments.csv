You're still watching on your computer?

There's only about a dozen relatively cheap network-ready players for your TV.

Look into the Western Digital WDTV Live, full 1080p, optical digital audio, etc etc, and even most CAM vids are extremely watchable on a good 42"" or larger LCD/Plasma.

I've found the only real issue is with audio, anymore."
,RnRTeeM,2010-09-03T03:17Z,"the toilet has better audio then this, and the video is like ripped off a camera through another camera.lmao"
,notherdaysgoneby,2010-09-03T05:21Z,"@PhilLesh12  and MaxMouseG. I have never watched movies on my computer. Nero which comes with and always has come with any DVD burner you buy and 99.9% of Pc's bought has a very simple idiot free program in it to not only make a DVD but to have full animated menus. Between here and worst previews you can find all you need to have a DVD filled with chapters, Menus and Special Features. Even a older PC can convert the files with in say 3 hours tops, and that is a older PC. A newer one can do it in less time it would take you to watch the thing. "
,kraze1201,2010-09-23T18:38Z,"hey. sorry man. i dont mean to use u for info, but if whoever is saying the stuff about converting these movies to dvd can holla at me, krazedamc@comcast.net. i am new to this and i tried to upload my movies but have no clue what i am doing. also, if there is an easier way to convert these types of files to dvd, please tell me. i am downloading the file to an sd card or dvd disc as a data disc, playing it back in my ps3 thru my dvd recorder and putting it on dvd that way. also in some cases i have to use this video box i have that allows me to bypass copy rights. i always look forward to learning better or easier 
ways to do these things."
