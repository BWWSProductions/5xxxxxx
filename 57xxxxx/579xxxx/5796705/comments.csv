SO MUCH........she's a huge talent, and those acoustic versions let her true talent shine through at 110%!!! This is probably the first time i've said this and meant it in the last 5-6 years, but i'll probably go and buy this in the store just to support her!! -- I'll seed for a while..."

For the acoustic part [2nd CD] the bit rate is 192-256.....most are above 224 though.
And the 1st CD, i think is a mix all the way up to 320kbs.......but i'm not 100% sure, because i only downloaded one song from CD1 on this torrent, because i had previously downloaded the original CD a month ago."
