Barring some unforeseen occurrence (forgive the obscure Seinfeld reference) I will have my torrents up and seeding again after the format.  But lets all work together and seed this so I can format sooner.  Thanks friends, and enjoy!"
,jackalope77,2010-08-30T22:25Z,"@Agentbay: Youre welcome, enjoy! If you take over seeding for a while after you DL, I can format then, lol."
[T],ctang,2010-09-04T22:52Z,jackalope77:  you need to initial seed...i know your not doing this because i can see you in the seed pool and your the only one...if you initial seed you will upload a lot more efficiently (basically more 1:1)
,jackalope77,2010-09-05T10:24Z,"ctang, please explain! I couldnt find a good tutorial so i am just learning as I go.  Right now I just upload the torrent and then let it seed until availabilty reaches 2.000 and then other seeders appear.  I don't know how to initial seed as you say."
[T],ctang,2010-09-05T22:45Z,sorry it took me so long to respond...what program are you using...if its utorrent then right click on your torrent and go to the torrents properties and check where it says initial seed...other programs call it other things but i cant remember off hand what they are called...once you tell me what program you are using i can further help you!!!
,jackalope77,2010-09-05T23:33Z,"Hey ctang, I am using bittorrent 6.4.  I think I figured out the initial seeding thing, like you say you bring up the torrent properties and there is a check box for initial seeding.  So i just changed all my torrents to that.  I assume I should do that at the beginning next time?  Should I leave them on initial seeding all the time or what?

Also, that guide that Agentbay posted above is the one i used when I started uploading, and it is unclear about some things.  Mainly about how to know what trackers to use and how to upload faster.  I just copied and pasted the trackers from a torrent I was downloading at the time, but if you know a better set I could use, please direct me.  Also, any other uploading tips would be welcome, like you say you checked the seed pool, to see if i was initial seeding, where is the pool and how do i check it?  Any tips are welcome!"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-09-06T04:37Z,a new dvd-r uploader?  hopefully you stick around and join this circle of friends here on TPB.  Im looking forward to see what you have to offer if you are the type that leaves the dvd alone and uploads it as is (which i highly prefer!)
,jackalope77,2010-09-06T05:15Z,"@zombifuzz: I will certainly stick around as long as people continue to download and seed my releases.  I am trying to upload stuff that I had a hard time finding and think other people would like.  I always upload uncompressed dvd's (even though I have low bandwidth) because I like to be able to choose what things to keep when downloading.  I am still learning the finer points of uploading, but I have a number of releases picked out.  Next will be either the Star Wars Clone Wars series (the 2D hand-drawn one), or the Elite Entertainment release of Night of the Living Dead (the orig 1968 version)."
,jackalope77,2010-09-06T05:20Z,"@Agentbay: Thanks very much for the tips! I think I get what the initial seeding thing is all about.  Since I have low bandwidth, this should help me get stuff uploaded faster so I can move on.  I still dont really understand how trackers work, or what DHT and peer exchange etc are, but I will keep learning as I go.  And hey, how do you know Im a flames fan!!!!"
,jackalope77,2010-09-06T19:52Z,"Agentbay, whats the difference between utorrent and Bittorrent, which I use right now?  I was usuing Azureus, but I found it very useless after they changed to Vuze and I found Bittorrent by accident.  Also, I didnt know Europeans followed NHL, since each hockey country has their own elite league.  That is cool to know.  I will pass your compliment to Iginla, next time I see him, haha."
[T],ctang,2010-09-06T22:14Z,actually vuze has a way to go back to the old format of azureus...i really like vuze (well azureus) but it isnt very friendly for the people that create torrents...utorrent is by far the best client for downloaders and uploaders...and now its for mac os x as well!!! which is what i use
,jackalope77,2010-09-08T09:10Z,"Agentbay and ctang  thanks for the continued advice, its nice to have people to help you out with this torrent thing.  I will look into the uTorrent to see if it is for me.

Agentbay I will try and get the NHL to change the schedule, but I dont know if they will go for it since then we Canadians would have to watch in the middle of the night.  And a Canucks fan, hey?  Who knows, maybe this is their year.  Speaking of hockey, I just got a burn dvd of the Olympic gold medal game so I am going to go watch Crosby, Iginla and Luongo beat some Americans!  Enjoy the Seinfeld dvd..."
