,allaboutpics,2012-03-16T16:45Z,"I have a problem...first, there is only the .atn file that downloads & 2nd, when I run the action, the only thing adjustable is the final whole layer, not individual ones. Is this normal? It's the first time I've downloaded anything from here. I had expected it to run like other actions I've got elsewhere where I can adjust each layer. Did I do something wrong? Or is that just how this download works? Thanks so much"
