extremezone fucking rules. He very politely pointed out that, regardless of source, the quality of the upload does not meet the quality necessary for ""DVDSCR"" regardless if it is a work print or not. Some CAMS can be regarded SCR if they are good enough, even though they are technically cams. This upload is neither screener (don't care about the original source), nor TS, IMHO... it is pure excrement, like yous guys winterchronic & TPBSPY.
