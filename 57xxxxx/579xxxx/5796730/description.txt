Joe and Baggy are two misfit English film school students whose first movie goes awry. 
Desperate to finance their flick, they turn to a porn producer who agrees to give them 
the money needed in exchanges for the guys to cast a semi-retired adult film star named 
Candy (Carmen Electra). Though Candy agrees to the deal, but Joe and Baggy's efforts 
to make their own movie morphs into a raunchy show which they use Joe's suburban parents 
house as their set.
