Featuring 13 tracks of the best BOLLYWOOD FUNK, recorded between 1977 and 1984. After the example of Hollywood many Indian action films of the 70s and 80s were scored with great funky tunes and frantic chase funk. Bollywood being Bollywood the funk was given a strong Indian twist. The result: super funky, stunningly original funk grooves that will set any dance floor on fire. Featuring among others the steaming sexy funk of BOMBAY 405 miles and ultra rare funk gems from the Hindi safari film HABARI and the violent hippie flick SALAAM MEMSAAB.
