,Screamokid,2010-10-12T00:30Z,"schranzx, Potato, huh? I believe the correct term would be american, but whatever, gotta respect that you're a potato, potatoes hate everyone, with this economy, you must be really running low on your guiness, so you're pissed even more. I hate to break this to you but I believe this movie is better than all irish movies put together, simple fact being, irish people suck at making movies :) america seems to be one of two countries who are really capable of making good movies (excluding low budget movies like this of course), the other being England, but good actors in England are in very short supply but when you do get good actors, they really can make good movies, one guy who is probably the best modern day brittish actor would be Robert Pattinson, I saw him in twilight and didn't really pay much attention, but after seeing him in lots more stuff, it's safe to say, this guy can act!

Another point, america doesn't make movies, movie companies in america makes movies, how dumb do you have to be not to know that? Although all that guiness and the fact you're a potato would mean you are plain retarded!

Potato

Btw, I'm from England :) you can send me hate mail about how England is far more superior that Ireland because we're far more capable :D

,Sn0okk,2010-10-16T21:53Z,IMDB rating : 2/10. OMFG this is the worst movie ever? and it got 300 seeders?
,APDJOKER,2010-10-21T08:01Z,"""TIT-ANTICS 2"" New name for this movie

This is a low budget travesty EPIC FAILURE of a movie.  Special effects are so 1980's blue screen. Now a days they use a green screen for better special effects.   "
,Fredis-X,2010-12-05T04:15Z,The film is not a sequel to the 1997 film by James Cameron.

,JensBlest,2011-03-30T12:54Z,"Burn in hell.....
Wtf? destroying one of the best classic films......
Who idiot can imagine to be so creative to say that the fucking ship is crashing at the same f******* icemountain again...... 

I cry for you.-......"
,banneddogg,2011-05-24T19:00Z,Making a film about a disaster/grave is touchy anyway let alone making one about one that hasn't even happened. It sort of cheapens (not sure that's the right word but you know what I mean) the integrity of the whole Titanic saga. I mean you wouldn't make a 'World Trade Centre 2' would you. It's beyond my comprehension??? 
,nicko7,2011-09-29T05:15Z,"NO AUDIO WTF, dont download until claims that its fixed"
,ozge143,2012-03-16T17:15Z,"OMGGGGGG !!!
