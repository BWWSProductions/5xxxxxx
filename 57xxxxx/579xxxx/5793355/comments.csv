,dielaughing,2010-09-22T21:38Z,you decide you didn't like the real name of the game (Metroid: Other M)? gonna change it to please yourself? Metroid: Another M by helpwii
,dielaughing,2010-09-22T21:55Z,but i guess it's safe to assume that this copy is real.. it only takes a ding dong mexican to get the name wrong.. a person trying to decieve you probably wouldn't get the name wrong.. lol
,dielaughing,2010-10-01T01:30Z,Another what?
