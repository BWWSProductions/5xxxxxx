,sinkon77,2010-09-24T12:49Z,You should tell clearly that after downloading user must BURN DVD. I do not have DVD drive and was VERY dissapointed when i finished downloading.
,Mercury8215,2010-11-04T00:08Z,"You don't have to burn it, you just need software that play's files like that...  I like PowerISO but there are others.  There's lot's of stuff everyone has to learn to use downloaded material.  
Google it!

Oh and for the sound you probably need a codec.  

www.cccp-project.net  This codec pack should fix you up.

And use VLC Video Player too.  It's the best."
