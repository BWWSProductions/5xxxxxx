This is amazing Trance Metal band, This album came out in Febuary and ive had it for about that long, ive been friends with them on Myspace since before they released Collisions, they are currently working on a new EP and releasing their sophmore Album in 2011, if you're a fan of Attack Attack I see Stars and other stuff like that, give them a listen, you wont be
