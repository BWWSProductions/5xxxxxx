,sdklfjasd,2010-08-29T03:05Z,152 mb has to be fake
,tango89,2010-08-29T16:20Z,"@sdklfjasd, as Killawife said, this is just the original score, i.e. the music used in the film. I will upload a proper DVDRip as soon as it is availible."
[T],twistsanny,2010-12-27T13:50Z,"I think it would be smart if you'd change ''Original score'' to ''OST'', that attracts more people!"
,HelloKira,2010-12-28T22:28Z,"""OST"" is ""Original Soundtrack"" not ""Original Score""
