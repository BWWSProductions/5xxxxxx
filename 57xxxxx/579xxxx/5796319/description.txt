This is a compilation of music I\\\'ve downloaded from a play list I got from a radio station.  The play list was compiled from listener votes.  In order to get all the songs on 1 DVD I re-encoded them to 128kbs and normalized the volume(won\\\'t blast your eardrums when you listen through headphones).  Hope you enjoy
