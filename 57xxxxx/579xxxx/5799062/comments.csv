,ttlens,2010-12-07T15:55Z,Followed the instructions and correctly replaced the .exe file but it didn't remove the trial limit of only 10 addresses.
,sukulu,2011-01-18T12:19Z,wat about the trial - not removed. doesnt help nway.
,tornadosturnmeon,2011-03-31T00:53Z,Works great.  Once again Thingy you have proven yourself an invaluable contributor to the Bay.  Well done. 
,tornadosturnmeon,2011-03-31T01:00Z,"I spoke too soon.  IT seemed to be working great, until I tried to view the extracted email addresses, which was limited to the first 10 (complete with an offer to purchase the full version).  Any thoughts on how to resolve this?  "
,freesites,2011-04-14T11:10Z,Also only got trial version. WTFK dude.
,tornadosturnmeon,2011-05-09T14:06Z,"Thingy, is it possible there's been an update?  Any reason why this shouldn't be working?  Just curious. Your uploads usually dominate.  Thanks. "
,mark2sell,2011-08-17T17:10Z,"Hi Thethingy
On a different subject, Can you obtain and upload a torrent for http://www.tasktocal.com/ ?. This is a good program to integrate Task in Outlook to the Calender ! Just a request/question. Thanks for all your fine work on TPB !!!!!! Mark"
