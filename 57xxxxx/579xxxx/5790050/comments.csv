,ronyoshi,2010-08-26T19:27Z,"the text in all of these ""english spoken"" versions are written in russian or some wingding bullshit. that's what he means. or at least I think so. is the in movie text english?"
,ronyoshi,2010-08-26T19:33Z,my comment disappeared. @.@
,shredmastah1,2010-08-27T04:50Z,For anyone wondering. This is the SAME damn English audio with Russian text. So every time text comes on to tell you the time/location of the scene its all gibberish. Don't waste your time
,MrSketchtastic,2010-08-27T16:53Z,@Chrillzor   shut yo hoe ass up 
,vladNerzse,2010-08-31T11:30Z,Who cares shred i watch movies not read movies....mrs will love me for eva for getin this thanks tvteam great work again
,KidChameleon,2010-09-01T07:14Z,"Not only is the audio extremely muddy, but it also sounds like someone has an am/fm walkman radio sitting next to the cam mic and they are changing the stations every 10 minutes. Not sure why, but you can hear fuzzy static music that at times gets louder than the film. The Video isn't the worst ive ever seen and ya it is russian caption but whatev its free right?"
,ccrocker58,2010-09-12T08:02Z,"@vladNerzse: Normally I'd agree w/ you, however in this particular case 3/4 of the humor of the movie comes from the captions and text quips; not being able to read them does make a difference. I would suggest waiting for an all english."
