The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, 
And one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts 
In the history of popular music.
From 1962 the group consisted of 
John Lennon (rhythm guitar, vocals), 
Paul McCartney (bass guitar, vocals), 
George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals) and 
Ringo Starr (drums, vocals). 
Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the group later worked in many genres 
Ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, 
Often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. 
The nature of their enormous popularity, 
Which first emerged as the "Beatlemania" fad, transformed as their songwriting grew 
In sophistication. 
The group came to be perceived as the embodiment of progressive ideals, 
Seeing their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s.
