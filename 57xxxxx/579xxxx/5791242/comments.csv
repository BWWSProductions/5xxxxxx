,jojean,2010-08-27T07:17Z,"Yea, it's dual-layered, so you need a dvd9 and a compatible burner... but just get a usb drive and load your games from there..."

,EinMonster,2010-08-27T14:30Z,"@t_P50

buying a hard drive for you wii will pay for itself, think about all those games you have burned a copy of only to find out they didn't work. Games also load faster from a hd and a hd will store the data longer than a dvd would. Everytime I use a DVD I think that cost me $1 [I know they are less than that but not much] and everytime I use my hd I think what about the 80+ games on it and how many DVD's I have saved."

,JestersKnight69,2010-09-02T03:02Z,"Hello everyone I have not been doing this as long as most of you and I have learned a great deal through everyone's comments on the Bay and alot of googleing. This is my first message and I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for the time consuming work that they put in to make this possible, especially those dedicated seeders out there. I just had a quick question and if anyone could let me know if i'm just being retarded or if this is possible. I wanted to get this new metroid, been a fan of the series for a long time, I have noticed that it needs a DVD-DL to play it without usb loader, but I don not have the money to buy any right now and am desperate to get this game. Is it at all possible to somehow burn it on to two DVD-R's? Any help is appreciated. In case anyone needs to know I am running a softmodded 4.2U with Cios 249 rev20, using darkcorp to play games burned on DVD-R's. I know I could get an external HDD and use usb loader but I cannot afford one and personally prefer to have the disks. If anyone can help me out I would appreciate it very much, if not that's cool too. Thanks for everything to everyone in the Bay."

,paralax,2010-09-03T10:40Z,"If your movie freezes, then you are probably using version 14 of the cIOS in slot 249. Version 14 doesn't work with dual layer discs and freezes when it tries to read the second layer (partway through the baby cry movie).

Update your cIOS to version 20 in slot 249 and it should work."

I got way past that freeze point people are referring to after the tutorial..In fat im at the point in the game where i beat the mother queen and her other metroids. After beating that section in the game i had to chase down a doctor and then it goes to a cut scene with the doctor rambling for literally about 10 mins. as soon as she(Madeline) see's MB, it freezes.. always at the same point..She says the ""im sorry"" and it hangs right there..I have tried multiple different setting and nothing works..can someone give a detailed solution..."

,UncleMoe9999,2010-09-05T00:24Z,"Awesome game, nice reboot of metroid saga.

Cutscenes are not the best I've seen but very tolerable and I like getting some of Samus' back story.

I had freezing too- fixed it by updating my IOS 222 and IOS 223 and booting the game from a dual-layer DVD using Hermes uLoader.

I have a wiikey 1, with softmod, homebrew channel installed.

Use uLoader with IOS 222 enabled in the option, click load and it goes!

There are guides at GBATemp, look at the ""Problem Game"" thread.

Just click and drag the iso to the Wii UR 1. icon  . I then burned it to a Verbatim DVD+R DL DVD using IMGBURN software with a layer break of 2084960.To use a layer break,Just go to the tools then settings in IMGBURN then  click the write tab then in the options for layer break select user specified and enter 2084960. After this select Ok and Start the burning process at the lowest supported speed for your burner. The slowest supported speed is shown in Imgburn. This ran fine for me with a wii key 2. No error or problem so far. Hope this helps those that want to run the game without the disk system update which will probably block or delete neogamma from working."
,GenEmperor,2010-09-19T10:15Z,For those that don't know for the dual layer games such as this one you need verbatim DVD+R DL DVDS. Do NOT use DVD-R DL DVD or it won't work. I suggest you buy them at ebay if you just want to get a few of these. For the regular games that the iso is 4.37GB games use the verbatim DVD-R dvds. You can get 100 of these at newegg . com for about 20 dollars.

,GenEmperor,2010-09-30T02:39Z, Imgburn will tell you what your supported burn speeds are in the lower right corner after you have right clicked on the iso image select burn with imgburn after that as I stated it will tell you in the lower right corner area what the supported speeds are.

,danpar94,2011-01-05T17:44Z,I don´t understand! I have a wii 4.2E and I load my games with uloader. i hae like 30 games on my hard drive but this is the only one that did not work for me! I came to the title screen but after that the game freeze :(
,vinnylima,2011-03-16T19:00Z,"Working perfectly on my 4.1U console w/ Wiikey 2 (running through Disc Channel).
The size of the image file for this game must be exactly 8,506,048,512 bytes.

Remember, for all dual layer games on the Wii:
- Use DVD+R DL (instead of DVD-R, the type that should be used for single layer games)
- Use the free software ImgBurn
- Go to Tools > Settings > 'Write' tab. On the right side, in Layer Break, select User Specified and set it to 2084960
- You may want to change book type. After selecting the Write mode, click on the book icon inside the settings box, next to where you select the write speed. On your drive tab, in 'Change For' select Drive (For DVD+R DL Media), then in 'New Setting' select DVD-ROM. Press Change. Then press OK
- Burn at 2,4x (for single layer games, the speed should ALWAYS be 4x)"

Have you tried using an alternate .dol? For Metroid Prime Trilogy you have to load the Main Menu to create a save game, then exit out and load each game individually to play. Other M might require this method. Go to your settings and search in there for something mentioning ""Alternate dol"". CompleteSoftmodGuide mentions it has support for this method, so you should be okay.
BTW, I technically shouldn't have to post this, you should be able to search using Google/Bing/DuckDuckGo!/whatever for help."

,bvorak,2011-11-09T20:31Z,Using USB loader GX and was also getting stuck right after the baby's cry. Installed IOS222 slot 224 base 37 and it's working fine right now.
