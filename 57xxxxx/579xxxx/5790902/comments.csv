But on Q2 map, I got a picture over the whole screen on the phone, showing signs when I should get on another road, but on this map, I onle get a little sign on the top of the screen.. Anybody know how the get it like the Q2 map??
Q2 was scandinavia, og Q3 is europe, but only copyed the parts of the map I need."
,laxfett,2010-09-11T09:34Z,"How do I actually copy the maps to my device?
Do I need to go through the ""navigon fresh program"" or just drag and drop files to the sd-micro card? (Im using a navigon 6310, europe 40 device) Thanks a bunch! /laxfett"

,zaftlazzo,2010-09-19T17:20Z,"Jag antar att man måste packa upp rar-filen, men sen då? Har en navigon 71170 meb NM6,5. Var lägger man kartorna, hittar ingenstans där det ligger kartor på SD kortet som sitter i min mavigon."
,Yetikiller,2010-09-30T13:32Z,"@ laxfett  and zaftlazzo

Unrar the files first. After that place the files in Maps on your device or sd card by using Windows explorer.

Computer -> NAVIGON -> map

Overwrite the map file whit the new one. Or put in the countries you want to use. 

You cannot use the Navigon Fresh program. Only for Navigon 7 software working I suppose, but I am not sure about that."
,xsatquest,2010-11-17T16:52Z,"Not working with android 2.61 ..

That is....Yes it works for navigating inside a country but if you want to navigate over a country border it will fail with error 472"
