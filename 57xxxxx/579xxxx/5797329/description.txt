TUBESTAR IS A GREAT BAND FROM NY.
Best Rapatronic / Happy-Hop / Techno-Pop/ awesome/ will fuck your mom band out there.


Info:
What began in early 2006 as an electronic-based solo side-project, TUbEStAR has grown to include both its original sole member, Tanis K Cassidy (vocals and programming), as well as Nick Stephens (vocals; joined the band in early 2009). Hailing from small towns in Western New York State, the duo performed an array of shows throughout the surrounding areas. There were smaller shows, with only a few people as the audience; and there were bigger shows, performing in front of a few hundred people. This gave the band a promise of a local following. However, in late Summer of 2010, members of TUbEStAR began the process of relocating to the west coast in an attempt at furthering aspirations they\\\'ve always had. Their goal? To inspire, to spread their love of music, and to make life happen! This is just the beginning.
