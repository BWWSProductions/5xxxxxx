The Beatles - Cartoons - (1965-1969) Avi Format

Some Sources Say 2 Seasons, Some Say 3. - But It Comes Out That There Are
39 Clips (Episodes) In All.

Basically Just Animated Music Videos,(2 Songs Each Clip) But There Are Plots Written Into Each Episode.

The Titles Of The Episodes Are Simply The Titles Of The 2 Songs In Each One

Example: Season 1, Episode 13 = 1x13_I'm A Loser-I Wanna Be Your Man_(12-18-65)

I Have Found 3 Different Web-Sites, With Various Info & Loads Of Pictures !!!
