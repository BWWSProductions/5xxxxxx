,norberg18,2010-08-30T17:18Z,"@Morck22 - Did you ripped the game with PS Jailbreak? Because otherwise, it won't work."
,mr.spok,2010-08-31T20:18Z,"hi, it is possible to directly copy it into PS3 without burning it? i mean just copy all files from iso into backupmanager folder in PS3? can anybody try it and tell us if it works with PSjailbreak USB or one of its clones (X3jailbreak, PS3key, PS3stinger, etc.)??? thanks"

[V],scene4all,2010-09-01T23:03Z,Is there any way to get the psjailbreak files instead of buying the usb for $150 ? and I'm not talking about the psGroove
,DoodleBop,2010-09-02T07:47Z,"Don't bother people, Sony is gonna patch this in the coming weeks/months and you'll lose your money.

Plus you'll get banned."

,makin,2010-09-12T00:12Z,"Do not download this torrent.
The eboot is encrypted and can't be read by backup manager yet.  Guess you will be able to run this in the future, but there is currently no way to run this on a PSjailbreaked PS3"
,bandito22,2010-09-14T12:40Z,"PS3 can be hacked using loads of external devices (iPhone, N900 etc). Check out PS3-HACKS.com for the latest news and instructions on how to JailBreak the PS3.

Once hacked, you copy these files to GAMEZ folder on a FAT32 external drive plugged into your PS3. No need to burn to a disk. Run through 'Backup Manager' and that's it.

Yes, Firmware 3.42 blocks this JailBreak and you will not currently be able to use PSN if you have hacked the PS3. None of the bothers me as I am on 3.41 and playing loads of new games!!!!"

,viper_pt,2010-09-26T22:56Z,Does not work need eboot.bin decrypted :(
,mw1987,2010-10-02T11:48Z,"Does NOT work.
Encrypted eboot.bin.

Learn to upload proper stuff, instead of shit.
Use Backup Manager, so it can take the eboot.bin from mem dump and upload this fix ffs."
