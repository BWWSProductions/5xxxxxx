Luckily my stopzilla detected and blocked it.

This site is being ruined by scum like this!"

Can remember watching this when it came out.

Almost 30 years ago. I must be getting old!!"

The quality of the image is by the standards of the 80's, it has not been remastered.

Movie: 6 (Unless you have hours upon hours to waste, this 8 hour epic could have been cut down to 2 hours, which would have been a more interesting representation of Wagner's life; most of the time there's nothing interesting happening. I suggest watching something else!)"
