Do As I Say (Not As I Do)â€”Profiles in Liberal Hypocrisy By Peter Schweizer

Members of the liberal left exude an air of moral certitude. They pride themselves on being selflessly committed to the highest ideals and seem particularly confident of the purity of their motives and the evil nature of their opponents. To correct economic and social injustice, liberals support a whole litany of policies and principles: progressive taxes, affirmative action, childrenâ€™s rights, consumer rights, and much, much more.

But do they actually live by these beliefs? Peter Schweizer decided to investigate in depth the private lives of some prominent liberals and what he found was a long list of glaring contradictions.

Scheizerâ€™s conclusion is simple: liberalism in the end forces its adherents to become hypocrites. They adopt one pose in public, but when it comes to what matters most in their own livesâ€”their property, their privacy, and their childrenâ€”they jettison their liberal principles and embrace conservative ones. Schweizer thus exposes the contradiction at the core of liberalism: if these ideas donâ€™t work for the very individuals who promote them, how can they work for the rest of us.

Peter Schweizer is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of several books, including Reaganâ€™s War and The Bushes. He lives in Florida with his wife and their two children.
