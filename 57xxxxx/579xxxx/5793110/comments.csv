anyone else having this problem?"
,LaffTaff3,2010-08-28T17:16Z,"2007 White Macbook with OSX 10.6.4, 2.1 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo here, serial number worked first time, but now it only asks me to put in a CD. This happens even when I have the Reason ISO mounted. Do I need to burn the ISO to a disc just so I can get past this dialog box? The only options it gives me are to put in CD or quit out. I can't put in a new serial number unless I reinstall."
,macuser306,2010-08-28T19:58Z,"Serial from keygen works on iMac 24"".

You dont need to mount or burn the ISO.

Just copy the two soundbanks into the Reason folder. Afterwards you dont have to insert a DVD.

Many thanks for this nice release!!!"

,nukelfish,2010-09-12T23:37Z,i dont have a mac but i think you have to use diskutility to open the iso file and copy the reason folder to the applications folder. copy also the factory sound and orkester sound banks. launch reason and enter the mac s/n

Then one more dialog pops up ""Please Insert the Reason 5 DVD.  Waiting for disc...""  There is one option button here -- ""Quit.""

,MuscleTux,2010-10-24T21:55Z,"MAC USERS!!!! 
YOU DO NOT NEED TOAST OR A KEYGEN FOR THIS TORRENT!!!

1: Have the ISO on your desktop
2: Go to Disk Utilities (under Applications Folder, then Utilities Folder)
3: Select the Reason 5 ISO in Disk Utilities and then select Create DMG 
4: When the Reason 5 DMG is created, take a blank 8.5 GIG DVD-R and burn the DMG to the DVD-R
5: After successful burn, eject DVD and when prompted by Reason 5 to insert DVD do so with the DVD you just burnt and it will install on it's own.

No need to register or give a retail code (I didn't have to anyways)

Don't bother with Toast or all that other garbage, this works everytime with any ISO.

Enjoy and Biggup tha BEATS!!!"

,IwasApostcard28,2010-12-08T21:58Z,"I'm kind of new to downloading program torrents and I have a question for some of you. Is it OK to register the program or should I not do that? I got Reason 5 up and running after putting in the serial number that is posted but when it asked if I wanted to register I clicked no. 

At first, when I put in the serial number it said that it failed, but when I opened up the program it worked.

Is it smart to register in the future? Any input would be appreciated. Thanks

,self_titled,2010-12-14T21:35Z,"Hey guys,

I'm struggling to get this installed as well.  I have the same ""Waiting for Disc"" problem.  I can open the software, agree to T&C (lol) before entering my admin password.  Then the ""Waiting for Disc"" window appears with the only option to Quit.  Have mounted the ISO on to the desktop.

Obviously I've read through these comments, but when I follow the instructions, I can't find the ""Sound Banks"" folder in the ISO that I have to move the files from.  (Step 2 in oldlokid's instructions).  I've opened up and searched all through the package contents, but still can't find a Sound Banks folder.

Could someone be more specific with reference to this step?  Where do I find the folder, and/or what files must I specifically move?  Really frustrated I'm failing at the final hurdle!  Many thanks in advance!"

1.  go into Disk Utlitiy and from there burn a DVD-RW (in case you fuck up!) 

2. burn the iso on it. 

THE TRICKY PART!

,Berdofblue,2010-12-23T11:55Z,"Okay, to all the geniuses out there, *cough* ofkin *cough*

1. This specific download will not work on a mac, it is an Iso and inside the iso are .exe files, which are not compatible on a mac. An iso is basically a .rar file for DVDs and stuff, so changing it to dmg won't do shit.

How to install, which should really be in the OP's description.

1. Download this, and daemon tools lite.
2. With daemon tools create a new virtual drive, then mount the iso you get from this after extracting from the rars.
3. A dialog box will pop if, click ""run autorun.exe""
4. Install that shit.
5. Click on the Icon that's created on your desktop.
5. Go back to the folder and unrar the reason5kgn.rar file. Run the keygen, in the dropdown box, click propeller v5, then generate.
6. Copy the key, paste it into the box that opens. Continue with your life."

,jimclip,2011-02-17T18:42Z,I'm almost certain an Intel-based Mac is required...
,jimclip,2011-02-17T18:44Z,"I'm on a Mac OS X 10.6, here's how to properly extract, mount, and install this torrent and prevent the ""Please Insert DVD"" message.
1. DO NOT USE Stuffit Expander. Instead download and install ""UnrarX"" (http://www.unrarx.com/]. Under Unrarx's ""File"" pulldown menu choose ""Extract"", then browse to the Reason torrent folder and choose the large RAR file. It takes a few minutes, but once done it should create an ISO file called ""Reason 5.iso"" in the torrent folder (not on your desktop!!!). Double click the ISO file and it should mount a disk image on your desktop called Reason 5. If not, use the Disk Utility app that comes with every Mac to manually mount it (launch it and use ""File > Open Disk Image"" to mount manually).

Once the Reason 5 image is mounted on your desktop, move on to step 2, which is how to install the program without getting the ""Insert DVD"" message.

1. Inside the Reason disk image now on your desktop, copy the Reason folder to your Applications folder as the icons and arrows suggest. Once it's finished, look back inside the Reason desktop disk image folder, and find the folder that says ""Sound Banks"". Open it and copy the two files inside it to the Reason folder that's was just copied to your apps folder (they should be copied loose into the Reason folder so that they're now alongside the Reason application).
2. Launch Reason, put in one of the Serial numbers, and it worked for me. Copying those two sound bank files to the main Reason folder in my apps folder is what stopped the Insert DVD message I was getting initially.

To clarify, you DO NOT have to have Toast to do any of this, nor is it necessary to burn the ISO to a DVD (would have to be a dual-layer DVD anyway since the file is well over 4.4gb).

Don't or delete ANYTHING inside the torrent folder until you've helped seed !!! But once you're done, you don't need any of those reason.r0 thru reason.r75 files anymore. To back up the program to an external drive, all you need is the ISO you created from all those numbered files.
Thanks to Jugz for this program, awesome !!"

,Lucafa,2011-10-23T00:26Z,"Instead of trying to crack the ignition key protection (which is nearly impossible), crackers should focus on cracking the demo instead! 
As stated on the Propellerhead website; the demo is EXACTLY the same as the full version, except, you can't open your saved Reason projects. (Untill you buy the full version) 
So, all we need, is a way to open our saved projects using the demo.
If only I had some cracking skills.."
,Lucafa,2011-10-23T00:47Z,"Just to be clear, I was talking about the new  Reason 6 in my comment, in response to rjpalmer81.
So again, all we need is a skilled cracker who can modify the software code a bit, so Reason 6 in demo mode allows opening projects."
,sigimaster14,2011-10-24T00:03Z,yeah c'mon crackers! we all think you are awesome just prove it this one time more!

,Smokeybandit78,2011-12-19T02:50Z,"I am also getting the issue of ""load disc"" 

How do I get around this? 

I'm rather new to this so please explain in detail.

,blaqmalal,2011-12-22T23:43Z,"""Load Reason 5"" disc problem

I figured out a way around the ""Load Reason 5"" disc issue.

Take the Refill files (Factory Sound Bank.rfl & orkester.rfl) from inside the .iso and drag them or copy them and paste them into the ""reason"" folder in the applications folder.  The reason folder is installed in the applications folder by default.

After this, close reason and then re-open it and it by-passes the load disc request."

Your a legend!!!! i was stuck on the insert disk bit untill i read your comment and it worked :) cheers dude"
,williamstonnckid,2012-01-27T02:43Z,"I beat my head against the wall for a week trying to get dmg files to appear from this.  I don't know if my way is the only way to accomplish this monumental task, but I did it without Toast.  I have Unarchiver, and standard stuff that comes with a MAC.  I incorrectly was choosing the air-reason5.rar file as the file to expand.  It did create an ISO, but that one only contained windows .exe files.  I saw a help page from another download site, where the writer said he selected air-reason5.r00 through air-reason5.r74 and he did NOT include the air-reason5.rar in his selection.  Then he held down control and right clicked to tell the MAC to unrar all of the files.  When I did this, the window that came up showed it expanding the first file with a status bar and it took a long time to finish.  But it didn't do the other 73 files.  After it expanded the very first one, it closed that window and the ISO appeared on my desktop with the MAC files. Now I could follow the instructions left on this page about dragging the Reason icon into Applications, and then I had to copy the sound files into the reason folder itself.  It took many attempts and rebooting my MAC, and I don't remember how it eventually worked, I just kept trying until it did."
,paaablo,2012-02-09T02:23Z,"Works perfect for me!
I've first installed little snitch to avoid any program ""call home"".
Then i installed toast titanium and secondly denied all connections for toast titanium with little snitch. Then i mounted the .iso with toast titanium.
I then installed reason normally introduced a serial number i saw over here and done, not any problem!
MillionThanks!
Peace!"
,paaablo,2012-02-09T02:24Z,PD: I use unarchiver to unrar files
,mariherzer,2012-02-18T17:58Z,THANK YOU SO MUCH! Works like a charm on my Mac!
,kedarchie,2012-03-01T08:24Z,"does this work with pro tools in rewire, because its not working for me"
,jeboles,2012-03-04T15:49Z,"timboboy09, Use a Virtual Machine or Real Computer with Windows.  Using CrossOver, Wine, Etc doesn't generate correct license numbers.  I have confirmed that myself."
,uniquefrk,2012-03-06T04:50Z,"Everything was workin fine until tonight when I try to run the program, before it even loads anything, it shows this fucking dialog that asks me to ""log on as administrator"" by entering username and password. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT? anyone else experienced this fucking crap? 
I tried uninstalling and installing again. didn't work. by the way, this was Reason 4. I tried to install this one, Reason 5 and before it runs the installer it shows the same fucking stupid thing and asks me to enter a username and password. WTF man. this shit sucks... "

,prada1976,2012-05-30T01:09Z,"I just tried this on a mac based system and it worked. Nothing fancy, just follow the instructions and this should work.

1- I unwrapped both the air-reason5.rar and the air-reason5kgn.rar with the program unrarx.
2- This created a Reason 5.iso and a Reason_5_keygen file (ignore this file)
3- Double click the Reason5.iso file and it will produce a Reason Styled folder on your screen with a Reason application folder that you need to then drag to your applications folder on your hard drive.
4- Then, from the Reason Styled folder double click the Sound Banks folder and copy both the Factory Sound Bank and the Orkester files to the Reason folder (that has just been created) on your hard drive.
5- Open Reason and use RSN500-0000-736275-BBZ4-JWTQ-388K as the activation.

6- Voila, it works!"

,jimmyd233,2012-06-19T23:47Z,i have everything downloaded and i opened the rar files correctly however every time i try to open the new iso i receive an error message that says the disk image could not be opened because it is not recognized can anyone help me with this?

,vroj,2012-06-20T23:43Z,"For everyone who's having trouble on a mac getting the ""No disk blahblahblah"" error, try (I'm not saying it's gonna work for everyone, but it worked for me) to move your .rfl files from the Sound Banks folder to the main Reason folder (just move them loose in there). I hope you find it helpful ;)"
