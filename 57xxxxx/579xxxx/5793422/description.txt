The second and masterpiece album by The Zombies released in 1968 + a bulk of great singles. Great psychedelic chamber pop, comparable in style to mid-late sixties Beatles or Beach Boys.
In 2003, Rolling Stone placed the album in 80th place on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In addition it has appeared on a number of greatest albums lists.

Album torrent already exists but lacks all of the splendid singles bonus tracks given here.
