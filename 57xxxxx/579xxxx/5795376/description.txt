Release Notes:
Right 1stly Thanks to FatsWaler, h3r3t1k, and Qlimax for the files , it's a DVDSCR, full credits mint quality...
it was dark but colours were nice, just added some brightness ....Audio is studio audio @ AC3 Enjoy
Quality is too good for a cam, too much detail on the source. Check sample //prism
