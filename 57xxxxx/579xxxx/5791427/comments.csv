Typing that all the time really makes you look like a pretentious idiot, man... the universe doesn't end with you. You don't get the last word, no matter how much you wish you controlled the debate.

All it does is show how fearful of the debate you are. You get your word in, then make your exit, deluding yourself into believing the buck stops with you. It's sad, bro."
