,RockingMagpie,2010-10-14T13:41Z,this is great news - I've been trying to buy/download this album for years. Thomas had/has a great voice and his work was the forerunner for the likes of Jamie Cullum etc
,Lady80s,2010-12-29T15:38Z,"Very hard to find material. I didn't know this guy had soloist works, all I only knew from him was ""The Happy Man"". The whole cd is very nice. Thanks a lot!
Happy New Year!
