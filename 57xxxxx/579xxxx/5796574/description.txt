This is one campus where the students all major in carnal pleasures. But there's one fraternity that's gotten out of hand. It seems that Uppa U Omega has set a most ambitious goal, and that is to enjoy the intimate delights of every eligable coed on campus. And that's just too much for the sororitie's to take so they approach the dean with a unique plan to have Uppa U Omega thrown off campus, and thereby efectively prevented from pursuing their dastardly intentions!
