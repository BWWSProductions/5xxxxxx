,Lardplanet,2010-08-27T06:56Z,Hey did you get this of the itunes store and convert them to mp3? or is it a cd rip?
,Lardplanet,2010-08-27T07:04Z,Yo every one mine will be a high quality rip if you can wait do it!
,iAmAffinity,2010-08-27T07:09Z,thanks for stealing my torrent from demonoid (i was trying to upload it here)
,nitrus0x,2010-08-27T07:31Z,"actually I got it from another ptv tracker, not demonoid

according to the guy there it is from a cd rip, and considering that a FLAC just showed up for it there with the same tracklist (-1 bonus track that I assume is either an itunes one or a different edition) I'm inclined to believe it"
