Almost an hour of hilarious stories told with characters in her inimitable, idiosyncratic style. The DVD features 90 minutes of fantastic video shorts, which originally appeared as "The Maria Bamford Show" web series on Super Deluxe. Maria is well-known from her two "Comedy Central Presents" specials, two critically acclaimed and strong-selling albums, her role in "The Comedians Of Comedy", and in Fox's series "Sit Down, Shut Up", from the talk show circuit, and from extensive touring.
