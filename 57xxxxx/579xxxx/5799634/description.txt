Aired A while ago 

Original releases were ivtc'd to the wrong framerate [24
instead of the correct 25] resulting in missing frames and 
thus jerky playback. They also suffer from general bad ivtc 
and have blended frames from start to finish. Apologies for 
late as we had to wait for reairs.

"Anarchy"

The succession of Englands crown is in doubt and causes King 
Henrys daughter and nephew to compete for the throne. Church 
politics see Philip elected the new prior, which leaves him 
indebted to Deacon Waleran.

Enjoy :)
