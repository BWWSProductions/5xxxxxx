,Atarikid,2010-10-07T01:03Z,Good tutorial. The guy looks like a total pedofile or rapist tho.  Thanks for the upload whoever you are.
,Ajzer,2011-08-28T17:52Z,"The guy DOES loke like a rapist... However, he knows his stuff, and regardless of his nighttime ""hobbies"" he did make the tutorial interesting. The quality of the video is 80's, VHS, or that tv-series Cheers. It's not dvd, barely even good but would be enough to tutor an amateur at the fiddle. From a begginners point of view, he does make it fun to watch, his sence of humor doesn't always strike through but he gives it a good try. He explains thoroughly and sticks to the basic need-to-know, not making it too complicated to an amateur. 3.5/5p I would say, cutting some of from the bad quality."
