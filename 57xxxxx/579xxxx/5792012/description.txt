Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) cannot wait to return to Camp Rock so that she and rock stars Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), Nate (Nick Jonas) and Jason (Kevin Jonas) can spend the summer making music and having fun with their friends. When they arrive, however, she discovers that Camp Star, a slick new camp across the lake, has lured many campers and instructors away, threatening the very existence of Camp Rock. Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin), the diva of Camp Rock, returns, but soon ditches the camp for Camp Star. Meanwhile, Nate and a girl from Camp Star, Dana Turner (Chloe Bridges), fall in love, and struggle to be together as their own camps fight. To make matters even more difficult, Camp Rock challenges Camp Star to a musical showdown to decide which is the better camp and has the right to remain open. Shane and Mitchie kiss.
