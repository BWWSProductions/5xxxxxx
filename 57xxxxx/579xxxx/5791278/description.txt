A DNA experiment on a rare breed of spider is taking place on a NASA space shuttle, 
when a freak meteor shower engulfs the shuttle, causing everything to go horribly wrong. 
One survivor is found on the ship and watched over in a secret location deep in the 
California desert. The problem continues, as the survivor isn't alone, as another 
deadly spiders climbs out of him and goes on a rampage around the ship. Curious 
reporter Marci Eyre must now survive, escape and warn everyone before the spider 
reaches outside the desert.
