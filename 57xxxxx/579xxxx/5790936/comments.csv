,karith,2010-09-06T12:42Z,"Hey, has anyone solution for problem with Mustang 510 and Airac since cycle 1007? After installing and during loading the plain to main view the plain starts to update the airac to it's database and creates ""access denied violation"" error at the end of the process and it is not about folder or file rights?

Thanks if some mustang user has solved this.
Win 7 64bit"

Real Environment Xtreme Service Pack 3 for FS2004
thanx!"
,JohnsonPBX,2010-09-23T00:30Z,"@ grfam: http://realenvironmentxtreme.com/forum/index.php?board=26.0

I think you only need to register to download the SP3, no need of cracks or anything, so uploading it here would be just pointless."
