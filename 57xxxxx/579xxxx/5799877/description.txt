Sonny enlists the help of Amber Allgood, the president of his fan club and a master of disguise to fix things. Amber uses her disguises to spy on the other So Random!  cast members to hear what they think of Chad. When she finds out that they like Chad now that he is dating Sonny, Amber insists that Chad dump Sonny, so that people will find him interesting again and to reach his 1,000,000 fans mark.
