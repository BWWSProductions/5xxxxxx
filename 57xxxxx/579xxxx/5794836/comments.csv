may be a result of reducing the file size to 710 mb."

but sound is too low 
no offence or anything but u need to make it compatable with vuze"
,jm413d,2011-03-16T03:41Z,Vuze? Are you fucking serious right now? Vuze makes WMP look amazing. You seriously need to upgrade to WMP 11 AT LEAST. VLC is 10x better than that. As for the file quality. IT SUCKS I expect better from you extremezone. You should never compromise quality to reduce filesize.
