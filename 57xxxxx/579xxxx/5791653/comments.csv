,SurferRN,2010-12-15T02:58Z,"I appreciate Dawkins passion about religion.  The film focuses on men's  doctrines, i.e. Catholics, Muslims, Evangelicals, however, he doesn't mention any accuracies of the biblical prophesies or neither does he engage in the intelligent design controversy (beginnings of life), no dispute against Dembski, Meyer, or Behe's claims of Creation.  He doesn't address the origin of the ""DAWKINS MORALITY"".  How does he know what is moral without God.   His arguments are weak for atheism.  No engaging in conversations with solid Christian apologists.  I thought perhaps he'd change my mind. Richard Dawkins is not that smart, at least not in this movie. I could say more, but I think I've given the atheist mud to sling back.  My prediction, Dawkins's life ends as Niche's, insanity and prolonged agonizing death.  I do like his british smile though; it does look animal-like.   "

Haha, Intelligent design. Don't you mean the evolution of homo-sapiens? you silly, silly, Christians - Always so convinced that your god is the only true god. A wise man once said, ""I contend that we are both Atheists, I just believe in one less god than you. When you understand why you dismiss all other possible gods, then you will understand why I dismiss yours'"""
