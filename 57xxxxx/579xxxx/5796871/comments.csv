,156gbe56,2011-07-02T22:15Z,Someone needs to seed this if possible.
,156gbe56,2011-07-09T14:02Z,"stuck at 75% for a week, somebody should realy seed!!!"
,1337kage,2011-09-21T19:03Z,"I own the actual game. After being stuck at 80,4% for a while, I decided to give up and just dig in my old boxes. I finally found it.

However, to my horror, the installer is 16-bit, and won't work on my 64-bit version of windows.

If anyone wants, I can make a new torrent from this game and seed that instead, as this torrent  seems to be dead."
