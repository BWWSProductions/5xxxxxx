"Feel It Boy" is a 2002 single by deejay Beenie Man from the album Tropical Storm.

The music video was directed by Dave Meyers. Set on an island beach, it depicts different characters in their daily life with Jackson and Beenie Man on the beach enjoying the surroundings and different activities around them. Towards the end, Beenie Man pulls in a fourwheeler near Janet and begins to eye her with binoculars. The video ends with a party that was mentioned in the song. The video was filmed on Westward Beach in Malibu, California.

The song was written by Beenie Man and produced by award-winning duo The Neptunes. It was released as a single on September 16, 2002, peaking in the top 20's and 30's in most countries. It spent 12 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #28. It also peaked at #9 on the UK Singles Chart.

However, its release also sparked controversy, as UK Gay Rights group OutRage! called for a boycott of the single, citing Beenie Man's "history of homophobic dancehall lyrics." In 2004, Jackson expressed her regret for the duet, saying "If I had known that (he was associated with homophobia), I would not have worked with him. It's shocking to me. We're on the same label, so I should have known. But at the same time, I wish someone from the company would have told me, knowing how... I feel about the gay community." The song appeared in the Japan-only radio promo sampler We Love Janet in 2006.

Tropical Storm is reggae, dancehall artist Beenie Man's 12th studio album. It was released on August, 20, 2002. The album is a mix of dancehall and reggae fusion, with hit singles such as "Feel It Boy" featuring R&B singer Janet Jackson and "Bossman" featuring dancehall artists Lady Saw & Sean Paul.

Anthony Moses Davis (born August 22, 1973), better known by his stage name Beenie Man, is a grammy award winning Jamaican reggae artist.

In 2002, he had a sizeable hit with a duet with Janet Jackson called "Feel It Boy", but his biggest break in America came in early 2004 with the release of a remix of "Dude", featuring guest vocals by fellow Jamaican Ms. Thing, as well as rhymes by Shawnna. He thus cemented his fan base on both sides of the Atlantic.

He had hits in the UK in 1998 with "Who am I" (#10), in 2003 with "Street Life" (#13) and "Feel It Boy" (UK #9), a duet with Janet Jackson, and in 2004 with "Dude" (#7) and "King of the Dancehall" (#14).

He was also a judge for the 6th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.

In April 2008 it was announced that Beenie Man was to co-write and star in the film Kingston.

In September 2008 Beenie Man was cleared of charges of tax evasion.

In April 2009, Beenie Man signed with Brookland Entertainment, a new record label formed by Eric Nicks and The Trackmasters, in preparation to release his new album, "The Legend Returns". The music video for the release of his new single â€œGimme Gimmeâ€ will be shot in Canada on April 18, 2009.
