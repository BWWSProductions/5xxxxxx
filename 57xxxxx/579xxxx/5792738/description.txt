    Dr Alice Roberts continues her journey through this        
    season's most important archaeology, with an amazing      
    array of finds from prehistory.                          
    Her journey takes her from Orkney to Devon by land, sea   
    and air.                                                   
    In Norfolk, flint tools unearthed this year push the      
    earliest human occupation back by 200,000 years, to      
    around one million years ago.                             
    In Orkney an early farm yields glimpses of our             
    ancestors' earliest religious beliefs and customs -       
    cattle skulls buried within building walls, and tiny     
    household goddesses.                                      
    In Devon, we find one of the oldest known shipwrecks.      
    And a bronze age burial holds a mystery, and touching     
    evidence of grief echoing down over 2000 years.
