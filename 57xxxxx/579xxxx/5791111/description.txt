Storyline: When a couple is taken hostage in their home by an intruder, a simple home invasion robbery turns into something much more complicated. The wife may, or may not, know the intruder; and the intruder may, or may not, have previously crossed paths with the husband. Can a couple survive once they have been exposed to each other for who (and for what) they really are? Is the intruder actually there just to rob them? What are they each trying to hide from him and from each other?
