,smasudi,2010-08-27T14:52Z,keep them coming.. what are u uploading next and when?
,azrash,2010-08-27T15:17Z,"@smasudi
currently encoding 500 days of summer.
maybe Batman Begins and Back To The Future Trilogy after that.

But have to atleast finish seeding the matrix trilogy and only after that i will continue uploading. Due to low bandwith speed that I have

Thanks guys for supporting me! try to seed longer, as my upload speed is only 30kbps average =.="

,azrash,2010-08-27T19:30Z,"@gary
yeah i asked him to do it in the first place and i am already halfway by the time he uploaded it, so I just continued, would be a waste right? hahaha

@kuttootta
bro, this is not my rip, this encoded by scOrp, check the details, I just upload it cause I have it with me. My rips would have the label 'x264 AzrAsh' behind it. Shooter is my rip, and the next one. hahaha I hope that clear things up. do check scorp's website though, he is good!

@Ryaar
I will try to seed until atleast two seeders have 100% cause I need to upload the next rips, Im sorry but my upload speed is only limited to 30kbps, I will re-seed the rest once Ive finished uploading. and i would check ahashare soon, not promising though

@8143125 
no prob bro! It is done by scOrp, you should thank him at 300mbunited.com, I merely shared his rip with the rest.

Enjoy guys!"
,azrash,2010-08-27T19:33Z,"@8143125

,XxCautionNJ84xX,2010-10-15T18:08Z,V9 A9 If it would only WORK! as you watch from the begining the movie's start to freeze. The audio is out of sync badly. If you could fix this problem this would be a really good torrent.
