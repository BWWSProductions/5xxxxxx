Merchants of Doubt

Naomi Oreskes discusses the small yet potent subset of the scientific community that leads the world in vehement denial of public health dangers such as DDT, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming.

In MERCHANTS OF DOUBT: HOW A HANDFUL OF SCIENTISTS OBSCURED THE TRUTH ON ISSUES FROM TOBACCO SMOKE TO GLOBAL WARMING, Oreskes and Erik M. Conway explain how a loose-knit group of scientists and advisers, with deep connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decadesâ€”from the link between smoking and lung cancer to carbon dioxide and climate change.
