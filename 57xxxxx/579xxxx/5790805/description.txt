Authority on ancient and prehistoric sites in Egypt, Robert Bauval, discussed the pyramids at Giza, the Sphinx, and evidence that the origins of ancient Egyptian culture come from a black race in the Sahara. He reviewed his groundbreaking theory that the pyramids were aligned to correspond with stars in the Orion belt, and that the age of the Sphinx is much older than previously believed. Interestingly, he noted that the Sphinx is not a created monument, but rather a large natural block that was carved. 

The temples on the east side of the pyramids at Giza are mysterious in their origin, said Bauval. The erosion of them is much more extensive than the pyramids, suggesting they are far older-- and they're built with enormous 100-200 ton blocks. To move blocks of this size without the wheel or pulleys is inexplicable, he noted. "It's alien thinking," to use such unwieldy blocks, and they probably date to an earlier megalithic era from around the time of the Sphinx, he added. 

Discoveries at a ceremonial site at Nabta Playa in the Egyptian desert include a stone circle/solar calendar dated to 6,000 â€“ 7,000 BC, predating Stonehenge by thousands of years, he reported. One buried complex there has stones aligned to star systems like Orion and Sirius, the same as the Pharaohs. Bauval and Thomas Brophy (who appeared in the first segment) contend that the black Africans of this time period eventually moved into the Nile Valley and injected their civilization and sophisticated astronomical knowledge into what became Pharaonic Egypt. 

Exoplanet Analysis
During the first half-hour, Richard C. Hoagland commented on the new exoplanet solar system discovery (see article below). He noted that one of the planets orbits around its sun in just 1.8 days, and that we are beginning to see the diversity of conditions in which solar systems form. A NASA conference on new discoveries from the Kepler space telescope is scheduled for Thursday, he added.
