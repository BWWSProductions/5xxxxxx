LoveGame Extended Mix
-Running time 4 minutes 58 seconds (4:58)

"Whole Lotta LoveGame"
"Love Game [L-Squared Mix]"

Lady Gaga vs. Led Zeppelin (feat. Marilyn Manson)
(John Baldwin/Willie Dixon/Stefani Germanotta/Nadir Khayat/Jimmy Page/Robert Plant)

LoveGame, with samples from Trampled Under Foot, Whole Lotta Love, and the Chew Fu remix of LoveGame (which is where the Marilyn Manson verse comes from)

You see, the letter 'L' was very well-represented in my media library evne long before I was introduced to Gaga.
Part of the idea here was to combine my classic favorite with

* The Zeppelin songs used have prime examples of their wicked instrumental grooves; also, they seemingly mesh better with dance/electronic beats than some other Zeppelin riffs might have.
* I also selected them due to _their_ lyrics' sexual euphemisms. I could sample these with Plant as another "character", and did so at a couple points. Also, is it just me, or do female pop stars catch more flak than male rock stars for similar material? I suppose that is a weird instance of the sexual double standard...
