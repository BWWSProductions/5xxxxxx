Night-Shine"
[V],NLUPPER002,2010-08-23T08:21Z,"Hoi Night-Shine,

In welk formaat wil je die, is er in dvd5 en in HD AVCHD volgens mij"
,UNISA,2010-08-23T11:05Z,"Hey NLUPPER

Thanks so much for the hard work.
I was looking around a few sites,  and cant seem to find Bad Boys I and Bad Boys II 1080p.
So if possible please could you upload them.
The bigger the mkv's the better!

Thanks
still seeding have ratio's of over 10 for the requested torrents i dl'ed"
,Nelus1993,2010-08-23T17:18Z,"Beste NLUPPER 

Bedankt dat je wat terug schrijft

DVD5 Is top en zou je asjeblieft tot de 3e Season  willen uploaden ik heb het net binnen en het is super slechte kwaliteit zou ik leuk vinden 

Night-Shine"
[V],NLUPPER002,2010-08-23T19:24Z,"Klopt het dat seizoen 1 7 dvd's groot is Night-Shine 

Ken de serie verder niet maar zie dat de meeste 6 dvd's zijn en andere weer 7 dvd's
"
,Nelus1993,2010-08-23T21:00Z,ja dat klopt wel
[V],NLUPPER002,2010-08-23T23:50Z,"@UNISA

Bad Boys I = available the source= Source: Bad.Boys.1995.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-CHD

Bad boys II = available the source= Source: Bad.Boys.2.2003.x264.1080p
DTS 6Ch 48 Khz 768 Mbps
But there is no original bluray from II so it got to be from HDTV  so i can not say how the quality is, the releaser have a good reputation and quality is aways good.
Just let me now"
,UNISA,2010-08-24T02:40Z,"Hey NLUPPER:

Please could you uplaod:  Bad.Boys.1995.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-CHD

I'd rather wait and when bad BoysII is out on BluRay, then i'd get it.
I'll dl pretty much any BluRay 1080p mkv, so long as the quality is great!

mch appreciated!!"
,amerelium,2010-10-03T14:36Z,Daemon tools won't mount the ISO - what am I doing wrong?
,Lacelru,2010-10-04T15:30Z,Daemon says it is mounted for me under the tray icon but I can't seem to access the disk so I'm guessing it's not actually being mounted.
,sh0ne,2011-02-08T19:52Z,"I can't play this in WMP 12 or Cyberlink Power DVD 10... When I try to play I get an error ""Unsupported format dics"".. How to play this on Windows 7?  "
,sh0ne,2011-02-13T22:10Z,Problem solved. Mount .mds file and not .iso file and no problem with WMP 12 or PowerDVD10. So trivial solution.
