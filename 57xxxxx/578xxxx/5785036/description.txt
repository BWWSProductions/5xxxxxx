    Serving time for a minor offense in a brutal women's detention           
    center, Eva (Jessica Morris) finds herself at the mercy of the evil      
    matron (Julia St. Clair), a sadistic guard (Dilio Nunez) and a gang      
    led by Killa Kim (Meredith McClain). With all hope lost, Eva makes a     
    midnight wish to a box of tiny South American Worry Dolls. The Dolls     
    crawl into her ear at night, possessing her with the dark powers she     
    needs to exact wicked vengeance on her tormentors.
