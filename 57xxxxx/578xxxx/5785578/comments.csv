the contrast and sharpeness aswell.
Video is ok for a cam but is overcropped on the top and bottom.
Audio..........now for this we have muxed polishbits ""line"" ,however to use it sounds a little more like cam audio,but very good cam audio.
Seems to have that echo to it that you get with cams but not on line.
However we could be wrong but this is way we tagged this release CAM READNFO."
