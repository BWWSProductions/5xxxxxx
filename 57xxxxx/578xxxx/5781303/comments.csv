I can't seem to find hindi movie called 'Udaan' (2010) anywhere. I know you said you will only rip popular hindi movies. But this one is quite ignored, so you might get more downloaders than others. Please see if you could rip this one when the Dvd will be available. Thanks."

,campsmoke,2011-11-04T00:17Z,"The movie quality isn't bad,
but since there are captions through-out
the entire movie, that sucks, and ruins
the entire movie. 

No-one want's to watch captions at the bottom
of the screen, what a distraction.

this is garbage. what a waste of a download.
why people put shit like that in there blows my mind."

,FalconX666,2012-04-05T04:25Z,"@Campsmoke, do you not realize the subtitles can be turned off? If you are too stupid to operate whatever video player you are using then just delete the .srt file if you don't want subs."
