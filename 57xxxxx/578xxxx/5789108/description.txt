THE CROSSOVER EVENT OF THE CENTURY CONTINUES! The stage has been set, the pieces are in place - the battle for the entire planet begins here. The villains of the Image Universe are united against the world, but who's pulling their strings?! You can't miss this historic event as the original Image Founders draw all the characters they made history with. Each page is an amazing jam piece - it's a story told in a way never before attempted in comics.
