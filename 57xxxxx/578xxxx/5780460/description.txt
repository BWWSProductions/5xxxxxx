BBC Natural World The Himalayas HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010

Documentary looking at the wildlife of the Himalayas, home to snow leopards, wolves and bears. Snow leopards stalk their prey among the highest peaks. Concealed by snowfall, the chase is watched by golden eagles circling above. On the harsh plains of the Tibetan plateau live extraordinary bears and square-faced foxes hunting small rodents to survive. Valleys carved by glacial waters lead to hillsides covered by paddy fields containing the lifeline to the East, rice.
