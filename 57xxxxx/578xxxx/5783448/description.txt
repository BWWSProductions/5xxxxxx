This torrent contains a small archive of radio broadcasts done by a few of the most notable American Patriot's fighting against the largest problem humans have ever faced. If you feel that there is something wrong with the world and want to get a better insight as to what that wrong is, please set your personal views aside for a few hours and listen to what other men have to say that are also upset and aware of the situation we live in every day.

If even one person finds this information to be the key to that cage, please pass it on to someone you care about and let the few rise over the many. Take care everyone.
