Before that, a window appear with the info that I'll need the following disks ""Motion Content 1"" and ""Motion Content 2"" but as you are saying I'm installing without that disks. In the end, the installation reports an error. Ok, Motion works but I can't find the Motion directory that should be at Macintosh HD/Lybrary/ApplicationSuport/FinalCutStudio/ So when I use it some items cant be found such as Particle Emitters, Replicators, Shapes, Gradients, Live Fonts and Text Styles...

First of all is not our computers it just the way we install it when u run the installer it then will show you all the different programs that are going to be installed in you your computer such as Final Cut, motion, etc.. when it shows you this you will be see all the programs checked uncheck all of them and start installing Final Cut (check final cut only) )only and then after it install's do the others individually and you should not have a problem. I hope this helps as I got it installed after doing it this way also make sure you have a valid serial.  "
