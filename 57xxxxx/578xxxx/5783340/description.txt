Review: 
Bernie Besman\'s Detroit based Sensation records is better known for its blues recordings.  But in three months mid 1948 the label cut five sessions that go right to the roots of modern jazz.  Milt Jackson, Sonny Stitt, Russell Jacquet and Sir Charles Thompson led these groundbreaking sessions.  The 1948 Sensation sessions w. Sonny Stitt, Milt Jackson, Sir Charles Thompson, Russell Jacquet, Leo Parker, Max Roach, J.J. Johnson, Kenny Clarke, John Lewis, Ray Brown.  Detroit\'s Sensation Records material belonged to either the blues or R&B fields, but in three months in mid 1948 Sensation recorded five sessions that go right to the roots of modern jazz.  The music the musicans played was at the heart of the organic changes happening in jazz, as it progressed from swing to both bop and the R&B flavoured modernism.
