An expose on the Illuminati agent and pedophile, Alfred Kinsey, the useful idiot who carried out the New World Order's "sexual revolution." Documentary examines Kinsey's tests, which employed pedophiles, rapists, murderers, and everything else you can imagine.

Kinsey singlehandedly normalized pedophilia, homosexuality, and promiscuous behaviour in America and eventually the world.
