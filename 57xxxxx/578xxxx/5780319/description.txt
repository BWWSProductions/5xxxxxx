Over the past few years, another TPBer by the handle thegreenfrog has generously uploaded gigs and gigs of AW material. I have downloaded every one of his torrents and am still in an ongoing process of sorting through them for those special models and sets that really trip my trigger. These sets will not intrigue everyone... some are a bit chubby for Hollywood tastes. Some might not have the most stereotypically and/or classically beautiful faces. But they all have that something that makes me like their sets. So I thought I would share them. I am not sure how many there will end up being, but I am guessing about two hundred all told.

 So... all thanks for these goes to thegreenfrog. Please seed after downloading. Thanks to all the other generous uploaders that make TPB work.
