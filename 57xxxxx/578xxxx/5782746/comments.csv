,esharoth,2010-08-23T10:05Z,"Track 4 of Empire Classic Radio from the 1950's is 'Auf Wiedersehân, Sweetheart', by Les Baxter. For some reason the program I used to create the NFO didn't read the tag correctly."

can you get the original soundtrack?"
,esharoth,2010-08-27T00:37Z,"Pt74, you mean the orchestral tracks that play during missions? If so, no, I don't plan on converting and uploading those. You can easily listen to them and convert them yourself with Music Player Ex, Google it."
,esharoth,2010-08-27T09:29Z,"Actually, ignore my comment above. Here is the orchestral soundtrack, which is included in the Collector's and Digital Deluxe editions of the game:
