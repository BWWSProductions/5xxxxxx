Solo was a bimonthly comic book series published by DC Comics between 2004-2006, which received three Eisner Awards.  The title was conceived as an anthology series to spotlight the work of a different comic book artist in each issue. The creators were free to tell stories in any genre  and to use DC's library of characters as they saw fit. They could also work with writers if they chose, but the intention of the series was for them to show off the range of their own individual artistic sensibilities and abilities. 

The creators featured in each issue are as follows:

#1 Tim Sale (with Jeph Loeb, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Diana Schutz)
#2 Richard Corben (with John Arcudi)
#3 Paul Pope
#4 Howard Chaykin
#5 Darwyn Cooke
#6 Jordi Bernet (with John Arcudi, Joe Kelly, Andrew Helfer, Chuck Dixon, and Brian Azzarello)
#7 Mike Allred (with Laura Allred and Lee Allred)
#8 Teddy Kristiansen (with Neil Gaiman and Steven Seagle)
#9 Scott Hampton (with John Hitchcock)
#10 Damion Scott (with Rob Markmam and Jennifer Carcano)
#11 Sergio AragonÃ©s (with Mark Evanier)
#12 Brendan McCarthy (with Howard Hallis, Steve Cook, Sir Trevor Goring, Robbie Morrison, Tom O'Connor and Jono Howard)

The series was overseen by painter and DC editor Mark Chiarello.
