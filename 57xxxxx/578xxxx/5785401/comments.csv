,DLM955,2010-08-31T14:06Z,I have used this several times and it always passed genuine check on micorsoft website Win 7 ultimate and Professional..But reading up on kb971033 I found it has a phone home feature it keeps checking to see if any new hacks have been added to detection list..Here is website about it and they tell you how to disable it...http://www.mydigitallife.info/2010/08/11/how-to-uninstall-and-remove-kb971033-windows-7-activation-update-watu/
,DLM955,2010-09-01T12:05Z,I used the two commands to disable kb971033 had no problem with updates but when I went to geniune web site I failed ...heres the fix go to updates and remove kb971033 then go back to validate site and reinstall from there you will pass again

I Think U must removewat and then install this:)) I did it and worked for me"
,Orhteeex,2010-09-23T11:26Z,"@invisible123 
Thansk for helping. I did remove wat, after that i restarted. When windows loaded, it asked for genuine. The last time I used activators it said that I should restart a few times. So I did and it still asks for genuine. And now the wallpaper is black.
Any more ideas? :)"
,Orhteeex,2010-09-23T11:49Z,"Hey, I think I got it now! I dont know how but I got it, I removed the wat, afterwards i unistalled the othe activators, and then installd this one. 
I went to the microsoft site and got it working! Hope it will hold to the next restart! :D :D"
,deba.debo,2010-10-01T12:38Z,"@invisible123 :This loader works even if you don't remove wat.At first click uninstall then install after you restart.
This loader is the best loader available."
