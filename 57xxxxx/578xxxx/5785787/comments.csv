,Gdowson,2010-09-18T11:52Z,"Download this app only if you really, really want to learn this program -- because there is no way to install it or even to use it without letting it access the internet. In fact, it communicates with the net when you first fire up your computer. 

My own system has slowed somewhat since installation. That's often a sign of malware. 

That said, I've done thorough scans with every anti-malware program in my arsenal -- and it's a pretty sizable arsenal. (I'm not one of those guys who is content to rely on AVG and Malwarebytes, both of which are, in my experience, weak sisters.) I have to admit -- I've found nothing. By all reports, it's a clean machine.

Also, Blacktroy has a good rep. I've scanned the comments generated by his previous uploads, and so far as I can see, he has never been accused of uploading a virus before. 

Nevertheless, something feels ""hinky.""

I'm not saying that this is a sketchy upload. But by its nature, this app communicates with the net at all times. It simply will not work otherwise. That factor makes it worrisome -- I never let any of my other programs talk to the internet.

I'll probably be doing a re-install soon, and I doubt that I'll include this app. Besides -- even by 3D standards, it's really hard to learn!"
,Gdowson,2010-09-18T12:05Z,"Added note -- none of this is meant as a slam at Blacktroy; everyone here is quite grateful to him.

I should note, though, that his install instructions leave out one detail: Use your administrator account.

And, er, leave the internet ON."
