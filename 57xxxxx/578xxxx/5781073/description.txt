Cult Holmes - Series 01 - AudioBooks - BBC7 
5 x 30 Minute Episodes - 64Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo 



These were lifted off my MiniDisc so were recorded via BBC7 DAB @ 80Kbps Mono.
I re-ripped them @ 64k so if repeated by BBC7 it's worth recapping them. 



Five unusual new cases read by Hannah Gordon and Andrew Sachs - produced in association with BBC7.
