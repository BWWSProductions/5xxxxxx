,Robearwgl,2012-02-07T02:27Z,"you people suck. individual .flacs would have been ok so someone could convert them to mpeg, but one .flac for each album? enough to make you sick. WTF is flac good for anyway?"
,muddyblue,2012-05-07T20:18Z," FUCK YOU Robearwgl. Don't you see the download file contents CUE File. If you use this file with foobar 2000 you can split tracks and convert to any file you want even the fucking mpeg file. So you can put the mpeg file into your fucking ass or your bastard parent. Robearwgl you are fucking silly stupid idiot trash.
