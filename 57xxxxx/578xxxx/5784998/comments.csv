Finally Texas Slim fans can rejoice, for their 7-year itch for a new Texas Slim CD has ended! Itâ€™s hard to believe 2002â€™s ""I Have Arrived"" has sustained loyal lovers of â€œHis Slimnessâ€ all these days. Of course, in the interim, a Texas Slim â€˜Joneserâ€™ could be satisfied by attending any one the Dallas nativeâ€™s hundreds of Metroplex-area juke joint or international festival appearances.

But now, with the August 2009 TopCat Records release of Driving Blues, Texas Slim loyalists have their own 13-track â€œporta-pakâ€ of the popular blues guitar virtuoso. As with his 2002 CD, Texas Slim once again teams with producer/drummer/percussionist Aaron Comess (Spin Doctors), who also provides bass and percussion support throughout the CD. Texas Slim also recruits keyboardist Andy Comess, using his skills on the CD-opening â€œWelcome to the Game,â€ the rocking little ditty â€œCoffee Shop Girl,â€ and soulful ballad â€œHigh Alertâ€.

Composer credit for all tracks on the disc goes entirely to Texas Slim, who gives each one the requisite dose of superior six-string licks necessary to sustain his reputation of guitar-playing pre-eminence.

Following the rousing title cut, tempos on the remaining selections vary, keeping it interesting. Interspersed among the whimsical â€œFunky Love,â€ swinging boogie â€œYouâ€™re Hipâ€ and catchy shuffle of â€œWhen Itâ€™s Cold Outside,â€ youâ€™ll find a haunting â€œThree Bridges Blues,â€ Texas Slimâ€™s lonesome Dobro calling you back to your â€œCountry Homeâ€ or summing up lifeâ€™s simple pleasures in â€œAnd It Isâ€.

Texas Slim varies his style and tone when delivering his ballads, vocally complementing each oneâ€™s emotional intent. This is particularly evident on â€œDeville,â€ a smoky, raspy number, whose loneliness is significantly enhanced with Todd Hortonâ€™s lonely trumpet and electric piano from Pat Daughery. He takes a slight stylistic detour on â€œCool with the Flow,â€ a rather pop-textured number reminiscent of Pablo Cruise or Boz Scaggs. Slimâ€™s guitar is happy and busy on the upbeat â€œCool,â€ and he highlights each verse with snappy little snippets of quality fretwork and a healthy infusion of Hortonâ€™s trumpet accents. It works.

Driving Blues is a sure-fire blues craving killer, Slim! It was worth the wait!"
