LA LETTRE aka THE LETTER
by Michel Gondry (1998)

Gondry's assistant FranÃ§ois NÃ©mÃ©ta sayd about La Lettre:

[...] La lettre was shot in january 1998 for a TV program which was called "en attendant l'an 2000" (waiting for year 2000) on Canal +. Canal + had given some money to make a short film to several directors (Marc Caro, Francois Ozon and Michel Gondry) for this program. The theme had to be ... year 2000. 

[...] Michel did a short film which was completely anti modern, in black and white, with no amazing technique at all, except "photographic basics". This short movie has the typical look of the 50's black and white french movies. It was shot on Ilford 35mm film. All the special effects were done "in camera", old fashioned style. 

[...] It gives a very true and pure adolescent, cruel story about love and girls, as seen from the eyes of a young shy french boy.  The young boy has a lot of the young Michel in him: as him, he was always having his 35mm camera around his neck, always framing his friends, doing photos, learning with his brothers the very first photographic techniques.
