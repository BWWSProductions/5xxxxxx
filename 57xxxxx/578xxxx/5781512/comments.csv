,bukowski01,2010-11-03T13:17Z,"I received an infrinment notice straight after down loading this film. 

This is the second time I have received recently and all of these infringement notices have demonstrated the same pattern.

- All torrents have been first uloaded by the Greatmagician

- All of these greatmagician torrents had viewer comments claiming how awesome the A & V are ie 10/10

- All of these torrents had serious problems with both Audio ( often out of sync) & Visuals ( missing singular frames, slow & jolty )

It is my opnion that the GreatMagician is actually a complete fraud - they are probably a team of hackers design to send out bogus torrents to set up unsuspecting people

The quality of this film is terrible as was the story line.

Genuinly guys dont download great magician torrents cause they suck.. "

Don't be a wiener. Make a name for yourself and quit wasting your time blackballing the competition. We have you beat- you can't win.
And of course you got a notice; GreatMagician's givin' out more copies of ""Salt"" for free than Netflix purchased to support the WHOLE planet... Oh nooo, not a notice!! What'd you get a paper cut?? Sticks & stones- not notices."
,MarcPudd,2011-06-02T20:23Z,Magician .... you are THE MAN .... great quality and sound 10/10
