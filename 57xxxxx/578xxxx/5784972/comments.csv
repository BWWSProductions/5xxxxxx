,ohrton,2010-08-25T02:21Z,"It has a professional animated menu and great video. Although some the navigation buttons in the scene selection seem questionable. The sound is great too on my headphones and stereo.
But in VLC when I go to the options in the movie menu for 5.1, when highlighting 5.1 the words say 2.1. So it is true real 5.1 data or not.
I haven't burned to DVD yet. I've never been able to get 5.1 on VLC to my optical to work on movies so I can't test that unless I burn it."

Thanks for the upload."

Is it possible to have your *.lab file?
You do a great work in the same manner as I do. 
Audio isn't real 5.1 but it's ok and better then line. 
Just a Q from me. 
Co-operation is the future.

,ohrton,2010-10-06T04:49Z,"ImgBurn, burn files/folders to disc, select the VIDEO_TS folder and it will detect it as DVD and burn it as a DVD."

what in the fuck does ""This is NTSC see information above"" mean when it doesn't say where the fuck it came from. Tells me it's not a real dvd, just some shit made from some other source!"
