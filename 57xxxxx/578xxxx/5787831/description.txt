Saturday Morning Apocalypse is the upcoming second studio album by the extreme power-metal cover band Powerglove to be released September 28th, 2010 through E1 Music. This album will stray from Powerglove's usual brand of video game metal, and will instead be centered around TV, cartoon, and movie themes the band grew up with. This will be the band's first release on E1 Music.
