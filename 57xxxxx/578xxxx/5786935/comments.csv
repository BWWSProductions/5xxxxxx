,xcultxxxx,2010-09-11T04:33Z,PS3 users beware: this has the Cinavia DRM and will not play on PS3 consoles. Google Cinavia for more info
,lilkiss,2010-09-14T06:03Z,always a pleasure
,pgf95,2010-09-14T19:41Z,shawn of the dead rules BTW
,SodaGod,2010-09-19T23:26Z,Honestly you guys should go support this movie instead of pirating it. It's really underrated and you can go to your local dollar theater and pay next to nothing to see great quality.
,G0DL355,2010-09-20T19:11Z,"@ Soda God - be a pirate, or don't be a pirate.  I went to see this film in the cinema on the strength of what the torrent represented.  Don't just assume all downloaders dont go to the cinema or buy the dvd.  If anything, it's a try-before-I-buy service."
,thedecking,2010-09-22T19:35Z,"EPIC EPIC MOVIE!!!

I'm glad I actually went to the cinema and paid to see this one, well worth the money.  I got that same feeling I had the first time I saw the matrix, it just blows your mind.  You will have never seen a movie like this before.

I'm usually a believer in the ""try before you buy"" idea but was glad I saw this one in the cinema first."
,Suchalamename,2010-10-02T16:01Z,Annyone Got English subs For this one?
,ipholio,2010-10-13T06:19Z,"Just got an email today from NBC Studios and ATT&T (my ISP), giving me a warning for downloading this specific torrent. Not sure if it's tracked by them or what, they definitely are watching people downloading this movie though."
,Dragius,2010-10-14T20:42Z,@ipholio This movie came out like 2 months ago to cinemas. Ofcourse they will be tracking those who download it. Anyways I shall sit back and wait for DVD rip ^^
,Clamento,2010-10-22T02:04Z,"You clearly are fighting about the Pirating part...
And some people are telling you to go to the cinemas.....

I WOULD LIKE TO, IF MY LAZY ASS COUNTRY WOULD SHOW IT THERE!!!
I HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE END OF JANUARY!!!"
,MarinaFC,2010-10-23T15:35Z,I also got an e-mail from NBC and my service provider [charter] ....it seems they have some attachment to this movie...
,rubyloader,2010-11-04T00:04Z,"Quality is just awful, the beginning is completely cut off and it looks like it was shot with an 8mm.

,Webberjo,2010-11-10T08:27Z,This is a cam recording. Don't bother getting it.
,Faust291,2010-11-12T12:57Z,"Decent Video quality, but horrible audio, everything sounded like it was ripped of a 20 year old VHS, DL just the sample to see what i mean."
