Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.

On with the game release information:

Vito Scaletta has started to make a name for himself on the
streets of Empire Bay as someone who can be trusted to get a
job done. Together with his buddy Joe, he is working to prove
himself to the Mafia, quickly escalating up the family ladder
with crimes of larger reward, status and consequence... the
life as a wise guy isn't quite as untouchable as it seems.

Action-Packed Gameplay: Intense gunplay, white-knuckle car
chases and visceral hand-to-hand combat - it will take all
that and more to become a "made man".

Epic Gangster Story: Inspired by iconic mafia drama, the
compelling characters and cinematic presentation will pull
players into the allure and impossible escape of life in the
Mafia.

Immersive World and Period: Enter the world of Empire Bay -
World War II is raging in Europe and the architecture, cars,
music and clothing all echo the period in stunning detail. As
time passes, hot rod cars, 50s fashion and some of the era's
best music reflect the birth of a cool new era.

Illusion Engine: 2K Czech's proprietary Illusion Engine,
allows gamers to explore
Empire Bay's 10 square miles of beautifully rendered outdoor
environments and intricately designed interiors.

Soundtrack Reflects the Mood of the Era: Players will be
immersed in the Golden Era of America as Mafia II features
tracks from some of the era's most influential artists.

Install Notes:

1. Unpack release
2. Mount image or burn it
3. Install
4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to the
/pc/ folder inside the main installation dir and overwrite
5. Play the game

Additional Notes:

If you have used any of these hacked demo cracks out there,
then make sure you start a new game, as your old saves will
make the game crash. The main reason why it wont work, is
because those "cracks" are modified demo exes.

Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy

Nice job Valve on updating CEG, but as you can see that didn't
help much. Good luck in wasting more money for the next update
