When I start Mafia 2 with the cracked *.exe, I get this message: Mafia 2 is not responding. This application will now close.

That happends to me everytime when I try to start it. I downloaded the Mafia II Skidrow game, plus this crackfix. So it should work.

Before I downloaded Mafia II from Skidrow, I downloaded that one from Globe. I had the same error message there :S. That's why I started downloading Mafia 2 from Skidrow since his releases are always nice. So I got the same error message @ two different releasers. Weird isn't it?

Could anyone give some help? Thanks ;)!"

To get past the problem, while on chapter 14, DO NOT ROB ANY STORES (e.g. Gas Stations, Clothing, Food, or Gun Stores). To make up the spare $ simply steal a few cars & take them to the crusher.

I tried reinstalling, installing the stuff in the 3rd folder, even deleting the appdata in my user folder and can't seem to work out how to fix it.

The other problem I'm having that isn't a big concern is the xbox controller I have for my pc instead of X Y A B is B1 B2 B3 and B4"

Make sure you are putting it in the pc folder, not the main Mafia II folder where the launcher is.  Also, try clicking on the MafiaII.app you just put in with the crack and see if that works instead of the launcher."

All you have to do is get to the 3rd chapter and then it goes away, this worked for both me and my brother. The only problem with this is that you have to fight gangsters, so it took me about an hour and a half to pass. I think that the 2nd chapter still has the problem even after doing this, but so far, the rest of the game doesn't. I hope this helps some others."
