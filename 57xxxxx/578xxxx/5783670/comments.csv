EVERYONE - Please Read This! -

I am also downloading and encoding stuff for you guys like crazy. I am constantly filling up my hard drives, and I am about have to another 500 GBs. I am doing my best to fill everyones requests, and in the meantime, I am trying expose everyone to my personal taste in tv-shows, movies, and porn. lol.  I am also trying to widen everyones horizons / preferences and help you consider watching things that you might not have watched without someone insisting. (^_^)"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-23T23:18Z,"@ TKOG11 - I will do Better Off Ted S02, later in the week, also sorry about Entourage, I have been busy. I usually encode stuff as I get it.

@ One_Burnt_Potato - I am sorry to here that you got a virus, but I scan everything before I upload it to the seedbox, and it does the seeding for me, so I dont come in contact with anyone for privacy and virus issues. BTW, what security program do you use, cuz I use Norton 360. I will do my best to fill your request.

@ haznii - I dont have Heroes s04 and Lost's final season, but as soon as I get it I will encode and upload them. So be patient, please. (^_^) 

@ kombatrat - It is probably the resolution, cuz my old encode that were in mp4 were at 320x240, and I used a different program than I do now.

I use the cheap  AVG, Adaware, and the windows ones

The Virus was Called Malware doctor A rogue virus that tries to hack you and force you to buy a Virus remover when you dont actually have any viruses.
 After awhile it can break your computer and it pops up every second saying your computer is about to be hacked click here to buy the program

It was an easy fix for me so no worries, i just hope it doesnt happen again, Havent had any problems with HR, OOO,or pT  But im sure it wasnt anything that you did. 

Lookin forward to some of your releases (:
Got any good porn? :O Im more into softer stuff but I like most lol XD"
