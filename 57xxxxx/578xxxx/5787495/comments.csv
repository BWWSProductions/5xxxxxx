""seeders"" are people who have already downloaded the file. ""leaches"" are people who are trying to download the file. you are a ""leach"". without ""seeds"" your file wont download. the more ""seeds"" / less ""leaches"" a file has, the faster it will download. the only way to get more ""seeders"" is for people who have already finished downloading, to ""seed"" it."
