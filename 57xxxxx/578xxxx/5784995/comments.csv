,chloro2008,2010-08-24T08:05Z,"So many many thanks Bitstreeem, I'm on my 3rd day and it's goin'...well...better. I can't beleive you find Tobor, I was 4 or 5 when I first saw it...and I was an innocent child, happy and in love with the robot. Thank you so much!!!

GeekHillbilly, I did pray for you (sorry for the non beleivers-I respect everyone beliefs) and I hope it will get better soon. BTW I have more than a hundred Sci-Fi movies from the 40's to the Hammer's days of the '60s. So if you want a title that Bitstreeem don't have ( very unlikely), I will be more than happy to uploade it.

Cheers!...huh...I mean: Have a nice time everybody and thanks to our Host, Bitstreeem."
