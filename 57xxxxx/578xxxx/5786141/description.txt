Nightmare House 2 is a free, horror-themed first-person-shooter game, and the direct successor of the first classic horror map pack "Nightmare House". Nightmare House 2 is based on the Source Engine by Valve, also considered a modification (mod) made for Half Life: Episode 2.

The story resumes with the player lost and confused in a hospital known as "Never Lose Hope". With no understanding of how you came to be there, there's only a vague memory of the mysterious, haunting girl from Nightmare House. Soon it will be difficult to determine between a dream and reality. How long will it take you to realize that escape is not an option?
