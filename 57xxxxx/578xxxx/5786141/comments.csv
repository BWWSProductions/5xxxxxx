[V],harry711,2010-09-30T15:20Z,@lbofficer: Do you have HL2:EP2 installed (you need it installed to play this mod)? You could also try turning down the settings.
,Steror,2011-01-12T15:45Z,"Yeah... I'd like to play this game but... I don't wanna buy steam, will this work with a cracked HL2:EP2? And if there's something I should do myself to make this work just tell me..."
,poroner,2011-04-06T23:58Z,"1) u dont buy steam its free
2)i hate steam
3)i hate steam

[V],harry711,2011-04-21T03:51Z,"Slow reply, it should work without Steam as long as you have the HL2 EP2 materials."
,ViscEV,2011-06-02T18:58Z,"I'm having the same problem in the chef room. When I go in and retrieve the axe, the chef's head is already missing. I know he's supposed to get up and attack me when I approach the door, but this isn't happening because he's...headless?"
,ViscEV,2011-06-02T19:03Z,"I tried noclipping my way out of the room and it appears to be working fine... I can't play much more now, but other triggers seem to be working, such as doors locking and unlocking, as well as area-specific sound effects."

@ViscEV
hey i had same problem.. that cafeteria with headless chef.. and i solved it :) i registered just to help you guys!
ok solution: just as you open the door of cafeteria, pick up a wheel-chair from the previous room & place it in the place of open door in such a way that one wheel can get stuck when the door is closed.. so once you have placed the wheel-chair, go towards chef, pick up the axe, the door is closed but one wheel is stuck so the door is only little open, now when you try to open it won't turn the handle of door, door is still closed & you are still trapped (but bot for long) back up a little (i.e. go towards chef) then come back to door, again go towards chef, then go towards door, and then the door opens on its own, quickly get out & save :)
it actually works.. funny though!
i tried it 4 times & i was successful 3 times. hope it helps. if any problem just ask!"
