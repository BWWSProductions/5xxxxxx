Even school can be cool when Dennis and the gang get mayhem and mischief on the timetable - six new episodes of the Beano's favourite troublemaker...

It's all for fun and fun for all as Dennis and his trusty pesky pals - curly and pie-face - as well as matey mutt Gnasher, bring uproarious pranks and anarchic adventures to Beanotown.

Walter and the softies watch out! It's pie-fights and water bombs galore as the school rules go loopy; a surprise candidate appears at the prize giving; dad proves a block off the old chip; pie-face somehow does dancing; tension mounts in a game of grand Dennissimo and a school trip heralds the discovery of the ancient warrior tribe of Dennis!
