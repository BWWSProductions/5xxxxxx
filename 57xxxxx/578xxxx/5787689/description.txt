Delta Force: Xtreme 2 (DFX2) lets players control a member of the elite Delta unit of the United States Army. Battle throughout Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, fighting to defeat an evil cartel of ex-Soviet officers selling military hardware to drug lords and terrorists on the black market. Each mission objective revolves around destroying enemy bases, retrieving information, disabling missiles and other WMDs, and other military-oriented goals.

DFX2 uses the Blackhawk engine that the original DFX was also built on. However, improvements to engine have allowed much faster multiplayer code, support for more players, enhanced ballistics, improved anti-cheat, and significant changes to the balance of game play in order to support more vehicles but also better, smoother and more accurate close-quarters play.

Progressive spawn system has been added allowing the player to re-spawn directly into unoccupied seats in a friendly-controlled vehicle or at a forward spawn point. This improves entire tempo of game play from the original and keeps the action much more intense and frequent.

In single player and co-op mode, players battle through 2 campaigns with 10 missions . There is also a heavy focus on multiplayer gaming with all of the familiar FPS modes (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Flagball (a CTF variant), and King Of The Hill).Up to 150 players at one time online via Novalogics NovaWorld community server site.
