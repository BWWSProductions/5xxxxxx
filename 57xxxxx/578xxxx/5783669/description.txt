Model packs included are: 1-7, 9-14. 16-26, 28-30, 30, 35-37 and zombie apocalypse pack 39 + sprite pack 1

Just unpack, install using setup.exe or setupscreen.exe, serial is located in the folder

And about updating, the serial was still active for me after updating to latest version. Dont know if it'll work for you tho!

U can find the updates at FPS Creators homepage
