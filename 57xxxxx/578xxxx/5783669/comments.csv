,fuckkkkk,2011-01-07T04:40Z,"Backdoor:Win32/Beastdoor.S

It popped up as soon as I opened up the model pack 35.

Any info on this? Or is my antivirus just being overprotective. Microsoft security essentials picked this up."
,djtaraly,2011-02-28T20:58Z,"Hello all the model packs 35 virus :) the name beastdoor.S only the model pack 35 !!!! :)
This program provides access to the remote computer, which is being installed. :)"
,dakoslug,2011-03-27T19:59Z,What are the requirements for this program?
,mitchboy,2011-04-20T21:42Z,"Works very nice, i haven't found any problems. Thanks for the great work!(By the way, does someone knows where to find the newest model packs???)"
,Khafka,2011-04-25T01:30Z,"I installed the update and now the serial won't work. :(

I also keep getting error messages too. It was working 100% fine before installing the update, which I needed to do as some textures weren't showing properly."
,A7X050393,2011-07-15T15:36Z,"Great Download, but when i installed the Model Packs FPS Creator kept crashing, because the scripts were updated incorrectly. Trying to work out now exactly which pack cause the error. Post again when i work it out."
,A7X050393,2011-07-15T18:20Z,"Ok! 

So after installing and unistalling faulty packs, trying to work out which worked and which didnt, i have a list of the working packs.

The following packs, once installed cause some sort of issue in game (crashing) or during the map edit (more crashing). They may work for some, but i would recommend NOT INSTALLING;
- Pack 3
- Pack 4
- Pack 5
- Pack 10
- Pack 14
- Pack 18
- Pack 28

Pack 29 didn't cause any crashes, however the models in the file didn't render in the game correctly, though again that might be my PC.

Feel free to install all the packs and uninstall them separately as some may work for you, however i have spent about 4 Hours doing this so i feel its best you save some time also.

All other packs work perfectly (Pack 39 and Pack 9 personal favs)

Thank You very much for the upload, and Happy Gaming to All!"

,RedRedd,2011-12-01T21:44Z,"------For those of you who are having trouble with windows 7 or vista: right click fps creator x9 > hit the compatibility tab > check the box that says ""run in compatibility mode"" > select Windows xp sp2 (or anything that has windows xp in it's name) > check the box that says ""run this program as an administrator""------
You won't have any problems with it! You have to do this for other game makers made for xp as well."
