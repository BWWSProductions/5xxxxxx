,jon4fun,2010-08-23T13:16Z,"@ Glenn_K9 - FUCK OFF PRICK!

Not only do you not read the very descriptive title you don't even bother to read the last paragraph of 20-40s post.

He is working on a cobbled together PC that could die at any moment. We, all of us, are lucky to get anything. 
I watch 20-40 shows on a PS3 with via HDMI to a 32"" LCD and the quality is A/V = 10.

Shithead, fuck off and get your torrents from another source. I'm sure there are plenty of 'HDTV' files out there up around the 1GB+ mark. 
Otherwise shut-the-fuck-up!

Jon"
