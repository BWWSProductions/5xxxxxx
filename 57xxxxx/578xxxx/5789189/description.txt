Scheduled Guests
................


No guests today. Alex covers a wide range of topics, including law enforcement in D.C. using pre-crime software, the latest developments on the economy and the IMF, and the continued militarization of society. 


No "official" guests, I suppose.  Steve Shenk of Jones-sponsor efoodsdirect.com is on for an eight-minute "live commercial" early in hour 2.  Ted Anderson of Midas Resources [and GCN] is on in the latter part of hour 3.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
