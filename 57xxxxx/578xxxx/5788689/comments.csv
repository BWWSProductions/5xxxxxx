game money is euro's, not dollars lol"
,RuneRifle,2010-10-12T15:12Z,"Try options and check if it's possible to change to dollars..

if not.. Amount does not change with the currency so it doesn't really matter :P"
,RuneRifle,2010-10-14T20:23Z,"Almost forgot:
I checked, and yes, it's possible to change it to dollars. When in a game, go to options and you'll see the dropdown box. There are multiple currencies available."
,Ladypoesss,2010-10-25T14:19Z,Is it possible to save the games you played?
,RuneRifle,2010-10-26T11:56Z,"yes ofcourse, why else would I upload it? :P

It is possible that you have to run it in compatibility mode windows XP SP3, because it can get stuck in vista/7 sometimes"
