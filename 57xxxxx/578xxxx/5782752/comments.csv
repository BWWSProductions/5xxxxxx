,daba_1,2010-08-22T15:36Z,"Blues/funk guitarist Craig Erickson learned to play while working in his father's record store in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He formed his first band at 13, and began playing around the area. Erickson signed a contract with Blues Bureau Intl. in the early '90s, releasing Roadhouse Stomp! in 1992 and Retro Blues Express the following year. Though the albums featured John Onder on bass and Atma Anur on drums, Erickson's regular band -- with which he has supported blues legends such as Koko Taylor, Little Ed & the Blues Imperials, Elvin Bishop and Lonnie Brooks -- includes bassist Al Robinson and drummer Kerri Collings. Erickson recorded Two Sides of the Blues for a 1995 release, and followed up with Force Majeure one year later. He appeared on tribute albums to Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King (Hats Off to Stevie Ray, Fit for a King), and also co-wrote and played on Blues, the solo album by Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple, Trapeze)."
