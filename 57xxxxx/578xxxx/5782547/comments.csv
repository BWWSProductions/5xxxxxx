,Polarise,2010-08-22T14:43Z,"A= 3/4 V=4/5
suggest waiting for a decent copy as starts in russian all illustrated notes/writing at start in russian then goes english spoken at 2min 5 seconds but writing stays russian and some illustrated parts like phone ring etc are english. can hear some people speaking/laughing otherwise ok for cam and is watchable if you have seen at theater first and have been waiting to watch again otherwise bit dark but thanx for sharing "

,roland299,2010-08-22T16:24Z,"Raymond, Any chance of getting a copy of Restrepo?"
,Polarise,2010-08-22T17:41Z,ignore previous comments total crap swaps between english and russian audio with the russian video feed dont waste your time overall good movie best to wait for better copy in one language without talking/laughing and so on might be some time
,AtomSoft,2010-08-23T00:17Z,I am going to wait until a release with first 2 minutes in english also.... and then the words in english...  This movies isnt a movie you can simply dub... 
,keirwhitt,2011-01-06T11:42Z,this torrent isnt worth the time waited for its a terribly filmed angle with background noise and the quality is beyond ridiculous
