2001 Here Be Monsters    CD  Heavenly HVN LP 31 CD 

 
Jeff Buckley meets Nick Drake meets Badly Drawn Boy and Like sinking into a feather bed where the feathers maintain their softness even though they are made of chocolate.   Warm, intimate, luscious.  Strings, pianos, horns, guitars combine effortlessly with a talented singer song-writer with one of those voices that gently infuses your brain.  Like hearing the spawn of a three way all-male conception of Buckley, Drake and BDB.  These are the feelings evoked by all by two tracks of this little gem.     

Youâ€™ll get the idea that I rather like this chap.  You should too.
