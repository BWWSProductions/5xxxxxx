AN ADDITION FROM THE TORRENT UPLOADER:

Chad Beloin became a highly controversial independent artist in 2010 when he claimed he worked with producers Timbaland, Red One, and JR Rotem. He later admitted it was a publicity stunt.

Other than those rumours, Chad Beloin\'s entire career is 100% true, about his Deep Into The Nation Tour, I know it\'s happening because I\'ve got tickets to the first show, plus I\'ll definitely be watching the Livestream performance. I hope he finds this, cause if he does, Chad, please don\'t delete this... it\'s going to do you a HUGE favor, as well as, could you please do a few rehearsals on Livestream? I\'d love to watch!

ABOUT THE TORRENT:

This torrent includes Chad Beloin\'s albums \"Home Free: Deluxe Edition\" and \"Deep Into The Life of Chad Beloin Part One\". In addition, it includes the mixtape \"Love Is Us\", and Chad Beloin\'s resource album, \"Love Is Us Instrumentals\". I will modify this torrent as I get more Chad Beloin tracks.

YOU MAY NOTICE THAT \"DEEP INTO THE LIFE OF CHAD BELOIN PART ONE\" HAS TWO TRACKS IN COMMON WITH \"LOVE IS US\"- \"BODILICIOUS\" AND \"END OF THE ROAD\". CHAD BELOIN REMADE \"BODILICIOUS\" USING THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENTAL, ONLY REMASTERING IT, AND MAKING IT FLOW PROPER, AND CHAD FULLY REPRODUCED \"END OF THE ROAD\", MODIFIED THE FIRST VERSE, AND ADDED A SECOND VERSE. I PERSONALLY PREFER THE NEW VERSION, AS 1.THERE IS NO AUTOTUNE, AND 2.CHAD BELOIN PRODUCED THE BEAT***
