,famemon78,2010-08-22T02:21Z,"hey polifem hate to bother u but just wanted to send a quick reminder ur way about the Jigoku, Intentions of Murder, and Pigs And Warships re seeds :-)"
,famemon78,2010-08-22T02:27Z,Oops my bad looks like Intentions of Murder is being reseeded by someone already thanks! ..and just to clarify i wanted a reseed for Jigoku aka Hell the criterion DVD not the other Jigoku if u know what i mean :-)
[V],polifem2009,2010-08-22T06:35Z,"famemon, stop doing joints when asking for reseeds! Nakagawa's jigoku is being seeded for 2 days, and if you don't start working right away, it won't be anymore!"
,famemon78,2010-08-23T01:11Z,Dude why r u in such a bossy/pissy mood all the time ?! i appreciate your work and all and i never fail to show my appreciation either but ive just about had it with your attitude problem .. i didnt ask for a reseed on Nakagawas jigoku but thanks anyways
