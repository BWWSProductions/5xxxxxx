Movie Nfo - Work causes a single mother to move to China with her young son; in his new home, the boy embraces kung fu, taught to him by a master.

Review - In "The Karate Kid" Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) tells his student Dre (Jaden Smith), "Everything is kung fuâ€¦ The way you put on a jacket. The way you treat people." This envisioning of the original "The Karate Kid" is inspired. "The Karate Kid" is awesome. Director Harald Zwart and screenwriter Christopher Murphey basically follow Robert Mark Kamen's 1984 story reset in China. The distinguishing difference is Jackie Chan as kung fu teacher Mr. Han. Chan is a martial arts master and the real deal. He commands an emotional and authentic gravitas. Jaden Smith (Will Smith's son) possesses his dad's charisma and presence. Smith trained intensely, and looks strong in martial arts action. This "Karate Kid" has the same message, and now the exquisite martial arts to match. We see bright students practicing at the legendary Shaolin Temple. In a breathtaking scene an elegant woman demonstrates the snake kung fu style with a cobra on a beautiful mountain temple ledge.
