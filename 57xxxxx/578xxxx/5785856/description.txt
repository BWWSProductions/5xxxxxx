he Navy Lark - S01 to 15 - Audio Comedy - BBC7 & Tinternet
235 x 30 Minute Episode - 128K & 64k - MP3 - CMOTDibbler & Slimoo


The Navy Lark was a radio sit-com about life aboard a British Royal Navy frigate named HMS Troutbridge, based in HMNB Portsmouth (known by its local name of "The Island", transmitted on the BBC Light Programme and subsequently BBC Radio 2. It was produced by Alastair Scott-Johnston, and written by Laurie Wyman (with George Evans from the 12th Series onwards). For most of its run, it starred Stephen Murray, Jon Pertwee and Leslie Phillips.

Programmes were self-contained, without much in the way of ongoing continuity. A normal episode consisted of silly-ass Sub Lieutenant Phillips, scheming Chief Petty Officer Pertwee and bemused Lt. Murray trying to get out of trouble they created for themselves without being found out by their direct superior, Commander "Thunderguts" Povey.
