           Mary Walsh delivers boyfriend Kevin to a hospital for          
           routine outpatient surgery. But when Mary returns to take      
           him home, he's mysteriously vanished. An administrator         
           can find no record of him, and a police search turns up        
           nothing. Increasingly frantic, Mary's taken to staff           
           psychiatrist Dr. Bensley, who pronounces her unstable.         
           Now she must not only find her missing boyfriend, but          
           prove her own sanity as well. When a stranger informs her      
           he knows Kevin's whereabouts and demands a $10 billion         
           ransom, she has one hour to comply... and her boyfriend's      
           life hangs in the balance. Forced to embezzle the money        
           from the bank where she works, Mary soon discovers the         
           shocking truth behind the disappearance. Now time is           
           running out and she must take matters into her own hands       
           to save herself.
