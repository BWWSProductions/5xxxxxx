,hai2ubai2u,2010-08-25T07:02Z,"Wow, nice try at being a troll markie. Try harder next time."
,MitchEatsToast,2010-08-25T08:14Z,I almost belived that Mark tool. I LOVE you for uploading this! No joke.
,dexter111344,2010-08-25T08:43Z,"Greatest album of all-time. PRAISE JESUS! ""Phoenix"" is amazing. That markie guy is a liar.

,Dicohimself,2010-08-25T17:01Z,"serious, is just some fuck head going on about his life.... like fuck me or something is this like a joke, complete shit "
,HorizonsDub,2010-08-25T17:09Z,"Thankyou a heap for this, great speed & can't forget, a great album! ;-)"
,HorizonsDub,2010-08-25T17:21Z,"Thanks man, this is awesome!"
,EPICxSYN,2010-08-25T18:16Z,"i made an account on thepiratebay for the sole purpose of saying that THIS TORRENT IS FAKE.
it is not the album by for today, it is a bunch of recordings of christopher hutchins (i looked him up). iscmarkiemark is correct. 
look at the upload by davidson221.
it is legit."
,MODUSOPERANDl,2010-08-25T19:16Z,"It's not a fake torrent because the torrent works. I have no idea what these people are talking about. I've never an illegitimate torrent before, and I never would. All of the torrents I've ever made are working, functional, and true to the torrent info listed. I suspect most of these people saying it's not their album are For Today fans who are trying to stop people from torrenting the album because For Today is whining about their album getting leaked."
,dexter111344,2010-08-25T20:31Z,"Why are you insulting For Today, dicohimself? You don't appreciate their music? What's wrong with you? Don't get mad just because they are talented. May Jesus be with you."
,prozachxxx4,2010-08-25T20:37Z,WTF?? this is deffinately a fake. i love for today they are one of my favorite bands this is just some fag talking the entire cd. NOT FOR TODAY
,MODUSOPERANDl,2010-08-25T20:49Z,"Typical TPB trolls, claiming torrents are fake when they're NOT."
,MitchEatsToast,2010-08-25T21:58Z,I downloaded this last night. It's not real. You got my hopes up. Don't download unless you want to get bummed. FOR TODAY is MY favorite band.
,SeizeYourDays,2010-08-26T07:44Z,Dude your an asshole. What's the point in uploading fake tracks. Makes you look like a jackass. You don't screw with peoples music.
,SeizeYourDays,2010-08-26T07:46Z,Nothing but a disappointment. 
,Wake_The_Dragon,2010-08-28T11:01Z,"what a load of shit, this isnt for today at all. Ive listened to the song devastator for a start, and nowhere on there myspace is any of this the same. Im one of the biggest fans immaginable, the guy speaking people is christopher hitchens, a world renown athiest. This dude has obviously made this, i downloaded it, no songs match, the track lengths are incorrect. My personal belief is this guy made this to try and pass it off as a christian album but to promote athiesm, because thats all i is. I heard about 2 seconds of a song. Nothing more"
,Wake_The_Dragon,2010-08-28T11:03Z,"Listen im not slagging fr today off, but ive listeed to their album before on myspace and all other manner of places imaginable and i assure you friend, wherever you got this album is a fake"
,four2o,2010-08-28T19:28Z,"i think u mixed up some files or somethin cuz this is a talk show, but thanks for trying man"
,Wake_The_Dragon,2010-08-29T04:41Z,"Ths is to much of a coincidence though, it would be one thing to mix somethng up. But to mix up something religious with something promoting athiesm is to unlikeley to happen as an accident, how anyone can truly believe this is For Today is beyond me, type them in again on this site and downoad from the guy whos got 256kbs, its very good quality and is an orignal. Not some cristppher hitchens wanna be"
,The_Oceans_Breath,2010-09-02T09:49Z,"How the frill this is For Today is beyond me. Its fucking Christopher Hitchens speaking. I dont know how you make yor torrents bt you aren very good. Its one to mix things up b accident, but not this bad. As if For Today would release an album based on Christoper Hitchens promoting athiesm. As for been worried about leaking, get a life. I love music, i love getting it before its due date. As im sure everyone on the piratebay does, if we were worried about it we wouldnt use it would we logically. But all the people who are gullable enough to believe this is a genuine upload are a bunch of sheep believing this dude. At least some people spotted a fake or ''wrong'' upload"
,kddonovan01,2010-09-05T02:06Z,Not a legit copy.
,cjlalo,2010-09-14T05:43Z,"It's real simple. Only download 1 of the ""songs"" (nudge nudge...wink wink) and see for yourself. I suggest using sandboxie or something similar. You never know these days. "
,bdm2416,2010-09-17T02:15Z,fake contains right song names but is not today every track has a man talking about atheisim or something
,deadxpool,2010-09-24T04:22Z,"This is a load of CRAP! I love Jesus, and I love For today. But this torrent is NOT Them. It really is Christopher Hitchens talking. It is a plant. And pretty poor at that. I have downloaded it, Listened to it, and deleted it. It's bull, And the people telling you it is not, are leading you astray, trying to get you to listen to their crap. Go download the other if you really want For Today."
,woodie17,2010-10-04T06:25Z,"Reading the comments confused me so i went ahead and downloaded it.
Found out the hard way that it IS NOT for today's album, infact, it is a man talking for the whole album, DONT DOWNLOAD THIS."
,HeIsLove,2010-10-10T04:16Z,"Firstly attacking a bands faith with atheism is unethical so if you are trying to send a message to the viewers with honor or ethics you have ticked the failure box there. Secondly if you are relying on the knowledge and beliefs of a man like Chrisopher Hitchkins you are placing him in a high authority over your mind and you are allowing him to make these decisions for yourself. I urge anyone to seek out god, if you cant find him you tell me hes too near to miss him..."
,JT408,2010-10-11T02:55Z,why the fuck are people saying this isnt fake? what the fuck is the point of this? this is completley fake. dont download it its probably a trojan
,JT408,2010-10-11T02:55Z,"funny as shit though, i hate how metal bands try to be christian. i just think these guys are heavy as fuck"
,iamjosan,2010-11-20T23:06Z,FAKE! Do not download!
,limewar,2011-10-01T13:48Z,FAKE!
