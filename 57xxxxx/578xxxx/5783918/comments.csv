[V],sidbizkit,2011-08-05T12:09Z,"hi... i have almost completed the entire series and this is my review...

it is a series that every person who owns a guitar needs to go through.. 
it focuses on a lot of theory but extremely important nevertheless..
however this not the complete series of lessons.. it is only up to barre chords, so you will have to search for other stuff once your done with this.."
[T],ankygautam,2011-09-08T16:51Z,great 
[V],sidbizkit,2011-09-25T15:50Z,"for barre chords and onwards you can use this
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4677941

p.s. even if you download only the link mentioned above it will serve the purpose"
