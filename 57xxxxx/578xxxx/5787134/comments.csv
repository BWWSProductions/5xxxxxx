,keitherton,2011-01-14T07:41Z,"@Bujaaa - haha.  It didn't work for me either by the way, so I switched to an .avi version.  I'm afraid this torrent might be.. a cylon..."

,avoffice,2011-02-13T12:10Z,"te gek zeg, alle vier seizoenen met weinig geheugengebruik. Fantastisch.
Ik heb alle vier sez. gedownload en kijk ze nu achter elkaar. 
Goede kwaliteit goed geluid.
Je hebt tuuurlijk geen hd maar perfect beeld om het verhaal te zien.
groetejs Klaas"
,hortonofdoom,2011-04-24T14:16Z,"Last episode crashes VLC all the time. Fuck it, download somewhere else"
,Shoobox,2011-05-01T01:33Z,"S4E  15-20 ARE NOT MKV FILES AND CRASH VLC PLAYER "" CONFIRMED""
looks like he to the fast way out with encoding the most important episodes sloppy as hell."
,argonath13,2011-05-13T12:27Z,tnx a lot mate keep up the good work :)
,Rickets,2011-07-13T10:30Z,"the last two are mvb and the video stutters for me in vlc. Almost a perfect set of torrents, love you anyway. you rock."
,amnesiac_radar,2011-07-22T17:32Z,"I've burnt all to DVD and all converted perfectly. Thanks for your efforts. To all the lamers: I don't see an issue with formats, there's plenty of software out there to convert and burn to disc so why moan, some people are just ungrateful. If you want a perfect copy go and buy it, otherwise man up."
,amnesiac_radar,2011-07-22T17:55Z,"Thanks for sharing this amazing Series, I'm half way through Season 4 and don't know what to expect next."
,Squeak_is_Legend,2011-08-06T22:04Z,"just wondering, how come the last few episodes are in a different format?"
,nrthbnd06,2012-01-24T00:24Z,I downloaded season 1-4 and episodes 19 and 20 wont work it plays pieces of the sound in vlc anyone have an idea whats wrong????
,Gimpman83,2012-02-29T14:50Z,Everything but the last two episodes (the only .rmvb files) play fine in VLC. The last two have laggy video at times and when you try to skip ahead VLC crashes.
