Great software too."
,appleraja,2010-08-26T22:44Z,when i try to run the setup it goes to the website and watns me to buy 
,fatfred1,2010-08-30T00:32Z,"Appleraja you are an idiot.

Can you not read the instructions!!!

It plainly states that you must not be connected to the internet. Why can you not do what you are told?"
,friendlyfar,2010-09-19T05:42Z,"i followed the instructions given in the read me but it didn't work.  it still asked me for a serial when i tried to start recording.

i went over to serials.ws and saw an 8% rated serial and tried it:

RMCWWW.SER1ALS.WS-1445

and it worked for me.  maybe all you have to do is type gibberish in for the key and it'll work, if not use this key here."
,friendlyfar,2010-09-19T06:02Z,"oops, i never used the included keygen.  ~_~

there are also newer versions already released. 4.0.9.0 and 4.0.10.0 portable."
,mammacalo,2010-09-23T02:31Z,"The crack didnt work for me either, but I did as ""friendlyfar"" suggested and it worked like a charm !

,steve81262,2010-09-29T20:05Z,"Keygen didn't work but i also followed the suggestion from ""freindlyfar"" and it works perfectly!"
,dommels,2010-10-07T10:36Z,didn't work at me.

,spicy_puerto_rican,2010-10-18T03:12Z,"I didn't find the actual Application.exe file in the RMC File Folder so if anyone is wondering which file it is that you click on in order to patch it correctly.....

Double-click on the file named:  aliccl.dll  to patch."
,DSDO,2010-11-03T15:47Z,"I'm on Win7 64bits too, so that torrent didn't work, and the patch doesn't seem to work on the x64 version available on their site (actually it seems to modify it in a way that makes uninstallation a real nightmare).
However, the 3.02 version + patch works fine : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5011952/Replay_Media_Catcher_v3.02___Patch

Just don't forget to go in the properties of MediaCatcher.exe AND of the patch, go to compatibility and set it to Windows XP SP3.
It worked fine for me."
,createcoms,2010-11-04T06:01Z,Newest scene release for x64 users: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5931136/Applian_Technologies_Replay_Media_Catcher_v4.0.10-CRUDE
,irikimoss,2010-12-10T00:27Z,"after a couple of days it stopped working, I'm now using 3.02 on a virtual machine."
,chioke123us,2011-03-31T02:37Z,"Thank you so much if i like it i will also buy.
Keep these genius companies running !"
,kman101,2011-04-03T21:48Z,Simply press the patch button and patch the dll in the install folder if key is not working for you...!!!
,rtudd87,2011-04-11T16:23Z,"This patch / keygen does not work for me. 

1) I got an error ""The application failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem."" Had to VC++ libraries from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en before the keygen would even run.

2) Now keygen runs, I patched the aliccl.dll successfully, I run Replay Media Catcher and get: ""Replay Media Catcher has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience"". Sucks.

3) I tried the serial posted above RMCWWW.SER1ALS.WS-1445 without applying the patch and it says that the serial number has been blocked. Presumably it's doing an online check. Disconnecting the network and then trying the serial appears to work - there's an error about failure to resolve dns, then a ""success!"" box - but it does not actually work, it's still an unregistered trial version.

FFS... Stupid stupid Silverlight DRM web sites..."
,ducksoup,2011-05-19T08:57Z,"Not for the fainthearted, but working like charm for me. Helps to make a backup image first, if things do go pear shaped, like did for me first time. Also, need at least .NET Framework 3.5.

Hit generate first, as generates serial back into the system. Patch, then add serial. Only works with this or maybe next version, but will not work with the latest version.

Using it to download FLV  T.V.  So play the T.V. show through first to buffer it on the server, then close the page. Start Replay Madia Catcher in recording mode, with RTMP activated, then restart T.V. Show. Do not convert, as like to keep the original FLV to edit. Use FLV Extract (open source) to demux and My MP4Box GUI (freeware/torrent) to Mp4, for xilisoft DVD Creator or whatever.

Convert to AVI, if want to use Virtual Dub to edit, or take the bug off the screen.    "
,Kefke1990,2011-08-21T01:53Z,Works great!
,asdhokker,2011-08-21T05:58Z,"why do i get the Dr.Watson error report coming up after patching the dll and launching the app??
same with 4.3.0 dll patch from another torrent...
ive got .net framework 4.0 installed and it works fine without the patch??"
,lkadar,2011-09-10T04:48Z,It didn't work for me. Thanks anyway.
,gmeades,2011-10-18T12:22Z,Keygen no longer works.  Serial is detected as invalid.  Unable to activate.
