The Absent Minded Professor (1961) 

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054594/

A bumbling professor accidentally invents flying rubber, or ""Flubber"", an incredible material that gains energy every time it strikes a hard surface. It allows for the invention of shoes that can allow jumps of amazing heights and enables a modified Model-T to fly. Unfortunately, no one is interested in the material except for Alonzo Hawk, a corrupt businessman who wants to steal the material for himself.  ""Written by Kenneth Chisholm""
