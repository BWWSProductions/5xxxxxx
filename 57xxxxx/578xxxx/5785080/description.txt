Plot:
Elfen Lied takes place in Japan, focusing on a new strain of the human race - Diclonius,Diclonius are an evolutionary off-shoot of Humans, with physiology very similar to standard Humans. The differences are both outwardly visible and internal : Their heads have bony protrusions that resemble cat ears but are in fact a mix of bone and cartilage, possibly the result of an extremely enlarged pineal gland in their frontal lobes, which in turn grant them telekinetic abilities which emerge in the form of invisible arms referred to as vectors. These vectors have the ability to manipulate objects and are precise enough to have cutting power, and can be very destructive when unleashed. Diclonius tend to be heavily discriminated against (infants are often euthanized on the spot) by other Humans.
