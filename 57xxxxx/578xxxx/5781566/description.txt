Attempted to upload this to Demonoid, but they\\\'ve got a bug so sticking it here (hence the \\\'torrent from Demonoid\\\' file...)

This is a collection I\\\'ve put together of my favourite Beach Boys live recordings. They\\\'re from various sources (including some from torrents from here), varying sound qualities, bitrates etc, but all are at least listenable quality, and they\\\'re mostly great performances. I\\\'ve done this because there are literally hundreds of shows circulating, but many are dull or unlistenable. These are all shows that have something interesting about them.

Shows included are:
Filmore East 1971 - the famous show with the Grateful Dead that brought the band back to critical respectability.
Syracuse 1971 - Wonderful show concentrating on late-60s tracks, including a lot of Pet Sounds stuff. No Dennis.
Princeton 1971 - Not a great quality recording, but they play almost all the Surf\\\'s Up album. The version of Lookin\\\' At Tomorrow here is seriously astonishing.
NYSU Albany 1972 - 1972 is generally considered the best year the Beach Boys ever had as a live act. This is one of the only shows they did with Blondie & Ricky *and* Bruce in the band.
Munich 1972 - Another 1972 show. Not great recording quality, but includes lots of unusual songs including Dennis\\\' unreleased I\\\'ve Got A Friend.
Boston 1972 - Not a great quality recording, and an annoying audience who only want the hits, but probably the best setlist they did in the 1970s, including Wonderful, Surf\\\'s Up, Only With You and Cuddle Up
Carnegie Hall 1972 By far the best quality recording of these 70s shows, and a pretty great setlist to boot.
Philadelphia 1980 - from the Keepin\\\' The Summer Alive tour, without Dennis but with Brian (who\\\'s not in great voice). Contains a lot of KTSA songs that they only played this year.
Hammersmith Odeon 1970 Not brilliant sound quality, but a lovely show consisting almost entirely of gentle post-Pet Sounds material, with Carl and Al in especially fine voice.
Central Park 1977 From the Love You tour, with the five original band members. 1977 was the last year when they would regularly mix new songs, \\\'arty\\\' stuff and older hits, before they became an oldies show.
Paramount Theatre 1993 Plus Rehearsals In 1993 the Beach Boys did extended shows, with a half-hour acoustic set of rarities, because they were promoting the box set. This is a soundboard recording of one of those shows, plus an absolutely astonishing recording of a rehearsal (without Mike Love) of the rarities. Best sound quality of any of these, and the rehearsals are staggering.
Manchester Apollo 2008 A show by Mike Love, Bruce Johnston and original Beach Boy David Marks, reunited for a month-long tour of the UK. Poor sound quality, but an astonishingly good set, especially the acoustic Til I Die and All This Is That.
Seattle 1977 A better 1977 show than Central Park, with Brian in good voice, but annoyingly the starts of two songs are missing.
\\\"Beachago\\\" 1975 The Beach Boys\\\' section of a show from a double-header tour where the BBs and Chicago performed together, often swapping lead vocals with each other.
Cork On The Ocean Two soundboard recordings of Brian Wilson\\\'s 2001 tour supporting Paul Simon. Still the best-quality Brian solo recordings I\\\'ve heard.
Glasgow 2004 Mike & Bruce\\\'s touring \\\'Beach Boys\\\' actually managed to top Brian\\\'s band in their 2004 and 2008 UK tours. While this show is marred by Mike Kowalski\\\'s poor drumming, the 50+ song setlist including Kiss Me Baby, Til I Die, You Still Believe In Me, Please Let Me Wonder and All This Is That can\\\'t be beaten.
Tampa 1973 Many people\\\'s very favourite Beach Boys concert of all time, featuring many songs from the Holland album
Milwaulkee 1974 Another pretty good-quality early 70s one, featuring lots of the Holland album.
and Nassau 1973 Another extremely good quality Holland-era show.
