Who says romance is dead?

Spirited is a romantic look at life and love after death with a rock â€˜nâ€™ roll twist.

From the producers of Love My Way, Spirited is a blackly funny exploration of love, death and life seen through the lives of a group of people who are extreme, complicated and unique.

The eight episode, escapist and romantic drama series will take richly drawn characters through situations and storylines that are anything but predictable. This is a show with a lightness of touch and yet it also encompasses the absurdity of modern dentistry, explores the curious world of parenting, celebrates the punk aesthetic and depicts a unique vision of the spirit world.
