|Notes\_________________________________________________________________________
I apologize for releasing this with FLVs instead of WMVs, but it seems like WMVs
for those three movies don't exist.  The rest of the movies are all downloaded
straight from VALVe's various servers and of the highest available quality.

To play the FLVs, you'll need to download a FLV player.  Google is your friend.
