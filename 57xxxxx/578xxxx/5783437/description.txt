Evolution is a collection of the best remixes i've produced over the past 10 years. The style progresses from simple sample house tracks, to more complicated synth tracks. There is a clear difference between the quality of the mixes and i'll admit Disc 2 definitely the best, but it shows the evolution of me as a producer and i'm proud of all of 'em! I think I had more fun on the simple ones anyway ;)

All tracks recorded in 320kbps LAME mp3
Some tracks (specifically from disc 1) have been remastered from mono.
