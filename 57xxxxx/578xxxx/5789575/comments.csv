[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-26T01:39Z,"Here is a little more Nfo about the show - 

Neal Caffrey is a con-man who was captured after a three-year game of cat and mouse. With three months left while serving a four-year sentence, he escapes from a maximum security federal prison to find Kate, his ex-girlfriend. Peter Burke, the FBI agent who captured Caffrey, catches him again. This time, Caffrey gives Burke information about evidence in another case; however, this information comes with a price: Burke must have a meeting with Caffrey. At this meeting, Caffrey proposes a deal: he will help Burke catch other criminals as part of a work-release program. Burke agrees, after some hesitation.
Within a day of being released from prison, Caffrey already lives in one of the most expensive houses in Manhattan, after persuading an elderly widow to rent him her guest room. After catching the elusive Dutchman, Caffrey has proven to Burke that he will help him, and that he will not try to escape again. However, at the same time, Caffrey is still looking for Kate, whom he believes is in trouble."

You should be more respectful to Day_Walker   He takes a considerate amount of time out of his day to give you tv shows, porn movies etc.

No need to be rude or demanding. He either gets it and posts it or he doesnt...."
