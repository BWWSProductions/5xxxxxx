IMAGiNE NOTES

SOURCES:
VIDEO: The Twilight Saga Eclipse DVDSCR DVDR ................... Thanks to a special friend :)
AUDIO: The Twilight Saga Eclipse DVDSCR DVDR ................... Thanks to a special friend :)

Well heres our fixed up version with the ending intact. We had to rerip the vobs we were sent and done our normal stuff, changing the brightness, contrast, rgb colours, sharpness etc...

Also we've had to crop this top and bottom due to black borders but also more at the bottom to remove the counter and also two lots of ID tags. Didn't need to crop too much off the bottom though to hide these as most were on the borders.

The video itself does contain a message saying that this source as had the persons ID added to this file ... well for this we have left it as it was already ripped with it in and spread across several public and private sites so ... and also we don't think that will be the way to track the person this came from ... also a big blur in the middle of the screen would look horrible.

Now our last release of this....hands up, we fooked up and made a mistake so sorry for that.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
