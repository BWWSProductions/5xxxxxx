,croise,2010-08-28T15:18Z,"JUST TO CONFIRM!
The game IS working fine! No health problems in Chapter 2. Movies/trailers are NOT removed so far. :) 
 One thing for ATI cards users - you might get an error like ""PhysX system will be installed"" and this won't let you start the game.
 I solved it by installing the latest PhysX system from here:  
http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.10.0513-driver.html.

Thank you Shroo."

Go to

C:\Users\yourAccountUserName\AppData\Local\2K Games\Mafia II\Saves

and open file “videoconfig” with notepad and change all 1′s to zeroes (0′s).

Within that file you will find something like:

Change it to:

,Cryptologist,2010-09-19T16:21Z,"OK here's the lowdown for any doubters - 

This works, I've been playing it and it's the full experience... the only sign of compression is that the FMV videos (namely the intro and a few other key parts) are a bit lower quality than you'd expect. There are few of these videos really, and the rest of the cutscenes/dialogue etc. are done in the game's engine. It's a worthy compromise considering the amazing filesize.

Also, if anyone gets trouble running the 'tptb' loader in the rar file, just go straight to the setup file instead and it should work."
