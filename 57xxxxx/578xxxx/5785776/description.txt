IMAGiNE NOTES

SOURCES:
VIDEO:The Karate Kid 2010 PROPER REPACK 1080p BluRay x264-METiS .....  Thanks
AUDIO:The Karate Kid 2010 PROPER REPACK 1080p BluRay x264-METiS .....  Thanks

Right this is just a straight forward rip of the 1080p x264 release ... For this we did a script that cropped, resized, sharpness, white balance ...
oh also we hardcoded the 84 lines of english subs for when they are needed.
Also we needed to demux and encode the DTS audio track to a 5.1 AC3 file and then remux back to our rip afterwards :)

***Enjoy this nice UNCUT remake...FULL VERSION...2h 20mn :)***
