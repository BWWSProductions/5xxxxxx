Dissecting the conflicting views of the golden age of pirates - as romanticized villains on one hand and genuine social rebels on the other - this fascinating chronicle explores the political and cultural significance of these nomadic outlaws by examining a wide range of ethnographical, sociological, and philosophical standards. 
The meanings of race, gender, sexuality, and disability in pirate communities are analyzed and contextualized, as are the pirates' forms of organization, economy, and ethics. 
Going beyond simple swashbuckling adventures, the examination also discusses the pirates' self-organization, the internal make-up of the crews, and their early-1700s philosophiesâ€”all of which help explain who they were and what they truly wanted. Asserting that pirates came in all shapes, sexes, and sizes, this engaging study ultimately portrays pirates not just as mere thieves and killers but as radical activists with their own society and moral code fighting against an empire.

â€œLife Under the Jolly Roger will appeal to anyone interested in pirates
and radical practice. It brings the golden age of piracy to life and shows
us the link to contemporary radical politics. I recommend this book to
those who identify with pirates and seek a well-reasoned analysis of their
legacy.â€â€”Luis A. Fernandez, author of Policing Dissent
â€œPiracy is as relevant in todayÊ¼s world as it ever was, and if you want to
understand why it happens and what it really means, this is the book to
start with. While modern-day robber barons give pirating a bad name,
this important book restores the balance through a lively and provocative
narrative. Definitely one to read, and to treasure!â€â€”Randall Amster,
professor of Peace Studies at Prescott College, Arizona
