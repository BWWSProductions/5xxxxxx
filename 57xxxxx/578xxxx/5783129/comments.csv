,deathtrooper30,2010-08-22T15:39Z,"""play the full map, but without missions""

Are you guys even serious? You know what that sounds like.....

What a freaking waste of time this would be! I suggest you ppl wait on something from Reloaded or perhaps Razor cause this amateur shit is for the birds! "
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-08-22T15:44Z,@deathtrooper30 drama queen stop crying until real crack gets release its only option for those who cant wait getting a teats of this game... now please stop crying!
,[RED-X]JINX,2010-08-22T15:51Z,"Yeah, this is a waste... Just wait for the real deal -.-"
,Praekiller,2010-08-22T15:55Z,You can do missions but only further then the demo mission. So you start at chapter 10 instead of chapter 1. And besides that you dont have a map so you dont have navigation. But you can do missions and you can discover the whole map.
,shauwy,2010-08-22T16:06Z,ho thanx for this stun!!! hurry to found the working crack ;)
,shauwy,2010-08-22T16:23Z,"stun what ""unpack everything with phoenix"" i don't know utilised phoenix can you explain please thanx"
,Nordlander001,2010-08-22T16:24Z,"This is just fuckt up name. Please mention [Demo]Crack fixed etc. 

This is just confusing!"
,Jahkaka,2010-08-22T17:08Z,Hey. Could anyone post the link for the Phoenix program? I googled it but couldn`t find anything. Thanks!
,shauwy,2010-08-22T17:12Z,"stun can you help me when i unpack i have a error message from phoenix "" unsupported registry entry tape dword "" please thnx"
,Jahkaka,2010-08-22T17:15Z,"Oh. Nevermind, sorry. Stupid question."
,shauwy,2010-08-22T17:32Z,"stun can you help me? when i unpack with phoenix i have a error message ""unsupported registry entry tape dword"" thanx"
,justcause28,2010-08-22T18:06Z,"This crack does indeed unlock the game with missions but there is no map so you have to guess where you are going. Also you start later in the game,

@Nordlander001 : this is not a demo unlocker. This unlocks the full game. The menu's are still from the demo though.."
,frost420,2010-08-22T20:55Z,"I can get into the game, start the mission (starts at level 10), but after I walk around or drive around for say, 20 seconds, game will crash to desktop. Any ideas? Running Win7/x64 Ultimate, latest NVIDIA drivers."
,justcause28,2010-08-22T21:02Z,So tell me. If it doesnt unlock anything. Why is it that its possible to free roam the city and do missions that we werent to do in the demo? Go on wise guy.
,cryfreedom66,2010-08-22T22:09Z,Mine crashes after about 20 seconds as well...any ideas?
,xboXtrme,2010-08-23T00:23Z,"works fine, but i cant see the map :("
,deathtrooper30,2010-08-23T00:45Z,Amateur crack causing chaos amongst the dumb asses... hmm who would have thought! 
,Flitskikker1337,2010-08-23T01:45Z,"Can get in the game, but it keeps stuck at the Loading screen."
,kevmeister95,2010-08-23T03:54Z,"there are major changes coming to the pirate-""landscape"" because of ACTA.  pirate-bay is already affected, several other 'pirate'-related websites as well.  the people that take the time to help other people play a game (without paying the the marketer's inflated price) should be congratulated and thanked for their efforts.  they might not always find a perfect solution but they are at least TRYING to help the rest of us who aren't tech-savvy.  even if I never play or use the games they have provided for the rest of us; I will at least let them know their efforts are appreciated...so ease off the flaming and sniping.  some of the comments are uncalled-for and callous...just a thought"
,OldBear69,2010-08-23T10:14Z,"Same problems that have RasOrder_Cmdr_Judah, after launching the game, come the menu ( the demo one ), click on start then comes the black screen then the desktop.

I did all that needed : 
- Unpack with phoenix ( no problem ) 
- Delete the files from the demo
- Put all unpacked files from full game in the demo folders
- Copy the crack
- And then the mission scripts.

But still, he don't work...
Please, help. Thank's."
,MulliganM,2010-08-23T10:17Z,"The crack atm is holding up some crazy error running under Win's 7 64 bit.

Like stated in the posting this crack is right off the demo.exe just with the full game scripts/files it was a easy/half ass by pass to give the true games a peace of action before the full crack..

When I mean half ass I mean that it was done peer off the fact to left people play full game files under demo script.. If your having trouble playing or installing the game I would state just to wait tell later today or tomorrow for crack. It painful I know but we all have wait!"
,MulliganM,2010-08-23T10:22Z,"Sorry for bad gramma/spelling english not my first language.

Win's Vista 32 bit (works)
Win's 7 32 bit (Works)
Win's 7 64 bit (Having problems)"
,ViaDomus325,2010-08-23T10:35Z,look there are 4 days and mafia 2 will comeout ok ? probably after a few days it wil be cracked ..why you download this shit ?
,OldBear69,2010-08-23T10:49Z,"Hai MulliganM, well i'm on Vista but still don't work. 
I don't really know what else i can try, guess i'll have to wait couple hours. It's painfull but well, it's not like if i have the choices.

,Angerfist_DJ,2010-08-23T15:20Z,"it's NOT working.

,deathtrooper30,2010-08-23T19:08Z,"@Knaster
