,Laddyy,2010-08-25T17:14Z,"Ok, I've also been waiting for some time for this one:) I ended up downloading what I thought would be 720p bluray (also here on pb), but it was fake, so would be nice if someone as soon as possible could confirm if this is real or not. Thank you."
,NAHOM1974,2010-08-25T17:32Z,Thank MAN
,sybex2010,2010-08-25T17:54Z,"@Laddyy, It's real...next time check the little colored skulls next to the uploaders name.  "

,Laddyy,2010-08-25T18:01Z,"Good to know:) Yeah, well the other guy, he also had a skull, ""trusted"" or something, but not as trusted as a VIP, I guess? :P"
,720plover,2010-08-25T19:47Z,"I hope this is real, I had the exact same problem as Laddyy"
[V],poppedtart,2010-08-25T20:09Z,if its not real then AiTB would be very embarrassed.

,banyan007,2010-08-26T08:20Z,WTF i'm downloading 6kb/s.....WHY
,tbone3181,2010-08-26T23:03Z,"banyan007, if you are going to make pointless comments, try not to do it THREE times. Makes u look even more stupid. And to answer your pointless question, its simple - 10 x leechers than seeders = low speed"
,niccolom,2010-08-26T23:09Z,This MKV does not work on my PC or my WDTV.......
,TheChosen1_,2010-08-26T23:48Z,Will wait for 1080p release...But thx anyway :)
,BundD,2010-08-27T03:12Z,"nice thanx

@niccolom

download VLC"
[V],poppedtart,2010-08-27T04:30Z,This release uses header compression for both the audio and video tracks.  If this doesn't play for you then you will need to remux it using mkvmerge and disable header compression or use mkwdclean to do this for you.
,saeen,2010-08-27T16:56Z,Man I m stuck at 99.4% since yesterday :(
,niccolom,2010-08-27T21:55Z,poppedtart: How to I remove it in mkvmerge... Everything in greyed out and I am unable to change any of the options to remove remux it properly....
,niccolom,2010-08-27T22:49Z,also when i use mkwdclean is bombs out at 28% on two different machines.... aaahhhhh
,partiallove,2010-08-28T00:09Z,Some body Please Seed...Many are there but no is F seeding at all...
,AskMeHowYouToCanSayFU,2010-08-28T00:49Z,"Anyone know what Happened to 3Li? I had 3Lis page up a few hours ago and now its gone entirely like as if 3Li was never here and he/she had like 5 pages of MOVIES-HIRES links.

Anyone know anything?"
,TheChosen1_,2010-08-28T11:31Z,"@ AskMeHowYouToCanSayFU 

O My God man...There are just 4 releases of him when i search it in here...Really, it looks something wrong with 3Li's account..."
,Akarsh07,2010-08-28T16:46Z,"Wow., i was waitin for this torrent from 3months.. :)

[V],Team_xRG,2010-08-29T10:53Z,"search 3li on any other site

,touchupguys1980,2010-08-29T11:23Z,cant get to work with mkv2vob any thoughts
,Mahku94,2010-08-29T14:23Z,how can i watch this on ps3?
,charlie_parker,2010-08-29T21:04Z,Please seed..... I'm stuck at 86 percent and have now uploaded more of the file than I have downloaded.  Don't be shisty share!!!!
,adamj121212,2010-08-29T22:00Z,"Ok, I've sussed it.  This doesn't work with mkv2vob.  Using the other guys suggestion which wasn't very clear I've got it to accept it.  Download mkvmergeGUI, when you add the file you'll need to click on the added file to get the options working (otherwise they're greyed out like mentioned by other guy).  So click on prince of persia video and then on the extra options tab click on compression, scroll to none.  Click on Prince of persia audio, extra options, compression scroll to none then use merge tab at top.  It'll create another mkv file with (1) after the title.  Chuck that in mkv2vob an roberts your mothers brother!"
,jwynne,2010-08-29T22:28Z,quality is excellent thanx for the up  great work AiTB 
,IDManz,2010-08-30T12:42Z,i did it the way u said adamj121212.. and it worked quality is good too but the audio is out of sync? how to fix dat? and is there a fps to specify?
,IDManz,2010-08-30T22:48Z,hey finally it worked... quality is 10/10 Good Job AiTB keep it up...
,war59312,2010-08-31T02:53Z,"V: 10
A: 9.5
M: 7.5

Decent movie. Never would have (never did) paid to see in Theaters though."
,bchai1247,2010-08-31T15:45Z,"I can't get it to work with VLC player, audio is ok, but video is sometimes scrambled and with frames missing.
Anyone?"
,onegemini77,2010-09-03T04:28Z,"Downloaded this file. It caused my windows explorer to go haywire. I was unable to delete. Even though I never ran it, it would say the program was being run by windows explorer and not allow it to be deleted. I had to use UltraExplorer and have it opened when I ended the task of Windows explorer in order to remove.

Do not trust this download!!"
,onegemini77,2010-09-03T04:36Z,"I am not sure why others may not have had issues with this. However this download screws with the computer and I would not trust it.

I could not rename the folder or delete it. When I tried it would say the program is already running in Windows Explorer. I had not started the file or anything to play it.

It even caused my windows explorer to not load up properly. I had to get UltraExplorer to move through my computer folders.

The only way I was able to remove this file was by opening Ultra Explorer. Then using task manager I ended the process for Windows Explorer. This closed down my desktop, except for the UltraExplorer I already had running. This then allowed me to delete the folder it was in.

I cut and paste my downloads from a download file on my drive to a network drive. That is how I found out the file could not be deleted. I highly recommend using a different torrent and not trusting Torrents by AiTB."
,mkluv,2010-09-03T05:39Z,"is it just me or does the dialog quality sounds really bad? other than that, excellent rip!"
,autobotHD,2010-09-03T10:23Z,So many idiots here...Dammm
,caliwillbemine,2010-09-05T16:45Z,This movie is a waste of time. Unless you're a preteen I guess.
,juap,2010-09-07T02:27Z,"This is NOT DTS audio... I know that because i watch all my movies with the Home Theather connected to my macbook via fibre optic and i can see when DTS is present in my downloaded movies.
!!!No es audio DTS¡¡¡"
,Pasco5913,2010-09-09T13:38Z,I opened it with KMPlayer and.... nothing happened.... Does anyone know why???
,stanlyfl6,2010-09-09T15:23Z,great torrent v9/a9
,Pasco5913,2010-09-10T12:25Z,Can anyone write down the steps of how we use the mkvmerge for this torrent??
,crespo306,2010-09-20T22:50Z,EVERYONE LOOK HERE THERE IS NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANY KIND OF SPEACIAL VIDEO PLAYER AT ALL. IF YOU JUST UPDATE YOUR CODECS ON YOUR COMPUTER IT WILL GIVE YOU THE CODEC TO PLAY BLUERAY QUALITY VIDEOS OF YOUR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER OR ANY OTHER ONE THAT'S ALREADY INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER.
,AtotehZ,2010-09-25T15:50Z,"it would be really epic if torrent programs could make use of the seeders they have...

i've downloaded 20% and get 200-250kb/sec while uploading 100kb/sec... I can seed almost 3mbyte/sec more... doing that and then getting a little more in return would be a good deal."
,n8schicht,2010-10-08T05:13Z,"@juap: Shut the fuck up, of course it's DTS! Maybe you should put that Apple shit to trash and buy yourself some REAL computer that can deal with DTS, muahahaha"
,charlie_boy,2010-10-19T17:16Z,why this thing does not play on my apacer hd media player?
,EndGamer,2010-12-10T05:47Z,holy shit this is over 6 gigs i am grateful and expect great things ;)
,born2b,2010-12-21T16:14Z,Thanks! nice 1! 
,Thomps6o,2011-01-24T16:09Z,"Maybe someone can help me out here....sometimes when I download movies such as this one, I cannot do anything with it....I am trying to watch it on my big screen TV, but when I go to put it on a external hard drive it says ""not enough free disk space"" yet I have 596 GB left on the drive, and it won't let me put a 6 GB file on it. I have had this problem before, it usually happens with HD movies. And, no it isn't just my computer, I have tested this theory. So what I am having to do is put the file through HandBrake and do a damn 20 something hour re-encode just so I can get it off the computer. Its like I have to tell the file what size it is, because even though it says it 6 GB, it really doesn't know. The file thinks it is an infinite number of GBs."

,Thomps6o,2011-01-24T16:50Z,Sorry for double posting....and then triple posting to apologize for the double post.
,alexvicious,2011-02-08T18:17Z,@Thomps6o: Most probably your external hard drive is formatted to FAT32 file system and cannot support files larger than 2GB. Re-format it to NTFS and you should be ok (right click on the hard drive's icon and select format with the NTFS enabled). You will have to take a back up first. 
,hsv4lyf,2011-03-19T22:13Z,"This file makes windows explorer hang as soon as you open the folder it's in, I tried to remux with mkv2vob and it makes tsmuxer.exe crash, is there a way around this at all? The movie plays fine in vlc though would much prefer to watch it on ps3"
