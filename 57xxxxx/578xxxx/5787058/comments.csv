,waif68,2011-07-23T16:41Z,@Kaldea Don't know why support & seeders have declined so much. SAD! I've pulled several of my uploads because no one would seed. Thanx 2 y'all for support.
,TheDutch888,2011-07-30T13:13Z,"waht i must do with the PBP file? i just pasted it into folder ISO. Taht is my first psx eboot, so i'm a total noob. How can i get it to work?"
,Danisl,2011-08-03T19:56Z,"@TheDutch888
your doing it wrong! You must go to /PSP/GAME/ and the create a folder withing /GAME/ called ffVII (or whatever) and put the EBOOT there. It wont do shit on ISO folder"
