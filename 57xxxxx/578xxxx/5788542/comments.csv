,Whit3_Addict,2010-09-29T13:27Z,i am dwloading this just for the first comment. hope its not going to be any trouble!
,Prayera,2010-10-09T23:16Z,"Great upload. Works perfectly, thanx a lot! "
,Artedin,2010-10-10T23:39Z,"Help!! the installation was a success but when i click play it tells me to ""insert the original disc instead of a backup"" what should i do?? help!"
,RuneRifle,2010-10-10T23:54Z,"are you sure you've cracked it and also make sure you haven't mounted it anymore. It should work. If it doesn't, you obviously have done something wrong.

If you can't get it to work, reinstall, and follow the steps in the nfo file again."
,acb21792,2010-10-15T02:43Z,ok i'm having a problem and can't seem to fix it. it starts to install and during the middle of it a message pops up asking me to put the disc in? I'm confused its mounted fine just wont install all the way
,RuneRifle,2010-10-15T19:30Z,Mount the other one and tell the install to use that disc. That will work
,apollo777,2010-10-18T05:23Z,"Totally legit, worked great for me. "
,CyrusDaVyrus,2010-11-05T19:33Z,there is or was no crack folder in the download got past the install and now i cant play due to a missing crack folder LOL is there just a crack upload somewhere someone can help me with
,RuneRifle,2010-11-07T13:12Z,"After extracting there should be 3 files, the iso, the nfo and the crack folder. There must have been an error with the download, run a check again en let it finish, see if you've got the crack then"
,cojobesta,2010-12-06T14:16Z,"can't see my cursor, otherwise works fine, win7 x64"

,Cgoff87,2011-02-23T05:22Z,"This one didn't work for me, it kept saying it was missing a component to directx 9, and I'm running on Dx11 so that shouldn't make sense, but possibly it's missing a game update, and also these two files were missing during installation,
DP5 BuildingFlavorText.xml
Orwellian Future.xml

Hash double checked as well...

but overall because of the Dx9 problem it will not start... And I have all the components...

I'm going to try to download the recommended torrent above by hvr, it says its precracked.


Oh the anticipation..."
,g0d11c3,2011-02-26T03:29Z,"Why do people spend there time doing the nice description things. Well, its working, it looks awesome"
,didii,2011-03-09T08:34Z,"Working fine for me :)

@cojobesta: there is an option for turning the cursor of the game to the default windows mouse (named ""turn of coloured mouse"" or something). Try to navigate to that option.

Thx for the upload!"

,Schredder247,2012-04-16T12:46Z,could some one plz seed? plus could someone  post how to do this I only had three files at the start and after i installed it it kept asking for a disc to be inserted. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling but now its taking FOREVER to download! could someone tell me what I've done wrong and what I need to do?!
