,jehosefatz,2011-01-17T08:38Z,"Video and audio quality is great, and I didn't see any watermarks."
,LucyWoof,2011-07-14T02:36Z,"thanks, excellent quality and a small file size!"
,whatwhatinthewhere,2011-10-19T07:39Z,"video is watermarked at 30"" and again closer to the end and is in a stupid format (.mkv). hopefully the FXG guys will put up a better version soon"
,Krenzathal,2012-01-01T22:25Z,"I've hunted high and low for this film and there is not one torrent out there that isn't hard coded with subs or in a different language.

It's terrible that you can't get a film in it's original format!

.srt files are wonderful things, it gives people choice. Use them!
"
,miniiiiiiiiii,2012-04-23T13:40Z,"this is a perfect copy. i can get it full screen on my 51"" tv, its an mkv file and there is no watermark 4 minutes in?"
,slow-trot,2012-05-15T00:12Z,"There is a watermark at 1hr 46min 43sec to 1hr 47min 03 sec, for a 20 sec duration.  Seems like he does put watermark on everyone of his torrents, but towards the end and not very long.  So if anyone wants a movie that totally without any watermark, then this uploader isn't for you.  Your choice."
