	 When a group of crazy college geniuses put their heads together, almost 
	 anything can happen. Hold on for a freewheeling, uproarious look at just 
	 how much mischief a bunch of high-IQers can concoct. Chris (Val Kilmer) 
	 is the top brain who just wants to party, Mitch (Gabe Jarret) is the 
	 16-year-old whiz kid, and Lazlo (Jonathan Gries), America's number one 
	 brain, literally lives in a world of his own ... Chris' closet. Supposedly 
	 hard at work on a lab project, they still find time to turn the dorm into 
	 an ice-skating rink, dismantle a nerd's car and reassemble it in his room, 
	 and throw a beach party in the auditorium complete with a lagoon and 
	 bikini-clad beauties. When the geniuses discover that their unscrupulous 
	 mentor Professor Hathaway (William Atherton) has had them working on a 
	 secret weapon for the military, they plot an elaborate revenge. Their plan 
	 culminates in an incredible scheme that outsmarts the military and 
	 convinces the professor that it doesn't pay to fool with a REAL GENIUS!
