I think I have All the Time, All the Time, All the Time on cassette, but haven't the equipment or expertise to transfer it."
[V],Kitlope,2010-08-24T18:43Z,"no worries, ripping from cassette is a time consuming experience and the sound more often than not can be brutal.

Do a search with my name and you'll find tons of Canadian music , some of it being a bit rare to find.

Looking forward to more Canadiana!"
