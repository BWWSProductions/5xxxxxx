,srsguy,2010-08-26T02:23Z,disregard my earlier comment. added volume in VLC forgetting that it adds noise. Thanks for the torrent.
,g8aso,2010-08-26T09:53Z,"The audio quality is not that great because it's only in joint stereo, so lack of seperation and high frequencies as it's not proper stereo.

Has to be in Dual Channel (Dual Stereo) for proper left and right with full frequency range sound."
