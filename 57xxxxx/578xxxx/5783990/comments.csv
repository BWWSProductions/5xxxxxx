,veerenski,2010-08-23T00:38Z,"Keep seeding it even if there are no downloaders. We need 20 seeders per torrent. The reasoning for it is explained in other Osho torrents withing the last few days.

If we have Osho torrents with 2 seeds or less, it is no good. It means you will not be able to download it within minutes. It may take you hours or days.

Seeding does not cost you anything. Torrent program takes very little of your CPU time and your upload speed does not affect your download or web browsing speed more or less.

Look at Osho torrents and whenever you not enough seeders, seed it. That will be your ""thank you"" for all the work that has been done to make sure you have the best of the best, the best there is.

Secondly, Osho wanted to have a communication system so the Sannyasins could find one another, which is exactly what I was thinking of. If any of you have any technical expertise, ideas, suggestions, chip in. Do not be shy and do not worry about how great your expertise is. The most important thing is your desire and intent. The rest we can take care of.

Also, Osho wanted the radio and so I did. What I have seen around is no good.

So...

If you are a graphic designer, an artist, broadcast or sound engineer, an anchor, a researcher or simply an Osho lover, raise your voice. We can do PLENTY of things...

Osho radio has to be on line 24 hrs. We have enouigh of a playlist material. All we need is people to be available on a 24 hrs./day basis for real time broadcasting, program design and things like that.

As far as Osho connection goes, there are several ways to go. We do have a powerful search engine. But some technical details need to be discussed and feedback is necessary. There is just too much work to get it all done on a top notch level.
"
,veerenski,2010-08-23T02:14Z,"We are in a pretty good shape as far as seeding goes. But there are a couple of Osho torrents that only have 3 seeders. Please take care of it.

If you do not feel like saying anything here and would like to communicate via private email messages, that is fine, no problem. Send your email to: preciseinfo@mail.ru.

I am willing to take up a project Osho was talking about, The Academy of Arts and Sciences. I am the one to do it. If that Japanese guy is still around, drop me a line and we'll see what we can do and I am confident enough to say what we can do is better than...

Anyway, please make sure ALL the Osho Remastered and Fluctuation Meditation torrents are seeded on the cream of the crop level.

Enjoy the trip. Me and Osho pays."

When Vidya, who would make anyone shake or Sheela would see me, they'd keep their tail down, WAY down, if you comprehend who Sheela is.

Now, we used to hang out in Jesus Grove, the place you better avoid at all cost for all sorts of reasons.

So...

,veerenski,2010-08-24T08:08Z,"Projects for The Academy Of Arts And Sciences:

1) Information Theory
This is not in the formal sense as presented by Shannon. It is about presenting the information in the most conductive way regardless of what kind of information it is. This is one of the most critical things in the modern world and we do have an idea of the major issues involved. It is not about ""AI"" and symbolic processing.

2) New World Order issues
This is WAY too big to even begin to describe here. But it CAN be handled. We know where to go and what to look for and how to present the information.

3) Information restoration and preservation
This is a big one.

Basically, there is no interest in doing the same thing as plenty of universities do. They already do it and good luck with that. Sorry, we are not interested.

4) Sane art
This has been covered by Gregory Klimov and Osho. Long subject, but there IS something authentic and life-affirming about it and that is what we are interested in.

What we ARE interested is Consciousness as far as Science and Art go."

But you did not listen.

You just kept producing the same kind of bullshit new age ""music"", which isn't really a music, but a broken record. Utterly dead, meaning nothing, signifying nothing.

Would you listen now?

The Fluctuations Meditations were designed for you to hear the real music one day. Who knows, may be there IS a way to get all that wax out of your ears...

Otherwise, what is music? Can you tell me?

Did you notice that Osho musicians are on the second plane compared to world ethnic musicians in the Fluctuation Meditations? Listen again. It is all there. It is a message for you."
,veerenski,2010-08-24T16:58Z,"Dear Osho musicians,

The REAL music is in the gaps between the sounds and not in all that fancy noise you make you call music. And please do not abuse the ""bird calls"" aspect.

Osho specifically excluded his best musician for that. He know who he is.

Yes, I know, there ARE a couple of REAL musicians of Osho. One of them is Nivedano, and that is the only one I care to mention. There are a couple of more.

Look, donkeys, I laughet at you, Rajen, in Berkely, California when you sat inside of a circle of about 20 people ""giving them your blessings"".
You were staring into my eyes, which is an ocean, and I was looking at you like a donkey ass, a total zombie. I kept laughing and laughing and laughing into your face, but you, idiot, did not even realize what is REALLY going on with your ""group"" trip. So pathetic you ego is.

You, Tirtha, avoided me in Poona. I was told that you are the most powerful person around besides Osho. Anyone, who books a personal session with you is guaranteed to be totally annihilated. So I booked a session with you and paid for it top dollar. But I was told you are sick.
Then, I spoke to you once on the Ranch, in Edison department, where you were fixing watches or doing something as equivalently stoopid. I cam to your desk and saw the crystal and so I asked ""what is this""? And you, all of a sudden, flared up and came alive and started telling me all sorts of bullshit stories about the ""power of crystals"". I could not believe this. I thought this man is mad. He belongs to a mental institution. He is as close to the real master as it gets and he still needs some ""crystal power"". For what? What are you going to do with it?
Now, almost 30 years passed. Tell me, what that ""crystal power"" told you or provided you? Anything to excite the balls of my dead mosquito?

And now you, suckers, are running all sorts of spiritual operations, feeding the clueless and gullible all sorts of spiritual bullshit.

And I say: disgrace is a compliment to you.

You, being utter nobodies, are simply capitalizing on his work and his name and all you have to ""teach"" is utter bullshit, signifying nothing, UTTER nothing. You WERE empty before you came to him and you ARE empty.

And I mean ALL of you, ""great spiritual teachers"", which is nothing more than this ugly ""new age"" slum.

I shall speak about Sheela separately. You are not even in the same level.

"
,veerenski,2010-08-25T11:03Z,"And now it is time to totally annihilate this Osho empire, created by ZioNazis after Sheela and laughing at him and his work.

They converted Osho into business. Some kind of ""resort"" in Poona. They destroyed the samadhi and created a pub in its place selling hard alcohol from what I have heard.

You pay something like $7000 to spend a few days in that ""resort"" of theirs, disgusting as it gets.

All fake. Nothing more than humiliation and disgust, and arrogant insult to what Osho is.

It started on the Ranch in Oregon when Sheela has left with ""the hollywood gang"". Slowly, slowly, take took over the whole thing and converted it into a puppet theater with their ""therapies"" and all sorts of utter bullshit, which is nothing more than a money making operation.

I do not have much information on it. I just reviewed a few pieces of information. But, from what I have seen, it is just exactly the same as Osho said: ""When I am gone, the whole thing is dead"".

They are just arrogantly laughing at him, his work and building their sand castles on a sea shore, not even realizing it will be all washed out with the fist big wave.

All these nobodies and parasites forever do the same thing, never having enough. They need to suck your blood and zombify you, converting you into biorobots. And they even have guts to call themselves an elite.

What a joke!!!

,veerenski,2010-08-25T11:25Z,"To Sheela:

Look baby. The way you have it is no good.

I have seen your video interview about Osho.
The first thing that came into my mind is you telling that donkey reporter that Osho was somehow ""not right"" by changing his name from Bhagwan to Osho. You said: ""whatever happened in Oregon, happened. There is no need to totally run away from it and change your name"". This is not a literal quote.

Now, WHO ARE you to say what HE ""should"" have done and whether he ""should"" or ""should not"" change his name? What if you wish to call yourself a Funky Witch? Who am I to question it?

Then, you sit there with a pious face with all the Osho pictures behind you taking up all the wall space and talk about blah, blah, blah.

Yes, I do admit you DID learn something from him, and that is silence. I did not see it in your eyes before. But WHERE is it coming from?
Well, from Osho, you funky bitch.
You simply have NOTHING else of your own. Every little thing you have and you can possibly claim is that, which came from Osho. Beyond it, you are just a total nothingness, utterly uninteresting to anyone.

So, you dropped the whole thing at the ranch in the MOST critical moment and simply left. Not only left, but tried to gather all most influential people so they leave also so the whole thing will simply collapse.

Why didn't you simply leave alone?
You have to answer this question, bitch.

Ok, understood, the pressure to destroy the commune was way too much, beyond intolerable. But you could just say: sorry, I can not do it any more. It is too much for me. Let me go clean toilets instead, which is what my true level is. You did not have to leave the commune. Not only leave, but to leave in such a way that it would be a devastation. Because everything was simply dropped on the floor between the inhalation and exhalation.

And now?

And now you have your walls in Osho pictures and you are giving the interviews showing how spiritual you are.

But this is just guilt. Can't you see?
You are sitting there in Switzerland doing this ""charity"" number in some hospital, pretending to take care of some kids. WHO are you kidding but yourself?

No way. You have to come out of that shack you built around Jay and Osho and you are to report the FULL findings. You can not pretend to be with him, but, at the same time, condemn the fact he changed his name. I can change my name to ZZZ. ANY time I want.

Because the way it is right now is record is not complete. Furthermore, it is distorted and unless you come out and give a FULL account of what happened, and I mean EVERY SINGLE LITTLE DETAIL as far as you know, you won't be able to die in peace.

Gitit?"
,veerenski,2010-08-25T11:47Z,"To any former Osho disciple who runs ""spiritual operation"" now:

You are to either to associate whatever you do with Osho and make it clear that whatever you have to ""teach"" comes from Osho,

or...

You are totally to abandon your ""spiritual classes"" and go get a job at some McDonalds or whatever you are worth.

Remember this: Osho said: when I give you a title, it is nothing more than your potential. When I say you are a mahasattva, it means it is your POTENTIAL. It is not necessarily the reality of who you are. I am just giving you a rope.

Do you understand this:

Which means, first of all, to be a member of ANY ""commission"" in the name of Osho, you have to have a certificate, signed by Osho, where it says you are a mahasattva, and anything less than that won't do.

Then we will examine all your great ""achievements"" and to a research on the internet to see what is known about you and your work.

Now, I warn you, if I EVER find ANYTHING, where you do not mention Osho, but have ANY kinds of claims of being ANY kind of ""spiritual"" blah, blah, blah, I have full authority to revoke your certificate and exclude you from that ""elite"" club you have created in his name, sucking blood of fools and gullible.

You, gullible fools, book some session and pay top dollar for it.
Then you come to a private session and?

And that ass sits in fronts of you saying to a word, waiting till you start whining about some ""problem"" you THINK you have. You see, you do not even realize you do not have ANY problems. The ONLY ""problem"" you have is called LIFE and all sorts of little things that are pretty natural.

Now, as soon as you squick, he comes alive. As soon as you give him ANY reason to catch on something, he starts telling you how screwed up you are, and you, being as gullible as you are, start tuning into HIS wave, HIS trip and begin to think it is YOUR problem. Do you see?

Nope. It is HIS problem, and quite often the diagnosis is the same: the complex of inferiority.
HIS, not yours.

Can't you see?

Yes, Osho allowed ALL sorts of ""therapies"" and even supported it. But, from what I see, it is just a candy for you. Something to suck on. Like a titie of a mother. What to do?

But he never ever thought ANY of these ""therapies"" are worth more than a little tiny piece of a chicken shit. How can the blind teach the blind how to see?

So...

I, hereby, declare ALL ""therapies"", without exception nothing more than a shugar pills. Quite innocent, but utterly useless. They are mostly to occupy your mind with ""breakthroughs"".

If you want to buy into it, fine. It is just like a cup of coffee. But nothing more than that.

Therefore, the entire operation of the ""resort"" in Poona is nothing more than a scam. You won't solve ANY of your ""problems"" as a result. It is all a myth told to clueless.

and broke their teeth on it.

You can call him a criminal and not because of those crimes committed in Oregon, but much more fundamental things.

You can call him god and for equally as valid reasons and plenty of it could be substantiated with specific evidence.

You can call him a child, a virgin girl, utterly innocent in her intent, utterly pure, like a virgin spring.

You can call him a joker and that aspect is one of the most pleasing aspects of him, and he IS a joker, and entertainer. He entertained his people and had so much fun that it is probably the most pleasing aspect of the whole thing.

You can call him a doctor and you would be surprised how many sicknesses he helped to cure.

You can call him a destroyer of traditions, and that is probably one of his most significant aspects because he did so much destruction to all sorts of prejudices associated with different ""religious"" traditions, like no one else.

You can call him a baby sitter, a mother, your loving uncle and the list goes on.

You can also call him ""the biggest pimp the world has ever known"" as U.G. Krishnamuri called him. U.G. Krishnamurti is not J. Krishnamurti Osho keeps talking about. Some claim Osho called him a ""realized man"",
and at least in one of his discourses he called him a fool that god very angry at something Osho did. He said that U.G. Krishnamurti is a fool
because he hanged around J. Krishnamurti for at least 6 years and Osho claims it should take no more than a couple of days to see that
J. Krishnamurti is screwed up. And yet, there are thousands of references to J. Krishnamurti in Osho discourses. He even stated that him and
Krishnamurti are doing the same exact thing. They are like partners or buddies. And yet, Osho himself admits that the very concept of awareness comes from J. Krishnamurti, at least in modern vernacular.

So, you are going to have plenty of fun and eye opening and mind shattering experiences when you try to figure out who this man is.

Some background to be considered as something to keep in mind.

He was born in a village in an extremely poor country and there are things that immediately come to ones mind.

First of all, the people born in the villages often have an issue with a complex of inferiority. Whenever they end up in a city, they often tend to struggle for power, authority and domination. Because they need to show those arrogant people of the cities that they are not worse then them.

In fact, they are MUCH ""better"" than them. As a result, plenty of world ""leaders"" and prominent figures in any sphere of human activity or
organization happen to come from villages. Such is Gorbachev, Yeltsin of Russia and many other most powerful figures in the entire history.

Secondly, since India is one of the most poor countries in the world plenty of people run out of their skin ""just to survive, just to survive"".
As a result, many of them end up in religions. Because it is one of very few things that is impossible to either prove or disprove. Prove there is god. Prove meditation is anything more than a myth. Try to DIS-prove the god or just about ANY of it.

Has anyone seen god unless he was under influence of some drug, alcohol or simply ""crazy""? Anyone making such claims to others is nothing more than a fool. Yes, he CAN have it for himself in private and be utterly convinced of it. But trying to insist on it to others, you often
end up with your head chopped off. Nobody, no ""powers"" running this world want to have people like this around. Because they create great doubts in validity of all these ""empires"" and ""systems"" of organization, social or otherwise. That is the most dangerous thing for ANY ""society"".

That is the difficulty all people, interested in Truth, or That Which Is, as Osho defi"

,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-10T22:17Z,"Osho was formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his 'teachings' led members of his cult to poison over 700 people in The Dalles, OR in 1984. He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his 'teachings' are the same - dangerous and insane."
,jwrallie,2010-09-21T16:53Z,"@veerenski
I don't know much about the comercial scams going on, mainly because I found Osho's words through torrent media, but I want to make sure that others are going to be able to found it as I was able to. I'll try to seed as much as possible because I understand the need that others may have of this information. Thank you for your work so far."
,veerenski,2010-09-21T17:43Z,"Good. That is about the only thing I, personally, want to hear.

It is not a matter of me or you or anyone else. The work has to go on and the message is to be spread like a wildfire now. The time is ripe and everything is in place for it to happen NOW.

All the zombification, done to mankind, especially during the last 20 years has to be counteracted. Sure, it is almost impossible because the damage done by the powers of evil most profound is nearly lethal.

But... Now some other things come into play. Secondly, the desperation itself makes it possible for people to look at the very roots of zombification and biorobotization of mankind."

BELOVED MASTER,
WHAT ARE YOUR LAST WORDS GOING TO BE TO THE WORLD?

It reminds me of a story George Gurdjieff used to tell his closest disciples. The story is about a great past master, a buddha, who had a self-appointed right-hand man who was a faithful follower for year after year. And when the master was in his room on his deathbed, all of the followers silently waited by the door not knowing what to do and incapable of believing that their mystical master was really dying.

Finally, through the sorrowful stillness, the master's voice was faintly heard to call the name of the right-hand man, and all of the followers looked at him intently as he made his way to the master's door. As he reached for the knob he glanced at the peering faces around him and imagined their envy and respect for him at being the only one to be called to the master's side during his final moments. He already imagined how after the master's death he would slowly emerge from the room as the new head of the system, a veritable Peter-of-the-Rock.

Quietly he entered the darkened room and slowly he made his way and knelt by the bed. The old master nodded for him to come nearer, and he leaned over with his awaiting ear by the old man's mouth, and the master whispered,

""Fuck you.""

Enough for today.
