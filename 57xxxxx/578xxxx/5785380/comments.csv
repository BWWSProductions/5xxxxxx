,hehiha,2010-08-23T20:39Z,How do i use phoenix?
,hehiha,2010-08-23T20:42Z,^^
,packy.s85,2010-08-23T20:50Z,Does it work?
,simonpip,2010-08-23T20:56Z,"""Authentication failed""

Using this crack, your life will continually drain, leaving your vision blurry and desaturated. Additionally, forward and backward seem to be reversed."
,RDCMrT,2010-08-23T21:02Z,"I can CONFIRM it works, but there is a fucking authorization IN-GAME.
When playing chapter one it says ""authorization failed, this will effect your gameplay negatively""
Then the game starts to stutter and playing is awfull.
So they have build in a gameplay authorization, fuck man !!  "
,Jesper1230,2010-08-23T21:02Z,Your health is always near empty and the controls are switched (forwardbackward)
,sjaam,2010-08-23T21:06Z,"same problem as the other crack.
health slowly draining and w and s keys inverted."
,Undermand,2010-08-23T21:06Z,"it seems to make the infamous reverted controls, and the slow death authendication fail.

nice try thou"
,Pt74,2010-08-23T21:08Z,Phoenix
,kekface_,2010-08-23T21:09Z,Works yesno? I bet no. :P
,tpbfan111,2010-08-23T21:11Z,"It didnt work for me it said this (Windows can not access the device,file, or path.)"
,bulgar69,2010-08-23T21:13Z,no - doesnt-work.
,RDCMrT,2010-08-23T21:14Z,"CONFIRM it works.
BUT game has ingame authorization.
After starting chapter 1, a message in the upper left corner says ""authorization failed, this will affect your gameplay negatively.
Then the game starts to stutter, enz, making it unplayable."
,elmo8909,2010-08-23T21:19Z,"Wow, I am amazed, it's not even the demo menu... although, I got stuck at loading when selecting ""Story---easy"" It just keep't loading, re-un-packing the SIM and going to freshly replace all files/cracks, thanks so much Mbb15! Gonna seed overnight for sure...."
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-08-23T21:22Z,"YES THIS WORKS FOR ME!

With MAFiA.2.2010.CLONEDVD.PC-ELiTE


Install the game using phoenix 1.2
Remove all demo bullshit out of the steam map.
Put a new map in it call it MAFIA 2
The unpacked files with phoenix, you put in there.
Use the crack!

thanks!"
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-08-23T21:29Z,"The game has in-game protection!

''authorization failed, this will effect your gameplay negatively''

Unable to play, so fucked up the game gets due to this."
,hehiha,2010-08-23T21:48Z,"I can play Chapter 1, and tha'ts it. Then it goes like the others say. Hope a crack for the full game coming tomorrow ^^"
,hehiha,2010-08-23T21:49Z,"Failed, blabla like everyone else."
,elmo8909,2010-08-23T21:51Z,"Damn...Got the play the WWII level, and then a little bit in the car, and then stuttering and reversed controls :( Aw man... hope this is fixable."
,filedino,2010-08-24T02:28Z,"Crack works!

I used MAFiA.2.2010.CLONEDVD.PC-ELiTE

1. Unpack the game using phoenix 1.2
2. Copy Mafia.II.Crackfix-ZHONGGUO crack to the ""./Mafia2/pc"" folder overwriting mafia2.exe and steam_api.dll
3. Play the game

Note:
I was offline while playing and there was no ""authorization failed"" notification in the game.

I'm at chapter 6 and all works fine...for now!"
,chamakh79,2010-08-24T04:04Z,"although better than nothing, but still a half-fix. incompetent by far and nothing compared to the GTA4 fix (remember the in-game protection). Where is RELOADED?"
,cormacus,2010-08-24T06:13Z,"Hmm, interesting. I applied the crack over the demo crack and also noticed that health was reducing, forward/back controls were inverted and vision was blurry (only when you press forward for some time actually). So I cracked the health with ArtMoney, redefined controls in the settings and didn't pay much attention to blurring. I completed a few chapters (I'm at the beginning of chapter 5 now). And guess what. I noticed that health wasn't reducing anymore. I restarted the game and, hey, the blurriness is gone, too. Forward/backward controls are still inverted, but who cares, just redefine the buttons. Maybe this stopped happening after chapter 3. I started the game with the Internet connection disabled."
,Kapoon,2010-08-24T13:05Z,"I used phoenix 1.2, and when i press "" scan a sim file"" 

it says: ""Apps"" section not found in ""s""! wrong disk? ""

I updated ContentDescriptionRecord, and did everything how it should be done, i think its trying to search another directory or something but i don't understand why it won't just let me look in C:\ or change it in the menu or something.

Please help anyone!"
