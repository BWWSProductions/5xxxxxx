Rumpole of the Bailey has entered the public concience in the same way as Inspector Morse, Sherlock Holmes and James Herriott as a character who transcends the ages.

Here we have the complete television series from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Wonderful stuff which deserves to live forver.


Enjoy and Seed!!
