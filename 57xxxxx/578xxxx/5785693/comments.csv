1) to thank you for your dedication to uploading all these corrie episodes I'm thrilled to be able to get these for my Mom to watch.

2) to ask you if there is any way you could possibly seed some of the older ones at least for a little while, starting Oct 28, 2009? 

We're in Canada and my Mom is up to Episode 7194 which aired in Canada on Aug 17, 2010 but it aired in the UK on Oct 28/09 - so I am trying to download them for her so that she can watch them on her TV rather than through the website on her laptop - but many of the ones that old don't have any seeders.

Sorry for such a big request, if you're able to help out that would be marvelous! If not, I understand, but it never hurts to ask.

Have a great day and please keep up the fantastic work!"

Most of the old ones aren't doing too bad actually from Oct to Jan 50 downloads total and only 13 left to go... but those last 13 sure are crawling lol.  No biggy, we'll get there and I'll try that other site too.

Take care!"
