Neil Young Heart of gold + special features nl sub

A film shot over during a two-night performance by Neil Young at Nashville\'s Ryman Auditorium.
Overview:
The film opens with interviews with Young and most of his band, which includes Emmylou Harris, Young\'s wife Pegi Young, steel guitarist Ben Keith, and keyboardist Spooner Oldham. They and the other band members describe the concert and the making of Prairie Wind. The recording of the album and the filming of the concert occurred just before and after Young\'s surgery to correct a cerebral aneurysm, and just a few months after the death of Young\'s father Scott Young.

The first half of the concert consists entirely of songs from Prairie Wind, and the second half consists of acoustic songs from throughout Young\'s career. Young describes the inspiration behind several of his songs.
Songs in the film:

The performance captured in Neil Young: Heart of Gold was filmed over two nights on August 18 and 19 2005 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. In order to increase the length of the concert film, director Jonathan Demme asked Neil Young to supplement the songs from Prairie Wind with an encore set of older songs. Young agreed and selected songs that he had previously recorded in Nashville. The two sets are set apart by a costume change for the musicians and a different backdrop on the stage.
