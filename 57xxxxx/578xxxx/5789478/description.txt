SYNOPSIS: Veronica and Boris are blissfully in love, until the eruption of World War II tears them apart. Boris is sent to the front linesâ€¦and then communication stops. Meanwhile, Veronica tries to ward off spiritual numbness while Borisâ€™s draft-dodging cousin makes increasingly forceful overtures. Winner of the Palme dâ€™Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, The Cranes Are Flying is a superbly crafted drama, bolstered by stunning cinematography and impassioned performances.
