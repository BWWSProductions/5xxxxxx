This is a tale about a female doctor who runs a girls's school called Kent Manor. The girls are so horny that they can't wait to unzip any available male - including the school gardener, the new psychology professor, the laundry man and other assorted desirable targets. With a cast of fresh, sexy new faces, along with screen veteran Linda Wong - "Young Students" makes continued education so very inviting indeed!
