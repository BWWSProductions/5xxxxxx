Encoders Notes:As previously mentioned this was encoded using the original source and not the first rip by Sirdiesolot :) The bottom left watermark has been removed and not cropped off to leave more of the picture intact. There is a second watermark which says "As an anti-piracy measure this DVD has been encoded with your personalized watermark" this does not appear often and as it is postioned in the middle of the screen, we decided to leave this and not blur it as felt it would make this nice little screener worse. Enjoy :)
