but it only works on Jtag consoles"
,tucker277,2010-08-23T16:48Z,Is there any way to get this to work on a normal console?
,nawzad40,2010-08-23T16:58Z,when is there going to be a release foe not jtaged systems
,fakebest,2010-08-23T16:59Z,this is real but like said before a Jtagged console is needed so unless you know what you are doing and then you will have to wait for a retail iso of this. because it will not work with just a flashed dvd drive.
,D4rth_Man7iz,2010-08-24T01:26Z,"For reference; it won´t work on a Flashed console, ONLY JTAG or Dev Kit.

Be mindful of what you are doing, you might cause problems to your flashed console.

Don´t waste time, bandwitch and discs trying to get this, that´s unless you have a Jtag console.


And Remember...If You Like It Buy It!

Support Bungie!"
