Camp Rock tells the rock n\' roll Cinderella story of Mitchie Torres, a teen with an amazing voice and a driving ambition to be a pop singer who wants to spend her summer at a prestigious rock camp. Unfortunately, an expensive music camp is a bit out of reach for her family, but her mother gets a job as Camp Rock\'s cook so that Mitchie can attend as long as she helps out in the kitchen between classes. Befriended by fellow camp member Caitlyn but intimidated by the immensely talented Tess Tyler and her friends Peggy and Ella, Mitchie lives a double life hiding that she is the cook\'s daughter and posing as a well-to-do camper in order to become part of the hottest clique at camp. When she\'s overheard singing, but not seen, by teen pop star and celebrity camp instructor, plus lead singer of Connect Three, Shane Gray, he is completely taken and sets out to find the girl behind the beautiful voice.
