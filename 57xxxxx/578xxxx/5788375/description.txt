J Bigga, real name John Browning, is a singer, songwriter and producer from Las Vegas, Nevada. He says that he values art, culture and media above all else. He is a dedicated professional musician with lofty goals and big dreams.

Bigga loves Top Ramen. He has stated that he lives like a university student, constantly eating soup and writing a new song everyday.

"I don't want kids, and I hope I never have them. I want to leave a gift to the world.. My music.. not just another piece of human bio trash like most people turn out to be." -J Bigga

Bigga has turned down offers from two major record lables. "I can't believe the offers I've gotten from these labels" Says J, "Now I realize why these bands are on MTV. It's not because they sound good, It's because they were stupid enough to sign!"



I bought this album and wanted to share it with TPB, so all I ask is you seed and possibly look into his music.
