Book Description
================
The first victim is found in a snow-covered Philadelphia field. Detective
Vito Ciccotelli enlists the aid of archaeologist Sophie Johannsen to
determine exactly what lies beneath the frozen ground. Despite years
of unearthing things long buried, nothing can prepare Sophie for the
matrix of graves dug with chilling precision. The victims buried there
haunt her. But while the empty graves terrify her, the killer isnâ€™t
done yet.

He is cold and calculating, the master of a twisted game. Even with
Vito and Sophie hot on his trail, he will not stop. One more empty grave
must be filled and one last scream must be heard, the scream of an archaeologis-
-
t who is too close for comfort and too near to resist.

Die for Me is the winner of the Romantic Times Reviewersâ€™ Choice Award
