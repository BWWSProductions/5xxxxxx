,RS232C,2010-08-23T07:58Z,"This is your upload and your telling others to seed? heh folks have to get it all first, otherwise they're seeding naturally."
,Tokio_Hotel_Fangirl,2010-10-02T18:11Z,Does this have the episodes 1-4(the story before Rurouni Kenshin) and episodes 5 & 6 the ending of Rurouni Kenshin?
,asif105878,2010-10-06T06:05Z,@Tokio_Hotel_Fangirl it does not have episodes 5 & 6 the ending of Rurouni Kenshin

A 10/10

,FreakyFresh420,2010-11-04T04:24Z,I use MKVtools to delete the subs

,runner99,2010-12-12T16:24Z,"This is a GREAT torrent, and i DL'd it easy. But, I'm kindda looking for a different english dubbing. Does anyone possibly know what i'm talking about? And if it's been uploaded?"
,FreakyFresh420,2011-01-07T22:40Z,If there is another dubbed version...I have NEVER heard about it
,FreakyFresh420,2011-01-07T22:48Z,i dont think there is any other dubbing
,FreakyFresh420,2011-01-07T22:55Z,Actually...there might be multiple dubbs..at least one of them is by Media Blasters
,FreakyFresh420,2011-01-07T23:10Z,As for Reflections....im working on getting that right now
,trecko88,2011-01-15T09:43Z,How do I put the Subs??
,shadowghost123,2011-01-20T04:24Z,"how did you compress the episodes down so small?



I think it might be worth downloading."
,n93dude,2011-02-03T07:02Z,Plzz seed...i m really gettin hopless speed of 10kb...
,FireIsHot,2011-02-21T08:50Z,"Hey, stupid question, but I was going to burn these to a dvd using DvdFlick as usual, but this is the first time burning Dual Audio video....

There's the option to remove one, both or none of the audio tracks, the problem is they both look the same, there's no difference in the track name and they both come from the same source.

So my question is, is there a way to tell them apart or is the English the 1st or 2nd Audio Track? Thanks!"
,FireIsHot,2011-02-21T09:12Z,"NVM Answered my own question using MKVMerge (It tells you the language) and as I guessed it was the second audio track. 

Thanks For an excellent Download once again."
,FireIsHot,2011-03-06T02:37Z,"Ok So Apparently MKVMerge creates unstable files. If your having issues burning these files and / or want the hardcod

When you add a file click ""Subtitle Stream"" Expand it - Right Click ""Remove Sub""

(Re-downloading and will seed again)"
,FreakyFresh420,2011-03-13T02:18Z,i use MKVtools
