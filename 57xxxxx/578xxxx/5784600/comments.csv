,ResinBros,2010-08-23T19:00Z,"Sorry, forgot to metion, this is encoded from high bit-rate DTS stream downmixed to stereo.  If not listened to through a pro-logic decoder you may perceive phasing effects."
,blamotoys2,2010-08-24T06:50Z,What about changin the format? Not all of us have a pro-logic decoder... CÂ´mon! i wanna listen these bastards...
,ResinBros,2010-08-25T04:36Z,"You may listen without a decoder no problem (if you can tolerate the phasing). We don't have a stereo version of this recording. One cannot simply create a discrete stereo version out of the surround version properly. (Same reason that mono recordings of Beatles' records are coveted by audio enthusiasts.) The mixing of the channels causes interference between the tracks and may kill the experience altogether. On the other hand, if we only give you the left and right channels of the DTS, you may miss elements entirely. If you can find a stereo version made from the masters, then you've struck gold. Otherwise, see if you can find a surround receiver or a Dolby headphone decoder"
