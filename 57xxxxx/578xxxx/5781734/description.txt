The boys are upset about leaving the Palmwoods, and Jo (Katelyn Tarver) and Kendall share a kiss, the first kiss between them on the show. Meanwhile, Katie is upset since she spent her life savings ($3,000) on items to sell at the concert that will not happen. The boys then return to Minnesota to focus on other goals, which threatens to break up their lifelong friendships. Hawk finds James, and signs him, so he leaves the guys. Meanwhile, Gustavo and Kelly are upset about The boys leaving, and Gustavo sells all he owns to buy Big Time Rush back from Griffin. The boys come to terms with how their world has changed and decide to take control. They return to Los Angeles With Gustavo to bring James back into the group, but soon find out that he wants fame more than the guys. They try to audition boys for a replacement, but fail. The boys try to be only a 3 member band, but fail at that too. They then start to sing the "Giant Turd Song" and then, James suddenly joins in and joins the guys again. Katie then jumps up and screams "I'm gonna be rich!!" But soon changes it to "I mean, Yay for friendship!" The boys, along with Gustavo, plan their first big concert. With the help of their friends, they get the word out about the concert. But, right before their sold out concert starts, Hawk, Gustavo's arch-rival, kidnaps the four boys and try to destroy the boy's career. The boys will try everything to escape, including fall down stairs, while tied up in chairs.
