Although this aired just a few days before Christmas 
in 1967 it has the previous version of both the 
opening and end theme music. 

For that reason it was clearly one of the first 
4 shows filmed in the 6th Season. It was one of 
two episodes delayed even though it is fortunately 
not a holiday story.

Eve Plumb played Susan Oliver's little girl Kathy. 
Two years later she became famous as Jan Brady on The Brady Bunch.

It's possible that Charles Bickford was still alive 
when this was made.......he just wasn't in this episode.
