,BolBindaas,2010-08-25T10:04Z,"Not a bad movie, but it clearly is as good is it is by way of being almost a scene-by-scene copy of Billy Wilder's Irma la Douce (1963). Sanjeev Kumar plays Jack Lemmon's role, Zeenat Aman Shirley Maclaine's and Shammi Kapoor plays Lou Jacobi's. Hotel Casanova is called Hotel Mauj! Interestingly, in copying Irma la Douce, Manoranjan became probably the first Hindi movie where prostitution was presented as a 'fun' activity without (overt) moralising and the heroine sleeps with men other than the hero and that's OK. Quite a bid ahead of the curve for an Indian comedy made in 1974.
