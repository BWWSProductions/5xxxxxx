Please will you reseed the following, paying particular attention to the two identical torrents that point to the same file (see ** below)

The.X.Factor.s01.e09.Top.9.Performances.VeroVenlo.avi (448,136 KB)
The.X.Factor.s01.e11.Top.7.Performances.VeroVenlo.avi (448,410 KB)
**The.X.Factor.s01.e13.Top.5.Results.VeroVenlo.avi (actually Performances 447,986 KB) Please leave this as is with incorrect file name.
**The.X.Factor.s01.e13.Top.5.Results.VeroVenlo.avi (269,394 KB)**
The.X.Factor.s01.e14.Top.4.Results.Performances.avi (346,007 KB)
The.X.Factor.s01.e15.Top.3.Performances.verovenlo.avi (359,454 KB)
The.X.Factor.s01.e15.Top.3.Results.VeroVenlo.avi (255,942 KB)

,asighkick,2010-08-26T07:53Z,"**Please upload a new copy of The.X.Factor.s01.e13.Top.5.Results.VeroVenlo.avi (269,394 KB) putting the file inside a folder so that the results file doesn't cancel out the actual Performances file.  Two IDENTICAL .torrent files can co-exist since ĂÂľTorrent will add (1) to the duplicate .torrent.  Unfortunately, it doesn't do that with the actual file and tries to write two into one file!

Thanks for your uploads."
