           Gil Garcia is at the end of his life. Wounded and              
           bleeding in a church confessional, he tells an                 
           unsuspecting Father Wade his tragic story. At a young          
           age, Gil's father takes him to America in search of a          
           better life, forcing him to leave the girl he loves in         
           Mexico. Orphaned shortly after arriving, Gil is taken in       
           by his father's only friend, Dustin, who raises Gil along      
           with his own son, Rod. Fifteen years later, Gil & Rod          
           have yet to find their way in life, still living at home       
           and playing basketball on the streets for money. When          
           cancer overtakes Dustin, they are faced with a funeral         
           bill they cannot afford. Desperately searching for a           
           solution, Rod suggests kidnapping for ransom. Gil knows        
           of the perfect person: a woman married to a wealthy man        
           who would never risk the life of his loved one for the         
           relatively small amount of money in question. But Rod          
           doesn't know the whole truth - the woman is Desdemona,         
           Gil's childhood love from Mexico. The misguided brothers       
           proceed hastily with their ill-fated plan as love,             
           betrayal and racism collide to produce unpredictable and       
           tragic results.
