I know, you will find BLURAY RIPS that are HUGE 10Gbs or half as much again. You may see where someone has uploaded a file with all 6 HARRY POTTER films for example, so It will be a Big file. If you can reduce its original DVD size and convert it to a Xvid file in a AVI container, you can keep your regular 90min movies down to a size of no larger then 1.35Gb and as small as around 700Gb (obviously quality suffers when compressed too small) I can't see that you have done anything wrong, but At this point, I haven't downloaded this torrent file. I may be fine when played, I HALF to  conserve my hard drive memory, my work dictates so. (Photoshop gobbles memory) good luck!"

To heavyend81: So big-sized mpg files are much too unusual. Most users will hit the Search function and find more tempting torrents for this film. Besides, you have not started seeding it yet."
