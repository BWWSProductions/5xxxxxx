Work done:


Here we go with our version of Twilight.Thanks to Imagine for the source files.We know
there is a whole bunch of them but people asked for this one here it is.Work done 
our usual Brightness,Contrast Black levels,Saturation,Sharpness also blurred the watermark
in the left hand corner instead of cropping it out.Also the other encodes by other groups
cropped it out then they didn't even bother to resize to correct AR hence all these 292
resolutions and 2.5 ar.Enjoy this real release the way it was suppose to be encoded.
Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS.
