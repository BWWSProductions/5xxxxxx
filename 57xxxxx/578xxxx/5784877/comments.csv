Its the common nature of human. Try to get used with it.. 

Anyway I am not downloading this... 

But i need a help with something..
Can you give me the serial / crack / any way to activate and use ""Colasoft Capsa Enterprise"" 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Capsa Enterprise Edition
Capsa Network Analyzer (Packet Sniffer) is an easy-to-use Ethernet network analyzer (aka. packet sniffer or protocol analyzer) for network monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Start at: $549.00 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Isnt this overpriced? We are getting open source beauty Wireshark for absolutely free. :)  But this Capsa got some nice features that i miss on Wireshark. 

Hope you will help me. Thanks

He was so upset that he couldn't run his TotalCAD 1.0 but with TurboCAD now I think you just made his dream come true!! I love you! You're great! mwah!
