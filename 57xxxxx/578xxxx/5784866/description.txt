7-7 Seeds of Destruction (2005 London Bombings) [MP4]
Written and Directed by Tom Secker

The 7 July 2005 London bombings, also known as 7/7, were said to be series of coordinated suicide attacks on London's public transport system during the morning rush hour. We are meant to believe that the bombings were carried out by four Muslim men, three of British Pakistani and one of British Jamaican descent, who were motivated by Britain's involvement in the Iraq War.

At 08:50, three bombs exploded within fifty seconds of each other on three London Underground trains, a fourth exploding an hour later at 09:47 on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. The explosions appear to have been caused by home-made organic peroxide-based devices, packed into rucksacks and detonated by the bombers themselves, all four of whom died. 52 other people were killed and around 700 were injured.

The Tavistock institute of the Rothschilds is a training center for psychological warfare and mind control. The Tavistock institute is "under the square" of Freemasonry, of course, and the explosion happened in Tavistock square. They just love those word-games.

The Freemasonic Technopriests of the British Empire of Marduk have struck again. Once gain the masters of deception have seeded their wicked seeds to fool the world. Everything you have ever heard of the London 7-7 bombings is wrong, and once again you have been fooled. But isn't it the nature of the fool to be fooled? What would a fool be without the ones fooling him?
