- Largest Egg Recall in U.S. History Brings Renewed Attention to Dangers of Industrial Farming

The largest egg recall in U.S. history is bringing renewed attention on the dangers of factory farming and on growing consolidation in the industries responsible for the food many Americans eat. Over half a billion eggs have been pulled off U.S. shelves in the past two weeks following an outbreak of salmonella in the Midwest. Nearly 1,300 cases of people sickened by the eggs have been reported. Despite the size of the recall, responsibility falls on just two factory farmsâ€”Hillandale Farms and Wright County Egg, both from Iowa.

- Judge Blocks Federal Funding For Embryonic Stem Cell Research

A federal judge has blocked President Obama's executive order restoring funding for embryonic stem cell research. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the funding violates a 1996 law prohibiting federal money for any research that destroys or threatens human embryos. Obama's order had overturned a move by his predecessor George W. Bush to further restrict stem cell funding.
