Castles In The Sky, the sequel to Sipping Jetstreams. 

Sipping Jetstreams isn\\\'t just a film, a book or an article in a magazine...it\\\'s a movement.


You a see a photo in a book. You scour the coastline on a map. You hear stories from other travelers. And now you just have to find out for yourself. 


It begins with a dream. A vision seeded in your mind. But the next step is the one that counts. The first step. Onto the plane. Into the sky. From that moment on, the journey takes on a life of its own. You step off the plane and into the jetstream of travel. 


A few years back, Taylor Steele and Dustin Humphrey explored this concept in their film/book collaboration Sipping Jetstreams, discovering how new veins of travel enhance the experience of riding waves. For Castles In The Sky, Taylor Steele pioneered new coastlines on every corner of the globe, dived into the cultural stew of global exploration and brought it all to life through a visual whirlwind of inspiration.
