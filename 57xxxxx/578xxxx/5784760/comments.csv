Nice film - probably will continue with the franchise now! Won't say more as it will spoil the story. Thanks Dublin5 excellent work. By the way when people rate AV etc that I understand but what is M? I have seen it on other pages A9 V9 M6 what is M?? looked on forums and FAQs but still haven't found out."
,RS2309,2010-09-25T00:16Z,yes that's another thing thank you also for including english subtitles within the avi file that was so nice instead of having to add it with an srt file etc for burning. 
,aParadox,2010-10-01T08:52Z,"How is this a DVD rip far beyond pre-release uploads usually land? It's due in December, this was uploaded four months ahead when it was still in theaters..
Is this an R5?"
