,Flazhp0intX,2010-08-25T16:05Z,"Can anyone help me? This is my problem:

When I start Mafia 2 with the cracked *.exe, I get this message: Mafia 2 is not responding. This application will now close.

That happends to me everytime when I try to start it. I downloaded the Mafia II Skidrow game, plus this crackfix. So it should work.

Before I downloaded Mafia II from Skidrow, I downloaded that one from Globe. I had the same error message there :S. That's why I started downloading Mafia 2 from Skidrow since his releases are always nice. So I got the same error message @ two different releasers. Weird isn't it?

What I tried is: reinstalled game, used crackfix, reinstall PhysX, reinstalled videocard driver....

Could anyone give some help? Thanks ;)! "

,ckonstag,2010-09-01T15:18Z,Hi guys. Ihave a question. I have downloaded both the game and this crackfix. I haven't started the game yet and i was wondering whether i must first apply the crack and the the crackfix or just the crackfix. What have u done? Is the crackfix a fixed crack or an application that fixes the previous crack?
,Mrgigolo1,2010-09-03T02:48Z,"Hey guys im seeding now but i need getting a comment saying "" This application has failed to start because binkw32.dll was not found."" Any ideas ??"

,kalai0584,2010-09-11T15:33Z,"@The_Smoking 
i had the same problem. but now its working. just uninstall the nvidia physx and run the game it will install physx by itself. then run the game. it worked for me."
,MalFusiOn,2010-09-21T03:43Z,"@ everyone with the binkw32.dll error

the problem is that u dont have this dll, it should come with directx so try updateing that, if that doesnt work then u have to dl bink32.dll and put the file with the mafiaII.exe

you can get it from www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?binkw32"
,robotikon,2010-10-20T16:38Z,"here's how it worked for me on Win7 ultimate 64bit: make sure you install it to any folder other than the default Program Files on C. I then copied the original crack and the fixed one too (not sure if the first one matters). then right click on the new exe file, run as administrator. it automatically upgraded the PhysX stuff for me and runs as it should :) 

when first I installed it to the Program Files folder that was only when I got the missing binkw32.dll error

when I did not run it as administrator that is when I got the ""Mafia II has stopped working"" error

I hope this helps. and thanks to all for this game, Mafia was my all time favourite and I'm looking forward to this sequel :)"
