Second CD in the Campfire Songs series. Vol I was mainly acoustic versions of your favourite hard rock songs. This time most of the arrangements are less sparse since drums, bass etc help make the songs sound richer.  This album also contains updated and improved songs from the 2006 sessions. Please seed since this is a project without the back up from a rec company.
