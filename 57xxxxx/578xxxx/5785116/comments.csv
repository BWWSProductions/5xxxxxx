,jon4fun,2010-08-24T10:44Z,"@ jopaz - Have you read ANY of the comments posted by 20-40 in his torrents?
Have you offered to help get him a new PC?

He is working on a cobbled together old PC and is using an FTP service to seed his torrents. 

We (ALL) are lucky that we are getting anything from him as he can only UP 2 torrents at a time IF he can get his old PC to encode them in the first place. 

You should be saying 'THANK YOU' for the torrents he does provide and not asking for more!

One day soon, when his PC cannot be resurrected one more time, he will be gone for good!

I'm sure that if he CAN he will UP [Vexed]. 

However, YOU get back in your box and say NOTHING unless you are willing to help.

If you are willing to help, if anyone is willing to help to either help with the PC purchase or to help (via paypal) pay for the service that serves these torrents, then please contact me at

- of course I thanked 20-40 when i downloaded e01 , and i thanked him in advance for e02 , good manners should always be the means of any contact.
- I'm sorry to hear that 20-40 has financial problems and i really wish i could help.

as for you , jon , thank you for standing up for a good man against rude uncivilised persons who never say please or never thank.

again thank you 20-40 and wish you all the best.
