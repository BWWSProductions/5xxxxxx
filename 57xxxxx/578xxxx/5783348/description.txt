Release Notes
-------------
Video Source: Russian Silver [THANKS to Cristal!]
Audio Source: Our Own 

We are a little behind on this,but have been busy with life in general.
Well we started off by going through and creating our own sub file for the
Non-English speaking parts. Hard Coded them in Yellow. For the video,we
resized,sharpened a little,adjusted the colors(reducing the red quite a
bit),denoised,etc. Then we Synced,Filtered and Muxed our own audio to our
Encode. Audio came out pretty good,had some clipped peaks that needed fixed,
other than that didn't need to do much. There is one spot that we noticed was
slightly oos,however it only last for about 2sec max,so we left it alone.
Enjoy!=]
