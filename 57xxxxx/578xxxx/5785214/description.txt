The Missing Lynx NTSC  (English*French*Spanish)

This is a good animation movie. The characters are well done, the animation works fine and is also well illuminated. The humans characters design are similar to others we had seen in other movies, but well animated. Lot of action, and nice scenes. In the original version (Spanish) the jokes were OK, not the usual easy humor for kids, so isn't boring for adults. And the most important thing is the Story. Remember you about the imprisioned animals (like in Madagascar) and presents you a wild cat, the Spanish Lynx: Pardel or Iberian Lynx, which is a endangered animal.

For all these reasons I will recommend to everyone this movie, not a must see but a nice animated Story to watch with the kids or with everyone who loves animals.
