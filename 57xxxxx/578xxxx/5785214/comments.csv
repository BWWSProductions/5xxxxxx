by the way, if you dont want windows on your mac (believe me i dont but its the best DVD software out there is for windows), here is the website for mactheripper:   http://www.ripdifferent.com/forum/index.php

you need to register and figure out how to send a gift and get the latest release which i think is like 4.1...hope this helps"
[T],ctang,2010-10-02T05:54Z,so you get things figured out
[T],ctang,2010-10-02T16:23Z,do you use windows for torrents at all or do you just use windows to work the dvd and process it?
