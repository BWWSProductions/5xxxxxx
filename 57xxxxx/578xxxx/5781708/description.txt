The Sudden Passion began some years ago as M. Palermo\'s (of Electro group Femme Fatality) solo project. The songs share the stories of his tour adventures, love sagas, and tales of ballroom brawls from a tell-it-like-it-is approach. While all the ditties were originally showcased as solo/acoustic, they are now rarely performed the same way twice at a live performance.

Central Standard Time is the first full length Album available from The Sudden Passion. Although the songs on the record were written at various times between 2005-2010. The Songs were recorded in 2009-2010 in St. Louis, MO (where Palermo is originally from) and Silver Lake, CA (where the band now resides).
