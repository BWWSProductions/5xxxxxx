per Wikipedia: Song for America is the second album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1975 (see 1975 in music). Endless touring had given Kansas a small following of loyal fans, some of whom would follow the group from one show to another. Despite the minor success of their debut album, they were still, for the most part, a struggling bar band.

While Song for America did little to change that, it is regarded by many as their most progressive and heavy work, as their next albums would transit into a softer format. "Down the Road" is a typical example of Kansas with this heavy sound. Like the first album, the writing duties were divided between Kerry Livgren and the former members of White Clover, most notably vocalist / keyboardist Steve Walsh
