keep them comming ray "
,bkoska2005,2010-09-12T21:02Z,"no,

white=life,good,right,happy

black=death, evil, wrong, sadness

lol at least that's how MASSA explained it, since its a 
""black"" comedy ( negro black) they might reverse that to be more politically correct?

it all stems from plants growing from the sun, and it being scary at night.....when shit like sabertooth tigers might chomp yo' ass!"
,MovieX101,2010-09-13T17:01Z,"Thanks For The Up!

,marinesgirl,2010-09-20T06:47Z,"@ MovieX101

Woah, woah now... calm down. Ur a little insane here! I thought you said this wasn't a place for discussion...?"
,MovieX101,2010-09-21T19:17Z,"@ marinesgirl - I am always calm, and this isn't the place for discussion, I was commenting on the negative comments he said! Someone Needed To, and you certainly didn't! 
Next time try to pay attention and I notice you didn't mention anything about his Negative comments, I guess you condole that type of Negative behavior!"
,muLineZu,2010-09-29T12:54Z,"Well guys you got me confused because of your ratings: great movie, M-10/10. IMDB ratings are 2.6/10 (2.932 votes) and I thing I'll go with them.
On the other hand Ykkandil's comments might be kinda racist, but I'll have to admit he has a point of view that is quite real: when you see a ""regular"" movie, you don't count how many black people are in the cast; but in this movie (I have only seen the trailer and the IMDB cast) you can hardly see a white guy... So, what's next: Theathers for black only? We've seen that the other way round and I think it was bad enough..."
,MovieX101,2010-09-30T19:15Z,"
@ muLineZu - You are confusing? 1st you ask if this is a good movie, and then you start talking about how many blacks and whites are in this movie?
Lets be honest here, how many movies have been made with no blacks in them at all? I'll tell you, Millions! So why are you worried about the ratio number of blacks and whites, you should be more concerned if you will like the movie or not?  Why Did I Get Married, was good and this one is also good! If you like Tyler Perry Movies, you will like this movie! Does it matter how many blacks or white are in this movie? Next only black movie theatres? Don't be Ridiculous! Oh yeah throw IMDB ratings out the window! Those people are Idiots and Racists! They give All good movies - low ratings!

,Drizzzit,2010-10-14T14:23Z,"IMDB racist? Yeah right.. If that would be true, they would not have watched the movie in the first place :)

MovieX101: though I understand your point, don't be too fanatic. That's a sure way of getting people to ignre your comments. That is, if you try to push the point too much :)

muLineZu: liked your comment on this :)"
,MovieX101,2010-10-14T20:48Z,"@ Drizzzit - Not trying to push any point I am just saying it is what it is! The Truth is The Truth! Those Clowns at IMDB always give a typical movie with mostly black cast a low ratings? I doubt they watch the whole movie? Probably skim through them! Ha Ha! Those guys are Idiots! Furthermore You have your opinion and I have Mine! As far as I am concern, they are Racist!So I don't bother with them!"

,dragon_ba,2011-02-06T01:55Z,"this is not 10/10

Audio 7-8, Video 7

It is some sort of rip and the quality is tolerable for a new released movie, but its' definately not 10/10.

The audio is 32khz 92 kbit which also isn't hi-Q.  but it's still watchable. "
,perfectly_dark007,2011-03-08T03:41Z,so because theyre black were not allowed to say it was a shit movie? fuck me dead i must be racist against every race apparently with all the movies i classify as shit. including this one
