Pilot :
Of East Indian origin, Taj Mahal Badalandabad lives in Coolidge, U.S.A. along with his dad, Dilip, mom, and sister. After hearing about his dad's exploits at Camford University in Britain, he re-locates there. When he arrives he is royally received by the elite, only to be humiliated and told this reception was because of a 'typographical error'. He thus re-locates to his new quarters in a distant wreck of a building called the 'barn' - reserved for 'losers'. When he gets over this welcome, Taj must now come to terms with the Queen's language, her dialect, and the racial profiling ('Curry-breath', 'Paki'), and a busty Charlotte Higginson, who is not only better at fencing, but is also intent to ensure his dismissal. Hilarious results follow when Taj decides to fight the Queen and her people at their own game(s) with the help of fellow losers and a horny bulldog.
