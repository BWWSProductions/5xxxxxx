,ONeg,2010-08-31T00:07Z,"Thanks for including 2-channel audio for XBox owners. I muxed them all and it worked great. My PC (Windows 7 through Zoom Player) doesn't like episodes 1-3 so much (choppy) but the all of them play perfect on my 360.

Appreciated."

Note: I will be using VLC Player"

All episodes are very good quality except the faces of the 1st two veterans talking at the beginning of ""Why we Fight""
There are also scenes where smoke & clouds have rainbow patterns such as ""Day of Days"" when the C-47s are flying"

,yopepoy,2010-11-21T15:13Z,extremely good quality and also extremely slow download.
,SamtheRam,2010-11-22T05:50Z,"Audio and video synchronization sucks bad. Other than that, very nice. First few episodes are almost unwatchable because of lack of synchronization though."
,didihebat,2010-11-27T20:31Z,"For the first 3 episodes, the audio came in a bit late,, try adjusting the audio to come in at -4700ms. You can do this with the Windows Media Player Classic by going to the menubar and click Play-->Audio-->Options. In the Audio Switcher tab, check the Audio Time Shift checkbox and adjust the value to -4700ms. Click 'Apply' and restart the video. Just remember to uncheck the time shift on the next video you play :)"
,Melbournian,2010-11-29T04:50Z,"This is fantastic, thank you so much!

Only problem I have is I was expecting .mkv's but I can't really complain too much.

Cheers :)"
,nerd1337,2010-12-06T04:15Z,"i don't know why people keep complaining about audio being out of sync.  it's not out of sync here using WMP11.

perhaps people with sync issues have slower computers, full hdds or are just using crappy players because it's only 2.43 mbit video.  i see no latency in the audio whatsoever and that's even with seeking back and forth manually to different points of the video.  it's syncs perfectly and immediately.

Kudos to the ripper.  I have had this series in widescreen 4:3 DVD for a long time but pales in comparison to this full BDHD."

,skullfcukyou,2010-12-17T23:03Z,"the 5.1 audio is a pain in my ass. I can't convert / crunch these files for my iphone. VisualHub and Handbrake throw up when I try to use them. Episodes 1, 2 and 3 I was able to export using QTP but no program wants to touch episode 4. Anyone else have this problem?"
,muneeb.abbas3,2010-12-22T21:26Z,This is the best copy Available.. No audio problem. V10 A10.
,skullfcukyou,2010-12-25T22:24Z,"Just to clarify, I can watch all episodes in VLC and they're great quality. However, Handbrake, VisualHub and quicktime pro cannot convert some episodes because of the audio 5.1 bullshit. I've seen nightmarish instructions on how to convert 5.1 audio to 2.0 (or whatever the fuck it is) but they're always for windows and look like a serious pain in the ass.

fuck, I'm going to have to get another version. Unless someone has a solution to this antic??"

Richard Winters
January 21, 1918 â€“ January 2, 2011 (aged 92)

Major Richard ""Dick"" D. Winters (January 21, 1918 â€“ January 2, 2011)[1] was a United States Army officer and decorated war veteran. He commanded Company ""E"", 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, during World War II.

Gen. David Petraeus, who has commanded the 101st Airborne Division during his career, said in a statement on Monday that ""Major Winters embodied the very best of what a leader and soldier should be. He and the men of Easy Company lived the ""brotherhood of the close fight.""

""The deeds of Dick Winters and his men from Easy Company will always live on,"" Petraeus said

""Dick Winters volunteered to go to war, leading paratroopers into unknown, yet certain, dangers. He led by both command and example; his wartime philosophy was simple -- 'Follow me.'"""
