,bk0099,2012-04-28T09:20Z,"the audio (at least in apocalypse) is horrible quality.  it's majorly lacking low end and is heavily distorted during scenes with intense sounds.

video is meh but i wasn't expecting hd quality with this much compression.

i normally steer clear of these kinds of releases (heavily compressed hd rips) but i didn't have much of a choice as the films are dated and all the other ""720p"" rips aren't seeded all that well.

if you're going to watch these on your phone or tablet your good, you could probably watch it on your laptop, but that's as far as i'd go.  anything else and you'll notice the compression a lot."
