This collection is the two torrents posted by F10000 on TPB converted to a more convenient form. Each track has been flac-encoded with silence automatically removed (-inf dB at both sides and < -74 dB at the end). The flac files are tagged.

Note: Some players (including some versions of VLC player and Mplayer) do not play flac files from this collection to the end. Flac 1.2.1 is guaranteed to decode the files in the right way.
