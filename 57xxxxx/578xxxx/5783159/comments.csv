I have both xbox360 version and Pc version of

So im trying to figure out what the difference is
between the xbox mafia and the PC version.
Graphicwise, whether Apex is on the xbox, and so on.

Can someone please tell me if they know. Trying to figure out if i should wait for the crack for PC or just go on in with the xbox copy.

,wallacerocks30,2010-09-09T04:12Z,The people who are saying this game is not working is probably because they are not aware of the fact that you need to updated your bios on your xbox aka Get it reflashed at most every year because they come out with new game formats and shit and ur xbox wont read them without the newest software and they just recently came out with one so if you havent updated your software for awhile your xbox wont be able to read any of the newer games

,TR0UBLESUM,2011-08-13T15:37Z,"@Dead

You need to run the .ISO through abgx360. It will create the needed .DVD file for you. It will also verify the game. 

Then proceed to burn with ImgBurn"
