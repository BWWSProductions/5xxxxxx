This will probably be the last torrent that I upload today, cuz I have to go shopping for clothes and other stuff, cuz it is tax-free weekend.  Dont worry I will upload several things tomorrow. Also while I am gone today, I will leave my computer downloading and encoding stuff.  (^_^) "
,TKOG11,2010-08-22T03:37Z,Any chance you can up the star trek movies or TOS?
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-22T08:09Z,"@ TKOG11 - I can definitely do The Star Trek movies probably up by the end of the month. 

Now Star Trek - The Original Series, I think that I could do it, but it would take some serious time, cuz the only sources that I find are dvdrips with hardcoded dutch subs, which I dont think people would want or 720p BRRips that are like 50 GBs per season or Pal DVD9s that are like 50-60 GBs, so it would take several months for me to do it, but I would be willing to do it if you could wait a month for each season like season 1 I could probably have up in a months and so on."

[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-22T20:07Z,"@ TKOG11 - thanks for the link, cuz I didnt see that one, anyways I will gladly do it. It will probably take me 2-3 weeks to download, encode, and upload it. My mom will be pleased to have a copy of the series even if it is bootleg. lol. "

Thanks for the encoding, it is a great show!
Do you plan to make M4V release for the subsequent seasons as well? It would be really nice. :-)"
