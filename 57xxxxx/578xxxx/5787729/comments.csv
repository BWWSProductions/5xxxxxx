,Waratteta,2010-08-25T05:18Z,"I would get sexual reassignment surgery just to be on Matt Bomer's dance card, if you know what I mean. Goddamn. "
,arsenic1016,2010-08-25T08:42Z,funny fact: BrooklynD is Matt Broner's gay TOP husband
,schizogeri2001,2010-08-25T18:09Z,do you really have to post that every episode of white collar BrooklynD? Do you hate gay people?
,mikexxxryan,2010-08-26T06:54Z,"The majority of straight men fear guys like Matt Bomer.  Gorgeous, handsome, married to the television industry's biggest talent agent and happily married for quite some time now.  That's gotta be killing the Christian Right of this country.  Hey - did you see that the head of the Republican Party during 2005-2008 has announced he is gay?  You KNOW that's driving the die-hard white Bubba's of this country absolutely insane!  

God Bless Matt Bomer.  Support his show - download it!  On a personal level -even tho' I am married (yea, he was straight before we met), I wouldn't throw Matt out of bed if he dropped by for a three-way!  :-)"
,strwbrry24,2010-08-27T09:01Z,BrooklynD is probably a deeply closeted gay. Tsk. Is it me or does Kate look like Elizabeth at times? haha
