It says sexy comedy.. So I guess I'll give it a try lol"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-24T20:56Z,"@ everyone - Here is a review - 
I taped this show and must have watched it ten times and I find this show hilarious. The sexual humor is tasteless, but makes you realize where the sense of humor is going and society accepting all this. The sex humor is vague enough to keep kids at a distance and I think that is what keep the moral hypocrites at a distance!! I can see this show going at least one season if the Pilot is any indication. Very Funny Show!!

I give all the characters full marks and especially the women who are really hot.

Special high marks for the comic genius of the writers "
