,Fallacy11,2010-08-25T08:02Z,"Alright first off thank you so much for uploading these, your bleach torrents are the best for size vs. quality and also you put them up in a very steady timely manner since you've been posting so one more time thank you.
On another note I was wondering if you did the subs yourself, because if that's the case I have a huge favor to ask a previous uploader of the Bleach series used to translate the name of the zanpakutos/bankasi/shikais including the name of the attack as well and what they meant and I was wondering if you could do that to since I find it interesting to know the meaning of these things again you're doing a great job so don't feel obligated it's just a small favor I'm asking
Also on you next post where you always give the specs of the comps seeing as how I'm not that great with knowing these things could you define each peice of hardware and what it does cause I would love to know what it means since it's obviously important to you and therefore must be a pretty sweet setup anyways thanks for the upload I'll shut up now lol"
