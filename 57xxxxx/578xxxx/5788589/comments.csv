,voyager8,2010-09-10T18:21Z,Im have hash error. Reupload torrent.
,voyager8,2010-09-13T05:43Z,im download only virtual station from upload. But this need registration. Please upload crack on torrent.
,bioneo,2010-09-21T22:05Z,only enjoy the DS9 =)
,Kamui_84,2010-10-13T19:42Z,"Hm, yes, this is my torrent. And it is not (the torrent files differ).
I think it would be reasonable if you could delete this torrent and I will try again to upload it by using my account.
I think the reason that I couldn't upload DS9 was that for some unknown issue the torrent file itself was too big for the system.
It's not a matter of profiling or selfishness, but I think the torrent would be more popular if it would be at the side of the others and with a nice picture. And I would like to ""manage"" my own torrent, of course (answer to questions, change things if wrong in description, ask for seeders etc.).
BTW: I do seed *my* torrent. If this is really the same torrent (with the same hash) then I do seed this as well. But if it's another torrent (with different hash), I do not nor will I seed this copy (sorry, but I can't seed all copies of my torrents). :)

Cheers,
Kamui_84"
,bioneo,2010-10-19T22:01Z,"ok just tell me is delete this torrent???

i will do if you wish it! "
,Kamui_84,2010-10-24T13:39Z,"Yes, please delete this torrent."
,instantzeug,2010-11-25T15:58Z,"This is actually the same torrent as the one that Kamui_84 uploaded to torrentbay.to.  They have the same Info Hashes, i.e. peers from one torrent can connect to peers from the other torrent. The torrent files are different only because the comments and trackers differ."
,danwat1234,2011-06-10T10:13Z,"DON""T delete this torrent! Full quality rip FTW!

,zeeowl,2012-04-05T13:40Z,"Thank you tons bioneo for this great torrent.
I'd managed to get season 1 via another torrent, but 2-7 were so slow they would have taken years. This torrent has lots of seeders and decent speed.

Got 1 DVD done and it's working fine. Impatiently waiting for the others now... :)

I'll keep seeding for at least a few months once I'm done. Thanks seeders, and keep it up!"
,DannyPhantom,2012-05-10T18:54Z,"Dear bioneo,please seed this file,i can't download six seson more than five days.

AND MORE:

If do you haved this series on your computers-please seeding this series,pleeeaze,speed is very low.
