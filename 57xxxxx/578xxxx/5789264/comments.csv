My NOD32 just picked up 2 avi exploit trojans in this......I download loads of stuff...usually read and pick my way through carefully....I've never had NOD pick up a virus and I havent had any problems for years, honestly.....

And this from a TRUSTED member...fuck off! I know the pirate bay is not the piratebay it is meant to be but to what kind of soulless cunts has it been sold?"

Maybe they cleaned this torrent! ;-) Thanks for this great upload, alanwatson! :D I've seen a lot of Tom & Jerry, but not these shows! :D"
