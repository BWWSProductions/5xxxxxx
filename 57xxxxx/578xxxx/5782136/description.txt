Ministry of Sound brings together the best of British MC talent featuring some of the current biggest selling artists and rising future superstars. Over the last decade the UK has supplied the mainstream with a whole host of unique lyricists that have dominated the charts, sold out raves and taken over the airwaves, being championed by DJs such as Tim Westwood, Trevor Nelson & Mistajam.

The buzz genres of their time continue to feature some of the baddest mic men with Garage, Grime, Hip Hop, UK Funky and now Dubstep all making way for their versatile talents. In a period where UK MC\'s are at the height of their success Ministry of Sound has put together this unique compilation.

The first of its kind TV album features huge No. 1 artists including Dizzee Rascal, Tinie Tempah and Chipmunk alongside the likes of Proffesor Green, Wiley, Kano & Skepta, all of whom are considered pioneers in their game. Breakthrough artists such as Devlin, Giggs, Bashy, Donae\'O amongst others give us a taster of what we can expect around the corner. And it would be complete without the leading collectives of Pay As You Go, Boy Better Know and the recent #1 chart toppers Roll Deep.

From the streets to the stars, this is the biggest collection of the baddest lyricists and it\'s strictly on a hype ting...
