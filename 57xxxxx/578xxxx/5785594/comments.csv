,moshster,2010-09-06T11:07Z,"Sheesh, why give so much bandwidth to the AC3 track.  AC3 in theaters is only 320Kbps.  256Kbps is enough leaving more bandwidth for video."

,Deznaj,2010-11-22T19:34Z,"A noob is somebody who can't see the difference between a DVD-rip and a R5-rip...

But with a name like ""hardcoreAndMore"", what else could you expect? Probably a fat guy who is a ""hardcore"" online player, with a small dick, no descent job, and no girl or even a boyfriend...

Sad..."
,carrollta2,2010-12-09T22:35Z,"Lmao. People complain too much. Penfold is correct except for the fact that it still is a great upload. You all show your age when you bad mouth individuals for no reason. Simply ignoring the ignorant would be easier. 
Thanks for the upload BONE! "
