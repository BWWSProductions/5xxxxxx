         Even though Drama doesn\'t like his TV show proposal, a        
         network is interested; Ari tries to tone down his image;      
         Turtle looks for funding so that he can make enough tequila   
         to meet the demand; Vince tries to talk Sasha out of doing    
          another porn movie.
