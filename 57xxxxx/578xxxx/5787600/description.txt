Unveiling The Masonic Symbolism of Washington, DC
Cut 06-14-05 Master

Washington, DC is the first national capital to be designed as a seat of government, and the only capital to symbolically reflect and foster guiding values and principles. The Founding Fathers, especially the Freemasons among them, envisioned a city so beautiful and balanced that it would inspire enlightenment in those who lived and worked there. Film producer and Freemason, Akram Elias, designed a unique approach that unveils the Masonic symbolism hidden in the architecture, layout, and design of Washington, DC. Akram R. Elias, 33 , is very active in the Grand Lodge of Free And Accepted Masons of the District of Columbia and the Scottish Rite Valley of Washington, DC. He is the recipient of the Valentine Reintzel Medal for outstanding service to Freemasonry, awarded by the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia. In addition, Brother Elias is a member of the various York bodies of Freemasonry, the Ancient Arabic Order of the Noble Mystic Shrine, and The Royal Order of Scotland.
