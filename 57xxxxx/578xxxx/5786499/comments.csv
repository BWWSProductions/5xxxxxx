,cos13,2010-08-24T15:42Z,"did someone deleted my post?
you think im trolling when im saying it doesnt work for me?"
,Tilatus,2010-08-24T16:34Z,@cos13: No problems loading maps for me. Maybe you ran into a bug or did something wrong with crack?
,Rawmeat,2010-08-24T19:24Z,Works for me too
,Thany,2010-08-24T20:04Z,"Still doesn't work.
F**** skidrow. I have problems only with 'him'."
,BlacShade,2010-08-24T20:22Z,"Having the same issue as cos, whenever I try to start new game or load old one it refuses to go to map screen, it just sits there and shows the pretty background for the title screen"
,silvestris,2010-08-24T20:44Z,"I had the same problems with no maps... until I saw that the updater had installed to my /Elemental War of Magic. 

Seems it assumed my game folder was called ""Elemental War of Magic"". Renamed my game folder to that, reinstalled 1.01 update, copied over crack - works perfectly.

Cheers."
,silvestris,2010-08-24T20:47Z,"I had the same problem with no maps, until I saw that the update installer had installed to my (game folder) / Elemental War of Magic - ie it made a new folder in the game folder.

Seems it assumes that the game is installed to Elemental War of Magic. Renamed my game folder to that, reinstalled update, copied over crack - presto. Works perfectly.

Cheers."
,cos13,2010-08-24T20:53Z,"@BlacShade thats it.
I used the older one from the iso after patching it and it works. sometimes it randomly crashes after alt+tab or loading.
not doing anything wrong Im sure. using win 7 64 core i7 ati5870"
,cos13,2010-08-24T21:01Z,"silvestris thanks I didnt even think of this.
the updater creates a new folder inside where you told it to instal."
,BlacShade,2010-08-24T21:04Z,"Omfg, I cant believe it was something so stupid, I shoulda been able to see that. Thanks, appreciate the help"
,BlacShade,2010-08-24T21:13Z,"Wow, that stupid eh? I feel like an idiot now. But thanks for your help."

,Pliskin.s,2010-08-25T08:32Z,"very frustrating game controls --- could be a great game 1  day but this needs many updates ,torrent works great  but game is unfinished ,,,frustrating x10.


play it, you will agree i guarantee.tutorial and manual is lacking big time ! Plus game control mechanics just suck ! I hope they fix the problems soon ,it could be like Heroes but much better."
,elementalbeast,2010-08-27T09:26Z,"Heres some fixes to problems I had:

If you are getting ""The application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect""

You need to make sure you have all the Visual C++ 2005/2008 redistributables from Microsoft installed. Then you need to place ""
Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest"" and ""msvcr80.dll"" in the same folder as your Elemental.exe. I cannot 100% say that you need .Net Framework 3.5, but its also possible (its something I tried). With the combination of all these things the error should stop.

If your game never starts after you pick your hero or try to start the campaign and you either get a black screen (campaign) or an infinite animated screen (sandbox):

You need to apply ALL of the Skidrow patches. 1.01, 1.05 and the 1.05 /w hotfix patch. You do not have to copy the cracked content over everytime but you MUST install ALL of these patches in order. Also make sure they are going to your Elemental folder because the installer defaults to something else. If you changed your install folder, then double check.

Random crashes and other game problems are NOT Skidrow's fault ATM. The game needs many more patches. I honestly do buy games if I like them, but can't say I'd buy this one until its patched to a reasonable state of enjoyment. Its still very beta."
,Rawmeat,2010-08-30T04:09Z,"Guys, just so you know 1.01 is an old version now. The newest update is 1.06. Theres places to download that SKIDROW crack!"
,prfella,2011-04-11T09:15Z,"eleting Datazip.exe will get past the loading screen. However, now that I get to the selection screen, I cant click on anythhing other than ""options"" ""workshop"", and ""exit"" . I cant click on new game to start a new game. Anyone know how to get around this?"
