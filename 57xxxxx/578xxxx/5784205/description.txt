Danielle, a young psychology student, is trying to rebuild her life when she sublets a century-old Victorian house. Unknowingly, she awakens an evil specter lurking in the dark recesses of her new home. To prove to her sister, Anna, that she isn't delusional again, Danielle sets out to document the haunting with horrifying results. She unleashes the soul of Edgar Crowe, a vicious child killer, who quickly seizes control of her life. Hungry to satisfy his taste for torturing boys, Crowe uses Danielle like a pawn to resurrect his ghastly "Panic Chair." Now, Anna faces an impossible task - destroy Crowe without destroying her sister. The solution comes to Anna, but is it buried too deeply in the long dead past for her to reach?
