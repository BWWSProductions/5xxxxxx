Thanks!

NOTE: This game is not recommended for people playing from DVD-R discs due to the problem with Wii's not being able to read DVD-R discs at fast enough speed in comparison to genuine original game discs.
Many games play fine from DVD-R however ''We Sing: Encore'' is one that does not.
Nor is ""We Sing: Robbie Williams""

PROBLEMS: running from disc this game is unable to play correctly as the song audio goes out of sync by delaying and the background videos stutter/freeze/lock-up due to DVD-R slower read speeds.

REMEMBER DISC LOADERS: THE WII CANNOT PLAY DVD-R DISCS AT THE SAME READ SPEED AS ORIGINALS. MOST GAMES WILL PLAY BACK FINE, HOWEVER SEVERAL WILL GLITCH DUE TO THIS ISSUE."
