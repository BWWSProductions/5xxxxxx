unfortunately Richard Gage isnt the best choice for a discussion. he is a great guy for sure but doesnt know how to respont properly to critics like the other guy on this show.
Ian Punnet should invite Alex Jones as 911 conspiracy guest VS some other dude.
Alex would DESTROY the guy."

I wish Art would have on Alex Jones as a guest,but it will never happen given his opinion on the topic."
,-SPQR-,2010-08-27T19:59Z,"agreed.
I cant stand Ian Punnet anyway. He always sounds so full of himself, is not open minded, and has some kind of neocon attitude. I mean he drinks the cool-aid BS propaganda the government puts forward like water and tries to press his stereotype opinion onto the listeners."
