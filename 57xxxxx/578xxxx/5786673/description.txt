In a universe such as improvised music where, particularly in an ensemble,
chance plays some kind of role, AgustÃ­ FernÃ¡ndez and Barry Guy did not by chance
name this opus Some Other Place, paradoxical as it may seem at first sight. Much
rather, it is a deliberate plight to give to this composition a title that
brings up the notion of otherness, which is markedly present in both their
careers. Many areas were scoured, at times under the command of one another or
as third parties may dictate, and if all these worlds did have something in
common then it would be this sense of quest, of adventure, of exploration of
frontiers of musical forms, of eagerness to tauten a composition so as to
distort it and, by extension, to transform it, to reach a threshold so remote
from the starting point and yet implied from the outset. Never before did AgustÃ­
FernÃ¡ndez and Barry Guy choose to throw away the safety net as they do here,
opening a sincere dialogue that subsumes so many years of shared musical
experiments, leading a reflection on a form of art that â€” due to its ephemeral
nature â€” is unrepeatable.
(from the liner notes by Ferran Esteve, Barcelona)
