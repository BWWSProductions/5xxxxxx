http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5789407/The_Steve_Miller_Band_-_Greatest_Hits_1974-78_[Vinyl]_HMV"
,dazjaz01,2010-08-27T09:58Z,files only play for a couple of seconds in wma with flac codecs. All HMV do the same thing. Don't have trouble with any other flac files. Does the same thing in other players as well. 
,dazjaz01,2010-08-27T10:03Z,why do the files only play for a couple of seconds. Using wmp with flac codecs. othe players do the same and othe flac tracks play fine. 
,carambolapreta,2010-08-27T18:29Z,HMVinyl: Thanks again! I did not knhow this this band till I downloaded this torrent. very nice songs. I´ll seed for a long time 
[V],HMVinyl,2010-08-27T21:25Z,"the problem your having its with your sound card settings, these flac files are 96/24, whereas the others are 44.1/16

check your playback settings and make sure you have 96 khz and 24 bit selected..."
