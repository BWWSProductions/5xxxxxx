Analysis by Dr. Greg Jenkins and Arabesque[1]

Jim Fetzer: â€œI must say I think weâ€™re finding out Judy, what happened on 9/11.  Iâ€™m just blown away by your work.  This is the most fascinating development in the history of the study of 9/11â€¦ Iâ€™m going to make a wild guess Judy; Iâ€™m going to presume that these [directed energy] beams had to be located in Building 7?â€

Judy Wood: â€œNope.  I donâ€™t think so.â€

Fetzer: â€œPlanes?â€

Judy Wood: â€œNoâ€¦ I think itâ€™s very likely itâ€™s in orbit.â€

Fetzer: â€œOh Really??  Oh ho ho ho ho!  Oh Judy.  Oh my, oh my, oh my.  This is hugeâ€¦ this is huge Judy.â€[2]

Abstract:

As the above quotation suggests, Dr. Judy Wood is one of the first and foremost supporters of the hypothesis that Directed Energy Weapons destroyed the World Trade Centers on 9/11.  This topic is discussed and analyzed in the following interview between Wood and Dr. Greg Jenkins on January 10th, 2007.  The relevant features of Judy Woodâ€™s hypothesis are discussed and shown to be wholly inadequate and unscientific.  Many of Woodâ€™s weakly supported arguments rely on misinterpretations about â€œwhat happenedâ€ that are subsequently used to advance misleading explanations for â€œhow it happenedâ€.  The topic covered in this interview is also dealt with extensively in Dr. Jenkinsâ€™ paper, The Overwhelming Implausibility of Using Directed Energy Beams to Demolish the World Trade Center.[3]  

Transcript and Analysis of the Interview[4]

GJ: = Greg Jenkins

JW: = Judy Wood

GJ: Iâ€™m speaking today with Dr Judy Wood. She received her BS in Civil Engineering in 1981, MS in Engineering Mechanics in â€˜83, and PHD in Materials Engineering Science in 1992 from the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Polytech Institute and State Institute at Blacksburg, Virginia. From 1999 to 2006, Dr Wood has been an Associate Professor in the Mechanical Engineering department at Clemson University, South Carolina. Among other skills she is an expert in the use of MoirÃ© interferometry, a full-field optical method that is used in stress analysis.[5] And, I wish to extend my thanks to Dr Judy Wood for taking time out of her schedule for this interview, and on behalf of our ragtag band called DC911Truth[6] I welcome you.

JW: Thank you.

GJ: Well, thank you. I guess the first question is: you have come up with some ideas regarding space-based weapons and the demolition of the World Trade Center Towers, and I was wondering if you could give us an overview of the proposed types of weapons that could be used for such a thing.

JW: Uhâ€¦ We havenâ€™t got into listing them yetâ€”Just Energy Weapons.

GJ: In what form?

JW: (stuttering hesitantly) Uhâ€¦ I donâ€™t think we even need to define it.
Evasion #1:

This is analogous to speculating that â€˜people caused the towers to collapse,â€™ and then claiming â€˜we donâ€™t need to define who those people wereâ€™!  Since the term â€˜peopleâ€™ is so general, we are left with a theory that is hopelessly vague.  Effectively, by evading this basic question Wood has left little room for critical debate or analysis.  Similarly, the term â€˜Energy Weaponsâ€™ is also vagueâ€”resulting in a speculative theory devoid of substance.

The question: â€œin what form [of Energy]â€ is fundamentally basic.  Energy comes in a huge variety of forms: plasmas, nuclear, electric current, electromagnetic radiation (radio waves, microwaves, laser beams, x-rays, etc.), ion & neutral particle beams, electron & proton beams, chemical reactions, kinetic energy weapons, etc.  Leaving the type of â€˜energyâ€™ undefined essentially leaves us with no theory at all.  As for types of beams, â€œthere are only two â€¦those that have mass (particle beams such as protons, ions, neutral atoms, or electrons) and those that do not have mass (photons).â€[7]

JW [continuing]: What we did was assemble all the picturesâ€”evidence that we trusted, and just going through the evidenceâ€”just looking at it. At that point what motivated this paper wasâ€¦waitâ€”weâ€™ve been told this story, that storyâ€”letâ€™s wipe the slate clean and start over. Letâ€™s see what evidence we do believe instead of relying on this rumor mill.  Weâ€™re told about molten metal that nobody has ever seen pictures ofâ€”these rumors of molten metal.
Misleading Argument #1:

This statement about molten metal is misleading for several reasons.  Appendix C of the FEMA report noted that there was â€œsevere corrosionâ€ of â€œstructural steel membersâ€ and independent investigators observed â€œintergranular meltingâ€ of â€œsteelâ€ from ground zero.[8] Although there do not appear to be many photographs of running molten steel, there are many eyewitness statements.[9] There are also photographs of red-orange metal,[10] and several photographs of previously molten metal.[11] New studies by Dr. Steven Jones reveal thermate compounds in iron-rich metallic spheres from the dust at ground zero.  These studies indicate that many of the dust samples had high percentages of molten iron in them.  Jonesâ€™ analysis of iron rich spheres is corroborated by official USGS studies that claim that these spheres are â€œfrequently seenâ€.[12] Especially noteworthy is a sample of dust taken from the 4th floor of an apartment about 100 Yards away from South Tower.  This sample also contained metallic spheres, indicating that there was molten metal during the collapse and that this material was ejected a far distance away from the towers.[13] This data further supports Jonesâ€™ hypothesis that thermate and possibly variants were used in the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers.[14]

JW [continuing]:Letâ€™s see if we can find any pictures of it. Letâ€™s see what we can see.  And so I started looking through [many] pictures. What were they telling usâ€”whatâ€™s the evidence?  And what categories of information?  And you start putting these categories of information together and it turns the building in one direction and eliminating various other possibilities.

GJ: No matter what the beam that is used in this situation, will involveâ€”I guess the term you use is â€˜dustificationâ€™ of metalâ€¦

JW: I thought Iâ€™d invent a new word.

GJ: Might as well, right?

JW: Poof!

GJ: â€¦or the vaporization of the metal in the towers, one or the other. Have you had, do you have any energy calculations at all to get a scale for what is involved for doing that?

JW: Yea, but [stuttering] we donâ€™t need to get distracted by those values.
Evasion #2:

No scientist or physicist would ever consider a simple energy calculation a distraction. As stated later in the interview, â€œConservation of Energy is NOT a distraction!â€ It is a basic tenet of physics that should be taken very seriouslyâ€”not disregarded as a â€˜distractionâ€™.  In actual fact, the entire directed energy hypothesis is a distraction until it can address this serious problem: â€œThe energy required to vaporize all the steel from both towers was pumped into the towers during the collapse time, approximately 10 secondsâ€¦ is over 5 times the total power output of the entire earth including all carbon combustion, nuclear power, wind power, hydroelectric power, etc. This is with no loss.â€[15]

JW [continuing]: If you look at the pictures, if you look at the scrap pile that when it was all done with, is there any question that the building was pulverized?
Misleading Argument #2:

Pulverization is also characteristic of controlled demolition because â€œexplosives powerful enough to slice steel will pulverize concrete and most other non-metallic substances into tiny particles.â€[16] According to first responders at ground zero, there did appear to be substantial pulverization.[17] However, Judy Wood argues that most of the building from the towers never hit the ground. In Woodâ€™s interpretation, the two towers were almost entirely turned to dust including most of the steel.  Her claim that not enough debris was visible on the surface at ground zero is not supported by any quantitative analysis.  Her argument that most of the steel turned to dust is based on misinterpretations of photographsâ€”an analysis that is inherently problematic since pictures only show the debris on the surface. Analysis of the sublevel collapses accounts for a huge percentage of the debris from the entire WTC complex.  Most of the debris is not visible in many pictures since it is located in piles, both above and below ground.[18] In comparison, WTC7â€™s debris pile was relatively small in height; this is typical for controlled demolition.

GJ: Well I do have some questionsâ€¦ Iâ€™ve come up with an energy scale for the problem. If you use, like, say, a photon beamâ€”a laser beam of some kind, you run into some problems, namely, the amount of energy required to evaporate the steel in the towers isâ€¦

JW: Wait, youâ€™re specifying evaporation?
Evasion #3:

Judy Wood interrupts the question before it is completed and changes the subject to avoid discussing this major problem with her hypothesis.  [Read also evasion #2.][19]

GJ: Sure.

JW: What about dustification? Is that what weâ€™re talking about?

GJ: You want to talk about dustification?

JW: Well, pulverizing the building is turningâ€¦ the building contents into Nano-dust, weâ€™ll call it.

Comment: Woodâ€™s statement that the WTC was turned into â€œnano-dustâ€ has no evidential basis in reality.  Nano used in the scientific vernacular is defined as the number 10-9. Debris is considered to be dust when the particle sizes are between roughly 1 and 100 microns (10-6 m = 1 micron). Debris which is smaller than 1 micron is generally considered to be an aerosol. The size of atoms is roughly 1 nanometer (10-9 m). Any reasonable translation of the language Judy Wood is applying here leaves the listener to conclude that Dr. Woodâ€™s opinion is that the WTC towers was dissociated into individual atoms!  There are a multitude of reasons this is an absurd claim.  One strong argument against this argument is that the power required to atomize all the steel, concrete, and building contents would be much larger than 5 times the global power harnessed by human beings.  Woodâ€™s statement is also not supported by official USGS studies.  See Misleading Argument #9 for more discussion of this.

GJ: Okay. Right now, I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ has this been done in the laboratory?  Has anything been done that would turn steel into dust?

JW: Uh-huh.

Comment: These tests by Wood appear to have been done in her imaginationâ€”she does not name any credible experiments which can turn steel into dust.  Wood describes this undemonstrated process as â€œdustificationâ€.

GJ: What?

JW: Various types of energy beams.

Comment: Again, Wood is not specific here.  Even worse, the specified experiment mentioned below is incapable of turning steel into dust.

GJ: What kinds of energy beams?

JW: Well letâ€™s seeâ€¦ you put something in your microwave oven and leave it on there extra long and see what happens to it.
Misleading Argument #3:

Microwaves will never turn steel into dust in a microwave oven; especially since the reflectivity of steel is well over 99%.[20] An essential component of the scientific method is that a hypothesis can be tested with experiments.  If a theory can not be tested it is called non-falsifiable and it is not considered a scientific hypothesis.[21] In other words, if Judy Wood can not suggest experiments to test her theory, she will never be able to prove it.  She might as well argue that invisible wingless flying ducks destroyed the World Trade Center.

GJ: Thatâ€™s food. Thatâ€™s not metal.

JW: Or something else.

GJ: If you put metal in a microwave it will reflect off of it.

JW: Hey! Iâ€™ve been trying a fork in there. I know youâ€™re not supposed to, but I wanted someone else to do it, to see what happens.

Comment: Judy Wood claimed that she had performed experiments which can turn steel into dust.  A microwave oven will never turn a fork into dust.

GJ: Yes, itâ€™s kinda fun.  Also, if you burn a disc, like a CD or something, stick it in the microwave. It makes a nice little show for you, so you might try that. Itâ€™s kinda a fun thing to do.[22] But, the thing is, I donâ€™t know of a way to dustify steel in any situation, andâ€¦

JW: [stuttering] Letâ€™s talk about physical principles.  If you heat steelâ€¦ some type ofâ€¦ [a]  particular kind of element, and heat it with a particular vapor pressure, it evaporates.

GJ: It evaporates, yes.

JW: So if you have enough temperature, enough energy, you can quickly put a lot of energy into somethingâ€”itâ€™ll go â€œpoofâ€.

GJ: It will evaporate, yes. Correct.

JW: And if you do that to one surface, maybe the surface right below there, it doesnâ€™t necessarily do the same thing to [it], because thereâ€™s a different process going on from the direct hit and the indirect hit.

GJ: That depends on the heat conduction of what youâ€™re trying to evaporate.

JW: No. not heat conduction! Weâ€™re talking about an effect on a molecule.  Why does the paper towel in your microwave not burn when water heats up?

Comment: Judy Wood appears to try to convey that if â€˜some kind of energyâ€™ was applied to a material quickly, then only a local area of the material may be rapidly heated. This is true, but it depends upon the heat conduction of the material you are using. That is, if the time scale in which you pump in the energy is slow compared to the time it takes the heat to be wicked away via heat conduction, this effect will not occur. If you pump in heat fast enough compared to the time scale associated with heat conduction, you will only locally heat the material.[23] 

GJ: Because it doesnâ€™t have water in it.

JW: Right. So the energy does one thing to paper, and does another thing to water.

GJ: Thatâ€™s because microwaves are absorbed by water, and the paper in the towel is not absorbed by water.[24] It has to do with the resonant energy of water.[25]

JW: So if you have some kind of energy you can put into a particular elementâ€¦ that excites that particular elementâ€¦[26]

GJ: If you excite an element youâ€™re talking on the order of the scales of eV to excite the electrons. If youâ€™re talking about a crystal, then youâ€™re talking about the bonding energies associated with that crystal.  So if youâ€™re talking about steelâ€¦[27]
Evasion #4:

Judy Wood once again interrupts and changes the subject after the problem of turning steel into dust returns. 

JW: [stuttering] Hang on, hang on. Thereâ€™s a slide that presents this information that Iâ€™ve started using.  First you figure out what happened,

Comment: Agreed.  This of course assumes that we donâ€™t first start with misleading interpretations/explanations that obfuscate what happened.  There are many examples of this kind within this interview.  We are doubly confused when presented with misleading versions of what had happened and how it happened.

JW [continuing]: then you figure out how it happened, then maybe why it happened, then who done it. But youâ€™ve gotta start and do it in that order. Youâ€™ve got to figure out what happened.  What happened doesnâ€™t depend on what you know about, and hereâ€™s the example I gave in Seattle. Letâ€™s say you know, the slingshot, the BB gun, andâ€¦ a firecracker. Thatâ€™s all you know about.  So you can only pick from those if youâ€™re going to describe what happened to the Twin Towers. Does that make sense?
Misleading Argument #4:

This is a straw-man argument.  The Scientific method does not ignore possibilities or necessarily begin with pre-determined conclusions as suggested by Judy Wood.  It observes phenomenon, determines a hypothesis, and most cruciallyâ€”tests the hypothesis with experiments.  Clearly, the concept of falsifiable experiments has been ignored by Wood.  Also characteristic of the scientific method is the rejection of theories when they are proven false with experiments.  This of course canâ€™t happen when a theory is unable to be tested.

GJ: No.  I donâ€™t understand.

JW: If you donâ€™t know about it, it doesnâ€™t mean it didnâ€™t happen.
Misleading Argument #5 (see also #4):

This statement is a straw-man argument.  Just because we donâ€™t know about it doesnâ€™t mean it did happen.  What is relevant is that the scientific method is used to determine a hypothesisâ€”any hypothesis, and then test it with experiments.  As soon as we start to debate things that canâ€™t be proven we are no longer dealing with scienceâ€”we are in the realm of opinion, faith, and unanswerable speculation.

JW: If I can figure out what happened first, then how it happened is down the road.

GJ: Ok, can we talk about your analysis on what happened?

JW: Ok. Thatâ€™s really where we are right now.  We donâ€™t know the serial number on the gizmo that was used, or was it something light came off ofâ€¦
Evasion #5

Judy Wood will have to figure out the â€œserial number on the gizmoâ€ or demonstrate an experiment to prove her hypothesis.   She has provided neither, and her theory remains non-falsifiable.  Indeed, her hypothesis is too vague to test as the form of energy employed by the proposed â€˜gizmoâ€™ is left unspecified.  This leaves us a theory that is ill-defined as well as non-falsifiable.  Even more suspect is the fact that Wood has not even proven her case for â€œwhat first happenedâ€ before determining â€œhow it happenedâ€. 

GJ: Okay. So, one thing that is puzzling to me that you had calculated the ratio of a building that was the Kingdome, right? And you looked at the ratio of before collapse height to the ratio of after collapse heightâ€¦

JW: Not the heightâ€”the mass. These are approximate ballpark numbersâ€¦

Comment: This statement by Wood is nonsensical; she does not analyze the before and after collapse mass of the Kingdome as they are obviously going to be the same amount.  She should be able to remember simple details such as these as they are an important part of her theory.  Since this interview in January, she has failed to address any of these legitimate criticisms and has repeated arguments and misinterpretations of evidence that have been demonstrated to be misleading. 

GJ: Youâ€™ve come up with 12%, or something like that, for the before and after collapse height.

JW: Uhâ€¦ [trying to remember] itâ€™s been a long time since I looked at those numbersâ€”the Kingdome was 30 feet, and I think it was something like 250, originally?

GJ: Well, I have the number, and you quote on your website as it beingâ€¦ it could be 12 point something percent, but it was about 12%.

JW: That page is in the most rough state possible. You can probably see itâ€™s half done, we havenâ€™t really touched that really since I first started posting it, so Iâ€™m not really familiar with the numbers now because itâ€™s been so longâ€¦

GJ: Okay. Thatâ€™s fair enough.

JW: I havenâ€™t done the triple, double checking, but Iâ€™ve looked at general trends, and the general trendsâ€”you have a 30 times difference in potential energy.  That was the biggest thing Iâ€™m focusing on.  Now looking at the rubble pile when youâ€™re all done with, letâ€™s look at the pictures. You know, exact numbersâ€”who cares? Letâ€™s look at the pictures.
Misleading Argument #6:

Wood uses an unreliable scaling method to determine how much rubble has been left at the WTC towers and â€œoffers no analytical measurement of the debris present after the WTC tower collapse. Instead, she vaguely and non-quantitatively refers to pictures where it is speculatively assumed to be self evident.â€[28]

Seismograph readings were used by Dr. Wood as evidence that much of the debris from the towers never hit the ground. She used an erroneous scaling argument in which the Richter scale reading measured from the collapse of the Kingdome is compared directly to the potential energy of the Kingdome. Based upon this analysis, she then scales the potential energy to obtain a hypothetical Richter scale reading. This hypothetical Richter scale reading is significantly larger than that actually measured from either WTC Tower collapses.

Her analysis is profoundly flawed. Consider the following example. The ML (similar to Richter scale reading) reported for the North Tower is 2.3. The ML from the raw amplitude seismograph readings for WTC 7 is 1.0. Even though the potential energy of the North Tower compared to WTC 7 was about 5 times larger, the energy derived from the Richter scale measurements is 87 times larger.  It would be absurd to conclude from this that most of the debris from Building 7 never hit the ground.[29]

JW [continuing]: You have these little people, look like tiny ants, this huge outer edge of the Kingdomeâ€¦

GJ: Correct.

JW: â€¦and, if you recall at the World Trade Center, when they were looking for survivors and they had the rescue workersâ€”they worked horizontally, And they were pulled down.  They didnâ€™t have to climb up over, you know, many times their height.

GJ: So in that ratio, if you do look at the numbers and you use your analysis for the Kingdomeâ€¦

JW: Which numbers?

GJ: On your website you had stated a certain average height of the Kingdome before collapse, and a certain heightâ€¦

JW: The center of it or just the average shape? And it really would have been lower if you looked at the actualâ€¦ I was looking at easy to find numbers, but the error would be in favor of, it would make a thirty times bigger number.

GJ: Okay it would make it bigger than your 12%

JW: Because I have it that itâ€™s too high already.

GJ: I see.

JW: Because the roof is very thin.

GJ: Yes, it is.

JW: And so if Iâ€™m saying just from the shape, you have the cylinder with the spherical cap on it, and Iâ€™m saying it all is the same weight per volume.  And the top partâ€™s really thin.  Youâ€™re giving it too much benefit, so thatâ€™s making the center of it too highâ€¦

GJ: Correct, and I agree with that, I definitely agree thatâ€™s a good way to look at it.

JW: The error is inâ€¦ the 30 is a low number.

GJ: Right. Now, on the rim of that, where you take the after-collapse height, the rim is mainly structural concrete.

JW: Iâ€™m not talking about the whole volume of the thing, Iâ€™m talking aboutâ€¦ thereâ€™s quite a lot of places where somebody measured that.  I didnâ€™t measure it.  According to the reference I provided, thatâ€™s the number they gave.  Then I look at the comparative height. The towers were a whole lot taller to begin with.  About four times or so?

GJ: The towers were 110 floors, roughly 12 feet, and so they were about 1350 feet tall.

JW: 1368.

GJ: Yes.

JW: I donâ€™t remember exactly the equivalent in stories of the other oneâ€¦

GJ: Well, if you take the collapse ratio and say itâ€™s 12% of the height, then it would be 13 or 14 floors you had come up with on the debris height. Thatâ€™s what you did on your website.

JW: I havenâ€™t looked over that page in a while.

GJ: Iâ€™m just trying to refresh your memory.

JW: I thought Iâ€™d made some equivalent of how many floors the 250 feet was worth at the Kingdome. But in any case, I said that 13 or 14 floorsâ€¦ if you start looking around the site, is there anything thatâ€™s that tall?

GJ: No, but it didnâ€™t collapse in on its footprint either.

JW: True. Why didnâ€™t it?

GJ: Because it didnâ€™t.  Where did it collapse? It collapsed in a radius six times its footprint.

JW: Six times its footprint?
Misleading Argument #7: 

Woodâ€™s analysis is flawed since the WTC towers collapsed in a radius of about six times its footprint.  In contrast, the Kingdomeâ€™s debris collapsed within its footprint.[30] As a larger footprint would mean a larger distribution of debris, it would not be accurate to compare the example of the Kingdome to the WTC Towers.  Judy Wood never acknowledges this point in the interview, and evades questions that relate to this fact repeatedly.  As well, much of the debris from the WTC collapsed into the sublevelsâ€”as is typical in controlled demolition.

GJ: Yes.

JW: I think if you want to count its material itâ€™s probably likeâ€¦ a million times its footprint.  It went in the upper atmosphere. You know, where do you stop counting it? Is it a mile awayâ€”the dustâ€¦?
Evasion #6: 

Wood irksomely evades discussion of the debris field [see misleading argument #6 and #7] with her unproven interpretation/hypothesis that debris went into the â€˜upper atmosphereâ€™ during the collapse [misleading argument #8].
Misleading Argument #8: 

There is no evidence that any significant amount of dust â€œwent into the upper atmosphereâ€ during the collapse of the WTC towers as Wood claims, and she makes use of misleading interpretations of photos to support this theory and also misrepresents official USGS studies.[31]

 

GJ: You can take any kind of distribution you want. The rough radius roughly makes an area six times bigger, if you look at the debris coming down off of that building.

 

Comment: A scientist can speak of â€˜distributionsâ€™ and know what another scientist is saying.  In this case, a distribution is the precise form that the debris may be dispersed. For instance, a Gaussian distribution of debris would be a bell curve centered upon a tower, and the radius may be defined as either 1 or 2 standard deviations.  Another example could be an exponential distribution where the amount of debris tails off exponentially from the center of the tower, and the radius defined as the 1/e point. No matter what the distribution, one can always define a radius within which the majority of the debris from the towers is located.

JW: But what are you calling debris? Are you calling this Nano-particles?

GJ: Nano-particles?

Comment: Again, â€˜nano-particlesâ€™ is a nonsensical term in reference to the debris generated from the towers. Particle sizes on the scale of a nanometer (10-9 meters) are normally called â€˜elementsâ€™ and â€˜moleculesâ€™.

JW: The very fine, ultra-fine dust that was in the upper atmosphere for months.
Misleading Argument #9: 

Official studies indicate that â€œthe particles in greatest abundance (mass) in the dust were the unregulated supercoarseâ€”not the ultra-fine.â€[32]

GJ: The dust was an average of 70 microns large.

Comment: At the time, Dr. Jenkins was judging the average size of particles based upon dust samples from Lioy et al.[33] Debris captured during the collapse collected from Janette MacKinlayâ€™s apartment (113 Liberty Street just across from the South Tower) shows that 75% of the debris was larger than 1.3mm by weight thus suggesting that the average size particles are much larger than 70 microns.

JW: Which dust?

GJ: â€¦of all the dust that was sampled by USG.

JW: Did they sample the stuff in the upper atmosphere?
Misleading Argument #10: [see also #8]

As indicated below by Dr. Jenkins: â€œA lot of that (quite possibly all of it) was the oxygen-starved fire that was going up into the upper atmosphere.â€

GJ: I didnâ€™t see a lot of stuff go up into the upper atmosphere. I saw it all come down first, and then it spread out at that point.  So as itâ€™s coming downâ€¦

JW: Maybe you should review the pictures.

GJ: I have reviewed the pictures.
Misleading Argument #11:

It appears that Judy Wood needs to review the pictures.  One of the more common features of 9/11 misinformation/disinformation is the promotion of arguments that rely on misinterpretations of photographs.  This is yet another example of this phenomenon. 

These two photos are described in a letter publication (Introduction To An Interview With Dr. Judy Wood Conducted At The National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on January 10, 2007 Regarding The Use Of Directed Energy Beams In The Demolition Of The World Trade Center Towers).[34] Both pictures represent approximately the same instant in time of the collapse of the south tower. The picture on the bottom was presented to Dr. Judy Wood (minus the red labels) and was taken directly from her website.  It is a proclaimed â€˜favorite pictureâ€™, and is a point of discussion during the interview.  Dr. Judy Wood repeatedly points to the smoke emanating from the north tower as evidence for her argument that the south tower â€œfell upâ€.  However, the smoke was present before and during the collapse so could not be emanating from the south tower due to collapse.  This can be clearly seen in the above photo.[35] The photo on the left is used by Wood to suggest that debris from the South Tower is rising into the upper atmosphere, when in actual fact the photo above reveals that it is simply smoke from the North Tower.

JW: The video that I have of the Kingdomeâ€¦ where the roof height isâ€¦this is about the highest where the dust comes up (indicates). The thing goes â€˜poofâ€™, it goes down, it goes sideways. It doesnâ€™t go into the upper atmosphere. And if you look atâ€”well, even Jimâ€™s pictures he showed tonight. The â€˜fingersâ€™ coming up. They go up and up and up.

GJ: A lot of that was the oxygen-starved fire that was going up into the upper atmosphere, because it was there even before and during the collapse.

JW: There are some smoke bombs going off.

GJ: My point is not really what it was, but it was there before and after the collapse.

JW: After the quote, â€œcollapseâ€, you have this ultra-fine dust going into the upper atmosphere. How long does that oxygen-starved fire survive in the upper atmosphere?

GJ: How do you know it was ultra-fine dust and what do you mean by that?

JW: Why is it going up?

GJ: Because of the hot airâ€”itâ€™s not really the issue. Weâ€™re talking about the radius of the collapse field.

Comment: Dr. Judy Wood is literally attempting to argue that the WTC Towers fell up, not downâ€”an â€œanti-collapseâ€ theory.  In order for the buildings to fall up, the weight of the entire WTC Towers plus the modest increase in temperature of the air (which necessarily could not be that much since optical distortions are not visible during the collapse in video footage) would necessarily have to weigh less than the air it displaces, a provably absurd assertion.  This is the concept of buoyancy, a very basic physical principle.[36]

JW: Have you seen some of the satellite images?

GJ: Iâ€™ve got pictures right here, if youâ€™d like to see them.

JW: It goes over, maybeâ€”it covers the East Coast, the Eastern Seaboard.

GJ: Right. Eventually it does, because of diffusion, and just the heat of the energy being expelled will make that expand out. Now, if you look at this picture... itâ€™s taken off of your website.

JW: Thank you. This is a good example. Itâ€™s going straight up. Imagine that.

Comment: Wood is referencing the bottom photo indicated in misleading argument #11.  Wood is claiming here that debris from the South Tower is going up; when it actually appears to simply be smoke from the North Tower.   

GJ: That was smoke that was there before the collapse.

JW: What, down here on the fiftieth floor? The fortieth floor? I thought the fire was up at the eightieth floor.

GJ: I know all that dustâ€¦thatâ€™s  in that picture right thereâ€¦ that dust was there before the collapse, because thatâ€™s the smoke coming from the fire.

JW: But this (points to Bankerâ€™s Trust building) is a forty-story building, so this is emanating it appears from the fiftieth floor.

GJ: Whatâ€™s emanating form the fiftieth floor?

JW: The stuff thatâ€™s going up.

GJ: How do you know the stuff emanating from the fiftieth floor is going up?

JW: Itâ€™s not going down. Haha.

GJ: Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff going down in that picture, thatâ€™s my whole point.

JW: Youâ€™ve just gone around the circle. Youâ€™re saying it was there before the tower went â€˜poof?â€™ But the tower is in good condition up until about the seventieth floor or whatever it was.

GJ: It wasnâ€™t that high.

JW: I didnâ€™t see the fire down here.

GJ: Could we go back to the original point? I meanâ€¦

JW: But this is what youâ€™re asking about here.

GJ: Iâ€™m asking about the radius the debris falls on the ground.

JW: Wait a minute! Because this wasnâ€™t working for you, you wanted to change to another subject?
Evasion #7:

Ironically, Wood is the one who changed the subject in the first place and here implies that it was interviewer who wants to change the subject.  Ultimately, Jenkinsâ€™ question about the debris field remains unanswered in the interview.

GJ: No.

JW: Weâ€™ll stay with this one. Here the dust is going straight up.  Well, thatâ€™s where we came from because you were saying the dust all went straight down, and Iâ€™m saying the dust goes up, and Iâ€™m using this picture to emphasize that it goes up.  Hereâ€™s about where the fiftieth floor would be. If thatâ€™s a forty-storey building, the fiftieth floor is probably around there, and it looks like all the stuff coming up is coming from there.

GJ: (No reply)

JW: So whereâ€™s the rest of the building?

GJ: Well, Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t know.

JW: Oh, wait a minute, Youâ€™re saying it burned up, in four seconds? Five seconds?

GJ: I didnâ€™t say the building burned up. I said there was smoke from the fires that went up.

JW: But if there were some fires, fires were up here (indicates). This was fifty stories, so where would that make 110 stories, like up here? (indicates on the picture)

GJ: It wouldnâ€™t be that high, no.

JW: Well, we donâ€™t see the bottom of the building.

GJ: But you know roughly what the width of the building is, that ratio.

JW: Itâ€™s somewhere up here, off the page.

GJ: The width of the building is 200 meters and the height is like 1300 meters.[37]

JW: 1368. And we donâ€™t see the bottom here. The bottomâ€™s down there somewhere.  So, if this is a forty story building here, we donâ€™t see the bottom of the building. Itâ€™s probably about that big. Weâ€™re now up to the eightieth floor, so itâ€™s going to be about somewhere in there.  So if you have something up hereâ€”and thatâ€™s where the fire wasâ€”why is the smoke coming from down here?

GJ: I donâ€™t know why it is coming from down there.

JW: What about this part of the building (points to top)?

GJ: From that picture it looks like a lot of it goes down.

JW: Whereâ€™s it going down?

GJ: You donâ€™t see any parts of the building going down there?

JW: I see that we have about one third of the building left. Two thirds of the building is missing, and itâ€™s not in the volume of this â€˜snowballâ€™ as I call it, to account for two thirds of the building.
Misleading Argument #12:

 

Visual inspection shows that the volume occupied by the dust cloud is larger than the amount of building which is missing, and therefore the debris is less dense than the building:

For reference, use the top picture referenced in misleading argument #11. Look at one side of the south tower and estimate the volume occupied by the debris cloud on that side. For the south side of the south tower, the volume of the dust cloud is about 1 tower width x 1 tower deep x 1/5th the tower height.  Since there are 4 sides, the total volume occupied by the debris cloud is roughly estimated to be ~ 4/5 = 80% of the initial buildings volume. This is much larger than the 1/2 to 1/3rd of the building which is missing.  The volumetric change can be calculated as 4/5 / 1/2 = 8/5 ~ 160%. The debris cloud is appreciably less dense than the building since it occupies a larger volume than that previously occupied by the intact portion which is now gone.

GJ: Soâ€¦whatâ€™s going down? Is there any debris falling?

JW: I donâ€™t see anything thatâ€™s really falling there.

GJ: You donâ€™t see any debris falling from the building?

JW: I see a round snowball. I call this a snowball.

GJ: Okay, so thereâ€™s no debris falling in that picture.

JW: I didnâ€™t say no debris.

GJ: How much debris? What debris is falling in that picture?

JW: I see someâ€¦ I donâ€™t have a magnifying glass. Sorry!

GJ: Oh, itâ€™s that small you canâ€™t tell whatâ€™s falling from the picture?

JW: Below this point here (points to bottom of the snowball). I donâ€™t really see much difference. It looks like the building is in good health.  Thereâ€™s a little bit of cloud of haze there, butâ€¦ I donâ€™t see any major material and the building is still completely intact from this point down, at that moment, below the snowball.

GJ: So you really donâ€™t see any falling debris there?

JW: Are you asking these questions for sincere, honest purposes?

GJ: I really am. This is sincere. I see falling debris in that picture and Iâ€™m wondering, I just canâ€™t fathom why you donâ€™t see falling debris in that picture. Itâ€™s hard for me to understand. Because maybe I donâ€™t understand what youâ€™re trying to say.

JW: Iâ€™m not saying there is absolutely no debris, because someone may have had someâ€¦ pennies on their windowsill that fell out. They might be falling down. But itâ€™s not a significant volume of material.   The snowball here is aboutâ€¦ itâ€™s bigger than the width of the building, and about that same amount in height. So, itâ€™s a little bit wider so you canâ€™t say itâ€™s the density of the building.
Misleading Argument #13:

Judy Wood begins arguing, albeit in a very incoherent manner, that much of the debris from the collapsing tower necessarily â€˜shoots upâ€™ based upon the false premise that the volume of the dust cloud is too small to account for the missing part of the building.  This argument is misleading because skyscrapers are designed to be mostly empty space by volume.  When a skyscraper fully collapses, like WTC7, the debris is contained in a small pile many times smaller than its pre-collapse height. [38] It is false to assume that during the collapse the debris is necessarily less dense than the original skyscraper.  The manner in which the Twin Towers collapsed caused significant amounts of debris to eject laterally causing the debris cloud to occupy a larger volume than occupied by the initially intact portion of the WTC tower. 

GJ: No, you canâ€™t say itâ€™s the density of the building.

JW: Itâ€™s less dense, so weâ€™re missing two thirds of the building alreadyâ€¦

GJ: Yes.

JW: â€¦where did it go?

GJ: I donâ€™t knowâ€”I saw it go down, but maybe I donâ€™t remember seeing the videos right or something.

JW: I donâ€™t see it below that point.

GJ: Thatâ€™s because this is a picture shot before the whole building collapsed.  Itâ€™s during the collapse.

JW: Collapse? â€¦If it was a collapse I would expect to see the material piled up.  If it was literally a collapse, this is about two thirds of the building. How compact might that beâ€¦?

GJ: Remember the ratio of the building is 200 meters wide by 130 meters tall.[39]  OK.

JW: Correct. But you have this perspective of depth in the picture. Iâ€™m just going by this is a 40 story building, and its bottom is below the picture. Thatâ€™s 40 storiesâ€¦ so 110 is up to here. So between here and here you have a whole lot of building to account for.  And itâ€™ s 207 or 208 feet wide all the way up to that point, but itâ€™s still two-thirds of the height.

GJ: The width is two thirds of the height?

JW: No. The amount thatâ€™s missing is two thirds of the height.

GJ: OK . All right.

JW: Itâ€™s missing, and this snowball canâ€™t account for it all. Whereâ€™d it go?

GJ: Well, Iâ€™m not sure if that accounts for it all. I saw a lot of debris go down from that building, and based on that picture it seems plausible to me that most of the building is within that debris.  

Audience: Isnâ€™t there a pyroclastic flow that happened?

JW: It hasnâ€™t got down to any point to flow anywhere yet... Itâ€™s justâ€¦this material here is all thatâ€™s left, except for whatâ€™s going up. 

Audience: So is the pyroclastic flow included in the debris moving out?

JW: I wouldnâ€™t really call this a pyroclastic flow. I would call this explosions. This part of the building is being exploded out.

Audience: You were both disagreeing on the amount of debris, how far it went away.  I just wondered if you include that in the debris moving away from the towers?

JW: Iâ€™m saying thereâ€™s not much building left. Iâ€™m not saying exactly what radius it goes to. You have inch deep dust a mile or two away. Do you count that? It gets spread all over the place. But what I see in this picture is we donâ€™t have much building left, and it has yet to hit the ground.

Comment: It depends upon how you define your distribution, so yes, you can define a radius and decide whether you need to include the dust scattered a mile or two away. The vast majority of the building, however, fell well within an area defined by a radius 6 times its footprint.[40]

GJ: OK. (Searches through papers)

JW: Iâ€™m glad you brought this. This is my favorite picture.

GJ: Excellent. Iâ€™m glad. Well, I guess that accounts for why you put it on your website.  OK.  So, for any kind of beam weapon to annihilate the steel or anything like that, you would have to pump in a certain amount of energy to do that.

JW: It depends on what wavelength you use.

GJ: No. The energy doesnâ€™t depend on the wavelength.

Comment: The energy required to vaporize steel does not depend upon the form of energy. The form of energy will lead to differing degrees of loss which will increase the minimum energy requirements, but the amount of energy required to vaporize steel remains the same.

JW: It does to the extent of how efficient that energy is with that material.

GJ: OK.  All right, so if you pump in a laser to heat the building upâ€¦

JW: I Think how much energy it takes to heat a cup of coffee in my microwave, versus that same water on the stove.  Different amounts of energyâ€¦

GJ: True. Thatâ€™s because we know that the microwave is exciting the resonant energy of the water to heat your coffee.

JW: The heat is exciting the water too.

GJ: Right, but it still takes the same amount of energy to heat that coffee no matter how much energy you lose.

Comment: It takes a specific, definable amount of energy to heat a cup of coffee. This amount of energy is completely independent from the amount of energy you lose. This is normally inherently understood in a conversation between scientists.

JW: But itâ€™s a lot less efficient.

GJ: Okay. If you assume that you donâ€™t lose any energy at all, and you vaporize steel, you can calculate what energy is involved in vaporizing steel. It doesnâ€™t matter how you do it.

JW: Yes, it does.

GJ: No, that would only increase the number.

JW: How about if you heat the water up by putting a resistance across it versus putting a fire next to it?

GJ: The minimum amount of energy to evaporate a wire, by fire, by electric current, by anythingâ€¦

JW: Weâ€™re not talking about evaporation. This is like, kind of, being silly. You started out talking about dustification, then youâ€™re talking about beam energy, negative energy, then itâ€™s about vaporizationâ€¦

Comment: Straw man: Dr. Jenkins never talked about â€˜dustificationâ€™ since it is a fictitious vacuous term.

GJ: This is not me, this is from your website. Itâ€™s you saying these things.

JW: Iâ€™m taking about the data on my website. Iâ€™m not making calculations for how much it took for anything, as I donâ€™t think we should get distracted with thatâ€¦

GJ: Conservation of energy is not a distraction.

JW: (holding up photo of South Tower) Is this pulverized?

GJ: I see falling debris there, now, maybe itâ€™s not, maybe thatâ€™s a different picture of something else, I donâ€™t know.

JW: The building is pulverized, and you see when the story is over with at the end of the day, you donâ€™t have much building left, anywhere. The buildings are gone.  Letâ€™s look at Building Six for example. You get these big holes with nothing in them. Where did the material go?

GJ: If you melted down all the steel in theâ€¦

JW: Where did it go?

GJ: If you melt down all the steel in thatâ€¦

JW: Youâ€™ve changed the subject.

GJ: No, no, Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m really not. If you bear with me youâ€™ll see that Iâ€™m notâ€¦ in the top 110 floors of the building, if you melted down the steel into its footprint it would only be six feet tall. Thereâ€™d be one slab, the cross sectional area of the building six feet tallâ€¦

JW: How about the concrete?  How about the bookcases and so forth? Itâ€™d be more than six feet tall.

GJ: Not much. Not if you melted it all down.  Iâ€™m just saying that is the amount of steel.

JW: Is that what youâ€™re sayingâ€¦

GJ: Those buildings really were mostly empty space by volume, so you have to do some analysisâ€¦

JW: Is dust denser than solid steel or is it less dense?

GJ: Of course not. Itâ€™s much less dense.

JW: Okay, so how much do we have?

GJ: How much of what should we have?

JW: (no reply)

GJ: Of steel? Or of concrete?

JW: This is not productive. Itâ€™s not educational.

GJ: Itâ€™s educational for me.

JW: Whatâ€™s the subject now? Is it steel, is it concrete, or is it dust?

GJ: You choose. Please.

JW: This is a game youâ€™re playing.

GJ: Iâ€™m really not playing a game. Iâ€™m just trying to figure out what it is you had on your website. Iâ€™m just asking questions regarding it.

JW: What is your question? Ask the question, and we stay on that subject, through the whole sentence.  See if you can handle that.

GJ: The buildings collapsed in a larger area than their footprint.  Would you agree with that statement or not?

JW: No.
Evasion #8:

Wood continues to evade the main question here: did the debris from the buildings fall in an area larger than their footprint in contrast to her analysis of the Kingdome.  Instead of answering this question she debates the term â€œcollapseâ€:
Misleading Argument #14:

Dr. Wood boldly asserts that â€œThe Towers did not collapseâ€.  She states that the use of such terminology is â€œfalse, deceptive, and misleading.â€[41] One might agree only if the word was even slightly misused.  The definition of a â€˜collapseâ€™ is given by the American Heritage English Dictionary, Third Edition as:

Collapse (n.) 1. The act of falling down or inward, as from a loss of supports

2. An abrupt failure of function, strength, or health

The WTC towers fell down from a sudden loss of its supports suffering an abrupt failure of function and strength.  In the common vernacular, no mechanism need be specified in order to correctly utilize the word.  The collapse mechanism is precisely the topic currently being debated both within the 9/11 Truth movement and with NIST.  

Perhaps the reason why Judy Wood argues that the building did not â€œcollapseâ€ is because she argues that debris was sent into the â€˜upper atmosphereâ€™ during collapse.  If the â€œanti-collapseâ€ hypothesis is proven false (which is easily shown), then it is necessarily proven true that the WTC towers did indeed collapse. 

GJ: No?

JW: They did not collapse.

GJ: (Pause) How big was the debris field?

JW: We covered that already.
Evasion #9:

This topic was â€˜covered,â€™ but Wood never provided an answer to it.

GJ: What was your answer? I didnâ€™t catch it.

Comment from audience: Couldnâ€™t there be an answer that they collapsed and were pulverized at the same time? Both things happened?

JW: Thatâ€™s very misleading. â€œCollapseâ€.

GJ: Well, thank you, I really appreciate your time. Thank you very, very much for clarifying some of these issues. I certainly have learned a lot here. I think the people who will view this video will have learned a lot as well.

JW: To see how welcoming I am to questions? To playing games? Haha.

GJ: I donâ€™t think it was a game. It wasnâ€™t a game to me.  Soâ€¦but I do appreciate your time and your patience for answering my questions.  Thank you.

JW: Oh, you want that picture? Good.

GJ: Sure.

JW: Please study it.

After the interview:

GJ: â€œI was just trying to see what kind of scientific basis this was inâ€¦ and I think I found out.â€[42]

[15] Jenkins, The Overwhelming Implausibility of DEW, pages 5, 9. â€œIf you take into account losses from scattering and absorption in the atmosphere, reflection by aluminum and steel in the building, and inefficiencies from storing this huge amount of energy and generating photons, then the power required swells to at least thousands of earths worth of power. The scenario becomes more bleak when considering beams of particles that have mass since the ionization energies required would add massive amounts of energy in conjunction with the aforementioned inefficienciesâ€¦The power required to evaporate the steel in one of the WTC towers is astronomically large. To get a feel for the huge size of this number, we will compare to the largest laser in the western hemisphere, the MIRACL laser... we would need 57 million MIRACL lasers of power!â€

[20] The reflectivity of steel in the microwave spectrum is over 99.9%. For comparison, a very good bathroom mirror (usually made from a thin coating of aluminum on glass) is only about 93% reflective in the visible spectrum. The reason that people should not place metallic objects in the microwave is because the near perfect reflection can cause damage to the microwave source oscillator.

[21] http://physics.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics7/Notes_www/node6.html  â€œThere is a very important characteristic of a scientific theory or hypothesis which differentiates it from, for example, an act of faith: a theory must be â€˜falsifiableâ€™. This means that there must be some experiment or possible discovery that could prove the theory untrue.â€

[22] This is worth trying if you havenâ€™t already.  However, only leave it in for a few seconds or you will begin to burn/melt the plastic substrate which may possibly contain toxic fumes.

[23] For instance, this effect is used in arc-welding (using energy in the form of plasma).

[24] Jenkins misspoke here: he should have said â€˜â€¦and the paper in the towel does not absorb microwaves.â€™

[25] This mechanism is simple. Water has an electric dipole moment. In the microwave spectral region, the water molecule tends to align with the electric field. Since the electric field is flipping up and down rapidly, the water will flip up and down at the same frequency. That is, the electromagnetic radiation will cause the water molecule to â€˜spinâ€™. This causes localized movement of atoms in the vicinity of the water, which is synonymous with increasing the temperature. Thus, your food is heated up by jostling the water molecules.

[26] â€˜Some kind of energyâ€™ is much too vague for substantive discussion. Exciting an element (as opposed to molecules or solids) is generally understood by scientists to mean exciting the electrons to higher energy states associated with that element.

[27] To excite electrons in an atom, the energy required depends upon the specific element as well as the particular electronic states associated with the element. However, scientists frequently speak in terms of â€˜scalesâ€™ when speaking in general terms. For instance, the scale associated with the amount of energy in food is â€˜hundreds of caloriesâ€™. The scale used when speaking about the energy required to excite electronic states in elements is â€˜an eVâ€™, electron volts. A single eV equals 3.9 x 10-20 calories.

 

Excitations in solids with a crystalline type substrate, where a regularly repeating lattice may be defined, is discussed in terms of the â€˜energy bandsâ€™. That is, all the electronic states from the singular elements which make up the lattice overlap and add up in such a way as to form continuous energy bands. Some electrons become mobile described by the â€˜conduction bandâ€™ within metals and are (more or less) free to flow through out the solid. This is why current flows in metals like the copper wires in your house.

 

Excitation of phonons, or crystal lattice vibrations, is the only way to dissociate steel. This may be accomplished, for instance, by applying a current to steel, and the electrons in the conduction band scatter off of, say, imperfections in the crystalline structure causing phonon excitations. Similarly, electromagnetic radiation may be absorbed by conduction band electrons which can excite phonon modes in a similar manner. Once the vibrational modes of the lattice are excited to a large extent (synonymous with â€˜highâ€™ temperature), then the steel will dissociate. To dissociate steel in this manner will require at least the minimal amount of thermal energy required (>5 earths worth of power).
