         NOVA investigates the mysterious feathered dinosaurs          
         that are challenging old ideas about the origin of bird       
         flight. Top paleontologists, aeronautical engineers and       
         paleo-artists reconstruct the microraptor and build a         
         sophisticated model for a wind tunnel experiment. The         
         results have surprising implications for long-accepted        
          ideas about how winged flight began.
