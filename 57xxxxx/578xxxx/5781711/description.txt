ABOUT THE ARTIST:

Chad Beloin is a Pop/Hip-Hop/R&B/Rap artist from North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada. With numerous mixtapes including \\\"How Right\\\", \\\"Seasons\\\", \\\"Revival\\\", \\\"Beloin\\\", \\\"Rehab\\\", \\\"Rehab: Revisited\\\", \\\"Rehab: Certified\\\", \\\"Rehab: Reunion\\\", \\\"Unforgettable\\\", and \\\"House Arrest\\\", plus two albums, \\\"The Long Road Home\\\"- released 2007, and \\\"Home Free\\\"- released 2010, and working on a new 3 piece album for 2011, \\\"Deep Into The Life of Chad Beloin\\\", Chad Beloin is a hard-working, dedicated artist, and stays true to the game, all the while dealing with everyday trials and tribulations.

AN ADDITION FROM THE TORRENT UPLOADER:

Chad Beloin became a highly controversial independent artist in 2010 when he claimed he worked with producers Timbaland, Red One, and JR Rotem. He later admitted it was a publicity stunt.

Other than those rumours, Chad Beloin\\\'s entire career is 100% true, about his Deep Into The Nation Tour, I know it\\\'s happening because I\\\'ve got tickets to the first show, plus I\\\'ll definitely be watching the Livestream performance. I hope he finds this, cause if he does, Chad, please don\\\'t delete this... it\\\'s going to do you a HUGE favor, as well as, could you please do a few rehearsals on Livestream? I\\\'d love to watch!

ABOUT THE TORRENT:

This torrent includes Chad Beloin\\\'s albums \\\"Home Free: Deluxe Edition\\\" and \\\"Deep Into The Life of Chad Beloin Part One\\\". In addition, it includes the mixtape \\\"Love Is Us\\\", and Chad Beloin\\\'s resource album, \\\"Love Is Us Instrumentals\\\". I will modify this torrent as I get more Chad Beloin tracks.
