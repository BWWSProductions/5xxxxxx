Faith School Menace?
More4 21.00 18.08.10

The number of faith schools in Britain is rising. Around 7,000 publicly-funded
schools - one in three - now has a religious affiliation.

As the coalition government paves the way for more faith-based education by
promoting 'free schools', the renowned atheist and evolutionary biologist
Professor Richard Dawkins says enough is enough.

In this passionately argued film, Dawkins calls on us to reconsider the
consequences of faith education, which, he argues, bamboozles parents and
indoctrinates and divides children.

The film features robust exchanges with former Secretary of State for Education
Charles Clarke, Head of the Church of England Education Service Reverend Janina
Ainsworth, and the Chair of the Association of Muslim Schools, Dr Mohammed
Mukadam.

It also features insights from child psychologists and key players in faith
education as well as insights from both parents and pupils.

Dawkins also draws on his own personal history as a father, arguing that the
government must stop funding new faith schools, and urges society to respect a
child's right to freedom of belief.
