The Orpheus is mended, and the captain wants the crew to find more of the rare 
bio-fuel samples before they return to the surface. The Russian captain has 
other ideas, however, and instructs his men to kill the crew. In their struggle 
to escape, some are left behind; will they be able to complete their mission?
