FUCK 3LI HE IS JUST TOO RUDE FOR SOME REASON
I DONT LIKE HIS ATTITUDE WITH PEOPLE ON PIRATEBAY BUT YOU POPPERDART YOUR THE NXT SECRETMYTH BRO IM TELLIN YA KEEP IT UP :)"
,rakz2cul,2010-08-23T03:21Z,damn right pizzahut123... poppedtart is the next SECRETMYTH and quality is far more superior than SECRETMYTH...although i don't like the fact of including 2 channel audio...it would be better if that much amount of Mb is allotted to video or 5.1 audio specs...keep up the good work bro   
,rakz2cul,2010-08-23T03:28Z,have one kind request to you poppedtart...if possible keep every movie file more 3.5gb as it enriches the video specs
,noOrp,2010-08-23T11:00Z,"Thanks , PT ! :D
"
[V],poppedtart,2010-08-23T17:57Z,"@rakz2cul the releases are all the same quality.  The only reason this is 3.54gb is due to run time.  They all have same bit rate and encoding process.  The audio tracks will not change.  The audio tracks and everything about this release is to conform to Apple standards.  They are 100% compatible with Xbox and PS3 and most media devices.

,biorisk,2010-08-23T22:40Z,"I just sat down to watch this and about 20 minutes into it I got a message that says something like ""the content being played is protected by cinavia"" and the sound is muted.  I can continue to watch the movie in 10 second intervals if i back out of the movie and pick up where I left off.  But the message just seems to come back.  After doing some research it turns out that this is a new type of audio device safety being used by film makers to stop piracy.  If no one else is having this problem please let me know, maybe it is just me.  Thanks!"
,biorisk,2010-08-23T22:59Z,oh yeah watching on ps3
,biorisk,2010-08-24T01:33Z,No problems using Quick Time.
,rakz2cul,2010-08-24T01:56Z,hey poppedtart i am glad that you find some time for reply after so much of hard work...my suggestions were only for the large screen LCD...never mind not every movie worth spending huge gbs of download...i wish i could put same amount of effort that you are giving to upload this files...keep up the good work bro

Had the same thing happen to me, also on a PS3.  Is there anything that can be done?  Thanks for all you do!"
,Tony2324,2010-08-30T23:21Z,"hey this might sound stupid, but ive downloaded about all of your movies, love them, but i am having a very hard time playing the srt subtitle files in my itunes movie libary, i have over 40 movies, and about 10 of them require subtitles, including this one. I tryed a program called videodrive, which lets you import movies to itunes, but thru that program, so it will let you import srt files, the problem is, if i try to do it on any of your movies, it wont work, probley because they are protected somehow, so that information on them cant be changed, please help me try and get subtitles to play in itunes on this movie,   ps i have a mac book pro, the newest one, with a i7 processor and yeah well it can play these movies bacicaly, "
,livefree68,2010-09-01T12:14Z,"Thanks for the up as well as the whole movie PT!
Great flick!
Awesome quality!
Nice work m8!"
[V],poppedtart,2010-09-02T01:49Z,subtitles are already embedded in the movie.  select them in itunes.  srt external subs are only provided if someone wants to use them somehow.
