Dub Side of the Moon is a dub reggae tribute to the Pink Floyd album, The Dark Side of the Moon, co-produced by Easy Star All-Stars founder's Michael G (Michael Goldwasser) and Ticklah (Victor Axelrod) [1]. Included with the liner notes are instructions on how to synchronize the album with the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and produce a variation of the perceived "Dark Side of the Rainbow" effect.

Outside the standard reggae beat and instruments used on the album there are several interesting changes made:

    * The climax of "Speak to Me" now features the coughing from "Money", reggae wailing and someone making the sound of the grinding machine from the original version of the song with their lips.
    * The final track of the original album, "Eclipse," has been changed to a standard 4/4 beat to avoid the need to introduce triple-meter, a rhythm not native to reggae.
    * The cash register opening and closing on "Money" is changed to a man lighting a bong, the bong being ripped, and the man coughing.
    * A cuckoo clock is added to the clocks at the beginning of "Time", as is a digital clock, a rooster, and "Reveille" being played on a trumpet.
    * Several of the songs feature extensive improvisation over the instrumentals.

Also, while not a change to the album itself, the tracklisting was given four more tracks. All of these are dubs, or remixes, of tracks on the album, with "Step It Pon The Rastaman Scene" being the most far removed.
