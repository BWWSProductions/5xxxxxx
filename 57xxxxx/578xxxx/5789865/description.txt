Cliff Mummies of the Andes

This documentary is the second to chronicle the discovery of an ancient tomb in Peru. This episode joins up with Keith Muscutt of the University of California at Santa Cruz, as he unwraps the mummies of the Chacopayan tomb his team found years before in the Andes. Bureaucratic red tape delayed the analysis, which now proceeds with the latest technology and spectacular results. Interviews with archaeologists and descendants of their 1,000-year-old ancestors are presented, along with artifacts, archival film clips, and photographs.
