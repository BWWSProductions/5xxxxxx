,Weslee54,2010-08-23T00:12Z,"I will definitely seed this for a while, at least until we get a better copy. Thanks froggie100 for getting one in English"
,Odd[x],2010-08-23T03:01Z,"So for the 17 minutes that are in Russian, is there English subtitles? If someone can respond that would be great! THANKS!"
,LucanDesmond,2010-08-23T03:15Z,NOT ENGLISH!!! DAMNIT!
,williambuttface,2010-08-23T04:32Z,"Yeah, the first 17 minutes is russian, then after that it's english. But, you can hear assholes talking. Like, when Scott's sister calls him to confront the 17 year old girlfriend, some dude says 'got laid' and obnoxious laughing. Good picture though!"
,esquire64,2010-08-23T04:49Z,"audio is really really bad, also there's someone carrying on a conversation during the film.
I'd suggest waiting for a better copy."
,axfelix,2010-08-23T07:42Z,"the audio improves considerably after the first 10-15 minutes or so, but the lapse into Russian around the 1 hour mark happens to obscure the funniest confrontation and most of the major plot points, so if you aren't familiar with the source material (or willing to look up a paragraph summary on Wikipedia of what you're watching and missing, like I did), ymmv with this one. still, thanks for the dubbing!"
,AWD1138,2010-08-23T13:13Z,"Yup, don't waste your time with this download. About a 3rd of the movie is in Russian and the rest has some dumb asses comments and laughter at every little thing being said. example...movie dialog then some moron saying HAH or AH HAH every single time anything at all is being said.
Either the guy with the cam was a total idiot or he sat next to ""that guy"" in the theater. picture quality is okay but the audio makes it a total waste of space and time."
