,mail4upasi,2010-08-25T20:44Z,Guys A V??
,shredmastah1,2010-08-25T22:47Z,Does this version have english text or still the 1/2 russian version? Thanks
,kidrocku,2010-08-26T01:42Z,dude you are epic. thanks much for this. the russian text is disappointing but the audio is about a 8/10 and the video is a 9/10. overall great torrent. thanks for uploading.
,shredmastah1,2010-08-26T03:06Z,"For anyone wondering. This is still that same 1/2 russian 1/2 english version. All the important text throughout the movie is in russian =.= BUT the a/v is definitely a lot better than the previous versions.
a=8/v=7 "
,shredmastah1,2010-08-26T03:08Z,Text is still russian zz why cant anyone get a full english :( anyway audio:8 video:7 Thanks for the upload
,MeltedGummybear,2010-08-26T03:08Z,"Worth the download, dubbed over russian.
But at some points the audio BLOWS!
Thanks anyways SoftWarez!"
,6adrian9,2010-08-26T07:03Z,Pretty good M:7 A:4 V:7
,oehmer,2010-08-26T13:05Z,"Video: 8
Audio: 4
Theres some strange background noises after about 30 minutes in along with some distortion, which carries on for pretty much the rest of the film.  The writing on the screen is Russian."
,klisk,2010-08-27T02:51Z,"Just for the record, this rip is hit with the Cinavia watermark -- So it won't play on PS3."
,amp_man,2010-08-27T09:32Z,"Audio really kills the movie. There's one battle where about 90% of it is pure static. German wording really sucks too. Thanks for the up, now just gotta find time to catch it in theaters."
,shazza96,2010-08-27T17:46Z,"why is it russian, why doesnt anyone have it in english ?"
,thedecking,2010-09-22T19:32Z,"EPIC EPIC MOVIE!!!

I actually went to the cinema and paid to see this one, well worth the money.  I got that same feeling I had the first time I saw the matrix, it just blows your mind.  You will have never seen a movie like this before."
,Amaximus,2010-09-25T15:50Z,People keep telling me this is good - so for I'll wait until there is a better rip or go see it in the theater.
,Inpachi,2010-10-04T18:02Z,Meh i can wait another month for a DVD rip....
