AUDIO:Our Own 

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Scott Pilgrim vs The World

Right we need to clear up a few things first so you know whats what ,hence the readnfo tag.
Reason for the tag is because of the audio.....yes it's line but it has faults 
One contained alot of background noise and theres also some audio drops around 4-5 that last no longer than 1 sec each 
But the main issue is that if you listen clearly you can hear another film in the background ....don't ask what happen 
However we have cleaned up the audio the best we could and tried to remove as much background as we could .....overall for line audio,
not the best but better cam.
Now the video.......well the video is missing 3mins 2 secs off the begining nothing else.....but it's the only source out to date so .
Also the video isn't the best all .The source file was cropped,filmed at a angle,really dark,colours whacked etc....
Yet again we've tried to fix the problems we could......we didn't mess with the angles etc..not worth it on such a low quality cam.However with fixed the
colours and also made it brighter.
Got to be honest and even after fixing it the film is still dark and dull looking......increasing the colours much more gave it this weird affect and making it 
brighter only made it look more grey and didn't seem to do much.

Anyway enjoy,until we get a new source
