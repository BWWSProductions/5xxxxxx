i may need your help though:

Every time I installed to a hp pavillion, after the format and the first copy of files goes to a nicer graphically speaking enviroment and continues to copy windows files.
Then at 13% states that:
ERROR DURING EXECUTION:
""VC2005SP1\vcredist.msi /quiet/norestart"" could not be found.

I click ok and everything goes well without any problems but, what is this could cause problems later. Should I do smth?? 
"

,MJKW2Ab,2010-09-12T05:28Z,"I fix computers for money, yet something as me very confused. After ruining hard drive programs like SpinRite and hd Regeneration, fdisk /mbr, fdisk delete partition and create partition I can not seem to find anyway to get a WinXP disc to recognize the HD and format the partition. Neither can I find the correct way/disc to run fdisk from... Wow I have a mess. Does anybody know the best way of partitioning and formating a 160 gig hard drive for Windows XP - I would use Windows 7 but the RAM is only 512.

Thanks"

,SAMIAM72,2010-09-19T18:46Z,Yikes! do i want to set up windows xp on partition 2 or partition 1. partition 2 is my (recovery) FAT 32 it says with 3478 MB free space and Partition 1 is (NTFS) with232966 MB free space. What do I do?  Anybody.... Thank you.

Any suggestions?
,sneackan,2010-09-22T00:56Z,"Hi. Thank you for this great peice of work. I've ran into something that's troubling me just a bit. I installed it and everything went smooth and been running it for a few weeks now, everything worked like a charm the first two weeks or so, then all of a sudden i started getting lag spikes even when  just flicking my mousepointer at my desktop, sometimes without any additional software running, but especially when like loading a software and sometimes playing games and such. If i haven't made myself clear in any way or lack of information i'll be glad to update. But if anyone have encountered the same issue or similar and if you came up with an solution for it, i would be greatful if you could share it (: Thanks"
,lenith,2010-09-23T03:12Z,"It just installed smoothly, after installing it i installed my Antivirus, It alarmed 2 files as Virus:

1. HiddenFiles.dll - C:\Windows\System32\ShellExt\HiddenFile.dll

2. FileExt.dll - C:\Windows\System32\ShellExt\FileExt.dll

Any Suggestion?"

,ftpcasper,2011-03-17T20:45Z,"trying to install this particular image in VMware ... and by the looks of it there coming down on scurity quiet alot out of 5 acclaimed ""NO-KEY""  &  ""Fully Activated""

asked for serial


Direct and physical what i call booting as in actuallygoing to mount and use from primary drive, i have no idea of the outcome... will try when i get a chance....
however if there is any other freak who just likes to watch the blue installation, becarfull of your boot environment... (imagine trying to deploy one of these images over cable!)
& with the ammount of bugs you get youd die!

Anyway,
Dear Stun, (hopfully the guy who uploaded)
do you have serial for this particular copy?
or is there a way of contact the author M Brian???


(if you go thru a few copies of xp or Debug for a living, try VMware....This is not spam! its free advice and a list of questions that want answering)
