Please will you reseed the following, paying particular attention to the two identical torrents that point to the same file (see ** below)

The.X.Factor.s01.e09.Top.9.Performances.VeroVenlo.avi (448,136 KB)
The.X.Factor.s01.e11.Top.7.Performances.VeroVenlo.avi (448,410 KB)
**The.X.Factor.s01.e13.Top.5.Results.VeroVenlo.avi (actually Performances 447,986 KB)Please leave this as is with incorrect file name.
**The.X.Factor.s01.e13.Top.5.Results.VeroVenlo.avi (269,394 KB)**
The.X.Factor.s01.e14.Top.4.Results.Performances.avi (346,007 KB)
The.X.Factor.s01.e15.Top.3.Performances.verovenlo.avi (359,454 KB)
The.X.Factor.s01.e15.Top.3.Results.VeroVenlo.avi (255,942 KB)
The.X.Factor.s01.e16.Top.2.Performances.VeroVenlo.avi (719,314 KB)
The.X.Factor.s01.e16.Final.avi (179,276 KB)"
,asighkick,2010-08-26T07:58Z,"**Please upload a new copy of The.X.Factor.s01.e13.Top.5.Results.VeroVenlo.avi (269,394 KB) putting the file inside a folder so that the results file doesn't cancel out the actual Performances file.  Two IDENTICAL .torrent files can co-exist since uTorrent will add (1) to the duplicate .torrent.  Unfortunately, it doesn't do that with the actual file and tries to write two into one file!

Thanks for your uploads."
,asighkick,2010-08-26T08:04Z,p.s. it may pay to delete the original torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5415187/The.X.Factor.s01.e13.Top.5.Results.VeroVenlo (263.08 MiB) since downloading this will mess up the other file of the same name.
