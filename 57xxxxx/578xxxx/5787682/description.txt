Rx NOTES
-----------------
Video Source: Russian Silver [THANKS to Cristal!]
Audio Source: Our Own 

Well we started off by going through and creating our own sub file for the Non-English speaking parts. Hard Coded them in Yellow. For the video, we resized, sharpened a little, adjusted the colors (reducing the red quite a bit), denoised, etc. Then we Synced, Filtered and Muxed our own audio to our Encode. Audio came out pretty good, had some clipped peaks that needed fixed, other than that didn't need to do much. There is one spot that we noticed was slightly oos, however it only last for about 2sec max, so we left it alone. Enjoy!=]
