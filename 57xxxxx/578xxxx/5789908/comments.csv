,omegafox84,2010-08-28T10:03Z,"i'd like to see that Jerry Seinfeld dvd too. also, would like to request a few myself: Battle Royale II, Perfect Blue, & Paprika. there are many others but those are the ones i want to see the most.

,simpson_d,2010-08-29T04:37Z,hay help seed this please and i will chech it out thank you
,jackalope77,2010-08-30T08:57Z,"@omegafox84: Paprika and Perfect Blue may well show up on future releases, as both are great movies.  Too bad director Satoshi Kon just died so he wont be able to make more.  Check out his Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers (my fave) if you get a chance.  I was also considering Battle Royale , so keep your eyes open.  And I will do the Seinfeld concert, I cant imagine its a very big disc.  I wish I had more bandwidth!"
,jackalope77,2010-08-30T08:58Z,@tater44: Thanks amigo!
,omegafox84,2010-08-31T02:54Z,that's depressing to hear about Satoshi Kon. we're very fortunate to be able to see his work. i've only seen Perfect Blue and it was so awesome. a friend has both Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers so i'll definitely check them out.
,cphan,2010-09-02T00:39Z,I like to request Troy: Directorâs Cut. Finding this Director Cut is hard as hell. Would greatly appreciate it.
,jackalope77,2010-09-05T10:39Z,"@cphan: As much as I'd love to help you out with the Troy DC, which is awesome by the way, it is one of those movies that goes across 2 discs, and I have only limited badwidth.  If a lot of people requested it and promised to seed, I could do it then, perhaps."
,cphan,2010-09-05T17:37Z,aww okay thanks for letting me know. I got the regular edition but been trying to get the Directors Cut and its hard as hell. And I'm one of the few that really like Troy. lol.
