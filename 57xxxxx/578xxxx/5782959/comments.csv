,benlro1,2010-08-22T15:57Z,Is there no way to change the font size in this game? I lowered my resolution all the way down to 1024x768 and it's still barely readable.
,JesShare,2010-08-22T18:00Z,"This is a poor rip. The font is like 6 point font. Screenshots from the current retail version of the game show a much larger font. Plus there seems to be some various loading errors where the game can't find different shaders (making many ships look pitch black)

Must be missing some registry entries."
,D0gmeat,2010-08-22T21:40Z,Does anyone have the full version?
,JesShare,2010-08-23T00:18Z,"to fix the fonts, go to your fonts folder in star ruler and rename frank_goth_med_10_nice.xml to default.xml

There are many missing shader files with this release. They might have gotten the bugged copy from DD sites before they had a chance to update it."
,dd__66,2010-08-23T05:26Z,"Seriously, shame on you asshole for pirating this! They are two guys! Not a big compnay. How do you expect the game to get better with this kind of shit?"
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-08-23T06:31Z,"@dd__66 boohooo! stop crying! 

For those who want to support this software go and buy full version here : 
http://starruler.blind-mind.com

Hopefully dd__66 will forgive me now :("
,dracobs,2010-08-23T17:02Z,"Altough we do appreciate thw work of the developers, an upload with all the files would be even more appreciated. Thanks for uploading this anyway, keep up the good work."
,alpha118,2010-08-24T11:45Z,"Thanks for this

anyone have the latest update 1.0.0.2

or even 1.0.0.4


regards"
,toruserx,2010-08-26T02:17Z,"for those who need patch:
http://patches.gamersgate.com/SR_v1.0.0.0-v1.0.0.2_2.exe

hope someone will upload missing shaders and two icons,until then to have visible ships turn off shaders in graphics
"
,thisismylongnickname,2010-08-28T04:16Z,"I understand this rip is missing some stuff.

Hope someone will release the full / proper rip so that we can use the patches which are now hosted directly at the star ruler site."
,desertlizard,2010-09-11T17:42Z,"Haha! Yeah real class act release. Even one the devs (or mods) said on Blind Mind forums that all it takes to copy and spread this is to pack the files in an archive and upload, and that he couldn't understand how someone could've fumbled with this, since they're well aware about the pirated release having the small font issue, and yes, that's ONLY with the pirated release.

Anyway, this game is far from being complete, even at 1.0.0.8. The game is stable but there are a craplod of quirks and bugs that ruin the gameplay. There's a ton of potential though. I hope they actually finish this."
,Valmarith,2010-09-18T14:17Z,"I just wanted to try it before I bought it, it's a good game well worth the modest price. Guys get on Impulse and buy this.

Keep Art Alive!"
,PPG113,2010-09-21T08:21Z,"Way to be a faggot. Packed all the files in an exe, then chopped that into rar files, then compressed each rar into a zip. That makes the final file size BIGGER retard. Exe extracts to the folder you ran it from and just places the files there. Next time have it make its own folder to place all the shit in it by default. Also, DONT FORGET THE Fing SHADERS... worst release ever on tpb."
,CornishCal,2010-09-21T18:12Z,"I agree with dd__66, this isn't EA its four guys making their first game. They barely have enough money to finish it so patches are constantly being released untill at least next year. Its just ĂÂŁ13, im off to buy it, i hope some of you do the same. This is not what piracy is about for me."
,PPG113,2010-09-23T04:55Z,"So I have attempted to create a torrent with the missing shaders, font, images and ect. Anyone care to give it a go? http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5846650 first torrent attempt, not sure if its done correctly..."
,Judas101,2010-09-23T05:54Z,Can anyone tell me how to get the patches to install properly?  currently I have the game in a download dir so the path is different and every time I try to browse the installation it won't let me press install.  I really want to try this game out.
,PPG113,2010-09-23T06:20Z,I renamed the folder Star Ruler and placed it in my program folder. Didnt have any trouble installing the 4 patches..
,GrimNoc,2010-10-02T07:35Z,"Yah, sorry, indie games this good deserve to be purchased. Just bought a vanilla visa card from the corner store, gonna buy it now."
,mercury2100,2010-10-13T04:22Z,"- Shame isn't in the uploading. Without uploads as such, there would be too little of publicity and advertisings.

- Shame isn't in the downloading. Without downloads (ratings especially), others will not know how good this application / game is. Neither will we really get to 'test' the claim of popularity. afterall, Seeing is believing.

- Shame IS however in NOT supporting the developers after downloading and finding out what a great application / games these developers made. Oh, sure... we all 'do' give 'moral support'. But talk is cheap. 

Instead of 'crying wolf' or 'finger pointing incessantly with a holier than thou art attitude' - Please do perform our own responsibilities FIRST - Buy a copy of their application/game if anyone is serious about supporting the developers, since not every developer have financial budgets and/or time to promote their product (application/game) as wide spread, as quickly as possible - without the acclaimed pirates assistances.

ps  To expect the mega corporations to sincerely help out these upcoming promising developers, would be like expecting big time politicians to commit to good deeds. It's bad for business to let new comers (not in their control) into the market - less of the market's profit cake to gain."
,Judas101,2010-10-14T09:15Z,"I don't write comments very often, consider me the silent majority, but this time I have to say BRAVO!!  as soon as I've got the cash I will track this game down and purchase it... can I get it at a computer game store?? I don't have credit cards or paypal.  Is it avaliable in stores??  Anyone know?"
,Sanic7,2010-12-06T22:22Z,"Can someone write up steps on how to get this up and running including the patch, I know How use power iso and mount and cracks but when ever I DL a torrent and it was a bunch of copys of a zip file I just delete the whole thing its too confusing... 

or someone re upload with a better and easier format and Ill seed forever, game looks cool from the utube video I saw so i would very much like to play.

thanks -Sanic"
,dubbman,2011-01-21T04:09Z,"if you want to try the game there is an official demo out now.. and since the game has been updated considerably since this poorly done rip, the demo will most likely be more playable then this version, with a LOT more features.

version 1.0.5.2 released 1/17/11  adding a civ creator and other features. "
,thorkis420,2011-05-06T07:38Z,What kinda crap is this? extracted and came up with 2 files. So the  zip files arent linked. extracted next one and came up with 2 more files. Looked at the rest. They are all the same. .Diz w/e the hell that kinda file is. Learn to put things in iso. or even winrar for gods sake. worst piece of crap scam ever. Some sort of newb trying to give a virus out or something.
,KaziArmada,2011-09-29T10:04Z,"Whatever moron ripped this needs to learn how to internet, as it's pretty obvious that they DON'T know what the fuck they're doing.

That said, I hope this games good...If it is, I'm buying it soon as my next paycheck comes in. Hell, if not for being limited on cash I'd buy it outright but...Hey...We do what we can."
