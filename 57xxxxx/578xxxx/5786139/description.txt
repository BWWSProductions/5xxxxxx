Nightmare House 2 is a free, horror-themed first-person-shooter game, and the direct successor of the first classic horror map pack "Nightmare House". Nightmare House 2 is based on the Source Engine by Valve, also considered a modification (mod) made for Half Life: Episode 2.

The story resumes with the player lost and confused in a hospital known as "Never Lose Hope". With no understanding of how you came to be there, there's only a vague memory of the mysterious, haunting girl from Nightmare House. Soon it will be difficult to determine between a dream and reality. How long will it take you to realize that escape is not an option?

This torrent is the .rar of the Mod files, how to install:
IMPORTANT: This modification requires a registered Steam client with Half Life 2: Episode Two installed.
Extract the folder "NH2" with all its contents to your SourceMods folder e.g C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\SourceMods\
If you do not know how to extract a .rar archive you can open them with programs such as WinRar or 7-Zip, these can be freely downloaded off the internet. WinZip will NOT work.
If \SourceMods\ folder does not exist under your \Steam\steamapps\ folder, create it. 
You should now have Steam\steamapps\SourceMods\NH2\ as a folder with the file "GameInfo.txt" inside it.
Restart Steam and Nightmare House 2 should appear in your game list.

If the above steps are too hard for you, please get the .exe install version (http://nh2.wecreatestuff.com/#downloads) - the .exe version is also on my account if you prefer to get it from there.


Please enjoy this game!
