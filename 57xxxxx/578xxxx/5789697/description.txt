This is a collection of all 5 games from Monkey Island series.

Installation of each game and the games themselves have
been modified to work weather you are running XP or 7,
with 32 or 64 bit architecture.

I tested every game on Windows 7 x64 and each worked flawlessly.

For your convenience I included ReadMe.txt file for each game.
These files contain simple instructions what to do in order to setup each game.

Included games are:
- The Secret of Monkey Island (Special Edition)
- Monkey Island 2: LeChuck\'s Revenge (Special Edition)
- Monkey Island 3: The Curse of Monkey Island
- Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island
- Tales of Monkey Island (Deluxe Edition)

All games are in ISO file format, so you\'ll need software like
DAEMON Tools in order to mount them and start the installation.

You can get DAEMON Tools Lite from here:

Any feedback is welcome, weather it\'s a compliment or complaint.
Even a simple \'Thanks\' will do.

Please, help me with initial seeding of this baby.

Enjoy everyone.
