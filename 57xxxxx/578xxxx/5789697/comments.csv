,killhhax,2010-08-26T19:52Z,Nice upload. However Im running vista. Been looking for the Curse of Monkey Island for ages but none ever work on Vista. Do these work for Vista? Thanks.
,Eqa5cro,2010-08-27T03:09Z,"All of them should work on Vista just fine.
I have a very slow upload and initial seeding is a bit of a problem.
It might take some time for you to download this one."
,killhhax,2010-08-27T04:20Z,Ok thanks. Its second in the queue right now but once it finishes downloading I'll seed as much as possible.
,Eqa5cro,2010-08-27T09:44Z,Thank you. I hope you won't give up on it when you see how slow the download speed is. :p
,cpark1978,2010-08-30T21:09Z,dont download this. everyone is stuck on 33% and poster is not seeding
,halvhjearne,2010-08-31T23:26Z,come on man ... at least seed till someone else got it?
,Eqa5cro,2010-09-01T01:40Z,"Guys, wtf, I'm seeding all the time at the maximum speed my upload can achieve!
I can't make it go faster... If you are unhappy with the speed, just leave it... :(

18 hours from now, there will be one more seeder with better upload then me.
I won't stop seeding this until it takes of, you have my word on that."
,trickykid27,2010-09-03T19:57Z,I'm at 80.1%. Still waiting for the 2 seeders to do more than 0.2 kB/s UL speed so I can start helping out by seeding myself. This is painfully slow.
,Eqa5cro,2010-09-06T00:25Z,"It took some time, but now it has taken off nicely.
Please, post feedback about torrent quality if possible.
Enjoy everyone. :)"
,cabamaru,2010-09-14T11:20Z,"well i succeeded in downloading!

,Eqa5cro,2010-09-15T11:22Z,"I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through all the trouble to make it work.
I specifically included ReadMe.txt files to avoid problems, but seems that didn't worked for you.
At least I'm glad you managed to make it work.
I wish others would post feedbacks so I could know if they also have problems."
,Tardon,2010-09-23T13:42Z,"I usually use a mac, so i basically have no idea how to make this work. So if someone could explain it (thoroughly) that would be very much appreciated. I'm running on windows 7 enterprise

cheers"
,Eqa5cro,2010-09-23T19:34Z,"I included instructions for every game.
If you don't know how to use DAEMON Tools, or have other similar problem.
I recommend googling for tutorials."
,Dracamus,2010-09-28T02:37Z,I can't play The Secret of Monkey Island (Special Edition). It say's that X3DAudio1_6.dll is missing.
,dropdeadream,2010-09-29T05:32Z,"Thanks, the download seems to work BUT I have been getting many popups (at least 12 popups in 2 hours of playing and at least 6 harmful items Microsoft Security Essentials detected). Has anyone else experienced this from playing? I'm playing The secret of Monkey Island.

Dracamus, That happened to me as well, I downloaded this and it worked.

,dropdeadream,2010-10-08T09:13Z,Doesn't seems like I get pop ups anymore (and I hopefully they won't come back). Thank you so much for the awesome upload! This brings back a lot of memories from my childhood.
,Eqa5cro,2010-10-16T03:01Z,You are welcome. ;)
,caysters,2010-10-17T23:17Z,"I am very VERY unhappy. I spent 3 days waiting for this to download, and was very excited. But it WON'T WORK! Not at all! I did everything that you said in that read me file, but the MISE.exe file isn't working at all, and so after installing the game, I can't even PLAY the game. 
So yeah, I'm very unhappy and bummed. I've been looking for this game for a while, grew up playing this game. And now I pretty much know I'm not going to find it."
,tomcat2014,2010-11-06T21:01Z,"You will need ""ScummVM"" to run the third game smoothly on a modern computer. It's a special emulator for running a number of old games on newer machines.
Get it from here (it's also available for 64bit Windows and Mac):

,Eqa5cro,2010-12-10T17:40Z,"Install DirectX.
If that doesn't help find the file with Google and put it to your C:\Windows\System32.
Put it also into C:\Windows\SysWow64 if you have that folder.
But simply installing DirectX should solve your problem:

,TOETAGGED,2011-01-19T09:48Z,"MI3, works like a charm, thank you! If any of you guys out there is having problems with the color, this is what you do:
- Right click on the ""Curse Of Monkey Island""-
 desktop icon
- Choose properties
- Choose compatability
- Tick the box that says ""Run in 256 colors""
- Klick OK
- Run game
All fixed! I hope I got that right in english, I'm a swedish win 7 user. If it's not exactly the right tranlation I hope you all get the picture anyway."

,Amenoxiel,2011-02-12T20:32Z,"Torrent rocks! Downloaded it in less than a day, installed all flawless (READ THE DAMN README!!!) - even ME3. (Win7 64 Bit). Now I tried to play the games. 1,2,3 & 5 are all working as intendet but there's a problem with 4. First the solution is messed up if you change it to anything other then the default 640x480(not a big deal) and the second is that there's literally NO MUSIC ingame. Only at the menu(F1) there's some. Not in the movie sequences and not while playing, only sound. Crack wasn't needed at all and even after aplying there was no music. Tried downloading the Crack with +Music from Gamecopyworld but it doesn't find the monkey4.exe - even after reinstalling.
If there's a solution to this problem, someone post it please. Till then I'll give it ""only"" a 4/5. "
,Amenoxiel,2011-02-14T00:31Z,Finally got around and applied the +Music crack - didn't do anything. So...HELP?!

With Monkey Island 1, I downloaded, mounted the files, then it gave me the option to run setup. I did, it ran through extracting all the files, got to the end and then ... nothing happened. The window just vanished, the game isn't installed. I've tried several times and this keeps happening. I haven't done the crack yet because the game isn't installed.

Is anybody else having this problem? Have I missed something?

2. download and install winrar, and extract Monkey_island_1.iso and Crack-RELOADED.zip
