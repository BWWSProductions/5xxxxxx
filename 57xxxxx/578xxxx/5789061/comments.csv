,VampireMuffinMan,2011-02-16T21:29Z,"This isn't a reflection on the upload or anything, but I can't even watch these.
I bailed after watching about half of each of the intro files and then the ""Gear"" video.  It's like watching a kid show you how to use a toy rather than a professional showing you how to use a multi-thousand dollar piece of software.  There are a couple of the later sections that I'm going to try to suffer through, but on the whole, this is just not a great tutorial.
Thanks to all the uploaders and seeders, but this one is getting recycled..."
