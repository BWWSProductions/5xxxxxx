Realism is key when depicting surfaces and material properties in product and industrial design projects. Only if a proposal or prototype looks realistic and professional, the target audience will be convinced of their merits. 
DOSCH Textures: Industrial Design V3 contains more than 300 high-resolution texture layers which can be combined to realistic looking surfaces. Use them for design and visualization projects in the industrial field, for product depictions and for material-related effects. All textures are seamless tileable. 
The materials in this texture library include: 
synthetics, wood, nylon fabric, carbon / fiber glas, leather, varnished surfaces, rubber, glass (structure and plain), paper, brushed metals and more. 
The high-resolution multi-layer textures include all relevant shader-maps for the material properties like the color-map and the bump-map. They render surfaces with a very realistic appearance and look. 
It is especially because of the high resolution (at least 1024x1024 pixel - most have 2048x2048 pixel) and the inherent high degree of detail, that these textures are "a must" for any serious 3D-designer. All texture layers can directly be used in most 3D-animation and CAD applications. 
The textures are provided in the JPEG-format with the highest quality-settings. 
All textures are license-free and can therefore be used without any additional cost in all * commercial productions.
