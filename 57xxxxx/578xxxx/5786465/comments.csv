What kind of world do you live in??"

,tbone3181,2010-08-25T03:23Z,"thanks dias_vld, that Alisya bird with the triple anal is pure filth. U got any more stuff of hers? i found a few vids on Piratebay but would like more if u can find it. thanks again!"
,ArtieT,2010-08-25T13:22Z,"I just commented here because it's your most recent torrent. The reason I comment is because I recently got one of your old torrents (not 'rough') from another place. Like all your torrents, it had a 'free' facialabuse clip (which I thought was a sample or extra). 

Think more about users and less about your affilate links."
[V],dias_vld,2010-08-26T19:44Z,"man, i just think in posting and not in users like you..who just talk trash and leech...u can fuck off, ok? Peace!! :)"
,ArtieT,2010-08-27T15:10Z,"Touched a nerve, eh? I ask you - who else here adds totally unrelated video clips to their torrents??

The fact that you do it to promote your affilate link is bad enough, but it's worse that the material you're spreading is so disgraceful. 

You might expect that kind of 'extreme surprise' browsing fileshare servers, but not torrent sites. 

What is even worse is there was a debate here about one of your other ('non-abuse') torrents, in which someone defended it (rightly) against the claim it was sick. 
He said ""there was no 'pathology'"". Knowing there was an abuse clip in there, were your ears not burning??

If you really still think it's OK to casually and cynically promote this kind of misogyny without warning, then I give up, and will gladly fuck off!

Offer your peace to the girls."
