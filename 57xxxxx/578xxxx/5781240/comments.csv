,snathi,2011-03-22T04:00Z,"This can't be the original Ju-On, the running time is too short? 67 minutes instead of about 90 minutes?

Is it one of the ""Black Ghost"" or ""White Ghost"" sequels?"
,vivatpb5776,2011-03-28T01:18Z,"Per this url http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ju-on_%28film%29 this download is the 70 minute direct-to-video version of Ju-On. The original theatrical version of Ju-On is 92 minutes long.

If you do not care what version you get, here is the particulars:

- The audio is in Japanese
- Hardcoded subs are a definite +1
- The video quality is very good...it does seem a bit stretched but definitely not enough to affect the overall quality of the movie. I was impressed that the screen resolution (528*324) fit my entire 22"" monitor. I do not believe I would have such pleasure when streaming this video to my 47"" television."

this movie looks good sounds good  maybe not the best video quality  but thats only if your  picky i cant really tell the difference

these damn ju on movies are so confusing cause there are so  many of them  then they all differnt titles..then there are american made ones too  so be careful to seperate  out the english remakes  from the original  japanese versions

this is nice w hard coded english subtitles all works great

thanks for the upload"
