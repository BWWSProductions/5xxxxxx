[umunu] September Clues - Busted!.XVID.AVI

Exposing the deception, insidious innuendo, misdirection and lies in the â€œSeptember Cluesâ€ series of videos, which many scholars and others have mistaken for the truth about some of the events that happened on that terrible day: September 11, 2001. Hopefully, this video will make them realise that they have been deliberately mislead. (By the author of "WTC7 - This is an Orange") Content: Where necessary, some of the shots in this video have been enlarged, slowed down, or have had indicators or stop motion techniques applied to them. No other visual manipulations or additions have been made.
