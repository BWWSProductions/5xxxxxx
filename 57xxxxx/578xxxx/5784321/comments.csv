,jon4fun,2010-12-12T17:47Z,"Thanks Blaze. Love your work.
I haven't DL'ed and installed yet but I've used your stuff in the past and have never had a problem.

I agree with comments from everyone from [rider1a]. If he/she doesn't understand that this is hacked s/w then they should go and spend the money and buy a full version and not tlak shit about trojan etc.

Cheers
