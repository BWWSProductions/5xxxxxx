A Lady of Letters (1988)
Original Air Date:  26 April 1988 
Written by Alan Bennett

Patricia Routledge plays Irene Ruddock

Irene Ruddock is not afraid to speak, or rather write, her mind: she writes letters to her MP, the police, the chemist - everyone she can, to remedy the social ills she sees around her. After one too many accusations of misconduct from Irenes pen, she is sent to prison - where, for the first time in her life, ironically, truly feels free. 

Katherine Patricia Routledge, CBE (born 17 February 1929) is an English theatre, television, and film actress and singer. She is best known for her roles on British television, most notably as Hyacinth Bucket on Keeping Up Appearances. In addition to her roles in British television, she has a long and successful career in musical theatre, as well as in film. She currently lives in Chichester, West Sussex.

Alan Bennett (born 9 May 1934) is an English playwright.  Many of Bennetts characters are unfortunate and downtrodden, or meek and overlooked. Life has brought them to an impasse, or else passed them by altogether. In many cases they have met with disappointment in the realm of sex and intimate relationships, largely through tentativeness and a failure to connect with others.

Bennett is both unsparing and compassionate in laying bare his characters frailties. This can be seen in his television plays for LWT in the late 1970s and the BBC in the early 1980s, and in the 1987 Talking Heads series of monologues for television.
