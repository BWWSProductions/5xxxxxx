[T],superDUQA,2010-08-26T00:50Z,"I'm not sure if anyone will genuinely believe this to be a sequel to James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster but we shouldn't underestimate the collective stupidity of the human race . In fact considering the original made so much money , much of which was due to 14 year old girls continually queuing outside cinemas to watch the film for the twenty seventh time anything might be possible where a gullible public are concerned 






This was the worst piece of DVD, I have ever seen. Shane Van Dyke was having a laugh when he made this. The effects were a total joke, looked like a PC game from about 10 years ago. The story was madness (an 800mph tsunami forces an iceberg into the path of the titanic). James Cameron must have been laughing his head off. Acting was awful, can't believe any actors would star in this film even for money. If you have 2 hours of your life you don't want to get back, you should watch this film. Almost so bad it's actually good. I hope they don't consider a titanic 3 because that would really be a disgrace to the film industry"
