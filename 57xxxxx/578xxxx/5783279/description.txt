Prometheus Records presents the original soundtrack recording to Escape To Victory the 1981 action film directed by the great John Huston, starring Michael Caine, Sylvester Stallone, Max Von Sydow and Pele, featuring music composed and conducted by Bill Conti (ROCKY), performed by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra. During World War II, a group of Nazi officers come up with a propaganda event in which an all-star Nazi team will play a team composed of Allied prisoners of war in a football (soccer) game. The prisoners agree, planning to use the game as a means of escape from their prison camp, with some help from the French resistance. Long sought after by fans of Bill Conti, Prometheus Records is pleased to present this superb soundtrack on compact disc for the first time, which is limited to just 3,000 copies.
