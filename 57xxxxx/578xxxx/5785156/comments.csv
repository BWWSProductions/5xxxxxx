[V],poppedtart,2010-08-23T20:50Z,yea as cdesade noted its the same as the SD.  It also has a bad itvc I suspect.  Release gradually goes more out of sync until it needs about a -0.300 adjustment.  audio track needs to be shrunk/expanded to match the video if someone wants to correct it for us.
[T],cdesade,2010-08-24T04:46Z,"poppedtart: Thank you for showing us the quick fix, glad you didn't mind me quoting you.

Even if you don't ""fix"" it, it's still very watchable, and very enjoyable! This is possibly the best American miniseries of 2010, without all the gratuitous/unneeded sex and violence that pollutes so many of these great television shows."
,pt.caesar,2010-08-24T18:35Z,"Well done, cdesade! 
This is the ONLY proper version so far, precisely at 29.97FPS.

I've DL all kinds of versions respectively at 23.976FPs, 24.98FPS, 25FPS; None of them match your smooth/fluid quality. I supose the series were shot with commercial DC, unlike ordinary US TV series shot with 24FPS film camera and telcined to 23.976FPS (If I am wrong with that, please educate me).

Thanks cdesade, you are the man of the series."

[T],cdesade,2010-08-24T21:58Z,"pt.caesar: Thanks, but I didn't record this. I'm definitely glad this is the best version you've found!

I'd been waiting a couple days for Part VI torrent in high def, and then finally found the .mkv online. As soon as I finished the download, and made sure it was legit and all good, I immediately shared it with you guys. Let's hope the EZTV crew gets back to releasing the last two episodes that air this weekend!"

,camptownraces,2010-08-26T03:54Z,"I have a corrected version of this video, but I do not have a clue how to upload it to Pirate.Bay.org. I used the cdesade video and audio to create one in sync. "
[T],cdesade,2010-08-26T05:58Z,"insinuendo: No prob, I'm gonna start finding and posting the most wanted/missing torrents I can find.

camptownraces: Click ""Upload torrent"" at the bottom of the screen and upload your .torrent from there. Google ""12345 create seed torrent"" (replace 12345 with your bittorrent client)."
