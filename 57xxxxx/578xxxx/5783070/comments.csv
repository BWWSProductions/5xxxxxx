,old_devil,2011-05-15T02:10Z,"Sequentially this is show 2 and in fact the real S01E01 if the pilot is more accurately labeled S01E00 Pilot (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Offspring_episodes). In other words, if you want the complete 14 shows of the first ""season"" you need to download two labeled S01E01, one being twice as large a file as the other. Hope that helps 8)"
