,edelhart,2010-08-24T21:03Z,"I Need your help.
For the first time i've uploaded a torrent.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5786750/IMAX_Adventures_in_Wild_California_720p

I think there's no tracker in it although i put one in.

Can someone take a look if there's a tracker.

What can I do if I forgot? What are the consequences?"
,edelhart,2010-08-24T21:08Z,"I just uploaded my first torrent.

What are the consequences ? What can I do about it?

[V],RiddlerA,2010-08-25T04:52Z,"@ edelhart

Don't worry ........ just keep ur DHT optiom clicked (Enabled), u will be able to find peers
Also TPB inserts Tracker within the torrent when u post on it, so it would even have some Trackers in it"

On it 
will be posting it by evening or tommorrow"

,correfcp,2010-08-25T09:51Z,"RiddlerA

when are you going to post LOST Season 6 with ALL extras from the DVD's. Because the extra that you upload isnt the only one on the DVD's.
There are for example Deleted Scenes and Bloopers.
I would like to download your pack of Season 6 with the extras, like the other seasons that you upload to here."
[V],RiddlerA,2010-08-25T12:56Z,"@ correfcp

You are right ....... there are other bonus features but they are not available on net

Only the 12 min clip is available on net

If anyone can find me a link to these bonus features I would be very happy to rip them to a smaller size"

,SquisheeLOTUW,2011-03-17T02:04Z,Thank you for uploading. Quality torrent. A=10 V=8/9. Not to mention it comes with subtitles in more languages than exist. I think I saw Aramaic in there somewhere?
,Daniel--pc,2011-03-18T16:23Z,What is the reason for this aspect ratio?? The cinema standard resolution is 16:9!
