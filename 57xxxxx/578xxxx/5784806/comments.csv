Thanks for the encode/upload.

Hope the PC you have re-incarnated and cobbled together can hang in their until you get enough donations to help you buy a new one.

I have sent the little I can afford this month, pensioner that I am, but I know that even 30 Euros can help IF you get enough of them.



@ ALL - please help 20-40. Contact me at jon_4fun@hotmaill.com for details on how to help 20-40. Please!!

Thank you
Jon"
