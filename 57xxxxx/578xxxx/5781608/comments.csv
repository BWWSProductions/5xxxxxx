[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-27T08:37Z,"that's because it was uploaded by ""an idiot""

the more you dare infecting my torrents with your idiot presence... more humility I'll bring to your torrents, till you learn to keep quiet. It is a way of conduct for an idiot to laugh at what others do, except his own bullshit  

next time when I see your signiture on my torrents I'll fill all your torrents with nice comments..

I wrote a comment on your Hitman Pro Upload.

Now I am here for a request. Can you give me the serial / crack / any way to activate and use ""Colasoft Capsa Enterprise"" 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Capsa Enterprise Edition
Capsa Network Analyzer (Packet Sniffer) is an easy-to-use Ethernet network analyzer (aka. packet sniffer or protocol analyzer) for network monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Start at: $549.00 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Isnt this overpriced? We are getting open source beauty Wireshark for absolutely free. :)  But this Capsa got some nice features that i miss on Wireshark. 

Hope you will help me. Thanks

All I've read at the Hitman torrents is your paranoia comment about McAfee detecting the original Hitman.exe, suggesting that I've added something to it. No need to see that that's pretty ridiculous.

Any, I'll take a look at your request later."
,oXXoBio,2010-09-03T08:35Z,"Okay RH. Thanks for your concern.

But  still I wonder how a genuine HitmanPro.exe could be detected as virus?
If you don't mind, (but still you don't have to) please explain the phenomena behind that detection? 

I have another doubt. If I set and use Mcafee Firewall to my own decision making mode then am I 100% secure from hackers or malicious programs connecting to my computer?

Once again thank you very much for your works and for replying me."
,oXXoBio,2010-09-03T09:51Z,"@imgeek
They also have a free version, but saving / printing isn't allowed."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-09T02:30Z,"@oXXoBio

Ask the publishers of Mcafee or Hitman why Mcafee detects Hitman Pro v3.5.5 Build 98 (32-bit)."
