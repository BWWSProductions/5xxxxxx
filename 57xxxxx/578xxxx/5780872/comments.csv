,david_daniels,2010-08-22T03:06Z,this didn't work for me I have 5.55 gen3 with the Prometheus patch. Does it take the 6.30 firmware? 
,lotusse22,2010-08-23T03:16Z,Can anyone help me make this game work for me? I also have 5.50 GEN-D3 for my psp with the prometheus patch. What firmware do I need to make it work? Or what additional patch do I need to make it work?
,JIHUIN,2010-08-23T13:54Z,I try to run this game on 5.50 GEN-D3 and it's not working. I also try to run this game on my nephew's PSP 5.50 GEN-B(full) and it's also not working. Does anyone have a patch for this game?
,mr-men,2010-08-24T00:39Z,"if you want to run this game, download iso-tool 1.65 from any psp hack site and use it to decrypt the eboot and patch with prometheus(doubt you need to prometheus patch it running the cfw with prometheus built in) but you do need to decryp the eboot."

,tat2darms,2010-08-25T03:59Z,Couldn't get it to work Other 799mb copy is 5.5 gen d-3 ready
,tanekage,2010-08-28T00:02Z,"I'm using 5.50 gen-D3.  The game works very well up to a point for me.  When I get to the dungeon after the windmill village, it freezes up on me.  I'm gonna see if changing the UMD ISO mode will change anything."
,tanekage,2010-08-28T01:46Z,"Ah, I got it working now.  Changed the UMD ISO mode from normal to M33 driver, and was able to get past the part where it was freezing."
