If you follow the instructions it should work, it worked for me."
,wei0130,2011-08-07T09:31Z,"It didn't work. I copied the cracked files to the installation directory, but it stills says ""Cannot find game data. This should be a installation error or operating system error."" I'm running it in Win7, I tried both compatibility mode for WinXP and Win2000, still didn't work. I don't know, maybe it won't work on Windows 7?"
