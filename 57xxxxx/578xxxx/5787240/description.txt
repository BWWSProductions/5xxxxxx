One of Rolling Stone's top 100 albums of the decade, Rated R from Queens Of
The Stone Age marks its 10th anniversary with the expanded, two-CD Rated R -
Deluxe Edition (Interscope/UMe). Added to the original album is a second disc
with six B-sides and the band's memorable summer 2000 Reading Festival
concert--featuring nine previously unreleased songs, including live versions
of Rated R's "Feel Good Hit Of The Summer," "The Lost Art Of Keeping A
Secret," "Better Living Through Chemistry" and "Quick And To The Pointless."

The B-sides are "Ode To Clarissa"; "You're So Vague," a spoof of Carly
Simon's "You're So Vain"; covers of Romeo Void's "Never Say Never" and the
Kinks' "Who'll Be The Next In Line"; a live version of the album's "Monsters
In The Parasol"; and a re-recording of "Born To Hula," an early QOTSA song.
The other Reading Festival tracks are concert takes on "Ode To Clarissa,"
three songs from the band's debut album ("Regular John," "Avon" and "You
Can't Quit Me, Baby"), and "Millionaire," a song originally from Josh Homme
side project Desert Sessions.

Issued in June 2000, Rated R was QOTSA's breakthrough, the band's second
album but first on a major label. Led by singer-songwriter Homme and emerging
from influential California desert rockers Kyuss, QOTSA debuted with a
self-titled album in 1998 that instantly earned the group accolades. After a
tour, QOTSA returned to the studio with Homme's long-time collaborator and
co-producer Chris Goss (of Masters of Reality) as well as former Kyuss
bassist-singer-songwriter Nick Oliveri. The result was Rated R, which guested
Screaming Trees' Mark Lanegan (lead vocals on "In The Fade") and Judas
Priest's Rob Halford (backing on "Feel Good Hit Of The Summer"). But it was
the anthemic "The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret" which became the band's most
popular song.

A gold album, four Grammy nominations, seven more Modern Rock Top 40s and 10
years later, Queens Of The Stone Age return this summer to the Reading
Festival and revisit a landmark album with Rated R - Deluxe Edition.
