,hyeguy123,2010-08-23T02:46Z,Is this for jtagged consoles only? Or can flashed consoles play it too?
[T],Antje14,2010-08-23T02:54Z,"@hyeguy123
Sorry, Devkit/Jtagged consoles only"
,ssdako,2010-08-23T02:58Z,Why can't you just burn the iso to a disc and play from a flashed console?
,JTAGpope,2010-08-23T03:40Z,Been waiting for a torrent thanks so much dude. 
,darthbob100,2010-08-23T04:54Z,"@ssdako, you just can't. Okay?

But if you feel like wasting an hour downloading it and burning it to a DVD+R DL, be my guest.

It still won't work."

,muskitor,2010-08-23T16:18Z,"dude, can somebody fix a torrent file that you can burn out to a disc? ;)"
,nslewand,2010-08-23T16:41Z,Wouldn't it be possible to make an ISO out of the files and burn it?
,ravendrow,2010-08-23T17:04Z,no you can not make an iso out of this you HAVE to be able to run unsigned code meaning get a jtag or pay for a devkit
,JTAGpope,2010-08-23T19:26Z,Confirmed Working! Thanks again.
,johnnyyywest,2010-08-23T23:05Z,"WHY SOMEONE WOULD POST AN ISO THAT 10% ONLY OF PEOPLE CAN USE IS BEYOND ME....

,Ride.,2010-08-24T00:14Z,"I've heard on other forums that this release has problems loading mission 8 as well as 2 multiplayer maps. Can anybody confirm this, or is it completely functional?"

But my console is bricked..."

Thank you! You Rock.

@johnnyywest
Hater! Stop crying like a little girl and be a man. JTAG your unit unless it's to difficult for you, then you can just get your boyfriend to do it for you."
,D4rth_Man7iz,2010-08-24T01:17Z,"ItÂ´s ironic that at least 90% of people who download and burn this, wonÂ´t be able to boot it  nor play it. All in all, remember if you like it Buy It! and support the Creative Talent of the people at Bungie!

If You Like It .. Buy It!"
,durpdeedur,2010-08-24T01:40Z,"Could somebody help find an alternative for the people who would like to run this apparently fantastic copy of Halo: Reach, and do not have a JTAGed Xbox, or a devkit? 

Sure its easy enough to JTAG, but only when you have an 360 with the dashboard from before summer 2009 when they fixed the exploit that allowed JTAGing to occur. So if you actually play your Xbox 360 online in the past year, which, you know, makes sense if you like to play games, you can't JTAG your Xbox.

I've been looking all day, but the apparently the only option is JTAGing or devkit."
,Farion911,2010-08-24T02:25Z,"The retail wont be leaked until september 10thish i would presume, this is the only option for now."
,beerswagger2007,2010-08-24T03:05Z,many a boxes will be banned over this game.ill just wait
,JTAGpope,2010-08-24T08:46Z,None of us will get banned because were not going online. They prolly dont even have the servers up yet. Your all just jealous cause were not bums and have a jtag console. If you game offline and don't have a jtag console you've got problems.
,BrianBloodaxe,2010-08-24T13:43Z,And there is no need to go on Live since the pinglimit been cracked. With jtaged 360's systemlink games can now be played over the net using Xlink Kai.
,Metalprofi666,2010-08-24T13:47Z,"what does a ""jtag"" mean?
is this file the same as all the others or..?"
,jaz484,2010-08-24T14:11Z,"How do you use this on a test/dev kit.
I've installed it to the hard drive with Xbox neighbourhood however when i try and boot it (default.xex) from the launcher it just pops up an error message saying the game needs to be redownloaded :-("
,felixg71,2010-08-24T15:48Z,"people who hack , and jtag their systems honestly need to get lives, go find a girlfriend or something, instead of siting at home hacking things and playing games 24/7,,, am never going to buy an xbox because of things like these, thank god i have a ps3,am not a fan boy here, am just saying hackers(low lives) just make it boring for every one. and are you honestly that desperate for a game??really guys ,,do you something else"
,anon890429,2010-08-24T15:51Z,You people are the worst type of gamers I am disgusted that you would take the option of illegally downloading a game which bungie has worked thousands of hours on without any contribution at all. 
,Martino92,2010-08-24T15:56Z,"Buy the game and support the creative talent at Bungie, douchebags"
,jaz484,2010-08-24T16:34Z,I have bought it. But in the meantime I'd still like to play!
,xTHExMERCx,2010-08-24T16:59Z,"Guys let me just go ahead and STOP this shit right now, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A JTAG, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS GAME UNTIL A DISC IS RELEASED. for those of use with jtags, we can run code that is UNSIGNED by Microsoft, like this ISO. if you do not have a jtag and you do have a flashed console, YOUR XBOX LOOKS FOR THE DIGITAL SIGNATURE on ANOTHER location on the disc, your discs are STILL DIGITALLY SIGNED!!! thats why you guys have to copy games from OTHER discs or download them from someone who copied it from a disc. So please stop yelling its not our fault you chose to Flash over Jtag. And for those of you who are whining about us Stealing the game... Fuck you, your on TPB so that means your stealing something, music, movies, games, porn... something."
,Srru,2010-08-24T17:03Z,"Lol at the mad people,Nice torrent thanks!"

,DevilOf9,2010-08-24T20:35Z,Mmmm....tasty a thousand thankyou`s im gna go play the shit out this then im gna go jtag tha fu@k outta my gf :)
,joshsinnesael,2010-08-24T23:17Z,"Is there any way to ""convert"" it so it would work on a flashed box. I don't have Jtag and have seen 10 or more copies of this but none for flashed boxes. I have no idea if it's possible but if it is and someone knows how I'd appreciate a tutorial or something so I can do it myself. Or do it yourself and up it for me. Thanks :) "
,Fucdatbit2,2010-08-24T23:40Z,Fuc it we have to wait for the disc to get leaked for our flashed drives. I downloaded and tried everything!! thanks anyway uploader !! Keep on truckin'

,sami1991,2010-08-25T03:44Z,"Can anyone confirm this runs with dev kit, as it says it does in the description however many people posted that it's JTAG only.

Thanks."
,n00batron,2010-08-25T05:04Z,"@jaz484 @sami1991 im in the same boat, have debug unit but havent been able to get the xex to run - ""dirty disc"" error if on disc. havent tried running from hdd yet but @jaz u say that didnt work either?

,zekeisaszekedoes,2010-08-25T14:16Z,"@matmurphee (who the fuck comes on The Pirate Bay to complain about piracy anyway?)

Idiots.

The same kind who ask ""Excuse me, will this work on a flashed X360"" when it clearly states ""For DevKit/JTAG hacked consoles ONLY!""

JTAG stuff isn't that hard, really.  I've used a JTAG to unbrick a router; doing the same thing for a console isn't that much harder, just a little more time consuming.

If you want to run unsigned code, you have to get at least a little familiar with the command line.  Hacks aren't as easy as they used to be."
,sami1991,2010-08-25T16:08Z,Does this work with XBOX Dev kit?

,Obsolete1,2010-08-26T18:40Z,"@MrBunniFooFoo YES! Just burn the data files to a disc and it will work! Even though the description clearly states that you need a Devkit/JTAG'd box! It will work for you! Because you're fucking Harry Potter! You're MAGIC! 

I bet when blu-ray came out you ran off to the store, and were extremely perplexed when they wouldn't load in your DVD player."
,hyeguy123,2010-08-26T20:26Z,"When burning this as a data disk to a dual layer dvd, do I use the traditional xbox 360 image layer break? (that is 1913760)"

,Obsolete1,2010-08-27T15:55Z,"@MrBunniFooFoo - Yes, I feel wonderful. I love being fat and... oh wait! You FAIL again. The answer is in the description, which you were obviously too lazy to read, or too RETARDED to comprehend.

,MrBunniFooFoo,2010-08-28T03:15Z,"@Obsolete1,jaymac407  idk what you cock nuggets didn't understand is i didn't understand the description hence the fucking question so maybe you should get off your high all mighty streak.Cause just cause i didn't know something doesn't mean im a dumb shit or doesn't know how to use the internet..How the fuck do you learn things?
