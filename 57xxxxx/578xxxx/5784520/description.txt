Sprites are an independent new wave/indie pop music group from Maryland, USA. Their lineup is ever-changing, with only the founding members (the husband-wife duo of Jason Korzen, formerly of Barcelona, and Amy Korzen) staying constant. Contributors include Christian Scanniello, Ivan Ramiscal, Kevin Alvir, Armin Pruessner, Derek Strausbaugh, and Reid Dossinger.

This is their second studio album, released in 2006 through Darla Records.

After searching for quite some time, I was unable to find a torrent of any Sprites albums. I downloaded and converted the files myself, so I hope everything works fine. Seed, comment, enjoy. Cheers.
