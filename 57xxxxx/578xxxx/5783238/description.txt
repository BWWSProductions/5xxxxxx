RE-ENERGIZED Nucleus is based on Windows 7 Ultimate x64,

Welcome to the RE-ENERGIZED version of Nucleus.The build is a reworking of the original Nucleus with an entire new look.
The theme for this os was created by MR. Grim of Virtual Customs exclusively for this os. Gone are the days of just having
a background color in folders and windows as you will see on this build there is now a wallpaper being used as the background
folders and other areas of windows.

The Theme comes in 2 versions a black dark version and a black blue version.
There is all new side pictures in the windows resources, new desktop wall, setup screens, clock, and the skin for msn has been
reworked slightly with more glow and a couple of small changes.

RE-ENERGIZED Nucleus has just a few tweaks applied home group is diabled, DEP is disabled UAC is disabled and themes are patched
for use with 3rd party themes nothing has been removed. A few extra themes and lot's of custom cursors.

Many thanks goes to the always amazing Mr Grim for all the hard work he put into the custom theme, Mr Grim you are the best
your work is beyond compare I thank you so much for the amazing job you did with this theme :)

The Build is not unattended so you can enter your info on setup, tweaks are available to you from the wpi after install just
eject the disc and reinsert it to bring up the autorun menu to start the wpi for apps and tweaks.

As normal all thats included will be listed below with screens enjoy the build everyone.
