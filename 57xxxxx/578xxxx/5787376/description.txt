I would like to thank those who inspired me and helped me to build this album, beginning by my closest relatives, Elly, StÃ©phane, & my family of course ; people from the website Interpals.net who helped me to write my lyrics : Seeta, Daichiii, shokkk, meiteru, FlexBlur (thx, you brought me so much) and jue6ons (he\'s not in Interpals btw). Thanks to naruto for letting me use the remix in my album. Thanks to the artists that feed me every day with their music : Aira Mitsuki, Shinichi Osawa, Nine Inch Nails, 
Boom Boom Satellites, Flex Blur (a major influence), Telefon Tel Aviv, and much more. Thanks to the technology I paradoxally spit on. Much music composed and produced by Flex Blur. Cover art by 
Flex Blur and Rose_. Produced in France, with the kind help of Japanese people. Â® 2010 Flex Blur.
