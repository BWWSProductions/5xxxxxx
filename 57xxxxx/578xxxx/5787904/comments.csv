[V],twentyforty,2010-08-25T11:02Z,"@JoSox: Check the mail.

@ALL: My PC crushed last night. Sorry.
          Who have not finished download -  
          1st: STOP and UNLOAD old torrent with
          incomplete download
          2nd:LOAD THIS TORRENT and point to
          EXACT folder where previous 
          (uncompleted) files reside.

Your torrent program would check existing files 
and RESUME the download. Nothing would be wasted.

Sorry."
