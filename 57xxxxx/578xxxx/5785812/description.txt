The series "From the Earth to the Moon" had some great original music, but unfortunately, a soundtrack of it was never released.

As a frustrated fan of the series, I assembled a "homemade soundtrack", comprised of various musical segments.  These are straight from the series, with the vocal audio accompanying.

It's not a perfect collection, but I hope you enjoy.
