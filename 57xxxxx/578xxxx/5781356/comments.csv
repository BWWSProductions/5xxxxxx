,lydonit13,2010-08-23T22:10Z,"I do agree that the original CD release was way too ""loud"" - my ears are still bleeding - and this version does sound better in that respect, but since it's ripped from a video game, there's no need to store the files as FLAC.  The songs would have had some compression when they were incorporated into the game.  Audiochecker shows them at MPEG with 95% probability.
Thanks for sharing anyway."
,DoomWraith,2011-02-25T04:06Z,"""That Was Just Your Life"" seems to be all fouled up (I used ""Audacity"" to open it up and it seems fine for about 55 seconds and then it starts to skip around from one channel to the next.  The other tracks seem fine, otherwise."
,DoomWraith,2011-02-25T04:24Z,"Listening to it now, ""The Day That Never Comes"" is fouled up, too....  DOH!!!!  :("
,DoomWraith,2011-02-25T04:32Z,"DOH!!!  I spoke too soon.  ""The Day That Never Comes"" is messed up too.  :("
