When Detective Mortimer Shade is somehow killed in a freezer, a parasite called a grail 
possesses his body, revives him, but he needs blood to stay alive. His partner John Dark 
accepts the new situation and together they become vigilantes, judging and killing the 
bad guys, with Shade sucking their blood with his claw. However, Dark notes that Shade 
is losing the rest of his humanity and becoming a monster, being aware and afraid of 
the danger Shade represents to mankind and trying to stop him.
