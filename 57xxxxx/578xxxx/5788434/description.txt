The dumb loser Frank Muzzy invites his alcoholic friend and gravedigger Eddie to raise some money bootlegging US$ 250,000.00 in cigarettes for the powerful mobster Spider to Mexico. However, their truck catches fire and they lose the load. Frank becomes desperate to raise the amount, and hides himself with Eddie in the house of his mother. When Frank sees in the newspaper the picture of Crystal Harkness, the wife of the tycoon Harkness, Eddie confirms that she was a former strip dancer and buried with a valuable necklace. Frank forces Eddie to exhume her body, but they do not find the jewel.
