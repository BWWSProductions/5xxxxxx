UmeÃ¥, Sweden (1987 â€“ present)

Meshuggah, whose name is taken from the Hebrew and Yiddish word for â€œcrazyâ€, are a five-piece band from UmeÃ¥, Sweden, founded in 1987. Their style is most easily described as extreme/technical metal with some jazz influence. They use extended polymetric passages, complex drum patterns, angular, dissonant guitar riffs, and harsh vocals. Their lineup has always been consistent, apart from bass which has been handled by many people since the bandâ€™s inception. Their current lineup consists of Jens Kidman (vocals), Fredrik Thordendal (lead/rhythm guitar + backup vocals), MÃ¥rten HagstrÃ¶m (rhythm guitar + backup vocals), Dick LÃ¶vgren (bass) and Tomas Haake (drums).

Meshuggah is widely acknowledged as an influence on many modern metal bands from Textures to Tool. They are regarded as pioneers by critics and musicians alike.
