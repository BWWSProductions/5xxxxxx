The penultimate episode of the longest running cop show on uk tv-& a total disgreace that itv spends money on the x factor & awful talent-less shows while great drama like this is axed............a sad time


A child is murdered in the 2 part finale,its a gang thing & mickeys old informant who feels let down by the police(cos of max) is a key witness..........

The show could have done the big blow out,with burnside & don beeech comin back,but i hope the fact they stuck to the normal plot lines,is a precursor that another station will take the bill back on-LETS NOT FORGET ITV STOPPED THE 2 EPISODES A WEEK & MOVED ITS TIMESLOT-THEY ARE TO BLAME HERE-NO ONE ELSE & IT INFURIATES ME THAT THE X FACTOR IS EVEN ALLOWED ON TV WHEN ITS BEEN PROOVEN TO BE FAKE!! 
LONG LIVE THE BILL
