Before I downloaded Mafia II from Skidrow, I downloaded that one from Globe. I had the same error message there :S. That's why I started downloading Mafia 2 from Skidrow since his releases are always nice. So I got the same error message @ two different releasers. Weird isn't it?

""The program can't start because d3dx9_42.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""

I came back here, saw other people had the same problem, and it was recommended to use the crack fix. So I downloaded that. I uninstalled the game, then reinstalled it, and then copied the contents of the SkidRow folder from the CrackFix to the pc folder in the main program directory, as the installation notes said to do.

The problem is, the game still won't run. I get the exact same message I wrote above. Nothing changed.

Would anyone be kind enough to tell me (and the others) how to fix this probelm?

While sounds of the environment, car, gunfire, people speaking in streets are fine. the only prob is videos have no sound.

I have googled and searched for a solution for about a week, but couldn't find anybody else with the same problem... 

I just reinstalled Win7 x64, but Mafia 2 was working fine on my previous installation of Win 7 x64, so the problem is probably related to a driver, I think.

I have tried cleaning my registry of anything related to Mafia 2, and reinstalling several times, on different hard drives (googling error code 0x000007b gives me posts related to harddrive problems, so i tried installing on another harddrive just to see if that would fix it, but it didn't)

Someone please help!"
,fr33.cheez,2011-05-12T08:27Z,"@WSvdBerg dude there is only one win-zip file in this torrent you just have to unrar it and install the sh*t just click on steup and copy the crack...

I still got a problem though my life gets drained for apparently no reason after chapter one >.> *sigh*
that torrent is fucked up... Can somebody give the link to a crackfix or something like that.... please :) "
,fr33.cheez,2011-05-12T08:36Z,"lol I actually saw a link to the crack fix in the previous comments so here it is :

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5788454/Mafia.II.Crackfix-SKIDROW

yeah thanks to Mr.sdnl1j2 and Mr.Stun  the uploader of the crack fix. :D
Everybody should actually use this crackfix because the crack in THIS hremm awesome torrent is totally useless except if you want to finish the game with 1hp :]"
,Viktor6665,2011-05-25T18:29Z,"I had to extract those rar files into an iso file and then extract the iso file into a folder.
anyways this has a bug, after chapter 2 you do everything like you are in health danger, even if you didnt get any damage, any little accident or a hit will kill you and the heartbeat sound is fucking annoying"
,fr33.cheez,2011-05-25T19:46Z,@Viktor6665..... fucking lazy ass just read the previous comments >.>
,Viktor6665,2011-05-27T12:58Z,"I did, but i couldnt find the answer here... i had to read a lot forum comments to find out there is another crack by skidrow, and i have to restart the chapter-.- "
