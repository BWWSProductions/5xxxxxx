Note:
Last month I got myself an Ipod and I thought of putting the album of Rattle And Hum on it. Then I thought, why not mix it with the dvd tracks? So I started and mixed it until I had an album of more then 100 minutes. Sometimes I replaced the audio with the dvd version cause it mixes better.
If you want to enjoy the real Rattle And Hum experience, feel free to download and enjoy!
