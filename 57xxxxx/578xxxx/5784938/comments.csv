[V],BLACKTROY,2010-08-24T06:37Z,ekarth22 download and see for yourself. too busy. 109.23mb is not a big task to download
,memphist,2010-08-25T13:31Z,"Blacktroy, in the amount of time you spent being a smart ass... you could of just told ekarth22 for what platform its for.  You should never be to busy to be nice....  and on that note, you do great things here and thanks for that."
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-08-26T02:35Z,memphist -- you think i ve time to screen every AIO upload. remember this is apps.not a single software. my priority being the uploader is to screen for virus. this upload contain more than 50 apps. 109mb is not a big task. to download on slow broadband it may take 25-mins or so.
,tman2610,2010-08-27T11:14Z,"No offense but i agree on the rudeness to the other poster. Nice to see no screening on content even the slightest. I download a lot of things from you Blacktroy, but a lot of trust is put in people like ChattChitto and Carter67, Hellboy and a few because it seems the progs they upload have some use because maybe they've looked at them. 

And not everyone has unlimited DL, I've a lot so I'll dl and take a peek and comment, but be nice to know you have some idea of a prog you put up there and if its known to crash phones/pcs or just be a complete waste of dl because its crap.  

No offense, because you've put some great stuff up, but you've just noted you are just passing stuff on that you get, ""no virus, goes up"" under Blacktroy, thats all that matters. All's good though, because at least your open about it."

[V],BLACKTROY,2010-08-27T16:40Z,tman2610.yes ChattChitto and Carter67 are top notch. sometime most of their stuff do take some criticism from leechers as well.just because i don't ve time to put full decription of my upload.then someome call me a smart-ass. that sound ridiculous. looking at this idiot that make this comment.he has never uploaded a single stuff. strange.
