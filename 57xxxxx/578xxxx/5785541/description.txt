 Release Notes
 -------------
 Video Source: Russian Video [THANKS!]
 Audio Source: Polishbits [THANKS!]

 Well source was kinda dark,tried to brighten up as much as we could with out
 making the light scenes look weird and colors washed out. Raaan it through an
 RGB EQ,lowering the red quite a bit and the green a tad,also adjusted some
 other colors. Adjusted contrast,sharpened,denoise etc. Video seems to be
 overcropped,sorry but not our doing. As for the audio,not bad,however we don't
 feel that is direct audio as Polishbits had labeled. We did fix the clipped
 peaks,and there was a lot,along with the clicks and crackles. Then we ran it
 through an EQ to try and give a little more bass and then muxed to our video.
 Not the best,but watchable. Enjoy!=]
