,Martin0432,2010-08-24T07:07Z,"Your a great torrent uploader! Thank you for apologizing, and admiting a mistake and not screwing all of us over. As for haters, i remind you guys, you're still downloading something illegal, and can't complain cause it's free. beggars can't be choosers. cheers! godslayer! :) "
,Martin0432,2010-08-24T07:08Z,"oh ya this is a good torrent, 1.1. mb speed :D"
,mrbotes88,2010-08-24T13:09Z,SEED PLS! busy dl'ing.. if this works pls seed
,papayrus,2010-08-24T15:49Z,I'm not even downloading this because I already got it working and am waiting for a crack for 1.03. I been following Godslayers torrents waiting hoping to see an actual 1.03 crack soon but anyway just logged in to say thank you man for all your hard work and I normally dont do that unless I see heart and soul. Good job man keep it up. Oh I did get the new maps nice ones thanks again.
,Godslayer187,2010-08-24T17:33Z,"1.03 crack may be a bit, as it directly ties into multiplayer. we are working on a solution but blizzard jumps on anything put out right away when it comes to online play, they really don't want the multi cracked, and as such they last max of 24 hours and then we are back to the drawing board. Give us time and hopefully we can find a more permanent work around like we have for the single player skirmish and campaign.  there are a few around by razor1911 but they too are getting shutdown within 24 hours and sent back to the drawing board. If anyone happens to find a stable crack for 1.03 please let us know.

P.S thanks for you support guys :)"
,taylabraim,2010-08-25T14:37Z,Could we get some people on to seed this please. I have been trying for the past 2 days now to dl this.

,gildor26,2010-08-25T16:34Z,Seed people c'mon it is not that hard. 
,Godslayer187,2010-08-25T16:53Z,"Guys NOTE I am the only one with full seed right now, the others you see have just downloaded the map pack or cracks and not the 7.1 gig ISO, I am maxing my bandwidth upload at 512kbps im sorry about the speed, more ppl need to increase their share ratio by upping their upload speed to get it rolling. Be patient it takes a bit to get the torrent flowing when first created especially when it is 7.41 gigs.


As well this has been checked by 10 different people to ensure it works correctly and it does 100% ."
,Godslayer187,2010-08-25T16:56Z,"PS once this finishes getting to a few people, like the full 7.41gigs, it will fly like 1mbps + so just hang in there, can't bitch about something yer getting for free.....or if you really don't like the wait well u could go get a version that doesn't work.....or...BUY THE GAME :P"
,taylabraim,2010-08-26T02:40Z,Thank you Godslayer187 for doing this. We really appreciate your work. Not going to complain about the dl speed now that I know your the only one that can seed it for us. I appologize for being impatient I am just excited about getting this and being able to play.

,Godslayer187,2010-08-26T17:10Z,"Allin1 is for this version of the game and in order to work correctly needs to be installed following the instructions and order above. If you want to try it on something else u can, but there is no guarenteee you won't be wasting your time.....Allin1 is not for beta."

,napthamdc,2010-08-26T21:25Z,"OK everything went great except for the slow download cos of only 1 seeder...

im at the end of everything, i believe i posted the maps in the right folders, and what i get is this 

Win 7 system
"" The process cannot access the file 
\Documents\Starcraft II\Maps\(8)Big Game Hunters.sc2map'. because it is being used by another process; ""

I know im so close that i cant stand it..... I had to make my own maps folder in the \Documents\Starcraft II\ directory because there was no maps folder there....

a little clarification would be GREAT "
,DizzyCRACKERS,2010-08-26T21:39Z,"Yeah, i have a problem when i go to insatl the game it says that there is a problem make a file and that one of the files downloaded cant be foung can some one please help me?"
,napthamdc,2010-08-26T23:32Z,"OK, im starting t o think that its a windows 7 issue...... i cannot remove the ""read only"" from ANY file on my system...... ,,,, its also effecting other games that i need to patch....   ive tried looking up answers as to how to unlock my computer but no luck so far....

anyone have any ideas?"
,napthamdc,2010-08-27T03:43Z,"OK i figured out my problem... DEFINITLY a windows 7 issue, nothing wrong with the torrent.....

If your using windows 7, once game is installed, and after you close out the update,

After step 4 of the provided instructions

1 go to your c:\program files directory, >right click on it, and go to properties > security

make sure that all the ID's listed here have FULL ACCESS by any user name on the computer, all you have to do is click edit, select each name and allow full access

2 go to your  ""my documents\starcraft II\"" directory and create a folder named Maps ""

3 go back to ""my documents\starcraft II folder, right click and repeat step 1.........

continue with Step 5 of the given directions....

and once you have done everything the game works fine................................


Godslayer thank you so much for providing this torrent!!!, im so glad it worked!!!!!!.....   ill definitly do some seeding for ya!!!!"

I dont know what you are talking about. I dont have the problem you have. Why are you putting full access on all your folders like that? Are you loading the game from the scallin1 launcher or from the game itslef?"

,Torcish,2010-08-28T20:18Z,"@leanderc

Try to update your video drivers and directx.
Or try to reinstall the game.

@ericksander

I dont experience any sound issues, try to
-confirm your sound works in other games, -check the sound options in-game,
-check your windows sound options.
-Reinstall"

,slimjimmy149,2010-08-30T18:26Z,"Yep, I have the same problem as DizzyCrackers and SystemF. When I double-click on the shortcut on my desktop to start the game.....which I'm assuming is the correct way to go about it......it shows the scene where the marine gets released from prison and gets his suit (his new cell) and then it brings me to the screen of death....the battle.net login screen."
,elwisklp,2010-08-30T19:30Z,"can someone tell me how can i play this with friends in LAN if it can be done...reply to me
:D"
,Godslayer187,2010-08-30T20:51Z,"1. Check the system requirments and make sure you meet or beat them, 

2. make sure you have fully updated drivers

3. Follow the instructions to a T, make sure your do the updates correctly and cancel the b.net update b4 it does anything  (note you have to do the copy paste of campaign crack folder data 2x...once before the update and once after. IF you don't do this right it will load like your trying to go on b.net and will not work until you copy that data in their again. So make sure you are doing ALL the steps as the instructions say.

this game is very high end and will not work on single core processors, must be DUEL CORE 

for the SCAllin1 fmodex_4_28_08.dll error check and make sure you havent choosen a start location on the map, if you want to choose a start location you have to choose a location for every player in the game, so your position and the potition of the comp players, if you don't do that it will error. Also if you download blizzard made maps with the .SC2MA or .S2MA extentions on the map file, these do not work with SC2Allin1 as they are developed specifically for the battle.net legues and have extra data that screws up SC2allin1.

I hope this helps with some of the issues you guys are having.  

Note: this torrent works 100%, its peoples PC's that are the issue in these rare cases...if you have an issue try to google the problem and you will probably find a solution or the cause.

,mariuss72,2010-09-03T17:31Z,"@Sillysauce i did that too, not working..."
,Godslayer187,2010-09-03T20:50Z," - All the crack folders are in the folder ""CRACKS""

- The SC2Allinone will automatically create a maps  folder in your documents\starcraft2 folder on installation. Place any maps you want to use into that folder. then when you run SC2ALLin1 tell it to add maps from that folder.



- If SC2ALLin1 is giving you errors, make sure you are fully updated with windows service packs.

rocknrollcz -  how much memory do you have and are your using a duel core 2 stepping processor? Also what version of windows and what video card are you using.

- The UPDATE.BAT is located in  cracks\campaign crack folder and just says UPDATE unless you have show file extensions on. It is illustrated with 2 gears and says UPDATE

- 
8. now, paste all those files ONE MORE TIME, in the ""Starcraft II"" folder and overwrite everything
...
exactly what am i pasting here and where. 

Answer - first you have to copy the contents of the Campaign crack folder to your starcraft 2 directory ""default = C:\windows\program files\starcraft2""  once you copy those files there you run the update.bat or ""UPDATE"" if you don't have extensions on ""has 2 gears for pic"" once it does its thing you need to copy that same set of files into that same folder so that it works correctly and prevents b.net from accessing you SC2 and fucking it up.


FYI for people getting slow speeds. You will not get high speeds in peer to peer unless you have your share ratio up. In other words if you have your upload at 5kbps you won't get much more then 60-100 kbps download because your being stingy and not sharing. leave your upload at unlimited and you should get better speeds. peer to peer will give data to people that share before those that don't because that way the swarm speed goes higher and the download is faster. no point in giving someone thats not sharing a good speed because they are not contributing to the swarm speed and if anytrhing are slowing others down by taking data and not putting back in. so stop yer bitchen and SHARE!!!    I have had numerous friends download this torrent and all were at 900 kbps - 2mbps speeds because they have high share ratio and don't limit their upload.

I hope this helps a few of you, I can't answer all your problems as most of what I see is PC related issues and not the game itself. 

BEFORE DOWNLOADING THIS TORRENT GO HERE AND MAKE SURE YOUR SYSTEM MEETS THE REQUIRMENTS!!!!!

Thanks......"
,Sillysauce,2010-09-04T12:18Z,"I did everything according to the Instructions.
Copied the maps to Documents/Starcraft2/Maps and also pasted them in the game-installation folder.

When I press the SC2Allin1 icon on my desktop and select a player (myself) and an opponent(Computer), after I press 'Launch' I get this error saying; 
SC1All-in cannot implement/execute the requested action on a file with an open by the user assigned section.  

Hope the translation is correct.

Does anyone know how to fix this error?

Campaign works fine by the way."

,Godslayer187,2010-09-09T16:37Z,"For starters, I dunno what yer unzipping, this torrent is not zipped or rared, so #1, don't be unzipping stuff thats not zipped. Secondly, The disc image .ISO is in the folder SC2 ISO. And If you don't mount the image of coarse its gonna want authentication because you have no disc in your drive, Thus it thinks you want to download the client and wants verification.

The only way you wont have the files to make this work is if you choose not to download them when it kicks in to bittorrent. Otherwise everything is there if you LOOK. This has been made so that a rabbid squirrel on crack could figure it out.

If you READ the instructions it tells you in STEP 2 Where the ISO is. PPL READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE ASKING WHERE STUFF IS!!!!"

,Godslayer187,2010-09-14T17:50Z,"@alexhughes1991 - Something is screwy with your internet connection, maybe try a reinstall on your nic card and clean all your cookies out ect. Blizzard has stated that there are some issues with win 7 64 bit systems, check their technical support FAQ maybe the answer is there as to wtf is going on. Basically tho, the game is fine, something is screwy on your machine. If all else fails call your ISP and ask them why the hell its doing that, they may have a data mismatch on their end thats screwing your connection up.

If your graphics look like your playing a adavnced version of SC1 then you need a new video card!!!   

If you have no sound you need to UPDATE your sound drivers, or get a better card.

,Kodenamezeus,2010-10-16T22:52Z,"guys, listen up. the prob with campaigns is not specific, it comes with all pirate versions of the game. this content has been downloaded from the internet (that's what you have to do to access campaigns anyway), so when it doesn't open properly and give you errors it's because it comes from a machine where the user cannot pack everything he downloaded into a single archive. so my advice is that if you want to play campaigns properly pay the friggin 60 bucks and get done with it, instead of always whining about them not working.

a/p skirmish i may only say thank you because this one is fully functional, as long as you got the maps. moreover you can actually play with others in network skirmish if you got private network it also works. plus you play with all races, instead of sticking to terrans, so that's also a plus."

,reaper411,2010-11-20T03:59Z,"Update: found out how to fix the problems for the installer. it has to do with the windows audio service. 
Heres what to do
1. Run ""msconfig.exe""
2. Go to ""Services"" tab and uncheck 7 or 8 items on top. (I suspect the ""Windows Audio"" service to be the culprit, but I'm not sure)
3. Go to ""Startup"" tab and click ""Disable All""
4. Click Apply and Click OK
5. Restart the Computer.
6. Run ""Installer.exe"" and Voila... it works..
7. After you're done with the installation, go back to ""msconfig.exe"".
8. Under ""Startup selecetion"", click ""Normal startup"", apply and restart the pc..

if that doesnt work uncheck a few more things :) hope this help you guys some"

No need for other programs like the SC2allinone.
Fully working Campaign and Skirmish modes on the game itself plus the latest patches(1.1.3).


To everyone having problems this is how i did it:
1. Install any fresh copy of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty (Fresh install to remove all the previous cracks).
2. After installing stop the game from updating.
3. Run SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch from the download.
4. Run Keygen as Administrator. (THIS IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE GUEST ACCOUNT WORKING!)
To run as admin on XP simply shift+double click.
Click OK then QUIT.
5. Run sc2_copy.
6. To play the game, use the SC2Switcher.exe located at the install folder starcraftII>support to prevent the game from updating.


Windows XP/7
Starcraft II enGB version, not tested on enUS."

,djindahouse,2011-05-24T12:52Z,"this worked perfect, the crack was little bit of a problem to follow as it does take some sence to fill some of the gaps in, I.E if you cant find your "" mydoc/starcraft2/maps"" folder then just create one inside the ""mydocuments/starcraft2/"" folder.. that simple really. as for the AI offline skirmish it is working brill and greatful for this upload. just to note for more maps visit (sc2.nibbits.com ) it has loads and also the creator of the scallin1 is there too with a pack of 64 blizz maps already working with SCallin1. cheers godslayer187.

all we need now is someone to be brave and create a mod for online play outside b2.net"
,patrolkid,2011-05-24T21:46Z,i have one with the SC2ALLin1 file so you can play skrimish and that works fine but some maps wont work then when i want to play with some of the maps some warning shows up that says something about the reach of space
,mikeknowshow,2011-06-15T12:54Z,"Very nice skirmish works nicely
however it crashes sometimes when i try to fiddle with the game settings like display and such
anyways great upload thanks for this"
,brando043,2011-06-16T18:24Z,i followed the instructions to the t and when i try to load the maps it tells me that my license needs to b validated and i need to b logged into battle.net when i am.

,fancysauce,2011-07-02T07:05Z,"question... i am having trouble getting the map packs and when i use SC2Allin1 to get maps from the folder and i select the folder there are no maps... sorry for the noob question but where do i get the maps?
btw thx for great torrent Godslayer187"
,fancysauce,2011-07-02T07:24Z,"k nevermind i figured it out...
NEW PROB: setting up skirmish game, launched it, then it needs me to log in to battle.net. 
what did i do wrong???
THX"
,FailMaor,2011-07-05T20:42Z,"YES!

The game works perfectly even on my 4 year old computer without a ANY lag whatsoever, i had settings on High.

The crack was i little hard so i kinda gave up and got a new one all together.

Great Torrent finished in about and hour and thirty minutes.

Thank you Godslayer187, i recommend this to anyone.

Cheers!"
,Fenr1r,2011-07-10T11:32Z,"WORKS!
Just follow the instructions and you're all set for some alien ass kicking!

fancysauce: ""setting up skirmish game, launched it, then it needs me to log in to battle.net.
what did i do wrong???""

Same thing happened to me.
I fixed it by copying the contents of the folder:
[TORRENT DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY]\StarCraft 2 - Wings of Liberty\Cracks\Campaign Crack\Battle.net\
And then paste everything into:
[GAME DIRECTORY]\StarCraft II\Battle.net\
And then running sc2_copy.exe under:
[TORRENT DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY]\StarCraft 2 - Wings of Liberty\Cracks\Razor1911\

Follow the uplaoder's instructions closely and you'll have it running in no time!"
,Fenr1r,2011-07-10T11:34Z,"And btw, THANK YOU UPLOADER!
:D"
,polatucos14,2011-07-17T23:21Z,there's no music playing on the background while playing skirmish is it?

Don't download that torrent, my antivir AVG found a trojan in installer.exe !

,MagicalHerpies,2011-08-24T13:18Z,"@openflyer
It's not a virus, anti-viruses say that cracks, or anything trying to crack it is it a ""virus"".
Stop spreading false information when you haven't got a clue. and AVG sucks it said i had 24viruses on christmas and wouldn't let me use anything on my computer."

,HOCgaming,2011-09-05T10:05Z,"I don't understand how this can be!?

To start off with, the folder is called ""crack"" not ""cracks"" . I decided that it might be a typo on your part, and used everything in there instead. 

Everything worked fine until step 9. For some unknown reason I don't have a ""Razor1911"" folder! Nowhere in sight. 

Some help please! D:"
,HOCgaming,2011-09-05T10:12Z,"IT'S ALL RIGHT! Phew....

I read some other people's previous comments and someone else was making the same mistake as me. Luckily, someone helped them :D

THANKS!"
,dvs_misfit,2011-09-14T11:05Z,"I have the ""Starter Edition"" of SC2, will I be able to just copy over the ""Crack"" files and still play my Campaign that I've already started? Also, this might seem like a stupid question but, will I be able to use my Battlenet acc? I don't care if I can't play online, just want to know if I can play on my Battlenet acc and collect Achievements.

(I do plan on buying the actual game when I get the money for it. So, this is just temporary.)"
,irslow,2011-09-19T14:40Z,"So everything seems to work, but after the game starts and after the first cut scene I get nothing. Well I can't say that, I get what should be the opening menu. But no menu. It's just the ship flying by the planet, I left it open for about half and hour and nothing changed. I followed the directions to a tee. Is there anything I am missing? "

,getmills,2011-10-17T19:15Z,"Thanks for the upload!  Campaign worked flawlessly, but unfortunately when I do skirmish there are no maps.  Also when I downloaded the Cracks folder was missing the Razer crack, but was easily downloaded from elsewhere.


Any help on how to get the maps to work?"
,CyStefanos,2011-11-14T21:21Z,Thank you Godslayer187. Your torrent works PERFECTLY! I have finished the campaign. I have also played skirmish. Nice torrent. Buy the game and support the company if you can afford it. It is one of those games that are truly worth spending your money on.
,abyss111,2011-11-20T15:55Z,ok i got to step 11 and it says i have to paste the maps into the starcraft II maps folder i dont have one can anyone help me plz
,Dahmastah,2011-11-21T23:50Z,"Everything works, however launching some skirmishes are buggy and fairly restrictive, not allowing insane AI mode, it will come up with some sort of error saying ""Index value range not met - Parameter 9840234"" etc.

Playing on any map is strange too, sometimes it won't launch.

Followed all steps, worked perfectly, campaign works, played 10 hours of skimmy, that was fine regardless of restrictions on a free game.

I WILL buy it to play with my mates in LAN parties :)

Thanks Godslayer187"

I'll answer some questions too
@dcgillette nope, like most pirated games you cannot play online, buy the game if you want that ability
@ahri666J im going to assume that even after a month you haven't discovered this yet... your ""starcraft folder is your program files
to get there you will want to go to your computer, click on your main hardrive, go to program files (X86)
inside you will find all of your programs, go to Starcraft II folder. this is where you paste them
once pasted double click the update file which is a Batch file or .bat
hope that helps!"
