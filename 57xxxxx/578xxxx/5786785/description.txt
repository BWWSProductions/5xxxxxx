* Hello PC great games fans...


* Play the new MAFIA game ...


* The freeware FREEARC is needed to extract the arc file of the game


* FILE INFO : NON-STEAM (can run in directplay without the steam or in the 
steam , is up to the user) , 9 videos worked : they have the ambience sound 
but the subtitles enabled are needed  AND FULLY WORKING GAME SINCE THE 
BEGGINING TO THE END , JUST THE NORMALITY .

* UPLOADER NOTE : 

* this is a nice game and i like to have the files more nice 
as possible to the users , at the moment that i make my first file it was the 
best possible file at that moment but with the updates 1 and 3 for that file 
the users get the fully working game but i like to have a file with 
everything ok and in that perspective i did this 2nd file , now it is only 
play the game thatÂ´s all after following the normal instructions . 
THANK YOU AN HAPPY GAMING TO ALL THE PC GAMERS OUT THERE !!! *
