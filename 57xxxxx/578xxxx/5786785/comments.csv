[V],globeplus,2010-08-24T18:25Z,"The difference is thatb the updates 1 and 3 are already included on hte file in a correct way and this executable that i include that is in the update 3 for the first file already have users reported that getted level 12 or more in front on the game with this executable , so saying that with this executable it is fully working game probably is not saying too much , so like i said after the necessary updates and after getting the game fully working i tough in my conscience that probably not too much a little positive remake with everything perfect of the first file and with the extra updates already included , everything to simply if it is possible the gameplay to the possible users . thank you and enjoy your game ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-24T18:28Z,"About the videos , the file have 9 videos with ambience but no voices but it is just enable the subtitles and noproblem about that and the first presentation video was reworked to get integrated voices on the videos like the original , so in everything that was possible i did the best work possible and my conscience is totally happy about the work . thank you ."

[V],globeplus,2010-08-25T03:01Z,"To assclowns : do acomputer restart before making the extraction and to make the extraction correctly is needed close 1 gb ram and backround applications can always make interferences at the extraction moment , so do only the extraction afte a computer and finally if yo have the ram and doing this recomendations and still not work in last case you need a freearc reeinstall and that´s all"

,Ocelots019,2010-08-28T20:29Z,"Hmmm not sure if it has to do with your rip but I noticed something. When you shoot walls or structures, normally when I played the steam demo, particles would fly off and shatters on the floor. Now on this rip, when I shoot a structure, particles fly off too but they dissapears when they touch the floor. It has probably soemthing to do with an APEX files.

I don't think it's my computer aswell cause, as I told you, it was doing fine on the steam demo and I configured the video settings the exact same thing in you copy than in the demo. APEX is at medium and so was it on the demo and the particles were shattering on the floor.

No big deal tho. It's just a little detail I noticed so can you tell me if it's normal and it was intentional or maybe it's just a bug?

,miguel0914,2010-12-03T05:46Z,"Ok, I got so far as to extracting the Mafia II folder to FreeArc, now when I extract it to downloads folder, its only goes to 3% and finishes. So when I go to look through the extracted folder, it has very minimal subfolders and files. There is only shaders and video folder in PC folder and nothing else. Not even Globe Converter. But I can see all the files that didn't get extracted appear in the PC folder and everything else in the FreeArc folder of it. I installed the C++ and DirectX. What did I do wrong? Note that I accidently setup the TPTB first then later installed the software that came with it."
