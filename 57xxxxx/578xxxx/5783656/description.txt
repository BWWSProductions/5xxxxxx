In a hospital on the outskirts of 1920s Los Angeles, an injured stuntman begins to 
tell a fellow patient, a little girl with a broken arm, a fantastical story about 5 
mythical heroes. Thanks to his fractured state of mind and her vivid imagination, the 
line between fiction and reality starts to blur as the tale advances.
