this is the copy of memento that i have...somebody requested it a while ago and i checked to see if there were still seeders and there is so i am not going to upload it"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-08-25T02:50Z,thank you for this movie and the american pie series..
[T],ctang,2010-08-27T18:28Z,"by the way that american pie stuff shouldnt be at the top, just in case you noticed lol"
,Yaggy,2010-08-27T20:46Z,"Man, you really squeezed the video in this. Instead, you could've scissored off the extras. Video quality is not worthy of being called a DVDR."
[T],ctang,2010-08-28T01:35Z,"+1 Agentbay...thank you

@yaggy:  look dont download from me again because obviously you dont appreciate it...o and the only extra that is included is aerosmiths music video, which i happen to like so i kept it...i know other people probably want it too and since it was only about 300mb i figured i would keep it...if you dont like it this then delete it...your not out any money"
[T],ctang,2010-08-28T03:02Z,next will be Furry Vengeance and then Death At A Funeral
,omegafox84,2010-08-28T07:18Z,@ctang: i think that's pretty awesome you not having the best internet speed but still sharing all these great movies with us. thanks!
