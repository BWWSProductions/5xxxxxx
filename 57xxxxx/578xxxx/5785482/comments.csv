Excuse the ignorance, he who asks question is stupid for only 10 mins n shit."
,thankuforurhardwork,2010-08-24T10:30Z,Thanks for the upload!
,RadiantBastard,2010-08-24T10:38Z,"1. Unpack release with winrar (rightclick and choose extract here)
2. Mount image with Daemon Tools Lite
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads
3. Install
4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to your
installation directory and overwrite
5. Play the game"
,Marcholt,2010-08-24T11:02Z,"This is pre-release version of the game, basically beta...released just to pirate it...
The proper patch that is about to update the game to the release version comes out today or tomorrow on Impulse. "
,BigFuzzy,2010-08-24T12:55Z,"THIS is one of the few games that people should support. Small(ish) dev team who really cares about us gamers. 
So give 'em your support and buy this one. 
And no, i'm not anti-pirating.. I pirate the sh!t out of stuff, (looking at you JoWood.. get a game right and we'll not pirate as much to make sure it works), just saying THESE guys def deserve you buying the product. 
:)"
,Rawmeat,2010-08-24T13:49Z,@lneagul update?! There's no download link...
,Evenos,2010-08-24T19:07Z,meh the graphics and all look kind of bland from the preview it appears to be a step down from sins of the solar empire which was a fun rts game. im not really sure how this game will fare...and it really would have been better if they had made a more detailed and better looking sins of the solar empire 2 rather then this! but i'll try it out...
,Khettien,2010-08-24T19:22Z,"sr-ewom.r30-39 and sr-ewom.sfv aren't showing up as valid archives, for me at least. Using the latest copy of Winrar(english 64); anyone else having this problem? Can't go further without being able to extract."
,Thany,2010-08-24T19:40Z,"It doesn't work...
I tried few times to reinstall and always get :


This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
"
,Thany,2010-08-24T19:50Z,Same error with 1.01 patch... 
,Thany,2010-08-24T20:25Z,Why can't I see most of comments ?!?!
,ntts,2010-08-24T20:27Z,"Game won't run?

Go to the \redist\DirextX subfolder and run vcredist_2005sp1_x86.exe then try again."
,Thany,2010-08-24T20:37Z,"ntts

Doesn't work for me.I hope there be other releases soon (with 'skidrow' I already had problems).  I wanna try game before buying 'original'."
,huldus,2010-08-24T22:36Z,"Aye, i get the same error as above. It has something to do with .net. Ive been downloading updates and patches for .net from windows update. Nothing works. Ive tried to install that service pack as well, does not work. Something odd really."
,Thany,2010-08-25T00:02Z,"@ huldus

'Try' latest Framework and tell us what happen.
I deleted whole game, so I can't try."

,stubbieaussi,2010-08-25T13:00Z,"Torrent downloaded and installed fine.
But I'm unable to get this to work under XP 32bit.
Screen goes black for a second then back to desktop.
However installing under win7 64bit the game plays fine.
This is a dual boot pc so it appears it is not a hardware issue.

Can anyone confirm they can run this torrent under XP?"
,Morfessa,2010-08-25T22:05Z,"Thank you very much!
Installed smoothly and works just fine (win7-64bit)."
,Gornax,2010-08-26T11:08Z,Game crash all the time....
,naruto27,2010-08-26T15:46Z,"Does anyone know how I can deal with the ""The application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect"" message when I press the exe? My system is XP SP3 with updated graphic drivers."
,elementalbeast,2010-08-27T09:25Z,"Heres some fixes to problems I had:

If you are getting  ""The application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect""

You need to make sure you have all the Visual C++ 2005/2008 redistributables from Microsoft installed. Then you need to place ""
Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest"" and ""msvcr80.dll"" in the same folder as your Elemental.exe. I cannot 100% say that you need .Net Framework 3.5, but its also possible (its something I tried). With the combination of all these things the error should stop.

If your game never starts after you pick your hero or try to start the campaign and you either get a black screen (campaign) or an infinite animated screen (sandbox):

You need to apply ALL of the Skidrow patches. 1.01, 1.05 and the 1.05 /w hotfix patch. You do not have to copy the cracked content over everytime but you MUST install ALL of these patches in order. Also make sure they are going to your Elemental folder because the installer defaults to something else. If you changed your install folder, then double check.

Random crashes and other game problems are NOT Skidrow's fault ATM. The game needs many more patches. I honestly do buy games if I like them, but can't say I'd buy this one until its patched to a reasonable state of enjoyment. Its still very beta.

,naruto27,2010-08-27T13:48Z,"The bug fixes elementalbeast so generously offered, are not working for me. I have installed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005/2008 redistributables, .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, DirctX latest edition, I even copied Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest"" and ""msvcr80.dll"" to the directory, but nothing works.
I've had enough with this game. I'm not going to waste any more time on this game or the company. I just looked at their site and they sell the game for 50$. I say they should pay their programmers a bit more since they are obviously bored.
I guess I'll play a skirmish in Starcraft 2 to let some steam out. If only more companies were like Blizzard. "

You will find the Skidrow folder when you ""open"" the mounted iso file."
,StarPhishPrime,2010-08-30T12:15Z,"Do not download this torrent. 
There is nothing wrong with the torrent itself but this game is absolute shit. I have the game fully patched, (and i've read posts saying its both better when and when not patched, which is correct?!) the game crashes as often as people are raped in RL.

The CEO of stardock is apologizing for even releasing the game. Maybe it because every time you try to load while already in a game, it crashes, or there's a certain turn threshold (somewhere after 300) where it ALWAYS crashes. And my PC completelyowns the requirements. The game is unplayable, and i feel dirty for even having downloaded it."
,StarPhishPrime,2010-08-30T12:17Z,"Oh yah, alt-tabbing the game is also just a gamble of crash. I could have gone and totaled my car and had more fun in the time it took to try and get the game to work for more than 7-10 minutes."

pls link all the patches u have mentioned

,mroach00,2010-09-02T01:23Z,"Is anyone else having problems with the patches? I installed 1.01, .05, and .06 but it is saying they are corrupted. Is this the patch or the crack?"
,Cody900,2010-09-02T04:20Z,Where is the 1.05 patch?
,Cody900,2010-09-02T04:49Z,"Well, found the patches, patched up to 1.06, but every time I save the game, exit, and re-open, my saves are gone, they don't save.

Any fix for that?"
,darkstar723,2010-09-02T07:50Z,"The Corrupt Patch message is easy to fix, set your clock to before September 1st, and its gone, no need to worry about internet connection/etc."
,Cody900,2010-09-03T18:01Z,"Yes it's right Champurado, the save files are created in My Documents, but they're just not on the list in Load Game, and I can never Continue. 

Waiting for patch 1.07 now and just hoping."
,entloch,2010-10-04T02:44Z,"Any chance of getting a 1.09 update here?  Stardock might actually get another sale if a significant number of the /many/ issues are fixed.  Not about to buy the game to find out.

Perhaps if a game company made the promise of trees that grow actual money, I'd be enough of a sucker to try it out."
,Smil3yAquAz,2010-11-16T07:23Z,I want a several Number All works but i need a code!!!!
,Fartalot,2011-01-06T11:10Z,"I am getting ""This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix the problem."" every time I try to run Elemental.exe. I have the C++ redistributables. I also have some .NET framework, but not sure of the version."
,Fartalot,2011-01-06T11:30Z,"I fixed my problem by copying the files ""Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest"" and ""msvcr80.dll"" in the same folder where Elemental.exe is. So even though I do have the C++ redist installed, I still had to find these files on my drive, and copy them also to the ""C:\Program Files\Stardock Entertainment\Elemental War of Magic"" directory.   Thanks to elementalbeast for the good tip!"
,CaptainCapsaicin,2011-01-19T08:18Z,"Initially tried installing this and then the 1.11 patch before running it for the first time.

FOREVER SPLASH SCREEN.

Following suggested method of installing patches 1.01, 1.05, 1.05 with hotfix. Then I'll continue on with 1.09, 1.10, and 1.11, renaming/deleting datafix.exe from the main game folder if it hangs there again.

Will repost on failure/success."
,CaptainCapsaicin,2011-01-19T08:50Z,"Okay, updating worked by installing each patch in order: 1.01, 1.05, 1.05 hotfix. 1.06 stuck me on the splash screen again, so I rebooted and deleted DataZip.exe from the main game folder. Worked perfectly. Continued on starting from 1.09 and every patch worked up to 1.11, but I had to delete DataZip.exe each time.

1.09+ say they have all the previous content, so you should be able to install the game and then just patch 1.11 (deleting DataZip.exe), and it should work fine. I just wanted to document the updating process. :)"

,prfella,2011-04-11T09:14Z,"Deleting Datazip.exe will get past the loading screen. However, now that I get to the selection screen, I cant click on anythhing other than ""options"" ""workshop"", and ""exit"" . I cant click on new game to start a new game. Anyone know how to get around this?"
,Kamianbu,2011-06-06T03:13Z,"My god, you're all a bunch of whiny girls.

I've downloaded this game and played it for months and I never had a single crash.

True, it's boring as hell but it is somewhat fun for those who enjoy turn based games."
