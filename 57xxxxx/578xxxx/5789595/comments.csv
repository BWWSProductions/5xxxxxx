If ur a fan of the game - MAJOR disappointment!
Jin is a lil pussy. Favourite character Paul isnt even in it (name gets mentioned once!) Martial Law is an arrogant prick (not his character) plus MANYY other disapppointments! Only plus about this movie is Christie Montero (HOT) although not linked to Eddie in ANY way! not even fighting style! producers obviously had never played any of the tekken games b4!!"
