[V],Alia_Erenel,2010-08-26T17:31Z,"@Yaggy, this is not a forum. But you are right, these uploads are not in the right category.

@akshar3375, I just moved all of your uploads into the right category, which is Video>Movies.
DVDR are full DVD rips.
If you have any concerns, please join us on the Suprbay forums or on TPB's IRC channel."
