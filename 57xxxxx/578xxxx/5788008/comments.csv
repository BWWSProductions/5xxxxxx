,jarred007,2011-01-11T09:59Z,"sorted! you just have to manually search for the folder after chapter 3. Manually search for chapter 4 in FCP7 and it will open up. This training DVD is amazing! use daemon tools on windows to open the .iso file and watch the dvd. goto http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads

you dont need to burn it onto a dvd"
