Note:
My thx goes out to PrisM, IMAGINE, KINGDOM, TA, and all of you guys that puts some of there magic in every release.
I personally used the one that -rx released , played with the angles and try to fix the darkness from the camera.I filtered the audio and bitrated at 320 .. for a coupled of time you will see people passing...if you already saw PrisM release you already know what I mean...Please seed and leave comments...oh the video was encoded on video 1080p
