you already requested me for that movie, i accepted your request and i'm downloading the source , please don't request the same movie from different uploaders if one of them already accepted your request  as it will result in multiple posts "

For transfoemers , visit pluto999 Account

@ Newip

you can get matching subs easily from opensubtitles.com

@ techstar

I will do it ...... give me 2-3 days

@ all

Gunesrock is right 
Its alright to request a movie from different encoders, but if one encoder has agreed to do it infrm about it to other encoders & cancel ur requests. I am sure no one would mind"
,invader123,2010-08-23T14:48Z,THANKS
,moviz247,2010-08-23T16:20Z,"Finally ...........
Thank u !!!!!!!!!!!!
Quality just as i expected ..................

Will u consider doing ""serendipity"" ??? 
Waiting for reply ..."
,wira020,2010-08-25T18:30Z,"@newip
use subscene.com and opensubtitle.com for subtitle.. try em if it match your movies.. i hope you know how to use srt file with video file...

Had just finished watching this... a/v is perfect.. no artifacts whatsoever at 1080p... I'm serious, some movies have some artifact, but this isnt one... btw, subs that is muxed withing this movie doesnt show... i hard to use the one included... or is it just a chapter file?.. 

p/s: I wish you guys have a forum somewhere to hang out and for movie request... it'll be easier to not have the same request done by a few people... i think it's just a waste when that happen... please consider this.."
,wira020,2010-08-26T20:35Z,"@newip, no probs..  I sumtym have trouble with subs too.. but now I usually just check the framerate of the video then download subs with the same framerate.. usually, it'd match.. and sometime subs for the movie just doesnt exist.. "
