Encoders Notes: A very good quality screener however there are a series of water marks that appear every 15 mins. Firstly a scrolling warning from the MPAA regarding piracy in which nothing can be done with this as a big blur to cover this would ruin the movie. Next the ID tag appears top right which has been blurred out, and then lastly the picture goes black and white for 10 seconds, please do not adjust your television sets lol. These watermarks only appear 6 times in the movie so over all do not ruin this otherwise great quality screener. Enjoy :)
