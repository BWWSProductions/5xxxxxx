Alannah Myles [born December 25th 1958 in Toronto, Ontario] is a Canadian singer-songwriter. Her first self Â­titled album [1989] produced four Top 40 hits, 'Love Is', 'Lover of Mine', and 'Still Got This Thing', as well as the number one international smash, 'Black Velvet', for which she won a Grammy award for best female rock performance, along with several Juno Awards, a Diamond award for sales in excess of 1,000,000 in Canada - the only artist who still retains this status for her debut record. An inspiration to all recording artists around the world, Alannah Myles has hit the highest highs - winning a Grammy award and selling multi-millions of records. Alannah has met every challenge an artist can be hit with, facing them head on with the tenacity of one of the most determined artists in the history of the music business.

After an eight year hiatus which she calls â€œpeacefulâ€ Alannah has re-emerged, energized, with her sixth album, and has chosen to call it 'Black Velvet' in order to re-connect with her millions of fans. 'Black Velvet' contains all brand new studio recordings along with 'Black Velvet 2007', a new recording with a contemporary arrangement of her classic hit. Produced by hotly touted Torontonian Mike Borkosky, 'Black Velvet' was released in Europe in October 2007, and was released in N.America on March 25th 2008.
