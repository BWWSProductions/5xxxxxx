http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203100/ 
If not I can upload DVDR here to fulfill the Fukasaku tag. "
[V],polifem2009,2010-08-25T05:23Z,"that'd be great, but I suggest wait a little until we get to the '80s...and the link is to another gate of youth,, not fukasaku's...Fly high, fly sure, catch all the rabbits down there"
,m1xalis,2010-08-25T12:07Z,I know there's a lot of requests but is it possible to seed on Maboroshi and After Life please? Anyone? I promise I 'll seed for months after that..Thank you in advance.
,m1xalis,2010-08-25T12:09Z,They are being seeded to be exact but all i'm getting is 2 to 8 kb/s download rate..
[V],polifem2009,2010-08-25T20:32Z,"ok, but after the pending 2 fukasaku ( 2 days)"
,scv42,2010-08-26T05:35Z,"As always, thank you for the quality uploads.
Is there any chance that you have a copy of Teshigahara's last collaboration with Kobo Abe ""The Man Without a Map"" with English subtitles?  I'm dying to see it.  Thank you!"
