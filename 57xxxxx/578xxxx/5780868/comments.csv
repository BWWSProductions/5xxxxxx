,Dimmis80,2010-08-22T15:13Z,"Hi guys.I first burn it in a TDK 4.7 DVD +R(All my other games are in Verbatim 8.7 or 4.7 +R) so it might be the case it don't read it and i got an ""Mixed media DVD"" message or something.For a moment apears but in an instance it disapears from the game library.So do i need a Verbatim for that or with the TDK i am cool and its an another reason it wont work.??And second i make the folders like this:Content\0000000000000000\58410A59\00D0000\the game file.!Do i have to put in frond of Content a folder named Partition3 or its an another matter.??Any help would be much appreciated.
