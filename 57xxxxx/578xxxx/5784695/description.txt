2010 release, the seventh album from the multi-million selling R&B artist. Following the success of his platinum selling 2008 release Here I Stand, Raymond v Raymond takes you on a journey through the dichotomy of man. Raymond v Raymond opens up another chapter of Usherâ€™s coming of age as he tells the story of balancing the challenges of day to day life as an evolving man while jumping back on the scene as a sex symbol and fearless superstar entertainer. With the help of some of the biggest producers in music including Polow Da Don, Jim Jonsin (Lollipop), Danja (Sober), and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Raymond v Raymond is sure to paint a vivid portrait of growth, triumph, defeat and happiness.
