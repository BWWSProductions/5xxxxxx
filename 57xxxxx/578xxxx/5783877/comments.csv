,sv504,2010-08-23T07:47Z,"bare? No way! Bear, yes ;-)"
,ricksell86,2010-08-23T10:58Z,lol. typo. I'm seeding again now. internet went off during night!!
,zappaz123,2010-08-23T14:33Z,"went off !! - so You set up a trap to catch that runaway internet :)

btw: pls supply an index - maybe we allready have most of tha books"
,ricksell86,2010-08-23T16:44Z,"They are way too many to list, but I'll name a few.
Programming- languages I already listed, many books on these, and many on assembly. 
Cryptography- many books including bruce schneiers applied crpytography.
Networking- tcp/ip, network warrior, wifi books, hacking exposed collection, nmap, wireshark.
Algorithms- introduction to algorithms, many others and many language specifics.
I am bored of listing now, maybe I'll create a new torrent not in a zip file so you can choose.
All the books I have collected over time from other torrents, so I thought I'd give something back."
,sv504,2010-08-23T17:37Z,Seed please!!
,ricksell86,2010-08-23T19:11Z,"Also there is quite a few books on html, php and javascript.
Books on boring stuff like information theory, compression and discrete maths too."
,sistromo,2010-08-23T23:17Z,"A list of the books in the torrent would be most welcome. I am sure you can appreciate that one would not be amused if after downloading some 5GB worth of books one were to discover that one already has all the books interesting to one in the package ;-) Yes, another torrent to download the list would be great."
,isak162,2010-08-25T06:12Z,why zip it? better to let people choose which they want to dl.
,ricksell86,2010-08-25T09:54Z,Why fucking make a torrent at all when all you do is fucking complain. You can get fucked isak162 that was the last straw. Say goodbye to the torrent. Ungrateful twats.
,LatinSoldi3r,2010-08-26T05:32Z,"Wait ricksell86!! Don't stop seeding please. I know there are a lot of twats on this world but what can we do, they're like a plague. But there are people that appreciate it, even if they don't live a comment. I really want this torrent so please... and thank you."
,ricksell86,2010-08-26T09:43Z,"Its ok I have continued to seed, but I have limited it to 5 peers at a time as it slows my connection down. Thanks for the only appreciative comment :-)"
,ricksell86,2010-08-26T10:58Z,"Wish there was a way to contact users, as I have made a new torrent, a much better one, not in a zip file, well organized and deleted some duplicates, I would just let you have it. There is no way I'm posting it now after the abundance of snide remarks. Oh well! "
,LatinSoldi3r,2010-08-26T19:53Z,"Thanks! I appreciate it, but would there be any problems if i leave my email? I don't want people spamming me wanting the torrent too. :-)"
,ricksell86,2010-08-27T11:37Z,"Your welcome for the books. I think I will release the other torrent. I know what you mean with the chm files, not particularly keen myself.
Sorry about the many duplicates in the last one didn't realise myself until making the new one. The new one is only 4.3gb and it's not zipped."
,Karablatt,2011-02-02T20:31Z,"I have zipped 5GB of book files and give no information about the contents, other than, you won't be disappointed.

Also - I am a fucking imbecile."
,ricksell86,2011-04-06T19:22Z,"don't fucking download em then u fucking dick!! How many fucking torrents have u bothered to go through the trouble of making and uploading, i didnt have to do it, did I?
