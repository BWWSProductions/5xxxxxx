,DaBigSky,2010-09-01T18:35Z,Save your time.  The Jews A (short) History:  Became God's chosen people. Rejected God and set up a King. The kings lead the people astray and God sends them to exile. The Jews came back from exile with the stain of Babylon. God sends Jesus to get them back on the path; they kill Jesus and persecute his followers.  God sends the Romans to wipe Israel off the face of the earth as Jesus foretold.  Remnant Jews are scattered to other lands where they continue to stir up shit.  The lords and Kings occasionally put them in their place. They become JEW-lers and Bankers.  Use their ill-gotten wealth to oppress man for their gain of world domination.  They have chosen to take on their own by corruption and force what God promised them only if they remained obedient to him. If this truthful statement is hatefulâ€¦.you hate the truth.  Which makes Jesus is the biggest anti-Semite of them all and if you want to hate that you are showing your true colors.

I may be an Atheist, but that doesn't mean I can't respect the many different religions and there believers.

Thank you rambam1776, I hope this documentary will enlighten me more on the history of the Jewish people."

[V],rambam1776,2010-10-06T06:28Z,"The 'brown' Jews (I assume the writer refers to the Sephardic Jews) get along just fine with the European Jews (the Ashkenazi). Further, anyone may convert to Judaism. I could go into more detail, but why not simply watch the video series and see it for yourself?"
