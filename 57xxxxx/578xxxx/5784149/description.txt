+[Audio problems in the podcast files caused me to have to wait for better quality files. That's why the torrent was later that usual.  You can listed to the original first three minutes in 1st_3mins_of_original_Hour1podcast.mp3]+





The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.


The Infowars web site describes today's show:

On today's Sunday Edition, Alex talks about the latest BP oil gusher developments, the continuing deterioration of the economy, and the next round of flu hysteria.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
