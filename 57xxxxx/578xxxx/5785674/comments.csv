So i just need to change settings but where, i cant in game because i cant see no nothing, the game works but i cant see, graet maybe playing blind...

There is no error message displayed it just crashes straight away.

Any help would be greatly appreciated

P.S. i have updated all DirectX, Graphics Drivers, and PhysX drivers, but to no avail.

P.P.S your update files have been removed from the server you uploaded them making them impossible to use.
