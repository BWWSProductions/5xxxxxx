I mean, production is quite good, but the release is scheduled for about a month, so I was wondering about that... anyway, I listened to the whole album (thanx to you!) and... well, I'll be honest... This isn't the best what Tolkki has to offer, in my oppinion... Age of Aquarius had a few cuts (tracks 2, 6, and especially 7 and 8) that were among the best pieces of music I've ever heard - and believe me, I've heard a lot of music! Though New Era and Trinity are generally good albums, Age of Aquarius is where Tolkki really shined... If you want to discuss anything further, just mail me to theheadquake@hotmail.com, and I'll answer your mail in the closest possible time, ok? Thanx for RR torrent(s) posted!"

Well you know out in internet all things come 1st ;P Agree with you that Age of Aquarius is the best of the 3 RR albums, to bad thoo this one is the last :( but when it comes to to Tolkki i preffer listen to Stratovarius. And i really hope Tolkki has some new things going on in the future to come."
