L. H. Grund is a project with only one member, that is, myself. It was originally
created for a quite special girl, but grew to be something more -- a break from my
work as a metal musician in favor of something more accessible (but not necessarily dull).
Musically, it is gloomy but not without a sense of hope. Lyrically, it is a personal struggle,
a battle of the mind, ett biokemiskt stÃµllningskrig.

My name is Lars Henrik Grund. I am 20 years old and I live in the bittersweet midwest of Sweden.
All tracks were recorded, mixed, mastered and/or programmed by me in a casual and somewhat
unprofessional setting (my room), using pretty basic hardware like a mic, a preamp,
a HagstrÃ·m guitar and my trusty software instruments.

Last but not least: intellectual monopoly sucks, so you have my permission to treat this album
however you want as long as you don't use it for commercial purposes and give me credit as the creator.
