,tpbuser9588,2011-01-04T08:12Z,"Hey I'm using VLC player and the video and audio works perfectly, I just dnt know how to activate the subtitles for it... Please help! "
,FreakyFresh420,2011-01-07T22:37Z,"To ACTIVATE the subs just go to the top and select
video> subtitles tracks. It's quite simple...as for the subtitles not matching up, i guess, it's because when they made it originally in japanese they put subs in for english but when it was actually recorded in english they had to make changes to some of the words...."
,FreakyFresh420,2011-01-07T22:39Z,OH and if anyone really wants episode 29 i can put it up...the only problem is that it would be in .OGM form....i think i got rid of it cause it bugged me
,FreakyFresh420,2011-01-07T22:47Z,Oh and if everybody REALLY wants episode 29 then i can up it BUT it will be in .OGM format...It bugged me-- i think thats why i deleted it
,Barroquecore,2011-01-20T20:10Z,I've downloaded 6 episodes so far and they're looking great. Thanks a lot.
,nickhawaii,2011-02-04T12:20Z,Please upload episode 29! I was under the impression that this was COMPLETE! :P Whether it's .ogm or .mkv doesn't matter in my opinion; just as long as I get the entire series.
,Barroquecore,2011-02-04T13:40Z,I got corrupted files from 144 to 167. The video shows but only frozen frames.
,MiniHP,2011-02-07T19:37Z,is this in english or english sub

,LaciBug,2011-03-22T03:19Z,I had trouble cause it said i had a I/O Device error...:/
,wbryan515,2011-03-27T09:43Z,is there a certain media player that i have to use for this type of file or something ? it says its not compatible or something 
,FreakyFresh420,2011-04-08T04:48Z,VLC PLAYER DUH!
,drakeluvr,2011-04-16T00:28Z,"I use VLC media player also, not sure if its my connection to the TV or what, but for some reason I get a buzzing sound in the English audio track on occasion. Not sure if its from the torrent or the connection from my computer to my TV as I said. Just thought I would post this here to see if others have experienced the same phennomenon. Thank you for the download though :o) Even Netflix doesn't have it in English and I hate reading subtitles because they move so fast at times, lol."
,drakeluvr,2011-04-16T00:32Z,"I use VLC media player also. I do not know if its the torrent, my player or my computer to TV connection, so I thought I would post this here to see if anyone else has experienced this phennomenon. While watching the first episode, I noticed that I get some kind of interference like a vibration or something in the English audio track. Thank you so much for posting this torrent though, not even Netflix has it in English."
,drakeluvr,2011-04-16T00:34Z,Sorry for double post.
,drakeluvr,2011-04-16T23:47Z,"Okay, thought I would write in and say that the vibration effect I was experiencing was from my computer and sound card. When I burned to DVD sound was fine save for being out of sync on a few episodes. Thanks again for the great torrent. Perhaps I can edit the audio/video in my burning software and get it to sync up."
,1ThtGuy,2011-04-17T01:54Z,i havent even finished the dl but i will seed for a week just because of your description section... I live by the puff puff pass rule
,xcarax,2011-05-03T19:45Z,Thanks for this 
,xcarax,2011-05-03T19:49Z,"Thanks for this ! 
Although I have a problem. I can't get the subs working. I'm watching with VLC and the audio works, but subtitles doesn't. I went to video -> subtitles and there's ""track one"" which is actually selected already. Still, there's no subs. Can anyone help me? I really hate watching dubbed version but I don't understand japanese without subs."
,soljahs,2011-05-14T13:31Z,"plz seed, cheers for the upload and all those who are already seeding."

,curbgod666,2011-06-29T04:42Z,Is anyone else having problems with the video starting around episode 100? 
,AznBoi805,2011-06-29T09:35Z,"is this english dubbed? 

or does any1 know this whole series is in english dubb? 

cuz i h8 watching it and the characters talk in another language i cant understand. plz tell me they talk in english  "
,curbgod666,2011-06-30T08:37Z,@AznBoi805 it's in both english and japanese. You can choose the audio track with VLC.
,Ariask,2011-10-11T18:36Z,You're missing ep 29.
,Neetlers,2011-10-24T00:42Z,"I dunno if this is just me but at ep65 i get the subs and jp audio for ep64, the eng is still ok but i watched this far in jp and just aint right. 
Also if anone has ep29 with subs would be great."
,carriecelery,2011-11-23T21:05Z,Great torrent thank you! English audio. Episode 29 is missing.
,Ynoi,2011-12-12T02:46Z,"Quality is shit, try it in AVI format at an average of 150/195MB file at the same resolution on ALL the episodes. I don't bother downloading Anime from torrents because people modify and fuck around with the files. Want the best quality? then buy the physical version of the series on DVD like I have. don't think that I will upload it. SO SUCK SHIT I suppose!"
,windedturtle,2012-01-03T17:01Z,"NOT HAPPY! Just spent the last 4 days downloading, and I can not get a single episode to play!!!"
,geodracula,2012-02-04T12:26Z,"It won't work for me D: 
It took over 12 hours to download and now it won't work.
VLC Player is my default player and when I click a video, it just does nothing... If I right click on it, it just completely crashes out.
Does anyone know a solution please?"
,geodracula,2012-02-04T12:31Z,"Oh wait, for some reason VLC Player isn't working at all on my laptop now -_- I used to watch everything on that, but now it just keeps crashing out. Luckily this works in DivX. Thanks for UL man, awesome job!
Bit gutted episode 29 is missing, but I'll just pick it up elsewhere!"
,rexfd3slvr,2012-03-23T23:40Z,"great torrent...subtitles are annoying, but hey it's the whole damn series... The only thing is once I got to ep. 48 some of the episodes were in japanese...not sure how many of them but there's a handful of japanese episodes mixed in"
,angelpet89,2012-03-24T03:36Z,"has taken me 3 days to get to 78.4%............. come on guys stop being shit and Seed please. i seed for 2 weeks at least after every download so please SEED !!!
