,Dimmis80,2010-08-24T19:41Z,Hey guys.Why u took u so long..Kidding Dudes.I have use a crack which i can play the full game but there are CTD issues when u go to chapter 7 and i must then use an another Crack.And they say about the second crack that it CTD the game.Can i use your Crack in my game(Mafia 2 Clone DVD) so i will not have CTD issues or your Crack works only with this release.??Can i continue from my corent save game-chapter.??

Good Job SKIDROW

,Vanwa,2010-08-24T19:49Z,Legit? cause it seems much smaller than the clonecd copy that had no crack past ep 10.. ^^ thank you nevertheless extreme SKIDROW all u guys own :D and everyone remember to SUPPORT THE DEVS if you like it ^^
,JS12,2010-08-24T19:57Z,Attention! Crack does NOT work! You have low health at chapter 2!
,Vanwa,2010-08-24T19:57Z,woops double post :/ sry
[T],extremezone,2010-08-24T20:03Z,"Additional Notes:

If you have used any of these hacked demo cracks out there,
then make sure you start a new game, as your old saves will
make the game crash. The main reason: it wont work is because
those ""cracks"" are modified demo exes

just tested by me - real deal , working 100% , no false positive virus (as for lots of cracks) , no crashing , no bugs - well done SKIDROW , easy and clean install 

so make sure u don't use only crack over clonedvd/etc versions"

Shut up dude the reason we torrent games is because we have enough financial problems on our hands and games are just too damn expensive. That why we put the time and money into building good PC's.... Obviously people who can't get a torrent to work are gonna ask for help so they can run the game...their ""bitchin"" is justified"

Before I downloaded Mafia II from Skidrow, I downloaded that one from Globe. I had the same error message there :S. That's why I started downloading Mafia 2 from Skidrow since his releases are always nice. So I got the same error message @ two different releasers. Weird isn't it?

,Hesli,2010-08-25T19:44Z,"Ok so I had trouble installing this game but now it works fine. So here's a short guide.

1. Download the game
2.Download phoenix 1.2 ( not 1.4 ) go to instruments > Updatecontent > internet 
3. Now go to instruments > Sid Unpacker
4. Select the .SIM file in your downloaded content and scan it. 
5. Select the game in top and select everything else in the other white screen. There's a button for it aswell but it doesn't take the game in top screen on my pc so. Make sure to select it.
6. Press Unpack! ( make a new folder blabla, unpacking can take very long ) 
7. Go to your mafia2 map and put the crack in the pc map. ( along with the Steam thingy. )
8. Change the date of your computer after 28 of August. You won't need this if your American. 
9. Enjoy yourself. ( Try to get a proper crack, I use the V3 crack now but its kinda laggy somehow. Got to chapter 10 with no problems. will inform you on the rest.
10. IF THIS GUIDE WORKS FOR YOU AS IT DID FOR ME, COPY IT TO OTHER TORRENTS of Mafia 2.

Good luck all. Its a pretty cool game."

3. Install
4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to the

5. Play the game



This downloadable version of the game is completer bogus! 

1. You cannot install without the product activation code t even install the game which is not supplied with this 'cracked' game. You have to go and find your own activation key.

2. There is no 'skidrow' folder on the disc, meaning you cannot even play the game unless you also seperately go and find the cracks.



DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE....IT'S NOT COMPLETE.

You can both eat me. Maybe there is a skidrow torrent that has the crack and activation code all bundled together, but not in this torrent attached to the download linkn above...  I'm not saying the game won't work with them, just that they are not included with this download.

I downloaded the file last night, and the only two files in the mafia 2 download folder was 'MAFiA.2.2010.CLONEDVD.PC-ELiTE.nfo' and 'MAFiA.2.2010.CLONEDVD.PC-ELiTE.iso'.  

THERE WERE NO OTHER FILES....
The nfo file does not have the activation code in it and the iso file when mounted does not have any 'skiwrow' folder on the disc at all.  Without these two pieces of info this game is unplayable.  

So Mr.epicfail88 certainly lives up to his name.

Stop whining, every time a popular torrent is released you start begging for seeders, yet you always get it in the end. Save yourself the energy.

Thank you extremezone, thank you Skidrow. Keep it up."

I Think That's really Kinda Weird. Cuz I was Connected To About 34 Seeds & 238 Leechers

Downloaded @ 187 kb/s T0 456 kb/s

All My Downloaded Well Seeded Torrents Get Well Over 1.2mb/s

Anyways. Leave Ur Settings As I Recommend. You Will See The Difference On a Well Seeded Torrent, As Of Now 25,609 Leechers Are Feeding Of 3579 Seeds. Ratio Difference Of 8 And More So Yes This Torrent Will Be Slow Till >> ??? :("

,rottigan,2010-08-26T18:33Z,"just wanted to say that i got mafia 2 working now (well i can see the screen now, have not played it yet)
If anyone have this problem like I did here is the solution.

1. Listen for the nVidia logo to start and press Esc.
2. Another video will play, press Esc again.
3. Wait a second and press Esc once more.
4. You are now at the Main Menu. Press Down arrow 3 times and press Enter. (you should hear click sounds as you navigate the menus)
5. You are in Options Menu. Press Down arrow 2 times  and Enter.
6. You are in Video Options. Press Down arrow 1 time, then hold down the Left arrow until the click sounds stop.
7. You are going to change the Resolution to 640x480. Press Esc, wait for a second and press Enter, wait 5 more seconds and press Enter again.
8. If you did everything right then you should now see the Video Options menu on screen. Use the arrow keys or mouse to set the resolution up to 1024x768 (or whatever you want), press Esc, press Enter to accept, wait for screen change and press Enter to accept again.
9. Now fully exit the game, restart the game and hope that it saved your changes.

Good Luck."

so while I have no doubt that most people will just ignore it and continue to pirate games anyway, if you don't want the PC to become just an MMO and casual gaming platform, try to buy most of your games if not all of them. If a game is crappy, there's a simple solution: don't buy it and don't pirate it."

I have the same problem as you.. and this goes for the MG42 as well, it fires maybe 5 - 10 shots and then just disapeers, but says you are still on it. then you need to press e twice to get back on it, same thing. I dont know how to change the gun problem. yet..."

If any of you are having this problem, go to your game folder and open the ""pc"" folder then try to run the MafiaII.exe file (this is different from the desktop icon 'cause it bypasses the Launcher) if it tells you to install Physx, do it even if you already have it on your computer.

This worked for me."

Oh and I also had the health bug in chapter 2 where the health keeps on deminishing no matter what. Before you do the fist fight/car stealing bit try go the fridge/bar/cafe and have something to eat/drink it will replenish your health for a while, just enough time for you to finish your missions without dieing."

,Pahvis,2010-08-29T22:34Z,"FFS guys. When i downloaded this i had something like 4k/26k. So stop whining, its not gonna help u.
------------------------

To the real thing; i've played this game a lot, and im in chapter 14 - 16 (around 50% done). The game itself is working just fine and no problems so far. Only one thing is bothering me: 

when i close the game, my screen brightness goes so low that i have difficulties to see whats happening on the screen. I can't adjust the brightness anywhere (as far as i know), so the only thing i can do to fix this is either to restart my computer OR turn my monitor off, then plug out the wire that goes to my graphics card and then plug it back in.

Any way to fix this? It's getting pretty annoying ._. (It happened in the demo too...)

The game itself... is a 9/10. Trust me, it's one of the best games i've ever played..."

That's the problem.

I believe the installer thinks that this game is supposed to go somewhere in steam folder. No, don't do that. U HAVE to custom install it or else it won't work. Just install it anywhere than steam folder (u can make ""mafia 2"" folder in your hard-drive and install there for example).

Also, try shutting down steam while installing.

You may need to install the latest Direct X and PhysX.

Games very good too, it's like Grand Theft Auto, but its fairly linear. Its still fun though, but there isnt really much incentive to go off and explore the town and do sidequests and such, since there isnt much in the game other than the main missions. 

I like how there is more realism when it comes to the other NPCs, like if you speed, or crash into someone, you can get cops on you, and NPCs will notice when you're speeding or if you run a red light or something.

I hate how the cops are EVERYWHERE, you come around a corner, accidentally bump a car, and theres a cop right there to chase you. Its like the game spawns them right when you're about to crash or hit some pedestrian. I've had to replay so many missions due to a random cop spawning RIGHT AT THE END of the mission for me to crash into."

,nittany,2010-09-05T19:53Z,"For those of you having problems, the most likely problems are because you:

1.  You do not have the latest video card drivers and updates for your PC (Also, you need a decent video card to handle this game)

 -Get the latest video card drivers or download the software called ""Driver Genius"" that will update all your drivers on your PC.  It can also backup all your current drivers in case installing a new one causes something to go wrong.  Do a search for it on here.


2.  Whatever program you are using to mount the image to install the game might be old or something wrong with it.

 -Download the most recent version of Alcohol 120% or Daemon Tools and use it to mount the image of the game and install.  I used Alcohol 120%.

3.  Make sure you download the latest crack, I did not use the crack included in this torrent.  I used the Proper SKIDROW crack that I linked several posts back.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS 100%, make sure you are copying the crack files to the right folder and overwriting the original .exe file.

4.  After doing the above 3 steps, if you still can't get the game to work or it's giving you an error message, try installing this game to another PC and see what happens.  If you still get the same problem, most likely you are doing something wrong and just don't know it.


If somebody manages to fix their problem, comment back and tell us what you did to fix it.  Most likely other people are doing the same thing or have the same issue."
,nittany,2010-09-05T20:04Z,"Also, again, make sure all of you follow the directions below....if you have problems read my other post above.

I downloaded this torrent, I downloaded the crack fix, and the DCL or whatever - I applied the new crack fix to the old one once I install everything, I did everything as instructed. But when I start up the application - It either gives me a black screen, and crashes down - or it tells me ""Mafia II is not working"". I have yet to even SEE what the game looks like.. 

Im using a Compaq Presario CQ60 Notebook PC
Procession: Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 900 @ 2.20GHz 2.19GHz
Memory/RAM: 3.00GB
System Type: 32-Bit Operating System

I saw that my system is somewhat behind in graphics and all that in comparison to the minimum requirements, but I even tried playing Call Of Duty - World At War on this laptop, and it PLAYED, but it Lagged HEAVILY. So I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.. If someone could step-by-step instruct me or troubleshoot me on what the problem is, I'd be very appreciative..

I had the same infinite loading screen at the end of Chapter 14 when you have to pay back the loan shark guy with 55K.  

After googling around I found several other people had the same problem, I read if you don't steal money from any stores and instead just crush cars to make the 55K you are fine........so I did that and it fixed the problem.

So after you drop Joe off at the doctor's house, go crush cars to make whatever money you need to reach 55K, I had to do like 2 cars.  Then go pay back the loan shark."

Fantastic release from SKIDROW. Works perfect. Sorta disappointed that after completing all the Story missions, the game simply ends disallowing you from going back and doing side-missions. Oh well. Once again, fantastic, perfect, virus-free, 100% working release from SKIDROW."
,tommara,2010-09-12T02:01Z,"KalTm: I had the same problem. Reinstall it and at the end, tick the boxes to install DirectX and the Phyx engine also (that error means you do not have the latest directX). 

I installed this yesterday afternoon, although can't get past the second mission. He has just got back to America and after sleeping in the house, goes outside and see's someone arguing with his sister and you have to fight the guy. I fight him, but every time he knocks me down with one punch and I can't get back up again (just lays on the ground and he continues to swing into the air above me). How do you get back up??? Or is this some copy protection???"
,dmacco,2010-09-12T02:58Z,"Tommara: Once you get hit, you don't get up, your dead. It took me about 30 tries before I finally beat the fucker enuf b4 he gave up. Follow directions on screen, best bet is to keep space bar pressed down (dodges punch) until he swings, let go of space, hit with right button,couple of times, then hold space again.Keep doing this over & over again.
This game is absurdly hard, you punch a guy 10 times, he hits you once & your dead. When driving, you lightly hit anything & your dead. 
Guys start shooting at you. You come out of cover to shoot back & your dead. It don't even give a second to aim at the mofo's. 
This game doesn't give you an inch, more like 1/1000 of an inch. People complain that this is too short but I'll probably never see the end of it.

,LoRdG0nZo,2010-09-14T19:27Z,"""Anyone have a fix for the low health? The game works but 1 hit or shot and your dead so I cant play the game yet"" 

I had the same problem at first... fixed it by reinstalling the game (though i don't know if this was actually necessary) and then started a game from the second mission. i think the bug stems from the end of the 1st level. when you're on the mg 42 and getting shot on by the germans, you get shot up something bad and you can't leave the mg. your near-death-experiance is somehow getting transferred to the rest of the game. 
after that one i had another bug, where randomly after shooting, i suddenly lost the weapon i was shooting with. but a reboot took care of that one.
otherwise a great game. a little short (about 10 h for me) but really nice story"

Download Power ISO. Install that and reboot. Now, right click on the file sr-mafia2.iso and goto powerISO-mount-drive E:\ (make sure you have set number of drives to atleast 1 first).

Now goto my computer and lord behold, there will be a ""disc"" there called mafia2 probably (idk, i havnt downloaded it). Go into this folder and run the setup. 

Once the setup is finished (this bit is important cause some people are just COMPLETE IDIOTS) copy ALL the files from the DVD you just installed from, into the ""PC"" folder of the game. So copy all the files in the SKIDROW folder. Goto were you installed the game and paste into the ""PC"" folder and overwrite existing files. Now run the exe you just copied and play the game.

@martonas you obviously didn't copy the crack and ran the legit exe. How hard is it to read - ""4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to the
/pc/ folder inside the main installation dir and overwrite""?

@bigsmile92 read my instructions...if you still dont understand it find the folder ""SYSTEM32"" and delete it and then restart your computer. Thanks."

c:\program files\2kgames\mafia II\pc
or
c:\program files(x86)\2kgames\mafia II\pc
depending of your OS (Operating system)

if its in the right place, then try redling directx sdk and directx redist from the microsoft site, or try reinstall mafia II.... or both :P

hope this fixes ur problem"

,Ageagren,2010-09-22T22:17Z,"All right, all you gotta do is to simply download the last version of directx from the microsoft website, then do not forget to copy the skidrow content to the ""pc"" folder in your instalation directory. Then, just go into the file named ""3rd"" and install ""PhysX"". should take only a minute.

Then, run the game from the ""mafia2"" exe that you just had pasted. You're done!

,iibadboyii,2010-10-01T10:50Z,Ok to all THE PEOPLE that are getting errors if u try to install it.. here is the only solution!..: Go to SKIDROW map.. copy all the files and paste it to where you want to install it.. The only reason why u get the error is the needed files is suppose to b in ur computer.. so paste it to anywhere.. 1 of the reasons why u guys still get errors is the clip 1/ clip 2 /clip 3/ clip 4 in SKIDROW map Is needed.. dont think it is a useless clip or something.. After u'v done that install and copy all files from crack and put it in the game folder and go to ur desktop and click the icon of mafia II.. There u go..

Why doesn't it just start the game, and what has steam actually to do with it at all?

,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-10-31T05:12Z,"Awesome freakin game!

Too bad there wasn't more... this game is like a really, really, really good book that you just can't put down, then when it's over, you're sad because you want so much more.

Free roaming after the game would have been nice, throw in some side missions in there, too. It needed more family storylines... especially with the sister. It also needed love interest, a la GTA IV, where u can meet girls and take them out on dates... at least ONE love interest. Every mob guy has a freakin love interest.

Even without all that, it's a great game. Honestly can't wait till Mafia III (where this game continues, i believe)."

This game runs like a dream, default settings 40 frames smooth.  If their is anyone intrested in the specs Ill post them ;^)

Because I am too bothered to read all the comments, is there another crack yet? (only read first 12 pages) other than skid's row one yet?

I am experiencing the exact same problem. In one of the early missions when you have to steal the car from the black gangster guys I just started taking damage even though I wasn't fighting anyone. Now I load the game and I only have 1% health left so I die from anything. Seems like a common bug?

To install it right just...

1. Mount the ISO with Clonedrive or any other equivalent.

4. Open the SKIDROW folder and copy all of it's contents. (Do not move!)

5. Paste them in the PC folder in the Mafia II directory. Let the new .exe overwrite the old one.

I installed everything and moved the cracked content then i downloaded the crackfix and copy and pasted that over, i tried to instal physx and directx but it failed so i did it from the 3rd folder i think cause there is the installers there and they successfully install then i try to launch the game and up comes the little picture but then it goes away and nothing else happens. I tried to install it on my friends comp and his is slightly better than mine and it works fine. my stats are about the same as Chris71689"
,Chilli_jerez,2011-03-30T04:33Z,Alrighty it's working now. If anyone can't get past the little picture or it wont start up or it does and it cancels and your screen goes red you can try this. Firstly go on the nVidia site and update your drivers. go to drivers and downloads and choos the option that automatically tells you which one you need to download. download the installer and then install it. restart your comp and then go to my computer window and in the find box type in videoconfig.cfg wait until it shows up and the directory should by have 2k games in it to know your on the right track. Next open the file using notepad and change the fifth number to a zero (0) this is the screen resolution. save and exit and assuming youve installed it all correctly you should be able to launch it and it should work. comment here if it does or doesnt work for you. and yet again skidrow you rock

,Nukecell,2011-05-13T21:02Z,"First off, thanks to SR for another game. Two probs w the game tho. 1st you will want to DL the updates 1-4 by Skidrow here at TPB-. If you do not, you will get quite a few bugs. The worst of them cause your gun to switch back to unarmed (and that is total death-mode) during gun fights. 2nd prob is the driving lag. This was not cleared up w the updates. I run a 4 gig quadcore w a 1gig radeon 5770 graphics card and NO game lags my comp. Im not sure what causes this, but it makes the car chases challenge mode for sure. A few times i was ready to quit the game completely. Other than that, this is one of the best games ive played for awhile. Good graphics and prob the Best storyline ive encountered to date."
,Thiemok,2011-05-13T21:25Z,This is working on 64-bit system?
,Nukecell,2011-05-13T23:21Z,"I just updated my drivers and the driving lag seems to be fixed. I'd just updated them several weeks ago, and didnt even occur to me that that may have been the prob. So now i give a Giant 9/10 for overall gameplay/graphics. makes the Godfather and Godfather 2 games look like old ps2 rehashes"
,Nukecell,2011-05-13T23:26Z,"Yes it does work for 64 bit. And a little hint for those not using Daemon tools or Alchohol 120 to install on virtual drives. This is a trick i use instead. create a new file folder on desktop, and open the game image with winrar (free online dl) and extract to the new folder. The game setup can then be started from the folder. After install just delete the folder from desktop"
,Nukecell,2011-05-14T22:09Z,"One more thing. For those who may encounter the driving lag and have no idea how to update yer drivers. DL Driver Genius Pro from TPB here.
Let it update and install whats needed. Very easy program, and extreamly useful for gamers to keep their drivers up to date. Hope these posts can help some of y'all. Have a good'n and thanks again to Skidrow Group"

,vjgrinish,2011-05-15T04:53Z,"hello,

download the game, no need for crack.
once download it and then use any iso image software. i used daemon tools.
1> mount image - right click on daemon tools>virtual devices>device 0> m ount image.
2> Browse for the iso file of mafia 2
3> then a window will pop up asking you to run setup or ope files and folders
4> run setup
5> it will install mafia 2 but dont play it now\
6> Again perform the Ist 3 steps and now choose open folder to view files
7> open the skidrow folder, copy all the files
8> Right click on the mafia 2 icon on your desktop>properties>at bottom, open file location and then paste all those files
9> Close that folder, click OK, launch mafia 2 and it will ask you to install nvidi phsyx
10> Start playing the game

This is for all windows xp, vista, win 7
Hope it helps!!!"

1st off, you don't say what your CPU is. 2nd, 5770 is not that great a card. Unless you're running at 1024x768 there are quite a few games you won't be running on high. My last build I had two 6870s and this one I have two GTX560 Titaniums. Get new drivers, lower your settings, and shut up about having an awesome build."

You dont want to copy the iso file and the other file what files you need is: Mafia 2, skidrow, steam_appid, and steamclient.dll.
So go to BD_ROM (I have win7 so this might just work for you guys that has win7)
And when that comes up click on SKIDROW file. Then copy all files there to the pc file, and then you replace em with the old ones.
I had a problem with this and thats why i made this post.

I recommend you check your DirectX and make sure it's up to date. Go to Microsoft's website and download the latest web runtime which will download all updates for DirectX, then try it again. 9 times out of 10 when a game doesn't launch it's due to DirectX being out of date."

I can click on the other options, such as The Story, Options, Exit... but the background is just a black screen.

,NicolasBalan,2011-10-07T14:06Z,"...Thanks to @mothekiller comment  posted on page 51, at 2011-06-03 17:27, I was able to fix my problem regarding Mafia II (game start launching and the little Mafia II icon appears but after that nothing happens!)

     In my case the solution was to: ""For anyone getting confused while trying to install the crack located in the Skidrow folder.  Install the crack in the folder called 'PC' in the mafia II game directory. "" According to @mothekiller.

Install/copy the crack in the folder called 'PC' in the Mafia 2 game directory."" For Windows Users: ""C:\Program Files\2K Games\Mafia II\pc"" this is the right place where you should copy the crack and your game will work fine, also make sure you have the latest DirectX 11. To check your Direct X version follow this step: ""Click the Start button, type ""dxdiag"" in the Search box, and press ENTER. Click the ""System"" tab, and then, under ""System Information"", check the DirectX version number.  Good luck!"

3.3 GHz 6-core
NVIDIA GTX 560
8 GB DDR3 RAM

Nothing overclocked. If you have a similar system, expect good performance. On the other hand, my laptop (2.26 GHz Core 2 Duo, 4 GB DDR3 RAM, Integrated Geforce 9400M GPU) will not run the game in the least.

Just giving some performance information for anyone wondering. I always look for posts like this, as my internet is very slow and I don't want to waste it on games I won't be able to run.

,maltirolas,2012-01-04T20:54Z,"I had 2 problems installing this game. 
First- After putting the crack in the folder MAFIA II in Programs the game woldnÂ´t open. For those who have the same problem, it isnÂ´t the Mafia II folder u should copy the crack is the PC folder inside the Mafia II folder u should copy.
Second- When I started the game it opened for just 2 second and then it closed. For those who have this problem u have to DOWNLOAD the DirectX and the NVIDIA PhysX program to start the game. To do that open the game in the desktop and not in the Mafia II folder. It should open a window saying what of those programs are missing in ur computer and it has the option to download it. If the window doesnt apear go to the Mafia II folder and then open the folder that says 3rd and it has the DirectX and the PhysX programs to download manually.
I hope i was helpfull.
Sorry for my bad english...
Have a Happy New Year... :)"

,TheDutchSlein,2012-04-28T08:40Z,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have a solution to the health loss problem, mind you, I'm not sure if it will work for everyone. All you have to do is get to the 3rd chapter and then it goes away, this worked for both me and my brother. The only problem with this is that you have to fight gangsters, so it took me about an hour and a half to pass. I think that the 2nd chapter still has the problem even after doing this, but so far, the rest of the game doesn't. I hope this helps some others."
