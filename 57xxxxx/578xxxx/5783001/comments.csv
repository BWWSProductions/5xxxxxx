,rebenga2k,2010-08-23T12:17Z,"A 1080p-resolution movie that's over 3Â˝ hours long in less than four gigabytes?

This thing is shit. If you download it, you're a retard. The movie is good, but this rip is bullshit, some home-made half-ass crap by some wanker who doesn't know fuck."

,boboandu2,2010-10-06T23:19Z,i understand why you guys think this is a great upload... i have been downloading this torrent for 2 days.. and i just now reached 23% completed. but i can have 18gb of psp games and download in 7 hours! and no tjust that i have started this b4 i started my psp games and YES you got it. the 18 gb was downloaded faster than this torrent. i thought it was funny.. and to make it better there were less seeders with my games than it was ever with this torrent.. i am not happy canceling this download.. you shouldnt even try it! its not worth the wait! i guarantee
