The Brightonomicon is a novel by British Fantasy author Robert Rankin, the title parodying that of the fictional grimoire the Necronomicon from the Cthulhu Mythos. 

The author lives in Brighton and the book is set in an accurate depiction of the city. The book is based on "The Brighton Zodiac", a map consisting of carriageway constellations found in the city of Brighton and Hove, similar to the landscape zodiacs of Glastonbury and Kingston.

The book was adapted into a 13 part full-cast audio drama in 2008 by Hokus Bloke Productions and BBC Audiobooks, 

The audio series has been re-edited into 28-minute, 30-second episodes to air on the BBC digital and online radio station BBC7.
