It is not enough.

Basically, anyone who wants to download should be able to download at HIS max speed. For 5 downloads on a torrent, which is a realistic estimate, each download should be able to go at 500 kB (kilobytes). So the total bandwidth to satisfy it is 2.5 mB or 25 megabits. The uploads typically go at 100 kB (kilobytes) or 1 megabit. But in reality it is even less. Say, 50 kB.

So, to have a fast download speed, you need about 50 seeders going at 50 kB/sec.

Which means? Which means the number of seeders right now is WAY to small. It should be a number of times bigger. Then, each one of you can download a torrent within minutes and not wait for hours or even days. Clear enough?

How do you know there is sufficient bandwidth for the downloaders? Well, start uploading some torrent, wait for few minutes and look at the ""Peer dl."" field in the Peers tab. If there is enough seeders to satisfy the dl. rate, you should see at least 1 downloader going at a rate of 200 kB, at least. That means this torrent has sufficient bandwidth to satisfy fast download.

Secondly, even if you don't see anybody downloading at the moment, it does not mean you can just stop seeding. They may come and WILL come ANY moment and they should be serviced as fast as possible.

Osho information has to be distributed at a wildfire rate considering what is going on right now.

If you are in any way connected to Osho, it is your OBLIGATION to assure it is a wildfire and not some lukewarm thing.

All Remastered torrents and especially Fluctuation Meditations need to be delivered at the highest rate possible, which is all possible.
There IS PLENTY of people who downloaded to provide all the bandwidth necessary. There is simply no excuse.

If we do not see these torrents seeded at the cream of the crop rate, you may not see any more Remastered versions and forget about Fluctuation Meditations. Those takes weeks to create.

Comprehende?

So YOU decide whether you are willing to seed consciousness better than they seed violence.
At the moment, violence, perversions and disgust are seeded at a 1000 to 1 rate compared to consciousness. Is THIS the world you are interested in living in? What are you doing here anyway? Accumulating, accumulating and accumulating, never having enough?"
,veerenski,2010-08-22T11:26Z,"Good, this torrent is doing just fine right now with 20 seeders. There are several fast downloaders and they are serviced perfectly. Top notch.

Good, keep it this way. We need 20 seeders per 5 downloaders.

This is one of the best series of discourses. Osho talks about the meaning and the essense of Sannyas and ...

Enjoy now. THIS is kind of service Osho likes. Cream of the crop, the best of the best, the best there is."
,veerenski,2010-08-22T21:56Z,"Listen to lecture 5 in this series. It talks about having versus being.

""If you are still lost in the domain of having..."""
,ronaldoo1,2010-08-22T22:41Z,"@veerenski 

What the hell are you babbling about? just shut up and seed. 

anyway I love Osho and I really recommend this very article about the ego. I had a great time reading it. http://deoxy.org/egofalse.htm"
,ronaldoo1,2010-08-22T22:55Z,"im sorry veerenski,  i was very tired and exahasted,, didn't mean to be rude. "
,veerenski,2010-08-23T02:33Z,"Please, NEVER EVER be ""sorry"".
You did what you thought was the thing to do and you had courage to say it and that is about the ONLY thing that counts. I feel in no way offended by what you say.

Glad to see there are some people alive here. Otherwise, looks like a cemetery.

Btw, can you do something from what I was talking about? (Not necessarily in this particular torrent. Just look at other Osho torrens).

If you can, that would make my work easier."
,veerenski,2010-08-23T03:01Z,"ronaldoo1, are you and American, by ANY humble chance?

As far as ""just shut up and seed"", not to worry. We are in a better shape then you think I suspect.

Welcome..."

,HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus,2010-09-10T21:33Z,"Osho was formerly known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his teachings led members of his cult to poison over 700 people in The Dalles, OR in 1984.  He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his teachings are the same - dangerous and insane.  "
,jwrallie,2010-12-12T19:57Z,"Thank you again Veeren, your work is most welcomed, I wish I could help more with seeding, but my connection is crappy here on Brazil. Whoever is in doubt of the importance of Osho's talks should listen to them and evaluate them. Nobody should listen to users like HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus, or anyone else in the whole world, or Osho himself, about what to do or not to do. Instead use your own intelligence to choose what is right or wrong."
,vinayp,2011-01-29T10:52Z,how to increase the seed ?
,drugarica,2011-09-25T21:19Z,"@HeyNonnyNonnyNonnyMus, hi dear, when talking about killing, insanity and danger,
