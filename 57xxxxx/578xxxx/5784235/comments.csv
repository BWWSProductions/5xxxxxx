Your a fucking moron.  The reason your able to download anything is because people seed if they don't see it can take hours and hours for even the smallest file.  So if you want to wait 2 weeks to get your download then good for you but the rest of us would like it sometime this year.  Next time you post make sure you know what the fuck your talking about."
