,GripperStebson,2010-08-28T11:43Z,Great quality v/a but I cant see any hardcoded subs when the Chinese is spoken.  Tried using Quicktime and VLC when playing but no joy.
,LupinII2,2010-08-29T07:36Z,"I'm super pissed. This is the second time I've tried watching this movie and had to stop. The first time I had to stop because it didnt have any subtitles and it was the chinese version, now I finally find the only uncut version with subtitles, and I get this cinavia error code 3 bullshit. WHY CANT I JUST WATCH THE FUCKING KARATE KID IN PEACE!?!?"
,GripperStebson,2010-08-29T17:21Z,Actually my bad it was just a certain section I was previewing where the Chinese didn't have subtitles. Just watched the whole film and the subtitles were there.

,DeviSezni,2010-09-23T10:12Z,"GREAT fuckin speed. Jumped up to 1.5MB/s almost immediately. I am truly fucking impressed. Quality is best i've seen out there for this rip. No issues through playthrough. LOVE IT. I will DEFINITELY continue to seed this until my computer decides otherwise. Everyone deserves this rip and this kind of speed. and if ANYONE has a problem with this rip, they need to grow a fucking brain. kthxbai =3"
