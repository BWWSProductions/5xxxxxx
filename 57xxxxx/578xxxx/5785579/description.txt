Rx NOTES
-----------------
Video Source: Russian Video [THANKS!]
Audio Source: Polishbits [THANKS!]

Well source was kinda dark, tried to brighten up as much as we could with out making the light scenes look weird and colors washed out. Ran it through an RGB EQ, lowering the red quite a bit and the green a tad, also adjusted some other colors. Adjusted contrast, sharpened, denoise etc. Video seems to be overcropped, sorry but not our doing. As for the audio, not bad, however we don't feel that is direct audio as Polishbits had labeled. We did fix the clipped peaks, and there was a lot, along with the clicks and crackles. Then we ran it through an EQ to try and give a little more bass and then muxed to our video. Not the best, but watchable. Enjoy!=]
