,One_Burnt_Potato,2010-08-25T01:10Z,"Yo Day walker, Hope you are having a good day.

I requested a movie called the I spit on your grave (remake 2010)  I know this movie hasnt been released yet so you might not be able to do it. So thanks anyway

But since you cant get that maybe you could try and do the original (if you can) I cant seem to find a handheld version of it here.
Thx, love your work"

,ArtieT,2010-08-25T10:20Z,"Walker put a bit of info in the nfo, but it's wiki that has more info than IMDB this time:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_and_Leo

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907678/

I didn't request this btw, but it sounds like just the sort of antidote to Pixar we need!

Thanks again!"
