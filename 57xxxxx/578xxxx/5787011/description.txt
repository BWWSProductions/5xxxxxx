Movie Nfo - In your typical family, the father is not a magnetic amoral and womanizing genius; the deceased mother is not immortalized by a 12-metre metallic replica; the youngest son does not have electricity literally crackling through
his veins; and the older son â€¼ together with his robotic wiener dog, Pickle - does not pledge to overthrow the entire family order. The Edison family, however, is
far from typical. And Edison & Leo is far from your typical stop-motion animated feature film.
