The songs on TROUBLED BY THE FIRE, Seattle singer-songwriter Laura Veirs's third full-length album, are looser and more atmospheric that her previous work. The foundation is still Americana with an alternative tilt, but producer Tucker Martine creates a more layered sound and Veirs takes more liberties in her phrasings. The lyrics, as well, are more evocative and less narrative than on her previous album, THE TRIUMPHS & TRAVAILS OF ORPHAN MAE. But fans of Veirs's previous work won't be disappointed--the new direction serves only to highlight a wonderful voice and a talented songwriter.

Laura's third album and first one to be released in the UK by Bella Union, in 2003. Received excellent reviews in Uncut, Mojo, and many other publications.

Recorded in Seattle, Washington.

Personnel includes: Laura Veirs (vocals, guitar, banjo, bass, mbira); Eyvind Kang (viola, fiddle); Steve Moore (piano, organ, trombone, celeste); Tucker Martine (drums, percussion, sound effects).

Uncut (5/03, p.91) - 4 stars out of 5 - "...Dreamily intoxicating balladry, sawing strings and near-perfect vocal phrasing....Scintillating stuff..."
