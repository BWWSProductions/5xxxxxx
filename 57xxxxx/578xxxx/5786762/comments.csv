,xCrosseyesx,2010-09-01T01:23Z,"@Nightmare, people will also mod their profiles/while signed in to their profiles, then carry their hard drive over to their clean console to play online. A lot of bans occur from -accidentally- having modified content stored on your profile such as game history."
,tgatlin25,2010-09-02T04:52Z,Please seed!!! Stuck at 99%
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-09-10T22:20Z,"I have been seeding, sorry guys.  I'm at school now and the internet access is strictly monitored.  I got home for the weekend ill seed till i leave, but seedings up to you, Im not taking any chances."

,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-12-27T23:44Z,"@Elite117
If you have to ask if your xbox is jtagged or not; it is not and don't bother downloading.  Thanks."
,KingKool,2011-11-28T23:29Z,"C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."
