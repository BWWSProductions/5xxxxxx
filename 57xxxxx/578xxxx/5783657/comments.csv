But thanks to the uploader anyways."

Video - 7
Cinematography - 5

I would only recommend this if you have nothing better to do.
As stated prior, it's a low budget film and in an attempt to amp it up they used way too many tricks from film school leaving the viewer with a feeling of field of vision zoomed way in.
Plot is decent though, Smiths get better towards the end."
,bodierock,2010-08-25T13:29Z,cinematography probably isnt the word. I had three epeleptics fits during this movie and Im just the camera man. Could have been a good movie if somebody else made it . WASTE

,Kristo-,2010-08-26T16:31Z,"Acting sucked, plot sucked, directing sucked.. Well, basically everything sucked in this movie.

Don't waste your time."
