Venetian Snares : My So-Called Life
Venetian Snares introduces his new Time Signal label with a brand new album of elaborately twisted beat offs. They're intended as a sort of diary entry, or short stories, built and completed within a few days to give concise snapshots of his moods via the medium of f*cking mental breakcore. To be totally fair, they're still Venetian Snares tracks and hit like a pickaxe to the temple, regardless of the background. 'Posers And Camera Phones' rinses baroque chiptune melodies and rapid fire, pitchshifting amens, while 'Cadaverous' takes it's title from a sample lifted outta The Wire (if we're not mistaken), and surrounds it with bouncy hardcore thrusts and jungle parries. 'Welfare Wednesday' goes on a happy hardcore mission with distorted ragga chat and 'Ultraviolent Junglist' wrenches out a hyper-synched breakbeats at cardiac arrest tempos. If you're feeling fit enough, have a go.
