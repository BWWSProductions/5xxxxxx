,Daemocles,2010-08-25T20:16Z,"Funny fact, there are people in this world who have so much free time on their hands that they sit around thinking about the sexual tendencies of actors."
,payton629,2010-08-25T22:03Z,apparently brooklynD sounds like your jealous that Simon stole your fantasy gay lover cause why else would anyone put that same stupid shit on every episode its really annoying plus dont worry about it im sure youll find another gay actor who is single to fantisize about
,torrentgrrl,2010-08-25T22:28Z,"Seriously, again ?  BrooklyD, have your keyboard checked. your cut and paste buttons seem to malfunction a few times a week.

Or try trolling on one of these series:

30 Rock, How I Met Your Mother, Desperate Housewives, Sex and the City, Spring Awakening,The New Adventures of Old Christine,
Grey's Anatomy

They all have gay actors acting straight and since that interests you so much I'm sure you'll have a blast figuring out who it is.

Or post at everying Ian McKellen has ever done.

and when you are done with all of those, mabye one person watching White Collar might care. (I think your chances are slime though)

Just stop boring us every single week. Thank you. Have a cookie and get a life."
,torrentgrrl,2010-08-25T22:32Z,Oh and... trust me being...on the recieving end of a gay coupling is NOTHING like being fucked like a woman.
,Serialo,2010-08-26T04:19Z,Brooklyn's just mad cause he's probably a fat mess who can't get anyone to fuck him
,wario_kong,2010-11-04T08:47Z,thanks!
,Swemd,2010-12-17T00:50Z,"Funny fact. People who make jokes about gay people, often do so because they are having problems with their own sexuality."
