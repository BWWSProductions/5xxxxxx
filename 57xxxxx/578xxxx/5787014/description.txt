Season 6, Episode 3: Descent

Stargate Command discovers a Goa'uld Ha'tak in Earth orbit. Exploring, they 

discover it is the ship where Anubis briefly imprisoned Thor. At some point, 

Anubis' forces set the self-destruct and abandoned the ship, but something has 

halted the destruction and brought the ship to Earth. Jacob/Selmak opens the 

computer core so the team may learn more. Then the ship begins to descend towards

Season 6, Episode 4: Frozen

A team associated with Stargate Command and posted in Antarctica makes an 

astounding discovery - a perfectly preserved, apparently human woman who has been 

frozen since the Antarctic Stargate was first deployed. Then they discover she is 

still alive, and work to revive her. But her revival costs the team: they and SG-1 

succumb to a deadly disease the woman apparently carries. She can save them but 

not herself. And the effort exhausts her; she may not be able to save everyone 

before the disease claims her life.
