,Tabbystar,2011-06-19T12:31Z,Thank you for this fantastic upload. The audio and video quality is very good (using Cyclone converter to watch on TV). I will seed to completion - as usual! It's uploaders like this that make the Pirate Bay such a brilliant place. 
,Tabbystar,2011-06-19T12:33Z,Just another thing. If people are moaning about the quality (which is perfectly good and I am watching it on the big screen!) then go buy the DVD box set!!!!!

,Edwardthc,2011-12-11T02:46Z,People really need to fucking seed. I know its a large set of files but honestly it should not be taking me this long to download it.  I will post another comment after I am done downloading it to let you know what i thought.
,Miqunator,2011-12-21T12:42Z,"MPC says resolution is 624 x 352. About normal TV quality, nothing HD about it

Still watchable though"
