thanx"
,azrash,2010-08-27T14:52Z,"@Parizaat

sorry, i tried googling it, but nothing showed up, try ask your friend for the korean name of the movie.

Regarding to size, it depends on codec, for x264/h265, around 600mb would be decent, but for xViD, around 1.5gb. but again, it depends on the settings used by the encoders!

Cheers!"
