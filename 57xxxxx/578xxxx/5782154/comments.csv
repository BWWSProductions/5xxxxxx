,pri_246302rocks,2010-08-23T15:44Z,Very Good Rip !! Thankss twentyforty... Can u please help me choose subtitles for your rips..???
[V],twentyforty,2010-08-26T20:36Z,"@pri_246302rocks: I usually include subs if they exist. Unfortunately, totally new movies need week or two to get subtitles on few languages and months to get translated on some. 

I suggest you to install free Mediainfo and with right-click get FPS number. Then Google  subtitle and you'll get links to few sites that have subtitles. If anyone already have translation you need, you'll find out.
Choose subtitle according to FPS (frames per second) you already got - and for appropriate rip - DVD or Bluray. Almost all subs for BluRay usually fit 'cause all my rips are 1 file in one piece, and not split in 2, 3 or more CD sizes (as most of DVDrips are)."
