Plot

A music video has already been shot with Williams. B.o.B shot his scenes for the video in April, but Williams was only able to shoot her parts after the end of Paramore\'s spring tour, so they were never in the same room during filming. The music video, directed by Hiro Murai, premiered on iTunes on Tuesday June 15, 2010. The video features several frames of B.o.B rapping his verses in a party setting, on stage, and room filled with lights and occasional song lyrics while Hayley Williams sings the hook in a light filled room and walking through photographs. Jim Jonsin makes a cameo appearance.



Lyrics

[Chorus: Hayley Williams (B.o.B)]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now
Wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now
Wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Ya, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
\'Cause after all the partyin\' and smashin\' and crashin\'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin\' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin\' but them people never call you back
But that\'s just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I\'m late
I\'m on my way so don\'t close that gate
If I don\'t make that then I\'ll switch my flight
And I\'ll be right back at it by the end of the night

[Chorus: Hayley Williams (B.o.B)]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now)
Wish right now (Wish right now)
Wish right now (Wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting Stars)
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now)
Wish right now (Wish right now)
Wish right now (Wish right now)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Ya, ya, somebody take me back to the days
Befo\' this was a job, befo\' I got paid
Befo\' it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Ya, back when I was tryin\' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin\' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin\' to stay relevant
I\'m guessin\' that if we can make some wishes outta\' airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I\'ll go back to the days
Befo\' the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain\'t nobody listen to my mixtape
And back befo\' I tried to cover up my slang
But this is fo\' the hater, what\'s up Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish
To end the politics
And get back to the music
That started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I\'m hopin\' we can make some wishes outta\' airplanes

[Chorus: Hayley Williams (B.o.B)]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting Stars)
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now)
Wish right now (Wish right now)
Wish right now (Wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting Stars)
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now)
Wish right now (Wish right now)
Wish right now (Wish right now)

[Outro: B.o.B]
I could really use a wish right now
(I could really use a wish right now)
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
(I could really use a wish right now)
Like, like, like shootin\' stars
(Like shootin\' stars)
I-I-I-I could really use a wish right now
(I could really use a wish right now)
A wish, a wish right now
(A wish right now)
