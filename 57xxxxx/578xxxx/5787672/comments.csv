,Flying_Karapet,2010-11-23T03:06Z,great Torrent works windows 7 64 bit but might be a little time consuming for some people who have not used ISO or tormented cracked stuff just a bit difficult for the beginner 
,mvhupsel,2011-01-22T00:41Z,"Pretty good torrent! Good Set! seeding right now!
PLEASE PEOPLE, SEEEEEED! this is such a great file so plz SEED!"
,ramu50,2011-01-23T12:11Z,is this the english version? if yes i will help seed.
,Espeo7002,2011-01-29T21:00Z,"This torrent is amazing (though it is missing a bunch of the new voices and deserves an update)
In order to get the program in English you have to activate Prima before the rest of them (VOCALOID 1 (Kaito-Miriam on this list) is already in English no matter who you install in what order).

Amazing torrent is amazing."
,Onewinged22,2011-02-17T13:42Z,Could some1 make a guide on how to install this? :3

,Taigazz,2011-07-25T04:23Z,wow the vocaloid editor is really hard to use
,Hikari-Club,2011-08-08T18:29Z,"Can you, if you could, add Hiyama Kiyoteru's and Yuki Kaai's voicebanks?
That would be great help!

Anyway, thanks for this!"

,Tolomer,2011-08-23T14:36Z,"""Cannot read VOCALOID.exe"" when I run the crack...something I'm doing wrong help???"
,Tolomer,2011-08-23T14:38Z,"*Er, well when I run ""patch.exe"" specifically at least"
,Vynuxys,2011-08-25T16:16Z,"Alright.. I installed everything. Vocaloid didn't want to launch at all, Vocaloid 2 launched but I couldn't get anything to work properly since it was the JP version, apparently. I did launch the readme from the Vocaloid Registry, but it gave me an error. I'm in the middle of uinstalling everything, will retry.

Are we meant to click 'yes' when it prompts us to activate after each install? o3o; I pressed no every single time. If yes, what are we meant to put in?"
,agathor35,2011-10-23T18:56Z,"i had the same problem when i tryed the patch :c
it said ""Couldent Read VOCALOID.exe"" and that was it i thought of putting it in the same folder that it was installed to. but it said the same ting help?"
,yukiyuki162,2011-11-20T22:01Z,"ok so this vocaloid 1 not 2 right??????

,Doinkers,2011-11-27T22:38Z,"I understand the ISO stuff, and I've installed a few of the voicebanks, but get stuck at how to get them activated. What do all of the .CS files do?"
,ladyelric,2011-12-09T13:59Z,"Great torrent!
But Megurine Luka isn't working )':"
,learia,2011-12-11T23:51Z,"okay so I only installed Miku as I only need that one, evrything is installed until i opened the registry helper, it doesn't allow me to set voive installed & make interface english. do i really need to install the whole 14gb?"
,MrMilf,2012-02-07T20:06Z,ok so can anyone help me with the whole download process i have prima and miku installed already but i can get the programs to upload the other voices in. if anyone has an idea on how to do this please help me out! :) This is an amazing torrent and i would love to be able to use it to its fullest.
,Draya777,2012-03-12T17:59Z,"so i dowloaded Vocaloid2 but after i installed all the voicebanks i wanted, the program said that ""vocaloid 2 has expired. please activate vocaloid 2."" i only had the program for a day. is there some way to avoid that?"
