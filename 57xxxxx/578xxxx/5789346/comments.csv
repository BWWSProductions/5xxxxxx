,fjsound,2011-02-07T17:38Z,"Hi everybody, can someone tell me how to get audio from the videos? I downloaded the videos and they look prerty good but I can't hear a darn thing, I'm running them with Nero 9. Any help will be greatly appreciated."
,fjsound,2011-02-07T18:28Z,"Never mind, I deleted the files in the Temp folder and restarted the computer and it seemed to solve the problem, now I can watch and listen, thanks for the videos, they're awesome, I'll be seeding them."
,fjsound,2011-02-08T03:04Z,"Just a reminder, if you plan to use Nero 9 to play the laptop videos you need the update version 9.4.44.0 installed in your system, otherwise stick with Quicktime or some other video player that plays .mov"

,DarkerSkies,2011-11-24T00:33Z,"If your seeding this torrent you need to take a serious look at yourself 100 kbps download speed on a 21 gb torrent is fucking useless.

Either sort out the upload speed or kill the Torrent!!   "
,Alenko76,2011-12-28T19:12Z,"Man, I saw all sorts of crap on youtube, but this is the culmination of a disaster. Laptop repair video? Mother of God, a total amateur, totally ignorant experts, who retarded parrot who repeats three times the same thing. These include the power to forget, and speaks without a microphone (although it captures the external) then man figures that did not put the handsets with a microphone and then again all repeats, Windows shuts down a long press on power, I do not want this made â€‹â€‹no broom in hand and are referred to specialists? Shame serious proportions. Horror."
,Cinebuff,2012-03-19T02:00Z,"Alenko-- I have not downloaded this yet, and if you say that this is not good then do you have any better options?"
,Cinebuff,2012-03-19T02:02Z,I tried to download it but there are no seeds-- can any seed this file please.
