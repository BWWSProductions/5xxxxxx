,jammeke,2010-08-23T05:21Z,something wrong with this torrent: no input file :-/
,Miksu66,2010-08-23T14:07Z,No input file specified. ????????
,Jan-Bertil,2010-08-23T22:06Z,"Works perfect! Thanx!!!

@ the 2 noobs above: if ya don't know what to do with a torrent, don't download it!"
,pumpernickel,2010-08-24T12:03Z,"@Jan-Bertil
In that case I am also a noob because I get the same error message from TBB (no input file specified).
However, no problem with any other torrent file."
,olenbrumm,2010-08-24T16:13Z,"thank you, works perfect :)"
,rolfag,2010-08-24T17:35Z,"Not everybody is an expert and I am certainly not, but I found this:

In PC 1 I have no Bit Torrent program installed. I use to download torrent files with this PC. When trying to download this torrent, I will get ""No input file..."". Normally this procedure works, but not with this torrent.
If I try to click on ""Magnet Link"" I will get a message about missing file associations.

In PC 2 I have Bit Torrents program Vuze installed. If I try to download the torrent, I will get the same message as in PC 1.
But if I use ""Magnet Link"" with IE8, it works and starts up Vuze and fixes the rest for download. In Firefox I had to tell which program I wanted to associate with. I choosed azureus.exe. (Azureus is the former name of present Vuze).

Hope that this will help some other ""noobs"" to succeed."
,atv_new,2010-08-24T21:43Z,"1) What a fXXXing shit!
Magnet link in Internet Explorer (!!, not Firefox) to µtorrent 2.xx; Download error after some minutes... Close µtorrent and start µtorrent 1.61. Then it works.

2) I don't understand: Some weeks ago my account was scratched, no possibility any more to login (username ""atv""). No reaction from admins of the Pirate Bay team! :-(, :-(
So I created a new account but I stay the same 1!"
,Lydbog_DK,2010-08-24T22:59Z,"It's available elsewhere on the net, kindly provided by a guy who doesn't use Vuze."
,gm2t10,2010-08-24T23:52Z,No problem with this link : http://fenopy.com/torrent/Garmin_City_Navigator_Europe_NT_2011_20_Map_ID_2266/NjEyNjIyOA==/download.torrent to download :-)
,Simon2672,2010-08-26T19:45Z,"thanks a bunch for making this release available !

,SillySod,2010-08-27T11:32Z,Could anyone please tell me how to unlock the maps? The Unlock generator seems to be two years old and doesn't contain (as far as I can see) this update.

,guffe2005,2010-09-25T08:53Z,Somebody have the  mapcode  for  opening  map in mapsource 
,nikasp1,2010-10-29T11:25Z,"I also get stuck on ""Please enter your product key"" when I try to install on Win7.

From the example it should be something like ""2ABCDEF3"", i.e. 8 characters long.

Help is much appreciated!"
,Seto89,2010-12-23T22:39Z,"To all who struggle with the ""Please enter your product key"" message during installation:

You're using the wrong setup file. Use the one in the IMG folder instead.

Install worked out fine for me, currently struggling with unlocking..."
,Seto89,2010-12-23T22:52Z,"Just to add to my previous comment: the key generator works perfectly.

At first when I put in the key it said ""Unauthenticated"" instead of ""Locked"" - this is because I had an older crack of my MapSource 6.16.2, but updating that with the one provided ""patched"" it and I got it to say ""Unlocked"" finally..."
