By the way File Size: 3.13 GB if you skip from download all the separate files. 
The EXTRAS movie is 532 MB.
Cheers."

,otnemem,2011-11-27T14:20Z,"Can't open this with handbrake or mkv2vob/rebox.net/MKVextract so I can't demux anything out of it or even reencode video/sound which is key since DTS isn't supported by my TV.

Don't know what you did, perhaps mastering it, but as I'm not watching this on my PC this one will meet the trash can."
