Cheers,

,timeisnow,2011-10-05T15:56Z,Note to whoever wants to download this - this doesn't go full screen. There are black borders below and on the top which completely ruins the experience. One would think the uploader would  be intelligent enough to mention the aspect ratio and general specs before someone wastes his bandwidth to download a 1.34 gb movie which can't be viewed full screen. If I'd know this I'd have downloaded the 1.59 gb version available. This is bullshit.
