Review Summary

A cinematic love letter to all the women who maintain their courage despite overwhelming odds, Jose Candido de Carvalho's inspirational drama follows a young girl from Mozambique as she sets out to realize her dream of becoming a doctor. Sophie knows that she has what it takes to study medicine, but when her professor proves less than honorable, it begins to look as if her unwillingness to compromise her values just cost her a coveted spot at the university. Well aware of the limited opportunities offered to women in her country, the determined girl refuses to bend to the corruption and misogynist attitudes that have caused weaker-willed women to buckle under the pressure. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide
