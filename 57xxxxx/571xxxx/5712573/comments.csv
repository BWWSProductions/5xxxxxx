,MovieMoney,2010-08-01T15:53Z,"You folks at Kingdom Release are without a doubt the best there is!!  Awesome release as usual!!  If at all possible, my wife has been asking me for Fool's Gold BluRay with Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson and Donald Sutherland.  I've looked for other downloads , not many to choose from, but they are all too large for my PS3 to use.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!!  Thanks Again!!"
