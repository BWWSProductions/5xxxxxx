,ThievingBastard,2010-07-26T08:58Z,"I hate this series...

Well, not just this series. It just that Marvel milks another great character dry. Deadpool was a great character. Now he's everywhere and a fool..."

For the dude that says he hates this series... I'm sure theres some Archie or Betty and Veronica on this site that will be more to your taste."
,The_Wx13,2011-02-03T16:54Z,"Marvel may be ""milking"" Deadpool, but its also giving Deadpool a lot of exposure. Hes a great character that has a lot of potential for anything and everything. Deadpool will ALWAYS be a win."
,Philonetic,2011-06-09T10:07Z,"The point of Deadpool is to be a fool, he's the only character that knows the what the Marvel Universe is, that it's all fake, that he's just a character.  That's why he always refers to everything as a joke.  Play Marvel Alliance 2, same reason when you die with him he says ""wrong button""."
