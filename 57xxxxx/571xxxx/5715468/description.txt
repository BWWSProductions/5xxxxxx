About this game:
Death, Jr., Pandora and all their twisted friends are back and in their first misadventure on the Wii platform, trying to get out of another mess after accidentally releasing a powerful spirit. Teaming up for even more firepower, DJ and Pandora will take on a variety of possessed enemies as they progress through an adventure that seamlessly blends smooth platforming, intense combat, complex enemy AI and a unique sense of humor. Using the Wii remote and nunchuk, gamers can perform dual-weapon attacks of both the melee and projectile variety, and dispose of some 45 different enemies.
