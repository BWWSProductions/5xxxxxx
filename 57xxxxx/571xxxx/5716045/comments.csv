,doomboom,2010-07-26T01:48Z,"I highly doubt this is cracked. doesn't matter anyways, can people not wait 1 more day for release?"
,seolinker,2010-07-26T02:50Z,At last!!!!
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-26T03:37Z,"i'm guessing this is real, i imagine someone working at best buy or something. but this is the kind of game your going to want to own. blizzard is the best at keeping the pirates down... and i bow to them"
,saeid64,2010-07-26T04:43Z,"I dont know, but the files in iso are the same as the digital version.

,gingerjim,2010-07-26T06:37Z,"I just got my collectors edition today and Blizzard won't let you even install the game until 7/27. It uses an online authentication system and they block installs.

So even if this is real, you're SOL until then and even then you'll need a crack to bypass their system. So don't waste your time."
,migoz1,2010-07-26T06:40Z,this is not installing too? should not download this?
,Dimmis80,2010-07-26T08:48Z,From  the picture @saeid64 show us we can see that there are the same files like the digital download.So is the same thing.And it seems like that its like Clone DVD with no crack.!?And my opinion u cant install this like the digital without the crack.I have a bad feeling that it will take longer to crack.It seems very difficult.We will see..
,logical2,2010-07-26T09:04Z,"If you have got the CE, please rip the Behind the scenes DVD and upload it"
,antomic,2010-07-26T09:04Z,"please tell me this one will actually install... if not, I just spent all day downloading it for nothing... I will let you guys know if it works. if not, than to whomever uploaded this torrent.... thanks for wasting my bandwidth, you fucking cuntshit..."
,Teirs,2010-07-26T09:17Z,Just wait he may not have wasted your time wait till tuesday 24 more hours. But who knows. I know as soon as I get the cash I will purchase the game because I love starcraft. 
,antomic,2010-07-26T09:48Z,"This is a complete waste though... I am going to buy a copy too because I love starcraft... but I thought that since this was a retail version and not a digital download, it would actually work... he fails to mention whether it works or not, thus wasting mine and everyone else's time. one could just download the digital copy intstead, so once again, thanks for nothing."
,chrisssj2,2010-07-26T16:30Z,Hoping for a crack soon! Downloading this now.
,saeid64,2010-07-26T17:19Z,"i think i was wrong, this isn't the same version as digital version. sorry guys."
,Teirs,2010-07-26T22:59Z,"seed  peer   . c o . m

,hededede,2010-07-26T23:01Z,wait for the crack of course. this game has so many fans. it means it ll be cracked soon.
,seolinker,2010-07-26T23:09Z,"I have installed it already, servers open in Ukraine, but where is the crack ??? COME ON!!!!"
,iPlay.Metallica,2010-07-26T23:33Z,Whats the difference between this and the digital Download one ? cuz i alrdy started downloading the digital one ( from here as a torrent ) plzz tell me 
,Shraria,2010-07-26T23:51Z,"This is the version you will get when you first install the game. This is for people who want to play the game as soon as they get the key. There is NO crack here. It's actually legal to, Blizzard has the option to download this same version from their downloader if you log into battle.net

Stop complaining about it not being cracked, and no, it doesn't have viruses."
,Cybercharger,2010-07-26T23:52Z,iPlay.Metallica: Probably nothing. Neither works yet.
,chrisssj2,2010-07-27T00:09Z,Seolinker how can u have it installed already? It says u can't install untill 27th.. how?
,mongonisse23,2010-07-27T01:20Z,"The game is playable without key: Install the game, start the map editor, load a map, click the ""test document""-button, and SC2 loads and you get to play the map with fully working AI."
,iPlay.Metallica,2010-07-27T01:33Z,So is this better than digital download ? and is it real ? 
,TAKU0730,2010-07-27T03:43Z,you still dont understand or what ? retail box and digital copy are the same. the only thing you pay for is the key which costs fucking 70$ here

,chrisssj2,2010-07-27T13:14Z,"How come the crack doesn't work?
I looked in my battle.net folder but it doesn't have Battle.net-patch.mpq it has Battle.net.mpq.

I tried renaming it and replacing it. 

And I replaced the sc2.exe like said in the versions folder.

Then I start the client up and it starts updating..

Then when I start Starcraft 2 trough desktop it says an error has occured..

What did I do wrong? Thanks.."
,Nemam,2010-07-27T13:31Z,"Its work fine but in crack readme is faild 
1)the Battle.net-patch.MPQ should go to the StarCraft II\Battle.net\ dont replace old one just add this 

2)the SC2.exe should go to the StarCraft II\Versions\Base15405 and replace the existed one

3)start game and if its ok you shoudl see the main b.net screen not the login screen and DOWN LEFT the Orange Button Start Campaign shoudl work! (not the single player up left)

If you folow this it must work!!!"
,Nemam,2010-07-27T13:32Z,Btw if you apply crack before first update game should never work....
,chrisssj2,2010-07-27T13:56Z,"Nemam I tried adding Battle.net-patch.mpq to the battle.net folder without replacing any.

Then I replaced the sc2.exe in Base15405.

But when I start the game through the shortcut on my desktop it gives me the error: 
An error occured starting Starcraft 2. Please Try again.

Btw I freshed installed the game without starting the game through launcher so i did not get any update.

Do you need to be 100% offline when installing/playing this game?

I also saw a serial floating around here on piratebay, whats that for? I never was asked to input any kind of serial, only activation which leads to a website."

,waldo42,2010-07-27T21:02Z,"@chrisssj2

if you haven't already figured it out, here's a tip:

revert to that fresh install, and before you try to launch the game make sure you have anything like PeerBlock disabled.  The patcher will think the game is up to date if it can't accept incoming connections :(

For that matter, I haven't even successfully launched the game without disabling my Kaspersky as well.  I'll work on tweaking that for myself, but the main thing here is that you won't get very far with this if there are any limitations on your network traffic."
,Sidek22,2010-07-27T21:03Z,Does skirmish work??
,waldo42,2010-07-27T21:41Z,"quick update to my previous comment, Kaspersky was just setting it to ""blocked"" without even asking me, probably for lack of digital signature.  i changed that manually and am now running it with kaspersky ENABLED and peerblock ENABLED...

didn't want anyone getting the wrong idea ;)"
,iPlay.Metallica,2010-07-27T22:11Z,Can u play sikirmish vs ai ?
,adagoduha6,2010-07-28T01:25Z,"I was able to run the game,but when i click on ""Start Campaign""i see this""Your StarCraft 2 account doesnt have access to the single player features"" !!!! ????"

2. Working campaign crack:
