The higher you set your upload speed,the higher your download speed will be.Very simple."
,-Cortex-,2010-07-24T19:06Z,"@lilars26 That is complete and utter bollocks. If you are maxing out your upload while torrenting, you will not be able to max out your downstream. It's best to set it between half and 80% of it's max speed. If you don't believe me look at the FAQ on almost every torrent site, you'll see the same thing. 

If I upload at 45kb/s - my maximum- I can't download over 60kb/s, but if I set it to 20kbps I can achieve 850kb/s downstream (my maximum)."
,lilars26,2010-07-24T21:13Z,I was trying to keep it simple.Some people will set their upload speed at the very minumum and ask why their download speed is so slow.If your upload speed is less than 60kb/s please do not download torrent until there are at least 4 stable seeders.New torrent programs need more upload bandwidth for performing inter-clients synchronization where you MUST have 60kB/s UL speed for every 1000kB/s DL speed.If a 1:1 ratio cannot be attained then you will slow down the time it takes to finish initial seeding.After a new torrent is well seeded you can put your settings wherever they work best for you.But PLEASE seed for the next guy.
