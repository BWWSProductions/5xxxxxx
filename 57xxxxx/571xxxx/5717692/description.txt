Plot: As the devoutly single Don Johnston is dumped by his latest girlfriend, he receives an anonymous pink letter informing him that he has a son who  may be looking for him. The situation causes Don to examine his relationships with women instead of moving on to the next one, and he embarks on a  cross-country search for his old flames who might possess clues to the mystery at hand.
