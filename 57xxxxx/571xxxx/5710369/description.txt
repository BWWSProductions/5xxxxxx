Alexi Murdoch's intimate, wintry songwriting dominates this soundtrack, which takes the bulk of its tracks from his breakthrough album, TIME WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. Bob Dylan, George Harrison, the Stranglers, and the Velvet Underground are all awarded one song each, but the emphasis rarely strays from Murdoch's fingerpicked guitar and solemn vocals, resulting in a consistent vibe that almost functions like a movie score. While the songwriter also contributes three unreleased songs to the project, AWAY WE GO might be too reminiscent of his existing albums to appeal anew to most Murdoch fans. Instead, this album caters to those who enjoyed the movie, as it offers up the same brand of wistful contemplation
