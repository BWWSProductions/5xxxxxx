             DCS: Black Shark offers an innovative combat simulation     
             experience that is sure to challenge the hard-core flight   
             enthusiast. There is also an easy-to-play arcade mode       
             that can be enjoyed by any beginner. Employing              
             military-qualified technology, it's an unprecedented        
             level of realism, flight dynamics, instruments modelling,   
             avionics systems, and weapons systems like you've never     
             seen before.

             Asian border region serves as your battlefield and          
             includes a broad array of eastern and western air, land     
             and sea units. Each unit is accurately reproduced to        
             include detailed models, weapons systems, movement          
             dynamics and artificial intelligence. Add to this a         
             state-of-the art campaign system which allows the front     
             line of the battlefield to move back and forth according    
             to your mission success or failure. Each bullet, rocket,    
             shell or bomb fired is modelled in the most precise detail  
             for an unimaginably visceral gaming experience.             
                                                                         
             The new Mission Editor includes a powerful electronic       
             mapping system that allows you to easily create missions    
             and campaigns, and nonlinear campaigns are also included    
             for unlimited replay ability. Multiplayer mode supports up
