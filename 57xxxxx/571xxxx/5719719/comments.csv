,atreyyu,2010-07-27T21:51Z,"This realease doesn't work. Thanks to my firewall I realize that when you try to install the game, the installer wants to connect to ""eu.battle.net"", after that it closes silently. probably Blizzard has blocked this realease to install."
,TonyS1,2010-07-27T22:00Z,"ok this took me 5 fucking tries but got it... 1st I'm using an EnGB version (the collectors ED)
install it, then it updates auto. It needs to update again as well, if it doesn't do this... close the launcher and relaunch from the desktop shortcut (only use this to launch the game) if it still doesn't update, restart your pc and relaunch again. Once it's updated RUN THE GAME 1st WITH NO CRACKS APPLIED... then close it, apply the cracks and start from ""Start Campaign"" also the tutorials work... any other combination and this will fuck-up. Trust me I have been going at it for hours. BTW I have launched and relaunched the game and played briefly 4 times to verify
GOD DAMMIT what a hassle but thanx to the cracker, this is legit folks, just a pain in the ass is all :) and BTW, I'm using Win7 x64"

They should nuke this. NOT working for x64 Windows 7,."
,ciccasianrds,2010-07-27T22:49Z,but the game in single player doesnt save you must have an account on battle net and it cost you 60 euro this fucking blizzard 
,rozole,2010-07-27T22:55Z,"@ciccasianrds

I did what you said. I still get this message though:   No installer data could be found. If this problem persists, please contact Blizzard Technical Support.

Looking for a decent guide with steps on how to do everything! Is it too much to ask?"
,atreyyu,2010-07-27T22:58Z,"yeap, as ciccasianrds says, you have to make a folder on your hard drive and copy there the entire content of the dvd image file, next you should place in the root of that directory both cracked files. Only after that the installer will work. It should have been explained in the nfo file. Do not attempt to install from the disc (virtual drive), it will not work. "
,masterfaster2,2010-07-27T22:58Z,"It is already nuked, but not because is not working, but because it is stolen from p2p (stolen crack)."

I just followed little guide that 'TonyS1' wrote up in comments to this .torrent, Check for it, follow it, and ull be right on track with Jimmie Raynor. Trust me, it works, tho its a little messed up at first look. Why ""almost"" perfect - well, its cause of message repeatedly appearing in-game, while loading screen is on ""Your single campaign registration is not complete, bla bla go and buy, until that your Single Player will be not fully available"" So far i did noticed only achievements system isnt working. Good luck guys"

,Goldberger,2010-07-28T03:03Z,Ok ppl who complain that installing does not work even when you copy disc to HD.. I had same problems but for me it was that there was hidden file and i had not changed on settings that show hidden files. After i changed to show hidden files i copied again and now install works. Hope this helps for atleast some :)
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-28T03:04Z,saves 4 me.
,kumakun2719,2010-07-28T03:09Z,"It took me half a day to download this and to get it installed but it finally worked on my win 7 64bit so now I will explain how to install it without going through messages.  

This is a complete tutorial for install:
#1) Download this torrent file and r27 
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5719797/Starcraft_2_Wings_of_Liberty_r27_FIX_-LiBERTY
#2) Before extracting the iso file, copy the ""lty-sc2ret"" from the r27 into the ""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY"" folder and then extract the iso out 
#3) Using an iso reader software(I used alcohol 120%) and copy the files inside out to another folder
#4) Run the install 
#5) Let Blizzard patch and update 
#6) Copy the ""Battle.net-patch.MPQ"" into the ""Battle.net"" folder 
#7) Copy the ""SC2.exe"" into the Versions->Base15405 folder
#8) Run ONLY the StarCraft II.exe file in the Starcraft folder, not the SC2.exe
#9) If you have an error saying ""Error opening Starcraft 2"", or it stops at 70% update, or asking you to pay for full purchase, go to Support-> Repair and after the fix re-do step 6-8.

This took me 3 times of testing to get it working.  
Note 1:On the home page when you click Single Player it SHOULD say you need to pay, just click campaign on the home screen and it should ignore that error and run.  

Note 2: You cannot save, however, if you auto-save you can load from the auto-save file in the  campaigns folder. (Not sure how exactly yet).

Thanks for the upload, enjoy!"
,lolocar,2010-07-28T03:17Z,How can you save?  I got it working but all is lost if I cant save someone reply?
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-28T03:33Z,go to    C:\Documents and Settings\Jayzen Freeze\My Documents\StarCraft II\Saves   then doubble click    LibertyCampaignSave  file the game auto saves nothing else so finish 1st level go where i said doubble click the save game file and save game loads if you click on the starcraft exe file it starts over each time.   your welcome

###VERY IMPORTANT### about the steps in how to install:

On the step number #2, DO NOT COPY all the content, just and JUST ""lty-sc2ret"".

I?ve just copied the FILE: lty-sc2ret and the other one ""Ity-sc2c"" and i got several errors and the installation wont work.

For people who have done like i did ... rename the Folder to: ""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LIBERTY - 2"" .... then eliminate the utorrent, come to this page, and ""download this torrent, choose OPEN, untick all files unless the ""Ity-sc2c"" .. in less than 20 seconds you download that. Than, put that file in the the previuos folder aka ""Starcraft.......LIBERTY 2""  and continue the STEPS!!!

follow these steps (I use bitcomet, might be different for you)
1. rename the file ""Installer Tome 1.MPQE"" to ""Installer Tome 1.Mpqe.bc!""
2. download this torrent but choose download later ""SC2-WingsOfLiberty-enGB-Installer""
3. move the renamed file to source destination of new download, overwrite
4. the download will hash check and install the missing 20MB from the file

I got the fix, extracted the iso, copied the files and ran the installer.  The installed complains about not having inet connectivity.  There is a button that allows me to ignore this for the install and load a web page that gives me a code to dump in so the install will run.  

Once the game is installed it starts with a box saying ""starcraftII requires a patch"" and when I select ""ok"" to install the patch it thinks for a few seconds and then repops the same message again.  I brought up wireshark and tried it again and it doesn't look like it's even trying to get out to the inet.  I've disabled my firewall, but if wireshark doesn't even see it leaving that shouldn't be the problem and it didn't solve anything.  

If I look in the /install/logs directory there is a log saying ""Cannot load the page 'http://eu.launcher.battle.net/patchnotes/?locale=en-GB'"" which I can load in the browser manually and ""Failed to retrieve version information from Battle.net."" 

When I try to run the repair tool it says it can't get the list of information from bliz web site. WIth wireshark running on all of this I still don't see the installer, launcher, or repair tool even trying to get out...

REPLACE ""lty-sc2ret.r27"" IN THIS TORRENT WITH THE ONE FROM THIS --> https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5719797/Starcraft_2_Wings_of_Liberty_r27_FIX_-LiBERTY


MOUNT IMAGE

ENABLE HIDDEN FILES

COPY ALL THE FILES TO A DIRECTORY ON YOUR COMPUTER

RUN INSTALLER


if you only see 3 files inside the ""mounted imaged"", ENABLE ""show hidden files"" from folder options ... then you see and can copy all the content to a created folder in the desktop and proceed...

@3 - Dont know if skirmysh works... some say yes but im certain it?s not, or at least i can?t ;/ (if someone knows how to.. explain please)

@4 - Save game: Yes, go to my documents, open starcraf 2 folder and you see 1 File and 1 Folder, the file is the last auto-saved but in the folder are all AUTO-SAVES from the very biginning... so you can, in some way, quit the game with one or more ""auto-save"" during the midle of a mission. "

- No zerg play in the campaign

First, excuse my English because English is not my first language! Thank you.
Second, make sure your StarCraft 2 is ""Complete"" not some crap like ""Digital Download"" or something like that!

So here very very simple steps from me, IT IS YOUR OVERCLOCK! yes! overclock!

1. Go to your BIOS setup
2. load default setup to reset every OC values in your BIOS, especially MEMORY [Ram] must reset to default settings!
3. Save and Exit
4. Wait until your Windows boost up
5. Run StarCraft 2 Installer again and Vivo la!!!!! ITS INSTALLER NOW WORK LIKE CHARM!!!! YEAHHHHH!!!

for some reason, Bilzzard Installer are crap or something because its can't catch up my CPU and RAM overclocked so its failure to installation...

NOTE 1: this tips work for peoples who loved to overclock your PC by pushing hard CPU and RAM! so you need to reset them to default values first. When your installation is completed, just back to BIOS and set your OC again to maximize your performance of PC!
NOTE 2: for peoples who didn't OC, just try my tips to see if this work for you :) try to reset your RAM timing and clock would helps you
Enjoy!"

The thing is, I can start the Editor without any problems.

this is what i did

1.Crack this SC2-Liberty using Reloaded's Crack

2.Then Crack it using Razor 1911's Crack
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5730029/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper-Razor1911-CrackOnly

and this is what i did for the MAPS

a folder inside

C:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\Battle.net\Cache
or just directly inside the
C:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\Battle.net\Cache folder?

If in case it was the inside another folder, what was the name of the folder containing it?[/quote]
Inside of the folder chache you will see a bunch of folders

00
0a
0b
...
etc

at this point u have to use the search system, look for the extension *.s2ma in the chache folder to find them, the maps will have names like:

0e639dfeb6bbe18f5a859b5059dd6e296a7a19d1c902f538c250545fc7dd5658.s2ma
or
1f720f0a950a29e6a77bddd4d3e4986faef7c6773066f61e9e4688242ec2538a.s2ma

Copy all the maps to a folder in your desktop, then u can rename it from *.s2ma to *.sc2map

the best method i found was using a batch renaming
you can do this opening the notepad and writing this parameters

rename *.s2ma *.sc2map

and save it as .bat
example: SC2Maprename.bat

then put the .bat file in to the folder where u put all the maps and execute it
so now you have all the maps whit extension *.sc2map :D
and now u have to open 1 by 1 with the editor map and look for the name of the map and change it
to see the name of each map in the editor go to

Map --> Mapinfo


in the ""info"" tab u have to change the ""Locale"" from enGB to enUS to see the name of the map (in enGB dont show it i dont know why, in enUS and the rest of the countrys it showed)


Well i hope this will helped you"

1) Download this torrent file, and the missing .r27?file from
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5719797/Starcraft_2_Wings_of_Liberty_r27_FIX_-LiBERTY
2) Before extracting, copy 'lty-sc2ret.r27' from the r27 folder into the 'Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY' folder.
3)Extract the .iso using a program such as 7-Zip.
4) Mount the .iso file that was extracted, using a program such as Daemon Tools or Alcohol %120.
5) Show hidden files (to do this in Vista, open up any Windows folder and at the top of it click Tools->Folder Options->View then select 'Show hidden files and folders')
6) Copy all the contents of the .iso to your hard drive.
7) Run the installer.
8) Let Blizzard patch and update. Click 'Skip' registration. After Do not click 'Play' yet.
9) Copy the ""Battle.net-patch.MPQ"" into the ""Battle.net"" folder?
10) Copy the ""SC2.exe"" into the Versions->Base15405 folder
11) Run ONLY the StarCraft II.exe file in the Starcraft folder, not the SC2.exe
12) If you have an error saying ""Error opening Starcraft 2"", or it stops at 70% update, or asking you to pay for full purchase, go to Support-> Repair and after the fix re-do step 6-8.
13) On the home page when you click Single Player it SHOULD say you need to pay, just click campaign on the home screen and it should ignore that error and run.?

If it doesn't work then try re-installing and then using RELOADED's crack, available here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5723363

For those having trouble (if you can get to the blizzard login screen), you might need to re-apply the reloaded crack again. I had to do it twice (and I received an error when updating the second time), but after the second time I no longer received a Blizzard login screen.

Campaign is awesome!!"
,qwerty17,2010-08-03T08:08Z,"@bk12321

As what I've read in your comment
you said that there are no blizzard login 
screen so it means you can't play Skirmish if you're using reloaded's crack
(because there are no maps showing in
the contents) ..


If you want to crack it 100% you need to reinstall it again then update it itself until the button play is ready then close SC2
then crack it using Razor 1911's crack.

Note:
if keytro does not working use sandboxie
and then choose run outside sandboxie
and also keytro is being detected as 
a false/positive virus you need to disable 
you're Anti-Virus then Press F2."

,word304,2010-08-03T11:54Z,"@Deadword420 - One thing you can try that might work (assuming u are using r27 fix and that ur connection isn't blocked by firewall or spyware program):

If you've been installing directly thru a program with the iso file mounted, then do a local folder install instead. (Make sure hidden files are shown when you do). If u have been installing thru local folder, then try it directly through the mounted iso. For some users it only works one of those two methods.
Also make sure you are doing the online patch first then applying the crack - otherwise it locks up when updating. 

If you still can't get it to work - you might try the RELOADED crack since it has an update.bat file as a patch instead of the online auto-updater. However since I didn't actually use it myself, I can't definitely confirm if it works or not."

3.  Do not use the liberty crack, instead download this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5736090/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper_CRACK_ONLY-Razor1911

4.Run Razor1911SC2_COPY.exe

5. Run keytro.exe IM:  if keytro stops responding, go to notepad and type : ""start keytro.exe"" (without the quotes) and save it as a .bat file IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE KEYTRO PROGRAM.

6.  Run the .bat file you saved.

7.  It will go through this whole thing about how awesome razor1911 is and stuff.

I've downloaded this and the reloaded version, and managed to extract the .iso from both of them. However, when I try to mount the .iso using PowerISO, I always get an error message saying ""The file format is invalid or unsupported."" and if I try to open them using 7zip, it doesn't work.
I've forced Re-checks on both of them, and they passed, and I have no idea why I can't mount the .iso files. Help?"
,khaled_br,2010-08-05T23:37Z,"okay how i managed to do it
took me some time but i finally did it

well i tried to followed what kumakun2719 said on page 4 but was bit confused with certain things so im trying to explain more that what he did in these points
but again many thanks to him and all the others .. if not i wouldnt have been able to do this( alot of quoted from kumakun2719 but as i said i tried to explain things that are not very clear)

1) Download the torrent file and r27 rar fix from https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5719797/Starcraft_2_Wings_of_Liberty_r27_FIX_-LiBERTY
2) Before extracting the iso file, copy the 2 files \""lty-sc2ret\"" from the r27 into the \""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY\"" folder, they will replace the original files present in the file and then extract the iso out
3) Use Deamon light in order to mount the image and then copy the whole contents of the file into another folder you create on your computer
but the trick is that there are some hidden files and you have to select show all folders in order to be able to copy the contents of the cd to you hard disk
not doing this wont let the setup start, my God i did alot of reading so i could do this right
4) Install the game
5) Let Blizzard patch and update
6) Copy the \""Battle.net-patch.MPQ\"" into the \""Battle.net\"" folder located at C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II\Battle.net
7) Copy the \""SC2.exe\"" into the Versions->Base15405 folder located at C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II\Versions\Base15405
8) Run ONLY the StarCraft II.exe file in the Starcraft folder, not the SC2.exe ( on 1st launch unblock the game and the firewall)
9) If you have an error saying \""Error opening Starcraft 2\"", or it stops at 70% update, or asking you to pay for full purchase, go to Support-> Repair and after the fix re-do step 6-8.
10) Regarding to saving the game: if you do the last update it would fix that 
11)On the home page when you click Single Player it SHOULD say you need to pay, just click campaign on the home screen and it should ignore that error and run.


Enjoy"
,JohnnyCDS,2010-08-06T00:10Z,"Works fine with Razor crack.
I follow this:

1. Mount the game, and copy over the contents of the CD to you HD.

2. Install the game and let it patch, it should do this automatically.

3. Do not use the liberty crack, instead download this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5730029/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper-Razor1911-CrackOnly

4.Run Razor1911SC2_COPY.exe

5. Run keytro.exe IM: if keytro stops responding, go to notepad and type : \""start keytro.exe\"" (without the quotes) and save it as a .bat file IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE KEYTRO PROGRAM.

6. Run the .bat file you saved.

7. It will go through this whole thing about how awesome razor1911 is and stuff.

8. When prompted hit F2 once. The screen should flash very briefly.

9. Run the game.

10. Click the sign in as guest button and play!

Important!!

keytro.exe  not work with XP SP2, you need update to SP3

With Razor crack works Single player and skirmish.
Save games works too."

,MultaTuli,2010-08-06T11:19Z,"First of all, I want to thank everyone who\'s helping to solve all these problems many of us have. There are already many solutions posted for all kind of errors. 

There is though an unsolved problem some of us are having: What can you do if the installer prompts the message \""Please insert the DVD labeled Starcraft II disc\"" ?

I\'m using the \""StarCraft 2 Wings Of Liberty Digital Download-WW\"" download to run the installer.
With DaemonToolsLite I mount the ISO downloaded from \""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY\"", but still the installer is asking for a DVD.

(I\'ve also tried to run the installer from \""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY\"" but he\'s giving me the \""No installer data could be found\"" error.)

So my question is: How can you get rid of the \""Please insert the DVD\"" prompt?

Hidden files mate, check your folder options from control panel and above on the sub-menu VIEW, click on it and check a mark in ""show/enable hidden files, drives, folders"" or something like that. Than you shall see all the content and proceed!!



&trigsboy2, 

Research previuos pages, many instructions there. ((my opinion... follow everything unless liberty and reloaded crack, after installation and the updates from blizz, just install the razor crack and campaign and skirmish will be available.))



&singintree8,

Yeah some units from campaign are not available in skirmish. those units are extra and only available on singleplayer mode. Otherwise terrains would be powerfull. 

Wait for further expansions and maybe we shall see them on the next skirmishes :)


&Question2,

Just fucking download the razor crack, it will WORK!!! 



PS:  To be able to play sirmishes you need to open sc2 normally, press the menu where it says ""play versus ai"" and ((YOU NEED INTERNET in order to see the MAPS )) Quence just read the previuos pages next time and be smart. Until you tried everything dont bullshit around.

To my knowledge I have followed every step to install this but it still doesnt work.  Replaced the r27 file with the fixed one, got the iso out, mounted it, copied the files into a separate folder.

,ElCracko,2010-08-13T08:35Z,"After some tinkering I got it to install on mac. You need to go to windows and get it to ""show hidden files and folders"". Once you do that you need to remove the hidden property of the following files;

1) Installer Tome 1.MPQE
2) Installer UI 1.MPQ
3) Installer UI 2.MPQE

Just right-click each file in windows and select properties and in General remove the checkmark on hidden and hit apply. Take those 3 files and put them in folder along with the StarCraft II installer.app and put them in a USB drive or transfer them to the mac and install!! You can search for the mac version of the Razor crack and use little snitch to block SC from getting online! ENJOY!"

#2) Before extracting the iso file, copy the \""lty-sc2ret\"" from the r27 into the \""Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY\"" folder and then extract the iso out
#3) Open up the ISO with any ISO opener I USE Daemon Lite.
#4 ) SHOW ALL HIDDEN FILES IN THE DISK. TOME1 and TOME2 Are HIdeen and various other files
#5) COPY ENTIRE CD DRIVE TO HARDRIVE
#6) Run the install
#7) Let Blizzard patch and update
#8) Copy the \""Battle.net-patch.MPQ\"" into the \""Battle.net\"" folder
#9) Copy the \""SC2.exe\"" into the Versions->Base15405 folder
#10) Run ONLY the StarCraft II.exe file in the Starcraft folder, not the SC2.exe
#11) If you have an error saying \""Error opening Starcraft 2\"", or it stops at 70% update, or asking you to pay for full purchase, go to Support-> Repair and after the fix re-do step 6-8."

,ThistFix,2010-08-20T20:35Z,"This is  a fix for this torrent. Tested it on Windows 7 64 bit. Works.

Usually most guides are a bit confusing. So this is for all those lost souls running Windows 7 64- bit. Probably works on other operating systems.

Step 1 . Download  this torrent.
Step 2 . Mount the ISO , using Alcohol 120 , or Daemon tools. 
Step 3. Copy all the files to a folder onto your PC. Name the Folder Starcraft for now.
Step 4. Run the Installer. If the Installer.exe does not run. Go download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5725541/Starcraft_2_Digital_download-WW_installer_fix__2

Copy all these files to the folder you copied the Iso files too.

Step 5. Install the game. Ignore the Activation Window , skip it.

Step 6. Go find Starcraft II patch 1.0.3.
Install this patch.

Step 7. Go find the Starcraft 2 Reloaded crack- Only , about 100 MB or so. 

Step 8. Go find the Starcraft 2 Razor crack -Only , around 100 MB.

Step 9. Within the Razor crack , you will find two files , (sc2_copy.exe and sc2_copy dat file)
Copy those two to the folder you Installed Starcraft II.

Run sc2_copy.exe

Step 10. Next , within the Reloaded crack folder there is three files . Versions folder , Support folder and the Starcraft II.exe.

Copy these three to the folder you installed Starcraft II. Overwrite existing files.

Step 11. Run the Starcraft II.exe , and select one of three profiles razor provided. 



ps. This fixes the AI in skirmish , thanks to Razor. If you go to Single Player vs AI , at first it seems there is no maps. Give it a couple of seconds to load.

ps Forget the keytro supplied by Razor , unfortunately that does not work in this case.

Enjoy!"
,ThistFix,2010-08-20T20:59Z,"This is a fix for this torrent. 
Tested it on Windows 7 64-bit. Works.

Step 1. Download this torrent.

Step 2. Mount the Image , copy the files within the image to a folder onto your PC.

Step 3. Run the Installer.exe. If the Installer.exe will not run. Grab the Digital Download fix #2.
Copy the Fix #2 files to the folder you copied the Starcraft files to.


Step 4. Install the game. Ignore the activation windows. Skip it.

Step 5. Grab the Starcraft II 1.0.3 patch. Update the game. Game will run after this , just close.

Step 6. Grab the Starcraft II Reloaded crack -Only , around 100mb.

Step 7. Grab the Starcraft II Razor crack -Only, around 100mb.

Step 8. Within the Razor crack folder , copy the sc2_copy.exe and the sc2_copy.dat files to the Directory you installed Starcraft II.

Step 9. Run the sc2_copy.exe

Step 10. Within the Reloaded crack folder , copy the Versions folder , Support folder and Starcraft II.exe to the Directory you installed Starcraft II.
OverWrite existing files.

Step 11. Run Starcraft II .exe. Choose between the three profiles Razor1911 provided.

ps. This fixes the AI in Single Player. 
if it seems there is no maps , just give it time to load.

Enjoy.

 The (Play as Guest) allows you to play the game.

If you want to play Skirmish with AI , download SC2ALLin1 (custom Starcraft 2 launcher).
, and get a "".SC2"" map ex. fire.sc2map.

Copy the custom map you got , to the maps folder in your Starcraft 2 directory folder, and the Starcraft 2 folder under My Documents folder.

Run the launcher , import your map , enter amount of players and there you go."

I've tried everything possible, followed all instructions and still get errors left and right.  Am I the only one who can't play the game?  It won't even patch completely (but I assume that is meaningless because the patch is normally the cause of a fail).  And when I copy and use the crack, I get error ""this application failed to start because lcuuc44.dll was not found"".  Either Blizzard are genius' at anti-pirating software...  Now I am downloading another 7gb file that hopefully works. "

,SaoAlberto,2010-10-08T18:35Z,"Oh hey there kids, I see that some of you are having issues with playing this game. First off, I didn't need to replace the 27 file with the fix, but you guys can try it anyways. That aside, the reason that most people are having issues opening the game is that they are downloading the more recent patches. When I installed this onto my friend's computer, it worked when it only had the 2nd patch. The day after, a third patch came out and the game stopped working. Conclusion: Download only the very first patch. How to do? Simple: after you download the first patch, disconnect from the internet. It's okay if you only got 5% of the second one, as long as you don't download the whole thing. Also, use the Razor 1911 crack. It's pretty simple to use and if you need help, you can probably refer to the comment boards for that torrent. I hope my suggestions help and good luck with the game. Cheers!"
,Andrew1987,2010-10-18T10:30Z,"I simply extract the file from the image, like a rar file, and Install from there. Goodluck"
,Azraelalpha,2010-10-30T01:46Z,"Easy fix to this bitch:

Make hidden files visible on your computer. 

If you don't know how to do that, you should go jump off a cliff or at least not even bother downloading this torrent.

Great upload, by the way."
,Azraelalpha,2010-10-30T03:36Z,"@fates_eye:
This happened because you have applied the crack before updating the game. If you're smart and backup the original files before cracking, you should be able to restore those original files (the .mpq and the .exe files) and complete the update. Once it is completely updated, you should apply the crack."

2. After installing stop the game from updating.
3. Run SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch from the download.
