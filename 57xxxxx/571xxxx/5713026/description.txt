Music: Classical : MP3/Variable


This is the reference album! Total artistic commitment from Charles Dutoit and his inspired Montreal Symphony Orchestra served in digital sound in the extraordinary acoustics of St-Eustache Church, where it was recorded in 1986. This album has won the highest praise and continues to give me a special pleasure. Holst's portrait of the planets shines as bright as ever.

Enjoy and Seed!!
