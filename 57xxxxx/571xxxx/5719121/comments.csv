,trentmac12,2010-07-30T00:24Z,hey omegafox .. got a couple more for you that I'd really like to see .. Gridiron Gang and Young Blood .. See what you can do
,trentmac12,2010-07-30T00:29Z,hey omegafox .. I have a couple more movies I'd like to see .. Gridiron Gang and Young Blood ... See what you can do for me
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-30T04:56Z,hi omegafox84 there is a small error in Rush hour 2 man it says there is a eng sub but its not displaying after we selected and the qualitity of A/V is A+...
,omegafox84,2010-07-30T05:47Z,"@trentmac12: i can do Young Blood and possibly Gridiron Gang.

@GUYMOVIE: i checked it out and couldn't find any either. that's quite strange. subtitles do come up during some of the non-English parts however. also, there's closed captioning if nothing else. just curious, what nationality are you?"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-30T06:36Z,just curious...why r u asking it?
,omegafox84,2010-07-30T07:57Z,"no reason, i could just tell English isn't your primary language. you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. :)"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-30T08:37Z,it not like that....i'm an indian and the regional language is tamil
,omegafox84,2010-07-30T10:01Z,i've heard of Tamil. it's a very different language. please don't misunderstand though. i wasn't trying to insult your English. it's actually pretty good!
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-30T10:21Z,i don't know anything about my english cause no one commented so far...so i won't take it seriously and i'll try to improve mine.....so whats ur nationality by the way?
[T],ctang,2010-07-30T17:09Z,"guymovie: is this your language or not 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language"
[T],ctang,2010-07-31T17:42Z,"@guymovie:  nobody has commented on your english because it is as good as almost everyone who speaks english...what im trying to say is that when english speakers are on forums such as tpb, their english formality goes way down and your english is as good as somebody who falls into this category or actually maybe even better...in my opinion i think that is why english speakers like myself havent commented on your english"

[T],ctang,2010-08-01T04:46Z,@omegafox:  i added your username and link to my description on my 2 most recent torrents :) hope you approve
,omegafox84,2010-08-01T05:46Z,@ctang: hell no! take it down! just joking. that's badass though. thanks. i'll be sure to add yours on my next upload. :)
[T],ctang,2010-08-02T03:09Z,sounds good
[T],ctang,2010-08-02T03:10Z,i just noticed that you have that your dvd-r's are region 0 (region free)...i think that i am going to start putting that bit of info on my future torrents...good idea
,omegafox84,2010-08-02T03:52Z,i bet you'd get more people downloading if you did.
[T],ctang,2010-08-02T16:25Z,i think so too
,simon_piggott_21,2010-08-02T17:24Z,whats the best dvd converter ppl use need to no asap thanks
[T],ctang,2010-08-19T02:13Z,"what do you mean by converter...you mean a dvd rip which takes a dvd and creates an avi movie file (among other formats) or do you mean a dvd copier

dvd copier try dvdfab for windows or mactheripper or ripit for mac

dvd ripper try dvdfab for windows or handbrake for mac

hope that helps"
