,cperry810,2010-07-24T00:39Z,fuckin yea man i been waitin for this shit for like a month thank you 
,SkiT1711,2010-07-24T03:56Z,"not 320kpbs and the quality of buried alive sounds bad. other than that, nice release, epic band. this made my day! "
,davidson221,2010-07-24T08:20Z,"you're right about that man, i uploaded it without checking all the tracks. i'll have another rip up soon."
,HungryTeddyBear,2010-07-24T16:28Z,"I think everyone should buy this album instead of downloading it. They are on the edge of break-up, they need the support and they need to know that their fans support them.
R.I.P Jimmy Sullivan"
,Alterdo,2010-07-24T23:24Z,"I agree to buy but why not preview too. Either way... i'm new to this, how do i seed?"
,freakinsweet24,2010-07-25T00:39Z,"I agree with HungryTeddyBear and Alterdo. Even though i downloaded this because i couldn't resist, i think everyone who likes the band should go out and buy it also instead of just downloading it. One of the only reasons why they even released this was for the fans, and i think that we should repay them by supporting them and buying the album on tuesday. RIP Jimmy. A7X for life!!!!"
,CellMate_BFF,2010-07-25T23:28Z,"I just spent 90 bucks on tickets to see them here in the next month, I think I can get a free CD."
,robhender30,2010-07-26T01:46Z,I agree as well that you should be buying this album to help out the band...I am downloading it to hear it than buying it when its released in 2 days...A7X!!!
,robhender30,2010-07-26T01:48Z,"Alterdo...To seed you just leave the file in your torrent downloader of choice when it has completed downloading...Instead of downloading, when it gets to 100% it will then say seeding"
,eber04,2010-07-27T21:35Z,"Don't buy the album to support the band. $14.00 of the $15.00 you spend goes to the store and the greedy record company executives. The money is then used to hire their male prostitutes, and lawyers to fight the internet. If you want to support the band download their music and then go see a concert or better yet, mail them $15.00."
,guitarguy109,2010-07-27T21:44Z,"Even though i fully plan on actually buying the CD, until I stop being broke, LISTENING to the CD beforehand isnt so bad right? lol is this a full RIP or did you compile tracks from mp3s you found scattered around on the internet?"
,Spider287,2010-07-29T21:25Z,"eber04, it sounds crazy but it's actually a good idea.

If someone could figure out a way to directly mail the band $15, I'd do it."
,skookie5,2010-07-30T01:58Z,"Really, 320? I believe one was 320, but most of them (ie basically all) were (very bad sounding) 128 kbps, and 1-2 were 256. This one is terrible, go download one of the other good, less seeded ones and get them more seeds than this one!"
,CaptainBaboon42,2010-07-31T18:27Z,"Shit quality 

This is the best one on TPB

,xhizorx,2010-08-10T18:46Z,wow 1500 seeds exactly lol
,dethspunj,2010-08-27T17:00Z,"think i'll just dl the album and not buy it, it might be shit for i know"
,DemonicBlaze,2010-08-30T04:21Z,Cool. No sound. Thats Cool. 
,Ninraider,2010-09-28T18:59Z,so cool thanks!!!!

,CanadaUnderFire,2011-02-19T23:12Z,"Just because we buy an album to show our support doesn't mean they still won't break up. If they're having issues within the band, how does our support change those issues for them?"
,CanadaUnderFire,2011-02-19T23:16Z,"And actually, thats what they should do for albums, people send in money straight to the band and then the band sends you an autographed copy or something, that way they get all their money and thy can worry about paying the record company themselves."
,micnor14,2011-03-01T02:50Z,Thanks for the heads-up AND link CaptainBaboon42!!! 
,jstans84,2011-03-22T02:13Z,A7X foREVer!
,AaronAnxiety,2011-05-07T23:56Z,"Only reason I'm Torrenting the Avenged Sevenfold albums is because I own them all but the got stolen by my ex girlfriend, I've paid my tribute to them already.

I think the biggest nightmare I have is losing those albums.. then it happened :(

GOOD UPLOADS THOUGH THANKS!!

Avenged Sevenfold foREVer!! "
,dsforever,2011-05-22T07:14Z,"Excellent mate, thanks!"
,kornbred69,2011-08-24T22:13Z,"mabe some should see it as it used to be.... albums were a way to bring people to the live show... and that became capitolized now more albums less shows... hell some artists dont even do live shows... ever...


and as with most art ... someone makes it... another person buys it, and everyone else enjoys it when they share... as nehao says sharing is caring... lol"
