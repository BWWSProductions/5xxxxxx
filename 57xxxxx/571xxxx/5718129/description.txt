Sleeper Car is a five-piece band steeped in roots music. Michael Musikantow's vocals are somewhat reminiscent of Jeff Buckley. The vocals combine well with the pedal steel and fiddle to give each song a rich texture of sound. Some great harmony vocals appear on "Anti-Climactic Girl" and "Caliber Eyes."

At twenty-two minutes, this six-song EP gives a great taste of the band. Sure, I wish it were longer, but the band goes all out, bringing in five guests (vocalists and musicians) to help out on this well-crafted album. I don't know what else to say about this other than that I am really looking forward to a full-length release from this band.
