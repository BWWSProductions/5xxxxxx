,therealdeal74,2010-08-11T00:22Z,How do you register this using the serial numbers? It looks like you have to download the Touchdown key app to register and to do that you have to pay for the key app.
,tizzybag,2010-08-16T03:20Z,"1. Open TouchDown on your device
2. On the main TouchDown screen, click the icon which looks like a Shopping Cart
3. In the ""Activate"" screen that pops up, select the option ""I have a license key""
4. Type in the license key below it
5. If you dont mistype the key, the Go button at the bottom will be enabled. Click it

Hope that helps!"

,wraithe001,2010-10-27T06:09Z,"Awesome post thanks! A new version was released (6.2) and has blacklisted these keys so if you want to keep using touchdown, avoid the update (until new ones post)"
,skatastic,2011-03-15T00:15Z,Anyone know where there is a key for 6.4.0002?

Thanks... Cheers."
