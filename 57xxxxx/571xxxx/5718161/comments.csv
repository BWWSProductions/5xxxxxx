ThunderBun - hope them stones have passed...terrible stuff from what I've heard."

,thunderbum,2010-07-27T06:04Z,"Tainan - I passed the one that was visible on x-ray when I first went in. The X-ray I had last week didn't show anything now.

The surgeon mentioned the type of stone I get can be dissolved by taking the baking soda capsules. Bonus! If I don't have to deal with any more stones I'll be a happy camper!

When you made the comment the other day about having a beer reminded me of a comedy skit done by Bill Engvall I think it was. The perils of mixing booze and pain pills - and then going parasailing. 

Hope I don't have to go through this again, but then again that's what I said each time before.

Also hope you never have to experience this yourself!"
