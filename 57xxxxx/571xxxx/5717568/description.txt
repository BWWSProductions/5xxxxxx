           "The Most Dangerous Man in America" is the story of what       
           happens when a former Pentagon insider, armed only with        
           his conscience, steadfast determination, and a file            
           cabinet full of classified documents, decides to               
           challenge an "Imperial" Presidency-answerable to neither       
           Congress, the press, nor the people-in order to help end       
           the Vietnam War. In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg shook America        
           to its foundations when he smuggled a top-secret Pentagon      
           study to the New York Times that showed how five               
           Presidents consistently lied to the American people about      
           the Vietnam War that was killing millions and tearing          
           America apart. President Nixon's National Security             
           Advisor Henry Kissinger called Ellsberg "the most              
           dangerous man in America," who "had to be stopped at all       
           costs." But Ellsberg wasn't stopped. Facing 115 years in       
           prison on espionage and conspiracy charges, he fought          
           back. Ensuing events surrounding the so-called Pentagon        
           Papers led directly to Watergate and the downfall of           
           President Nixon, and hastened the end of the Vietnam War.      
           Ellsberg's relentless telling of truth to power, which         
           exposed the secret deeds of an "Imperial Presidency,"          
           inspired Americans of all walks of life to forever             
           question the previously-unchallenged pronouncements of         
           its leaders. "The Most Dangerous Man in America" tells         
           the inside story, for the first time on film, of this          
           pivotal event that changed history and transformed our         
           nation's political discourse. It is told largely by the        
           players of that dramatic episode-Ellsberg, his                 
           colleagues, family and critics; Pentagon Papers authors        
           and government officials; Vietnam veterans and anti-war        
           activists; Watergate principals, attorneys and the             
           journalists who both covered the story and were an             
           integral part of it; and finally-through White House           
           audiotapes-President Nixon and his inner circle of             
           advisors.
