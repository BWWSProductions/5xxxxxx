July 12, 2004 was a very special night at the Monterux Festival for any blues fan. With Carlos Santana as music director and special guest guitarist, 3 musical legends took the stage. Each one delivered a full concert set packed with some of the finest blues guitar playing you'll ever hear. Bobby Parker, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, and Buddy Guy are all headline acts in their own right so it was a real coup to get them on one line-up. Throw in the guest appearances by Carlos Santana and Chic Meastro Nile Rodgers, and blues heaven is complete!
