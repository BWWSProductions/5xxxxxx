The Flight of the Conchords are a folk/pop/comedy duo composed of Bret McKenzie of The Black Seeds and Figwit fame and Jemaine Clement of The Humourbeasts. Billing themselves as "New Zealand's fourth most popular guitar-based digi-bongo a cappella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo", the group depends upon a combination of witty banter and acoustic guitars to work the audience.


In 2002 they performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for the first time. Returning in 2003 with a new show, they were nominated for the prestigious Perrier Award. They also performed there in 2004.

In 2005, BBC Radio 2 broadcast their first radio series. Largely improvised, it features Rob Brydon as their narrator, Rhys Darby as their manager and Jimmy Carr as a devoted fan called Kipper.
