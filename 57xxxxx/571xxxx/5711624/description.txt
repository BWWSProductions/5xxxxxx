Vampire$ - John Steakley

It all starts with Vampire$, Inc. cleaning out a nest of vampires and having some difficulty collecting their payment. Then while hosting a wild party at a local motel for the team and some townsfolk the party is interrupted by a 'master' vampire who slaughters everyone but Jack Crow and his second in command "Cherry Cat" Catlin.
A shaken Jack Crow regroups and begins to plan the formation of a new team, aided by Father Adam, a knowledgeable young priest sent to him by the Vatican and Felix, a gunman that proves to be deadly with a pistol.
A series of battles ensues, using new resources to kill the blood-suckers but surely and steadily the shit starts hitting the fan.

"Vampire$" is the novel in which the film "Vampires", by John Carpenter, was based.
