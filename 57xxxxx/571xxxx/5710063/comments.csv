I'm new to the site and was not sure if it was something I was doing wrong I downloaded the movie and can hear it when it opens in windows media player but I cant see it I went as far as putting it on a DVD and trying to play it that way but no luck would you know what i may be doing wrong?
,Kikee_31,2011-06-29T06:58Z,"**    @Texas70  ** -   Hi there. I'm no expert when it comes to this stuff, but i think that if u dl VLC media player (its free of course) you wont have anymore problems (at least not viewing probs with any torrent DLed from any of the VIPs or Trusteds in here). Seriously, GOTTA GET VLC player!! Hope that helped! =)"
