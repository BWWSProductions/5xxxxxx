,mrexitus,2010-12-24T23:02Z,"it works for me... You just need to rename extension to "".ipa"". Don't extract it, just rename and put to iPhone. Good luck"
,sp1kenson,2010-12-30T17:37Z,"FolkoTeka ti si idiot...

It is for Iphone guys works fine on my 3G, however a new updated version is out 1.3.1 I think with latest 2010 Q3 map updates, it'd rock if someone would upload it.

Will seed for a week cause my upload is limited."
