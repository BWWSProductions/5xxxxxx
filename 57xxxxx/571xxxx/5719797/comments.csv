[V],MAFIAA.,2010-07-27T17:02Z,Just replace the file r27 with the one you downloaded on game otherwise you can't unpack the game...
,ABadName,2010-07-27T18:12Z,^^Well I can't open the rar file cause it says I dont have the required Disk Space -_- no matter where i put it. 
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-07-27T20:32Z,Don't open him replace him with one in the directory you downloaded before! then extract the entire game...
,bravolas,2010-07-27T21:22Z,"@ABadName :

You can't open the file because you probably have your hard drive in FAT32. you need to have it in NTFS. You can convert it."
,bravolas,2010-07-27T21:23Z,"@ABadName :

You can't open the file because you probably have your hard drive in FAT32. you need to have it in NTFS. 

But you dont need to open it. Just replace the r27 file."
,iPlay.Metallica,2010-07-27T22:08Z,"@stun
Can U play Skirimish Against AI ?!"
,savagecandy,2010-07-27T23:32Z,Ugh none of this makes sense. What RAR are you guys talking about? I only see the installer and 3 install MPQ files. 
,savagecandy,2010-07-28T00:12Z,Again... no cooperation here in explaining
,Karlston,2010-07-28T00:36Z,"God it's hard...

If you downloaded *THIS* torrent...

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5719719/Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY

IF YOU DIDN'T DOWNLOAD *THAT* torrent, then move on, there is nothing in *this* torrent for you.

Then you need to replace the .r27 file in *THAT* torrent, with the .r27 file in *THIS* torrent. *THEN* you can unpack it.

The unpacked file is larger then 4GB, so you need an NTFS file system, FAT32 won't let you unpack it."
,HamHamHam,2010-07-28T02:41Z,Im assuming this won't work on mac?
,enha,2010-07-28T11:11Z,HOw the Fuck can u play Skirmish? :| only campaign without zerg...
,Lucky13s,2010-07-28T11:24Z,"I just bought the game, I had problems with that last crack.

Anyways, having the full game is neat too, I had the beta since the beginning so I already knew all about battlenet. This game is great to play on ladder, and some of the custom games are neat too.

Heh I find the campaign too easy actually, I have to play on the hardest mode because I already know all the strats."
,Klowner,2010-07-28T13:01Z,Cool story bro
,MrTTAO,2010-07-28T15:45Z,"this says r27... what version is r27?

,Slyder212,2010-07-28T16:16Z,Start seeding the Reloaded version! At least that will works.
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-07-28T18:13Z,Slyder212 stop talking crap man. i don't see you seeding anything :)
,Slyder212,2010-07-28T18:57Z,"Stun, its not my fault that this version is fucked up. And not just for me. Currently I downloading the Reloaded verion, after that I gonna seed it."
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-07-28T19:30Z,@Slyder212 only think thats fucked up its your knowledge mate. everyone got it working please don't spread stupid false signals.
,disturbed1117,2010-07-28T20:49Z,it says that when I try to copy the file that I can't modify the original volume....
,disturbed1117,2010-07-28T20:52Z,I try to move this file to the original torrent but it says I can't modify the volume?
,Rawmeat,2010-07-28T23:10Z,"Ok, look... for you who doesn't know how to do this: copy the r27.rar file then just paste it into the starcraft 2 LIBERTY folder... voila! Don't forget to pick copy and replace! (duh)"
,randwich,2010-07-29T17:42Z,"maybe you should've named this RARFIX like every other real release does, i know there's tons of idiots on this site that would still be asking, but the r27 thing was kind of confusing to me (for about fifteen seconds, then i thought about it before posting retarded questions)"
,Bfm322,2010-07-30T01:47Z,"Hey, just real quick. I was reading some comments posted in other torrents and was left under the impression that I can somehow save my game by dragging files or whatever. I've gotten pretty far into the game, and..I really don't want to start all over when I close it."
,cannavaro5,2010-07-30T21:32Z,"I don't understand the thing with r27, can somebody explain?"

,mikey52664,2010-08-01T04:48Z,"After I unrar it, the autorun from the dvd does nothing.  And running Installer.exe on the dvd does nothing and shows no error msg about what's wrong.  It just acts like a virus, the exe file runs then shows the user nothing.  Oh well have fun buying gay porn with my credit card info 'Liberty'.  You dumb f'n bitches..."
,tommyboi75,2010-08-01T13:33Z,"Thank you sir. I've followed your instruction with the best of my ability. 

So far this is what I did; Replaced r27 file with the original one, then extracted all the files to my desktop folder labeled sc2.

 Everything came out beautiful except now I have an error when I attempt to install. Can anyone help me out with this please?"
,soosoox,2010-08-03T00:46Z,added the file and it damaged the rest when i tried to unrar it. bullshit.
,red255,2010-08-05T18:25Z,"Downloaded the big release with 2000 seeds, 10000 leachers (likely because people aren't downloading R27 so they don't become seeders)

Got a Virus, some scansoft POS thing, had to reboot in safe mood and do a virus scan while I manually cleaned out my registry.

Downloaded R27 from this torrent.

Opened the ISO.  installer won't run when Daemon tools is running.

SO I copyied the files off the ISO image to my harddrive to a folder C:\SCDump

and ran the installer.  So what We are looking at 40-50 Gigabytes of harddrive and like 3 hours (including the spyware sweep) to get the thing installed.

Probably not the quickest or easiest way to get things done.  but hardly anything off standard bypass of piracy protections.  about to apply patch and crack now.  "
,seantheokayone,2010-08-06T12:52Z,"for the people that don't know what the ""r27"" thing is, it's a segment of the .rar file that contained the starcraft 2 .iso

so this is like a replacement part for that one piece of the rar file for the main Liberty release of Starcraft 2"
,pablione,2010-08-07T19:23Z,"SO.. I DL'd the game + the .r27 fix, changed it to the SC folder, unrared, mounted ISO with deamon tools but when I try to run the installer as admin it does nothing... any clues?"
,mazdapower05,2010-08-26T17:13Z,please seed guys :) 
,mazdapower05,2010-08-26T18:53Z,it will not start to download for me.. I'm using BitTorrent.. can someone help please?? :)
,dayshero,2010-08-29T15:45Z,"Haha, the game developers love you, I've never seen so many people decide they are just going to buy the game instead of deal with all the bs. lmao"
