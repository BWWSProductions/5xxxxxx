This is a direct copy of the bonus DVD from the StarCraft II - Wings of Liberty Collector's Edition. It contains a detailed documentary about the making of StarCraft II - Wings of Liberty as well as what appear to be all 20 in game cinematics. But since you can't actually play (or even install) the game until the official release date I have no way of checking if this assumption is correct. I also haven't seen all of the cinematic videos, since I don't want to spoil the campaign experience for me.
But I have seen the making of and extra videos and they are quite informative as well as entertaining, a treat for any StarCraft fan out there ;)

I haven't tested every single file (see above), but all the videos I did test worked fine with VLC player (videolan.org).
I have no idea if the original DVD menu can be reconstructed from the files (I am no DVD ripping expert :X) but the order given by the filenames seems to be just fine, so even if not, it's still watchable ;)

A warning to all the diehard SC fans: even the behind the scenes stuff contains some mild spoilers* so if you don't like any spoilers at all, wait until you have played the game first!

This is an upload from a StarCraft fan for all the other fans out there who can't wait for the 27th. I was just lucky enough to get my hands on a Collector's Edition a few days earlier. If you are a fan of Blizzard's work, go out and by it (you probably will have to anyway, thanks to the compulsory online registration and Blizzard's overall cracking down on piracy ;)

Oh and finally: don't be a dick, seed XD
