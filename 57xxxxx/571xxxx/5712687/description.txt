"She Won't Be Lonely Long" is the title of a country music song written by Galen Griffin, Doug Johnson, and Phil O'Donnell, and recorded by American country music artist Clay Walker. It is the first single from his ninth studio album, also titled She Won't Be Lonely Long.

A music video was filmed for the song on April 9, 2010. Directed by Marcel, the video shows Walker walking on the beach, singing the song. It also features him, on a farm, filming a woman with a camcorder.

"She Won't Be Lonely Long" debuted at #59 on the Hot Country Songs  chart dated November 28, 2009, about a week before its initial release date. It peaked at #4 on that chart, his highest peaking single since the 2000 single, "The Chain of Love". It also debuted at #99 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the chart dated April 17, 2010.

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a favorable review. He described it as "a laid-back single that finds Walker not only in fine voice but singing a solid country song about how you can read body language and social cues of a woman who has stepped out on a lonely relationship to test the waters."

"She Won't Be Lonely Long" is a moderate up-tempo song, featuring accompaniment from electric guitar and piano. The song deals with a male narrator's fascination with a woman whose lover had just left her (i.e. "the way she's dancin' and drinkin' Chill Patron.") He also plans to date the woman, stating that "if she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long."

She Won't Be Lonely Long is the ninth studio album by American country music artist Clay Walker, and was released on June 8, 2010, via Curb Records. It is Walker's first studio album since 2007's Fall.
