@ all (and tushar)

I am starting to make things systematical so that it becomes easy for me & all the fans

1. Each Month will be divided in to 15 days each with first 15 days for TV shows & last 15 for movies

2. I Would be doing around 6-9 Tv shows & 15 - 20 Movies in a month

3. Old movie requests would be taken only in the first week of month. Requests posted anytime else may be done but most likely will be ignored.
This is done so that I can keep track on all the requests that I have agreed to do. New movie requests can be done anytime.

4. No TV Show requests are being taken for now as I already have a lot of requests that I have to lined up. Will start taking request for TV Shows from October onwards. TV requests should be made in the 3rd week of the Month.

I strongly feel this system will make life a lot more easy for me :p"

Wanna ask about you Kick Ass upload.
Why there is some blocks (i mean, its like a corrupted scene) at minutes 22, when hit girl comes to his daddy to get the Knife gift.

I've downloaded about 3 times this kinda rip.
But all of them has the same block.

Is it because of my LCD Screen or your rip ?"

they played fine.. without any synching problem .."
[V],RiddlerA,2010-07-28T15:11Z,"@ frosthate

its not ur LCD ......... this type of glitch happens sometime after encoding. I don't think it is much of a bother though it stays for like half a sec

@ ancre

first of all reinstall the codec pack
Than watch the movie in MPC  or WMP ....... it should play fine

If you want to watch it on GOM PLayer ........ Right click after opening the Player ----> video setting ---> Filters (in side Panel) ----> Disable Filter ----> Click Enable quick play mode

or in KMplayer go to 

options > preferences > video processing > look at the right pane > hit renderer > in the RENDERER setting select "" enhanced video renderer "" > then hit close > restart KMPlayer.


It should take care of the Choppiness & jerkiness in the video"

,wira020,2010-08-11T11:40Z,"I personally dont mind some of these synching problems... fast pace scene might look stuttery but the detail is good, i still can count how many pimple an actor/actress has.. haha...that's what HD is all about after all... seeing every drop of sweat on someone's forehead felt real enuff to me.. it's a good compromise for people like me who wants to watch it but cant afford downloading 4gb files..."
,wira020,2010-08-11T11:45Z,"B4 i forget, VLC suxs.. K lite codec & media player classic is the best... it's miles away in technology than vlc... mpc been doing dxva for years while vlc had just implement it last month..

Tips for people with a gpu, try enabling some SHADERS ( right click on movie while playing ) try deinterlace, it might helps with fast paced scene.. i personally enable ""Denoise, Sharpen Complex 2, 0-255""... it'll improve the image quality...

Thanks you, RiddlerA.. for helping people like me experience 720p movies..."

,wira020,2010-08-21T18:59Z,"Hey, why is this movie playing like it is playing with low frame rate or sumthin.. Like a constant and light stuttering.. movement not smooth the whole movie.. is it the style of the movie? image quality is fine and everything else like the sound and subtitle sync perfectly... makes me wonder if the director wants the movie to be like this... is it?"
