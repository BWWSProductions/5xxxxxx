,poeticpyro,2010-07-27T17:05Z,Site will not let me edit my description and it cut off my whole description I put so read below this comment for full description and instructions on how to install ROMs (hopefully it will all fit)!
,poeticpyro,2010-07-27T17:05Z,"We knew about the emulator for the PlayStation gaming console (dubbed the PSX as it was the first in Sony?s gaming line) since early June, but a 1.0 release has finally made its way to the Android market for $5.99 courtesy of ZodTTD. It?s named psx4droid and is currently the only emulator for the legendary console available for public download.

It?s not the smoothest on all devices (you?re definitely going to need a recent high-end handset to make the most out of the experience) but it?s definitely more than we could imagine at this point in Android?s life. I can?t help but imagine that this won?t be the most elegant experience on a mobile phone: there are just not enough physical buttons on a phone to emulate the original analog stick-equipped DualShock, and the screen real-estate needed to implement a software-based solution might not be the best for everyone.

Still, we look forward to continued development as it deservedly sits alongside some of the better emulators on the market (NESOID, SNESOID, Gameboid, etc.) from generations past.

,Rikplay,2010-07-28T14:26Z,"Worked perfect on my Nexus one, Just put the files on my sd card, located with astro, installed, when opened i had to locate the provided bios. Then, within the app i browsed the sd card for the rom and it loaded straight away. Tested Gran turismo. Never read the guide to set up roms, it just worked
Works great.
Just to be clear, No Payment or code required.
Many thanks to Poeticpyro"

If anybody is interested in the 1.1 update (provides R2/L2) let me know and I'll upload that as well as the program(s) I use to convert/compress  the files.  The compression program converts it to eboot and, for most games, compresses the file size by 1/2+."
,poeticpyro,2010-07-31T06:13Z,"v1.1 can be found here:

Includes ecm converter & icetea bin/image compressor."
