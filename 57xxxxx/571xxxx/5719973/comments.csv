,abq614,2010-08-22T16:49Z,"It's work. First download the update + patch in the Nemeth web and then install it. Then, for takeoff press shift + 1 for quick star (under 

view menu too). Finally push all the way the two yellow lever in the upper front. Be aware of the fail to turn with rudder in the saitek x52 joystick. Enjoy it!"

,fuzdemon,2012-01-16T20:58Z,seems like only a few people can get this thing started. pressing shift and 1 just opens the cockpit view not start the engines.
