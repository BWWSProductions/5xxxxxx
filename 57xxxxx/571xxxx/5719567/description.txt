PLOT:

Four high school friends plan to ride out their senior year taking easy classes, including a program for housing foreign exchange students and eventually all attending Ohio State. Hurdles befall each of the four: grades, higher aspirations, love. Is it the Foreign Exchange students that learn from their host or the hosts that do more of the learning?


IMDB REVIEW:

This is the first teen movie where all the actors actually are and/or look like teens. If you are looking for a movie with "American Pie" humor, then continue searching, because this movie can not compete with "American Pie" humor. Don't get me wrong, I am not an "American Pie" fan but those movies are WAY more funny then this one.

This movie does not have any exaggerated scenes, everything you see could have happened for real. So don't expect any "Scary Movie" scenarios.

There are a few funny lines that I will never forget, like this one "Searching for a good girlfriend is like searching for a good used car, if the oil smells funny, there is something wrong with the vehicle." I gave this movie a 6 because I didn't laugh once. I smiled a couple of times but that's it. This is not the movie you want to buy, rent it, and only if you like high-school-movies.
