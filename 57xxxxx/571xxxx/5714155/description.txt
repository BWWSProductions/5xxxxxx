Ripped from the Criterion DVD
720 x 480, 16:9, x264

I avoided any filters to maintain the original graininess of the film.  Even so, there are very few noticeable artifacts that weren't also in the source.

Audio is the original English track in AC3 format.

I hope to provide everyone with a chance to see this great film at an acceptable quality.  Please enjoy and leave feedback, as I would like to continue releasing great films that don't have an x264 release.
