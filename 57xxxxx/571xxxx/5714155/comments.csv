,Diarrhea_Moustache,2010-08-03T05:56Z,SEED!! This is getting ridiculous; I've uploaded 37 GB of this file and only one person is seeding.  Remember the Golden Rule.  For those who do not understand torrents: make sure the share ratio of each torrent is at least one; that means you have shared as much as you have downloaded.  Most people should try to do more than that. I usually share to at least two.
