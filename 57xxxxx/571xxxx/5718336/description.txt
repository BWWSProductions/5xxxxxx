Our theoretical spaceman blasts into the future to imagine what Earth will be like 250
million years from now. He'll search for signs of past human life, but with all our
landmarks dissolved away his only hope is to find a fossilized city that has survived
nature's powerful forces. Perhaps he can find New Orleans, which would have been buried
under the Mississippi Delta. What will the evidence he finds reveal: further evolution, or
the destruction of our species?
