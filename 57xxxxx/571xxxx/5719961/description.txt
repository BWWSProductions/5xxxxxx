This is the official iTunes released album. I bought it, and reencoded it to MP3, which is the most common music format AND does not have my iTunes account linked to it (like the original M4A file did).

I reencoded the file at the highest VBR setting possible (VBR-100).

Here is the track listing:

1. "Nightmare"   6:16 
2. "Welcome to the Family"   4:05 
3. "Danger Line"   5:28 
4. "Buried Alive"   6:44 
5. "Natural Born Killer"   5:15 
6. "So Far Away"   5:26 
7. "God Hates Us"   5:19 
8. "Victim"   7:29 
9. "Tonight the World Dies"   4:41 
10. "Fiction"   5:08 
11. "Save Me"   10:56
12. "Lost It All"   10:12	(iTunes Pre-Order bonus track)
