,skookie5,2010-07-30T02:08Z,"200-250 varying bitrate but sounds great...definit above itunes quality. The quality of all the supposed ""320 kbps"" versions of this album were bad as I DLed and tested them all. Funny enough, in raw and just best sounding quality this is the suggested download."
,AndissPaine,2010-08-01T08:39Z,Great All In All but You Added Some Weird Combichist Song With It And A Song Called Hate Me IDK But Great Anyways
,gpag1,2010-08-01T20:07Z,"Thanks for the support guys. I would just like to put something out there. I care about quality first, and number of seeders is what it is. I can say that, as skookie5 said, most of the 320 kbps dls are worse quality, because they were decompressed and then reencoded to 320 kbps. This loses quality! And I feel sorry for those who don't know that. I may not have the most seeders, but I do have the best quality.


Also, AndissPaine what the hell are you talking about?  Does anyone else know what he's talking about?"
,spelonkar,2010-08-02T00:23Z,Whats with the weird tracking issues and can it be fixed?
