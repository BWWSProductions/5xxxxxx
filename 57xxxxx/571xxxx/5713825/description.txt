     new singer, take note the dvb version of this video came with     
     a bad 2:2 Pulldown and alot of interlaced scenes (pure),          
     althou this dvdrip has none of that, first assumed to be          
     pre-deinterlaced, but after closer inspection it appears to       
     be a normal progressive rip. enjoy!

     of providing the scene with the  best Rock & Metal vids from
