Avenged Sevenfold is an American rock band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. Consisting of M. Shadows (vocals), Synyster Gates (lead guitar), Zacky Vengeance (rhythm guitar) and Johnny Christ (bass), the band achieved mainstream success with their 2005 album City of Evil, which includes singles such as "Burn It Down", "Bat Country," "Beast and the Harlot" and "Seize the Day." The band's success followed with their self-titled album, that includes singles such as "Critical Acclaim", "Almost Easy", "Afterlife", "Scream" and "Dear God".
Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on their first two albums, but later changed their musical style into a more hard rock approach with City of Evil. The band themselves have received much credit for their worldwide mainstream success and were most notably proclaimed as one of the leaders and key bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal and were featured as second place on Ultimate Guitar's Top Ten Bands of the Decade. In December 2009, the death of their drummer and founding member, James "The Rev" Sullivan was announced. The band chose to continue on following Sullivan's death, recruiting Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater to replace Sullivan as a "rebound" drummer for their fifth studio album, entitled Nightmare, which will be released on July 27, 2010. Portnoy will also be performing with the band on their upcoming tours until the end of 2010.
