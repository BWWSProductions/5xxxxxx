Contains issues #1 through #23 of the current (v3) ongoing DC comic series Secret Six.

I can't take credit for these scans, they aren't mine.   I was trying to catch up on the series and found it to be a pain in the ass, I had to download them all separately.   Figured I'd throw 'em up together for the sake of convenience.


Thanks to RacerX, Spaceman Spiff, Green Giant, Shamil, Vogue Prophet, and DCP and the Minutemen for doing all the real work to supply us with these.   Sorry if I forgot everyone, you are appreciated.
