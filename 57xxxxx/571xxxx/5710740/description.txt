"Manson: The Notorious Crime and Trial"

Bill Kurtis takes a penetrating look at one of the strangest and most violent crimes in
California history--the grisly 1969 murders of seven people by the deranged Charles
Manson and his three female followers who believed he was Jesus Christ come again.
Kurtis talks with prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi about the terror that swept through Los
Angeles after the shocking killings and the bizarre "Helter Skelter" defense at the
trial. Kurtis also examines the attempt to silence a key witness, the sudden
disappearance of one defendant's attorney, and the Manson Family's obsession with drugs,
sex, and violence. But most of all, Kurtis is haunted by one question: How could three
young women from seemingly normal families turn into monsters?
