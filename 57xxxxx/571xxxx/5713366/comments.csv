So, this morning, I removed the torrent, downloaded the torrent (which i had made) from tpb, and tried to download the file into the same directory where it already was. Vuze dutifully checked the file, and then, finally, uploading began.

I'll be seeding a little slowly, but I will continue till WatchOCR comes out with a new version or they begin offering a torrent themselves."
