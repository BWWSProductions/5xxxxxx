WatchOCR is an open source OCR (optical character recognition) system that is on a bootable CD. 

I downloaded the file and verified it with the md5sum from the watchocr homepage. You can avoid taxing their servers for the whole 650MB file by quickly downloading the main file via bittorrent and just verify the integrity of the iso with the md5sum at http://watchocr.com/files/ This is for watchocr-V0.2-210-06-28-en.iso
