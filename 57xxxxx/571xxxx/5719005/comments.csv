[V],MKVGuy,2010-07-27T20:05Z,"@faizaan and my dear friends, I download the High resolution BR rips e.g. 720p rips which are also a re-encode of BD Rips and then re-encodes them in 360p/480i resolution i.e. the resolution I post here.. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display_standard

@bv_abhi, sorry dear, till now my rips are compatible of PC only..

@deffjam555, its not on DVD or Blueray..
@faizaan, the version availble is a R6 ver, please wait for original DVD or Blue ray.."
,usghkh,2010-07-27T21:28Z,"Your rips are excellent but i would suggest that h.264 can have pretty good results for 720p with target file size of 600-700 MB, infact better than the 720p rips of RiddlerA and poppedtard etc. Try them"
,faizaan,2010-07-27T21:30Z,and did u think abt u giving ur email id to me MKVguy.....?????
,usghkh,2010-07-27T21:36Z,"Your rips are excellent but i would suggest that h.264 can have pretty good results for 720p with target file size of 600-700 MB, infact better than the 720p rips of RiddlerA and poppedtard etc. Try them for a change"
,ninjaracoon,2010-07-28T03:01Z,@usghkh - imho 720p with 700mb file size looks like garbage.. but YMMV :)
[V],MKVGuy,2010-07-28T06:26Z,"720p is just double of what I do, so the filesize have be double of it and I will have to provide 5.1 audio with it.. so the filesize would be 1gig which I thought of doing them from last 2 months, but the major problem with me is the bandwidth, my new ISP provides me 1mb dl and 512kbps up, that's why I am not able to start them.. waiting for some ISP or my ISP who can provide me atleast 1mb up speed..

@faizaan, leave it.. just say here, nothing can be that personal with you.."
,siddhart,2010-07-28T08:51Z,"hmmmmm....
wats next man..."
,sreeja,2010-07-28T10:39Z,cud u please upload A - Team or Knight and day...plz plz upload any of these one films with a x264 dvdrip print please please.....upload any of these movies...
,faizaan,2010-07-28T11:07Z,ok MKVguy....anyways thanks for all your movies
,ninjaracoon,2010-07-28T12:03Z,"""720p is just double of what I do, so the filesize have be double of it"" 
@MKVGuy - I think there's something wrong with your computation..

MKVGuy encode  : 640x272=174,080 pixels
                 720p : 1280x544=696,320 pixels 

696,320/174,080= 4 

720p(1280x544) has 4 times more pixels than your encode(640x272), so you need 4 times more bitrate. :)

[V],RiddlerA,2010-07-28T15:39Z,"@ ninjaracoon

You are not entirely right
Bitrate does not depend entirely on Resolution ....... It depends upon length of the movie & types of graphics used in the movie as well

Increasing Bitrate 4 times may very well result in a good quality Rip but it will increase the size also & sometimes a judicial use of Bitrate can result in a good quality rip at a very attractive size"
,ninjaracoon,2010-07-28T16:19Z,"I'm just correcting mkvguy that 1280x544 is exacly 4 times bigger than 640x272 not twice like he said : ""720p is just double of what I do"". that's a fact.

""Increasing Bitrate 4 times may very well result in a good quality Rip but it will increase the size also & sometimes a judicial use of Bitrate can result in a good quality rip at a very attractive size ""
@riddlerA - yeah it also depends on the complexity of the source, 
and quality is very subjective.. IMHO a 720p film(non anime) with 1mbps bitrate looks sub-720p not a real HD,looks washout, but that's just me :)"
,usghkh,2010-07-28T16:27Z,"just so you all know, i respect all of you Riddler, MKVguy etc... and appreciate all the work u guys are doing"
,usghkh,2010-07-28T18:35Z,"Audio and Video are superb, 10/10 This is an excellent rip"
,ahadi74,2010-07-28T19:12Z,"seed pls
nice work"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-07-28T20:48Z,"@ninjaracoon, got your point dear but I wrote it for a layperson to just give them an idea about filesize..
but I strongly believe that a 720p in 1gig with 5.1 aac 300kbps audio for a movie of runtime less than or around 1:30 will be good.. for runtime of 1:45, 1.2gb, for 2hrs 1.4gb.. why don't you give it a try.. I lack of bandwidth but I think you are not.. your 480p rip in 700mb is just awesome.."
,ninjaracoon,2010-07-29T06:50Z,"@mkvguy- now that you mentioned it, I think my encode is not 480p but 448p. and yours is 360p :) "
,PHREEBO,2010-08-06T15:14Z,"Thanks again MKVGuy, your the best! Great quality & everything is in sync. These small MKV files are incredible"
,inianlion,2010-08-18T17:16Z,"Superb quality both Video and Audio.
Thanks a lot MKVGuy...
+1."
,a_khosravi61,2010-09-05T11:13Z,"I'm Downloading Now.
MKVguy is best choice for low bandwidth [like me], thanks"
,dfrkgk,2010-09-26T15:17Z,"which player u guys r using??
I cudnt play it using KMplayer or vlc"
,dfrkgk,2010-09-27T17:14Z,"managed to run it using KMplayer.

thank you MKVGuy, awesome video quality "
,tanmoyzip,2011-02-16T17:33Z,"boss, U do awsome work. is there any way to keep the size under 300mb? if yes, then plz try to reduce the size?"
