,varilthes,2010-07-28T15:03Z,"The BBC and Steven Moffat strike gold again with this, contemporary take on Sherlock Holmes. If you dont know Steven Moffat is the Brainchild behind the revamp of Dr Who Series. Being one of the best television comebacks in history this guys got a nack for great television serials. 

If youre a fan of Mr Moffats, Dr who series you will find many similarities in the way that show and this new Sherlock Holmes show operate, and this is a good thing.

Is there something I can do ? Or is this just how the series was created ?  It's really annoying since I can barrely make out the conversations. Especially when music is playing during a conversation. :("
