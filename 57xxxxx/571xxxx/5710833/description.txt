The Penny Dreadfuls are a sketch group of three who specialise in Victorian themed comedy. They have two hugely successful Edinburgh festivals under their belt where they started out as relative unknowns to secure many 5-star reviews from critics and a loyal fan base. This year the group make their debut on BBC 7 with a brand new four part radio series that tells the extraordinary life stories of four Faversham brothers - Horatius, Victorian Britain's most decorated soldier; Theseus, a detective even more famous than Sherlock Holmes; Leonidas, an explorer who left no corner of the Empire untouched and Augustus, the man who became Victorian Britain's most celebrated magician.
