Pink Floyd Truth and Delusion is a ICC video derived from the Pink Floyd CONSTRUCT "Dark Side of a Dream", rewoven and re-engineered by "Lenstwo2" (Ray Kolling).

"Dark Side of a Dream," with a worldwide download total of approximately 1 Million copies, in effect became a "New" Pink Floyd audio album, the Whole being greater than the sum of its parts...

"Truth and Delusion" is the video inspired by that production.

Speaking on behalf of a million Pink Floyd fans, THANKS, Ray.
