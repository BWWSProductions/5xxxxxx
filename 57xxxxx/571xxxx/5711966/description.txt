PrisM NOTES:
Right....very late on this one, but this has got new audio source, the audio sounds better than whats out to me, but that maybe personal opinion. Audio is not awesome but it's pretty good.

Video was pretty orange all over, had many different colour problems but the main was the orange tan look. So i changed all the colors trying to keep colour into the movie, yet remove as much orange as i could, to me i removed most of it, but theirs still a fair bit their, but viewing trailers seems some of the movie is supposed to be like it, i tweaked the hue a fair bit, and changed the brightness and contrast. i didn't make it any darker just increased brightness and then lowered contrast to balance it. Changed a few other bits also, but to me this looks good enough for the select few :). 

Thanks to Blihre for the audio!
