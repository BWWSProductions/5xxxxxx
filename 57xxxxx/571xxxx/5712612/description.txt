We all know, We all know by that you're the only thing you talk about
(WHORE)

So forgive me for bragging out loud, I tried to reason with myself
Tell me what could I have done?
Maybe I should have asked you to stay, like I was gonna, just get up and hand it away
But babe, like they say about something's, well I guess that they never change

We all know, We all know by now that you're the only thing you talk about
We all know, We all know by now that things won't work out
No, you've got nothing to say
You've got nothing, you've got nothing to say

Someday I hope you'll see the consequences of your actions
I know, that I can do so much more without you
But babe, like they say about something's, well I guess that they never change

We all know, We all know by now that you're the only thing you talk about
We all know, We all know by now that things wont work out
No, I never really had a doubt
That things would end up to be this way
And I never meant to make them seem that way
You've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
You've got nothing...

And I swore as I left you'd go and fuck someone else
YOU WHORE

You've got nothing to say
We all know, We all know by now that you're the only thing you talk about
We all know, We all know by now that things won't work out
No, I never really had a doubt
That things would end up to be this way
And I never meant to make them seem that way
You've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
You've got nothing...
