Dance Workout for dummies.


Dance Workout for Dummies is a fun and easy way to burn off calories and improve your fitness level. Use these two 20-minute dance workouts regularly and you'll not only notice a difference in the way you look, but also in the way you feel because dance builds confidence and boosts energy levels. Don't worry if you haven't danced before - these routines are easy to follow, starting with simple foot patterns and gradually adding arm movements and style!

Fun workouts are more effective because they are easier to stick to and help students stay motivated. The routines in this programme won't get dull, and dance is a proven way to not only burn fat, but increase energy levels. Exercise expert Michelle LeMay leads the way through these upbeat routines.
