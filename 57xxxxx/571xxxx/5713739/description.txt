This is a historical interview with Commodore Amiga Engineer Dave Haynie from St. Louis Amiga, 2001. Dave was with Commodore since 1983, and was almost solely responsible for the design of the Amiga 2000 computer. Fantastic stuff, in a day when Amiga ruled the creative world. There are those of us that experienced the era, and we know how the Amiga was 10 years ahead of the PC in the day. Please seed!
