This was upped by Cycleof7 4/10, but lost its seeders.  I downloaded it from another site, and am reupping it for latecomers like me.  Not the same version, but it will do.  In the words of C-of-7:
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149677/


Released 1977 (U.S. release 1979)


A strange signal arrives on the Earth disturbing all communications, while an ufo appears above the Antarctic sea. Captain Alex Hamilton is sent with his spaceship and crew to the space outside the Solar System to find the origin of that signal. They reach an unknown planet where a giant robot enslaved a whole population of humanoids by taking their psychic energies. The robot's got his eyes on the Earth, too.

Enjoy!
