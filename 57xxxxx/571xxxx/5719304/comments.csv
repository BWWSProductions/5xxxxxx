,deathtrooper30,2010-07-27T13:15Z,You can start a saved game by going to your Documents folder and looking for your saved games under the SC2 folder and opening the specific save with the SC2 Launcher!

One question i did 1st mission and got like 3 autosaves.

I exited game and tried to load one, but then it gave me an error report saying my installation is corrupt and asked me to repair it...

How come you guys can load your savegames?"
[T],Askeen.,2010-07-27T16:18Z,"Upadate the game, copy over the crack content then run the game from the launcher! "

,TonyS1,2010-07-27T21:42Z,"ok this took me 5 fucking tries but got it... 1st I'm using an EnGB version (the collectors ED)
install it, then it updates auto. It needs to update again as well, if it doesn't do this... close the launcher and relaunch from the desktop shortcut (only use this to launch the game) if it still doesn't update, restart your pc and relaunch again. Once it's updated RUN THE GAME 1st WITH NO CRACKS APPLIED... then close it, apply the cracks and start from ""Start Campaign"" also the tutorials work... any other combination and this will fuck-up. Trust me I have been going at it for hours. BTW I have launched and relaunched the game and played briefly 4 times to verify
GOD DAMMIT what a hassle but thanx to the cracker, this is legit folks, just a pain in the ass is all :)"
