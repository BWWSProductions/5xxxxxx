,eh5229,2010-07-24T08:42Z,Thank you. Always a good download. Keep it up! Don't let the small numbers discourage anyone. This is time sensitive material so people don't keep seeding. GO GLENN!
,zorchtorrent,2010-07-25T00:03Z,"Actually, I've noticed that this stuff generally remains seeded for at least a few weeks. I've also noticed lots of peers downloading from China and Eastern Europe. :)
If you want episodes since June 21 2010, post a comment, and I'll re-seed it. "
