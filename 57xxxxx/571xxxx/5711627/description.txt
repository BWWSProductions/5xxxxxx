A Beautiful Mind - Sylvia Nasar

Stories of famously eccentric Princetonians abound--such as that of chemist Hube
rt Alyea, the model for The Absent-Minded Professor, or Ralph Nader, said to hav
e had his own key to the library as an undergraduate. Or the "Phantom of Fine H
all," a figure many students had seen shuffling around the corridors of the math
and physics building wearing purple sneakers and writing numerology treatises o
n the blackboards. The Phantom was John Nash, one of the most brilliant mathema
ticians of his generation, who had spiraled into schizophrenia in the 1950s. Hi
s most important work had been in game theory, which by the 1980s was underpinni
ng a large part of economics. When the Nobel Prize committee began debating a p
rize for game theory, Nash's name inevitably came up--only to be dismissed, sinc
e the prize clearly could not go to a madman. But in 1994 Nash, in remission fr
om schizophrenia, shared the Nobel Prize in economics for work done some 45 year
s previously.
Economist and journalist Sylvia Nasar has written a biography of Nash that looks
at all sides of his life. She gives an intelligent, understandable exposition o
f his mathematical ideas and a picture of schizophrenia that is evocative but de
cidedly unromantic. Her story of the machinations behind Nash's Nobel is fascina
ting and one of very few such accounts available in print.
