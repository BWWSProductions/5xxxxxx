I have ripped audiobooks in lossless format at lower bitrates (The silence between words really brings it down).

64kbps mono should be fine for audio books (I can't hear the difference at that rate anyway). This torrent could be only 0.37GiB instead of 1.85GiB"
,MAVERICK900,2010-07-25T03:37Z,I always download at 320 kbps for 1 reason quality you can always recode it smaller but you cant recode it larger And since you have download this and your not paying for it me think thou does protest to much so please enjoy it and try not to be ungrateful
,LoudiPlay,2010-07-25T05:18Z,I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I do appreciate it. I was just commenting that you can have the same quality at a much lower file size. Thank you for the torrent.
