This is a copy of Final Fantasy VIII (8) for PSX (Playstation 1).
I made it because I downloaded a version a while ago (from TPB) and it turns out that the 1st Disk on that rip is corrupt(It crashes at the dance, just after they bump into another couple and Rhinoa smiles at Squall - it hangs. EVERY TIME.)
So I got a good copy(from my original version) and put it up.
