,arcadekidd,2010-07-25T07:19Z,"@ BOYCOTT
Yes he is painful to watch. He is just as painful in the music video with Justin Beiber. He should just stick with being Will and Jada's son.

This copy is legit. A - 10 / V - 10 / M - 6.5

Thanks to the UL!!"
,quakerray,2010-07-26T11:36Z,still cant get the subs working.never had this problem before.any one had same or got an answer
,teloycho,2010-07-26T22:41Z,"What the fuck is the problem with Boycott Ass?????
why the fuck are u jealous that he is playing movies from such small age while u old dumb ass have to watch his movies????"
,jiclar,2010-07-29T10:50Z,thanks
,JaffyJoffa1,2010-07-30T23:14Z,"V/9 A/9. To get the non english part subs to work in time with the film you can use VLC player and while the film is playing press pause then hold G until it says 'subtitle delay -57700m/s' and then the subtitles will be in time with the film, if you go too far just tap H to go back a few m/s. Hope this helps. This will also work if you want the Full English subs through the entire film."
,Krenzathal,2010-08-01T14:02Z,Great quality copy but the audio and non english subtitles are out of sync. I fixed the audio with avidemux and I thought I fixed the subs but they are in time for some parts but horribly out in others so are impossible to hardcode. The -57700ms fix does not work on that platform.
,mel_lolo23,2010-08-02T00:03Z,I got a copy much faster and in great quality at graboide.  I could not get enough seeders to get anywhere.
,pat2260,2010-08-10T05:48Z,"You know....I get so irritated with dumb asses giving such negative comments on Jayden Smith's acting.  When was the last time you saw someone of his age giving an oscar performance?  Honestly, i thought he did a great job...really.  I just can't wrap my brain around those negative comments.  Like others have said...it's just gotta be jealousy from people whom just hate themselves.  Also, WTF is up with yerisan's FAKEEEEEEE comment.....Can't he/she see by all of our other comments that this a completely legitimate torrent?   WOW!!!!  Funny stuff....anyway....thanks for the up!!!!"
,foxzen,2010-08-10T06:56Z,"Average quality!
A: 6.5
V: 6.5
Audio a bit off here n there and video is just watchable. Not sure what players other commenters used to rate this at 10, but I've tried with Media player classic (all codecs installed) and KM player and my rating remains the same

Also I'm not sure if this is the full copy of the movie. For instance, in the beginning Jackie swats a fly n picks it up in his chopsticks n Jaden says 'Thats Nasty' (this is there in the trailers as well) but that part is 'cut off'. Then, there is supposed to be a kissing scene betw Jaden n his sweetheart (as per IMDB Parents Guide) but that is also missing! Also IMDB shows this as 140 min movie but this has only 2hrs n 7 mins (ie 127 min) SO I'm not sure what else is snipped off but its definitely SNIPPED off! 
Sorry uploader but NOT Recommendable. Folks pls try other torrents. 
Peace

PS: There are other countrys fighting terrorist. Anyone heard about ISAF?"
,pro_torr,2010-08-14T12:37Z,"Hi, people. You'll have to excuse me as this is the first time I'm actually commenting on something: First of all, for you people who don't know how to write the King's English...learn. You're not cool. That being said, Jayden Smith is a decent actor. You people need to cut him some slack. He's a kid. He may not be Academy Award material right off the bat but that's to be expected. And for you people who say this is a fake torrent... Go slip in a puddle of AIDS and die."

,Dr_Science,2010-08-19T04:51Z,"@ pat2260

anna paquin won an oscar for her role in the piano at like 9, so simmer down.  Also if ya wanna talk good kid performances look at young Halley Joel Osment.  What about young Dakota Fanning?  The little girl in Atonement.

and, of course, short round/data in indiana jones/goonies."

,nark0z,2010-10-06T10:31Z,"Ignore the people that are rating this torrent A-10 V-10 because they can't rate for shit.

Personally I think it's:
A-5
V-6

Audio is a lot quieter than usual. Video resolution is small. Still watch-able. 

I've watched better DVDRip's but this does the job."
