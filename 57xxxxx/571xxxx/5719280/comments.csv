,tassadarnzl,2010-07-27T21:58Z,mmm i tryed all  keys and none worked
,SquisheeLOTUW,2010-07-29T06:59Z,"@ deathtrooper30 Yes, you can install the game without a key, but you can't play it. Also, the NFO seems to be corrupted, I can't open it. And none of these serials worked. Could it be because the update happened while I was AFK? If so, is there a way to un-update? lol"
,Saerain,2010-07-30T01:57Z,"@SquisheeLOTUW: All you need is a crack to play it. Point is, a serial's redundant."
