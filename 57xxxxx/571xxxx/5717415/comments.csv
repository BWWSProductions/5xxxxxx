-------------
there is somthing that i can't seem to figure out in HOTD if the zombies can't see and they only react to sound why they don't go after each other,
the writer must come with an explanation to this"

,AnimeFan1,2010-07-30T04:36Z,Thanks for the torrent Youssef and keep going with the series. Interesting characters and unpredictable plot make it good. Nice RIG. Don't know either why Zombies don't attack each other. Maybe they can smell one another or live flesh.
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2010-07-30T12:32Z,thx for the reply AnimeFan1

Firstly, HUGE thanks to youssef for uploading these torrents.

The answer to your zombie question is simple. 
Other zombies sound like zombies, and other zombies aren't food. 

You guys should check out the book called ""Zombie Survival Guide"" by Max Brooks. It's a like a military survival guide for Z-Day, and it covers everything.
