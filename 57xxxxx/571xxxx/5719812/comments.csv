,justcause28,2010-07-27T16:44Z,This crack is not by Liberty. Its done by Vernam7.
,TAKU0730,2010-07-27T17:01Z,"and its for campaign only, dont mess it with single player"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-27T18:18Z,"works great for now, thanks!"
,Hidden_driver,2010-07-27T21:36Z,help! how do i load champaign? i have to start it from beginning all the time! i cant find where to load it. i think there's somekind of glitch or something help please!
,TonyS1,2010-07-27T21:59Z,"ok this took me 5 fucking tries but got it... 1st I'm using an EnGB version (the collectors ED)
install it, then it updates auto. It needs to update again as well, if it doesn't do this... close the launcher and relaunch from the desktop shortcut (only use this to launch the game) if it still doesn't update, restart your pc and relaunch again. Once it's updated RUN THE GAME 1st WITH NO CRACKS APPLIED... then close it, apply the cracks and start from ""Start Campaign"" also the tutorials work... any other combination and this will fuck-up. Trust me I have been going at it for hours. BTW I have launched and relaunched the game and played briefly 4 times to verify
GOD DAMMIT what a hassle but thanx to the cracker, this is legit folks, just a pain in the ass is all :)"
,iPlay.Metallica,2010-07-27T22:12Z,"Can u play Against AI , skirismish ?"
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-28T02:57Z,no ai skirmish options sorry to say.  But at least my game saves
,D0gmeat,2010-07-28T03:25Z,"Aren't the enGB and Liberty versions both nuked as non-working? Campaign only and no game saves or loading possible...forget that it's a stolen crack, that's a scene rules issue.

So does this crack work or are we just waiting for Proper?"
,spelonkar,2010-07-28T03:58Z,"i downloaded sc2 from battlenet, followed the directions and applied this crack, been playing campaign for the last 5 hours, you have to go into the sc2 save folder, and launch your ""libertycampaignsave"" that will load sc2 up to your last autosave"
,justcause28,2010-07-28T04:04Z,"saves do wor5k. you just need to go to where the saves are at in my documents / starcraft / saves (something like that) and double click the save file to continue your game.

I dont need this crack because I have a legit copy but I know the forum from where this came from."
,HamHamHam,2010-07-28T04:35Z,Any hope of a mac crack ever coming?
,xpym,2010-07-28T23:43Z,"Sorry for a dumb question, but how do I shut down the game? (other than ctrl+alt+del thing)"
,spelonkar,2010-07-29T02:54Z,"Why would you ever want to stop playing sc2? :D i havent actually found a way other then to minimize and right click sc2 and ""close program"" or going all task manager on it"
,coolguymandude,2010-07-29T05:34Z,"thank you very much for this it worked for me i downloaded the game from blizzard and used this crack..also i read in gameinformer that this game burns your video card or something not really sure what they meant but its just a heads up to all of you,  here is what they wrote...""the game's menu screens aren't framerate-limited. This means that when there's nothing else going on, your graphics hardware renders the bejeezus out of those screens, causing nasty overheating problems. The fix is easy, requiring players to add the following lines to your ""Documents\StarCraft II\variables.txt"" file 

frameratecapglue=30
frameratecap=60


again thank you and this game is worth buying if you have money lol =)"
,nemus84,2010-07-29T14:17Z,"i can save and load with this crack, works awesome!
thanks to the cracker!"
,nemus84,2010-07-29T14:26Z,"with the this torrent:
Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty Reloaded Crack Only
save and load works! (without autosave)"
,Jayzen_Freeze,2010-07-29T18:18Z,no it does not still autosave only
,Alfredo Villanueva,2010-07-29T18:23Z,"Yes, i guess the only way to shut down is to minimize with ALT-ESC, right click and close."
,Alfredo Villanueva,2010-07-29T18:26Z,"This crack works perfectly. been playing the campaing for the last 2 days, not very impressive actually. been waiting so long for this? Ok, just download the retail game from other torrent, install, update, aply the patches like the instructions says, and everything runs smoothly!!"
,nemus84,2010-07-29T20:27Z,"@Jayzen_Freeze

with the linked torrent one can save and load manually.
if you dont belive me read the comments of the other torrent retard!

,spelonkar,2010-07-30T00:35Z,"Actually for closing the easiest way seems to just be alt+f4, i sometimes get the ""are you sure you want to quit sc2?"" option, others times it just closes it out"

,monkeydevil2,2010-09-01T22:12Z,"PLEASE HELP**
When I try the crack it updates the game again. But around 71% there is an error that states 


The patch ""pc-game-hdfiles\StarCraft II Editor.exe"" could not be applied. (MD5 mismatch: expected 0x6E21EE5A7B1D755819D09B2B7505896D, actual 0x09D1171F0E9DA1B3DA97B8BAFAEFC61A.)(PTCApply_BSDiff failed.) If this problem persists, you may be able to solve it by uninstalling and then reinstalling the game. If you are unable to correct this problem, please contact Blizzard Technical Support. (BNUpdate::PTCApply)

Please help I dunno what to do really want to play this game :P"
,aand,2010-09-03T00:41Z,"1. Install the game from the ISO. At the end DO NOT PRESS ""NEXT""!!! (press [x] to exit, so you'll bypass update)

2. Working campaign crack:
