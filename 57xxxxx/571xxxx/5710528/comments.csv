,i83,2010-08-04T23:27Z,"My apologies, I only realized after the torrent was nearly 100% seeded that S04E19 got messed up somewhere along the lines of putting this together. 

I'll create an additional torrent with the proper S04E19 as soon as I can and link it here. "
,i83,2010-08-05T18:24Z,Proper S04E19 here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5740937
,Freducken,2010-08-30T00:39Z,Are these blu-ray rips or tv rips from syfy? thanks for the awesome upload!
,mahemadmin,2010-09-03T15:07Z,Howsabout a few more seeds? This is going to take forever at this rate. been d/l for 5 weeks and now it says 3y to complete. 
,qmsyntax,2010-11-13T10:09Z,"Please seed this, my connection is so fast and yet i can only DL at 5 KB. When i finish i will see for 1 month strait at 25 MB."
,marivald,2011-02-12T02:26Z,"Incredible it is. I wonder if I'd be able to find any subs for it... Do you have anything, English or Polish?
Thanks for the torrent, I'd love higher speed, but this will have to do...
Waiting for Blood and Chrome :)"
,carbondudeoxide,2011-06-13T20:47Z,do you have anywhere else i can download this??? e.g non torrent as my computer really does not like torrents for some reason...
,tom_appleford,2011-07-17T15:04Z,Thanks so much for this - excellent work- a lot has gone into this. I have been downloading for over 4 weeks and still not finished but worth the wait - thanks again.
,Ewido,2012-06-19T21:46Z,Can this get some more seeders? At this rate it'll take me a very long time to get this and it is a very well made/organized package I would like to have it. Thank you.
