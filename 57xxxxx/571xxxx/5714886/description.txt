The Coldest DVD In The Game Is Back! And Available At MixUnit.com. This time out it's the "Sub0World" edition, helping jump off the brand new website from Sub-0 DVD Magazine, an online content provider for your hip-hop video needs. Like the Sub-0 DVDs, you can expect to find Sub-0 planted squarely in the hood with some of your favorite hip-hop stars, hood legends, strippers and adult actresses, video vixens and more.

This DVD is no different, so cop yours today from The Mix Unit. Sub-0 gives you unlimited, exclusive access to the hottest strip clubs in NYC and ATL, takes you undercover in the hood to visit some hood icons and renowned street stars, and brings you up-close-and-personal with some of hip-hop's hardest working rappers and trappers in the game, from the new jacks to the veterans.
