[T],swebarb,2010-07-27T19:25Z,"I installed the game and everything.
But when I enter the game it asks me to log into battlenet and I can't see any ""Start Campaign"" or single player button.
What I am doing wrong here? "
,TonyS1,2010-07-27T21:47Z,"ok this took me 5 fucking tries but got it... 1st I'm using an EnGB version (the collectors ED)
install it, then it updates auto. It needs to update again as well, if it doesn't do this... close the launcher and relaunch from the desktop shortcut (only use this to launch the game) if it still doesn't update, restart your pc and relaunch again. Once it's updated RUN THE GAME 1st WITH NO CRACKS APPLIED... then close it, apply the cracks and start from ""Start Campaign"" also the tutorials work... any other combination and this will fuck-up. Trust me I have been going at it for hours. BTW I have launched and relaunched the game and played briefly 4 times to verify
GOD DAMMIT what a hassle but thanx to the cracker, this is legit folks, just a pain in the ass is all :)"

,adagoduha6,2010-07-28T01:34Z,"So i was able to run the game but when i click on Star Campaign i see this""Your Starcraft 2 account doesnt have acces to the single player features!! So what?"
,electro cute,2010-07-28T01:46Z,"this ""crack"" doesn't enable saving games. there is no save game option in the menu."
,spelonkar,2010-07-28T03:52Z,"This crack works peferctly, just follow the instructions, and as far as saving goes, it auto saves during missions/after them, all you have to do is find the sc2 save folder (im on vista so mine is in documents) and click on ""libertycampaignsave"" and it will load sc2 up to your last point"
,PleaseDontBanMe,2010-07-28T07:45Z,You are my hero spelonkar thanks for that info. +rep :P
,Reflukz,2010-07-28T09:27Z,Confirmed working.  Now we can play SC2 campaign without giving any money to Kotick.  Living the dream!

,fester420,2010-07-28T17:35Z,"If you are getting this error:

The file ""fileset.base\Mods\Core.SC2Mod\Index.SC2Locale"" in archive """" could not be opened, 
because an error 2 occurred. If this problem persists, please contact Blizzard Technical Support. 
(MPQFile::OpenFromArchive)

follow these steps (I use bitcomet, might be different for you)
1. rename the file ""Installer Tome 1.MPQE"" to ""Installer Tome 1.Mpqe.bc!""
2. download this torrent but choose download later ""SC2-WingsOfLiberty-enGB-Installer""
3. move the renamed file to source destination of new download, overwrite
4. the download will hash check and install the missing 20MB from the file

This will prevent people from having to redownload a full version and save a lot of time"

Reading the Blizzard forums is like watching a train wreck.  It is exactly what you'd expect from a series of decisions that places profit first.  No customer service, refusal to accommodate obvious user issues like 'region selection' errors, a release before BNET is ready, and comically, obviously duplicitous PR lackeys that probably aren't getting paid enough for the amount of lies they're telling.

Then you have the game itself, one campaign with basically one nonsensical plot development, built within a game that is nothing more than a remake of an existing title.  I need not repeat the privacy issues, monetization of community effort, and the quips of the CEO.

For the first time in a long while, I feel piracy means something, and I am proud rather than ambivalent to be a part of it."

,overwhelming12,2010-10-31T13:18Z,"Some people especially Halibuty who complains that SC2 is full of crap and doesn't deserve to be paid obviously never tried the game itself. The legit version, which deserves to be paid for its epic customer service and effort put into the gameplay are just indescribably awesome that almost makes CnC nothing compared to SC2. Multiplayer is especially great. No matter how much you suck and all that, you somehow still get to have fun with it (like me) and the custom maps are extremely good and fun (There is DOTA). They patched this game tons of times and Blizzard is still listening and still balancing the game (Which I think its balanced enough). This game is definitely worth paying and its number of hours of gameplay its great (since its main focus is multiplayer). Oh and btw Halibuty, Starcraft 2 is kind of impossible to crack MP since its log on from start screen and of course, if you've only played it vs AI or single player, you missed the 80% of the game.

,jeffabe3,2010-12-29T05:44Z,"Finally found the best crack here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5971047/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_v1.1.3_Update-RazorDOX-[tracker.BT
No need for other programs like the SC2allinone.
Fully working Campaign and Skirmish modes on the game itself plus the latest patches(1.1.3).


To everyone having problems this is how i did it:
1. Install any fresh copy of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty (Fresh install to remove all the previous cracks).
2. After installing stop the game from updating.
3. Run SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch from the download.
4. Run Keygen as Administrator. (THIS IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE GUEST ACCOUNT WORKING!)
To run as admin on XP simply shift+double click.
Click OK then QUIT.
5. Run sc2_copy.
6. To play the game, use the SC2Switcher.exe located at the install folder starcraftII>support to prevent the game from updating.


Windows XP/7
Starcraft II enGB version, not tested on enUS."
