This book will guide you, step by step, through using the Starter Kit to learn about the Arduino hardware, software and general electronics theory. Through the use of electronic projects we will take you from the level of complete beginner through to having an intermediate set of skills in using the Arduino.

The purpose of this book and the kit is to give you a gentle introduction to the Arduino, electronics and programming in C and to set you up with the necessary skills needed to progress beyond the book and the kit into the world of the Arduino and microcontroller electronics.

The booklet has been written presuming that you have no prior knowledge of electronics, the Arduino hardware, software environment or of computer programming. At no time will we get too deep into electronics or programming in C. There are many other resources available for free that will enable you to learn a lot more
