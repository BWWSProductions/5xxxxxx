[V],room101bellboy,2010-08-01T00:09Z,"@humpamidget1: The torrent is flawless, you are bad. 

Use VLC (videolan.org) or install the right codecs.

If at all possible, my wife has been asking me for Fool's Gold BluRay with Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson and Donald Sutherland.  I've looked for other downloads , not many to choose from, but they are all too large for my PS3 to use.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!!  Thanks Again!!"
