The video is pretty washed out and fuzzy, hard to recognize people faces, but you can at least see they are people. The audio is pretty tinny and I can't understand what they are saying. I use high-end stereo loudspeakers, so bad sound sounds real bad. Delete time for me, I think I'll go to the IMAX and drop $17.50 to see the real thing."

It's watchable but if you haven't seen yet watch it in the theatre first!"
[V],Mbb15,2010-07-27T22:28Z,"@billyboy999

you're an completely idiot, I did not upload this movie, this movie is just worth the money to see in the cinema, im in the cinema ones in a decade? so this is just an awesome movie and you ""billyboy999"" did you ever do anything for the community? no so STFU 

my advice is, 

go watch it in the cinema or wait for an 1080p version and stream is to your 2 meter big TV"
[V],Mbb15,2010-07-27T23:05Z,"still good work raymondhome, dont get me worng. Only its my freedom of speech to say that you need to watch this movie in the cinema to get the ultimate experience"
,boudhayan,2010-07-28T02:39Z,well said Mbb15
,michaelrwatson,2010-07-28T03:37Z,"WOW, the audio sounds like it was passed through a snake's-ass filter or something, and the video has flicker. Unwatchable unless you want to ruin the movie, but thanx for the effort. "
,bej1223,2010-07-28T04:33Z,"first off.... gj contributing to the community.
second....you noticed this is a cam version so its not the best version

if you really want the ultimate experience, watch it in the theater or wait a for a dvdrip"

I think Mbb15's point is this; ""Stop BITCHING"" leave reviews about the quality, but stop being ciritical of the people who made all your free software, porn, music & movies **FREE** 

Of course there will be copies that are not DvD quality, but this service isn't exactly like Supply & Demand you know, if people like Raymond stopped doing what he was doing, then there wouldn't be shit to download and everyone with photoshop CS5 would have paid $800 for it.

This comment is more so directed to all the ""Bitchers"". Stop bitching about the quality of a movie that wasout 11 days before uploaded.

With that being said where the fuck is a nice quality of Jonah Hex? :) I think it's nearing time for a DvDScr or R5... *Mouth drooling*

Thanks for the up Ray, you are the man!! And you are apreciated."

,sooner4life82,2010-07-29T14:54Z,"Sample looked pretty good, audio isn't quite the same quality as other movies raymondhome has put out, gonna d/l movie to see if its just the sample or if that's the way the movie actually sounds. Other than that the movie looks just like a raymondhome pirated movie & can't complain since its free anyways."
,Dragonryder1,2010-07-29T18:06Z,"You know Im tired of people bitching and complaining about the downloads.. ohh their not good enough, they suck. don't d/l. I personally enjoy getting the movies.. sometimes they aren't the greatest. but when you have 5 kids and are helping raise 11 grandkids... well u get my picture. NO MONEY TO SEE MOVIES>>>.... soooo if you don't like what you see here.. GO TO THE FUCKING MOVIES>>>>>>> GODDAMN WHINERS AND COMPLAINERS>>>>>>>>>>> btw.. th for the d/ raymondhome..... not one of your better ones but still very watchable."
