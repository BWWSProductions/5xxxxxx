Plot:
When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides
to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he
learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of
driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for the precious
material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal
surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military
unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to
infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity. While Jake
begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the
beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless
extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in
an epic battle for the fate of Pandora.

Uploader note:
English Subtitles for NAVI parts are hardcoded. This version is another lowbitrate experiment.
eBDRIP - Enhanced Bluray Disk Rip means the release where encoder intentionally
enhance the quality of the source to have quality better than Bluray itself.

Regards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew.
Also big thank you to Filix

1. UNFINISHED movies HAVE synchro problemms. This is the nature of highly
commpressed content. Also there seems to be the problemm with Haali Media
Splitter. If you are using Media Player Classic please make sure you have
enabled INTERNAL FILTER for MP4.
2. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you actually seen it. If you HAVE LIKED this
release tell others about it. If you dont tell it too but dont forget to tell
why, so I could learn from your opinion providing you something better in the
future .
3. I can confirm the xbox360 will play it through WINDOWS media center extender.
Read this forum http://www.avforums.com/forums/streamers-network-media-players/1107552-what-xbox-360-like-media-extender.html
4. My releases are different than anybody else, so they SHOULD NOT be compared to
any existing scene rules. I belive if there are different rules for Telecine
and for DVDRip there can be also different rule for FASM QEBS releases. If the
scene will overregulate itself, prohibiting new ideas to come it will soon
become like our goverments.
5. If you like the movie, gratitude the creators by going to cinema, buying
Bluray/DVD or any other possible way.
6. The movies can be directly streamable throught WWW, by Adobe Flash Player
version 9 or higher.
7. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. If you write something
directly in assembler it is usually much faster and takes much less size,
than the same thing written in C, Java etc... It also means FAchman SoofMan
- founders of FASM
8. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is the h264 commpression method
optimised directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved
, each revision bringing quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard
x264 encoding is explained by the same reason XVID encodes are better than
DIVX3.
9. FASM recommends IMGBURN for burning those files into DVD.
10.Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source
(Bluray Rip) should also work with this release.
