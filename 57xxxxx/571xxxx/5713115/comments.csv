,kimkim12313,2010-08-05T14:24Z,"Download and install goes fine but i got a problem in patch. When i open the update it says:
The Thing is not the expected version (US build 9 -american) - Patching it will probably mess it up - Try anyway ?

When i pressed yes it says failed to rename file. and 3 dos windows flashed and closed. I put the crack and when i opened the game it showed a runtime error! following the Application (C:\Windows\TheThing.exe)
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please Contact the application's support team for more information.

Please help i relaly want to play this game."

,nocaps,2010-11-22T19:04Z,"Same problem as kimkim. Patches downloaded from Fileplanet for Euro-Non German version of the game also give the same problem. And Razor crack (not from this torrent) crashes the game at start.

Any ideas? Win XP Home SP-3."
,nocaps,2010-11-23T17:14Z,"Okies!

I did not apply the Patch, but only copy-pasted the crack, overwriting the original game exe -  ""TheThing.exe"" - in the /bin folder, with the cracked exe included in this torrent and the game works now :)

Enjoy."
