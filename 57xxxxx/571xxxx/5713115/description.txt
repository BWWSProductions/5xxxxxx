THE THING PC ISO 

Its a old game but worth playing - with xcellent graphics

Another game based on a film, but The Thing manages to provide a violent diversion that's faithful to John Carpenter's 1982 flick. 
Black Label Games' third-person adventure starts where the movie leaves off. A team of American scientists residing in the Antarctic are unwittingly exposed to an alien creature that lives in any living organism. After the creature kills off most of the scientists, the remaining two men decide to blow up the entire camp to keep wipe it out completely. Players take on the role of a specialist Search and Rescue leader who's been sent to uncover the mysterious deaths of the previous US team. Players explore the destroyed station and fend of creatures while facing several dynamics, such as handling the freezing cold and a trust/fear system.
