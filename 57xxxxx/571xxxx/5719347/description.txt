Canadian actress Susan Clark got her professional 
acting start early in 1967 when she was 26.

This sedate Virginian episode was the place in the 
title role of "Melanie", a love story for Trampas.

Overall it's well-done but the ending was ridiculous.

The other guest stars are Victor Jory as her father,
an old friend of John Grainger's.....and in a small
supporting role child actor Clint Howard, the 
buck-toothed younger brother of Ron Howard.
