I've got that one on 7"" somewhere. You dig up the most amazing stuff."
,nonsentence,2010-07-27T07:14Z,Thank you for this wonderful music.  I really appreciate it!
,nonsentence,2010-07-27T07:16Z,"I gave my ex-wife a burned copy of your most recent new wave hits (volume 49) and she said, ""that torrent guy sure knows what he is doing.""  I have every single album you have ever uploaded and am in the process of creating a torrent server on freebsd.  I will keep you posted.  =)"
[V],80zforever,2010-07-27T19:14Z,"nonsentence, that sounds great. Anything that can keep this 80s library for the others is highly appreciated.  "
,nonsentence,2010-08-22T05:16Z,"Hi, I have built a linux server out of an old dual Pentium III motherboard with 4GB of memory and a 2TB external hard drive.  I intend on using this machine as my torrent server.  Is it enough for me to download a tracker for each mix/album and then point it to where they are saved?  I just realized that I took the individual albums out of their collection folders and have them listed separately.  Do I need to put them back in their collection folders?  "
[V],80zforever,2010-08-23T08:13Z,"nonsentence, if you have changed the structure of the torrent, when re-loaded it would be missing some files/folders. you have to preserve the structure/convert it to how it is in the original torrent."
,nonsentence,2010-08-23T16:38Z,Thank you.  I will make sure that is the case before I re-seed.

Re. your torrent ""4 Rare 80s Albums [Part 78]"" at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5087351/4_Rare_80s_Albums_[Part_78]

Can you please tell me the source of the BB Gabor?
The artwork looks like a CD release, but I hear clicks and pops on the tracks which sounds more like a vinyl rip.

Thanks. "
[V],80zforever,2010-08-29T00:25Z,"mapletor, it's from vinyl. The album however was released along with his 2nd lp on one CD called ""And the Girls of the Future An Anthology"" which is a bit hard to find and fetches crazy prices when sold on ebay. cheers"
,mapletor,2010-08-29T01:48Z,Interesting. I didn't know people would pay high prices for BB Gabor. Thanks.
[V],80zforever,2010-08-29T04:27Z,"I don't think that many people know him. It's just the collectors that pay high prices for these items. I am happy with the vinyl rip that's available, especially the second lp is not as good as the first."
,smurphyzeke,2011-03-05T03:51Z,Thanks
