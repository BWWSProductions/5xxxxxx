,Sekiro,2010-07-27T07:42Z,"I always find it that people who only comment on various films in these pages are retarded... However, I feel the need to make such a statement myself on behalf of all film lovers;

THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST FILM OF THE YEAR! 

This is a serious candicate to the worst film of the millenium. Period.

I had my hopes up high seeing that the cast is somewhat awesome. Man were I in for a surprise. Thank ""someone"" for not having paid anything but my precious time to watch it."

,XXFLOPPYXX,2010-07-30T04:02Z,GREAT RIP BUT THE MOVIE SUCKS BAD
,BoomyBoom,2010-07-30T15:18Z,"I agree. Great rip but terrible movie. It's too hard to follow....It just seems like a garbled nonsensical version of the first Resident Evil movie, with some really inventive jokes and some B-rated violence. I would say if you value your time on Earth, don't waste any of it watching this garbage. I want my 82min back..."
,kristo_th,2010-07-30T18:12Z,perfect upload - thank - pitty the movie is so dump ... :)

,starbar222,2010-08-06T07:37Z,Good upload but movie stink's made it threw only half before it bore me to death 
,necrocide,2010-08-08T11:06Z,"Ok the quality is good - A-9 V-9. But this movie IS A FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT. I read the reviews and thought sweet, plotless but lots of mindless violence so I should be mildy entertained for a bit. I was wrong, very wrong. Bullshit fake looking cut - away Z grade gore. I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. Twilight would be better then this piece of pig anus pus. (Have not seen - Never will, I am not a mac user :) Recommend or download for someone you absolutely hate. OMFG I could write a book about how shit this 'movie' is, but just thinking about it is making me sick."

if you dont like the movie than don't post a comment and stop wining. maybe your taste of a good movie is a bit different then those of other people. "
,spiderr,2010-08-11T06:26Z,"This movie is like trying to watch a spy/Office Space version of Children's Hospital. Fucking horrible. Quality good, movie baaaaaaaaaaad!"

Great upload, thanks. The movie is ok"
,dlarrym1111,2010-10-10T07:32Z,"@ necrocide: I get it, you were not fond of the movie. I may even agree that the plot was def. bizarre??? What is this mean?

(Have not seen - Never will, I am not a mac user :)

If you hate macs or hate PC's or whatever is fine by me, just curious, what do you mean?? truly confused. You "" Have not seen (seen what) - Never will (what won't you never do??), I am not a mac user :) Ok, your not a mac user? However, Explain in what way does your opinion about mac users factor into the preceding lines?? Have not seen something (you don't say what you haven't seen, you also say you will never do something WHAT will you NEVER do???)  Seriously, no one reading your comment can make sense of your ignorant use of english. . . Please re-state that portion of your comment and explain what you are talking about.  I can tell you may not have made it past 4th grade so it may not be something you can explain in a way that adults understand. Did you make sure your mommy knows your online? You may have trouble getting in touch with your mommy, This is because Right now, My flaccid floppy cock is in her mouth and intermittently bouncing off her forehead and then returning to her mouth. Such is life! =) "
,TheSourMango,2010-12-14T15:26Z,"Thanks goes out to the uploader!

This movie is cool. It's a blend of twisted madness and fun at the same time. Really enjoyed it."
,ceb929,2011-01-14T21:24Z,"@dlarrym1111

_why would u single him out when EVERYONE said it sucked? o_O fukn idiot...i wasss gonna watch it but from the sound of it its not worth it so eh.."
,Fallerup,2011-04-11T17:38Z,"lol... necrocide is someone that takes movies way too seriously. So the movie sucked, why complain? You got it for free. ok, you wasted maybe an hour downloading it (depending on the speed), big deal! I like senseless violence on screen. so I'm going to download it. However, I must admit, I wanna watch it mostly because of Emilie De Raven :P

Ray usually delivers good quality, hence why I pick this download over others. "
