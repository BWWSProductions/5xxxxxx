Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is the long-time confidant of Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney), an Irish gangster political boss who runs his Prohibition-era city. When Leo's Italian rival Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) announces his intentions to kill the crooked bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro), Leo goes against Tom's advice and extends his protection to Bernie. Bernie is the brother of Verna Bernbaum (Marcia Gay Harden), an opportunistic gun moll who shares a longtime relationship with Leo as well as a secret affair with Tom. Leo goes to war with Caspar as a consequence.
