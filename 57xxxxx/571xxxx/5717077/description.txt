Montgomery Gentry is an American country music  duo composed of vocalists Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry. The two began performing in the 1990s as part of a band which also included Eddie's Montgomery's brother, John Michael Montgomery, who left for a solo career in the early 1990s.

Signed in 1999 to Columbia Records, the duo released its debut album Tattoos & Scars that year. They have since recorded five more studio albums: Carrying On (2001), My Town (2002), You Do Your Thing (2004), Some People Change (2006), and Back When I Knew It All (2008) as well as a Greatest Hits package. These albums have produced more than twenty chart singles for the duo on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including the Number One hits "If You Ever Stop Loving Me", "Something to Be Proud Of", "Lucky Man", "Back When I Knew It All" and "Roll with Me" and ten more Top Ten hits.

The duo released "Oughta Be More Songs About That" on November 30, 2009 which debuted at #59 on the Hot Country Songs  chart for the week of November 21, 2009. The song peaked at #40 on the Hot Country Songs chart in late January 2010, becoming their lowest charting single to date. A second single from the album, "While You're Still Young", was released in April 2010.

Eddie Montgomery and his brother John Michael lived in Garrard County, Kentucky. Before the duo's formation, Eddie and Troy sang together with John Michael in a band called Early Tymz. But before the band, Eddie worked at the Danville Bowl-a-rama lanes owned by David and Rose Mahan. In the early 1990s, John Michael left the group and started a solo career. Eddie and Troy, the remaining members of the group, then went through several name changes before they decided to call themselves Montgomery Gentry. In 1994, Gentry won the Jim Beam National Talent Contest and he began to open for acts such as Patty Loveless, Tracy Byrd, and Joey Edgerly. Gentry was unable to find a solo record deal, so he teamed up with Eddie once again to form the duo Montgomery Gentry, which signed to Columbia Records Nashville in 1999.
