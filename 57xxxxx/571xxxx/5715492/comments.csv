,tooorment,2010-09-03T12:11Z,"Wow, thanks so much for this, have been waiting for it for ages. The quality is good, I don't mind the 'SAMPLE' text in the corner. However, the subtitles that come with this .mkv are terrible, so you should really download the one in stygzy's link."
,m3tal_fr3ak,2010-10-31T13:23Z,Thanx for the upload ~
,binary.tobis,2011-06-11T03:07Z,"I couldn't fix the subtitles being misstimed even with switching players and what subtitle file I used. But I figured out how to fix it in VLC, just use the G and H hotkeys to change the subtitle delay."
,Smrth,2011-10-08T23:08Z,"thanks for torrent, but worst translation i didnt saw..."
,touji_ryuuzaki,2012-01-30T03:25Z,"V-4/5
A-5/5
M-5/5

Only prob is there's a water mark saying ""SAMPLE"" on the top left corner of the screen. Must be due to the video converter that they used but if you can get past that, it's worth the DL"
