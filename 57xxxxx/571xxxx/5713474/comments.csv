,mikaru86,2010-07-24T18:48Z,"since it may take a bit longer for a crack, i recomend you also check out the behind the scenes DVD rip (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5713613/StarCraft_II_-_Wings_of_Liberty_-_Behind_the_Scenes).
it even seems to include all the ingame cinematics (in addition to the making of), if you REALLY can't wait any longer ;)"
