...................................NFO:.................................................The.Biography.Channel.Woody.Harrelson.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

Portrait of the actor who was plucked from obscurity and 
found stardom on the hit TV sitcom Cheers. Harrelson became 
a violent youth when his father was sent to jail. He started 
acting in high school, and nailed the audition for Cheers 
after hearing about the casting call from a friend. He went 
on to star in White Men Can't Jump and such controversial 
movies as Natural Born Killers and The People vs. Larry Flynt. 
Harrelson also became a vegan, took up yoga, and became an 
activist--he was arrested for climbing the Golden Gate Bridge 
in an effort to protect California's redwoods.
