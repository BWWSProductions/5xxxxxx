von Bingen - Heavenly Revelations [c12](Naxos)[MP3][twistle]

Hildegard von Bingen (1098 - 1179) 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_von_bingen

Music written by a twelfth-century German saint.  This is a CD of (mainly female) monophonic chant, sung by a choir that specialised in Early Music, but done in a manner quite diffrent to the majority of such CDs.  So often chant sounds samey or bland or rhythmically rigid, but not this.  It is easilly one of those recordings that I listen to most - typically in the background at low volume, when working late at night.  

This CD is already available as a FLAC torrent elsewhere, but I am uploading my own CD rip of this into MP3 as 128K is a sufficient bitrate for the simplicity of the music: FLAC is overkill, and hopefully a smaller torrent will be better-seeded :)
