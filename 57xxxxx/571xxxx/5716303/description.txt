The longly missed supersonic aircraft HAS ARRIVED!

Coming in with over 10,000lbs of thrust, this old thing might just blow you away... FOR MILES AND HOURS OF FUN!!!



This aircraft, in my opinion is great, but not for the price. you'd swear they are copying from PMDG or Level-D with all the addons.

the aircraft is EXACTLY HOW YOU WOULD USE IT IN REAL LIFE: Inertial Navigation System (INS) is fully working, and is the ONLY WAY to get the aircraft to fly you to your destination automatically...  better know your co-ordinates :P

this installs the V1.02 patch over the top of the V1.00 during the install, so you don't have to go and download the patch from a link you can't find :P




I FOUND THIS TORRENT ON ISO HUNT!!! NOT MY OWN WORK!!! It Uses the D-Crack TO CRACK THE INSTALLATION!!! 


Found it here: 


NO KEY IS NEEDED FOR THE INSTALL.

All Credit to the Makers of D-CRACK!!

(apart from credit for me uploading it to TPB)
