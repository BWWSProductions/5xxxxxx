100% working"
,MajorWales,2011-07-22T18:15Z,"This does work, but you do not know how to use bat files... run the bat file first, then it will install using the bin file and exe.

This is taken from d-crack's megapack, just seperated from the other addons for FSX. it includes the .bin file because it contains all the files required to install the concorde. it is not like another concorde which is the 1.00 version, which this is the 1.02 version. the exe is meant to use the 1.00 bin file, but the bat file makes it use the 1.02 bin file. the torrent has nothing to do with the exe wanting the 1.00 bin file, its because your natural instinct is to run the exe file. RUN THE BAT FILE FIRST!! IT WILL THEN INSTALL! 

NOTE: if your antivirus says it has a virus, it does not. it is simply the way d-crack cracked the installer. you can check his megapack and what he says in the cdescription."
