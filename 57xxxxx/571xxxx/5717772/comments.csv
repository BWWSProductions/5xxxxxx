like, languages and subtitles, resolution, etc?

pretty sure most people come to download torrents, not read about your pc :p

thanks for the upload though."
,koudepinda,2010-12-05T22:06Z,"someone knows what language its dubbed? prefer japanese, english dubs mostly sound awkward. and is it subbed? "

,toma1981,2011-02-19T08:19Z,"Ok what do I need to play these?

Usually with .mkv files I use windows media player classic or VLC but neither are working for this... "
,johndillinger1932,2011-03-02T21:54Z,most of the time i prefer subbed..but gits is one of the few where the eng dub is done very well...trigun and soul eater are also quiet good dubbed
,bugysk,2011-05-15T12:38Z,"first movie is overdubbed english on japan so it sounds pretty awful + hardcoded english subs. fuk that uploader, may your brain realise one day that if you are ""helping"" someone there are more important things than jerking off your ego on specifications of some stupid material thing...

peace with such people, they just don't realise what is important and they ARE going to learn it in this life, so wish them only the best..."
