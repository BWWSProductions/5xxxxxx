Music : Classical : MP3/Variable


The Bay Area's acclaimed 12-man vocal ensemble celebrates the release of their 27th recording, collaborating with the dynamic instrument ensemble Capriccio Stravagante, directed by Skip Sempe.

Henry Purcell (1659-95), son of a Royal musician, wrote beautiful, expressive church music, from the ecstatic to the sublime. Eight songs, from a lovely 8-minute opening cut, 'Rejoice in the Lord alway' and the jubilant 'I was glad,' written for James II's coronation, to the short, deeply moving 'Hear My Prayer, O Lord' and the 16-minute final cut, 'My heart is inditing,' Purcell's grandest composition for the church.

The perfect accompaniment of Capriccio fits perfectly with Chanticleer's flawless singing. 'Evening' is inspirational and pleasing on many levels.


Enjoy and Seed!!
