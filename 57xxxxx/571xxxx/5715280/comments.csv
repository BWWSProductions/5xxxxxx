,vitdx,2010-07-25T15:55Z,It hasn't officially been released yet. No it's not an HDTV rip.
,Vidpro007,2010-07-25T17:36Z,"Uhhhhhhhhhh, OK, then what is the source???????????? Thanks for the up."
,Vidpro007,2010-07-25T17:37Z,"Uhhhhhhhhh, OK, then what is the source.  Thanks for the up :)"
,Dirty_Joe_Dirt,2010-07-25T22:36Z,"The cropping is wrong.

Thanks, but I'll wait for a proper rip.  Plus, I would like a DTS audio track, but that's just me being picky."
,FrostyD,2010-07-28T07:36Z,"If it's really 1920x1080, then the source can't be from bluray."
,kechiguy,2010-08-21T04:51Z,"Thanks a million, Anonymous--crystal clear quality of a great movie. I'll keep seeding to show my thanks!"
,gcrdude,2010-09-11T22:52Z,Does this include the scenes that are cencored in HDTV rips? (Blood and face-shooting)
,hauntnut,2010-12-16T05:07Z,"LOL @ FrostyD. You idiot, what do you think Blu-Ray is, if not 1920x1080p? "
,ro4eva,2010-12-28T16:02Z,Please seed guys.  I will also seed once I'm finished downloading.

[T],FatFreddy69,2011-01-15T13:14Z,"this ""Anonymous uploader"" is a liar, this shity quality HDTVRip was never ripped from Blue-ray. 
that's why he uploaded it anonymously. "
,ro4eva,2011-02-03T17:42Z,"This is the best version of this film in terms of video and audio quality that I've been able to find.

Yes it is ripped from HDTV.  At least it's 1080p.  It actually looks quite good but don't expect the video quality to be on par with (for example) Avatar on BluRay.

V - 8
A - 8

Thanks for the upload."
,Cathartik,2011-06-19T17:37Z,This one really sucks! I'll wait for the real stuff.
,Mangachaos,2011-11-25T16:05Z,"I have no idea what type of graphics I´m now downloading, but at least it´s probably going to be an alright dvd version since that´s what I´m going to use it for. Yeah, I´ll use my AVS converter and make it into a dvd to see if it´s quality is at least good for that... I may return for the results.

In the meantime I´ll seed a bit as well."
,Mangachaos,2011-11-25T17:47Z,"Seems pretty alright to me... there IS something different with the graphics but to use this as it is as dvd is not recommended. I have no idea how a bluray movie looks like,  but this one is really stretched out and is probably too much edited. 

You can still watch it with the classic media player though and if the wide image disturbs you, use the zoom & pan option."
,Mangachaos,2011-11-25T18:55Z,"Ah, I meant the Pan&Scan option.. my bad...>_"
