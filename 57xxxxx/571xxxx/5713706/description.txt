La bohÃ¨me is an opera in four acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, based on ScÃ¨nes de la vie de bohÃ¨me by Henri Murger.[1] The world premiere performance of La bohÃ¨me was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio[2] and conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini. Since then La bohÃ¨me  has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas internationally. According to Opera America, it is the second most frequently performed opera in the United States,[3] just behind another Puccini opera, Madama Butterfly. In 1946, fifty years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was eventually released on records and on Compact Disc. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor (see Recordings below).
