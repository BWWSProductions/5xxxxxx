NOTES

Brennan_Heart-Album_Sampler_5-(MYD001)-WEB-2010-BPM
At the time BPM pred this, 192 kbps indeed was the best available source.

However, looking at past releases, it is known that this kind of stuff WILL ALWAYS be released in 320! These kinds of cases have occurred more often. Besides, webshop's goods aren't always synchronized with eachother. 

So there was a fat chance for this to be released in 320.
And guess what, it indeed happened.

Unfortunately due to rule 1.2 we're not allowed to proper it.
So enjoy this release as it should be, as an internal.
