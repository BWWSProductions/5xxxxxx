Afghan War Diary, 2004-2010

25th July 2010 5:00 PM EST WikiLeaks released a document set called the Afghan War Diary (AWD), an extraordinary compendium of over 91,000 reports covering the war in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2010.

The reports, while written by soldiers and intelligence officers mainly describing lethal military actions involving the United States military, also include intelligence information, reports of meetings with political figures, and related detail.

The reports cover most units from the US Army with the exception of most US Special Forces' activities. The reports do not generally cover top-secret operations or European and other ISAF Forces operations.

The documents reveal the squalor" of war, uncovering how many relatively small incidents have added up to huge numbers of dead civilians.

15,000 additional reports will be released, with occasional redactions, as the security situation in Afghanistan permits.
