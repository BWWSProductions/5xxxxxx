Release Notes:
Tagged this TC, due to being more likely being tc than any other source. Quite alot of ghosting, on source also.
lowered the contrast, tried to take the white spots away. tweaked the colors throughout, lowering some of that
horrid yellow, and giving some red and blue. Done some other bits also. Came out way bigger than expected, but
looks pretty good to me. Sorry on delay, some of us have work. 480p Encode will follow a bit later, along with
Sourcerers apprentice, and splice within next day or so. if anyone has any other audio for splice please get in 
touch. Thanks
