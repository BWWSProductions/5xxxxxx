Music: Classical : MP3/Variable


Carmina Burana is arguably one of the best pieces of music written for choir. Its many pieces cover a huge variety of styles and textures, and the rousing theme, "O Fortuna" has to be one of the most gripping and well-known themes around, used commonly to accompany scenes of horror and terror in TV and film. It is an outstanding piece from a composer who is perhaps less well-known than he should be. The piece is sung in Latin, with occasional German passages, which is probably just as well, as an English version would merit an "18" certificate! (I have it under good authority that the lyrics are very crude indeed) The piece can be dark and harrowing, yet in other sections cheerful and frivolous, and I believe it would be hard to find such an amazing variety of music on one CD. Brilliant.
