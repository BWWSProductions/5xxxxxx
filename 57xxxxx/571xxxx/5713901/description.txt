PrisM NOTES:
Right ... where to start on this, encoded the video brightening it up, tweaking the colours changing the blue quite heavily, increasing red and giving it overall some color. tweaked the contrast hue and some other bit.

Audio: well ... this took a LONG time to sync, alot of cuts in the audio to get it synced, it was going out of sync every 7 seconds, then we got it 90% synced and then the program crashes, so hard to start over :(

anyway the r5 is like a different cut of the film, example Theater showed normal version where as r5 is Uncut, because some scenes differ from the cam, anyway theirs audio missing in parts, nothing we can do about this as we have no
other audio. But this was a hard damn sync! So their maybe still some spots where go oos but it will come back.

Thanks to our good guy in PrisM l0ck for his hard work on syncing the monster.

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
