With an abundance of Promise Ring rip-off bands crawling out from under every suburban nook and cranny, one can't help but suffer from poppy-emo overkill and pray that something else will come up and shift the indie genre into a completely different direction. But then there are bands like A New Found Glory who pull out all the right hooks and harmonies that the hope of bands maintaining a "energetic, sensitive, and happy" tone will remain. A New Found Glory are all about reminiscing about the days of walking to the beach, holding hands with a loved one while loudly singing Michael Jackson's "Thriller." They're all about making mix tapes and anonymously sending it to that special someone. But they're also about trying to pick up the pieces of a shattered relationship by writing a song about it. Also making the moments on Nothing Gold Can Stay is that it doesn't cross that line where you want to scream into the stereo "get over it!" Instead, you just sit back, listen, and relate to their heartfelt days of love lost and found.
