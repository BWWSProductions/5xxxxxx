If you live for the thrill of the deathmatch, download the third installment of the first-person shooter, designed with multiplaying in mind. Quake III: Arena puts you back in the darkened otherworldly corridors, where AI enemies prepare you for the more dangerous carbon-based adversaries found online.

In single-player mode, Quake III Arena is split into six tiers of four arenas each. In order to progress to the next tier, you have to defeat your adversaries in all four arenas. Each of the bots has a distinctive style of fighting, which you'll get to know soon enough. When you've tired of blowing away artificially intelligent creatures, try your hand on enemies with real brains. Enhanced multiplayer features make it possible to play against opponents on the Internet even with a 56K dial-up connection. So grab your shotgun, plasma gun, rocket launchers, and whatever else you can get your hands on, and schedule your hot tub appointment in advance.
