[T],bulletzz74,2010-07-27T08:04Z,wtf dlarrym ? ?_?
,xiIix,2010-07-31T03:28Z,"dlarrym, you're a fucking idiot.First of all, you don't mean upload, you mean download. Second of all, this is listed under PC games. So one would deduce that it's for the fucking PC don't you think? Moreover, you can run windows on a mac using bootcamp, but then again, with your blazing hot I.Q., I'm sure you already knew that right? Jesus christ, when are these fucking chodes going to stop coming onto this website and posting ridiculously stupid shit like this? It's 183 fucking megabytes. It's not even that big, and you're all like ""woah woah woah! what's this for? because man, before I spend ALL THAT TIME downloading, I better know what it's for!"".

NEWS FLASH: NOBODY GIVES A SHIT WHETHER YOU DOWNLOAD IT OR NOT!"
