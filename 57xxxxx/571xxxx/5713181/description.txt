Deathmate was billed as the biggest crossover ever, bringing together the Valiant and Image universes. Sadly the companies did not take one another's styles into account. Valiant was extremely focused on scheduling, with events taking place in real time, whereas Image frequently went off schedule. The outcome set off a chain of events that many blame for the Comic Crash of the mid-90's and the fall of Valiant. The series is rather unique in that the bulk of the story takes place in four books which are named for colors rather then numbered. The story begins with Deathmate Prologue, followed by the four colors which can be read in any order. The story is then concluded in the Deathmate Epilogue bookend. Also included are Green and Orange, two mini-issues which serve as prequels to Yellow.
