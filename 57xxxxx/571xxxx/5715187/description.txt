NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Karate Kid 2010

Source used was a dvd5 that had a full set of english subs added ....there wasn't any grp tag so ,thanks to whoever
Now the source quailty.....was badly interlace and colouring off and was also not very sharp.Audio was nice and seemed
to be insync.
Work done.....well firstly we took the english.srt file and reomove 100's of lines that wasn't needed and left those that was and resaved it.
Then we made a small script to crop,resize,white balance,rgb eq,sharpness,brightness,contrast and a smoother and drop it into vdub.
Now we've noticed through out the film the colouring changes.....sometimes gets a tint of green come and go....nothing major though.
The audio we jusr remuxed the original AC3 audio track back to it.

Yes we know there are loads of encodes already and we wasn't going to do this but were asked by several users and once we got the dvd5,we thought
sod it and did one

Anyway enjoy,yet another remake


FLAWL3SS,ViSiON,FUSiON,Rx,SecretMyth,BirdFlu,ELEKTRI4KA and Autotron
And to all the other p2p grps past and present
