I download almost 90% of your collection and let me tell you, like the rest, this one is by all means a hot one!

Thanks!"

1970s  ""Old Dead""   FLAC.  this is truly amazing.
Personally i never liked post Shake down Street Dead. at that time Jerry was doing a lot of drugs , the shows sucked and only 16 years later did I see the Dead again, the June 24, 25 sows at RFK were execellent,   RIP Jerry"
