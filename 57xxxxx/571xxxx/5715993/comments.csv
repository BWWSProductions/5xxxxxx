,MGRL,2010-08-09T01:36Z,"So if I download this, will I try viewing it and get told I need XPlayer to view it?  Downloaded another version from this place try to see it and get told I have to download a player from a site.  The site tells me to trust them that there is no virus or anyting like that. Yeah, trust a fracking site that doesn't tell you ahead of time.  So. Can VLC or Media player view it?"
,pache666,2010-08-11T02:07Z,"Alright at least Johnnyrep's admitting he's a THIEF

,neumical,2010-08-24T18:54Z,"FAKE! ""You must have Xvid to view"""
,neumical,2010-08-24T18:56Z,"oops sorry commented on wrong torrent, I am not sure about this one."
,EinStupid,2010-08-25T08:23Z,Try VLC Media player. never a complaint. THANKS JOHNNY
,darkscale,2010-08-26T12:31Z,"@lemon-aid: try vlc (videolan) as your player of choice. download k-lite mega pack as well (from codecs.com). Sometimes  - for rare - vids won't pay video but will have audio, or something weird. Try Divx player instead for those."
,buud,2010-08-26T23:51Z,Left handed monkey fuker
,dardardar67,2010-08-28T04:36Z,why cant you just convert it and put it on a disc? Shit....discs are only about 15cents ea! Then you could watch it on your dvd player. Surely you cant be that cheap to not be able to afford that? Peace out :)
,Rod321,2010-09-01T08:25Z,"Hi johnnyrep. Thanks for the movie. A 9/10, V 7.5/10, Sync 10/10. Fast download too. So thanks to Seeds & Peers."
,ThePhantomAce,2010-09-08T02:27Z,"Hey n0obZ - Get ahold of CODA32 (A codec), then use just about any media-player (Media Player Classic is a damn good one. Don't use MS's newest or anyone older than 6.4 for that matter 'cos they suck ducks!!!).

Use VLC if anything other fails...
Still no progress? Try G-Spot to figure out what the fuck's the matter, then... Ahhh... Figure it the fuck out...
RTFM and so on..."
,Magickrider,2010-09-14T03:04Z,why isnt there a dvd rip yet...
