                      PLOT                       
                                               
                                                       
     

        To her people she is a hero, to China she is a terrorist.

        The 10 Conditions of Love is the story of a woman, a family, a
        people and a homeland. It  is the story of Rebiya  Kadeer, the
        exiled leader of  the Uyghur people  and her campaign  for her
        people's human rights.

        It is  also the  story of  the 'other  Tibet', the country its
        Muslim people call East Turkestan, but which the Chinese  call
        Xinjiang Province.

        It  is the  story of  the ruthless  oppression of  20 million
        people  and  the  obliteration   of  1,500  years  of   Uyghur
        culture... of the global politics of energy... of Super  Power
        politicking over  the War  on Terror...  and of  the pain of a
        deeply loving family torn violently apart.

        Twice  nominated for  a Nobel  Peace Prize,  once the  richest
        entrepreneur in China, Rebiya Kadeer is a remarkable woman who
        pays  daily  a  terrible  price  for  patriotism.  The Chinese
        government  calls  Rebiya  a  terrorist,  and  have  sought to
        prevent her message  reaching the world,  including boycotting
        screenings of this film.
