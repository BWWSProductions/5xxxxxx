As the global epidemic of diabetes continues to expand, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is predicted to double in the next 20 years. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: An Evidence-Based Approach to Practical Management addresses this problem by expertly synthesizing the currently available evidence regarding specific issues in diabetes care. Written by an interdisciplinary team of scientists and medical professionals and comprising a wealth of information in a single resource, the book integrates the best evidence for the full range of clinical issues surrounding the evaluation and treatment of type 2 diabetes, including comorbid conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and vascular disease. To quantify the strength of evidence supporting current practices, each chapter highlights related conditions, including fatty liver disease, pregnancy, and polycystic ovarian syndrome, and also addresses barriers to treatment, including stress, depression, and patient motivation.
