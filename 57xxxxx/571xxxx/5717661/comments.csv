,hbk4754,2010-07-28T00:42Z,"If you dont already have winrar, don't bother with this because you can't decompress the rar file to install the program. Only use this if you have WinRar and are upgrading to this version"

,JMWhite,2010-08-06T20:41Z,"Most people rar up downloads, you should be thankful he has even provided you with this torrent, it is not his bad if you are too lazy or stupid to simply download a trial version and unrar it yourself. Then its as easy as uninstalling it and reinstalling something new. WOAH, wait too crazy for simpletons."

I've had to change my accounts for my bank due to this.
Do not download.
And the latest version of winrar is 3.93.
Nothing else is out yet."
