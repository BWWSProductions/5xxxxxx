[T],bobnjeff,2010-07-26T04:27Z,"i was wondering why there is a media player in this torrent, is this a sign up for something to view the movie"
[V],-jonny-,2010-07-30T14:08Z,"You don't need to sign up for the anything, and this is NOT out of synch. Get a better computer."
,onegreatguy,2010-08-03T07:25Z,I simply cannot get over the high quality job that was done by the remaster.  Outstanding!  Thank you!
,EmpAtahualpa,2010-08-04T19:39Z,"I can confirm this release is NOT out of sync. And indeed, the quality of this release is much better than the first one (I can remember because I uploaded that one myself on Demonoid)."
,EmpAtahualpa,2010-08-04T19:39Z,"Does anyone know where to find English subs for this release?

I cannot find the subs for this at my usual sources... :("
,DragonF.C.Porto,2010-08-27T00:44Z,"Thanks.. your work is appreciated..                    Please provide us with movies: Shangai Nights and Shangai Noon, they are great! but in HD they don't exist in the Web!!"
,VonNegga,2010-09-04T07:03Z,"Good quality encode.  Great movie.  The audio sync is fine - if it's out of sync for you, that usually means your CPU is not fast enough to decode the x264 stream.  This encode is DXVA compatible in case anyone cares about that.  This release has English subs muxed into the mkv, so I'm not sure why the person above was asking about it.  Thanks for the upload... +1 quality."
,kriketz,2010-09-06T08:02Z,"The rip seems perfect, however, i get an audio stutter every 30 seconds or so with vlc. Anybody have an idea what could be causing this? (sure it's not an inadequate hardware issue) Thanks!"
[V],-jonny-,2010-09-10T13:19Z,Hardware or software. Try installing CCCP. And don't use VLC.
