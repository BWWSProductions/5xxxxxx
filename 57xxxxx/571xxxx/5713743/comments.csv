Its a little pathetic in a way."
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-25T02:14Z,"It is only similar.  Size is not a factor.  This is part of a matched set.  There are differences you are not realizing.  I am not in competition, I am continuing a legacy.

If speed to release or size is your only concern then this is probably not for you.  It is not pathetic."

,TheBLUR88,2011-03-30T14:03Z,Why when I clicked on the link to see poppedtart's other uploaded torrents did it show a message that says: your search did not match any torrents? normally if it was an error from the site it would say: search engine overloaded please try you search again in a min... or something like that. I am hoping someone knowledgable about this sort of thing can help me out here cause I am confused lol If this is fixed or different in  a biit I will post a comment retracting this post thank you
