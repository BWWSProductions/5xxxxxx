,warloot24k,2010-07-31T12:47Z,Folks.... I think what is best is just uninstall jeppview and then go to the whole process of installing it again... and do not as in do not install cycle 1015 anymore.... just wait for cycle 1016.... I think we will have a much better chance of getting it right next time.  Shit happens when you are having fun!
