Washington's Generals: Marquis de Lafayette

He was idealistic, passionate and fearless. Heir to one of France's great fortunes, he was a direct descendant of knights who fought in the Crusades and alongside Joan of Arc. Like his father and grandfather, he became an officer in the king's army. Yet, at the age of nineteen, he risked his legacy and his wealth to fight for freedom in the American Revolution. His name was the Marquis de Lafayette and, during the course of the war, he became one of George Washington's most trusted commanders.
