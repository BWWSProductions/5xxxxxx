    Toshio Kamijo is 42 years old and just loves women. Suddenly, his        
    daughter is kidnapped! Blamed by his half-crazed wife, he does not       
    contact the police and rushes around trying to raise money. But,         
    neither the banks nor other loan companies in the street will loan       
    him any money. As his last resort, he goes to meet his acquaintance,     
    Gotoda, trying to get him to provide a loan... When he arrives, there    
    is a cute baby like Mamitan there. In a flash, Kamijo kidnaps            
    Gotoda's grandchild and sends the ransom letter that was sent to him     
    to Gotoda, asking him to pay the money!
