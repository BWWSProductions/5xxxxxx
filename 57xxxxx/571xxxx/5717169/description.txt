PLOT:

A 1970s-set comedy centered on three upstart professional men working at an insurance company.


REVIEW FROM IMDB:

While it lacks the puerile talentless 'comedy' stylings that dominate most popular comedies these days, Cemetery Junction manages to provide a stunning example of the British comedy-drama at its best (easily equalling classics such as East is East and The Full Monty). Flawless heart-breakingly realistic performances all round (Ralph Fiennes makes a chilling boss, even with the few lines he has), great hilarious set-ups (won't reveal too much, but one of the best ones involves Slade, and a certain well-known children's TV character), and a heartwarming message about family, friendship and wanting more out of life (themes perfected by Gervais and Merchant with The Office and Extras). It provides situations and gags that sound relatively unoriginal on paper, but become something new entirely on screen. It has a real heart, genuine emotion, genius humour, and showcases what makes good old-fashioned British dramas the best.

However, I fear those seeking a stupid comedy like The Hangover or Cop Out (where ridiculous unrealistic characters say random things desperate for laughs) will probably be disappointed. If it's cheap laughs you want from Ricky Gervais, watch The Invention of Lying (God help you)! I'm also not sure how well this film will sit with American audiences (the humour is downplayed and very British)

In short, a fantastic film for those who appreciate British comedy dramas in the vein of The Full Monty or East is East. Also, watch out for bald-headed Manc Karl Pilkington's 1 second cameo! Classic stuff!
