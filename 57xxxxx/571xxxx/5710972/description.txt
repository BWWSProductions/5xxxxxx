It's always good to see an old TV show like this, 
when both of the main guest stars are still alive 
and acting decades later.  In this case it's John Saxon 
(as "The Modoc Kid") and his younger partner 
played by Harrison Ford.

Don't think Ford was any good here, because he 
wasn't. I never cared for him as an actor, in spite 
of him being in 3 of the most popular movie series of 
all time:  Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and two of the 
Jack Ryan spy films. This was one of his first roles
though, hence the "Introducing Harrison Ford" credit.

But thanks to the acting of John Saxon, Charles Bickford,
and Don Quine, plus a good script this has become one
of my favorite episodes. After all, how can you go
wrong if the story has a family being held at gunpoint
in their own home and what they do to outsmart the outlaws?

This episode should be more noteable in that we get to 
see both Ryker and Abbott working together again.
