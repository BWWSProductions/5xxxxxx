,leemcnutt,2011-10-08T18:46Z,Hey Nibbles37 I had the same problem you need to download Wii Backup Manager and use that program to change the wbfs file to an iso file and the WBFS Manager will use the file
,dustinob43302,2011-10-17T05:42Z,Naa there is an easier way to do it. Just have a usb drive in Fat 32 and make a folder  called WBFS and throw the file in that folder on your usb. And load it on USB Loader GX. Or thats how I did it :P good luck to ya both also TY r3dcat!! awesome file!
