About this game:
Drive tanks, command ships, pilot planes and direct your troops into the heart of the action in the return of the popular tactical action game. Tricked into believing that the Solar Empire is developing a devastating super-weapon, Commander Pierce and Colonel Windsor of the Anglo Isles launch a pre-emptive strike on the Coral Atolls. The world is once again at war. The game features a series of online multiplayer modes, including Assault (instant combat), Skirmish (tactical depth), and Co-Op (Work with friends.)
