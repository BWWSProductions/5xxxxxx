"Alone Again" is a power ballad rock song written and released by the American heavy metal band Dokken on their 1984 album Tooth and Nail. The single reached #64 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Top Twenty on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts.

Tooth and Nail is the second studio album by heavy metal band Dokken, released in 1984 through Elektra Records. It was the #35 album of 1985 according to Billboard magazine. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA and reached #49 on the Billboard 200 U.S. album chart.

This album was the group's first with bassist Jeff Pilson following Juan Croucier's departure to join Ratt. Associate producer was Roy Thomas Baker, who had produced successful albums for Queen and The Cars and had re-recorded, remixed and re-mastered MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e's Too Fast for Love after the album was picked up by Elektra/WEA. It was produced by Tom Werman, known for producing several successful albums for Cheap Trick and the previous year's Shout at the Devil, the CrÃ¼e's breakthrough album.

Lead-off single for the album was "Into the Fire". A music video for the song received moderate play on MTV. "Into the Fire" spent eight weeks in the Top 40 of Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart from October to December 1984, peaking at #21 and charting for a total of eleven weeks.

Second single, "Just Got Lucky", was somewhat less successful, again supported by a music video while charting on the 50-place Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for seven weeks during January and February 1985 and peaking at #27.

It would be a power ballad that would give the albumâ€”and the bandâ€”its biggest hit. "Alone Again" spent fourteen weeks on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, including two at its peak position of #20. More significantly, the melodic song of heartbreak was aided by strong rotation that spring and summer at MTV and gave the band their first and biggest hit on the Hot 100, where its eleven-week run from May to July 1985 peaked at #64.
