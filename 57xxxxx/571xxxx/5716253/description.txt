This is the last 40 minutes of the Bob Siegel Show from Sunday, July 25th. Bob Siegel hosts a quasi-debate between Dearborn Mayor John O'Reilly and Christian Apologist David Wood. The month before, David Wood and three other Christians were falsely arrested in Dearborn Michigan at an Arabic festival.
