PLOT : A drama centered on a rebellious girl who is sent to a Southern beach town for the summer to stay with her father.
       Through their mutual love of music, the estranged duo learn to reconnect.

NOTES: Basicly the rerip is because the other one was done with 29.976fps when it was meant to be 23.976fps
       also time of the morning does not help as well anyway enjoy this as it will fit on 700MB as well.
