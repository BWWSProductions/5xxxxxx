What terrorism?

And who is terrorizing whom?

Life as a partner of a terrorism suspect means living with police surveillance and intelligence services: telephone tapping, video cameras pointing at your doors, plain-clothes police that follow your every move, email and internet access monitored etc., etc.

My partner Andrej Holm was arrested July 31 this year [2007] because one year earlier, the German police found his writings ""on gentrification,"" and combined with the fact that he is a political activist and does not always bring with him his mobile phone , it was enough to undertake an investigation for suspected terrorism. It's a bit more."
