Sally and Gillian Owens have always known they were different. Raised by their 
aunts after their parents' death, the sisters grew up in a household that was anything 
but typical--their aunts fed them chocolate cake for breakfast and taught them the 
uses of practical magic. But the invocation of the Owens' sorcery also carries a 
price--some call it a curse: the men they fall in love with are doomed to an untimely 
death. Now adult women with very different personalities, the quiet Sally and the 
fiery Gillian must use all of their powers to fight the family curse and a swarm of 
supernatural forces that threatens the lives of all the Owens women.
