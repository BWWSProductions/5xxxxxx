when i try to open the crack, it says :
Failed to enumerate any DirectX 9 compatible graphics adapters in this system.

Make sure you have a directX 9 compatible graphics adapter and have installed the latest manufacturer provided driver.

The application will now terminate...

What did i do wrong?"
