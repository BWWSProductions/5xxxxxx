Hi, this is my first torrent upload.

This is a program I wrote to categorize the top 100 games in the history of the Sega Genesis.
With the help of the "Fusion" Emulator, you can now find your favorite games easily, and play then on your computer with one simple click of a button!

In the latest patch, I also added a feature to allow the user to create their own favorites list, with their own custom Roms. 

The download size(100mb) may be a bit much for someone with a dial up connection, but for the countless hours of classic fun, its defiantly well worth it!

I have fully categorized just over 80 games for you to find and play, and hope to get suggestions from you for more games to include in this package.

To download directly, go to the following webpage:

download the torrent I am supplying here.
