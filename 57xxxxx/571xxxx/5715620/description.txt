The "Don't Ride With The Devil" single was recorded in small bits at different studios across Canton. Call of The Dead was recorded by Colton Jacoby just outside of Belden. The tile track was recorded 35 minutes away at Broken Brogan studios. Contagium was recorded a week later back in Belden. The quality of this record surpasses our others as of yet.
