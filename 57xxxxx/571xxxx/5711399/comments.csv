i just wonder, why they did not name it ""the kung fu kid"" (since karate is japanese and kung fu is what is taught to him by chan). 

but what do ignorant U.S. producers care ??? ... *shrug*

i enjoyed the movie a great deal. and the quality is well enough."
,scifialien,2010-07-25T02:40Z,"does it have english subs for non english parts, anyone??"

,Torx8,2010-07-29T18:35Z,"BigMatt, download VLC Video Player (google it)"
[T],minifrepper,2010-07-30T00:24Z,"Thank you very much, what great quality !

How is it possible?? Just curious-  "
,baines77,2010-07-30T10:18Z,"yeah, does it have english subs for non english parts? need to know before download. thanks."
,ohrton,2010-07-30T11:04Z,The sound seems to switch from stereo to mono from around 15:00 (dancing with the girl on the bench) to 30:30 (when the scene switches and the sound cuts for a split second). The dialog and sound will switch to what seems like mono and slightly towards the left speaker. Dialog isn't very clear in the right speaker anymore as before. In market(?) scene towards 30:00 area a bike drives from right to left but you only hear sound fade in to the left and not like you would except in stereo. Im using headphones and VLC.
,diegoq88,2010-08-01T06:43Z,"Great quality and fast download.

Some helpful info:

There are actually 2 .avi files. U can just append them both in VirtualDub easily. Oh and the codec is actually DivX not XviD. And the audio format is AC3."
,baines77,2010-08-01T18:38Z,Subs...Hardcoded for english speaking parts (yes) or (no)?????????????????????

,nofear24,2010-08-12T08:38Z,"WARNING**
I think comlumbian pictures is quiet viciously trying to fight piracy, friends have received emails and ISP are blocking accounts untill violation corrected. My friend recieved an email for this move and the grown ups both columbian picture movies, so be vigilant"

Thanks for the subs link, but they aren't in sync, at least not the second file, with the movie files."

Cancel that comment! I came to this false conclusion only because the second file starts out with no subtitles for the conversation already played at the end of the first file. My bad."
,pointleew,2011-03-12T05:17Z,"I'd actually recommend not watching it with subs.

I watched this version first, and then I download some subs and watched the foreign language scenes again, and let me tell you, the villains are 10 times more threatening when you can't understand them.  They have some pretty silly lines, but their delivery is awesome.  "
,Magnivore,2011-11-03T06:05Z,"I keep getting this 'codec 8192' error, and the internet isn't helping at all. Can someone point me in the direction of getting this update so I can watch this and many other movies? Thanks a lot. Will seed in the meantime."
