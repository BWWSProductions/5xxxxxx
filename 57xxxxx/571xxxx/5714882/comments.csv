,FernFrond,2010-07-29T03:29Z,Cool game that's almost like God Eater/ Monster hunter but a naruto alternative. Like. Japanese. Not like. But that doesn't stop me from playing. Just makes me have to spam buttons until I meet a requirement. Quite annoying. But God Eater is harder to find items in with it in japanese. Wiki helps. A bit.
,zerd000,2010-07-31T02:21Z,"no, it's working 100% and i am using it now."

,zerd000,2010-08-10T13:51Z,"i don't know if gen d can run it but i play it on gen d2, try to install gen d2."
