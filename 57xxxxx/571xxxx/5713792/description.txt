Trailer : search u tube, Once a Gangster

Co-written and directed by Infernal Affairs co-writer Felix Chong, Once a Gangster is a hilarious reversal of the popular Hong Kong triad film of the 1990s. Chong tells the absurd story of two gangland figures doing their best to not become the triad boss with sly references to Election, Chong's own Infernal Affairs, and even Hong Kong politics.
