,bloodpool11,2011-07-27T08:22Z,"im using a Mac:

Doesn't open at all on quicktime x
VLC: beautiful HD picture, but no audio
Divx player: can't open file

Transfered over to ps3 using hard drive:
get the file as ""CORRUPTED DATA"" and won't play at all.

overall: from what i saw on VLC the picture quality is SUPERB, unfortunately unplayable on anything i own. i have all codecs and its no use.

maybe there is something I'm missing? The sample video plays beautifully on everthing, but the actual movie .mp4 file does not.

any suggestions or help? thank you for the upload but its no good."
,logolepsic,2012-01-06T14:33Z,"Something is wrong with the aspect ratio. Eyes and car wheels in the sample I downloaded are not circles but ovals. It is a slight deformation, but it really bugs me."
,enonumus,2012-02-17T15:03Z,"People, if you download a movie and the aspect ratio is wrong (happens pretty frequently), it takes 5 minutes or less to fix it PERMANENTLY, or you can fix it instantly (but temporarily) much of the time if you're using the VLC player.  To fix it temporarily, just open the VIDEO tab in VLC and select the desired aspect ratio from the options provided (the most common ones are there).  To fix it permanently, simply open the file using MKV Merge or Yamb (Google them), select the video track, specify the desired aspect ratio, and spit out the new file (IMDB has all the theatrical aspect ratios listed, and those are usually correct for the rips).  MKV Merge will generate an MKV file in 2 to 3 minutes.  Yamb will produce an MP4 file if that's your preference, but it takes around 5 minutes usually depending on the file size.  You DON'T have to spend hours re-encoding the video!  Please stop complaining about incorrect aspect ratios, it's a non-issue."
,logolepsic,2012-03-06T14:02Z,"@enonumus

Clearly you don't understand interpolation. Using any tool to modify a video to correct the aspect ratio will re-interpolate the pixels. This was not a case of the wrong pixel aspect ratio as in NTSC 0.9 vs NTSC 1.2, this was a weird aspect ratio so yes, interpolation is the only solution and that is always a bad idea. So, thanks, but no thanks.

After downloading the sample of this torrent and realizing it was stretched, I went ahead and downloaded another torrent of the same movie instead."
