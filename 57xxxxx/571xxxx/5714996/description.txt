ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS5 TRAINING MANUAL FOR WINDOWS & MAC

The Best Of Adobe Photoshop.

Everything that could be done in the traditional darkroom can now be done with Adobe Photoshop, making special effects that were formerly achieved exclusively by expert darkroom technicians available to all photographers. This technological revolution has created new challenges as well as opportunities for increased creativity, allowing photographers to become digital artists as well. With illustrative photos throughout, this book details new, unexpected, and successful techniques used by artists, illustrators, commercial photographers, album designers, wedding photographers, portrait photographers, and teachers. Professional and advanced amateurs will benefit from the instructions for efficiently using the software, minimizing the computer time spent on each photo.
