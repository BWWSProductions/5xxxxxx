The film is a suspense/science fiction piece which comments upon and satirizes media, advertising, TV's effects on the populace, and ridiculous standard of beauty.  Michael Crichton was supposed to follow Coma and the Great Train Robbery with a big screen adaptation of his novel Congo.  When he started doing the research into what it would take to do the special effects (in 1980s dollars and makeup effects) he found it was going to nearly impossible and cost prohibitive to recreate the apes of the story.  The project was abandoned and he moved onto this film.  

Michael Crichton first became known as a result of his novel The Andromeda Strain (1969). Crichton embarked on a successful career as a novelist but his big break came with the hit film adaptation of his novel, The Andromeda Strain (1971). Crichton parlayed this success to make his own directorial debut with Westworld (1973). He went onto several other films of variable success (see below). Looker was Michael Crichton√¢
