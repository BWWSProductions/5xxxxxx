due to bad capture frame rates, you may need to use the trick below to adjust the 

flickering effect.

a. use VLC Media Player (google for it if you don't already have one)
b. got to ""Tools""
c. choose ""Effects and Filters""
-OR- press Ctrl+E
d. a window called ""Adjustments and Effects"" popup
e. click ""Video Effects"" tab
f. then click ""Image modification"" tab
g. check the box called ""Motion Blur""
h. scroll the slider back to about between 40-50% (adjust to your liking)

now is more like it, yeah?

,durtyd,2010-07-27T23:11Z,"Hey GreenMark there is no ""Tools"" tab in VLC you moron. Get your head outta your ass."
,GreenMark,2010-07-28T00:50Z,"@durtyd YOU MUST BE F*CKEN RETARTED. AT WHAT POINT DID I SAY ""Tools"" tab? IF YOU ARE TOO DUMB TO FIGURE OUT THE ""Tools"" menu, I F*CKEN HOPE YOU SMART ENOUGH TO USE THE hotkey PROVIDED."
,highlander777,2010-07-28T04:17Z,Video? Audio?
,jaylee1,2010-07-29T16:48Z,downloading now thatnks for the tips
,jaylee1,2010-07-29T16:50Z,dl'ing now thanks
,gazzer34,2010-07-30T00:02Z,"This VLC media player you are referring too, GreenMark, is for windows operating systems, right? Because I have an imac, and I have VLC media player installed, and I don't see tools, nor do I see effects and filters, or anything else for that matter. So I'm guessing that the two VLC media players are different, that has to be the case. People forget that programs are not all not all compatible with the same operating system, different systems, different programs, thats simple enough right, thanks."
,maddhadder,2010-07-30T00:32Z,and still no comment on v/a=? anybody 
,highlander777,2010-07-30T08:09Z,I'm going to assume because of GreenMark's post that this video also has the flickering problem like feel free and magnet versions and is probably from the same source. Guess I'll wait for a better copy.
