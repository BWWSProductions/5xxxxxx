This is a small collection of sound effects based on the works of Pink Floyd.

These instructions will help you replace your sound scheme.

1.	Go to C:WINDOWS
2.	Copy your 'media' folder there to another location on your pc if you want to reset your sounds to the original ones.
3.	Copy the the 'media' folder in this folder and replace the one in your C:WINDOWS folder.


That's all there is to it....

This works on windows xp but I'm not sure about other operating systems.
