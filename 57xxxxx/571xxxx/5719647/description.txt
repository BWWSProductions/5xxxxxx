The German broadcaster Deutsche Welle publish a podcast twice a week which comprises a recent German news article read allowed together with a word-for-word transcript.  There is also a glossary of vocabulary and exercises attached to the articles.  This torrent gathers together all the podcasts released throughout the whole of 2008.  The articles are in word 2007 (.docx) format and the audio files are in .mp3.  These are free to thepublic and are very useful for tutors and teachers teaching German as the articles are very interesting and the exercises focus on grammar and comprehension.  I hope this is of use to anyone who needs it.  Happy sharing!
