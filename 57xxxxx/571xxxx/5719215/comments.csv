NICE GUD 2 C MORE UPLOADERS...
WILL U TAKE REQUESTS"
[T],gunnersrock,2010-07-27T12:31Z,I can't take many requests as i only have upload speed of 100 kbps. Only request movies that you really need and i will see what i can do and don't forget to seed
[V],RiddlerA,2010-07-28T22:08Z,"100 kbps ......... thats like 60 more than mine
Upload speed doesn't matter in torrents
there are a lot of peers & seeders to support you"
[T],gunnersrock,2010-07-28T22:34Z,"@riddler
i guess you're right i just expected a few more seeders maybe they will pickup in time and up to what ratio do you seed riddler"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-08-02T08:18Z,"For my first 10 odd torrents I did for a ratio of 10 - 15
Nowadats ...... it depends on the particular upload , but anywhere from 2 to 5"
[V],pluto999,2010-08-11T17:41Z,the only reason your torrents aren't picking up many seeders cause you're not tagging the movies. tag the names.
