,retardoface,2010-07-27T07:06Z,you uploading to avaxhome now?
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-27T20:04Z,"is that another torrent site? if so then no. it's because i use the public trackers to help speed things up, but it basicly spreads my torrents everywhere.

i've seen them on torrentz/bitnova/torrentshare ect..."
,retardoface,2010-07-28T07:38Z,"its not a torrent site, someones taking your torrents specifically G.N Team and posted them on there, its an audiophile vinyl ripping site"
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-28T14:14Z,i m not jealous but how you got the green skull so early????
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-28T17:58Z,"i didn't ask for the skull if thats what your saying...

i think they gave it to me cause i'm the most consistant vinyl ripper, pretty much on the whole net.. and i did bring a couple of pre-release flac albums aswell (Gorillaz plastic beach and eminem recovery) that weren't on here before me

I checked your list and you totally deserve a vip skull aswell, i guess you just have to catch the attention of the mods"
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-29T15:09Z,ya rightly said but what exactly is a vinyl bcoz vinyl files have the extension .flac....??can you just explain me....bcoz i have no knowledge about vinyle format
[V],HMVinyl,2010-07-29T16:09Z,"Vinyl as in Vinyl records (12"" black plastic disc). flac is a way of compressing the audio, similar to mp3 just bigger and better"
[V],jainmehul,2010-07-29T16:34Z,so vinyl is a different disc and you cant rip a vinyl from a normal disc..is it that way??
,shinbeit,2010-08-03T01:49Z,"I have been following your uploads, I recommend buying a 24/96 sound card for listening to them, also avidly Downloading npto's torrents, and am going to start uploading material as soon as I get my semi-prof card (Creative for laptop) tnx a lot, "
,Rulez4Fool,2011-12-16T06:13Z,Thank you very much for this.  God bless your Rock & Rollin' heart!
