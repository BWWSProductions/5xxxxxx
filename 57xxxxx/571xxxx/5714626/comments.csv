We are all stuck at 8.5%. So please seed. If I manage to download it and if is working I will seed for a couple of weeks."
,YiffyFox117,2010-07-31T05:57Z,"Yea, I am not surprised at that... as the comp that I have the data on is a laptop that gets turned on and off constantly... (It is my only comp that has internet connection) If you know how to increase the amount that I seed, that info would be helpful for all of us. I use uTorrent with the down/up settings on max. "

,YiffyFox117,2010-09-04T01:23Z,@peelzman: yes it is.
,YiffyFox117,2010-09-04T01:25Z,"Do to a fatal laptop crash, it will be awhile before I can seed again, but I will."
,Autarchus,2010-09-10T10:43Z,So I download and go to the exe file and open it. I get an error: This application has failed because d3dx9_31.dll was not found.
,sourceman2,2010-11-03T12:09Z,"i need everyone to seed this when they can,
im stuck at 3.6%"
,Beta582,2011-01-28T06:40Z,The game works perfectly except i can't get the audio to work.... I have gotten many games to work but I could use some help with this one...
