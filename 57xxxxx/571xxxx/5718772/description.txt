This is Growing Pains #1 from 11/88 Studios.

It has nothing to do with the tv show.

This comic is written & created by me and it has a massive art team.

It's a bit of a coming of age story, the initial idea was to have three self contained stories that were connected as well. That didn't quite turn out the way I planned, but it's still a complete story with a beginning, middle & end.

The book does contain water marks on every page, I encourage everyone to read it and share it. I'd rather 1,000 people read the book for free than three people read the book and donate a couple bucks.

I know most people prefer to read the cbr version of the book, but if you'd prefer the pdf, it's there for you also. I will seed this forever, but it doesn't hurt for others too also.
