,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-07-30T16:15Z,"You need to run Akaio 1.7 (You can find it on the acekard site.) and update the loader. I am running an Acekard2i with Akaio 1.7, that's what I tested it on."
,kazmcc,2010-07-31T15:36Z,Won't even let me d/l on this one :-( Had nothing but trouble trying to get this game. Just displays a black screen when I try and use it with ever torrent I've tried.
,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-07-31T18:07Z,The download should work fine. What card and firmware are you running?
,killboytheone,2010-08-01T08:49Z,"Nice upload :)
Does not work with my DSi TTDSi with firmware v1.17. Romloading failed errorcode=4 :("
,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-08-02T17:41Z,"Download and run wood 1.09, disable soft reset and auto patching, the AP has a problem with those functions in the firmware. Or try it in your current interface."
,Shaser67,2010-08-03T10:11Z,I have used R4 cards with various firmware and it still wont load for me.
,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-08-03T15:58Z,You must go through the options for the specific game (L or R buttons) and disable the 2 options for auto patching and the option for soft reset.
,gigante1,2010-08-04T11:04Z,"IsnÂ´t wood 1.09 for the R4-card? Or have someone also made wood for the TT-card?
Please give us a hint or URL where we may find firmware for the DSTT-card that works with this game. and do not freeze, or say ""error code 4"""
,darrenc7394,2010-08-05T22:34Z,"Hod do I get this to work on N5 card? Is it possible, has anyone had this working on N5? 

Any advice appreciated thanks"
,darrenc7394,2010-08-05T22:52Z,"Does this work using N5 card, if so can anyone tell me how ? Thanks"
,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-08-06T16:20Z,"If you are having that many problems with your current card, you can find an Acekard2i (It is backwards compatible) for $20 shipped, it has run everything I have needed."
,gigante1,2010-08-07T10:26Z,"The problem seems to be this game, all other games works fine on NDSTT. But none of the versions of this game seems to work on the TT-card. so ther are not ""so many problems"" as you wrote."
,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-08-10T18:11Z,"First off, I didn't write ""So many problems"". Second, if you don't like, don't download it. And this is not the only game that does not run correctly on a DSTT card, there is a problem with the AP and compatibility with those cards. Considering how outdated they are now, there is no longer any support, and people who could actually help out, like me, have an insouciant attitude after bitchy people like you. Do everyone a favor, scrounge up $20 from your mother's basement and buy an Acekard."
,redsil,2010-08-17T16:28Z,Hi! please don't get upset by some comments! you're a great help the game does not work on my R4i v1.4 gold card with firmware v1.10b I just get a blank screen... I tried updating the kernel and swapping arm7 with dsbuff but now I get a black screen instead.... any idea? thank you
,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-08-19T15:24Z,"Downgrade your firmware to Wood 1.09 and disable all functions for the .rom (Auto Patching, soft reset etc.) in the menu, I believe it is reached by using the L and R buttons on top of the DS. There have been a lot of problems with running this .rom on older cards, this one is MANUALLY patched and people still cannot run it because of the AP (Auto Patching) problems with older cards."
,Garmac,2010-12-11T23:20Z,"On the R4 with the new wood 1.09, this is what I had to do to make it work. Scroll to the Game, press ""Start"" and a menu appears, choose ""file info"" and press ""A"", then Press ""Y"" to access options for the file. Press the ""R"" button to switch to next menu option. Change option ""Reset in game"" to off. Press ""A"" to save and confirm... that's it, worked for me..."
,jsportive,2011-03-04T12:56Z,"can you send me a link towards the wood firmware?
i have dstt, but can only find the newest.
or is the newest exactly what i need?"
,void246,2011-03-15T05:21Z,"Now works on ttds follow link and choose ttds on top left of list don't worry about trying woods on same page.
