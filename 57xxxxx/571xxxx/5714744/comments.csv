,andr3w285,2010-07-26T16:02Z,"ok so i know i'll be ban if i play this while signed in, but if i play it offline then sign in to play another game will i still be banned?"
,co30op,2010-07-27T05:38Z,"I'm sure everyone knows don't play online before the release date, but....  there is a system update built into the game(listed below).  Even if your not logged in on your account, your system will still update, before the original release letting M$ know you got it early somehow.  I don't know if you can get banned for it, but its worth letting everyone know.  If anyone has played and is still not not banned after a couple of days please let me/us know.  Thanks
