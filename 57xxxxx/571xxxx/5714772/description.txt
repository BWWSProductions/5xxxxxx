This is a seminar from a Youth Specialties Conference in 2004.  I thought I'd upload this even though it is an older seminar since it is so amazing.  Rob Bell is the seminar speaker/teacher. It's called: The Revolutionary Voice - becoming the kind of person people need to hear.

The seminar was 8 hours long.  The files are MP3 that I ripped from the seminar CD's that I purchased.  

Any questions feel free to send me a message.

Enjoy!
