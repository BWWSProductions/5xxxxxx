,SHERIFA,2010-07-27T04:59Z,"YES, 100% real ""thing"". CloneDVD already uploaded on TL, but this I've downloaded manually 2 days ago."
,SHERIFA,2010-07-27T05:01Z,"@Knotton: I won't work if you don't already bought SCII from your local store or Blizzard EU / US Store, huh. DRM Activation, yeah...

But you'll be able to install the game and able to start it, and... that's all. Not playable, till inserting legal key on your b.net acc."

,SHERIFA,2010-07-27T05:15Z,"I'm deleting comments, WTF !? LoL.

I said in my previous comment from above, that IF you REALLY want to play the game, you have to get it from your local store. I don't care what method you want to use (stole or buying it)."
,SHERIFA,2010-07-27T05:16Z,"Nope, noone can delete comments, even Uploader's or users their own, huh. This is TPB :>."
,rafaelmd,2010-07-27T05:22Z,"Its retail, we can buy the key or just wait for the crack, is that right?"
,David9876,2010-07-27T09:33Z,Is it possible to get a torrent of the art book from the collectors edition?
,neotristram,2010-07-27T14:27Z,"if you could upload the artbook, you'll be my hero for life! :)"
,TonyS1,2010-07-27T22:02Z,"ok this took me 5 fucking tries but got it... 1st I'm using an EnGB version (the collectors ED)
install it, then it updates auto. It needs to update again as well, if it doesn't do this... close the launcher and relaunch from the desktop shortcut (only use this to launch the game) if it still doesn't update, restart your pc and relaunch again. Once it's updated RUN THE GAME 1st WITH NO CRACKS APPLIED... then close it, apply the cracks and start from ""Start Campaign"" also the tutorials work... any other combination and this will fuck-up. Trust me I have been going at it for hours. BTW I have launched and relaunched the game and played briefly 4 times to verify
GOD DAMMIT what a hassle but thanx to the cracker, this is legit folks, just a pain in the ass is all :)"
,SHERIFA,2010-07-28T01:34Z,"So far I have over 17+ Pre-Orders, tomorrow will be delivered keys maybe. Next one is... the 2nd part of the order :D."
