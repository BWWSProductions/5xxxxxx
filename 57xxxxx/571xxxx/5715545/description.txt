A group of rogues steal a scroll granting its bearer the property of the land of Aurocastro in Apulia (south of Italy). They elect a shaggy knight, Brancaleone from Norcia, as their leader, and decide to get possession of this supposedly wealthy land. Many adventures will occurr during the journey.

L'Armata Brancaleone" is an absolute comedy masterpiece. Its surreal medieval world is incredibly deep and funny. The main comic device is based on the contrast between the heroic world that the charachters try to master (paladins, knights' tournaments, kings etc) and their actual miserable conditions. The only problem with this movie for non-italian speakers is the language: the authors re-created a mock medieval language (using ancient italian, latin and italian dialects) which is absolutely flamboyant. This particular language (very difficult to understand if you're not italian native speaker) and Vittorio Gassman make this movie one of the best comedies of the 20th century. Thanks to Mario Monicelli, the great film director.
