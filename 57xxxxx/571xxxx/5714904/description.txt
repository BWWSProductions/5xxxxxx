NODLABS NOTES
The US R1 we used comes with no subs whatsoever (soft, hard or closed captioned) however there are a few brief non-english bits. We assume those are not meant to be subbed as they are not meant to be understood. It seems the blu-ray lacks subs either as the rip of that one didn't pre with any subs either. See Sample dir for some proofs.

You may notice there was an internal of this movie a few weeks back from the mighty reencoding/p2p sourced grp RUBY. That was internaled due to foreign overlays that were present in the spanish scene dvdr they ripped off.
