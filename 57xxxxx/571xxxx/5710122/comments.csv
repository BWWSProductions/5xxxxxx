,george1052,2010-08-02T08:04Z,"Hi guys, I normally keep my comments, whether good or bad, to myself but I'd like to say if you really want to see this movie, go to the theaters. Inception is so awesome! You need to see the special effects; plus you don't want to take the chance of certain parts missing from the cam version. This is one of those films that you can't afford to miss anything..even if it's just a couple of minutes. I'd recommend that you wait until an R5 or dvdrip becomes available (if you choose not to go the theaters). Oh, might I add that I hope there aren't a lot of side conversations or babies crying if you should go to the theater because ity's very imperative that there aren't any distractions. Use the bathroom before finding a seat. Sorry...I guess I'm one of those guys that has to truly focus."

I love Ellen Page but she has finally started to age. I think it was Thomas Hardy that provided the most exciting 'kill them suckas' scenes although it could have been (maybe) Lukas Haas (I didn't even recognize him in the film). Joseph Gordon-Levitt performed quite well, also. I like DiCaprio and it was 'his' movie but he was just adequate in his role (I think he was much better in 'Shutter Island').

The star of the movie, however, was the special effects and/or cinematography. That alone was worth the ticket price. Not amazing but really great.

However, because of the complexities involved in the movie, many (like me) will be forced to dl it just to watch it over (with rewind) and over. Even still, I am going to have to wait for a DVD quality version...nothing less will do.

,umarnawazkhan,2010-09-02T09:07Z,"change your upload video's to MP4 or MKV
for high quality
720p - x264

What is x264?

x264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!

What is a .mkv file?

MKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard Audio/Video container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video "

*newbie confuse*"
,killyourself,2010-09-15T01:05Z,"@tandianus

720p and HDrip are going to be very high quality but significantly larger files.

DVDRip is a direct copy from the retail DVD version of that film.

DVDScr is a ""Screener"" usually given to critics and other important people in the film industry before the DVD is released to the public. The quality is usually near DVDRip, but often has watermarkings at the beginning or sometimes the entire duration (example: the words ""Property of 20th Century Fox"" at the bottom of the screen) in an attempt to prevent people from sharing the screener.

And R5 will usually be lower quality that DVDRip. It is much better than a CAM or TS, but it's not perfect.

So [in most cases]:
HD/720p > DVDRip > DVDScr > R5 > TS/CAM

Hope that helps."
