George "Buddy" Guy (born July 30, 1936) is an American blues guitarist and singer. He is a critically acclaimed artist who has established himself as a pioneer of the Chicago blues  sound, and has served as an influence to some of the most notable musicians of his generation. Guy is known, too, for his showmanship on stage, playing his guitar with drumsticks, or strolling into the audience while playing solos. He was ranked thirtieth in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".

Guy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 14, 2005 by Eric Clapton and B.B. King. Clapton recalled seeing Guy perform in Londonâ€™s Marquee Club in 1965, impressing him with his technique, his looks, and his charismatic showmanship. He remembered seeing Guy pick the guitar with his teeth and play it over his headâ€”two tricks that later influenced Jimi Hendrix. [citation needed] Guyâ€™s acceptance speech was concise: "If you donâ€™t think you have the blues, just keep living."

Jeff Beck recalled the night he and Stevie Ray Vaughan jammed with Guy at Buddy Guyâ€™s Legends club in Chicago: â€œThat was just the most incredible stuff I ever heard in my life. The three of us all jammed and it was so thrilling. That is as close you can come to the heart of the blues.â€ According to Jimmy Page: â€œBuddy Guy is an absolute monsterâ€ and â€œThere were a number of albums that everybody got tuned into in the early days. There was one in particular called, I think, American Folk Festival Of The Blues, which featured Buddy Guyâ€”he just astounded everybody.â€ Former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman: â€œGuitar Legends do not come any better than Buddy Guy. He is feted by his peers and loved by his fans for his ability to make the guitar both talk and cry the bluesâ€¦ Such is Buddyâ€™s mastery of the guitar that there is virtually no guitarist that he cannot imitate.â€ Guy has opened for the Rolling Stones on numerous tours since the early 1970s. Slash: "Buddy Guy is the perfect combination of R&B and hardcore rock and roll." ZZ Topâ€™s Billy Gibbons: "He (Buddy Guy) ain't no trickster. He may appear surprised by his own instant ability but, clearly, he knows what's up." Lonnie Brooks: â€œBuddy Guy is a master. Heâ€™s the bravest guitar player Iâ€™ve ever seen on a bandstand. Heâ€™ll pull you into his trap and kill you. He owns that bandstand and everyone knows it when Buddyâ€™s up there."
