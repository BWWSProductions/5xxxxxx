started the game and shot 2 enemies -played for 1 minute~ and uninstalled the game. i instantly didnt like it for sum reason idk why.
i just wanna say the audio it really badly organised, you hear the enemies talking but it sounds like its you talking, they obviously didnt bother moving the audio forward... but meh, atleast it wasnt a big file size."
