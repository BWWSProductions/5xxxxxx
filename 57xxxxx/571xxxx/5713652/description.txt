Cisco Security Agent presents a detailed explanation of Cisco Security Agent, illustrating the use of host Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) in modern self-defending network protection schemes. At the endpoint, the deployment of a host IPS provides protection against both worms and viruses. Rather than focusing exclusively on reconnaissance phases of network attacks a host IPS approaches the problem from the other direction, preventing malicious activity on the host by focusing on behavior. By changing the focus to behavior, damaging activity can be detected and blocked√¢
