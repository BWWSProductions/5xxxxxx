,ccrocker58,2011-02-02T05:34Z,"Tried installing on my old system; coming up saying ""Invalid Boot Diskette""."
,NickManch,2011-03-11T01:38Z,All seemed to install just fine over the network yesterday except one file ... reported as avvji5up.sys which failed to copy over. I've tried putting that file name into Google to find out what it is and if I can find it and looked in this package yet can't find any mention of it. Has anyone else experienced this or know what that file is please? Thanks. I shall try again tomorrow. It's the only error I got but it won't run without this file it seems.
,Halkonzerv,2011-04-23T12:04Z,"Well, I tried to install this in a virtual machine first using Oracle VirtualBox. 

The installer keep restarting after the component install progress bar reach the end, before the installer starts building the desktop.

Why? I think this should work on a virtual machine."
