Security Operations Management
------------------------------


Security Operations Management is written for practitioners, students,
and general managers who are involved with or interested in managing
security operations more effectively. The purpose of this book is not immodest:
it seeks to bring order to the sometimes chaotic task of protecting people,
physical assets, intellectual property, and opportunity. It endeavors to
provide a structure to operate programs for the benefit of the organization,
and it wishes to relate such principles clearly and directly to readers.
