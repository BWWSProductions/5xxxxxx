,yurune,2010-07-27T22:32Z,"I was wondering why these MP4s wouldn't play in Zoom Player, which can play ANY video file (not a big deal since PowderDVD plays them just fine).  According to MediaInfo these files are Flash Video, and not the MPEG-4 I was expecting.  I changed the file extension to FLV and it played in Zoom just dandy.  So, are these really MP4s or FLVs?  Flash Video in an MP4 containter?  This fascinates me, lol."
