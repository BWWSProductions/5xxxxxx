FLAWL3SS NOTES
Thanks to IMAGINE for the source files and the audio. This one needed alot of work, first it was cropping, then it was taking the yellow tint and red and blue down. also worked on the hue, gamma, saturation and the black levels. Also lowered the brightness on it. Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS.
