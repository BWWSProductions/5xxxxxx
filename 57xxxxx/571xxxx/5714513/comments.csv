I find that the English accent in South Africa is TOTALLY and EASILY understood if you are already are decent at using English (to me all english sub dialects are easily understood??? this decision makes no sense)???? Let me get this right, you truly thought most people would want to have the picture quality ruined with hardcoded subs that are the same as the spoken lang. in the movie???? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING.... or were you NOT thinking??? Bummer, a good rip ruined :~( (put subs as a separate file and let the user of the movie decide to use or not to use the subs, it isn't cool to make that decision for everyone and force your feelings on such things) A perfect rip is one that is MOST like the original DVD/BLURAY/DVR/TIVO,HDV, etc, etc, etc it came from. I haven't seen any store bought movie with hardcoded subs? Maybe I am crazy here???? Other then the hardcoding, GREAT upload. I'll wait for a better copy."

,terra1983,2011-09-06T06:56Z,the problem with South african movies is that they make the accent even worse in the movie ... a lot different in real life
