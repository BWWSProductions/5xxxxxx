Thank you Inflammo for making my job easier, and getting out the show!!

Today is my last post on the pirate bay. I will no longer be visiting the site next week. I have had a fun time, but it has now come to an end. Thank you TPB for everything you have given me. You went down swinging. (Humming Taps...) Good luck bro.

Anyone have any suggestions for another public site I can post the shows on?
