Music : Classical : MP3/Variable


This is a disc that you will either love or hate. If you find the sound of a fortepiano too 'twangy', and if you believe that scores are cast in stone and not to be improvised around, look away now.

However, if you are as impressed as I am with Andreas Staier's artistry and integrity, and if you enjoy hearing familiar repertory presented in a fresh and enterprising way you'll be delighted and amazed with these three sonatas, played on a copy of a fortepiano from 1785.

Staier breathes new life into these sonatas through a combination of stunning virtuosity and a keen sense of adventure. These are not lightweight or trivial interpretations; he does not decorate or improvise merely for effect. These are fresh and vital performances that challenge perceptions about how instrumental works by Mozart and his contemporaries should be performed. I would recommend this disc to anyone.


Enjoy and Seed!!
