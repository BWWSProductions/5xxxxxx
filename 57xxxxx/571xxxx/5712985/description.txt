P-O-V VHS i bought from ebay, it was brand new, still in the wrapper, it cost me Â£23, a bargain.
i connected it from VHS to my computer using easycap, which i also bought from ebay for Â£9.99.
i copied it from the VHS and easycap driver using sony vegas pro9, 
i rendered it in sony vegas pro 9 as High Definition, widescreen 16:9 frame size 1280 x 768, video bit rate 14279 kbits/per sec, 
audio was mp3 128 kbits/per sec, in other words, you can happily watch this on a 42" plasma and it will look great.
i then used powerISO to make it into one handy iso file that can be burned straight to dvd.
thanks for reading, enjoy p_o_V, and please seed as much as you can.


burn the image file with poweriso, nero or deamon tools, or for windows 7 users, you can use windows disc burner
