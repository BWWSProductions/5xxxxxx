Game ID: SDUPO1 (Has it's own ID, so it won't interfere with the original or any other custom nsmb game.) 

Let me start of by saying that I didn't create all of the arc files, only 2 :).. I found about 65(ish) custom arc files all over the net, in different places and not just in one place (So I wouldn't steal anyones project. I just placed them in the game with wii scrubber. I used Caspers custom as a base because I didn't have enough arc files to fill the entire game and didn't want to use levels from the original game. 
With that being said, this game is completely different than the others :) 
I also uploaded my covers to wiitd. Meaning the covers will download via your usb loader ;)
And I hope you like it :D
