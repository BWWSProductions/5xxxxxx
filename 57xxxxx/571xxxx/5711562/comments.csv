,mRmasteRful17,2010-08-07T16:45Z,Good work. Sounds great
,CeilHusky,2010-08-21T03:34Z,Excellent torrent :)
,Ardent1,2010-12-07T20:49Z,What are you talking about? FLAC is THE best quality. Convert it to something your iPod plays if you don't like it.
,DemonicBlaze,2011-01-31T03:38Z,"Whats with the song nightmare? Theres two, theres the crappy low bitrate one, and then theres another one.... WMP says its a audio file....Doesnt give bitrate or anything else. Cant seek on it either, doesnt give duration. "
,CanadaUnderFire,2011-02-19T23:14Z,I agree with obiwancanblome. Why take the time to convert it then upload it for people when their itunes can do it for them. Not everyone has an ipod and I probably will never buy one brand new as why would I want to support apple? They suck.
,HMD3,2011-05-17T06:24Z,"This torrent is JUNK. Its NOT 320 or FLAC, does this clown even know what a bit-rate or flac is? a bit rate is for mp3, of which these are 128/256 bit. A bit-rate has nothing to do with FLAC. Get this 1 instead from someone who knows what they are doing.

Those of you who are on your period and giving this guy a hard time because you don't use an Ipod, Just reformat it yourselves you bunch of lazy ass fucks. Go cry about it to someone else who actually did a bad job on their torrent."

,ihavenoarms,2011-11-24T00:07Z,"Just downloaded this torrent in hopes of completing my Avenged Sevenfold FLAC collection. I found that this is a collection of 128kbps mp3's from Nightmare, rather than FLAC format, one or two of the songs are at 256kbps and God Hates Us is at 320kbps. I don't care that much, I'm fine with the 320kbps version of the album that I already have, but just so you guys know..."
