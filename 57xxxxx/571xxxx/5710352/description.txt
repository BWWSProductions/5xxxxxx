After the passing away of their parents, Ravi Anand, the eldest of seven brothers, takes it upon 
himself to raise them - albeit a little wild and kinda animal-like. The brothers all sport long beards, 
hate taking showers/baths, and above all hate Ravi bossing them around. When Ravi tries to convince 
Nurse Sheela to marry his friend, Shekar, he mistakenly lectures the wrong girl, Indu, and as result 
Ravi falls head over heels in love with her. But Indu is not available to marry any stinky creep, 
who has not washed himself in weeks, so Ravi shaves, washes, dresses up smart, 
successfully woos Indu and marries her.
