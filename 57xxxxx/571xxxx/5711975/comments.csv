This is just a copy of a torrent that has already been released a while ago so it's pointless downloading something that's already been released.

I happen to know that SpandauBaby worked very hard on making these files like this, all the tagging that was involved was huge.  This uploader can't possibly claim the glory for making this.  It is not a complicated process to download somebody else's work and then reupload it again."
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-07-25T17:44Z,"@Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary first off all! this torrent is not in any scene database and its been upped to private tracker UNTAGGED! i only have added ""-TPB"" part because its being upped to TPB nothing else nothing more i dind add any credits to nobody please keep your drama to yourself. End story!"
[T],thenoobish,2010-07-25T18:56Z,how were you able to upload a torrent with 3062 files in it??
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-07-25T19:39Z,@thenoobish i own 2 dedicated servers...
[T],thenoobish,2010-07-25T20:12Z,"hehe i mean how could you post it to tpb, i thought tpb has a limit of 500 files in one torrent?"
[M],SteRipper,2010-08-05T17:57Z,"@Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary: There is no need to be nasty about this torrent. It's not breaking any rules at all. 

If you or anyone doesn't like it, then leave it alone and go somewhere else. //Mod"
,Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary,2010-08-06T12:39Z,It is my torrent.  I am already seeding it now on another torrent and was doing before this Stun person started reuploading it again.
[M],SteRipper,2010-08-06T21:56Z,"@Evil_Demonz_Are_Scary 

Ok, so you have a torrent, and he has a torrent. 

Maybe his is better than yours. Maybe his has better quality or faster DL speed. Who knows. What I DO know is that you are starting to sound like a dick.

There are more important things to worry about and spend you time on. 

Knock it the fuck off. Last chance. Don't push it."
