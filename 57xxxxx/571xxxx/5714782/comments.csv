,PyroPsychZach,2010-09-06T17:56Z,"ISO doesn't work, nor dos the installer file in it. Just drops a bunch of viruses, namely 'Application.Keylogger.PZL', 'Gen:Variant.MalDropper.1' and 'Adware.LoudMo.A'.

Don't waste your time with this torrent."
,susanyes,2011-06-23T02:50Z,"The only thing I seem to be missing is a serial, since the installer asks for one? There's another folder:
ViTALiTY with 2 subfolders with .exe and .dll files - not very useful afaik.. Also a bunch of hidden files, but no clues as how to make this run."
