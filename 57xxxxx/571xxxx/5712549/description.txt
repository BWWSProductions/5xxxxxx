"For the Love of Money" is a soul/funk song written by Kenneth Gamble, Leon Huff, and Anthony Jackson; and recorded by Philadelphia soul group The O'Jays for the album Ship Ahoy. Produced by Gamble and Huff for Philadelphia International Records, "For the Love of Money" was issued as a single in late 1973 (see 1973 in music), with "People Keep Tellin' Me" as its b-side. The single peaked at number three on the U.S. Billboard R&B chart, and at number nine on Billboard's Pop Singles chart  in spring 1974. Though the album version of the song was over seven minutes long, it received substantial radio airplay. The song's title comes from a well-known Bible verse, 1 Timothy  6:10: "For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows" (King James Version).

It was covered by BulletBoys on their eponymous 1988 album, and a video was made for the song.

BulletBoys is the self-titled first album from the hair metal band BulletBoys, released in 1988. It features the hit "Smooth Up In Ya" as well as a cover of The O'Jay's song "For the Love of Money". The album went certified gold in 1989 selling over 500,000 copies.

BulletBoys is an American Glam metal band whose original line-up consisted of vocalist Marq Torien (born Mark Maytorena), guitarist Mick Sweda, bassist Lonnie Vencent (born Lonnie Miller), and drummer Jimmy D'Anda.

The BulletBoys were formed in 1987 in Los Angeles, California, after Marq Torien, Mick Sweda and Lonnie Vencent left King Kobra. Drummer Marc Danzeisen rounded out the band but was replaced with new young rock drummer Jimmy D'Anda and the band was signed to Warner Brothers. The bandâ€™s first two albums (BulletBoys, released on September 16, 1988 by Warner Brother Records/WEA and Freakshow, released on March 12, 1991, by Warner Brothers Records/WEA) were well received and the band sold over 1 million copies worldwide. From their album Freakshow, the band was in heavy rotation on the cable music channel MTV  with its music video for the song 'Hang on St. Christopher' which capitalized on the band's good looks in a black and white dreamy car wreck sequence with religious undertones.
