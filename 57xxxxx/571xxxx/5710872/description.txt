Release Notes:
Tagged this TC, due to being more likely being tc than any other source. Quite alot of ghosting, on source also.
lowered the contrast, tried to take the white spots away. tweaked the colors throughout, lowering some of that
horrid yellow, and giving some red and blue. Done some other bits also. looks pretty good to me. Sorry on delay, 
some of us have work. if anyone has any other audio for splice please get in touch. Thanks
