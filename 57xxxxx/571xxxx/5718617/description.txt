Yo, wassup everyone.
This is a bootleg (I guess not TECHNICALLY a bootleg, since this is free audio to begin with) of the Smashing Pumpkins playing live at Tower Records in Chicago the night before the release of Siamese Dream back in 1993. It was broadcasted live on a local radio station at the time, and some awesome person thought to record it. 

I found these recordings about a month ago, the tracks divided in strange places (two songs in one track, half a song in another, etc) and I decided to edit the tracks myself and get them all properly lined up, tagged, and ready for release. Here is a link to the unedited clips from the live show, so you can see what I mean:

It's highly recommended that you download this torrent rather than the original tracks, since the quality here is just as high as before it was edited, and all of the tracks are fixed for you. :) 

The only issue with these recordings is that the radio feed to the station was lost part-way through Disarm and picked up again a ways through Siva, so neither of those songs are complete. :( 

But anyway, seeing as it's the 17 year anniversary of this recording, I thought I would go ahead and start seeding it. 

Enjoy
