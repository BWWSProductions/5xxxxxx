It's very watchable, de audio is indeed out of sync and bits and pieces of russian audio in between, the sync stuff u can handle with VLC ,  - 0,300 did the trick for me.

eventhough the audio quality of the movie has some problems I enjoyed watching this movie very much... 

good flick, I spot a sequel coming up "
,Lokie76,2010-07-29T21:48Z,"Billy0827 & JC2010...???!!?!  This is Line audio.  

From Wikipedia: R5 DVDs may be released without an English audio track, requiring pirates to use the direct line audio from the film's theatrical release. In this case, the pirated release will be tagged with ""LiNE"" to distinguish it from a release with a DVD audio track."
