na.K. House Mix XIV - A Pink Floyd Mix (XXIV-VII-MMX)


Welcome back! House Mix XIV is finally complete and ready for the masses. Hope you guys like this one; some of my favourite tracks of the year are in this mix so listen closely to tracks by Faithless, EDX, David Tort & Norman Doray.  Pink Floyd has definitely been an influence of mine and there electronic contributions and innovations to music were outstanding.  I'll never forget the first time I heard tracks like "On the Run" or "Any Colour You Like".  Simply amazing is all I can say.  

Any way, I gotta run!  So enjoy the mix boys and girls. I know you'll love this one!  And before I forget, I'd like to say thank you for all your kind words and support since I started this project.  It means the world to me.  Keep smiling, keep dancing...... 


Cheers,
