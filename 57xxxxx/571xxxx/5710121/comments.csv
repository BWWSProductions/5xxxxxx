[T],ctang,2010-07-27T17:19Z,"one person seeding this great movie...wtf...i have posted this before but if only 11 people are downloading and 1 person seeding, dont expect me to reseed because as soon as i do and delete it off my computer there arent going to be any seeders anymore so whats the point...its as simple as just seeding...i know you people are living with 500gb hd's now so wtf"

,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-31T18:25Z,hey ctang please get my name on ice age 3...i don't have that one too....
