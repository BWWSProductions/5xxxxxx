Imagine that an astronaut goes through a space-time warp, bringing him home after 250
million years have passed on Earth. Continents are unrecognizable and every trace of
mankind has vanished. To envision what this spaceman would see, experts travel around the
world rediscovering our past in order to make predictions about the future. Asteroid
collisions, glaciations and sudden volcanism are what created our present world. What
natural forces may be responsible for our demise?
