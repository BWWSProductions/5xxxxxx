                                 : Uncovers the evidence that describes a 
                                   forced retreat by the Russians, not a 
                                   tactical one, in addition to much fiercer 
                                   fighting in the countryside than 
                                   previously thought. And the battle not only 
                                   changed the course of World War II, but 
                                   established the Soviet Union as a superpower 
                                   to be reckoned with in the long Cold War 
                                   that lay ahead. More than a half-century 
                                   later, the full impact of this horrific 
                                   battle is finally revealed.
