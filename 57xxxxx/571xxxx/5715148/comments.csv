Hopefully someone with 100% can jump on and make sure it all works out.  I'd hate for the torrent to get stuck at like 96% with no seeders.."
,ramafoz,2010-07-26T08:55Z,"@shadowphantom I'm seeding, but I have a really crappy internet connection and it seems that it went down for about half an hour in the middle of the night judging by the utorrent traffic graph, sorry. I'm from Spain and there is no good ISP's here.

Anyway, a few people have already completed the files, I hope them to stay seeding to help other peers."
,aldeez,2010-07-27T15:07Z,"mighty weird that ramafoz is like the only person in the torrent-verse to rip this into 550MB. No scene releases, nothing - only him. well, mad props if that really is the case. going to dl it, can't get it anyplace else and i'm really really tired of waiting. "
