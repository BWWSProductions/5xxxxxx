[T],FaMoUz,2010-07-28T07:33Z,hey on.off.on.. thnkz 4 tha torrent.. how do u convert ur movies to m4v with low Megabytes n itz still great quality.. kuz every time i convert a movie it resultz in 800MB or more if i want it 2 b great quality like thiz 1.. THNKZ again
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-28T10:55Z,@FaMoUz use a program that converts with the codec H264 and then set the video birate to a fixed size between 380-400. If you just use a preset where u choose quality you will get way too big files. so always set the birate manually =)
[T],FaMoUz,2010-07-29T04:00Z,kool i will try that out.. THNKZ 4 replyin back.. keep up tha good werk man.. u really deserve that skull...

,dlectro,2010-08-28T11:38Z,"Not only that it's crappy line audio, but it often switches to a different language audio so that you can't understand what the characters are talking about. Not worth it in my opinion."
