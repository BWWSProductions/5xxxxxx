"Injury List"

Tami (Connie Britton) must defend her job and her 
actions when a parent asks for her termination as 
principal of East Dillon. Elsewhere, Julie (Aimee 
Teegarden) starts making big plans for her future 
but gets an unexpected phone call that rocks her 
emotionally. Meanwhile, Tim (Taylor Kitsch) 
celebrates a big purchase with Becky (Madison 
Burge) and her mother as Luke (Matt Lauria) 
struggles with his injury and grows more desperate 
to appease the pain.

Enjoy :)
