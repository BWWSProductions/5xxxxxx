Candlemass From The 13th Sun Bonus FLAC 

These are the three tracks found on the vinyl only edition of From The 13th Sun, an amazing Candlemass disc in my book. In 

fact, a horribly under rated disc.

These tracks were recorded years after the CD came out as Lieif Edling wanted to release this material on double vinyl. The 

trouble was, he didn't have enough material for a double disc and the record companies refused to press it.

So, he gets in touch with Bjorn Floodquist (vocals), Jejo Perkovic (drums), and Mats Stahl and his wicked Gibson SG and they 

bang out these three tracks, thus fulfilling the time requirements for a 2 LP set.
