- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   If forced to describe Alaskan heavy metal unit 36 Crazyfists in just a single
   word, you might want to go with persistent. "Collisions and Castaways", the
   band's forthcoming second set for Ferret Music, was written and recorded
   between October 2009 and May 2010 and is scheduled for release July 27, 2010.
   It follows on the heels of last year's DVD outing, "Underneath a Northern
   Sky", and is the band's second straight effort to feature guitarist Steve
   Holt in the producer's chair and Andy Sneap handling the final mix.
