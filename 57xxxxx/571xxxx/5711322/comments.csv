,HoistPatard,2010-08-06T16:10Z,"You're all a bunch of cunts for stealing this, it's 10 bucks for crying out loud, if you're such fans why wouldn't support their efforts, Ok they've made money touring but this downloading malarkey really hurts the smaller fish and pioneers out there who won't be able to put out more music because they're too busy bussing tables to pay the rent while the mainstream 'bilge water' music industry goes on with corporate partnering and arena filling vacuousness. At least half of all you illegal downloads are pointless because you don't properly listen to any of it, try investing yourselves in just the stuff that appeals to you and commit to buying some stuff, trust me, your life will improved."
,HoistPatard,2010-08-06T16:15Z,"Nice one pirate bay, you filter any negative criticism out of the comments, you soulless fucks, thanks for making the world a worse place."
,storytellerx,2010-08-07T16:12Z,"@ HoistPatard: I'll buy the CD too -- why not urge people to do likewise, instead of dissing everyone who wants an advance listen?"
,evildrugmonkey,2010-08-08T11:37Z,I wrestled with my concience before i downloaded this. I do feel like a cunt ripping of a class band like this. But i thought here i am on minimum wage and these fuckers prob have way more spendings than me so i thought fuck it!
,Deus3xMachina,2010-08-08T23:32Z,"Hoist pirate, I'm down to my last $100,000, so fuck right off."
,luv2bleed,2010-08-09T18:29Z,"put it too ya like this Douche Patard....
if EVERY band made music purely to acquire currency... wouldnt they just STOP making music due to TPB and Napster & similar shite??
But they DO NOT! ...Why you ask your stoopid self... FOR THE LOVE OF THE MUSIC!

jUST shut-up and enjoi the music... like you are not on here too???  "

,GrandmasterNox,2010-08-16T11:04Z,"I never would have heard of these guys in my life if it was not for TPB.  If I like it I will get of my fat lazy ass and buy it (not).  If I dont I dont loose any of my money, and the band surely doesnt loose any money, sounds like a win win for the both of us.  GOD I LOVE TPB. Long live TPB, Hip Hip Horay!!!"
,cheeken,2010-08-24T10:10Z,Great quality. Thanks man
,movieguy27,2010-09-03T00:47Z,@HoistPatard lol you big cry baby. why are you on this website if you get angry at people for downloading stuff? that's the whole POINT of this website. Get free media. duh. Find somewhere else to troll.
[T],reactor90,2010-09-05T16:22Z,"@HoistPatard Congrats on making an account and posting on a torrent, you are now linked to illegal downloading. moron"
,WarsandRumoursofWars,2010-09-12T18:43Z,"@HoistPatard
Less than 20% of famous bands even make profit from album sales. The point of the album is publicise, so people attend concerts, where the real money is made. And I agree with the others, you shouldn't have an account if you're just gonna troll."
,WarsandRumoursofWars,2010-09-12T18:46Z,Cheers for the download.
,DJjibbajabba,2010-09-21T00:36Z,I buy all this band's records on vinyl. What's wrong with downloading to have on mp3? HoistRetard Chumpster!
[V],FerraBit,2010-12-19T16:06Z,"Heard of the band for the first time today, 
article in the NYT.
Hope it's as entertaining as the comments here.

Peace Pirates

,tehmadcap,2011-01-04T11:15Z,@HoistPatard I find music on the net and buy it if I like it. Gone are the days of spending $30 on an album only to realise it sucks
,hancubus_15,2011-02-03T18:51Z,Please seed. Please. I'm at 99.99%

--------------------------

Brilliant comment, and I agree completely.  Saw them on the Brits, caught my ear, so let's hear what their studio work sounds like.  If I like it, I'll buy it (and quite possibly the backcatalog).  If I don't, then nothing lost.  Torrent sites force the artist to produce quality, instead of just a name."
,Spacepeanut,2011-05-28T07:55Z,Sounds fantastic. Thanks :D
,lovefromIndia,2011-09-10T18:56Z,Haven't heard them yet but downloading because  this album won Grammy
