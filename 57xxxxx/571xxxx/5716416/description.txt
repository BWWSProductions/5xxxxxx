:wumpscut:

:WUMPSCUT: is an electro-industrial project from Germany. It was founded in May of 1991 by Bavarian disc jockey Rudy Ratzinger (born June 3, 1966).

Ratzinger has always been the main creative force behind :wumpscut:, occasionally employing the help of others as guest artists. Ratzinger cites the influence of such bands as LeÃ¦ther Strip as his reason for making the transfer from DJing to recording music.
