It takes a special QuÃ©bec actor to write, direct and star in this excellent comedy of a middle class, overweight big mouth Elvis impersonator to cast a new light on the already tired subject. You can only feel sorry for this fat funny guy who lives the American dream of being Elvis (sort of like a modern day Fred Flinstone). Poulin is just a fantastic actor. His ability to make everyday common activities funny with his hilarious body language, comic timing and physical comedy has to be seen to be believed. To see him listening to a cassette of a recorded ballgame while on the beach is just precious, or to see his wife trying to squeeze him in his already too tight Elvis costume in the kitchen is simply gut splitting funny. From a Hawaiian themed winter community dinner that goes wrong to his trouble with the snowblower, its a gag every minute. With a great supporting cast and location shooting. One small problem...much of the humour can only be understood if you understand QuÃ©becois french.

Considered a Canadian comedy classic, this underrated film could be considered the quintessential Canadian film, as it's subject matter and social commentary helps define us as "...that country up north".
