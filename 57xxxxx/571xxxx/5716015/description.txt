IMAGiNE NOTES
Source used was a dvd6 that had a full set of english subs added ....there wasn't any grp tag so, thanks to whoever :)
Now the source quailty ... was badly interlace and colouring off and was also not very sharp. Audio was nice and seemed to be in sync.
Work done.....well firstly we took the english.srt file and remove 100's of lines that wasn't needed and left those that was and resaved it.
Then we made a small script to crop, resize, white balance, rgb eq, sharpness, brightness, contrast and a smoother and drop it into vdub.
Now we've noticed through out the film the colouring changes ... sometimes gets a tint of green come and go ... nothing major though.
The audio we just remuxed the original AC3 audio track back to it.

Yes we know there are loads of encodes already and we wasn't going to do this but were asked by several users and once we got the dvd6, we thought sod it and did one :P
