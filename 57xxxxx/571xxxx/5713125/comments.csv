,retardoface,2010-08-28T06:45Z,can anyone confirm that this is legit?
,tribhuvanji,2010-10-26T23:15Z,"Thanks for this. So far I listened to 'WYWH' and it's beautiful this way. Thanks for taking all the time for doing this - I'm sure you enjoyed it though...
Can you share what the equipment used in making the transfers was ie: TT/Cartrige/Pre ?
THANKS AGAIN"
,tribhuvanji,2010-11-07T19:45Z,"OK - from careful listening I believe the equipment is:

Class status vinyl - MINT
Playback device - Denon DP-300F, head - Denon DL-304
Pre-amplifier - Built-in - TASCAM HD-P2 ADC - TASCAM HD-P2 - Processing - Nuendo 3. Removed large clicks (manually).
No equalizer, maximizers, shumodavov not applied
24/96 Recording Format (Bit / kHz) - 24/96 (Bit/kHz) - 24/96 Distribution format

A little extra shumodavov never hurts..."
,evanparker2134,2011-02-15T12:51Z,I noticed that there is some hiss on some tracks.
,evanparker2134,2011-02-15T12:55Z,"Hiss that is normally on some of these, but it is much louder on these tracks. Perhaps this is indicative of the condition of the LPs. Perhaps it also has something to do with the fact that some rips are much louder than other sources (ex: AHM)."
