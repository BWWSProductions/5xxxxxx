is using
the latest build 

version:1.30.6027 1.52"
,StealthB,2010-09-25T10:28Z,"I downloaded and played it. JCOVE is better, which is exactly the same, only instead of US Army, the Royal Army is depicted. I like the American scopes on rifles more, but the British have planes in JCOVE. Just google JCOVE and you'll find it free (and legal) to download."
