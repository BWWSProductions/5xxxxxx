Wes Montgomery recorded exclusively for the Riverside label during the four years covered by this massive 12-CD box set and, although his later albums for Verve and particularly the pop/jazz A&M dates sold many more copies, it is from his Riverside dates that his legacy was primarily formed. Virtually unknown at the time of his debut on Riverside, Montgomery soon became a major influence whose style is still copied decades later. The guitarist is heard in quite a few different settings here: in trios with organist Melvin Rhynbe and a quartet with pianist Tommy Flanagan; as a sideman on different sessions with Nat Adderley, Harold Land, and Cannonball Adderley; performing with his brothers, Buddy  and Monk; holding his own with pianist George Shearing, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, and tenor great Johnny Griffin; and (for an album ironically titled Fusion) playing with strings for the first time. All in all, there is a tremendous amount of rewarding performances included in this essential set, most of which show why Wes Montgomery is still considered one of the all-time great jazz guitarists.

 A while ago I found here a torrent featuring a compilation of this Wes Mongomery 12 CD set. It is a fantastic compilation which fits nicely in a single CD (you can find it in the following link).

 I liked it so much that I wanted to have the complete 12 CD set, so I searched for it in other torrent sites and found this torrent. I'm indexing it so people can find it here in piratebay too.
 
 I dindt create it, nor encoded the files; Its mp3 and the quality is quite good.
