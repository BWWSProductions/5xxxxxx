,coreyduck,2010-07-26T01:53Z,Is this one working for anybody?
,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-07-26T15:48Z,"If you are having ANY problems getting it working, please let me know. This is a repatch of the versions that are already on TPB. The other Roms would load past the Customization screen but freeze hours into the game during cutscenes. I have now played the game completely through on this patch with no problems running an Acekard2i and Akaio 1.7 with the loader updated."
,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-07-26T22:33Z,"If the rom works for you, please state it in the comments section and what card you are working with."
,kazuya82,2010-07-27T06:44Z,Was able to create a character and a quick save. So works better then other copies. Using no$gba 2.6a.

,OMFGITSICARUS,2010-08-10T18:08Z,Disable Auto patching and soft reset functions under options for that rom and try it again.
