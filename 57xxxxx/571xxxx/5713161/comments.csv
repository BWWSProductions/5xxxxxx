points out

 You dont need 3d glasses to watch this version. The video and audio both are pretty nice for a dvdscr and very watchable, i will give A7 and V8."
,geoflcl,2010-07-26T18:59Z,"Definitely watchable, yup. Seeding as we speak. The sound is probably the weakest point, as it sounds sort of like an aged VHS tape's would sound, but DEFINITELY still watchable if you can't wait for a DVDrip."
