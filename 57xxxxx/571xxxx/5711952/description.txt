Full recording of the Lady Gaga concert (Monster Ball 2) from Boston on July 1st, 2010.

Artist: "Lady Gaga"
Album: "2010.07.01 - Boston Monster Ball"
Date: "2010"
Genre: "Pop"

Recording not made by me, I'm just circulating it. [torrent-ifying the originalsource]

Camera-microphone recording made from the upper-level seats. Evidently that camera has a really good microphone, all things considered.

The numbers preceding the song name in the filename are based on it being one disc, but the disc/track numbers I put in the metadata are based on the show as filling 2 CDs.

This is a pretty good recording in general, but it's special to me because it's bootleg of a show that I myself went to aswell.
