New(ish) project from Optimus Ryhme frontman Wheelie Cyberman.  It might fall under nerdcore.  I've also heard it described as "8-bit sci fi hip hop".  So...whatever.  If you like it, buy the shit because all of the money goes to Cild's Play, a charity that connects gamers and sick kids and hooks the kids up with video games (that includes their T-shirts as well).  Enjoy.
