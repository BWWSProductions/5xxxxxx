SHINee had everyone's ears ringing last year with their dance smash Ring Ding Dong, and now they've got everyone buzzing about their second album Lucifer. The noona favorites are all grown up with hot new looks for their catchy urban electronica dance song Lucifer. The album is packed with 13 new songs including the old-school hip-hop tune UP & DOWN, the melancholic rock ballad Quasimodo, R&B ballad Life by Kenzie, and Love Still Goes On, a sequel to the SHINee's first album hit Love Should Go On. The members also participated in the songwriting this time, with Onew penning Your Named and Jong Hyun penning Shout Out.
