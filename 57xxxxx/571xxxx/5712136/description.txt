If you only know Jeff Garlin from CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, you are missing out.


Now, with JEFF GARLIN: YOUNG AND HANDSOME, he returns to how it all began for him, stand up.

Filmed in 2008 in Chicago, Garlin takes the stage to do an almost hour long set talking about himself. He discusses his weight, his wife, caulk, celebrities like Kid Rock and Peter Cetera, and much more.

This is less of a stand up film than it is just Garlin telling stories. And he is a great storyteller.
