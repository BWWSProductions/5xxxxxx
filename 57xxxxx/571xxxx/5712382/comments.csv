,Kapri25,2010-10-10T08:23Z,"Downloaded. It works but it seems that it is the ""free"" version. Could have done something wrong (probably did) but when I run it it says I am using the free version and I should upgrade to pro. Any ideas on where I went wrong?"

,akira900gt,2010-11-18T03:35Z,"this version doesn't work because some jackass registered it. tried opening an mkv file and it comes up with a message ""liscensed to me and only me"". thanks to the idiot who ruined it for everyone else."
,emo1987,2010-11-27T19:35Z,thanks works great 
,moorebounce,2011-01-31T10:04Z,It freezes right before the burning process. It sucks that it doesn't work but at least it doesn't ruin the DVDs before doing it.

I used a firewall to prevent the software to connect to the internet and I have disabled automatic updates (Tool> Options)!

Muito obrigado... funcionou que é uma maravilha!
