,LonerGoth,2010-07-27T14:54Z,"No joking with my question, Do they all work on say, r4 and original DS?

Like, to make sure you understand me, is there a reason for me to buy a ds Lite and an r4? 
Or should I get a DSi/xl and whatever the hell lets me play pirated games upon it?"

,raymond_cott,2010-08-12T21:36Z,I picked out a few games and they worked no problem. I have a DSi and a DS lite with M3 Zero Sakura. Those cards are Awsome.
,raymond_cott,2010-08-12T21:42Z,I downloaded a few games and they all worked on my DSi and DS Lite using M3 Zero Sakura.
