Comments:

F&F 1 - DVD rip, not Bluray. A=7 V=8
F&F 2 - Bluray rip. A=10 V=9.5
F&F 3 - DVD rip, not Bluray. A=0 V=8.5
F&F 4 - DVD rip, not Bluray. A=10 V=8.5

FYI for those of you using the universal answer to all problems video and audio of ""download and watch it with VLC Player"": not everyone here downloads and watches movies on their computers. Personally, both my LCD TVs are networked using built-in decoders to play streaming movies and video. Both are pretty good at decoding poorly encoded video and audio, but only to a point. I'm uploading this to my NAS server now to check Tokyo Drift on my televisions to see if the audio works or not. Nevertheless, if I have to use a very specific video player to watch a movie, that tells me that there is clearly a problem with the encoding and that the OP should fix and re-post the torrent.

I'm just sayin'.

Again, thank you PetaFOX for the torrent. Now I can catch up before seeing FF5."
,Picky_Picky,2011-05-02T20:36Z,"Okay, I need to make a few corrections to my previous post. The are all indeed Bluray rips. It appears that the studio's transfer from their source media to the Bluray format varies significantly from one movie to the next. F&F 2 is clearly the best master transfer.

On both my LG and Samsung LCD televisions, F&F3 Tokyo Drift streamed fine, audio included. 

Audio for F&F 1 was not as blown out as when played on a PC but still not as good as the others. Again, may be a source movie issue.

I'm going to bump my ratings.

F&F 1 - Bluray rip. A=8 V=8.5
F&F 2 - Bluray rip. A=10 V=9.5
F&F 3 - Bluray rip. A=10 V=9
F&F 4 - Bluray rip. A=10 V=9

Nicely done PetaFOX!"

It's a BRRip.
Not full Blueray.
The source is still Blueray.
The internet. It's owned by idiots."
,-Cortex-,2011-05-26T14:35Z,"@Archonin
'BRRips' are actually sourced form encodes of blurays. Yes, the original source was bluray, but the final result was encoded from an encode of a bluray.

Bluray Disk > BDRip (scene denotes as 'Bluray') > BRRips"
