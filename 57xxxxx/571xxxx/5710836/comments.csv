There are a number of designs of revolutionary engines , ray guns , flying saucers , vertical take off aircraft shown in this show all of which had one thing in common.
They DIDN'T work.

In the concluding comments of this program  they try to convince you that the lack of production of these weapons was due to the poor leadership of Hitler.

That fact though is that these things were not built because they were of flawed and unworkable designs.

Perhaps these designs were deliberately generated and leaked to spies in order to instil fear in the allies, in order to mislead them into thinking that the enemy was much more advanced than they really were.

Or perhaps they were an attempt of the scientists to show their superiors that they are developing something new , when in reality they were doing nothing ... who knows.

The fact remains , the only thing that Hitlers cronies produced was practical rocketry and jet engines.
This was applied to both aircraft and to bombs.
Nothing new here , nothing revolutionary , just the same basic motor principles applied to different types of aircraft.

There is a big jump in the reality of jet engines for aircraft  , across to invisible ray guns and flying saucers."
