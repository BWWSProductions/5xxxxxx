Music: Classical : MP3/Variable

This 1992 Naxos CD features their "in-house" pianist, the ubiquitous Jeno Jando, who has made hundreds of recordings for the label over the years. Jando is something of a Beethoven specialist, or so I assume going by the nature of this excellent performance. The sound quality, by the way, is very good, so no worries on that score.

The CD contains four works, the first of these being the "Eroica Variations", Op.35. Written in 1802, these variations are based on themes from Symphony 3 and the ballet "The Creatures of Prometheus". The theme and the 15 variations are finished off with a brilliant fugue and constitute one of Beethoven's best piano works. Second, we have 32 Variations on an Original Theme in C Minor, WoO 80. This is 11 minutes of pianistic virtuosity played very well by Jando.

The 1802 6 Variations in F Major, Op.34 are striking and certainly keep their interest. The last work is WoO 70, six further variations.
