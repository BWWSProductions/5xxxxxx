Salsoul Records

Salsoul Records is a New York City based record label founded by brothers Joe Cayre, Ken Cayre, and Stanley Cayre. From 1974 to 1985, Salsoul released about 300 disco 12-inch singles, and a string of albums. Artists such as Instant Funk, Loleatta Holloway, Carol Williams, Jocelyn Brown, Double Exposure, First Choice, Joe Bataan, the Salsoul Orchestra (led by Vincent Montana Jr), Inner Life, Skyy, and Charo were at one time part of their roster.

Salsoul released the first commercially available 12-inch single, Double Exposure's Ten Percent, in 1976. Salsoul Records also manufactured and distributed Gold Mind Records' output. Because of the resurgent interest prompted by Marky Mark and Black Box recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the label's catalogue has been digitally remastered. It is notably more popular in Europe and the United Kingdom than in the United States.

The label's name was conceived by artist Joe Bataan, who recorded some of the earliest sessions for the Cayre brothers (predating the label's formation). "Salsoul" was street lingo for the musical culture of urban Latinos who were absorbing African-American popular music and infusing into their own culture, as well as vice-versa. Bataan had chosen the name for an LP he made for the Cayre brothers.
