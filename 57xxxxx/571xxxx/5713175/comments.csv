,ElDigato,2011-01-20T14:41Z,"Return to blockland 1.045 is a modification of Vanilla Blockland (blockland v0002), the prototype of Retail Blockland. It was a free online lego game where you could build with legos. Return to blockland adds many features to the game including the ability to stretch bricks. Also:

250 Bricks
15 Maps
20 Weapons
4 Vehicles
Endless ways to build

Ever since retail came out in Febuary 2007, the community has died out. Nowadays few people play and it's uncommon to find plenty of people. But don't give up! Help make the game big."
