"Blood In The Water" is the first offical release from The Bastards Of Apocalypse. The album is a far from perfect record. "Don't Drink The Water" and "Sweet River" are full of pops and scratches from poor recording and the levels of both songs are off quite a bit. Though the album does contain the myspace hit "The Surf" and the sludgy ambient title track "Blood In The Water." A first recording but it set the grounds for every record to follow.
