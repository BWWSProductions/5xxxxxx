As for criticism:
1. In some books (The Cat n the Hat for example) there isn't back cover page.
2. I would want double-page view for all pages except front and back covers."

,jodjod,2011-06-16T00:31Z,"There is, but it's a very slow sort of future. Another collection in the next couple months, I think."

Wow, I had no idea there was so much activity here.

My effusive thanks to beta999 for recreating the Vol 1 torrent--I don't know why or how it vanished--and to everyone seeding it.

Here's an update on where I am:

The following books are complete: Marvin K Mooney, Will You Please Go Now!; The Shape of Me and Other Stuff; Oh, The Thinks You Can Think!

The following books are much or most of the way toward complete: Horton Hears a Who!; Happy Birthday to You!; One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish; Green Eggs and Ham; The Lorax; Oh, the Places You'll Go!

The following books are scanned, but not much more: The Sneetches and Other Stories; Fox in Socks; The Butter Battle Book.

The actual time it takes to complete any of them varies wildly, based on everything from the kind of art used in the book (pen and ink translates to the screen more easily than pencil or watercolor) to the tightness of the binding on the copy I scanned (pages that flatten more fully require less touching-up in the middle). And I work on whatever keeps my attention at the time, when I have time. So I can't be any more precise in predictions at the moment.

For various long-winded and tedious reasons, though, I won't be able to pull together even what I have done for at least a month; but I think I can promise a fourth collection by spring. My gratitude to everyone who's enjoyed them so far."
