This is a third collection of scans of Dr Seuss's children's books, which are unfortunately quite hard to find online. (You can find plenty of audiobooks, but that misses half the point; and plenty of live-action films, but that misses the whole point.) These have been rather laboriously scanned, touched up and fixed and recolored till (hopefully) they sparkle on the screen the way the books do for children. Anyway, I hope you enjoy them. Included here are the following five books:

    *4.  The Seven Lady Godivas (1940)
    *12. On Beyond Zebra! (1955)
    *14. How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957)
    *15. The Cat in the Hat (1957 BB1)
    *25. I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew (1965)

A complete bibliography is included. The files are in .cbz format: "comic book archives." You can find a number of free viewers for these online.
