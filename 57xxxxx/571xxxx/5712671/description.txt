Naked Science: Swallowed by the Sun

Over billions of years, our sun is transforming into a red giant. We'll show you what will happen as the polar caps melt and raise the oceans 200-plus feet, mega-storms hundreds of miles wide lash Earth and all evidence of our civilization finally melts away as temperatures exceed 2,500 degrees. Using dramatic CGI animations, NGC brings a glimpse of this frightening future to life.
