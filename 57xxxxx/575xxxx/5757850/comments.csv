[V],globeplus,2010-08-12T17:49Z,"to cooperdk : it is more fast from here they have lot of less size than downloading from steam beside that sometimes they say to the user to wait because they can´t processing the request at that moment and that can happen with a certain frequence , so i really don´t know what is the more fast to download if it is from steam or from here and watch your language if you don´t mind it is not case for talking like that . thank you ."

[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T03:51Z,"i didnÂ´t get it but it looks like the demo folder after the conversion work must be at the exact location she have on steam because the data register information that steam have on the moment of the downoad and probably with the correct name of the folder , so please who not running the demo try this : change the name of the demo folder to : mafia ii - public demo , exactly as you read then move the demo folder with this name to the next location : programs or programs (x86) depeding in where the steam is installed and if it xp , vista or 7 the oprative system then steam\steamapps\common\ and at the common folder inside the steam installtion put the demo folder with the refered name finally open the pc folder on the demo folder and run the Mafia2.exe and i think can really work , my only doubt is if the steamapi.dll can cause a inconvenience but maybe not , please try this and tell me if it work like this , write the correct name on the demo folder then move the demo folder to the designated location and run the demo from there and please in case of try this suggestion tell me if it worked because i have a little about the dll . thank you and try this ."

,kaitoukid44,2010-08-17T11:51Z,"so can i play this without login or using steam?

i already have the DEMO and i`m using DeepFreeze if you know what it is so everytime i restart my computer even if i backup my Registry on Steam still there's a find is missing which i can't find it manually so what well happen is i redownload the DEMO just to create a registry or something file for 1MB after that i repaste the early finished DEMO so basically  STEAM can resume the DEMO to Complete and i can play it again, 

if i restart without doing this i can't play the DEMO cause yeah there's some missing but i can't risk turning off the DeepFreeze thing i am Virus free when Deepfreeze is On ;D"
,khalids19,2010-08-18T15:04Z,"I extracted nicely,used the globe converter with link specified and copied those two folders music n video to Sds folder renamed Mafia demo folder to mafia ii - public demo , copied folder to steamapps/common folder but still not working i think the steam dll file really causes inconvinience because it isnt woking its saying MafiaII Application stopped working!!!!!!!!!!!"
