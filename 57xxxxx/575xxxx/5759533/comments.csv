,FSjock1,2010-08-17T10:03Z,TONS of gauges missing from the VC panel.
,ligglwe,2010-08-17T22:28Z,"There are some issues with this compilation, but I appreciate you putting it together. Those missing gauges, need to get the 777-330 gauge from fs2004."
,raybob4321877,2010-08-19T05:38Z,"I also noticed a few places where the textures are missing, but realize that Opensky hasn't done any gauges other than the 3 most basic ones (the ADI, HSI, and Engine Panel).

Where it's clear, it should be black, but there never were any gauges there.

Also, I cannot guarantee compatibility with FS2004."
