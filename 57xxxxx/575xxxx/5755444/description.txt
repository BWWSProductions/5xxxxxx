In real life DJ King Pigeon may be cowardly and craven*, but his DJ sets are a different matter. Fiery celebrations of everything we love about the European pop music scene and representing an impressive array of genres, decades, countries, and languages, each King Pigeon DJ set is a gilded whoopie cushion of fun.

* a word that means "cowardly"
