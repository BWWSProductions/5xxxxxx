I am thinking about maybe trying it for my Bi-Polar, after a talk with my doctor of course. I know it is legal where I am. Anyways, I leave you with something to think about, BTW you can email me with your response @ the email in the Nfo. "

It's called Holy Basil. Take 2 to 3 at a time as needed. It will do you so much better than pharmaceuticals which can cause other imbalances.
A company called New Chapter makes a good quality one. Best of luck."
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-11T06:34Z,"@ Lovejam - thanks for your response, I will look in to Holy Basil. (^_^)


@ Everyone, I have confirmed that my encodes work on Western Digital TV Media Player and XBOX360 and they look good. They have not been tested on PS3, if someone who be so kind as to test if on the PS3 via a flashdrive. I believe they will work but I do not have a PS3, and my neighbor that has one has moved. I would be very pleased. (^_^) "
