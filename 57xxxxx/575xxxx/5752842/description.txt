Show Nfo - This show comes on HBO - 
In this sitcom, the suddenly risen film star Vince Chase, a \\\'jeune premier\\\' of humble origins, learns the ropes of the business and the the high-profile world of the wealthy happy few in and around Hollywood, but not alone: he brings form his native New York his atypical \\\'entourage (hence the title), not glitterati or professionals but a close circle of friends since childhood, and his professional agent finds they often make his job harder as the Queens boys not only sponge on the star but also have his ear, so Vince is much harder to counsel.
