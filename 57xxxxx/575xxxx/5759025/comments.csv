,bubblestimer,2011-09-11T07:55Z,"kamidamnit!  i freakin got a DMCA infringement notice, because of this BLEACH torrent (hash: 9c94ddba290011090c42c3af93d7bdc586b46ba1) ...  my ISP (suddenlink), killed my connection to the net until i read the damn notice which said that TV TOKYO uses BayTSP, which saw that i used this torrent (i don't know what tracker those BayTSP bastards were monitoring) ...  if everyone that got a damn notice from BayTSP could comment on which hash of a torrent that got them in trouble, and possible any tracker that might be involved, that would help us avoid the flagged torrents.  Thanks!  

P.S.  all i wanted was to check the quality of just 4 episodes from this torrent, and got freakin nailed.  "
