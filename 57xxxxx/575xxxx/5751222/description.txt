BBC Radio Collection The Second World War

From Neville Chamberlain's historic declaration
of war in Germany in 1939 to the sounds of
rejoicing crowds on VJ Day in August 1945,
the BBC brought the full picture of both the
battle front and the home front, as well as the
major speeches, to an attentive nation.
The strident sounds of battle, the stirring and
inspiring words of Churchill, Montgomery and
Roosevelt, reached every sitting room. News
and information about the war - in all it's
ramifications - was brought home with the
rawness and immmediacy of these original
reports.
This unique chronicle of war recordings,
preserved for over 40 years, is both a
testament to the BBC War Correspondents and
a rare document in history.

Uploader's note
A double cassette audo book featuring 127 clips
spread over 4 sides and around 2 hours long.
My inlay card for this is in bad condition.
Completely unfolded it reveals 8 sides of text
which includes a list of the 127 clips,
divided into the 4 sides with a line or two
of information about each clip.
Brings back memories of vinyl LP liner notes!
I thought the best way to include the whole
inlay was to scan the 8 sides of text along
with it's outside front and back.
Then make a .pdf layed out in order to read
from start to end.
But as I said the inlay is in bad condition.
I actually used 'Paint' on some areas!
Sometimes this was to tidy it up and
others because I had to fill in missing areas!
There might be some parts of the text that
prove difficult to read.
