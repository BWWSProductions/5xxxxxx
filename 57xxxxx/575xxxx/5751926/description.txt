The Final Frontier is British heavy metal band Iron Maiden's upcoming fifteenth studio album, 
set for release on August 16, 2010. At 76 minutes and 34 seconds, 
it is the band's longest studio album to date. 
It will be their first album since the release of A Matter of Life and Death in 2006, 
the longest gap to date between two consecutive Iron Maiden studio albums. 
The North American leg of their tour in support of the album started in Dallas, Texas on June 9, with a European tour beginning in Dublin on July 30, and further dates to be announced.
Melvyn Grant, a long-time contributor to the band's artwork, created the cover art for the album.
