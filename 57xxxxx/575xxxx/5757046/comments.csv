I'm stuck around 80% but I've got enough to play the file, and this is the best copy available. The lighting has a minor pulsing/flickering effect, but the picture is very clear overall. Thanks, aoksquad.

This will do until a DVDrip shows up. Now we just need more seeders."

Good Screener beats any cams out there but might wait for a dvd-rip."

,Sloanybug,2010-08-25T14:29Z,"I am stuck in a deadly, James Bondish trap and the only way to disarm it is to play a specific section in Iron Man 2, CONNOR66 !!"

,sat_sonic,2010-08-31T03:29Z,"AN OKAY COPY BUT NOT A SCREENER!

SCREENER = Pre-release to some critic for viewing and commenting.  

SCREENERS are basically DVD quality.  This is a telesync, a pretty good copy; but still a telesync.  I recommend waiting for the DVDRIP on this movie.  "
