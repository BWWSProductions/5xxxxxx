Tekno Comix was a comic publisher that featured characters and situations created by celebrity authors and others, but were primarily scripted and illustrated by freelance comics creators.

The Tekno Comix brand was discontinued in 1997, though books featuring the same characters continued were published with Big Entertainment branding for the rest of that year.
