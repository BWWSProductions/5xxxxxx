300+ Penetration Testing Review Questions
eWorkbook - 725 pages Student eWorkbook developed by Shon Harris

Our training videos will show you how to scan, test, hack and secure your own systems. The intensive demonstrations give each student in-depth knowledge and practical experience with the current security systems. You will begin by understanding how perimeter defenses work and then be lead into scanning and attacking your own networks. You will then learn how intruders escalate privileges and what steps can be taken to secure a system. Students will also learn about Penetration Testing and Countermeasures, Intrusion Detection, Policy Creation, Social Engineering, DDoS Attacks, Buffer Overflows and Virus Creation.
