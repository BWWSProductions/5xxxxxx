BUT you can mount the bin and use windeows explorer and right clik the dribve and 'open' and browse to the video files. Not all snazzy and shit- but it seems to work. "

,alekseypalvai,2011-12-27T02:36Z,"I downloaded this torrent from windows, It displays files in Folder View. Unable to even check the type of file it is as properties option is missing from submenu. Tried to play through VLC Player ""Does'nt Work"". Tried to burn to CD "" Does'nt Work"" , try to click Explore "" Does'nt work"",... As uploader you should be knowing how to deal with these files. It would be very helpful for others if you write this information. As I could see from comments that none who downloaded were able to open & use this torrent. "
