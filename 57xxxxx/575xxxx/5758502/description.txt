All nine of Lady Gaga's own music videos, and the two on which she featured (Chillin' and Video Phone)

Bad Romance, Alejandro, Chillin' and Video Phone are .m4v format.
The other seven are in .flv format. (from the videos section of the The Fame Monster USB)

I used "track numbers" in the folder to put the videos in chronological order of their release.
