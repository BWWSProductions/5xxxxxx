   [ Release Information ]  

 Edmonton-Calgary. NHL: 1984 Division Final Game 7. A historic NHL
 Flashback from the NHL Archives.


   [ Release Notes ]  

 Keep in mind that the PDTV-quality doesn't really shine in this
 one since the source material is from 1984. And with that said;
 enjoy some old school NHL with Gretzky and Messier.

 we will post more specific information about that here.
