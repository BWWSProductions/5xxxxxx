Mongrels is a British puppet-based situation comedy series first broadcast on BBC Three between 22 June and 10 August 2010, with a making-of documentary entitled "Mongrels Uncovered" broadcast on 11 August 2010. The series revolves around the lives of five anthropomorphic animals who hang around the back of a pub in the Isle of Dogs, London. The characters are Nelson, a metrosexual fox (voiced by Rufus Jones); Destiny, a pretentious self-absorbed Afghan hound (Lucy Montgomery); Marion, a "borderline-retarded" cat (Dan Tetsell); Kali, a grudge-bearing pigeon (Katy Brand); and Vince, a sociopathic foul-mouthed fox (Paul Kaye).

The show is aimed at an adult audience, and features "neutering, incontinence, cannibalism and catnip overdoses." The first episode begins with a scene in which Marion's cat friends eat their recently deceased owner. Mongrels has attracted accusations of plagiarism, with claims that Mongrels stole ideas from a similar Channel 4 show called Pets.
