@Horrorspoke
Haven't downloaded this so can't comment on quality. But everything else u have uploaded works so there is no reason to believe that this one is fake. Its just dicks like lonnie who obviously work for some company trying to stop piracy that piss me off by trying to screw up ur computer with links to viruses n shit."
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-08-10T21:42Z,Well said MINZEZ!!
,MINZEZ,2010-08-11T14:37Z,"Thanks Horror. Ive downloaded it now.
Quality
A:6
V:5
My reason for this is because of the flickering and the mad camera angle that happens every now and then. If it wasn't for that then it would be higher. But overall it is watchable. At least the best I have seen so far.
Thanks for uploading it anyway."
,XHolyXMarilyn,2010-08-20T03:00Z,thanks horror! speedy download!
,IBlest,2010-09-22T12:33Z,"just finished downloading it scanned though quickly. Seem be 7/8v 8a being that not dvdrip, but best I've seen to watch the movie. So recommend this 1. Thanks to the person or people that did this. "
