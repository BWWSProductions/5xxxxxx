John Denver made his film debut with this wonderful wholesome comedy. He plays an ordinary supermarket worker who is honest and straightforward. He has a loving wife and 2 kids. God, out of the blue, picks him to spread the Word. Everyone is sceptical as Jerry Landers (Denver) tries to make believers out of them. George Burns was a perfect choice to play the Almighty. John Denver doesn't sing in this film, but still comes off as an honest (if somewhat naive) person. The car he drives is definitely a 70's relic (the Pacer, I miss those!). Watching the scenes with just Burns and Denver strikes me as sad because they are no longer with us. The film is not too preachy (a plus in my book) and puts just a hint of humor in it all (like the courtroom scene).
