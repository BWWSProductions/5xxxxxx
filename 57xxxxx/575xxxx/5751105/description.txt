Greetings,

For players who prefer Japanese audio with English subs, then this is for you.
Patched using Dissidia VOST-UNDUB By Sephizack. All credits to him.

What are the advantages?
- The Japanese dubbers involve more in their role, it gives more realistic characters.
- The Japanese dubbers are more meaningful, what has the effect of increasing the dynamism of the game.
- The dubbing is the original, thus the one with which the game has been created, it thus corresponds to it better.
From Sephizack

You will be playing the US Version of the game with audio from the original Japanese Version. Therefore, all the added cinematics in the US Version that were not in the original Japanese Version will be in English audio. But that only constitutes a very little part of the game.

Works on GEN-D3. Your savedata from US Version also work on this.
This has nothing to do with Universal Tuning version.

Any questions/comments below

SEED & ENJOY!!!
