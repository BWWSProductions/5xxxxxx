Test build for Android-x86 2.2 (Froyo-x86) on virtual machine.
The iso is intended for vm only (virtual box, qemu, vmware, ...). It may not work on any other real x86 machine.

Key Features

Kernel 2.6.32.9
Audio support for ICH AC97 and SB16
Ethernet support
Mouse cursor
Persistent mode
Some 3rd party apps updated

In this build I add a special experimental mode for testing purpose. In this mode the system still boots from the iso and runs like a live CD, but it saves settings and user data to a Linux ext3 partition on the (virtual) harddisk. It also emulates a sdcard by a fat partition on the harddisk. Therefore, you don't need to install android-x86 to the harddisk, but all data are persistent. So I call it the persistent mode.
