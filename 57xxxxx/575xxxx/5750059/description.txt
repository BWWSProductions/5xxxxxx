Release Notes:
Well.....we know this moving is showing on ppv in usa, so we decided to cam our tv of it  for those who don't get the
ppv, we don't hae the equipment to cap it our selves or knowledge. Anyway, so we cammed our 1080p LCD TV, with a HD 1080p
camera...came out pretty good , tweaked some colours and some other random stuff. Sorry don't know what as crack encoded
this one but didn't send nfo  lazy Anyway we had to resync the audio as it didn't go with the video at all....
anyway we did encode a 700mb version of this, but it was blocky due to action scenes...so here's 1.4gb version which aint
blocky , just remember we had to pay 10 bucks
