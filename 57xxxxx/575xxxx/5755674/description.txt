The film is the third installment of the popular gangster comedy series.
The members from the second installment teamed up once again for the new film, including director Jeong Yong-ki and actors Shin Hyeon-joon, Kim Won-hee and Kim Soo-mi, bringing little that is new since the second film.
The story takes off with the family matriarch, Mrs. Hong, her star prosecutor daughter-in-law and the rest of the family launching a kimchi-making business after putting an end to their days of organized crime.
But they face a crisis as their enemies prepare to take revenge on the Hongs.
This time around, the enemy is Myoung-Phil, a disgraced former prosecutor who was jailed for corruption and whose sole purpose is to the Jang family. What the legal weasel doesnâ€™t know is that Mama Jang has family members all over the country and like THE WARRIORS, theyâ€™re ready to come out and play. Can Mama Jang and the boys overcome their latest enemy and restore the family glory?
