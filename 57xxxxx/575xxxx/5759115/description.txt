In "Burnfield", a fictional suburb of Austin, TX, five young adults who have nothing to do with their lives, decide to hang out at "the corner" outside of a convenience store one night. On the same night, their friend, the only successful member of the group, now a rock star, has returned to his hometown to revisit his old stomping grounds. The friends hang out and talk about inane subjects, while realizing that they've been wasting away their lives doing nothing. They each want to make something of themselves, but ultimately, few of them do.
