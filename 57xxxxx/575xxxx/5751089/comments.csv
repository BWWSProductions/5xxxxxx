As of 10th August 2010 there are three R5 LINE versions of this film, and this MAGNET release seems to use the same audio as the TANK release, which yes, everyone is moaning that the audio warbles. 
I can only suggest trying the third release from PRISM.

R5 LINE releases can only be praised for the hard work and effort that goes into preparing and releasing them, often many, many weeks before anything official is publicly released.
Sometimes minor quality issues have to be tolerated, as if there was anything better out there the guys would have used it if they could!
Credit to all involved. 
R5 releases are a gift to all who choose to receive them!
