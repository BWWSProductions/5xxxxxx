[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
For an r5 it was pretty nice quality, little noise, colours slightly off but seemed pretty good...Tweaked the colors
just slightly. Light video denoise, didn't add any sharpness because i tried to keep the size pretty small as short 
runtime. Audio is line from the Tank Release (Thanks) Synced to ours leaving the full credits intact....Enjoy
