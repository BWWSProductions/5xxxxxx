,wombat001,2010-08-20T11:53Z,"hail to THE MAN. Hey mkvguy love your work and am a huge fan. I'm from australia so most of your rips on new movies are still in cinemas here, so great stuff for me, lol. I have downloaded over 20 titles from you and man can't fault you. Keep it up. I've only just joined pirate bay though.
 Just a small request if you can, when you can:
     - Grown Ups
  and my kids are also huge fans and would love to request:
    - Toy Story 3
    - Shrek Forever After
  Thx again man!!!"
,wira020,2010-08-20T14:32Z,"One of the worst and most confusing psychological movie i've watched... but i had to watch it to the end in hoping that i could understand it somehow... and in the end... i'm more freakin confused.. Justin Longman seriously shouldnt act in a serious movie like this.. he just doesnt fit..

The rip quality however, is perfect.. both audio n video is great.."
