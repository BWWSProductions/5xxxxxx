[color=violet][b]Paper Ninja is an Action Strategy First Person Slasher. It is designed so that players can feel the thrill of a sword-fight by using a finger. Just like sword fighting, it is easy to pickup but difficult to master.

The game play is simple - Just avoid the Paper Ninja's weapon and cut across his edge. However, in order to master the game, players need to practice the skill of cutting the Paper Ninjas with a balance of speed and control to gain "Combo" and "Critical Hit".
