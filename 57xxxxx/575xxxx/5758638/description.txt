In 1986, Dark Angel released Darkness Descends, a pinnacle of thrash metal altogether and, along with Morbid Saint's Spectrum of Death, one of the greatest 'pure' thrash albums out there (no progressive nonsense like many of the bands were experimenting at the time of its release). The 'Big Four' can go to Hell. 

Some thrash bands are fast. We all know those bands. Slayer became one of those bands with 'Reign in Blood.' Every thrash album has slow parts and fast parts, however. Dark Angel is no exception; the only difference is Dark Angel's slow parts are fast, and their fast parts are 'too fast, my ass.' It's no mindless music murder, though. The guitar is beautiful, and Gene Hoglan on the drums . . . well, there's a reason he's considered the best drummer in underground metal. Who else can tear up the drumset at the 286 bpm of 'Burning of Sodom' or play as brilliantly and fast as he does (and keep it up for over 8 minutes!)?

This album is no joke. It'll kill small animals and children on contact. Careful where you play it.
