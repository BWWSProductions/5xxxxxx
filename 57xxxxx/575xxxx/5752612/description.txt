Plot.............: The king of the Huns, whose hordes from various tribes and 
allies have been sweeping the Asian steppes and both Roman empires, dies,
leaving the throne to two sons. Bleda, tired of war and hungry, bloody campaigns,
wants to settle as allies of Rome in peace, his brother Attila believes only in
the power of the sword. Roman general Aethius, who knows the Huns well as a
result of former hostage exchanges, fails to get a true peace but buys a shaky
one promising doubled tribute. The court of weakling emperor Valentinianus, moved
north from Rome to Ravenna, where the true ruler is empress-mother Galla Placidia,
widow of a barbarian king, refuses the terms and imprisons Aethius, who still
refuses to seize power with Valentinian's sister Honoria.
