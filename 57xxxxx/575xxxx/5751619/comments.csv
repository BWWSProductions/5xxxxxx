I download these directly to a NAS so I can watch on a WD TV Live.

unpacking them takes about 20 fucking minutes since my PC has to transfer the data to my PC, and then transfer the unpacked video file back to the NAS over a wireless connection.

THIS IS MORONIC."

@PhilL12, dude the nerve of you. The UpLder went through the time and effort to bring us these files if you don't like it or are to inexperienced to unpack a rar file, then keep it moving and upld a copy yourself. I wont even mention the fact that it's free because clearly that doesn't matter to you. Have some respect for the upLder and not blast them on their page. You have no uploads (like myself) so be grateful for what these guys/girls do. I find your rant childish and abusive."
,Squrl,2010-09-28T00:46Z,Before you up it lists what the files are. Instead of just clicking ok read it.  If you don`t like it find another. don`t blast the uploader for your negligence.
