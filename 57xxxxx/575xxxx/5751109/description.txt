                    Tomorrow.                                
                    Last in the series of the gripping drama. Bloom  
                    is horrified when he is called to investigate a  
                    murder and realises that he is already linked  
                    to the crime through his undercover life.  
                    Meanwhile, Wareing's suspicions of Bloom grow,  
                    setting off a power play between them. Then  
                    Lawson is threatened and Bloom is the only one  
                    who can help her - but when it comes to the  
                    crunch, where will his loyalties lie?
