Rise of the Footsoldier follows the inexorable rise of Carlton Leach from one of the 
most feared generals of the football terraces to becoming a member of a notorious 
gang of criminals who rampaged their way through London and Essex in the late eighties 
and early nineties. It is three decades of his life following him from football 
hooliganism, through to his burgeoning career as a bouncer, his involvement in the 
criminal aspects of the early 'rave' scene and subsequently to his rise to power 
as one of the most feared and respected criminals in the country.
