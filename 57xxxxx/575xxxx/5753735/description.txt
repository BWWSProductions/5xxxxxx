All these MUSE tracks are made by me as a fan,
they are the usual karaoke files so can be used
on any karaoke machine.

These tracks have never before been released by 
any karaoke label so that\'s why I made them myself
because I wanted to try them out.

I\'ve decided to share them with you as these are
in my opinion songs taken from MUSE\'S best album
ABSOLUTION, except for one karaoke track - BLISS.


Karaoke Track Listing...



Apocolypse Please
Blackout
Bliss - From the album Origin Of Simitry (best song ever to sing of Muse\'s)
Butterflies & Hurricanes - (Full album version, not the crap that all other
                            labels have released and cut out 2mins of the song)
Endlessly
Falling Away With You
Ruled By Secrecy
The Small Print
Thoughts Of A Dying Atheist



So please, credits to me for making these in just over 6 hours and sharing them
with the world. OH! please read the read-me file, it holds information on each song that i have made that you will need to know.

P.s. Please leave comments, i\'m startin to get annoyed the fact that NO-ONE says
     thankyou anymore on TPB
