,paidpirate,2010-10-22T05:52Z,unrar the file that says .rar. after that go into the session strings folder ( that was created when you unrared) and unrar the 1rst file.   an Iso disc will be created. mount the Iso disc in an app. like dameon tools and copy the files to any folder where you want to store them. you need kontakt or kontakt player. or kontakt player to play the session strings instruments.
,joedesnail7878,2010-10-26T19:08Z,"hi, cheers for uploading this. i have currently downloaded it but how can i register the session strings library? please help me. thanks! i have kontrakt player. is there a serial number in the file u uploaded?"
,paidpirate,2010-10-27T04:48Z,"""This patch is encrypted and cannot be loaded unless the respective Library is registered properly""

If you get this error, just copy the ""Session Strings_info.nkx"" and the ""Session Strings_info.nkc"" files to the instruments folder, then - Go to the Libraries tab in kontakt (next to ""files"" top left)
- ""add Library""
- browse to where you have saved the inst. and sample folders.
It should then generate a lovely looking Session Strings image with the Instrument selections below it.

Hope this helps."
,pauljoehajj,2010-10-28T05:21Z,"Hi guys, I'm a little stuck here. I'm not too sure how to activate this product, it didn't come with a keygen or crack. If someone could comment on how to get around this it would be greatly appreciated."
,Keppra,2010-11-05T14:46Z,"Tnx for the upload!
I need a litte help. When I try to add the library in Kontakt a message apprears: ""This product cannot be added to the Kontakt Libraries Tab"". I have tried different updates of Kontakt (running 4.1.3 right now, and even tried a nother cracked version of Session Strings but the same message appears every time. Other libraries work fine. Any ideas pleace?"
,music1111,2010-12-25T06:53Z,"Man, this is frustrating! There is no patch or service center keygen included in the download. Is there a way to get around this demo version or having to activate it? Thanks!"
,Crackle_Toad,2011-02-11T18:25Z,All appears it is a good torrent EXCEPT no serial number provided! Anyone have access to the serial number?  @paidpirate Good advice on how to set up.
,lonnrot,2011-04-19T07:09Z,"@paidpirate is right, just add ""Session Strings_info.nkx"" and the ""Session Strings_info.nkc"" into the Instruments root folder, and add this one into the library Kontakt will make it work."
,coldjones,2011-04-28T02:16Z,"Im new to all this...I have the folder open, and then I saved it to my desktop to find easier...I want to use this within Logic, via Kontact 4 but I lost on what to do....any advise/help??"
,towned,2011-04-28T22:06Z,"Someone explain the actual installation step by step please.

I have copied those:
Session Strings_info.nkx
Session Strings_info.nkc 

Into every folder imaginable (instruments, samples, documents..etc)

Session strings still only runs in DEMO MODE (shuts down after 15 minutes)

Please explain in detail the exact steps for a MAC user to get this to work, please.

Thanks"
,hugodanner,2011-05-07T13:19Z,"As above, this version requires you to log into the kontakt service centre after 15 minutes to activate the full version. Is there a way around this? "
,nuclearlion73,2011-05-30T21:17Z,There is no way this is worth the 300$-400$ Native Instruments is asking for it. But thanks for the torrent anyway.
,okatosari,2011-06-23T17:25Z,"Hi there what ""paidpirate"" said is right

,mistermango111,2011-09-16T05:47Z,"Like many of the others who have tried to use this torrent, I can successfully unrar the iso and get all the files in their proper format, but when I add the library to Kontakt 5, it shows up in my library list, but it won't work unless it's activated.  And without a serial number, it won't work.

I've also tried putting the ""Session Strings_info.nkx"" and the ""Session Strings_info.nkc"" files in all the different folders in the library, but all to no avail.

Can anyone help me get it to work?  Many thanks if possible..."
,drewny75,2011-10-20T23:47Z,I can get it to work but only in the DEMO version.  HAs anyone gotten the FULL version to  work?  Great upoad.  Thanks!
,Naitsirk2008,2011-11-10T23:22Z,"Thanks for making this available ....   

With all respect ....  I notice there's nobody that can answer the question about the 'being in demo mode' issue...   if anyone was to use this seriously, they can't for longer then fifteen mins.

Any answers out there...?  Please?"
,liquid21,2011-11-13T05:34Z,I try to use an instrument and kontakt tells me the files are encrypted. Am I missing a step?
,bk2012,2012-04-12T11:47Z,I also did what paidpirate suggested and I use Kontakt 5 still shows up as demo and expires after 15 minutes. Q! has anyone found a way of getting this to work?
,Fexmusix,2012-05-02T17:51Z,"hello there, does this works for mac?"
