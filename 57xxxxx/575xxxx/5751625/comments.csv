Hung? Rubicon? Jersey Shore? Girls Next Door? Mad Men? c'mon guys, get back to doing what you do best, TV shows.

look people if you are happy with no tv shows under a uploader named TVTEAM then fine, be morons all you want. but dont be mad at me for noticing the obvious.  TV SHOWS on TVTEAM!!! If I want movies I will look to other uploaders.

How am I the only one who feels this way?

sincerly though TvTeam--I appriciate your hard work, I really do. I dont want to sound ungrateful. its just that you guys always used to have it first and have it best when it comes to TV. I dont want shitty TS movies (which are always cams now). I want good shows like madmen, trueblood, entourage and more.

so lets hear from the ignorant haters now..."

TS is not a cam. TS stands for TeleSync.  Its actually a process of recording directly from a movie projector (with a camcorder sometimes) and to directly line up the audio line of the film itself with the video being recorded....hence the term ""Tele-Sync"".

The problem is, and you are not the minority Billyboy666, is that TPB has gotten so flooded with color tweeked cam's passed off as Telesyncs that people now just think that thats what a telesync is.  AND YOU COULDN'T BE MORE MISTAKEN!!!

so please stop speaking out of ignorance before you address me."

I love it when someone tries to pwn someone else, but in doing so they just make themself look like a complete dumbass.  You go off on some rant trying to explain to BillyBoy that a TS is not a cam, but it's actually YOU who has it wrong.  A TS is still shot with a camcorder (hence the term ""CAM""), the only thing that comes directly from the projector is the audio.  So a TS is generally going to have the same video quality as any other cam (unless it was shot with a very nice HD cam, which isn't likely since pirates are cheap-asses), but the audio is usually going to be better.  But either way, a TS it IS STILL DEFINITELY A CAM, it just has direct audio.  

So how about you take some of your own advice and educate yourself before addressing the rest of us here on TPB.  Thanks.  "

,Dr_Science,2010-08-15T08:00Z,"@jleonard711

close but no cigar.  A cam is a vid that is some one took from the projector's image from the screen onto a camcorder. example: some dude records The Good Guys in the theater with his camcorder.  No matter how much color tweeking or brightness adjusting you do this will always be a CAM

ok that's a cam

now a TS or Telesync is an actual process of taking the binary information of what, the movie projector in this case it could be a a DVDrip from certain third world countries, would project.  the image is filtered through some kind of digital recording device.  This also captures the audio and aligns or ""sync""s it with the video being captured.

ok thats a TS

a TS will always have a better picture due to the capture rate and video clarity involved.

now you know and knowing is half of the battle"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-08-17T16:30Z,Who gives a shit. All that matters is the quality. TS is supposed to be better than a CAM in my opinion. But who cares? Quality is what matters. So what's the quality??

,scorted,2010-08-18T11:26Z,"@ Dr_Science

TS (Telesync) is a cam with directline audio. Doesnt matter where, how or on what its filmed.

TC (Telecine) is captured from the source reels. Requires lots of expensive gear, so don't see many about. Lots of people think this is a TS, it aint. ^^

Fuck knows what your on about capturing from third world country DVDs. Probably thinking R5, which are Region 5 discs with apprioate audio dubbed, usually from the earlier TS sources.

Now YOU know, but knowing is only half the battle. When you actually understand and contribute, then you can start educating the rest of us.

Thanks for the up!"
,Dr_Science,2010-08-18T13:33Z,"@ scorted
NO! you are still wrong. I know full well what an R5 is.  By the way R5 is America, not a third world country.  Telecine? dude c'mon; and I do contribute-just not under this name.

You people have missed the point and I give up.  I will not be checking this thread anymore so dont bother commenting back."
,Dr_Science,2010-08-18T14:30Z,"before I disappear forever (probly much to you guy's delight) I should let people know that a telecine is usually the process of converting the film from projector to DVD for market release.  TS is all done in the projector booth.  Yes a TS has direct line audio, no arguments there.  But a true TS is a image filtering from the projector to a cam or other digital recording device.  A real TS will have no one walking in front of the camcorder and you will not hear people in the theater.

this is lame.  I shouldn't care this much.  I am going to get a new hobby....Today!  Goodbye for real this time.

,SlapHappily,2010-08-25T20:50Z,"For anyone wondering:

Dvdrip = Direct video & audio

R4/R5/R6 = Each its respective region, R5 happening to be Russia.

Workprint = A ""stolen"" or ""leaked"" version of the theatrical or dvd release that is unfinished.

TS = Video and Audio Sync'ed up to make a better experience, Nether audio or video has to be direct line. It can be say 2 cams, one with bad video/good audio, the other vice-versa. The good audio is then stripped and sync'ed to the one with better video. (For those who remember KingBen666, he was truely the king at this back in the day.)

Cam - Handheld cam, retreiving video and audio from a theatrical veiwers experience.

,notherdaysgoneby,2010-09-02T08:05Z,"@jleonard711 You are right about the TS but why call someone a dumbass? There are hundreds of thousands of users that have a different idea in their head as to what a TS or a Screener or what ever is. All are right, all are wrong. because it is nothing more than pirater's lingo. Most of you who complain have never even tried to film a cam straight up, or tried to make a cam TS either so what difference does it really make? Download the video, if it works for you, than watch it. If not, than go to the next. And just in case you might be thinking to ask. yes I have done some recording in the past. Long time ago, before DVD's or peer downloading. It was fun, and it was done at a drive-in where it is safe and has a live ""radio"" transmitted audio feed for a TS.. Your welcome for the idea.. It works well.   "

I actually go to see movies at the cinema all the time, but then I come home and download the film, cuz I like to see shit over and over if it is good. lol. "
