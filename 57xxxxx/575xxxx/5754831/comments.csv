[T],FatFreddy39,2011-06-21T02:51Z,"Thanks for the upload Riddler, great quality by the way. On a humorous note I actually started watching Fringe because of you Riddler. I read a comment you posted saying you weren't gonna do Dexter or something but you recommended Fringe. So thank you for getting me on this series indirectly lol. "

,hakuna_matata,2011-09-25T20:48Z,Thanks
,ApoxyDesign,2012-02-03T07:27Z,"The episodes are not in the order.

E.g. in the third episode a guy dies and then BOOM in the 11th episode he is back alive, there are several situations like that.
A part from that the quality is awesome"
,aaadimas,2012-04-24T07:21Z,"@ApoxyDesign: its an episode from season 1. theres 21 ep on season 1, and fox only broadcast 20ep due to schedule problem."
