,les907,2010-08-13T15:24Z,So THIS is what Beck's been up to. Thanks for the UPLOAD. I think I'll actually pay full price for this and the movie too.
,Maphic,2010-08-15T08:13Z,Only download this if you love having to edit all the properties individually.
,themagicmushroom,2010-08-15T19:29Z,WARNING! ONLY DOWNLOAD THIS IF YOU ARE SUPER AWESOME.
,Roqu,2010-08-18T12:02Z,With out a doubt buying the sound track and the movie. Makes me think what would have happened with out Beck.....
,Darkly47,2010-08-26T04:58Z,"you know theres two versions of this OST, after dl'ing this one this is the red version, i hope the blue version gets uploaded sometime."
,vestalas,2010-09-02T18:29Z,Audio quality sounds like the uploader recorded it on a digital recorder put up to a crappy stereo speaker. 
,Mrkeyboard,2010-09-24T04:18Z,"Amazing movie, terrific OST! Will definitely buy when it's out nearby. "
,gomushin,2010-09-24T16:02Z,"I can't seem to edit the music's properties :(
tried to write the artist's name and this; ""Error 0x8007000D: The data is invalid"" came out"
,LeviLaviLovi,2010-11-04T05:41Z,"This is NOT the OST.
This is songs from the movie.
The OST is songs composed for the movie, like Patel's Song, Slick."
,civoniz,2010-11-04T21:49Z,Awsum :3
,lilw,2010-11-15T16:34Z,"use mp3tag to edit the properties of these files.
actually, just open them in mp3tag, choose them and right click, Extended Tags... OK, they will rewrite the IDTag and it will appear in Explorer."
,Trevino,2010-11-28T21:18Z,Dude! I lesbians you so much right now. Best upload ever.
,nadieefish,2010-12-06T12:57Z,fucking AWESOME
,ccrocker58,2010-12-13T05:13Z,"I have to say, everything that's been made for the Scott Pilgrim series has been absolutely fantastic. The original series, the movie, the game, and all the soundtracks are all great. Will definitely be buying all three soundtracks."
,NimbleJack3,2011-07-02T14:59Z,"Pretty crap quality on the highs. Gives an interesting effect but if you want at least decent sound quality, search around more.
Rated down."
,theris30,2011-10-13T18:17Z,"To those complaining about the quality, have you watched the movie? The songs are distorted like that intentionally. Great torrent."
,miccola,2011-10-26T20:37Z,"@LeviLaviLovi and Darkly47
This torrent IS the OST, with red cover art.  The other version you're talking about, with blue cover art, is the SCORE.  Think of it as songs the bands play throughout the movie vs. background music."
,joedalton2,2012-03-31T00:13Z,"Sounds ok, but has been converted from Itunes (probably a lossy transcript from aac). Also this is NOT ""VBR V0"". File specs says ""Lame 3.98 V4"", but the mp3 are actually CBR 256kbps"
