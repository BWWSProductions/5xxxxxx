,deserttrash,2011-01-11T13:24Z,"can you tell me why on S1E1 it says ""previously on BSG"" ? i'm pretty sure it wouldnt say that on the first episode, so is this incomplete or just retarded?"

,tigercraw,2011-01-27T04:14Z,because the pilot isnt part of season 1
,bzerk22,2011-02-16T16:09Z,"It won't start downloading or uploading (so it won't start at all, du'uh ^^). I have tried restarting my Utorrent, i've tried restarting the torrent and i've tried to restart the computer itself, but nothing seems to work.

I have no idea what the problem might be, so any help and tips will be appreciate :)"
,sanebutoverwhelmed,2011-02-26T20:03Z,"Ep 10 doesn't seem to want to play. Anyone else having the same issue, or point me to the right codec?"
,sanebutoverwhelmed,2011-02-26T20:09Z,Same issue with ep 11 too. 12 is fine.
,karel89,2011-03-02T19:44Z,"Thank you for uploading these episodes! Yet I'm having previously mentioned problems with viewing some of the episodes, using VLC.

Episodes 1 and 2 work fine, excellent quality/size ratio. :) But episode 3 makes VLC freeze, as do 4,5,6,7,8,12 and 13. Episodes 9,10, and 11 work fine.

It might be due to corrupt file downloads, but I've never before had that problem, and it would be unlikely to affect so many of the files. However, if these work for others, the problem must be on my end. Going to download the bugged files again --->

If anyone else is experiencing said problems and manages to find a solution, please share it :D"
,karel89,2011-03-02T20:12Z,"Edit to my previous post: Tried DL:ing the corrupt files a second time, still had the same problem: Upon starting with VLC, the player freezes and when trying to quit the program crashes.

I find this really peculiar, it can't be due to codecs since some of the vids (1,2,9,10,11) work perfectly. I can't even guess what the cause may be, but am hoping for someone to tell how to fix this, as I'd like to see the episodes :)"
,sanebutoverwhelmed,2011-03-11T19:11Z,"Further to my issues above, sorted it by downloading the X-Lite Codec Pack from:

,oyyou,2011-04-28T14:12Z,Wish you could have added the pilot.. But super fast download.. Thanks!
,Syruzik,2011-05-18T18:27Z,"episodes 10 and 11 don't work for me, anybody knows why?"
,Syruzik,2011-05-18T18:28Z,"sorry, didn't read the previous comments :)"
,ViolentC,2011-07-09T02:57Z,"DVD Rips YAY!
Hard coded Sub titles I can't turn them off BOO!
I'm not deaf man. I find subs very distracting.
I spend the whole time reading ahead of the actor and waiting for him to say the words. I can't enjoy anything with subs unless its not in english. I just want to watch it, not read it. and I can't stop myself from reading words when they are on a screen I am looking at.... "
,Sojio,2011-07-19T16:01Z,"I'm using a mac so i don't have the option of dl'ing any codec packs besides additional QT codecs, (We all know QT is shitty) so i am stuck using a standard VLC copy.

The only way i can get episodes 3,4,5,6,7,8,12,and 13 working is by running an episode that works and while it's playing start one of the episodes that doesn't work.

This, to me, seems like an error in the file. As the files that don't work are the ones with soft coded english subs i think they might be the problem. But i don't know much about video formats so i don't really know.

Any other mac users having this problem? "
,angrybeard,2011-07-22T06:56Z,im having a huge problem with the subtitles. i cant find a player that allows u to turn them off. the one converter i found pastes a nice ugly watermark right in the middle of the screen. what player r u guys using???
,amnesiac_radar,2011-07-22T17:11Z,"Awesome quality and possibly on of the best shows I've ever seen, absolutely amazing. Thanks for your efforts, you've done a great job."
,amnesiac_radar,2011-07-22T17:12Z,"Just burn to disc and watch, easy to turn subs off then."
,amnesiac_radar,2011-07-22T17:18Z,"angrybeard
Try using convertxtodvd, there's copies on here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6101866/VSO_ConvertXtoDVD_v4.1.10.348_Final___Serials_%5BTrT-TcT%5D
The best player I've found is Media Player Classic http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/ and simple to turn subs off."
,Infalk,2011-07-31T01:25Z,"Gotta admit, it's fucking stupid that you didn't include the pilot. Clearly not *actually* complete.

Nevertheless, very much grateful for the upload dude."
,Infalk,2011-07-31T01:27Z,"Oh, and for pretty much *any* media you might download off the internet; use 'VLC Media Player'. That will let you right click/video/disable sub track."
,Squeak_is_Legend,2011-08-06T21:56Z,"hey Infalk
the 'Pilot"" was never actually included in the first season, its actually its own separate miniseries so why don't you get your facts straight before you go bagging it out

thanx for the upload"
,mavrix,2011-08-18T01:05Z,"watched all episodes with media player classic, all played perfect. Thanks!"
,piratiinho,2011-10-08T16:28Z,"Some episodes require to be converted in another video format (like mp4) to be played.

The quality is good, it downloads fast and the show is awesome.

Thanks."
,JRaiden,2012-01-11T19:44Z,"HUGE thanks houruoha. 

You guys still don't know how to play MKV's? FFS... Google it. Take your pick: Codec pack (like CCCP, or just an MKV splitter). Or: Media player (like Zoom Player, VLC, MPC). Or: Remux H264/AAC into MP4 contrainer. Etc."
,britton27,2012-02-06T12:40Z,"Thanks for the season 1 copy, your the best. Only concern I have with it is your choice of MKV file format. (yuck) Sure they are small but they require 3rd party media players to view them and all the media I have runs in WMP12 by default, so this whole torrent will have to be converted, bummer."
,NightPrince777,2012-03-17T14:04Z,"Crappy quality, fixed subs.  Steer clear of this."
,JRaiden,2012-04-05T10:46Z,"Disregard NightPrince777. Subs are not 'fixed': Simply a SubRip (.srt) file places in the MKV container, disable as wished."
