,Hambone3,2010-08-13T06:18Z,THANK YOU!
,andzejek,2010-08-13T11:23Z,this is a 6th season!!
,Maynard46,2010-08-13T18:31Z,"thanks to the uploader. A/V 9. I wonder why it has the same rar file 31 times? Only needed to extract 1 of them to watch the show

yeah, not sure why it says season 5. This is the new season with the jets "
,gylgamesh5000,2010-08-13T21:21Z,It's not the same rar file 31 times. It's a rar archive divided into 40 segments. The segments are joined into one .avi file.
,CrazyTommyT,2010-08-13T21:56Z,New to torrents.....When I extract and play on Windows Media Player I only get audio. What am I doing wrong. Thx.
,Maynard46,2010-08-14T00:30Z,"@ gylgamesh5000 i only extracted 1 of them and got the complete file. i assumed i would have to extract all 31 to get the segments into 1 avi file. I dont DL rar files enough to know so thats why i asked. 

@crazytommy DL vlc media player. It will play anything and is better than WMP imo. "
,Phenom718,2010-08-14T09:59Z,"@Maynard64 only one part is in each rar file. when you extract one part, the program automatically extracts from the other rars in order to produce a complete extracted file.

@andzejek this is also the 7th season"
,MOdeez56,2010-08-19T04:25Z,THANKS keep it up
