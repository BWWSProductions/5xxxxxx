DJ King Pigeon's only friend is a pet rock, his last girlfriend died in 1978, and after being talked into donating his entire fortune to a clinic that (supposedly) provides counseling to web surfers who have been "Rick Roll'd" he is penniless. But from time to time, during rare moments when he is semi-cognizant of his surroundings, he delivers a DJ set that knows no political boundaries and shows no fear. No club will allow him entry, so he has created the soundtrack to the club of his dreams. And yours. Welcome to "Eurotrash or Eurotreasure?"
