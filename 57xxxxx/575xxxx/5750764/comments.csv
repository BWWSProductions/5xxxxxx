I love the movies about all the creatures on the Earth. 
Does anybody happen to have a movie about a pair of Brazilian parrots? I don't remember the name of the movie. It was done either by Discovery Channel or BBC about 5 or 6 years ago, and it depicted the life of a pair of parrots from birth to maturity, and it was very colorful with a bunch of different movie making tricks. 
Thanks a lot!"
