,thunderbum,2010-08-10T06:13Z,"JW- no need to apologize, it's just a minor glitch. :)

Mega ditto thanks!"
,flying_kiwi123,2010-08-10T07:57Z,"Thanks again!!!! I'm listening and Rove is doing great. Btw, it may be better to encode in 64kbps/44.1khz (or 48khz if you recorded it with that). So long as you use the best encoding setting this is more than adequate for talk radio...... The reason I mention it is because my ISP here in New Zealand no longer has flatrate plans, and halving the bitrate will halve the filesize."
,thunderbum,2010-08-10T09:40Z,@flyingkiwi & J Whitt: What recording programs do you use? 
[T],skJGZV6z,2010-08-10T11:42Z,Thank you jwhitt62!
,AthePG2,2010-08-11T04:34Z,Rove was great.  He should get his own show.
,flying_kiwi123,2010-08-11T12:41Z,thunderbum: When I used to record The Phil Hendrie Show I used Cooledit to record then WinLAME to encode.
