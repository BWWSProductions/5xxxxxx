Ana lives in a little village by the sea, with her husband and her daughter. He decides to leave for a few days. That seems to be the ideal solution, because Ana needs some time to finish a work she has been doing for a long time. But her concentration seems threatened when she starts doing her daily walks to the village and the beach. She saves a stranger from drowning, meets young Alexandre and Emilia, and her friend Vera turns up in her house.
