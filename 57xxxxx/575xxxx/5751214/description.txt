The second full-length release from Omaha wunderkind Conor Oberst is a fascinating coming of age for a singer/songwriter whose respectability is chiseled in stone through his musical abilities. This ten-track outing is a lo-fi bonanza of heartfelt tunes that features musical contributions from members of such critically acclaimed groups as Neutral Milk Hotel, Of Montreal, and Lullaby for the Working Class. Letting Off the Happiness is a powerful record that manages to stay believable in light of the tortured emotions it tries to convey. Bright Eyes went on to release some better-sounding and slightly more mature records, but this one has the raw power to make people really stand up and notice.
