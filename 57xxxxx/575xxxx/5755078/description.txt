A real estate developer named Dan Sanders (Brendan Fraser) is given the task to develop a forest into a development by his boss Neal Lyman (Ken Jeong) much to the objections of Dan\'s son Tyler (Matt Prokop) and his wife Tammy (Brooke Shields). Unfortunately, the animals who live in the forest don\'t intend to take the loss of their home lying down, and instead decide to turn the tables on Dan. Tammy is planning an eco friendly fair and Lyman\'s company decides to sponsor it. The Sanders family later finds out that Lyman and his company are not eco friendly and want to cut down the forest to build houses.
