                    Eco Warrior.                             
                    A new five-part comedy drama starring Rafe  
                    Spall as struggling young sports journalist  
                    Pete Griffiths. Although well meaning, Pete  
                    often lacks the emotional maturity required to  
                    deal with life's more intricate problems. He  
                    wishes that life had clearly defined rules like  
                    sport. In the first episode, Pete claims that  
                    he won't travel by plane, and inadvertently  
                    impresses a young lady with his commitment to  
                    green issues. Pete quickly realises that to  
                    maintain his new relationship, he's going to  
                    have to make a few changes.
