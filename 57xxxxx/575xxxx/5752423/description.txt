Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Inception 

Source used was ORC's homemade video + audio......Thanks guys 
Now the source was nice but suffered from two major things....camera movement and flicker.
Now the flicker only happens a few times and not for long......the bad news is the cammer had ants in his pants 
Got to give orc credit for having the balls to go and do it,so fair play lads .
Right all we've done for this is done a small script to resize,white balance,rgbeq,contrast,brightness and sharpen.
Nothing as been done to the angles or camera movement.....just too bad to do anything decent to it.
The screens below so the good and bad of this release so ....take it or leave.
