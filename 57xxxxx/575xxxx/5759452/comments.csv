,slats649,2010-08-15T18:48Z,"You do great work so I figure the problem is mine. I've tried to burn this movie 3 times and it keeps failing. I am using DVD Flick to encode, and it then brings up ImgBurn to burn it to DVD.
This movie will not finish the encoding process, it errors out when it reaches the ""combine Sources"". Any help? Thanks, and thanks for all the hard work."
,slats649,2010-08-15T18:52Z,"Thanks for the great work. I'm having a problem encoding this movie. Tried it 3 times using DVD Flick and each time it errors out when it is suppose to ""combine sources"". Any suggestions? Thanks for all your hard work."
,sgriffith58,2010-08-15T19:38Z,"Plays great as AVI, but convert it too DVD Using VSO COnvertXtoDVD4 Latest Version, loses audio on 4th chapter and when audio comes on it is way out of sync. Any Help PLEASE?"
,perkoz78,2010-08-22T04:34Z,How about fucking screencap????????
,DrScrat,2010-08-24T15:52Z,I'm going to try a conversion using Xilisoft Video Converter 6 to another codex to see if that will fix the sync problem with ConvertXtoDVD. Will let you know if it works after download and I convert it.
,DrScrat,2010-08-25T06:25Z,"Got it Downloaded and I'm converting it to DivX. After it completes I'll use ConvertXtoDVD to create a DVD image and see if the sound stays synced.

If it appears to work I'll create a Torrent and upload  probably tomorrow night after 2000 local (GMT -5)."
,DrScrat,2010-08-26T06:41Z,"Sorry all, tried several methods of 'automatic' fixing of the sync issue. It appears the audio track is for a different frame rate then the video source. This causes the audio sync to get worse as the movie proceeds. It will require multiple 'resyncs' by careful  watching/listening of the movie to do this using one of the resync tools. Don't have the time right now, sorry."
