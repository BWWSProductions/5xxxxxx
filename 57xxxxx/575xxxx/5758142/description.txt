Two new subtitle files are included along with the two uploaded before.  

The Upstairs,Downstairs episode videos matching the new subtitle files are also

included.  As before, parentheses are entered around the words or phrases which

are difficult to understand. In future, uploads all of the subtitle files previously 

uploaded will be reviewed and corrected. So, the most accurate rendition of the

spoken words will be found in the latest subtitle update.



contact me directly about any serious mistakes.
