,rrpostal,2010-11-04T03:18Z,thanks for the upload that exposes the conspiracy with all these facts and science that get in the way of my world view! The nerve of some people! Why should I have to acknowledge the way things are? Why are scientists always sticking their noses in to things and discovering realities we were perfectly happy making up ourselves?
,jna99,2011-02-04T09:21Z,"Hey, Science defenders, no one is against science.  It works by suppositions, theories, guesses and tries to find evidence of it.  Not all scientists are 'objective' or after the actual truth and many base their findings and 'knowledge' upon the study of others who were also basing their study upon others.  And with the newer and powerful tools and evidence that is available today could invalidate their findings and assumptions.

It's not about fighting science.  Let everyone search for the truth. But don't deny what's so evident to every one with common sense.  Don't deny reality.  Either you believe God created the worlds and all things or that they just appeared and grew randomly to the state they are in today.

Many of those trying to defend science are stuck to other's research and findings instead of questioning them and seeking for themselves.  So in effect, they are being very unscientific.  
And how is anyone ever going to 'guess' what happened a supposed million years ago when we can't even find the facts and truth about things from the past century?  It's so easy to throw around ""Oh this was from 200 million years ago"".  How would they know?  How can anyone know all the changes that occurred and effects of so many factors and come up with a number like that?  And for others to just accept it.  

Many scientists, just like other professionals, seek to publicize themselves and want to get noticed and receive funding.  So they prematurely rush to conclusions when sometimes the truth is not known.  We need more people scrutinizing the results of the 'noble' scientists who maybe wrong. "
