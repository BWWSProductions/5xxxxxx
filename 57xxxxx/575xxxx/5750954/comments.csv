,raybob4321877,2010-08-10T03:15Z,Guys!  Don't request any payware because I'm certainly not going to go out and buy it.
,raybob4321877,2010-08-10T07:44Z,Thanks very much to the 42 of you that are seeding; keep it up!
,BasilHoneycup,2010-08-10T21:19Z,"@Bektaz
Have a peek at the Posky forums to solve your steering problem. It's solvable in the aircraft,cfg "
,KoktSvamp,2010-08-11T16:17Z,"Brilliant Torrent! Seeding!

Request Posky 777 W/liveries and the Vc from posky!

be great if you could make it!"
,raybob4321877,2010-08-13T06:13Z,Yeah actually I have done the same thing with Posky's 777's (and 767's too I think) and perhaps I'll upload them later .
,FSjock1,2010-08-17T10:04Z,"There is no visible VC in this package, the exterior models look great, but they aren't worth flying without a VC."
,raybob4321877,2010-08-19T05:33Z,"Every model contains the Standard FSX 747 Virtual Cockpit.  Guaranteed.

The only excecption is that of the 747 LCF (Boeing Dreamlifter) where Opensky does not have an FSX model and therefore cannot be combined with the FSX VC."
,raybob4321877,2010-08-19T05:34Z,"I cannot guarantee that the VC (or in fact, any of this) will work if you install it to FS9.  However, it does include the FS9 models which you can install yourself and try to make it work."
,Aizen-sama,2010-08-22T14:22Z,Please I didn't found anything about the problem with the steer!
