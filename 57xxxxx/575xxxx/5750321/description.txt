2007 The Bonny Bunch of Roses   CD 984 305-1

The Bonny Bunch of Roses is an album by Fairport Convention.

This album had the highest number of traditional songs that Fairport had recorded since Liege and Lief. For this album, Simon Nicol returned after an absence of five years although he had contributed some guitar to the previous record, Gottle O'Geer and mixed the album. It was recorded between August 1976 and March 1977 at Island Studios, London.

"The Bonny Bunch of Roses" is not regarded as one of the best Fairport albums, but in my opinion it is. Denny-era soulfulness is far away, as they are Thompson's guitar riffs or "Nine"'s embarassing American leanings. The mostly acoustic formula of "The Bonny Bunch of Roses" is closer to the one of "Babbacombe" Lee, but it lacks its epic atmosphere. More traditional material takes the place of Swarbrick's song cycle, and  Simon Nicol's impressive guitar slashes dominate the music. The tracks are dynamic and balanced, I'd say they're perfect, and a couple of songs are among the best of their repertoire. The long Napoleonic ballad "The Bonny Bunch of Roses" is amazingly built on a stripped-down sound full of silences, while "Run Johnny Run" features some blazing Byrdsian jingle-jangle on a hyper-kinetic 5/4 meter.
