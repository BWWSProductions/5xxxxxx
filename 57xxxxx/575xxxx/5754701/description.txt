[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
right....thanks to orc for the release, and to Silent PR For camming it ;), yes it's another release of inception from
us....but didn't see a 720p XviD out of it...anyway changed the colours slightly, used a sharpness script, lowered chroma
just slightly, and some other bits...didn't really do much to it...anyway take it or not Enjoy
