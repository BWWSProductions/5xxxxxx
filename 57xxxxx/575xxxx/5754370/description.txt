Excerpts From the Diary of Todd Zilla is an EP released by the band Grandaddy on 27 September 2005.

The name comes from something Jason Lytle saw on the "vanity license plate of a grossly oversized, giant tire-style pick-up truck while vacationing in Lake Tahoe."[cite this quote]

Todd Zilla was recorded at Lytle's home studio in Ceres, California, on older equipment â€” "none of that glitzy 24-track business". Its eight tracks do not appear on the band's fourth full-length album, Just Like the Fambly Cat.
