Nevertheless, well deserved pink skull. This is the best Inception torrent currently available.

,LeviLaviLovi,2010-08-12T21:39Z,"Congrats in the pink skull
Looking forward to this torrent
Thanks"
,hauntnut,2010-08-14T06:34Z,"This isn't really a telesync; otherwise, the camera would not be moving all over the place during the recording. Good quality image-wise, but it moves around too much to be all that watchable."
,dac1949,2010-08-15T17:20Z,"thx, A=8/10 V=7/10,
but the cam shake, shake much.

Not watchable for me, let me with headache!"
,billyboy999,2010-08-19T01:34Z,"Well 'hauntnut' if you r so up on telesync's, explain to us all what one actually is then !!!"
,brandonb00zed,2010-08-26T00:44Z,Just because it's a telesync doesn't mean it used a tripod...
,ericv1984,2010-08-26T08:13Z,"billyboy999, pretty stupid question considering any retard can look up the definition of telesync online.


A telesync (TS)is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often with a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth (but the video is often just cam video), with a direct connection to the sound source (often an FM microbroadcast[citation needed] provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theater).

The true definition of telesync would include the film being synchronized to the camera's own frame rate and shutter timing as done by television companies when preparing celluloid film for broadcast. A bootleg TS rarely, if ever, uses this form of synchronisation which can lead to additional temporal aliasing. A TS can be considered a higher quality type of cam, that has the potential of better-quality audio and video.

As technology gets better, the quality of telesyncs also improves, although even the best telesyncs are lossy and will be inferior in quality to direct rips from Blu-ray, DVD or digital transfers from the film itself. Although very few at the moment, some release groups use high-definition video cameras to get the clearest picture possible."

This is a perfect torrent for a great movie quality wise, if not for the shaking cam which rapidly does small movements and every 3-5minutes the cam tries to take a look around"

,k00lf1re,2010-09-12T16:29Z,thanks but shaky prints are called CAM prints and not TS!
,Agrippa,2010-09-17T15:26Z,"There's death penalty for making a cam copy now?  Damn that's harsh....

Anyway, this is absolutely a CAM, not a TS.  Sadly totally unwatchable, but thanks all the same."

,WeedPirate,2010-09-25T05:41Z,"rookie bootleg job.. too bad, cause they have a nice camera"
,depend3nt,2010-09-26T20:01Z,"should have invested in tripod, would have been a really good version"
,dr.applepie,2010-09-27T17:26Z,CAM VERSION DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR REAL 720P!!!
,monlor,2010-10-06T14:25Z,"just wait for the dvdrip or go to the cinema's. You'd ruin the experience by watching this CAM crap. Also, 720p TS sounds a LOT better than what this actually is, kinda misleading..."
,xakXOLAS,2010-10-13T00:43Z,rbin waiting to see when you launch. I'm just grab the best for later share with everyone.
,xakXOLAS,2010-10-13T00:53Z,"rbin I am to serve the best movies to share later, to see how many films that are in a hurry and did not realize at last the film."
,PaRiKaaLP,2010-10-22T09:26Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD !!
