,ljo173f7,2010-08-12T18:58Z,Awesome!  Thank you for all of the Blu-Ray Star Trek movies!   :-)
,55trucker,2011-02-07T02:44Z,"Nice work. 
On another note.....why is it that some Blu ray releases edit out portions of the movie? 
This movie is no exception, there is a scene where the Enterprise is being pursued by the Sona into the *Briar patch*. Riker takes manual control of the ships helm by a popup joystick to navigate the ship. This scene is in the old VHS & standard definition DVD release but it is completely edited out from the Blu ray release!  "
,zoneone,2012-02-11T19:00Z,"@55trucker There must be different versions then, because I just watched a highdef version and the joystick scene was still there!
It happens rather late in the battle though, maybe you searched for it at the wrong moment of the battle? :P"
