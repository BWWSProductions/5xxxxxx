         It was one of the largest mass sightings in UFO history. In   
         1997, hundreds of people reported intensely bright balls      
         of light forming a "V" shape in the sky over Nevada and       
         Arizona. Some claimed to see an enormous, slow-moving         
         aircraft. But what's behind the bizarre occurrence later      
         nicknamed the "Phoenix Lights"? Was it an alien armada? A     
         top-secret military exercise? See home video and hear from    
         eyewitnesses who provide a vivid glimpse into what it         
         was like on the ground that eerie night. Join a team of       
         rocket scientists, physicists and engineers as they use       
         the latest in advanced technology to attempt to explain       
          the mysterious sightings.
