Rove was great, wasn't he? Interesting perspective..."
,thunderbum,2010-08-11T23:17Z,"Rove is terrific - a natural! I hope Limbaugh has Rove as a substitute all the time. He's a whole lot better than the usuals he has on lineup. 

Although I like Mark Steyn, I've never been able to get used to his Yuk-Yuk comedy routine. Just makes me grit my teeth. 

I don't bother listening to any of the other 'subs'. There's the one guy from Texas, I think, and he did the July 4th broadcast last year. All he did was whine and repeat himself about how he wasn't going to celebrate the 4th of July because of how bad things are blah blah blah.

I caught myself thinking 'yeah, you've said that a million times already!' Don't know how that guy ever got his own radio show...
