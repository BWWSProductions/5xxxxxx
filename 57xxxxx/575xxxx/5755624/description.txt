Looking for studs rounding up stallions...and riding them high.

California Cowgirls are back in the saddle again and loving it. When ther cowpoke boyfriend Johnny rides into town, this rangy stud gives them shares of the mother lode without ever leaving the old bunkhouse. Doing the fancy bareback riding he's famous for, Johnny corrals the bartenderess at the Big O Saloon, hitches uo an oriental saddle, and teaches the local schoolmarm the hard-won secrets of big totem pole. When the handsome and raunchy ranch hand is away, the girls console each other and ring in a temporary substitute, a long-horn they ride like an untamed stallion. The action is hot and heavy as the gower gulch cowboy rides his cowgirls down the bridle path, satisfying their desires for wild and furious bucking in a series of climatic episodes that makes fur fly and splatters foam on the range!
