Plot Summary:
A high school senior comes to visit Port Chester (aka Politically Correct U) for the weekend, 
and the admissions department mistakenly sets him up to stay with Droz (Jeremy Piven), a seven 
year student and party-animal who lives in The Pit, the most offensive house on campus. After 
trying to pawn the pre-freshman off on his housemate (Jon Favreau), Droz sets off on his normal 
daily activities including disrupting a political protest by throwing meat at a group of vegan protesters. 
The President of the University then receives a number of complaints, and with the help of her lackey 
(superbly portrayed by David Spade), she may finally have the power to kick Droz's house off campus. 
But the Pit throws an all-campus rager where George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic performs, 
and everything might turn out alright if the various political groups can forget their protests for 
one night and just have fun together.
