,Xoriat,2010-11-19T01:01Z,"IGNORE previous comment! I'm an idiot and was able to figure this out:

1. Torrent includes 26 files equal to 1.08 GB size
2. 11 files are labeled as cd1 and 13 files as cd2
3. Winrar both sets of files and you'll have two ISOs called CD1 and CD2
4. Open CD1 with Winrar and find the crack folder with the serial keygens inside
5. Mount and install CD1 on one drive letter - DO NOT mount CD2 separately!
6. When install asks for CD2, unmount CD1 and mount CD2 using the SAME drive letter. Ok to continue.
7. Once install is complete, it will ask for CD1 again. Unmount CD2 and mount CD1 with same drive letter and continue.
8. Install complete! 
9. Patch 1.1 is NOT INCLUDED. Google, download and install separately
10. Copy the no-cd patch executable from the crack folder to the install directory
10. Play!"

I followed everything, have iso 1 & 2 but no crack or key folder. went and double checked every rar but came up empty so i can not proceed with install as cd1 asks for key immediately. not sure how to proceed, please advise. BTW mounted with no problems on win 7 using magic iso. Thanks again for excellent work."
,mfainnir,2010-12-23T00:22Z,"I got it installed using a key and patch from another source and once installed it runs beautifully. Plays great, have been able to adjust settings. Running it on Win 7 mounted w/MagicISO, LOVELY."
,YoshiLee,2011-02-12T14:35Z,"mfainnir, I would imagine the crack is actually on disc 1 itself... did you look there?"
,Dachulence,2011-05-22T11:54Z,"Guys i have burn this two cd-s and i have still a problem with second cd when he ask for second one, i put in device second cd and he still wants to put second cd. "
,Dachulence,2011-05-22T11:56Z,I have read a description i belive a thousands of time and still nothing. Do i must do this iso-s with daemon or can i do this with alcohol?
