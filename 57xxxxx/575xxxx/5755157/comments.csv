,maverickhunterz,2010-10-13T21:43Z,"the key gen works fine for vCenter but not for ESXi, I need to be able to use the vCenter agent for ESXi and the keys I get from the keygen are invalid. is there one that is valid and how does it work, is there an expiration on it? Any help on this would be great. "
,U571kills,2010-10-13T23:30Z,"maverickhunterz: EXSI licences are free. They just want you to register. 
Just visit https://www.vmware.com/go/getesxi/"
,maverickhunterz,2010-10-15T00:16Z,"I understand that, but in order to add the hosts to vCenter, you need the vCenter agent, which is a licensed feature. The free license for ESXi does not allow you to add it to vCenter. Which is why I was asking if they key gen, or if anyone has a key that I can use to add to my hosts. "

Does anyone have a clean keygen??

Thanks in advance...

,maverickhunterz,2010-10-24T08:48Z,nevermind. Figured it out. Awesome torrent. I seeded a bunch! keep the new versions coming and I'll seed from my 100 megabit connection. Also @hyperstriker just create a shitty virtual machine even if it's in vmware server or workstation... get your keys... nuke the vm... trojan won't matter. =)
,SidNader,2010-11-27T08:48Z,"I'm running into the same issue, I thought it was that vSphere wasn't licensed, but I can't use the keygen to license vSphere.

What was your fix?"
,alkor999,2011-03-28T14:54Z,"hi guys. where is the keygen, I canÂ´t see it anywhere... thanks"
