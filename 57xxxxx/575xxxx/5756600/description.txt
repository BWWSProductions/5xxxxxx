Released September 6, 2005 

The album's release went largely unnoticed at the time. However, the single "Boston" was used during an episode of the CW series One Tree Hill in 2006 and propelled the band into national prominence. As a result, the song was used in several other MTV and VH1 shows, and Augustana was selected as a "You Oughta Know" band by VH1[2]. The album was then selectively re-released on September 12, 2006. "Boston" continued to be used on television into 2007, including in an episode of the series Scrubs, Shark and The Big Bang Theory.
