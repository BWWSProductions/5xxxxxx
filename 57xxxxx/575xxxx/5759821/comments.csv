,RapierApe,2011-05-21T09:22Z,GOG games work perfect I hope I can play this. Last time I tried to play IW2 the controls were screwed up and I couldn't do anything.
,zionlion131313,2011-05-29T20:48Z,Hello dANGER_boy.  I just noticed you put Interstate 76 on TPB.  Thank you.  I bought it at gog a while ago and did not even notice you put it on.  You are the best.  I know a lot of people that were looking for it.  I'm trying to get Interstate 82 but even gog does not sell it.  Thanks for everything I'm going to check out some more of your U/Ls.  
,higgie23,2012-05-20T00:50Z,"I was wondering if you hear about Darkstar One at GOG.com It should work better than one that was posted in 2010 which is more than two years ago... I was browsing at GOG.com It said that it had already removed all of DRM's  I bet someone will be glad to upload it... I will be happy to have it without having to disable the Anti-virus. Please grab this game off GOG.COM...

Thanks"
