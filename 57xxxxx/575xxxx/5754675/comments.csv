,champofchampions,2010-09-02T23:41Z,@abhaypratap2010 - that is because the new Firefox becomes unstable with IDM... Mozilla's fault...
,jimmyjojr,2010-09-04T23:18Z,"I've never had any issues with Firefox and IDM. 

Even with FF4beta4 I have no issues. Though I should point out that I always disable the IDM browser plugin as I use flashgot instead for the right click menu. "
