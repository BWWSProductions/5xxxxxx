,Tolkien73,2010-08-12T23:05Z,"To all my fellow Tolkien lovers out there, I would love to connect with other collectors who would like to trade miscellaneous finds from around the net. I have a decent collection, most of which was found on torrent sites and some P2P networks. There are items I'm missing though that maybe others have.

Also, as I'm sure many are, I'm looking forward to an update to the Tolkien Text Anthology (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4967133/Tolkien_Text_Anthology_2_Extended_Edition__), anybody have any info on that?"

,Tolkien73,2010-08-27T20:10Z,"Bladorthin,
I don't know of a very anonymous way at the present for Tolkien collectors to connect and share. It's something I'm looking for. I'm open to any and all ideas.
