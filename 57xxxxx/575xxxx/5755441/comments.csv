[V],globeplus,2010-08-11T17:04Z,DON´T FORGET TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL A VERY COMMON AND NORMAL FREE STEAM ACCOUNT BECAUSE IS NEEDED BEFORE RUNNING THE DEMO .
,NYDant,2010-08-11T22:55Z,"thanks globe for this game
n can u b more specific with dat steam thing"
,hurf123,2010-08-12T01:32Z,Um why the hell would you torrent the demo I mean it's FREE on steam for god sakes
,hurf123,2010-08-12T01:34Z,I mean really this is unneeded you can just download this for free on steam
,jainischalverma,2010-08-12T02:10Z,I cannot find any globe converter.exe in the extracted folder... What's going on?
[V],globeplus,2010-08-12T03:57Z,"To Hero_no_1 : the starcraft moved to an anonymous file but still available , it looked maybe because the high quantity of files this games that the files was a kind of packed in a zone , i don´t understand very well what happen but the file still available , the only difference is that don´t have a picture but beside that the rest is normal , i think is an exception case of a moving place torrent for some particular reason but that´s all . "
[V],globeplus,2010-08-12T04:00Z,"I know it´s free on steam but it is impossible not get this demo more fast than steam , it is less than half size comparing to the steam , how cannot it be more fast the download for god sake ?!!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-08-12T04:03Z,"To jainischalverma : disable your antivirus , a few antivirus out there in order to prevent more as possible the virus they have a real excedent of information on the scripts then any executable with a slight different structure can be read as a virus and in order to protect the computer the antivirus block automatically or maybe delete the possible thread to the computer , so disable the antivirus , do the extraction again and let´s see if you got a converter or not ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-12T04:36Z,"Independtly of internet connections speed that can oscilate inside the steam too , this file still less than half size comparing to the steam file and the conteud is the same ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-12T04:44Z,"Beside what i already said in many times they say that they can´t process the request at that time and to the user try again soon , so it is not linear that the steam can be more fast , you can have to wait and with osclilations on internet connection speed and still more than the double of the size for the same file ."
,maheepmaurya,2010-08-12T09:26Z,After disabling antivirus also can't find Globe converter.exe. You definitely did not put it in the Archive. HELP please...
[V],globeplus,2010-08-12T11:42Z,"To maheepmaurya :  don´t say things like that , the antivirus probably deleted the executable because he got suspicious on the file structure , what you to do is extract again with the antivirus disabled that´s all ."

[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T03:54Z,"i didnÂ´t get it but it looks like the demo folder after the conversion work must be at the exact location she have on steam because the data register information that steam have on the moment of the downoad and probably with the correct name of the folder , so please who not running the demo try this : change the name of the demo folder to : mafia ii - public demo , exactly as you read then move the demo folder with this name to the next location : programs or programs (x86) depeding in where the steam is installed and if it xp , vista or 7 the oprative system then steam\\steamapps\\common\\ and at the common folder inside the steam installtion put the demo folder with the refered name finally open the pc folder on the demo folder and run the Mafia2.exe and i think can really work , my only doubt is if the steamapi.dll can cause a inconvenience but maybe not , please try this and tell me if it work like this , write the correct name on the demo folder then move the demo folder to the designated location and run the demo from there and please in case of try this suggestion tell me if it worked because i have a little about the dll . thank you and try this ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T04:07Z,"I maded the test myself moving away the original demo folder then substituting at the demo folder location for my file after the conversion work and it works 100% , donÂ´t forget to change the name of the demo folder to mafia ii - public demo , with the spaces in everything then open the pc folder in the demo and run the Mafia2.exe , i repeat the path location for the demo folder : programs (x86)\\steam\\steamapps\\common\\ then the demo folder inside this common folder with the correct name , with me it worked but i have aslight doubt about the steam_api.dll but probably ok like this , please help me to help doing and presentating a steam demo worked file correctly next time and tell me using the demo folder like i am suggesting now if work or not , i repeat with me worked 100% ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T05:31Z,CHECKED AND CONFIRMED I TESTED MYSELF IT WORKS 100% BUT YOU NEED TO CREATE THE common FOLDER ON THE steamapps FOLDER IF YOU ARE RUNNING STEAM FOR THE FIRST TIME . IT WORKS LIKE THIS NO DOUBT NOW . HAPPY GAMING AND THANKS FOR THE HELP .
