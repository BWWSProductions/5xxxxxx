Just Wright (2010)

Leslie Wright is a straight-shooting physical therapist who 
gets the gig of a lifetime working with NBA All-Star Scott 
McKnight. All is going well until Leslie finds herself falling 
for Scott, forcing her to choose between the gig and the 
tug-of-war inside her heart. Oblivious to her romantic 
overtures, McKnight is instead drawn to the affections of 
Leslie's childhood friend Morgan, who has her sights set on 
being an NBA trophy wife. Is Leslie destined to play the role 
of "best friend" forever or will Scott finally see that what 
he always wanted is right in front of him?
