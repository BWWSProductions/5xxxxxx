I have dnl-ed all the RAWHIDE episodes
fromthat aren't available as torrents.
(12-08-10)
I' m uploading them to ThePirateBay for your convenience!

Lethargy being one of my Biggest Character Defects ---
I have decided to upload them ASIS - i.e.
as .mp4 files; each episode is divided into five segments put into a folder.
Each file is numbered and should cue correctly in your player.

If it won' t play = you need a codec.
Should play in WINAMP and The KMPlayer (in my opinion THE Best Player)!

Name of the torrent: *RAWHIDE (11 misc.eps.mp4 Pack1)*

ENJOY RAWHIDE!
