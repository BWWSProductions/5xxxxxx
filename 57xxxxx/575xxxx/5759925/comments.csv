,slywrp,2010-08-21T21:59Z,This sounds awful. Snaps and crackles worse than semi-invalid LP player. Is it just this release or is it like that on the original ?
,triggerfinger,2010-09-03T15:09Z,"""slywrp"" 's comment is not true, there is no snaps and crackles in this release. He's just trying to make people download the other 320kbps torrent. (which i dunno why) In my opinion this one is better because its voice is higher and have better bass sounds. You hardly hear drums in other release."
,triggerfinger,2010-09-03T15:53Z,CAREFUL !! bigger problem is that Starblind's ending is missing. It suddenly ends..
