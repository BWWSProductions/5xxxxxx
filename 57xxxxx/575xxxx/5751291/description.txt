PrisM NOTES:
Well ... we know this movie is showing on ppv in usa, so we decided to cam our tv of it :lol: for those who dont get the ppv, we dont have the equipment to cap it our selves or knowledge.
Anyway, so we cammed our 1080p LCD TV, with a HD 1080p camera ... came out pretty good :), tweaked some colours and some other random stuff.
Anyway we had to resync the audio as it didnt go with the video at all ... anyway we did encode a 700mb version of this, but it was blocky due to action scenes ... so heres 1.4gb version which aint blocky ;), just remember we had to pay 10 bucks :P

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
