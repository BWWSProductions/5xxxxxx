Release Notes:
Well.....we know this moving is showing on ppv in usa, so we decided to cam our tv of it :lol: for those who don't get the
ppv, we don't hae the equipment to cap it our selves or knowledge. Anyway, so we cammed our 1080p LCD TV, with a HD 1080p
camera...came out pretty good :), tweaked some colours and some other random stuff. Sorry don't know what as crack encoded
this one but didn't send nfo :lol: lazy :PAnyway we had to resync the audio as it didn't go with the video at all....
anyway we did encode a 700mb version of this, but it was blocky due to action scenes...so here's 1.4gb version which aint
blocky ;), just remember we had to pay 10 bucks :P
