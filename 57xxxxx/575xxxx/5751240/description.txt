Enjoy and please help me seed, so I can release more stuff faster! (^_^)

Everyone should try this show, at least that\'s what I think. In the first episode they make fun of Micheal Jackson and how weird he was and in the fourth episode, Adolf Hitler travels back in time o Mary Shelly came make it so he can tolerate the Jews, but instead he ends up love the Jewish leg of Frankenstien and all goes wrong.

This show comes on AdultSwim, I think that it\'s kinda funny, I like to watch it late at night when nothing good is on.

Show Nfo - In this stop-motion series, we follow Victor Frankenstein, the mad genius who mastered immortality and now has also created an infinite number of portals (or Frankenholes) connecting his small, Eastern European village (that is teaming with monsters and supernatural forces) to every time period from the past and the future.
