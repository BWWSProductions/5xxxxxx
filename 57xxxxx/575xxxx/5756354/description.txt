Written and created by Emily Watson Howes (the wife of stand-up comedian Mark Watson), The Ladies is a series of four narrative comedy sketches set in a ladies' public toilet. 

Each episode is a microcosm of female relationships and understandings about friendship, vanity, aspiration and the things tipsy women sing to themselves when they think no one's listening. The series featured various women as they come and go, mirroring the continuous traffic of the ladies' room. 

The Ladies was adapted from the all-female sketch show WC, which was performed at the 2007 Edinburgh Fringe by Watson Howes' sketch troupe 'The Umbrella Girls'.
