Notes / Reviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Better than ever, Joyce Coolingâ€™s 7th career album is cool and hot. This award
winning San Francisco-based guitarist brings on REVOLVING DOOR. It shows off her
renowned fluid, swinging, finger-picked bluesy-jazz technique. Her songwriting
is lyrical, soulful, and inventive with intricate interplay of hooky melodies
and deep harmonies. With her writing partner Jay Wagner, sheâ€™s created many top
radio hits â€“ expect more from REVOLVING DOOR...
