Here are the cutscenes from the PS2 RPG Final Fantasy X-2, NTSC region (US).  I needed the cutscenes for some video editing but all the available versions on the Internet were low-quality, over-converted pieces of s**t.  These videos are lossless to the point of obsession.  To ensure that there was 100% quality retention, I did accordingly:

1) Extracted .pss cutscene files directly from the game disc.
2) Extracted .m2v (video) and .wav (audio) from each of the cutscenes.
3) Used TMPGEnc 4.0 XPress to combine the .m2v and .wav files into a readily-usable .mpg file.

Sorry for the .mpg files but this was necessary to preserve the quality.  Converting to a more generic filetype, such as .avi, would've resulted in a loss-of-quality, something I was keen to avoid.

Use for your own purposes without restrictions.  Cheers mateys!
