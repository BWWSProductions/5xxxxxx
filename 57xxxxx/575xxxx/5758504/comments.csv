Thanks,

,wira020,2010-08-16T20:00Z,"@sreeja, sumbody already did departed with small size ( i dont remember ifi t was yify or riddlerA )..

@MkvGuy, how do you feel about Sliders.. It's a Tv series from the 90s... very good as i remember.. if you have the time please watch it and consider uploading it :P... thanks for all your ups dude..

For people who complain about subs.. try MKVMERGE.. it's a freeware than can separate audio,video,sub and anything in mkv... i think mp4 also can... demuxing only took me less than 10 second for a movie..."
,kuttootta,2010-08-17T07:08Z,"@ wira020 Thanks man its works,

And I don't think MKVGuy upload TV series. He already commented this in his torrents. "
,muk0690,2010-08-17T08:04Z,"@MKVGuy: 
One small suggestion man....
can you keep ur rips' resolution to 720*480 cos anything lesser than that will look pixelated in a large monitor or TV.... nowadays many hav more than 20 inch monitr n TV.

Its your wish..... Its just a small suggestion from one of your admirers..... 
Thank U... :)"
