Oh, and has any on tried that Serenity Now, A friend told me about it, he said it was good, but he is not Bi-Polar.  I am thinking about maybe trying it for my Bi-Polar, after a talk with my doctor of course. I know it is legal where I am. Anyways, I leave you with something to think about, BTW you can email me with your response @ the email in the Nfo."

I have never done any illegal drug or popped pills, snorted, sniffed, inhaled, etc. You get the drift. "
