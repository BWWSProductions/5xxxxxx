Enjoy and please help me seed, so I can release more stuff faster! (^_^)

I love this show, it is just Awesome! It gets good in the first 2 minutes. 

As far as I know there has only been 2 seasons. I have all of the first season and all but the last episode of the second season. I have searched and can't find the last episode of the 3nd season. =(

If anyone has all 6 episodes of the 2nd season and they would upload them or just the last episode somewhere and give me the link, I would be very happy and then I could release the 2nd season for PSP, iPod, and Zune.

Show Nfo - Ex-special forces operative and convicted murderer John Mercer is awarded an early release from prison on the condition that he becomes an assassin for the government.
