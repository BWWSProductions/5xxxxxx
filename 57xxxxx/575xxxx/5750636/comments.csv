This movie is inspired by the Rev. Jim Jones incident, the San Franciscan preacher and wanna-be faith healer who led 909 innocent people to mass suicide in South America.

Umberto Lenzi added a twist of cannibalism to this movie and therefore, making it a MUST HAVE for the GRINDHOUSE collector. With lots of nudity, blood, and a poison-tipped dildo scene, this movie is really worth watching. Keep Seeding.
