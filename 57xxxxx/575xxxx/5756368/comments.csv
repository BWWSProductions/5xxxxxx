how comes your encodes are low res (320x240)? they look pixelated on ipod touch/ iPhone, couldn't you do 480xXXX? instead plz"

[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-12T02:01Z,"@ nbdelboy - do all of my encodes look pixelated? If you could go in to more detail about it, it would be helpful. (^_^) 
The reason why I prefer 320x240 is cuz when watch it on any of my PSPs I can choose from 3-4 different display settings and I know that this res works on all the devices that I say it to work on. My stuff looks good on a XBOX360 and WDTV Media Player. "
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-12T02:05Z,"@ nbdelboy - I can try to encoding @ 480, I just hav had trouble in the past with it when using certain files codecs like mkv and a couple of others. I am currently learning how to encode with a couple of other programs like Handbrake with trial and error. (^_^)"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-12T02:10Z,Also I dont have an iPhone or an iPod Touch  and I dont know anyone close to me or that has one that could test my stuff out so I could get the best settings so it works on most devices. (^_^)

,nbdelboy,2010-08-12T21:09Z,"@ the day walker, 

sorry i wasn't really clear, when watching them they look pixelated like say when you watch SD on a full 1080p HDTV, the size your encoding to is ipod classic size, half the size of the touch/iPhone screen, which is what i meant by pixelated"
