The CoCreate product family is a complete design environment, offering
3D CAD and 2D CAD, CAE and integrated product data management (PDM). A
broad set of add-on design modules brings additional product
development capabilities to CoCreate CAD and PDM products. CoCreate
provides speed, flexibility, and responsiveness-to-change for
customers facing short design cycles, one-off product designs, or
companies demanding a lightweight design process. This explicit
approach to 3D CAD software design delivers faster design cycles and
flexibility to the 3D design.
