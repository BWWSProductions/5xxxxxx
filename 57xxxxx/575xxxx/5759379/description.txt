HOW DOES IT WORK?

Type n Walkâ„¢ displays a transparent viewport of what\\\'s directly in front of you. This combined with your peripheral vision is just enough visual information to help you avoid obstacles -- like walking face-first into a pole!

Despite the name, Type n Walkâ„¢ is useful while you\\\'re sitting or standing too. Use it anytime you would like to keep an eye on your surroundings while you type.


WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?

Type n Walkâ„¢ was designed to work WITH your favorite apps -- NOT try to REPLACE them. Use it to compose your email, text message, Facebook or Twitter update and paste it into your preferred apps (or the web browser) to send.


SOME EXAMPLES OF USE:

TEXTING (SMS) --> paste into the native messaging app and send.

EMAIL --> paste into the native email app (or web mail) and send.

FACEBOOK --> paste into the Facebook app (or mobile website) and send.

TWITTER --> paste into your favorite Twitter app (or mobile website) and send.

NOTES --> write a quick note or reminder to yourself.


In fact, Type n Walkâ„¢ was designed to work with ANY app that accepts copy and paste and ANY website that works correctly in the native mobile web browser.


HOW DO YOU USE IT?

Simple. Just open up Type n Walkâ„¢ and begin typing. When you\\\'re done:

STEP 1: Open up the \\\'Actions Menu\\\' (found on the upper right hand corner of the screen).

STEP 2: Select a \\\'Quick Launch\\\' item.

STEP 3: Paste and send.

That\\\'s it! It\\\'s that easy.


What are you waiting for, get Type n Walkâ„¢ now!
