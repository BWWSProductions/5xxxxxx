A long-exposure Hubble Space Telescope image shows a majestic face-on spiral galaxy located deep within the Coma Cluster of galaxies, which lies 320 million light-years away in the northern constellation Coma Berenices. The galaxy, known as NGC 4911, contains rich lanes of dust and gas near its center. These are silhouetted against glowing newborn star clusters and iridescent pink clouds of hydrogen, the existence of which indicates ongoing star formation. Hubble has also captured the outer spiral arms of NGC 4911, along with thousands of other galaxies of varying sizes. The high resolution of Hubble's cameras, paired with considerably long exposures, made it possible to observe these faint details.

This natural-color Hubble image, which combines data obtained in 2006, 2007, and 2009 from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys, required 28 hours of exposure time.

Macri (National Optical Astronomy Observatories, AURA), J. Mould (University of Melbourne), P. Stetson (Dominion Astrophysical Observatory), and D. Welch (McMaster University); and 11956: K. Noll, Z. Levay, L. Frattare, C. Christian, F. Hamilton, and H. Bond (Hubble Heritage Team/STScI).
Instrument: 	ACS/WFC and WFPC2
Exposure Date(s): 	December 2006 â€“ January 2007 and January 2009 â€“ February 2009
Exposure Time: 	28 hours
Filters: 	F450W (B), F606W (V), F673N (redshifted H-alpha), and F814W (I)
About the Image 	
Image Credit: 	NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)
Release Date: 	August 10, 2010
Color: 	The image is a composite of separate exposures made by the ACS and WFPC2 instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope. Four filters were used to sample broad and narrow wavelength ranges. The color results from assigning different hues (colors) to each monochromatic image. In this case, the assigned colors are:
F450W (B) 	blue
F606W (V) 	green
F673N (redshifted H-alpha) 	red
F814W (I) 	red
