VOICE FOR TOMTOM navigation


I disliked the fake Patrick Stewart voice that exists for TomTom that I decided to make the real one using the information I found here: 
http://create.tomtom.com/manuals/create-your-own-content/
I edited together clips of Captain Jean-Luc Picard\'s voice from various Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes to come up with the 59 voice commands.
As a result, it does not sound perfect! It is sometimes choppy, humorous, and even robotic sounding.
Overall, however, it is much better than the fake one and includes a few neat ST:TNG sounds.
Hope you enjoy it and if you don\'t, well, you didn\'t pay for it, so just don\'t use it.
Also, do not sell this. I created it out of a geek labor of love. You may freely distribute but do not charge any money for it!
Thanks,
-Staz

2. When in TomTom, go to Change Preferences and then Voice Preferences, Change Voice, click on arrows until you find Captain Jean-Luc Picard and choose select.



Not my rip just share!
