           Colonel Douglas Mortimer and Manco are a pair of       
           bounty hunters who overcome their mutual distrust      
           and join together to go after Indio, a dope-smoking    
         psychopathic bandit who plans to rob the bank in      
        El Paso. Manco is only interested in the reward        
        money, but Mortimer has more personal reasons for       
        wanting to get Indio.
