,Eth1c,2011-02-11T06:07Z,"Just to verify for those who'm come across this torrent wondering if the last posters information was still accurate, I have been attempting to snag this torrent for about a month, there are absolutely NO seeders past the 85.3% mark.

This is regretful as I love Agent M in Tsunami Bomb.

She does now have a new band, ""The Action Design"" I have not found a good torrent for that group either, saddens me when crap like Lil Wayne is so easily obtained but these are not.

Live Long And Prosper My Fellow Seeders.

,Eth1c,2011-03-03T14:39Z,I've revived this torrent from another torrent and you should now be able to download it completely. 
,Eth1c,2011-03-03T14:43Z,"Actually that's a lie, its now showing 99.8% complete with the exception of "" \definite act\04 Safety Song.mp3"" which shows 92.1% of the song complete but tested the file and it plays perfectly. "
,eleventy4,2011-03-18T02:15Z,"Thanks for this torrent, as my old cds are so scratched up and I burned them all at 128kb/sec.  Honestly, I suggest everyone go onto iTunes and buy Safety Song, since it's a great number and they deserve a bit of cash"
,Spaeher,2011-04-08T05:05Z,"@Eth1c  Yeah, same thing here, it says it isn't done but it is... just checked too. 

Thanks be to all involved!"
