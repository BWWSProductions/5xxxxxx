                    Happy Camping.                           
                    Pearl throws Howard out of the house, but when  
                    he goes to Clegg's for sympathy it falls on  
                    deaf ears, while Pearl tells Nelly she's going  
                    to have to sort out Howard once and for all.  
                    Meanwhile, Glenda decides that Barry and  
                    herself are fat and that something must be done  
                    before Gloria's wedding, and forces Barry to  
                    embark on a new fitness regime. And PC Walsh  
                    informs PC Cooper that the sergeant is on their  
                    back - he's complaining about the amount of  
                    crumbs they're leaving in the car.
