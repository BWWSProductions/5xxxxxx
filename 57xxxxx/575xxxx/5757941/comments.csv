,Ypollukas,2010-08-27T19:50Z,Nevermind my previous comment ... the .iso wasn't showing because I didn't have a program installed (magiciso) that could read .iso files. So by default it appeared as a winrar file.

It also labels it as ""CD"" instead of ""DVD"" (but so does it on the other laptop, except all files are showing when looking in Explorer in Win XP there, and it installed without problem)

Even burned it a second time, using 3x burning since the first one was 8x and thought it might have been due to that but still same problem on other machine, only black screen, and the DVD seem empty when checked in Windows XPs file explorer. What the heck?"

Just one hitch... in the lower right corner of my screen it now says:

Windows 7
Build 7600
This copy of Windows is not genuine.

is there any way to get rid of it, or do i need to worry about it? I'm assuming I can't get automatic updates as long as that's there...

thanks!"
,darkbreed,2010-08-28T00:23Z,"Yes.. It is only couple months old and both reads and writes CDs and DVDs.. So is nothing about that. I suspect a physical error, as at one point the computer suddenly shut itself off when the DVD was inserted. So, for now dont know the exact error but most likely hardware since its happening at the very bootup and I tested another DVD which it also had some problem reading. Will take the mentioned laptop for repair/change as it still got warranty, and hopefully things will work fine then.

Thanks for the tips etc, dont think there's much I can do with this one, as I assume even copying the Win7 boot to a SD memory card and then copying it into the other laptop and unpacking it and running the setup from there, or via a virtual DVD station software like poweriso, still will ask for the orginal DVD in the actual DVD drive during reboot etc`?"

So if you have issues with pre-activation you will be forced to some activator

Use the loader named: (Windows.7.Loader.eXtreme.Edition.v3.503-NAPALUM.zip

,crassman,2010-09-06T04:44Z,"Hello there ,I tried to load this as a dual boot on a patitioned hard drive on my laptop,BEWARE,it does need a fresh install.
I currently have a cracked xp pro on my laptop after downgrading from vista,only problem was the recovery partition from the vista preinstall is still on here.
After a failed install the laptop rebooted with an error message saying that the recovery partition will not work.
I got the xp back with the recovery console (thank god).
I have installed this on a desktop pc  I have and it upgraded from a freshly installed cracked xp pro,updated (without the kB971033 update)and it seems to be working like a dream.
Will try on my laptop at a later date.
Thanks to froggie100 for this torrent,all I will say is,if you are going to install this on a machine which has a recovery partiton on it from the os you have now, make sure that is removed as well.
Back up any files you need ,make sure you have the drivers needed,(downgrading from vista to xp pro I found that the oem packed vista drivers disc would not work).
Lastly,if this torrent doesn,t work for you make sure you have the discs and drivers to put your  old operating system back on,its surprising how many people lose,or didn,t have the the discs in the first place."

2. Bootable DVD- hangs infinitely on blue bird screen. 

3. Setup my IDE HD as a bootable drive, to install windows onto my SATA drive no luck the drive doesn't want to boot.

,Bearkodiac,2010-09-20T06:57Z,"The last comment from me is that if you did download the update (KB971033) you still have a chance at activation.

Go to http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/8632-Windows-Loader-The-Official-Thread and read the whole forum for information on a loader from Daz.  It's a bit less complicated than the one included here.

I now have a fully activated copy of Win7 Ultimate.

However this entire/afternoon evening I've been having freezes and issues.

Here's the background:

Have an Asus p5q-e mobo with SoundMax HD onbiard.

I installed this download by extracting into a blank partition and double clicking setup.exe which means that it created the Windows.old dir. I also saw that my wamp directory is in the same place.

The issue shows up with my sound drivers.  I've read through all 14 pages of comments and see that others have had sound driver issues as well although in those cases it seemed to be only those with Realtek, not SoundMax.

Also, when I plug in my Sennheiser USB headsets in, the device manager the yellow triangle for the USB Composite device.

Has anyone else had this issue with this particular setup?

I've run chkdsk and done a memory test. The good news is that they came up clean and the fact that I'm stable in safe mode tells me it's not a hardware issue. I've let Windows Update handle it, tried manually downloading the drivers. Changed out the drivers for my 9500GT to try and evade any conflicts and am getting nowhere.

I have WhoCrashed downloading and will see what it can dig up since I'm no good at reading kernel dumps.

Can anyone lend a hand?

Nearing 24 hours without a hiccup.

Going to get a new cheapy headset for €10 with 3.5mm jacks and be done with the headaches.

However, I have unfortunately needed another re-install on the same laptop and have run into some issues. The first attempt at RE-INSTALL, was about a month after perfect use. The laptop crashed while I was at work this weekend and would no longer launch into windows (or properly execute a system restore).

Re-install went smooth and all seemed well until windows explorer launched. It was taking anywhere from 30-60 seconds to execute simple commands like launching my computer or recycle bin. Per suggestion of a close, friend I decided to do yet another clean install, and verifying all partitions were removed, etc. I took video of the install to ensure all procedures were followed correctly. However, this time when windows explorer launched, I immediately received a non-genuine notice on the desktop. I verified on the video that all settings were correct (no auto-update, and unchecked verification box). 

A bit befuddled I attempted to do yet another clean install. Any repeat attempts (despite clearing partitions, etc), now error out immediately after the black cmd window launches. The install claims ""cd-key blah blah blah"" installed successfully, but after the cmd window closes I get a message saying ""the windows installation was unable to complete successfully"" and continues on to reboot. 

I'm a tad lost on where to turn now, any and all help would be greatly appreciated."

,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-01T08:35Z,"ATTENTION ANYBODY HAVING PROBLEMS INSTALLING Windows 7:

Microsoft has a little tool that saved my ass during my install, I do not know any other way I could of installed the Win-7 ISO without this tool:

Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool
http://store.microsoft.com/help/iso-tool

The tool, when run, will ask for the name and location of the ISO and append a self=boot to the beginning. Once the installation got done with pass 1 and rebooted I had to swap Windows 7 install disc (or USB stick) by removing the install with the MS appended boot with the disc made strictly from the ISO. Just maybe this Microsoft tool could help others to install Win-7, especially handy when having problems formatting in anything BUT Fat32 which will not work, or just can not find a method to kick start the install disc. Just remember you will likely need two Windows DVDs, the pure one made from the ISO AND the first DVD which will have this Microsoft tool appended to make it boot-able until it reboots and you can swap out the disc for the pure one made from the iso.

Im not sure Microsoft allows one to download this tool more than once, based on how their agreement is written. So be sure to back it up, it may be needed again if needed for the install.

This method was fully tested with both 43 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows 7 Ultimate and worked perfectly. (just have to remember to swap discs when the install first reboots so it can continue from a disc made strictly from a Win-7 ISO.

Sorry if I am difficult to understand, as I am very sleepy.

,AF4C,2010-10-07T22:38Z,"I'm back. First off, i burned the windows disk at 1x speed and then checked it to the image with imgburn. it's just fine.

secondly, i took out one stick of memory and it froze earlier... then i took out the other stick and it froze AFTER installing, right as I was putting in my new username/password. Does this mean the mushkin ram is a piece of shit? I found a program that does a boot scan of the memory to see if it's bad, and i'll use that in a miute and report back here. I really hope it WASN'T the mushkin ram, because I already had to RMA my mobo AND processor back to newegg. 

So if it got past that stage once... then froze after, i'm assuming it must be my RAM. should i do further testing before I send it back? "

it froze earlier than before when i used just 1 stick or RAM
it froze AFTER (when i used the other stick of memory) at the new username/password screen

I've decided to do this using the USB method. I just wanna see if I understood it correctly.

So this is what I do:

1. Follow the steps on the link (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd535816.aspx) to prepare my USB hard drive.
2. I download this torrent - extract the .iso (inside 'Windows 7 Ultimate' folder).
3. Copy all of the extracted files into the USB hard drive.
4. Then boot the system as usb - voila?

But one question. How do I make the system boot though the usb? 

Thanks for any help! "
,dranika,2010-10-09T14:07Z,"Actually, I made it. I just changed the boot order and priored USB first.

Then Gods voice appears again in the sky and asks, tell me who you are Florencia. Florencia answers, i`m Florencia the daughter of the local town major, i didn`t ask who his daughter you are,but who you are God answers, shy she says, i`m Florencia and i have to confess i do girls and boys both. God answers, i didn`t ask you if you bisexual or not but who you are. I visit every week the church she says, i didn`t ask you what you are doing but who you are God answers again. And so the questions did go on, every thing she said didn`t seem to be the right answer. Then he said, do you like to know who you are, shall i tell it to you? The only thing we can be in our mind or in our nature is or a woman or a man, all the rest is imagination of our personality. Nature it is humans are, and already for hundred thousands of generations, and will stay like that.

Who do you think you are finally she asks God,
well he says, the answer to that question is amazingly easy, i`m a product of humans suffering, of their love compassion and solidarity to eachother. Being unknowing and stuppid truly does let most people suffering in whole their life, being a true human will change the border between being nature and being just a human, life in mind will get endless of it, and it will make you free from suffering.

,Harichan,2010-10-20T02:58Z,"trin, I do hope your still around on here. I have a question. I was given a Compaq Presario with a 2 disc recovery set that installs Vista Premium. Could this upgrade be applied to that or do I need to start off from scratch on the Microsoft Windows 7 Final Retail? "
,teirwin,2010-10-20T03:53Z,"I also had a hard time installing this version of 7 on an Acer desktop PC. Randomly the bootmgr would stop working(choice of operating systems). It would instead show a flashing cursor after doing the initial boot of the devices. Windows wouldn't start to load.

My solution was to use the windows 7 usb/cd and do a repair, which failed, then select command prompt. 

I noticed with the some basic dos commands i could copy the bootmgr from one drive letter to my C drive of windows 7 and then rebooting and then repair worked to fix the install. 

I will assume this was a problem with this acer machine and that this version of 7 is like the one I use on my home pc, if not I will let you know.

Steps If windows installs but wont load:
-boot windows cd/usb
-press next
-press repair
-choose install to fix (might be just 1)
-try repair this usually fixes a windows boot problem.

If not...
-boot windows cd/usb
-press next
-press repair
-choose install to fix (might be just 1)
-choose command prompt
(doing a quick Google of ""dos commands"" helps)
-type c:
-type dir
-you should see your windows folder but no boot mgr as its hidden
-type dir /a 
-you see all files including bootmgr
- now letter by letter check for another bootmgr which isnt hidden, depending on how many drives your pc has this can take a couple minutes. Mine was drive L as I have a lof drives.
example 1
-type d:
-type dir 
example 2
-type e:
-type dir
keep doing this alphabetically until you see bootmgr, once you do then...
type copy bootmgr c:
type Y
this will confirm the overwrite of the bootmgr.
It will be a bad bootmgr which will force a fix.
there is probably a better way to make an acer machine work with this version of windows 7, but this worked for me today. I used the usb method as the cd method was inconsistent with this acer machine.

good luck."
,teirwin,2010-10-20T04:02Z,"Oh ya to force the fix, repeat the repair process:
-boot windows cd/usb
-press next
-press repair
-choose install to fix (might be just 1)
-try repair this usually fixes a windows boot problem.

This time it will repair and work because the bootmgr will be bad and need fixing.
this only helped fix this acer computer.
Usually a simple repair in step 1 will work for a windows 7 that wont load."

I choose partition 2 since it is bigger.

Next then it's copying windows files, expanding windows files, ect... wihtout any problems. (it just takes a while but I figured it was normal)

It goes throught ''setup id preparing your computer for first use'' right after I see ''setup is checking video'' or something very similar to this, type in the name I want for the computer, password ect...

Product key there is none, and I un-check automatically activate windows when I'm online and I skip the network (last time I tryed) other times I was clicking for home network.

I see the black window that says that the product key was correctly installed, and get an error not to long after (never got the chance to see what it was cuz it's there for not even 1 sec)

It goes to preparing your desktop screen and now, after doing every step and typing everything I was doing, it seems to be working and I feel stupid right about now lol."

This worked fine for me.  Burned ISO to dvd, ran it in a virtual machine for a while. I found that after some time and a few updates the windows validation will fail and say that this is not an authentic copy of windows. 

The way around that was to download RemoveWAT.exe.  Now there is no nag and the updates work fine.  Good luck."

K, how i did to get it work? 

1. After you downloaded this torrent open it and click (right mousebutt) on the Image and choose ""open with"" >> Nero or b) open Nero Smart Start and choose the 5th tab named ""Backup"" and click on ""Burn Image to Disc"". Keep that the Image is already bootable and no DVD-Rom(Boot) needed!!!

2. Burn the Image with the speed of x4 and thats all for the Image to DVD Process.

3. Place the DVD in your DiskDrive and after you restart your pc, enter the Bios >>Boot>> and set the first section to CD (set the rest of it to ""disable"") >>F10 (save setting >>yes"
,rollintuktukbbrambram,2010-12-09T22:39Z,"4. Exit the Bios and it will restart (boot) immediatelly. 

NWO pls Note!! While it boot press ""F8"" and enter the ""Boot Menue"" which is going to appear and choose that DiskDrive in which the DVD is -safe and exit. After that you will get your ""Start from CD ..... Presssss any Key.

Note!! Press your ""Anykey"" quick or it disappears and you will get a black screen.

After that you can going to install your ripped Win7 (oops.. ^^! i did it again) and make it work.

I hope i could help some guys in here which are getting rid while they are going to burn their fiftieth DVD.
Pls do not ask for further experience 1. iÂ´am also a newbie and 2. i installed it untill the ""choose your destiny""-screen came up (Language, Time and Keyboard-Settings) then, i broke the Install. down cause iÂ´am waiting for Sat. to bring it on.

The programm and sys. i used 4 :: Nero 7 and Winblub prof. xp64

As I understand, the Windows 7 SP1 update contains the KB971033 update. ( according to documentation released by microsoft).

Do you mean to say that even after installing the SP1 update, you are able to validate windows and that it remains activated?
or
Are you just saying that it is possible to install windows 7 SP1 over this installation of windows 7?

OR
Is there any way to chose out of installing Kb971033 duringthe installation of SP1?"

,docanddoc,2011-03-20T19:13Z,"Can this ISO be used to create a bootable Windows 7 installation USB pen drive? 

Tried using the official 'Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool' from Microsoft but it gives a message that this isn't a valid ISO file. 
So
Tried using ""ISOAVDPCOPY.EXE"" from http://www.withinwindows.com/2009/11/01/use-the-windows-7-usbdvd-download-tool-with-custom-isos/ but it gives a message that ""the ISO is read only"". I already knew that ISO 9660 was a read-only file system. I wonder what the exe was aiming to do in the first place??

Also tried extracting ALL the contents of the iso and transferring the files to a NTFS formattted 8GB pen drive and making it bootable by going to the command promt(as admin), going into the pen drive and typing ""cd boot"" and then ""bootsect /nt60 E: /force"" where E: was my pen drive's drive letter. Going by this method, i was able to boot into the USB drive after computer restart but didn't progress any further than the blinking curser which comes up before the installation (ie. the loading files) finally starts.

Does anybody know of any other way?"

,xpdamus,2011-03-31T04:34Z,"Those of you wanting to install via USB, i can highly recommend 'Win2Flash' - just google it.

I've got a netbook with no optical drive, so using Win2Flash you just plug in a USB stick (3GB+) and point the program to the windows 7 ISO file, and within a few minutes it makes the stick bootable and wel... perfect.

Just make sure you set your netbook to boot to USB and you're away and laughing.

I've been using this Windows 7 version for few months now, and after hiding the KBxxxxx33 its been running perfectly - i only came back because i'm getting the service pack 1 update, and i'm wondering if its been ok for you guys...

Cheers."
,docanddoc,2011-03-31T08:28Z,"@xpdamus
SP1 works fine on this version of Windows7. Activation is not lost. Windows is still recognised as fully validated ang genuine.
Just keep hiding the KBxxxxx33 update if it prompts you to install it again.

Did you use ""WinToFlash"" - "" http://wintoflash.com/download/en/ "" to install this version of Windows7 through a USB pen drive?"
,xpdamus,2011-03-31T13:14Z,"@docanddoc

Yes thats the Win2Flash i used. Its absolutely the best ISO to USB install i've ever used, and i highly recommend it.

I used it to install this very Windows 7 from this torrent onto my Advent 4213 notebook - it works a charm!

One note is that when windows collects all the data and installs and reboots.... remove the USB stick or else it will try to load all the files and try to install again. Its just a simple case of pulling out the USB when the computer reboots, and once you get the windows loading screen plug it back in.

Win2Flash is fucking awesome for this! i've recovered a screwed Vista install on another pc using it also.

Cheers."

,Tha_Unknown_One,2011-10-07T22:39Z,"Okay, I read all 35 pages of comments, thank you for the help as they have truly helped during this process. However I have an issue noone else seemed to have. I burn the disk using poweriso. Once I try to install the disk, I get past selecting a language and such. I select custom install and once it gets to extracting windows files, it does not move past 0%. After about 10 minutes of waiting, I receive a message saying ""Windows Cannot install required files. Make sure all files required for installation are available and restart the installation"". I burned the disk using poweriso and I tried it twice, once with a burn speed of 4x and again with 2x. Any help with this issue guys?"
