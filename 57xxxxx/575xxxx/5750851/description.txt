Gimme Dat Ding (1971) is a split album by Sweet (side one) and The Pipkins (side two), released on EMI's budget record label, MFP (Music For Pleasure) in 1970. It is also the title of a song from the album.
Side One was given over to (then) fledgling pop band The Sweet and features the A & B-sides of what were three commercially unsuccessful singles (on Parlophone Records) before the band finally found fame with "Funny Funny" released by RCA Records. Despite the cover shot of The Sweet featuring Andy Scott, he was not actually a band member until "Funny Funny" and does not feature on any of these recordings. The band's guitarist then was Mick Stewart (who replaced Frank Torpey) and wrote two of the featured B-sides on this compilation.
