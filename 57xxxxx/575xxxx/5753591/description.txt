Criticism of the Bible - Collection 7 (Folklore, Myths & Legends in the Bible):

Although many of the teachings of the Bible may have their roots in the revelations received by Moses and other Jewish Prophets, these teachings were corrupted as folklore, myths and legends found their way into the Scripture. These corruptions were made by the people who wrote the Bible, or copied it, or translated it. Most of these corruptions may be unintentional, but many were intentional.
