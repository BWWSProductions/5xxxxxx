,patrik_gugua,2010-10-08T04:01Z,Yup...Mp3's. But thank you very much for all of the other seasons. Greatly appreciated!
,hoffy97,2010-10-09T20:20Z,"I think they are ok.  The sizes are way too big for mp3's, and when I do a ""file"" on them, I get the same file type as the other episodes/seasons.  Try just renaming them to "".avi"" and they should work fine."
