                                Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) was released to manufacturing on April 21, 2008, 
and to the public via both the Microsoft Download Center and Windows Update on 
May 6, 2008. It began being automatically pushed out to Automatic Update users 
on July 10, 2010. A feature set overview which details new features available 
separately as standalone updates to Windows XP, as well as backported features 
from Windows Vista has been posted by Microsoft. A total of 1,174 fixes have 
been included in SP3. Service Pack 3 can be installed on systems with Internet 
Explorer versions 6, 7 or 8. Internet Explorer 7 and 8 are not included as part 
of SP3.

With Windows XP Professional Edition with Service Pack 3, you get safer browsing 
and communication, powerful security tools, and improved experiences. Windows XP 
is the operating system release that unifies the Microsoft range, with all the 
desktop versions now built on the NT/2000 code base rather than the shakier 
foundation of Windows 95, 98, and Me. That makes XP a great upgrade for users of 
the now obsolete 9x and Me line, but for those already on Windows 2000 
Professional it is a closer call. Despite the similar name, there is no special 
synergy between Windows XP and Office XP.

* Automatically keep your PC up to date with the latest security enhancements 
including the Windows Security Center, Windows Firewall.
* Windows XP Professional provides rich, wireless network support, helping you 
simply and easily connect to wireless networks whether in your home, office, or 
out on the road.
* Quickly set up and connect all the computers, printers, devices, and an 
Internet connection in your home with the all new Network Setup Wizard.
* Encrypting File System provides an additional level of file protection from 
hackers and data theft by transparently encrypting files with a randomly 
generated key.
* Clean, simple design of Windows XP Professional puts the features you use most 
often at your fingertips, helping you find them quickly.

All of these license keys are genuine XP license keys
so after you use them, you can update windows etc 
without restrictions. wga and etc will no detect this.

If you are using windows xp media center 2005, you need
to apply a particular patch before you use this, 
otherwise you'll get locked out before you get a chance
to do anything else


the reason why i know these are all genuine is because
i've taken them from acer computers which have windows
xp installed on them.


this should work on all versions of windows xp.
