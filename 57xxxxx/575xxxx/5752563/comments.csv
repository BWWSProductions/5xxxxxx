,ninjaracoon,2010-08-14T06:49Z,"@droid80sa - try this one, it has a separate english subtitle (softsub), bigger resolution, smaller filesize, better quality(check out the screenshots)

There was a mistake made during this encode and the subtitles werent added as thought. The subtitles have been upped to subscene under the same file name.

I think it should be smaller, it has only  channel audio, but this one has 2 and 6 channel, and you should know what the size of 6 channel,

is the video is good quality, I do not see yet"
