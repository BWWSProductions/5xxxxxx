Street-racing manga Wangan Midnight speeds to the big screen in the 2009 live-action adaptation Wangan Midnight The Movie. Serialized in Young Magazine since 1992, Kusunoki Michiharu's Wangan Midnight has inspired an anime and a series of movies and video games. Directed by Muroga Atsushi (Super Cub), Wangan Midnight The Movie stars heartthrobs Nakamura Yuichi (Princess Princess D) and Kato Kazuki (Days with You) as the storied rival street racers Asakura Akio and Shima Tatsuya. The film also co-stars Kobayashi Ryoko (Helen the Baby Fox), Yonehara Kosuke from Run & Gun, Matsumoto Rio (God's Puzzle), and veteran Sugata Shun.

Speed-loving high school senior Akio (Nakamura Yuichi) challenges doctor Tatsuya (Kato Kazuki) to a race on the freeway, but he gets outgunned by Tatsuya and his Turbo 964 "Blackbird". Determined to win back his pride, Akio trades in his Fairlady Z31 for a Fairlady S30 that he salvages from the scrapyard. This Fairlady S30, however, has a backstory. Nicknamed "Devil Z", it is unnaturally fast, and all of its previous owners have crashed and burned, spawning a legend that the car is cursed.
