,gourang,2010-08-15T14:04Z,for anyone having doubts: audio is fine
,mrpras,2010-08-17T20:43Z,"audio is fine for me too, but there are a couple of errors in the download (yes I've rechecked it). Including one small skip right at the end that spoils the punchline..

I hope someone else does a 720p of this episode (it's not a great one anyway imho).."
,mrpras,2010-08-27T03:00Z,"Correction, the glitch must have been something else. It happened at the time cos the file was being accessed.. It's perfect.."
