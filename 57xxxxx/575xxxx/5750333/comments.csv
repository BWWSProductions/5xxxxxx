,-Leto-,2010-08-10T08:52Z,"Thanks for the upload but picture quality is really poor. Get this one instead :
TNA.Hardcore.Justice.2010.The.Last.Stand.HDTV.x264-RUDOS.mp4
not a lot bigger (1.75GB) but 700x400 and much better video quality. You can get it on xtreme-wrestling-network.c*o*m "

,DeltaPan,2010-08-10T11:36Z,"Viewed this last night and don't agree with Leto.

Don't think he actually D/L'd it even, just interested in diverting people to the wrestling tracker.

Quality is fine, equal to one of the better weekly show (+-)700MB XviD encodings, not blocky and perfectly enjoyable with no wrestlers movements missed from low quality, sound ok etc.

What one expects from a PDTV release in fact and i've seen a couple of HDTV which were below par occasionally but PDTV is very consistant.

Thanks again for the upload amanrulz  matey, arrrrrrrr. : )"
