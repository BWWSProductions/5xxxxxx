,fakebest,2010-08-11T23:51Z,this is nuked it goes out of sync at 60 min. until end of the movie but if you have vlc or mkvmerge you can fix that easily

,AKD73,2010-11-25T19:04Z,"Does go out of sync at 60 mins.
Watch on a PC watch with VLC Media Player. To adjust audio (when it goes out of sync) Select >Tools >Track Synchronization Then adjust Audio/Video to -3.000s Then resume play."
