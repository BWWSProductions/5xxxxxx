Theme Description

The Darksiders Theme consists of 20+ GOW Wallpapers, Custom Icons and Game Sounds. It would give you a complete Game experience on your Windows 7 Desktop.

Darksiders has been called a combination of God Of War, Legacy of Kain and Devil May Cry by several gaming buffs and I tend to agree. However I thought that the story is pretty well done and quite original. Most importantly, the gameplay is easily picked up and you only get better the more you play.

Darksiders allows you to take on the role of War, first horseman of the apocalypse, who has been tricked into bringing about a war between heaven and hell, the result of which was heavenâ€™s defeat and the Earthâ€™s enslavement. You are sent to Earth because the last of the Seven Seals has been broken, or so your character thinks. This game will keep you glued to the end."

    * On War’s right shoulder (his shoulder pad) is a face similar to Samael’s faces,although it is often though that this represent exactly Samael’s face,the case that we can find similar carvings throughout the game implies that it is more a generic demonic face.
    * One amazing trait in the game is that when War falls down an abyss or gap at low health he will not lose health. It is impossible to die by falling."
