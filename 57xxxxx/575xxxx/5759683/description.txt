The video for track 2 off of MC Lars' album This Gigantic Robot Kills. I have that album available here:

The song features Wheatus, and Weird Al. (Yankovic only plays accordion)

The video itself has a feel of appropriately-dressed sock puppets acting out the song. (Some of the background is animated; some of it consists of RL imagery)
