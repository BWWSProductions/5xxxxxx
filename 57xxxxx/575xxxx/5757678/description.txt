                    Adult multi-species puppet comedy about five

                    pedigree It-bitch Destiny; wannabe tomcat  
                    Marion; cynical pigeon Kali; and sociopath  
                    Vince. Marion falls in with a crowd who are  
                    determined to stop humans from celebrating  
                    bonfire night forever by blowing up the pub.  
                    Destiny is chosen to become a photographer's
