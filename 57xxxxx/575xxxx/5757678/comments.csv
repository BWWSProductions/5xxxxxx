No worries though, love this show, and am willing to wait! This show will be a cult classic some day, hopefully Comedy Central picks it up soon!"
,blackmoonbear,2010-08-13T04:41Z,"Seriously....98 leechers and 2 F*cking seeders?!?!?!?
Bless the two of you, F*ck the other 98 of you!!!!!
TvT...Plz fix this shit and I will seed ad-infitintum!
I have 1-6 seeded, what happened to episode 7? (or does ""uncovered"" count as 7?)

P.S....SEED!SEED!SEED! You selfish lazy bastards!!! don't download without sharing the wealth!!!!"

Thanks for sharing"
