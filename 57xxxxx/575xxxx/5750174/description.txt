The fourth instalment in Ministry of Sound's PUMP IT UP series, BURN IT, LOSE IT takes you on an aerobics workout professionally programmed by award-winning fitness instructor, Agata Pienio. Warm up with a 'foundation' session, then choose from 'beatbox' (a high impact combat-aerobics session), 'pump it up' (a dance aerobics session), or 'below the belt' (a bums, tums and thighs session), before cooling down with a 'knockout' session.
