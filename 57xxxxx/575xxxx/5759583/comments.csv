BTW could you tell me the exact models of your aerosmith - greatest hits, acdc - back in black, rolling stones - hot rocks, queen - greatest hits, rush - moving pictures, rush - 2112, rush - farwell "
,retardoface,2010-08-13T20:41Z,"ive been trying to tell you the website on here but piratebay wont let me or someshit, says database error"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-08-14T05:24Z,"just put a bunch of spaces in beteen, i'll figure it out..."
,retardoface,2010-08-14T19:11Z,ill put the lets abc in between aABCvABCaABCxABChABCoABCmABCeABC.ABCwABCs
[V],HMVinyl,2010-08-15T01:36Z,"ya figured it out ;) It's nice to see an actual website dedicated to audiophile rips, only theres 2 problems, 1: they only accept ""Audiophile Pressings"" (i mainly do original pressings) and 2: i really hate using services like megashare, i'd much rather torrent my uploads, i've got a pretty good system and i don't want to slow it down.

thanks though, i can see why you'd want to show me that site

i also found it intesting that G-N.Team, uploaded my The Who - Live at Leeds rip... (at leased they credited me a few times on the page) "
,retardoface,2010-08-15T08:59Z,ya and also queen greatest hits im fucking drunk as fuck goodbye
,retardoface,2010-08-15T18:41Z,"For one thing i gave you that site so you could learn and become better at vinyl ripping. Secondly audiophile rips are any vinyl rip at 24 bit 96 khz and higher, doesnt necessarily mean the actually LPs are audiophile. I understand you want to torrent your shit i respect that. Could you tell me the record versions of those records i said above please."
