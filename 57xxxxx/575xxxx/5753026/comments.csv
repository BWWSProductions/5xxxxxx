Feel free to leave some comments and or profanities at this statement. It's not like we go back to previous DLs just to read the comments other leechers wrote."

,Orangemohawk,2010-08-15T00:04Z,Can anybody tell me how to make a large iso into several smaller files like in here?
,manowx28,2010-08-15T08:03Z,"use winrar, right click on the iso and choose 

""add to archive""     

 Under the General tab, there is an area that says ""Split to volume, bytes,,now you just enter the amount of mb you want the file to be.

lets say i want pieces of 200 mb each...you enter that amount....then press ok......done:)"

,x5452-EO,2010-08-27T03:45Z,"thanks for the uploader.

the game is not that great, I've finished it in 5 hours session on normal difficulty, it was very short story. and what's the deal with the pixilated gore! not cool. 

anyway, co-op is good."
