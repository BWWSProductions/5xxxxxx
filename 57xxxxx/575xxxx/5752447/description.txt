An album dedicated to the memory of crossover saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr., M2 blends jazz with R&B, pop-rock, and funk. The result is very much like Washington's own '80s and '90s releases. Bassist Miller employs a cornucopia of instruments on this release, from clarinets to distorted guitars, synthesizers to drum machines. Three of the compositions,"Boomerang", "It's Me Again", and "Your Amazing Grace" include inspired vocal performances by Chaka Khan and others.
Still, M2 is a largely instrumental album, as Miller stretches the boundaries of multi-tracking by trying his hand at ahost of instruments including some you might not expect. Piecing together various combinations of tenor sax, alto sax, and bass clarinet on nine of the album's 14 tracks, Miller demonstrates surprising skill as a horn player. In addition, he layers keyboard, guitar, organ, electronic drums, and various effects (vinyl scratches, etc.) into the music. Nevertheless, Miller is joined by fine soloists throughout the album, and a live rhythm section is heard on five tracks.
