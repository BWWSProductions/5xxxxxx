I watched the source 
( The.Infidel.2010.720p.LiMiTED.BluRay.x264.AVCHD ) (4.35 GB) and it looks like a faked(upscaled) 720p. I don't doubt it was ripped from blue-ray because if you look at the snap shots at blue-ray.com the quality will be near the same;  http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Infidel-Blu-ray/11807/
It's a bit disappointing, still the movie is great but it's not worth to go for a 1080p release when ever will be around."

Here is the rip:

So the rip looks better in my opinion, so it's a cool release."
