  From the liner notes:
The sounds of birds, waters, or winds are often no longer perceived consciously. We have become so accustomed to them that they have faded into oblivion, or are covered up by manmade noises. By attending to nature sounds, we lift them back up into our awareness and allow them to have a harmonizing effect on our organism. And, since nature's music has no beginning or end, it easily creates a sense of timelessness.

"The task of art is to prepare the senses for never-ending delight and wonder and to reconcile man with surrounding rality" --Vermeer (painter)
