NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Cats and Dogs 2

Right sources used was the russian cam video off relizlab and some new line audio off KrackerMan....thanks to all 
Workdone....well we've took our first encode our this and cut the intro were the chairs were and cropped them off and then 
resized it to match the rest of the film.....now theres still some chairs but not as back but by doing this the AR is off for the first 
rew mins.
The rest of the film is just our video off the first ts we did so .....yes to flicker still 
Now the audio is a mew source thanks to Krackerman and is better in our opinion and is also complete so now more russian for the
intro 
The audio started and end at the same place the video did ...however it was just under a min shorter.....so for this we needed to stretch the audio 
to match the video time and then synced it from there....still needed 6 cuts but alot better than before as it was going oos every 2mins otherwise 
Not the easiest to sync as it's hard to sync to cats and dogs mouths so we tried to look for other noises and the people that were speaking in it to get it
in sync,so if there is any oos parts it will only be slightly.

Anyway enjoy this release and if it wasn't for that flicker it would be a pretty good release.
