the game doesnt strt....
the steam thing pops put n it gets downloaded from d steam "
[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T03:19Z,"To NYDant : try the next thing : move the demo folder after the conversion work to the next location : Programs or programs (x86) depending in where steam is installed \steam\steamapps\common\ put the demo in this common folder and change the name of the demo folder to : kane & lynch 2 - dog days demo  , exactly as you read and run the kl2.exe , maybe with the real name steam have for this demo and in the correct installation place that don´t happen and the game is launched with normality . Give it a try ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T03:33Z,"To NYDant : i think it is a real shot to get the demo running because for the 1st time i tried the next thing : i moved away the demo on the installation location in the steam folder then i tried to run my file from the desktop and i get a message of beeing ununvailable but when i moved back the demo folder to his installation place the executable of my file in the desktop worked , so i  didnÂ´t observated this correctly but with the correct name and in the appropriate place can really work , i never work files downloaded from steam and that the users really need the steam , i am starting to figure out beside the inconveniences if it is some way that my work can be used with normality , so helping me making the correct analysis will help in another nice demo that i can work fine to write the correct name on the demo folder and then in the instructions tell the exact location that the demo must be after the conversion work , please just try what i said and tell me if it worked with the original demo on the folder and demo in Programs (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\kane & lynch 2 - dog days demo  , the last separator have the original name of the demo on the steam exactly as you read , ok please try like this and tell me ifit worked , help me to help if you understand what i mean and next time if it is possible i put all the indications correct and the demo real work at the first time ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T03:41Z,"The name of the demo is already correct on the game folder and i tried the next thing : i putted away the original folder downloaded from the steam folder and i substitute the original for my worked file after the conversion work like it was the original one at the correct place and it worked 100% , so what i wasn´t get it it was the fact that the demo must be at the correct location for data steam register at the moment of the download , and probably the steam_api.dll is no problem too with the demo folder at the correct location ."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T05:57Z,"OK THIS USERS DEMO , EVERYTHING TESTED NOW AND IT WORKS 100% WITH A LIGHT WORK FROM STEAM ITSELF , I REPEAT THIS DEMO WAS CLOSE 1.5 GB DOWNLOADING FROM STEAM LIKE THIS IT IS MORE FAST , SO HERE IS THE PROCEDURE AFTER DOWNLOADING THE FILE : 1 - EXTRACT THE ARC FILE 2 - OPEN STEAM DIRECTORY AND CLICK IN THE STEAMAPPS FOLDER THEN CREATE A FOLDER CALLED COMMON INSIDE THIS FOLDER IF YOU ARE RUNNING STEAM FOR THE 1ST TIME 3 - MOVE THE EXTRACTED FOLDER LIKE IT IS TO THE CREATED (OR NOT) COMMON FOLDER IN STEAM\STEAMAPPS\COMMON\ 4 - RUN THE GLOBE CONVERTER.EXE 5 - WHEN IT FINISHES THE CONVERSION RUN THE HL2.EXE , IT LOOKS LIKE STEAM NEED TO ACT LIKE THE NORMAL DOWNLOAD BUT BECAUSE THE FILES ARE ALREADY IN THERE IT WILL BE QUICK TO UPDATE THE DEMO AND STEAM INCLUSIVE WILL INSTALL A DIRECTX 9.0C AND AFTER THAT IS GAME READY , SO IN A LITTLE MORE THAN A MINUTE THE STEAM WILL HAVE THE GME DEMO READY TO PLAY AND THATÂ´S IT 6 - HAPPY GAMING AND SOMETIMES I NEED TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE THINGS TO EXPLAIN THEM OK TO THE FILE USERS , OK WORKING 100% WITH THIS PROCEDURE NO DOUBT !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-08-13T06:09Z,"I T IS CONFIRMED TOO THAT IT IS MORE FAST TO GET THE DEMO FROM THIS FILE THEN AT THE STEAM , IF ON STEAM THE DOWNLOAD CAN TAKE HALF AN HOUR , TO ME TAKED 5 TO 10 MINUTES TO DOWNLOAD THIS FILE AND MORE 5 MINUTES TO PUTTED IN THE APPROPRIATE PLACE , RUNNING THE CONVERTER AND MAKE A LITTLE UPDATE FROM STEAM , SO I SPEND IT MAXIMUM BETWEEN 15 TO 20 MINUTES , LESS 10 MINUTES AT LEST THEN DOWNLOAD FROM STEAM . ENJOY YOUR GAME DEMO ..."
