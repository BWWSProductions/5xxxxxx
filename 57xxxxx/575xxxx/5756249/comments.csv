,dclau,2010-09-04T12:17Z,"Thank you, mate. You did a great job."

,wasd853,2010-09-27T04:27Z,"Im terribly sorry, But Im new to this, I can do games fine, but i'm shit at music I have toast but what do I do? could someone please help?"

,kalski,2010-09-28T17:33Z,Thanks a lot!!! Incredible torrent!
,DasSwift,2010-10-20T09:21Z,"Fantastic quality and everything's working, this is a must get download for Rammstein fans!"
,alecjw,2010-10-23T22:15Z,"Great upload, thanks! Shame the filenames don't have track numbers, but its easy enough to write a shell script to fix that :P"
,2bpirating,2010-10-23T22:55Z,"Did that on purpose :p
I like them to be clean. Just want to know what song it is, nothing more.
Sorry xD."
,alecjw,2010-10-24T00:08Z,"Ack, they dont even have track numbers in the tags! Also, the tracks are oversampled at 48kHz, which presumably means there's some quality loss there"
,2bpirating,2010-10-24T12:20Z,"You're right, oversampling will decrease some quality and my intention is to upload Rammstein at it's best quality.
This torrent even misses some songs!
I'll rip them again at 44.1 kHz with tracknumbers in the tags. Just give me a week or so and please help seeding when I've uploaded the torrent."
,Ardent1,2010-11-22T03:31Z,"Everybody should just FLAC it!
Thanks!"
,Janos_Audron,2010-12-22T19:56Z,Seed..... It's not giving me any seeders for this
,...X...,2011-01-05T10:52Z,"600.0+ kbps...

Nice!

A huge thank you."
,aboutwhat80,2011-01-18T18:03Z,"Still untagged and the individual tracks, while labeled, are unnumbered (and out of order)."
,scottsasse,2011-01-19T00:13Z,Danke schurn!!!!(misspelled???) At least I tried to say THANKS in German!!!
,2bpirating,2011-01-29T21:42Z,Will tag properly soon!
,h37927,2011-03-12T15:16Z,Thanks!
,foghead,2011-03-27T16:49Z,Thanks a million!  These songs REALLY rock the giant Cerwin Vegas (VS-150) which are being driven by a CLEAN 300 watts per channel from a vintage Sansui amp.  I wish more folks cared about the quality of the music they rip...
,valis2112,2011-03-31T03:55Z,"Great torrent, thanks.

Just to note though: Live aus Berlin is missing the song ""Tier"""
,disimagery2,2011-05-21T03:47Z,"no logs, no cues???

Highest quality for FLACs = EAC secure mode [w/ all configurations set properly first] & the creation of a log and NONCOMPLIANY cue sheet.

Additionally it is nice to include m3us and md5s."
,pvt.punch,2011-06-26T14:47Z,awesome stuff.
,worldmisanthropy,2011-07-26T20:20Z,"Rammstein lossless:
