,4forfun,2010-09-06T17:18Z,A nice collection if you like Disco holdouts that refused to die at the end of the 70's.  Not a true 80's representation here. The 80's was SO MUCH more that this collection! Sorry...not the real deal :(
,4forfun,2010-09-06T17:48Z,Oh..almost forgot...a lot of duplicate files here...just named differently and some songs are from the 70's and some from the 90's....so really a poor job of putting this together 
,focku666,2010-09-11T14:35Z,"@ 4forfun, i'm the original uploader, ok theres A FEW tunes from the wrong decade and maybe SOME duplicates. 

I never said this torrent was THE BEST of the 80's, but i think there's some good tunes on there and idiots like you really piss me off.

It's just MP3 FILES with no SCAMS or VIRUSES, its only around 2 gig and i think a good start to someones collection. SO IF U DON'T LIKE IT, DELETE AND FUCK OFF.

Everyone else feel free to add your opinion good or bad"
