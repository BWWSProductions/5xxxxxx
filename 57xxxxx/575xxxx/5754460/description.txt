Peter Sculthorpe (1929) is arguably the most prominent Australian composer. I have some of his works here from the two CDs that I could find. I'll try to find more and post them up as time permits.

Chamber music (performed by the Australian Chamber Orchestra):
Port Essington (1977)
Lament for Strings (1976, revised 1991)
Irkanda IV (1961)
Sonata for Strings (1984)

Orchestral music (performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under Stuart Challender):
Earth Cry (1986)
Irkanda IV (1961)
Small Town (1976)
Kakadu (1988)
Mangrove (1979)

Unfortunately there wasn't much information included about soloists.

Format is 256k VBR AAC. 

PLEASE REMEMBER that there are two versions of Irkanda IV on here; the Sydney sym. one is better I think.
