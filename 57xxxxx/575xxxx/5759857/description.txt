    Famous gardener Monty Don comes from a well-known          
    dynasty of architects on his mother's side of the         
    family, but knows little about his other relatives.      
                                                              
    He starts his investigation with a visit to his older      
    brother David. Amongst the family memorabilia they find   
    a photograph of their great grandmother, Charlotte       
    Wyatt, whose maiden name was Hodge. Monty is intrigued    
    as no-one in the family has spoken much of the Hodges.     
                                                              
    Monty's efforts lead him to a port near Anglesey where   
    he learns of extraordinary colonial travels and a         
    national disaster that ended in a family tragedy.          
                                                              
    On his father's side, Monty has heard that his           
    ancestors were part of the famous Keiller marmalade       
    dynasty, based in Dundee. Following their invention of     
    chip marmalade, the Keillers became immensely rich but    
    Monty's immediate family saw none of the fortune. So     
    where did the missing marmalade millions go?              
                                                               
    Monty travels to Scotland to discover how his great       
    grandfather was involved in the business. He unearths a  
    bitter family feud that finally answers his questions     
    about the Keiller fortune.
