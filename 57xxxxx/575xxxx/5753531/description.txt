More sketches from David Mitchell and Robert Webb's lopsided world. A modern-day Cyrano de Bergerac gives some tips on how to get Debbie to switch off EastEnders long enough to read her a love poem. There's an in-depth documentary about documentaries, and a very angry discussion about christenings. Meanwhile, David and Rob look for a sensitive new way to end their sketch show, just to prove they have depth.
