,HELLOW03034,2011-02-14T17:09Z,"So far I have found one page missing. I will post if I find any others.

The missing page is page 254 (I think) Regardless, it is the page containing the weekday comics originally printed on July 2, 3, and 4, 1987."

,P1rkk4n3n,2011-06-08T13:01Z,"Resolution: Great! Finally the older comics can be read with higher resolution. Good job in that regard! This was long overdue..
Colors: Weird! What happened to the colors? They look like someone scanned black&white-versions of those sunday strips and then tried to quickly re-color them with photoshop afterwards (without knowing what they are doing).

 Just compare to the paper versions, and you will see what I mean. Just horrible.. Please scan the original, already-colored versions instead of this mess! (I know it would produce artifacts, but if you use high enough resolution and then filter it a bit when scaling it down in resolution (while still retaining a high enough resolution for this), you can get very good results. The moirĂÂŠ-effect is annoying, but can't be helped. I think it happens when pixels and the dithering technique used for the coloring process sort of 'clash'.. to represent dithered graphics with another grid.. well, it is troublesome.

But it can certainly look better than these colors, they even FEEL wrong! (I mean, the feeling you get from those awful colors is not what you get from the paper versions, but something horrible instead)

Not to mention all the mistakes.. the hair is too yellow, the shirt is too red, but the skin isn't nearly pink enough! Many parts are even left completely uncolored.. I'd rather have completely non-colored versions of the sunday strips than these hurls of some sunday photoshop user. "
,P1rkk4n3n,2011-06-08T13:22Z,"Never mind, I was too hasty again. Only a few first sunday strips seem to have this problem, then it starts appearing as if someone DID scan them in high res, filter a bit and scale them down to the proper resolution later on. Sorry about that. I would delete my hasty comment, but I have no idea how to do that here. "
