Use Spy Pic to take pictures on the sly.

Who needs a brooding butler or a wacky scientist to deliver up the latest in covert technologies when you could have Spy Pic? Spy Pic is the answer to all your surreptitious activities. Well, the ones that involve a camera at least.

Have you ever wanted to go unnoticed while photographing a lopsided bouffant at the mall, or sneak a peek at a nose picker behind you on the metro?

Spy Pic -- for the moments you canâ€™t be obvious.

Features:

- Take pictures discretelyâ€”of anythingâ€”while appearing to operate your phone normally with the help of an â€œalibi activityâ€

- Tap anywhere on the screen to take the picture

- Shake your phone to change the camera from front to back*

- Swipe left or right to change your â€œalibi activityâ€ to avoid detection.

- Swipe up or down to adjust the transparency of your â€œalibi activityâ€ to reveal what the camera sees. This will enable you to lightly see what you are taking a photo of with out compromising the mission completely.

- Photos automatically saved to your phoneâ€™s photo album

- Email photos directly from app

- iOS 4.0 enabled: use fast app switching to always have SpyPic ready
