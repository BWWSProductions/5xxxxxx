[T],simmyboy80,2010-08-12T11:09Z,"@wizardopaz

this game has been fixed , if you use woods 1.11 firmware along with moonshell 2.10 this ROM will be compatible with your R4 flashcard"
,wizardopaz,2010-08-12T18:55Z,ok! thnx!!
,shreksdonkeyy,2010-08-12T20:26Z,"hey simmyboy80 gr8 work and thax but...theres always a but lol , i have tried this on the r4 with wood 1.11, combined with moonshell 2.10, i can get to the first lesson but it keeps freezing up on me, any suggestions."
[T],simmyboy80,2010-08-12T21:24Z,"@shreksdonkeyy

woods firmware updates are released on average once a month so wait for v1.12 and see on the fix list if this ROM is listed , alot of flashcarts are experiencing the same freeze/save problems so i guess it will be on the next updates for all cards"
,midwayandy,2010-08-13T14:51Z,hi i put woods1.11 and moonshell2.10 on r4 mine freezes too. since i put woods and moonshell on ive lost my homepage.i cant read any of the games on the start up menu.anyone know what ive done wrong.
,clubberlang1,2010-08-13T16:35Z,Works on R4I 1.24b but crashes after i did the first lesson on drawing the apple :) i was hoping to be a master artist by this evening. Anyone know a fix for the crashing??
,kiel1986,2010-08-13T18:04Z,thanks
,TehAgent,2010-08-14T16:05Z,"Woods only works on Genuine R4 cards and not on clones. as they stopped making genuine R4 cards and 1:1 copies are hard to spot, so only genuine R4 cards with woods 1.11 can play this. 

For everyone else, we all have the same problem, it freezes after you draw the apple stem. going to just have to wait i suppose. but in the mean time, go download Colors NDS, much better controls, better color palette editor. the only thing colors doesnt do that this does. is teach you HOW to draw."
,shreksdonkeyy,2010-08-14T18:02Z,"@ tehagent, even if you have genuine R4+ woods, it will still freeze, i can only manage to get to the first lesson and try it for a short while, this includes free paint also, i think every 1 is going to have to wait for fix.

R4I, with 1.24b (official software), the game does exactly the same as R4 with woods.

Supercard dsone with Evolution_V1.0 sp4, game loads really slow, 30 seconds or so, but seems to work, i will repost problems."

,wizardopaz,2010-08-16T11:26Z,can you make it work on R4 card with moonshell 1.71???I can't update 2.10
[T],simmyboy80,2010-08-16T12:08Z,"@wizardopaz

yes moonshell 1.71 should be compatible with woods firmware"

,kreem,2010-11-20T12:49Z,This game starts with the M3i Zero and latest firmware/software but crashes after you draw the circle - same deal with the R4i SDHC with latest software.  This does display the text correctly tho.
