,garycooper,2010-08-16T21:12Z,MBOSS is right. Download latest version off the various download sites. install your german version. put shortcut on desktop. dont update drivers. go to help in menu on german one you installed and you will see register. hit that and put in your serial. close down german version. go to directory where german version is and copy the genius.exe file and paste to desktop. install your downloaded english version. when done. copy and paste the german genius.exe from desktop into new directory for english one - overwrite the english exe with german. the double click your shortcut on desktop for the original german version. thats it - it runs the english version with the german exe.
