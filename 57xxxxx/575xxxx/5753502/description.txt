PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT & RATE THE TORRENT! Thanks.

This is a small e-book pack consisting of books by James Bamford, Nicky Hager and NSA internal documents released under FOIA.
Unfortunately I can't get hold of more James Bamford's books- if you do have either  "A Pretext for War: 9/11" or "The Puzzle Palace" please share them.

None of this books is of any conspiracy-theory type. It's all well researched.

Document released under FOIA are partially censored- all are searchable PFD of good quality (especially compared to what has been released previously)

The last file is NSA Employee Manual- I have no way of confirming that it's genuine but it seems to be. It's also pretty old but deals with universal matters- what not to do, how to talk about your work in public, how to handle security procedures and some administrative things.

All books are individually packed with WinRAR with only one PDF file inside- no malware, no SFX achieves.
