"Summer Day" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow. It was released as the first single from Crow's seventh studio album 100 Miles from Memphis.

"Summer Day" is a delightfully breezy slice of glory-days AM radio pop. "I wanted to experiment with writing something simple and positive," says Crow. "The feeling of a great, solid loveâ€”not just a new love, but something everlasting." 

The song was A-listed on BBC Radio 2 for the week commencing 3rd July.

100 Miles from Memphis is the seventh studio album from American singer and songwriter Sheryl Crow. The album was written and produced by Crow, Doyle Bramhall II and Justin Stanley and features the musicians Tommy Sims and Chris Bruce. On this album she ditches her country and pop-rock past in favor of a vintage Memphis-styled, soul-inspired record. Although an extraordinaire on such instruments as bass, piano and acoustic guitar, Crow concentrates on singing throughout the album, which features some covers, including Citizen Cope's "Sideways" and The Jackson 5's "I Want You Back".
