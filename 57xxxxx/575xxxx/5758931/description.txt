No single mental ability is more important to personal success than a powerful memory. While most adults and children have 
the capacity for phenomenal memory, few ever know the simple secrets of harnessing this amazing power. In this book, through 
a unique cartoon-style format, you will learn a powerful but incredibly simple technique of dynamic recall. The concept was
originally designed for children but has been expanded to teach the technique to any reader of any age, although children
can demonstrate exceptional performance with these skills.

MEMORY LANGUAGE gives you the key to a great power. Imagine being able to remember the answers for an examination, an entire
shopping list, bus timetables, your daily goals, formulas and key information. With MEMORY LANGUAGE there will be no more
'Gee - I forgot.'

MEMORY LANGUAGE is a unique and powerful tool.

And it's a superb investment.

What's more, an average adult can learn the technique in about 48 minutes.................
