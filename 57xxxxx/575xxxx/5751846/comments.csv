,Monkdaddy1,2010-09-08T12:27Z,is there any scene info or is this an indi?  is it tv or dvd?
,novamdm,2010-09-11T11:21Z,"@Monk: It's a TV rip.  However, this series is now 12 years old and most of the footage is mainly either decades old or interviews, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  It tooks me weeks to download myself so just keep at it.  A better way to go about it might be to set a few files to high priority in your BT client, and enjoy them while you wait for more episodes to finish.

@fritz: Again I am simply posting the torrent I went looking for an found, am not responsible for the files or filenames.  But glad others appreciating it."

,RegPulp,2012-04-11T18:22Z,"very bias towards what the Americans put into the subject of guns, Great Britain was using guns before Americas was even founded, but that seems to be skipped, in fact all the history of guns in Europe has been skipped, the first episode for example goes straight to America, and how they started the gun boom industry....
meaning about three centuries of history on guns have been skipped...... such a waste.

this series is from a single minded view of America, and what they did, and although there is nothing wrong with that, it does mean the beginning of this series is missing so much information from what other countries did for the gun industry, which quite frankly is a lot considering how guns have been around LONG before America existed!

It also brings into argument the bias this series has on the overview off ""tales of the guns"""
,RegPulp,2012-04-11T18:31Z,"i forgot to add, when taking into account of the entire world, arabs were using guns back in the 14th century, and late 15th century the Ottoman empire was using muskets in it's standard infantry, again no mention of that..... the title should of been ""Americans history of guns""

that kind of title would of been far less misleading, because that is really what this series IS!"
