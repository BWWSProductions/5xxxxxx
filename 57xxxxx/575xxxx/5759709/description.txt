Here is the GOG.com version of the classic top-down scrolling shooter Raptor: Call of the Shadows.  It is Windows XP/Vista/7-friendly.

What's cool about it:
    * An impressive arsenal of upgradeable, hard-core, deadly weapons!
    * According to Gametrailers.com and ScrewAttack one of the best 2D shooters ever created
    * Fast-paced action and a pulse-pounding soundtrack to pump some adrenaline into your veins!

The 2010 Edition features improved graphics and native support for higher resolutions (640x400, 960x600 and 1280x800). Standard, oldschool graphics are also available. 

Support GOG.com and their quest to revive the good ol' days of gaming and purchase this game for the low price of $6!  If you like it, buy it!

Cheers mateys!
