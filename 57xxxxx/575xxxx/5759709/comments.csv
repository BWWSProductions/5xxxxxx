Right-click on the game shortcut, select properties then under the compatibility tab enable ""Run this program as an administrator"""
,ColinReste,2010-10-09T23:14Z,"The application failed to start because blah, blah, blah the file is complete bullshit. "
,phoenix87ta,2010-10-17T19:49Z,"You know, it's actually not ""complete bullshit.""  There's a runtime dependency that's not being satisfied here.  Regrettably, the developer doesn't mention what it is, and merely recommends running Windows Update to ensure that everything's up to date.  I'll certainly let you know when I find out what the dependency is."
,phoenix87ta,2010-10-17T19:51Z,Update: It's the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 runtimes you're looking for.  Works perfectly once you've installed them.

,LightTheRebellion,2011-03-22T06:43Z,"Installs fine on Windows 7 64-bit, but doesn't allow me to save."
,Elysium07,2011-04-13T06:13Z,"Another wonderful game, was really saddened when my old version would end up messing up color wise. Thanks for this. :)"
,thantos123,2011-07-15T07:37Z,"Raptor: Call of the Shadows updated for modern operating systems, with improved graphics!?

I. Came. Buckets. :D"
,ikonomov,2011-08-08T00:49Z,"Anybody having problems saving, just run the game  as administrator."
,halofubar,2011-11-19T09:23Z,"Awesome. I remember playing this back in the day, glad GOG.com got it updated."
