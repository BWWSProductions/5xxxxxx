,Sanitarium51,2010-08-13T05:32Z,Is this a legit FLAC rip or is it a transcode?
,iAmAffinity,2010-08-13T08:20Z,"Well, the FLAC is real, except track # 7 and # 11 were made weirdly, the songs aren't full for those, other than that, they are amazing. I need those 2 tracks fixed so I can have a LEGIT copy of the album."
,320hunter,2010-08-13T09:30Z,"@Sanitarium51 i can not this is actually true, I am sure you know what you are talking about. But I do not have anything other than this material. I can rip if I thought it went a bit fast. PEACE"
,iAmAffinity,2010-08-13T17:19Z,"@320hunter, do you own the CD? If so, please re rip the FLAC and 320k. Two of the files are incomplete."

this is sad  news.I hate this fuckin Loudness war!Ruins a lot of potential great albums!

I wish this stupid idea disapear at once!"
,CGar,2010-10-27T14:21Z,though i cant verify the track 7 or 11 problem i can say that track 9 verifies 100% as CD Audio usinf auCDtect From TAU Software. i got the rest from Iron Maiden-The Final Frontier-(FLAC)-2010-FRAG and everything else but track 9 verifies correctly.
