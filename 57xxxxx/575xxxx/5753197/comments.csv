,sg71,2010-08-11T08:50Z,I don't mean to be a spoil sport or anything but most of you are giving the video a 9 and that seems a bit generous to me. It's not as sharp as I'd expect for a DVD rip even at the smaller size of 700mb. Maybe a 7?

,Felesar,2010-08-13T04:57Z,"looks great. Haven't heard of or seen anything about this until now, but the trailers at imdb look fantastic. Kind of an HBO Rome meets Spartacus Blood and Sand meets Pillars of the Earth meets Gladiator type film, which is right up my alley.
Just wish there weren't so many hit and runs on the seed factor - I'm seeing 15(13802) and only pulling 20kB/s, which is about the slowest torrent I have ever seen. 

If you leech it, please be kind and seed it for at least as long as it took you to download. 

Looking forward to this title, cheers. Thanks for the up."

Anyway,Quality is great...

Movie is 3/10..They get the 3 coz of good cinematography,music and average acting.Plot sucks big time..Dialouges are utter crap and they contain words like fuck..it would be ok in a sci-fiction movie but this is a historic/medieval based movie..

...right

do you honestly think that people in the time this movie takes place (btw: this is not the middle ages, it's is waaaay before that) did not swear? if so, think again..."

@full_anka

Actually, the first account of the word \""fuck\"" didn\'t come till around the 1400\'s, making the use in this movie historically inaccurate.


...pretty much every word we use today (in english) has not been used by the romans, as they obviously spoke latin. so from your point of view, every ""historically based movie"" is incorrect as the characters use words that didn't exist back then. durr!

there are, however, a lot of latin swear words, which were perfectly common amongst the normal people:

mentula - dick
muliebris - faggot
merda - shit
etc.

plus, there's even a direct correspondence between fuck and a latin word, although it's not certain wheter they're related

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck#Via_Latin_or_Greek

and what i was trying to say with my first comment: people cussed in every culture and/or language. one of the most common english cuss words is fuck, so it's certainly not a bad option for expressing cuss words of the respective language."
,sanaa17,2010-08-18T00:09Z,"Lot's of complaints for a FREE movie. I liked it, the action sequences were cool, quality kills, good costumes.

Quality is very good, too..."
