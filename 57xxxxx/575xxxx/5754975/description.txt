"Static"

After returning to town, Joe's troubles worsen 
as he suffers from frightening side effects 
caused by his "reeducation." The rest of the 
group is left wondering whether they would 
simply be better off without him. Concerned by 
the chaotic mess the town has become, the 
Director of "The Program" sends a surprising 
new night manager and second-in-command, Liam 
Ulrich (Alan Smyth) to restore order. 
Meanwhile, Renbe (Gerald Kyd) and Kat (Lola 
Glaudini) get raided by local South American 
police, which ends in Renbe's arrest.

Enjoy :)
